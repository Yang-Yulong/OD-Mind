paleoclimate and paleoceanographic studies,present,opportunities to study the dynamics of the climate system,Abstract,"Paleoclimate and paleoceanographic studies present opportunities to study the dy­ namics of the climate system by examining how it responds to external forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas and solar radiation changes) and how its interacting components gen­ erate climate oscillations and abrupt changes. Of note is the amplified recent warm­ ing of the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, which is presumably related to sea ice albedo feedback and teleconnections to other regions; both the behavior of sea ice–climate interactions and the role of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circula­ tion in climate change can be studied with geologic records of past climate change in the Bering Sea.",1,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

global climate,evolved from,being warm with only small Northern Hemisphere glaciers,Abstract,"Over the last 5 m.y., global climate has evolved from being warm with only small Northern Hemisphere glaciers to being cold with major Northern Hemisphere glaci­ ations every 100–40 k.y. The ultimate reasons for this major transition are unknown. Over the last hundreds of thousands of years, Milankovitch- and millennial-scale cli­ mate oscillations have occurred. Although the regional environmental changes re­ flected in the sediment are known in some regions, the mechanisms by which they propagate globally are not understood. Possible mechanisms responsible for both the long-term evolution of global climate as well as the generation of high-frequency cli­ mate oscillations involve processes such as intermediate water ventilation and sea ice formation in the North Pacific. However, the paucity of data in critical regions of the Pacific such as the Bering Sea has prevented an evaluation of the role of North Pacific processes in global climate change. Because North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) has the potential to be influenced by dense water forming in the Bering Sea and be­ cause of the potential far-field impacts of sea ice, the Bering Sea may be critically in­ volved in causing major climate changes. Thus, drilling in the Bering Sea may help answer questions not only about the global extent of climate trends and oscillations but about the mechanisms that produce them.",1,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

The characterization of intermediate and deep water masses, including evidence from benthic foraminifers and sediment laminations, for episodes of low-oxygen conditions in the Bering Sea throughout the last 5 m.y. 3. The terrigenous and biogenic sedimentary history of the Bering Sea, including evidence for strong climatological and sea level control of siliciclastic deposition at all sites. Records of lithostratigraphic variations indicate that Bering Sea environmental conditions were strongly linked to global climate change; this is apparent both in long-term million year trends and in the orbital, millennial, and shorter oscillations within the lithostratigraphic records generated at sea.",2,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

rate of recent global warming,is,difficult to understand,Introduction,"The rate and regional expression of recent global warming is difficult to understand and even more difficult to predict because of the complex nature of the climate sys­ tem, whose components interact nonlinearly with various time lags and timescales.

bottom and intermediate depth water,originates from,North Pacific,Geological and physical setting,"Bottom and intermediate depth water in the Bering Sea originates from the North Pacific. After flowing into the Bering Sea it is slightly modified by the mixing of relatively fresh, warm water with very small amounts of bottom water formed within the Bering Sea today (Warner and Roden, 1995). Nutrient concentrations of North Pacific origin are high compared to all other regions in the global oceans; this explains the very low oxygen concentrations in the Bering Sea today (Fig. F4). The oxygen and nutrient composition of these waters is further modified by denitrification (Lehmann et al., 2005) and respiration of organic matter in the water column (Nedashkovskiy and Sapozhnikov, 1999).

Bering Land Bridge (Beringia),emergence,prior to the Neogene,Pliocene–Pleistocene trends,"The emergence of the Bering Land Bridge (Beringia) prior to the Neogene is not well understood. However, Pliocene climate change—and perhaps the onset of NHG, spe­ cifically—could have been affected by changes in the marine gateway connection through the Bering Strait region.

The oldest ages for these occurrences range from 6.3–5.1 to 2.2 Ma (e.g., Uozumi et al., 1986), but a recent study documented that the age of first occurrence was 5.5–5.4 Ma (Gladenkov, 2006). One of the aims of drilling was to recover better records of oceanographic evolution related to the Miocene/Pliocene gateway history.

Flow through the Bering Strait,is controlled by,sea level change and changes in the amount of perennial sea ice,Pliocene–Pleistocene trends,"Flow through the Bering Strait is likely controlled mainly by sea level change and changes in the amount of perennial sea ice. Pacific to Arctic flow through the Bering Strait (\~0.8 Sv) (Coachman and Aagaard, 1981) significantly influences the Pacific–At­ lantic partitioning of physical and nutrient properties in the modern ocean and was possibly quite sensitive to past changes in sea level change due to its shallow sill of \~50 m (see Takahashi, 2005, for an illustration of the cross section). During glacial in­ tervals, Atlantic Ocean biogenic sedimentation and preservation became more Pa­ cific-like, and vice versa, and there were major changes in nutrient distributions.

regional differences,especially between,Pleistocene sections of the Bowers Ridge and Bering slope sites,Lithostratigraphic summary,"The distributions of the sedimentary components and sedimentary structures and their variability both within and between the Expedition 323 sites account for changes of the biogenic, glaciomarine, terrigenous, and volcanogenic sediment sources and the environmental conditions present during sediment deposition. The scales of these lithologic variations indicate that sedimentation in the Bering Sea has recorded long-term trends that include the critical period of reorganization of Earth’s climate from the warm early Pliocene and the transition into the ice ages.

Expedition 323,preserve,record of sedimentation ranging from the late Pliocene through the Holocene (between 1.74 Ma and recent),Lithostratigraphic summary,"All sites drilled during Expedition 323 preserve a record of sedimentation ranging from the late Pliocene through the Holocene (between 1.74 Ma and recent). Litholo­ gies and sedimentation rates vary between the different sites, as indicated by a basinwide comparison of the evolution of sedimentation in the Bering Sea during this pe­ riod (Fig. F6). The slowest sedimentation rates (only 4.5 cm/k.y.) were observed at Site U1342, where laminated foraminifer-rich diatom ooze beds alternate with silty clay beds at scales ranging in the Milankovitch band. The same temporal interval corre­ sponds to a much thicker section at Sites U1340 and U1341, where the bedding alter­ nations are less distinct and the abundance of IRD is higher. Although lamination is common at Sites U1342 and U1340, laminae are virtually absent at the deeper Site U1341, suggesting a shallowing of the depth of the OMZ during most of the Pleisto­ cene. At the Bering Sea slope site, sedimentation rates are about three times higher than at the Bowers Ridge sites.

The sections are pervasively bioturbated and laminated intervals are rare. Overall, sedimentation on the Bering slope is characterized by higher influence of both siliciclastic material delivered by ice sheets as well as terrig­ enous sedimentation derived from the continental shelf and slope, which are in­ dented by some of the largest submarine canyons in the world. However, because of their proximity to the continents, it is not clear whether the sediments characterized by high siliciclastic content are recording periods of ice sheet expansion (stadials) or increased runoff (interstadials). IRD is a common feature at all sites during this time period and increases significantly around 1 Ma, as is also observed in coeval sedi­ ments from the North Pacific based on the results of Leg 145 (Krissek, 1995).",15,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

During the 40 K world, cycles and episodes of deposition of IRD on Bowers Ridge were possibly impacted by regional climate changes responding to both obliq­ uity (40 k.y.) and precession (23 k.y.) solar radiation changes. In contrast, at the Ber­ ing slope, sea level variations that occur dominantly with 40 k.y. periodicity were the main factor controlling the transport of sediment from the continent/shelf to the slope.

observation of high-latitude climate response to precession forcing,has implications for,theories that explain ice volume changes,Cyclical siliciclastic deposition and its relationship to climate change,"As at the Bering slope sites, the variability of physical properties in sediments younger than 1 Ma at Bowers Ridge appears to include higher frequency variability than the 100 k.y. ice volume cycles. Again, higher frequency climate variability, including changes in the distribution of sea ice and icebergs delivering sediment to Bowers Ridge, may dominate the mode of sediment deposition in the Bering Sea after 1 Ma. However, unlike at the Bering slope sites the variability of all lithologic parameters studied—NGR, magnetic susceptibility, and GRA bulk density—in sediment older than 1 Ma at Bowers Ridge is not dominantly paced by 40 k.y. ice volume cycles. One explanation is that even in the 40 K world sediment delivery to Bowers Ridge was paced at least in part by processes other than sea level change.

Analogous to sea ice–associated diatom and dinoflagellate taxa, a clear increasing trend in abundance of intermediate water– dwelling radiolarian taxa at the MPT is also observed at Sites U1343 and U1344. This is consistent with the interpretation that the surface water became gradually more af­ fected by the formation of sea ice as climate progressively cooled; in the presence of sea ice, surface-dwelling radiolarians disappeared, and, as a consequence, the relative percentages of intermediate water dwellers such as Cycladophora davisiana were higher (Abelmann, 1992b; Okazaki et al., 2003).",20,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

Bowers Ridge,show,distinct differences in the extent of sea ice cover,History of sea ice development,"As noted above, the Bowers Ridge and Bering slope regions show distinct differences in the extent of sea ice cover throughout the last \~2.1 m.y., the time period covered by the sedimentary records of both regions. The extent of sea ice cover of the latter is substantially greater than that of the former because of the distal locations of the three Bering slope sites, which are most prone to perennial sea ice cover in the Bering Sea. The spatial differences in sea ice cover today are mainly attributed to the surface water circulation pattern (Fig. F2); this spatial difference appears to have persisted since at least 2.1 Ma, implying that the surface water circulation patterns have also persisted (see below for details with N. seminae and other taxa). This is further sup­ ported by the fact that at Site U1339 on Umnak Plateau, the site closest to an entry point of Alaskan Stream subarctic Pacific water, the sea ice taxa suggest lower levels of sea ice cover compared to the Bering slope sites farther north, which are not as heavily impacted by Alaskan Stream water. Furthermore, Katsuki and Takahashi (2005) illus­ trated that during the low sea level stand of the Last Glacial Maximum, the relatively warm subarctic Alaskan Stream water entered into the Bering Sea through the western Aleutian passes rather than the eastern passes because of their shallow water depth. After entry it turns eastward, flowing counter-clockwise around Bowers Ridge, and consequently reaches the southeast corner of the Bering Sea, close to Site U1339 on Umnak Plateau, before turning northwest.

Site KST-1B,inside,Kamchatka Strait,Changes in bottom and intermediate water conditions,"Much of the Pacific water entering the Bering Sea is matched by outflow through the Aleutian Islands. The most significant outflow is through the Kamchatka Strait, which has a maximum water depth of 4420 m. If some component of North Pacific Intermediate or deep water formed in the Bering Sea in the past, particularly when sea level was lower, it would have flowed out through the Kamchatka Strait or a second­ ary outlet near the Commander–Near Strait at 2000 m. One of the scientific objectives of Expedition 323 was to elucidate the history, temporal variability, and intensity of NPIW and deep water formation in the Bering Sea and its links to surface water pro­ cesses. This objective was partially fulfilled during the expedition but would have been more adequately addressed had we obtained permission to drill two important sites located in Russian territorial waters, Shirshov Ridge Site SHR-3B at 2232 m water depth and Site KST-1B inside the Kamchatka Strait at 3435 m water depth.

Site U1339,was,to study high-resolution paleoceanography in the easternmost part of the Bering Sea,Site U1339,"The primary objective of drilling at Site U1339 (prospectus Site UMK-4D) was to study high-resolution paleoceanography in the easternmost part of the Bering Sea, a mar­ ginal sea expected to exhibit large variations during times of global climate change. Umnak Plateau (Fig. F14) is located off Bristol Bay and is well situated for the study of past changes in surface water conditions, sea ice extent, and associated biological productivity. Today, parts of the relatively warm Alaskan Stream surface water flow into the Bering Sea through Unimak and Amukta passes and hence sea ice is not formed in this region. However, substantial sea ice coverage has been noted during the LGM, when sea level was \~100 m lower than today, indicating that the influence of relatively warm water from the distal end of the Alaskan Stream was reduced. This may have been because water entering the Bering Sea from the Pacific Ocean through Unimak and Amukta passes was at least partially restricted when sea level dropped; the warm Pacific water could have more easily passed through the deeper passes lo­ cated in the central and western Aleutians, such as Amchitka Strait (Katsuki and Taka­ hashi, 2005). Thus, monitoring past environmental conditions at Umnak Plateau can provide an understanding of the impact of changes in water exchange between the Pacific and Bering Sea waters. Since these eastern passes are fairly shallow (\~50 m and 430 m), little intermediate or deep water flows out to the Pacific in this region. As such, records from Umnak Plateau should provide us with different information than the western sites, which are closer to deep passes where surface water flow may not have been strongly inhibited by sea level changes and where dense water exchange with the Pacific Ocean is more likely to occur (Tanaka and Takahashi, 2005).

This may have been because water entering the Bering Sea from the Pacific Ocean through Unimak and Amukta passes was at least partially restricted when sea level dropped; the warm Pacific water could have more easily passed through the deeper passes lo­ cated in the central and western Aleutians, such as Amchitka Strait (Katsuki and Taka­ hashi, 2005). Thus, monitoring past environmental conditions at Umnak Plateau can provide an understanding of the impact of changes in water exchange between the Pacific and Bering Sea waters. Since these eastern passes are fairly shallow (\~50 m and 430 m), little intermediate or deep water flows out to the Pacific in this region. As such, records from Umnak Plateau should provide us with different information than the western sites, which are closer to deep passes where surface water flow may not have been strongly inhibited by sea level changes and where dense water exchange with the Pacific Ocean is more likely to occur (Tanaka and Takahashi, 2005).

triple combo,recorded data,below the bottom of the pipe depth,Downhole measurements,"By employing the deployed triple combination (triple combo) and the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string combinations, data were recorded below the bottom of the pipe depth. They indicate good hole conditions and only minor excur­ sions from the nominal size of the drill bit. The comparison of the gamma ray and density logs with the NGR and GRA track measurements on cores recovered and with moisture and density (MAD) measurements shows good agreement, which should al­ low for reliable core-log integration. All logs were referenced to the seafloor depth of 1875 m wireline log depth below rig floor (WRF) identified during the last pass of the FMS-sonic tool string. Comparison of the gamma ray logs measured during the main pass of the two runs shows an excellent repeatability between the two runs. The resis­ tivity values measured by the electrode spherically focused resistivity (SFLU) measure­ ment were lower than those recorded by induction measurements, probably because of current loss at the electrodes.

Bowers Ridge is well situ­ ated to allow study of the past extent of water mass exchange with the Pacific Ocean through the adjacent Aleutian passes such as the Amukta, Amchitka, and Buldir passes. In particular, its location allows examination of the influence of the warm Alaskan Stream water mass entry into this region, which influenced the distribution of past sea ice coverage (Katsuki and Takahashi, 2005). Although productivity in the Bering Sea in general is very high with respect to other parts of the global oceans, the expected productivity at this site was lower than at Site U1339, which has substan­ tially greater influence from the nearby Bering shelf and which was exposed during glacial lowstands. We selected this site at relatively shallow water depth to study phys­ ical and chemical changes in upper water mass conditions such as the low dissolved oxygen concentration conditions that caused the formation of laminated sediments at a site on the Bering slope at similar water depths (Cook et al., 2005).

Bowers Ridge,allows study of,past extent of water mass exchange with the Pacific Ocean,Background and objectives,"The primary objective of drilling at Site U1340 (prospectus Site BOW-12B) was to study high-resolution Pliocene and Pleistocene paleoceanography in the southern­ most part of the Bering Sea at a topographic high on Bowers Ridge (Fig. F20), where relatively good calcium carbonate preservation is expected.

Unit I,is composed of,alternating beds of diatom ooze and diatom silt with minor amounts of mixed and volcaniclastic sediment from the Pleistocene,Lithostratigraphy,"Three lithologic units were defined at Site U1340 (Fig. F25). Unit I is composed of al­ ternating beds of diatom ooze and diatom silt with minor amounts of mixed and vol­ caniclastic sediment from the Pleistocene. The most prominent sedimentary structure in Unit I is soft-sediment deformation of laminated and bedded diatom ooze and dia­ tom silt. Intervals with soft-sediment deformation were observed from Core 323- U1340A-3H to Section 8H-2 and in Cores 11H, 12H, 14H, and 15H; from Cores 323- U1340B-3H to 6H; in Cores 323-U1340C-2H and 3H; and in all cores from Hole U1340D. Folded and tilted bed boundaries are clearly visible in these cores, suggesting the occurrence of synsedimentary slumps as a potential mechanism for the deforma­ tion. Distinct volcaniclastic layers ranging in thickness between a few millimeters and 3 cm occur throughout the unit. Volcanic ash is a common secondary or trace litho­ logic component. A major component of the sediment in Unit I is biogenic and pre­ dominantly composed of diatoms with generally good preservation. Diatom frustules hosting pyrite framboids were observed. Terrigenous particles are also a major com­ ponent in Unit I. The most abundant terrigenous grain types are silt-sized feldspar, quartz, clay, mica, and rock fragments. Some pebbles are composed of basalt and pumice or scoria, indicating a volcanic source. Bioturbation varies from slight to strong throughout all holes and is typically characterized by a mottling defined by color changes. The main lithologies are olive to dark gray diatom ooze and dark gray to dark greenish gray diatom silt with variable amounts of dispersed vitric ash, iso­ lated pebbles, and distinct ash layers as well as bioturbated ash/diatom ooze layers and laminated intervals. The light-colored sediments (olive) tend to contain predom­ inantly biogenic components, whereas the dark-colored sediments (gray) tend to con­ tain subequal proportions of siliciclastic and biogenic components. The volcanic ash layers are typically black, light gray, and, rarely, weak red. Unit II comprises diatom ooze with minor amounts of diatom silt and mixed and volcaniclastic sediment from the Pliocene. Unit II differs from Unit I in having significantly more diatom ooze, less interbedded diatom silt, and fewer laminated intervals. A layer of gravel was recov­ ered at 380 m CSF from Hole U1340A. This is directly below an interval of frequent deposition of gravel-sized clasts at \~220–360 m CSF. This gravel-rich interval overlaps the base of Unit I and the top of Unit II. Unit III, which is further divided into Sub­ units IIIA and IIIB, comprises diatom-bearing, sponge-spicule-rich ashy sand; spongespicule-rich diatom ooze; diatom ooze; and minor amounts of volcaniclastic and sili­ ciclastic sediment from the Pliocene in age.

Unit II,comprises,diatom ooze with minor amounts of diatom silt and mixed and volcaniclastic sediment from the Pliocene,Lithostratigraphy,"Three lithologic units were defined at Site U1340 (Fig. F25). Unit I is composed of al­ ternating beds of diatom ooze and diatom silt with minor amounts of mixed and vol­ caniclastic sediment from the Pleistocene. The most prominent sedimentary structure in Unit I is soft-sediment deformation of laminated and bedded diatom ooze and dia­ tom silt. Intervals with soft-sediment deformation were observed from Core 323- U1340A-3H to Section 8H-2 and in Cores 11H, 12H, 14H, and 15H; from Cores 323- U1340B-3H to 6H; in Cores 323-U1340C-2H and 3H; and in all cores from Hole U1340D. Folded and tilted bed boundaries are clearly visible in these cores, suggesting the occurrence of synsedimentary slumps as a potential mechanism for the deforma­ tion. Distinct volcaniclastic layers ranging in thickness between a few millimeters and 3 cm occur throughout the unit. Volcanic ash is a common secondary or trace litho­ logic component. A major component of the sediment in Unit I is biogenic and pre­ dominantly composed of diatoms with generally good preservation. Diatom frustules hosting pyrite framboids were observed. Terrigenous particles are also a major com­ ponent in Unit I. The most abundant terrigenous grain types are silt-sized feldspar, quartz, clay, mica, and rock fragments. Some pebbles are composed of basalt and pumice or scoria, indicating a volcanic source. Bioturbation varies from slight to strong throughout all holes and is typically characterized by a mottling defined by color changes. The main lithologies are olive to dark gray diatom ooze and dark gray to dark greenish gray diatom silt with variable amounts of dispersed vitric ash, iso­ lated pebbles, and distinct ash layers as well as bioturbated ash/diatom ooze layers and laminated intervals. The light-colored sediments (olive) tend to contain predom­ inantly biogenic components, whereas the dark-colored sediments (gray) tend to con­ tain subequal proportions of siliciclastic and biogenic components. The volcanic ash layers are typically black, light gray, and, rarely, weak red. Unit II comprises diatom ooze with minor amounts of diatom silt and mixed and volcaniclastic sediment from the Pliocene. Unit II differs from Unit I in having significantly more diatom ooze, less interbedded diatom silt, and fewer laminated intervals. A layer of gravel was recov­ ered at 380 m CSF from Hole U1340A. This is directly below an interval of frequent deposition of gravel-sized clasts at \~220–360 m CSF. This gravel-rich interval overlaps the base of Unit I and the top of Unit II. Unit III, which is further divided into Sub­ units IIIA and IIIB, comprises diatom-bearing, sponge-spicule-rich ashy sand; spongespicule-rich diatom ooze; diatom ooze; and minor amounts of volcaniclastic and sili­ ciclastic sediment from the Pliocene in age.

The increase occurred at \~260 m CSF, dated to around 2.6 Ma, and may re­ flect an increase in sea ice- or glacial ice-rafted debris delivered to the site after the on­ set of large glacial–interglacial cycles. The rounded shape of many of the gravel-sized grains suggests that their source was a coastal environment and therefore favors the hypothesis that they were deposited as a consequence of sea ice rafting. Relatively large clasts interpreted as dropstones were observed most frequently between 360 and 220 m CSF (\~3.6–1.8 Ma), and their occurrence overlaps with the onset of increased siliciclastic components, coeval with a subtle increase in GRA. This may reflect the onset of NHG after 3.6 Ma (Mudelsee and Raymo, 2005). The occurrence of extensive intervals with soft-sediment deformation related to slumping is somewhat unex­ pected because the slope of Bowers Ridge is only slightly inclined at the drill sites. An alternative explanation for the triggering of sediment mass movements could be the seismogenic activity of Bowers Ridge, which is representing a buried subduction zone and is relatively close to the volcanic Aleutian arc.

This appearance of the same sedimentary interval at different subseafloor depths as well as the replication of a section within a single hole is con­ sistent with visual evidence for tilted beds and nonconformable surfaces. We suggest that sediment deformation has produced thickened and noncorrelative intervals in the depth interval from \~20 to \~45 m CCSF-A in Holes U1340B and U1340C and per­ haps also in Holes U1340A and U1340D. We are not confident that the full sedimen­ tary sequence is represented in the composite splice. We tentatively splice Core 323- U1340B-4H as the bottom interval of the splice, which includes the least disturbed intervals through the interval of inferred slumping. Affine growth factors in the spliced interval have values of 1.14 in Hole U1340A and 1.18 in Hole U1340B, which are within the normal range typical of many drill sites.

Porosity measurements decrease to \~75% at the base of Hole U1340A at \~604 m CSF (Fig. F22).

Previous DSDP coring (Site 188) and other piston core studies in the region documented relatively high sedimen­ tation rates of 100–138 m/m.y., respectively, and the presence of appropriate micro­ fossils for paleoceanographic studies. Bowers Ridge is well situated to allow study of the past extent of water mass exchange with the Pacific Ocean through the adjacent Aleutian passes such as Amukta, Amchitka, and Buldir passes. In particular, its loca­ tion allows for examination of the influence of the warm Alaskan Stream water mass entry into this region and presumable impact the distribution of past sea ice coverage. Although the productivity in the Bering Sea in general is very high with respect to other parts of the global oceans (Takahashi et al., 2002), the expected productivity at this site is lower than at Site U1339, which experienced substantially greater influence from the adjacent Bering shelf, which was subaerially exposed during the glacial low sea level stands. Drilling at this site—located at a relatively deep water depth of 2177 m—provides us with past intermediate water conditions, including chemical compo­ sitions. For example, this site is located just below the modern dissolved OMZ, which causes the formation of laminated sediments. Slight fluctuations in the intensity or depth of the OMZ should be captured by proxy records of past oxygenation measured at this site and compared to other, shallower sites.

Hole U1341B,reached,604.5 m CSF,Lithostratigraphy,"Three holes were drilled at Site U1341; the deepest, Hole U1341B, reached 604.5 m CSF. The sediments recovered are a mix of biogenic and siliciclastic sediments, whereas volcaniclastic material was of minor importance, perhaps reflecting the more distal location of Site U1341 to the Aleutian arc. The most abundant terrigenous grain types are silt-sized feldspar, quartz, clay, mica, and rock fragments. Some pebbles are composed of basalt, pumice, or scoria, indicating a volcanic source. Dolostones and micrometer-scale crystals of dolomite occur in high concentrations at various depths but particularly at the bottom of Hole U1341B. Authigenic carbonate patches, nod­ ules, and layers are light olive-gray and olive-gray and often characterized by a gran­ ular texture and a stronger induration than the surrounding sediments. Because of the presence of authigenic carbonates, carbonate-stable isotope measurements in sed­ iments from this and other sites where authigenic carbonates occur are potentially contaminated by the isotopic signature of the overgrowths. However, the presence of authigenic carbonates can be detected and screened out of the isotopic records. Sedi­ ment composed of siliciclastic sediment or mixed lithologies tends to be very dark greenish gray to dark gray, whereas diatom ooze tends to be dark gray to olive-gray to light olive. Boundaries between different sediment colors and/or lithologies are dom­ inantly gradational and bioturbated, but occasional sharp contacts occur as well. Sharp contacts are occasionally coeval with distinct changes in magnetic susceptibil­ ity, with higher values corresponding to mixed biogenic-siliciclastic sediments and lower values corresponding to diatom ooze. Intervals with thin, distinct parallel lam­ inations were relatively rare and confined to the upper part of the record (0–20 m CSF). At lower depths, thickly laminated to thinly bedded material with wavy bound­ aries occurred more frequently.

Authigenic carbonate patches, nod­ ules, and layers are light olive-gray and olive-gray and often characterized by a gran­ ular texture and a stronger induration than the surrounding sediments. Because of the presence of authigenic carbonates, carbonate-stable isotope measurements in sed­ iments from this and other sites where authigenic carbonates occur are potentially contaminated by the isotopic signature of the overgrowths. However, the presence of authigenic carbonates can be detected and screened out of the isotopic records.

Several peaks in gamma radiation can be observed in this unit as well, again generally due to higher uranium content and often associated with authigenic carbonate observed in the core.

It coincides mostly with lithologic Unit I, which con­ sists of diatom ooze and diatom silt. Most of the peaks in gamma radiation are related to high uranium content. The coincidence of these higher uranium values with higher resistivity, and to some extent with higher density, is an indication that they are due to authigenic carbonate, which was observed at many of these depths.

Additionally, small in­ creases in Mn concentration might indicate microbial Mn reduction as a further mineralization pathway. It is more likely, however, that dissolved Mn is released dur­ ing reaction of hydrogen sulfide with Fe/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides. Comparison with Site U1341, also located on Bowers Ridge, reveals that the present site has one order of magnitude lower NH4+ concentrations and \~50% lower phosphate concentrations. This highlights the extremely low mineralization rates at Site U1342 despite its shal­ lower depth and the similar TOC at both sites. The low extent of anaerobic carbon mineralization at the present site can be attributed to the extremely low sedimenta­ tion rates. Very low sedimentation rates probably prolong the time that organic mat­ ter is degraded via oxic respiration and nitrate reduction in the oxic/suboxic sediment zone. This leaves rather refractory organic material, which is only inefficiently de­ graded during anaerobic carbon mineralization (Hulthe et al., 1998).",60,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

Site U1343,is in,the Green Belt,Background and objectives,"Site U1343 is in the area of high biological productivity called the Green Belt. The Green Belt is formed by the Bering Slope Current (BSC), which originates from the Alaskan Stream water that flows into the Bering Sea through the western Aleutian Is­ lands. The water that enters the Bering Sea moves eastward along the Aleutian Islands and consequently encounters the Bering shelf. The base of the BSC is at \~300 m water depth and its flow is forced to turn to the northwest once it meets the slope and shelf; eddies and instabilities in its flow cause upwelling along the shelf break. Moreover, tidal mixing causes further vertical mixing of the water masses along the BSC, en­ hancing biological productivity within the Green Belt, which is adjacent to the north­ west-trending shelf break where high primary productivity in the surface waters and high organic carbon accumulation at the seafloor take place. Because of the expected high organic carbon supply to the seafloor, especially during the interglacial sea level highstands, it is possible the OMZ previously expanded down to the depth of this site. In order to compare the vertical extent of water mass conditions across the basin and relate the OMZ to paleoproductivity, the records from the shallower drill sites on Bowers Ridge (Site U1340, water depth = 1295 m; Site U1342, water depth = 818 m) as well as the other slope sites will be used.

To do so, the drilled sediments in the gateway region were used to determine subseafloor cell abundance and to investigate the link between the mass and characteristics of subseafloor microbes and the extent of export productivity from the surface ocean.",64,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

Unlike Site U1339, drilled on the slope at Umnak Plateau, volcaniclastic material is only a minor component of sedi­ ment at Site U1343 because it is more distant from the Aleutian arc. There is a shallow SMTZ and abundant methane in the sediment column at Site U1343, like at the other slope sites. Benthic and planktonic foraminifers encrusted with yellow minerals are common, and they often coincide with samples in which authigenic carbonates are found. Association of authigenic carbonates and apparent overgrowths implies that authigenic carbonates nucleated on the foraminifer tests. In this case the stable iso­ tope records from this site are potentially contaminated by the isotopic signature of the overgrowths; however, pristine foraminifer shells were also observed, and the gen­ eration of uncontaminated isotope stratigraphies should be possible after careful screening for authigenic carbonates.",64,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report
composite age model,derived from,all five holes,Biostratigraphy,"The composite age model derived from all five holes shows that the sediment record recovered at Site U1343 spans the last 2.0–2.4 m.y., yielding a broadly linear trend in sedimentation rates, with values around 26 cm/k.y. in the uppermost 400 m CCSF-A that increase to \~56 cm/k.y. in the bottom 350 m CCSF-A. Siliceous, calcareous, and organic fossils show the greatest abundances in the uppermost 300–250 m CCSF-A relative to the section below.

All major microfossil groups show distinct changes, occurring gradually or abruptly between 200 and 300 m CCSF-A (0.8 to 1.1 Ma), in their general trend of abundances and/or assemblage composition. These changes are thus linked to the MPT. Benthic foramin­ ifers indicate high-frequency changes in bottom water oxygen content over the entire sequence, probably related primarily to surface water productivity, but possibly also to bottom water ventilation changes and methane seeps.

In the uppermost 250 m CSF changes in dinoflagellate assemblages are observed, indicating surface wa­ ter conditions that vary from high productivity and upwelling to conditions with pronounced sea ice cover.

Uppermost 250 m CSF,indicates,surface water conditions that vary from high productivity and upwelling to conditions with pronounced sea ice cover,Biostratigraphy,"The LO datum of diatom Proboscia curvirostris (0.3 Ma) and the LO datum of Thalassi­ osira jouseae (0.3 Ma) were observed at \~70–77 m CSF in three holes at Site U1343. This is consistent with results from Site U1339 at Umnak Plateau. The cored interval above the LO of P. curvirostris (0.3 Ma) is assigned to Neodenticula seminae Zone NPD12. The interval between the LCO datum of Actinocyclus oculatus observed at 296.4 m CSF and the LO datum of P. curvirostris at 69.4 m CSF in Hole U1343E is assigned to P. curviro­ stris Zone NPD11. The interval below this datum above the FO of Neodenticula koi­ zumii is A. oculatus Zone NPD10. The FO of P. curvirostris (1.85 ± 0.1 Ma) was defined in Sample 323-U1343E-50X-CC and assigned to the age in the A. oculatus Zone. The LO of Pyxidicula horridus (1.9–2.0 Ma) was estimated in Core 323-U1343E-61X. The LCO of N. koizumii (2.1 Ma) was observed in Sample 323-U1342E-77X-CC. The interval between this datum and the bottom of Hole U1343E is assigned to N. koizumii Zone NPD9. The LO of silicoflagellate Distephanus octonarius (0.2–0.3 Ma) is estimated to be between 64.0 and 74.9 m CSF. The LO of Dictyocha subarctios (0.6–0.8 Ma) is es­ timated to be between 196.2 and 205.35 m CSF (Hole U1343C) and between 196.1 and 205.45 m CSF (Hole U1343E). The bottom age in Hole U1343E is younger than 2.5 Ma because of the absence of ebridian Ebriopsis antiqua antiqua. In Sample 323- U1343E-27H-CC relatively warm water taxa belonging to Dictyocha spp. are observed in high numbers (30%), indicating a possible increase of subarctic Pacific water entry into the Bering Sea.

The pore water profiles suggest that rates of net consumption of PO43– are highest between 180 and 200 m CSF and net DIC consumption is highest between 300 and 350 m CSF.",67,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report
pore water chloride concentrations,decrease,with depth,Geochemistry,"The decrease in salinity and pore water chloride concentrations indicate freshening of the pore fluids with depth. A possible explanation for this trend is the dissociation of gas hydrates during core recovery, which releases fresh water and causes depletions in dissolved ion concentrations. Alternatively, decreases in pore water salinity and chloride concentrations can result from meteoric water input, clay membrane ion fil­ tration, and clay mineral dehydration.",67,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

A synthetic seismogram was produced using a wavelet ex­ tracted from the seafloor reflection in traces adjacent to Shotpoint 350 and Site U1343 in Line Stk-1. Although we speculated this reflector might be a BSR, indicating the ex­ istence of gas hydrate overlying free gas, no conclusive indication from the logs sup­ ported the occurrence of gas hydrate. However, slightly higher velocity and resistivity trends and lower dipole waveform amplitudes above the reflector, as well as low chlo­ rinity values measured on several interstitial water samples, suggest that some amount of gas hydrate might be present. Logging Unit 2 (330–510 m WMSF) is de­ fined by slightly decreasing trends with depth in resistivity and by gamma ray values slightly higher than the shallower and deeper units. The top of logging Unit 3 (510– 745 m WMSF) is defined by a drop in gamma radiation, an increase in VP, and a change in the trends of all the logs. The gamma ray, potassium, thorium, density, re­ sistivity, VP, and VS logs all display higher amplitude and lower frequency variability than in the upper units, suggesting a significant change in the deposition history and rates.

However, slightly higher velocity and resistivity trends and lower dipole waveform amplitudes above the reflector, as well as low chlo­ rinity values measured on several interstitial water samples, suggest that some amount of gas hydrate might be present.

BSC,has bottom depth,~300 m,Background and objectives,"This is also the area of high biological productivity called the Green Belt. The Green Belt is formed by the BSC, which originates from the Alaskan Stream water that flows into the Bering Sea through the western Aleutian Islands. The water that enters the Bering Sea moves eastward along the Aleutian Islands and consequently encounters the shallow blocking Bering shelf. The bottom depth of the BSC is at \~300 m, and its flow is forced to turn to the northwest once it meets the slope and shelf; eddies and instabilities in its flow cause upwelling along the shelf break. Moreover, tidal mixing causes further vertical mixing of the water masses along the BSC, enhancing biologi­ cal productivity within the Green Belt (Taniguchi, 1984; Springer et al., 1996), a zone adjacent to the northwest-trending shelf break where high primary productivity in the surface waters and high organic carbon accumulation at the seafloor take place (Springer et al., 1996). However, we anticipated finding a lower organic carbon supply to the seafloor than at the other gateway sites or at Site U1339 because of the deeper water depth of Site U1344. Thus, expectation of the impingement by the dissolved OMZ in the past is relatively small at this site.

However, Site U1344 is distinct in that it has an even higher proportion of siliciclastic components and a higher occur­ rence of sand-sized grains than Site U1343.

Similar to Site U1343, profiles of CH4 and SO42– at Site U1344 suggest that sulfate reduction is largely driven by CH4 diffusion into the sulfate zone. The CH4 flux into the SO42– zone, as calculated from the concentration gradient between 8 and 13 m CSF, is \~70%–80% of the SO42– flux into the SMTZ. The impor­ tance of AOM for overall carbon turnover is also stressed by the curvature in the DIC profile. The steepest concentration gradient in the uppermost 10 m CSF is observed directly above the SMTZ, suggesting that the highest DIC flux occurs from this zone. Preliminary modeling of the DIC profile suggests that net DIC production in the SMTZ accounts for 80% of the DIC production in the uppermost 30 m CSF of sedi­ ment. Hydrogen sulfide is also at a maximum in the SMTZ, most likely because sulfate reduction rates are the highest and the content of oxidized iron is the lowest in this zone.

AOM,favor,deposition of carbonates in the SMTZ,Geochemistry,"AOM is well known to favor the deposition of carbonates in the SMTZ. At Site U1344 a relatively high flux of Ca2+ into the SMTZ is observed, which indicates the formation of calcium carbonate. There were also indications for Mg2+ flux into the SMTZ, which may suggest dolomite formation. The curvature of the NH4+ profile suggests produc­ tion from organic matter degradation throughout the sediment column. Microbialmediated degradation is either conducted via a respiratory or fermentative pathway. According to the classical reduction scheme in sediments, only fermentation and hy­ drogenotrophic methanogenesis occur below the SMTZ; however, at this site the Fe profile suggests that Fe reduction occurs below the SMTZ. Organic matter degradation also leads to the accumulation of DIC and PO43– in the interstitial water. The accumu­ lation of these species, however, is much lower than that predicted by the NH4+ pro­ file, assuming steady state and a constant ratio between C, N, and P of remineralized organic matter. This suggests both production and consumption of DIC and PO43– in the sediment. Consumption of these species is most likely due to formation of apatite and calcium carbonates (e.g., dolomite). The interstitial water profiles suggest that rates of net consumption of PO43– and DIC are the highest between 300 and 350 m CSF.

the caliper of the density sonde,shows,an irregular borehole,Downhole measurements,"Two tool strings were deployed in Hole U1344A: the triple combo and the FMS-sonic combination. Overall, the caliper of the density sonde shows an irregular borehole with a particularly large-diameter interval between 170 and 260 m WSF but with very good conditions in the lower section. Deeper in the borehole, small enlargements reg­ ularly spaced every \~9.5 m indicate where the bit was sitting whenever a core was re­ covered. However, all the calipers show that the tools made at least partial contact with the formation over most of the interval logged, suggesting that the overall qual­ ity of the data is good. Irregular hole size has an effect on measurements that require good contact with the formation, namely density and porosity. The anomalously low density values between 230 and 250 m WSF within the 100 m interval with the largest hole size are probably erroneous, as are most neutron porosity measurements in this entire interval. The quality of the logs can also be assessed by comparison with the NGR and GRA track data and with the MAD measurements made on cores recovered from Hole U1344A. Except for two short intervals with lower density logging data (230–250 and 420–430 m WSF), all density data sets are in good agreement, confirm­ ing overall good data quality despite the enlarged hole.

Site U1345,is located,"on an interfluve ridge near the large, broad head of Navarin submarine channel off the Bering Sea shelf",Background and objectives,"The primary objective of drilling at Site U1345 (prospectus Site NAV-1B) was to study high-resolution Holocene–late Pleistocene paleoceanography at a proximal gateway location to the Arctic Ocean at a water depth of \~1008 m. The drill site is located on an interfluve ridge near the large, broad head of Navarin submarine channel off the Bering Sea shelf (Figs. F1, F59, F60, F61, F62) (Normark and Carlson, 2003). We an­ ticipated that this site received an ample supply of terrigenous sediments from the shelf during the glacials. This is also in the area of high biological productivity called the Green Belt. The Green Belt is formed by the BSC, which originates in the incom­ ing Alaskan Stream water that flows through the western Aleutians into the Bering Sea (Taniguchi, 1984; Springer et al., 1996). Farther northwest, higher primary productiv­ ity and organic carbon is observed at the seafloor (Springer et al., 1996). Thus, past impingement by the dissolved OMZ was highly expected at this site. Because the ex­ pected sedimentation rates were high with intermittently laminated sediment of mil­ limeter to submillimeter thickness (see below), we expected to be able to reconstruct detailed climate change of submillennial timescales. Therefore, we anticipated com­ paring data from this site with those of other pertinent high-resolution records from such places as the Santa Barbara Basin, the Cariaco Basin, and GISP2. It is also impor­ tant to compare the vertical extent of water mass conditions on a basin-wide scale that includes the Bowers Ridge, gateway, and Umnak sites.",80,Expedition 323 Preliminary Report

APC coring was terminated after Core 323-U1340A-42H after two successive short, incomplete strokes of the core barrel. The XCB coring system was then deployed at Core 323-U1340A-43X and coring continued with the XCB system until Core 62X. After three straight zero-recovery runs, the APC coring system was re­ deployed. Coring with the APC system through Core 323-U1340A-67H was successful in recovering \~25 m of very sandy sediment. The XCB system was redeployed and the hole was terminated after Core 323-U1340A-71X when the XCB cutting shoe spacer sub failed, leaving a portion of the sub and the XCB cutting shoe at the bottom of the hole. The drill string was pulled back to the seafloor at 2103 h on 25 July 2009, offi­ cially ending the hole. Shear pressures were consistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. Recovery for Hole U1340A using the APC coring system was 105.0% with 398.8 m recovered. Recovery for Hole U1340A using the XCB coring system was 61.0% with 136.7 m recovered.

Hole U1342A,cored using,APC system to refusal,Site U1342,"Four holes were drilled at this site. The first was cored using the APC system to refusal. When refusal was met early, the XCB system was deployed to confirm formation ma­ terial. The XCB recovered 0.5 m of basalt, effectively ending Hole U1342A. The sec­ ond hole, U1342B, was dedicated to microbiology. Hole U1342C was cored with the APC system to 45.4 m DSF. The last hole, U1342D, was APC cored to 44.0 m DSF. At that point, a center bit was dropped and the hole was drilled ahead for 18.6 m to de­ termine if the basalt was continuous or not. At a drilling break, the XCB system was deployed and used to take 13 cores of hard rock to the total hole depth of 127.4 m DSF. A complete set of site-specific tide tables was provided by the science party for Site U1342.
