Expedition 320/321,designed to,recover a continuous Cenozoic record of the paleoequatorial Pacific,Abstract,"Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 320/321, Pacific Equatorial Age Transect (Sites U1331–U1338), was designed to recover a continuous Cenozoic re­ cord of the paleoequatorial Pacific by coring above the paleoposition of the Equator at successive crustal ages on the Pacific plate. These sediments record the evolution of the paleoequatorial climate system throughout the Cenozoic. As we gained more in­ formation about the past movement of plates and when in Earth’s history critical climate events took place, it became possible to drill an age transect (flow line) along the position of the paleoequator in the Pacific, targeting important time slices where the sedimentary archive allows us to reconstruct past climatic and tectonic conditions. The Pacific Equatorial Age Transect (PEAT) program cored eight sites from the sediment surface to at or near basement, with basalt aged between 53 and 16 Ma, covering the time period following maximum Cenozoic warmth, through initial ma­ jor glaciations, to today. The PEAT program allows the reconstruction of extreme changes of the calcium carbonate compensation depth (CCD) across major geological boundaries during the last 53 m.y. A very shallow CCD during most of the Paleogene makes it difficult to obtain well-preserved carbonate sediments during these strati­ graphic intervals, but we recovered a unique sedimentary biogenic sediment archive for time periods just after the Paleocene/Eocene boundary event, the Eocene cooling, the Eocene–Oligocene transition, the one cold pole Oligocene, the Oligocene–Mio­ cene transition, and the middle Miocene cooling. Together with older Deep Sea Drill­ ing Project and Ocean Drilling Program drilling in the equatorial Pacific, we can also delineate the position of the paleoequator and variations in sediment thickness from \~150°W to 110°W longitude.",1,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report

Pacific Ocean,is,world’s largest ocean,Introduction,"As the world’s largest ocean, the Pacific Ocean is intricately linked to major changes in the global climate system that took place during the Cenozoic. Throughout the Ce­ nozoic, Pacific plate motion has had a northward component. The Pacific Ocean is unique in that the thick sediment bulge of biogenic-rich deposits from the currently narrow equatorial upwelling zone is slowly moving away from the Equator. Hence, older sections are not deeply buried and can be recovered by drilling. Previous Legs 138 and 199 were remarkably successful in giving us new insights into the workings of the climate and carbon system, productivity changes across the zone of divergence, time-dependent calcium carbonate dissolution, an integrated astronomically age-cal­ ibrated bio- and magnetostratigraphy, the location of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), and evolutionary patterns for times of climatic change and upheaval.

equatorial surface ocean,is linked to,trade wind system,Background,"The circulation of the equatorial surface ocean is inescapably linked to the trade wind system. The equatorial Pacific is the classic world ocean example of this linkage. It is dominated by wind-driven circulation and is largely unfettered by ocean boundar­ ies. Here, the Equator itself is characterized by a narrow zone of divergence that results from the change in the sign of the Coriolis effect and gives rise to a band of high bi­ ologic productivity (Fig. F6). The strength of the equatorial circulation and of this di­ vergence is linked to the strength of the trade winds, which are in turn strongly tied to the global climate system. Variations in global climate, interhemispheric differ­ ences in temperature gradients, and marked changes in the ocean boundaries are all imprinted on the biogenic-rich sediments that are accumulating in the equatorial zone. The PEAT program was designed to provide an understanding of equatorial Pa­ cific circulation, carbonate production, deposition, and dissolution for the last \~53 m.y. at a scale where orbital forcing can be resolved. Combined with seismic reflection data (Lyle et al., 2006, 2002) following in the vein of Mitchell et al.

reconstruction of equatorial Pacific history,is combined with,seismic reflection data,Background,"The circulation of the equatorial surface ocean is inescapably linked to the trade wind system. The equatorial Pacific is the classic world ocean example of this linkage. It is dominated by wind-driven circulation and is largely unfettered by ocean boundar­ ies. Here, the Equator itself is characterized by a narrow zone of divergence that results from the change in the sign of the Coriolis effect and gives rise to a band of high bi­ ologic productivity (Fig. F6). The strength of the equatorial circulation and of this di­ vergence is linked to the strength of the trade winds, which are in turn strongly tied to the global climate system. Variations in global climate, interhemispheric differ­ ences in temperature gradients, and marked changes in the ocean boundaries are all imprinted on the biogenic-rich sediments that are accumulating in the equatorial zone.

northward movement,transports,equatorial sediments out from under the zone of highest sediment delivery,Background,"Deciphering the sedimentary history of the equatorial Pacific has been greatly simpli­ fied by favorable motion of the Pacific plate. Throughout the Cenozoic, the move­ ment of the Pacific plate has had a northward latitudinal component of \~0.25°/m.y. This northward movement transports equatorial sediments gradually out from under the zone of highest sediment delivery, resulting in a broad mound of biogenic sedi­ ments (Fig. F8). This transport prevents the older equatorial sections from being bur­ ied deeply beneath the younger sections as the crust moves northward. The diminished overburden resulting from this transport allows relatively good preserva­ tion of biogenic sediments and minimizes burial diagenesis. In addition, it allows us to core nearly all sections using the advanced piston corer (APC). The northward tec­ tonic displacement, however, is not so large that a traverse of the equatorial zone (within 2° latitude of the Equator) was too rapid to record a reasonable period of equa­ torial ocean history. Drill sites typically remain within the equatorial zone for 10–20 m.y. before passing beyond the northern edge of high biogenic sedimentation.

Paleocene and Eocene,prevent,deposition of carbonate except on crust at relatively shallow depths,Background,"During the Paleocene and Eocene, the shallow CCD prevented deposition of carbon­ ate except on crust at relatively shallow depths. Drilling near the paleoposition of the ridge crest at the critical time interval allows the recovery of the shallowest sections available in the pelagic oceans and thereby assures the best possible preservation of the carbonate sediments recovered. As the crust cools and sinks, the seafloor on which the sediments are deposited approaches the lysocline and CCD. Thus, the best preserved part of the sections recovered in such time line transects is restricted by the depth at which carbonate dissolution significantly increases, as well as by the northward movement of sediment sections out of the region of high equatorial pro­ ductivity. This limitation was exemplified by the results from ODP Leg 199, which re­ covered only limited amounts of carbonate prior to the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (e.g., at ODP Site 1218 on 42 Ma crust).",6,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report

equatorial upwelling zone,controls,atmospheric CO2 levels,"Understanding the interplay between the CCD, CaCO3 dissolution, and productivity","The Pacific Ocean, specifically the equatorial upwelling zone, is the largest oceanic source of CO2 to the atmosphere and controls atmospheric CO2 levels (Dore et al., 2003). The release and uptake of CO2 is the direct consequence of calcium carbonate deposition and the interplay between nutrient supply, carbonate dissolution, surface water productivity, and export of biogenic carbonate from surface waters to the sedi­ ment pile. Distinguishing between the effects of carbonate dissolution and productiv­ ity has been a field of intense study in the past. An important objective of the PEAT program is to address the detailed workings of depth-dependent carbonate dissolu­ tion, which is intricately linked to the climate system and paleoceanography. In the standard model for carbonate dissolution, accumulation rates locally decrease lin­ early from a lysocline down to a CCD, reflecting a linearly increasing rate of dissolu­ tion. The depth of both of these mappable surfaces varies spatially and in time as a result of climatic and physical processes. The equatorial Pacific is one of the classic areas where the lysocline-CCD model was first developed, but little subsequent effort had been made to test it—a necessary step, considering that the functional form of dissolution is now known to depend in a more complex way on organic carbon burial and water mass properties.

shallowly buried carbonate sediments,contribute to,separating the various processes that affect carbonate deposition and preservation,"Understanding the interplay between the CCD, CaCO3 dissolution, and productivity","Specifically, the recovery of shallowly buried carbonate sediments from near the pa­ leoequatorial upwelling zone will contribute significantly toward separating the var­ ious processes that affect carbonate deposition and preservation and will reduce some of the processes that affect climatic proxy records, such as diagenetic recrystallization (Pearson et al., 2001). Neogene productivity has been strongly oriented parallel to the Equator, so differences in carbonate thicknesses at a common latitude but differing depths will permit the effect of dissolution to be isolated (Lyle, 2003; Mitchell et al., 2003; Mitchell and Lyle, 2005). In addition, the strategy adopted in this program will provide new data throughout the Cenozoic with which it will be possible to map the spatial evolution of the equatorial CCD with time (see Results and highlights) be­ cause the northward component of the Pacific plate movement results in the multiple recovery of the same time slice in different sites but with a slightly different paleolat­ itude (Fig. F3).",7,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report

Results from Leg 199 demonstrate that these records can be recovered from near-equatorial carbonate sediments (e.g., Lanci et al., 2004, 2005). Almost all magnetic reversals from the Paleogene through the pres­ ent were recovered during Leg 199. However, neither biogenic carbonate sediments through most of the Eocene nor for ages younger than the lower Miocene were recov­ ered during Leg 199. Thus, although the paleomagnetic record during these times was of high quality, global stratigraphic correlation is hindered by the lower mass accu­ mulation rate, the absence of a detailed isotope stratigraphy, and sparser biostrati­ graphic control. In order to facilitate the development of an integrated magneto- and biostratigraphic framework with a stable isotope stratigraphy (necessary to enable global correlation), recovery of magnetic reversals within carbonate sediment is desir­ able. In addition, further detailed paleomagnetic, magnetostratigrapic, and magnetic rock fabric data, most importantly from the Eocene, will help resolve the suggestion that the geographic Equator, as determined from the biogenic sediment bulge, might not coincide with the paleoequator position backtracked with a fixed-hotspot refer­ ence frame (Moore et al., 2004; Tarduno, 2003; Parés and Moore, 2005).",9,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report

Such fluctuations in the CCD are similar in magnitude to those at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary (Coxall et al., 2005). High siliceous sedimentation rates occur near an apparent short reversal in the middle Eocene cooling interval. It is difficult to interpret the cause of such a sub­ stantial change in silica flux during a very warm climatic regime.",1,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report

This inter­ val of time is noted for its markedly heavy benthic oxygen isotopes (Fig. F2) and its relatively deep CCD (Fig. F3). There was probably ice on Antarctica during this inter­ val, but not the large ice sheets found there later in the middle Miocene. There is no compelling evidence for ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere during the Oligocene and early Miocene. Thus, there was apparently a time of low global ice volume, cold bottom waters, a cold South Pole, and a relatively warm North Pole.

PEAT program,was,to detail the nature and changes of the CCD throughout the Cenozoic in the paleoequatorial Pacific,Cenozoic CCD in the equatorial Pacific,"One of the primary objectives of the PEAT program was to detail the nature and changes of the CCD throughout the Cenozoic in the paleoequatorial Pacific (Objec­ tive 1 in Scientific objectives), with potential links to organic matter deposition (Olivarez Lyle and Lyle, 2005). The choice of drilling locations, targeting positions on the paleoequator to track carbonate preservation during crustal subsidence through­ out time (Fig. F14), followed the initial work on DSDP sites by van Andel (1975). This first reconstruction of the Cenozoic CCD was augmented by additional results from Leg 199 (Lyle, Wilson, Janecek, et al., 2002; Rea and Lyle, 2005). One of the significant contributions of Leg 199 drilling was the latitudinal mapping of CCD variations with time. During the Eocene, a generally shallow CCD appeared to be deeper outside the zone ±4° from the equator, opposite to the pattern established during the Neogene (Lyle, 2003). The PEAT cores will allow us to refine our knowledge of temporal and spatial variation in sediment accumulation rates resulting from plate movement, varying biologic productivity at the equatorial divergence, and carbonate preserva­ tion (Fig. F14). The shipboard sampling program allowed for &gt;1000 determinations of CaCO3 concentrations, approximately one every section from one hole of each site. Shipboard results reveal the carbonate accumulation events of Lyle et al. (2005) as sharp carbonate concentration fluctuations at \~44, 41, 39, and 36 Ma across Sites U1331–U1334 and 1218, followed by a sharp transition into much higher carbonate accumulation rates from the Eocene into the Oligocene. Results from Expedition 320 reveal a complex latitudinal pattern where Sites U1331, U1332, and U1334 track the equatorial CCD that matches well the signal observed from Site 1218, but Site U1333, which is slightly north of the equatorial zone during the Eocene–Oligocene transi­ tion, shows significantly more carbonate accumulation.",20,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report

One of the significant contributions of Leg 199 drilling was the latitudinal mapping of CCD variations with time. During the Eocene, a generally shallow CCD appeared to be deeper outside the zone ±4° from the equator, opposite to the pattern established during the Neogene (Lyle, 2003). The PEAT cores will allow us to refine our knowledge of temporal and spatial variation in sediment accumulation rates resulting from plate movement, varying biologic productivity at the equatorial divergence, and carbonate preserva­ tion (Fig. F14). The shipboard sampling program allowed for &gt;1000 determinations of CaCO3 concentrations, approximately one every section from one hole of each site. Shipboard results reveal the carbonate accumulation events of Lyle et al. (2005) as sharp carbonate concentration fluctuations at \~44, 41, 39, and 36 Ma across Sites U1331–U1334 and 1218, followed by a sharp transition into much higher carbonate accumulation rates from the Eocene into the Oligocene. Results from Expedition 320 reveal a complex latitudinal pattern where Sites U1331, U1332, and U1334 track the equatorial CCD that matches well the signal observed from Site 1218, but Site U1333, which is slightly north of the equatorial zone during the Eocene–Oligocene transi­ tion, shows significantly more carbonate accumulation.",20,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report

Figure F19 demon­ strates that a Cenozoic megasplice can be constructed from the material recovered and spliced onto previous Leg 138 and 199 sites. Physical property data that proxy calcium carbonate oscillations at Sites U1331 and U1332 show a remarkable match with those from Site 1220, which also has an excellent magnetostratigraphy. Simi­ larly, Sites U1333 and U1334 can be spliced to Site 1218, providing a coherent and integrated record of large-scale Pacific sedimentation patterns of biogenic material from the Eocene through the Miocene and younger (Fig. F20). Such stratigraphic cor­ relation makes possible the study of sedimentation patterns and mass accumulation rates at orbital resolution.

Sites U1331–U1334,capture,lithostratigraphy of the Eocene–Oligocene transition in the equatorial Pacific Ocean,Lithology,"Sites U1331–U1334 capture the lithostratigraphy of the Eocene–Oligocene transition in the equatorial Pacific Ocean in a depth transect from \~3600 to 4300 m paleowater depth (\~34 Ma) (Fig. F25). At each site, a downhole transition takes place from white to pale brown nannofossil ooze of earliest Oligocene age to much darker brown sedi­ ments of Eocene age. At the deep end of the depth transect where the Eocene–Oligo­ cene transition is least expanded (Site U1331), the transition is sharp (over a \~5 cm thick interval) into homogeneous dark brown clayey radiolarian ooze.

Oligocene/Miocene boundary,difficult to pick using,microfossil biostratigraphies,Oligocene–Miocene transition,"At the end of the Oligocene a significant multimillion year–long rise in the oxygen isotope record (Lear et al., 2004) is closely followed by a relatively short, sharp in­ crease in oxygen isotope values that has been interpreted as a major glacial episode (Mi-1) (Zachos et al., 1997, 2001a, 2001b; Pälike et al., 2006a, 2006b) and correlated to a pronounced drop in sea level (Miller et al., 1991). This event is very close to the Oligocene/Miocene boundary and has now been astronomically age calibrated in sev­ eral ocean basins (Shackleton et al., 2000; Billups et al., 2004; Pälike et al., 2006a). Al­ though there are clear periodic isotopic signals indicating major changes in ice volume, ocean temperatures, and/or ocean structure, this biostratigraphic boundary has always been somewhat of an enigma. Unlike the major changes in the isotopic stratigraphy, the biostratigraphies of the planktonic microfossils show very little change across this boundary. In fact, it is one of the most difficult epoch boundaries to pick using solely microfossil biostratigraphies.",2,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report
carbonate preservation,presented a problem for,foraminifer stratigraphy,Oligocene–Miocene transition,"At Sites 1218 and 1219 this interval was well recovered; however, carbonate preserva­ tion still presented a problem for foraminifer stratigraphy. Both sites were deep and well within the lysocline, making the application of temperature proxies such as Mg/ Ca ratios in foraminifer tests more difficult (Lear et al., 2008). At the time Miocene– Oligocene sediments were deposited, Site 1218 already resided on 18 m.y. old crust and was \~4.1 km deep.

nannofossil oozes,are,backdrop for vivid color changes,Equatorial productivity and redox-related color changes,"Relatively white nannofossil oozes are the backdrop for the vivid color changes ob­ served midsection at Sites U1334–U1336. Sediment color shifts from brown/very pale brown to light greenish gray and white. At each of the three sites, the shift in color is illustrated by a steplike drop in b* reflectance (yellow–blue) and a near complete loss of magnetic susceptibility (Fig. F32). Dissolved Fe concentrations in pore fluids in­ crease at least sixfold in the zone of greenish gray sediments. Dissolved Mn concen­ trations increase at least fivefold in peaks just shallower than the dissolved Fe peaks, consistent with less reducing suboxic diagenesis. The link between sediment color and suboxic diagenesis is clearest at Site U1335, where the light greenish gray color is interrupted by a small interval of very pale brown before returning to greenish gray again. That very pale brown interval corresponds to a pronounced dip in dissolved Fe and a small increase in dissolved Mn. Together with the loss of magnetic properties, increases in dissolved Fe concentrations and changes in sediment color indicate in­ tensified microbial Fe reduction, perhaps fueled by higher organic carbon accumula­ tion rates across this interval. The intensification of suboxia at depth is largely controlled by site location with respect to the core of the equatorial upwelling system (Figs. F6, F32A). The greenish gray coloration is restricted to the time interval when each site was located south of 3°N. This pattern of geographic control on organic mat­ ter deposition and sediment diagenesis is supported by sediment color change obser­ vations in three additional DSDP sites (78, 79, and 574) (Fig. F32B).

Sediment color shifts from brown/very pale brown to light greenish gray and white. At each of the three sites, the shift in color is illustrated by a steplike drop in b* reflectance (yellow–blue) and a near complete loss of magnetic susceptibility (Fig. F32). Dissolved Fe concentrations in pore fluids in­ crease at least sixfold in the zone of greenish gray sediments. Dissolved Mn concen­ trations increase at least fivefold in peaks just shallower than the dissolved Fe peaks, consistent with less reducing suboxic diagenesis. The link between sediment color and suboxic diagenesis is clearest at Site U1335, where the light greenish gray color is interrupted by a small interval of very pale brown before returning to greenish gray again. That very pale brown interval corresponds to a pronounced dip in dissolved Fe and a small increase in dissolved Mn. Together with the loss of magnetic properties, increases in dissolved Fe concentrations and changes in sediment color indicate in­ tensified microbial Fe reduction, perhaps fueled by higher organic carbon accumula­ tion rates across this interval. The intensification of suboxia at depth is largely controlled by site location with respect to the core of the equatorial upwelling system (Figs. F6, F32A). The greenish gray coloration is restricted to the time interval when each site was located south of 3°N. This pattern of geographic control on organic mat­ ter deposition and sediment diagenesis is supported by sediment color change obser­ vations in three additional DSDP sites (78, 79, and 574) (Fig. F32B).

TOC concentrations were determined separately by a difference method and by an acidification method for Site U1331. However, we concluded that the TOC concentrations determined by the nor­ mal difference method might be overestimates in high-percent CaCO3 and very low percent TOC sediments because they were determined as a small difference between two numbers comparable in magnitude. Therefore, TOC analyses were performed only by the acidification method, in which TOC was determined by using carbonatefree sediments after treatment by acidification for Sites U1332–U1335. Using this acidification technique, we reduced the detection limit for TOC measurements to 0.03 wt%. TOC concentrations in sediments determined by this method are very low throughout the sediment column and near or below the detection limit for samples (below 0.04%) from Sites U1331–U1335 (Figs.

Foraminifers,replaced with,microcrystalline quartz and pyrite,Chert and porcellanite occurrence,"Sites U1331–U1333 and U1336 recovered chert and porcellanite (Fig. F40). Cherts are characterized by their hardness and highly silicified matrix in which sediments are cemented with microcrystalline quartz. Primary pore spaces (e.g., within chambers of foraminifers and radiolarians) are sometimes filled with chalcedony. Porcellanites are silicified to a lesser extent and are richer in clay minerals than the cherts. Porcellanite is much more abundant than chert at Sites U1331–U1333, whereas Site U1336 con­ tains mostly chert.

sections recovered,contain,interval where biogenic silica is dissolved and barren of radiolarians,Chert and porcellanite occurrence,"At the base of the sections recovered there was always an interval in which all bio­ genic silica had been dissolved and which was barren of radiolarians. This silica free zone (SFZ) is usually not thick—only 7 to 16 m at most of the sites drilled (Table T2). This is well within the usual 1 to 40 m thickness of the SFZ described by Moore (2008a) for Pacific open-ocean sections recovered by scientific ocean drilling. Moore (2008a) associated this dissolution zone with the circulation of hydrothermal waters in the upper oceanic crust and related the silica removed by this process to the ulti­ mate formation of cherts.

This site shows increased carbonate con­ tent and much increased mass accumulation rates approaching 200 mg CaCO3/cm2/ k.y. around the middle of Magnetochron C18r to the base of C19r during the middle Eocene and can be correlated to an interval of enhanced carbonate burial that was previously documented by Lyle et al.

Radiolarians are common and well preserved in the Eocene succession but less well preserved in the Oligocene sediments. A complete sequence of radiolarian zones from RN2 to RP14 (middle Eocene) was described. Ini­ tial assessment of the radiolarian assemblages across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary interval indicates a significant loss of diversity through this apparently complete suc­ cession.

Shipboard analyses suggest that a useful magnetic signal is preserved in most APCcored intervals after removal of the drilling-induced overprint by partial AF demag­ netization at 20 mT. The overprint was nearly absent in those cores collected in non­ magnetic core barrels at Site U1333, whereas it was quite prominent for cores recovered in standard steel core barrels. Paleomagnetic directions from discrete sam­ ples agree well with those from split cores, confirming that AF demagnetization at 20 mT is generally sufficient to resolve the primary paleomagnetic direction regardless of which type of core barrel was used. Cleaned paleomagnetic data provide a series of distinct \~180° alternations in the declination and subtle changes in inclination, which, when combined with biostratigraphic age constraints, allow a continuous magnetostratigraphy to be constructed that correlates well with the geomagnetic po­ larity timescale. The magnetostratigraphic record extends from the base of Chron C6n (19.722 Ma) at 1.7 m CSF-A in Hole U1333C to the top of Chron C20r (43.789 Ma) at 161.6 m CSF-A in Hole U1333C.

Unlike Sites U1331 and U1332, the drilling overprint was generally weak for Site U1334 cores, but only for those collected with the nonmagnetic core barrel (Cores 320-U1334A-1H through 16H, 320-U1334B-1H through 15H, and 320- U1334C-1H through 15H). In contrast, those cores collected with the steel core bar­ rels are highly overprinted to the extent that the overprint is so severe that even de­ magnetization at 20 mT is only partially able to remove it. This extreme overprint notably degrades the paleomagnetic declination data as can be noted by their higher variability, which makes polarity determination much more difficult in the intervals collected with steel core barrels. The problem is exacerbated by the decay in the in­ tensity (and susceptibility), which occurs at \~135 m CSF-A in all three holes as a result of apparent reduction diagenesis. Even within the highly reduced interval, an inter­ pretable signal was present prior to switching to steel core barrels. Susceptibility in the upper 45 m of Hole U1334A averages \~18 × 10–5 SI (volume normalized) and decreases to a mean of 6 × 10–5 SI from 45 to 135 m CSF-A. A notable low occurs from \~142 to 204 m CSF-A, where the average susceptibility is 0.6 × 10–5 SI. This low interval is as­ sociated with a change in sediment color from yellowish tan to very light green, blue, and gray at \~140 m CSF-A and another abrupt change to reddish brown tones at \~205 m CSF-A, which corresponds to middle early Oligocene (\~30 Ma).

Susceptibility,steps up to,average of 5 × 10–5 SI just below 205 m,Site U1334,"A full range of paleomagnetic analyses was conducted on 66 APC cores and 188 dis­ crete paleomagnetic samples from Site U1334 for the APC-cored section of Site U1334 (upper \~209 m). Unlike Sites U1331 and U1332, the drilling overprint was generally weak for Site U1334 cores, but only for those collected with the nonmagnetic core barrel (Cores 320-U1334A-1H through 16H, 320-U1334B-1H through 15H, and 320- U1334C-1H through 15H). In contrast, those cores collected with the steel core bar­ rels are highly overprinted to the extent that the overprint is so severe that even de­ magnetization at 20 mT is only partially able to remove it. This extreme overprint notably degrades the paleomagnetic declination data as can be noted by their higher variability, which makes polarity determination much more difficult in the intervals collected with steel core barrels. The problem is exacerbated by the decay in the in­ tensity (and susceptibility), which occurs at \~135 m CSF-A in all three holes as a result of apparent reduction diagenesis. Even within the highly reduced interval, an inter­ pretable signal was present prior to switching to steel core barrels. Susceptibility in the upper 45 m of Hole U1334A averages \~18 × 10–5 SI (volume normalized) and decreases to a mean of 6 × 10–5 SI from 45 to 135 m CSF-A. A notable low occurs from \~142 to 204 m CSF-A, where the average susceptibility is 0.6 × 10–5 SI. This low interval is as­ sociated with a change in sediment color from yellowish tan to very light green, blue, and gray at \~140 m CSF-A and another abrupt change to reddish brown tones at \~205 m CSF-A, which corresponds to middle early Oligocene (\~30 Ma).

Site U1335,conducted,paleomagnetic analyses on 78 archive halves and 257 discrete paleomagnetic samples,Site U1335,"A full range of paleomagnetic analyses was conducted on 78 archive halves and 257 discrete paleomagnetic samples from Site U1335 for the APC-cored section (upper \~378 m). The most prominent feature of the records is the magnetic intensity and sus­ ceptibility low that occurs between \~70 and 110 m CSF-A and below \~210 m CSF-A. We could not obtain any reliable paleomagnetic directions from this interval because the magnetic intensity after 20 mT AF demagnetization is in the order of 10–5 A/m, which is comparable to the noise level of the superconducting rock magnetometer. Except for these low magnetic intensity intervals, we found distinct declination rever­ sals at 20 mT demagnetizations. The drilling overprint was generally weak when non­ magnetic core barrels were used (Cores 320-U1335A-1H through 16H and 320- U1335B-1H through 19H). In contrast, those cores collected with the steel core barrels are highly overprinted. Except for the low magnetic intensity interval, the cleaned pa­ leomagnetic data provide a series of distinct \~180° alternations in the declination.

The highlights of the magnetostratigraphy at Site U1335 are the identifications of (1) a previously observed cryptochron (C5Dr-1n) in two holes and (2) 40 potential geomagnetic excursions (10 of which are recorded in both holes).",64,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report
Site U1335,marked by,alkalinities between 2.5 and 4.3 mM throughout,Site U1335,"A standard shipboard suite of geochemical analysis of pore water and organic and in­ organic properties was undertaken on sediments from Site U1335. Site U1335 is marked by alkalinities between 2.5 and 4.3 mM throughout, sulfate concentrations between 23 and 28 mM, and dissolved phosphate concentrations of \~2 µM in the shallowest sample, decreasing to \~0.5 µM in the uppermost \~50 m. The most striking features in the interstitial water geochemistry are three dissolved manganese peaks with concentrations of up to 44, 13, and 5 µM at \~0–40, 50–80, and 150–210 m CSFA, respectively. Dissolved iron also shows three peaks, with concentrations up to 6 µM at \~6 m CSF-A, between 90 and 170 m CSF-A, and between 190 and 370 m CSF-A. Minima in dissolved Fe correspond to elevated Mn concentrations. The alternating pattern of dissolved Mn and Fe correspond well to apparent color changes in the sed­ iment column. Lithium concentrations decrease from \~26 µM at the sediment surface to 5 µM at \~300 m CSF-A, below which Li concentrations increase strongly to \~32 µM. The Sr concentration profile mirrors that of Li, with concentrations ranging between 82 and 250 µM. Sr values increase from the top to 200 m CSF-A, followed by a de­ crease toward basement. Calcium carbonate, IC, and TC concentrations were deter­ mined on sediment samples from Hole U1335A (Fig. F60). CaCO3 concentrations ranged between 13% and 96%. In the uppermost \~67 m, carbonate concentration ranges from 12% to 87%, and concentrations are then consistently high (\~72%–96%) between 67 and 157 m CSF-A and below 222 m CSF-A. Concentrations vary more widely (between 37% and 89%) from 157 to 222 m CSF-A. TOC concentrations were determined by acidification, with a range from below the detection limit to 0.08%. TOC is significantly higher in the uppermost \~57 m and at \~220 m CSF-A (0.08% and 0.04%, respectively), corresponding to intervals with lower carbonate concentrations.",65,Expedition 320 Preliminary Report

After the vessel was offset 30 m north of Hole U1332B, Hole U1332C was spudded at 0105 h on 28 March 2009. The seafloor depth calculated from the recovery of the first core was 4934.0 m DRF (4922.8 mbsl). Piston coring then routinely proceeded to 85.0 m DSF, during which the advances of Cores 320-U1333C-6H (4.0 m advance) and 8H (7.0 m advance) were adjusted to maintain overlap with previous holes. At \~1330 h on 28 March, while retrieving Core 10H, an electrical transient attributed to the rotating condenser caused two of the three main generators to trip off the main bus and resulted in a load shedding se­ quence to various systems on the vessel, which included loss of control voltage to all Thyrig bays for \~10 min. The consequence of the loss of Thyrig control voltage was a short-term loss of power to thrusters, propulsion, and drilling motors. During this short event, the DP 3% watch circle (percentage of water depth or \~150 m off the hole) was not exceeded.
