Expedition 322,is part of,Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE),Abstract,"Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 322 is part of the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) and was designed to document characteristics of incoming sedimentary strata and upper igneous basement prior to their arrival at the subduction front. To accomplish these objectives, coring was conducted at two sites in the Shikoku Basin on the subducting Philippine Sea plate. Site C0011 is located on the northwest flank of a prominent bathymetric high (the Kashinosaki Knoll), whereas Site C0012 is located near the crest of the knoll. The resulting data, which include logging while drilling during IODP Expedition 319, provide a wealth of new information on presubduction equivalents of the seismogenic zone. Unfortunately, coring at Site C0011 began at 340 m core depth below seafloor (CSF) and failed to reach the total depth target because of premature destruction of the drill bit at 876 m CSF. Coring at Site C0012, however, penetrated almost 38 m into igneous basement and recovered the sediment/basalt interface intact at 537.81 m CSF. The age of basal sediment (reddish brown pelagic claystone) is &gt;18.9 Ma. This recovery of basement was a major achievement, as was the comprehensive integration of core-logseismic data at Site C0011. The correlation of lithofacies and agedepth models from the two sites within the Shikoku Basin shows changes from an expanded section (Site C0011) to a condensed section (Site C0012) and captures all of the important ingredients of basin evolution, including a previously unrecognized interval of late Miocene tuffaceous and volcaniclastic sandstone designated the middle Shikoku Basin facies. An older (early to middle Miocene) turbidite sandstone/siltstone facies with mixed detrital provenance occurs in the lower Shikoku Basin; this unit may be broadly correlative with superficially similar Miocene turbidites on the western side of the basin. When viewed together, the two sites around the Kashinosaki Knoll not only demonstrate how basement relief influenced rates of hemipelagic and turbidite sedimentation in the Shikoku Basin, but also build the complete lithostratigraphic template on which all of the postexpedition laboratory results can be placed. Those forthcoming details will include mineral and volcanic ash composition, geotechnical properties,  frictional  properties,  and  hydrological  properties. Another triumph came from geochemical analyses of interstitial water and hydrocarbons at Site C0012. Unlike other so-called reference sites in the Nankai Trough, interstitial water on top of the basement high is largely unchanged by the effects of focused bedding-parallel flow and/or in situ reactions associated with rapid burial beneath the trench wedge and frontal accretionary prism. Thus, Site C0012  finally  provides  a  reliable  geochemical reference site for the subduction zone. In addition, geochemical evidence points to the presence of a seawater-like fluid within the upper basaltic crust, which is actively exchanging with the ocean and altering the interstitial water composition of the deep sediments by diffusional exchange.",1,Expedition 322 summary

The resulting data, which include logging while drilling during IODP Expedition 319, provide a wealth of new information on presubduction equivalents of the seismogenic zone. Unfortunately, coring at Site C0011 began at 340 m core depth below seafloor (CSF) and failed to reach the total depth target because of premature destruction of the drill bit at 876 m CSF. Coring at Site C0012, however, penetrated almost 38 m into igneous basement and recovered the sediment/basalt interface intact at 537.81 m CSF. The age of basal sediment (reddish brown pelagic claystone) is &gt;18.9 Ma. This recovery of basement was a major achievement, as was the comprehensive integration of core-logseismic data at Site C0011. The correlation of lithofacies and agedepth models from the two sites within the Shikoku Basin shows changes from an expanded section (Site C0011) to a condensed section (Site C0012) and captures all of the important ingredients of basin evolution, including a previously unrecognized interval of late Miocene tuffaceous and volcaniclastic sandstone designated the middle Shikoku Basin facies. An older (early to middle Miocene) turbidite sandstone/siltstone facies with mixed detrital provenance occurs in the lower Shikoku Basin; this unit may be broadly correlative with superficially similar Miocene turbidites on the western side of the basin. When viewed together, the two sites around the Kashinosaki Knoll not only demonstrate how basement relief influenced rates of hemipelagic and turbidite sedimentation in the Shikoku Basin, but also build the complete lithostratigraphic template on which all of the postexpedition laboratory results can be placed. Those forthcoming details will include mineral and volcanic ash composition, geotechnical properties,  frictional  properties,  and  hydrological  properties. Another triumph came from geochemical analyses of interstitial water and hydrocarbons at Site C0012. Unlike other so-called reference sites in the Nankai Trough, interstitial water on top of the basement high is largely unchanged by the effects of focused bedding-parallel flow and/or in situ reactions associated with rapid burial beneath the trench wedge and frontal accretionary prism. Thus, Site C0012  finally  provides  a  reliable  geochemical reference site for the subduction zone. In addition, geochemical evidence points to the presence of a seawater-like fluid within the upper basaltic crust, which is actively exchanging with the ocean and altering the interstitial water composition of the deep sediments by diffusional exchange.",1,Expedition 322 summary

Coring at Site C0012, however, penetrated almost 38 m into igneous basement and recovered the sediment/basalt interface intact at 537.81 m CSF. The age of basal sediment (reddish brown pelagic claystone) is &gt;18.9 Ma. This recovery of basement was a major achievement, as was the comprehensive integration of core-logseismic data at Site C0011. The correlation of lithofacies and agedepth models from the two sites within the Shikoku Basin shows changes from an expanded section (Site C0011) to a condensed section (Site C0012) and captures all of the important ingredients of basin evolution, including a previously unrecognized interval of late Miocene tuffaceous and volcaniclastic sandstone designated the middle Shikoku Basin facies. An older (early to middle Miocene) turbidite sandstone/siltstone facies with mixed detrital provenance occurs in the lower Shikoku Basin; this unit may be broadly correlative with superficially similar Miocene turbidites on the western side of the basin. When viewed together, the two sites around the Kashinosaki Knoll not only demonstrate how basement relief influenced rates of hemipelagic and turbidite sedimentation in the Shikoku Basin, but also build the complete lithostratigraphic template on which all of the postexpedition laboratory results can be placed. Those forthcoming details will include mineral and volcanic ash composition, geotechnical properties,  frictional  properties,  and  hydrological  properties. Another triumph came from geochemical analyses of interstitial water and hydrocarbons at Site C0012. Unlike other so-called reference sites in the Nankai Trough, interstitial water on top of the basement high is largely unchanged by the effects of focused bedding-parallel flow and/or in situ reactions associated with rapid burial beneath the trench wedge and frontal accretionary prism. Thus, Site C0012  finally  provides  a  reliable  geochemical reference site for the subduction zone.

Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE),entails,"seismic reflection, sampling, logging, downhole measurements, and long-term instrumentation of three geologic domains",Background,"The entirety of the NanTroSEIZE science plan entails seismic  reflection,  sampling,  logging,  downhole measurements, and long-term instrumentation of three geologic domains: (1) inputs to the subduction conveyor belt, (2) faults that splay from the plate interface to the surface and accommodate a major portion of coseismic and tsunamigenic slip, and (3) the main plate interface at 6–7 km below seafloor. The project has progressed into Stage 2 while following a research strategy that integrates rock mechanics, seismology, geodesy, frictional physics, and fluidfault interactions to shed light on the mechanics and dynamics of faulting processes.

Nankai subduction zone,inputs,rooted in previous discoveries from numerous boreholes,Geological setting,"As summarized by Underwood (2007), our knowledge of inputs to the Nankai subduction zone is rooted in previous discoveries from numerous boreholes that were drilled along the Muroto and Ashizuri transects (Deep Sea Drilling Project [DSDP] Legs 31 and 87 and Ocean Drilling Program [ODP] Legs 131, 190, and 196) (Karig, Ingle, et al., 1975; Kagami, Karig, Coulbourn, et al., 1986; Taira, Hill, Firth, et al., 1991; Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001; Mikada, Becker, Moore, Klaus, et al., 2002). Those studies demonstrated, among other things, that the plate boundary fault (décollement) propagates through Miocene strata of the lower Shikoku Basin facies, at least near the toe of the accretionary prism (Taira et al., 1992; Moore et al., 2001). Along the Kumano transect (Fig. F2), seismic reflection data show that the décollement is hosted by lower Shikoku Basin strata to a distance of at least 25–35 km landward of the trench (Fig. F3).

seismic reflection data,reveal,complexity and variability in acoustic character and stratigraphic thickness,Geological setting,"Regional-scale analyses of seismic reflection data from the Shikoku Basin reveal a large amount of complexity and variability in terms of acoustic character and stratigraphic thickness (Ike et al., 2008a, 2008b). Previous drilling also demonstrated that seafloor relief (created during construction of the underlying igneous basement) strongly influenced the basin’s early depositional history (Moore et al., 2001; Underwood, 2007). As an example of such influence, a prominent basement high marks the axis of a fossil (middle  Miocene)  backarc  spreading  center;  the younger Kinan seamount chain is superimposed on the fabric of the extinct ridge (Kobayashi et al., 1995). Evidently, elevation of the seafloor along the seamount chain inhibited transport and deposition of sand by gravity flows. As a consequence, Miocene– Pliocene sediments above the Kinan Ridge consist almost entirely of hemipelagic mudstone, whereas coeval Miocene strata on the flanks of the Kinan basement high consist largely of sand-rich turbidites (Moore et al., 2001). There are also important differences along strike in heat flow, clay mineral assemblages, and the progress of clay-mineral diagenesis (Underwood, 2007; Saffer et al., 2008). To learn more about how basement might have exerted control over  stratigraphic  architecture  elsewhere  in  the Shikoku Basin, Expedition 322 was designed to drill two reference sites: one at the crest of a bathymetric high (Kashinosaki Knoll) and the other along the northwest flank of the knoll (Fig. F4).",,Expedition 322 summary

basement-influenced heterogeneity,carries implications for,"abrupt changes in permeability structure, zonation of fluid pressure, and inconsistent progression of early diagenesis",How does the physical hydrogeology of Shikoku Basin respond to variations in primary lithologic architecture and basement structure?,"Shikoku Basin is punctuated by off-axis volcanic seamounts and remnant fragments of a deformed Zenisu Ridge (Le Pichon et al., 1987; Mazzotti et al., 2002). As expected, acoustic thickness of sediments generally decreases above larger basement highs (Ike et al., 2008a), but the 3-D architecture, mineral composition, detrital source(s), and directions of gravity flow transport of the lower Shikoku Basin are largely unconstrained by seismic data (Ike et al., 2008b).

turbidite sand bodies,provide,high-permeability conduits for fluid flow,How does the physical hydrogeology of Shikoku Basin respond to variations in primary lithologic architecture and basement structure?,"To characterize the spatial distribution of porosity and permeability accurately, we still need to map the turbidite sand bodies using recently acquired IFREE 3-D seismic data (Park et al., 2008). More importantly, we also need to characterize hydrologic properties of sandy intervals directly using cores and logs. The turbidite sand bodies of the Shikoku Basin almost certainly provide high-permeability conduits for fluid flow right up to the time when chemical cement or authigenic clays occluded the pore space. If uncemented sand beds still exist, focused fluid flow could be occurring today. Updip pinch-outs of sand bodies against basement highs also may have created compartments of excess pore pressure; this is particularly likely if overpressures get translated laterally during rapid burial beneath the trench wedge and/or accretionary prism (e.g., Bredehoeft et al., 1988). To evaluate this possibility quantitatively, our strategy is to compare hydrologic and geotechnical properties laterally between coeval facies units above basement plain and basement high. The upper boundary of the turbidites is also a likely zone of weakness if fluids migrate out of the turbidite section, are unable to drain vertically through the overlying mudstone aquitard, and create an overpressured zone near the lithologic boundary. As subduction progresses, the presence of sand intervals may simultaneously sustain high pore pressures at the top of the sandy turbidites because of translation of pressure along permeable strata (Bredehoeft et al., 1988; Dugan and Flemings, 2000) and allow improved drainage at their downdip edge, leading to significant changes in effective stress and fault strength in three dimensions (e.g., Saffer and Bekins, 2006).",5,Expedition 322 summary

The only constraints come from fluid chemistry just above basement (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001). During NanTroSEIZE, we must document how basement fluids evolve chemically and physically in the downdip direction and determine if or how potentially exotic fluids migrate vertically or updip from the basement. Additionally, if heat transfer from the basement is affected by hydrothermal circulation (Spinelli and Wang, 2008), then we need to quantify those effects on temperature gradients and rock properties at greater depths.

Geologic materials within the lower half of the Shikoku Basin are what ultimately enter the seismogenic zone and host slip along the deep megasplay and the deep décollement. Preexisting relief on the Shikoku Basin igneous crust obviously affected the spatial distribution of various sediment types and sedimentation rates, so our original plan (Saito et al., 2009) was to drill two sites: a condensed section on a basement high (proposed contingency Site NT1-01 [Hole C0012A]), and a thicker sand-rich section off that high (proposed primary Site NT1-07 [Hole C0011B]). A full program of coring and wireline logging of the sedimentary section was planned for Site C0011, and we benefited greatly from early acquisition of LWD data from Hole C0011A during the final days of Expedition 319. Log-seismic integration after the acquisition of LWD data indicated a depth to basement of \~1050 m SSF.

These attributes are consistent with a lithology of hemipelagic mud (silty clay to clayey silt).

The logging Unit 1/2 boundary is marked by steplike offsets of both gamma ray and resistivity values. The most striking features within logging Unit 2 are the high resistivity spikes, which coincide with low gamma ray peaks. The blocky log signature of this unit is indicative of local sand-filled submarine channels (Fig. F7), and the higher resistivity values may be due to a high concentration of volcanic glass shards within the sand-size fraction (see Lithology).

The distinction between tuffaceous and volcaniclastic sandstone is based on the abundance of pumice and volcanic glass shards (Fig. F10). Unit II also contains a chaotic interval of intermixed volcaniclastic sandstone and bioturbated silty claystone (mass transport deposit). Bulk powder XRD data show scattering within Unit II as a function of grain size; sandy specimens are enriched in feldspar, whereas hemipelagic mudstones contain higher percentages of total clay minerals (Fig. F11). Bulk powder XRF data show an intriguing gradient of Al2O3 and an abrupt shift to higher AlO below 377 m CSF (Fig. F12). This shift in bulk geochemistry may have been caused by a change in the clay-mineral assemblage.

VP increase,is subdued from,575 m CSF to the base of Unit III,Physical properties,"Physical property measurements at Site C0011 provide indications of bulk formation properties, which we were able to correlate with lithologic variation and compare with profiles from other drill sites in the Shikoku Basin. For example, sharp increases in magnetic susceptibility (from the MSCL) correlate nicely with individual sandstone beds in lithologic Unit II (Fig. F17). In addition, a shift in magnetic susceptibility in Unit III near 575 m CSF correlates with a change in sedimentation rate at \~11 Ma (Fig. F16). Calculated values of bulk density and porosity show a downhole increase in bulk density (1.5– 2.1 g/cm3) and decrease in porosity (0.55–0.32), indicative of sediment consolidation (Fig. F18). These trends correlate with increases in compressional velocity (VP) and electrical resistivity.

drilling and coring disturbance,perturbed,bulk physical property measurements,Physical properties,"Although crude first-order trends are clear in the profiles, drilling and coring disturbance perturbed the results of bulk physical property measurements in several important ways. To begin with, decreased core diameter from rotary core barrel (RCB) coring resulted in whole-round multisensor core logger (MSCL-W) calculated values that are not representative of in situ conditions; these volume-related artifacts can be remedied through advanced processing involving integration of X-ray computed tomography data. Another likely source of error is inaccurate grain density measurements, as those values also show an unusually high range of scatter. A more serious problem is that many cores were damaged by microscale cracks and fractures induced by drilling, coring, and/or the recovery processes, particularly during periods of high heave and drill bit deterioration. Our sampling procedure tried to avoid regions that had visible fractures; however, the data show evidence of pervasive internal disturbance. This disturbance is most obvious in the unusually high variability in bulk density and porosity values and in P-wave velocity measured on cube samples (Figs. F18, F19).

dissolved sulfate profile,shows,structure in Hole C0012A,Inorganic geochemistry,"The dissolved sulfate profile for Hole C0012A shows quite a bit of structure (Fig. F31), which is consistent with biogeochemical processes. The values preclude any correction for potential contamination because a total depletion of sulfate in the formation fluids could not be assumed. The sulfate profile clearly documents an abnormal sulfate reduction zone (Fig. F31), which is significantly deeper (\~300 m CSF) than those detected at other sites along the Nankai margin. At Site 1173, for example, sulfate is undetectable  below  6  meters  below  seafloor  (mbsf) (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001). The subdued microbial activity in the upper sections of Hole C0012A may be due to lower sedimentation rates above the basement high, as compared to the flanks of the Kashinosaki Knoll, which receive more voluminous supplies of terrigenous organic matter by turbidity currents. Sulfate depletion at \~300 m CSF also coincides with an increase in dissolved methane and ethane concentrations in the interstitial water (Fig. F32). One explanation for the presence of these hydrocarbons, which occur in significantly lower concentrations here than at Site C0011, is updip migration of gas in solution from deeper thermogenic sources. Another possibility is in situ biogenic formation from terrigenous organic matter. Regardless, it is likely that the sulfate concentrations at Site C0012 are modulated by anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO), thereby leading to the production of hydrogen sulfide. In support of this idea, we observed a marked increase in hydrogen sulfide concentration concomitant with the peak in methane concentration.

Figure F35,shows,provisional correlation of lithologic units between Sites C0011 and C0012,Summary,"Figure F35 shows the provisional correlation of lithologic units between Sites C0011 and C0012. The approximate ages of unit boundaries are also shown, using the respective composite age-depth models for the two sites. In general, there is good agreement between the two data sets. In particular, a close match exists for the lithologic Unit I/II boundary, which marks the base of the upper Shikoku Basin facies. Based on its age and volcaniclastic sand content, Unit II is unique to the Kumano transect area and has been designated herein as the middle Shikoku Basin facies. Equivalent deposits were not cored within either the Muroto or Ashizuri transects, and the closest volcanic source at the time was the IzuBonin arc. The stratigraphic transition into the lower Shikoku Basin seems to correlate with a similar transition to a dominantly hemipelagic lithology at other sites in the Shikoku Basin and accretionary prism toe, but the ages are different. At all other localities across the Nankai margin, what has been classified as the upper part of the lower Shikoku Basin consists of monotonous heavily bioturbated hemipelagic mudstone, ranging in age from \~3.5 to \~6.0 Ma. At Sites C0011 and C0012, the hemipelagic facies occurred earlier in the basin’s evolution during the middle–late Miocene (\~9.1 to \~12.7 Ma). Below that stratigraphic interval, the sandy turbidite facies of the lower Shikoku Basin seems to match up with broadly coeval packets of siliciclastic turbidite that were recovered at Site 1177 along the Ashizuri transect.

Site C0012,acquired,reliable interstitial water geochemistry data,Preliminary scientific assessment,"Recovery of core from Site C0012, including successful penetration of igneous basement, was a major achievement for NanTroSEIZE, as was the acquisition of LWD logs from Site C0011 prior to coring. Based on preliminary analysis of the sandstone petrology, we now know that two sand-rich turbidite systems developed within the Shikoku Basin during the middle and late Miocene epochs. The younger system, which is characterized by a volcanic source of detritus, was sampled for the first time during this expedition.

Prior to drilling, the estimated depth to basement at Site C0011 was set at 1050 m SSF.

The  hydrogeologic  objective, however, met with limited success in Hole C0011B because of poor core recovery and an extensive interval of wash down within the inferred turbidites of the lower Shikoku Basin. LWD logs help constrain the 2-D geometry of the turbidite intervals, and core recovery was just enough to characterize the sandstone petrofacies and detrital provenance. The overall hydrogeologic properties and 3-D stratigraphic architecture of the sand bodies remain largely unknown. On the other hand, indirect evidence for focused fluid flow can be extracted from interstitial water geochemistry and hydrocarbon concentrations. Correlative facies were also recovered at Site C0012, which allows us to extend the characterization of fluid composition and fluid transport from the flank of the basement high to the updip extension of correlative facies units. These data point to two separate regimes that modify interstitial water composition  of  sediments  prior  to  subduction: (1) seawater-like fluid in the upper igneous basement, which modifies interstitial water chemistry by diffusional exchange, and (2) dehydration reactions within a deeper seated sedimentary source coupled with focused flow toward the Shikoku Basin up the flank of the basement high.
