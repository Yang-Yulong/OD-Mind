Expedition 322,is part of,Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE),Abstract,"Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 322 is part of the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) and was designed to document characteristics of incoming sedimentary strata and igneous basement prior to their arrival at the subduction front. To accomplish these objectives, coring was conducted at two sites in the Shikoku Basin on the subducting Philippine Sea plate. Site C0011 is located on the northwest flank of a prominent bathymetric high (the Kashinosaki Knoll), whereas Site C0012 is located near the crest of the knoll. The resulting data, which include logging while drilling during IODP Expedition 319, provide a wealth of new information on presubduction equivalents of the seismogenic zone. Unfortunately, coring at Site C0011 began at 340 m core depth below seafloor (CSF) and failed to reach the total depth target because of premature destruction of the drill bit at 876 m CSF. Coring at Site C0012, however, penetrated almost 23 m into igneous basement and recovered the sediment/basalt interface intact at 537.81 m CSF. The age of basal sediment (reddish-brown pelagic claystone) is &gt;18.9 Ma. This recovery of basement was a major achievement, as was the comprehensive integration of core-log-seismic data at Site C0011. The merger of lithofacies and age-depth models from the two sites spans across the Shikoku Basin from an expanded section (Site C0011) to a condensed section (Site C0012) and captures all of the important ingredients of basin evolution, including a heretofore unrecognized interval of late Miocene tuffaceous and volcaniclastic sandstone designated the middle Shikoku Basin facies. An older (early–middle Miocene) turbidite sandstone/siltstone facies with mixed detrital provenance occurs in the lower Shikoku Basin; this unit may be broadly correlative with superficially similar Miocene turbidites on the western side of the basin. When viewed together, the two sites around the Kashinosaki Knoll not only demonstrate how basement relief influenced rates of hemipelagic and turbidite sedimentation in the Shikoku Basin, they also build the complete lithostratigraphic template on which all of the postexpedition laboratory results can be placed. Those forthcoming details will include mineral and volcanic ash composition, geotechnical properties, frictional properties, and hydrological properties. Another triumph came from geochemical analyses of pore water and hydrocarbons at Site C0012. Unlike other so-called reference sites in the Nankai Trough, pore fluids on top of the basement high show clear evidence of a seawater-like source, with chlorinity values increasing toward basement because of hydration reactions and diffusion; the fluids are largely unchanged by the effects of focused flow and/or in situ dehydration reactions associated with rapid burial beneath the trench wedge and frontal accretionary prism. Thus, Site C0012 finally provides a reliable geochemical reference site for the subduction zone.",1,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

The resulting data, which include logging while drilling during IODP Expedition 319, provide a wealth of new information on presubduction equivalents of the seismogenic zone. Unfortunately, coring at Site C0011 began at 340 m core depth below seafloor (CSF) and failed to reach the total depth target because of premature destruction of the drill bit at 876 m CSF. Coring at Site C0012, however, penetrated almost 23 m into igneous basement and recovered the sediment/basalt interface intact at 537.81 m CSF. The age of basal sediment (reddish-brown pelagic claystone) is &gt;18.9 Ma. This recovery of basement was a major achievement, as was the comprehensive integration of core-log-seismic data at Site C0011. The merger of lithofacies and age-depth models from the two sites spans across the Shikoku Basin from an expanded section (Site C0011) to a condensed section (Site C0012) and captures all of the important ingredients of basin evolution, including a heretofore unrecognized interval of late Miocene tuffaceous and volcaniclastic sandstone designated the middle Shikoku Basin facies. An older (early–middle Miocene) turbidite sandstone/siltstone facies with mixed detrital provenance occurs in the lower Shikoku Basin; this unit may be broadly correlative with superficially similar Miocene turbidites on the western side of the basin. When viewed together, the two sites around the Kashinosaki Knoll not only demonstrate how basement relief influenced rates of hemipelagic and turbidite sedimentation in the Shikoku Basin, they also build the complete lithostratigraphic template on which all of the postexpedition laboratory results can be placed. Those forthcoming details will include mineral and volcanic ash composition, geotechnical properties, frictional properties, and hydrological properties. Another triumph came from geochemical analyses of pore water and hydrocarbons at Site C0012. Unlike other so-called reference sites in the Nankai Trough, pore fluids on top of the basement high show clear evidence of a seawater-like source, with chlorinity values increasing toward basement because of hydration reactions and diffusion; the fluids are largely unchanged by the effects of focused flow and/or in situ dehydration reactions associated with rapid burial beneath the trench wedge and frontal accretionary prism. Thus, Site C0012 finally provides a reliable geochemical reference site for the subduction zone.",1,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

Nankai Trough region,is,among the most extensively studied subduction zones in the world,Introduction,"The Nankai Trough region of southeast Japan is among the most extensively studied subduction zones in the world (Fig. F1).

The project has progressed into Stage 2 by following a research strategy that integrates rock mechanics, seismology, geodesy, frictional physics, and fluid-fault interactions to shed light on the mechanics and dynamics of faulting processes. Despite recent advances, there is neither a unified theory of fault slip to account for earthquake nucleation and propagation nor is there a theory to explain the mechanisms of strain across the spectrum of observed deformation rates ranging from seconds to years. Consequently, the simple question of whether or not precursor signals exist for major earthquakes, even in theory, remains under scientific debate.",,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

earthquake science,is limited by,lack of information on ambient conditions and mechanical properties of active faults at depth,Background,"Progress on these topics in earthquake science is limited by a lack of information on ambient conditions and mechanical properties of active faults at depth. Extant rheological models for how faults behave require choices to be made for specific physical properties at the fault interface and in the surrounding rock volume. Coefficients of friction, permeability, pore fluid pressure, state of stress, and elastic stiffness are examples of such parameters that can be measured best (or only) through drilling and geophysical sensing of the surrounding rock volume. Conditions for stable versus unstable sliding (i.e., seismic versus aseismic behavior) have long been debated. The frictional strength of likely fault zone materials is another topic of great interest. Fault zone composition, consolidation state, normal stress magnitude, pore fluid pressure, and strain rate may all affect the transition from aseismic to seismic slip (e.g., Moore and Saffer, 2001; Saffer and Marone, 2003). To tease apart the contributions of each, the NanTroSEIZE project will: (1) sample fault rocks over a range of pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions across the aseismic–seismogenic transition; (2) document the composition of fault rocks and fluids, as well as associated pore pressure and state of stress; and (3) address spatial partitioning of strain between the décollement and splay faults.

Those studies demonstrated, among other things, that the plate boundary fault (décollement) propagates through Miocene strata of the lower Shikoku Basin facies, at least near the toe of the accretionary prism (Taira et al., 1992; Moore et al., 2001). Along the Kumano transect (Fig. F2), seismic reflection data show that the décollement is hosted by lower Shikoku Basin strata to a distance of at least 25–35 km landward of the trench (Fig. F3). Farther landward, the plate boundary fault steps downsection to a position at or near the interface between sedimentary rock and igneous basement (Park et al., 2002).

seismic reflection data,reveal,complexity and variability in acoustic character and stratigraphic thickness,Geological setting,"Regional-scale analyses of seismic reflection data from the Shikoku Basin reveal a large amount of complexity and variability in terms of acoustic character and stratigraphic thickness (Ike et al., 2008a, 2008b). Previous drilling also demonstrated that seafloor relief (created during construction of the underlying igneous basement) strongly influenced the basin’s early depositional history (Moore et al., 2001; Underwood, 2007). As an example of such influence, a prominent basement high marks the axis of a fossil (middle Miocene) backarc spreading center; younger seamounts of the Kinan chain are superimposed on the fabric of the extinct ridge (Kobayashi et al., 1995). Evidently, elevation of the seafloor along the seamount chain inhibited transport and deposition of sand by gravity flows. As a consequence, Miocene–Pliocene sediments above the ridge consist almost entirely of hemipelagic mudstone, whereas coeval Miocene strata on the flanks of the Kinan basement high consist largely of sand-rich turbidites (Moore et al., 2001). There are also important differences along strike in clay mineral assemblages and the progress of clay–mineral diagenesis (Underwood, 2007; Saffer et al., 2008). To learn more about how basement might have exerted control over stratigraphic architecture elsewhere in the Shikoku Basin, Expedition 322 was designed to drill two reference sites: one at the crest of a bathymetric high (Kashinosaki Knoll) and the other along the northwest flank of the knoll (Fig. F4).",5,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

The project also greatly benefited from the acquisition of logging-while-drilling (LWD) data from Hole C0011A (proposed Site NT1- 07A) during the final days of Expedition 319 (Saffer et al., 2009). Among other things, the LWD data allowed for shipboard adjustments to seismic velocity models and more accurate time-depth conversions.",6,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

At Site 1177, the lower Shikoku Basin also contains four discrete packets of sandy turbidites between \~450 and 750 m core depth below seafloor (CSF). Near Site C0011, we see one distinctive interval of discontinuous highamplitude seismic reflectors from \~350 to 500 m seismic depth below seafloor (SSF) (Fig. F4), and that interval may coincide with a facies that contains abundant sand beds. However, it is interesting to note that this packet of reflectors can be traced up and over the crest of the Kashinosaki Knoll.

The only constraints come from fluid chemistry just above basement (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001). During NanTroSEIZE, we must consider how basement fluids evolve chemically and physically in the downdip direction and determine if or how potentially exotic fluids migrate vertically or updip from the basement.

Without drilling, we cannot know whether or not the anticipated Miocene turbidites on the northeast side of the Shikoku Basin shared a common composition and provenance with coeval sand bodies on the southwest side (i.e., offshore Ashizuri and Muroto Peninsulas; Fig. F1). If armed with core samples, pore water, and thermal data from the reference sites, scientists will be able to forecast the onset of cement precipitation (e.g., quartz, calcite, and zeolite), framework grain dissolution, and formation of pseudomatrix by compaction and/or tectonic deformation of ductile/labile rock fragments and phyllosilicates. Currently, we know little about clay mineralogy, volcanic ash stratigraphy, or ash alteration on the northeast side of the Shikoku Basin. Preliminary data from Expeditions 315 and 316 (Ashi et al., 2009; Screaton et al., 2009) reveal temporal trends in clay content that are consistent with the Pliocene–Pleistocene sections from offshore of Cape Muroto and Cape Ashizuri (e.g., Underwood and Steurer, 2003; Underwood and Fergusson, 2005), but the older Miocene strata remain largely unsampled. The clay-mineral budget is integral to several important hydration and dehydration reactions (e.g., smectite–illite transition) (Saffer et al., 2008; Saffer and McKiernan, 2009). An abundance of clay-size particles also lowers the coefficient of internal friction regardless of mineral type (e.g., Brown et al., 2003). One prediction to test is the enrichment of both detrital and authigenic smectite (an unusually weak expandable clay) in response to larger amounts of volcanogenic input from the Izu-Bonin arc and a weaker northeast-directed proto-Kuroshio Current during the Miocene (Underwood and Steurer, 2003; Underwood and Fergusson, 2005). Temporal changes in ocean circulation also need to be evaluated in concert with constraints on the timing of eruptive activity in nearby volcanic arc systems (e.g., Taylor, 1992; Cambray et al., 1995; Kimura et al., 2005).

This spatial-temporal view is important because the waxing and waning of eruptive activity may have triggered widespread changes in both sediment composition and sediment supply rates to different parts of the Shikoku Basin at different times.",9,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

Site NT1-07,description,thicker sand-rich section off that high,Drilling plan,"To reiterate, the principal purposes of Expedition 322 were to sample within the Shikoku Basin and to quantify initial conditions in the materials that are tectonically delivered to the subduction system. Geologic materials within the lower half of the Shikoku Basin are what ultimately enter the seismogenic zone and host slip along the deep megasplay and the deep décollement. Preexisting relief on the Shikoku Basin igneous crust obviously affected the spatial distribution of various sediment types and sedimentation rates, so our original plan (Saito et al., 2009) was to drill two sites: a condensed section on a basement high (proposed contingency Site NT1-01 [Hole C0012A]), and a thicker sand-rich section off that high (proposed primary Site NT1- 07 [Hole C0011B]). Both sites need to be cored and logged to reveal how basement relief influences such factors as the presubduction geometry of sedimentary facies, temperature, permeability, consolidation state, frictional properties, sediment and basement alteration, and fluid flow. A full program of coring and wireline logging of the sedimentary section was planned for Site C0011, and we benefited greatly from early acquisition of LWD data from Hole C0011A during the final days of Expedition 319. Another change in plan came as a result of premature bit destruction and failure to reach the total depth (TD) target during coring in Hole C0011B.

Logging Unit 1,exhibits,minor fluctuations in gamma ray and a very gradual decrease in ring resistivity,Core-Log-Seismic integration,"Logging Unit 1 (0–251.5 m LWD depth below seafloor [LSF]) exhibits minor fluctuations in gamma ray and a very gradual decrease in ring resistivity. These attributes are consistent with a lithology of hemipelagic mud (silty clay to clayey silt). Logging Unit 2 (251.5–478.5 m LSF) corresponds to a series of high-amplitude seismic reflections, which are laterally variable and discontinuous. The logging Unit 1/2 boundary is marked by steplike offsets of both gamma ray and resistivity values. The most striking features within logging Unit 2 are the high resistivity spikes, which coincide with low gamma ray peaks. The blocky log signature of this unit is indicative of local sandfilled channels (Fig. F7), and the higher resistivity values may be due to a high concentration of volcanic glass shards within the sand-size fraction (see Lithostratigraphy). Logging Unit 3 (478.5–736.0 m LSF) exhibits increases in both the gamma ray trendline and ring resistivity, with little variation. At \~650 m LSF, the log character changes to include low gamma ray peaks and low ring resistivity spikes (Subunit 3C), which we interpret to be intervals of terrigenous sand. Logging Unit 4 (736.0–867.0 m LSF) exhibits a series of four inferred fining- and coarsening-upward sequences that correlate with a series of high-amplitude seismic reflections with excellent lateral continuity. We interpret these intervals as packets of sand-rich turbidites. Logging Unit 5 (867.0–950.5 m LSF) is characterized by a sharp increase in the ring resistivity log, followed by minor fluctuations around a constant trendline.

physical property measurements,provide,indications of bulk formation properties,Physical properties,"Physical property measurements at Site C0011 provide indications of bulk formation properties, which we were able to correlate with lithologic variation and compare with profiles from other drill sites in the Shikoku Basin. For example, sharp increases in magnetic susceptibility (from the MSCL) correlate nicely with individual sandstone beds in lithologic Unit II (Fig. F17). In addition, a shift in magnetic susceptibility in Unit III near 575 m CSF correlates with a change in sedimentation rate at \~11 Ma (Fig. F16). Calculated bulk density and porosity show a downhole increase in bulk density (1.5–2.1 g/cm3) and decrease in porosity (0.55–0.32), indicative of sediment consolidation (Fig. F18). These trends correlate with increases in compressional velocity (VP) and electrical resistivity. The velocity-porosity relation is consistent with previous observations from Shikoku Basin sediments (Hoffman and Tobin, 2004). Although the trend for VP increases downhole, this increase is subdued from 575 m CSF to the base of Unit III, thereby correlating with the change in magnetic susceptibility mentioned above. Velocity anisotropy changes from isotropic to anisotropic (i.e., horizontal velocity faster than vertical velocity) near 440 m CSF (Fig. F19), and we attribute this change to compaction-induced alignment of mineral grains.

drilling and coring disturbance,perturbed,bulk physical property measurements,Physical properties,"Although crude first-order trends are clear in the profiles, drilling and coring disturbance perturbed the results of bulk physical property measurements in several important ways.

It is 68.95 m thick and extends from 150.86 to 219.81 m CSF. Stratigraphic equivalents to the basal part of Subunit IIA (as defined in Hole C0011B) appear to be present here as very coarse- to finegrained tuffaceous to volcaniclastic sandstone. The dominant lithology is green-gray silty claystone, alternating with medium- to thick-bedded tuffaceous/volcaniclastic sandstone and dark gray clayey siltstone. Lithologic Unit II contains two chaotic deposits that are 0.3 and 3.1 m thick (150.86–151.17 and 178.00–181.10 m CSF, respectively). As observed at Site C0011, these deposits consist of disaggregated pieces of volcanic-rich sandstone and bioturbated silty claystone that show folding, thinning, and attenuation of primary bedding. They are interpreted to have formed by gravitational sliding on the relatively steep north-facing slopes of Kashinosaki Knoll. XRD data show scatter in concentrations of total clay minerals and feldspar because of lithologic heterogeneity (Fig. F25).

This variability is not restricted to separate intervals but is also observed across diffuse limits between highly phyric and sparsely phyric basalts. Phenocrysts are composed mostly of plagioclase, pyroxene, and sparse altered olivine. Othopyroxene is dominant compared to clinopyroxene. Pyrite is present as an accessory mineral in some basalts. Vesicularity is highly heterogeneous. In a single sequence, basalts can have sparse (1%–5%) to high (&gt;20%) vesicle content.

silty claystones,yield,relatively low NRM intensity,Paleomagnetism,"Magnetic property variations among various lithologies are similar to those observed at Site C0011. For example, the typical silty claystones yield relatively low NRM intensity compared to sandstone and volcaniclastic sandstone. In lithologic Unit III, both NRM intensity and magnetic susceptibility show a steady downhole decrease. We collected four basalt samples from the basement unit and subjected them to detailed alternating-field (AF) demagnetization experiment. Apparent self-reversal of remanence is observed during the AF demagnetization on two of the basaltic samples. This behavior could be due to a self-reversal of pyrrhotite and needs to be further examined during shore-based studies. Several relatively well-defined polarity intervals were identified in downhole magnetostratigraphic records. Using biostratigraphic data, we were able to correlate patterns of the magnetic polarity interval recorded in the sediments against the standard geomagnetic reversal timescale. In particular, the polarity interval between 5 and 8 Ma can be correlated with confidence and with somewhat less confidence back to 11 Ma.",25,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

dissolved sulfate profile,shows,structure in Hole C0012A,Inorganic geochemistry,"The dissolved sulfate profile for Hole C0012A shows quite a bit of structure (Fig. F31), which is consistent with biogeochemical processes. The observed distribution precludes any correction for potential contamination because a total depletion of sulfate in the formation fluids could not be assumed. The sulfate profile clearly documents an abnormal sulfate reduction zone (Fig. F31); its depth is significantly deeper than those detected at other sites along the Nankai margin. At Site 1173, for example, sulfate is undetectable below 6 meters below seafloor (mbsf) (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001). The subdued microbial activity in the upper sections of Hole C0012A may be due to lower sedimentation rates above the basement high, as compared to the flanks of the Kashinosaki Knoll, which receive more voluminous supplies of sediment by turbidity currents. Sulfate depletion at \~300 m CSF also coincides with an increase in dissolved methane and ethane concentrations in the interstitial water (Fig. F32). One viable explanation for the presence of these hydrocarbons, which occur in significantly lower concentrations here than at Site C0011, is updip migration of gas in solution from deeper thermogenic sources. Another possibility is in situ biogenic formation from terrigenous organic matter. Regardless, it is likely that the sulfate concentrations at Site C0012 are modulated by anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO), thereby leading to the production of hydrogen sulfide. In support of this idea, we observed a marked increase in hydrogen sulfide concentration concomitant with the peak in methane concentration. Among the iron sulfide minerals, pyrite is the most stable phase and is common in the sediments over a comparable depth range.",27,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

At Site 1173, for example, sulfate is undetectable below 6 meters below seafloor (mbsf) (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001). The subdued microbial activity in the upper sections of Hole C0012A may be due to lower sedimentation rates above the basement high, as compared to the flanks of the Kashinosaki Knoll, which receive more voluminous supplies of sediment by turbidity currents. Sulfate depletion at \~300 m CSF also coincides with an increase in dissolved methane and ethane concentrations in the interstitial water (Fig. F32). One viable explanation for the presence of these hydrocarbons, which occur in significantly lower concentrations here than at Site C0011, is updip migration of gas in solution from deeper thermogenic sources.

shipboard results,require,refined shore-based analyses,Inorganic geochemistry,"The shipboard results require refined shore-based analyses to interpret the geochemistry with greater confidence, but they point to the intriguing possibility of two distinct fluid regimes within the sedimentary strata seaward of the trench. One regime is characterized by flow toward the Shikoku Basin from subducting sediments (i.e., due to a combination of compaction and mineral dehydration reactions) together with migration through high-permeability horizons of middle and lower Shikoku Basin facies. The geochemical fingerprints for this regime are a combination of fluid freshening and the presence of heavier hydrocarbons at all sites drilled on the basement plain, including Sites C0011, 1173, and 1177. No such freshening is observed at Site C0012. Rather, the only hints of a lateral flow are small concentrations of dissolved methane and ethane, which indicate that a modest contribution of hydrocarbons did reach the top of the basement-high site. Unlike its flanks, the crest of Kashinosaki Knoll reveals a separate pore water regime driven by in situ hydration reactions, diffusion, and migration of a higher chlorinity more seawater-like fluid into the sediment pile from the underlying igneous basement. Especially noteworthy is the observed increase in sulfate below 490 m CSF, which cannot be supplied by the methane bearing fluids that moved toward the knoll from the deeper landward side.

In particular, a close match exists for the lithologic Unit I/II boundary, which marks the base of the upper Shikoku Basin facies. Based on its age and volcanic sand content, Unit II is unique to the Kumano transect area and has been designated middle Shikoku Basin facies. Equivalent deposits were not cored within either the Muroto or Ashizuri transects, and the closest volcanic source is the Izu-Bonin arc. The apparent age of the Unit II/III boundary is \~1 m.y. older at Site C0012 than at Site C0011, but this difference could be due to incomplete recovery. The stratigraphic transition into the lower Shikoku Basin seems to correlate with a similar transition in lithology at other sites in the Shikoku Basin and accretionary prism toe, but the ages are different. At all other localities across the Nankai margin, what has been classified as the upper part of the lower Shikoku Basin consists of monotonous heavily bioturbated hemipelagic mudstone, ranging in age from \~2.5 to \~7.0 Ma. At Sites C0011 and C0012, cessation of both volcanic ash (by air fall) and sand/silt (by turbidity currents) occurred earlier in the basin’s evolution during the middle–late Miocene (\~9.1 to \~12.8 Ma). Below that interval, the sandy turbidite facies of the lower Shikoku Basin seems to match up with broadly coeval siliciclastic turbidite intervals that were recovered at Site 1177 along the Ashizuri transect. Detailed petrographic work will be required to quantify petrofacies, compare the detrital provenance, and piece together the regional system of sediment dispersal on the west and east sides of the basin. Recovery of basal pelagic deposits in contact with pillow basalt constitutes a major achievement at Site C0012. We know that the age of the basement is older than \~18.9 Ma, based on nannofossil assemblages in the overlying pelagic sediment.

Equivalent deposits were not cored within either the Muroto or Ashizuri transects, and the closest volcanic source is the Izu-Bonin arc. The apparent age of the Unit II/III boundary is \~1 m.y. older at Site C0012 than at Site C0011, but this difference could be due to incomplete recovery. The stratigraphic transition into the lower Shikoku Basin seems to correlate with a similar transition in lithology at other sites in the Shikoku Basin and accretionary prism toe, but the ages are different. At all other localities across the Nankai margin, what has been classified as the upper part of the lower Shikoku Basin consists of monotonous heavily bioturbated hemipelagic mudstone, ranging in age from \~2.5 to \~7.0 Ma. At Sites C0011 and C0012, cessation of both volcanic ash (by air fall) and sand/silt (by turbidity currents) occurred earlier in the basin’s evolution during the middle–late Miocene (\~9.1 to \~12.8 Ma). Below that interval, the sandy turbidite facies of the lower Shikoku Basin seems to match up with broadly coeval siliciclastic turbidite intervals that were recovered at Site 1177 along the Ashizuri transect. Detailed petrographic work will be required to quantify petrofacies, compare the detrital provenance, and piece together the regional system of sediment dispersal on the west and east sides of the basin. Recovery of basal pelagic deposits in contact with pillow basalt constitutes a major achievement at Site C0012. We know that the age of the basement is older than \~18.9 Ma, based on nannofossil assemblages in the overlying pelagic sediment. Radiometric age dating will be needed to establish the eruptive age of the basalt.",1,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report
relief on the bathymetric high,may have been enhanced by,inversion at some point in the late Miocene or Pliocene,Summary,"When viewed as a pair, it is clear that the condensed section at Site C0012 displays significant reductions in unit thickness for all correlative parts of the two stratigraphic columns, including the sand-rich intervals (Fig. F36). This is another important discovery. Although relief on the bathymetric high may have been enhanced by inversion at some point in the late Miocene or Pliocene, the basement clearly modulated sedimentation rates throughout the history of the Shikoku Basin. Relief on the seafloor, however, was never high enough to completely prevent the transport and deposition of sandy detritus atop the crest of the bathymetric high (Kashinosaki",1,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

Site C0012,represents,closest to a true geochemical reference site for the Nankai Trough,Summary,"In addition to material properties, profiles of pore water geochemistry for Site C0012 represent the closest we have seen to a true geochemical reference site for the Nankai Trough. Unlike Site C0011, where a freshening trend is obvious in the pore water, Site C0012 yields no evidence for significant in situ dehydration reactions or movement of freshened fluids updip to the crest of the bathymetric high (Fig. F37). Instead, chlorinity increases toward the basement because of hydration reactions and diffusion, probably in response to both volcanic ash and basement alteration. In essence, that site represents the geochemical reference site for the Nankai subduction zone, with pore fluids unaffected by the effects of focused flow and diagenesis associated with rapid burial beneath the trench wedge and frontal accretionary prism.

Shikoku Basin,contains,two prominent intervals of sand-rich turbidite deposits,"Objective 2: Core and log the sandy turbidite facies of the lower Shikoku Basin, and assess its potential for focused lateral transport of fluids via geochemical analyses of pore water and gases.","Cores and LWD logs both show that the Shikoku Basin contains two prominent intervals of sand-rich turbidite deposits. The hydrogeologic objective, however, met with limited success in Hole C0011B because of poor core recovery and an extensive interval of wash down within the inferred turbidites of the lower Shikoku Basin. LWD logs help constrain the 2-D geometry of the turbidite intervals, and core recovery was just enough to characterize the sandstone petrofacies and detrital provenance. The overall hydrogeologic properties and 3-D stratigraphic architecture of the sand bodies remain largely unknown. On the other hand, indirect evidence for focused fluid flow can be extracted from pore water geochemistry and hydrocarbon concentrations. Correlative facies were also recovered at Site C0012, which allows us to extend the characterization of fluid composition and fluid transport from the flank of the basement high to the updip extension of correlative facies units. These data are indicative of two fluid regimes: a more seawater-like fluid moving upward from igneous basement, and a deeper seated sedimentary source coupled with dehydration and focused flow toward the Shikoku Basin up to where the turbidites lap onto the basement high.

Nankai subduction zone,shows,freshening of pore water with depth,Objective 3: Complete detailed profiles of pore water geochemistry within the lowermost sedimentary strata of the Shikoku Basin as an indicator of fluid chemistry within upper basement.,"We failed to achieve this objective at Site C0011 because of premature termination of the coring hole (destruction of bit). Furthermore, geochemical profiles higher in the sedimentary section are ambiguous with respect to a possible basement fluid source because of the extensive amounts of contamination by drilling fluid. At Site C0012, however, pore fluid samples were successfully extracted from cores in close proximity to the sediment/basement interface. Initial evaluation of the data reveals several intriguing possibilities for fluid sources, migration pathways, and mixing, including a more seawater-like fluid emanating from the upper basement. Chlorinity increases above seawater values by 12% toward the basement contact, whereas all of the other comparable sites in the Nankai subduction zone show freshening of pore water with depth. In addition, the sulfate reduction zone is much deeper than anticipated at Site C0012, and sulfate depletion coincides with marked increases in methane and ethane concentrations. The sulfate profile is probably driven by AMO and hydrogen sulfide production. There is also widespread geochemical evidence for alteration of volcanic material at both sites; this alteration includes a component of dispersed ash, volcanic sand, and the basaltic basement.

When integrated with the age constraints provided by nannofossils, foraminifers, and paleomagnetic reversals, the compositional data will provide an unprecedented view of the basin’s history in the region between the Kinan seamount chain and the Izu-Bonin volcanic arc. Ultimately, we will be able to combine that regional reconstruction with information already available from the Muroto and Ashizuri transect areas to the west, thereby demonstrating how different parts of the backarc basin responded to major tectonic and climate events during the margin’s Miocene–Quaternary evolution.",5,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report

core-log-seismic integration effort,was,marginally successful,"Objective 7: Integrate and correlate among cores, logs, and seismic profiles from the seaward edge of the trench wedge to the crest of the Kashinosaki Knoll.","Overall, the core-log-seismic integration effort was marginally successful. Our ability to extend correlations for significant distances away from the two drill sites was limited by the small size of the mini-3-D seismic survey and the proprietary hold on most of the seismic data. Ties between logs and core were hampered by poor recovery and ubiquitous damage to the cores. Pervasive water-filled microcracks led to unreliable measurements of porosity, density, and P-wave velocity. The severity of this damage can be seen in the mismatch between reflections on the seismic line through Site C0011 and the synthetic seismogram, which was calculated using the values from discrete measurements of physical properties on core. In addition, the wireline logging program at Site C0011 was cancelled, and logging at Site C0012 failed because of operational difficulties (excessive deviation of the borehole) and an approaching typhoon. On the positive side, our success in making qualitative comparisons between logging units identified from LWD data and lithologic units identified during VCD improved the interpretations of basin stratigraphy and facies evolution.",6,Expedition 322 Preliminary Report
