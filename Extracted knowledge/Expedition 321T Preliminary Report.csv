IODP Expedition 321T,pumped,cement into reentry cones around subseafloor borehole observatories in IODP Holes U1301A and U1301B,Abstract,"Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 321T pumped cement into reentry cones around subseafloor borehole observatories in IODP Holes U1301A and U1301B in order to seal the systems and permit later completion of long-term hydrogeologic monitoring, sampling, and experiments. There was no scientific program during Expedition 321T and no collection of data or samples. Only observatory sealing operations were conducted. Reentry and cementing operations went well, and it appears that the functional objective of this short expedition was achieved. The cones around both observatories were filled completely with cement, and additional cement poured over the edges of the cones and filled the depressions in the seafloor around the cones. We will know if the observatories are sealed hydraulically when researchers return to the observatories with a submersible in August 2009 and download pressure data recording subseafloor conditions.",1,Expedition 321T Preliminary Report

Subsequent remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and submersible expeditions have serviced IODP observatories, collecting pressure and temperature data and fluid and microbiological samples and replacing components as needed to maintain these systems for future use.

borehole observatories,designed to,seal open holes,Introduction,"Borehole observatories installed during Expedition 301 were designed to seal open holes so that thermal, pressure, and chemical conditions could equilibrate following the dissipation of the drilling disturbance; to facilitate collection of fluid and microbiological samples and temperature and pressure data using autonomous samplers and data logging systems; and to serve as long-term monitoring points for large-scale crustal testing (Fisher et al., 2005). Unfortunately, the CORKs installed in IODP Holes U1301A and U1301B were not sealed as intended (Fisher, Urabe, Klaus, et al., 2005), and data and samples collected during subsequent ROV and submersible servicing operations have shown that both observatory systems are leaking.

Site U1301,contains,four nested casing strings,Background,"Both of the Site U1301 boreholes contained four nested casing strings: 0.50 m (diameter = 20 inches) casing in the uppermost sediments, 0.41 m (16 inches) casing extending just across the sediment/basement interface, 0.27 m (10¾ inches) casing extending into basement, and a 0.11 m (4½ inches) inner CORK casing that houses instrument strings and plugs (Fig. F2). The two largest casing strings were sealed by collapse of unconsolidated sediments, and the 0.41 m string was also cemented across the sediment/basement interface. The annulus between 0.41 and 0.27 m casing strings at Site U1301 was supposed to contain a rubber mechanical casing seal near the seafloor, but this component was not available for use during Expedition 301 as planned. An attempt was made to seal the 0.27 m casing strings at depth with cement, but rubbly basement prevented this cement from sealing between the casing and borehole wall. Operations were additionally complicated in Hole U1301B by the separation of the unwelded 0.27 m casing string into two sections, leaving a gap just above the sediment/basement interface (Fig. F2B). The CORK installed in Hole U1301A included a casing packer (as part of the 0.11 m inner casing) that was set inside 0.27 m casing.

This time the reentry target was more challenging: one of eight 12 inch diameter holes in the old style solid CORK platform (Fig. F3B). Reentering through one of these holes required using the cement stinger to push through the steel grating that had been tack-welded in place below the platform during Expedition 301, requiring careful timing and control of weight on bit. The Hole U1301A platform was reentered at 1815 h after only 2¾ h of maneuvering time (Fig. F5). The cone rim at this site was 1.4 mbsf and covered with a layer of fine sediment. Whenever the bit dragged on the platform surface it stirred up a cloud of sediment, obscuring visibility for several minutes.",7,Expedition 321T Preliminary Report
