hotspot tracks,provide,important records of plate motions,Abstract,"Hotspot tracks (quasilinear chains of seamounts, ridges, and other volcanic structures) provid e important records of plate motions, as well as mantle geodynamics, magma flux, and mantl e source compositions. The Tristan-Gough-Walvis Ridge (TGW) hotspot track, extending from th e active volcanic islands of Tristan da Cunha and Gough through a province of guyots and the n along Walvis Ridge to the Etendeka flood basalt province, forms one of the most prominent an d complex global hotspot tracks. The TGW hotspot track displays a tight linear age progression i n which ages increase from the islands to the flood basalts (covering \~135 My). Unlike Pacific tracks, which are simple chains of seamounts that are often compared to chains of pearls, the TGW trac k is alternately a steep-sided narrow ridge, an oceanic plateau, subparallel linear ridges and chains o f seamounts, and areas of what appear to be randomly dispersed seamounts. The track displays isotopic zonation over the last \~70 My. The zonation appears near the middle of the track just befor e it splits into two to three chains of ridge- and guyot-type seamounts. The older ridge is also overprinted with age-progressive late-stage volcanism, which was emplaced \~30–40 My after the initial eruptions and has a distinct isotopic composition.

Expedition 391,proceeded to,drill at four of the proposed sites,Abstract,"After a delay of 18 days to address a shipboard outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) virus, Expedition 391 proceeded to drill at four of the proposed sites: three sites on the easter n Walvis Ridge around Valdivia Bank, an ocean plateau within the ridge, and one site on the lowe r flank of a guyot in the Center track, a ridge located between the Tristan subtrack (which extend s from the end of Walvis Ridge to the island of Tristan da Cunha) and the Gough subtrack (whic h extends from Walvis Ridge to the island of Gough). One hole was drilled at Site U1575, located o n a low portion of the northeastern Walvis Ridge north of Valdivia Bank. At this location, 209.9 m o f sediments and 122.4 m of igneous basement were cored. The latter comprised 10 submarine lav a units consisting of pillow, lobate, sheet, and massive lava flows, the thickest of which was \~21 m. Most lavas are tholeiitic, but some alkalic basalts were recovered. A portion of the igneous succession consists of low-Ti basalts, which are unusual because they appear in the Etendeka floo d basalts but have not been previously found on Walvis Ridge. Two holes were drilled at Site U157 6 on the west flank of Valdivia Bank. The first hole was terminated because a bit jammed shortl y after penetrating igneous basement. Hole U1576A recovered a remarkable \~380 m thick sedimentary section consisting mostly of chalk covering a nearly complete sequence from Paleocene t o Late Cretaceous (Campanian). These sediments display short and long cyclic color changes tha t imply astronomically forced and longer term paleoenvironmental changes. The igneous basemen t yielded 11 submarine lava units ranging from pillows to massive flows, which have composition s varying from tholeiitic basalt to basaltic andesite, the first occurrence of this composition recovered from the TGW track. These units are separated by seven sedimentary chalk units that rang e in thickness from 0.1 to 11.6 m, implying a long-term interplay of sedimentation and lava eruptions. Coring at Site U1577, on the extreme eastern flank of Valdivia Bank, penetrated a 154  m thick sedimentary section, the bottom \~108 m of which is Maastrichtian–Campanian (possibl y Santonian) chalk with vitric tephra layers. Igneous basement coring progressed only 39.1 m belo w the sediment-basalt contact, recovering three massive submarine tholeiite basalt lava flows tha t are 4.1, 15.5, and &gt;19.1 m thick, respectively. Paleomagnetic data from Sites U1577 and U157 6 indicate that their volcanic basements formed just before the end of the Cretaceous Norma l Superchron and during Chron 33r, shortly afterward, respectively. Biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data suggest an east–west age progression across Valdivia Bank, becoming younge r westward. Site U1578, located on a Center track guyot, provided a long and varied igneous section. After coring through 184.3 m of pelagic carbonate sediments mainly consisting of Eocene an d Paleocene chalk, Hole U1578A cored 302.1 m of igneous basement. Basement lavas are largel y pillows but are interspersed with sheet and massive flows. Lava compositions are mostly alkali c basalts with some hawaiite. Several intervals contain abundant olivine, and some of the pillo w stacks consist of basalt with remarkably high Ti content.

One hole was drilled at Site U1575, located o n a low portion of the northeastern Walvis Ridge north of Valdivia Bank. At this location, 209.9 m o f sediments and 122.4 m of igneous basement were cored. The latter comprised 10 submarine lav a units consisting of pillow, lobate, sheet, and massive lava flows, the thickest of which was \~21 m. Most lavas are tholeiitic, but some alkalic basalts were recovered. A portion of the igneous succession consists of low-Ti basalts, which are unusual because they appear in the Etendeka floo d basalts but have not been previously found on Walvis Ridge. Two holes were drilled at Site U157 6 on the west flank of Valdivia Bank. The first hole was terminated because a bit jammed shortl y after penetrating igneous basement. Hole U1576A recovered a remarkable \~380 m thick sedimentary section consisting mostly of chalk covering a nearly complete sequence from Paleocene t o Late Cretaceous (Campanian).

igneous basement at Site U1577,recovered,three massive submarine tholeiite basalt lava flows,Abstract,"After a delay of 18 days to address a shipboard outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) virus, Expedition 391 proceeded to drill at four of the proposed sites: three sites on the easter n Walvis Ridge around Valdivia Bank, an ocean plateau within the ridge, and one site on the lowe r flank of a guyot in the Center track, a ridge located between the Tristan subtrack (which extend s from the end of Walvis Ridge to the island of Tristan da Cunha) and the Gough subtrack (whic h extends from Walvis Ridge to the island of Gough). One hole was drilled at Site U1575, located o n a low portion of the northeastern Walvis Ridge north of Valdivia Bank. At this location, 209.9 m o f sediments and 122.4 m of igneous basement were cored. The latter comprised 10 submarine lav a units consisting of pillow, lobate, sheet, and massive lava flows, the thickest of which was \~21 m. Most lavas are tholeiitic, but some alkalic basalts were recovered. A portion of the igneous succession consists of low-Ti basalts, which are unusual because they appear in the Etendeka floo d basalts but have not been previously found on Walvis Ridge. Two holes were drilled at Site U157 6 on the west flank of Valdivia Bank. The first hole was terminated because a bit jammed shortl y after penetrating igneous basement. Hole U1576A recovered a remarkable \~380 m thick sedimentary section consisting mostly of chalk covering a nearly complete sequence from Paleocene t o Late Cretaceous (Campanian). These sediments display short and long cyclic color changes tha t imply astronomically forced and longer term paleoenvironmental changes. The igneous basemen t yielded 11 submarine lava units ranging from pillows to massive flows, which have composition s varying from tholeiitic basalt to basaltic andesite, the first occurrence of this composition recovered from the TGW track. These units are separated by seven sedimentary chalk units that rang e in thickness from 0.1 to 11.6 m, implying a long-term interplay of sedimentation and lava eruptions. Coring at Site U1577, on the extreme eastern flank of Valdivia Bank, penetrated a 154  m thick sedimentary section, the bottom \~108 m of which is Maastrichtian–Campanian (possibl y Santonian) chalk with vitric tephra layers. Igneous basement coring progressed only 39.1 m belo w the sediment-basalt contact, recovering three massive submarine tholeiite basalt lava flows tha t are 4.1, 15.5, and &gt;19.1 m thick, respectively.

The post-70 Ma volcanis m (called the Guyot Province) can be divided into two distinct tracks of seamounts, one extendin g from the end of Walvis Ridge toward Tristan Island (the Tristan track) and another trendin g toward Gough Island (the Gough track). These two chains are characterized by distinct Pb isotopic compositions, but both have enriched mantle one (EMI)–type geochemistry (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015). This represents the longest-lived hotspot zonation recognized thu s far. Between the two tracks is a ridge called the Center track, but it is not clear whether its isotopi c signature represents mixing of the Tristan and Gough end-members or constitutes a third distinc t geochemical reservoir. The older Walvis Ridge (pre-70 Ma) has a Gough-type EMI composition. Younger guyot-type seamounts with a different high-μ (HIMU) composition overlie the flattopped and faulted Walvis Ridge basement.

TGW track,plays,outsized role in determining absolute motion of African plate,1.  Introduction,"The TGW chain is also an important geodynamic indicator. It is nearly antipodal to the HawaiianEmperor chain, which has been the fodder for debates about the fidelity of seamount chains t o define plate motions relative to the underlying mantle. Two phenomena that can cause hotspo t motion are mantle flow and true polar wander (TPW; the shift of the entire mantle relative to th e spin axis). Because they are nearly antipolar, if there was significant TPW during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, the effect should be a coherent shift with Pacific and Atlantic hotspots (nominally, in the opposite direction from Hawaii). If other phenomena, such as plume motion, are th e cause of TGW chain paleolatitude shifts, it is predicted to be in the same direction as Hawai i (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Moreover, the TGW track is the longest and most continuous on th e African plate, so it plays an outsized role in determining the absolute motion of that plate.

hotspots,fit,new paradigm of plate tectonics,2.1.  Hotspot models and geodynamics,"Early concepts of hotspots were compelling because they seemed to fit nicely with the new paradigm of plate tectonics. Hotspots were explained as a melting anomaly beneath the lithospheri c plates (Wilson, 1963) above a narrow thermal plume arising from the deep mantle (Morgan, 1971, 1972). Eventually, hotspot volcanic chains were widely used as a mantle reference frame (Morgan, 1971, 1972, 1981; Duncan, 1981; Duncan and Clague, 1985; Müller et al., 1993) because the volcanic sources seemed to be fixed relative to the mantle and thus volcanic chains were interpreted a s an indication of absolute plate motion. This view lost favor as studies discovered problems wit h absolute plate motion models. Some studies showed discrepancies between the Pacific and IndoAtlantic hotspot reference frames (Stock and Molnar, 1987; Cande et al., 1995; Raymond et al., 2000). Other studies questioned the fixed hotspot hypothesis because numerical models implie d perturbations by mantle flow (Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998, 2000; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger et al., 2004).

TGW chain,located in,South Atlantic,2.2.  Geologic setting,"The TGW chain, located in the South Atlantic (Figure F1), is one of the most geodynamicall y complex and significant hotspot tracks. It was one of the first proposed plume tracks (Morgan, 1971, 1972) and is considered to have formed by progressive volcanism like Hawaii (O’Connor an d Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a; Homrighausen et al., 2019). It is one of only three hotspot tracks that connect a continental floo d basalt province to active volcanoes (Richards et al., 1989). It is also considered one of only seve n primary (probably from the lower mantle) plumes (Courtillot et al., 2003). Furthermore, it is one o f several South Atlantic hotspots tied to the edge of the Atlantic deep mantle LLSVP, a possibl e plume generation zone (Torsvik et al., 2006; O’Connor et al., 2012; Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019, 2020). Because of its prominence and \~120 My duration (Rohde e t al., 2013b; Homrighausen et al., 2019), Walvis Ridge is a keystone in the Indo-Atlantic hotspo t absolute motion reference frame (e.g., Duncan, 1981; Müller et al., 1993; Doubrovine et al., 2012), but with its geologic complexities and the uncertainty of plumes as fixed mantle markers, the geodynamic implications of the TGW track are unclear. Indeed, some authors posit that the TG W chain was formed by nonhotspot-related volcanism along shear zones and structural weaknesse s (Fairhead and Wilson, 2005; Foulger, 2007). Although many researchers think there is strong evidence that Walvis Ridge was formed by a mantle plume, its complexity contrasts with the simpl e Hawaiian-Emperor chain. The TGW chain forms a narrow ridge near the continent after a shar p bend forms a plateau (Valdivia Bank) and then splits into two or three seamount chains farthe r southwest until it reaches a width of 400 km between the active volcanic island groups of Trista n da Cunha and Gough. This region of guyots and ridge-type seamounts is known as the Guyo t Province. The two outer seamount tracks end in the active volcanic islands (Figure F1). It may b e that the TGW track is an example of a different type of mantle plume, emplaced near a ridg e during its early history and from a more diffuse or multiple upwellings (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2012; Anderson and Natland, 2014; Rohde et al., 2013b). The TGW track also represents the longes t known (\~70 My) geochemically zoned hotspot, and the onset of zonation occurs just before th e morphologic split (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Class et al., 2015). Moreover, th e Valdivia Bank section of Walvis Ridge displays age-progressive secondary volcanism with a distinct isotopic composition (HIMU or high time-integrated 238U/204Pb type) that lags the origina l volcanism by \~30 My, implying a secondary plume (Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2020).

It was one of the first proposed plume tracks (Morgan, 1971, 1972) and is considered to have formed by progressive volcanism like Hawaii (O’Connor an d Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a; Homrighausen et al., 2019). It is one of only three hotspot tracks that connect a continental floo d basalt province to active volcanoes (Richards et al., 1989). It is also considered one of only seve n primary (probably from the lower mantle) plumes (Courtillot et al., 2003). Furthermore, it is one o f several South Atlantic hotspots tied to the edge of the Atlantic deep mantle LLSVP, a possibl e plume generation zone (Torsvik et al., 2006; O’Connor et al., 2012; Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019, 2020). Because of its prominence and \~120 My duration (Rohde e t al., 2013b; Homrighausen et al., 2019), Walvis Ridge is a keystone in the Indo-Atlantic hotspo t absolute motion reference frame (e.g., Duncan, 1981; Müller et al., 1993; Doubrovine et al., 2012), but with its geologic complexities and the uncertainty of plumes as fixed mantle markers, the geodynamic implications of the TGW track are unclear. Indeed, some authors posit that the TG W chain was formed by nonhotspot-related volcanism along shear zones and structural weaknesse s (Fairhead and Wilson, 2005; Foulger, 2007). Although many researchers think there is strong evidence that Walvis Ridge was formed by a mantle plume, its complexity contrasts with the simpl e Hawaiian-Emperor chain. The TGW chain forms a narrow ridge near the continent after a shar p bend forms a plateau (Valdivia Bank) and then splits into two or three seamount chains farthe r southwest until it reaches a width of 400 km between the active volcanic island groups of Trista n da Cunha and Gough. This region of guyots and ridge-type seamounts is known as the Guyo t Province. The two outer seamount tracks end in the active volcanic islands (Figure F1). It may b e that the TGW track is an example of a different type of mantle plume, emplaced near a ridg e during its early history and from a more diffuse or multiple upwellings (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2012; Anderson and Natland, 2014; Rohde et al., 2013b). The TGW track also represents the longes t known (\~70 My) geochemically zoned hotspot, and the onset of zonation occurs just before th e morphologic split (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Class et al., 2015). Moreover, th e Valdivia Bank section of Walvis Ridge displays age-progressive secondary volcanism with a distinct isotopic composition (HIMU or high time-integrated 238U/204Pb type) that lags the origina l volcanism by \~30 My, implying a secondary plume (Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2020).

TGW track,represents,the longest known (~70 My) geochemically zoned hotspot,2.2.  Geologic setting,"The TGW chain, located in the South Atlantic (Figure F1), is one of the most geodynamicall y complex and significant hotspot tracks. It was one of the first proposed plume tracks (Morgan, 1971, 1972) and is considered to have formed by progressive volcanism like Hawaii (O’Connor an d Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a; Homrighausen et al., 2019). It is one of only three hotspot tracks that connect a continental floo d basalt province to active volcanoes (Richards et al., 1989). It is also considered one of only seve n primary (probably from the lower mantle) plumes (Courtillot et al., 2003). Furthermore, it is one o f several South Atlantic hotspots tied to the edge of the Atlantic deep mantle LLSVP, a possibl e plume generation zone (Torsvik et al., 2006; O’Connor et al., 2012; Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019, 2020). Because of its prominence and \~120 My duration (Rohde e t al., 2013b; Homrighausen et al., 2019), Walvis Ridge is a keystone in the Indo-Atlantic hotspo t absolute motion reference frame (e.g., Duncan, 1981; Müller et al., 1993; Doubrovine et al., 2012), but with its geologic complexities and the uncertainty of plumes as fixed mantle markers, the geodynamic implications of the TGW track are unclear. Indeed, some authors posit that the TG W chain was formed by nonhotspot-related volcanism along shear zones and structural weaknesse s (Fairhead and Wilson, 2005; Foulger, 2007). Although many researchers think there is strong evidence that Walvis Ridge was formed by a mantle plume, its complexity contrasts with the simpl e Hawaiian-Emperor chain. The TGW chain forms a narrow ridge near the continent after a shar p bend forms a plateau (Valdivia Bank) and then splits into two or three seamount chains farthe r southwest until it reaches a width of 400 km between the active volcanic island groups of Trista n da Cunha and Gough.

Walvis Ridge,is example of,LIPs formed from a mantle plume,2.2.1.  Evolution of the Walvis Ridge: Rio Grande Rise hotspot twins,"Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise (Figure F2) are considered examples of LIPs formed from  a mantle plume located beneath a spreading ridge (Morgan, 1981; O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; Whittaker et al., 2015). While the plume was beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during the Late Cretaceous, eruptions occurred on both the South American and African plates, forming Rio Grand e Rise and Walvis Ridge (O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; Rohde et al., 2013b). Although the TG W chain appears as a quasilinear ridge and seamount chain, LIP eruptions formed two ocean plateau–size edifices, Valdivia Bank (400 km × 550 km) and Rio Grande Rise Massif (500 km × 95 0 km), at \~80–90 Ma (Rohde et al., 2013b; Homrighausen et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). Th e hotspot and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge separated at \~60–70 Ma, and the hotspot erupted on the African plate thereafter. Consequently, volcanism ceased on the South American plate while linea r seamount chains extended southwest from Walvis Ridge. Since these pioneering studies, author s have tried to fit the TGW chain with hotspot models that have a monotonic age progression (Figure F3) (Duncan, 1981; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Müller et al., 1993; Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012). Such simple hotspot models do a poor job of fitting the complex Walvis Ridg e morphology. In response, authors have resorted to models with multiple hotspots (O’Connor an d le Roex, 1992), moving hotspots (Doubrovine et al., 2012), hotspot-ridge interaction (O’Conno r and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b), and/or distinct plumelets beneath the Tristan and Gough subtrack s (Rohde et al., 2013b) to explain TGW track morphologic changes, but no hotspot model is entirel y satisfactory.

Tristan-Gough-Walvis Ridge (TGW) chain,has morphology,dramatically different from Rio Grande Rise,2.2.1.  Evolution of the Walvis Ridge: Rio Grande Rise hotspot twins,"A further problem with the simple plume hypothesis for the older (pre-70 Ma) portion of th e hotspot track is the dramatically different morphologies of Rio Grande Rise and the TGW chain. Rio Grande Rise contains two subrounded plateaus and a north–south ridge oriented parallel t o the paleo–Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis, whereas Walvis Ridge is a curved linear feature whose morphology changes along its length (Figures F1, F2). Both Rio Grande Rise Massif and the southeastern Rio Grande Rise Massif are split by the prominent northwest–southeast oriented Cruzeiro d o Sul rift. The current explanation for these troughs is a failed Eocene rifting event (Camboa an d Rabinowitz, 1984; Mohriak et al., 2010), which occurred in a midplate setting and has no clea r tectonic cause. A similar rift has been observed at Valdivia Bank (Jimenez Garcia, 2017; Sager e t al., 2021), but its origin is still unknown. Notably, similar rifts are observed at other LIPs such a s the Manihiki Plateau (Danger Island and Suvorov Troughs) (Nakanishi et al., 2015).

Tristan-Gough-Walvis (TGW) chain,has few,paleomagnetic data,2.2.6.  Paleolatitude changes for the Tristan-Gough-Walvis hotspot,"There are few paleomagnetic data from the TGW chain, so we must look to continental paleomagnetic data. Such data imply significant paleolatitude changes for the TGW chain over the pas t 120 My (Figure F7) (Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012). Between the mid-Cretaceou s and early Cenozoic, there was a rapid southward paleolatitude shift, totaling \~18°–20°, from \~10°– 12° north to \~5°–7° south of the current hotspot latitude. This was followed by slow drift northward to the current latitude. These trends are unexpected because they are not predicted b y hotspot models. The total \~20° of northward motion implied by Walvis Ridge (Figure F7) can b e explained by the \~7° southward motion of the hotspot and the \~13° northward motion of the African plate relative to the mantle (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Although this is one model, other moving-hotspot models give similar results (O’Neill et al., 2005; Torsvik et al., 2008), and no mantl e flow models predict northward motion of the hotspot as implied by Cenozoic paleomagnetic data. The difference between the absolute plate motion model and observed paleomagnetic data i s interpreted as TPW (Doubrovine et al., 2012), which may account for both the rapid southwar d shift during the Cretaceous and the northward Cenozoic shift (Figure F7).",10,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

dredging,limits,geochemical observations,2.3.1.  Geochemistry and isotopic zonation,"Geochemical observations are limited by dredging because we do not know the stratigraphic relationship between different samples in a dredge. Dredges also generally only sample exposed unit s and thus often don’t provide more than a single composition (e.g., same lava flow sampled multipl e times) for individual dredge sites, in this case representing only a single point in compositiona l space. In contrast, sampling of the islands and DSDP Site 527 showed a compositional range (Figure F10, black outlines), representing (temporal/downhole) geochemical variability (e.g., Salter s and Sachi-Kocher, 2010). The potentially triple-zoned TGW plume can possibly be described by  a set of five linear binary mixing arrays in 3D Pb isotopic space, four of which are defined by array s of island or drill site samples, namely Gough (forms two arrays), Tristan-Inaccessible, and DSD P Sites 527 and 528 (Figure F10). Only new drill cores can provide sufficient data to test whethe r there is indeed a geochemically distinct Center track (green in Figures F8, F9, F10, F11) (Class e t al., 2014, 2015) or it simply reflects a mixture the two outer (Tristan and Gough) geochemica l domains, as is also possible for the central track identified in the Galápagos hotspot track (Hoernl e et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003). Furthermore, detailed isotopic studies, including isotopes of Os, rare gases, and other isotope systems for which appropriate material has not yet been recovered b y dredging, could provide evidence that the Center track lavas are derived from a distinct sourc e that cannot be explained by mixing of Tristan and Gough compositional end-members. As note d above, isotope data for the different units at a drill site can form arrays on isotope diagrams, whic h could help distinguish between the aforementioned possibilities. If the arrays from different site s extend from the Gough to Tristan compositional domain, then mixing of Tristan and Gough is th e more likely origin of the central domain. If the central samples form an array that is subparallel t o the Tristan and Gough domains, or if additional isotope systems show that the central domain ha s a composition that cannot be explained by mixing of Gough and Tristan compositions, this woul d argue for a distinct intermediate third domain. Most present models of plume zonation attribut e the zonation to sampling of the LLSVP margin by part of the plume base and sampling of th e ambient mantle surrounding the LLSVP. In the simplest case, this should result in two geochemically distinct compositional fields that are not directly related. Evidence for an additional geochemical zone would place this simple model into question, requiring the presence of three o r more distinct chemical reservoirs at the plume base (Lohmann et al., 2009). Zonation of the Discovery plume, with distinct zones of Gough-type material in the north and even more enriche d and distinct EMI-type material in the south (but no evidence of the Tristan composition), indicates that the model proposed thus far to explain Tristan-Gough zonation may be too simpl e (Schwindrofska et al., 2016). If the Gough and Tristan tracks share a common end-member (e.g., low 206Pb/204Pb), defined by the intersection of three main geographic arrays (Figure F10), thi s could also call into question the simple model that the LLSVP is the global cause for plume zonation because it would imply that all three TGW zones share at least one common end-member.",1,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

Furthermore, detailed isotopic studies, including isotopes of Os, rare gases, and other isotope systems for which appropriate material has not yet been recovered b y dredging, could provide evidence that the Center track lavas are derived from a distinct sourc e that cannot be explained by mixing of Tristan and Gough compositional end-members. As note d above, isotope data for the different units at a drill site can form arrays on isotope diagrams, whic h could help distinguish between the aforementioned possibilities. If the arrays from different site s extend from the Gough to Tristan compositional domain, then mixing of Tristan and Gough is th e more likely origin of the central domain. If the central samples form an array that is subparallel t o the Tristan and Gough domains, or if additional isotope systems show that the central domain ha s a composition that cannot be explained by mixing of Gough and Tristan compositions, this woul d argue for a distinct intermediate third domain. Most present models of plume zonation attribut e the zonation to sampling of the LLSVP margin by part of the plume base and sampling of th e ambient mantle surrounding the LLSVP. In the simplest case, this should result in two geochemically distinct compositional fields that are not directly related. Evidence for an additional geochemical zone would place this simple model into question, requiring the presence of three o r more distinct chemical reservoirs at the plume base (Lohmann et al., 2009). Zonation of the Discovery plume, with distinct zones of Gough-type material in the north and even more enriche d and distinct EMI-type material in the south (but no evidence of the Tristan composition), indicates that the model proposed thus far to explain Tristan-Gough zonation may be too simpl e (Schwindrofska et al., 2016). If the Gough and Tristan tracks share a common end-member (e.g., low 206Pb/204Pb), defined by the intersection of three main geographic arrays (Figure F10), thi s could also call into question the simple model that the LLSVP is the global cause for plume zonation because it would imply that all three TGW zones share at least one common end-member.",1,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

olivine-bearing volcanic rocks,are commonly recovered,by previous scientific drilling,2.3.1.  Geochemistry and isotopic zonation,"Previous scientific drilling has demonstrated that fresh olivine-bearing volcanic rocks and glas s are commonly recovered. Olivines and volcanic glass are highly susceptible to alteration by seawater contact, and thus dredging rarely retrieves such samples, in particular fresh olivine. Fres h glass can provide the liquid composition and preserve accurate abundances of volatile elements, such as H2O, S, and Cl. Fresh olivines can be used for a variety of analytical purposes, includin g analyses of He isotopes to test for high 3He/4He and thus a lower mantle origin of the material an d to constrain further the degassing history of the Earth (Class and Goldstein, 2005; Tolstikhin an d Hofmann, 2005; Jackson and Carlson, 2011). Thus far, high 3He/4He ratios above MORB value s (&gt;10 R/Ra) have not been found along the Tristan-Gough hotspot track. In contrast to the othe major plumes that show bilateral zonation (Hawaii, Galápagos, and Samoa), no high 3He/4He signature has been identified for the TGW chain. High 3He/4He isotope ratios, however, have bee n found in samples with Gough-type Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions where the Discovery an d Shona hotspots are interacting with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sarda et al., 2000). If high He isotopi c ratios are found in olivines from drill samples along the TGW hotspot track, they could hel p unravel which components may be derived from the LLSVP. Olivine can also provide importan t information about the contents of primitive (early and deeply trapped) volatile elements in mel t inclusions and of the composition of primitive and in some cases possibly primary melts. They ca n be used to determine O isotopes to evaluate the involvement of continental material in the sourc e of the magmas, which has been postulated for the EMI signature found in Walvis Ridge lavas. Finally, olivine chemistry can help determine the source lithology, constraining the relative role o f pyroxenite versus peridotite in the source of oceanic basalts. This will allow for the assessment o f the role of recycled oceanic crust in plume sources and thus provide insights into the geodynami c evolution of Earth’s mantle (Sobolev et al., 2005).",16,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

Valdivia Bank,is proposed as,"a continental fragment (van der Linden, 1980)",4.1.2.  Does Valdivia Bank contain a continental fragment?,"Although no longer widely accepted, it has been proposed that Valdivia Bank is a continental fragment (van der Linden, 1980).

Furthermore, the same has been suggested for Rio Grande Ris e (Santos et al., 2019), so the idea cannot yet be dismissed. Coring on Valdivia Bank can help test thi s idea, either through direct drilling of continental rocks or by showing continental crustal contamination in the geochemistry of the recovered rocks or as xenocrysts (e.g., quartz or zircon) o r xenoliths of continental crust.

Site U1575,is located within,a low saddle on the northeastern end of Walvis Ridge,5.1.1.  Background and objectives,"Site U1575 (proposed Site FR-1B) is located within a low saddle on the northeastern end of Walvi s Ridge between the higher Frio Ridge (near the continental margin) and Valdivia Bank, a larg e ocean plateau edifice (Figures F1, F12, F13). This site was chosen as the eastern (older) end of th e Expedition 391 transect because it represented an opportunity to sample a part of the ridge tha t cannot be sampled by dredging due to sediment cover (Figure F13). It also represents the hotspo t trail shortly after it passed from the African continental margin to oceanic crust. Trace elemen t and isotopic geochemistry can provide insights into the transition from the plume head to plum e tail stage of hotspots, specifically whether both high-TiO2 (Gough-type) and low-TiO2 (Dorostype) basalts are present in the plume tail, as has been found in the Etendeka (and Parana) floo d basalts (plume head stage) (Zhou et al., 2020). Furthermore, does the Tristan signature, which i s found in the younger chain (seamount chain going from Walvis Ridge DSDP Site 527 to Tristan d a Cunha Island), appear in the older portion of the ridge, extending the geochemical zonation of th e hotspot track further back in time? The drill cores provided samples that show the eruption age o f the main TGW hotspot track in an area that is often overprinted with late-stage volcanism. Furthermore, Site U1575 provided paleomagnetic samples for a time when the hotspot is predicted t o have been \~5° north of its current paleolatitude and when the paleolatitude was rapidly changing. The site also recovered sediments deposited near the Benguela Current in a regime that is transitional from continental margin siliciclastic to open-ocean pelagic carbonate deposition, whic h could reveal past marine environmental conditions.",22,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

Thi s basement was divided into 10 igneous units, beginning with a succession of four massive submarine flows (Figure F15). Overall, the eruptive style comprised an alternating sequence of submarine lavas involving massive flows (up to 21 m thick), individual sheet flows, and stacks of pillo w and lobate lavas (Figure F15). All of these units consist of aphanitic to intersertal to holocrystallin e basalt with phenocrysts and glomerocrysts of plagioclase (3%–15%) and clinopyroxene (1%–5%). Olivine is sparse and only intermittently present (0%–3%) and is completely altered in \~50% of th e lavas. The igneous units show significant overlap in mineralogy but may be summarized as follows: massive flow Subunits 1a and 1b (8.04 m thick) and 2a and 2b (18.08 m thick) consist of pair s of highly plagioclase-pyroxene ± olivine phyric, holocrystalline basaltic lava flows separated by  a glassy margin. Subunits 3a–3d present a change of eruptive behavior and consist of 12.87 m o f intercalated succession of sheet flows, lobate flows, and pillow lavas (i.e., pillow lava stack). Moda l compositions vary from sparsely to highly plagioclase-pyroxene-olivine phyric. Basaltic glass an d altered aphanitic material are found in pillow rims and flow boundaries. Unit 4 is a 10.69 m thic k massive basalt flow with sparse to moderate plagioclase and pyroxene phenocryst abundance, including sparse olivine. Underlying Unit 5, a thick (15.00 m) succession of pillow lavas show s numerous glassy margins.

At the bottom of Hole U1575A, Subunits 10a (5.06 m) and 10b (13.31 m) consist of one massiv e flow each, separated by chilled margins. They are moderately phyric and consist of variable proportions of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine with glomerophyric and holocrystalline textures. Alteration in the igneous basement is due to ambient low-temperature seafloor processes. Oxidative alteration likely occurred shortly after eruption as cooling lava units were subjected to seawater ingress, aided by the development of cooling fractures in the brittle outer flow crust, leadin g to calcite precipitation in fractures. Alteration intensity is slight to occasionally moderate throughout, with centers of thicker flows presenting near-fresh primary minerals (except for olivine). Lowtemperature alteration is also reflected by carbonate vein networks, which vary in thickness an d orientation.

An alkalinity maximum was identified at 1 5 mbsf. Slightly below this depth, at 25–30 mbsf, maxima for Ca, K, Sr, and Si and minima for M g and Li concentrations were observed. These features are attributable to diageneses of biogenic carbonates and silica. A Mn reduction interval was found at the shallow depth of 10 mbsf. Because o f the hiatus between Lithostratigraphic Units I and II, no signs of interaction between basaltic basement and Lithostratigraphic Unit I were observed, and profiles of many elemental concentration s remained uniform between 50 and 200 mbsf.

Site U1576,is located on,middle west flank of Valdivia Bank,5.2.1.  Background and objectives,"Site U1576 (proposed Site VB-14A) is located on the middle west flank of Valdivia Bank, the broa d oceanic plateau that is part of Walvis Ridge (Figures F1, F16, F17, F18). The site was chosen t o obtain samples from buried igneous basement in a location that can only be sampled by drillin g (Figure F18). Valdivia Bank represents a poorly understood edifice of Walvis Ridge that may hav e formed by interaction with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge or a microplate that formed by a plate boundary reorganization. Radiometric age dating is planned to determine the age of the igneous basement at this site. Along with other drill site sampling of Valdivia Bank, age dating will enable us t o test whether there is a north–south age progression, as predicted by hotspot models, or an east– west age progression, as predicted by spreading ridge-formation models. The petrology and geochemistry of the basement basalt samples should elucidate the petrogenesis and mantle sources o f these magmas, including whether the isotopic zonation observed at the DSDP Leg 74 transect,  a few hundred kilometers to the southwest, continues to Valdivia Bank. Paleomagnetic data fro m sediment and basalt samples will help determine the paleolatitude of the hotspot during the lat e Cretaceous. Sediments recovered at Site U1576 will help constrain the age and evolution of th e plateau and provide insights into the paleoenvironmental trends of the midwater column of th e South Atlantic.",29,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

Seven sedimentary interbeds (S1–S7),recovered as,intercalations within the volcanic basement in Hole U1576B,5.2.3.1.  Sedimentology,"Seven sedimentary interbeds (S1–S7) of variable thickness (\~0.8–11.7 m) recovered as intercalations within the volcanic basement in Hole U1576B are a downhole continuation of the lithologies retrieved in the lower sedimentary cover above the uppermost basalt lava (Unit IV). Sedimentation is similarly dominated by pelagic deposition of gray bioturbated foraminiferanannofossil chalk with clay with thin interbeds of calcareous to volcaniclastic turbidites. Locally, lava-sediment interaction led to formation of peperites and hydrothermal alteration of both basal t and sediment.

The igneous basement at Sit e U1576 represents Lithostratigraphic Unit V in the overall subseafloor succession, and the tw o holes are stratigraphically correlated (Figure F20). Hole U1576A penetrated 12.62 m of igneou s basement, recovering 7.56 m (\~60%), and consists entirely of basalt. Two igneous units are identified in Hole U1576A (Figure F20). The first unit is a sheet flow (1.97 m), and the second uni t consists of pillow basalt, in which the hole terminates at 10.65 m cored thickness. The lavas rang e from glassy and aphanitic to holocrystalline and intersertal. Fresh glass is present in the pillo w sequence and on the tops of some sheet flows. The lavas are slightly vesicular with small (\~1 mm ) round vesicles and, when phenocrysts are present, are highly phyric (plagioclase = 9%–12%; clinopyroxene = 6%–8%). Hole U1576B penetrated 64.9 m of igneous basement, recovering 51.48  m (\~79%), consisting of 32.79 m of basalt and 18.69 m of intercalated chalk and turbidite horizon s (Figure F20). Hole U1576B terminates within a sheet flow with a minimum thickness of 2.56 m.

Massive and sheet flows contai n both plagioclase and clinopyroxene glomerocrysts and phenocrysts in an intersertal groundmass, showing higher phenocryst abundances (8%) in the center of the flows. Pillow lavas contain plagioclase and clinopyroxene microlites and small glomerocrysts in their glassy rims. Olivine occur s infrequently (&lt;1%) and is completely altered. Seriate textures are common in massive lava interiors, whereas clear porphyritic textures are found closer to flow boundaries.

The first unit is a sheet flow (1.97 m), and the second uni t consists of pillow basalt, in which the hole terminates at 10.65 m cored thickness. The lavas rang e from glassy and aphanitic to holocrystalline and intersertal. Fresh glass is present in the pillo w sequence and on the tops of some sheet flows. The lavas are slightly vesicular with small (\~1 mm ) round vesicles and, when phenocrysts are present, are highly phyric (plagioclase = 9%–12%; clinopyroxene = 6%–8%). Hole U1576B penetrated 64.9 m of igneous basement, recovering 51.48  m (\~79%), consisting of 32.79 m of basalt and 18.69 m of intercalated chalk and turbidite horizon s (Figure F20).

Massive and sheet flows contai n both plagioclase and clinopyroxene glomerocrysts and phenocrysts in an intersertal groundmass, showing higher phenocryst abundances (8%) in the center of the flows. Pillow lavas contain plagioclase and clinopyroxene microlites and small glomerocrysts in their glassy rims. Olivine occur s infrequently (&lt;1%) and is completely altered. Seriate textures are common in massive lava interiors, whereas clear porphyritic textures are found closer to flow boundaries. Fresh glass is presen t at some flow margins, but it is mostly altered and replaced by clay minerals. The lavas are dominantly nonvesicular to slightly vesicular, except for the pillow lavas of Unit 2, which are moderatel y to highly vesicular with vesicles filled by secondary minerals. Alteration in the basalt lava successions in both holes at Site U1576 is significant and pervasive at the tops and bottoms of lava flow s and throughout the interiors of small flows; only the larger massive flow cores contain near-fres h igneous minerals.

The igneous basement at Sit e U1576 represents Lithostratigraphic Unit V in the overall subseafloor succession, and the tw o holes are stratigraphically correlated (Figure F20). Hole U1576A penetrated 12.62 m of igneou s basement, recovering 7.56 m (\~60%), and consists entirely of basalt. Two igneous units are identified in Hole U1576A (Figure F20). The first unit is a sheet flow (1.97 m), and the second uni t consists of pillow basalt, in which the hole terminates at 10.65 m cored thickness. The lavas rang e from glassy and aphanitic to holocrystalline and intersertal. Fresh glass is present in the pillo w sequence and on the tops of some sheet flows. The lavas are slightly vesicular with small (\~1 mm ) round vesicles and, when phenocrysts are present, are highly phyric (plagioclase = 9%–12%; clinopyroxene = 6%–8%). Hole U1576B penetrated 64.9 m of igneous basement, recovering 51.48  m (\~79%), consisting of 32.79 m of basalt and 18.69 m of intercalated chalk and turbidite horizon s (Figure F20). Hole U1576B terminates within a sheet flow with a minimum thickness of 2.56 m.

Massive and sheet flows contai n both plagioclase and clinopyroxene glomerocrysts and phenocrysts in an intersertal groundmass, showing higher phenocryst abundances (8%) in the center of the flows. Pillow lavas contain plagioclase and clinopyroxene microlites and small glomerocrysts in their glassy rims. Olivine occur s infrequently (&lt;1%) and is completely altered. Seriate textures are common in massive lava interiors, whereas clear porphyritic textures are found closer to flow boundaries.

Hole U1577A,terminates,within a massive basalt flow with a minimum thickness of 19.07 m,5.3.3.2.  Igneous petrology and volcanology,"Hole U1577A penetrated 39.1 m of igneous basement, recovering 28.0 m of igneous rocks (80% ) representing Lithostratigraphic Unit IV in the overall subseafloor succession (Figure F24). Hol e U1577A terminates within a massive basalt flow with a minimum thickness of 19.07 m. Igneou s basement was intersected in Sections 391-U1577A-18R-1 through 26R-1. The volcanic successio n consists of a single unit (Igneous Unit 1) made up of highly phyric basalt that is divided into thre e subunits (i.e., massive lava flows) based on features which identify flow boundaries (Figure F24). All subunits are porphyritic, although the groundmass texture grades to aphanitic adjacent to flo w boundaries. The uppermost subunit contains a glassy rim in contact with the overlying pelagi c sediment. The phenocryst proportion amounts to \~18% in the massive flows, with \~15% plagioclase, 2%–5% pyroxene, and 0%–3% olivine. The lavas are slightly vesicular and contain roun d vesicles that are 1–2 mm in diameter and filled with at least one secondary mineral (e.g., clay, calcite, and/or zeolite). Groundmass in flow interiors consists of fine- to medium-grained clinopyroxene and plagioclase in subophitic textures, often showing late-stage crystallization after olivine and plagioclase. In flow interiors, the groundmass has a seriate texture and coarse crystal siz e distribution that approaches that of the phenocrysts. Mesostasis (quenched melt) forms irregula r globules that consist of microcrystalline plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides. The flo w margins consist of plagioclase-clinopyroxene-olivine phyric basalt. Plagioclase is still the dominant phenocryst phase in the form of similarly blocky or tabular glomerocrysts (up to 2.4 mm i n size) but with much lower abundance than in flow interiors (\~5%). Olivine (altered to saponite ) and clinopyroxene are less common and form small anhedral grains (up to 0.6 mm). The groundmass in samples from flow margins is markedly distinct from flow interiors: plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti-oxides are very fine grained, showing intergranular textures. Plagioclas e forms small needle-like skeletal crystals (&lt;0.4 mm), whereas clinopyroxene (&lt;0.08 mm) form s small blocky crystals.

Discolored halos,extend,2–4 cm away from calcite- and Fe oxyhydroxide-filled fractures and veins,5.3.3.2.  Igneous petrology and volcanology,"Hole U1577A penetrated 39.1 m of igneous basement, recovering 28.0 m of igneous rocks (80% ) representing Lithostratigraphic Unit IV in the overall subseafloor succession (Figure F24). Hol e U1577A terminates within a massive basalt flow with a minimum thickness of 19.07 m. Igneou s basement was intersected in Sections 391-U1577A-18R-1 through 26R-1. The volcanic successio n consists of a single unit (Igneous Unit 1) made up of highly phyric basalt that is divided into thre e subunits (i.e., massive lava flows) based on features which identify flow boundaries (Figure F24). All subunits are porphyritic, although the groundmass texture grades to aphanitic adjacent to flo w boundaries. The uppermost subunit contains a glassy rim in contact with the overlying pelagi c sediment. The phenocryst proportion amounts to \~18% in the massive flows, with \~15% plagioclase, 2%–5% pyroxene, and 0%–3% olivine. The lavas are slightly vesicular and contain roun d vesicles that are 1–2 mm in diameter and filled with at least one secondary mineral (e.g., clay, calcite, and/or zeolite). Groundmass in flow interiors consists of fine- to medium-grained clinopyroxene and plagioclase in subophitic textures, often showing late-stage crystallization after olivine and plagioclase. In flow interiors, the groundmass has a seriate texture and coarse crystal siz e distribution that approaches that of the phenocrysts. Mesostasis (quenched melt) forms irregula r globules that consist of microcrystalline plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides. The flo w margins consist of plagioclase-clinopyroxene-olivine phyric basalt. Plagioclase is still the dominant phenocryst phase in the form of similarly blocky or tabular glomerocrysts (up to 2.4 mm i n size) but with much lower abundance than in flow interiors (\~5%). Olivine (altered to saponite ) and clinopyroxene are less common and form small anhedral grains (up to 0.6 mm). The groundmass in samples from flow margins is markedly distinct from flow interiors: plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti-oxides are very fine grained, showing intergranular textures.

For the determinations of major and trace elements, seven samples were analyze d using ICP-AES. Additionally, 158 measurements were conducted on archive-half section piece s using pXRF spectrometry. LOI represents an indicator for the degree of alteration, and the analyzed samples show a low LOI of &lt;1.35 wt%. Overall, Site U1577 samples are extremely homogeneous, showing limited geochemical variation downhole that is less variable in composition tha n the other Valdivia Bank sites (U1575 and U1576).

The site, situated on the Center track ridge between the Tristan an d Gough hotspot tracks, was chosen because the erupted lavas are either likely to be a mixture o f Tristan- and Gough-type components or constitute a distinct third isotopic signature. A majo r objective for this site is to measure the geochemical composition of samples from a deep downhole section of lava flows. The geochemistry should offer clues to the magma source and evolutio n of the Center track ridge. Although there are already many radiometric dates for Walvis Ridg e seamounts, samples from Site U1578 help fill gaps in prior sampling. The expected age for Sit e U1578 basement is a propitious time for understanding the paleolatitude changes of the TG W hotspot because global paleomagnetic data sets suggest that the paleolatitude for the latest Cretaceous and earliest Paleocene TGW hotspot location was south of its current latitude, implyin g northward motion. In contrast, hotspot drift models imply the opposite sense of motion. Moreover, the sense of motion may be opposite to the Hawaiian hotspot, which would confirm TPW.

Lithostratigraphic intervals,based on,physical properties measurements,5.4.3.6.  Physical properties,"Three general lithostratigraphic intervals are identified in Hole U1578A based on physical properties measurements, including NGR, MS/point magnetic susceptibility (MSP), bulk density, thermal conductivity, P-wave velocity, and porosity. The first interval, consisting of calcareous ooz e and chalk, may be further divided into upper and lower units based upon NGR, GRA, and MA D bulk density, and MS/MSP values. At \~30 mbsf, a pronounced increase in MS/MSP (up to 79.3  × 10−5 SI from background of \~2.68 × 10−5 to \~7.23 × 10−5 SI) and NGR (up to \~19.5 counts/s from  a background range of \~2.25 to \~4.14 counts/s) and a decrease in GRA/MAD bulk density (fro m \~1.87 to \~1.74 g/cm2 across the unit contact) define the boundary between Lithostratigraphi c Unit I and Subunit IIA. Below \~184 mbsf, calcareous sediment-basalt contact, basalt units, an d volcaniclastic interbeds are distinguished by porosity (\~34.1 and \~58.3 vol% in volcaniclasti c interbeds vs. \~6.29 and \~15.6 vol% in basalts) and thermal conductivity (1.05 to 1.33 W/[m·K] i n volcanic clastic interbeds vs. 1.66 to 1.77 W/[m·K] in basalts). Increases in MS/MSP, P-wave velocity, and GRA/MAD bulk density also accompany the shift from volcaniclastic interbeds to basal t units.

Olivine-phyric lava flows correlate to higher (&gt;3000 × 10−5 SI) MS/MS P at \~218 and \~253 mbsf, and an anomalously high NGR count at \~270 mbsf appears to correlate t o a high-potassium aphyric basalt at the same depth.",49,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

The Valdivia Bank is thought to have formed b y hotspot-ridge interaction within a short period of time when the hotspot was located at the MidAtlantic Ridge (O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b). Moreover, th e edifice may have formed at the edge of a microplate, which led to simultaneous volcanism over  a large area (Thoram et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). This differs from the traditional hotspot mode l with a linear age progression along the ridge, which suggests a significant age difference betwee n the northern and southern ends of Valdivia Bank. Expedition 391 recovered many fresh basal t samples from three sites on Valdivia Bank (U1575–U1577), which should allow precise radiometric ages to be determined. Preliminary results from first descriptions of core material are quit e interesting. The magnetic anomaly map of Thoram (2021) predicts that Site U1576 is in th e reversed magnetic polarity zone of Chron C33r, whereas Site U1577 is located in the norma l polarity zone of the Cretaceous Long Normal Superchron (Chron C34n). Drilling results bear thi s out, with basement at U1576 having reversed polarity and basement at Site U1577 having norma l polarity. Indeed, at the latter site, the reversed Chron C33r is found in sediments just above basement. These findings suggest that the magnetic anomaly interpretation is correct and that there i s a slight younging of basement from east to west. In addition, Site U1575 basement is also of normal polarity from the Cretaceous Long Normal Superchron, but microfossil dating indicates tha t the sediments resting on basement are Campanian in age, similar to Sites U1576 and U1577, located farther south. This is strikingly different from the expected age of \~105 Ma based on th e age progression.

Expedition 391 recovered many fresh basal t samples from three sites on Valdivia Bank (U1575–U1577), which should allow precise radiometric ages to be determined. Preliminary results from first descriptions of core material are quit e interesting. The magnetic anomaly map of Thoram (2021) predicts that Site U1576 is in th e reversed magnetic polarity zone of Chron C33r, whereas Site U1577 is located in the norma l polarity zone of the Cretaceous Long Normal Superchron (Chron C34n). Drilling results bear thi s out, with basement at U1576 having reversed polarity and basement at Site U1577 having norma l polarity. Indeed, at the latter site, the reversed Chron C33r is found in sediments just above basement. These findings suggest that the magnetic anomaly interpretation is correct and that there i s a slight younging of basement from east to west. In addition, Site U1575 basement is also of normal polarity from the Cretaceous Long Normal Superchron, but microfossil dating indicates tha t the sediments resting on basement are Campanian in age, similar to Sites U1576 and U1577, located farther south. This is strikingly different from the expected age of \~105 Ma based on th e age progression. It may be that there is simply a hiatus of \~20 My at the basement interface, but i f geochronology studies confirmed the younger age, it would indicate widespread simultaneous volcanism, as suggested by ridge-plume interaction and microplate models.",51,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

The TGW hotspot is believed t o have interacted with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during formation of the Walvis Ridge (O’Connor an d Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a; Whittaker et al., 2015). Valdivia Bank, which form s part of the Walvis Ridge, is an ocean plateau apparently formed at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

Preliminary data, for example, lowe r incompatible element abundances than for magmas in the Guyot Province (regardless of MgO o r SiO2 content), indicate that Valdivia Bank lavas are more like MORB than other places on th e TGW hotspot track, implying larger degrees of melting and a contribution from depleted uppe r mantle.

Other studies have interprete d continental components from isotopic compositions and modeling (Torsvik et al., 2015) or fro m finding ancient zircons embedded in the rocks (Torsvik et al., 2013). Samples amenable to bot h types of study were cored from Valdivia Bank, but they will take time to analyze. Prior to the expedition, it was considered unlikely that this question would be answered.",5,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report
sediments,recovered from,Walvis Ridge sites,6.2.  Other scientific results and surprises,"Although not a priority for Expedition 391 research, it was nonetheless recognized that sediment s recovered from the Walvis Ridge sites can provide important records of paleoceanographic conditions and changes. The sedimentary section in Hole U1576A yielded a thick succession of Paleocene and Late Cretaceous sediments. Moreover, these sediments display color cycles that sugges t astronomically forced climate changes and broad changes in ocean chemistry (e.g., shifting fro m oxic to anoxic conditions). This section is fodder for paleoceanographic studies, and because i t implies that Valdivia Bank has thick sections of easily cored Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoi c sediment, it may well inspire future drilling proposals.",54,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report

The goal of these materials is not only to immerse students in the science of Expedition 391 but also to make scienc e accessible for students whose demographics are historically underrepresented in the field. Thes e resources include a video compiled of several interviews with a diverse group of scientists discussing their paths to success in the field, lessons to help students develop fundamental science skills, and inquiry-based investigations to engage students in an authentic process of science. The lessons will be fully digital, allowing teachers to modify them as necessary to fit their students’ needs, and they will be appropriate for the postpandemic classroom.",56,Expedition 391 Preliminary Report
