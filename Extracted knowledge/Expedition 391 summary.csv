hotspot tracks,provide,important records of plate motions,Abstract,"Hotspot tracks (chains of seamounts, ridges, and other volcanic structures) provide important records of plate motions, as well as mantle geodynamics, magma flux, and mantle source compositions. The Tristan-Gough-Walvis Ridge (TGW) hotspot track, extending from the active volcanic islands of Tristan da Cunha and Gough through a province of guyots and then along Walvis Ridge to the Etendeka flood basalt province, forms one of the most prominent and complex global hotspot tracks. The TGW hotspot track displays a tight linear age progression in which ages increase from the islands to the flood basalts (covering \~135 My). Unlike Pacific tracks, which are often simple, nearly linear chains of seamounts, the TGW track is alternately a steep-sided narrow ridge, an oceanic plateau, subparallel linear ridges and chains of seamounts (most are flat-topped guyots). The track displays isotopic zonation over the last \~70 My. The zonation appears near the middle of the track just before it splits into two to three chains of ridge- and guyot-type seamounts. Walvis Ridge, forming the older part of the track, is also overprinted with age-progressive late-stage volcanism, which was emplaced \~30–40 My after the initial eruptions and has a distinct isotopic composition. The plan for Expedition 391 was to drill at six sites, three along Walvis Ridge and three in the seamounts of the Guyot Province, to collect igneous rocks to better understand the formation of volcanic edifices, the temporal and geochemical evolution of the hotspot, and the variation in paleolatitudes at which the volcanic edifices formed.",1,Expedition 391 summary

Later, during Expedition 397T,  a transit from Cape Town to Lisbon, an opportunity arose to regain some of the lost drilling time. The two omitted sites in the Guyot Province were cored, penetrating to basaltic crust in one.",4,Expedition 391 summary

hotspots,fit,new paradigm of plate tectonics,2.1.  Hotspot models and geodynamics,"Early concepts of hotspots were compelling because they seemed to fit nicely with the new paradigm of plate tectonics. Hotspots were explained as a melting anomaly beneath the lithospheri c plates (Wilson, 1963) above a narrow thermal plume arising from the deep mantle (Morgan, 1971, 1972). Eventually, hotspot volcanic chains were widely used as a mantle reference frame (Morgan, 1971, 1972, 1981; Duncan, 1981; Duncan and Clague, 1985; Müller et al., 1993) because the volcanic sources seemed to be fixed within the mantle and thus volcanic chains were interpreted as a n indication of absolute plate motion. This view lost favor as studies discovered problems with absolute plate motion models. Some studies showed discrepancies between the Pacific and IndoAtlantic hotspot reference frames (Stock and Molnar, 1987; Cande et al., 1995; Raymond et al., 2000). Other studies questioned the fixed hotspot hypothesis because numerical models implie d perturbations by mantle flow (Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998, 2000; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger et al., 2004). Paleolatitude data showed significant latitudinal motion of the Hawaiia n hotspot (Tarduno and Cottrell, 1997; Tarduno et al., 2003) in contrast with limited motion for th e Louisville hotspot (Koppers et al., 2012).

plume hypothesis,debated,"number, composition, sources, mobility, structure, and geodynamic implications",2.1.  Hotspot models and geodynamics,"Early concepts of hotspots were compelling because they seemed to fit nicely with the new paradigm of plate tectonics. Hotspots were explained as a melting anomaly beneath the lithospheri c plates (Wilson, 1963) above a narrow thermal plume arising from the deep mantle (Morgan, 1971, 1972). Eventually, hotspot volcanic chains were widely used as a mantle reference frame (Morgan, 1971, 1972, 1981; Duncan, 1981; Duncan and Clague, 1985; Müller et al., 1993) because the volcanic sources seemed to be fixed within the mantle and thus volcanic chains were interpreted as a n indication of absolute plate motion. This view lost favor as studies discovered problems with absolute plate motion models. Some studies showed discrepancies between the Pacific and IndoAtlantic hotspot reference frames (Stock and Molnar, 1987; Cande et al., 1995; Raymond et al., 2000). Other studies questioned the fixed hotspot hypothesis because numerical models implie d perturbations by mantle flow (Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998, 2000; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger et al., 2004). Paleolatitude data showed significant latitudinal motion of the Hawaiia n hotspot (Tarduno and Cottrell, 1997; Tarduno et al., 2003) in contrast with limited motion for th e Louisville hotspot (Koppers et al., 2012). Simultaneously, other authors questioned the plum e model and the role of plumes in mantle convection (Foulger, 2005, 2007). The result was a shift o f consensus from fixed to mobile hotspots.

TGW chain,located in,South Atlantic,2.2.  Geologic setting,"The TGW chain, located in the South Atlantic (Figure F1), is one of the most geodynamicall y complex and significant hotspot tracks. It was one of the first proposed plume tracks (Morgan, 1971, 1972) and is considered to have formed by age-progressive volcanism like Hawaii (O’Conno r and Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b; Homrighausen et al., 2019). It is one of only three hotspot tracks that connect a continenta l flood basalt province to active volcanoes (Richards et al., 1989). It is also considered one of onl y seven primary (probably from the lower mantle) plumes (Courtillot et al., 2003). Furthermore, it i s one of several South Atlantic hotspots tied to the edge of the African LLSVP at the base of th e lower mantle, a possible plume generation zone (Torsvik et al., 2006; O’Connor et al., 2012; Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019, 2020). Because of its prominence and \~12 0 My duration (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b; Homrighausen et al., 2019), Walvi s Ridge is a keystone in the Indo-Atlantic hotspot absolute motion reference frame (e.g., Duncan, 1981; Müller et al., 1993; Doubrovine et al., 2012), but with its geologic complexities and th e uncertainty of plumes as fixed mantle markers, the geodynamic implications of the TGW track ar e unclear. Indeed, some authors posit that the TGW chain was formed by nonhotspot-related volcanism along shear zones and structural weaknesses (Fairhead and Wilson, 2005; Foulger, 2007, 2018). Although many researchers think there is strong evidence that Walvis Ridge was formed b y a mantle plume, its complexity contrasts with the simple Hawaiian-Emperor chain. The TG W chain forms a narrow ridge near the continent after a sharp bend forms a plateau (Valdivia Bank ) and then splits into two or three seamount chains farther southwest until it reaches a width of 40 0 km between the active volcanic island groups of Tristan da Cunha and Gough. This region of guyots and ridge-type seamounts is known as the Guyot Province. The two outer seamount tracks en d in the active volcanic islands (Figure F1). It may be that the TGW track is an example of a differen t type of mantle plume, emplaced near a ridge during its early history and from more diffuse o r multiple upwellings (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2012; Anderson and Natland, 2014; Rohde et al., 2013b; Liu and Leng, 2020). The TGW track also represents the longest known (\~70 My) geochemicall y zoned hotspot, and the onset of zonation occurs just before the morphologic split (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Class et al., 2015).

age data for Walvis Ridge,define,excellent age progression,2.2.1.  Evolution of Walvis Ridge: Rio Grande Rise hotspot twins,"When all recently published radiometric ages for Walvis Ridge are considered, they show a wid e range of ages (up to 50 My) at a single location and only display a crude progression of ages tha t becomes older toward Namibia for much of the Late Cretaceous (Figure F6) (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b; Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019). Nevertheless, Homrighausen et al. (2018, 2019, 2020) showed that TGW chain volcanism forms two distinct geochemical types. Th e basement, which has undergone extensive erosion and faulting, has an EMI-type compositio n characterized by unradiogenic 206Pb/204Pb isotope ratios. In contrast, the younger seamounts o n the EMI basement have a HIMU-type composition characterized by radiogenic 206Pb/204Pb isotop e ratios. When only the EMI basement volcanics are considered, they show a tight age progressio n (Figure F6) (Homrighausen et al., 2019). The HIMU seamount volcanism shows a similar age progression but is offset by 30–40 My at a given location from the EMI basement lavas (Figure F6). The HIMU-type seamounts have been interpreted to reflect the passage of Walvis Ridge over  a secondary hotspot \~30–40 My after formation of the Walvis Ridge EMI basement. It has bee n proposed that the EMI TGW hotspot was derived from the outer margin of the LLSVP, and th e secondary HIMU hotspot was derived from an internal step in the LLSVP (Homrighausen et al., 2020).

New isotope data from Guyot Provinc e dredge samples (Class et al., 2014, 2015; Sager et al., 2020) identified a possible third, intermediat e zone in 3-D Pb isotopic space (Figures F10, F11), suggesting that the Tristan-Gough hotspot trac k may be formed by a long-lived, triple-zoned plume. If confirmed by drilling that the triple zonatio n does not result simply from mixing of the Tristan and Gough domains at their boundary, it woul d place tight constraints on the possible spatial distribution of components in the plume sourc e (Lohmann et al., 2009). Geochemical zonation has not been found in the older TGW chain (Figur e F11), leading Hoernle et al. (2015) to suggest that at \~70 Ma the plume source area either began t o suck in Tristan-type material from outside the LLSVP margin, due to having exhausted Goug h material near the boundary, or the base of the plume moved so that it straddled the boundar y between the LLSVP and surrounding ambient mantle. Plume zonation places important constraints on plume dynamics and heterogeneity of the lower mantle at the LLSVP boundaries.",14,Expedition 391 summary

Only new drill cores can provide sufficient data to test whethe r there is indeed a geochemically distinct Center track (green in Figures F10, F11, F12, F13) (Clas s et al., 2014, 2015) or it simply reflects a mixture of the two outer (Tristan and Gough) geochemica l domains, as is also possible for the central track identified in the Galápagos hotspot track (Hoernl e et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003). Furthermore, detailed isotopic studies, including isotopes of Os, rare gases, and other isotope systems, for which appropriate material has not yet been recovere d by dredging, could provide evidence that the Center track lavas are derived from a distinct sourc e that cannot be explained by mixing of Tristan and Gough compositional end-members.

Furthermore, detailed isotopic studies, including isotopes of Os, rare gases, and other isotope systems, for which appropriate material has not yet been recovere d by dredging, could provide evidence that the Center track lavas are derived from a distinct sourc e that cannot be explained by mixing of Tristan and Gough compositional end-members. As note d above, isotope data for the different units at a drill site can form arrays on isotope diagrams, whic h could help distinguish between the aforementioned possibilities. If the arrays from different site s extend from the Gough to Tristan compositional domain, then mixing of Tristan and Gough is th e more likely origin of the central domain. If the central samples form an array that is subparallel t o the Tristan and Gough domains or if additional isotope systems show that the central domain ha s a composition that cannot be explained by mixing of Gough and Tristan compositions, this woul d argue for a distinct intermediate third domain. Most present models of plume zonation attribut e the zonation to sampling of the LLSVP margin by part of the plume base and sampling of th e ambient mantle surrounding the LLSVP. In the simplest case, this should result in two geochemically distinct compositional fields that are not directly related. Evidence for an additional geochemical zone would place this simple model into question, requiring the presence of three o r more distinct chemical reservoirs at the plume base (Lohmann et al., 2009). Zonation of the Discovery plume, with distinct zones of Gough-type material in the north and even more enriche d and distinct EMI-type material in the south (but no evidence of the Tristan composition), indicates that the model proposed thus far to explain Tristan-Gough zonation may be too simpl e (Schwindrofska et al., 2016). If the Gough and Tristan tracks share a common end-member (e.g., low 206Pb/204Pb), defined by the intersection of three main geographic arrays (Figure F12), thi s could also call into question the simple model that the LLSVP is the global cause for plume zonation because it would imply that all three TGW zones share at least one common end-member. Nevertheless, this could also point to mixing of ambient mantle with three distinct component s with radiogenic Pb isotopes from the LLSVP.

Pb isotopic space,contains,zoned plumes with more than two distinct chemical zones,2.3.1.  Geochemistry and isotopic zonation,"The recent identification in Pb isotopic space of zoned plumes containing more than two distinc t chemical zones—Galápagos (Hoernle et al., 2000), Samoa (Jackson et al., 2014), and TGW (Clas s et al., 2014, 2015)—provide an opportunity to further refine our understanding of the dynami c process of source sampling by plumes. For Samoa, the mixing relationship between He and P b isotopic data is best explained by an LLSVP-sourced, high-3He/4He plume matrix that hosts an d mixes with several distinct low 3He/4He end-members representing subducted slabs that overli e the LLSVP (Jackson et al., 2014). In the case of the TGW, Discovery, and Shona plumes in th e South Atlantic, the Gough composition, the main compositional type in all three hotspots, ha s been attributed to the LLSVP, whereas the Tristan and Southern Discovery components coul d reflect a heterogeneous ambient mantle outside of the LLSVP and/or heterogeneity within th e LLSVP (consisting of primarily Gough but also more enriched pockets in Southern Discovery). Unlike Samoa, the Gough compositional domain in the hotspot tracks does not generally appea r to serve as a matrix for the other components such as Southern Discovery and only in a very limited fashion for the TGW composition. Galápagos (Hoernle et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003), Samoa (Jackson et al., 2014), Discovery (Schwindrofska et al., 2016), and the unpublished data fo r the TGW system (Class et al., 2014, 2015) suggested that plume zonation could be considerabl y more complex than models simply explaining dual chemical tracts. To gain further insights as t o whether the TGW hotspot consists primarily of two compositionally and geographically distinc t compositional fields or it instead consists of multiple distinct binary mixing arrays, we need samples from stratigraphic sequences at separate locations to see whether each such sequence forms  a distinct binary array and/or whether the data fall in distinct compositional fields for a given geographic location or zone.

olivine-bearing volcanic rocks,are commonly recovered,by previous scientific drilling,2.3.1.  Geochemistry and isotopic zonation,"Previous scientific drilling has demonstrated that fresh olivine-bearing volcanic rocks and glas s are commonly recovered. Olivines and volcanic glass are highly susceptible to alteration by seawater contact, and thus dredging rarely retrieves such samples, in particular fresh olivine. Fres h glass can provide the liquid composition and preserve accurate abundances of volatile elements, such as H2O, S, F, and Cl. Fresh olivines can be used for a variety of analytical purposes, includin g analyses of He isotopes to test for high 3He/4He and thus a lower mantle origin of the material, an d to constrain further the degassing history of the Earth (Class and Goldstein, 2005; Tolstikhin an d Hofmann, 2005; Jackson and Carlson, 2011). Thus far, high 3He/4He ratios above MORB value s (&gt;10 R/Ra) have not been found along the submarine Tristan-Gough hotspot track. In contrast t o the other major plumes that show bilateral zonation (Hawaii, Galápagos, and Samoa), no hig h 3He/4He signature has been identified for the TGW chain. High 3He/4He isotope ratios, however , have been found in samples with Gough-type Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions where the Discovery and Shona hotspots are interacting with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sarda et al., 2000). If high H e isotopic ratios are found in olivines from drill samples along the TGW hotspot track, they coul d help unravel which components may be derived from the LLSVP.

Fres h glass can provide the liquid composition and preserve accurate abundances of volatile elements, such as H2O, S, F, and Cl. Fresh olivines can be used for a variety of analytical purposes, includin g analyses of He isotopes to test for high 3He/4He and thus a lower mantle origin of the material, an d to constrain further the degassing history of the Earth (Class and Goldstein, 2005; Tolstikhin an d Hofmann, 2005; Jackson and Carlson, 2011). Thus far, high 3He/4He ratios above MORB value s (&gt;10 R/Ra) have not been found along the submarine Tristan-Gough hotspot track. In contrast t o the other major plumes that show bilateral zonation (Hawaii, Galápagos, and Samoa), no hig h 3He/4He signature has been identified for the TGW chain. High 3He/4He isotope ratios, however , have been found in samples with Gough-type Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions where the Discovery and Shona hotspots are interacting with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sarda et al., 2000). If high H e isotopic ratios are found in olivines from drill samples along the TGW hotspot track, they coul d help unravel which components may be derived from the LLSVP. Olivine can also provide important information about the contents of primitive (early and deeply trapped) volatile elements i n melt inclusions and of the composition of primitive and, in some cases, possibly primary melts. They can be used to determine O isotopes to evaluate the involvement of continental material i n the source of the magmas, which has been postulated for the EMI signature found in Walvis Ridg e lavas. Finally, olivine chemistry can help determine the source lithology, constraining the relativ e role of pyroxenite versus peridotite in the source of oceanic basalts. This will allow for the assessment of the role of recycled oceanic crust in plume sources and thus provide insights into th e geodynamic evolution of Earth’s mantle (Sobolev et al., 2005).",19,Expedition 391 summary

Penetration at Site U1584 was also less than planned because indurated volcaniclastic s were encountered, so time was saved for future operations by terminating drilling early. Two proposed sites were planned to establish two-bit holes (FR-1B and CT-4A), meaning that the hol e would be cored first with one bit and that bit replaced when it wears out. Owing to lack of time, only one two-bit hole (Site U1578) was drilled.",24,Expedition 391 summary
changing the bit,requires,raising and taking apart the drill string,4.2.  Drilling and coring strategy,"Changing the bit for drilling a two-bit hole requires raising and taking apart the drill string, whic h requires \~8 h, depending on water depth. After the bit is replaced on the bottom-hole assembl y (BHA), it is lowered to the seafloor by reassembling the drill string, which takes about the sam e amount of time as raising it. Hole reentry is possible with a reentry cone on the seafloor. The con e is located with the aid of sonar and a subsea camera, and the ship’s crew positions the ship abov e the cone so that the drill string can be lowered into the hole. Reentry was accomplished using  a free-fall funnel as the seafloor cone because this device is usually the most economical in terms o f time.

igneous basement,divided into,10 igneous units,5.1.3.2.  Igneous petrology and volcanology,"Hole U1575A penetrated 122.4 m of igneous basement, recovering 71.6 m of rock (58.5%). Thi s basement was divided into 10 igneous units, beginning with a succession of four massive submarine flows (Figure F17). Overall, the eruptive style comprises an alternating sequence of submarine lavas involving massive flows (up to 21 m thick), individual sheet flows, and stacks of pillo w and lobate lavas (Figure F17). All of these units consist of aphanitic to intersertal to holocrystallin e basalt with phenocrysts and glomerocrysts of plagioclase (3%–15%) and clinopyroxene (1%–5%). Olivine is sparse and only intermittently present (0%–3%) and is completely altered in \~50% of th e lavas. The igneous units show significant overlap in mineralogy but may be summarized as follows: massive flow Igneous Subunits 1a and 1b (8.04 m thick) and 2a and 2b (18.08 m thick) consis t of pairs of highly plagioclase-pyroxene ± olivine phyric, holocrystalline basaltic lava flows separated by a glassy margin. Subunits 3a–3d present a change of eruptive behavior and consist o f 12.87 m of intercalated succession of sheet flows, lobate flows, and pillow lava (i.e., pillow lav a stack). Modal compositions vary from sparsely to highly plagioclase-pyroxene-olivine phyric. Basaltic glass and altered aphanitic material are found in pillow rims and flow boundaries. Unit  4 comprises two massive basalt flows (2.16 and 6.22 m thick) with sparse to moderate plagioclas e and pyroxene phenocryst abundance, including sparse olivine. Underlying these massive flows i s Unit 5, a thick (15.00 m) succession of pillow lavas that shows numerous glassy margins.

All samples subjected to alternating field (AF) demagnetization displayed a drill string overprint that was typically removed b y 20 mT before revealing a unidirectional origin-trending component. Magnetic inclination s obtained using principal component analysis from discrete samples agree well with inclination s associated with the 20 mT AF demagnetization step in SRM data acquired from archive-hal f section at corresponding depths. Nearly all measurements are of normal polarity, consistent wit h basement formation during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (C34n).",0,Expedition 391 summary

The lavas rang e from glassy and aphanitic to holocrystalline and intersertal. Fresh glass is present in the pillo w sequence and on the tops of some sheet flows. The lavas are slightly vesicular with small (\~1 mm ) round vesicles and range from aphyric to highly phyric (plagioclase = 9%–12%; clinopyroxene  = 6%–8%). Hole U1576B penetrated 64.9 m of igneous basement, recovering 51.48 m (\~79%), consisting of 32.79 m of basalt and 18.69 m of intercalated chalk and turbidite horizons (Figure F22).

Holes U1576A and U1576B,may sample,a common stratigraphic sequence from the seafloor to \~451 mbsf,5.2.3.6.  Physical properties,"Physical properties measurements were made on 93 cores from Holes U1576A and U1576B. NGR, MS/MSP, GRA bulk density, P-wave velocity, porosity, and thermal conductivity measurement s reveal a relatively simple succession of sedimentary and volcanic units in Hole U1576A: calcareou s ooze grading into more cohesive chalk and limestone from the seafloor to \~380 mbsf and relativel y altered basalt flows and pillows to the bottom of the hole at \~392 mbsf. In Hole U1576B, the sam e suite of measurements recorded a more complex sequence of interbedded sediment and basal t units below the initial sediment/basement contact at \~385 mbsf to the bottom of the hole at \~45 1 mbsf. Localized features within the sedimentary and volcanic intervals of both holes are als o reflected by physical properties data sets, specifically NGR and MS/MSP. In Hole U1576A, th e highest MS (325 × 10−5 SI) recorded in the sediment interval correlates to a \~4 cm thick volcaniclastic deposit at \~135 mbsf (Section 15R-1), and at the same depth, NGR abruptly increases t o 22.2 counts/s from a background range of \~6–8.5 counts/s. Other MS and NGR peaks within th e sediment interval each correlate to a \~2 cm volcaniclastic layer at \~98 mbsf (MS = 150 × 10−5 SI; NGR = 10.1 counts/s; Section 11R-3) and \~123 mbsf (MS = 145 × 10−5 SI; NGR = 18.8 counts/s; Section 13R-6). In Hole U1576A, peaks in NGR, MS, and Section Half Multisensor Logge r (SHMSL) logs align with discrete turbidite or altered tuff layers from \~95 to 280 mbsf, and all thre e data sets display a broad cyclical trend over the same interval. In Hole U1576B, MS values ar e uniformly low in the upper chalk layer and interbedded limestones, with an overall mean value o f 15.8 ± 24.8 × 10−5 SI, but NGR counts in interbedded chalk and limestone below the uppermos t sediment/basalt contact increase with depth from 4.31 counts/s at 387 mbsf to 30.2 counts/s a t 441 mbsf. Basalt layers in Hole U1576B show an increase in MS to an overall mean of 986 ± 171  × 10−5 SI. Relatively high NGR and MS/MSP values in Hole U1576B may be related to pervasiv e alteration in interbedded sedimentary and basalt units.

Hol e U1577A terminates within a massive basalt flow with a minimum thickness of 19.07 m. Igneou s basement was intersected in Sections 391-U1577A-18R-1 through 26R-1. The volcanic successio n consists of a single unit (Igneous Unit 1) made up of highly phyric basalt that is divided into thre e subunits (i.e., massive lava flows) based on features which identify flow boundaries (Figure F26). All igneous subunits are porphyritic; the groundmass texture grades to aphanitic adjacent to flo w boundaries. The uppermost subunit contains a glassy rim in contact with the overlying pelagi c sediment. The phenocryst concentrations are \~18% in the massive flows, with \~15% plagioclase, 2%–5% pyroxene, and 0%–3% olivine. The lavas are slightly vesicular and contain round vesicle s that are 1–2 mm in diameter and filled with at least one secondary mineral (e.g., clay, calcite, and/or zeolite). The groundmass in flow interiors consists of fine- to medium-grained clinopyroxene and plagioclase in subophitic textures, often showing late-stage crystallization after olivine and plagioclase. In flow interiors, the groundmass has a seriate texture and coarse crystal siz e distribution that approaches that of the phenocrysts. Mesostasis (quenched melt) forms irregula r globules that consist of microcrystalline plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides. The flo w margins consist of plagioclase-clinopyroxene-olivine phyric basalt. Plagioclase is still the dominant phenocryst phase in the form of similarly blocky or tabular glomerocrysts (up to 2.4 mm i n size) but with much lower abundance than in flow interiors (\~5%). Olivine (typically altered t o saponite) and clinopyroxene are less common and form small anhedral grains (up to 0.6 mm). Th e groundmass in samples from flow margins is markedly distinct from flow interiors; plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti-oxides are very fine grained, showing intergranular textures. Plagioclas e forms small needle-like skeletal crystals (&lt;0.4 mm), whereas clinopyroxene (&lt;0.08 mm) form s small blocky crystals. There is no seriate gradation in size, as seen in the flow interiors. Mesostasi s forms distinct regions with microcrystalline textures. Secondary minerals are relatively scarce, bu t those that do occur are disseminated as limited peripheral alteration or oxidative films aroun d crystals, and these changes impart minor color variations from the unaltered blue-gray flow interiors to a light brown hue. Oxidative changes also occur as discolored halos extending 2–4 c m away from calcite- and Fe oxyhydroxide–filled fractures and veins.",42,Expedition 391 summary

The volcanic successio n consists of a single unit (Igneous Unit 1) made up of highly phyric basalt that is divided into thre e subunits (i.e., massive lava flows) based on features which identify flow boundaries (Figure F26). All igneous subunits are porphyritic; the groundmass texture grades to aphanitic adjacent to flo w boundaries. The uppermost subunit contains a glassy rim in contact with the overlying pelagi c sediment. The phenocryst concentrations are \~18% in the massive flows, with \~15% plagioclase, 2%–5% pyroxene, and 0%–3% olivine. The lavas are slightly vesicular and contain round vesicle s that are 1–2 mm in diameter and filled with at least one secondary mineral (e.g., clay, calcite, and/or zeolite). The groundmass in flow interiors consists of fine- to medium-grained clinopyroxene and plagioclase in subophitic textures, often showing late-stage crystallization after olivine and plagioclase. In flow interiors, the groundmass has a seriate texture and coarse crystal siz e distribution that approaches that of the phenocrysts.

Sediments above the basalt contact have comparably lower MS/MSP and bulk density (up to 647  × 10−5 SI and 2.12 g/cm3, respectively) and higher NGR and porosity (up to 31.3 counts/s and 73. 2 vol%, respectively). Bulk density, MS/MSP, and NGR values indicate a continuous package of relatively unaltered basalt with no interbedded sediments from \~155 mbsf to the bottom of Hol e U1577A at 193.4 mbsf. Physical properties measurements also record lithologic variations withi n the sediment interval that align with observations from previous sites. As in Holes U1576A an d U1576B, higher MS/MSP values (e.g., 647 × 10−5 SI in Section 391-U1577A-8R-3; \~71 mbsf) ar e associated with volcaniclastic deposits within the sediment interval. Additionally, sediment s between \~80 and \~90 mbsf appear to display cyclic variations in NGR that are similar to cycle s observed in Hole U1576A.",45,Expedition 391 summary

It is the only Expedition 391 site in the morphologically distinct Guyot Province. It is located on the lower flanks of a Center track guyot where sediments are thin (Figures F27, F28, F29). With &gt;300 m of igneous basement cored, it is also the deepest basement penetratio n site of Expedition 391. The site was chosen because the erupted lavas are either likely to be a mixture of Tristan- and Gough-type components or to constitute a distinct third isotopic signature.  A major objective for this site was to measure the geochemical composition of samples from a dee p downhole section of lava flows. The geochemistry should offer clues to the magma source an d evolution of the Center track ridge. Although there are already many radiometric dates for Walvi s Ridge seamounts, samples from Site U1578 help fill gaps in prior sampling.

These interbeds vary in thickness betwee n approximately &gt;0.5 and &gt;10 m and occur down to 416.87 mbsf. They are lithologically similar t o the lowermost sedimentary cover and are composed of clayey nannofossil chalk with volcaniclastic layers.

The examined samples revealed the presence of Oligocene and Eocene flora mixed with Gelasian (early Pleistocene) assemblages. The occurrence o f older taxa within the Pleistocene deposits may be indicative of sediment remobilization (e.g., slump/landslide). The existence of a major unconformity between early Pliocene (Zanclean) an d Paleogene deposits at \~27.0 mbsf was confirmed by both calcareous nannofossil and planktoni c foraminifera data. A shift in MS and magnetic remanence values was also observed from the sam e depth interval, supporting the presence of the unconformity. Sections 3R-CC through 18R-C C recovered a continuous Paleogene stratigraphic sequence. Uncertainties in the placement of th e Eocene/Paleocene boundary derived from the analysis of calcareous nannofossil and planktoni c foraminifera assemblages. Planktonic foraminifera data indicate a mix of early Eocene (Ypresian ) and late Paleocene (Thanetian) taxa in Section 3R-CC. Calcareous nannofossils suggest a possibl e early Eocene age for the same sample because the late Paleocene marker Ericsonia robusta (56.7 8 Ma) is not observed until Section 5R-CC. The bottommost section (18R-CC), at the sediment/ basement contact, is dated between 61.98 and 62.07 Ma based on calcareous nannofossils.

planktonic foraminifera,suggest,a possibly older age (62.2–63.5 Ma) for the bottommost section,5.4.3.3.  Biostratigraphy,"Calcareous nannofossils show good preservation and high abundances throughout Hole U1578A. Planktonic foraminifera are well preserved and abundant in the upper part of the stratigraphi c sequence (Sections 1R-CC and 2R-CC; Lithostratigraphic Unit I). Conversely, foraminifera abundances decrease downhole (Sections 3R-CC through 18R-CC) where an increase in radiolarian s was noted. Moreover, planktonic foraminifera show a decrease in test size in the same time interval, which possibly indicates a response to environmental stress.
