Expedition 320/321,designed to,recover a continuous Cenozoic record of the equatorial Pacific,Abstract,"Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 320/321, Pacific Equatorial Age Transect (Sites U1331–U1338), was designed to recover a continuous Cenozoic re­ cord of the equatorial Pacific by coring above the paleoposition of the equator at suc­ cessive crustal ages on the Pacific plate. These sediments record the evolution of the equatorial climate system throughout the Cenozoic. As we have gained more infor­ mation about the past movement of plates and when in Earth’s history critical cli­ mate events took place, it became possible to drill an age-transect (flow-line) along the position of the paleoequator in the Pacific, targeting important time intervals to reconstruct how the equatorial Pacific was involved in the climate change. The Pacific Equatorial Age Transect (PEAT) program cored eight sites from the sediment surface to basement, with basalt aged between 53 and 18 Ma, covering the time period fol­ lowing maximum Cenozoic warmth, through initial major glaciations, to today. The PEAT program allows the reconstruction of extreme changes of the calcium carbonate compensation depth (CCD) across major geological boundaries during the last 53 m.y. A very shallow CCD during most of the Paleogene makes it difficult to obtain well-preserved carbonate sediments during these stratigraphic intervals, but we recov­ ered a unique sedimentary biogenic sediment archive for time periods just after the Paleocene/Eocene boundary event, the Eocene cooling, the Eocene–Oligocene transi­ tion, the one cold pole Oligocene, the Oligocene–Miocene transition, and the mid­ dle Miocene cooling. Together with older Deep Sea Drilling Project and Ocean Drilling Program drilling in the equatorial Pacific, we can also delineate the position of the paleoequator and variations in sediment thickness from \~150°W to 110°W lon­ gitude. Expedition 321, the second part of the PEAT program, focused on the time pe­ riod roughly from 25 Ma forward.

Pacific Ocean,is,world’s largest ocean,Introduction,"As the world’s largest ocean, the Pacific Ocean is intricately linked to major changes in the global climate system that took place during the Cenozoic. Throughout the Ce­ nozoic the Pacific plate motion has had a northward component. The Pacific is unique in that the thick sediment bulge of biogenic-rich deposits from the currently narrow equatorial upwelling zone is slowly moving away from the Equator. Hence, older sections are not deeply buried and can be recovered by drilling without exten­ sive diagenesis. Previous Legs 138 and 199 were remarkably successful in giving us new insights into the workings of the climate and carbon system, productivity changes across the zone of divergence, time-dependent calcium carbonate dissolu­ tion, an integrated astronomically age-calibrated bio- and magnetostratigraphy, the location of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), and evolutionary patterns for times of climatic change and upheaval. Together with older Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) drilling in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Legs 8, 9, 16, and 85), ODP drilling also helped to delineate the paleoequatorial position on the Pacific plate and varia­ tions in sediment thickness from \~150° to 110°W longitude.",,Expedition 321 Preliminary Report

equatorial surface ocean,is linked to,trade wind system,Background,"The circulation of the equatorial surface ocean is inescapably linked to the trade wind system.

Here, the Equator itself is characterized by a narrow zone of divergence that results from the change in the sign of the Coriolis effect and that gives rise to a band of high biologic productivity (Fig. F6). The strength of the equatorial circulation and of this divergence is linked to the strength of the trade winds, which are in turn strongly tied to the global climate system. Variations in global climate, interhemispheric differ­ ences in temperature gradients, and marked changes in the ocean boundaries are all imprinted on the biogenic-rich sediments that are accumulating in the equatorial zone. The PEAT program was designed to provide an understanding of equatorial Pa­ cific circulation, carbonate production, deposition, and dissolution for the last \~53 m.y. at a scale where orbital forcing can be resolved.

northward movement,transports,equatorial sediments out from under the zone of highest sediment delivery,Background,"Deciphering the sedimentary history of the equatorial Pacific has been greatly simpli­ fied by favorable motion of the Pacific plate. Throughout the Cenozoic, the move­ ment of the Pacific plate has had a northward latitudinal component of \~0.25°/m.y. This northward movement transports the equatorial sediments gradually out from under the zone of highest sediment delivery, resulting in a broad mound of biogenic sediments (Fig. F8). This transport prevents older equatorial sections from being bur­ ied deeply beneath younger sections as the crust moves northward. The diminished overburden resulting from this transport also allows relatively good preservation of biogenic sediments and minimizes burial diagenesis. In addition, it allows us to core nearly all sediment sections using the advanced piston corer (APC). The northward tectonic displacement, however, is not so large that a traverse of the equatorial zone (within 2° latitude of the Equator) was too rapid to record a reasonable period of equa­ torial ocean history. Typically drill sites remain within the equatorial zone for 10–20 m.y. before passing beyond the northern edge of high-biogenic sedimentation.

Paleocene and Eocene,prevent,shallow CCD from allowing carbonate deposition except at shallow ocean crust,Background,"During the Paleocene and Eocene, the shallow CCD prevents deposition of carbonate except at shallow ocean crust. Drilling near the paleoposition of the ridge crest at the critical time interval allows the recovery of the shallowest sections available in the pe­ lagic oceans and thereby assures the best possible preservation of the carbonate sedi­ ments recovered. As the crust cools and sinks, the seafloor on which the sediments are deposited approaches the lysocline and CCD. Thus, the best preserved part of the sections recovered in such time line transects is restricted by the depth at which car­ bonate dissolution significantly increases, as well as by the northward movement of sediment sections out of the region of high equatorial productivity.

Pacific Ocean,controls,atmospheric CO2 levels,"Understanding the interplay between the CCD, CaCO3 dissolution, and productivity","The Pacific Ocean, specifically the equatorial upwelling zone, is the largest oceanic source of CO2 to the atmosphere and controls atmospheric CO2 levels (Dore et al., 2003). The release and uptake of CO2 is the direct consequence of calcium carbonate deposition and the interplay between nutrient supply, carbonate dissolution, surface water productivity, and export of biogenic carbonate from the surface waters to the sediment pile. Distinguishing between the effects of carbonate dissolution and pro­ ductivity has been a field of intense study in the past. An important objective of the PEAT program is to address the detailed workings of depth-dependent carbonate dis­ solution, which is intricately linked to the climate system and paleoceanography. In the standard model for carbonate dissolution, accumulation rates locally decrease lin­ early from a lysocline down to a CCD, reflecting a linearly increasing rate of dissolu­ tion. The depth of both of these mappable surfaces varies spatially and in time as a result of climatic and physical processes. The equatorial Pacific is one of the classic areas where the lysocline-CCD model was first developed, but little subsequent effort has been made to test it—a necessary step, considering that the functional form of dissolution is now known to depend in a more complex way on organic carbon burial and water mass properties.

An important objective of the PEAT program is to address the detailed workings of depth-dependent carbonate dis­ solution, which is intricately linked to the climate system and paleoceanography. In the standard model for carbonate dissolution, accumulation rates locally decrease lin­ early from a lysocline down to a CCD, reflecting a linearly increasing rate of dissolu­ tion. The depth of both of these mappable surfaces varies spatially and in time as a result of climatic and physical processes. The equatorial Pacific is one of the classic areas where the lysocline-CCD model was first developed, but little subsequent effort has been made to test it—a necessary step, considering that the functional form of dissolution is now known to depend in a more complex way on organic carbon burial and water mass properties.

high-quality paleomagnetic data,purpose,improve existing geologic timescales,Paleomagnetic objectives,"One important aspect of the PEAT program is the recovery of high-quality paleomag­ netic data so that attempts to improve existing geologic timescales (Gradstein et al., 2004) can be extended further back in time. Results from Leg 199 demonstrate that these records can be recovered from near-equatorial carbonate sediments (e.g., Lanci et al., 2004, 2005).

However, neither biogenic carbonate sediments through most of the Eocene nor for ages younger than the lower Miocene were recov­ ered during Leg 199.

This interval of time is noted for its markedly heavy benthic oxygen isotopes (Fig. F2) and its relatively deep CCD (Fig. F3). There was probably ice on Antarctica during this interval, but not the large ice sheets to be found there later in the middle Miocene. Compelling evi­ dence does not exist for ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere during the Oligocene and early Miocene. Thus, a time of low global ice volume, cold bottom waters, a cold South Pole, and a relatively warm North Pole apparently existed. This scenario of a one cold pole world has given rise to speculation on the impact of interhemispheric temperature imbalance on pole to Equator temperature gradients and on the symme­ try of the global wind systems. The extent to which such an imbalance may have af­ fected the trade winds, the position of the ITCZ, and the seasonal shifts in this zone should be seen in the wind-driven currents of the equatorial region.",14,Expedition 321 Preliminary Report
DSDP data,indicate,relatively high but variable sediment accumulation rates during this interval,"Oligocene (Site U1336, \~32 Ma crust)","The older low-resolution DSDP data indicate relatively high but variable sediment ac­ cumulation rates during this interval and better carbonate preservation to the south of the Equator (van Andel, 1975). In the Leg 199 equatorial transect, the highest ac­ cumulation rates encountered (&gt;15 m/m.y.) occurred in the lower part of the Oligo­ cene, but these were in sites north of the Oligocene Equator or on relatively old (and therefore deep) crust. Thus we expected a better preserved thicker carbonate section at the Oligocene Equator. Studies of Oligocene sections from Leg 199 and other ODP sites (e.g., Paul et al., 2000; Zachos et al., 2001a; Billups et al., 2004; Pälike et al., 2006a) indicate the presence of strong eccentricity and obliquity cycles in carbonate preservation and suggest a strong (southern) high-latitude influence on the carbonate record. These cycles are leading to the development of an orbitally tuned timescale that reaches back to the base of the Oligocene (Pälike et al., 2006b).

Ceara Rise,coring,middle and early Miocene discontinuously,Results and highlights,"One of the important accomplishments of Expedition 321 was to recover two contin­ uous essentially complete Neogene sedimentary sections, Site U1338 from 0 to &gt;17 Ma and Site U1337 from 0 to &gt;23 Ma, just beyond the Oligocene/Miocene boundary. These represent the only complete Neogene sections in the equatorial Pacific, possi­ bly for all the tropics, that have high enough sedimentation rates to resolve orbitally forced sediment cycles. Coring during DSDP Legs 8, 9, and 16 was accomplished with the rotary core barrel and the sediments were highly disturbed. During ODP Leg 85 at Site 574, the middle Miocene to present was double APC cored, but sedimentation rates were slow (\~5 m/m.y.) from 0 to 10 Ma and the middle Miocene section was never spliced (Mayer et al., 1985). Below the middle Miocene, only one hole was drilled. Similarly, Site 572 had only a single hole drilled through the upper and mid­ dle Miocene interval (Mayer et al., 1985).

One of the objectives for the natural gamma ray measurement on cores is to produce a record that can be cor­ related with the wireline logging measurements. Unfortunately, the low natural gamma ray activity levels produced inconsistent peaks on repeat passes of the logging tool strings, with the exception of a few intervals.",20,Expedition 321 Preliminary Report
seafloor,had,high natural gamma ray activity,New capabilities on the JOIDES Resolution,"The seafloor was one interval that consistently had high natural gamma ray activity (Fig. F17). Whereas counts at a distance from the seafloor were &lt;5 cps, seafloor natural radioactivity levels were as high as 160 cps within 1 m of the top of the sediments. Natural gamma ray activity dropped to the typical low count a few meters below the surface. Spectral studies using hour-long counts on the surface cores revealed that nat­ ural gamma ray activity at the surface is being produced by high uranium levels, not thorium or potassium. It is not clear yet why uranium is being concentrated only near the sediment/water interface. Because the near-surface sediments have low organic carbon contents, uranium has not been concentrated by reduction and precipitation from seawater. Kunzendorf et al. (1983) instead argues that enrichments of uranium in tropical Pacific sediments result from coprecipitation of seawater uranium with Feoxides. This solution still begs the question as to why the level of Fe-oxides might be higher.",21,Expedition 321 Preliminary Report

This \~20 m long unresolved interval is underlain by sediments that carry a magnetic stratigraphy of part of the middle and lower Miocene, although the interval is interspersed with turbidites and evidence of reworking. At Site U1336, the magnetic stratigraphy of part of the middle and lower Miocene is resolved in the 0–80 m CSF-A interval at mean sedimentation rates of \~10 m/m.y.; however, below \~80 m CSF-A magnetization in­ tensities are too low for resolvable magnetization directions. At Site U1337, although the magnetic polarity stratigraphy is interpretable for the upper Miocene to Quater­ nary, data quality is poor for the upper Miocene. At Site U1338, the magnetic stratig­ raphy is resolvable in three intervals: part of the Pliocene–Pleistocene (0–4 Ma), part of the late Miocene (8.7–11 Ma), and part of the middle Miocene (12.7–16 Ma). These three intervals at Site U1338 are separated by intervals of low magnetization intensi­ ties where the magnetic stratigraphy was not resolvable.",2,Expedition 321 Preliminary Report

We were able to run the VSP log at both Site U1337 (Fig. F25) and U1338. Figure F25 is an initial comparison between the Site 574 seismic stratigraphy of Mayer et al. (1985) and the initial results for Site U1337. The events appear to correlate in age, as would be pre­ dicted by Mayer et al. (1985). Site 574 is at essentially the same latitude as Site U1337 but &gt;1000 km to the west. The length scale of the correlatable seismic horizons across the Pacific helps to define the length scale of the paleoceanographic events with which they are associated. Postcruise studies will focus on better defining the seismic stratigraphy at both Sites U1337 and U1338, allowing new tie points for the seismic stratigraphic study of the equatorial Pacific sediment bulge (Mitchell et al., 2003).",27,Expedition 321 Preliminary Report

Site U1336,will provide,information on chert formation in the equatorial Pacific regions,Chert formation in the early Oligocene,"The dissolution of biogenic silica is the source of porcellanite and chert and, on crust younger than 65 Ma, almost all cherts in the Pacific Ocean lie &lt;150 m above base­ ment. Although we did not recover basement rocks at this site, the sediments became hard, lithified limestones and the drilled section is probably close to basement.

physical property measurements,display,strong lithology-dependent variation at Site U1337,Physical properties,"Physical property measurements on whole-round sections and samples from split cores display a strong lithology-dependent variation at Site U1337 (Fig. F30). Varia­ tions in the abundances of nannofossils, radiolarians, diatoms, and clay in Unit I ac­ count for high-amplitude, high-frequency variations of all physical properties. Intervals enriched in biogenic silica and clay generally display lower grain density and bulk density and higher porosity, magnetic susceptibility, and NGR. Velocity is generally directly related to bulk density; however, it is commonly higher in low-den­ sity siliceous-rich sediments than it is in more calcareous intervals. Wet bulk density is low in Unit I, ranging from 1.12 to 1.46 g/cm3. Porosity is as high as 92% in this unit. Velocity also is low, averaging 1525 m/s. The natural gamma record, as at previ­ ous Expedition 320/321 sites, is marked by an anomalously high near-surface peak (\~65 cps). Magnetic susceptibility varies between 4 × 10–5 and 18 × 10–5 SI. The color of Unit I is characterized by the lowest L* and high and variable a* and b* values. Unit II is characterized by a continued high variability in grain density. Together, the grain density in Units I and II averages 2.51 g/cm3 and ranges from 2.17 to 2.85 g/cm3. All other physical properties display less variability in Unit II than in Unit I, reflecting a less variable lithology. Wet bulk density increases and porosity decreases with depth in Unit II; however, in Units II and III these trends are interrupted by low-density, high-porosity diatom- and radiolarian-rich intervals. Unit II is slightly lighter colored (lower L*) and distinctly more blue (lower a*) and green (lower b*) than Unit I. Unit III is characterized by more uniform physical properties that accompany the high and uniform carbonate composition of the unit. The nannofossil oozes and chalks of this unit are characterized by a uniform grain density that averages 2.67 g/cm3. The bulk density and porosity trends of Unit II continue in Unit III. The transition from ooze to chalk is marked by a change in gradient of these properties to a more rapid decrease in wet bulk density and an increase in porosity with depth. Wet bulk density and po­ rosity at the base of the sediment section are 1.95 g/cm3 and 47%, respectively. The increase in velocity with depth also changes to a higher gradient in Unit III, with val­ ues increasing from 1510 m/s at \~340 m CSF-A to \~1800 m/s near the base of the hole. Magnetic susceptibility and NGR values remain low in Unit III but do vary in response to small changes in lithology.

Velocity is generally directly related to bulk density; however, it is commonly higher in low-den­ sity siliceous-rich sediments than it is in more calcareous intervals. Wet bulk density is low in Unit I, ranging from 1.12 to 1.46 g/cm3. Porosity is as high as 92% in this unit. Velocity also is low, averaging 1525 m/s. The natural gamma record, as at previ­ ous Expedition 320/321 sites, is marked by an anomalously high near-surface peak (\~65 cps). Magnetic susceptibility varies between 4 × 10–5 and 18 × 10–5 SI. The color of Unit I is characterized by the lowest L* and high and variable a* and b* values. Unit II is characterized by a continued high variability in grain density. Together, the grain density in Units I and II averages 2.51 g/cm3 and ranges from 2.17 to 2.85 g/cm3. All other physical properties display less variability in Unit II than in Unit I, reflecting a less variable lithology. Wet bulk density increases and porosity decreases with depth in Unit II; however, in Units II and III these trends are interrupted by low-density, high-porosity diatom- and radiolarian-rich intervals. Unit II is slightly lighter colored (lower L*) and distinctly more blue (lower a*) and green (lower b*) than Unit I. Unit III is characterized by more uniform physical properties that accompany the high and uniform carbonate composition of the unit. The nannofossil oozes and chalks of this unit are characterized by a uniform grain density that averages 2.67 g/cm3. The bulk density and porosity trends of Unit II continue in Unit III. The transition from ooze to chalk is marked by a change in gradient of these properties to a more rapid decrease in wet bulk density and an increase in porosity with depth. Wet bulk density and po­ rosity at the base of the sediment section are 1.95 g/cm3 and 47%, respectively. The increase in velocity with depth also changes to a higher gradient in Unit III, with val­ ues increasing from 1510 m/s at \~340 m CSF-A to \~1800 m/s near the base of the hole. Magnetic susceptibility and NGR values remain low in Unit III but do vary in response to small changes in lithology. The sharp color change from greenish gray to pale yel­ low at \~410 m CSF-A is marked by a sharp increase in a* and b*.

Magnetic susceptibility and NGR values remain low in Unit III but do vary in response to small changes in lithology. The sharp color change from greenish gray to pale yel­ low at \~410 m CSF-A is marked by a sharp increase in a* and b*. The change in color to pale brown chalk immediately above basement is marked by an increase in both a* and b* and a decrease in L*.",40,Expedition 321 Preliminary Report

Two tool strings took downhole measurements of natural gamma ray radioactivity, bulk den­ sity, electrical resistivity, elastic wave velocity, and borehole resistivity images in the 77–442 m wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF) depth interval.

Measurement depths were adjusted to match across different logging runs, obtaining a wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) depth scale. The downhole log measurements were used to define three logging units. Unit I (77–212 m WMSF) and Unit II (212–339 m WMSF) have average densities of \~1.3 and \~1.6 g/ cm3, respectively, that do not show any trend with depth, whereas Unit III (339–442 m WMSF) density increases with depth reaching 1.85 g/cm3 at the base of the hole (Fig. F31). Resistivity and P-wave velocity follow a pattern similar to that of density, suggesting that the major control on these physical properties are variations in sedi­ ment porosity. Natural gamma ray measurements are low throughout the logged in­ terval (\~5° gAPI), except for two pronounced peaks caused by uranium, one at the seafloor and the other at 240 m WMSF.

Alkalinity increases slightly downhole from \~2.7 mM in the upper 100 m to values scattered around 3.8 mM be­ low 300 m CSF-A.

Nitrate concentrations are low and variable except for higher values at the top and bottom of the sediment column. These variations in nitrate, manganese, and iron reflect changes in redox chemistry that also manifest as changes in sediment color. The silicic acid (dissolved silicate) content of the interstitial waters is substan­ tially greater than that of bottom waters (e.g., Peng et al., 1993) and increases with depth from \~700 µM in the uppermost sediments to peak at \~1200 µM at \~350 m CSFA before decreasing to \~900 µM near the basaltic basement.

rig floor operations,commenced,at 1200 h,Hole U1337A,"Rig floor operations commenced at 1200 h after the ship was stationary over the lo­ cation coordinates. The pipe trip to the seafloor was slow because of the need for mea­ suring (strapping) and drifting (internal diameter verification) of all tubulars and the picking up of the drill collars from the main deck storage rack. At 0300 h on 20 May, the top drive was picked up; however, the tilt/counter balance feature was not func­ tional. Troubleshooting and repairing the top drive took 4 h before spacing out the drill string and deploying the first APC core barrel. With the bit positioned at 4467.0 m drilling depth below rig floor (DRF) the first APC barrel was pressured up and fired. Upon recovery, the leading edge of the APC cutting shoe was found severely damaged and the core barrel was empty. To confirm the approximate seafloor depth the drill string was lowered and the mudline was tagged twice at about the same depth of 4472.0 m DRF. This depth was taken as the official seafloor depth for the hole, the bit was repositioned 1.0 m lower at 4468.0 m DRF, and Hole U1337A was spudded at 1115 h. Core 321-U1337A-1H recovered 0.19 m of core, and once again the APC cut­ ting shoe showed signs of having impacted something very hard. APC coring contin­ ued normally from there, however, and was suspended at 195.5 m DSF because of a 90 klb overpull. Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all cores except Core 321- U1337A-21H. A 60 klb overpull for Core 321-U1337A-20H led to a return to steel core barrels. Average core recovery for the APC was 101.6%. FlexIt core orientation was conducted for all cores except Core 321-U1337A-1H with apparent good success. In addition, five successful APCT-3 temperature measurements were taken with Cores 321-U1337A-5H, 7H, 9H, 11H, and 13H at 43.5, 62.5, 81.5, 100.5, and 119.5 m DSF, respectively.

top drive,picked up,at 0300 h on 20 May,Hole U1337A,"Rig floor operations commenced at 1200 h after the ship was stationary over the lo­ cation coordinates. The pipe trip to the seafloor was slow because of the need for mea­ suring (strapping) and drifting (internal diameter verification) of all tubulars and the picking up of the drill collars from the main deck storage rack. At 0300 h on 20 May, the top drive was picked up; however, the tilt/counter balance feature was not func­ tional. Troubleshooting and repairing the top drive took 4 h before spacing out the drill string and deploying the first APC core barrel. With the bit positioned at 4467.0 m drilling depth below rig floor (DRF) the first APC barrel was pressured up and fired. Upon recovery, the leading edge of the APC cutting shoe was found severely damaged and the core barrel was empty. To confirm the approximate seafloor depth the drill string was lowered and the mudline was tagged twice at about the same depth of 4472.0 m DRF. This depth was taken as the official seafloor depth for the hole, the bit was repositioned 1.0 m lower at 4468.0 m DRF, and Hole U1337A was spudded at 1115 h.

FlexIt core orientation,conducted,for all cores except Core 321-U1337A-1H,Hole U1337A,"Rig floor operations commenced at 1200 h after the ship was stationary over the lo­ cation coordinates. The pipe trip to the seafloor was slow because of the need for mea­ suring (strapping) and drifting (internal diameter verification) of all tubulars and the picking up of the drill collars from the main deck storage rack. At 0300 h on 20 May, the top drive was picked up; however, the tilt/counter balance feature was not func­ tional. Troubleshooting and repairing the top drive took 4 h before spacing out the drill string and deploying the first APC core barrel. With the bit positioned at 4467.0 m drilling depth below rig floor (DRF) the first APC barrel was pressured up and fired. Upon recovery, the leading edge of the APC cutting shoe was found severely damaged and the core barrel was empty. To confirm the approximate seafloor depth the drill string was lowered and the mudline was tagged twice at about the same depth of 4472.0 m DRF. This depth was taken as the official seafloor depth for the hole, the bit was repositioned 1.0 m lower at 4468.0 m DRF, and Hole U1337A was spudded at 1115 h. Core 321-U1337A-1H recovered 0.19 m of core, and once again the APC cut­ ting shoe showed signs of having impacted something very hard.

The top drive was picked up, and the drill string was spaced out, placing the bit at 4196.0 m DRF or 3.4 m above the corrected precision depth recorder depth of 4199.4 m DRF. The first APC barrel was pressured up and fired, but upon recovery it was discovered to have zero recovery (i.e., a water core). The bit was lowered an additional 5.0 m to 4201.0 m DRF, and another attempt for mudline was made. This time the barrel obviously contacted the mudline; how­ ever, the small amount of core recovered was completely destroyed by the sloshing of the water column above. For the third attempt, the bit was repositioned an additional 3.0 m lower at 4204.0 m DRF. This time the barrel recovered 2.7 m of core, and an official seafloor depth was established at 4210.8 m DRF. APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338A-24H to 221.2 m DSF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies and the FlexIt core orientation system. Overpull forces of 100 klb and the need to drillover the APC barrel led to the use of steel core barrels beginning with Core 321- U1338A-25H. APC coring was eventually ended with Core 321-U1338A-26H at 240.2 m DSF. All barrels fully stroked; however, the last three cores (321-U1338A-24H, 25H, and 26H) required 100 klb overpull and drillover to extract from the formation.

With the drill bit placed at 4208.0 m DRF to optimize the core breaks between holes, the APC was deployed and once again a water core was recovered. After checking the drill string tally it was discovered that the driller was off by a single joint of drill pipe. This single was added to the string, and with the bit po­ sitioned at the same depth, the second hole for Site U1338 was spudded at 2330 h on 6 June. Core recovery with APC Core 321-U1338B-1H determined the seafloor depth as 4209.9 m DRF. Except for a short drilled interval of 2.5 m to adjust the core breaks, continuous APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338B-20H to 188.1 m DSF us­ ing the FlexIt core orientation system and nonmagnetic coring assemblies. FlexIt and steel core barrels were then used as APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338B42H to 387.4 m DSF. Hole U1338B is the second deepest APC hole in ODP and IODP history, surpassing the 378.0 m DSF depth achieved during Expedition 320 in Hole U1335B. APC extraction overpull reached 100 klb on 19 of the 42 cores taken, includ­ ing the last 11 cores. Full stroke was achieved on all but two cores (321-U1338B-30H and 31H) through the interval from 276.1 to 282.9 m DSF. Coincidentally, the shear pressure for these two cores was inconclusive, so this may have been the reason for the incomplete stroke. Drillover was required on 13 cores, including the last ten. Ex­ cept for Cores 321-U1338B-30H and 31H, shear pressures were consistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. Core liner issues were relatively mild. The Core 321- U1338B-1H liner was broken, the liner for Core 321-U1338B-13H was cracked at the bottom, and the liner in Core 321-U1338B-42H was recovered split. Average core re­ covery for the APC was 104.1%. Coring continued with three XCB cores (321- U1338B-43X through 45X) to 416.1 m DSF. Basement contact was recovered in Core 321-U1338B-45X. Overall the XCB coring system recovered 57.9% of the interval penetrated. Recovery was problematic with the XCB, and the material that was recov­ ered suffered significantly from the typical biscuiting effect. Total depth of Hole U1338B was 4626.0 m DRF (416.1 m DSF). Overall core recovery using both APC and XCB coring systems was 100.9%. The hole was swept clean with 50 bbl of attapulgite mud. A wiper trip revealed no ledges or bridges, and no fill was identified at total depth. The lockable float valve was locked open, the hole was displaced with heavy 10.5 ppg logging mud, and the end of pipe was placed at 84.7 m DSF. Rig-up for wire­ line logging began at 2145 h on 9 June. Wireline logging in Hole U1338B was success­ fully concluded and all logging equipment was rigged down by 1615 h on 11 June. Three logging strings were deployed. The triple combo and the FMS-sonic tool reached total hole depth of 416.1 m DSF. The third and final logging string consisted of the VSI. This tool reached total hole depth and shooting stations were conducted at \~15 m stations. All logging was done during daylight hours to conform with estab­ lished IODP mammal watch protocols, including a preshooting mammal watch and soft start procedures for the air guns.

Overall the XCB coring system recovered 57.9% of the interval penetrated. Recovery was problematic with the XCB, and the material that was recov­ ered suffered significantly from the typical biscuiting effect. Total depth of Hole U1338B was 4626.0 m DRF (416.1 m DSF). Overall core recovery using both APC and XCB coring systems was 100.9%. The hole was swept clean with 50 bbl of attapulgite mud.

The drilling line was slipped and cut while the was offset ship 20 m to the west of Hole U1338A. With the drill bit placed at 4208.0 m DRF to optimize the core breaks between holes, the APC was deployed and once again a water core was recovered. After checking the drill string tally it was discovered that the driller was off by a single joint of drill pipe. This single was added to the string, and with the bit po­ sitioned at the same depth, the second hole for Site U1338 was spudded at 2330 h on 6 June. Core recovery with APC Core 321-U1338B-1H determined the seafloor depth as 4209.9 m DRF. Except for a short drilled interval of 2.5 m to adjust the core breaks, continuous APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338B-20H to 188.1 m DSF us­ ing the FlexIt core orientation system and nonmagnetic coring assemblies. FlexIt and steel core barrels were then used as APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338B42H to 387.4 m DSF. Hole U1338B is the second deepest APC hole in ODP and IODP history, surpassing the 378.0 m DSF depth achieved during Expedition 320 in Hole U1335B.

Coincidentally, the shear pressure for these two cores was inconclusive, so this may have been the reason for the incomplete stroke. Drillover was required on 13 cores, including the last ten. Ex­ cept for Cores 321-U1338B-30H and 31H, shear pressures were consistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. Core liner issues were relatively mild. The Core 321- U1338B-1H liner was broken, the liner for Core 321-U1338B-13H was cracked at the bottom, and the liner in Core 321-U1338B-42H was recovered split. Average core re­ covery for the APC was 104.1%. Coring continued with three XCB cores (321- U1338B-43X through 45X) to 416.1 m DSF. Basement contact was recovered in Core 321-U1338B-45X. Overall the XCB coring system recovered 57.9% of the interval penetrated. Recovery was problematic with the XCB, and the material that was recov­ ered suffered significantly from the typical biscuiting effect. Total depth of Hole U1338B was 4626.0 m DRF (416.1 m DSF).

The drilling line was slipped and cut while the was offset ship 20 m to the west of Hole U1338A. With the drill bit placed at 4208.0 m DRF to optimize the core breaks between holes, the APC was deployed and once again a water core was recovered. After checking the drill string tally it was discovered that the driller was off by a single joint of drill pipe. This single was added to the string, and with the bit po­ sitioned at the same depth, the second hole for Site U1338 was spudded at 2330 h on 6 June. Core recovery with APC Core 321-U1338B-1H determined the seafloor depth as 4209.9 m DRF. Except for a short drilled interval of 2.5 m to adjust the core breaks, continuous APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338B-20H to 188.1 m DSF us­ ing the FlexIt core orientation system and nonmagnetic coring assemblies. FlexIt and steel core barrels were then used as APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338B42H to 387.4 m DSF. Hole U1338B is the second deepest APC hole in ODP and IODP history, surpassing the 378.0 m DSF depth achieved during Expedition 320 in Hole U1335B. APC extraction overpull reached 100 klb on 19 of the 42 cores taken, includ­ ing the last 11 cores. Full stroke was achieved on all but two cores (321-U1338B-30H and 31H) through the interval from 276.1 to 282.9 m DSF. Coincidentally, the shear pressure for these two cores was inconclusive, so this may have been the reason for the incomplete stroke. Drillover was required on 13 cores, including the last ten. Ex­ cept for Cores 321-U1338B-30H and 31H, shear pressures were consistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. Core liner issues were relatively mild. The Core 321- U1338B-1H liner was broken, the liner for Core 321-U1338B-13H was cracked at the bottom, and the liner in Core 321-U1338B-42H was recovered split. Average core re­ covery for the APC was 104.1%. Coring continued with three XCB cores (321- U1338B-43X through 45X) to 416.1 m DSF. Basement contact was recovered in Core 321-U1338B-45X. Overall the XCB coring system recovered 57.9% of the interval penetrated. Recovery was problematic with the XCB, and the material that was recov­ ered suffered significantly from the typical biscuiting effect. Total depth of Hole U1338B was 4626.0 m DRF (416.1 m DSF). Overall core recovery using both APC and XCB coring systems was 100.9%. The hole was swept clean with 50 bbl of attapulgite mud. A wiper trip revealed no ledges or bridges, and no fill was identified at total depth.

The ship was offset 20 m to the west of Hole U1338B. The drill ing line was slipped and cut and the Rigwatch drawworks/block position encoder was recalibrated. The drill bit was placed at 4204 m DRF (same as Hole U1338A) to opti­ mize the core breaks between Holes U1338A and U1338B. The APC was deployed, and, for the third time at this site, a water core was recovered. Because 2.7 m of core had been recovered in Hole U1338A with the same bit placement, it was suspected that vessel heave, induced by the large long-period swell train from the south, had impacted bit placement by being on the high side of the swell displacement. The drill string was lowered another 3 m, and the bit was repositioned at 4207.0 m DRF. Hole U1338C was spudded at 2135 h on 11 June. The 3.83 m of core recovery with APC Core 321-U1338C-1H determined the seafloor depth at 4212.7 m DRF. APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338C-21H to 189.8 m DSF using the FlexIt core ori­ entation system and nonmagnetic coring assemblies. FlexIt and steel core barrels were then used as APC coring continued through Core 321-U1338C-44H to 396.9 m DSF. Conditions indicated that Core 321-U1338C-45H fully stroked, and drillover was re­ quired to extract it from the formation. Retrieval was delayed because a bent core bar­ rel initially prohibited entry into the drill string. Repeated jarring with the wireline jars eventually sheared the overshot pin. The sinker bar string was recovered, and the FlexIt core orientation tool was removed. The sinker bar assembly was redeployed, and the core barrel was immediately recovered without any further incident. It was deemed prudent at this point to leave the FlexIt tool out of the assembly for the re­ mainder of the coring process. Coring continued through Core 321-U1338C-47H to a total depth of 414.4 m DSF, setting a new all time depth record for the APC. This surpassed the standing ODP record set on 7 August 1992 (Leg 145) when the APC re­ covered 42 piston cores to a total depth of 398.3 m DSF in Hole 882A. APC extraction overpull reached 100 klb on Cores 321-U1338C-22H through 47H. Drillover prior to removal from the formation was required for 22 cores and full stroke was achieved on all but four cores (321-U1338C-31H and 45H through 47H). Shear pressures were con­ sistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. Core liner issues were relatively mild with only two cores recovered with imploded liners (Cores 321-U1338C-10H and 12H), although several barrels were bent during the coring process and several piston rods had to be adjusted and repinned because of overtorqued threads that caused miss-alignment of the rod grooves.
