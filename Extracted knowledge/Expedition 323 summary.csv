paleoclimate and paleoceanographic studies,present,opportunities to study the dynamics of the climate system,Abstract,"Paleoclimate and paleoceanographic studies present opportunities to study the dynamics of the climate system by examining how it responds to external forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas and solar radiation changes) and how its interacting components generate climate oscillations and abrupt changes. Of note is the amplified recent warming of the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, which is presumably related to sea ice albedo feedback and teleconnections to other regions; both the behavior of sea ice–climate interactions and the role of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation in climate change can be studied with geologic records of past climate change in the Bering Sea.",1,Expedition 323 summary

global climate,evolved from,being warm with only small Northern Hemisphere glaciers,Abstract,"Over the last 5 m.y., global climate has evolved from being warm with only small Northern Hemisphere glaciers to being cold with major Northern Hemisphere glaciations every 100–40 k.y. The ultimate reasons for this major transition are unknown. In addition, climate cycles on orbital and millennial timescales characterize the variability found in most continuous paleoceanographic records. Although regional environmental cycles and trends reflected in the sediment have been documented in some regions, the mechanisms by which they propagate globally are not understood. Possible mechanisms responsible for both the long-term evolution of global climate as well as the generation of high-frequency climate oscillations involve processes such as intermediate water ventilation and sea ice formation in the North Pacific. However, the paucity of data in critical regions of the Pacific such as the Bering Sea has prevented an evaluation of the role of North Pacific processes in global climate change. Because North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) has the potential to be influenced by dense water forming in the Bering Sea and because changes in sea ice distribution have potential far-field impacts, the Bering Sea may be critically involved in major climate changes. Thus, drilling in the Bering Sea may help answer questions not only about the global extent of climate trends and oscillations but also about the mechanisms that produce them.",1,Expedition 323 summary

rate of recent global warming,is,difficult to understand,Introduction,"The rate and regional expression of recent global warming is difficult to understand and even more difficult to predict because of the complex nature of the climate system, whose components interact nonlinearly with various time lags. Paleoclimate and paleoceanographic studies present opportunities to study climate system dynamics by examining how they respond to external forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas and solar radiation changes) and how they generate internal variability due to interacting Earth-system processes. Of note is the amplified recent warming of the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (Solomon et al., 2007), which is presumably related to sea ice albedo feedback and teleconnections to other regions; both the behavior of sea ice–climate interactions and the role of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation in climate change can be studied with geologic records of past climate changes in the Bering Sea.",2,Expedition 323 summary

In addition, changes in Bering Sea conditions could be related to sea level and circulation changes, which alter flow through small straits that connect the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean to the north and to the Pacific Ocean to the south. The lack of Bering Sea material has so far prevented the evaluation of these and other ideas.",2,Expedition 323 summary

The oxygen and nutrient composition of these waters is further modified by the denitrification (Lehmann et al., 2005) and respiration of organic matter in the water column (Nedashkovskiy and Sapozhnikov, 1999). Respiration and the development of an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is particularly intense at water depths of \~1000 m (Fig. F4).",,Expedition 323 summary

Furthermore, the limited spatial coverage of sites in the open Pacific prevents the detailed identification of the exact source of intermediate and deep water, as well as the exact circulation path of subsurface watermasses. Observations of glacial records from the Bering Sea and just outside the Bering Sea on the Detroit Seamount in the North Pacific suggest a source of ventilated intermediate water coming from the Bering Sea and/or the Detroit Seamount region (Gorbarenko, 1996).",5,Expedition 323 summary
Bering Sea drilling,reported,two examples of the prospective reconstructions of Bering Sea paleoceanography,Glacial–interglacial climate change,"Two examples of the prospective reconstructions of Bering Sea paleoceanography by Bering Sea drilling were reported in recent studies performed on the piston cores collected during the 1999 R/V HakuhouMaru site survey cruise (Takahashi et al., 2005). Sea ice distribution during the glacial period was modulated by surface water circulation, which was partially governed by the topography that resulted from the drop in sea level. The distribution of sea ice and watermasses was significantly different in the two basins west and east of Bowers Ridge because of the pattern of surface-ocean circulation (Katsuki and Takahashi, 2005). Past sources of NPIW formation were inferred from the intermediate water–dwelling radiolarian species Cycladophora davisiana (Tanaka and Takahashi, 2005).

long-term trends in Pliocene circulation,documented to assess,possible influence of the tectonic opening of the Bering Sea,Pliocene–Pleistocene trends,"The emergence of the Bering Land Bridge (Beringia) prior to the Neogene is not well understood. However, Pliocene climate change—and perhaps the onset of NHG, specifically—could have been affected by  changes  in  the  marine  gateway  connection through the Bering Strait region. The connection may have developed in the late Miocene or the early Pliocene based on the occurrences of Atlantic-type mollusks in Hokkaido, Kamchatka, and the Alaska Peninsula in the late Miocene and early Pliocene.

Flow through the Bering Strait,is controlled by,sea level change and changes in the amount of perennial sea ice,Pliocene–Pleistocene trends,"Flow through the Bering Strait is likely controlled mainly by sea level change and changes in the amount of perennial sea ice. Pacific to Arctic flow through the Bering Strait (\~0.8 Sv) (Coachman and Aagaard,  1981)  significantly  influences  the  Pacific–Atlantic partitioning of physical and nutrient properties in the modern ocean and was possibly quite sensitive to past changes in sea level change because of its shallow sill of \~50 m (see Takahashi, 2005, for an illustration of the cross section). During glacial intervals, Atlantic Ocean biogenic sedimentation and preservation became more Pacific-like and vice versa, and there were major changes in nutrient distributions. Drilling near the Bering Strait will help resolve whether major changes in Pacific–Atlantic partitioning of oceanographic properties were related to changes in flow through the Bering Sea. Neodenticula seminae, a dominant extant subarctic Pacific diatom, was found recently in Atlantic waters, possibly because recent warming and melting sea ice in the Arctic Ocean provided a passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic (Berard-Therriault et al., 2002; Corbyn, 2007; Reid et al., 2007).

Overall, the sediments recovered in the Bering Sea are a mixture of three components: biogenic (mainly diatom frustules with varying proportions of calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, silicoflagellates, and radiolarians), siliciclastic (mainly silt and, secondarily, sand and isolated pebble- to cobble-sized IRD clasts), and volcaniclastic (mainly fine ash). Other accessory lithologies identified include authigenic carbonates (dolomite and aragonite) and sulfides.

Expedition 323,preserve,record of sedimentation ranging from the late Pliocene through the Holocene (between 1.74 Ma and recent),Lithostratigraphic summary,"All sites drilled during Expedition 323 preserve a record of sedimentation ranging from the late Pliocene through the Holocene (between 1.74 Ma and recent). Lithologies and sedimentation rates vary between the different sites, as indicated by a basin-wide comparison of the evolution of sedimentation in the Bering Sea during this period (Fig. F16). The lowest sedimentation rates (only 4.5 cm/k.y.) were observed at Site U1342, where laminated foraminifer-rich diatom ooze beds alternate with silty clay beds at scales ranging in the Milankovitch band (Fig. F19). The same temporal  interval corresponds to a much thicker section at Sites U1340 and U1341 (Figs. F17, F18), where the bedding alternations are less distinct and the abundance of IRD is higher. Although lamination is common at Sites U1342 and U1340, laminae are very rare at the deeper Site U1341, suggesting a shallow depth of the OMZ during most of the Pleistocene. At the Bering Sea slope site, sedimentation rates are about three times higher than at the Bowers Ridge sites.

The sections are pervasively bioturbated, and laminated intervals are rare. Overall, sedimentation on the Bering slope is characterized by a higher influence of both siliciclastic material delivered by ice sheets and terrigenous sedimentation derived from the continental shelf and slope, which are indented by some of the largest submarine canyons in the world. However, because of their proximity to the continents, it is not clear whether the sediments characterized by high siliciclastic content are recording periods of ice sheet expansion (stadials) or increased runoff (interstadials).

In contrast to the Bering slope sites, there are some marked long-term trends in the Bowers Ridge records. A notable change in Site U1341 logging K% data occurs at \~425 m depth (Fig. F24), along with an increase in observed silt content and dropstones in the sediment (Fig. F16). This depth in the section is equivalent in time to \~3 Ma and may signify that the Bering Sea regional expression of NHG includes an increase in clays and silts delivered via sea ice or icebergs to Bowers Ridge. The fact that K% decreases above this point in the section even while the ice ages persisted is difficult to explain. One possibility is that the warmer climate of the Pliocene facilitated the formation of K-rich clays on land, which were then shed into the Bering Sea once the ice ages began. K-rich clay formation could have then decreased when the climate cooled. NGR, magnetic susceptibility, and sedimentological smear slide and descriptive data indicate increasing amounts of terrigenous material upsection, with a pronounced increase at \~1 Ma, probably due to a greater supply of ice-rafted siliciclastics to Bowers Ridge once large 100 k.y. glaciations occurred.",10,Expedition 323 summary

On the other hand, the abundance of Actinocyclus spp. (Fig. F27) clearly increases through the Pliocene, suggesting changes in stratification/watermass circulation as the colder climate developed. This is generally true for Sites U1340 and U1341 at Bowers Ridge and for Site U1343 off of the Bering slope. Data from Site U1344, however, provide a more complicated picture than this and do not show a clear trend, probably because of the overwhelmingly high abundance of sea ice–associated diatoms such as T. antarctica spores (Abelmann, 1992a) (\~25% during 4–0.9 Ma; \~40% during 0.9–0 Ma) (Fig. F27). Both at Bowers Ridge and at the Bering slope, marked declines were seen for both taxa (Actinocyclus spp. and N. seminae) around the MPT (Fig. F27), although the exact timing of the decline is site and taxa specific. Nevertheless, the upheaval of both taxa at the MPT is notable. During intervals of high eutrophic levels, suggested by high Actinocyclus spp., cooler, low trophic subarctic Pacific waters, indicated by N. seminae, were introduced into the Bering Sea. This is based on the geographic and seasonal distributions of A. curvatulus, which appears to be ecologically similar to Thalassiosira latimarginata s.l. and, to a lesser extent, N. seminae (Sancetta, 1982; Takahashi, 1986; Takahashi et al., 1989).

Higher bottom water oxygen conditions appear to correlate with glacials. Furthermore, Sites U1340, U1343, and U1344 contain well-preserved foraminifers over the last 2 m.y., with increasing absolute abundances of benthic and planktonic taxa across the MPT (\~0.8–1.1 Ma), in association with an increase in abundance of the polar planktonic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral). This cooling trend was also observed as an increase in the abundance of sea ice dinoflagellates and diatoms and intermediate water–dwelling radiolarians (e.g., C. davisiana). Cooling of the surface waters would have enhanced ventilation of the intermediate waters during glacials and increased density stratification during interglacials, contributing to the drop in dissolved-oxygen  content  in  the  intermediate  and bottom waters at these times, which is suggested by the increase in deep infaunal benthic foraminifer taxa.",14,Expedition 323 summary

In contrast, at Bowers Ridge, sulfate concentrations decrease subtly and penetrate to the basement at Site U1342, suggesting very low rates of microbially mediated sulfate reduction and the absence of AOM at present. The difference in microbial activity at these sites might be caused by different rates of water column productivity and sedimentation.",15,Expedition 323 summary
