# Introduction  

This chapter documents the primary procedures and method s employed by the operational and scientific groups during the offshore and onshore phases of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 357. This information concerns onl y shipboard and Onshore Science Party (OSP) methods described i n the site chapters. Methods for postexpedition research conducte d on Expedition 357 samples and data will be described in individua l scientific contributions. Detailed drilling and engineering operations are described in the Operations section of each site chapter.  

# Site locations  

For all sites, coordinates supplied by the proponents from previous site surveys were used as a guide for positioning at the propose d coring locations (Figure F1). Coordinates were supplied to th e bridge via daily operations plans and were used to center the dynamic positioning (DP) system over the specific drill operating a t each site (i.e., the Meeresboden-Bohrgerät 70 [MeBo] drill at th e stern of the vessel and the British Geological Survey (BGS) RockDrill2 [RD2] drill over the aft port side). In order to maintain statio n accuracy, the DP system ran for ${\approx}15{-}20\$ min at each site to build  a reliable DP model prior to operations. An ultra-short baseline beacon was attached to each drill, communicating with a transceiver o n a pole that was lowered from the starboard side to ${\approx}3.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth, giving an accurate hole position and water depth. Coordinates in this report refer to the beacon positions on the drills rathe r than the position of the vessel. Table T1 summarizes the distance s between Expedition 357 holes and sites.

# Multibeam site surveys undertaken during the expedition  

Prior to coring operations, a multibeam echo sounder surve y was conducted to accurately place the break of slope against tw o preexisting bathymetric data sets and the site locations. Multibea m surveys were also conducted during down time and periods of ba d weather when drilling operations could not be performed. The RR S James Cook operates a hull-mounted Kongsberg Simrad EM12 0 deep-sea multibeam echo sounder with an operating frequency o f $12\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and 191 beams. To improve resolution and analysis of slop e angles at each drill site, the beam angle on the EM120 was decreased to $45^{\circ}$ from the normal $60^{\circ}$ . EQANGLE (equal angle) bea m spacing was used to improve the resolution in the central swat h area, and $\mathrm{{min/max}}$ depth settings were varied in an attempt to reduce the impact of outliers. In marginal weather conditions, seafloor detection was forced to only resolve below a certain dept h (force depth) to assist with bottom detection. The combination o f the above parameters gave a swath width approximately twice th e water depth.

The sound velocity profile used was taken on 5 November 201 5 and logged using the MIDAS sound velocity profiler (SVP) to 100 9 m water depth. The sound speed transducer was set to “profile” fo r most of the multibeam survey. However, on 20 November, th e transducer was set to “sensor” to utilize the surface sound velocitie s in marginal weather conditions. Heading, attitude, and positionin g information were provided by the Seatex Seapath 200 positionin g sensor. Sensor locations and offsets were all verified against the vessel’s 2014 Blom Survey Report.  

The survey lines allowed between $50\%$ and $100\%$ overlap with  a survey speed of $5{-}6~\mathrm{kt}$ . The combination of beam focusing, surve y speed, and overlap percentages meant that a $50\,\mathrm{m}$ resolution surfac e could be generated within Caris HIPS and SIPS hydrographic survey software (version 9.1) to assess each location for slope prior t o landing each rock drill. This procedure was later supplemented b y further multibeam surveys over Atlantis Massif, the Atlantis Fracture Zone, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and some of the conjugate margin when all coring operations were suspended due to sea state. Th e swath settings used were the same as for the initial site surveys, wit h the vessel running at a speed between 5 and $6\,\mathrm{kt}$ with variable lin e spacing dependent on depth. The surveys were run by either th e vessel’s system support technician or the Expedition Project Manager, depending on shift patterns. Initially, raw data were provide d for use by the science party along with $50\,\mathrm{m}$ resolution geotiff metadata, with preliminary data cleaning undertaken by the vessel’s system support technician. More detailed data cleaning was late r undertaken by a marine geophysicist from the BGS at the request o f the science party, removing anomalous data and outliers. This wa s done in Caris, generating fully cleaned $50\textrm{m}$ and $20\textrm{m}$ resolutio n per pixel surfaces and associated data sets:  

• Cleaned x, y, z file, • Fledermaus generated .sd file, • Geotiff image, and • ArcGrid ASCII file.  

Because prior bathymetry of Atlantis Massif was acquired with  a resolution of ${>}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ per pixel, the new survey provides a muc h more detailed view of the tectonic, volcanic, and mass-wastin g structures of the area (Figures F2, F3).  

# Operational equipment  

# Drilling platform  

The maximum required depth of the boreholes was 70 meter s below seafloor (mbsf), and water depth ranged between 720 an d $1770\;\mathrm{m}$ . Because of the scientific need to acquire good quality core s of the surface carbonate cap and hard rocks at depth and the potential to plug the boreholes to enable future observation, it was decided to utilize seabed drill technology. Therefore, a multirol e oceanographic vessel and two seabed drills were selected to carr y out Expedition 357 coring. The RRS James Cook, an $89.2\;\mathrm{m}$ long research vessel with DP capability (Figure F4), was donated as an “inkind” contribution from the UK’s Natural Environment Researc h Council (NERC). The RRS James Cook has sufficient capacity b y way of food and accommodation for $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ operations for up to 5 0 days.  

# Seabed drills  

Two seabed drill systems were utilized during Expedition 357 : the BGS RD2 (Figure F5) and the Center for Marine Environmenta l Sciences (MARUM; Bremen, Germany) MeBo70 (Figure F6). Bot h drills are remotely operated systems that are lowered onto the seabed, with power and control maintained from the surface via a n umbilical cable. The systems use multiple drill rods and core barrel s to progressively penetrate into the seabed. They are both based o n an HQ size coring system (rod outer diameter $[\mathrm{OD}]=88.9\;\mathrm{mm}_{\mathrm{}}$ ; ro d inner diameter $=77.8~\mathrm{mm}$ ; reaming shell diameter $=97.8\ \mathrm{mm}$ ) an d produce $61.1\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter cores collected in steel core barrels. Th e core diameter is similar to standard IODP cores, whereas the hol e

diameter, $98~\mathrm{mm}$ (RD2) or $103~\mathrm{mm}$ (MeBo), is narrower. By sittin g on the seabed, the drills do not require heave compensation an d consequently have good control on bit weight. These circumstance s are analogous to land-based mine coring, where a thin-walled parallel drill string with a core barrel and liner is locked into an oute r bottom-hole assembly (BHA) barrel. Each system has the capacit y to operate with either a clear polycarbonate liner or stainless steel split liners.  

The RD2 is a lightweight system (5 ton in water). It is a remotel y operated multibarrel wireline drill capable of coring up to 55 mbs f (Figure F5). Drill rods, core barrels, wireline logging tools (se e Downhole logging), and borehole plug units (see Borehole plugs ) are stored in tool racks. The maximum length that can be cored b y each barrel is $1.72\,\textrm{m}$ . The RD2 is self-contained with its ow n Launch and Recovery System (LARS) and dedicated winch, occupying a basic deck footprint of $5\mathrm{~m~}\times\mathrm{~10~m~}$ . The system additionall y includes four 20 ft containers (control, mechanical and electrical workshops, and spares). Launch and recovery is controlled wirelessly by one person. The RD2 has a maximum operating wate r depth of $4000\;\mathrm{m}$ . Sensors on the drill enable the operator to monito r pitch and roll of the system and to inform adjustment of the extendable legs to achieve the requisite vertical position of the drill for operations. The top drive provides a maximum $405~\mathrm{rpm}$ .  

The MeBo (Figure F6) is a portable drill rig lowered to the seabed on a steel armored umbilical cable, allowing it to be remotel y operated from a control cabin on the vessel. It weighs 7.5 tons (i n water) and is capable of working in water depths up to $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ . Th e drill has two rotating magazines that hold the drill rods, core barrels, wireline logging tools, and borehole plug units and can core t o a maximum depth of 70 mbsf. It has four plate-like feet that can b e individually adjusted to maintain the vertical position required fo r coring operations. Sensors, video cameras, and lights are used t o monitor performance while on the seabed. The maximum lengt h each core barrel can core is $2.5~\mathrm{m}$ . The top drive provides a maximum of $200~\mathrm{rpm}$ . The complete MeBo LARS is mounted on a be d plate tailored to the vessel. During Expedition 357, the LARS required the use of the RSS James Cook’s “A” frame (with a minimu m capacity of 20 tons). Accompanying this are four 20 ft container s (winch, control, workshop, and spares).  

# Coring methodology  

To ensure flexibility during operations, a number of differen t drill bits were available for coring. The diamond cutting bit is on th e outer BHA barrel, with an OD of $103\;\mathrm{mm}$ for the MeBo drill and 9 8 mm for the RD2 drill. Both drills maximized flexibility during drilling operations by deploying the drills with 2–4 BHAs, often wit h different bits installed, on each dive. The MeBo drill utilized 20/3 0 surface-set (Geogem) and G4 impregnated (DATC) bits. The RD 2 drill utilized 30/40 surface-set (Geogem), 60/80 surface-set (Rockmax), and G7 and G10 impregnated (Rockmax) bits. Seawater wa s the drilling fluid utilized in all holes, with no addition of muds.

Because rig floor and seafloor are effectively the same when using seabed drill technology, many of the IODP depth convention s are  not  appropriate  (IODP  Depth  Scales  Terminology  a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines).  All  depths  ar e therefore reported as meters below seafloor.  

# Additional developments  

The scientific drivers for IODP Expedition 357 required the development of several bespoke pieces of equipment designed o r modified to be operated remotely from the seabed drills (FrühGreen et al., 2015):  

• A water sensor/sampling package mounted on both seabed drills for monitoring in situ parameters and collecting water flushing out of the borehole (details available in Water sampling and sensor package data),   
• A tracer injection system mounted on both seabed drills to inject perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PFC) into the drilling fluids to assess potential contamination of core materials (details available in Microbiology),   
• Borehole plugs for sealing off drilled boreholes to prevent fluid circulation and enable future fluid sampling access (details available in Borehole plugs), and   
• Wireline logging tools (details available in Downhole logging).  

# Water column operations  

Before commencing drilling operations at each site, a cast of th e ship’s conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) Niskin rosett e system was undertaken to capture a water column profile prior t o coring and any associated disturbance (Figure F7). With bottom water a priority, three Niskin bottles were fired at the bottom of th e cast, and one was fired near the surface (see Water sampling an d sensor package data). The other three Niskin bottles were fired a t equal spacing in the water column. The CTD used on the RRS Jame s Cook incorporated the following:  

![](images/ec15d7ef18929437b232b0ff41221d09c47cfac84e43cbaf330dfc779c4bc472.jpg)

• 10 Niskin bottles (6 were used),   
• Chelsea Technologies Group (CTG) AquaTracka MkIII fluorometer,   
• CTG AquaTracka MkII transmissometer,   
• Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE) 43 dissolved oxygen sensor,   
• Benthos 916T altimeter,   
• SBE 3P primary and secondary temperature sensor,   
• SBE 4C primary and secondary conductivity sensor,   
• Digiquartz pressure sensor, and   
• WETLabs BBRTD light scattering sensor.  

In addition to the site-related CTD casts, a deeper cast was conducted in the Atlantis Fracture Zone to $4135\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth, an d another was conducted in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to $4221\;\mathrm{m}$ wate r depth. The purpose of these casts was to provide baseline geochemistry readings at sites located away from Lost City and any possibl e venting of methane or hydrogen.  

The ship’s crew deployed the CTD, firing the Niskin bottles according to a depth schedule provided by the offshore Science Part y members. Sensor data were recorded in the Sea-Bird Seasave (v7 ) software package, and the processed data were exported as CN V and ROS files.  

# Shipboard scientific procedures  

# Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples  

Expedition numbers for IODP expeditions are sequential, starting with 301. Drilling sites are numbered consecutively, and for  a European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) Science Operator (ESO)–operated platform, numbering starts wit h Site M0001 (the $^{\ast}\mathrm{M}^{\prime\prime}$ indicates the ESO-operated mission-specifi c platform [MSP]). For Expedition 357, the first site was Site M0068. Multiple holes may be drilled at a single site, with the first hole assigned the site number with the suffix “A,” the second hole the sit e number and the suffix “B,” and so forth. For sites where coring wa s not conducted but CTD casts were undertaken, the suffixes ${}^{\infty}\mathrm{X}^{\prime\prime}$ an d $^{\ast}{\cal Z}^{\dprime}$ were applied.  

The cored interval is measured in meters below seafloor as measured by the drilling apparatus. For Expedition 357, the cored interval consisted predominantly of the entire drilled section, with onl y one hole (M0072B) having a short open-hole section of $0.825\,\mathrm{m}$ . Recovered core is cut into sections with a maximum length of $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ and numbered sequentially from the top, starting at 1 (Figure F8). By convention, material recovered from the core catcher is treate d as a separate section labeled $^{\omega}\mathrm{CC}^{\upsilon}$ (core catcher) and placed belo w the last section recovered in the liner. The core catcher is assigne d to the top of the cored interval if no other material is recovered. When recovered core is shorter than the cored interval, the top o f the core, by convention, is equated to the top of the cored interval t o achieve consistency in reporting the depth in core.  

Any sample removed from a core is designated by distance measured in centimeters from the top of the section to the top and bottom of the sample removed. A full identification number for  a sample consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, piece number (for har d rock), and interval in centimeters measured from the top of section. For example, a sample identification of “357-M0069A-3R-2, 35–4 0 ${\mathrm{cm}},^{\prime\prime}$ represents a sample removed from the interval $35{-}40~\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 2, Core 3R ( ${}^{\iota}\mathbf{R}^{\prime\prime}$ indicates core type; see be

low), from Hole M0069A during Expedition 357 (Figure F8). Al l IODP core identifiers indicate core type. For Expedition 357, th e following abbreviations are used:  

• $\mathrm{O}=$ noncoring assembly/open hole.   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rotary coring.  

The meters below seafloor of a sample is calculated by addin g the depth of the sample below the section top and the lengths of all higher sections in the core to the core-top datum measured with th e drill rods.  

# Core handling during the Expedition 357 offshore phase  

Because Expedition 357 utilized seabed drills, all core materia l arrived on deck at the same time. It was therefore necessary to modify the usual IODP core flow to accommodate this novel samplin g scheme, which is illustrated in Figure F9. Because of the ephemeral nature of the microbiology and geochemistry samples (see Microbiology and Geochemistry), it was decided that the deepest cor e would be the first to be unloaded from the drill tool racks and delivered to core curation and sampling because it had been in the cor e barrel for the least amount of time and represented the most pristine sample. Subsequently, each core barrel, working from deepes t to shallowest in the hole, was removed from the tool racks and delivered to the curation bench. Plastic “tags” were clipped onto eac h liner removed from the core barrels identifying the core run number to prevent confusion from working in reverse order. To preven t cores from warming up, they were temporarily stored in a $+4^{\circ}C$ temperature-controlled reefer if they could not be immediately curated. As the core barrels were unloaded from the drill tool racks, liner fluid was collected for PFC tracer, cell counts, and organic acids analyses.  

As soon as a core was removed from the core barrel, it underwent preliminary curation by the ESO curators and was cut int o maximum $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ length sections. Where metal splits were used instead of polycarbonate liner, the core was transferred from the split s into polycarbonate liner by the curators prior to marking and cutting the cores into sections. Each section was sealed at the top an d bottom by a color-coded plastic cap in line with IODP convention: blue for the top of a core section, white for the bottom, and yello w where a whole-round core (WRC) sample for microbiology was removed. The core lengths in each section were entered into the Offshore Drilling Information System (OffshoreDIS). No core splittin g took place during the offshore phase of the expedition.  

# Curation procedures and core processing  

Because the deepest core was anticipated to have changed th e least with respect to the microbial communities, a WRC was take n prior to any further curation or nondestructive analyses (see Microbiology). The WRC was photographed to document removed material.  Core  sections  were  then  transferred  to  a  fast-trac k multisensor core logger (MSCL) on which high-resolution $\left(2\ \mathrm{cm}\right)$ magnetic susceptibility data were acquired without allowing an y time for temperature equilibration of the cores (see Physical properties). After the fast-track MSCL, for the second deepest core an d every other core moving uphole, a WRC was taken for later microbiology subsampling (see Microbiology). Next, all core section liners were permanently labeled with an engraving tool. The shipboar d petrologist made a brief description of the core recovered throug h the clear plastic liner. Cores were allowed to equilibrate to ambien t temperature in the petrophysics laboratory before being measure d on the standard MSCL (MSCL-S) with a measurement resolution o f $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ (see Physical properties). Following this, a small thin sectio n billet was cut for thin sectioning and bulk rock characterization. The cores were then transferred to a $+4^{\circ}C$ temperature-controlle d reefer for shipping back to the IODP Bremen Core Repositor y (BCR; Germany).

Curation procedures and core processing for sediment cores  

For sediment cores, initial sampling of liner fluid and full curation of the core into sections (including permanent labeling of sections through engraving) was completed, and the sections were the n measured on the fast-track MSCL. Windows were then cut into th e liner at specific points for syringe microbiological sampling and insertion of Rhizons for interstitial water (IW) sampling. The shipboard petrologist made a brief description of the core recovere d through the clear plastic liner, and the cores were then measured o n the MSCL-S and stored in the reefer, as described above.  

# Core handling during the Expedition 357 Onshore Science Party  

The OSP was held at the BCR from 20 January to 5 Februar y 2016. The onshore core flow is summarized in Figure F10. Prior t o the OSP, and hence before splitting, all cores were measured for natural gamma radiation (NGR) and underwent $360^{\circ}$ through-line r high-resolution digital line scanning (see COREDESC in Supplementary material; see Physical properties).  

After removal from refrigerated storage, cores were describe d through the liner by the structural, igneous, and metamorphic petrologists using the $360^{\circ}$ scans as a guide (see Core description) . Once this preliminary description was completed, the line-scan images were marked up by the structural geologists to indicate the preferred orientation for core splitting. The cores were split lengthwis e into working and archive halves from top to bottom.

Figure F10. Core flow for the onshore phase of Expedition 357.  

The working and archive halves were taken for high-resolutio n digital line scanning, both wet and dry, followed by color reflectanc e spectrophotometry measurements on the archive halves. The archive halves were then described by the structural, igneous, an d metamorphic petrologists aided by thin sections (see Core description), including the preferred locations for shipboard sampling, t o ensure comprehensive coverage of all lithologies and structural features. Following description, archive halves were wrapped in polyethylene (PE) stretch film and put back into the core repositor y reefer.  

On completion of core description, the working halves wer e sampled, following a Sample Allocation Committee (SAC) meetin g to agree on sample locations. The first samples taken were for IOD P minimum measurements, including paleomagnetism analysis o n discrete cubes, physical property measurements ( $P_{\|}$ -wave and moisture and density [MAD]), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and bulk roc k measurements (see Physical properties, Paleomagnetism, Geochemistry, and Core description). Analyses were conducted o n samples taken offshore, as were total carbon (TC)/total inorgani c carbon (TIC) measurements (see Geochemistry). Additionally, standard geochemical measurements were performed on fluid samples collected during the offshore phase.  

Following these measurements, sampling for postexpedition research was undertaken, following review by the entire science party. Locations for preferred samples were indicated using stickers, an d these were reviewed by the SAC prior to postexpedition sampling. The working halves were then wrapped and moved to the core repository reefer. Each sample taken was logged into the Expeditio n Drilling Information System (ExpeditionDIS).  

# Data handling, database structure, and access  

Data management during the offshore and onshore phases o f Expedition 357 had two stages. The first stage was the capture o f metadata and data. Central to this was the ExpeditionDIS, whic h stored information about drilling, core curation, sampling, and primary measurements. The second stage was the longer term postexpedition archiving of Expedition 357 data sets, core material, an d samples. This function was performed by the World Data Center fo r Marine Environmental Sciences (PANGAEA) and the BCR.  

The ExpeditionDIS is a flexible and scalable database syste m originally developed for the International Continental Scientifi c Drilling Program (ICDP) and adapted for ESO. The underlying dat a model for the ExpeditionDIS is compatible with those of the othe r IODP implementing organizations. For the specific expedition platform configuration and workflow requirements of Expedition 357, the ExpeditionDIS data model, data import pumps, and user interfaces were adapted to form the Atlantis Massif ExpeditionDIS (DI S Version 6). This also involved some new functionality, including th e set-up of predefined series for quicker entry of microbiology samples, interstitial water subsamples, and CTD water samples.  

The ExpeditionDIS was implemented in SQLServer-2008 R2 installed on a central server with Microsoft-based client PCs connecting to the system through a Microsoft Access 2010 user interface. The work on DIS development is carried out by Smartcube GmbH.  

Offshore, the ExpeditionDIS was used to capture metadata related to core and sample curation and downhole logging, store cor e catcher and WRC sample photographs, and to print section, sample, and subsample labels. During Expedition 357, Niskin wate r samplers with CTD were used to collect water samples prior t o drilling (standard CTD) and during drilling (sensor package). Th e metadata from these tools and resulting samples were also capture d in the ExpeditionDIS. Additionally, the database stored primar y measurement data:  

• MSCL data (both MSCL-S and fast-track MSCL) and • Visual core descriptions (VCDs) of core catcher material, core sections (through liner), and WRC samples taken for microbiology.  

The expedition scientists and ESO staff generated a variety o f spreadsheet files, text documents, and graphics containing operational and scientific data, geological descriptions, and interpretations. Therefore, in addition to the structured metadata and dat a stored in the ExpeditionDIS, all data files were stored in a structured file system on a shared file server. Full backups of the serve r were made twice daily, incremental backups were made continuously, and the main server was also replicated on the backup server. The European Petrophysics Consortium was responsible for th e capture and processing and archive of the downhole logging dat a (see Downhole logging).  

On completion of the offshore phase of the expedition, the ExpeditionDIS database and file system were transferred to the BC R to continue data capture during the OSP. On shore, additional dat a were captured in the ExpeditionDIS, including samples, thin section scans, thin section photomicrographs, core close-up images, high-resolution line-scan images (for both through-liner and spli t cores), color reflectance data, thin section data, NGR data, and full VCDs of split cores. All other data were loaded to the shared fil e server.  

During the onshore phase, line-scan images were viewed in th e core description laboratory across three screens using the Corelyze r Corewall application.  

After the expedition, the sampling and core curation data wer e exported from the ExpeditionDIS to CurationDIS, the long-ter m BCR core curation system.  

During the second stage, all Expedition 357 data were transferred to the PANGAEA information system. PANGAEA is a member of the International Council of Scientific Unions World Dat a Centre system. It has a flexible data model that reflects the information processing steps in earth science fields and can handle any related analytical data (Collier, 2015; Diepenbroek et al., 1999, 2002). It is used for processing, long-term storage, and publication of georeferenced data related to earth sciences. Essential services supplie d by PANGAEA are project data management and distribution of visualization and analysis software. Data management functions include  quality  checking,  data  publication,  and  metadat a dissemination that follows international standards.  

The data captured in the Atlantis Massif ExpeditionDIS and th e data stored on the shared file server were transferred to PANGAE A following initial validation procedures. The data transfer proces s was completed by the time of publication of the expedition report s section of this Proceedings of the International Ocean Discover y Program volume. Until the end of the moratorium period, data access was restricted to the expedition scientists. Following the moratorium, all data except downhole wireline data were publishe d online (http://www.pangaea.de), and PANGAEA will continue t o acquire, archive, and publish new results derived from Expeditio n 357 samples and data sets. Downhole wireline data were archived a t http://brg.ldeo.columbia.edu/logdb with a link from PANGAEA.  

IODP MSP data are also downloadable from the MSP data portal a t http://iodp.pangaea.de.  

# Core, section, and sample curation using the Atlantis Massif ExpeditionDIS  

Expedition 357 followed IODP protocols and naming conventions (see Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples). The ExpeditionDIS captured the curation metadata and printed th e appropriate labels, also to IODP standards. The curation metadat a comprise  

• Expedition information,   
• Site information (latitude, longitude, water depth, start date, and end date),   
• Hole information (hole naming by letter, latitude, longitude, water depth, start date, and end date),   
• Core information (core number, core type, top depth, bottom depth, number of sections, core catcher availability, curator on shift, time and date for core on deck, and any additional remarks),   
• Section data (section number and length, curated length, and curated top depth),   
• Sample information (repository, request number, code observer, expedition, site, hole, core, section, half, sample top and sample bottom, and sample volume),   
• Calculated core recovery percentage (on the basis of drilled or cored length versus curated recovery), and   
• Calculated section recovery (on the basis of section length versus curated recovery).  

# Core description  

Core material from Expedition 357 was subject to descriptio n during both the offshore and onshore phases. As is standard fo r MSPs, cores were not split offshore but were cut into sections (se e Introduction). Recovery was variable, and cores exhibited drillinginduced fracturing in some intervals. However, numerous intac t and continuous sections of core were recovered, which indicate d that significant drilling-induced rotation had not occurred, an d those cores preserve the relative orientation of veins, contacts, an d other structures.  

Macroscopic and petrographic core observations made durin g the offshore and onshore phases of Expedition 357 are stored i n handwritten and electronic media (see COREDESC in Supplementary material). Preliminary lithologic descriptions were made offshore by the Co-Chief Scientists on microbiology whole-roun d samples and on the remaining WRCs through the plastic liners. I n some cases, photographs were taken of cores through the liner wit h a handheld camera. These photographs were provided to the science party prior to the onshore phase of the expedition. At the OSP, detailed rock descriptions and measurements of the cores throug h the liners followed by descriptions on split cores were made b y teams assigned to three disciplines: igneous petrology, alteratio n petrology, and structural geology.  

At the OSP, observations and measurements were carried out o n the archive halves of the cores, except where otherwise noted. Al l observations and measurements for each site were recorded o n IODP VCD forms (see COREDESC in Supplementary material; see Core descriptions) and entered as input variables in the ExpeditionDIS. Observable parameters in the ExpeditionDIS were fixe d drop-down menu items, free text, and predefined value lists of mineralogy and features related to structure, veins, and fractures.  

# Offshore visual core description  

During the offshore phase of Expedition 357, general lithology , structure, lithologic contacts, major vein generations, and crosscutting relationships were summarized using preliminary descriptiv e terminology and definitions and a simplified version of the VC D form. When possible, macroscopic descriptions were confirme d with observations on small fragments of the core using a binocula r microscope. Samples taken offshore for microbiology were photographed on two sides where possible (see MBIOWRC in Supplementary material) and briefly described. Microbiological sample s taken on board have the notation “MBio.” Where microbiology samples were taken from intervals of coherent rock, $2{-}5\;\mathrm{cm}$ slabs wer e cut for OSP thin section and bulk rock analyses.  

# Onshore visual core description  

# Though-liner descriptions  

Prior to the OSP, NGR was measured on the unsplit cores, an d through-liner digital images were taken of the outside of each core, rotated $90^{\circ}$ with each pass (four in total for each core section), covering the whole circumference (see Physical properties). Becaus e of the heterogeneity of the cores, a preliminary description was conducted prior to splitting to determine the most appropriate axis fo r cutting the cores. The preliminary description included rock type, metamorphic alteration, and structures through the liner, recorde d on A2-sized prints of the core line scans (see COREDESC in Supplementary material). The desired cutting line was drawn in re d wax pencil on the liner and the printed image. Core were split, initially keeping the two sides together, and then carefully separate d into archive and working halves. The cut core was curated, and th e archive half was described following the methods explained belo w (Figure F10).  

# Cut-core descriptions  

During the onshore phase of Expedition 357, detailed macroscopic descriptions of lithology, alteration features, structures, an d major vein generations and crosscutting relationships were recorded by hand on A3-sized VCD forms that included scanne d split-core images (see COREDESC in Supplementary material) . Two teams of petrologists and structural geologists working i n shifts described the igneous petrology, metamorphic petrology, an d structural features of all cores and thin sections. Each team was assigned shifts that provided time and space to examine the cores an d ensure overlap with the other team for information exchange. At th e beginning of the OSP, each expertise group agreed on descriptiv e terminology and definitions for each type of measurement, whic h were summarized in classification diagrams and glossaries. Afte r core descriptions were complete, the petrological and structural data were entered as input variables in the ExpeditionDIS and recorded in logs as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (see COREDESC i n Supplementary material).  

# Classification and description criteria  

A summary of the lithologies, line-scan images, core recovery , and most pertinent macroscopic features in each hole are represented graphically in the compiled VCDs (see Core descriptions). VCD information was plotted as symbols, patterns, and line plot s against depth using the commercial plotting program Strater. A n example of a VCD is shown in Figure F11, and a summary of th e legend used for lithologic units and alteration types used in th e sheets is given in Figure F12. Tabulated section data were extracte d from the ExpeditionDIS or Excel spreadsheets. The locations o f samples taken for microbiology and onshore analyses are noted i n the Shipboard samples column. Complete macroscopic descriptions and measurements are available for each site in the VCDs an d in the igneous, metamorphic, and structural core logs (see COREDESC in Supplementary material). Microscopic descriptions o n petrographic thin sections were made on selected samples at eac h site and recorded in thin section logs as Excel files (see COREDES C in Supplementary material). The science party also selected ke y intervals for shipboard XRD and bulk rock analyses.

Interval descriptions and lithologic units  

Lithologic characterization was based on the homogeneity of intervals recovered within a section of core. If sequential intervals an d pieces were homogeneous with respect to magmatic or alteratio n features, they were combined into one lithologic unit and describe d macroscopically in the corresponding ExpeditionDIS input form. Lithologically and texturally similar pieces or intervals from consecutive core sections were curated as the same lithologic unit. If a contact (e.g., change in primary mineralogy, color, grain size, o r structural or textural variation) was recognized within a given piec e or interval, a new lithologic section unit was defined and described. In this way, all important lithostratigraphic information was preserved on a truly descriptive basis. Where contacts and/or boundaries deviated from horizontal within the core reference frame, thei r depths were logged on the right-hand side of the cut face of the archive half when viewed upcore. A summary of the lithologic units, including the description of the lithologic contacts, was logged int o the corresponding ExpeditionDIS section unit input form. Subdivisions were occasionally defined for specific intervals where subtl e changes in lithology occur over short intervals (e.g., grain size an d modal abundance of principal phases).  

![](images/47d3ba29c244d4e19194e3258ee8bf635ed37d9f0ffd6eadd92449aacc65785b.jpg)  
Figure F12. Lithologies, symbols, and abbreviations used in VCDs, Expeditio n 357.  

Based on the description of lithologic intervals and their contacts, coherent rock type units were defined on a broader, more interpretative scale after discussions with the entire scientific party. Description, characterization and explanations, and reasoning fo r combination of lithologic units are summarized for each hole separately in the Lithology, alteration, and structure section of each sit e chapter. Entries into ExpeditionDIS include each lithologic interval; core, section, interval; interval depth (in mbsf) of top and bottom; piece numbers; complete lithologic name (of the principal litholog y and modifiers, if used); and description of the contacts. Averag e grain sizes and modal contents of the principal minerals for individual intervals can be obtained from the VCDs (see Core descriptions).  

# Contacts between lithologic intervals and units  

Distinctions between lithologic units include the following: • Contact nature: sharp, gradational, and sutured (contacts where individual mineral grains interlock across the contact).  

• Contact geometry: planar, curved, or irregular. • Degree of deformation and relationship to bounding units: sheared, foliated, diffuse, or fractured.  

# Dikes/veins  

The term “dike” refers to any sharp, well-defined, and relativel y thick $({>}1\ \mathrm{cm})$ crosscutting feature formed by injection of magma. This contrasts with “igneous vein,” which describes a thin $\left(<1\;\mathsf{c m}\right)$ crosscutting feature formed by injection of magma with generall y less well defined contacts. Dikes were generally designated as individual intervals, whereas igneous veins were typically designated a s subintervals or noted within the section description. Igneous vein s are described in Igneous protoliths and petrology; veins that ar e mineralized fractures and their infilling mineral phases and texture s are described in Alteration and metamorphic petrology.  

# Core disturbances  

Seabed drilling during Expedition 357 produced relatively continuous sections of core that often preserve primary relationship s between lithologic units and veined intervals. However, drilling often resulted in fracturing and core disturbance. The following categories of core disturbances were recorded as a comment in th e ExpeditionDIS:  

• Undisturbed.   
• Slightly disturbed: possible core rotation and cracking.   
• Moderately disturbed: partial fracturing.   
• Highly disturbed: fragmented framework and fractured intervals.   
• Rubble: drilling-induced strong fragmentation and formation of rubbly pieces.   
• Soupy: water-saturated intervals that show loss of cohesion.  

# Lithologies  

# Sediment, breccia, and rubble  

At a number of sites, sediment cores were collected at the top o f the massif, which can provide information about the timing and tectono-depositional history after the surface of the massif was exposed on the seafloor. Sediment components were describe d offshore on simplified VCD forms, but no detailed lithostratigraph y was determined. Distinctions were made according to sedimen t type, degree of lithification, and composition and structure of detrital components. The sedimentary sequences include the following:  

• Unconsolidated calcareous ooze or sand, commonly with abundant foraminifers.   
• Variably lithified, fossiliferous calcareous sediment with lithic fragments and commonly with abundant foraminifers. The lithic fragments occur in varying amounts and have varying lithologies, angularity, and sizes.   
• Breccias with varying amounts and composition of fossiliferous carbonate matrix and varying lithologies, angularity, and sizes of the lithic fragments. These can be matrix supported or clast supported.  

The cores also comprised several intervals of the following:  

• Fine sandy to gravelly sediment with basement composition. Their origin is unknown but may be attributed to drilling-induced fragmentation. We recorded the lithologic nature, angularity, and sizes of lithic fragments, as well as the color and, if possible, the composition of the finer grained material. • Polymict breccia with subangular to angular clasts of serpentinite, metagabbro, and metadolerite in a carbonate matrix.  

The origin of these breccias was subject to discussion: (1) sedimentary in origin with a matrix lacking obvious foraminifers or (2) tectonic in origin with extensive posttectonic carbonation of a finely grained cataclastic matrix. In several instances, this question was answered with the observation of thin sections.  

# Igneous protoliths and petrology  

For consistency, qualitative measurements including unit contacts and lithologic variations were discussed between the igneou s petrologists during each shift crossover. The rocks recovered durin g Expedition 357 were generally moderately to highly altered but i n many cases preserved igneous precursor textures. Igneous unit s were defined on the basis of estimates of primary igneous rock type s and textures. Where primary textures were preserved, minera l modes were estimated visually (after Compton, 1962). Subinterval s with subtle variations or sharp changes in grain size and/or mod e on a centimeter scale were grouped into a single lithologic unit. I f significant, minor variations within a unit were described in the tex t of the hard rock VCDs and entered into the ExpeditionDIS. Minera l habits, igneous structures, and igneous fabrics were also recorded, as well as the nature of igneous contacts. Details of individual measurements are given below.  

# Primary minerals  

In oceanic plutonic rock, the primary rock-forming minerals ar e olivine, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, amphibole, FeTi oxides, sulfides, and rarely quartz. Four major classes of roc k (peridotite, gabbro, dolerite, and basalt) are delineated on the basi s of their igneous mineral assemblages and texture. Textures are defined on the basis of grain size, grain shape and habit, preferre d mineral orientation, and mineral proportions.  

For each primary silicate observed, the modal percentage withi n the lithology was visually estimated. In many cases, the estimatio n of primary modal mineralogy involved the observation of secondar y mineralogy and inference from likely replacement reactions (e.g., replacement of plagioclase by chlorite). Visually estimated moda l percentages likely reflect the primary igneous assemblages prior t o alteration in most cases. Accessory phases such as additional oxid e minerals, sulfide minerals, or others (e.g., zircon) were also note d where observed.  

For each mineral where grain boundaries were distinguishable, the minimum, maximum, and modal grain size was recorded alon g with any observations of mineral shape and habit (see below). Grai n size refers to the average long dimension of the minerals and i s given in millimeters, as are the minimum and maximum crysta l sizes. The following definitions and criteria were used.  

• Dominant grain size: • Very fine: ${<}0.2\;\mathrm{mm}$ . • Fine: $>\!0.2–1.0\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{mm}}$ . • Medium: $>\!1.0{-}5.0\ \mathrm{mm}$ . • Coarse: $>\!5{-}30\ \mathrm{mm}$ .   
• Mineral shape: euhedral, subhedral, and anhedral.   
• Mineral habit: • Equant: aspect ratio $<\!1\!:\!2$ . • Subequant: aspect ratio 1:2 to 1:3. • Tabular: aspect ratio ${>}1{:}3$ to 1:5. • Elongate: aspect ratio $>\!1\!:\!5$ . • Lath-shaped: long and narrow, as for tabular-elongate. • Granular: aggregate of interlocking roughly equant crystals.  

# Oxide and sulfide minerals  

The abundance of primary Fe-Ti oxides and sulfides in the core s was visually estimated. Textures of oxide and sulfide minerals ar e described in terms of the habit of the mineral and its relationshi p with adjacent minerals. Relative sulfide abundance in hand specimen was visually estimated when possible. Oxide observed in han d specimens was divided into the following categories:  

• Disseminated: scattered grain to grain clusters with no pronounced fabric. • Interstitial network: oxides that occur interstitial to silicates.  

In hand specimens, oxide minerals are also differentiated according to morphologies: euhedral, anhedral, angular aggregates, amoeboidal aggregates, and interstitial lenses. “Euhedral” and “anhedral” are used where isolated individual grains are present an d oxide grain boundaries are observable. In plutonic rocks, oxide s commonly occur as aggregates, and for grain size determination, a n aggregate is counted as a single grain.  

# Plutonic and mantle lithologies  

Igneous mafic and ultramafic rocks recovered during Expedition 357 are classified on the basis of abundance, grain size, and texture of their primary minerals based on the International Union o f Geological Sciences (IUGS) system (Streckeisen, 1974; Le Maitre, 1989; Le Bas and Streckeisen, 1991) (Figure F13). Plutonic roc k names were assigned on the basis of primary phases present prior t o alteration. We have attempted to follow as closely as possible the descriptions from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 153 and 20 9 and Integrated Ocean Drilling  Program  Expeditions 304/305, 309/312, 335, and 345 to allow comparison of these records. According to the definition of the Streckeisen (1974) diagram, gabbro s are the most prevalent mafic plutonic rock in Expedition 357 core s and are defined as  

plagioclase $^+$ clinopyroxene $>95\%$ ; plagioclase $>10\%$ , clinopyroxene $>10\%$ ; quartz $<5\%$ .  

![](images/d6c3e856d0c28d9592dfac649e0b774e498d415c84bfb0404ae05294fd45c3ff.jpg)  
Figure F13. Modal classification scheme for plutonic igneous rocks, Expedition 357 (after Streckeisen, 1974).  

For ultramafic rocks, we define peridotite as containing olivine, spinel, and varying amounts of pyroxene, in which olivine makes u p greater than $40\;\mathrm{mod}\%$ of the rock. Accessory phases in the peridotites include spinel, plagioclase, ilmenite, chromite, and magnetite. The ultramafic protoliths of lithologies encountered during Expedition 357 are as follows:  

• Dunite: olivine ${}>\!90\%$ and spinel.   
• Harzburgite: olivine $(40\%{-}90\%)\ +$ orthopyroxene $(5\%{-}60\%)\ +$ clinopyroxene $-5\%$ and spinel.   
• Porphyroclastic harzburgite: harzburgite with distinct, variably aligned porphyroclasts of relict orthopyroxene. Porphyroclasts are generally angular to lenticular in shape and show varying degrees of brittle deformation.  

If a mafic rock exhibits the effects of dynamic metamorphis m such that the assemblage consists of secondary minerals that completely obliterate the protolith mineralogy and texture or if the roc k is made up of recrystallized primary minerals such that the origina l igneous protolith cannot be recognized, the appropriate metamorphic rock names such as “serpentinite” or “talc-amphibole-chlorit e schist” are used. If primary assemblages and their pseudomorph s and textures can be recognized in ultramafic samples, even thoug h they were partially or completely replaced, the rock name used i s based on the reconstructed primary assemblage and IUGS classification and is termed either “serpentinized” or “altered” (e.g., serpentinized  dunite,  altered  harzburgite,  etc.).  In  some  cases, serpentinization is accompanied by and/or overprinted by metasomatic talc-amphibole $\pm$ chlorite alteration, which is described a s metasomatically altered peridotite or metasomatically altered serpentinite. Where the modal abundance of secondary hydrous minerals exceeds $50\%$ in mafic plutonic rocks, the prefix “meta-” wa s used with the igneous protolith name where possible (see Alteration and metamorphic petrology). If the rock exhibits the effect s of dynamic metamorphism such that the assemblages consist o f secondary hydrous minerals that completely obliterate the protolit h texture or are made up of recrystallized primary minerals, the appropriate metamorphic rock names were used. The textural term s “mylonitic” and “schistose” (see Structural geology) where the textures are visible but not completely developed were added to metamorphic rock names such as “serpentinite” or “metagabbro” t o indicate that the rocks exhibit the effects of dynamic metamorphism.  

# Plutonic rock textures  

Igneous fabrics that were distinguished include “lamination ” and “lineation” for rocks exhibiting a preferred orientation of mineral grains and “clusters” for mineral aggregates.  

Some troctolite and lesser gabbro contain clinopyroxene oikocrysts. These oikocrysts are a macroscopic feature with a distinctiv e texture clearly observable in the cores. The oikocrysts have a welldefined spherical or augen-like habit that shows a clear boundary t o the troctolitic or, less commonly, gabbroic matrix. Chadacrysts (enclosed grains) within the oikocrysts are clearly visible and are typically plagioclase. Olivine generally only occurs at the outermos t rim. Because of their well-defined habit and clear relationships wit h other minerals, oikocrysts are easily identified with the naked eye. Poikilitic clinopyroxene grains are often very irregular in shape, forming large irregular clusters, with much less defined contact relations relative to the matrix. In more olivine rich gabbros, thes e clinopyroxenes also include olivine as chadacrysts, irrespective o f whether they are located in the central part or rim of the clinopyroxene. Macroscopic observations concerning oikocrysts ar e consistent with microscopic observations.  

# Volcanic and hypabyssal rocks  

Basalts were described on the basis of grain size, phenocrys t content (if any), and vesicles. If present, phenocrysts were used a s modifiers in front of the rock name with a hyphen in between, according to their abundance. In the IUGS classification, “basalt” i s defined on the basis of mineral mode or composition; grain sizes ar e variable. Dolerite is synonymous with diabase and refers to an intrusive basaltic rock emplaced as dikes or sills and characterized b y subophitic to ophitic texture of plagioclase laths and augite, whic h could only be recognized in thin sections.  

Where vesicles were observed in igneous rocks, their moda l abundance $(\%)$ , size (minimum, maximum, and modal sizes in millimeters), roundness (rounded, subrounded, or well rounded), an d presence of vesicle infilling were documented.  

# Igneous textures  

We use the terms equigranular, inequigranular, and intergranular (only visible in thin sections) to describe the grain size distributions of igneous rocks. Inequigranular textures may be furthe r described as seriate (continuous range of crystal sizes) or poikiliti c (relatively  large  crystals  of  one  mineral—oikocryst—enclosin g smaller crystals of one or more other minerals—chadacrysts). Additional terms used are specific for the different habits of individual minerals, such as interstitial, poikilitic, acicular, lath-shaped, skeletal, and columnar (for more terms used, see Shelley, 1993). Th e most common igneous textures and volcanic rock terms employe d are as follows:  

• Igneous textures: • Granular: aggregation of grains of approximately equal size. • Ophitic: total inclusion of plagioclase in clinopyroxene. • Subophitic: partial inclusion of plagioclase in clinopyroxene. • Equigranular: all minerals are of one size. • Inequigranular: two or more populations of grain size occur. • Seriate: crystals of the principal minerals show a continuous range of sizes. • Varitextured: domains with contrasting grain size are present. • Porphyritic: phenocrysts $(\mathrm{>}1\%)$ are surrounded by finer grained groundmass. • Poikilitic: relatively large crystals of one mineral (oikocryst) enclose smaller crystals of one or more other minerals (chadacrysts).

# Volcanic rock and hypabyssal rock textures  

The textural distinction between dolerite and microgabbro i s based on the presence or absence of subophitic or ophitic textures. For basaltic rocks, the proportions and characters of phenocrysts, grain sizes, and vesicles define the textures. Phenocrysts are described for each mineral according to their abundance. The dominant grain size for all plutonic rocks was recorded as in the igneou s textures list above.  

Mineral modifiers such as “plagioclase-bearing” or “olivine-rich ” were used to subdivide the rock types more accurately on the basi s of significant mineralogical or textural differences rather than arbitrary cutoffs based on the abundance of a single mineral. For pervasively altered rocks, the term “primary mineralogy” or “primar y assemblage” is used to refer to the estimated prealteration mineral s or mineral assemblage.  

Description of mafic igneous rocks follows that of ODP Leg 17 6 (Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999) and Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Expeditions 304/305 and 345 (Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006; Gillis et al., 2014), where the following modifiers base d on modal mineralogy were used:  

• Lithology modifiers: • Oxide: $>\!2\%$ oxides, typically Fe-Ti oxide. • Olivine: $>\!5\%$ olivine. • Troctolitic: $5\%{-}15\%$ clinopyroxene, ${>}20\%$ olivine $>\!5\%$ in gabbro). • Anorthositic: ${>}80\%$ plagioclase.   
• Descriptive modifiers: • Leucocratic: light colored; high proportions of plagioclase. • Micro: rocks with a dominant grain size of ${<}1\;\mathrm{mm}$ . • Doleritic: fine- or medium-grained gabbroic rock with dominant ophitic or subophitic textures.   
• Mineral modifiers: • -bearing: $1\%{-5\%}$ of a mineral within a lithology. • Disseminated: $1\%{-}2\%$ of a mineral dispersed throughout the lithology.  

# Alteration and metamorphic petrology  

Metamorphic characteristics of Expedition 357 drill cores wer e determined using onshore VCDs, thin section descriptions by microscopy, and XRD analyses. The metamorphic petrology tea m worked in shifts and met daily to minimize measurement inconsistencies and agree on methodology and terminology. Alteratio n characteristics and metamorphic veins were described in handwritten VCDs, reported in Excel logs, entered into the ExpeditionDIS, and presented in compiled VCDs (see Core descriptions). For definitions of metamorphic terms used in the VCDs and logs, see Tables T2 and T3; criteria for describing veins followed the schem e shown in Figure F14. Compiled VCDs provide overview information on the intensity and nature of alteration types. These data ar e presented alongside consideration of primary mineral assemblage s and structural observations.  

In this volume, the terms “metamorphism,” “alteration,” and “hydration” are used loosely and interchangeably without making implications about open- versus closed-system behavior. The term s “serpentinization,” “rodingitization,” “talc-amphibole-chlorite metasomatism,” and “oxidation” are used to describe the predominant alteration types and imply a chemical change in the composition o f the primary ultramafic or mafic rocks. Because we were not able t o macroscopically evaluate changes in bulk composition, we considered the alteration reactions as primarily corresponding to the addition of $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ and calcium, the gain or loss of silica, and the oxidatio n of ferrous to ferric iron.

# Alteration textures  

Alteration textures and their relationships to the primary phase s in the mafic and ultramafic rocks are generally related to the hydration of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase, where present. Durin g Expedition 357, intervals with the following textures related to serpentinization, metasomatism, and oxidation were documented:  

• Serpentinization textures: hydration textures after olivine and pyroxene; serpentine recrystallization textures and serpentine veins.   
• Metasomatic textures: rodingitization and talc-amphibolechlorite metasomatism.   
• Oxidation textures: typically indicated by a change in color to more red/orange, which either occurs pervasively or locally. The color change is considered to be primarily related to iron oxidation.  

A description of the alteration of strongly fractured rock fragments and clasts within cataclastite are described in the comment s field of the ExpeditionDIS.

# Serpentine alteration textures  

Ultramafic rocks recovered during Expedition 357 were interpreted to be mantle rocks that experienced (1) high-temperature, dynamic metamorphic recrystallization during upwelling and melting in the mantle, in some instances creating macroscopically identifiable protogranular or porphyroclastic textures, followed by (2)  a stage of lower temperature static replacement and/or dynamic recrystallization during emplacement and alteration near the seafloo r under lower temperature, hydrous conditions (see Structural geology). Altered ultramafic rocks show varying degrees of alteration, drilling-induced fracturing, and crystal-plastic deformation. Alteration is dominated by serpentinization reactions and serpentinebearing mineral assemblages that progressively replace primary olivine and orthopyroxene. The main alteration products of olivin e are typically serpentine, magnetite, and brucite; however, brucit e has not been identified through microscopic observation or by XR D analyses of core samples. In altered oceanic peridotites, serpentin e can be found as five different types with different crystallographi c properties: lizardite, chrysotile, and more rarely antigorite, as wel l as polygonal and polyhedral serpentines. Lizardite and chrysotil e are the most common serpentine phases at mid-ocean ridges. Antigorite is not strictly a polymorph because of its slightly highe r $\mathrm{Si/Mg}$ ratio compared to stoichiometric serpentine. Where hydrou s alteration in ultramafic rocks was so extensive that estimation of th e primary phase assemblages was not possible, the rock was calle d “serpentinite.” In cases where primary assemblages and texture s could still be recognized, the adjective “serpentinized” was adde d before the protolith name (e.g., serpentinized dunite and serpentinized harzburgite).  

Textures of serpentines include three types: (1) textures after olivine and pyroxene hydration, (2) recrystallization textures, an d (3) veins. We adopted the following definitions for the most common serpentine occurrences in the altered peridotites recovered a t Atlantis Massif:  

• Mesh texture: serpentine texture after olivine that resembles a fisherman’s net. It can be identified at the macroscopic scale but is more easily identified at the microscopic scale. This texture develops along olivine grain boundaries and intragranular microfractures that define the mesh cells. Mesh cells are composed of mesh rims, generally of pseudocolumnar lizardite growing orthogonally to the hydration front and toward the mesh center, and mesh cores, made of olivine relics or isotropic serpentine. A mesh texture contains mesh cells with rims of similar width. In contrast, cells of ribbon textures have rims of different widths resulting from spatially heterogeneous serpentinization, highlighting a hydration-preferential orientation. In the hourglass texture, mesh rims reach the cell center and mesh cores do not exist.

Figure F14. Vein classifications used in the vein log, Expedition 357.  

• Bastite: serpentine texture after pyroxene (generally orthopyroxene). Serpentinization progresses from the pyroxene grain boundaries, cleavage planes, and intragranular microfractures toward the center of the grain, often resulting in a pseudomorphic texture that mimics the primary pyroxene shape and preserves important features of the protolith (e.g., cleavages and plastic deformation).   
• Interlocking texture: microscopically, this texture is composed of equant to spherulitic serpentine grains. It develops by recrystallization of a mesh texture or occasionally a bastite texture.   
• Interpenetrative texture: microscopically, this texture is composed of elongated serpentine grains that form blades. The orientation of these blades varies from random to preferential. It develops by recrystallization of a mesh texture or occasionally a bastite texture.   
• Fibrous veins: typically lens-shaped veins in which continuous chrysotile fibers link the two walls of the vein. The fibers are sometimes visible at the macroscopic scale.   
• Banded veins: typically continuous veins presenting an infill made of thin bands parallel to the vein walls. At the macroscopic scale, the infill looks homogeneous.  

• Lamellar, granular isotropic veins: veins generally showing irregular, nonmatching walls and homogeneous infill. At the microscopic scale they are filled with serpentine lamellae growing from each wall of the vein toward its center, triangular-shaped serpentine sectors producing black cross-extinction under cross-polarized light, and an isotropic serpentine.  

Magnetite is commonly present in all of these textures, observe d as tiny grains that concentrate along microfractures in the mesh o r in serpentine veins. It forms after olivine hydration and incorporates part of its iron under reduced and oxidized forms. Furthe r definitions are provided in the glossary (Table T3). Observation s and measurements of serpentine fabrics are discussed further i n Structural geology and are summarized in Figure F15.  

# Metasomatic alteration  

Talc-amphibole-chlorite alteration  

The ultramafic and gabbroic rocks recovered during Expeditio n 357 show varying degrees of metasomatic alteration to talc-rich, amphibole-rich, and/or chlorite-rich assemblages. They appear a s distinctly light green to white rocks with a soapy feel and are usuall y very fractured and variably sheared (even if static replacement i s also observed). They locally show pervasive overprinting of the precursor mineral assemblage with varying proportions of talc, amphibole,  and  chlorite $\underline{{\boldsymbol{\pm}}}$ serpentine).  At  a  microscopic  scale, metasomatic zones are characterized by very fine grained talc-amphibole-chlorite intergrowths. Based on Boschi et al. (2006), th e abundance of the three minerals is strictly linked to the protolith.  A gabbroic protolith tends to be more chlorite and amphibole ric h (with minor talc and no serpentine), whereas an ultramafic protolith is talc dominated, with variable proportions of amphibole an d chlorite.  

The talc-rich rocks with an ultramafic protolith occasionall y preserve the original porphyroclastic texture with precursor ribbo n or mesh serpentine, in which case these rocks could also be referre d to as talc-amphibole serpentinites. Serpentine is present in relic t domains, but it is also observed as newly formed crystals intergrown with talc or as localized pockets of recrystallized antigorit e with nonpseudomorphic interlocking texture. Talc occurs as a replacement product of groundmass serpentine and may occur together with tremolite $\pm$ chlorite as alteration products of bastit e pseudomorphs after orthopyroxene.  

Strongly foliated talc-amphibole-chlorite schists are the mos t distinctive fault rocks at Atlantis Massif. They typically show a heterogeneous mylonitic texture characterized by strong foliation defined by shape-preferred orientations, which is locally overprinte d by a crenulation lineation. The mylonitic planar foliation is composed of alternating layers of variably sized synkinematic talc, Caamphibole, and chlorite. Occasionally, lenses are embedded tha t have a sigmoidal texture and represent strongly deformed orthopyroxene porphyroclasts. Pyroxene ribbons are commonly altere d to patches of talc $^+$ amphibole $\pm$ chlorite and show strong undulos e extinction,  subgrain  structures,  and  dynamic  recrystallization, mainly along the rim of the ribbons. Kinematic indicators in th e talc-amphibole-chlorite schists include asymmetrical foliation patterns, pressure shadows around pyroxene porphyroclasts, and local folds. These indicators indicate normal slip top-to-east (toward th e spreading axis) or southeast (toward the transform). Crenulatio n lineation is defined by amphibole neoblasts that formed at a hig h angle to the foliation, suggesting that amphibole continued to gro w after the formation of the mylonitic foliation.  

![](images/65d76bb0cef1ea56db94a2cb30025d7bb773f601bfcce77252749eb654869d6a.jpg)  

In contrast to the talc-rich rocks, alteration to amphibole-ric h assemblages commonly obliterates the primary textures and precursor mineral paragenesis, preventing an unequivocal petrographic determination of the protoliths. Moreover, amphibole-ric h rocks have alteration textures that are distinct from those of talcrich rocks. Amphibole-rich rocks consist of well-crystallized, elongate, and often aligned amphibole that wraps around lenses an d patches of amphibole $\pm$ chlorite that resemble porphyroclasts. Some of these lenses are conceivably pseudomorphs after pyroxen e porphyroclasts. Porphyroclasts are generally deformed and elongated, commonly bent, and display patchy, undulose extinction. Acicular grains of amphibole locally define pressure shadow s around the crystals and define the foliation. Talc is typically absen t in these rocks, or it occurs only locally with fine-grained needles o f amphibole  and  chlorite  as  pseudomorphs  of  orthopyroxen e porphyroclasts. Amphibole-rich rocks generally show geochemica l characteristics that outline either a mafic or an ultramafic protolit h veined by mafic intrusion.  

# Rodingitization  

The term rodingite is used for metasomatized mafic rocks associated with serpentinites and chlorite-rich zones (blackwall alteration) that are characterized by incipient “Ca-metasomatism” or b y an increase in the $C{\mathrm{a/Si}}$ ratio. Macroscopically, rodingites appear a s a dense white and pink to pinkish brown rock surrounding smaller, darker remnants of coarse-grained protolith. In thin section, th e darker domains consist of green actinolitic amphibole that typicall y replaces primary clinopyroxene. Amphibole typically coexists wit h both coarse- and fine-grained prehnite (comprising white zones i n hand samples) associated with very fine grained aggregates of prismatic clinozoisite with minor titanite and chlorite (concentrated i n pink zones). Prehnite forms faintly yellowish white lamellar to plat y aggregates, and some of the plates occur as fan-shaped arrays. Finegrained aggregates of clinozoisite appear as cloudy darker areas, an d small pockets of bluish chlorite can occur together with titanite.  

# Oxidation  

Here we use the term oxidation to imply that the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ in Fe-bearing minerals in ultramafic or mafic rock has been partly to completely oxidized to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ , which is reflected by a change in color t o red or orange due to low-temperature aqueous alteration (weathering) of the basement rocks that is well known along slow-spreadin g ridges. This alteration produces minor to dramatic textural an d compositional modifications, depending on the age of the rock. F e oxyhydroxides, clay minerals, and calcium carbonate fill multipl e generations of brittle fractures. Oxidation, including formation o f goethite and/or hematite, is one of the first steps of the weatherin g process. Oxidation of serpentinites usually affects veins, mesh texture, and bastites. Strong weathering of mafic or ultramafic rock s typically  includes  precipitation  of  secondary  low-temperatur e (phyllo)silicate minerals such as palygorskite, smectite, saponite, nontronite, and Fe-rich montmorillonite.  

# Alteration handwritten VCDs and logs  

The onshore handwritten VCD forms and alteration logs (se e COREDESC in Supplementary material) provide information o n (1) the predominant type of alteration and the intensity and exten t of replacement of primary minerals by secondary minerals an d (2) the nature and approximate modes of secondary mineral assemblages. They also record overprinting alteration relationships an d any association between alteration and deformation fabrics. Excep t for simple cases, estimates of individual modes of alteration minerals were only possible where thin sections or XRD data were available.  Where  several  intervals  or  pieces  showed  simila r characteristics, secondary mineral modes were assigned to th e whole group on the basis of thin section or XRD analysis.  

Some of the observations made on the VCDs were reported o n the alteration log (see COREDESC in Supplementary material), which describes alteration assemblages and textures on an interva l basis. The intervals in the alteration log do not necessarily correspond to the lithologic intervals defined by the igneous petrolog y team. Alteration assemblages were described by color and estimated mineralogy and refined by thin section and XRD study.  A distinction was made between overprinting alteration assemblage s and assemblages localized by preexisting lithologic changes. For example, a core of serpentinized dunite containing a gabbro dike altered to a talc-amphibole-chlorite assemblage is described as thre e discrete intervals on three rows in the log. On the other hand, a cor e of serpentinized dunite containing an interval with vein halos is described using two rows: one long interval of serpentinized dunit e and a shorter interval containing the overprinting vein halo assemblage. In the latter case, textures are assigned a percentage corresponding to the surface they occupy in the sample and the vein dat a are logged separately unless the vein had an extensive halo.  

The alteration log summarizes the site, hole, core, section, an d depth range of the core interval considered, as well as quantificatio n of the texture extent and intensity of the identified alteration minerals. The types of textures include the following:  

• Serpentinization,   
• Rodingitization,   
• Talc-amphibole-chlorite metasomatism,   
• Oxidation,   
• A category grouping other occasional textures primarily observed in the mafic rocks, and   
• A category indicating mixed alteration types, when the relative abundances could not be determined (e.g., rubble intervals with varying types of altered clasts).  

When present, any alteration texture was associated with a percentage representing its proportion on the core cut face (such tha t the sum of all alteration texture areal proportions is $100\%$ ). Typically, several of these alterations were identified within the sam e lithologic intervals because alteration style and intensity commonl y vary with primary igneous mode.  

Intensity of alteration was recorded for each texture. It represents an estimate of the proportion of primary minerals replace d by secondary minerals (i.e., the reaction advancement). This estimate was refined when thin section and XRD data observation s were available. The scale used for documenting the intensity was a s follows:  

• Fresh: $-2\%$ .   
• Slight alteration: $2\%{-}20\%$ .   
• Moderate alteration: $21\%{-}40\%$ .   
• High alteration: $41\%{-}80\%$ .   
• Very high alteration: $81\%{-}95\%$ .   
• Total alteration: ${>}96\%$ .  

Characterization of alteration textures was completed by an indication of their geometry and distribution throughout the interval:  

• Pervasive: alteration affecting the entire background.   
• Localized: alteration occurring along specific features of the host rock, such as fractures and rims.   
• Patches: polycrystalline domain, more or less isolated from the rock background, whose alteration is distinct from the host rock.  

Finally, secondary minerals that were clearly identifiable wer e listed (serpentine, talc, amphibole, chlorite, magnetite, carbonates, oxides, and sulfides).  

# Veins and alteration halos  

During Expedition 357, a combined vein log was recorded i n conjunction with the structural geology team (see COREDESC i n Supplementary material). Veins and vein sets were recorded on a n interval basis, and vein-free intervals were also noted. Where several vein types were present in an interval, they were recorded o n separate rows. In the metamorphic/alteration part of the vein log, we recorded vein color and secondary minerals present. Vein textures were classified using a series of codes (Figure F14) and recorded in the following terms:  

• Shape: straight, sigmoidal, irregular, pull-apart, and fault vein.   
• Connectivity: isolated, single, branched, network, en echelon, crosscutting, ribbon, parallel, and anastomosing.   
• Texture: massive, cross-fiber, slip-fiber, vuggy, and polycrystalline.   
• Structure: uniform, banded, composite, haloed, and intravenous.  

Any vein that did not fit into the classification scheme was entered as a separate code and described in a comment. The color an d width of alteration halos that bind veins were recorded, along wit h comments on general appearance. Acronyms used in the alteratio n and vein logs and thin section description forms are listed in Tabl e T2.  

# Structural geology  

Structural observations and measurements carried out durin g Expedition 357 generally followed the conventions adopted durin g Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 304/305 and 345, which in turn were based on previous hard rock drilling program s (e.g., ODP Legs 118, 131, 140, 147, 153, 176, 179, and 209). Wher e procedures followed directly from previous expeditions, reference s to the appropriate Explanatory notes and Methods chapters ar e given.  

# Overview of macroscopic structural descriptions  

Whole cores were oriented for cutting by the structural geolog y team at the OSP. Cores were marked to maximize dip on plana r structures so that the dominant structure dips toward $270^{\circ}$ in th e core reference frame (i.e., toward the right looking down at the cu t surface of the archive half) and equal proportions of any featur e (rock type, deformation fabrics, veins, etc.) are preserved in bot h the working and archive halves. Where no obvious structures wer e present, cores were marked to maximize contiguity with adjacen t core intervals or core pieces. The sign convention for the core follows the paleomagnetic conventions of a right-hand rule with $+z$ a s vertical and downcore (Figure F16).  

All descriptions and structural measurements were carried ou t on the archive halves. Structural data were entered into a VCD for m used in conjunction with various spreadsheet logs to obtain downhole tectonic measurements (see COREDESC in Supplementar y material). Hand-drawn structural sketches made on VCDs wer e used to illustrate the most representative structures and crosscutting relationships in a core section and were scanned as PDF files; i n addition, a brief general description of the structures was entere d into the ExpeditionDIS and printed on the final versions of th e VCDs (see Core descriptions). Five additional spreadsheets wer e used for recording specific structures and measurements durin g core description. Description and orientation of all structural features followed the criteria summarized in Figure F15. Data were recorded using curated depth so that “structural intervals” could b e correlated with lithologic core descriptions and included the following:

• Orientation and type of metamorphic veins and open fractures.   
• Brittle and semibrittle structures: fractures, gouge, breccia, and cataclasite, including cataclastic/semibrittle fabric intensity.   
• Schistose structures and style (in talc-, amphibole-, chlorite-, and/or serpentine-bearing intervals): undeformed to strongly oriented, planar, anastomosing, and/or S-C.   
• Crystal-plastic deformation (primarily in gabbro and peridotite): mylonitic foliation and sense of shear.   
• Igneous structures: magmatic foliation, compositional layering, shape-preferred orientation of minerals or mineral alignment, and any igneous contacts and their characteristics (e.g., gradational, magmatic vein, and intrusive).  

# Structural measurements  

Structural features were recorded in centimeters from the top o f each core section. Depth was defined as the point where the structure intersects the right-hand $(270^{\circ})$ side of the cut face of the archive half (Figure F16) or, if the feature does not appear, the dept h of the centroid of the feature projected to the right-hand side of th e core. Where they occur, crosscutting relationships were describe d with core section depth. Apparent microfault displacements of planar markers were recorded as they appeared on the cut face of th e archive half of the core. Shear sense indicators (asymmetric shea r bands, asymmetric pressure shadows around porphyroclasts, bending of fabrics toward zones of high strain, imbrication of elongatio n of clasts in cataclasite, etc.) were also noted on the spreadsheets. Slickenside and/or slickenfiber orientation trend and plunge measurements or the trend and plunge direction of the slip line betwee n offset linear markers were incorporated when possible to determin e dip-slip, oblique-slip, or strike-slip components. Observations o f lineations (slickenside and/or slickenfiber) were limited because o f the highly fracture nature of the core.  

# Fabric intensities  

A semiquantitative scale of deformation and alteration fabric intensities was used during core description. These scales, shown i n Figure F15, were modified from the deformation scales used durin g ODP Legs 176 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999) and 209 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004). Where possible, we assigned specifi c values to intensity estimates (e.g., vein spacing or matrix percentag e in a cataclastic zone). For some categories, however, classificatio n was difficult (e.g., the intensity of any crystal-plastic fabric), i n which case we used the previously adopted qualitative estimates o f intensity based on hand-specimen and thin section observations. We documented distinct types of fabric intensity measurements:  

• Magmatic: presence and intensity of any shape-preferred orientation of magmatic phases. Four levels, from no shape-preferred orientation (0) to strong shape-preferred orientation (3), were used.  

• Crystal-plastic: six levels of deformation intensity were used (for gabbroic rocks), ranging from a lack of any crystal-plastic fabric (0) through three stages of foliation and porphyroclast development (1–3) to mylonitic and ultramylonitic fabrics (4–5). The textural criterion used for gabbroic rocks, on which this was based, was modified slightly for peridotite to also include six levels of deformation intensity ranging from undeformed protogranular (0) through three stages of porphyroclast development (1–3) to mylonite and ultramylonite (4 and 5). Occasionally, it proved difficult to differentiate between crystal-plastic and cataclastic/semibrittle deformation in relatively high strain shear zones based on hand-specimen observations only. In this case,  

we listed the structures in both spreadsheets and described the structures in detail in the VCDs.   
• Schistosity intensity and style: four levels of schistose fabric were used based on the intensity of fabric development, ranging from random (0) to weakly, moderately, or strongly oriented (1– 3). Styles of schistosity include planar, anastomosing, S-C/shear bands, or mixed.   
• Cataclastic/semibrittle: six levels of deformation intensity were used with fabrics depending on the percentage of matrix present within each cataclastic zone. Thin section descriptions, wherever available, significantly aided this categorization.   
• Brittle/open fractures and cracks (fractures without displacement): four levels of joint density were used, depending on the average frequency of open fractures and/or cracks across a 10 cm depth interval along the right-hand $(270^{\circ})$ side of the core. Fractures were distinguished from faults (cataclastic features) by the lack of any identifiable offset. Some sections of the core contained small subhorizontal microfractures commonly related to unloading accompanying drilling. The same scale as for fractures (0–3) was used for the density of these drilling-induced features.   
• Veins: six levels of vein density were used, depending on the average frequency of veins across a $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ depth interval along the long axis of the core. Alteration veins are those that contain metamorphic phases. In some cases, these veins may have originally been igneous, but no primary phases or their characteristic pseudomorphs were recognized. Magmatic veins are compositionally distinct mineral segregations that may be concordant or discordant.  

For each of the structural logs (alteration, vein, brittle deformation, plastic deformation, and magmatic structure), one or mor e successive depth intervals within each core were defined with  a common structural characteristic, and, when possible or relevant,  a representative structural measurement (orientation and dip) of individual structures or a set of structures (e.g., faults, veins, cracks, foliation, and schistosity) was recorded. Structural units in the different logs for a given core can be different based on core characteristics.  

# Fabrics in serpentinized peridotites  

Abyssal peridotites represent a special problem for grading crystal-plastic deformation because they have commonly been emplaced from the mantle by high-temperature crystal-plastic cree p processes and therefore lack a primary igneous texture. They generally have either protogranular or porphyroclastic textures when unmodified by relatively shallow deformation processes associate d with unroofing and exposure to the seafloor. Protogranular texture s are generally the earliest fabric and are characterized by smoothl y curved grain boundaries with complex cusps and lobes (Figur e F15). However, alteration has generally entirely obscured olivin e grain size and shape in hand specimens in abyssal peridotites, an d visual core description is almost entirely based on pyroxene and spinel textures. Crystal-plastic deformation grades, therefore, are a s follows:  

• 0: purely protogranular texture; this is the earliest formed texture and may or may not have a preferred crystallographic mineral fabric or a shape fabric. Porphyroclastic textures are generally superimposed on protogranular textures, and frequently elements of both are present. In this case, we used the name of the predominant texture; the intensity grade 0.5 indicates that elements of both textures are prominent.  

• 1: (porphyroclastic) texture defined by relict orthopyroxene if there is only a weak or no pyroxene shape fabric developed. • 2: (porphyroclastic) pyroxene exhibits a significant shape fabric, noting that only a few protogranular textural elements are present; these intervals are still referred to as porphyroclastic. • 3: (protomylonite) the shape fabric is strong with well-developed foliation accompanied by significant grain size reduction (protogranular abyssal peridotites generally have a pyroxene grain size of around $3{-}6\;\mathrm{mm}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ). At this grade, there are generally no relict protogranular textural elements. • 4: (mylonite) peridotite has significant grain size reduction and consists of a fine-grained mass of olivine with embedded pyroxene porphyroclasts and prominent foliation. • 5: (ultramylonite) no foliation is visible because of extreme grain-size reduction.  

This deformation scale closely parallels that used for gabbr o here and during previous legs/expeditions and represents very similar or the same intensities of deformation at each grade.  

# Thin section descriptions  

Thin sections were described by members of the core description teams and entered into an Excel template. Observations mad e on thin sections were used to inform core descriptions and integrated into the igneous, metamorphic, and structural sections fo r each site. Most samples were altered, and estimates of primary mineral modes were made based on alteration assemblages and texture s where possible, but these estimates should be considered approximate and preliminary. Estimates were made of modes of alteratio n minerals based on visual observation, but many samples are ver y heterogeneous, so these are also approximate. Structural observations were entered in a comments section, and a list of photomicrographs with brief comments was added. Thin section descriptio n spreadsheets were signed by the principal observer. Thin sectio n spreadsheets are available in Core descriptions, and microphotographs made during description are available in COREDESC i n Supplementary material.  

# X-ray diffraction  

# Sample preparation  

Dried bulk rock samples (see Geochemistry) were reduced i n size with a stainless steel impact mortar and pestle (Chemplex). Rock chips were then ground by hand to a fine powder ${\sqrt{<}}20\,\upmu\mathrm{{m}}$ particle size to prevent particle size effects) using an agate mortar an d pestle and/or a Planetary Micro Mill “Pulverisette $7^{\circ}$ (Fritsch) as indicated in Geochemistry. Dry samples were milled with agat e grinding bowls and balls at a rotation speed of $600~\mathrm{rpm}$ for $2~\mathrm{min}$ followed by a 1 min pause to allow the material to cool. This proces s was repeated three times. To clean the device between samples,  a teaspoon of quartz (fine granular, washed, and calcined for analysis; Merck) was milled and then the grinding bowls and balls wer e washed twice with pure ethanol.  

# Instrument parameters  

XRD pattern analyses were conducted in the Crystallograph y research group laboratories (Department of Geosciences, University of Bremen [Germany]). Powders were prepared and measure d with the Philips backloading system to prevent preferential orientation of grains. Analyses were conducted on a high-end Philip s X’Pert Pro multipurpose diffractometer equipped with a Cu-tub e $(\mathrm{K}\lambda\,1.541,45\,\mathrm{kV},40\,\mathrm{mA})$ ), a fixed divergence slit of $0.25^{\circ}$ , a 15 sampl e changer, a secondary monochromator, and the X’Celerator detecto r system. Measurements were done by continuous scanning from $3^{\circ}$ to $^{85^{\circ}2\theta}$ with a calculated step size of $0.016^{\circ}26\$ . The calculated tim e per step was $50\;{\mathsf s}.$ . A standard deviation of $\pm5\%$ is the general reproducibility of the measurement for mineral groups with ${>}20\%$ cla y fraction (Moore and Reynolds, 1989). For well-crystallized mineral s including olivine, pyroxene, and the carbonate series, standard deviations are smaller (Tucker, 1988).  

# Mineral identification and semiquantification  

The Philips software X’Pert HighScore was used for minera l identification and semiquantitative evaluation of mineral abundance. Semiquantification was determined on the basis of relativ e intensity ratio values. These values were calculated as the ratio o f the intensity of the most intense reflex of a specific mineral phase t o the intensity of the most intense reflex of pure corundum $(I/I_{\mathrm{c}})$ , referring to the matrix-flushing method of Chung (1974). Total percentages calculated by the software sometimes slightly exceede d $100\%$ . Sum totals less than $100\%$ are likely due to the presence o f amorphous or poorly crystallized material.  

# Geochemistry  

# Onshore bulk rock inorganic chemistry analyses Bulk geochemical analysis of whole rocks  

During the offshore phase, 10 rock samples were collected fo r bulk measurements of solid phase major and trace elements. Additional samples were collected during the onshore phase. Durin g previous OSP operations, powders for bulk rock geochemical analysis were prepared in Bremen using a stainless steel bowl, pressur e mortar, and Pulverisette 7 planetary mill with either agate or stainless steel jars and $1\,\mathrm{cm}$ diameter agate balls. Because this equipmen t had previously been used to powder sediments, which were considered to potentially compromise preparation of the limited sample s from this expedition, it was decided to deviate from standard IOD P procedure for the preparation and analysis of these samples. Th e samples were instead sent to the Pacific Centre for Isotopic an d Geochemical Research (PCIGR) at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) for crushing and powdering with equipment more suitable for analysis of the rock samples collected durin g Expedition 357: a hydraulic rock crusher (Rocklabs hydrauli c crusher) and planetary mill grinder with agate containers (Fritsc h planetary mono mill [Pulverisette 6]). Three levels of jars are available at PCIGR—high, medium, and low—and the latter is reserve d for processing mafic-ultramafic rock samples. This approach minimized the potential risk of contamination of samples during the various  stages  of  preparation,  chemical  separation,  and  analysis. Minimizing contamination is critical because it directly impacts th e confidence with which interpretations of the data can be made.  

Geological sample crushing requires two important steps: (1) reducing the original sample to maximum fragment sizes les s than $5\;\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter and (2) grinding these fragments to form  a homogeneous, fine-grained powder smaller than 200 mesh that ca n be chemically prepared in the laboratory. Crushing a rock to a fin e powder always introduces contaminants of some kind, so the goal i s to limit the extent of contamination. The first step in grain-size reduction is commonly carried out using a metallic jaw-crusher,  a hardened steel mortar and pestle, or by simply wrapping a sample i n a plastic sheet and using a hammer. Jaw-crushers physically grin d material against steel plates and introduce unacceptably high level s of metal contaminants. The other two percussion-style methods ar e laborious and awkward, with loss and contamination of sample material a genuine concern, and are generally ineffective when crushing  blocks  of  solid  material.  In  contrast,  hydraulic  crusher s represent a very efficient method for percussion coarse-crushing o f geologic materials with limited contamination under controlle d conditions. Samples are repeatedly crushed between a lower stationary plate and a piston-driven upper plate that only moves in th e vertical direction (no horizontal movements to induce grinding occur).  

The physical action of grinding in the second crushing step results in unavoidable contamination from the container. Grindin g rock fragments $_{(10-100\ \mathrm{g})}$ involves either eccentric rotation of  a container with rock fragments and a puck and/or ring (e.g., shatterbox or ring mill) or rotation of a grinding bowl containing the fragments and grinding balls about its axis while also orbiting around  a central axis (e.g., planetary mill), which causes the balls to collid e with the walls and comminute the fragments. Tungsten carbid e (WC) containers are commonly used; however, it is established tha t they introduce not only W and C, but also significant amount s (parts per million to parts per billion) of Cr, Co, Nb, Ta, Re, and th e platinum group elements (Hickson and Juras, 1986; Frey et al., 1991). Niobium is a particularly useful tracer element, and ratio s such as Nb/Zr, Nb/U, Nb/La, and Nb/Ta have been successfull y used to constrain a variety of processes, including the geochemical structure of the mantle and the role of continental crust contamination  in  basaltic  magma  (e.g.,  Arndt  and  Christensen,  1992; Hofmann, 1997). Use of a WC container also prevents the future application of platinum group element geochemistry and Re-Os isotopic geochemistry for samples ground by this method. To alleviat e this major problem, containers made of agate $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$ are used, whic h introduces only Si at the parts per million level. This is an insignificant amount in silicate-based geologic materials where $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ contents may range from ${\approx}35\$ to $80\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ .  

Chemical digestion and separation were carried out in class 10 0 fume hoods located in a class 1000 clean laboratory, with concentration analyses carried out in class 10000 laboratories at th e PCIGR. Acids used for digestion were subboiling distilled in Teflo n bottles. $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and HF were also subboiling distilled in Teflon bottles, whereas HCl was quartz distilled. Acid blanks were below 1 0 ppt in subboiled and quartz distilled acids for all elements, excep t Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Sb, Ba, and $Z\mathbf{r},$ whose values range from 35 ppt t o 1.2 ppb. All acid dilutions were made with ultrapure Milli-Q wate r $(18.2\ \mathrm{M}\Omega\mathrm{cm})$ . Savillex Teflon beakers were acid-cleaned betwee n uses, following four steps: (1) batch cleaning in Extran or Citranox, (2) batch cleaning in $50\%$ HCl solution (trace metal grade), (3) batc h cleaning in $50\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution (trace metal grade), and (4) fluxin g in $50\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3^{-}}10\%\mathrm{~I~}$ HF solution. These cleaning steps were $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ eac h on a hot plate at $120^{\circ}C$ .  

Major elements were measured using an inductively couple d plasma–optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Varian 725-ES ) at PCIGR. Preparation of each sample and standard is similar to th e shipboard method of IODP Expedition 304/305, and the entire procedure took place inside a Pt crucible containing ${\approx}5\%$ Au to mak e the container nonwetting. About $100\;\mathrm{mg}$ of whole rock powder wa s mixed thoroughly with $_{\mathrm{~1~g~}}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2},$ and two drops of $25\%$ LiB r solution were added to the mixture before it was dried down on  a hotplate. At this time, the ${\mathrm{Pt}}$ crucible was inserted with $\mathrm{Pt}.$ -tippe d tongs into a Katanax K-prime automatic fluxer where a Pt lid wa s already inserted. The sample was fused at ${\approx}1000^{\circ}{\mathrm{C}}$ in the fluxer fo r ${\approx}5~\mathrm{min}$ . Once fused, the resulting glass was quenched in a $40~\mathrm{{mL}}$ bath of $10\%\mathrm{\HCl/10\%\HNO_{3}}$ , which was placed on a stir plate until all of the glass pieces were dissolved. As this solution was transferred into a $60~\mathrm{mL}$ sample bottle, it was rinsed from its containe r and diluted further with $0\%\mathrm{\HCl/10\%}$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to $50~\mathrm{mL}$ . Sample s were run within $48\,\mathrm{h}$ of their preparation. Loss on ignition was determined by combustion at $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ on ${\approx}1~\mathrm{g}$ of sample in the commercial laboratory ALS Canada Ltd.  

Eight reference materials were used to construct calibratio n curves during major element analysis (AGV-2, JB-1a, JGb1, JR-1, MRG-1, SY-4, GXR-3, and 88a), and two procedural blanks were analyzed as well. All reference materials and blanks were processe d identically and alongside the samples to ensure a matched matrix. Additional reference materials BIR-1a, BHVO-2, and JA-2 were als o analyzed and compared to published values (Flanagan, 1984; Wilson, 1997; Imai et al., 1995). Each analysis included Si, Fe, Mg, Mn, Al, Ca, Na, Ti, K, and P, and a 10 ppm Eu internal standard was use d to monitor and correct for instrumental drift. Analyses of the reference materials and wavelengths that were analyzed are reported i n X357_Geochem.xlsx in GEOCHEM in Supplementary material.  

Trace element contents were determined using a high-resolution inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometer (H-ICP-MS ) (Thermo Finnigan Element 2) at PCIGR (Carpentier et al., 2013; Schudel et al., 2015). About $100~\mathrm{mg}$ of powder was dissolved in  a $\mathrm{HF-HNO}_{3}$ mixture in Savillex vials for 2 days at $130^{\circ}C$ . Sample s were then dried on a hot plate and taken up in 6M HCl on the ho t plate at $120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ overnight. The digested samples were dried again o n a hot plate and finally diluted ${\approx}5000$ times in a mixture of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ $1\%{-}\mathrm{HF}\ 0.05\%,$ containing indium (concentration of $10~\mathrm{ppm}]$ ), use d as an internal standard to monitor instrument drift. The Ko’ola u PCIGR reference material was used to perform external calibratio n on the basis of the concentrations reported in Norman and Garci a (1999). Procedural blanks were measured for each set of analysis. Three samples of Ko’olau were fully duplicated, and their concentrations are given in X357_Geochem.xlsx in GEOCHEM in Supplementary material. The relative differences of concentrations in th e duplicate samples are generally lower than $5\%$ . Analytical precisio n for trace element concentrations, evaluated by duplicate analysis, i s typically $<\!5\%$ RSD for the rare earth elements Ba, Zr, Hf, Cs, Nb, Rb, Ga, Cu, Ni, Co, and $\mathrm{V}$ and ${<}10\%$ RSD for Li, Mo, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ta, W, Bi, Th, Sr, Pb, U, Sc, and Y.  

# Total carbon, total inorganic carbon, and total organic carbon analyses  

TC, TIC, and total organic carbon (TOC) samples were collected in two ways. One suite of 10 samples was collected from billets that were cut with a water-cooled circular saw at sea. Althoug h these samples were used for shipboard analysis of TC, TIC, an d TOC, they were not collected in a manner designed to prevent th e input of extraneous carbon. Shipboard samples for TC, TIC, an d TOC were subsampled offshore from rock cores after they equilibrated to room temperature. WRCs were first cut, and then the exterior was removed by cutting on four sides. The interior portio n was used for thin section billets, and an aliquot of the exterior portion was devoted to TC, TIC, and TOC analysis. These were store d in nonsterile plastic bags at room temperature until the OSP in Bremen. Shipboard tap water was used to cool the cutting blade, and i t was not rinsed from the cores prior to putting them in plastic bags. In Bremen, the exterior pieces were crushed manually in the bag, potentially transferring some of the carbon of the bag to the samples. They were then further homogenized in an ethanol-cleane d agate mortar and pestle. Several of the samples were additionall y milled with agate balls. On one sample, markings from a wax pe n were still visible. This was removed with fine-grained sandpape r prior to homogenization. The homogenized samples were stored i n bottles that were not treated to remove organic carbon (e.g., combusting glassware at $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ using acid-washed, Teflon-lined caps). At certain stages, such as during the homogenization of the sampl e processing in Bremen, care was taken to not further contaminat e these samples by wearing gloves and cleaning surfaces that woul d come into contact with the core with solvent. This was not don e throughout the life cycle of these samples, however, and it is feasibl e that they were touched by bare hands at some point.  

TC, TIC, and TOC concentrations were measured on the 1 0 shipboard samples using a LECO CS-300 carbon-sulfur analyzer a t the University of Bremen. First, about $65~\mathrm{mg}$ of the homogenize d sample was weighed in a ceramic cup and heated in a furnace. Evolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ were measured with a nondispersive infrare d detector to measure the sedimentary TC and total sulfur content. Crushed samples ${\approx}65~\mathrm{mg)}$ were also decalcified using $12.5\%$ HCl and measured as above. TIC was calculated by subtracting the decalcified fractions from the TC fraction. All values are reported i n dry weight percent $(\mathrm{wt\%})$ with an analytical precision less than $3\%$ . Because these samples were not collected in a manner to sufficientl y avoid external carbon contamination, reported values should b e viewed with extreme caution and considered maximum concentrations.  

# Postexpedition bulk rock organic chemistry analyses  

# Bulk carbon analysis on science party samples  

A second set of shipboard samples from the WRC microbiolog y samples were collected specifically to minimize potential carbo n contamination so as to preserve the in situ TC signature of the core s (see Microbiology). Microbiology samples were wrapped in acidwashed Teflon sheeting, stored frozen, and shipped to the Koch i Core Center (Japan). There, the outside of the cores was carefull y removed, and the internal material was crushed and homogenize d using solvent-cleaned equipment. A portion of the external material was also sampled for comparison purposes. An aliquot of the homogenized material was freeze-dried in a low-carbon freeze drie r outfitted with a scroll pump to eliminate oil vapor contamination. This material will be analyzed for TC, TIC, and TOC at the Swis s Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich (ETH-Zürich; Switzerland) as postexpedition research following methods outlined b y Schwarzenbach et al. (2013). TC content will be measured on  a coulometer via combustion at $950^{\circ}C$ and detection of the subsequent $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . TIC content will be measured on the same coulomete r by reacting the bulk powder with perchloric acid in glass capsule s and measuring the subsequent $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . The $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{TC}}$ will be measure d on an elemental analyzer–isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EAIRMS). Samples for $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C_{TIC}}$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{TIC}}$ will be analyzed by GasBench/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. To determine the concentrations and isotope signatures of organic carbon in the samples, aliquots will be transferred to high-walled glass vials with Teflonlined caps and decarbonated with $2~\mathrm{M}$ hydrochloric acid (Lang e t al., 2013). Samples will be allowed to sit overnight, and then the liquid will be decanted and more $2\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HCl}$ will be added. This proces s will be repeated until no further bubbling is observed on addition o f the acid. The residue will be rinsed with Milli-Q water, centrifuged, separated from the liquid, and dried at $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . After homogenization, it will be analyzed for TOC concentrations and isotopes by EAIRMS with a thermal conductivity detector inline to allow th e $\%\mathrm{TOC}$ to be simultaneously determined.  

# Lipid biomarkers  

Aliquots of homogenized samples will be solvent-extracted using a combination of methanol, dichloromethane, and phosphat e buffer. The liquid will be concentrated under vacuum and dried under $\Nu_{2}$ . The total lipid extract will be separated into distinct fractions over silica gel. If needed, the fractions will be derivatized t o make the compounds amendable for gas chromatography (GC). The compounds will be identified by GC-mass spectrometry an d quantified by GC-flame ionization detection.  

# Amino acids  

Concentrations of free and hydrolizable amino acids will be determined for aliquots of the homogenized samples following th e protocol of Cowie and Hedges (1992b).  

# Fluid inorganic chemistry analyses  

Offshore ephemeral fluid inorganic chemistry analyses  

Sensor package Niskin bottle samples, CTD Niskin bottle samples, and interstitial fluid samples were analyzed on board for $\mathsf{p H}$ , alkalinity, ammonium, and salinity following standard procedure s used in previous MSP expeditions (see Water sampling and senso r package data). Sample analyses for ${\mathsf{p H}},$ , alkalinity, and salinity wer e performed within $48\,\mathrm{h}$ of sample collection, and analyses for ammonium were performed within $24{-}48\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

$\mathsf{p H}$ was measured on $0.5\,\mathrm{\mL}$ of sample using an ion-specifi c electrode (Mettler Toledo) with a two-point calibration (standard s at $\mathsf{p H4}$ and 7). The same sample was then used to measure alkalinity by single-point titration to ${\mathsf{p H}}\,3.95$ with 0.01 M HCl according t o standard procedures (Grasshoff et al., 1983). Unexpected values i n the offshore ${\mathsf{p H}}$ and alkalinity measurements prompted reassessment, and where possible, reanalysis of these parameters was performed during the onshore phase of the expedition, as describe d below.  

Ammonium was measured by conductivity, after separation a s $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ through a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane in  a flow-through system. In the latter technique, modified after Hal l and Aller (1992), ammonia is stripped from a $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ sample by a n alkaline carrier solution $^{0.2\ M}$ sodium citrate in $10\ \mathrm{mM\NaOH})$ , passed through a $200\ \mathrm{mm}\,\times\,5\ \mathrm{mm}$ PTFE membrane, and redissolved as $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ in an acidic solution $(1\;\mathrm{mM}\;\mathrm{HCl})$ ). Ammonium ion s are then measured as the resulting change in conductivity signal i n the acidic carrier in a microflow-through cell.  

Salinity was determined by optical refraction (Krüss Optroni c digital refractometer DR 6200), calibrated with International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) seawate r standards with salinities of 10, 30, 35, and 38 practical salinity unit s (PSU).  

Subsamples for cations, trace elements, anions, and sulfide wer e stored at $4^{\circ}C$ for further onshore analysis in Bremen through ICPOES (for Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Fe, B, Si, S, P, Al, and Ti), io n chromatography (for chlorinity, bromide, sulfate, nitrate, and fluoride), and spectrophotometry (sulfide).  

# Onshore OSP standard fluid inorganic chemistry analyses  

# Cations and trace metals  

A total of 38 filtered $(0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ and acidified ( $\mathrm{[0~\muL}$ of concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}/\mathrm{mL}$ ) samples from the sensor package Niskins $\left(N=\right.$ 14), CTD rosette Niskins $\left(N=18\right)$ , and interstitial waters $(N=6)$ )  

were analyzed for cations and trace metals using analytical equipment at the University of Bremen. All samples were diluted 10-fol d with $1\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and analyzed for major and minor elements. An aliquot of $2~\mathrm{mL}$ diluted sample was first taken for premeasurement t o establish the rough concentrations in the elements of interest and t o make standard solutions for both cation and anion analyses. All measurements were done on the same day with the same standar d calibration.  

Major elements (Al, B, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, S, Si, Sr, an d Ti) were analyzed using a Varian Vista Pro CCD ICP-OES equippe d with a SeaSpray nebulizer and a cyclone spray chamber. A $4\;\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of the 10-fold diluted sample was injected three times. Mino r elements (Al, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sr, Ti, V, Zn, and Zr) were analyzed using an Agilent 700 Serie s ICP-OES equipped with a K-style conical nebulizer. A second $4\;\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of the 10-fold diluted sample was injected three times for th e minor/trace element analyses. The effect of the seawater matrix wa s assessed by doping the standard solutions with Na, $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ Ca, Mg, and K to mimic the concentrations found in the samples.  

For both major and minor elements, standardization was performed against multielement solutions prepared from commercial standards with a $1\%\ \mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ matrix (as all samples had comparabl e concentrations close to seawater). Five concentration levels bracketing the concentrations of the samples were used for the multielement standard (dilution factors of 1:1, 1:1.25, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:5 ) (see figures in GEOCHEM in Supplementary material). External calibration standards were prepared using IAPSO seawater, whic h was analyzed four times. Estimated measurement precision wa s $\pm2\%$ for major elements and $\pm5\%$ for trace elements (very dependent on the element and matrix). Three samples were prepared i n duplicate (one CTD Rosette Niskin sample, one interstitial flui d sample, and one sensor package Niskin sample) and analyzed a s separate samples to determine reproducibility; all duplicates wer e equal within uncertainty.  

For trace element analyses, few elements were above the detection limit: Li, Al, Ba, Fe, and Mn (not all samples were above detection for Mn). All the other elements analyzed (As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Ti, V, and Zr) were below detection limits (se e figures in GEOCHEM in Supplementary material). On the basis o f the standard solutions analyzed, the sample concentrations are ${<}2$ ppb. Zinc has concentrations above the detection limit but appear s to reflect contamination due to uncharacteristically high values. Results are consistent between holes for all sites. For elements analyzed on both ICP-OES instruments, reported values are from th e Varian Vista Pro (major element analyses), with the exception of Al.  

# Anions  

A total of 38 filtered and unacidified samples (sensor packag e Niskins $[N=14]$ , CTD rosette Niskins $[N=18]$ , and interstitial waters $[N=6]$ ) were analyzed for anions (chloride, bromide, sulfate, nitrate, and fluoride) using a Metrohm 882 Compact ion chromatograph with an 858 Professional sample processor at the Universit y of Bremen. Anions were separated over a Metrosep A Supp 5 column $150\ \mathrm{mm}\,\times\,4.0\ \mathrm{mm}_{\cdot}$ , $5~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ particle size) and two guard columns, a Metrosep A Supp $4/5$ $\mathrm{4.0\;mm})$ and a Metrosep RP2 Guar d 3.6 column. The mobile phase was held constant at $0.7\;\mathrm{mL/min}$ an d contained $3.2\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$ sodium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{NaCO}_{3}\right)$ and $1.0\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$ sodium bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\right)$ . A 40-fold dilution of IAPSO seawater and a dilution curve of a mixed standard solution were use d for calibration. Measurement precision on the basis of the concentrated standard was $\pm0.1\%$ for $\mathrm{Cl}$ , $\pm5\%$ for Br, $\pm1.1\%$ for $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ $\pm0.2\%$ for $\mathrm{NO}_{3},$ and $\pm2.0\%$ for F based on two standard deviations of th e measurement (see figures in GEOCHEM in Supplementary material). For the IAPSO seawater reference solution, precisions wer e $\pm3.9\%$ for Cl, $\pm2.2\%$ for Br, and $\pm4.3\%$ for $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ whereas both $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ and F were below the limit of detection.  

# Sulfide  

Total sulfide was measured for 41 samples following th e spectrophotometry method of Cline (1969). In short, dimethyl-pphenylene-diamine forms an intermediate complex with hydroge n sulfide that transforms to leucomethylene blue, which is oxidized t o methylene blue by ferric iron. Sulfide is volatile, so samples an d standards were preserved as quickly as possible after collection a t sea (see Water sampling and sensor package data). A concentrated solution of zinc acetate was added, causing sulfide to precipitate  as  zinc  sulfide.  N,N-dimethyl-1,4-phenylenediaminedihydrochloride and $\mathrm{FeCl_{3}{\cdot}6H_{2}O}$ were used as color reagent and oxidizing agent, respectively. Samples were analyzed using a DR 500 0 spectrophotometer at University of Bremen. The extinction wa s measured on wavelength 670 after $30\,\mathrm{\min}$ reaction time. For al l samples, concentrations were below the detection limit, so results o f this analysis are not presented in the site chapters.  

# Stable carbon isotope composition of dissolved inorganic carbon  

Fluids were preserved offshore for stable carbon isotope analysi s of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (see Water sampling and sensor package data). The carbon isotope composition of $C O_{2}$ in th e headspace of the sample vials was measured at the Stable Isotop e Laboratory of the Geological Institute, ETH Zürich, using a Therm o Fisher Scientific GasBench II coupled to a Delta V mass spectrometer. The instrument was calibrated with the international referenc e materials NBS 19 $\left\langle\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}=+1.95\%\right\rangle$ ) and NBS 18 $\left\langle\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}=-5.05\%_{0}\right\rangle$ an d solutions of an internal laboratory sodium bicarbonate standar d prepared in concentrations bracketing those observed in the samples. Isotope values are reported in conventional delta notation wit h respect to Vienna Peedee belemnite (VPDB).  

# Onshore pH and alkalinity  

Residues of water samples from sensor package Niskins $\left(N=\right.$ 14), CTD rosette Niskins $(N=18)$ , and interstitial waters $\left(N=6\right)$ were analyzed for alkalinity at the University of Bremen using th e same $\mathsf{p H}$ meter and autotitrator used at sea. The accuracy of th e meter was tested against standards of known alkalinities, includin g $\mathrm{Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}{\cdot}H_{2}O}$ ( $10\,\mathrm{mM}$ for an alkalinity of $20\,\mathrm{mM})$ ), $\mathrm{NaHCO_{3}}$ (25 an d $50\ \mathrm{mM}$ for alkalinities of 25 and $50\;\mathrm{mM}$ , respectively), and IAPS O seawater $({\approx}2.325\ \mathrm{mM})$ ) according to the procedure of Gieskes et al. (1991). All standards were dissolved in a ${\approx}0.7\,\mathrm{~M~}$ solution of KC l which serves as an ionic-strength preserver. Initial alkalinity readings were higher than expected, possibly due to insufficient mixin g of the sample with titration acid. After correcting this issue, multiple replicates of freshly opened IAPSO seawater were analyzed wit h each group of samples and used to adjust the expected and real aci d concentration (Rounds, 2012). The standards of $\mathrm{Na_{2}B_{4}O_{7}{\cdot}H_{2}O}$ an d $\mathrm{NaHCO_{3}}$ were also analyzed with each group and were consistentl y within $5\%$ of expected values. The final, corrected value of IAPS O seawater was $2.33\pm0.02\:\mathrm{mM}$ alkalinity. Replicates of eight separat e CTD and sensor package samples had reproducibility of $\pm\ 0.08\ \mathrm{mM}$ alkalinity.  

# Microbiology  

The primary microbiology objective for Expedition 357 was t o explore the extent and activity of the subsurface biosphere in youn g ultramafic and mafic seafloor, focusing on the potential for a hydrogen-based deep biosphere in an area undergoing active serpentinization (Früh-Green et al., 2015). Drilling, sampling, and analysi s were designed to test the following of the expedition’s hypotheses:  

• An extensive subsurface hydrogen-based biosphere persists in the serpentinizing lithosphere. These communities evolve and adapt to variations in diffuse flow, fluid chemistry, heat flow distribution, and aging of the seafloor.   
• Serpentinizing environments sustain higher biomass than gabbroic-dominated domains.   
• The transition from sulfide- to carbonate-dominated environments can be detected by changes in the associated microbial communities.   
• Zones of intense carbonate veining underlie sites of diffuse venting and represent seawater recharge and net sequestration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the hydrosphere to the lithosphere. These zones are biological hotspots where microbial communities are supported by the high fluxes of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ mixing with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .  

This section focuses on shipboard methods used for sample collection and handling for microbiological analyses from core samples. Additional seawater samples for microbiological analysis ar e described in Water sampling and sensor package data. Samples o f core collected for microbiology were subsampled for environmental nucleic acid extraction and analysis, cell detection and enumeration, contamination tests, lipid biomarker analysis, and several enrichment and culturing experiments. Some preparations wer e conducted shipboard, but science party members will conduct th e majority of the analyses in shore-based laboratories. Because thi s was the first IODP expedition to use seabed drills, several established methodologies for microbiological sampling (e.g., those use d during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 327, 329, and 336 [Expedition 327 Scientists, 2011; Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011; Expedition 336 Scientists, 2012]) were adapted to the constraints and opportunities that this drilling approach required.  

# Analysis of potential contamination with PFC tracer  

The use of tracers in drilling fluids to monitor for potential contamination of samples for microbiological analysis is critical and ha s become routine during microbiology-focused expeditions (Inagak i et al., 2015; Lever et al., 2006, 2013; Smith et al., 2000). PFC has bee n identified as an ideal tracer because of the large range of concentrations that are detectable (i.e., across six orders of magnitude ) through volatile detection with a GC equipped with an electro n capture detector (GC-ECD) (Lever et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2000). Therefore, we sought to use PFC tracer during drilling with the seabed drills.  

During traditional drilling, drilling fluids (muds) are prepare d on the platform and injected into the drill pipe, and the concentration of PFC tracer delivered into the flush water can be closely monitored and adjusted to reach saturating conditions (roughly $1\ \mathrm{mg/L})$ . In contrast, seabed drills use bottom seawater directly as flushin g water. Therefore, we developed an in situ method for deliverin g concentrated PFC tracer directly into the line of the flushing wate r on the rock drill. In brief, the system was designed to deliver roughl y $50~{\upmu\mathrm{L}}/{\mathrm{min}}$ of pure PFC solution (Sigma Aldrich) directly into th e stream of flushing water to achieve a saturating concentration o f roughly $1\:\mathrm{mg/L}$ for a flushing rate of $50\,\mathrm{L/min}$ . This system consist s of a small precision variable–controlled pump (Mikro systemz F-PV Modul), an ON/OFF 2/2 shift valve, an electronic controller, an d a replaceable bag of tracer fluid (Figure F17). The electronics wer e housed in a custom-made pressure-compensated housing of galvanized steel. The system was mounted onto each drill and controlle d from the surface via an independent RS232 serial communicatio n link to the subsea tracer controller. The pump flow rate was adjustable in the range 0.015 to $5\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ to match the flush flow rate fo r each drill, and the pump flow rate was initially calculated based o n the flush rate and the required concentration of tracer. The flus h rate on the rock drills varied throughout operations but tended t o range from 20 to $50\,\mathrm{L/min}$ .

Throughout the expedition, pumping rate and performance varied, affecting the volume of PFC tracer that was actually delivere d during operations at each hole. Tests for PFC concentrations o n samples obtained from the first holes, as described in Microbiology in the Eastern sites chapter (Expedition 357 Scientists, 2017), revealed that the concentrations achieved were well below those expected and required. Increasing pump rates to achieve the desire d tracer concentration were unsuccessful. Dismantling one of th e pumps identified that the internal rubber paddle, responsible fo r opening and closing the valve supplying the PFC tracer, was swolle n to almost twice the size it should have been, thus blocking supply. Laboratory tests were undertaken and it was ascertained that th e swelling of the rubber paddle was not an adverse reaction to th e tracer fluid. The paddle was shaved to reduce its size, and the pum p system was put back together. Concentrations in fluid samples acquired after this modification were much improved, and pumpin g rates for tracer injection were consequently reduced. Pumping rate s for each hole are shown in Table T4.  

Because of this variability in tracer pump delivery, it was no t possible to convert PFC concentrations observed in the sample s into the volume of flushing water potentially contaminating th e core, as is commonly done (Lever et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2000; Inagaki et al., 2015). Therefore, for this expedition, concentrations ar e reported simply as the amount of PFC tracer per volume of sample.  

To monitor PFC delivery, a variety of samples were collecte d from the rock drills after drilling: liner fluid samples, sensor packag e Niskin bottle samples, and exterior and interior core samples. Th e sample type referred to as “liner fluid” represents a mixture of bottom water that was in the core barrel prior to being replaced b y core, as well as flushing water collected during coring. Liner fluid s were collected by either draining from the ball valve at the top of th e core prior to opening the core barrel to recover the core inside or b y draining at the lower end of the core before retracting the core line r from the core barrel. In either case, fluids were collected in a steril e $50\,\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube, and then $10\,\mathrm{mL}$ of this fluid was immediatel y transferred to a $22~\mathrm{mL}$ glass headspace vial and crimp sealed. Fo r sensor package samples, $10~\mathrm{mL}$ fluid samples were collected fro m each of the three rock drill–mounted Niskin bottles, which sample d the fluids flushed out of the borehole near the breakout table an d bottom seawater. For core samples, when cores were transferred t o the shipboard laboratory to select WRCs for ephemeral microbiological analyses, $1{-}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of core in the form of small fragments wa s transferred to $22~\mathrm{mL}$ glass headspace vials containing $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of distilled water and crimp sealed. These represented the exterior of th e core. After flame-sterilization of WRC pieces (see Pooled froze n rock samples), interior samples for PFC analysis were collected in  a similar manner using a flame-sterilized hammer and chisel to generate fragments from the interior of the flamed WRC piece. Car e was taken to conduct the flame-sterilization step, which would volatilize the PFC tracer into the laboratory atmosphere, in a separat e laboratory from where the samples were prepared to minimize th e risk of false positives.

After collection, the exterior of crimped headspace vials wer e rinsed with copious amounts of water, dried, and then heated in  a $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ oven for several hours prior to analysis. At the same time, a se t of PFC standards was prepared under a fume hood in the same typ e of vials and also heated in the oven, following established tracer dilution protocols (Smith et al., 2000). It is important to note that th e fume hood vented into the laboratory after passing through a filte r (i.e., it did not vent to the exterior of the ship), and both the ove n and the GC-ECD used for analysis also vented into the room; thi s led to a buildup of PFC tracer in the atmosphere of the analysis laboratory over time. Care was taken to conduct thorough analysis o f the atmospheric concentration of PFC tracer in all laboratorie s during analyses, both from air samples collected directly into syringes during GC-ECD analysis and from headspace vials closed i n the laboratories during sample collection, to account for the possibility of false positives.  

PFC tracer analysis followed established protocols (Lever et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2000). Using a heated disposable plastic $3\;\mathrm{mL}$ syringe fitted with a two-way stopcock and $51~\mathrm{mm}$ , 22 gauge Hamilton needle, a $2\ \mathrm{{mL}}$ headspace sample from either sample o r standard vials was injected into the splitless injector on the Agilen t 7890A GC system GC-ECD. The GC-ECD was equipped with a 3 0 m length $\times\,53\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ inner diameter $\times\,15\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ coating thickness Agilen t HP-AL/M column run with ultrahigh-purity nitrogen carrier gas a t 4.7 psi $(57\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min})$ with an initial column temperature of $120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ fo r $0.5\;\mathrm{min}$ , followed by a $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ ramp to $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $2.2\;\mathrm{min}$ . The injector temperature was set at $175^{\circ}C$ . Under these parameters, th e PFC peak eluted at roughly $3.4\,\mathrm{\min}$ as monitored with Agilen t ChemStation Rev B.03.03 software. The concentrations of PF C tracer in samples were determined by comparing the peak area to  a standard curve of peak area versus PFC tracer injected from th e standards. Based on duplicate analysis of standards, the limit of detection was $2\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{g}\,(2\,\mathrm{pg})$ PFC, which is in the range of what wa s determined previously (Smith et al., 2000; Lever et al., 2006).  

# Pooled frozen rock samples  

As described in Core handling during the Expedition 357 offshore phase, the general strategy for selection of WRC for microbiological investigation was to select a representative section fro m one end of every other core section, starting with core sections fro m the base of the borehole. From each WRC, a $2{-}20~\mathrm{cm}$ section wa s set aside for pooled analyses to be completed on shore. The piec e was typically divided into two portions labeled “flamed” and “unflamed.” For the flamed sample, the exterior of the piece was flamesterilized using a handheld butane torch inside a flame-sterilize d steel box. Both pieces were then separately wrapped in acid-cleane d and autoclaved $0.4~\mathrm{mm}$ thick Teflon sheeting, transferred to steril e Whirl-Pak bags, and frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Teflon sheeting was used t o minimize transfer of organic carbon from the Whirl-Pak bags ont o the samples. On shore, the frozen pieces were subsampled and homogenized while still frozen under clean air conditions at the Koch i  

Core Center. Splits of the homogenate were distributed for numerous shore-based analyses, including nucleic acid extraction, lipi d biomarker analysis, carbon isotope analyses, and bulk rock XRD.  

Nucleic acid extraction from homogenized core material will b e conducted on shore at the University of Utah (USA) following a protocol developed for low-biomass rocks adapted from strategies use d on hydrothermal sulfides, carbonate chimneys, serpentinites, an d basalts (Schrenk et al., 2003; Brazelton et al., 2010; Lever et al., 2015; Twing, 2015; Barton et al., 2006).  

# Cell detection and enumeration  

Cell detection and enumeration from sediment and rock samples were determined shipboard through epifluorescence microscopy  following  modification  of previously published  method s (Morono et al., 2009, 2013). To evaluate the risk of potential background contamination during drilling, various seawater and flui d samples were collected and enumerated, including bottom seawate r collected from casts of the ship’s CTD Niskin rosette; Niskin bottle s on the rock drills; and liner fluids from the core barrels.  

Rock samples for cell enumeration were taken from both the exterior and interior of the WRC pieces, with the interior pieces collected using flame-sterilized tongs after flaming the exterior of th e WRC with a butane torch until dry. Roughly $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ pieces of roc k were transferred to combusted aluminum foil and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until processing. Pieces were broken and crushed into millimetersized grains using a sterilized metal mortar and pestle within th e confines of a KOACH laminar flow unit (Table KOACH, Koken, Ltd.). The metal mortar and pestle were cleaned by rinsing with distilled water, spraying with RNase AWAY, letting soak for a few minutes, and finally flaming. A total of $4~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of crushed material wa s mixed with $9~\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\times$ phosphate buffered saline $\mathrm{\Delta_{PH}}=7.4;$ ; Ambion AM9624) and $1.5\%\;[\mathrm{w/v}]\;\mathrm{NaCl},$ along with $2\%$ [v/v] neutralize d formaldehyde as a fixative (hereafter referred to as fixing solution).  

For sediment samples, a $1.5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample was taken by a steril e cut-end syringe and pooled directly into the fixing solution. Fo r fluid samples, $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of sample was mixed with equal volume of fixing solution and vortexed thoroughly to form a homogeneous suspension. The resulting suspension was filtered onto a $25\,\textrm{m m}$ diameter  black $0.22–\upmu\mathrm{m}$ -mesh  polycarbonate  membrane  filte r (GTBP02500; Millipore) using vacuum filtration without furthe r processing. Unfixed samples were frozen with the Cells Alive System (CAS) freezer (LAB-1; ABI Co. Ltd.) for analysis at the onshor e laboratory.  

The fixed rock or sediment slurries were then subjected to th e cell detachment and separation steps (Morono et al., 2009), including procedural negative controls, as follows:  

1. Transfer $0.5{-}2\;\mathrm{mL}$ of the fixed sample to a $15\;\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube.   
2. Add $2.5\%$ NaCl solution (filter sterilized) for $2.2\;\mathrm{mL}$ total volume (for the negative control, $2.2\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $\mathtt{N a C l}$ was used).   
3. Add $400\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of detergent mix ( $100\;\mathrm{mM}$ EDTA, $100\;\mathrm{mM}$ sodium pyrophosphate, and $1\%\ [\mathrm{v/v}]$ Tween 80) and $400\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of methanol to each tube (mix thoroughly after the addition of each solution).   
4. Vortex tubes at maximum speed for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ (Vortex Genie 2, Scientific Industries).   
5. Sonicate tubes in a sonicating bath at 120/240 W for $10\;\mathrm{{min}}$ (RK105, BANDELIN electronic).   
6. Allow large particles to settle briefly, and then load sample suspension on top of prepared step-wise density gradient consisting of $1.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ each of (from top) $30\%$ , $50\%$ , and $80\%$ Nycodenz (1002424, WAK-Chemie Medical GmbH) and $67\%$ sodium polytungstate (SPT0, SOMETU-Europe) solutions.   
7. Centrifuge at $7140\times g$ for $60\;\mathrm{min}$ at $12^{\circ}C$ (5430R, Eppendorf).   
8. Recover supernatant from surface of density gradient using sterile syringe and 26G needle and transfer to $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ Granier tube.   
9. Add 5 mL $2.5\%$ NaCl solution to remaining heavy density solution and mix thoroughly.   
10. Centrifuge density solution again at $7140\times g$ for $20\;\mathrm{min}$ at $12^{\circ}C$ .   
11. Recover supernatant and add to the resulting solution in Step 8.   
12. Extract the remaining large particles by adding $2.0\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $2.5\%$ $\mathrm{NaCl}$ and extract as in Steps 2–10, and then add to resulting solution in Step 8.   
13. Filter the combined supernatant onto a $25\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter black $0.22\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh polycarbonate membrane filter (GTBP02500, Millipore) using vacuum filtration.   
14. Stain cells on filter with SYBR Green I staining solution (1:40 dilution of SYBR Green I in TrisEDTA buffer).   
15. Mount stained filter with Vectashield on glass slide and count cells as described in Morono et al. (2009).  

All sample handling steps were performed in a KOACH ope n clean system with care to avoid potential contaminants (e.g., dust).  

# Single-cell sorting  

For shore-based single-cell sorting from rock samples for nucleic acid extraction, roughly $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples from the interior o f flamed WRC pieces were transferred to a cold solution of $1\times\mathrm{glyc}-$ erol-TrisEDTA buffer (1:10 dilution of $_{10\times}$ buffer $[20\,\mathrm{mL}$ $100\times$ TrisEDTA buffer $\mathrm{pH}\,8.0,60\,\mathrm{mL}\,18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ distilled water, and $100\;\mathrm{mL}$ glycerol] in $0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ filtered and autoclaved bottom seawater), mixe d thoroughly, and frozen. In a shore-based laboratory, microbial cell s will be liberated from rock surfaces, concentrated, and sorted usin g flow cytometry following methods established previously (Stepanauskas and Sieracki, 2007).  

# Enrichment and incubation experiments  

To fulfill the expedition objectives to understand microbial activity within Atlantis Massif, several different shipboard enrichmen t experiments were established with WRC material soon after cor e collection to capture the ephemeral properties of live cells withi n the samples. In some cases, WRC samples were preserved intac t within gas-tight storage bags under anaerobic headspace $\left(\mathbf{N}_{2}\right)$ an d stored cold $(4^{\circ}C)$ for establishing enrichment experiments in shorebased laboratories under cleaner air conditions than could be established on the ship. In other cases, experiments were set up directl y on the ship within nitrogen-sparged glove bags. The following sections describe the variety of incubations experiments that were established by the expedition science party.  

# Single-cell analysis of carbon and nitrogen assimilation rates of subseafloor microbial communities  

To determine substrate uptake rates of individual microbial cell s incubated with stable isotope–labeled substrates using nannoscal e secondary ion mass spectrometry in the onshore laboratory, WR C samples were wrapped with sterile Whirl-Pak bags and sealed i n gas-impermeable bags together with an oxygen scrubber (AnaeroGen, Thermo Scientific) after flushing with $0.22~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh filtere d ultrahigh-purity nitrogen gas. Samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ in thi s way until the experiment in the onshore laboratory. There, sample s were homogenized under clean air conditions and distributed fo r incubation with different stable carbon and nitrogen isotope–labeled substrates following established protocols (Morono et al., 2011).  

# Potential rate measurements of respiration and methanogenesis in sulfate-reducing microcosm experiments  

WRC samples for potential rate measurements were initiall y wrapped in a sheet of autoclaved Teflon film and stored in $\Nu_{2}$ atmosphere in a gas-impermeable bag at $4^{\circ}C$ until further shipboard processing. Prior to crushing, WRC samples were gently washed twic e with autoclaved $3\%$ [w/v] NaCl solution in a sterile Whirl-Pak bag; the exterior was then flamed to dryness with a butane torch to minimize potential contamination. Inside a $\Nu_{2}$ filled glove bag, core s were broken into $2{-}3\,\mathrm{cm}$ sized pieces using a flame-sterilized chisel on a flame-sterilized steel plate; those pieces were then crushed int o $5{-}10\ \mathrm{mm}$ pieces in an autoclaved steel impact mortar and finall y ground into $1{-}3\,\mathrm{mm}$ pieces in an autoclaved metal mortar with pestle. After homogenization, $10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of material was placed into 16 0 mL combusted glass serum vials and capped with chlorobutyl rubber septa. Serum bottles were removed from the glove bag and subsequently flushed with a stream of $\Nu_{2}$ for $20\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ .  

Experiments for each treatment were run in triplicate, alongsid e a “killed” control, produced by autoclaving a serum bottle containing rock powder for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ at $125^{\circ}C$ and 20 psi. Subsequently, 4 8 mL of sterile (autoclaved), anoxic $[\mathrm{N}_{2}$ sparged) artificial seawate r medium containing the following components was added to eac h bottle:  

• $21.0\,\mathrm{g/L\,NaCl},$ ,   
• $3.1\;\mathrm{g/L\;MgCl_{2}{\cdot}6H_{2}O},$   
• 3.0 g/L $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{4},$   
• $1.0\,\mathrm{g/L}$ CHES buffer,   
• $0.5\,\mathrm{g/L}$ KCl,   
• $0.3\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{L}\,\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{Cl},$   
• 0.2 g/L $\mathrm{KH}_{2}\mathrm{PO}_{4},$   
• $0.15\;\mathrm{g/L\subset\mathrm{aCl_{2}{\cdot}2H_{2}O},}$   
• $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ Resazurin solution $(0.02\%\;[\mathrm{w/v}])$ ,   
• $5\ \mathrm{mL/L}$ ATCC trace elements solution, and   
• $10\,\mathrm{mL/L}$ ATCC vitamin solution, $\mathsf{p H}$ adjusted to 9.0 with $10\,\mathrm{M}$ $\mathrm{{NaOH}_{\mathrm{{}}}}$ , reduced with cysteine-HCl.  

Additionally, $1\,\mathrm{\mL}$ of $1\%$ stable carbon isotope labeled substrates (i.e., sodium acetate, sodium formate, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium lactate) at a concentration of $1\ M$ were added to vials, resulting in a final concentration of $20\;\mathrm{mM}$ for each carbon-bearin g substrate. For methane stable isotope enrichment, a $1\%$ labele d methane mixture was prepared by mixing the gas in the vial headspace. Samples were equilibrated to $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ before initial tim e point samples for cell counts ( $1.8\;\mathrm{mL}$ culture $+\ 0.2\ \mathrm{mL}\,37\%$ formaldehyde), hydrogen sulfide $\mathrm{[0.2\,mL}$ culture $+\;1.0\;\mathrm{mL\;1\%}$ zinc acetat e solution), and TIC $\mathrm{[0.5\,mL}$ culture into evacuated Exetainer with 6 0 $\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $85\%$ phosphoric acid) were taken.  

Finally, $20~\mathrm{mL}$ of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ was added to each bottle using a gas-tigh t syringe, and $10~\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\%-^{13}\!C$ labeled $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ in a 50:50 mixture wit h $\Nu_{2}$ was added to the methane experiments. Bottles were incubate d at $25\mathrm{{^C}C}$ for up to 1 month before collecting an additional time point. In addition to the sample types mentioned above, headspace ga s from each bottle will be collected at time points to measure the stable isotopic ratio. Samples were shipped to the onshore laborator y at room temperature $(20^{\circ}{-}25^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Samples for nucleic acid analysi s will be obtained by sacrificing one of the replicate incubations an d collecting the fluids and solids from the experiments. Nucleic acid s will be extracted following the procedures described above and i n Water sampling and sensor package data.  

# Enzyme activity assays  

To determine extracellular enzyme activity in rock samples, a s previously done for basalts (Jacobsen Meyers et al., 2014), WR C samples were homogenized and incubated in nitrogen-sparged, p H 9.0, autoclaved artificial seawater media (as described above) wit h 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUF-P). When MUF-P is acte d upon by alkaline phosphatase, a fluorescent product is produced, and the level of fluorescence in the incubation is measured in a tim e series to indicate the amount of substrate cleaved over time. Incubations were set up with a range between 5 and $35~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ MUF-P concentrations to enable Michaelis-Menton kinetics (i.e., $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{max}})$ for the enzyme to be determined. To determine actively growin g cells in the same experiments and to aid in single-cell genomic s analysis from these experiments, an amino acid ortholog, L-homoproparygylglycine (HPG) was added to the same enzyme assay experiments at a concentration of $130\;\upmu\mathrm{M}.$ . Cells actively synthesizin g proteins will incorporate the amino acid ortholog into biomass, which can then be identified by microscopy or flow cytometry following fluorescent labeling of the amino acids using “click chemistry” (Hatzenpichler and Orphan, 2015).  

For these experiments, the exteriors of intact WRC pieces wer e flame-sterilized with a butane torch, with the exception of rubbl y WRC pieces that were not amenable to flame sterilization. In thos e instances, WRC pieces were transferred to a sterile Whirl-Pak ba g and serially rinsed at least 10 times with $50{-}100~\mathrm{mL}$ of filter-sterilized and nitrogen-sparged bottom seawater or media solution (a s defined above), to remove potential exterior contamination. Next, WRC pieces were transferred to a nitrogen-sparged glove bag in  a $10^{\circ}C$ cold room and broken into smaller pieces using a flame-sterilized sledge hammer inside a flame-sterilized steel box and then homogenized  to  millimeter-  to  centimeter-sized  pieces  in  a n autoclaved metal mortar and pestle. Using an autoclaved meta l scoop, roughly $20\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ aliquots of homogenized sample were transferred to precombusted $60\;\mathrm{mL}$ glass serum vials and mixed with 2 7 mL of media. Substrates were added from filter-sterilized anoxi c stock solutions, and vials were capped with a nitrogen headspace. At least triplicates were set up for each treatment condition, plus a t least two autoclaved killed controls. Vials were incubated withou t agitation in the dark at $10^{\circ}{-}12^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . At each time point, vials wer e opened inside a nitrogen-sparged glove bag in the cold room an d $1.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of solution was withdrawn from each vial, transferred to a  2 mL centrifuge tube, and frozen until shore-based analysis of enzym e activity. At the end of the experiment, the remaining fluid and rock s were frozen for shore-based single-cell enumeration and nuclei c acid analysis.  

# Piezophilic and alkaliphilic anaerobic cultivations  

After flaming the exterior of the WRC rock piece over a Bunse n burner to remove potential surface contaminants, the core sampl e was broken into small pieces with a flamed chisel. Rock fragment s were manipulated with sterile forceps and crushed to sand-size d fragments using a stainless steel mortar and pestle under flame-induced and low-oxygen anaerobic conditions. For sediment sample s collected in sterile cut-end $10~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ plastic syringes, the sedimen t was directly transferred to enrichment tubes as described below.  

High-pressure enrichments will be used to select for piezophili c (high pressure–adapted) microorganisms using high-pressure vessels (Tamburini et al., 2013). Approximately $5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ or $20{-}30~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ o f rock powder was transferred into $15\;\mathrm{mL}$ glass Hungate tubes or 10 0 mL glass Schott bottles, respectively, and immediately flushed wit h nitrogen gas to remove oxygen. The glass tubes were sealed with  a butyl rubber stopper and filled with sterile (autoclaved and filte r sterilized), anoxic $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ -sparged) artificial or bottom seawater supplemented with a reducing agent $(0.05\%\ \mathrm{Na_{2}S.9H_{2}O)}$ . The Hungat e tubes containing rock slurry were placed into high-pressure bottle s (Nova Swiss, Switzerland) at 8 to $17\,\mathrm{MPa}$ (depending on the depth s of the sites) and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until processing in the shore-base d laboratory. The remaining tubes were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ at atmospheri c pressure $(0.1\ \mathrm{MPa})$ until processing in the shore-based laboratory. Enriched and isolated piezophilic microorganisms will then b e characterized and compared with other microorganisms enriche d and isolated at atmospheric pressure from Atlantis Massif or othe r deep-sea piezophilic microorganisms isolated from different ecosystems. The targeted metabolic groups will be cultivated in a basal culture medium described below.  

For alkaliphilic enrichments, approximately $0.5–1~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of roc k sample was used as the inoculum in $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of anaerobic media $\;{\mathrm{pH}}$ 10) targeting both chemoautotrophic and chemoorganotrophic alkaliphilic microorganisms:  

• Hydrogenotrophic methanogens (media overpressured with hydrogen),   
• Acetoclastic methanogens (media amended with acetate),   
• Methylotrophic methanogens (media amended with methanol),   
• Hydrogenotrophic sulfate-reducers (media amended with sulfate and overpressured hydrogen),   
• Heterotrophic sulfate-reducers (media amended with acetate), and   
• Organic-matter-utilizing microbes (media amended with $2\,\mathrm{g}$ yeast extract and $2\,\mathrm{g}$ tryptone).  

The targeted microbial groups were cultivated in a basal cultur e medium containing (per liter of distilled water):  

• $0.3\;\mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{HPO}_{4},$   
• $\mathrm{1~g~NH_{4}C l},$   
• $20\;\mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{NaCl},$   
• $0.1\;\mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{KCl},$   
• $0.1\mathrm{\;g\,CaCl_{2}{\cdot}2H_{2}O,}$ ,   
• $0.1\mathrm{\;g\;MgCl_{2}{\cdot}7H_{2}O,}$   
• $0.5\:\mathrm{g}$ yeast extract,   
• $10\,\mathrm{mL}$ of Balch trace elements solution (for methanogens) or 1 mL of Widdel trace elements solution (for sulfate-reducers), • $0.5\:\mathrm{g}$ of cysteine hydrochloride (for methanogens),   
• $3\,\mathrm{g}$ of Trizma base, and   
• $1~\mathrm{mL}$ of $0.1\%$ resazurin.  

The $\mathsf{p H}$ was adjusted to 10 with $1\mathrm{~M~KOH}$ . The medium wa s boiled under a stream of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ -free $\ensuremath{\mathrm{N}}_{2}$ gas and cooled to room temperature before being dispensed into Hungate tubes, degassed under $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and subsequently sterilized by autoclaving at $120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for 4 5 min.  

Prior to inoculation, $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\%$ (w/v) $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{S}^{\cdot9}\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ 0.1 mL o f $8\%$ (w/v) $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ , and different substrates were added into eac h tubes depending on targeted metabolism:  

• $0.1\;\mathrm{mL}$ of 1 M Na-acetate solution, • $0.1\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $4\,\mathrm{M}$ methanol solution, • $0.1\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\mathrm{\M\,NaSO_{4}}$ solution, and/or • $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from a mixture of $\mathrm{H}_{2}/\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ $80{\cdot}20\,\mathrm{v/v;}\,2$ bar).  

After enrichment for 1 month or more, the enrichments will b e checked by microscopy to evaluate growth in the shore-based laboratory. Headspace gas in the enrichments will be analyzed by ga s chromatography to evaluate hydrogen production or consumptio n and ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ production, according to methods described i n Mei et al. (2014). Enriched samples will be evaluated in the shorebased laboratory using taxonomic (based on 16S rRNA genes) an d metagenomic analyses of extracted DNA, following establishe d methods (Quéméneur et al., 2014, 2015). Further enrichment to isolation will be also conducted for comparative genomic analyses t o the original samples.  

# Mineral-associated cultivation  

For cultivating microbial groups associated with mineral attachment, WRC samples were wrapped in sterile Whirl-Pak bags an d sealed in gas-impermeable bags with an oxygen scrubber (AnaeroGen, Thermo Scientific) after flushing with $0.22~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh–filtere d ultrahigh-purity nitrogen gas. Samples will be stored at $4^{\circ}C$ in thi s way until the experiment in the onshore laboratory. There, sample s will be homogenized under clean air conditions and distributed fo r incubations following methods described in Suzuki et al. (2014).  

# Water sampling and sensor package data  

As described in the Expedition 357 Scientific Prospectus (FrühGreen et al., 2015), to achieve the geochemistry and microbiolog y objectives of the expedition, an extensive water and gas samplin g program was included to evaluate the performance of the drills, th e composition of fluids emanating from the flushed boreholes, an d the possibility for contamination of samples during transit throug h the water column. In addition to routine sedimentary pore wate r fluid sampling, this expedition also collected water column fluid s using the ship’s CTD Niskin bottle rosette and collected bottom water fluids using Niskin bottles mounted on the rock drill senso r packages. Emphasis was also placed on collecting fluid samples fo r analysis of gas and contamination tracer concentrations. In parallel, a suite of in situ sensors was deployed on the rock drills to quantif y dissolved oxygen, methane, temperature, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), as outlined in each site chapter. Because thi s type of water sampling and sensor package program is unique, thi s section provides more detail on the scope of this program.  

# In situ sensor package  

An in situ sensor package was developed for this program, base d on the industry standard Sea-Bird SBE 55 ECO water sampler. Thi s package (Figure F18A, F18B) consisted of a Sea-Bird SBE 19 plu s V2 SeaCAT profiler to measure conductivity, temperature, an d pressure. Three additional sensors were mounted on the package:  a SBE 63 optical dissolved oxygen sensor, a SBE $27\ \mathrm{pH/ORP}$ (redox ) sensor, and a Franatech METS methane sensor. Borehole fluids an d cuttings flushed by the drill were pumped through a Tygon tube vi a a SBE 5T pump and fed past the conductivity, oxygen, and methan e sensors, with the exhaust of the pump directed at the $\mathrm{{pH/ORP}}$ sensor to bathe it in the same fluids that were flushing through th e other sensors. The intake of the Tygon tubing was located approximately $400\;\mathrm{mm}$ above the mouth of the borehole on each rock drill. Given a pumping rate of $100\ \mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{s}$ and a feed tube about $3\textrm{m}$ lon g and $1.2\,\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter, the delay time to the sensors was less than $4\,\mathsf{s}$ .  

Because of depth limitations, the $\mathsf{p H/O R P}$ sensor was remove d from deployments at sites deeper than $1200\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth. Upo n recovery, sensors were flushed with distilled water to maintain sensor integrity. All sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer prio r to delivery to the ship. Because the drill package pH sensors becam e our primary source for $\mathsf{p H}$ measurements, they were sent for recalibration at the end of the expedition. Prior to the expedition, th e RD2 sensor residual errors were –0.002, 0.004, and $-0.005\,\mathrm{pH}$ unit s at $\mathsf{p H}\,4,7$ , and 10, respectively. Postexpedition, the residual error s for this sensor were $-0.007$ , 0.015, and $-0.007$ at $\mathsf{p H}\,4,\,7$ , and 10, respectively. The residual errors for the sensor on MeBo wer e −0.012, 0.025, and $-0.013$ preexpedition and –0.001, 0.002, an d $-0.001$ postexpedition, again at $\mathsf{p H}\,4,7$ , and 10, respectively.  

It must be noted that the METS $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ sensor has some sensitivit y to molecular $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , and because we expected significant $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations in the Atlantis Massif environment, we asked Franatech t o evaluate this potentially interfering response level. The results o f these tests indicate that the sensor has 0.02 times the sensitivity t o $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ as it does to ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ . Thus, when a signal from the METS sensor i s described in the site chapters, the signal likely represents a combination of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ . Being a membrane device, there is also a delay in the response time of the METS sensor, where a step change i n concentration takes on the order of $1{-}2\;\mathrm{min}$ for $90\%$ response.  

During deployments, real-time data streams of the temperature , ${\mathsf{p H}}$ , ORP, and methane sensors were monitored on board the shi p using Sea-Bird software, logging the data points versus time. Fo r subsequent data processing, logged sensor files were correlate d with drilling logs (i.e., drilling depth versus time), seafloor vide o footage (i.e., documentation of bubble release during operations), and lithologic information.  

# Drill-based water sampling package  

A water sampling package with three $4\mathrm{~L~}$ Niskin bottles wa s mounted on each rock drill to sample fluids emanating from th e borehole during drilling. The water sampler system (Figure F19 ) consisted of a modified SBE 55 Electronic Control Module (ECM), SBE 55 lanyard release assembly, three $4\mathrm{~L~}$ Niskin bottles, and a n additional SBE 5T pump. The Niskin bottles were mounted $0.8\textrm{m}$ above the seafloor on the RD2 rock drill and approximately $1.5\textrm{m}$ above the seafloor on the MeBo drill. Two of the three Niskins wer e flushed through Tygon tubing with the intake of the tubing place d approximately $400\,\mathrm{mm}$ above the mouth of the borehole. The Tygo n tubing was attached to the outlet spigots (left open) of the Niskins, and the top endcaps were left open, allowing the drill fluids to flus h through the bottle. The bottom endcaps were left closed with a oneway valve on the inlet system, preventing backflow out of the bottles. With a pumping rate of $100\;\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{s}$ , the turnover time for flushing the bottles was about $1.3\;\mathrm{min}$ .  

The top endcaps were closed remotely with the SBE 55 ECM , and the pump simultaneously shut off when a water sample was required, trapping the flushed drill fluid in the Niskin bottles. Th e third bottle was set up in a standard open-ended configuration t o sample near-bottom water fluids when triggered. Each bottle coul d be fired independently via a serial interface to the surface runnin g the SBE Seaterm software, either immediately after completion o f drilling or when a peak was seen on the real-time sensor.  

The water sampler/sensor package was deployed and recovere d in the vertical position on the RD2 drill, whereas the package for th e MeBo drill was deployed and recovered in a horizontal position. Thus, if the top endcaps failed to close on RD2 deployments, wate r samples could still be retained upon recovery, whereupon the to p endcaps could be manually closed to preserve dissolved gases. However, failure of the top caps on the MeBo system would result in th e

total loss of sample. Additionally, the bottles on the RD2 could b e sampled directly on the drill rig, whereas MeBo Niskin bottles wer e recovered in the horizontal position and required removal from th e drill rig prior to sampling. A summary of sensor package/wate r sampler deployment locations, dates, and sampling times are liste d in Table T5.  

# Ship’s Niskin bottle sampling  

Prior to the deployment of the drill and commencement of drilling operations at each site, a cast of the ship’s wireline CTD rosett e with six $^{10\,\mathrm{L}}$ Niskin bottles was performed to collect water from a s close to the seafloor as possible (generally $2{-}3\textrm{m}$ above seafloor). These samples were used to characterize the geochemistry and microbiology of the near-basement fluids prior to drilling and fo r comparison with drill fluids captured with the sensor package sampling. During these casts, three of the $^\mathrm{~10~L~}$ bottles were triggere d near the seafloor. An additional three bottles were triggered at shallower depths in the water column for microbiological characterization to identify seawater microorganisms that the cores may b e exposed to during ascension to the surface. In addition to the cast s above the sites, two additional casts were conducted away from Atlantis Massif to collect background water and characterize the microbiological and geochemical signatures typical for seawater a t these depths. The cast locations, associated drill sites, and trigge r depths are listed in Table T6.

# Water sample split plan and fixation  

The sampling approach was similar for both the ship’s CTD Niskin bottles and the drill rig sensor package Niskin bottles (Tabl e T7). When recovered to deck, samples were immediately collecte d for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ concentrations and helium isotopes from the roc k drill sensor packages. The bottles were subsequently sampled fo r the PFC tracer, DIC concentrations and isotopes, organic geochemistry, reference samples for sediment interstitial water standar d measurements (see below), δD and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of water, $\delta^{34}\!S$ of sulfate, cel l counts, and nucleic acid extraction. In some cases, water for nonga s measurements was first collected into a precleaned 4 low-densit y polyethylene (LDPE) cubic container and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until furthe r processing. On the ship’s CTD casts, only the near-bottom Niski n bottles were sampled for geochemistry, and all bottles were sample d for cell counts and nucleic acid extraction. From the rock drill sensor packages, all bottles were sampled for $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ $\mathrm{{CH}_{4}}$ , PFC tracer concentration, cell counts, and nucleic acids. Only one of the tw o flushed Niskins was sampled for the remainder of the geochemica l analyses.  

For $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ concentration measurements, $100~\mathrm{mL}$ of bubble-free water was directly drawn into $140\;\mathrm{mL}$ plastic syringes fitte d with two-way stopcocks, followed by the addition of $40\,\mathrm{mL}$ of ultrahigh-purity helium. The sample was vigorously shaken and allowe d to warm to room temperature in the analytical laboratory to reac h equilibrium. Aliquots of the headspace gas were injected into an SR I  

8610C gas chromatograph equipped with a $30\,\mathrm{m}$ molecular sieve 5 A column (Restek MXT-PLOT, $0.53\;\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter) run at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $18~\mathrm{mL/min}$ with ultrapure helium as carrier gas. Make-up helium for the pulsed discharge detector (PDD) was set at $30\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ . $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations were determined with the PDD, and $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ concentrations were measured with a flame ionization detector. Ga s concentrations were calculated based on $100\ \mathrm{ppm\(\pm5\%)}$ standard s of $\mathrm{CH_{4}}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in helium (Scotty Analyzed Gases) diluted to 1, 2, 5, and 10 ppm with helium.  

For helium isotopes, bubble-free water was collected accordin g to established methods (Young and Lupton, 1983) by flushing flui d through a $^{1\textrm{m}}$ long section of $1.9~\mathrm{cm}$ diameter refrigeration grad e copper tubing and then manually crimping the tubing closed. Samples were stored at room temperature until analysis for concentration and isotope ratios.  

Fluids for reference samples for sediment interstitial water standard measurements were collected into $20~\mathrm{mL}$ plastic syringes an d capped until splitting. Samples taken from the ship’s CTD Niski n bottles are labeled “IWref1,” and samples from the rock drill senso r packages are labeled “IWref2.” The fluids were filtered through a 0. 2 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh, $25\,\mathrm{mm}$ diameter cellulose acetate filter into ${\tt a}\,20\,\mathrm{mL}$ polypropylene vial, and then the samples were distributed for analyse s (Table T8).  

Samples for organic geochemistry were collected both filtere d and unfiltered. Unfiltered fluids were collected directly into both 3 0 and $125~\mathrm{mL}$ high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles and store d frozen. Filtered samples were first collected into either a precleane d $4\,\mathrm{L}$ LDPE cubic container (from the ship’s CTD Niskins) or into  a precleaned $^\textrm{\scriptsize1L}$ HDPE bottle (from the rock drill sensor packages). The water was filtered through two precombusted $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $5\;\mathrm{{h}}$ ) $\mathrm{GF/75~47~mm}$ filters $\left(0.3\ \upmu\mathrm{m}\right)$ nominal pore size, Advantec) using  a peristaltic pump and silicon tubing. The two filters were stacked o n top of each other. The upper filter was used for particulate organi c matter concentration and isotope analysis, and the bottom one wa s used to assess the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC ) sorbed to the glass fiber during filtering. The filtrate was collecte d into 30 and $125~\mathrm{mL}$ HDPE bottles that were stored frozen. All bottles, tubing, and filter holders were acid washed $(5\%\mathrm{\,HCl;}$ overnight ) prior to use. Both filtered and unfiltered samples will be analyze d for DOC concentrations and amino acid concentrations accordin g to established methods (Cowie and Hedges, 1992a).  

Water samples were collected from the rock drill sensor packag e Niskins into $^\mathrm{~1~L~}$ HDPE bottles for analysis of the $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ content o f DOC by the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (NOSAMS) following established protocols (Beaupré e t al., 2007). On one of background ship’s CTD casts, additional samples for analysis of the $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ content of DIC were collected. Bubblefree water from the Niskin bottle was transferred with Tygon tubin g to the bottom of a $250\;\mathrm{mL}$ Pyrex bottle with a ground-glass stopper. Water was allowed to flush for 1.5 bottle volumes before the bottl e was closed. In the laboratory, $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ of the fluid was drawn off wit h a syringe, and the samples were poisoned with $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of saturate d mercuric chloride. Apiezon grease was applied to the ground glas s stopper, and the bottle was closed and stored in the dark at roo m temperature.  

To enable $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ measurements, extensive surveys of the ship’s laboratories and equipment were conducted prior to the expedition t o assess for potential tracer $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ contamination. Tests for gross contamination were collected according to the protocols of Projec t SWAB  at  the  University  of  Miami  (http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/tritium/swab). In brief, the detergent Count-Of f was spread on test patches and then transferred to bottles usin g one-time-use disposable sponges. Samples were submitted to th e Tritium Laboratory at the University of Miami (Florida, USA) an d analyzed by scintillation counting. More sensitive swipe testing fo r contamination that could still be problematic for natural abundanc e $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ analysis was performed in the same locations by wetting a precombusted $(500^{\circ}\mathrm{C};5\,\mathrm{h})$ quartz filter with methanol and then wipin g test surfaces. The filters were rolled into 2-dram screw-cap vials an d shipped to NOSAMS for analysis. Two fume hoods were identifie d as having postmodern $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ levels. All fume hoods were therefor e thoroughly cleaned with dilute acid $(4\%\,\mathrm{HCl})$ ), Contrad 70 detergen t (Decon Labs $\mathrm{P/N}\,1002)$ , and Milli-Q $(18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega)$ water. Teflon sheeting was then placed on top of all fume hood surfaces. No organi c geochemical samples or $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ samples were exposed in these fum e hoods, and no other tested areas were identified as problematic, including sample processing equipment such as mortar and pestles, rock saws, and rock boxes and surfaces such as laboratory benches. As an additional precaution, Teflon sheeting was affixed on laboratory benches used for organic geochemistry sample processing. Sample bottles for DOC and DIC $^{14}\mathrm{C}$ analysis were placed in individual bags prior to arriving on the ship; the bags will be remove d prior to shipping samples to NOSAMS for analysis.

Fluid samples for δD and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of water and $\delta^{34}\!S$ of sulfate wer e collected from the filtrate of the GF/75 filters used to collect organi c carbon samples (from the ship’s CTD Niskins) or from the Sterive x filters used to collect nucleic acid samples (from the rock drill sensor package Niskins, as described below). Aliquots of $60~\mathrm{mL}$ wer e collected into amber HDPE bottles and stored at room temperature. Samples for sulfur isotopes were acidified to ${\mathsf{p H}}\,3$ with $30\%$ HCl.  

Samples for cell detection and enumeration were collected int o sterile $50~\mathrm{mL}$ plastic centrifuge tubes and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until processing. In some cases, cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde a t  

$2\%{-}4\%$ concentration and storing at $4^{\circ}C$ until analysis in a shorebased laboratory. In other cases, samples were frozen directly in  a CAS freezer.  

To assess microbial community composition in water samples , fluids for nucleic acid extraction were collected into precleaned $4\,\mathrm{L}$ cubic containers and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until further processing. Fluid s were subsequently filtered onto $0.22~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh Sterivex filter cartridges (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) using an inlin e peristaltic pump; $1{-}4\,\mathrm{L}$ of fluid was filtered in duplicate per sample. Sterivex filter cartridges were stored frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ until analysi s in a shore-based laboratory following previously described method s (Brazelton et al., 2013).

# Sediment Rhizon sampling, split plan, and fixation  

Where feasible in sediment layers overlying hard rocks, por e water was sampled immediately after minimal curation and fasttrack MSCL analysis. Pore water was collected through $0.15~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh $5\ \mathrm{cm}$ long CSS-F Rhizon samplers (Rhizosphere Researc h Products, Netherlands) into precleaned $20~\mathrm{mL}$ plastic syringes following established protocols (Dickens et al., 2007; Seeberg-Elverfeldt et al., 2005). Table T9 summarizes the samples collected fo r pore water analysis. A $3.8~\mathrm{mm}$ hole was drilled through the plasti c core liner using a spacer on the drill bit to prevent penetrating th e core. A Rhizon sampler with the same diameter was then inserte d into the core, and negative pressure was applied to pull pore wate r into the syringe. Rhizon samplers remained in the cores for 30–4 5 min. Usually, one to two Rhizon samples were collected per cor e section; more were collected depending on microbiology sampling. Rhizons were spaced $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ apart from the window cut for microbiology syringe sampling or the endcap to obtain sufficient por e water from a single interval. After collection, the filtered fluid samplers were distributed according to the split plan (Table T8). Detail s on the analysis of pore water chemistry are described in Fluid inorganic chemistry analyses.

# Borehole plugs  

Expedition 357 required the ability to seal the boreholes whil e allowing repeated access to them in the future (for example, by remotely operated vehicle [ROV]), as outlined in the Expedition 35 7 Scientific Prospectus (Früh-Green et al., 2015). In addition, the system was required to be as unreactive as possible to ensure collectio n of pristine fluid samples. A downhole plug was developed (Figur e F20) to be deployed by either the MeBo or RD2 system on completion of coring operations. Owing to the different drive mechanism s of the two drills, different adaptations of the plug were required.  

The primary sealing component of the downhole plug is base d on a water-expandable material that swells in the hole over a perio d of time, with the rate of swelling such that drilling can take plac e prior to installation. The extent of swelling must ensure a good sidewall seal is achieved when the plug is set at a depth below seafloo r interpreted from survey data to be competent rock. The downhol e plugs were stored in the tool rack of the drills until completion o f coring. For this expedition, the swellable packer material was Elastomer 1000/60 from Reactive Downhole Tools, which was boun d onto a modified drill rod.  

The secondary sealing component consisted of a ball valve insert at the top of the plug system, with multiple systems of O-ring s to prevent bottom seawater intrusion into the borehole. During deployment, the ball valve was set in the closed position to leave th e boreholes sealed under possible future sampling efforts.  

To minimize reactivity of the borehole plug, all metal components in contact with the potentially corrosive borehole environment  (i.e.,  elevated  temperatures $[40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}]$ and  high  pH)  wer e constructed of either titanium or coated steel (BodyCote Tech 1 2 Thin Coat Ceramic). In addition, the lower end of the system wa s constructed of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and nylon plastic.  

The downhole plug configuration contains (1) the lower expandable packer and (2) an upper tube with a top cap. It has a central inner tube that acts as the conduit to the surface. A stop ring, designed to prevent the downhole plug from falling down the hol e while the packer section expands in the hole, is placed at a define d distance in the upper section. The stop ring position is set to ensur e the packer seals against competent rock while the cap sits above th e seafloor. At the top of the plug, the cap can be removed to allow ful l access to the borehole, or a valve can be opened to allow limited bu t controlled access to the borehole. Both can be operated through th e use of an ROV. The top cap system was designed by Develogi c GmBH, Hamburg, Germany.

# Physical properties  

The physical properties measurement program for Expeditio n 357 included acquisition of data on whole-round sections, spli t cores, and samples. These measurements are valuable in characterizing lithologic units and formation properties and, in the case o f nondestructive whole-core measurements, can provide useful insight into the recovered materials ahead of splitting and sampling.  

Offshore, two Geotek MSCLs were used to acquire whole-cor e rapid magnetic susceptibility (MSCL-fast) measurements as well a s slower high-resolution measurements of gamma density, noncontact resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility (a small amount of $P_{-}$ - wave velocity data are available). Onshore, whole-core measurements continued with NGR and through-liner core scans undertaken ahead of the OSP in Bremen. During the OSP, digital line-sca n images and color reflectance spectrophotometry measurements o n split cores were acquired. In addition, samples from split cores wer e measured for MAD and discrete $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity. Measurements ar e presented here in the order in which they were taken.  

# Offshore physical properties  

Shipboard measurements of physical properties were acquire d to characterize lithostratigraphic units and formation properties o f the recovered rocks. The data provide fast, nondestructive insigh t into the nature of the sampled rocks and aid the interpretation o f larger scale geophysical and geological data.  

To accommodate the need for quick microbiological samplin g while still ensuring a continuous and consistent data set for all th e recovered material, initial magnetic susceptibility measurement s were undertaken using a fast-track MSCL-152 without allowing th e cores to equilibrate to room temperature. With the exception of th e bottommost intervals of certain holes that were sampled and immediately frozen for microbiology (see Microbiology; Table T10), every core section was measured on the fast-track MCSL. In order t o minimize the time prior to microbiology sampling and maximiz e the efficiency of core flow, cores were logged out of order. Typically, cores sampled for microbiology were prioritized with the deepes t core first, followed by the next deepest, and then every other cor e moving uphole. Cores not sampled for microbiology were usuall y measured last.  

After microbiology sampling and initial core description in th e deck laboratory, cores were moved to the petrophysics containerized laboratory and allowed to equilibrate to laboratory temperature $(\mathrm{{\approx}19^{\circ}{-}21^{\circ}C)}$ . Ensuring a stable laboratory temperature fo r these measurements was important because the majority are affected by temperature variations. Data were corrected for deviations from the optimal operating temperature for the sensor s $(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Gamma ray attenuation bulk density, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, noncontact electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility were sequentially measured using the standard MSCL-99 on whole core s (Table T11). Supplementary measurements of core diameter an d temperature were used in processing data for the principal measurements. For all sensors, the sampling interval was set to $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ providing a high-resolution data set based on the amount of cor e and the time available. Core sections shorter than $15~\mathrm{cm}$ were no t logged, and core catcher pieces were only measured if they were 1 5 cm or longer.

# Fast-track magnetic susceptibility  

The fast-track MSCL consists of two Bartington MS3 meters, each coupled to a MS2C sensor coil. Both loop sensors have an internal diameter of $90\ \mathrm{mm}$ . The nonstandard loops have offset frequencies  of  513  and $621\ \mathrm{\Hz}$ (serial  numbers  467  and  466, respectively), which, on processing, require rescaling the data by th e correction factors of 0.908 and 1.099, respectively. Measurement s were taken at an offset of $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ sampling interval at each sensor, giving an overall sampling rate of $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ along the length of the cores. The sampling integration period for the MS3 meters was set to 1 s. Before logging each core, the sensor was set to zero itself. Magneti c susceptibility data are recorded as corrected volume-specific units: $K\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{Sl}$ I. This calculation takes into account the relative effect o f the diameter of the core and the diameter of the sensor coil and i s performed automatically in the processing of the data:  

$$
K=K_{\mathrm{uncor}}/K_{\mathrm{rel}},
$$  

where $K_{\mathrm{uncor}}$ is the uncorrected volume-specific magnetic susceptibility provided by the magnetic susceptibility system. $K_{\mathrm{rel}}$ define s the relationship between the coil and core diameters as follow s (Geotek MSCL Manual; http://www.geotek.co.uk/downloads):  

$$
K_{\mathrm{rel}}=4.8566(d/D_{\mathrm{l}})^{2}-3.0163(d/D_{\mathrm{l}})-0.6448.
$$  

A calibration check was carried out using loop-specific calibration pieces provided by the manufacturer $(767\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ and $185~\times$ $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI},$ ) prior to starting fast-track measurements for each hole an d every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ .  

# Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

Gamma ray attenuation was measured by emitting a narro w beam of collimated gamma rays from a cesium-137 $\mathrm{^{137}C s;}$ half-life $=$ 30.2 y) source at one side of the core and detecting the photon s passing through the core. The input gamma ray peak has a principa l energy level of $0.662\;\mathrm{MeV}$ that is primarily attenuated by Compto n scattering. The attenuation is directly related to the number of electrons in the gamma ray beam and is a function of the core thicknes s and the electron density. The density of the core material is determined by measuring the number of transmitted photons that pas s through the core unattenuated. Used as a proxy for bulk density, th e degree of gamma ray attenuation is inversely proportional to th e density of the core material, with high counts acquired from lowdensity core and low counts from high-density core. The equatio n used for determining bulk density from gamma ray attenuation is a s follows (Geotek MSCL Manual, http://www.geotek.co.uk/downloads):  

$$
\rho=1/(\upmu d)\times\ln(l_{0}/l),
$$  

where  

$\uprho=$ sample bulk density,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient,   
$d=$ sample thickness,   
$l_{0}=$ gamma source intensity, and   
$l=$ measured intensity through the sample.  

The $5\ \mathrm{mm}$ gamma collimator was used to maximize gamm a counts performed over a count time of $^{10\ s},$ . Calibration of th e gamma density sensor was made using a stepped aluminum densit y standard placed in the same type of liner in which the cores wer e retrieved. Gamma counts were taken over a 60 s period throug h each of five aluminum steps of known thickness (6, 5, 4, 3, and  2 cm). Two types of calibration were performed: one with a distille d water-filled liner, simulating water-saturated material and used fo r sediment cores, and one in air, simulating dry material and used fo r hard rock cores. This calibration was checked using the water calibration piece at the start of each hole and every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ thereafter.  

# P-wave velocity  

The ultrasonic $P$ -wave pulse of $230\;\mathrm{kHz}$ produced by the transducer transmitter (TX) propagates through the core and is detecte d by the transducer receiver (RX). The received signal is amplified b y automatic gain control, and the pulse timing is determined automatically by a “zero-crossing” algorithm. Negative excursions belo w a set threshold are detected, and the first break time is approximately one wavelength before the first zero-crossing after the firs t negative excursion below the threshold. The total observed tim e (TOT) is the sum of the pulse traveltime (TT) within the core an d the $P$ -wave traveltime offset (PTO). PTO includes the pulse traveltime through the liner and through the transducer faces, the dela y caused by the zero-crossing algorithm picking a point on the waveform one cycle later than the onset, and electronic delays in the system circuitry. It is determined from the calibration performed wit h a liner filled with distilled water at a known ambient temperature. The velocity of the distilled water at the given temperature $\mathbf{\rho}(\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{t}})$ bein g known, PTO can be calculated from the following equations:  

$$
\mathrm{PTO}=\mathrm{TOT}-X/\mathbf{v_{t}},
$$  

and  

$$
X=D-\;W,
$$  

where $X$ is the internal diameter of the core liner and $D$ and $W$ ar e the distance between transducer faces and the total wall thickness, respectively. The transducers also measure displacement, monitoring small variations in the outer diameter of the core liner. Thes e variations are used in processing not only $P$ -wave velocity data bu t also the gamma density and magnetic susceptibility data sets. Additionally, the measured $P$ -wave velocity is compensated for slight differences in temperature at the time of measurement.  

The initial calibration was checked at the start of each hole an d at $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ intervals thereafter using the water calibration check piece.  

# Noncontact electrical resistivity  

Electrical resistivity was measured using a noncontact electrica l resistivity sensor, which consists of two sets of transmitter-receive r coils. The transmitter generates a high-frequency magnetic fiel d that induces electric currents in the core. The intensity of the induced currents is proportional to the conductivity of the core material and thus inversely proportional to its resistivity. The receive r coil measures the small magnetic field induced by these electric currents, which is then normalized with the measurements of the second set, operating in air. Measurements were performed with a n averaging period of $5\;{\mathsf{s}},$ . At the beginning of each core, the senso r was zeroed and a free air measurement was taken in order to account for drift.  

An initial calibration was carried out with six standards of cor e liner filled with saline solutions with salinities of 35, 17.5, 8.75, 3.5, 1.75, and $0.35\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{L}$ . Calibration checks were undertaken at the beginning of each hole and every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ thereafter using the $17.5\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{L}$ salinit y standard.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured using a Bartington MS 3 meter coupled to a MS2C sensor coil (serial number 725S). Th e standard loop sensor used during Expedition 357 has an internal diameter of $80~\mathrm{mm}$ and a coil diameter of $88~\mathrm{mm}$ and operates at  a frequency of $565\,\mathrm{Hz}$ . Similar to the loops used on the fast-track system, this loop operates at an offset frequency that requires correction on processing using a correction factor of 1.099. Magneti c susceptibility measurements on the MSCL-S were taken with a sampling integration period of $5\;\mathrm{s}$ . Before logging each core, the senso r was programmed to zero itself. Magnetic susceptibility data wer e recorded in corrected volume-specific units $\left(\times\ 10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}\right)$ . A calibration check was performed using the sensor-specific calibratio n check piece at the beginning of each hole and then every $^{6\,\mathrm{h},}$ as wit h the other sensors.  

# Data quality  

Core quality influences physical properties data quality. Optimum data quality is achieved when the core liners are completel y filled. If they are not, volume-dependent gamma density, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements may give value s that are too low because the correction for volume is based on variations in the core liner diameter rather than the diameter of the cor e itself. $P_{-}$ -wave velocity measurements require effective acoustic coupling across the core, which normally requires a combination o f good core quality and fluid saturation. Cores acquired during Expedition 357 were commonly slightly undersized relative to the liner, and fluid saturation is rare, so transmission of an acoustic puls e across the core for $P$ -wave velocity measurements was generally no t possible. The $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity data set is therefore largely absent.  

A full calibration of all MSCL sensors was performed at the beginning of the expedition and repeated each time the core liner typ e was changed (the RD2 and MeBo drills use slightly different cor e liners), if significant departures from the active calibration were observed, or if the system was powered down. Full calibrations wer e checked every $^{6\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ by logging three calibration standards: distille d water, $17.5~\mathrm{g/L}$ saline water, and the magnetic susceptibility chec k piece.  

The magnetic susceptibility loop used for measuring cores o n the MSCL-S was selected to minimize the distance between the coi l and the core. One oversized core section (357-M0069A-5R-1) coul d not pass through the $80\;\mathrm{mm}$ loop, so a $90\;\mathrm{mm}$ loop (borrowed fro m the fast-track system) was used instead.  

# Onshore physical properties  

# Natural gamma radiation  

The NGR of a material is a function of the proportion of natura l unstable or radioactive isotopes the material contains. In ultramafi c igneous rocks, these emitters are predominantly the three majo r naturally occurring radioactive nuclides $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ an d their daughter products. Despite forming the majority of the radioactive isotopes, these elements tend to occur in extremely low abundances within ultramafic rocks (averages: $\mathrm{\mathit{K}}\,=\,0.003\%$ , $\mathrm{~U~}=\,0.001$ ppm, $\mathrm{Th}=0.004\,\mathrm{ppm}_{\cdot}$ ) (Van Schmus, 1995).  

NGR data were collected from all Expedition 357 cores utilizin g a Geotek multiple-section MSCL (MSCL-XYZ) located in the BCR. In addition to the built-in lead shielding around the detector, two  1 cm thick steel plates stacked on top of each other were positione d under the apparatus to shield the effects of the concrete floor of th e repository.  

Once the MSCL-XYZ and cores had been allowed to equilibrat e to the temperature of the core repository $(4^{\circ}C)$ , three standard reference materials (IAEA RGTh-1, RGK-1, and RGU-1) were utilize d to calibrate the spectrum, assigning detectable energy ranges to th e 1024 channels. This calibration was checked on a weekly basis. Additionally, a long background measurement was recorded over a period of ${\approx}16\,\mathrm{h}$ and used to correct core data for the ambient levels o f gamma radiation in the repository.  

The measurement window is dictated by the detector size (7.6 2 $\mathbf{cm}_{}^{\mathrm{\dagger}}$ ), and a $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ sampling interval was consequently employed fo r the majority of the cores to ensure detector overlap between adjacent measurement intervals. Exceptions to this sampling interval were made for core material recovered from priority NGR hole s (M0068A, M0071C, and M0076B) where corresponding in sit u measurements were acquired (see Downhole logging). These core s were measured with a $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ sampling interval. A measurement tim e of $3\;\mathrm{min}$ per sample point was used to ensure optimal data qualit y given the anticipated low NGR values.  

Data were recorded as total counts per second (cps) using  a Brightspec detector/bMCA sodium iodide scintillator (a 3 inch diameter, 2 inch thick NaI(Tl) crystal, and integral photomultiplie r tube) detecting energies between 0 and 3 MeV. All data recorde d were background-normalized.  

# Through-liner digital imaging  

Through-liner digital line scan images of whole cores were obtained ahead of the OSP using the Avaatech Superslit X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanner at MARUM (supported by the DFGLeibniz Center for Surface Process and Climate Studies at the University of Potsdam, Germany). The scanner has an option fo r mounting a line-scan camera and linear light source on the syste m to facilitate acquisition of high-resolution color images. In additio n to these images, the system outputs accurate color data in redgreen-blue  (RGB)  and  Commission  Internationale  d’Eclairag e (CIELab) units $\mathrm{{[^{*}=}}$ lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}=$ green to red chromacity, and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ $=$ blue to yellow chromacity) by way of individual charge-couple d device (CCD) pixel calibration. The Line Scan program uses th e Stemmer Common Vision Blox platform to acquire and proces s color images.  

The camera system contains a 3-CCD camera with beam-splitter and manually controlled Pentax $50~\mathrm{mm}$ lens. The resulting image resolution is approximately 150 pixels/cm in the cross-core an d downcore directions. With an exposure time of $5\;\mathrm{ms}.$ , a scan spee d of $125~\mathrm{mm/s}$ was achieved. Image coverage is approximately 13. 5 cm in the cross-core direction and a maximum of $154~\mathrm{cm}$ in th e downcore direction.  

After powering up, the line scan system was allowed to stabiliz e for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ before calibration was undertaken. Calibration of the equipment was done once every $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ using white and black calibratio n pieces:  

• White calibration: lens open at $f/11+$ (a fixed value between 11 and 16), scanning a white surface present within the scanner.   
• Black calibration: lens closed with the lens cap and white surface covered up.   
• After calibration: lens open at $\mathrm{{f}/9.5}$ .  

All cores were measured using an aperture setting of $\mathrm{{f}}/9.5$ ( a fixed value between 8 and 11). This fixed setting was selected ove r custom settings per hole or core in order to ensure a consistent dat a set. Each whole-core section was scanned four times, rotating $90^{\circ}$ clockwise (looking uphole) after each scan. The initial scan was always acquired with the division between the working and archiv e halves up (archive half to the right). Note that this division wa s based on the provisional scribe marked during curation offshor e and that the division of halves for splitting, defined followin g through-liner description, may differ.  

Wherever a WRC sample was taken, a foam spacer of the sam e length was inserted in its place and labeled “MBIO.” Four outpu t files were generated for each core section: a high-resolution bitma p file (BMP), a compressed image file (JPEG), a tagged image fil e (TIF), and a numeric text file (TXT). Numeric data are presented i n RGB units.  

# Split-core digital imaging  

Similar to the process for whole cores, digital line-scan image s of split cores were obtained using the line-scan camera and linea r light source on the XRF core scanner. For Expedition 357, both th e working and archive halves were imaged wet and dry. The wet archive image was used as the primary core image for the VCD sheets.  

Every split core was imaged with a color/gray chart beside it, and this scan is available as the original file. Similar to the throughliner images, four output files were generated for each core section, with numeric data presented in RGB units. The line-scan syste m was calibrated every $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ with black and white calibration. Unles s otherwise stated on the output files, wet split cores were measure d using an aperture setting of $\mathrm{{f}}/9.5$ and dry split cores were measure d using aperture setting $f/11+$ . Because of the variability in color o f the samples from this expedition, the aperture was varied when appropriate to ensure optimal image quality. Wherever a WRC sampl e was removed from the core, a foam spacer was inserted in its plac e and marked as $^{\prime}\mathrm{MBIO}^{\prime\prime}$ (for microbiology samples) or $\boldsymbol{^{\alpha}}\mathrm{TSB^{\prime\prime}}$ (fo r thin section billet samples). The numeric data files were correcte d to the same length as the modified BMP picture files. Both origina l and corrected files were made available to the science party. Composite images of the wet archive-half split cores are available in MBIOWRC in Supplementary material.  

# Color reflectance spectrophotometry  

The color reflectance spectrophotometer measures the reflection or transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength. During the OSP in Bremen, color reflectance was measure d on the archive halves of dry rock cores. The archive halves of th e few sediment cores that were recovered were measured as soon after splitting as reasonably possible to ensure the highest quality dat a were acquired from the split surface. Sediment cores are more susceptible to change (through oxidation and fluid loss), and the original color of the sediment is therefore more ephemeral than that o f rock cores.  

Measurements were undertaken using a handheld Minolt a spectrophotometer CM-2600d with an $8\;\mathrm{mm}$ aperture. To make th e measurements more sensitive to surface conditions (notably th e roughness of the surface), they were performed in the instrument’ s specular component excluded (SCE) mode. In this mode, the specular reflection (the light reflecting with the same angle as the inciden t angle but in the opposite direction) is omitted, and only the diffus e reflection that scatters in various directions is measured.  

Where possible, measurements were taken every $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ along th e center line of the core sections unless the core center was disturbe d by a discontinuity such as a fracture or a vein. To avoid these discontinuities, measurements were shifted left or right of the centerline o f the core. This information was noted in the log sheet that accompanies the data. Because of the heterogeneity of cores from this expedition and the fact that high color contrast often occurs acros s boundaries, it was also necessary to select measurement points tha t would provide the most representative data. Measurements wer e not performed on rubbly core intervals unless individual pieces o f rubble were large enough and had been split. A detailed examination of core images, disturbance descriptions, and log sheets is recommended during analysis of spectrophotometric data.  

To keep the spectrophotometer window clean, core surface s were covered with clear plastic film (Hostaphan) before acquirin g measurements.  

To compensate for the effects of stray light inside the instrumen t (due to dust or dirt), a zero calibration was carried out every $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ o r whenever the system was rebooted, using the Zero Calibration Bo x and a white calibration piece ( $100\%$ reflection). Three measurements were taken each time for both calibration pieces. Additionally, a control measurement of the white calibration piece wa s carried out at the beginning and end of each core section to monito r data quality and ensure the sensor was working properly.  

The spectrophotometry measurements produced three types o f data:  

• $\mathrm{~L~}^{\ast},\,\mathbf{a}^{\ast};$ , and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ dimensions in the CIELab color space. $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ is the total reflectance index ranging from $0\%$ to $100\%$ corresponding to black and white, respectively. Negative $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ values are green colors, and positive ones are red colors. Similarly, negative $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ values are blue colors, and positive ones are yellow colors.   
• Hue angle (H), value (or lightness, V), and chroma (or color purity, C) in the Munsell color space.   
• Intensity of 31 wave bands of $10\,\mathrm{nm}$ from 400 to $700\;\mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths corresponding to the range of light visible to the human eye.  

# Discrete sample measurements  

Cylindrical samples ( $\operatorname{2cm}$ in diameter; ${\approx}3\,\mathrm{cm}$ in length) were cu t from the working halves for both discrete triaxial $P$ -wave velocit y and MAD measurements. The sampling interval was variable between holes and dictated by the availability of sufficiently coheren t and homogeneous material appropriate for these analyses. Give n the limited number of samples from each site, sampling a range o f lithologies from the different sites was important to establish som e sense of the range of $P$ -wave velocity and MAD values across th e study area. After the wet mass (as part of the MAD measurements ) was determined, $P$ -wave velocities were measured before the samples were dried and prior to acquisition of the remaining MA D measurements.  

# Moisture and density  

Moisture content; bulk, dry, and grain densities; porosity; an d void ratio were calculated from the wet and dry masses and the dr y volume of samples.  

After sampling, discrete samples were immediately transferre d into numbered $10\,\mathrm{mL}$ borosilicate glass beakers of known mass an d volume. Samples were weighed in the beakers on an electrical balance with a precision of $0.001\,\mathrm{g}$ . After wet mass and $P$ -wave velocit y measurements were completed, samples were dried in an oven a t $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . On removal from the oven, samples wer e allowed to cool to room temperature in a desiccator for at least $^{1\,\mathrm{h}}$ before they were weighed again to acquire the dry mass.  

The dry volume was measured to a precision of $0.02\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ with  a Quantachrome pentapycnometer based on $\mathrm{He}$ -displacement with  a purge time of 1 min. Volumes for each sample are given as the averages of three measurements. Four samples and one standard volum e were measured in each batch. Three stainless steel spheres with  a total volume of ${\approx}9.2149\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were used as the standard and were cycled through the 5 cells as a check for equipment functionality.  

The mass and volume of the beakers were subtracted from th e measured total mass and volume to give the wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{w}}\right)$ , dr y mass $(M_{\mathrm{d}})$ , and dry volume $\mathbf{\nabla}(V_{\mathrm{d}})$ of the sample. To account for sal t precipitation from evaporating pore fluid during drying of the sample, a salt-corrected pore water mass $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ was calculated:  

$$
M_{\mathrm{pw}}=[(M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})/(1-s)],
$$  

where $_s$ is the salinity of the pore fluid, which is assumed to be tha t of seawater $(35\,\mathrm{g/L)}$ following Blum (1997). The salt-corrected soli d mass $(M_{s})$ is then  

$$
M_{\mathrm{s}}=M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

The volume of the pore water $\mathrm{\nabla}V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ is  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}},
$$  

where $\uprho_{\mathsf{p w}}$ is the pore water density, assumed to be $1.024~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (Blum, 1997).  

The mass of the salt itself is  

$$
\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{salt}}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{d}}),
$$  

and its volume is  

$$
V_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}},
$$  

where $\mathsf{\rho_{\mathsf{P s a l t}}}$ is the density of salt $(2.22\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ .  

From this, the solid volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$ can be calculated as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{s}}=V_{\mathrm{d}}-V_{\mathrm{salt}},
$$  

and the wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{w}}\right)$ can be calculated as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{w}}=V_{\mathrm{s}}+V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Moisture content relative to the wet mass $(W_{\mathrm{w}})$ is  

$$
W_{\mathrm{w}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{w}},
$$  

and moisture content relative to the salt-corrected solid mass $(W_{\mathrm{s}})$ is  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{W_{\mathrm{s}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{s}}.}\end{array}
$$  

Bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{b}})$ , dry density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{d}}),$ grain density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{g}})$ , porosit y ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio (e) are defined as  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\rho_{\mathrm{b}}=M_{\mathrm{w}}/V_{\mathrm{w}},}\\ &{\uprho_{\mathrm{d}}=M_{s}/V_{\mathrm{w}},}\\ &{\uprho_{\mathrm{g}}=M_{s}/V_{s},}\\ &{\Updownarrow}\\ &{\Updownarrow}\end{array}
$$  

and  

$$
e=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{s}}.
$$  

Because of the high heterogeneity encountered in individua l cores, both the working and archive halves of all cores were digitall y imaged on splitting. Each core half was imaged both wet and dr y (see above), and it is therefore feasible that some pore fluid ma y have evaporated and some of the dissolved salt precipitated at thi s stage. Therefore, the solid volume of the samples may be overestimated, and the porosity and grain density may be underestimated. Salt precipitation during the $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ drying between the measuremen t of the wet and the dry mass has been accounted for as describe d above, but this does not include the potential precipitation durin g the drying prior to the determination of the wet mass. Additionally, the correction for salt precipitation assumes seawater salinity, although the cores have been split and sampled using freshwater. These limitations should be considered when evaluating the MA D results.  

Discrete P-wave velocity  

To a large extent, this description follows that given in Expedition 325 Scientists (2011). Where the methodology used here is substantially different, mention will be made in the text.  

$P$ -wave velocity can be derived from the traveltime of acousti c waves passing through a sample of known thickness. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity varies with lithology, porosity, saturation, and bulk density, a s well as state of stress and degree of fracturing. In sediments an d rocks, velocity values are also controlled by the degree of consolidation, lithification and fracturing, and the occurrence and abundanc e of free gas and gas hydrates.  

For Expedition 357, $P$ -wave velocity was measured during th e OSP using a Geotek $P$ -wave logger for discrete samples (MSCLDPW; http://www.geotek.co.uk/products/mscl-dpw). The equipment consists of a mechanical section containing a pair of transducers (one transmitter and one receiver), a set of electronics, and  a computer. The samples were placed between the two transducer s for measurement. Acoustic coupling is achieved through solid neoprene surfaces on the transducers and can be improved by applyin g downward pressure on the sample between transducers and/or b y wetting the neoprene with distilled water. A laser distance transducer measures the thickness of the sample. Poorly consolidate d samples are not suitable for measurement with the MSCL-DPW because they tend to crumble when placed between the transducers. For this reason, samples were limited to those taken from roc k cores, with no measurements from the unconsolidated sedimen t core sections.  

The basic velocity equation is  

$$
\nu=d/t,
$$  

where  

$d=$ distance traveled through the material, and $t=$ traveltime of the $P$ -wave through the material.  

The MSCL-DPW was calibrated at the start and end of each se t of samples. Calibration involved measurement of a Delrin sample o f known length and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity $(2.43\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s})$ ), and a measuremen t was also taken with the transducers touching (zero distance). T o monitor measurement drift, the velocity of the calibration piece wa s also noted at the end of each sample run.  

To correct the traveltime, the delay related to the transducer s and electronics and the delay related to the peak detection procedure are subtracted. These delays were determined during calibration with zero distance. For routine measurements on discret e samples with the MSCL-DPW system, the equation for velocity is  

$$
\nu_{\mathrm{core}}=1000\times d_{\mathrm{core}}/(\mathrm{TOT-PTO}),
$$  

where  

$\nu_{\mathrm{core}}=$ velocity through the sample $(\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s})$ ), $d_{\mathrm{core}}=$ measured thickness of the sample (mm), $\mathrm{TOT}=$ measured total traveltime $\left(\upmu\mathrm{s}\right)$ , and $\mathrm{PTO}=$ delay correction (μs).  

A pulse generating an ultrasonic compression wave at ${\approx}230\,\mathrm{kHz}$ is sent to the transmitter, propagates through the sample, and is received by the receiver. The received signal is processed through a n analog-to-digital converter before being displayed. The signal is digitized at a sampling frequency of $12.5\,\mathrm{\:MHz}$ . In the software,  a threshold detector determines the first positive or negative excursion on the received pulse and can be adjusted by the operator a s appropriate. The pulse timing is achieved by measuring the time t o the first zero crossing after the threshold has been exceeded. In thi s way, the traveltime measured is approximately one-half of the wavelength after the start of the pulse but is measured without any error s caused by signal amplitude. A delay, used to define the point a t which the software should start its threshold detection, was set before the start of the signal.  

Sample quality affects the ability to acquire $P$ -wave velocit y data. It was important during Expedition 357 to prepare the sampl e correctly in order to achieve good contact between the transducer s and the samples. Preparation involved cutting cylindrical minicor e samples from the working halves; trimming the ends of the cylinders to ensure there were two flat, parallel surfaces to aid goo d acoustics; and scribing the upcore direction on one end of the cylindrical samples.  

Measurements along the minicore axis $\boldsymbol{x}$ -direction; Figure F21 ) provide information about the horizontal $P$ -wave velocity and ar e given in the data files as $V_{\mathrm{p_{x}}}$ . To obtain vertical $P.$ -wave velocity values, samples were also mounted in the MSCL-DPW with the minicore axis horizontal $\langle z$ -direction) and the upcore direction vertical. These measurements are given in the data files as $V_{\mathrm{p_{z}}}$ . A third measurement was made on the minicores mounted in the MSCL-DP W horizontally $y$ -direction) with the upcore direction horizontal. These measurements are given in the data files as $V_{\mathrm{p_{y}}}.$ All measurements were performed at room temperature. Normally, the most reliable measurement would be that of the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction (horizontal), along the axis of the cylinder where two parallel surfaces should ensure good coupling with the transducer pads. The $y.$ - and $z$ -directio n measurements are perhaps less reliable because of the curved nature of the surfaces in contact with the pads during measurement.  

Data  files  are  in  tab-separated  value  format  (TXT ; http://iodp.pangaea.de) and contain a header with informatio n about the sample followed by the measured data and calculated velocities. The waveform is recorded in two columns containing th e time base and voltage changes.  

# Downhole logging  

Downhole measurements are in situ geophysical measurement s of formation physical properties. These measurements provide  a continuous record and are especially important where core recovery is incomplete. The data sets complement the data acquired fro m the core material recovered, and common measurements can b e used for core-log integration and depth matching. Such data sets include gamma radiation and magnetic susceptibility. Certain downhole  measurements  are  unique,  including  borehole  images. Intermediate in scale to regional geophysics and hand specimen, downhole logging data are important in linking measurements acquired preexpedition for site characterization and measurement s taken on core material recovered during the expedition.  

Six logging probes were taken on Expedition 357 for acquisitio n of in situ measurements via cableless deployment by installatio n through the BHAs of the seabed drills at the end of coring operations. These probes included two magnetic susceptibility sonde s (MSS; both from Antares GMBH, Germany), two dual-inductio n logging probes (DIL; both Antares), and two gamma ray tools (on e

Th e horizontal plane is not oriented relative to a geographic reference, so $X^{-}$ an d $y\cdot$ directions are referenced only to the plane between the archive and working halves.

Antares spectral gamma ray [SGR] tool and one DMT opticalacoustic-gamma [OAG] hybrid tool). Unlike the conventional logging programs utilized on the other IODP platforms and previou s MSP expeditions, logging from a seabed drill involves logging whil e tripping pipe and data acquisition to memory, rather than a realtime data feed. Data output from the tool is therefore data versu s time. Integration of this data file with a depth versus time file fro m the seabed drills facilitates generation of a depth versus data file tha t can be compared effectively with the associated cores and core dat a sets.  

Because of operational limitations encountered during drillin g operations, there was unfortunately no opportunity for open-hol e logging operations during Expedition 357. The operational conditions that prohibited these operations include total hole depth bein g called early as a consequence of stuck pipe (lost BHA means th e pipe is not tripped), core barrels stuck in the BHA (preventing deployment of logging probes through the BHA), loss of operability o f the winch cable (preventing logging tool deployment and/or retrieval), and insufficient hole depth to make logging probe deployment feasible. However, through-pipe gamma measurements wer e acquired at three sites (M0068, M0071, and M0076) during the expedition (Figure F22). These measurements are more familiar i n their design, with the memory tools being deployed via cable fro m the seabed drills to the bottom of the BHA (or just above the stuc k core barrel). Measurements were acquired as the tool was retrieve d to the drill by the winch. Similar to conventional logging, depth control of cabled tools is better with the cable in tension, so the dat a acquired on the uplog rather than the downlog are used. Unlik e wireline logging, the data were recorded to memory rather tha n transmitted in real time. Because these measurements were all acquired through-pipe, data output was limited to total gamma ra y measurement. Attenuation of the gamma signal from the formations encountered by the drill string combined with low formatio n counts make it impossible to resolve the spectral make-up of th e signal.  

# Tool measurement principles  

Although the methods for the logging tools used during this expedition are different from traditional downhole logging operations, the principles of the measurements are the same. Thes e principles are described below in combination with some detail s about the specific tools utilized. A summary of the main logs generated during the project are listed in Table T12. Further informatio n regarding petrophysical measurement principles, tools, and thei r applications is widely available (e.g., Ellis and Singer, 2007; Goldberg, 1997; Lovell et al., 1998; Rider and Kennedy, 2011; Schlumberger, 1989; Serra, 1984, 1986, 1989).  

# Natural gamma radiation  

NGR is a measure of the natural radioactivity of a formation. Such gamma radiation is primarily emitted from rocks as a consequence of the radioactive decay of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ and the decay of isotopes i n the $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ series. During Expedition 357, total gamma ra y measurements were acquired through-pipe utilizing the SGR (spectral measurements only feasible in open hole) tool for MeBo deployments and the OAG (optical and acoustic measurements are no t acquired through-pipe) tool for RD2 deployments.  

The OAG tool employs a $26~\mathrm{\mm}$ NaI scintillation crystal, whereas the SGR uses a slightly larger $37\ \mathrm{mm}$ diameter $250\ \mathrm{mm}$ length) CsI scintillation crystal. Both crystals are paired with a photomultiplier tube that detects pulses of light produced when gamm a rays emitted by a formation strike the scintillation crystals. This results in small electrical currents giving a voltage pulse, the pea k height of which relates to the energy of the gamma emission.

Gamma ray data are conventionally used for depth correlatio n between consecutive tool string runs and individual tool strin g passes. However, the rather unconventional nature of logging fro m a rock drill with individual tools deployed means that the gamm a ray measurement is used purely as a measure of the natural radioactivity of the formations penetrated during the drilling process. Use d in tandem with the corresponding NGR measurements taken o n WRCs ahead of the OSP, these measurements may provide a mean s of repositioning the core material to its original depth within th e borehole.  

The units utilized by the gamma tools are different. OAG measurements are reported in counts per second which are uncalibrated units, and SGR measurements are reported as gamm a

American Petroleum Institute (gAPI) units. gAPI units are industry-standard, calibrated units. Owing to the geometry of the loggin g during Expedition 357, with the measurements acquired throughpipe, it is advised to focus on the profile trends rather than the absolute values of these logs.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

As an operational test, the MSS was deployed cabled, throughpipe on one occasion during Expedition 357. Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of the extent to which a formation is magnetized i n response to an applied magnetic field. The measurement is onl y valid when acquired in open hole with no influence from the dril l string, so the data arising from this operational test are not informative for addressing the scientific questions posed by the project an d the data are therefore not presented.  

# Log data quality  

Borehole condition is the main factor affecting the quality of i n situ measurements. Having an in-gauge borehole that is the diameter of the bit with no washouts or bridges is the ideal situation. Suc h conditions mean that tools can be effectively centralized in th e borehole and that tools are measuring the formation (as opposed t o the borehole fluid). In conventional downhole logging, it is commonplace to assess the borehole condition utilizing a caliper tool o n the initial tool string run. This allows evaluation of the feasibility o f acquiring certain measurements and provides a means by whic h logging data can be quality checked. However, with only single tool s deployed at a time and deployment limited to through-pipe, assessment of borehole condition is reliant on information provided b y the drill teams. Through-pipe deployment means that tool centralization is less of an issue when the hole is near vertical. That said, with no caliper measurement, there is no means of fully appreciating the borehole profile and its impact on the data acquired.  

# Logging data flow and depth scales  

Depth control is a primary concern in all logging operations, regardless of the method. Appreciating the factors affecting depth an d making sensible assumptions about those factors is essential to ensure that the final depth scale generated in tandem with the loggin g data is as good as reasonably possible. When logging from a seabe d drill, depth issues are largely related to time and the accuracy wit h which depth is recorded rather than the ship’s motion and cabl e stretch, which are the primary factors affecting logging from a drillship.  

The factors affecting depth control in cabled logging from a seabed drill, as undertaken during Expedition 357, are as follows:  

• Time drift and time offset across devices (Table T13),   
• Accuracy of winch depth encoder and ability to attain constant haul rate on winch, and   
• Unquantifiable cable slip.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The key objectives of the shipboard paleomagnetic and roc k magnetic work during Expedition 357 were to (1) establish a magnetic susceptibility value at each site based on 15 discrete samples o f known volume and mass, (2) determine the characteristic remanence directions for future use in tectonic studies, and (3) asses s whether the recovered rocks provide an appropriate source of dat a for investigating marine magnetic anomalies. Some background information about the parameters measured and the reason for establishing them is provided below.  

# Fundamental magnetic properties, magnetic susceptibility, and natural remnant magnetization  

Depending on their composition, materials can display one o r more of three fundamental responses to the application of an external magnetic field. The weakest response, which is inherent to all materials, is actually negative (i.e., the field induced in the sampl e has a polarity that opposes that of the applied field). This property i s known as “diamagnetism” and is the only response exhibited, for example, by water, organic compounds, most plastics, and some minerals such as pure quartz and calcite. Collectively, these are calle d “diamagnets.” A stronger, positive linear response (“paramagnetism”) is exhibited by minerals that are “paramagnetic,” and mineral examples include many members of the iron oxide phase syste m (e.g., lepidocrocite), the iron sulfide phase system (e.g., pyrite an d marcasite), ferromagnesian minerals (e.g., biotite and pyroxene), and iron carbonates (e.g., siderite). Pure iron is “ferromagnetic,” an d ferromagnetism is the strongest type of positive response to an applied magnetic field. Similar ionic ordering gives rise to “ferrimagnetism”  and  “antiferromagnetism,”  which  are  important  t o paleomagnetism because of the capability of “ferromagnets” (e.g., pure iron) and “ferrimagnets” and “canted antiferromagnets” to retain a memory of a magnetic field that they were once exposed to. This memory is called “magnetic remanence.” Natural minerals tha t behave as “ferrimagnets” at temperatures and pressures normall y experienced close to the Earth’s surface include magnetite, titanomagnetite, maghemite, monoclinic pyrrhotite, and greigite.  

Magnetic susceptibility is a parameter that defines how easily  a material can be magnetized. Geologists routinely measure this parameter at room temperature and pressure, although temperaturedependent measurements may detect changes in crystallographi c structure, which causes magnetic transitions and can be diagnosti c of specific minerals (e.g., the Verwey transition in magnetite). Magnetic susceptibility is a dimensionless ratio between the intensity o f magnetization $(M)$ induced in a sample by an externally applie d field $(H)$ of known intensity (i.e., $M/H)$ ; this ratio can span many orders of magnitude, both positive and negative. If magnetic susceptibility  is  expressed  on  a  volumetric  basis,  volume  magneti c susceptibility (k) is obtained. Magnetic susceptibility may also b e expressed per unit mass $(\upchi)$ , and the SI units are cubic meters pe r kilogram $(\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{kg})$ .  

Mineral ferrimagnets have susceptibilities that are many order s of magnitude higher than paramagnets and diamagnets. Thus, eve n if naturally occurring ferrimagnetic minerals account for only a fe w parts per thousand of a sample, they dominate the magnetic susceptibility and determine its ability to acquire and carry a natural remnant  magnetization  (NRM).  In  natural  sediments,  NRM  i s commonly acquired in two fundamental ways. The first is throug h acquisition  of  a  (post-)depositional  remnant  magnetizatio n (pDRM). pDRMs require that when mineral grains fall out of a cal m fluid suspension, the Earth’s ambient magnetic field exerts a torqu e on them, and they align with the field. They are subsequently burie d by nonmagnetic particles and are locked into position close to o r just below the sediment/water interface at a depth dependent on th e degree of consolidation and bioturbation. pDRMs are frequentl y carried by primary ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic iron oxide s that originate from continental erosion. A second way is throug h precipitation of secondary authigenic and diagenetic minerals tha t are capable of acquiring magnetic remanence when the crystal s grow and pass through the superparamagnetic to single-domai n grain size threshold. This threshold is mineral specific but is ofte n exceeded in the submicrometer grain size window.  

The other mechanism of magnetization of rocks (e.g., magmas ) is called thermoremnent magnetization and is defined as the magnetization an igneous rock acquires as the temperature of magma o r lava from which it forms falls below the Curie point (i.e., magnetit e $=580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , hematite $=675^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and ilmenite $=-233^{\circ}-$ ) and during th e cooling and solidification process. The thermoremnent magnetization bears the signature of the magnetic field (usually Earth’s magnetic field) in which the rock is located as it forms.  

The main oxide phases found in rocks acquired during Expedition 357 are magnetite and ilmenite, rutile, titanite, secondary magnetite from serpentinization of olivine in most olivine-bearin g rocks, and primary and secondary sulfides.  

# Paleomagnetic sampling and measurements  

To achieve the expedition objectives, shipboard samples fo r magnetic susceptibility and measurement of NRM direction an d strength  were  obtained  using  discrete standard  IODP  paleomagnetic cylindrical cores (external dimensions of $2.54\,\mathrm{cm}\times2.2\,\mathrm{cm}$ and a volume of $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) taken from the working halves of the recovered cores. Fifteen discrete samples were taken from sections tha t contributed to the overall magnetostratigraphy for each site wit h small adjustments made for voids and rock disturbances. Sample s within each core section were oriented with respect to each other, and samples were marked with an arrow pointing up, indicating th e direction of the top of the core. The shipboard sampling schem e was aligned with subsections of cores where the majority of shipboard and postexpedition samples were taken to better inform late r research and quantify the overall lithologies recovered.  

# Magnetic susceptibility measurements  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured using a KLY 2(AGICO ) Kappabridge that operates at a frequency of $920\,\mathrm{Hz}$ and a magneti c induction of $0.4\;\mathrm{mT}$ (equivalent to a field intensity of $300\,\mathrm{A/m})$ wit h a noise level of $2\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{kg}$ . The Kappabridge was calibrated using a standard with a bulk susceptibility of $1165\times10^{-6}\;\mathrm{S}$ I, and thi s procedure was repeated every morning before measurements began. Measurements of the 15 specimens were then corrected according to the respective averages. Volumetric samples and masse s were used to make an additional estimate of bulk density that coul d be cross-checked with the continuous MSCL data.  

# NRM measurements and alternating field demagnetization  

The NRM direction and intensity of the 15 discrete sample s were measured using the 2G-Enterprises horizontal pass-throug h superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM 755–4000) that wa s made available for the OSP by the University of Bremen (Germany). The standard IODP samples (i.e., cylinder cores) taken during th e OSP were measured in batches of approximately eight using th e pass-through conveyor sample holder belt.  

A series of 15 pilot samples was selected from all sites to cove r the full range of magnetic remanence. After NRM was measured, the samples were sequentially demagnetized by alternating fields a t the following steps: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The magnetic remanence was measured between each step. Orthogonal plots and visualization of the demagnetization spectr a were produced in Zijderveld vector diagrams, and normalized magnetic moments and directions were plotted on stereographic diagrams.
