# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 363 sough t to document the regional expression and driving mechanisms of climate variability (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and productivity ) in the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) as it relates to the evolution of Neogene climate on millennial, orbital, and geologica l timescales. To achieve our objectives, we selected sites with wid e geographical distribution and variable oceanographic and depositional settings. Nine sites were cored during Expedition 363, recovering a total of $6956~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment in $875{-}3421\ \mathrm{m}$ water dept h with an average recovery of $101.3\%$ during 39.6 days of on-site operations. Two sites are located off northwestern Australia at th e southern extent of the WPWP and span the late Miocene to present. Seven sites are situated at the heart of the WPWP, includin g two sites on the northern margin of Papua New Guinea (PNG) wit h very high sedimentation rates spanning the past ${\sim}450~\mathrm{ky},$ two site s in the Manus Basin north of PNG with moderate sedimentatio n rates recovering upper Pliocene to present sequences, and three lo w sedimentation rate sites on the southern and northern parts of th e Eauripik Rise spanning the early Miocene to present. The wide spatial distribution of the cores, variable accumulation rates, exceptional biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic age constraints, an d mostly excellent foraminifer preservation will allow us to trace th e evolution of the WPWP through the Neogene at different tempora l resolutions, meeting the primary objectives of Expedition 363. Specifically, the high sedimentation–rate cores off PNG will allow us t o better constrain mechanisms influencing millennial-scale variability in the WPWP, their links to high-latitude climate variability, an d implications for temperature and precipitation variations in this region under variable climate conditions. Furthermore, these high accumulation rates offer the opportunity to study climate variabilit y during previous warm periods at a resolution similar to existin g studies of the Holocene. With excellent recovery, Expedition 36 3 sites are suitable for detailed paleoceanographic reconstructions a t orbital and suborbital resolution from the middle Miocene to Pleistocene, and thus will be used to refine the astronomical tuning, magneto-, isotope, and biostratigraphy of hitherto poorly constrained intervals within the Neogene timescale (e.g., the late Miocene)  and to reconstruct the history of  the East Asian  an d Australian monsoon and the Indonesian Throughflow on orbita l and tectonic timescales. Results from high-resolution interstitia l water sampling at selected sites will be used to reconstruct densit y profiles of the western equatorial Pacific deep water during the Las t Glacial Maximum. Additional geochemical analyses of interstitia l water samples in this tectonically active region will be used to investigate volcanogenic mineral and carbonate weathering and thei r possible implications for the evolution of Neogene climate.  

# Introduction  

The Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP), often defined by th e $28^{\circ}C$ isotherm, is part of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP), whic h spans the western waters of the equatorial Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean (Figure F1). The region is a major source of heat an d moisture to the atmosphere and a location of deep atmospheri c convection and heavy rainfall. Small perturbations in the sea-surface temperature (SST) of the WPWP influence the location an d strength of convection in the rising limb of the Hadley and Walke r cells,  affecting  planetary-scale  atmospheric  circulation,  atmospheric heating, and tropical hydrology (Neale and Slingo, 2003;  

Wang and Mehta, 2008). These perturbations may also influenc e heat uptake and storage in the WPWP thermocline and heat transport to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Throughflo w (ITF). These processes also constitute important feedbacks in th e climate system due to their influence on the dynamic ocean-atmosphere coupling in the equatorial Pacific, thereby exerting a stron g influence on global temperatures and atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ . Detaile d paleoceanographic records, such as those recovered during Expedition 363, offer the opportunity to study the behavior of the WPW P under different mean-state background conditions and its effects o n both regional and global climate.  

Seasonal to interannual climate variations in the WPWP ar e dominated by fluctuations in precipitation associated with the seasonal march of the monsoons, migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and interannual changes associated wit h variability  of the  El  Niño Southern  Oscillation  (ENSO)  (e.g., Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; Halpert and Ropelewski, 1992; Rasmusson and Arkin, 1993) (Figure F2). At present, departures fro m expected weather patterns associated with the monsoons an d ENSO systems impact the lives of many people in the tropics an d many regions around the world. For example, El Niño events are associated with a nearly global fingerprint of temperature and precipitation anomalies (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; Rasmusson an d Arkin, 1993; Cane and Clement, 1999). However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the response of the tropical Pacific climate,  primarily  precipitation,  to  rising  greenhouse  ga s concentrations because of our limited understanding of the pas t variability of the WPWP and conflicting results from data compared to models. For example, models simulating the response o f the equatorial Pacific to greenhouse gas forcing disagree abou t whether the zonal temperature gradient will increase or decreas e and what the implications will be for the Walker circulation and th e hydrologic cycle in the tropics (Forster et al., 2007). These simulations typically use an ENSO analogy to predict future climate; in  a similar way to interannual ENSO variability, long-term changes i n the mean climate state of the equatorial Pacific are often evaluate d primarily as changes in the east–west SST gradient. However, recent simulations of global warming effects suggest that the tropical Pacific does not become more El Niño- or La Niña-like in respons e to increased greenhouse gases (DiNezio et al., 2009). Instead, th e new simulations suggest a different equilibrium state, whereb y shoaling and increased tilt of the equatorial Pacific thermocline i s associated with weakening of the trade winds without a concomitant change in the zonal SST pattern, which argues against usin g ENSO as an analog for long-term changes in tropical condition s (DiNezio et al., 2010). In turn, changes in the structure of the thermocline can have a major effect on the ocean heat content, and thu s global climate, and also on the character of ENSO variability, whic h has been documented for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (For d et al., 2015). Changes in thermocline temperature/structure hav e also been suggested as a possible mechanism responsible for th e slowdown in surface warming from $\mathord{\sim}2000$ to 2014 (e.g., England e t al., 2014).  

A primary goal of this expedition was to assess the regional expression of climate variability (e.g., precipitation, temperature, $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2},$ and biological productivity) within the WPWP in the contex t of changes in global background state from the middle Miocene t o late Pleistocene. Drill sites were chosen to provide broad spatial coverage to capture the most salient features of the WPWP (Figure s F1, F3) at different temporal resolutions through this time interval (Figure F4). With variable water depths, the sites intersect differen t water masses, including the North Pacific Intermediate Wate r (NPIW), Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), Upper Circumpolar  Deepwater (UCDW), and Lower Circumpolar  Deepwate r (LCDW) (Figure F5) and thus will allow reconstruction of intermediate and deepwater properties at relatively high resolution throug h time.  

# Oceanographic settings  

The warmest region of the IPWP is the WPWP region east o f Indonesia where mean annual SSTs are typically ${\tt>}29^{\circ}{\cal C}$ (Figure F1). As the warmest water body on the planet, the IPWP and in particular the WPWP are known to be influential to the dynamics of ENS O and the Asian-Australian monsoon. Throughout the IPWP, war m water fuels atmospheric convection and heavy rainfall with a net $1-$ $2\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{y}$ of freshwater input to the ocean. Indeed the biggest seasona l changes in surface hydrography are expressed in salinity with freshening derived by changes in precipitation due to the seasonal marc h of the ITCZ and the Asian-Australian monsoon. On interannua l timescales, ENSO exerts the strongest influence on regional precipitation and consequently surface salinity. The size of the warm poo l also changes seasonally as the core of the WPWP follows the ITC Z migration. As a result, the size of the WPWP is smaller (larger) an d SST is cooler north (south) of the Equator during boreal winte r (summer) (Figure F2).  

The western equatorial Pacific is also a crossroad for thermocline and intermediate waters originating at the high latitudes o f both hemispheres (Fine, 1994). Because of its complex network o f passages and basins, the Indonesian maritime continent on th e western edge of the WPWP exerts the strongest control on th e communication between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. As part o f the global circulation, the ITF is the only equatorial interocean connection transferring heat and freshwater from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean and ultimately to the Atlantic Ocean through th e Agulhas Current and thus may have far-reaching effects on climat e (Figure F6). The ITF is driven by the average difference in sea leve l between the Pacific and Indian Oceans $(\sim\!16~\mathrm{cm})$ . Most of the IT F transport resides in the upper $750\;\mathrm{m}$ of the water column, with th e maximum volume transport between 150 and $400\mathrm{~m~}$ (Fieux et al., 1994; Ffield et al., 2000; Gordon et al., 2003; Susanto and Gordon, 2005). On average, the ITF transports a large amount of water $(10-$ $15\,\mathrm{Sv},$ , where $1\;\mathrm{Sv}=1,000,000\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s})$ and heat $\langle{\sim}0.5\;\mathrm{PW},$ , where 1 P W $=10^{15}$ W) from the WPWP north of the Equator to $12^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ in the Indian Ocean. Approximately $80\%$ of the total ITF moves through th e Makassar Strait (Figure F3). Of this, $25\%$ flows through the Lombo k Strait and $75\%$ flows into the Banda Sea and then into the India n Ocean through the Timor Strait (Fieux et al., 1994; Gordon an d Fine, 1996; Gordon and Susanto, 1999). Water in the upper WPW P thermocline represents a mixture of North Pacific and South Pacifi c subtropical waters (NPSW and SPSW, respectively). The main thermocline, between $\mathord{\sim}200$ and $500\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , receives contributions from th e low-salinity, low-oxygen North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW; salinity 34.45; density $26.5{-}26.8\,\upsigma_{\uptheta})$ ) advected through the Mindana o Current and from the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU ) transporting oxygen-rich AAIW (salinity ${\sim}34.55$ ; density 27.2–27. 3 $\upsigma_{\uptheta})$ ). The deepest sites $>\!3000\;\mathrm{m}$ below sea level [mbsl]) are bathe d by LCDW. The relative contributions of these water masses at eac h of our drilling sites vary depending on their location.  

# Motivation for drilling the WPWP  

Studies of climate variability in the WPWP have relied primaril y on the low sedimentation–rate $({\sim}2{-}3\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the Pleistocene ) Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 806B from the Ontong Jav a Plateau (OJP) (Kroenke, Berger, Janecek, et al., 1991), which serve s as a warm end-member to monitor broad-scale zonal and meridional gradients through the Neogene. However, higher resolutio n sites are currently unavailable from this region, preventing direc t comparison with suborbital variability known from high-latitud e sites. Over the past decade new coring efforts have demonstrate d the possibility of obtaining records from key locations in th e WPWP with comparable resolution to records from high-latitud e oceans, cave deposits, and ice cores (e.g., Stott et al., 2002; Zuraid a et  al.,  2009).  Although  substantial  progress  in  understandin g WPWP climate variability has been made by studying long pisto n cores, the newly cored sites of Expedition 363 will address fundamental questions across a broader spatial distribution and with enhanced temporal resolution. Expedition 363 cored sites of variabl e accumulation rates from the following three sectors of the WPWP:  

1. The southern sector of the WPWP: Sites U1482 and U1483 are located seaward of the continental slope of northwest Australia at the southwestern edge of the WPWP and along the exit of the ITF to the Indian Ocean. The cores from these sites recovered upper Miocene to recent sediment.   
2. The central sector of the WPWP: high accumulation rate Sites U1484 and U1485 on the northern margin of Papua New Guinea close to the Sepik River mouth and Sites U1486 and U1487 in the Manus Basin span the upper Pliocene to recent.   
3. The northern sector of the WPWP: cores at Sites U1488 and U1489 at the southern end of the Eauripik Rise and Site U1490 at its northern end recovered low sedimentation–rate sequences spanning the upper Oligocene/lower Miocene to recent.  

These sites will allow us to address the following researc h themes.  

# Investigating millennial-scale climate variability in the WPWP  

The origin of sub-Milankovitch climate variability and its spatia l and temporal extent are significantly less understood than mechanisms related to orbital climate forcing. Most hypotheses attribut e millennial-scale changes during the last glacial interval to either instabilities in the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (e.g., MacAyeal, 1993) or a response to variations in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g., Rahmstorf, 2002) driven by meltwater input s to the North Atlantic (e.g., Clark et al., 2001, 2004). Much of the evidence for millennial-scale climate variability comes from the Nort h Atlantic and from regions directly affected by that variability. Thes e records suggest a strong link to ice sheet instability primarily durin g glacial intervals. In low-latitude and tropical regions, millennialscale variability is mainly expressed as changes in precipitation. Paleoprecipitation records suggest a southward shift in the ITCZ position apparently synchronous with North Atlantic cold event s including the Younger Dryas, Heinrich Event 1, and marine isotop e Stage (MIS) 3 stadials (Stott et al., 2002, 2004; Oppo et al., 2003; Dannenmann et al., 2003; Gibbons et al., 2014). These results ar e consistent with models that suggest climate conditions at high latitudes influence the position of the ITCZ (Broccoli et al., 2006; Chiang and Bitz, 2005). The global extent and apparent synchroneity o f millennial-scale variability have been attributed to fast transmissio n of climate signals through the atmosphere in response to North Atlantic climate change (Schmittner et al., 2003; Gibbons et al., 2014). However, other studies suggest that orbital insolation changes affec t tropical dynamics, possibly related to the response of monsoon an d ENSO variability to changes in the mean climate state of the equatorial Pacific Ocean (Clement et al., 2001; Koutavas et al., 2002, 2006; Stott et al., 2002). Accordingly, changes in the distribution of tropical Pacific SST may have large impacts on global temperature s (Clement et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2015) and low- to mid-latitud e heat and moisture transport, which can amplify small radiative perturbations (Tachikawa et al., 2013).  

As a major source of heat and moisture, the WPWP may hav e played an important role in millennial-scale variability throug h changes in its spatial extent and/or its SST and consequently on th e air-sea heat and moisture exchange. Obtaining long records fro m the WPWP with comparable resolution to the Greenland ice cores, Chinese speleothems, and high-resolution sediment cores fro m other regions will provide insight into the mechanisms driving centennial- to millennial-scale climate variability in the context o f changes in background climate states.  

# Reconstructing orbital-scale climate variability through the Neogene  

Significant glacial–interglacial variability characterizes SST reconstructions from the WPWP with the glacial–interglacial temperature amplitude increasing from ${\sim}2^{\circ}C$ in the Pliocene to $3^{\circ}C$ i n the Pleistocene (de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2005; Medina-Elizald e and Lea, 2005, 2010). These changes are also associated wit h changes in surface-water $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{seawater}},$ , suggesting concomitant hydroclimate changes. Because the tropical Pacific is located far from th e polar ice sheets, studies have suggested that the glacial–interglacia l variability of tropical Pacific SST is mostly driven by changes in atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ (e.g., Lea, 2004; Hansen et al., 2008) and to a lesse r extent by changes in local insolation (e.g., Tachikawa et al., 2013). I n addition, there may also be strong extratropical controls of WPW P temperatures due to ocean dynamical processes. For example, th e presence of significant obliquity variability in SST records from th e WPWP throughout the past ${\sim}2$ My attests to strong linkages wit h high-latitude climate variability (de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2005 ) likely transported through the thermocline. The causes and exten t of past precipitation changes in the WPWP are not well constraine d in terms of the relative importance of changes in boundary conditions in the equatorial Pacific compared to the high latitudes, thei r relationship to equatorial dynamics and the position of the ITCZ, and their associated climate system feedbacks (Figure F2).  

Lithologic proxy records of precipitation from the wester n equatorial Pacific suggest that precession-driven interhemispheri c changes in local insolation exert the strongest control on equatoria l Pacific hydroclimate, primarily associated with the migration of th e ITCZ (Kissel et al., 2010; Tachikawa et al., 2011) and possibly modulated by ENSO-type processes (Dang et al., 2015). Noteworthy i s that these precipitation records show no glacial–interglacial cyclicity and no clear causal linkage to the climate of the North Atlanti c (e.g., Kissel et al., 2010; Tachikawa et al., 2011; Carolin et al., 2013). Instead, recent studies suggest that southward displacement of th e ITCZ during deglaciations may have played an important role in th e inception of glacial terminations through its influence on the position of the southwesterly winds as the two wind systems are linked.  

A southward shift of the southern westerly jet led to increased upwelling of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -rich deep water around Antarctica, which in tur n enhanced the deglaciation (Denton et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2009). Modeling studies, supported by new records, confirm th e idea of “interhemispheric teleconnection,” whereby warming (cooling) of the Northern Hemisphere causes both the ITCZ and th e Southern Hemispheric mid-latitude jet to shift northward (southward) (Lee et al., 2011; Ayliffe et al., 2013; Ceppi et al., 2013). Investigating these interconnections and their evolution under differen t background climate states throughout the Neogene is one of th e overarching goals of this expedition.  

On million-year timescales, the relationships between differen t equilibrium states of the tropical Pacific and changes in the Equator-to-pole temperature gradient have likely affected ocean circulation and thus the global climate evolution from the middle Miocen e through the late Pleistocene. Specifically, long-term Cenozoic cooling was interrupted by periods of relative global warmth during th e Middle Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO; ${\sim}17{-}15\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and th e early Pliocene warm period $(4.5{-}3\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Zachos et al., 2001). Th e period since the MMCO interval is of special interest due to a perceived decoupling between global SSTs and variations in atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ (e.g., LaRiviere et al., 2012). The early Pliocene war m period is of particular interest, as global surface temperatures wer e ${\sim}2^{\circ}{-}3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ higher than at present (Dowsett et al., 2009), which is comparable with projections for the twenty-first century, whereas atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was arguably similar to today’s levels $({\sim}400~\mathrm{ppm})$ (Kürschner et al., 1996; Pagani et al., 2010). Studies suggest that thi s period was characterized by a reduced Pacific zonal temperatur e gradient due to substantial warming of eastern equatorial Pacifi c SST (e.g., Wara et al., 2005). However, the spatial extent and magnitude of SST change in the WPWP and their implications for tropical precipitation are debated (Brierley et al., 2009; Fedorov et al., 2010; Zhang et al., $2014;$ Ravelo et al., 2014), and new records from thi s expedition should contribute to this discussion.  

The MMCO was also characterized by a warm and humid climate (Mosbrugger et al., 2005; Bruch et al., 2007), with some evidence for even weaker meridional temperature gradients (Flowe r and Kennett, 1994; Bruch et al., 2007; Holbourn et al., 2010) than i n the Pliocene, although there are very few data, particularly from th e WPWP, to help constrain global temperature gradients. After th e MMCO, climate cooled gradually through the late Miocene in man y regions but was still warmer than today. It is currently debate d whether the WPWP temperature was, on average, similar to toda y through the late Miocene (Nathan and Leckie, 2009) or significantl y warmer (Zhang et al., 2014). The climate mechanisms that explai n past warmth during the MMCO, the late Miocene, and the earl y Pliocene are not yet fully understood, but greenhouse gas forcin g and ocean circulation are considered to be important factors. Recent data suggest that $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was higher than today during th e MMCO (Kürschner et al., 2008; Retallack, 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; Greenop et al., 2014) and in the early Pliocene warm period (Pagan i et al., 2010; Seki et al., 2010). However, reconstructions sugges t $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was relatively low in the late Miocene, similar to levels durin g the Pleistocene, even though climate was relatively warm an d Northern Hemisphere ice sheets were only starting to develop. A t face value, this indicates that for a given $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ forcing more tha n one climate state (i.e., late Miocene warmth and late Pleistocene glaciation) is possible. Thus, factors other than $p C O_{2},$ such as ocea n circulation possibly related to tectonic opening or closure of oceanic gateways (Cane and Molnar, 2001; Steph et al., 2010) or different modes of deepwater production and circulation (Woodard e t al., 2014), may have played a critical role in determining global climate. In particular, tectonic changes affecting the transport of wate r from the western Pacific to the Indian Ocean is one mechanis m proposed to explain changes in global climate (Cane and Molnar, 2001).  

# Reconstructing changes in the ITF through the Neogene  

Hydrographic measurements indicate that nearly all of the IT F water in the Makassar Strait derives from the relatively cool NPI W and NPSW (Gordon and Fine, 1996; Gordon and Susanto, 1999). A t present, the contribution of denser South Pacific water from th e New Guinea Coastal Current to the ITF is limited because of th e proximity of West Papua to the Equator (Gordon and Fine, 1996; Hautala et al., 1996; Johnson and McPhaden, 1999; Cane and Molnar, 2001). On longer timescales, the strongest controls on the properties and strength of the ITF are likely sea level changes leading t o the exposure and flooding of the Sunda shelf (Xu et al., 2008; Linsle y et al., 2010) and tectonic closure of the Indonesian seaways (Can e and Molnar, 2001; Kuhnt et al., 2004). Reconstructing the thermocline structure at sites located in the heart of the WPWP and of f northwest Australia, near the exit of the ITF into the Indian Ocean, will offer the opportunity to study changes in ITF transport in response to tectonic and climate changes through the late Neogene t o present. Using new high sedimentation–rate cores will allow us no t only to study long-term changes in ITF transport (e.g., Karas et al., 2009, 2011) but also to assess the long-term variability of the ITF a t orbital and suborbital timescales.  

# Assessing the density structure of the western equatorial Pacific during the LGM  

The spatial pattern of temperature and salinity in the ocean represents the distribution of different water masses and is used to infer deep-ocean circulation. It would be ideal to use the sam e approach to reconstruct ocean circulation in the past, but we ar e currently limited by the availability of proxies with sufficient accuracy to reconstruct temperature and salinity variability in the past. Specifically, benthic foraminiferal $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records cannot unequivocally be interpreted in terms of changes in ice volume, temperature, and salinity, as they all affect the isotopic composition of the foraminifer tests. For the LGM we can resolve this uncertainty by usin g the approach developed for reconstructing the chlorinity (as a measure of salinity) and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of seawater from interstitial water profile s of deep-ocean sediment (Adkins et al., 2002; Schrag and DePaolo, 1993; Schrag et al., 1996).  

The LGM left the ocean on average ${\sim}3.5\%$ enriched in salt an d ${\sim}1.0\%_{00}$ enriched in $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ from the growth of land-based ice sheets. However,  these  enrichments  vary  locally,  depending  on  pas t changes in circulation and properties of the water masses. Usin g high-precision $\left[{{\bf{C}}{\bf{l}}-}\right]$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ measurements of the interstitial flui d profiles downhole to $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ below seafloor (mbsf) and applying  a 1-D advection/diffusion equation, the amplitude of the seawater salinity and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ change can be estimated, and when combined wit h foraminifer $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{calcite}},$ can be used to estimate the temperature an d density of the LGM ocean. Previous studies show that whereas mos t of the LGM deep ocean was at or near freezing, there was a large r range in salinity than there is in the modern ocean (Adkins et al., 2002). Specifically, the available interstitial water data suggest tha t the LGM density gradient along the Atlantic Ocean was very different from today, with the saltiest water forming around Antarctic a during the LGM as opposed to around Greenland in the moder n ocean (Adkins et al., 2002). The overall picture is one of a salinitystratified ocean with different water mass geometries. Enhance d vertical stratification at the LGM would have had significant implications for the carbon budget of the ocean and $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ of the atmosphere at that time (Broecker and Barker, 2007). However, most o f the presently available data come from the Atlantic Ocean, and t o date there is only one record from the southern Pacific Ocean (OD P Site 1123; Adkins et al., 2002).  

# Using interstitial water profiles to reconstruct diagenetic processes and their implications for seawater composition  

The study of uranium and sulfur interstitial water chemistry wil l be important for evaluating diagenetic processes at the sites targeted by Expedition 363 with significant implications for our understanding of the proxy data generated with expedition samples and o f the Earth system as a whole. The $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ ratios of interstitial wate r have been demonstrated to be a sensitive indicator of the amount o f silicate dissolution and calcite recrystallization in deep-marine sediment over submillion-year timescales (Maher et al., 2004). Furthermore, the $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ ratio of the globally integrated U flux fro m interstitial water to seawater is poorly known. ${^{234}\mathrm{U}}/{^{238}\mathrm{U}}$ measurements on interstitial water collected from the range of depositional environments sampled by Expedition 363 will provide an importan t indicator of the diagenetic alteration of carbonates and will plac e constraints on the global composition of the U outflux from marin e sediment. Such data will be important for evaluating the robustnes s of carbonate-based environmental proxies generated by Expeditio n 363 postcruise research. These data will also provide insight regarding the influence of marine diagenesis on the global $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ budget. A better understanding of this  budget should allow fo r improvement in the U-series dating calibration used in many records of Pleistocene oceanographic changes (e.g., Hines et al., 2015 ) and in our knowledge of changes in the amount of chemical weathering across glacial–interglacial timescales (e.g., Chen et al., 2016).  

The diagenesis of S and associated isotopic mass balance model s of the ocean play an important role in our understanding of the progressive oxygenation of Earth’s surface on geologic timescales and o f the relative burial fluxes of oxidized and reduced sulfur species i n modern marine sediment. Although ample studies (e.g., Jørgensen, 1977; Lyons et al., 2004) have documented S diagenesis throug h measurements of the S isotopic composition of pyrite and aqueou s S species in shallow-shelf sediment, our knowledge of the S isotopi c composition of pyrite buried in deep-sea sediment under generall y oxic water columns is lacking. Expedition 363 presents an excellen t opportunity to study S diagenesis through aqueous and solid phas e $\delta^{34}\mathrm{S}$ measurements in relatively deep ocean sites across a range o f water depths $(875{-}3421~\mathrm{~mbsl)}$ , sedimentation rates, and terrigenous sediment fluxes, all of which may potentially influence S diagenetic  processes.  High  sedimentation  rates  through  th e Pleistocene at several sites (e.g., Sites U1484 and U1485) should als o allow exploration of the potential for glacial–interglacial variabilit y in pyrite $\delta^{34}\mathrm{S}$ related to these influences. Additional measurement s of interstitial water samples, including B, Li, Mg, Ca, Si, and Sr elemental concentrations and their isotopic ratios, will be used t o study processes related to $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ diagenesis and in situ weatherin g of silicate minerals in the sediment and the implications for change s in seawater composition during the Neogene.  

# Specific scientific objectives  

The objectives of Expedition 363 include the following:  

• Determine the spatial extent of sea-surface and thermocline temperature variability in the WPWP under different climate background states in relation to changes in radiative forcings ( $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and insolation) to better constrain climate sensitivity throughout the Neogene.

# Site summaries  

Site U1482  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1482 (proposed Site WP-12D) is located on the northwes t Australian margin at $15^{\circ}3.32^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $120^{\circ}26.10\mathrm{\,E}$ and 1466 mbsl (Figur e F7).  The  site  is  situated  at  Shotpoint  440  on  seismic  Lin e HBR2000A-3032, ${\sim}581\mathrm{~m~}$ northwest of the cross-point of seismi c Lines HBR2000A-3032 and BR98-84. The top of the first prominen t reflector, originally interpreted as the middle Miocene sequenc e boundary (Mi-3; $13.8\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ), is $_{0.55\,\mathrm{~s~}}$ two-way traveltime (TWT) below the seafloor, equivalent to $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Site U1482 is on the Scott Plateau, which corresponds to a subside d platform area that forms the northwestern flank of the northeasttrending Browse Basin (Keep et al., 2007). This region, which is adjacent to some of the oldest ocean crust still in the world’s ocea n (Argo Abyssal Plain), has remained a stable passive margin since th e breakup of Gondwanaland and the separation of northwest Australia from the Tethyan landmass (Gradstein et al., 1992). As a result o f the northward movement of the Australian plate, continuous Neogene deformation along the normal faults that bound the Scott Plateau led to the amplification of relief between the Browse Basin an d Scott Plateau and may have resulted in some of the downslope sediment transport seen in the seismic profiles (Keep et al., 2007) an d sediment deformation in the cores recovered at this site.  

The Mesozoic section beneath the Scott Plateau is strongly influenced by breakup-related tectonics, which forms the acousti c basement through much of the Scott Plateau area (Stagg and Exon, 1981). The postbreakup sedimentary succession forms an ${\sim}2000\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, relatively uniform blanket over the Scott Plateau and th e northeastern margin of Browse Basin. The extended Miocene to recent sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1482 provides a n ideal archive to reconstruct the climate and circulation history a t the southwestern edge of the IPWP at higher resolution than available at the nearby deep-sea ODP sites (e.g., Site 761 on the Womba t Plateau; Holbourn et al., 2004) (Figure F3).  

The location of Site U1482 is within the prominent hydrographic front separating tropical and subtropical water masses, which makes it suitable to monitor changes in the southward exten t of tropical warm water related either to circulation or global climat e trends. The site is situated close to the oceanographic front betwee n relatively cool, nutrient-rich water carried northward in the Easter n Indian Ocean by the West Australian Current and warm, oligotrophic Leeuwin Current waters, which results in a steep north–sout h SST gradient (Figure F1). This strategic location will allow reconstruction of the southwestern extent of the IPWP and monitoring o f the ITF outflow into the Indian Ocean since the early late Miocene.  

The extended sediment archive recovered at Site U1482 will enable reconstruction of climate variability on orbital timescales ove r the past ${\sim}10~\mathrm{My},$ which will complement high-resolution record s from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Southern Oceans and will be crucial for constraining regional and global circulation modes and Miocen e ice-volume variations. The new Pliocene record from Site U1482 i s also ideally suited to test the hypothesis of a major restriction o f warm-water throughflow originating from the South Pacific Ocea n between 3 and 5 Ma caused by the northward movement of PNG, which may have been a key factor in the aridification of East Afric a and hominid evolution (Cane and Molnar, 2001).  

# Operations  

After a $1514\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Singapore, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1482 at $1524\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local; $\mathrm{UTC}+8\,\mathrm{h}$ ) on $16\,\mathrm{Oc}.$ - tober 2016. We cored four holes at Site U1482 (Table T1). The original operations plan called for three holes: the first to advance d piston corer (APC) refusal, followed by two APC holes with extended core barrel (XCB) coring to 490 mbsf (our approved depth o f penetration for the site). The plan was modified to core to total depth $(490~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) in the first hole to determine the operations pla n for the remaining holes.  

We reached APC refusal at ${\sim}345$ mbsf in Hole U1482A. W e opted to deepen the hole with the half-length advanced piston core r (HLAPC), which reached 380 mbsf before hitting refusal. We the n switched to the XCB system to core to the total approved depth o f 490 mbsf. Hole U1482B was cored to 343.6 mbsf with the APC an d then to 366.6 mbsf using the HLAPC. This hole included five intervals drilled without coring to avoid core gap alignment for stratigraphic correlation. Because the age of the sediment at the botto m of Hole U1482A was several million years younger than anticipated, we requested and received permission to core deeper at the site. Hole U1482C was cored to 335.4 mbsf with the APC and then t o 534.1 mbsf with the XCB. We opted to terminate drilling at tha t depth due to deteriorating calcareous microfossil preservation below 500 mbsf and the increasing length of time to cut cores.  

After conditioning the hole for logging, we conducted tw o downhole logging runs using the triple combo and Formatio n MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic logging strings in Hole U1482C. Th e triple combo logging string reached the bottom of the hole at 533. 4 m wireline depth below seafloor (WSF). The FMS-sonic loggin g string encountered a slurry of fine-grained fill and reached only t o $517\,\textrm{m}$ WSF. Two upward passes were conducted with the FMSsonic logging string. Following logging, we opted to core Hol e U1482D to target three core gaps in the stratigraphic section. W e took one core at the seafloor to establish the seafloor depth befor e drilling ahead to 137.0 mbsf. We then took eight APC cores to 213. 0 mbsf, successfully covering the targeted core gaps. We then terminated the hole, ending operations at Site U1482 at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on $25\,\mathrm{Oc}-$ tober. Total time spent at Site U1482 was $218.5\,\mathrm{h}$ (9.1 days).  

A total of 163 cores were collected at this site. The APC corin g system was deployed 115 times, collecting $1128.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t over $1077.3\,\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $.104.7\%$ recovery). The HLAPC corin g system was deployed 13 times, recovering $57.01\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ove r $55.3\textrm{m}$ of penetration $103.1\%$ recovery). The XCB coring syste m was deployed 35 times, collecting $305.32\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $304\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $.100.4\%$ recovery). Total recovery for Site U1482 wa s $1490.33\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $1436.6\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(103.7\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

The sediment cored at Site U1482 is assigned to a single lithologic unit composed of ${\sim}535\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of upper Miocene to Pleistocen e nannofossil ooze/chalk with varying amounts of clay and foraminifers (Figure F8). Lithologic Unit I is divided into four subunits. Subunit IA is an ${\sim}120\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of Pleistocene light greenis h gray clay-rich nannofossil ooze. This subunit contains pteropod s and is largely homogeneous with variable amounts of clay. In th e lowermost $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ of the subunit, dark–light bedding cycles becom e more evident. The boundary between Subunits IA and IB marks  a sharp transition between darker clay-rich foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze and dominantly lighter nannofossil ooze. Subunit I B (early Pliocene to earliest Pleistocene) is an ${\sim}90\mathrm{~m~}$ thick greenis h gray nannofossil ooze, with clay content increasing toward the middle of the subunit and then decreasing again toward the base. Th e middle part of Subunit IB also contains an interval of significan t soft-sediment deformation at $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf. Sulfide specks and nodules are abundant, and foraminifer content increases toward th e bottom of the subunit. The base of Subunit IB is the first downhol e occurrence of well-defined light–dark cycles. Subunit IC ( ${\sim}160\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) consists of upper Miocene to lowermost Pliocene light greenish gray nannofossil ooze with varying abundances of foraminifer s and clay. This subunit shows strong color cyclicity at a section scale, with cycles largely reflecting changes in carbonate content ( $\mathord{\sim}80$ t o $50\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Sulfide patches are abundant throughout. The base of th e subunit is defined by the transition from ooze to chalk, which corresponds to the switch from the HLAPC to XCB coring system i n Hole U1482A. Subunit ID is composed of upper Miocene ligh t greenish gray chalk with low abundances of clay. Color cycles are o n the order of 1.5 to $2\;\mathrm{m}$ thick in this subunit. Dissolution of foraminifers has resulted in moldic porosity within the chalk. Foraminifer s are also occasionally concentrated in discrete layers in Subunit ID.  

Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers are abundant and benthic foraminifers are present throughout the recovere d succession at Site U1482 and generally show very good to excellen t preservation. Planktonic/benthic ratios are typically 99:1. The ag e model for Site U1482 is based on calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy (Figure F9). The base of the lat e Pleistocene is placed at ${\sim}3$ mbsf, between biohorizon top Globigerinoides ruber (pink) $(0.12\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and biohorizon base Emiliania huxleyi $\left(0.29\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . The base of the middle Pleistocene is placed betwee n 47 and 80 mbsf, between the top of Globorotalia tosaensis $\left(0.61\,M\mathrm{a}\right)$ and the top of Helicosphaera sellii $\left(1.26\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . There is strong evidence for sedimentary disturbance and reworking in the lower an d middle Pleistocene with the potential for missing section in the upper part of the lower Pleistocene. The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary is placed at 118 mbsf (Figure F8). There are concentrations o f planktonic foraminifer biohorizons at ${\sim}102{-}103$ mbsf $(\mathord{\sim}1.3\mathord{-}1.9\$ Ma) and 300 mbsf $[{\sim}6.1{-}6.6\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , suggesting condensed intervals o r hiatuses. This is less clear in the calcareous nannofossil biohorizons, although nannofossil age control is sparse at both of thes e levels. Otherwise, sedimentation appears continuous throughou t the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene interval (Figure F9). The ag e at the base of the recovered succession is constrained as $<\!10.47$ M a by the absence of the planktonic foraminifer Paragloborotalia mayeri in the lowermost sample examined, although calcareous nannofossil assemblages suggest a slightly older age of ${\sim}10.75$ Ma. Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons ar e in generally good agreement and indicate sedimentation rates o f ${\sim}5.9~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the late Miocene, decreasing to ${\sim}3.3\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ i n the early Pliocene. The Pleistocene is characterized by higher sedimentation rates of ${\sim}7\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F9).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1482 measured natura l remanent magnetization (NRM) of archive halves from Hole s U1482A–U1482C before and after demagnetization in a peak alternating field (AF) of $15~\mathrm{mT},$ , which effectively removed the vertical overprint induced by the drill string. Fifty discrete samples wer e taken to investigate paleomagnetic carriers and rock magneti c properties. $\mathrm{NRM}_{\mathrm{15mT}}$ intensity is higher $({\sim}10^{-4}\mathrm{~A/m)}$ in the uppe r 40–60 mbsf of each hole, decreases between 60 and 90 mbsf, an d remains low $\mathrm{\left({\sim}10^{-5}\ A/m\right)}$ below ${\sim}90$ mbsf where it approaches th e measurement noise level of the magnetometer. Decreases in magnetic intensity downhole are accompanied by decreases in othe r ferrimagnetic concentration parameters (anhysteretic remanen t magnetization [ARM] and isothermal remanent magnetizatio n [IRM]), a halving of the $\mathrm{NRM}_{\mathrm{15mT}}/\mathrm{NRM}$ intensity, and a coarsenin g of magnetic grain size (lower ARM/saturation remanent magnetization [SIRM]). These changes are coeval with decreases in interstitial water sulfate and the appearance of pyrite in the sediment associated with the reduction of primary ferrimagnetic oxides and formation of secondary iron sulfides during early sediment diagenesis. I n the upper 50–70 mbsf, inclinations plot around those expected fo r the site latitude assuming a geocentric axial dipole (GAD) field. Azimuthally corrected declination using the Icefield MI-5 tool i s largely consistent between successive cores but maintains an absolute offset of $150^{\circ}{-}180^{\circ}$ (i.e., corrected values for normal polarit y cluster between $150^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ instead of $0^{\circ}$ ). Relatively weak magnetic susceptibility coupled with reduction of ferrimagnetic oxide s results in a largely uninterpretable signal below the iron-reductio n zone and restricts our geomagnetic interpretation to the upper $^{50-}$ 70 mbsf. Sediment in this zone appears to have been deposite d during a period of normal polarity consistent with the Brunhe s Chron (C1n).  

The physical property data collected for Site U1482 includes $P$ - wave velocity, gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, magneti c susceptibility (MS), natural gamma radiation (NGR), and thermal conductivity on whole-round cores from Holes U1482A–U1482 D and additional measurements on split cores and discrete sample s including $P$ -wave velocity; porosity; and bulk, dry, and grain densities. Thermal conductivity was also measured on split cores whe n the sediment became too indurated to use the needle probe. Despit e the relatively homogeneous lithology dominated by nannofossil ooze at this site, physical property parameters display broad-scal e features and high-resolution cyclicity throughout the sequence (Figure F8). A downhole, linear increase is superimposed on these highfrequency cycles in thermal conductivity $({\sim}1.0{-}1.5\;\mathrm{W/[m{\cdot}K])}$ , GR A bulk density $(\mathord{\sim}1.4\mathrm{-}2.0\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , and moisture and density (MAD) dr y density $(0.8{-}1.5~\mathrm{\mathrm{\:g/cm^{3}}})$ and wet bulk density $(1.4–2.0\;\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , whereas porosity decreases with depth from $\sim\!75\%$ to $45\%$ , representing increasing compaction with depth. Notably, GRA bulk density, NGR, and MS exhibit a broad peak centered at ${\sim}175$ mbsf, which coincides with an interval of soft-sediment deformation observed in all holes (Figure F8). Formation temperature measurements made with the advanced piston corer temperature too l (APCT-3) on Cores 363-U1482A-4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H indicate  a geothermal gradient of $48^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ for the upper ${\sim}120$ mbsf.  

Tie points for stratigraphic correlation were established mainl y with Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) MS data, although some were based on WRMSL GRA bulk density and NG R data. Correlation was challenging due to intervals with very low amplitude variability in the WRMSL and NGR signals, the presence o f intervals containing soft-sediment deformation, and variations i n the size of core gaps resulting from a large tidal range of $3{-}4\mathrm{~m~}$ during coring operations at Site U1482. The core composite dept h below seafloor (CCSF) depth scale is anchored to the mudline Cor e 363-U1482B-1H, which is assigned the depth of $_0\textrm{m}$ CCSF. Fro m this anchor, we worked downhole to establish a composite stratigraphy on a core-by-core basis. We developed a splice from 0–451. 2 m CCSF and a composite depth scale to $614.6~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF. The matc h between the holes is well constrained within the splice except fo r intervals of soft-sediment deformation (0–17, 55–84, 104–111, an d $207{-}210\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CCSF})$ and one core gap at $401\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. Below $451\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, we determined tentative correlations between some core s but did not construct a splice, which should be explored as part o f postcruise research.  

The inorganic geochemistry of Site U1482 is strongly influence d by the remineralization of organic matter. Total organic carbo n (TOC) content is ${>}1.0\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ in the uppermost ${\sim}100$ mbsf (Figure F8), which is relatively high for an open marine setting. The sedimen t rapidly becomes suboxic, as evidenced by a $[\mathsf{M}\mathsf{n}^{2+}]$ peak in the interstitial water profile at $\mathord{\sim}20$ mbsf. Sulfate reduction occurs until ${\sim}120$ mbsf, where near-complete sulfate depletion is accompanied by  a rapid increase in methane. This sulfate–methane transition zon e (SMTZ) is also marked by a pronounced increase in $[\mathbf{B}\mathbf{a}^{2+}]$ in th e interstitial water, reflecting both authigenic precipitation and dissolution of sedimentary barite $\mathrm{(BaSO_{4})}$ in underlying sediment. Pea k alkalinity and [Si] values observed between 0 and 120 mbsf indicat e organic matter and biogenic silica remineralization, respectively. The steady increases in $\mathrm{[NH_{4}^{+}]}$ and $\left[\mathbf{B}\mathbf{r}^{-}\right]$ are also consistent wit h this progressive remineralization of organic matter. Calcium an d magnesium concentrations decrease in the upper $120~\mathrm{mbsf},$ possibly reflecting calcite precipitation. A similar trend of decreasin g phosphate suggests possible precipitation of apatite, although overall $[\mathsf{P O}_{4}^{\;\;3-}]$ is quite low $(<\!10\;\upmu\mathrm{M})$ . Below 120 mbsf, $\left[{\bf M g}^{2+}\right]$ continue s to decrease, whereas $\left[\mathbf{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ shows a slight increase. Although thi s suggests precipitation of dolomite, downhole trends in $\left[K^{+}\right]$ , [B], an d $\left[\mathrm{Li^{+}}\right]$ indicate that ion exchange with clay minerals could contribut e to the trends observed in the interstitial water profiles.  

Hydrocarbon monitoring shows high methane concentratio n below the SMTZ, with an average of $6\%$ . However, the ratio o f methane to ethane, as well as the gas wetness index, suggests tha t most of the gas has a biogenic origin. Methane concentrations decrease to ${\sim}3\%$ between $\mathord{\sim}380$ and $530~\mathrm{mbsf},$ reflecting progressiv e depletion of available organic matter for methanogenesis. Both ethane and propane profiles largely follow methane, but also respon d to the increased thermal maturity following the geothermal gradient.  

The carbonate content at Site U1482 fluctuates between 0 an d 180 mbsf, with an average of ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Below 180 mbsf, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ content increases to ${\sim}80~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , possibly reflecting the late Miocene t o early Pliocene “biogenic bloom” that is most pronounced in th e Indo-Pacific region (e.g., Farrell et al., 1995; Gupta and Thomas, 1999).  

Two downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1482C , the triple combo (NGR, porosity, density, electrical resistivity, an d MS) and the FMS-sonic (NGR, sonic velocity, and electrical resistivity images) tool strings. The triple combo tool string reached t o the bottom of the hole at $533.4\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF, whereas the FMS-sonic tool sting reached only to $517\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ after encountering fill. One of th e four FMS pads performed poorly; however, postacquisition processing corrected the problem. Caliper data show that the borehol e was enlarged by ${\sim}2.5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ in the upper $250\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ which affecte d the quality of the density and porosity measurements and resulte d in higher variability in those data. Deeper than $350~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , corresponding to the depth where we switched to XCB coring, the borehole walls were remarkably smooth. This interval corresponds t o lithologic Subunit ID, which consists of chalk.  

The composite gamma ray log shows an increase between 11 8 and $207~\mathrm{m}$ wireline matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) (Subunit IB), which correlates with an increase in NGR measured o n cores, indicating a higher proportion of clay over that interval. Shallow and deep resistivity measurements show consistent offse t downhole, indicating that there was little or no fluid invasion int o the formation. $P$ -wave velocities increase steadily downhole t o roughly $2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at the bottom of the hole. Discrete $z$ -axis $P.$ -wav e measurements on cores provide an estimate for the interval fro m the seafloor to the bottom of the drill pipe at $74.7~\mathrm{m}$ drilling dept h below seafloor (DSF). Combining these data, we were able to establish a velocity profile to the bottom of the hole and derive reliabl e calculations of depths to key reflectors in the seismic data crossin g Site U1482.  

# Site U1483  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1483 (proposed Site WP-11B) is located on the northwes t Australian margin at $13^{\circ}5.24^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $121^{\circ}48.25^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and $1733~\mathrm{mbsl}$ (Figur e F7). The site is situated on seismic Line BR98-117, $1300\mathrm{~m~}$ northeast of the intersection with seismic Line BR98-168 and ${\sim}0.8\ \mathrm{nmi}$ southeast of the ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ long piston Core MD01-2378, which provides insights into late Pleistocene sedimentation and stratigraph y at this location (e.g., Holbourn et al., 2005; Kuhnt et al., 2015). Th e interpretation of Miocene seismic reflectors is based on compariso n to the Australian Geological Survey Organisation regional seismi c survey Line 119-04 (well control by Buffon 1 and Brewster 1A) an d the BBHR Line 175/10 (well control by Argus 1). A major unconformity marks the top of the prograding sequence at 0.72 s TWT belo w seafloor and is interpreted as the middle Miocene sequence boundary corresponding to a major sea level drop associated with rapi d expansion of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (Mi-3; $13.8\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ) (Rosenthal e t al., 2016).  

Site U1483 is situated on the Scott Plateau at the northwester n margin of northeast-trending Browse Basin (Figure F7), which underlies the Australian northwest margin between the onshore Kimberley Basin and the Scott Plateau (Symonds et al., 1994). Thi s region is adjacent to some of the oldest ocean crust still in th e world’s ocean (Argo Abyssal Plain) formed after the breakup o f Gondwanaland and the separation of northwest Australia from  a Tethyan landmass (Gradstein et al., 1992). The Mesozoic sectio n beneath the Scott Plateau is strongly influenced by breakup-relate d tectonism and forms the acoustic basement through much of th e  

Scott Plateau area (Stagg and Exon, 1981). The postbreakup sedimentary succession forms an ${\sim}2000\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, relatively unifor m blanket over the Scott Plateau and the northeastern margin o f Browse Basin. Site U1483 is located south of the Sunda arc, wher e ongoing collision between Australia and the Eurasia/Pacific arc system has occurred since the Miocene (Keep et al., 2007; Hall, 2012). However, intense Neogene faulting is mainly observed in the southernmost parts of Browse Basin (Barcoo Subbasin), whereas th e northern parts are relatively devoid of intense Neogene deformation (Keep et al., 2007).  

Site U1483 is located ${\sim}264~\mathrm{km}$ northeast of Site U1482. Bot h sites are within the hydrographic transition that separates the war m tropical water of the IPWP from subtropical water masses. Jointly, the two sites are suitable to monitor changes in the southward extent of tropical warm water related either to circulation or globa l climate trends. Both sites are close to the oceanographic front between relatively cool, nutrient-rich water carried northward in th e Eastern Indian Ocean by the West Australian Current and warm, oligotrophic Leeuwin Current waters, which results in a stee p north–south SST gradient (Figure F1).  

The sedimentation rate at Site U1483 is $\mathrm{{\sim9\cm/ky}}$ (Holbourn e t al., 2005), which is twice the rate than that at Site U1482. Combined, the two sites will allow reconstruction of the southwestern extent o f the IPWP since the early late Miocene. Furthermore, the sites ar e located along the route of the ITF as it exits into the Indian Ocea n through the Timor Strait between northwestern Australia and Jav a (Figure F7). The Timor Strait is one of the three main exits of th e ITF to the Eastern Indian Ocean (Gordon, 2005). Thus, Sites U148 2 and U1483 are ideally located to monitor changes in the intensit y and thermal structure of ITF water masses entering the Eastern Indian Ocean (e.g., Xu et al., 2008).  

# Operations  

After a $142\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1482, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1483 at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local ship time; $\mathrm{UTC}+8\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 26 October 2016. We cored three holes at Site U1483 (Table T1). The original operations plan called for coring to APC refusal (estimated at $250~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) followed by two additional holes deepened t o 350 mbsf using the XCB coring system. Instead, we cored thre e holes using the APC to ${\sim}290$ mbsf, the depth at which we encountered APC refusal. We decided not to deepen the holes to the original planned total depth because we had already reached ou r primary age target.  

Hole U1483A was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic hardware to 293.3 mbsf (Cores 363-U1483A-1 H through 31H), where a partial stroke indicated APC refusal. Downhole temperature measurements using the APCT-3 were taken o n Cores 4H (37.1 mbsf), 7H (65.6 mbsf), 10H (94.1 mbsf), and 13 H $(122.6\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), obtaining reliable results on three of the four deployments. A total of $308.58\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was recovered over $293.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.105.2\%$ recovery) in Hole U1483A.  

Hole U1483B was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic hardware to 287.0 mbsf (Cores 361-U1483B-1 H through 31H). A total of $301.62\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment was collected ove r this interval $105.1\%$ recovery). Oriented APC coring with nonmagnetic hardware continued in Hole U1483C and reached 284.8 mbs f (Cores 361-U1483C-1H through 31H). One drilled interval $\left(3\textrm{m}\right)$ advanced the hole without coring to avoid alignment of core gap s for stratigraphic correlation. A total of $292.42\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered over $281.8\ \mathrm{m}$ of coring $103.8\%$ recovery). Operations at Sit e  

U1483 ended at $0800~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 October. Total time spent on the sit e was $97.5\;\mathrm{h}$ (4.1 days).  

A total of 92 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $902.62\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $862.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration ( $105\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

The sediment cored at Site U1483 is assigned to a single lithologic unit composed of ${\sim}293\mathrm{~m~}$ of lower Pliocene to recent nannofossil ooze with variable amounts of clay, foraminifers, and siliceou s microfossils (primarily diatoms and radiolarians) (Figure F10) . Tephra layers occur sporadically throughout the unit. Lithologi c Unit I is divided into three subunits. Subunit IA is an ${\sim}56\mathrm{~m~}$ sequence of middle Pleistocene to recent greenish gray clay-bearin g and clay-rich nannofossil ooze. Sponge spicules and mollusk shell fragments are common throughout this subunit, whereas pteropod s are restricted to the upper 40 mbsf. Alternations between dar k greenish gray and light greenish gray sediment at multiple-mete r scale are apparent and also recorded in NGR and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ records. Th e boundary between Subunits IA and IB is defined by the first downhole appearance of brownish gray diatom-rich nannofossil ooze. Subunit IB (early to middle Pleistocene) is an ${\sim}130\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of greenish gray clay-rich nannofossil ooze, diatom-ric h nannofossil clay, and clay-rich diatom–nannofossil ooze. This subunit is distinguished by higher biosiliceous content than that in Subunit IA. Clay content increases toward the bottom of Subunit IB. Color alternations are at the section scale $\left(\sim\!1.5\mathrm{~m}\right)$ , which is mor e frequent than in Subunit IA. The darker colored intervals hav e higher siliceous microfossil and organic matter content than th e lighter colored intervals. Shell fragments are also common throughout this subunit. The boundary between Subunits IB and IC is denoted by a significant reduction in the abundance of siliceou s microfossils. Subunit IC is composed of ${\sim}105\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of greenish gra y foraminifer-rich nannofossil clay. Two significant intervals of softsediment deformation occur in this subunit (Figure F10). The uppe r unit is ${\sim}24~\mathrm{m}$ thick, whereas the lower unit has varying thicknesse s among the holes. These intervals include inclined bedding, folding, and microfaulting. Dark gray clay layers that exhibit high bulk density also occur in the deformed intervals.  

The $293\textrm{m}$ succession recovered at Site U1483 contains abundant, diverse, tropical calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer assemblages. Planktonic foraminifers dominate the ${>}63~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction; however, other microfossil groups are also present an d include benthic foraminifers, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, and occasionally ostracods. The planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratios ar e typically 99:1. Preservation is generally excellent to very goo d throughout the entire succession, although a minor decrease i n preservation is noted with depth.  

Integrated calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminife r biostratigraphy, together with magnetostratigraphy, indicate tha t the succession at Site U1483 spans the late early Pliocene to the recent (Figure F11). Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons are generally in good agreement. The age at th e bottom of the recovered succession is $>\!3.59$ Ma based on the presence of Sphaeroidinella seminulina. Biostratigraphy in the lowermost part of the recovered section $(\mathrm{{\sim}}293\mathrm{{-}}260~\mathrm{{\mbsf})}$ ) suggest s sedimentation rates of ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the late early Pliocene. The interval between $\mathord{\sim}260$ and 193.5 mbsf includes two packages o f disturbed sediment. A clustering of biohorizons around 260–24 3 mbsf coincides with the deeper disturbed interval and is overlain b y what appears to be intact stratigraphy, with another interval of clustered biohorizons from $\mathord{\sim}200$ to 193 mbsf. Based on the mixed fossi l assemblages found in the two intervals, these could represent th e top and base of a single, large mass movement dated to ${\sim}2.1$ Ma o r two (or more) discrete events dated to ${\sim}2.8$ and $2.1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Above th e disturbed interval, sedimentation rates appear essentially constan t at ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from $2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ to present.  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1483 involved measurement of the NRM of all archive halves before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ . Sixty-two discrete samples were als o taken to investigate paleomagnetic carriers and rock magneti c properties. $\mathrm{NRM}_{15\mathrm{mT}}$ intensity is higher in the upper $\mathord{\sim}75$ mbsf o f each hole, decreases between 75 and 85 mbsf, and remains low an d variable deeper than ${\sim}85$ mbsf, occasionally approaching the measurement noise level of the magnetometer. Decreases in NRM intensity deeper than $\mathord{\sim}75$ mbsf and reductions in the $\mathrm{NRM}_{\mathrm{15mT}}/\mathrm{NRM}$ intensity ratios are coeval with a decrease in interstitial water sulfat e to almost zero and peak methane concentrations, indicating tha t sediment diagenesis is likely influencing the magnetic materia l deeper than $\mathord{\sim}75$ mbsf, although rock magnetic properties sugges t that these effects may not be as severe as those experienced at Sit e U1482. For Holes U1483A and U1483B, azimuthally corrected declination is internally consistent between adjacent cores, although i t maintains an $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ baseline offset in absolute values as declinatio n should cluster around $0^{\circ}$ during normal polarity. In Hole U1483C, negative inclination (expected for normal polarity in this Souther n Hemisphere location) in the upper part of Hole U1483C is associated with declinations that cluster around $0^{\circ}/360^{\circ}$ , and this offse t appears to have self-corrected, although the cause of this self-correction remains unclear.  

NRM directions are interpreted for the intervals not affected b y soft-sediment  deformation.  The  Brunhes/Matuyama  boundar y $(0.781\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is identified at ${\sim}80$ mbsf. Below this we observe the upper ${\sim}93$ mbsf; $0.988\;\mathrm{Ma}_{\star}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ) and lower ${\sim}100$ mbsf; $1.072\;\mathrm{Ma})$ boundaries of the Jaramillo normal and the upper $.{\sim}170$ mbsf; 1.778 Ma ) and lower ( $\,\,\sim\!186$ mbsf; 1.945 Ma) boundaries of the Olduvai normal, with the lower Olduvai occurring a few meters above the upper interval of soft-sediment deformation (Figure F10). Guided by biostratigraphy, we also identify the Matuyama/Gauss boundary $^{\,\prime}{\sim}223$ mbsf; 2.581 Ma) between the packages of soft-sediment deformation. These reversal horizons are in excellent agreement with bot h the calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizon s (Figure F11).  

The physical property data collected for Site U1483 include $P$ - wave velocity, GRA bulk density, MS, NGR, and thermal conductivity on whole-round cores from all holes and additional measurements on split cores and discrete samples, including $P.$ -wav e velocity; porosity; and bulk, dry, and grain densities. Despite the relatively homogeneous lithology at Site U1483, physical property parameters  display  long-term  trends  as  well  as  high-resolutio n variability throughout the recovered succession. Thermal conductivity, GRA bulk density, MAD dry and bulk density, and porosit y are all dominated by a long-term trend of increasing compactio n with depth. Subtle changes in GRA bulk density underlying th e compaction trend generally correspond with the lithologic subunit s and are likely related to changes in clay content. Strong peaks in M S are found coeval with the occurrence of some of the tephra layers i n multiple holes. Otherwise, MS and NGR are relatively stabl e throughout the record (Figure F10), unlike at Site U1482, wher e broad-scale trends were observed. The two intervals of observe d soft-sediment deformation are coincident with elevated GRA an d MAD bulk densities observed at ${\sim}195{-}218$ and \~243–253 mbsf.  

Tie points between holes at Site U1483 were established mainl y with WRMSL MS data, although some were based primarily o n color reflectance $L^{\ast}$ data. In addition, we used WRMSL GRA bul k density and NGR data to aid correlations. We constructed tw o spliced intervals, one from 0 to $211.5~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF and the other fro m 239.8 to $266.8\ \mathrm{m}$ CCSF. We did not construct splices over the tw o intervals of soft-sediment deformation (211.5–239.8 and deepe r than $266.8\,\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m\,CCSF}}$ ), as the WRMSL GRA bulk density and MS dat a variations indicate that there is not stratigraphic continuity betwee n holes over these intervals. However, we did estimate offsets for th e cores within the deformed intervals because there were some features that could be correlated between holes.  

A total of $35~\mathrm{IW}$ samples were collected in Hole U1483A fro m the seafloor to 283.3 mbsf. The IW geochemical profiles provide a n integrated record of early diagenetic processes related to organi c matter degradation within the sediment, with downhole TOC contents ranging from 0.4 to $1.4~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F10). The oxic–suboxi c transition at Site U1483 occurs at ${\sim}7.5$ mbsf, as indicated by a rapi d increase in dissolved $[\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}]$ concentrations. The SMTZ is encountered at ${\sim}50~\mathrm{mbsf},$ characterized by quantitative consumption o f dissolved sulfate, an increase of $\mathsf{p H}$ (from 7.7 to 8.4), and substantial release of alkalinity (up to $18\;\mathrm{mM}$ ) and phosphate $(25\;\upmu\mathrm{M})$ into th e surrounding IW. Dissolved $\left[\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+}\right]$ decreases to $4~\mathrm{mM}$ at the SMTZ, suggesting active carbonate precipitation. The evolution of $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratios suggests that calcite (and not high-Mg calcit e and/or dolomite) is most likely the dominant authigenic phase a t the SMTZ. In addition, the rapid increase in the Ba profile at th e SMTZ below 45 mbsf also indicates rapid dissolution of barite at th e SMTZ. In the methanogenic zone below 50 mbsf, methane concentrations increase to ${\sim}100{,}000$ ppmv at 140 mbsf and then decreas e to ${\sim}11\small{,}200$ ppmv to the bottom of Hole U1483A. High methane/ethane ratios suggest that the methane is mostly of biogenic origin.  

Downhole potassium, magnesium, lithium, chloride, and sodium concentrations reflect a combination of clay-mineral authigenesis or alteration and IW diffusion. In particular, the increasin g trends in $\left[{{\bf{C}}{\bf{l}}-}\right]$ and $\left[\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}\right]$ IW profiles possibly reflect an upward diffusive signal from deeper and more saline fluids. Another interesting feature at Site U1483 is the IW profiles for Si, $\left[\mathbf{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $\left[\mathrm{NH^{+}}\right]_{\mathrm{:}}$ , alkalinity, and, to a lesser extent, Li deeper than ${\sim}250$ mbsf. Thes e IW profiles show perturbations associated with the occurrence o f the soft-sediment deformation above 250 mbsf, which could reflec t differences related to changing porosity and/or early diagenetic reactions. Calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ content ranges between 3 8 and $78\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=59\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ), showing a general increasing tren d downhole in lithologic Subunits IA and IB (Figure F10). Dissolve d silicon concentrations are also elevated relative to Site U1482, an d the presence of diatoms and radiolarians indicates the importanc e of biogenic silica at this site.  

# Site U1484  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1484 (proposed Site WP-71A) is located ${\sim}15~\mathrm{km}$ offshor e the northern coast of PNG at $03^{\circ}07.93^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $142^{\circ}46.98\mathrm{{^E}}$ and $1031\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ (Figure F12). The site is situated on seismic reflection profile Lin e RR1313-WP7-2, ${\sim}900\mathrm{~m~}$ south of the cross-point with seismic reflection profile Line RR1313-WP7-5 and ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{km}$ east of the location of piston Core RR1313 32PC (Rosenthal et al., 2016). This ${\sim}7\;\mathrm{m}$ piston core and a companion gravity core from this site are characterized by a mixture of clay and volcanic sand containing relativel y high numbers of planktonic and benthic foraminifers in an excellen t state of preservation. Preliminary isotope analysis of planktonic foraminifers from the cores indicates $>\!6\;\mathrm{m}$ of Holocene sediment, implying sedimentation rates of ${\sim}60\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . The multichannel seismi c (MCS) survey shows ${>}650~\mathrm{m}$ sediment cover at this site. The MC S profiles exhibit remarkable uniformity of acoustic stratification indicating a succession of alternating clay-, silt-, and sand-dominate d sediment beds to 0.28 s TWT below the surface with estimate d depth of 225 mbsf, our target drilling depth. Below this depth, th e MCS profiles suggest a disturbed zone. We note also a possible disturbed interval between 0.14 and 0.16 s TWT (Rosenthal et al., 2016).  

Site U1484 is located in a tectonically complex region east of th e Cyclops Mountains and west of the Sepik/Ramu River mouth. Th e region is bounded to the south by the Bewani-Torricelli fault zon e on land, which links to offshore transform faults that eventuall y connect with seafloor spreading along the Bismarck Sea seismic lineation to the east (Baldwin et al., 2012). Northwest of the site, th e southward subduction of the Caroline microplate forms the Ne w Guinea Trench. The continental shelf in this region is exceedingl y narrow $(<\!2\ensuremath{\mathrm{~km}})$ , allowing large amounts of terrigenous sedimen t discharge from coastal rivers to bypass the narrow continental shel f and eventually accumulate in deeper water (Milliman et al., 1999).  

The climatology and oceanography of northern PNG is strongl y influenced by the seasonal migration of the ITCZ, with enhance d precipitation during boreal winter (Figure F2A, F2B). Interannually, precipitation decreases during El Niño events (Figure F2C, F2D). Monsoon winds control the surface hydrography of the region, suc h that the New Guinea Coastal Current flows westward over the dril l sites during the boreal summer southeasterly monsoon (also referred to as the austral winter monsoon in the Southern Hemisphere)  (Kuroda,  2000).  These  currents  distribute  sediment s originating from the Sepik/Ramu River mouth and multitudes o f other tributaries along the coast over the northern slopes of PN G and adjacent deep basins. The surface current reverses during th e boreal winter northwesterly monsoon (Kuroda, 2000), and the surface sediment plume from the Sepik River is observed to meande r out across the Bismarck Sea (Steinberg et al., 2006). However, th e NGCU persists in a westward direction year-round at a water dept h of ${\sim}220\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , widening and strengthening during boreal summe r (Kuroda, 2000). This undercurrent supplies terrigenous sedimen t from the near-bottom river plumes to the drill sites. At ${\sim}1000\;\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the sediment is bathed in AAIW.  

The high sedimentation rates at Site U1484 provide the potential to resolve late middle to late Pleistocene centennial- to millennial-scale climate variability in the WPWP. Comparing these highresolution records with comparable ones for the North Atlantic an d eastern equatorial Pacific will allow us to better constrain the mechanisms influencing millennial-scale variability. This site will als o provide insights on orbital-scale variability during the mid- to lat e Pleistocene. Finally, Site U1484 will allow us to examine the southern Pacific contribution to the Indonesian Throughflow.  

# Operations  

After a $2097\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1483, which was complete d in 7.5 days at an average speed of $11.6~\mathrm{kt}$ , the vessel stabilized ove r Site U1484 at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local ship time; $\mathrm{UTC}+10\,\mathrm{hl}$ ) on  6 November 2016. We cored three holes at Site U1484 in accordanc e with the original operations plan that included coring with the AP C to 225 mbsf in three holes (Table T1).  

Hole U1484A was cored to 195.0 mbsf with the APC using orientation  and  nonmagnetic  hardware  (Cores  363-U1484A-1 H through 21H). We had poor recovery within an interval of san d from ${\sim}110$ to 130 mbsf. After encountering APC refusal, w e switched to the HLAPC and continued coring to 223.2 mbsf (Core s 22F through 27F), where we terminated the hole. Downhole temperature measurements using the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4 H (37.1 mbsf), 7H $(65.6~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), 10H (94.1 mbsf), 13H (122.6 mbsf), and 16H ( $147.5\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ , obtaining reliable results on three of the fiv e deployments. A total of $220.60\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment was recovered ove r $223.2\:\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(98.8\%$ recovery) in Hole U1484A.  

After encountering sand between ${\sim}110$ and 130 mbsf in Hol e U1484A, we altered the operations plan for the remaining holes t o include using the HLAPC over that interval to improve recovery. Hole U1484B was cored with the APC using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware to 104.8 mbsf (Cores 363-U1484B-1H throug h 12H), including one $2\,\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval to offset core gaps for stratigraphic correlation. We then switched to the HLAPC and continued coring to 133.0 mbsf (Cores 13F through 18F), which allowed u s to better recover the sand found through that interval (average recovery of $88\%$ in Hole U1484B compared to $57\%$ in Hole U1484A). We then switched back to the APC and cored to 190 mbsf (Cor e 19H) using orientation. The remainder of Hole U1484B was core d with the HLAPC to 222.9 mbsf (Cores 25F through 31F) after encountering APC refusal. We recovered $220.51\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over 220. 9 m of coring $(99.8\%$ average) in Hole U1484B.  

Oriented APC coring with nonmagnetic hardware then continued in Hole U1484C to 106.1 mbsf (Cores 363-U1484C-1H throug h 12H). We then switched to the HLAPC and cored to 145.7 mbs f (Cores 13F through 21F) to recover the sand interval. One drille d interval $\left(2\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ advanced the hole without coring to avoid alignmen t of core gaps for stratigraphic correlation. We then switched back t o the APC and cored to 193.2 mbsf (Cores 22H through 26H). Afte r encountering APC refusal, we finished coring the hole to 221.4 mbs f (Cores 27F through 32F) using the HLAPC. A total of $225.46~\mathrm{m}$ o f core was recovered over $219.4\:\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(102.8\%$ recovery). Operations at Site U1484 ended at $0945~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 November. Total tim e spent on the site was $83.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.5 days).  

A total of 55 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $515.91\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over $508.4\mathrm{~m~}$ of penetration ( $101.5\%$ recovery). We also collected 33 HLAPC cores, recovering $150.66\mathrm{~m~}$ o f sediment over $155.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $(97.1\%$ recovery). Overall recovery at Site U1484 was $666.57\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $663.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(100.5\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

The sediment cored at Site U1484 is assigned to a single lithologic unit composed of ${\sim}224\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of middle Pleistocene to recen t terrigenous and hemipelagic sediment (Figure F13). Lithologic Uni t I is composed of three main components: dark greenish gray clay, silt, and sand. The relative abundances of clay and silt vary downhole. Subordinate amounts of nannofossils and foraminifers ar e mixed with the terrigenous sediment, and fine-grained intervals alternate with discrete layers of sand- and silt-size sediment. The upper ${\sim}10$ mbsf is characterized by decimeter- to meter-thick cla y layers with variable amounts of silt and a few thin (centimeter t o decimeter) sand layers. From ${\sim}10$ to $150~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , the abundance an d thickness of sand layers increases downhole. Clay is more abundan t between $\mathord{\sim}150$ and $175\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , whereas in the deepest part of the succession, sand and clay layers are present in subequal proportions. The amount of clay and nannofossils in the sand layers is negligible; however, large benthic foraminifers are present within some of th e coarse sand layers. Sulfide patches and sponge spicules are found i n clay-rich intervals, whereas wood and shell fragments are mor e common in sand layers. The sand layers typically have sharp base s and show both normal and reverse grading. The sand-size materia l at Site U1484 consists of four main components: minerals (feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, and chlorite), volcanic and plutonic rock fragments, mineraloids (pyritized glauconite), and biogenic particle s (foraminifers). Several discrete tephra layers up to $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick ar e present in the succession.  

The sediment succession at Site U1484 contains well-preserve d calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers. Calcareous nannofossils are not as abundant compare d with Sites U1482 and U1483, but benthic foraminifers are mor e common, with planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratios reaching 70:3 0 between ${\sim}60$ and 150 mbsf. The benthic foraminifer assemblage s change downhole, with deeper water species present in the uppe r and lower parts of the succession, whereas the middle sections include mixed deeper and shallow-water benthic foraminifers, including some reef-dwelling forms.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicates that Hole U1484A spans the upper part of the middle Pleistocene to the late Pleistocene (Figure F14). The upper ${\sim}200$ mbsf of the succession is within Zone NN21 (late middle to lat e Pleistocene), identified by the biohorizon base $E_{\mathrm{{*}}}$ . huxleyi $\left(0.29\,\mathrm{{Ma})}$ between ${\sim}195$ and 200 mbsf. The absence of $G.$ . tosaensis (th e marker for Subzone Pt1a) assigns the entire section recovered a t Hole U1484A to Subzone Pt1b (Figure F13). The middle/late Pleistocene boundary $(0.126\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is located between the biohorizons to p acme Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica $(0.28\;\mathrm{Ma})$ and top $G.$ ruber (pink ) $(0.12\mathrm{\Ma})$ at a depth of ${\sim}100$ mbsf. Average estimated linear sedimentation rates based on calcareous nannofossil and planktoni c foraminifer bioevents are ${\sim}75~\mathrm{cm/ky},$ indicating that the age at th e bottom of Hole U1484A is ${\sim}0.29\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F14).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1484 involved measurement of the NRM of archive halves from all holes before and afte r demagnetization in a peak AF of $10{-}15~\mathrm{mT}$ . Forty-seven discret e samples were also taken to investigate paleomagnetic carriers an d rock magnetic properties. Discrete MS, IRM, and IRM ratios indicate relatively high ferrimagnetic mineral concentrations, and despite observations of pyrite in the lower part of the three holes, sediment diagenesis has had relatively little effect on the primar y magnetic assemblage that is related to the high terrigenous sediment flux.  

Sediment in all three holes appears to have been deposite d (quasi-)continuously with no major hiatuses. Azimuthally correcte d declination from APC cores in all holes is internally consistent between adjacent cores, although it maintains an $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ baseline offse t in absolute values as declination should cluster around $0^{\circ}$ for norma l polarity. Inclination plots around, or slightly steeper than (owing t o a pervasive overprint), expected values of about $-6^{\circ}$ for the site latitude assuming a GAD field. These observations are consistent wit h all the sediment recovered at Site U1484 being deposited during th e Brunhes (C1n), ${<}0.781$ Ma (Figure F13). These findings are als o consistent with biostratigraphic datums that suggest the base of Sit e U1484 is $_{<0.44}$ Ma.  

Physical properties correlate well with the alternating clay an d silty sand lithologies found at Site U1484, even in terms of shortterm, decimeter-scale variability. Because of the high sedimentatio n rates, the effect of increased compaction with depth is only minor a t this site. GRA bulk densities increase rapidly from the seafloor t o ${\sim}12$ mbsf (from 1.5 to $1.75~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and then gradually increase t o ${\sim}1.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the bottom of the hole. GRA bulk density probabl y underestimates the true bulk density compared with discrete MA D bulk density, particularly in the sand layers. This underestimatio n may be due to high gas expansion in the sand-rich layers. The hig h bulk and grain density values additionally correspond to low carbonate content values $({\sim}2{-}3\ \mathrm{wt}\%)$ and low TOC content (0.1–0. 2 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). MS ranges from $50\times10^{-5}$ to $>\!1200\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ , with lower values corresponding to clay-rich intervals. NGR counts range between ${\sim}10$ and 30 counts/s, with the lower values corresponding t o sand intervals (Figure F13). In all holes, 12 distinct $10{-}15\;\mathrm{m}$ cycle s are observed in GRA bulk density, NGR, and especially in MS, which broadly reflect alternations between clay-rich and silty sandrich layers. Downhole temperature measurements made with th e APTC-3 indicate a geothermal gradient of $40^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ .  

For Site U1484, we constructed a splice for the entire site usin g all three holes, but there are gaps in the splice mainly because of incomplete recovery of sand intervals. Gas expansion frequentl y caused extrusion of sediment out of the top and bottom of the cor e liner and onto the rig floor, resulting in disturbed sediment, especially in the top and bottom sections of each core, as well as void s throughout the recovered sequence. These factors resulted in relatively high growth factors and made it difficult to correlate data between holes. Tie points were established mainly with WRMSL M S data, supplemented with NGR data. The splice is continuous from  0 to $133.98\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF. Below this from 133.98 to $153.85\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF, ther e are at least three core gaps and some tentative tie points. This is underlain by an interval from 153.85 to $270.85\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ that is continuous except for one core gap at $172.55{-}175.28\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CCSI}}$ F. The deepes t interval, from $270.85$ to 284.61 m CCSF, has a few core gaps. In sum, although there were some intervals with discontinuous recovery, w e calculated offsets for all cores in all three holes and constructed  a nearly continuous splice that has a few gaps.  

A total of 24 IW samples were collected from Hole U1484 A from the seafloor to 222.4 mbsf. The IW geochemistry indicates  a typical sequence of early diagenetic processes, driven by the presence of organic matter within the sediment. The TOC conten t ranges between ${\sim}0.1$ and $1.8\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=0.88\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) (Figure F13) . The TOC/total nitrogen (TN) ratios in most samples are ${<}10,$ , suggesting that the organic matter deposited at Site U1484 is mainly o f marine origin. The correlations between the downhole profiles o f TOC and TN contents suggest that the majority of the nitrogen i s organic-bound, with little preferential degradation between organi c carbon and nitrogen. Carbonate content at this site is low, rangin g from ${\sim}2$ to $15\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F13).  

Peak enrichments of dissolved Mn and Fe concentrations in th e sediment mark a transition between the overlying oxic sedimen t and underlying suboxic conditions at ${\sim}3$ mbsf. At $\mathord{\sim}20$ mbsf, a sudden increase in methane concentration coincides with near-complete depletion of dissolved sulfate, indicating the presence of th e SMTZ. The $\left[\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+}\right]$ concentration at the SMTZ is relatively low $^{\cdot\sim2}$ mM), suggesting that active carbonate precipitation takes place a t this depth, possibly associated with formation of authigenic aragonite, as suggested by the concomitant drop in Sr concentration. Below the SMTZ, hydrocarbon gas is characterized by very hig h methane/ethane ratios, which suggests that the methane is mostl y of biogenic origin.  

A striking feature of IW geochemistry at Site U1484 is the larg e increase of alkalinity (up to $50~\mathrm{mM},$ ) from the seafloor to betwee n ${\sim}40$ and $50\ \mathrm{mbsf}.$ . This alkalinity peak is accompanied by enrichments in dissolved $[\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+}]$ , $\left[K^{+}\right]$ , and $\left[\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}\right]$ concentrations, which indicates that partial dissolution of silicate minerals probably occur s within this interval. At Site U1484, this process is most likely drive n by the presence of substantial amounts of easily alterable fresh volcanogenic material derived from the nearby PNG highlands. Thi s anoxic silicate weathering (Wallmann et al., 2008) typically represents a net sink for carbon dioxide in methanogenic sediment, which releases $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{}^{-}$ , dissolved cations, and silica into surrounding IW. It may also lead to formation of secondary clay mineral s (e.g., smectite) in the methanogenic sediment, which at Site U148 4 could possibly explain some of the observed decrease of dissolve d $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ deeper than 50 mbsf. In contrast, the comparatively low dissolved Fe concentration throughout Hole U1484A (except for th e upper 10 mbsf) could also be explained by significant formation o f pyrite within the sediment column.  

# Site U1485  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1485 (proposed Site WP-72A) is located ${\sim}19\,\mathrm{km}$ offshor e the northern coast of PNG at $03^{\circ}06.16^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $142^{\circ}47.59\mathrm{\,E}$ and $1145\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ (Figure F12). The site is situated on seismic reflection profile Lin e RR1313-WP7-2, ${\sim}2~\mathrm{km}$ northeast of the cross-point with seismi c reflection profile Line RR1313-WP7-5, and ${\sim}3.2~\mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of Site U1484 (Rosenthal et al., 2016). An ${\sim}7~\mathrm{m}$ piston core an d a companion gravity core retrieved ${\sim}4~\mathrm{km}$ to the southwest of th e site location are characterized by a mixture of clay and volcani c sand containing relatively high numbers of planktonic and benthi c foraminifers in excellent state of preservation. Preliminary isotop e analysis of planktonic foraminifers from the cores indicates ${>}6\;\mathrm{m}$ o f Holocene sediment, implying sedimentation rates of ${\sim}60~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . The MCS profiles exhibit remarkable uniformity of acoustic stratification indicating a succession of alternating clay-, silt-, and sanddominated sediment beds to $0.4\,\mathrm{s}\,\mathrm{TWT}$ below the surface with estimated depth of 350 mbsf, just deeper than our target drilling dept h of 325 mbsf. There is evidence for a disturbed layer between 0.1 6 and $_{0.19\;s}$ TWT, but bedding is very uniform below this interval t o the target depth (Rosenthal et al., 2016). This site extends the recor d recovered at Site U1484.  

Site U1485 is located in a tectonically complex region east of th e Cyclops Mountains and west of the Sepik/Ramu River mouth. Th e region is bounded to the south by the Bewani-Torricelli fault zon e on land, which links to offshore transform faults that eventuall y connect with seafloor spreading along the Bismarck Sea seismic lineation to the east (Baldwin et al., 2012). Northwest of the site, th e southward subduction of the Caroline microplate forms the Ne w Guinea Trench. The continental shelf in this region is exceedingl y narrow $(<\!2\ \mathrm{km})$ , allowing large amounts of terrigenous sedimen t discharge from coastal rivers to bypass the narrow continental shel f and eventually accumulate in deeper water (Milliman et al., 1999).  

The climatology and oceanography of northern Papua Ne w Guinea is strongly influenced by the seasonal migration of th e ITCZ, with enhanced precipitation during boreal winter (Figur e F2A, F2B). Interannually, precipitation decreases during El Niñ o events (Figure F2C, F2D). Monsoon winds control the surface hydrography of the region, such that the New Guinea Coastal Curren t flows westward over the drill sites during the boreal summer southeasterly monsoon (also referred to as the austral winter monsoon i n the Southern Hemisphere) (Kuroda, 2000). These currents distribute sediment originating from the Sepik/Ramu River mouth an d multitudes of other tributaries along the coast over the norther n slopes of PNG and adjacent deep basins. The surface current reverses during the boreal winter northwesterly monsoon (Kuroda, 2000), and the surface-sediment plume from the Sepik River is observed to meander out across the Bismarck Sea (Steinberg et al., 2006). However, the NGCU persists in a westward direction yea r round at a water depth of ${\sim}220\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , widening and strengthenin g during boreal summer (Kuroda, 2000). This undercurrent supplie s terrigenous sediment from the near-bottom river plumes to the drill sites. At a depth of ${\sim}1000\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the sediment is bathed in AAIW.  

The high sedimentation rates at Site U1485 provide the potential to resolve late middle to late Pleistocene centennial- to millennial-scale climate variability in the WPWP. Comparing these highresolution records with comparable ones for the North Atlantic an d eastern equatorial Pacific will allow us to better constrain the mechanisms influencing millennial-scale variability. This site will als o provide insights on orbital-scale variability during the late middle t o late Pleistocene. Finally, Site U1485 will allow us to examine th e southern Pacific contribution to the ITF.  

# Operations  

After a $1.85\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit in dynamic positioning mode from Sit e U1484, the vessel stabilized over Site U1485 at $1110\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times ar e local ship time; $\mathrm{UTC}+10\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 10 November 2016. The operation s plan included three holes using the APC and HLAPC to 315 mbsf. We ultimately cored four holes. Holes U1485A and U1485B wer e cored to $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf. Hole U1485C was terminated after three core s when it proved unsuitable for covering core gaps for stratigraphi c correlation. Hole U1485D was cored to 63.9 mbsf to fill core gap s and intervals where significant numbers of IW samples were take n from each core in Hole U1485A (Table T1).  

Hole U1485A was cored to 188.0 mbsf with the APC using orientation  and  nonmagnetic  hardware  (Cores  363-U1485A-1 H through 20H). After pumping Core 20H out of the core barrel, w e switched to the HLAPC and continued coring to 300.8 mbsf (Core s 21F through 44F), where we encountered a partial stroke, indicatin g HLAPC refusal. Because we had reached our age target, we decide d not to deepen the hole further using the XCB. As Site U1485 is located only ${\sim}3.2\,\mathrm{km}$ from Site U1484, we opted not to take downhol e temperature measurements. Whole-round samples for high-resolution IW analyses were taken at a frequency of one per section in th e upper ${\sim}54$ mbsf of Hole U1485A. A total of $312.36~\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t was recovered over $300.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of coring ( $103.8\%$ recovery) in Hol e U1485A.  

Because core recovery was generally good in the upper 19 0 mbsf, we opted not to switch to the HLAPC over the interval wit h higher sand content that had resulted in poor recovery with the fulllength APC at Site U1484. Hole U1485B was cored to 173.5 mbs f (Cores 363-U1485B-1H through 20H) using the APC with orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. We then switched to the HLAP C and continued coring to 297.7 mbsf (Cores 21F through 47F), wit h one $2\,\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval to offset core gaps for stratigraphic correlation. We recovered $291.18~\mathrm{m}$ of core over $295.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(98.5\%$ recovery) in Hole U1485B.  

Oriented APC coring with nonmagnetic hardware then continued in Hole U1485C; however, after data collected for stratigraphi c correlation indicated that Core 363-U1485C-2H was a copy of Cor e 1H, we terminated the hole. Hole U1485C was cored to 27.5 mbs f (Cores 1H through 3H) and recovered $29.35\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $(106.7\%$ recovery). Hole U1485D was cored specifically to contribute material to the stratigraphic splice, particularly over the interval of highresolution IW sampling shallower than 55 mbsf. Oriented APC coring with nonmagnetic hardware penetrated to 63.9 mbsf (Core s 363-U1485D-1H through 8H), with one $1\,\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval to cove r a core gap. A total of $68.22\textrm{m}$ of core was collected over $62.9~\mathrm{m}$ o f coring ( $108.5\%$ recovery). Operations at Site U1485 ended at $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 November. Total time spent on the site was $85.8\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.6 days).  

A total of 50 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $452.28\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $451.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $100.1\%$ recovery). W e also collected 50 HLAPC cores, recovering $248.73\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t over $235\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $105.9\%$ recovery). Total core collected at Sit e U1485 was $701.11\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $686.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(102.1\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

An ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{~m~}$ succession was recovered in four holes at Sit e U1485. The upper ${\sim}225$ mbsf is similar to the stratigraphy at Sit e U1484, which is located only ${\sim}3.2~\mathrm{km}$ south-southwest of the site. The sediment at Site U1485 is assigned to a single lithologic uni t composed of ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of middle Pleistocene to recent terrigenou s and hemipelagic sediment (Figure F15). Lithologic Unit I is divide d into two subunits. Subunit IA is an ${\sim}216\,\mathrm{~m~}$ sequence of middl e Pleistocene to recent sediment composed of three main components, dark greenish gray clay, silt, and sand, which is equivalent t o Unit I at Site U1484. The relative abundances of these terrigenou s components vary downhole. Subordinate amounts of nannofossil s and foraminifers are mixed with the terrigenous sediment, and finegrained intervals alternate with discrete layers of sand- and silt-siz e sediment. As at Site U1484, the upper ${\sim}8$ mbsf is characterized b y thick (decimeter to meter) clay layers with variable amounts of sil t and several centimeter- to decimeter-thick sand layers. From ${\sim}8$ t o 127 mbsf, coarser grained material becomes more abundant, wit h the frequency and thickness of sand layers increasing downhole, although clay-rich intervals are still present over this interval. Tw o thick sand intervals occur between $\mathord{\sim}127$ and 165 mbsf, separated b y a $6\,\mathrm{m}$ thick interval of hemipelagic clay. From $\mathord{\sim}165$ to 216 mbsf, th e sediment consists of clay with variable amounts of silt and nannofossils, interbedded with thinner sand layers. Shallow-water benthi c foraminifers are less frequent in the sand layers at this site compared to Site U1484, whereas shell and wood fragments are common. The sand layers typically have sharp bases and show bot h normal and reverse grading. The sand-size material at Site U148 5 consists of four main components: minerals (feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, and chlorite), volcanic and plutonic rock fragments, mineraloids (pyritized glauconite), and biogenic particles (foraminifers). Sulfide patches are also present, with pyrite occurring frequently deeper than $\mathord{\sim}165$ mbsf. Subunit IB is an ${\sim}85\mathrm{~m~}$ successio n dominated by dark gray clay with variable amounts of silt an d nannofossils. The absence of thick sand layers distinguishes thi s subunit from Subunit IA. A nannofossil-rich clay layer is presen t from ${\sim}226$ to 240 mbsf. This interval also has higher carbonate content than the rest of the succession (Figure F15). A number of discrete tephra layers up to $4\ \mathrm{cm}$ thick are present throughout th e succession at Site U1485.  

The succession at Site U1485 contains well-preserved calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers. Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer assemblages ar e very similar to those at Site U1484; however, the benthic foraminife r assemblages show less influence from downslope transport. Th e planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratios are consistently around 99: 1 (compared with 70:30 at Site U1484). Only a few intervals contai n the shallow-water taxon Rotalinoides compressiusculus, whereas th e bulk of the assemblage is dominated by typical bathyal forms.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicates that Hole U1485A spans the upper part of the middle Pleistocene to the late Pleistocene (Figure F16). The upper $\mathord{\sim}183$ mbsf of the succession is within Zone NN21 (late middle to lat e Pleistocene), identified by the biohorizon base $E_{\mathrm{{*}}}$ . huxleyi $\left(0.29\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ between $\mathord{\sim}179$ and 186 mbsf. From $\mathord{\sim}183$ to 255 mbsf, the sequenc e is assigned to Zone NN20 based on the absence of $E$ . huxleyi an d Pseudoemiliania lacunosa. The biohorizon top $P_{\star}$ lacunosa (0.4 4 Ma), found between ${\sim}254$ and 257 mbsf, indicates the top of Zon e NN19. The remainder of the cored succession to 300 mbsf is assigned to the upper part of Zone NN19 (middle Pleistocene). Th e absence of $G_{\mathrm{{}}}$ . tosaensis (the marker for Subzone Pt1a) assigns th e entire section recovered at Hole U1485A to Subzone Pt1b $(<\!0.61$ Ma) (Figure F15). Together, nannofossil and planktonic foraminife r biostratigraphy indicates an age between 0.61 and $0.44\;M{\bf a}$ for th e bottom of the succession at Hole U1485A. The middle/late Pleistocene boundary $(0.126\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is located between the biohorizons to p acme G. caribbeanica $\left(0.28\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and top G. ruber (pink) $\left(0.12\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ a t a depth of ${\sim}84$ mbsf. Sedimentation rates based on calcareou s nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer bioevents are ${\sim}62.5~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F16).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1485 involved measurement of the NRM of archive halves from all holes before and afte r demagnetization in a peak AF of $10\;\mathrm{~mT~}$ (Holes U1485A an d U1485D) and $15~\mathrm{mT}$ (Holes U1485B and U1485C). Sixty-three discrete samples were also taken to investigate paleomagnetic carrier s and rock magnetic properties. Discrete MS, IRM, and IRM ratio s indicate relatively high ferrimagnetic mineral concentrations in sediment shallower than $\mathord{\sim}180$ mbsf and, despite observations of pyrite, sediment diagenesis has had relatively little effect on the primar y magnetic assemblage that is related to the high terrigenous sediment flux. Below $\mathord{\sim}180$ mbsf, MS and IRM decrease to relatively lo w values, and ferrimagnetic grain size is distinctly coarser deeper tha n ${\sim}240$ mbsf. This interval was not cored at Site U1484 and is coincident with the occurrence of extensive pyrite in the recovered sediment. These signatures are indicative of sediment diagenesis tha t may be progressively altering the magnetic assemblage at dept h (e.g., Karlin and Levi, 1983; Rowan et al., 2009).  

Sediment in all three holes appears to have been deposite d (quasi-)continuously with no major hiatuses. Azimuthally correcte d declination from APC cores from all holes is internally consisten t between adjacent cores although it maintains an $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ baseline offset in absolute values as declination should cluster around $0^{\circ}$ fo r normal polarity. Orientation for Hole U1485A recorded an issu e similar to that observed for Hole U1483C, where corrected declination of adjacent cores varies by ${\sim}30^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ}$ . Between-core offsets ar e not observed in the other holes at Site U1485, so the results in Hol e U1485A likely result from incorrect correction from the Icefiel d MI-5 tool. The tool deployed (Icefield $\#2007]$ ) was the same orientation tool that gave a similar issue at Site U1483C, and we conclud e that this is a tool-specific issue. This tool was not used for the remainder of the expedition. Inclination plots around, or slightl y steeper than (owing to a pervasive overprint), expected values o f about $-6^{\circ}$ for the site latitude assuming a GAD field. These observations are consistent with all sediment recovered at Site U1484 bein g deposited during the Brunhes (C1n), ${<}0.781$ Ma (Figure F15). Thes e findings are in agreement with biostratigraphic datums that sugges t that the base of Site U1485 is between 0.61 and $0.44~M{\bf a}$ (Figur e F16).  

Physical properties correlate well with the alternating clay an d silty sand lithologies at Site U1485 over both short and longe r scales. Because of the high sedimentation rates, the effect of increased compaction with depth is minimal at this site. GRA bul k density and MS are particularly sensitive to variations in clay an d sand content, recording high-frequency variations. GRA bulk density increases rapidly from the seafloor to ${\sim}10$ mbsf (from 1.5 t o $1.65\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ . From ${\sim}10$ to 135 mbsf, GRA bulk density displays $^{10-}$ $15\;\mathrm{m}$ cycles, with values ranging from 1.4 to $1.85~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Below 18 5 mbsf, GRA bulk density shows significantly decreased amplitud e variability, ranging between 1.35 and $1.5~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , which reflects th e dominance of clay. Over most of the record, GRA bulk density an d MS co-vary. MS is generally low in clay-rich intervals and show s more variability and higher values in silt- and sand-rich interval s (Figure F15). MS values are consistently low from 0 to 10 mbs f $({\sim}150\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI})$ ). Below this, MS shows similar $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m}$ scale cyclicity as the GRA bulk density record, with values ranging from 5 0 $\times\,10^{-5}$ to $>\!1200\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ . In the clay-rich Subunit IB, MS is significantly lower and shows less variability, averaging $\sim\!100\times10^{-5}$ SI. NGR counts range between ${\sim}10$ and 40 counts/s, with the lowe r values corresponding to sand intervals (Figure F15). The NGR record also exhibits $10{-}15\;\mathrm{m}$ scale cyclicity, particularly in the interval from ${\sim}10$ to 135 mbsf.  

For Site U1485, we constructed a splice for the entire site usin g three holes (U1485A, U1485B, and U1485D), but there are gaps i n the splice mainly because of incomplete recovery of sand intervals. Hole U1485C was not used for construction of the splice, as the second core appears to repeat the section recovered in the first core, which resulted in termination of coring after only three cores. Ga s expansion frequently caused extrusion of sediment out of the to p and bottom of the core liner and onto the rig floor, resulting in disturbed sediment, especially in the top and bottom sections of eac h core, as well as voids throughout the recovered sequence. Tie point s were established mainly with WRMSL MS data, supplemented wit h NGR data. The splice is continuous and well constrained from 0 t o 157.41 m CCSF. Reduced core recovery in the relatively sand ric h interval from 157.41 to $222.11\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ and gaps aligned betwee n HLAPC cores of adjacent holes from 222.11 to $267.34\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ resulted in a discontinuous splice over this interval. From $267.34\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF to the bottom of the cored section at $373.35\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, th e splice is tentative due to voids caused by gas expansion, low-amplitude MS values, and low-resolution NGR counts used to establis h correlations.  

A total of 60 IW whole-round samples were collected from th e seafloor to 295 mbsf in Hole U1485A. Thirty-six IW samples wer e analyzed on the ship, whereas the remainder were fixed for shorebased analyses. The IW geochemical profiles at Site U1485 closel y resemble those obtained at nearby Site U1484. Near-complete consumption of dissolved $[\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}]$ is achieved at ${\sim}12~\mathrm{mbsf_{:}}$ , coinciden t with an abrupt increase of ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ at the SMTZ. Below the SMTZ, most samples are characterized by high methane/ethane ratios, suggesting that methane is mostly of biogenic origin. The TOC conten t at Site U1485 is slightly higher than at Site U1484, ranging fro m ${\sim}0.3$ to $1.2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F15). The TOC/TN ratios are usually ${<}10_{\ }$ , suggesting that the organic matter deposited at Site U1485 is predominantly of marine origin.  

As at Site U1484, Site U1485 displays evidence for anoxic silicat e weathering occurring within the methanogenic zone, as inferre d from marked enrichments of alkalinity (up to $50~\mathrm{mM})$ ), $\left[K^{+}\right]$ (13. 5 $\mathrm{mM}$ ), and $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]$ $\left(50\;\mathrm{mM}\right)$ between about 20 and 120 mbsf. Thes e IW patterns most likely indicate partial dissolution of silicate minerals within the anoxic sediment (Wallmann et al., 2008). Similarly, the carbonate content of Site U1485 is generally low, ranging fro m to 0.7 to $27.0\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ with an average of $9.0\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F15).  

Penetration to deeper depths at Site U1485 $300~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) compared to Site U1484 (223 mbsf) provides a more comprehensive understanding of the sediment-water interactions that occur deeper i n the sedimentary sequence at the PNG margin. A notable feature i s the pronounced downhole depletion observed for several element s $\left(\left[\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+}\right]\right.\mathrm{\,}$ , $\left[K^{+}\right]$ , B, and $[\mathsf{P O}_{4}{}^{3-}])$ at depths ranging from ${\sim}50$ to 12 0 mbsf, following their respective IW enrichments in the overlyin g sediment. These depletions also coincide with decreasing total alkalinity and a sudden drop of $\mathsf{p H}$ from 8.1 to 7.9. In agreement wit h results from previous investigations (Michalopoulos and Aller, 1995; Wallmann et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2016), these findings ar e consistent with secondary clay authigenesis (reverse weathering),  a process that releases $C O_{2},$ which leads to removal of major cations/anions in the surrounding IW, thereby explaining the observe d drop of $\mathsf{p H}$ and IW geochemical patterns, respectively.  

Finally, abrupt changes in concentration or slope are observed i n IW profiles of several elements (e.g., $\left[K^{+}\right]$ , $\left[{\bf M g}^{2+}\right]$ , Na, Br, and $\mathrm{[PO_{4}}^{3-}$ ]) coincident with changes in lithology. These changes in litholog y likely act as diffusive caps, interrupting communication in IW between the sediment above and below these distinct lithologi c changes, thereby imparting slight variations in concentration tha t overprint the general trends dominated by anoxic sediment weathering and clay mineral authigenesis.  

# Site U1486  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1486 (proposed Site WP-05A) is located ${\sim}215~\mathrm{km}$ westsouthwest of Manus Island at $02^{\circ}22.34^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $144^{\circ}36.08^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in $1332\mathrm{~m~}$ o f water (Figure F12). The site is situated at the intersection of seismi c reflection Profiles GeoB13-084 and GeoB13-088. The seismic profile shows a continuous succession of hemipelagic sediment wit h acoustic basement estimated at ${\sim}225$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016). This site was targeted to recover a complete Pleistocene record wit h unprecedented resolution for the WPWP.  

The tectonic setting of Sites U1486 and U1487 (as for that of th e northern PNG Sites U1484 and U1485) was shaped by the obliqu e northward movement of the Australian plate as it rapidly converge d with the Pacific plate. This collision resulted in a complex plat e boundary zone that includes volcanic arcs but also resulted in th e formation and rotation of microplates within this zone, as well a s lithospheric rupture that formed small oceanic basins (Baldwin e t al., 2012). The Bismarck Sea, on the northeastern side of PNG (Figure F12), forms a back-arc basin with respect to the New Britain ar c and is divided into the North Bismarck (NBS) and South Bismarc k (SBS) microplates, separated by the active Bismarck Sea left-lateral transform fault and spreading segments (Taylor, 1979). Site U148 6 is located on the NBS microplate. To the north, the NBS microplat e is bordered by the Manus Trench, which defines the boundary between it and the Pacific plate. Within this complex tectonic regime, the southwestern side of the Manus Basin is considered one of th e more stable regions. Magnetic anomalies in the Bismarck Sea indicate rapid asymmetric spreading since $3.5~\mathrm{Ma}$ (Taylor, 1979). Th e continuous collision between the Australian and Pacific plate s caused the SBS microplate to rotate rapidly clockwise $({\sim}9^{\circ}/\mathrm{My})$ , whereas the NBS microplate is rotating slowly anticlockwise (0.3– $1.25^{\circ}/\mathrm{My})$ ) (Baldwin et al., 2012). Asymmetric rotation of the Nort h and South Bismarck Basins likely changed the position of New Britain and adjacent islands relative to PNG. ODP Leg 193 focused o n the eastern part of the Manus Basin, exploring the tectonic, volcanic, and seafloor hydrothermal system activity in this convergen t plate margin setting.  

An isotope record from piston Core MD05-2920 located nea r Site U1486 indicates a sedimentation rate of ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm/ky},$ substantially higher than that found in other open ocean Pacific sites, wit h no discernible disturbance for the past ${\sim}400~\mathrm{ky}$ (Tachikawa et al., 2011, 2013). The relatively abundant $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content $(25\mathrm{-}45\mathrm{\wt\%})$ and well-preserved foraminifer tests suggest the potential to generate a suborbitally resolved paleoceanographic record of unprecedented quality through the Pleistocene. X-ray fluorescence scannin g of Core MD05-2920 demonstrates that centennial precipitatio n variability can be resolved from the elemental content of the sediment (Tachikawa et al., 2011).  

This site was targeted because of its potential to provide an excellent Pleistocene paleoceanographic record to examine orbitalscale climate variability at high resolution through the Pleistocene. It is also ideally located to monitor the contribution from the Ne w Guinea Coastal Current and NGCU, which is the southern branc h of the westward, cross-equatorial flowing South Equatorial Current, and constitutes the main southern Pacific contribution to the ITF. At a water depth of ${\sim}1300~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the sediment is bathed by UCD W originating from the Southern Ocean (Figure F5B), and thus will allow for the reconstruction of past variability of this water mass.  

# Operations  

After a $117\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1485, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1486 at $0921\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local ship time; $\mathrm{UTC}+10\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 14 November 2016. The original operations plan included thre e holes using the APC to 200 mbsf. We ultimately cored four hole s (Table T1). Hole U1486A consisted of a single full core and was terminated because it did not recover the mudline. Holes U1486B an d U1486C were cored to 211.2 and 201.3 mbsf, respectively. Hol e U1486D was cored to 186.5 mbsf to fill coring gaps and interval s where significant numbers of IW samples were taken from Hol e U1486B for construction of the composite section.  

Hole U1486A was cored to 9.5 mbsf with the APC using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. When Core 363-U1486A-1H retrieved a full core liner, indicating that we missed the mudline, w e terminated coring in this hole. A total of $9.95\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment wa s recovered over $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.104.7\%$ recovery) in Hole U1486A.  

Hole U1486B was cored to 211.2 mbsf (Cores 363-U1486B-1 H through 23H) using the APC with orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. Downhole formation temperature measurements usin g the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H $(34.5~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , 7H (63.0 mbsf), 10H (91.5 mbsf), and 13H $\mathrm{20.0\mbsf)}$ , obtaining good results o n all four deployments. Core 23H seemed to be a full stroke; however, only $5.67~\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered. When drilling out the “rathole, ” drilling stalled at 211.2 mbsf, indicating something hard at tha t depth that the core barrel had been unable to penetrate. Given tha t the acoustic basement at Site U1486 was estimated at ${\sim}225$ mbsf, we speculate that we encountered the acoustic basement at a somewhat shallower depth. The presence of a few small basalt fragment s in the core catcher of Core 23H supports this interpretation. W e collected $215.49\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $211.2~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $102.0\%$ recovery) in Hole U1486B.  

Hole U1486C was cored to 201.3 mbsf (Cores 363-U1486C-1 H through 23H) using the APC with orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. We decided to terminate coring above the hard layer encountered in Hole U1486B. Two drilled intervals (each $2\textrm{m}$ ) wer e used to advance the hole without recovery for stratigraphic correlation and one core (Core 11H) did not recovery any material. We collected $172.70\;\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over $197.3~\mathrm{~m~}$ of coring $(87.5\%$ recovery) in Hole U1486C.  

Hole U1486D was cored to 186.5 mbsf in order to fill gaps in th e composite section. Continuous coring penetrated to 153.2 mbs f (Cores 363-U1486-1H through 16H) with the APC using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. We then drilled ahead withou t coring to 177 mbsf $\left(23.8\;\mathrm{m}\right.$ advance) to shoot Core 19H to capture  a paleomagnetic reversal, which was recovered in Hole U1486B bu t had fallen within a core gap in Hole U1486C. We collected $166.53\,\mathrm{m}$ of core over $162.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(102.4\%$ recovery) in Hole U1486D. Operations at Site U1486 ended at $1015~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November. Total time spent at Site U1486 was $73.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.0 days).  

A total of 63 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $564.67~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $580.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(97.2\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

Sediment at Site U1486 is composed of ${\sim}211\mathrm{~m~}$ of upper Pliocene to recent volcanogenic sediment, biogenic sediment, an d authigenic minerals overlying presumed oceanic crust, which wa s not cored. The relative abundance of the volcanogenic and biogeni c components varies significantly downhole. We assign the recovere d succession to one lithologic unit divided into three subunits (Figur e F17). Subunit IA is an ${\sim}57\;\mathrm{m}$ sequence of mid-Pleistocene to recen t mainly greenish gray biogenic sediment (predominantly foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze) with clay minerals and rare ash layers. Biosilica is also present, usually in trace amounts, and consists o f radiolarians, diatoms, and silicoflagellates. Pteropod tests are als o found in the uppermost part of this subunit. The base of the subuni t is placed at the first downhole black tephra layer. Subunit IB $..85\,\mathrm{m}$ thick) consists mainly of lower Pleistocene biogenic (predominantl y nannofossil) sediment mixed with volcanogenic materials, whic h occur both as dispersed particles and distinct layers (tephra) an d clay minerals. Foraminifers are present in varying abundances, a s are radiolarians and diatoms, although they always constitute ${<}10\%$ of particles. This subunit is distinctly darker than Subunit IA due t o larger proportions of volcanogenic sediment. The dominant lithologies are greenish gray foraminifer-rich nannofossil clay to dar k greenish gray ash-rich nannofossil clay. Tephra layers are mor e abundant in Subunit IB and are typically felsic in composition. Pumice fragments are also present. The base of Subunit IB is defined at a prominent black volcanic ash layer that is marked by a n increase in magnetic susceptibility; below this layer the sediment i s distinctly darker in color (Figure F17). Subunit IC ( ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{m}$ thick; lat e Pliocene to early Pleistocene) is dominated by the volcanogeni c component (ash), which occurs as discrete laminae and layers ranging from a few centimeters to $>\!50\,\mathsf{c m}$ thick. These layers show a variety of depositional styles and occur both interbedded and mixe d with the biogenic and lithogenic sediment (primarily foraminiferrich nannofossil clay). The volcanogenic sediment in Subunit IC i s more mafic in composition and includes brown volcanic glass an d scoria fragments. The bottom ${\sim}4~\mathrm{m}$ of Subunit IC is permeated b y authigenic zeolites of probable hydrothermal origin. Centimetersize fragments of basalt with olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts ar e also found in the bottom part of Subunit IC.  

The sediment succession at Site U1486 contains planktonic foraminifers, benthic foraminifers, and calcareous nannofossils tha t are generally excellently preserved, although some foraminifers ar e fragmented or show evidence of cementation or incipient recrystallization. There is no obvious change in preservation state wit h depth; instead, foraminifers in layers with higher proportions of volcanogenic material appear slightly better preserved than those i n the biogenic sediments. The benthic foraminifer assemblage is indicative of upper bathyal depths throughout the succession, wit h planktonic/benthic ratios around 99:1. Planulina wuellerstorfi i s present in most core catcher samples. The significant amount o f volcanic ash in the sediments below $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf does not significantly affect the composition of the foraminifer and calcareou s nannofossil assemblages.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons, together with magnetostratigraphic horizons, show good agreement (Figure F18). The base of the sedimentary sequence is assigned a late Pliocene age between 2.49 and $3.33\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , constrained b y the presence of Discoaster surculus (biohorizon top at $2.49\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) an d Globigerinoidesella fistulosa (biohorizon base at $3.33\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) in the absence of Globorotalia truncatulinoides (biohorizon base at 2.4 7 Ma). In the latest Pliocene and earliest Pleistocene, sedimentatio n rates were high, ${\sim}14~\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . Extrapolation of these sedimentatio n rates yields an age of $2.7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ for the base of the recovered succession, which is consistent with the age range based on biohorizons. Sedimentation rates declined markedly through the middle to lat e Pleistocene to a long-term average of ${\sim}6\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . Based on these linear sedimentation rates, the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary (2.5 8 Ma) is placed at $\mathord{\sim}183$ mbsf, just below the base of Chron C2r.2 r $(2.581\,\mathrm{Ma})$ (Figure F17).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1486 involved measurement of the NRM of archive halves from all holes before and afte r demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ . We took two or three discrete samples per core from Hole U1486B $\left(n=49\right)$ ) to characteriz e the NRM demagnetization behavior and to investigate the roc k magnetic properties of the sediment. Discrete MS, IRM, and IR M ratios indicate relatively high ferrimagnetic mineral concentration s in the upper ${\sim}62\,\mathrm{mbsf},$ greater influence of higher coercivity minerals between ${\sim}62$ and 204 mbsf, and strongly ferrimagnetic phases i n the bottom of the hole. Coarser magnetic grain sizes and highe r magnetic concentrations in Subunit IC likely reflect the increase d occurrence of mafic-rich volcanogenic sediment, with the highes t magnetic concentrations associated with primary and altered basaltic fragments found at the bottom of the hole.  

The Icefield MI-5 orientation tool was deployed with nonmagnetic hardware for all cores, which permitted azimuthal correctio n of declination. Corrected declination is largely coherent betwee n cores; however, absolute values in all holes clusters around $180^{\circ}$ fo r normal polarity and $0^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity, suggesting that the issues of the baseline offset experienced at the majority of sites durin g Expedition 363 also affected these measurements. Across all thre e holes we observe eight coeval and distinct $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ changes in declination. These declination shifts occur at the same time that inclinatio n changes from GAD-like values during normal polarity to steepe r and more overprinted values during reversed polarity. The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary $(0.781\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is identified at ${\sim}47$ mbsf (Figure F17). Below this we observe the upper ( $\left[{\sim}55\right.$ mbsf; $0.988\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) and lower ( $\mathord{\sim}60$ mbsf; 1.072 Ma) boundaries of the Jaramillo norma l (C1r.1n), the upper ( $[\sim\!66.5\$ mbsf; $1.173\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and lower $'{\sim}68.5$ mbsf; $1.185\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) boundaries of the Cobb Mountain Subchron (C1r.2n), and the upper ( $\mathord{\sim}102$ mbsf; $1.778\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and lower $[\mathord{\sim}113\$ mbsf; 1.94 5 Ma) boundaries of the Olduvai normal (C2n). The Gauss/Matuyama boundary $(2.581\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is found at $\mathord{\sim}182$ mbsf. Continued normal polarity below this depth in all three holes implies that th e recovered sediment is ${<}3.032\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , as we do not observe the uppe r boundary of the Kaena reversed subchron (C2An.1n). These reversal horizons are in excellent agreement with both the calcareou s nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer datums (Figure F18).  

Physical property data collected for Site U1486, in particula r MS, show variations that correlate well with the three lithologi c subunits defined for the site (Figure F17). MS values are very low i n the upper 57 mbsf $\sim\!20\times10^{-5}$ to $50\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI), corresponding t o  

Subunit IA, which consists primarily of biogenic sediment (foraminifers and nannofossils) mixed with clay and rare tephra layers. Over the same interval, GRA bulk density values increase from 1. 4 to $1.6\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , although variance remains quite low. Between 57 an d 140 mbsf (Subunit IB), average MS values increase to ${\sim}75\times10^{-5}$ t o $100\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ , with frequent peaks reaching $200\times10^{-5}$ to $400\times10^{-5}$ SI. Within this interval, distinct peaks in MS, GRA bulk density, an d $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity are coincident with darker, volcanogenic-rich layer s superimposed on a background of nannofossil ooze with varyin g proportions of foraminifers and clay. GRA bulk density values increase to $1.6\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in Subunit IB. Below 140 mbsf (Subunit IC), M S average values increase $\left(\sim\!200\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}\right)$ ) and distinct peaks in MS , GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity occur more frequently, reflecting the dominance of volcanogenic material in the deepest par t of the succession. GRA bulk densities reach $1.8\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ by $200\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ before decreasing to $1.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in the deepest part of Hole U1486B. Unusually high $P$ -wave velocities above $1800\ \mathrm{m/s}$ are also found i n this interval. These high velocities coincide with the appearance o f indurated sediment that contains cemented zeolite precipitates an d other minerals associated with the alteration of volcanic glass by hydrothermal fluids, suggesting that hydrothermal alteration wa s likely due to close proximity to the basaltic basement. NGR value s decrease linearly downhole, with initial values of $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s, decreasing to 8 counts/s at the bottom of the sedimentary sequenc e (Figure F17).  

We constructed a continuous splice for Site U1486 from 0 t o $222.59\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF using three holes (U1486B, U1486C, and U1486D). Tie points were established mainly using WRMSL MS data, aide d occasionally by NGR data. Because Hole U1486B was heavily sampled for IW measurements (one $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ whole-round sample pe r section), we avoided using material from this hole for the splic e from 0 to 150 mbsf, although this was unavoidable over a few intervals with poor recovery. The deepest core collected at Site U1486, which contains basalt fragments and is presumed to be within meters of volcanic basement, was appended to the bottom of the splice.  

Site U1486 was sampled at high resolution (one $5{-}10\,\mathrm{cm}$ wholeround sample per section downhole to $150\;\mathrm{mbsf}\;\mathrm{,}$ ) for IW geochemistry. A total of 106 whole-round samples were taken from Hol e U1486B. Of these, 39 IW samples and one mudline sample wer e processed for all standard shipboard analyses. The IW profiles reflect the variable sedimentation and tectonic evolution of the sit e over the past several million years. In the upper 60 mbsf, IW geochemistry profiles are dominated by moderate changes in alkalinity, sulfate, phosphate, ammonium, and bromine that reflect a modes t degree of organic matter remineralization. The minimum sulfat e concentration observed in Hole U1486B is ${\sim}19\;\mathrm{mM}$ and methane i s low $({<}4\,\mathrm{ppm})$ , which is consistent with the amounts of TOC conten t present at the site (average $=0.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) (Figure F17). $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ conten t is highly variable, ranging from to 0.3 to $75.4\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ with an average o f $40.5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Overall, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content is higher in the upper 138 mbs f (Figure F17). Extremely low $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content is found in ash and sil t samples.  

Deeper than 60 msbf, IW profiles show largely linear gradient s toward the base of the hole that demonstrate the influence of upward diffusion on the IW profiles. Superimposed on these linea r gradients is smaller scale variability, particularly noticeable in $[\mathrm{K}^{+}],$ B, $\left[\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}\right]$ , pH, $\left[{{\mathrm{Cl}}-}\right]$ , and Fe, which can be explained by the interaction of IW with reactive volcanogenic sediment/minerals and claymineral alteration. The inverse relationship between calcium (increasing with depth) and magnesium (decreasing with depth) is  a common feature of sites that have been drilled to oceanic basement.  

The increase in $[\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+}]$ is attributed to submarine weathering o f basal sediment and basalt, whereas formation of authigenic cla y near the basement can serve as a sink for $\left[{\bf M g}^{2+}\right]$ . Marked changes i n chlorinity, manganese, and iron occur deeper than 170 mbsf. Together with the overall increase in IW sulfate between the base o f the hole at ${\sim}211$ mbsf and 60 mbsf, these profiles suggest communication not only between IW and basement rock and sediment, bu t also with crustal fluids.  

# Site U1487  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1487 (proposed Site WP-14A) is located ${\sim}190~\mathrm{km}$ westsouthwest of Manus Island at $02^{\circ}20.00^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $144^{\circ}49.17^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in $874\mathrm{~m~}$ o f water (Figure F12). The site is situated on seismic reflection Profil e RR1313 WP6-5, ${\sim}1.4~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of the cross-point with Profil e RR1313 WP6-3a. The seismic profile shows a continuous succession of hemipelagic sediment with acoustic basement estimated a t $\mathord{\sim}185$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016).  

The tectonic setting of Sites U1486 and U1487 (as for that of th e northern PNG sites) was shaped by the oblique northward movement of the Australian plate as it rapidly converged with the Pacifi c plate. This collision resulted in a complex plate boundary zone tha t includes volcanic arcs but also resulted in the formation and rotation of microplates within this zone, as well as lithospheric ruptur e that formed small oceanic basins (Baldwin et al., 2012). The Bismarck Sea, on the northeastern side of PNG (Figure F12), forms  a back-arc basin with respect to the New Britain arc and is divide d into the NBS and SBS microplates, separated by the active Bismarc k Sea left-lateral transform fault and spreading segments (Taylor, 1979). Site U1487 is located on the NBS microplate. To the north, the NBS microplate is bordered by the Manus Trench, which defines the boundary between it and the Pacific plate. Within thi s complex tectonic regime, the southwestern side of Manus Basin i s considered one of the more stable regions. Magnetic anomalies i n the Bismarck Sea indicate rapid asymmetric spreading since $3.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Taylor, 1979). The continuous collision between the Australian an d Pacific plates caused the SBS microplate to rotate rapidly clockwis e $({\sim}9^{\circ}/\mathrm{My})$ , whereas the NBS microplate is rotating slowly anticlockwise $(0.3{-}1.25^{\circ}/\mathrm{My})$ (Baldwin et al., 2012). Asymmetric rotation o f the North and South Bismarck Basins likely changed the position o f New Britain and adjacent islands relative to PNG. Leg 193 focuse d on the eastern part of the Manus Basin, exploring the tectonic, volcanic, and seafloor hydrothermal system activity in this convergen t plate margin setting.  

Site U1487 is upslope from Site U1486 and was expected t o show the same sediment composition but with reduced sedimentation rate because of its shallower position. As a companion to Sit e U1486, Site U1487 was also targeted because of its potential to provide an excellent Pleistocene paleoceanographic record to examin e orbital-scale climate variability at high resolution through the Pleistocene. It is also ideally located to monitor the contribution fro m the New Guinea Coastal Current and NGCU, which is the souther n branch of the westward, cross-equatorial flowing South Equatoria l Current, and constitute the main southern Pacific contribution t o the ITF. At a water depth of ${\sim}880~\mathrm{mbsl},$ , the sediment is bathed b y modified AAIW originating from the Southern Ocean (Figure F5B), and thus will allow for the reconstruction of past variability of thi s water mass.  

# Operations  

After a $13.3\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1486, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1487 at $1145\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local ship time; $\mathrm{UTC}+10\,\mathrm{h})$ on 17 November 2016. Site U1487 was an alternate site added to th e operations during the expedition. We planned two holes using th e APC to ${\sim}175$ mbsf, with a third hole to cover stratigraphic gaps i f required. We ultimately cored two holes. Hole U1487A was cored t o 144.2 mbsf, and Hole U1487B was cored to 144.3 mbsf (Table T1).  

Hole U1486A was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic hardware to 144.2 mbsf (Cores 363-U1487A-1 H through 16H). Downhole formation temperature measurements using the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H (34.9 mbsf), 7H (63. 4 mbsf), 10H (91.9 mbsf), and 13H (120.4 mbsf), obtaining good results on all four deployments. We terminated coring after Core s 14H and 16H recorded partial strokes and Core 15H had to b e drilled over due to excessive overpull when attempting to retrieve it. Cores 14H through 16H included unconsolidated sand. We collected $146.43\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $144.2~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.101.5\%$ recovery) in Hole U1487A.  

Hole U1487B was then cored to 125.5 mbsf (Cores 363-U1487B1H through 14H) with the APC using orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. We then switched to the HLAPC to core the interval where we encountered unconsolidated sand in Hole U1487A. W e cored to 144.3 mbsf (Cores 363-U1487B-15F through 18F) with th e HLAPC, where we terminated the hole. We collected $148.73\;\mathrm{m}$ o f core over $144.3\:\mathrm{m}$ of coring $103.1\%$ recovery) in Hole U1487B. Operations at Site U1487 ended at $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 November. Total tim e spent at Site U1487 was $34.5\,\mathrm{{h}}$ (1.4 days).  

A total of 30 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $276.34\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $269.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.102.5\%$ recovery). W e also collected 4 HLAPC cores, retrieving $18.82\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ove r $18.8~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $100.1\%$ recovery). In total, we collected $295.16~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $288.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.102.3\%$ recovery).

Sediment at Site U1487 is composed of ${\sim}144\mathrm{~m~}$ of upper Pliocene to recent volcanogenic, authigenic, and biogenic sediment, with a similar sequence as that seen at Site U1486, which is locate d $25~\mathrm{km}$ west-southwest. We assign the recovered succession to on e lithologic unit divided into three subunits (Figure F19), with th e subunits distinguished based on the amount of volcanogenic material in the sediment. Subunit IA (late Pleistocene to recent) span s the upper ${\sim}21\mathrm{~m~}$ and is composed primarily of biogenic (foraminifer and nannofossil) sediment mixed with clay minerals with rar e ash layers. The dominant lithology is nannofossil-rich foraminife r ooze, whereas the sediment at Site U1486 is finer grained and consists mostly of foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze. Trace amounts o f siliceous components (radiolarians, diatoms, and silicoflagellates ) are also present. Pteropods are also found in the uppermost part o f the section. The base of Subunit IA is placed at the second downhole tephra layer, which marks an increase in the proportion of volcanic particles in the sediment. Subunit IB (late Pleistocene ) extends from the base of Subunit IA to ${\sim}86$ mbsf. Biogenic sedimen t (predominantly foraminifers) is still the main sedimentary component of this subunit but volcanogenic sediment is more abundan t than in Subunit IA. The main lithology is nannofossil-bearing t o nannofossil-rich ash-rich foraminifer ooze. Siliceous microfossil s are also still present in trace amounts. Tephra layers are typicall y brown to black and composed primarily of glass shards, indicativ e of explosive volcanism. Black tephra layers become more commo n toward the base of the subunit. As at Site U1486, the base of Subuni t IB is marked by a prominent volcanic ash layer that correspond s with a shift to higher values in MS (Figure F19). Subunit IC (lat e Pliocene to early Pleistocene) marks the transition from dominantl y biogenic above to dominantly volcanogenic sediment. The principa l lithology is ash, with varying proportions of nannofossils, foraminifers, and clay. The volcanogenic component in Subunit IC is primarily composed of microscoria, rather than glass, and was likel y sourced from less explosive eruptions.  

The sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1487 exhibit s many similarities to that recovered at Site U1486. Both sites spa n the past ${\sim}2.7$ My and exhibit a reduction in volcanogenic inpu t through time. Despite the overall similarity between the two sites, we note four important differences in the sedimentology of Sit e U1487 relative to Site U1486:  

1. An overall coarser grain size (foraminifer ooze versus nannofossil ooze),   
2. Lower sedimentation rates,   
3. More intense bioturbation and reworking, and   
4. Thicker tephra layers with relatively large microscoria fragments.  

The sediment succession at Site U1487 contains calcareou s nannofossil,  planktonic  foraminifers,  and  benthic  foraminifer s throughout. Microfossil preservation is excellent to very good. Benthic foraminifers indicate a relatively deepwater bathyal sedimentary  environment  with  a  planktonic/benthic  foraminifer  rati o typically 99:1 throughout the succession.  

Biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic horizons are generally in good agreement. The oldest sediment recovered belongs t o calcareous nannofossil Zone NN16 and planktonic foraminife r Zone PL5 (late Pliocene) and are estimated to be $2.7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ based o n extrapolation of the age-depth trend (Figure F20). From the base o f the hole to ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , sedimentation rates averaged ${\sim}15\;\mathrm{cm/ky},$ mainl y because of the very high rate of volcanic ash deposition early in th e site’s history. Sedimentation rates slowed significantly in the Pleistocene, averaging ${\sim}3.5\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F20).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1487 involved measurement of the NRM of archive-half sections from Holes U1487A an d U1487B before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ . Corrected declination is largely coherent between cores; however, absolute values in all holes clusters around $180^{\circ}$ for normal polarit y and $0^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity suggesting that the issues of the baselin e offset experienced at the majority of sites during Expedition 36 3 and on previous expeditions (e.g., Stow et al., 2013) affected thes e measurements. Relatively soft ferrimagnetic minerals are concentrated in the top ${\sim}24$ mbsf; increased magnetic concentration an d coercivity with depth likely reflect the increased deposition o f mafic-rich volcanogenic ash and tephra. We identify six $180^{\circ}$ shift s in declination at Site U1487, the deepest of these is the Gauss/Matuyama boundary $(2.582\ \mathrm{Ma})$ at $\mathord{\sim}134$ mbsf (Figure F19). Continue d normal polarity below this depth in both holes implies that the recovered sediment is younger than $3.032\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , as we do not observ e the upper boundary of the Kaena reversed subchron (C2An.1n). The magnetostratigraphy is in good agreement with both the calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer datums (Figur e F20).  

All physical property data at Site U1487 exhibit excellent reproducibility between holes and show typical trends consistent with increased downhole volcanogenic input. As with Site U1486, the dat a collected for Site U1487 show variations that correlate well with th e three lithologic subunits defined for the site. These subunits ar e most easily recognized in the MS data, which are very low in th e upper 22 mbsf $\scriptstyle\sim20\;\times\;10^{-5}$ to $50\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ ), corresponding to lithologic Subunit IA that consists of nannofossil-rich foraminifer ooz e with variable amounts of clay and rare ash (Figure F19). Over th e same interval, GRA bulk density values increase from 1.4 to 1. 6 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , albeit with low variability. Between 22 and 86 mbsf (Subuni t IB), the average MS values increase to ${\sim}75\times10^{-5}$ to $100\times10^{-5}$ SI, with a concomitant increase in variability. GRA bulk density value s also increase to $1.6\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Within Subunit IB, distinct peaks in MS, GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity occur coincident wit h darker, volcanogenic-rich layers, superimposed on a backgroun d lithology  of  nannofossil-rich  foraminifer  ooze  with  variabl e amounts of clay. The highest values of NGR $\left[\sim\!20\right.$ counts/s) occur i n the upper ${\sim}86$ mbsf (Subunits IA and IB) of Site U1487, reflectin g the higher clay content of these subunits relative to Subunit IC (Figure F19). NGR variability in the upper $^{86\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ probably reflect s changes in the amount of biogenic material. Below 86 mbsf (Subuni t IC), average MS increases to ${\sim}200\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ and the distinct peaks i n MS, GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity occur more frequently , reflecting the dominance of volcanogenic material in the deepes t part of the hole.  

We constructed a continuous splice for Site U1487 from 0 t o $136.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF using both Holes U1487A and U1487B. We use d WRMSL MS data aided occasionally by NGR and GRA bulk densit y to correlate between the holes. Because Hole U1487A was sample d for IW measurements, our general approach was to use Hol e U1487B as the backbone of the splice and to use short segment s from Hole U1487A to cover gaps in recovery encountered in Hol e U1487B. There is considerable coarse sand below $136.0\mathrm{~m~CCSF}_{}$ and the WRMSL data did not correlate well between the holes du e to drilling disturbance, including possible flow-in that occurre d while retrieving the cores from the bottom of the drill hole. For thi s reason, the splice has gaps and uncertain tie points from $136.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CCSF to the bottom of the site at $156.0\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ .  

Site U1487 was sampled at standard shipboard resolution fo r IW chemistry, with a total of 18 whole-round samples and 1 mudline sample analyzed. Despite the relative proximity of Sites U148 7 and U1486, the IW profiles at Site U1487 display distinct difference s from those at Site U1486. Low phosphate and ammonium concentrations $^{\angle1.5\,\upmu\mathrm{M}}$ and $0.2\;\mathrm{mM}$ , respectively) and relatively high sulfate concentration $(>24\ \mathrm{\mM})$ downhole suggest lower organi c matter content at Site U1487. Concentration of methane also remains low throughout the hole. Small downhole IW gradients ar e observed in several elements (potassium, lithium, and boron) an d likely reflect clay mineral authigenesis. However, the majority of th e IW profiles at Site U1487 display little to no variation with dept h and appear to be influenced by advection and/or diffusion of crustal fluids. For example, $\left[\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+}\right]$ and $\left[{\bf M g}^{2+}\right]$ concentrations both chang e by ${>}15\;\mathrm{mM}$ from the mudline to ${\sim}5$ mbsf, but vary by ${<}1\;\mathrm{mM}$ belo w that depth. Higher permeability expected from the generally coarse r sediment grain size and presence of several faults near Site U148 7 that penetrate from the basement through the majority of the sediment column may help facilitate fluid migration.  

$\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ content shows a monotonic decreasing trend wit h depth, with $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content from ${>}60\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ in the upper 20 mbsf t o ${<}10\,\mathrm{\wt\%}$ in the bottom $15\,\textrm{m}$ of the recovered sequence (Figur e F19). Comparison of $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content with GRA bulk density dat a suggests that this trend can be explained by two-component mixin g between biogenic carbonate (dominant in the upper portions of th e hole) and volcanogenic sediment (dominant in the lower portion o f the hole).  

# Site U1488  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1488 (proposed Site WP-03A) is located on top of th e southern part of the Eauripik Rise at $02^{\circ}02.59^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $141^{\circ}45.29\mathrm{\,E}$ in 260 4 m water depth (Figure F21). The site is situated on seismic reflection Profile RR1313 WP3-1, ${\sim}4.4~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of the intersectio n with seismic reflection Profile RR1313 WP3-3. The seismic profil e shows a continuous succession of hemipelagic, carbonate-rich sediment with basement at ${>}650$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Sit e U1488 is located ${\sim}28~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of Deep Sea Drilling Projec t (DSDP) Site 62 (Figure F3) and close to the location of Core MD97- 2140 used to reconstruct the Pleistocene SST history of the WPW P (de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2005). DSDP Leg 7 recovered a nearl y continuous sequence of upper Oligocene to Quaternary chalks an d carbonate-rich oozes from Site 62 (Winterer et al., 1971). However, recovery was relatively poor and the sediment frequently disturbe d due to the use of the rotary core barrel system.  

Site U1488 is situated on the Eauripik Rise, within the Carolin e Basin north of PNG (Figure F21). The roughly north–south trending Eauripik Rise is an ${\sim}250\,\mathrm{km}$ wide aseismic ridge that rises ${\sim}1\mathrm{-}2$ km above the surrounding seafloor and separates the East and Wes t Caroline Basins. Magnetic anomalies C13–C9 in both basins sho w that ocean crust formed along roughly east–west spreading center s from the Eocene until the late Oligocene. Offsets in these anomalie s and the lack of magnetic lineations beneath the Euaripik Rise supports the interpretation that it formed due to excess submarine volcanism along a leaky north–south transform fault (Hegarty an d Weissel, 1988.) An alternative interpretation attributes the Euaripi k Rise to the northward passage of a mantle hot spot that contribute d to the tectonically and structurally complex region surrounding Sorol Trough (Bracey, 1975). Seismic refractions show thickene d ocean crust beneath the Eauripik Rise, and a small free-air anomal y and positive geoid anomaly indicate a compensated structure reaching deep into the mantle (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988). Althoug h there are no discernible magnetic lineations on the Eauripik Rise, these data and the recovery of tholeiitic basalt at Site 62 (Wintere r et al., 1971) make it difficult to argue that it is a remnant of ancien t continental material. The igneous rocks recovered from the botto m of Site 62 were slightly vesicular, highly altered, and contained calcite veins with well-preserved foraminifers and nannofossils. Th e dolomitization of overlying limestone suggests that these basalts intruded into marine chalk leading to extensive diagenetic reaction s near the base of the sedimentary succession.  

Site U1488 is located ${\sim}2^{\circ}$ north of the Equator and is thus suitable for reconstructing the hydrographic history of the WPWP. Th e comparatively low sedimentation rate at this site will be used alon g with the record of Site U1490 to reconstruct the evolution of th e WPWP since the late Miocene. At $2600\ \mathrm{mbsl},$ , the site is bathed b y modified UCDW (Figure F5A) and hence will be useful to monito r past changes in this water mass. High-resolution IW sampling a t this site will be used for geochemical reconstructions of the dee p Pacific water mass $\left(\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}_{:}$ , salinity, and seawater chemistry) durin g the LGM.  

# Operations  

After a $333.2\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1487, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1488 at $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local ship time; UTC $+~10~\mathrm{h}$ )  

on 20 November 2016. The original operations plan called for thre e holes: the first to APC refusal, estimated at $250~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , followed b y two holes to 300 mbsf using both the APC and XCB coring systems. We ultimately cored three holes using only the APC and HLAPC, with the deepest hole penetrating to ${\sim}315$ mbsf (Table T1).  

Hole U1488A was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic hardware to 300.4 mbsf (Cores 363-U1488A-1 H through 32H). Downhole formation temperature measurements using the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H (34.4 mbsf), 7H (62. 9 mbsf), 10H (91.4 mbsf), and 13H (119.9 mbsf), obtaining good results on all four deployments. We also collected high-resolution I W samples at a frequency of one $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ whole-round sample pe r section over the upper 150 mbsf of Hole U1488A. After Cores 31 H and 32H had excessive overpull and required drillover to extrac t them from the formation, we switched to the HLAPC and continued coring to 314.5 mbsf (Cores 33F through 35F). Because Core s 33F and 35F required drillover, indicating HLAPC refusal, we terminated coring. We collected $327.20\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $314.5\;\mathrm{m}$ o f coring $104.0\%$ recovery) in Hole U1488A.  

Hole U1488B was cored to 304.9 mbsf (Cores 363-U1488A-1 H through 33H) with the APC using orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. Cores 31H through 33H required drillover, indicatin g APC refusal, so we terminated coring. We collected $315.77\mathrm{~m~}$ o f core over $304.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.103.6\%$ recovery) in Hole U1488B.  

Hole U1488C was cored to recover material for the stratigraphi c splice over the upper 150 mbsf, because high-resolution IW sampling was conducted in Hole U1488A over this interval. APC corin g using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware proceeded to 159. 3 mbsf (Cores 363-U1488C-1H through 17H), where we terminate d coring. We collected $153.60\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over $159.3\mathrm{~m~}$ of corin g $(96.4\%$ recovery) in Hole U1488C. Operations at Site U1488 ende d at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 November. Total time spent at Site U1488 was 102. 5 h (4.3 days).  

A total of 82 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $781.74\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $764.6~\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $102.2\%$ recovery). W e also collected 3 HLAPC cores, retrieving $14.83\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ove r $14.1~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.105.2\%$ recovery). In total, we collected $796.57\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over $778.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $102.3\%$ recovery) at Site U1488.  

# Principal results  

We recovered an ${\sim}315\;\mathrm{m}$ succession of upper Miocene to recen t foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze to foraminifer–nannofossil ooz e in three holes at Site U1488. The sediment is assigned to a singl e lithologic unit (Figure F22). Siliciclastic (mainly clay minerals), siliceous (radiolarians, diatoms, sponge spicules, and silicoflagellates), and volcanogenic (ash) particles are present as minor sedimen t components. Authigenic sulfide precipitates and authigenic cla y minerals (e.g., smectite–chlorite) also occur as accessories. The sediment varies downhole with small changes in the color and abundances of different components. The upper ${\sim}50$ mbsf is compose d of light greenish gray clay- and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze, transitioning to greenish white foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooz e between ${\sim}50$ and ${\sim}250$ mbsf. The bottom part of the site (deepe r than ${\sim}250~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) is primarily yellowish white radiolarian/diatombearing foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze. Bioturbation is slight t o moderate. Three volcanic ash layers composed of fresh, angular, an d colorless glass shards are found at ${\sim}6.5$ , ${\sim}93$ , and ${\sim}100$ mbsf (Figur e F22).  

Site U1488 consists of a $315~\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of foraminiferrich nannofossil ooze with varying proportions of clay. Calcareou s microfossil assemblages and preservation are typical of a pelagic, relatively deepwater bathyal environment throughout the recovere d succession. Unlike previous sites (U1482–U1487), microfossil preservation at Site U1488 shows a marked increase in recrystallizatio n (foraminifers) and some fragmentation, etching, and overgrowt h (foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils) downhole. Biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic horizons indicate recovery of  a continuous sequence of pelagic sediment spanning the last ${\sim}10\,\,\mathrm{My}$ (Figure F23). The oldest sediment recovered at Site U1488 is constrained to be younger than ${\sim}10.47$ Ma by the absence of the planktonic foraminifer Paragloborotalia mayeri and older than $9.69\ \mathrm{Ma}$ by the presence of the calcareous nannofossil Catinaster coalitus. The Miocene/Pliocene boundary $(5.333\,\mathrm{Ma})$ is placed at $\mathord{\sim}149$ mbs f (Figure F22) based on linear interpolation between the biohorizo n base Ceratolithus armatus $(5.35\mathrm{~Ma})$ and biohorizon base Ceratolithus cristatus $(5.12\,\mathrm{Ma})$ . The base of the late Pliocene $\left(3.60\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ i s placed at ${\sim}92\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ between the biohorizon top Reticulofenestr a pseudoumbilicus $(3.70\mathrm{~Ma})$ and biohorizon top Sphenolithus abies $(3.54\,\mathrm{\Omega}\,M\mathbf{a})$ . The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary is placed at ${\sim}60$ mbsf, just below the base of Chron $C2\mathrm{r}2\mathrm{r}$ at 59.70 mbsf, and th e base of the middle Pleistocene is at the base of Chron C1n at ${\sim}19$ mbsf. The middle/late Pleistocene boundary is placed between th e biohorizon top $P_{\star}$ lacunosa $\left(0.44\mathrm{~Ma}\right)$ and biohorizon top $G_{\mathrm{{}}}$ . ruber (pink) $(0.12\,\mathrm{\:Ma})$ at $\sim\!\!12$ mbsf. Long-term average sedimentatio n rates through the late Miocene and Pliocene are remarkably consistent at ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . These rates roughly halve through the early Pleistocene $({\sim}2\mathrm{~\cm/ky})$ ,  before  increasing  in  the  middle  to  lat e Pleistocene $({\sim}3\,\mathrm{\cm/ky})$ (Figure F23). Benthic foraminifer assemblages are characteristic of intermediate to deep bathyal depths wit h Laevidentalina spp. and Uvigerina spp. as the dominant forms.  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1488 involved measurement of the NRM of archive-half sections from Hole U1488A, th e upper ${\sim}67\$ mbsf of Hole U1488B, and to $\mathord{\sim}102$ mbsf in Hole U1488 C before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15\;\mathrm{mT}.$ . Correcte d declination is largely coherent between cores; however, absolut e values in all holes cluster between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ for periods of normal polarity and between $270^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ}/360^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity, suggesting that the issues of a baseline offset experienced at the majority of sites during Expedition 363 and on previous expedition s also affected these measurements. Relatively soft ferrimagneti c minerals are concentrated in the uppermost ${\sim}45$ mbsf. Between ${\sim}45$ and ${\sim}50$ mbsf, $\mathrm{NRM}_{15\mathrm{mT}}$ , MS, and SIRM values decrease, and belo w ${\sim}50$ mbsf, average MS values fall to $0.6\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI. $\mathrm{NRM}_{15\mathrm{mT}},$ , mas s corrected MS $(\upchi)$ , and SIRM values deeper than ${\sim}50$ mbsf are ${\sim}2$ orders of magnitude lower than in the upper ${\sim}45$ mbsf and ofte n approach the noise level of their respective instruments, indicatin g a significant reduction in magnetic mineral concentration deepe r than ${\sim}50$ mbsf. We identify six $180^{\circ}$ shifts in declination in Hole s U1488A and U1488B and nine horizons in Hole U1488C (Figur e F23). The deepest of these are the Gauss/Matuyama boundar y $(2.582\;\mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}60$ mbsf in Holes U1488A and U1488B and the upper boundary of C2An.2n ( $^{\sim82}$ mbsf; 3.207 Ma) in Hole U1488 C (Figure F22).  

All physical properties at Site U1488 exhibit excellent reproducibility between holes. GRA bulk density shows an increasing tren d with depth from $1.4\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the seafloor to $1.8\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the botto m of the hole, likely caused by compaction. There is a break in thi s trend between ${\sim}245$ and 285 mbsf where values remain at ${\sim}1.75$ $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ before increasing to $1.8\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . $P$ -wave velocity also shows a n increasing trend with depth caused by compaction, increasing fro m $1500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}1600~\mathrm{m/s}$ at 310 mbsf. NGR values ar e ${\sim}25$ counts/s at the seafloor and then rapidly decrease to ${\sim}8$ counts/s by 8 mbsf. NGR gradually decreases to 2 counts/s over th e length of the record. MS also initially exhibits moderate susceptibility $({\sim}30\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI})$ before decreasing abruptly at ${\sim}45$ mbsf to value s averaging $<\!3\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ to the bottom of the site (Figure F22). Thermal conductivity increases from 0.9 to $1.3\ \mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ from the seafloor to the bottom of the hole. Deeper than 150 mbsf, the thermal conductivity slope decreases and variability increases. Downhol e formation temperature measurements indicate a geothermal gradient of $59^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ at Site U1488.  

We constructed a continuous splice for Site U1488 from 0 t o $324.89\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ using three holes (U1488A, U1488B, and U1488C). Tie points were established with WRMSL MS, GRA bulk density, and $P.$ -wave velocity data, as well as NGR and $L^{\ast}$ color reflectanc e data. Because the upper 150 mbsf (equivalent to ${\sim}162\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ ) o f Hole U1488A was heavily sampled (one 5 or $10~\mathrm{{cm}}$ whole-roun d sample per section) for high-resolution IW analyses, our general approach was to avoid using material from that interval in Hol e U1488A, as Hole U1488C was cored specifically to recover material for the splice. The splice is continuous and well constrained from  0 to $324.89\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF},$ although a few tentative tie points should be verified during postcruise research. Only Hole U1488A penetrate d deeper than $324.89\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, and therefore we appended the las t two cores of Hole U1488A to the bottom of the splice.  

At Site U1488, a total of 113 whole-round samples and one mudline sample were collected for IW analysis. High-resolution I W sampling was conducted in the upper 150 mbsf of Hole U1488A, with the goal of reconstructing the $\left[{{\bf{C}}{\bf{l}}-}\right]$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of UCDW durin g the LGM. The IW profiles at Site U1488 are controlled in large par t by carbonate diagenesis, with a minor influence of organic matte r remineralization in the uppermost 50 mbsf and a likely influence o f deep fluids deeper than 100 mbsf. In general, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ is the majo r constituent of the sediment of Site U1488, with an average conten t of $83.5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content increases with depth, from ${\sim}70\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ near the seafloor to ${>}90\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $\mathord{\sim}170$ mbsf. TOC content shows several stepwise decreases downhole, from ${\sim}0.5$ to $0.2\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in the uppermost 25 mbsf and then further decreases from $0.2\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ at ${\sim}170$ mbsf to minimal values that often are below the detection limit (Figure F22). TN content shows a similar trend with TOC content. Shallower than 80 mbsf, where both TOC and TN contents ar e above the detection limit, the C/N ratio is low, suggesting that th e majority of the organic matter is derived from marine production. Preliminary shipboard chlorinity measurements suggest that reconstruction of the salinity of UCDW will be possible with the sample s collected at this site.  

# Site U1489  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1489 (proposed Site WP-04A) is located on the wester n slope of the southern Eauripik Rise at $02^{\circ}07.19^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $141^{\circ}01.67^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ i n $3421\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F21). The site is situated on seismic reflection Profile RR1313 WP4-2 at the intersection with seismic reflection Profile RR1313 WP4-3. The seismic profile shows  a continuous succession of hemipelagic, carbonate-rich sedimen t with basement at ${>}650$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Site U1489 i s located ${\sim}81$ km west-northwest of Site U1488 and ${\sim}105~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of Site 62 and shows a similar sedimentary cover (Winterer e t al., 1971).  

Site U1489 is situated on the western slope of the southern par t of the Eauripik Rise, within the Caroline Basin north of PNG (Figur e F21). The roughly north–south trending Eauripik Rise is an ${\sim}250$ km wide aseismic ridge that rises ${\sim}1{-}2~\mathrm{km}$ above the surroundin g seafloor and separates the East and West Caroline Basins. Magneti c anomalies C13–C9 in both basins show that ocean crust forme d along roughly east–west spreading centers from the Eocene unti l the late Oligocene. Offsets in these anomalies and the lack of magnetic lineations beneath the Euaripik Rise supports the interpretation that it formed due to excess submarine volcanism along a leak y north–south transform fault (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988.) An alternative interpretation attributes the Euaripik Rise to the northwar d passage of a mantle hot spot that contributed to the tectonically an d structurally complex region surrounding Sorol Trough (Bracey, 1975). Seismic refractions show thickened ocean crust beneath th e Eauripik Rise, and a small free air anomaly and positive geoid anomaly indicate a compensated structure reaching deep into the mantl e (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988). Although there are no discernibl e magnetic lineations on Eauripik Rise, these data and the recovery o f tholeiitic basalt at DSDP Site 62 (Winterer et al., 1971) make it difficult to argue that it is a remanent of ancient continental material. The igneous rocks recovered from the bottom of Site 62 wer e slightly vesicular, highly altered, and contained calcite veins wit h well-preserved foraminifers and nannofossils. The dolomitizatio n of overlying limestone suggests that these basalts intruded into marine chalk, leading to extensive diagenetic reactions near the base o f the sedimentary succession.  

Site U1489 is located ${\sim}2^{\circ}$ north of the Equator and thus suitabl e for reconstructing the hydrographic history of the WPWP. Th e comparatively low sedimentation rate at this site allowed us to reac h the middle Miocene at a relatively shallow depth, which was no t possible at Site U1488, offering the opportunity to reconstruct th e evolution of the WPWP from the MMCO to the middle Miocen e climate transition associated with expansion of the Antarctic Ic e Sheet. At ${\sim}3400\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the site is bathed by LCDW, and hence usefu l to monitor past changes in modified LCDW (Figure F5A). Becaus e this site is close to Site U1488 but at ${\sim}900\mathrm{~m~}$ deeper water depth, comparing results from both sites also offers the opportunity to investigate potential diagenetic effects of foraminifer geochemica l proxy records. High-resolution IW sampling at this site will be use d for geochemical reconstructions of the deep Pacific water mas s $(\delta^{18}\mathrm{O},$ , salinity, and seawater chemistry) during the LGM.  

# Operations  

After a 44 nmi transit from Site U1488, the vessel stabilized ove r Site U1489 at $1442\,\mathrm{{h}}$ (all times are local ship time; $\mathrm{UTC}+10\,\mathrm{h})$ ) o n 24 November 2016. Site U1489 was an alternate site that was adde d during the expedition to complement the record cored at Sit e U1488. We initially planned to core three holes to 200 mbsf; however, we requested and received permission to core to 5.0 s TWT a t our site location on seismic reflection Profile RR1313 WP4-2. W e ultimately cored four holes at Site U1489 (Table T1). Hole U1489 A consisted of a single APC core, which indicated we missed the mudline. Hole U1489B was cored with the APC to 129.2 mbsf. We terminated coring in this hole because of coring difficulties tha t resulted in poor recovery and core disturbance. Hole U1489C wa s cored to 385.6 mbsf using a combination of APC, HLAPC, an d XCB. Hole U1489D was cored with the APC to 127.2 mbsf, drille d without coring to $274.0\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ , and then cored with the XCB to 385. 6 mbsf.  

Hole U1489A was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic hardware. Core 363-U1489A-1H recovered a full cor e barrel, indicating that we had missed the mudline, so we terminate d coring. We collected $9.53\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $9.5\textrm{m}$ of coring $.100.3\%$ recovery) in Hole U1489A.  

Hole U1489B was cored to 129.2 mbsf with the APC using orientation  and  nonmagnetic  hardware  (Cores  363-U1489B-1 H through 14H). Downhole formation temperature measurements using the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H (34.2 mbsf), 7H (62. 7 mbsf), 10H (91.2 mbsf), and 12H (110.2 mbsf); however, only on e measurement was of good quality (Core 10H). The measurement s taken while collecting Cores 4H and 7H showed possible tool movement related to heavy seas, and the measurement from Core 12 H was of very poor quality. We also collected high-resolution IW samples at a frequency of one $5{-}10\;\mathrm{cm}$ whole-round sample per sectio n over the entire cored succession in Hole U1489B. Coring difficultie s included premature failure of the APC shear pins caused by shi p motion on Cores 3H and 8H, as well as one core with no recover y (Core 11H) and two cores requiring a second coring attempt to retrieve the sediment (Cores 12H and 13H). As these cores appeare d very disturbed, we opted to terminate coring in Hole U1489B. W e collected $120.66\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $129.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(93.4\%$ recovery ) in Hole U1489B.  

Hole U1489C was cored to 269.5 mbsf (Cores 363-U1489C-1 H through 29H) with the APC using orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. Core 29H required drillover to extract it from the formation, indicating APC refusal. We switched to the HLAPC and core d only to 278.9 mbsf (Cores 30F and 31F) before excessive overpull indicated HLAPC refusal. We then switched to the XCB to core t o 385.6 mbsf (Cores 32X through 42X), where we terminated coring. We collected $376.35\:\mathrm{m}$ of core over $385.6\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(97.6\%$ recovery) in Hole U1489C.  

Hole U1489D was cored to recover material for the splice ove r the upper ${\sim}120$ mbsf that was heavily sampled for IW in Hol e U1489B and to collect a second copy of the deeper succession at Sit e U1489. Hole U1489D was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic hardware to 127.2 mbsf (Cores 363-U1489D-1 H through 14H). Because several of the APCT-3 measurements provide spurious results in Hole U1489B, we opted to take additional measurements in Hole U1489D while collecting Cores 4H (32. 2 mbsf), 7H (60.7 mbsf), 10H (89.2 mbsf), and 13H (117.7 mbsf). All four measurements provided good results. We drilled without coring from 127.2 to 274.0 mbsf and then cored using the XCB to 385. 6 mbsf (Cores 16X through 27X), where we terminated coring. W e collected $229.24\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $238.8~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(96.0\%$ recovery ) in Hole U1489D.  

Operations at Site U1489 ended at $0212\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 November. Total time spent at Site U1489 was $131.5~\mathrm{h}$ (5.5 days). We collected  a total of 58 APC cores, recovering $527.85\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $535.4~\mathrm{m}$ o f coring $98.6\%$ recovery). We also collected 2 HLAPC cores, recovering $9.05\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $9.4\textrm{m}$ of coring $(96.3\%$ recovery), and 2 3 XCB cores, retrieving $198.88\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $218.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of corin g $92.6\%$ recovery). In total, we collected $735.78\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment ove r $763.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(96.4\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

The recovered sedimentary succession at Site U1489 consists o f ${\sim}386\;\mathrm{m}$ of lower Miocene to recent nannofossil ooze and chalk wit h varying proportions of clay (Figure F24). Biosilica (especially radiolarians) is a major component in the lowermost part of the site. Th e recovered succession at Site U1489 is assigned to one lithologic uni t divided into two subunits. Subunit IA consists of ${\sim}280~\mathrm{m}$ of uppe r Miocene to recent light greenish gray foraminifer-bearing clay-ric h nannofossil ooze and white clay-bearing foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze, with clay content decreasing downhole. Color alternations occur at centimeter to meter scale and also include thinl y bedded pale yellow sediment. Grayish green and pale purple laminae are common in the upper part of Subunit IA. Soft-sediment deformation is a prominent feature in the lower part of Subunit I A (between ${\sim}100$ and $260~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and is characterized by a series o f large-scale soft-sediment deformation intervals intercalated wit h pelagic sediment. These intervals occasionally include coarsegrained foraminifer ooze or very thickly bedded homogeneous claybearing foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze. Subunit 1B consists o f ${\sim}112\;\mathrm{m}$ of lower to upper Miocene light greenish gray foraminiferbearing clay-rich chalk. Near the base of the subunit, biosilica becomes more abundant and the sediment transitions to pale yello w foraminifer-bearing radiolarian-rich chalk and light gray radiolarian-rich chalk. This subunit also shows color alternations between lighter and darker chalk, as well as minor soft-sedimen t deformation features. There is an abrupt change to white chalk a t the very base of the succession.  

We cored a $386\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of clay-bearing foraminiferrich nannofossil ooze and chalk with minor but significant amount s of biosilica in the lower part of the succession at Site U1489. Calcareous microfossil assemblages and preservation are typical of a pelagic, relatively deepwater bathyal environment throughout the site. Foraminifer preservation is generally good to very good in the upper part of the succession (Subunit IA) but is moderate to poor i n the chalk of Subunit IB. Calcareous nannofossil preservation als o decreases with depth, although this is most prevalent in the discoasters, which show significant overgrowth in the chalk. Th e planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratio is on the order of 99:1, although the benthic foraminifers Planulina wuellerstorfi and Cibicidoides mundulus are present in most of the samples examine d throughout the hole. Other common taxa include Laevidentalina spp.  

Integrated calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminife r biostratigraphy generally shows excellent congruence between bot h fossil groups and the magnetostratigraphy (Figure F25). The age a t the base of the succession is constrained to the early Miocene base d on the biohorizon base Sphenolithus belemnos at $\sim\!380$ mbsf and th e presence of Dentoglobigerina binaiensis and absence of Globigerinoides altiaperturus and Tenuitella munda at $\mathord{\sim}384$ mbsf. The Miocene/Pliocene  boundary  is  placed  at ${\sim}115$ mbsf,  above  th e biohorizon base Ceratolithus armatus. The Pliocene/Pleistocen e boundary is located at ${\sim}45$ mbsf based on the biohorizon top $D_{\ast}$ . surculus and the Matuyama/Gauss boundary (Figure F24). Long-ter m average sedimentation rates through the early to middle Miocen e were low $({\sim}0.3\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ . Average sedimentation rates in the late Miocene increased to ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ In the latest Miocene and earliest Pliocene, average sedimentation rates increased to ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ ; however, this interval is complicated by soft-sediment deformation, and th e estimated sedimentation rate is based on sparse bioevents (and n o magnetostratigraphic events). Above this interval of deformed sediment, Pliocene and Pleistocene sedimentation rates averaged ${\sim}2$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F25), which is comparable to those of the late Miocene at Site U1488.  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1489 involved measurement of the NRM of archive-half sections from Holes U1489A– U1489D before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ Corrected declination is largely coherent between cores; however, absolute values in Hole U1489B cluster around $90^{\circ}$ for periods o f normal polarity and around $270^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity, with the opposite being true ( $270^{\circ}$ for normal polarity and $90^{\circ}$ for reverse polarity) in Holes U1489C and U1489D. Relatively soft ferrimagneti c minerals are concentrated in the uppermost ${\sim}90$ mbsf. Between ${\sim}90$ and 100 mbsf, $\mathrm{NRM}_{15\mathrm{mT}}$ , MS, and SIRM values decrease, and deepe r than ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{mbsf}_{2}$ , average MS, $\mathrm{NRM}_{15\mathrm{mT}}$ , mass corrected MS (χ), an d SIRM values are ${\sim}1{-}2$ orders of magnitude lower than in the uppe r ${\sim}90$ mbsf and often approach the noise level of their respective instruments. This indicates a significant reduction in magnetic mineral concentration deeper than ${\sim}100$ mbsf. We identify up t o twenty-two $180^{\circ}$ shifts in declination in Holes U1489B–U1489 D (Figure F25). The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary (0.781 Ma) i s placed at ${\sim}15$ mbsf, the Matuyama/Gauss boundary $(2.581\ \mathrm{Ma})$ a t ${\sim}45$ mbsf, and the Gauss/Gilbert boundary $(3.596\,\mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}65\$ mbsf. The deepest of these declination shifts is identified as the uppe r boundary of the Thvera normal (C3n.3r; 4.997 Ma) at ${\sim}101$ mbs f (Figure F24).  

All physical properties measurements are generally reproducible across holes with the exception of some intervals in Hol e U1489B that are likely due to core disturbance during recovery. GRA bulk density increases downhole from ${\sim}1.3$ to $1.8\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , wit h an increase in variability deeper than 270 mbsf caused by an increase in sediment induration coincident with the switch to XC B coring. MS at Site U1489 starts with relatively high values of ${\sim}20~\times~$ $10^{-5}$ to $60\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ in the upper 90 mbsf, with distinct cyclicity tha t transitions from 1–3 to $0.4–0.6\mathrm{~m~}$ scale at 21 mbsf. MS values between 90 and 260 mbsf are extremely low $\!\!\!\langle<\!3\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}\rangle$ in the lightcolored sediment but increase to a mean of $\sim\!9\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI betwee n 260 and 385 mbsf (Figure F24). NGR deceases rapidly from 30 to 1 0 counts/s over the upper 5 mbsf and then gradually decreases to ${<}1$ counts/s by the bottom of the hole $({\sim}385~\mathrm{mbsf})$ . There are two intervals of slightly higher NGR counts between 55 and 84 mbsf an d between 310 and 360 mbsf that correspond to higher clay content i n the sediment (Figure F24). In general, the short-term cyclicity i n MS and NGR coincide with light–dark variations in the sediment. In general, $P$ -wave velocities increase slightly and increase in variability with depth. Discrete bulk density measurements display a n ${\sim}0.05\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ offset in the uppermost 265 mbsf compared with GR A bulk density. Below 265 mbsf, where the sediment became indurated and XCB coring commenced, the variability of GRA bulk density increases and the MAD bulk density values correspond well with the highest values of the GRA bulk density. Thermal conductivity increases with depth from $\mathord{\sim}0.9$ to $1.3\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}})$ , similar to th e MAD bulk density and dry density, which is likely primarily due t o compaction. Downhole formation temperatures were measured i n both Holes U1489B and U1489D, as the APCT-3 tool showed evidence of movement in some of the measurements taken in Hol e U1489B. The more reliable measurements from Hole U1489D confirmed the results from Hole U1489B and indicate a geothermal gradient of $31^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ .  

Stratigraphic correlations between holes at Site U1489 primaril y used WRMSL MS data and were aided by additional whole-roun d measurements of GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, NGR, and $L^{\ast}$ measured on split cores. Overlap between holes provided two continuous spliced intervals from 0 to $140.95\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ and from 305.7 0 to $371.25\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF. The interval between these spliced sections corresponds to the interval of soft-sediment deformation in the lowe r part of Subunit IA and was cored only once. Gaps between an additional five cores deeper than $371.25\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ in both Holes U1489 C and U1489D prevented the construction of a deeper continuou s spliced section.  

A total of 100 whole-round samples and one mudline sampl e were collected for IW analysis at Site U1489. High-resolution I W sampling was conducted in the upper 128 mbsf at this site, with th e goal of reconstructing the [Cl–] and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of LCDW during th e  

LGM. Carbonate diagenesis and minor amounts of organic matte r remineralization are the dominant controls on the IW chemistry, along with upward diffusion from a deep fluid source. Muted trend s in $\left[\mathbf{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ , $\left[\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}\right].$ , and $\left[\mathrm{Li^{+}}\right]$ suggest a weaker influence of deep fluid s with chemistry reflective of basalt–seawater interaction at this sit e relative to Site U1488. Differences in basement age and sedimen t thickness between the two sites likely contribute to the observe d differences. Calcium carbonate content averages $82\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ and increases with depth from ${\sim}50~\mathrm{wt\%}$ near the seafloor to ${>}90\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ a t $\mathord{\sim}175$ mbsf. TOC is low (average $=\sim\!0.14\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and varies between  0 and $0.8\:\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F24), which is reflected in the moderate degre e of sulfate depletion and low concentrations of bromide, ammonium, and phosphate. Nitrogen was detected in trace amounts. Preliminary shipboard chlorinity measurements suggest that reconstruction of the salinity of LCDW will be possible with the sample s collected at this site.  

# Site U1490  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1490 (proposed Site WP-02A) is located on the norther n edge of the Eauripik Rise at $05^{\circ}48.95^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ , $142^{\circ}39.27\,\mathrm{E}$ in $2341\;\mathrm{m}$ wate r depth (Figure F21). The site is situated on seismic reflection Profil e RR1313 WP2-1, ${\sim}3.6~\mathrm{km}$ east of the intersection with seismic reflection Profile RR1313 WP2-6. The seismic profile shows a continuous succession of hemipelagic, carbonate-rich sediment. At Sit e U1490, horizontally bedded layers continue downhole to ${\sim}0.07$ s TWT below the seafloor, where reflector geometry shows a dramatic change in depositional process. From ${\sim}3.26\$ to ${\sim}3.60\;s$ TWT, there is an apparently uninterrupted accumulation of current-controlled mud waves, with the exception of a possible break at 3.27  s TWT (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Other MCS lines in the survey gri d surrounding Site U1490 show these features as well. They are abou t $1\;\mathrm{km}$ in wavelength, oriented southwest–northeast (perpendicula r to seismic reflection Profile RR1313 WP2-1), with $15{-}18\ \mathrm{m}$ maximum amplitude that gradually decreases upsection, possibly reflecting  a  several-million-year  record  of  current-controlle d bedforms.  

Site U1490 is located ${\sim}431$ km north of Site U1488 at the northern end of the Eauripik Rise (Figure F21), where it terminates in  a tectonically complex region that includes the Sorol Fault, Soro l Trough, and Caroline Ridge (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988). Th e roughly north–south trending Eauripik Rise is an ${\sim}250~\mathrm{km}$ wid e aseismic ridge that rises ${\sim}1{-}2~\mathrm{km}$ above the surrounding seafloo r and separates the East and West Caroline Basins. Magnetic Anomalies C13–C9 in both basins show that ocean crust formed alon g roughly east–west spreading centers from the Eocene until the lat e Oligocene. Offsets in these anomalies and the lack of magnetic lineations beneath the Euaripik Rise supports the interpretation that i t formed due to excess submarine volcanism along a leaky north– south transform fault (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988.) An alternativ e interpretation attributes the Euaripik Rise to the northward passag e of a mantle hot spot that contributed to the tectonically and structurally complex region surrounding Sorol Trough (Bracey, 1975).  

Site U1490 is located ${\sim}6^{\circ}$ north of the Equator and thus is suitable for reconstructing the hydrographic history of the norther n part of the WPWP. The comparatively low sedimentation rate a t this site will be used along with the record from Site U1488 to reconstruct the evolution of the WPWP since the late Miocene. A t ${\sim}2300~\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , the site is bathed by modified UCDW and hence ma y be used to monitor past changes in this water mass.  

# Operations  

After a $242\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1489, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1490 at $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local ship time; $\mathrm{UTC}+10\,\mathrm{h})$ on 1 December 2016. The original operations plan called for tw o APC holes to 250 mbsf and a third APC hole to 150 mbsf. With ${\sim}2$ days of contingency remaining, we opted to deepen Hole U1490A t o XCB refusal $382.8\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ , core Hole U1490B to HLAPC refusal $(292.9\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ , and then use the remaining time to core as deeply a s possible in Hole U1490C $170.0\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ (Table T1).  

Hole U1490A was cored to 251.2 mbsf (Cores 363-U1490A-1 H through 27H) with the APC using orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. Downhole formation temperature measurements usin g the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H (32.7 mbsf), 7H (61.2 mbsf), 10H (89.7 mbsf), 13H (118.2 mbsf), and 16H (146.7 mbsf), wit h some tool movement detected on two of the runs (Cores 4H an d 10H). Cores 25H through 27H experienced excessive overpull an d required drillover to extract them from the formation, indicatin g APC refusal. We switched to the HLAPC and continued coring t o 270.0 mbsf (Cores 28F through 31F), where excessive overpull an d drillover indicated HLAPC refusal. We then cored with the XCB t o 376.7 mbsf (Cores 32X through 42X). While cutting Core 43X, th e rate of penetration slowed dramatically, so we retrieved the core after only a $5.6~\mathrm{m}$ advance. The XCB showed extensive wear, and  a small amount of chert was recovered at the bottom of the core. Cor e 44X advanced only $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$ over $45~\mathrm{min}$ , so we terminated coring. N o core was recovered, and the XCB cutting shoe had lost all of its carbide teeth. We collected $367.35\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $382.8\mathrm{~m~}$ of corin g $(96.0\%$ recovery) in Hole U1490A.  

Hole U1490B was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic hardware to 228.0 mbsf (Cores 363-U1490B-1 H through 25H). Core 25H required drillover to extract it from th e formation, and the core liner had to be pumped out of the core barrel. We switched to the HLAPC and continued to core to a total depth of 262.9 mbsf (Cores 26F through 33F). We terminated corin g in Hole U1490B when Core 33F required drillover. We retrieve d $267.60\ \mathrm{m}$ of core over $258.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $103.4\%$ recovery) in Hol e U1490B.  

Hole U1490C was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic  hardware  to  170  mbsf  (Cores  363-U1490C-1 H through 20H). Coring was terminated when a ground fault was detected in the top drive motor that could not be repaired within th e amount of time remaining for coring operations $(\sim\!18~\mathrm{h})$ . The drill bit was pulled clear of the seafloor at $1017~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 December an d retrieved to the rig floor. The vessel was secured for transit, and w e departed for Guam at $0542\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December, ending operations a t Site U1490. A total of $125.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (5.2 days) was spent on Site U1490.  

We collected 69 APC cores, recovering $662.07\mathrm{~m~}$ of core ove r $641.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.103.3\%$ recovery), and 11 HLAPC cores, retrieving $53.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $51.7~\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $:103.9\%$ recovery). We als o collected 13 XCB cores, recovering $87.42\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $112.8\;\mathrm{m}$ o f coring $(77.5\%$ recovery). Overall core recovery for Site U1490 wa s $803.19\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $805.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $\left(99.8\%\right)$ .  

# Principal results  

We recovered an ${\sim}380\,\mathrm{m}$ sequence of upper Oligocene to recen t sediment that contains calcareous microfossils (mainly nannofossil s and foraminifers), siliceous microfossils (radiolarians, diatoms, an d sponge spicules), clay minerals, and volcanic ash. The sediment i s assigned to one unit divided into three subunits based primarily o n downhole variations in biosilica, clay minerals, and ash (Figur e F26). Subunit IA ( ${\sim}185\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) includes a sequence of upper Miocene to recent foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze with variable bu t generally low amounts of clay. Coarser, decimeter-thick layers dominated by foraminifer ooze are also present. In Subunit IB (late earl y to early late Miocene; ${\sim}78~\mathrm{m}$ thick), clay minerals become a significant component of the sediment, and their abundance increase s downhole. The primary lithology in Subunit IB is clay-rich foraminifer-nannofossil ooze. Biosilica (mainly sponge spicules and radiolarians) is also one of the sediment constituents of this subunit. Subunit IC is ${\sim}124\mathrm{\;m}$ thick and was deposited during the late Oligocene to the middle Miocene. The uppermost ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ of this subuni t is composed of greenish radiolarian-rich nannofossil ooze, wherea s the remainder of the subunit is radiolarian-rich chalk. Discrete, dark gray to black partially indurated layers and nodules and indurated rock fragments (cherts) are exclusively found in this subunit. The number, thickness, and degree of induration of these layers increase downhole. Siliceous particles, either volcanic glass and/o r biosilica (radiolarians, sponge spicules, and diatoms), are the dominant lithologic component of these layers, although calcareou s components are also occasionally present.  

Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers are presen t throughout the ${\sim}380\mathrm{~m~}$ sequence recovered at Site U1490. Planktonic foraminifer preservation is very good to good for most of th e succession, although it decreases to moderate to poor in the chalk o f Subunit IC, whereas calcareous nannofossil preservation is moderate through most of the succession. Benthic foraminifers indicate  a deepwater environment, and the planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratio is $<\!99{:}1$ throughout the succession. The assemblages are simila r to those from other Eauripik Rise sites (U1488 and U1489). Th e most common species are Laevidentalina spp., Planulina wuellerstorfi, and Oridorsalis umbonatus.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicate that the recovered succession spans the latest Oligocene to recent (Figure F27). A series of paleomagnetic reversal s identified in the lower and middle Miocene interval correlate wel l with the biostratigraphic datums. There is no evidence of hiatuses, but the uppermost ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ of the site is complicated because of upward reworking of calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer marker species. The age at the base of the succession i s constrained to ${\sim}24$ Ma based on extrapolation through Oligocene/Miocene boundary biohorizons and the appearance of common Cyclicargolithus abisectus $({\sim}24\,\mathrm{\Omega}\,\mathrm{Ma})$ at the base of the hol e (Figure F27). The Oligocene/Miocene boundary is placed at $\mathord{\sim}340$ mbsf based on the presence of Sphenolithus delphix. The Miocene/Pliocene boundary is located at ${\sim}90$ mbsf between the biohorizon  bases  C.  cristatus  and $C.$ .  armatus,  and  th e Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary is approximated by the biohorizo n top $D.$ surculus at ${\sim}35$ mbsf (Figure F26). The sedimentation rat e appears to have been near constant for long periods, separated b y four inflection points at 3.60, 5.33, 9.11, and $22.25\:\mathrm{Ma}$ , the last thre e of which correspond to marked changes in lithology. Average sedimentation rates were ${\sim}4.7\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the latest Oligocene, ${\sim}0.88$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the early and middle Miocene, $1.57\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the late Miocene, $2.9\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the early Pliocene, and $1.4\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{ky}$ in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene (Figure F27).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1490 involved measurement of the NRM of archive-half sections from Holes U1490A– U1490C before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ We measured the entire sediment succession in Hole U1490A bu t ceased measurement between ${\sim}36$ and 161.5 mbsf in Hole U1490 B and below ${\sim}31$ mbsf in Hole U1490C as data quality decreased an d became  increasingly  uninterpretable.  Corrected  declination  i s largely coherent between cores; however, absolute values in Hole s U1490A and U1490B cluster around $270^{\circ}$ for periods of normal polarity and around $90^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity. For Hole U1490C, n o baseline offset is observed and corrected declination during intervals of normal polarity cluster around $0^{\circ}/360^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ for reverse d polarity. In the upper ${\sim}16$ mbsf, WRMSL MS data, mass correcte d MS $(\upchi)$ , and SIRM values suggest moderately low (ferri)magneti c mineral concentration. Between ${\sim}16$ and 175 mbsf, average MS dat a decrease to negative values, associated with the diamagnetic properties of carbonate that dominate the sediment and an almost complete absence of ferrimagnetic minerals. Below $\mathord{\sim}168$ mbsf, discret e MS data and SIRM begin to steadily increase associated wit h greater proportions of clay and ash in the sediment. We identif y fifty distinct $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ shifts in declination in Holes U1490A–U1490 C (Figure F27). We observe five reversals in the youngest part of th e succession, including the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary at ${\sim}8$ mbsf. Deeper than ${\sim}170$ mbsf, we observe 45 geomagnetic reversals wit h an almost complete record from the upper boundary of C4A n (8.771 Ma; $\mathord{\sim}171$ mbsf) to the upper boundary of C6n ( $18.748\ \mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; ${\sim}263\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) in Hole U1490B (Figure F26).  

All physical property measurements are generally reproducibl e among the three holes at Site U1490. GRA and discrete sample bul k density generally agree well in terms of long-term trends and shortterm variability. The upper 3 mbsf is characterized by the transitio n away from the mudline, with a rapid increase in GRA bulk densit y and decrease in NGR (Figure F26). GRA bulk density linearly increases from ${\sim}1.6~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the top of the hole to ${\sim}1.9~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at 23 0 mbsf, which is related to increased compaction at depth. MS is extremely low between 20 and 180 mbsf, with average values around – $0.8\;\times\;10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , corresponding to light-colored sediment with hig h carbonate content (nannofossil ooze) (Figure F26). MS increases t o ${\sim}7~\times~10^{-5}$ SI, and $P$ -wave velocity increases from $\mathord{\sim}1500$ to ${\sim}1700$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ at $\mathord{\sim}180$ mbsf, coincident with increased clay content in Subuni t IB. Between 230 and 270 mbsf, a second transition is evident in all of the physical properties, with GRA bulk density decreasing fro m ${\sim}1.9$ to ${\sim}1.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , which coincides with the highest peaks in MS, with values up to $20\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}.$ . A broad MS maximum with values u p to ${\sim}330~\times~10^{-5}$ SI is concurrent with the first major peak of ${\sim}8$ counts/s in NGR at ${\sim}255$ mbsf, which coincides with an indurate d ash layer (Figure F26). Deeper than 270 mbsf (Subunit IC), we observe a general increase in the short-term variability of all physical properties, with values ranging from 1.5 to $1.9\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for GRA bul k density, an increase in average MS to $\sim\!10\times10^{-5}$ SI with peaks frequently reaching $\sim\!200\times10^{-5}$ to $300\times10^{-5}$ , NGR peaks frequentl y reaching ${\sim}4$ counts/s and occasionally reaching ${\sim}15$ counts/s in th e volcanogenic-rich dark layers, and $P$ -wave velocities increasin g from $\mathord{\sim}1540$ to ${\sim}1960~\mathrm{m/s}$ . This large variability is also observed i n dry density, grain density, porosity, and thermal conductivity. Thi s interval is associated with the presence of black layers consisting o f silica mixed with volcanogenic material, which become more indurated downhole.  

Stratigraphic correlation between holes at Site U1490 primaril y used Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) color reflectanc e data, mainly redness $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\right)$ and luminosity $(\mathbb{L}^{*})$ , as well as WRMS L MS data. In addition, we also used WRMSL GRA bulk density an d NGR data. We constructed a splice for the entire site using all thre e holes. The splice is continuous and well constrained from 0 t o $295.95\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, with the exception of one gap at $258.01\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ There are also a few tentative tie points that should be verifie d during postcruise research.  

A total of 36 IW samples and one mudline sample were collected from Hole U1490A for geochemical analyses, spanning fro m 0 to 326 mbsf. Sampling for IW chemistry was halted deeper tha n 326 mbsf due to biscuiting and subpar recovery of core. IW geochemistry indicates relatively weak remineralization of organic matter throughout the sediment column resulting from low TO C content ranging from 0 to $1.0\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ and averaging only $0.2\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F26). Low dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations in the shallowes t sediment at the site suggest minimal suboxic remineralization of organic matter, and significant sulfate $(>\!21\mathrm{~mM})$ is present at depth. High carbonate content $(\sim\!94\;\mathrm{wt\%})$ in the upper 230 mbsf is associated with a Sr IW profile indicating a moderate degree of carbonat e recrystallization and/or dissolution. Major cation and anion concentration profiles are dominated by upward diffusion from  a deeper fluid source with a geochemical signature characteristic o f basalt–  and/or  volcanogenic  sediment–seawater  interaction. Marked depletion of $\left[\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}\right]$ and enrichment of $\left[{{C}{\bf{a}}^{+}}\right]$ at this site suggest a unique deep fluid source and possible compositional variability of underlying basalt along the Eauripik Rise. Lower and mor e variable carbonate content deeper than 230 mbsf coincides wit h clay- and radiolarian-rich intervals and the presence of frequent as h layers.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 363 sought to document the regional expression o f climate variability (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and productivity) in the IPWP as it relates to the evolution of Earth’s climate fro m the middle Miocene to late Pleistocene on millennial, orbital, an d geological timescales. To achieve these objectives, we selected site s with a wide geographical distribution and variable depositional environments. The sites are strategically located at the heart of th e WPWP, off northern PNG and on the Eauripik Rise south of Guam, as well as on its western edge along the northwest margin of Australia to capture the most salient features of the IPWP (Figures F1, F3). Combining sites with rapidly accumulating sediment at marginal locations and more typical open-ocean sites with relatively low accumulation  rates  offers  the  opportunity  to  trace  the  Neogen e evolution of the IPWP at different temporal resolutions. Furthermore, the large range of water depths (Figure F5) allows reconstruction  of  the  thermocline  and  intermediate-  and  deepwate r contributions from the Northern and Southern Hemisphere to th e low-latitude interocean exchange through the ITF as well as monitoring changes in intermediate and deeper water masses in response to tectonic- or climate-related processes.  

Nine sites were cored during Expedition 363, two off northwes t Australia and seven in the WPWP, recovering an IODP record tota l of $6956\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment in 875–3421 m water depth with an averag e recovery of $101.3\%$ during 39.6 days of on-site operations (Tabl e T1). Most of the sites were cored primarily using the APC syste m until refusal, which was generally encountered between 250 and 35 0 mbsf (Figure F4). One hole (U1482C) was cored to 534 mbsf on th e northwest Australian margin and was logged. This is substantiall y more than the original primary operations plan targeting sedimen t recovery of $6015\;\mathrm{m}$ at seven sites and downhole logging at one sit e (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Potential security risks in Mindanao, Philippines, precluded us from conducting operations at proposed Sit e WP-09A in the Davao Bay, offshore South Mindanao; instead, w e followed the alternate operations plan that included drilling severa l additional sites in the WPWP. Two alternate sites at distal locations, proposed Site WP-13A on the Benham Rise (near DSDP Site 292 )  

and proposed Site WP-15A on the Ontong Java Plateau (at the location of ODP Site 806), were not cored due to time limitation. Overall, clement weather and smooth seas allowed for speedy transits t o drilling locations, and there was no significant loss of operational time due to mechanical breakdown or equipment damage.  

Our scientific objectives required a wide spatial distribution o f IPWP climate records with variable sedimentation rates in a variet y of geologic settings. Sites U1482 and U1483 are adjacent to some o f the world’s oldest preserved in situ ocean crust, just seaward of th e continental slope of northwest Australia. Sites U1484 and U148 5 are in a fore-arc region south of the New Guinea Trench. Site s U1486 and U1487 are on upper Pliocene ocean crust of the adjacen t Manus Basin in the northern Bismarck Sea. Sites U1488, U1489, and U1490 are located on upper Oligocene ocean crust of the Caroline microplate (Figure F28). The high quality of cores recovered a s well as the extensive documentation of the geological, biostratigraphic, paleomagnetic, and geochemical background (Figures F29, F30, F31, F32, F33, F34) and the excellent to good preservation o f foraminifer shells and calcareous nannofossils at most sites (Figur e F35) will allow us to meet and even exceed all of the expedition’ s primary objectives.  

# Primary objectives  

# 1. Investigate millennial-scale climate variability in the WPWP.  

Sites U1484 and U1485 are located ${\sim}15$ and $19\,\mathrm{km}$ , respectively , offshore of the northern coast of PNG (Figure F12) in relativel y shallow water depths (1030 and $1145~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , respectively). The proximity to land and to the Sepik River mouth results in high sedimentation rates exceeding $50\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{ky},$ , making the sites highly suitable fo r investigating Holocene and late to middle Pleistocene centennial- t o millennial-scale climate variability. Biostratigraphy suggests tha t ages at Sites U1484 and U1485 extend possibly to ${\sim}290\,\mathrm{ka}$ and ${>}400$ ka, respectively (Figure F30). The presumed interglacial sedimen t consists of clay-rich nannofossil ooze, whereas the glacial interval s contain abundant sand and silt layers interbedded within the clayrich sediment (Figure F29). The appearance of sand layers at bot h sites is likely related to enhanced riverine deposition during period s of sea-level lowstands and off-shelf transport events and potentiall y offers a detailed record of millennial-scale hydroclimate variabilit y during glacial intervals.  

The sediment is rich in organic matter compared to typical pelagic sediment, with wood fragments visible on split core surfaces, and foraminifer preservation is excellent (Figure F35), providing th e opportunity to reconstruct climate variations with a resolutio n comparable to that of ice cores, North Atlantic sediment drifts, an d Southeast Asian speleothem records. These new records will allo w better constraints of the mechanisms influencing millennial-scal e variability and its effects on temperature and precipitation in thi s region. The recovery of expanded sections from several previous interglacials (e.g., MIS 5e and possibly MIS 11) and glacials offers th e possibility to assess if Holocene trends are typical of previous interglacials with similar orbital forcings or if late Holocene climate wa s already affected by anthropogenic $C O_{2}$ .  

# 2. Reconstruct orbital-scale climate variability through the Neogene.  

All sites cored during Expedition 363 resolve orbital-scale variability at moderate to high resolution (Figure F30). Site U148 3 northwest of Australia and Sites U1486 and U1487 in the Manu s Basin provide extended upper Pliocene to recent successions at exceptionally high resolution $(6{-}10\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ for these regions. Sit e U1482 northwest of Australia and Sites U1488–U1490 on the Eauripik Rise provide lower resolution records over longer timescales. Sites U1482 and U1488 cover the late Miocene at a resolution of $^{3-}$ $6\,\mathrm{{cm}/\mathrm{{ky},}}$ whereas Sites U1489 and U1490 extend to the middle an d early Miocene, respectively, at a resolution of ${\sim}1\mathrm{-}2\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . With excellent recovery, these sites are highly suitable for detailed paleoceanographic  and  paleoclimatic  reconstructions  through  th e middle Miocene to Pleistocene at orbital and suborbital resolutio n comparable with records across the Pacific Ocean and in othe r ocean basins. Specifically, pairing of northwest Australian sites a t the edge of the IPWP with sites at the heart of the WPWP will allo w us to document the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitatio n variability in the IPWP under different climate background states i n relation to changes in radiative forcing $\mathrm{{CO}_{2}}$ and insolation) to better constrain climate sensitivity throughout the Neogene. Spannin g a large bathymetric depth (Figure F5), these sites are also suitabl e for reconstructing changes in intermediate and deep-water properties (e.g., temperature and carbonate chemistry) related to the formation processes of these water masses in high-latitude seas, ocea n circulation, and ice-volume fluctuations through time.  

The $5{-}13\,\mathrm{Ma}$ interval is a poorly constrained part of the geological timescale, mainly because of incomplete recovery in both marine and land-based sections, which hampers refinement an d verification of astronomical tuning and isotope stratigraphy. Although physical property parameters and bulk isotopes can provid e useful high-resolution, local climate records, developing a well-constrained benthic stable isotope chronostratigraphy is essential fo r the correlation of climatic events on a global scale and anchorin g the Neogene geological timescale. The northwest Australian Sit e U1482 and the Eauripik Rise Sites U1488–U1490 recovered reasonably well-preserved, extended upper Miocene sediment succession s from multiple holes (Figure F29), allowing construction of uninterrupted splices that have high potential for further calibration of th e Neogene timescale. Eauripik Rise Site U1490 additionally has  a well-defined shipboard magnetostratigraphy over the ${\sim}9$ to ${\sim}19\,\mathrm{Ma}$ interval (Figure F32), offering an outstanding opportunity to directly correlate magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and benthi c isotope cyclostratigraphy over this entire interval.  

3. Reconstruct the Miocene to late Pleistocene evolution of the Australian monsoon.  

The forcing and feedback processes that drive and respond t o short- and long-term variability of the Indo-Asian-Australian monsoon system remain highly controversial. This controversy is largel y due to the fact that this large-scale, low-latitude climate feature consists of several regional subsystems that are intricately linke d through the seasonal migration of the ITCZ but exhibit distinct seasonality of rainfall and wind patterns and different responses t o forcings (Figure F36). Sites U1482 and U1483, located off of northwest Australia (Figure F7), are highly suitable to trace the long-ter m history of the Australian monsoon subsystem from the late Miocen e to late Pleistocene. The influence of the warm Leeuwin Current a t these sites (Figure F6) and their proximity to land will allow assessment of the Australian monsoon’s sensitivity to insolation forcin g and climate boundary conditions such as global ice volume an d greenhouse gas concentrations as well as regional SST changes. These new climate records will also be used to investigate the temporal and regional coupling between different monsoonal subsystems and, in particular, the timing of major reorganizations in win d (driving upwelling and productivity) and precipitation (altering salinity and terrigenous runoff) patterns. The Site U1482 records will also shed light on the synchroneity and repercussions of the lat e Miocene biogenic blooms through the Pacific and Indian Ocean s and linkages with low- and high-latitude climate change. Furthermore, Expedition 363 will provide a Southern Hemisphere perspective, complementing the overarching goal of several Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program and recent IODP expeditions (Expeditio n 346: Asian Monsoon, Expedition 353: Indian Monsoon Rainfall, Expedition 355: Arabian Sea Monsoon, Expedition 359: Maldive s Monsoon and Sea Level, and Expedition 356: Indonesian Throughflow) to unravel the evolution and variability of Indo-Asian-Australian monsoon subsystems over multiple timescales.  

# 4. Reconstruct changes in the ITF through the Neogene.  

At present, ITF variability is strongly related to tropical dynamics and in particular to the seasonal reversal of monsoonal wind s driven by the latitudinal displacement of the ITCZ. However, o n millennial and orbital scales, high-latitude processes and sea-level changes might have exerted a major influence on ITF variability. O n longer timescales, tectonically driven changes in the Indonesia n seaways might have altered the balance between Northern an d Southern Hemisphere–sourced water contributing to the ITF (Figure F6), which in turn could have impacted global climate. In th e modern ocean, the main ITF transport occurs within the thermocline. Therefore, we expect that comparing changes in the thermocline structure of sites located in the heart of the WPWP, the sourc e region for the ITF, and off northwest Australia/Timor Sea, wher e the ITF exits into the Indian Ocean, will allow reconstruction o f changes in the ITF transport on different timescales. Specifically, records of surface and thermocline temperatures from Sites U148 2 (northwest Australia) and U1488 (the Eauripik Rise) should allo w for distinguishing between broad equatorial responses to global climate change and ITF-related response to the tectonic evolution o f the Indonesian seaways from the late Miocene to present. Highe r sedimentation rates at Sites U1483 (off northwest Australia) an d U1486/U1487 (Manus Basin) will allow for a more detailed reconstruction of ITF variability at orbital and millennial timescale s through the entire Pleistocene.  

# 5. Assess the density structure of the western equatorial Pacific during the LGM.  

Because our sites span a large water depth range (Figures F5) , we conducted high-resolution (one sample per section) IW sampling from the seafloor to as deep as 150 mbsf at four Pacific sites. These IW samples will be used to assess the density structure of th e western equatorial Pacific during the LGM. High-resolution I W sampling at Sites U1488 and U1489 will serve to generate densit y profiles of the western equatorial Pacific deep water during th e LGM based on precise $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and chlorinity measurements. Shipboard analyses indicate that these sites are the least affected by exchange reactions with basement rocks and clay minerals and sho w the expected diffusion profile, making them most suitable for thi s purpose. At two other sites where high-resolution sampling too k place (Sites U1485 and U1486), shipboard measurements sugges t that interactions with basement rock and/or clay diagenesis have  a strong influence on the profiles. Therefore, measurements of oxygen and strontium isotopes will help us to understand the basement–sediment interactions and diagenetic processes at these sites.  

6. Use interstitial water profiles to reconstruct diagenetic processes and their implications for seawater composition.  

The large variability in the geologic settings and lithologies o f Expedition 363 sites provide the opportunity to study diageneti c processes under various depositional conditions. IW profiles a t marginal Sites U1484 and U1485 (off northern PNG) and Site s U1486 and U1487 (Manus Basin), which are rich in volcanogeni c sediment (Figure F29), are strongly influenced by organic matter remineralization and exchange reactions with basement rock and cla y minerals. The IW samples taken at these sites offer the opportunit y for investigating diagenetic processes with emphasis on understanding silicate weathering and dissolution using various isotop e systems (e.g., Si, S, Sr, and U isotopes). Splits of IW samples wer e taken from the pelagic, carbonate-rich sediment at Sites U1488– U1490 for the purpose of reconstructing past seawater chemistr y and investigating carbonate diagenesis (e.g., by measuring B, Ca, and Mg isotopes).  

# Additional highlights  

# Late Miocene to Holocene depositional history of the northwest Australian margin  

The ages assigned to the sedimentary successions recovered a t northwest Australian Sites U1482 and U1483 (Figures F9, F11, F30 ) diverge substantially from previous ages estimated from wireline lo g data calibrated with stratigraphic and lithologic data from well cuttings (see figures AF5–AF7 and AF9–AF11 in Rosenthal et al., 2016). Following regional seismic projections, we anticipated reaching two prominent reflectors corresponding to (1) a middle Miocene unconformity $({\sim}14\mathrm{~Ma})$ at $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbsf at Site U1482 and (2)  a late Miocene unconformity $\left(\sim\!6\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ at ${\sim}250$ mbsf at Site U1482 an d at $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf at Site U1483. However, the ages at the base of Site s U1482 $\mathrm{\sim}535\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ and U1483 $(\mathrm{{\sim}}293\,\mathrm{{mbsf}})$ are ${\sim}10.5$ and ${<}3.6\,M\mathbf{a}$ , respectively (Figure F30). These ages are considerably younger tha n was expected at these depths, implying that sedimentation rates i n this region differ markedly from previous estimates based on seismic stratigraphy. These new ages will trigger reinterpretation of unconformities  and  depositional  sequences along  the  northwes t Australian margin. Thus, the records from Sites U1482 and U148 3 have high potential to better constrain the Neogene tectonic an d paleoceanographic evolution of the northwest Australian margin, including the causes for the widespread demise of the reef system.  

# Middle Miocene to Holocene carbonate accumulation in the IPWP  

Carbonate records from the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocea n document substantial changes in the calcite compensation dept h (CCD) through the Neogene to the present, apparently suggestin g extensive changes in ocean carbonate chemistry (e.g., Pälike et al., 2012). The CCD behaved in a highly dynamic way in the eastern Pacific Ocean during the MMCO and was generally much shallowe r during the late Miocene “carbonate crash.” In contrast, $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ mas s accumulation rates (MAR) in the eastern and western equatoria l Pacific and southwest Pacific record very high $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ accumulatio n rates during the late Miocene (the so called Miocene “biogeni c bloom”) decreasing toward the present. We have generated $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ records at a resolution of 3 per core to document these changes a t the northwest Australian Sites U1482 and U1483 (late Miocene t o recent) and the Eauripik Rise Sites U1488 and U1489 (early Miocene to recent) in order to assess their regional extent and magnitude. These data will provide the framework for more detaile d shore-based analyses and regional comparisons. The new record s will help to evaluate changes in the oceanic carbonate budget in relation to ocean circulation and global climate trends through th e Neogene.  

# Late Pliocene Admiralty Islands volcanism  

The sediment succession at Sites U1486 and U1487 in the Manus Basin consists of clay-rich biogenic ooze overlying a thick succession of volcanogenic-rich sediment with multiple centimeter- t o decimeter-thick tephra layers and minor biogenic components (Figures F17, F19, F29). The age at the bottom of the holes, when AP C coring reached or came close to refusal, is ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figures F18, F20, F30), and the age of the underlying basement is estimated to b e $3.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Taylor, 1979). These sites offer the opportunity to examin e the repercussions of this prolonged and intense period of volcanis m for global climate cooling, both indirectly through the chemical alteration of the fresh basalt and their effect on seawater compositio n and more directly due to their impact on atmospheric opacity an d greenhouse gases.  

# Intercalibration of biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and isotope stratigraphy  

The calibration of nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer datums, which provide the main biostratigraphic framework over th e Neogene geological timescale, is primarily based on previous drilling in the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and eastern Pacifi c Ocean. However, these calibrations need to be further expanded t o other oceanic regions to test their global applicability. The mostl y excellent to good preservation of calcareous microfossils in continuous, extended Miocene to Pleistocene sediment successions fro m the northwest Australian Sites U1482 and U1483 and the WPW P Sites U1484–U1490 (Figure F35) will allow high-resolution taxonomic and biostratigraphic studies as well as detailed correlation o f bioevents to isotope stratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. Thes e sites offer the opportunity to improve the calibration of speciation/extinction events and to test the synchroneity/diachroneity o f bioevents in different ocean basins (Atlantic, Pacific, and India n Oceans). Furthermore, these sites are suitable to investigate gradual or abrupt morphological changes, including coiling changes i n planktonic foraminifers, that have potential for stratigraphy and t o explore relationships between evolutionary events and changin g ocean chemistry and circulation through most of the Neogene.

Figure F6. Climatic impact of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). The ITF flows from the WPWP through the Indonesian seaways and exits to the Indian Ocea n primarily through the Timor Sea. From there, part of the ITF flows southward joining the Leeuwin Current and bringing heat and moisture to Western Australia. However, most of the ITF enters the westward flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC) across the Indian Ocean, where it joins the southward-flowing Agulha s Current. With major contribution from ITF water, some of the Agulhas Current flows around the Cape of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean as part of the globa l thermohaline circulation. At present, the ITF receives water from the North Pacific Ocean and to a lesser extent from the South Pacific Ocean through the Ne w Guinea Coastal Current (NGCC), although the relative contributions of these end-members vary seasonally and interannually. On longer timescales, the contribution likely depends on changes in climate conditions and tectonic adjustments of the Indonesian Gateway (e.g., Cane and Molnar, 2001). NECC $=$ Nort h Equatorial Countercurrent, $\mathsf{E C=}$ Equatorial Current. Comparing records from Expedition 363 drill sites in the WPWP and northwest Australian margin (marke d by yellow circles) will allow us to assess changes in the ITF on different temporal scales.

Figure F32. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensity (Int.; blue) and azimuthally corrected declination (Dec.; red) after peak AF demagnetization for Expedition 363 sites. Higher intensity values at Sites U1484-U1487 are influenced by greater terrigenous flux (Sites U1484 and U1485) and volcaniclastic inputs (Sites U1486 and U1487). Downhole reductions in intensity, most evident at Sites U1488 and U1489 but also occurring in Sites U1482 and U1483, reflect the influence of sediment diagenesis and the dissolution of magnetite at depth.

Base map was generated with GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org) using the Global Multi-Resolution Topography synthesis database (Ryan et al., 2009). Drainage basins of the Fitzro y and Ord Rivers (Geoscience Australia, 1997) are marked with a black line. Approximate extensions of the Fitzroy and Ord Rivers on the northwest Australia n shelf during the LGM are indicated by blue dashed lines. Generalized wind patterns (white arrows) from Gentilli (1971).
