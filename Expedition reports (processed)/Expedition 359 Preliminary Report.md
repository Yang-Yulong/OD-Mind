# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 359 was designed to address changes in sea level and currents, along with monsoon evolution in the Indian Ocean. Eight drill sites are located i n the carbonate edifice of the Republic of Maldives, which bears  a unique and mostly unread Indian Ocean archive of the evolving Cenozoic icehouse world. This tropical marine record is key for bette r understanding the effects of this global evolution in the Indo-Pacifi c realm. The bank geometries of the growing carbonate archipelag o provide a physical record of changing sea level and ocean currents. The bank growth occurs in pulses of aggradation and progradatio n that are controlled by sea level fluctuations during the early an d middle Miocene, including the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum.  A dramatic shift in development of the carbonate edifice from a se a level–controlled to a predominantly current-controlled system appears to be directly linked to the evolving Indian monsoon. Thi s phase led to a twofold configuration of bank development: ban k growth continued in some parts of the edifice, whereas in othe r places, banks drowned. Drowning steps seem to coincide with onse t and intensification of the monsoon-related current system and deposition of contourite fans and giant sediment drifts. Expeditio n 359 cores are intended for reconstructing the changing current system through time that is directly related to the evolution of the Indian monsoon. As such, the drift deposits will provide a continuou s record of Indian monsoon development in the region of the Maldives.  

Expedition 359 had two main focus points. The first was to dat e precisely the onset of the current system that is potentially in concert with the onset or the intensification of the Indian monsoon an d coincides with the onset of the modern current system in th e world’s ocean. The second important outcome of Expedition 359 i s groundtruthing the hypothesis that the dramatic, pronounce d change in style of the sedimentary carbonate sequence stacking wa s caused by a combination of relative sea level fluctuations and ocea n current system changes. These questions were directly addressed b y the shipboard scientific data.  

In addition, Expedition 359 cores will provide a complete Neogene $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ record of the platform and platform margin sediment s and a comparison with pelagic records over the same time period. This comparison will allow assessment of the extent to which platform carbonates record changes in the global carbon cycle an d whether changes in the carbon isotopic composition of organic an d inorganic components covary and the implications this has on th e deep-time record. This determination is important, as such record s are the only type that exist in deep time.  

# Introduction  

Changes in oceanic circulation and sea level, along with onse t and fluctuations of the Indian monsoon characterize the Neogene. Located in the Indian Ocean, the Maldives carbonate edifice bear s the tropical marine record of these changes. The archipelago i s characterized by a double row of atolls encompassing a basin, th e Maldives Inner Sea, connected to the open ocean through passages. The Maldives Inner Sea has served as a depositional center of current-controlled deposits (i.e., drifts) since the partial drowning o f parts of the carbonate edifice during the middle Miocene. This sedimentary system of drowned platform parts and drifts was the target of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditio n 359, which aimed to reconstruct its paleoceanographic evolutio n over the past 23 My. The approach of Expedition 359 was to reconstruct this evolution from the combined physical record provide d by the seismic data, the lithologic record in the neritic and hemipelagic deposits, and the chemical proxies within the sedimentary column. This reconstruction was achieved by drilling eight site s aligned into two transects covering shallow to deepwater deposits. Sites U1465, U1466, U1468, U1469, and U1470 were drilled to recover a sedimentary sequence encompassing a carbonate platfor m to drift succession (Oligocene to Pleistocene). Sites U1467, U1471, and U1472 recovered a Miocene to Pleistocene carbonate drift succession. The expedition built on a series of seismic data sets that image the different steps of carbonate platform evolution (R/V Meteor Cruise  M74/4  NEOMA  and  R/V  Sonne  Cruise  SO23 6 MALSTROM) and previously drilled Ocean Drilling Progra m (ODP) Site 716 (Leg 115) (Backman, Duncan, et al., 1988).  

# Background Geological setting of the Maldives  

The Maldives archipelago in the central equatorial India n Ocean is an isolated tropical carbonate platform edifice constitutin g the central and largest part of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, which i s located southwest of India (Figure F1). A north-south–oriente d double row of atolls encloses the Inner Sea of the Maldives (Figur e F2). The atolls are separated from each other by interatoll channel s that deepen toward the Indian Ocean (Purdy and Bertram, 1993). The Inner Sea is a basin with water as deep as $550\;\mathrm{m}$ . The Maldive s carbonate succession accumulated since the Eocene, away from an y terrigenous input (Aubert and Droxler, 1992; Purdy and Bertram, 1993).  

The modern archipelago comprises about 1200 smaller atoll s that lie near or slightly above the sea surface. Discontinuous marginal rims formed by such small atolls surround lagoons with wate r depths up to $50{-}60\;\mathrm{m}$ . These rims are interrupted by deep passages, allowing strong currents within the atoll lagoons to rework and redeposit sediment and influence the growth of patch reefs (Ciarapic a and Passeri, 1993; Betzler et al., 2015). Modern marginal reefs ar e composed of robust-branching corals and coralline algae, wherea s the lagoonal reefs show domal corals and detrital sand and rubbl e facies (Gischler et al., 2008). Muddy sediments are present only i n atoll areas that are protected by large marginal reefs (Ciarapica an d Passeri, 1993; Gischler, 2006; Betzler et al., 2015).  

The oceanward margins of the Maldives archipelago are generally steeply inclined, with dips of $20^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}$ to $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth. O n the Inner Sea side, terraced atoll slopes have the same dip angles bu t reach to water depths of only $150\;\mathrm{m},$ where the gradient rapidly declines (Fürstenau et al., 2010). The Inner Sea is characterized b y periplatform ooze deposition that locally accumulates into sediment drift bodies (Droxler et al., 1990; Malone et al., 1990; Betzler e t al., 2009, Lüdmann et al., 2013).  

The climate and oceanographic setting of the Maldives are dictated by the seasonally reversing Indian monsoon system (Tomcza k and Godfrey, 2003). Southwestern winds prevail during Norther n Hemisphere summer (April–November), and northeastern wind s prevail during winter (December–March). Winds generate ocea n currents that are directed westward in the winter and eastward i n the summer. Interseasonally, a band of Indian Ocean equatorial westerlies are established, enforcing strong eastward-flowing surface currents with velocities up to $1.3~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Currents reach wate r depths of $200\,\textrm{m}$ and more with only slightly reduced velocitie s (Tomczak and Godfrey, 2003). Within the modern atolls’ passages, currents can exhibit velocities up to $2\;\mathrm{m}/\mathbf{s}$ at the surface (Preu an d Engelbrecht, 1991), accounting for winnowing in the passages an d lagoons, where hard bottoms form (Ciarapica and Passeri, 1993; Gischler, 2006; Betzler et al., 2015).  

The Maldives formed on a lower Paleogene $(60{-}50\,\mathrm{Ma})$ volcani c basement (Duncan and Hargraves, 1990) (Figure F3). The longterm subsidence rate of the Maldives is roughly $0.03{-}0.04\ \mathrm{mm/y}$ based on deep core data from Well ARI-1 (Aubert and Droxler, 1996; Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004a). In contrast, sedimentologica l data from the Rasdhoo atoll indicate a much faster subsidence rat e since the last interglacial, with a maximum subsidence rate of 0.1 5 $\mathrm{mm/y}$ during the past 135,000 y (Gischler et al., 2008).  

# Lower to middle Miocene  

The Maldives comprise an approximately $3~\mathrm{km}$ thick shallowwater carbonate succession (Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004a) (Figur e F3). Carbonate production was established during the early Eocen e when flat-topped carbonate banks began to form on topographi c highs created by the volcanic basement during the Eocene to earl y Oligocene. During the late Oligocene, bank margins typically ha d elevated rims that separated bank-interior areas from the ope n ocean. During the early Miocene, these banks partially drowned an d carbonate production became restricted to narrow bands at the respective most oceanward areas. During the Miocene, bank margin s prograded toward the Inner Sea, as recognized in different version s of seismic reflection data, irrespective of seismic resolution (Purd y and Bertram, 1993; Aubert and Droxler, 1996; Belopolsky and Droxler, $2004{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Betzler et al., 2009, 2013a).  

Ten seismic sequences are recognized in the lower and middl e Miocene platform strata of the Maldives (Betzler et al., 2013a) (Figures F4, F5). These sequences are interpreted to have formed in response  to  sea  level–driven  accommodation  space  variation s (Betzler et al., 2013a). Platform Sequences (PS) 1–6 show development from a shallow ramp to a steep-flanked, reef-rimmed carbonate platform. Bank-edge reefs protect the lagoon where backree f aprons occur. At the PS6–PS7 transition, a switch from dominantl y aggrading to dominantly prograding bank margins occurs. PS7– PS10 are composed of deposits formed in response to forced regression and are overlain by deposits formed during reflooding of th e bank margins.  

# Middle Miocene to Pleistocene  

The upper middle Miocene is characterized by the appearanc e of large-scale lobate clinoform bodies, attesting to the onset of current amplification in the Inner Sea (Figures F4, F5) (Betzler et al., 2013a; Lüdmann et al., 2013). These bodies are attached to passage s where parts of barrier reefs drowned while remaining banks an d atolls grew elsewhere (Betzler et al., 2009, 2013a). Lobes are interpreted as “mega spillovers” fed by easterly currents and reworked b y a current system flowing obliquely or normally to this main stream. This current pattern filled the Inner Sea from west to east (Lüdmann et al., 2013). Starting with Drift Sequence (DS) 6, the openin g of a southern gateway introduced northward flow of bottom wate r into the Inner Sea, leading to deposition of giant elongated drifts a t the eastern flank of the basin, filling it from east to west. Becaus e the current swept away most of the material around the atolls, th e system was not able to prograde and the steady subsidence wa s compensated by aggradation (Betzler et al., 2013a; Lüdmann et al., 2013).  

DS1–DS9 are mostly conformable in the central part of the Inner Sea, but they display downlaps and onlaps at the basin margins.  

Two main types of bottom current–controlled deposits occur: (1)  a prograding wedge to clinoform type near the passages between th e atolls and (2) a mounded shape type located along the atoll flank s with a broad moat of $2.2{-}2.5~\mathrm{km}$ in the updip direction (Lüdman n et al., 2013). The mounded shape type is interpreted as a plastere d drift body of a giant elongated drift migrating along the basin flan k under a weak current regime (Faugères et al., 1999). Narrowe r moats $\left(500{-}800\ \mathrm{m}\right)$ at the western flank of the Inner Sea are interpreted as reflecting a high-velocity current focused in the west an d a wider, slower current in the east. This partitioning is in line wit h monsoonal-triggered current reversals.  

Two additional drowning steps affected the Maldives (Betzler e t al., 2009, 2013a). Flat-topped and atoll-shaped banks are interprete d to have drowned quickly, whereas mound-shaped banks are interpreted to have undergone sequential drowning under elevated nutrient fluxes (Betzler et al., 2009), similar to banks described b y Zampetti et al. (2004) offshore Malaysia. The drowned banks ar e elongated parallel to the extension of the Kardiva Channel, which i s characterized by throughflow of monsoon-driven surface current s (Betzler et al., 2009). This shape is interpreted as reflecting curren t control, similar to the recent atolls that are elongated because of th e action of waves and currents (Purdy and Bertram, 1993).  

# Partial drowning steps triggered by currents  

The precise timing of current evolution in the Maldives is no t well established, but some turning points are known. Marine records suggest onset of monsoonal-triggered marine upwelling a t ${\sim}8.5$ Ma (Kroon et al., 1991). An increase in sediment flux into th e Indian Ocean occurred around 11 Ma (Rea, 1992; Zheng et al., 2004), and a peak in the sedimentation rates of the Indus Fan occurred between 16 and $10\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Clift et al., 2008). Onset and monsoon-intensification  steps  correlate  with  the  Maldives  partial drowning steps (Betzler et al., 2013a). It is therefore proposed tha t currents and upwelling from monsoonal currents shaped the atoll s in the past, controlling sediment production and reef growth. Thus, the timing of partial platform drowning and monsoon evolution i s linked. Under monsoon conditions, upwelling injected nutrient s into surface waters, affecting the carbonate banks (Betzler et al., 2009). This process caused the demise of the barrier reef system, which was replaced by a string of current-shaped relict reefs separated by passages accommodating the throughflow of currents (Betzler et al., 2009, Lüdmann et al., 2013).  

# Site summaries Site U1465  

# Background and objectives  

One goal of Expedition 359, in addition to retrieving the recor d of the Neogene sea level changes in the prograding Kardiva platform and the onset of the monsoon-related currents in drift deposits, was to establish the time and cause of the drowning of th e Kardiva platform during the middle Miocene. Platform drowning– related questions were the focus of Site U1465, which is situate d above the margin of the drowned Kardiva platform that is overlai n by $70\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. It is the westernmost site of a four-site transec t that runs from west to east in the Kardiva Channel. Site U1465 (proposed Site MAL-01A) is located at $4^{\circ}55.9873^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $73^{\circ}0.6786^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in  a water depth of $512.64\mathrm{~m~}$ between the Goidhoo and South Maalhosmadulu atolls (Figure F2).  

Carbonate platforms are the only depositional system that ca n cease to exist. The mechanism of the platform demise is usuall y drowning,  but  the reason(s)  for  drowning  is  still  unresolve d (Schlager, 1981). Many processes have been proposed, such a s global anoxic events, tectonic breakup, and excess nutrients (Arthu r and  Schlanger,  1979;  Hallock  and  Schlager,  1986;  Philip  an d Schlager, 1990; Eberli, 1991). The close relationship between platform drowning and intensification of ocean currents has been proposed for the demise of the Miocene platforms on the Mario n Plateau (Isern et al., 2004; John and Mutti, 2005; Eberli et al., 2010). Betzler et al. (2009, 2013a) and Lüdmann et al. (2013) documen t partial platform drowning in the Maldives and propose that, in th e Maldives, the drowning of the platforms is the combined product o f current activity and nutrient supply. Examining the drowning unconformity and the pre- and postdrowning succession in regard t o age, composition, and diagenetic overprint was intended to provid e evidence to link drowning directly to the onset of the monsoon-related current system and the concomitant excess nutrient suppl y from upwelling.  

# Principal results  

The advanced piston corer (APC) deployed in Hole U1465 A cored $76.6~\mathrm{m}$ mainly in the drift sequence overlying the drowne d platform, recovering $53.24\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $70\%$ recovery). Hole U1465B wa s washed down to 65.9 meters below seafloor (mbsf), and 23 rotar y core barrel (RCB) cores were recovered between 65.9 and 213 mbs f with a recovered length of $9.41\;\mathrm{m}$ $6\%$ recovery) in the platform succession. Hole U1465C was washed down to 55 mbsf, and 26 halflength APC (HLAPC) and extended core barrel (XCB) cores wer e recovered from the drift and the platform succession, with a recovery of $24.6~\mathrm{m}$ ( $14\%$ recovery).  

Three lithostratigraphic units were identified in the mostly unlithified drift deposits and the underlying lithified platform an d slope-sediments of the Kardiva platform. Lithostratigraphic Unit  I contains unlithified white/light gray to gray-brown and pale yello w packstone to grainstone and, locally, rudstone. The components ar e planktonic and benthic foraminifers, pteropods, red algae, Halimeda plates, bivalves, echinoid fragments and spines, otoliths, an d rare solitary corals. Aggregate grains, yellow to brown grains, an d black grains occur throughout the entire unit. All lithoclasts an d some bioclasts are abraded, which is expected in this drift deposit. The underlying lithostratigraphic Unit II comprises a shallow-wate r platform margin facies with diverse coral fauna. The top of Unit II i s well-lithified floatstone with corals, red algae, large benthic foraminifers, bivalves, and serpulid fragments that show evidence of exposure and subsequent submarine hardground formation. This thi n drowning layer is partly dolomitized and silicified and contain s large molds with two generations of dark-colored geopetal infilling s that are likely phosphatic (Figure F6). Below this top layer cora l boundstone and floatstone that can be rich in algal nodules alternate. The matrix of the floatstone is generally bioclastic grainston e with abundant benthic foraminifers. Pervasive meteoric diagenesi s is indicated by moldic porosity, and marine diagenesis is seen i n multiple stages of cements and partial dolomitization. Lithostratigraphic Unit III consists of an alternating lithified, very pale brown , coarse-grained dolomitic grainstone to packstone with varying degrees of cementation. The composition is similar to the matrix o f the overlying floatstone, but coral fragments decrease and red alga e and large benthic foraminifers increase. The main components ar e large benthic foraminifers (Heterostegina sp., Lepidocyclina sp. [Nephrolepidina], Operculina sp., Amphistegina sp., Miogypsina sp., and Nummulites sp.), bivalves, Halimeda plates, red algae, mino r coral fragments (massive and branching), bryozoa, echinoid spines, gastropods, and abundant bioclasts (Figure F7). One characteristi c of Unit III is the repetitive alternation of hard cemented layers wit h abundant moldic porosity and layers of loosely cemented grainston e to packstone with interparticle porosity. Unit III displays all th e characteristics of a proximal slope facies, which fits the seismic facies that consists of steeply inclined reflections.  

A robust age model was produced by combining the biostratigraphic data of the planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils in the ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick drift sediment succession recovered i n Hole U1465A above the drowned platform. In the platform and th e underlying slope section, the occurrence of planktonic foraminifer s and nannofossils was not sufficient for biostratigraphic purposes. The $70\textrm{m}$ thick drift sediments range in age from Late Pleistocen e to early Pliocene. The large benthic foraminifer assemblage withi n the platform points to a middle Miocene age, indicating a long hiatus of ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{My}$ on the platform top.  

Benthic foraminifers and ostracods were studied in selecte d samples above and within the platform to evaluate the paleoenvironmental conditions. Pliocene–Pleistocene benthic fauna in th e drift samples generally indicate middle neritic to upper bathyal water depths (most likely ${<}500\ \mathrm{m}\mathrm{)}$ ) based on the presence of specie s such as Borealis melo, Cycloclypeus mediterraneus, Planulina ariminensis, Planulina subtenuissima, Cibicidoides dutemplei, Sphaeroidina bulloides, Cibicidoides bradyi, and small miliolids. Below 35.8 1 mbsf, there is a sand layer mainly composed of reworked reefal material (large benthic foraminifers, fragments of corals, and Halimeda). The upper Pliocene portion of the drift section also ha s abundant fragments of coral, well-preserved echinoderm spin e fragments, fish teeth, and planktonic foraminifers, but no ostracod s were observed. All samples contain reworked shallow-water taxa, indicating a range from reefal to middle neritic environments.  

Interstitial water (IW) sampling was limited to the uppermos t $70\;\mathrm{m}$ (i.e., the drift sediments overlying the platform) at Site U146 5 by lithification and poor recovery. The concentrations of major anions and cations generally remain constant and close to the mea n seawater values throughout the sampled interval. For example, $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ concentrations range between 422–433 and $10.9{-}11.2\;\mathrm{mM}$ with no trends visible with increasing depth. Similarly stable value s are reflected in $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ and ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ concentrations, and salinity also remains relatively constant at 34.5–35 throughout the measured interval. This general lack of variation could result from three possibl e situations: no significant diagenesis, high rates of advection, or contamination by seawater.  

The lack of geochemical variation contrasts with the mineralogical changes shown by the $\mathrm{X}$ -ray diffraction (XRD) data, which reflect carbonate diagenesis during the burial of sediment at Sit e U1465. Above $45~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , the sediment consists of $30\%{-}80\%$ aragonite, $6\%{-18\%}$ high-Mg calcite (HMC), and the remainder low-M g calcite (LMC). From 45 to $85~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , dolomite is present up to $7\%$ , and aragonite and HMC continue to make up $30\%{-}60\%$ of the sediment (Figure F8). Thus, it is possible that the rate of advection dilutes the geochemical signal of diagenesis in the IW. In th e carbonate platform portion, carbonate mineralogy is variable. Below 90 mbsf, the rocks are essentially composed of LMC and dolomite. Dolomite peaks at $57\%$ at 143.50 mbsf and is otherwis e present mostly ${<}20\%$ . Below 160 mbsf, aragonite is again present a t abundances of ${<}10\%$ , with dolomite constituting ${<}1\%$ and the remainder $(>\!90\%)$ consisting of LMC. Quartz is often present in th e XRD spectra but is never a significant component of the sedimen t $(<\!1\%)$ .  

Petrophysical analyses differentiate two physical propertie s units. The first unit encompasses the loose Pliocene–Pleistocen e drift sediments and has high porosities. The lower unit correspond s to the platform carbonates, characterized by higher $P$ -wave velocities and higher densities. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities reflect a variety of por e types that possibly result from complex diagenetic processes in response to the diagenetic processes linked to platform drowning.  

Seismic stratigraphy at Site U1465 shows excellent correlatio n with lithostratigraphic units. APC coring in Hole U1465A recovered DS7–DS9 and the platform top, and Hole U1465B and U1465 C coring retrieved PS11 and parts of PS10 (Figure F9). The hiatus separating the platform top from the drifts encompasses DS1–DS6, i s biostratigraphically dated at Site U1466 as middle Miocene to middle Pliocene (i.e., ${\sim}12{-}3.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), and corresponds to the boundar y between lithostratigraphic Units I and II. The upper part of PS11 a t Site U1465 consists of a package of gently basinward-dipping reflections that can be laterally traced over a distance of around $600~\mathrm{m}$ . The lower boundary of the package coincides with sequence boundary PS11, which corresponds to the base of lithostratigraphic Uni t II. The deepest hole at Site U1465 (Hole U1465C) was abandone d approximately $9\,\mathrm{m}$ above the basal boundary of PS10.  

# Site U1466  

# Background and objectives  

Site  U1466  (proposed  Site  MAL-02A)  is  positioned  a t $4^{\circ}55.9880^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $73^{\circ}1.6894^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , in a water depth of $518\mathrm{~m~}1880\mathrm{~m~}$ east o f Site U1465 (Figure F2). The site is in front of the last progradin g clinoform of the drowned carbonate platform that was the target o f Site U1465. In this basinal position, a thick drift succession overlay s the bottom- and foresets of the drowned Kardiva platform. Th e pulses of progradation are related to sea level changes, and the overlying drift succession is a current-controlled system that is likely related to the Indian monsoon (Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004a, 2004b; Betzler et al., 2013a, 2013b). The main goals of this site were (1) t o date the transition from the sea level–controlled platform system t o the current-controlled drift deposition and (2) to establish an ag e model for the early and middle Miocene sea level changes in the Indian Ocean and the changes in current evolution since the middl e Miocene. The mid-Miocene to recent drift succession contains several sequences caused by fluctuations in the current system (Lüdmann et al., 2013). Dating these sequence boundaries will provid e ages of changes in strength and direction of the currents and potentially serve as a proxy for changes in monsoon intensity. Dating o f the platform sequence boundaries will provide ages of the sea leve l lowstands in the Indian Ocean that together with data sets from th e Bahamas (ODP Leg 166) and offshore eastern Australia (ODP Leg s 133 and 194) will allow testing of the global synchroneity of Neogene sea level changes (Betzler et al., 2000; Eberli et al., 2002, 2010). In addition, the age of the last platform sequence will provide th e age of the platform drowning that potentially is linked to the onse t of the current system. Site U1466 cores will also address another objective of Expedition 359: the periplatform sediments deposited a t this site offer the opportunity to retrieve a complete record of $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ though the lower and middle Miocene that, together with other Expedition 359 sites, will provide another data set of the carbon isotopic record that is needed to calibrate the periplatform platfor m margin record against the pelagic record (Swart, 2008).  

# Principal results  

Site U1466 is located in the Kardiva Channel, which connect s the Inner Sea of the Maldives with the open Indian Ocean. Tw o holes were cored at Site U1466 using the APC, HLAPC, XCB, an d RCB systems. Hole U1466A was cored to 317.9 mbsf (50 cores) an d recovered $243.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment $74\%$ recovery). Hole U1466B wa s cored to 803.1 mbsf (50 cores) and recovered $88.5\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t $17\%$ recovery).  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1466 penetrated $803.6~\mathrm{m}$ of lower Miocene to Pleistocene carbonates. Seismic stratigraph y shows that this succession consists of a $254\;\mathrm{m}$ thick package of drif t deposits overlying a $549\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession consisting of the bottomsets and foresets of the middle Miocene prograding platform.  

Seven lithostratigraphic units were identified in the drift an d slope/basin deposits. Lithostratigraphic Unit I through Subunit IV C $(0{-}248.3\mathrm{~mbsf})$ is from the sediment drift succession, Subunit IV D through Unit VI (248.3–715.34 mbsf) contains the lithologic recor d of the prograding tongues of the Kardiva platform, and Unit VI I (715.34–803.61 mbsf) is composed of lower Miocene basinal carbonates from the Inner Sea.  

Unit I is Pleistocene to recent in age and consists of an unlithified coarse-grained grainstone succession. The gray-brown to pal e yellow carbonate sands consist almost exclusively of bioclasts, wit h planktonic foraminifers being the most abundant component wit h admixtures of benthic foraminifers, pteropods, otoliths, Halimeda plates, echinoid spines, bryozoa, and bivalves. The bioclasts ar e generally broken and show signs of abrasion indicative of curren t transport.  

Unit II is an alternation of unlithified packstone and grainstone . The sediment ranges in grain size from very fine in the grainston e intervals to coarse grained in the packstone. The main component s are planktonic foraminifers and minor benthic foraminifers, pteropods, red algae, Halimeda plates, bivalves, echinoid fragments an d spines, and otoliths. Aggregate grains, yellow to brown staine d grains, and black grains occur throughout the entire unit.  

Unit III consists of very pale brown medium- to coarse-graine d grainstone to packstone that is variably lithified. The main components are planktonic foraminifers, with common to present benthi c foraminifers (e.g., Lepidocyclina), encrusting red algae, Halimeda plates, and bryozoan fragments. Lithification increases downhole t o lithified rocks at 99.53 mbsf; below this depth, unlithified and lithified intervals alternate again.  

Unit IV consists of four subunits based on the occurrence of textural changes from wackestones to packstones and/or grainstones. The overall lithology is similar throughout the entire unit and consists of skeletal and foraminiferal wackestone to packstone (Figur e F10).  

Unit V is marked by the occurrence of large benthic foraminifer s in light gray to light brownish gray, lithified, medium- to coarsegrained, dolomitic grainstone and packstone.  

Unit VI is characterized by a significant increase in the degree o f bioturbation. It consists of an alternation of decametric intervals o f lithified fine- to medium-grained packstones and wackestones wit h common planktonic and benthic foraminifers, echinoid fragments, and bioclasts.  

Unit VII consists of a recurrent alternation of well-laminate d black intervals with massive white chalk and gray-green interval s with moderate to abundant bioturbation (Figure F11). The top o f the unit contains intervals with gravity-induced deposits (e.g., slump sediments, soft sediment deformation features, and turbidites).  

The age model for Site U1466 (Figure F12) relies on the combination of planktonic foraminifer (Figure F13) and calcareous nannoplankton datums. The estimated sedimentation rate for th e  

Pliocene–Pleistocene sequence is ${\sim}1.41\ \mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . Most of the uppe r Miocene is absent from the sedimentary record at this site. The hiatus occurs between the last occurrence (LO) of Coronocyclus nitescens $(11.9\;\mathrm{Ma})$ and the LO of Globoquadrina dehiscens $(5.92\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . The middle Miocene is divided into two intervals; the basal on e presents a moderately high sedimentation rate $({\sim}4.4~\mathrm{\cm/ky})$ , whereas the upper interval presents a very high sedimentation rat e $({\sim}17.1~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ . The early Miocene is divided into two intervals according to the preservation of microfossils, although the sedimentation rate does not change through those intervals and remains th e same as values in the basal middle Miocene $({\sim}4.4\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .  

Pore water studies at Site U1466 in the upper 85 mbsf indicat e either relatively low rates of organic matter remineralization o r rates of advection by bottom seawater that are faster than the rate s of decomposition of organic matter. XRD analysis shows that th e concentration of aragonite in the sediments remains relatively hig h throughout the Pleistocene and Pliocene $(0{-}85\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ , reflecting either variations in the input from adjacent platforms during change s in sea level or diagenetic change to LMC. Although the hypothesi s that aragonite is not being neomorphosed in the upper 85 mbsf i s supported by the absence of large increases in the concentration o f $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ in the pore fluids, the possibility also exists that relative hig h rates of fluid advection remove evidence of dissolution and precipitation reactions. Below 85 mbsf, aragonite disappears, and at 97.  7 mbsf, the sediment contains up to $70\%$ dolomite. Below $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , dolomite decreases again and up to $20\%$ aragonite is present, an d below 320 mbsf, dolomite disappears and is only barely detectabl e in trace concentrations through the remainder of the core (Figur e F14).  

The determination of paleomagnetic polarity based only on inclination data for Site U1466 is extremely weak because of the ver y low paleolatitude, possible inclination anomalies due to a nondipol e field, and poor data quality. Nevertheless, paleomagnetic studie s identify 21 magnetozones using the inclination data. These magnetozones are tentatively attributed to the lower and middle Miocene (C5A–C5E series and C6).  

The variability of values in the downhole logs and the measure d petrophysical properties in the pure carbonate strata of Site U146 6 reflects changes in diagenesis/lithification and the amount of organic carbon rather than mineral composition. Downhole loggin g was limited to one run with the modified triple combo tool string t o $345\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF) because the hol e collapsed. In the pure carbonate succession, the natural gamma radiation (NGR) is low with two higher peaks related to increased organic carbon content. The resistivity most likely records the degre e of cementation, with better-cemented intervals having higher resistivity.  

Physical properties also reflect the pure carbonate compositio n (Figure F15). Magnetic susceptibility is very low throughout th e section. Grain density is similar throughout the entire section. Velocity does not correlate well to porosity and displays abrupt increases and decreases downcore, as is typical in pure carbonates. Gamma ray peaks relate to increases in organic matter.  

The correlation of the lithostratigraphy and age model from biostratigraphy to the seismic stratigraphy confirms and refines th e predrilling interpretation (Figure F16). The continuous seismic reflections of the distal clinoforms of the sea level–controlled Kardiv a platform are lithologically a regular alternation of intervals of lithified fine- to medium-grained packstones and wackestones. Thes e alternations most likely are the result of high-frequency sea leve l changes. Turnover in the drift succession is recorded by a change i n seismic and lithologic facies. The seismic reflection amplitudes decrease, and the lithology dominated by coarse-grained packston e and grainstone reflects a current-dominated sedimentation pattern.  

# Site U1467  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1467 (proposed Site MAL-09A) is the easternmost sit e drilled in the Inner Sea of the Maldives during Expedition 359. It i s located at $4^{\circ}51.0274^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $73^{\circ}17.0223^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , at a water depth of $487.4\mathrm{~m~}$ $24.8\,\mathrm{km}$ east of the eastern end of the northern transect and $29.4\,\mathrm{km}$ east of the eastern end of the southern transect (Figure F2). Core s from this site record a $630\,\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of drift deposits linin g the southern flank of the Kardiva Channel. The main objectives a t this site were to constrain the timing of sequence boundaries in th e drift succession and to precisely date the onset of the drift deposition; to analyze the cyclostratigraphy of carbonate drift deposits, providing reconstructions of changes in the current regime an d monsoon cyclicity; and to recover an undisturbed sedimentary sequence for further paleoceanographic studies.  

The mid-Miocene to recent drift succession contains several sequences that are likely caused by fluctuations in the current syste m flowing through the Kardiva Channel. Dating these sequenc e boundaries will provide the ages of changes in strength and direction of the currents. Further linking of these physical stratigraphi c data with postcruise sedimentological and geochemical data will address the question of changes in the monsoon intensity (Kroon e t al., 1991; Prell et al., 1992; Clift et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2015). Moreover, the periplatform sediments deposited at this site offe r the opportunity to retrieve a complete record of $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ through th e middle Miocene that, together with the other Expedition 359 sites, will provide another data set of the carbon isotopic record that i s needed to calibrate the periplatform record against the pelagic record.  

# Principal results  

Five holes were drilled at Site U1467, one of them (Hol e U1467E) as a dedicated logging hole. The sediment recovered a t Site U1467 is a fine-grained succession of wackestone to packstone. Compositional changes are minor, but alternation of lighter an d darker intervals of variable thickness persists downhole, eve n through the increasing degree of lithification to approximately 64 0 mbsf. Six lithostratigraphic units were differentiated.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0{-}110.0\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ consists of unlithified , foraminifer-rich wackestone to packstone with a predominance o f very fine- to fine-grained wackestone. The unit is characterized b y thick $(30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm})$ to very thick $(>\!100\,\mathsf{c m})$ intervals defined by colo r changes ranging from light gray to grayish brown. The dark colore d intervals correlate with low lightness $L^{\ast}$ reflectance values and display an inverse relationship with NGR trends, with higher NG R (counts/s) observed in the darker intervals.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II (110–215 mbsf) is defined by interlayered unlithified and partially lithified planktonic foraminifer–ric h wackestone and mudstone with pteropods and particulate organi c matter. The matrix of the sediment contains calcareous nannofossils and sponge spicules. Celestine is common as nodules and layer s up to $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick and as disseminated crystals in the fine fraction.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit III (215–303 mbsf) consists of partiall y lithified very fine–grained mudstone to wackestone with a dominance of wackestone. The unit also has thick to very thick package s with color changes, from light gray to light olive gray and ligh t brownish gray. The sediment contains abundant planktonic foraminifers; echinoid spines and sponge spicules are common, bu t benthic foraminifers are rare. Celestine nodules and fragments, bioclasts, and particulate organic matter are common, especially in th e darker intervals. Bioturbation is common with Thalassinoides, Planolites, Palaeophycus, and possibly Zoophycos. Traces appea r better developed in the darker colored intervals.  

The deposits of lithostratigraphic Unit IV (303–498.5 mbsf) ar e lithified, very fine– to medium-grained, planktonic foraminifer– rich wackestone to packstone. As with previous units, particulat e organic matter is present and changes in abundance, which is linke d to color variations from light gray to light brownish gray and pal e yellow with gradational and commonly bioturbated contacts. Ichnofauna consist of Thalassinoides, Planolites, Zoophycos, Chondrites, and Palaeophycus.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit V (498.5–607 mbsf) still consists o f planktonic foraminifer–rich wackestone to packstone with alternating light and dark intervals, but lithostratigraphic Unit VI below 60 7 mbsf lacks dark layers within the fine-grained wackestone.  

Biostratigraphic analyses show an apparently continuous succession of Holocene to middle Miocene age recovered at Site U146 7 (Figure F17) that is divided into three intervals. The Pleistocene an d upper Pliocene extends from the seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf. Throughout  this  interval,  planktonic  foraminifers  are  well  preserved, whereas benthic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils are wel l preserved at the top but are moderately well preserved below 4 0 mbsf. The lower Pliocene and much of the upper Miocene extend s from $\mathord{\sim}130$ to 540 mbsf. Preservation throughout this thick interva l is poor to moderate for all microfossils, except in the deepest core i n this interval (Core 359-U1467B-69X), from which very well preserved nannofossils were recovered from a few darker, probabl y clay-rich levels. The late Miocene and later part of the middle Miocene extends from 540 to 714 mbsf. In the upper part of this interval, all groups of calcareous microfossils are rare and poorl y preserved; preservation improves downcore and in the lower part o f the interval is moderate to good.  

Decreases in $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ concentrations and alkalinity in the interstitial fluid geochemistry from Site U1467 indicate that significant remineralization of organic material occurred below 50 mbsf. A n odor of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ was also noted upon core recovery and squeezing of th e whole-round samples, suggesting that bacterial sulfate reductio n probably accounts for the observed trend. As large amounts of $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ are released during decomposition of sedimentary organic matter,  a negative correlation between $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ and $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ is also related to th e oxidation of organic matter. $C1^{-}$ increases from the sediment surfac e to around 100 mbsf (Figure F18) are believed to be related to th e last glacial period, when salinity was altered as a result of Norther n Hemisphere glaciation.  

Site U1467 sediments contain up to $60\%$ aragonite in the uppe r $50~\mathrm{m}$ of the core, as revealed by XRD analysis. Below 50 mbsf, aragonite content decreases to less than $10\%{-}15\%$ and drops to les s than $10\%$ by 500 mbsf. This decrease is interpreted to reflect aragonite dissolution, based on increases of $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ concentrations in th e pore fluids. Deposits are again richer in aragonite between 500 mbs f and the bottom of the hole; $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ concentrations of the pore fluid s decrease slightly in this interval, whereas $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ concentrations increase. The decrease in $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ probably is controlled by a sink of $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ located at a deeper interval that was not cored. XRD analyses als o show several occurrences of celestine $\left(\mathrm{SrSO_{4}}\right)$ between 163 and 39 3 mbsf, indicating that the pore water concentrations of $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ an d $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ attain supersaturation with respect to this mineral. At Sit e U1467, celestine occurs in an interval of unusually high sedimentation. Hence, in spite of the reduction of $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ in this interval, ther e was sufficient $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ to produce supersaturation in the pore water s with respect to celestine.  

Organic carbon content in Site U1467 sediments fluctuates between 0 and $12\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , with the samples richest in organic carbon a t 89, 112, and 168 mbsf. Methane remains at concentrations betwee n 1.6 and $12.0\;\mathrm{ppmv},$ increasing slightly from the surface to 300 mbs f and then remaining mostly stable around 5 ppmv with some scattering of values. Ethane is only present in measurable quantities $_{\sim1}$ ppmv) between 249 and 277 mbsf and at 324, 580, and 706 mbsf.  

Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) analysis at Site U146 7 was only possible on limited core sections because of pervasive contamination, presumably from rust in the drill pipe, that affected th e first two to three sections of every core, despite cleaning the drill pipe interior while in Hole U1467C. Discrete samples showed les s overprint than the archive section halves, and shore-based analyse s should yield better quality results. Nevertheless, a series of magnetozones in the intervals between ${\sim}100$ and 200 mbsf in Hol e U1467C and between 195 and 255 mbsf in Hole U1467B were identified and interpreted as Chrons C2Ar to $C3\mathrm{n}.3\mathrm{n}$ (Figure F17). Another series of possible normal and reverse polarity intervals base d only on the analysis of inclinations, which are less than $20^{\circ}$ and consistent with the paleolatitude for this site, was recognized betwee n 580 and 714 mbsf in Hole U1467C (Cores 24X–37X) and interpreted to be Chrons C5n.2n to C5An.2n.  

The physical properties of the sediment reflect the rather monotonous nature of the lithologic succession at Site U1467, whos e main characteristic is the changes of color from darker to lighter intervals in generally fine grained, bioturbated wackestone. Four distinct physical properties units are identified. The first three unit s $(0{-}465\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ are divided mainly based on slightly higher variabilit y of velocity in the second unit and a concomitant small step in th e downhole increase in the density and a coeval decrease of porosit y at 105 mbsf, as well as increased variability of density and porosity. Below 465 mbsf, where the formation is more lithified, density an d velocity increase significantly and show large variations. High-frequency fluctuations in NGR also follow these color variations, which are likely produced by small admixtures of organic material (dark color) and more early marine cements (light color). In addition, NGR data display five longer term variations that loosely follow the lithostratigraphic units. Magnetic susceptibility is lo w throughout the entire core. Thermal conductivity, on the othe r hand, increases downhole. The rate of this increase is reduced i n physical properties Unit 2.  

In the dedicated logging Hole U1467E, three tool strings wer e deployed: the triple combo, Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI), and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool strings. The caliper lo g from the first logging run indicated that much of the borehole wa s ${\sim}14$ inches in diameter and thus suitable for a vertical seismic profile (VSP) experiment. The VSI tool string recorded good soni c waveforms at 13 stations at a $50\;\mathrm{m}$ interval. After shore-based processing, logging data were analyzed and divided into four loggin g units. Logging unit boundaries correlate with some of the lithostratigraphic units (Figure F19). Most variations in the downhol e logs are seen in the gamma ray values, triggered by differences i n the uranium content, which correlate to variations in the amount o f organic matter as revealed by smear slide analysis. The VSP experiment produced good stacks of sonic waveforms. VSP data and soni c velocity logs therefore helped to establish the conversion betwee n depth and two-way traveltime (TWT) and thus allowed us to exactly tie in seismic and core data.  

We attempted four formation temperature measurements i n Hole U1467B; however, no evidence of frictional heating occurre d upon insertion into the formation on any of them, so no reliable formation temperatures were obtained. The average mudline temperature appeared to range from $13.8^{\circ}$ to $15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Stratigraphic correlation, using available biostratigraphic an d paleomagnetic age control points, allowed us to refine and establis h a precise age model for Site U1467 that correlates the differen t physical property measurements and the downhole logging data. Results show that the bottom of the hole is in 12.7 Ma deposits.  A composite depth scale and splice at Site U1467 were constructe d from 0.0 to $220.25\;\mathrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSFD) (from the “mudline” in Hole U1467C to the bottom of Core 359- U1467B-22H).  

In the seismic profiles, the drift sequences at Site U1467 are represented by well-stratified, nearly horizontal, low- to medium-amplitude reflections and in the lower part by a succession of stron g reflections separated by zones of weak echoes comprising DS1– DS3. The base of the drift succession lies at 1337 ms TWT and i s underlain by the drilled distal bottomsets of the platform sequences. Site U1467 is located in a basinal position where all sequence boundaries appear as continuous parallel reflections, whic h are the correlative conformities to the unconformities along the basin margin that define the sequence boundaries. The thickness o f the drift sequences varies from $24.5\mathrm{~m~}$ (DS7) to $104~\mathrm{m}$ (DS6) an d $173~\mathrm{m}$ (DS4). Starting with DS1–DS3, the depocenter was situate d at the western basin margin and dominated by southward botto m water inflow from the northeast Kardiva Channel and inflow fro m the newly opened northwest Kardiva Channel. DS4–DS7 mark th e gradual eastward shift of the depocenters. The uppermost sequences (DS8–DS9) exhibit a more uniform thickness throughou t the Inner Sea of the Maldives.  

# Site U1468  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1468 (proposed Site MAL-03A) is located in the Kardiv a Channel in the Inner Sea at $4^{\circ}55.9823^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $073^{\circ}4.2834^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ . This site i s the easternmost site of the northern transect, $4.8~\mathrm{km}$ east of Sit e U1466 (Figure F2). At Site U1468, seismic profiles indicate a succession with the Oligocene/Miocene boundary at 727 ms TWT followed by the basinal to lower slope deposits of the lower–middl e Miocene Kardiva carbonate platform. The base of the overlyin g drift succession (reflection DS1) is a gently basinward-dipping horizon. The drift itself is 431 ms TWT thick, which equals $433\;\mathrm{m}$ . Th e modern current-swept seafloor is at $521.45\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth.  

Site U1468, together with Site U1466, is a key site to (1) constrain the timing of the platform to drift turnover, (2) date the sequence boundaries of the Kardiva platform, and (3) reconstruct th e platform evolution from the Oligocene/Miocene boundary onwar d (Aubert and Droxler, 1996; Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004a). With regard to the drift sequences, the position of Site U1468 was chose n because it bears an extended thickness of the DS1 succession and  a greater thickness of DS2 compared to the succession at Site U1466. Because the sequences of the mid-Miocene drift succession ar e likely to be determined by fluctuations of the bottom-current regime (Lüdmann et al., 2013), dating such variations and understanding the drift depositional facies will help to address th e paleoceanographic objective of the expedition to link the changes o f the Maldives current regime to global Neogene ocean circulation. The succession recovered at Site U1468 also provides the opportunity to retrieve a complete record of $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ variations in periplatfor m carbonates through the lower and middle Miocene for establishin g the carbon isotopic record needed to calibrate this hemipelagic record against the pelagic record.  

# Principal results  

Two holes were drilled at Site U1468. Hole U1468A cored 873. 7 m of carbonates (with $53\%$ recovery) using a combination of th e APC, HLAPC, and XCB coring systems. Hole U1468B was drille d as a dedicated logging hole with the RCB system to 874.7 mbsf. Sediments from a variety of depositional settings were recovered at Sit e U1468. The top formed a drift package that comprises lithostratigraphic Units I–IV, and the Miocene distal slope and the basinal deposits of the Kardiva platform form lithostratigraphic Unit V.  A restricted basin environment defines lithostratigraphic Unit VI. Lithostratigraphic Units VII and VIII are shallow-water deposits.  

Unit I (0–45.7 mbsf) is dominated by light gray and pale yello w to white unlithified to partially lithified packstone to grainstone. Deposits are rich in planktonic foraminifers and contain abundan t benthic foraminifers, ostracods, pteropod fragments, Halimeda fragments, mollusk fragments, echinoid fragments and spines, otoliths, fish remains, and very rare bryozoans. Foraminifers and bioclasts are well preserved with aggregate grains, organic matter, an d yellow- to brown-stained lithoclasts. The fine fraction contains aragonite needles $(<\!5\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ , calcite crystals $(5{-}10~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and calcareou s nannofossils (coccoliths). Variations in grain size and texture, i n particular the gradual change from packstone to grainstone layers, are interpreted to be the result of changing current strength.  

Unit II (45.7–192.4 mbsf) mainly consists of unlithified to partially lithified rudstone to wackestone with abundant to frequen t large benthic foraminifers (Figure F20). The matrix throughout th e entire unit contains abundant calcite crystals and very rare dolomit e rhombs and calcareous nannofossils. Rudstone layers containin g rip-up clasts, other small lithoclasts, echinoid spines and fragments, and other large bioclasts often form the base of graded beds tha t have a slight erosional base and fine upward to a fine-grained grainstone (Figure F21).  

Unit III (192.4–296.4 mbsf) is a light brownish gray to light gra y wackestone succession with intercalations of packstone. This unit i s characterized by the reappearance of planktonic foraminifers an d the disappearance of large benthic foraminifers. Intraclasts ar e common, indicating early marine cementation and reworking. Mos t bioclasts are heavily overgrown with dogtooth calcite crystals. Th e matrix contains abundant calcite crystals, whereas sponge spicule s are minimally present within the fine matrix. Calcareous nannofossils are extremely rare to absent.  

Unit IV (296.4–427.7 mbsf) consists of lithified packstone t o wackestone. Components in this unit include bioclastic fragments, as well as planktonic and benthic foraminifers that are severel y overgrown by calcite cements. The degree of bioturbation in thi s unit  allows  the  identification  of  several  ichnotaxa,  includin g Thalassinoides, Palaeophycus, Planolites, and Chondrites. Occasionally, some burrows are silicified.  

Massive wackestone makes up lithostratigraphic Unit V (427.7– 728.6 mbsf). Throughout the unit are alternations of light and dar k intervals; the darker color is linked to a higher abundance of organi c material. The main components in this unit are planktonic foraminifers, with benthic foraminifers, mollusk fragments, and bioclas t fragments. The components found have calcite cement overgrowth. The well-preserved ichnotaxa identified within this unit includ e Thalassinoides, Teichichnus, Asterosoma, Phycosiphon, Zoophycos, Palaeophycus, Planolites, and Chondrites.  

Unit VI (728.6–815.9 mbsf) is a wackestone to packstone succession that consists of light gray chalk with intercalations of dar k gray to black layers with abundant organic matter (Figure F22) . Planktonic foraminifers are abundant, and the rock matrix consist s of calcareous nannofossils.  

Unit VII is layered wackestone with floatstone intercalation s containing large benthic foraminifers Amphistegina, Lepidocyclina, Cycloclypeus, and Miogypsina.  

Unit VIII forms the lowest part of the cored succession at Sit e U1468. It is densely cemented limestone that contains abundan t shallow-water biota such small and large benthic foraminifers, Halimeda plates, bivalve fragments, and bryozoan and coral fragments.  

Biostratigraphic analysis of the microflora and microfauna allowed us to divide the succession into four intervals. Interval  A reaches to ${\sim}45$ mbsf and ranges in age from the late Pliocene t o Quaternary. The lower part of the Pliocene is missing. The nannofossils are generally sparse, with the exception of well-preserve d coccoliths in the uppermost sample. Planktonic and benthic foraminifers are moderately abundant in this interval. Interval B extends from about 45 to 429 mbsf. It comprises middle to lat e Miocene calcareous microfossils, which are generally sparse an d poorly preserved throughout the succession. One sample at 40.5 9 mbsf contains a few late Miocene to Pliocene–Pleistocene specimens of planktonic foraminifers mixed with abundant abraded an d recrystallized large foraminifers. The base of biostratigraphic Interval B corresponds to the base of the drift sequence as determined b y seismic stratigraphy and lithostratigraphy. Interval C encompasse s the middle Miocene to upper Oligocene between 447.3 and 827. 4 mbsf with abundant and moderately to well-preserved calcareou s nannoplankton. The lowest Interval D contains mainly large benthic foraminifers derived from the forereef environment.  

Geochemical analyses of the sediments revealed that minima l changes in the $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{\;\;2-}/\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ ratio and alkalinity of the interstitial fluid s in the uppermost $200\,\mathrm{~m~}$ indicate either relatively low rates of organic matter remineralization or rates of advection by bottom seawater that are faster than the rates of decomposition of organi c matter. Below 200 mbsf, a net decrease in the concentration of $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{\ 2-}$ – is caused by bacterial sulfate reduction. The aragonite concentration in the sediments as measured by XRD remains between $20\%$ and $40\%$ throughout the uppermost $50\textrm{m}$ , reflecting variations i n input rather than diagenetic change to LMC. The sudden loss i n aragonite below ${\sim}50$ mbsf suggests a period of exposure to fluid s that caused partial dolomitization. Neomorphism of the sediment s to LMC and some limited amount of dolomitization is indicated b y the rapid increase in the $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}/\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ratio of the pore water below 20 0 mbsf. Although dolomite formation is supported by the decline i n the $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ ratio of the pore fluid, the present dolomite formatio n indicated by pore water data is not responsible for the up to $25\%$ dolomite found in the sediments. This indicates that dolomite mus t have formed during earlier time periods in a different fluid regim e than observed at the present. The large increase in $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ in lithostratigraphic Unit III causes the pore fluids to attain saturation wit h respect to $\mathrm{SrSO_{4}}$ and precipitation of celestine, detected by XRD.  

The influence of noncarbonate components on pore wate r chemistry can be seen between 450 and $500~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , where the carbonate content of the sediments decreases to $\mathord{\sim}80\%$ . Here, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ in th e pore waters increases slightly. Increased Fe in the sediments and th e marked increase in the $\mathrm{Mn}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratio below this depth clearly indicate the significance of this transition, which is reflected in a significant reduction in the rate of sedimentation as indicated b y biostratigraphic data.  

Paleomagnetic analyses show that contamination of the cor e sediment with highly magnetic material persisted at Site U1468, only slightly attenuated when compared to previous sites. Thi s problem is unambiguously shown by the typical pattern of the NR M intensity that decreases from the upper to lower part of each core b y 3 or 4 orders of magnitude. It has been noticed that APC an d HLAPC cores drilled in the upper part of Hole U1468A seem mor e affected by this problem compared to XCB cores drilled in the deepest part of the same hole even though APC cores used nonmagneti c core barrels. The distribution of inclinations, despite the large scatter, has a single mode at $0^{\circ}$ , suggesting that Site U1468 crossed th e Equator during the early Miocene.  

The strata at this site can be divided into five physical propertie s units. NGR has the most variability and basically defines the physical properties units, but other properties also contribute. For example, in physical properties Unit 1 $(0{-}50\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ), bulk density is lo w and porosity is high. At this depth they shift abruptly to higher (density) and lower (porosity) values, and subsequently they only show  a slight increase and decrease, respectively, to the bottom of the hole. Porosity remains very high even to great burial depths, with ove r $50\%$ porosity at 800 mbsf. Likewise, velocity only displays a sligh t overall increase in physical properties Units 2–5 to about $2400\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , but high values of up to ${\sim}4000\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ are measured in the more lithified beds. A velocity inversion occurs in physical properties Unit  4 that is lithologically the chalk interval of lithostratigraphic Unit VII.  

Color reflectance quantifies the observed cyclic dark–light alternations in the rock but also captures the overall darker tones o f lithostratigraphic Units II and IV. Magnetic susceptibility logge r (MSL) values are like the other magnetic properties impacted b y contamination. After filtering erroneous high values, most MSL values are very low with a range of $-4{-}2\ \mathrm{IU},$ , and point magnetic susceptibility (MSP) values are $^{-15}$ to $^{-5}$ IU. Thermal conductivit y values increase rapidly from 0.9 to $1.16\ \mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{K})$ above ${\sim}83$ mbs f and more gradually below ${\sim}83$ mbsf to $1.5\,\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ at the bottom o f Site U1468 with many fluctuations.  

A dedicated logging hole was drilled at Site U1468 to ensure  a complete set of downhole measurements. During the first loggin g run with the triple combo tool string, however, wireline tension increased at $485\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ and caliper measurements indicated a narrow borehole less than 7 inches in diameter. These collapsing hol e conditions persisted to $280\,\textrm{m}$ WSF, above which the logging ru n could be completed. No additional logging tool strings were run. I n the narrow interval of the collapsing hole, the data quality was reduced but the lower and upper portion yielded good data. On e characteristic of the logging suite is the low density and high porosity that are present in the deeper portion of the hole. Measurement s on the discrete samples have shown porosities of $40\%{-}50\%$ for mos t of the logged interval. These high porosities are at the limit of wha t the logging tool can measure. This might explain the high values o f $60\%{-}80\%$ for large portions of the hole.  

Based on the electrical resistivity and gamma ray logs, four logging units were identified. Logging Unit 1 extends from the base o f the drill pipe to $201\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline log matched depth below seafloo r (WMSF) and is characterized by low gamma ray and resistivity values, both with low to moderate amplitude variability except for tw o peaks around 190 and $200\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. Logging Unit 1 correlates mostl y with lithostratigraphic Unit II, which in the logged interval display s an overall coarsening-upward trend and textures from mudstone t o packstone at the base and grainstone to rudstone at the top. In logging Unit 2 (201–490 m WSF), the character of the resistivit y changes with alternations of lower and higher resistivity over intervals of meters to tens of meters. The gamma ray log is nearly flat, except at the base of the unit between 450 and $490\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. Thi s logging unit corresponds to lithostratigraphic Units III, IV and par t of V. Units III and IV correspond to the drift sediments of DS1 (Figure F23), which is composed of wackestone with some packston e intervals (Unit III) and lithified packstone (Unit IV). Intervals o f higher gamma ray and corresponding resistivity variations at th e base of logging Unit 2, from 450 to $490\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF, capture alternation s of submeter to multiple meter scale light and dark intervals deposited at the distal bottomsets of the prograding Kardiva platform. Logging Unit 3 is entirely within the bottomsets of the progradin g platform characterized by the alternations of darker and lighte r packstones to wackestones. The resistivity log reflects this rathe r uniform lithology with low variability values that slightly increas e with depth. The gamma ray log displays more variability from low t o moderate amplitude and also increases with depth. These variation s in the gamma ray signature are mostly the result of uranium variations that are likely related to changes in the organic material tha t varies from the dark (high) to light (low) intervals. In logging Unit  4 (720–835 m WSF), the resistivity amplitude changes from low t o moderate. Likewise, the gamma ray log exhibits the greatest variability compared to the other units. Again, the amplitude and variability of the gamma ray log are mainly caused by the uraniu m content. Lithologically, Unit 4 coincides with a thick upper Oligocene–lower Miocene package of chalky sediment with intercalations of dark organic-rich layers. These dark layers are taken a s indicators of higher productivity and lower oxygenation durin g times of deposition.  

Although no sonic log or VSP could be run at Site U1468, tw o high-impedance events identified by distinct lithology changes i n the core helped us build a robust velocity model for the time-dept h correlation on the seismic profiles. The first impedance event i s generated by the top of the densely cemented shallow-water limestone of the Oligocene carbonate platform at 854.7 mbsf (1398 m s TWT) and the overlying wackestone–floatstone; the second is  a densely cemented grainstone interval with a top surface at 540 mbs f (1198 ms TWT). These two surfaces are used as “check shots” fo r refining the velocity model.  

The penetrated seismic section at Site U1468 displays four mai n seismic facies (Figure F24). At the bottom are near-horizontal seismic reflections with a distinct high-amplitude reflection that corresponds to a lithified bioclastic floatstone at the top of the Oligocen e shallow-water carbonate platform, which produces the Oligocene/Miocene boundary $(\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{M})$ reflection. The $\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{M}$ reflection wa s defined by Belopolsky and Droxler (2004a) as the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, but shipboard biostratigraphic analysis of the calcareous nannoplankton and planktonic foraminifers indicates tha t the Oligocene/Miocene boundary is located further upsection between 769.74 and 779.36 mbsf (i.e., between the O/M horizon an d PS1). This interval is composed of a nannofossil chalk package wit h intercalations of organic-rich layers. Above this chalk package ar e near-horizontal low-amplitude reflections that are the distal bottomsets of Kardiva platform sequences PS1–PS11 (427.7–724.5 6 mbsf). These reflections are composed of bioturbated planktoni c foraminiferal wackestone to packstone with meter-thick alternations of darker and lighter layers. Sections of alternating amplitud e intensities are likely caused by pulses of deposition and intermitten t slow sedimentation and associated diagenesis (Anselmetti et al., 2000; Malone et al., 2001). The age of these prograding sequence s ranges from middle Burdigalian to Langhian or approximately fro m 21 to $12.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The onset of the drift sequences lies at 434 mbsf and is indicate d by wavy high-amplitude reflections. Generally, DS1 displays a larg e mounded geometry with high-amplitude parallel reflections tha t conjugate basinward. The lower part of DS1 consists of lithified bioclastic packstones to wackestones. DS2 consists of high-amplitude, slightly inclined seismic reflections and is composed of a series o f unlithified to partially lithified coarsening-upward packages of larg e benthic foraminiferal grainstone to rudstone. At the top of DS2, th e reflections become nearly horizontal, marking the apex of the drif t mound that continues into the base of DS9. At Site U1468, the sequence boundaries of DS3–DS9 merge into two horizontal reflections separated only by approximately $20\,\textrm{m}$ . DS9 and DS10, th e uppermost drift sequences, show undulating high-amplitude reflections and a facies of mud-poor bioclastic packstones and grainstones, similar to modern seafloor sediments.  

# Site U1469  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1469 (proposed Site MAL-8A) lies $2.87\ \mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{(1.57\nmi)}$ south-southwest of Site U1465, which is the westernmost site of th e northern transect in the western part of the Kardiva Channel (Figure F2). It is located at $4^{\circ}54.41^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $73^{\circ}0.48^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , at a water depth of 42 7 m. The Kardiva Channel is a wide west-east–oriented passage tha t dissects the north-south–running double row of the Maldives atoll s (Purdy and Bertram, 1993; Aubert and Droxler, 1996). The Kardiv a Channel formed as a result of the demise of larger carbonate bank s during the Miocene (Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004a, 2004b; Betzle r et al., 2009). The northern transect, including Site U1469, is in th e approximately $12\ \mathrm{km}$ wide northwestern branch of the Kardiv a Channel between the Goidhoo atoll and the Maalhosmadulu atoll. At present, this passage accommodates seasonally reversing an d monsoonal-driven water throughflow. Currents affect the wate r column down to the sediment surface and trigger erosion at the seafloor and migration of large-scale carbonate sand and mud waves. This depositional regime has persisted since the Miocene, and th e hypothesis to test is that the onset of current and partial drownin g of the carbonate banks were intimately linked (John and Mutti, 2005; Betzler et al., 2009; Eberli et al., 2010). Seismic stratigraph y and facies indicate that the onset of this current was a rapid proces s and that the intensity of the currents varied through time (Lüdman n et al., 2013).  

Site U1469 was selected to document and reconstruct the carbonate bank depositional system of the drowned Miocene bank an d to link the seismic sequences to facies. This link is possible becaus e the drowning unconformity (i.e., the surface that forms the top o f the last growth episode of the carbonate bank) does not mask underlying geometries at this site. The target depth was 700 mbsf, which is the base of PS7, the first sequence after the Kardiva platform went from mostly aggrading growth to progradation.  

The specific objectives of Site U1469 were (1) to provide a detailed  reconstruction  of  the  predrowning,  drowning,  an d postdrowning evolution of the carbonate bank by linking the seismic stratigraphic record to the sedimentary record (i.e., depositional facies); (2) to constrain the timing of this evolution, thu s allowing age assignments of unconformities, sedimentary interruptions, sedimentary turnovers, and onset of drift deposition; an d (3) to reconstruct and date bank to drift turnover.  

# Principal results  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1469 was expected to b e comparable to that at Site U1465, with a package of loose drift carbonate sands overlying the limestones of the drowned platform. Although recovery was expected to be low, this site was cored with th e RCB system because only faulty sleeves for XCB coring were available at the time of drilling.  

Three lithostratigraphic units are defined at Site U1469 base d on visual core descriptions and thin section analyses. Lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0{-}93.0~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) represents the youngest hemipelagi c deposits, which consist of partly lithified to lithified, gray-brown t o pale yellow, coarse-grained very well sorted grainstone to packstone. Bioclasts are typical open marine pelagic fauna and mino r proportions of skeletal benthic fauna that may have originated clos e to the active atolls and transported by the currents to the Kardiv a Channel.  

During deposition of lithostratigraphic Unit II (93.0–141. 7 mbsf), the coarse-grained grainstone to rudstone contained increased amounts of benthic foraminifers and admixtures of corals, bivalves, Halimeda, and echinoderm spines. The coarser grain siz e and the microfaunal assemblage indicate a shallower and higher energy current-dominated environment compared to Unit I. Thes e deposits cover the top of a drowned carbonate platform that make s up lithostratigraphic Unit III (141.7–153.4 mbsf). The lithologies o f Unit III consist of dolomitized coral-rich floatstone with massiv e and branching coral fragments, rhodoliths, gastropods, and othe r encrusting organisms interpreted as a shallow-marine reef to forereef depositional setting (Figure F25).  

Because of poor recovery, no continuous record of core catcher s could be obtained. As a result, the biostratigraphic age model fo r this site is limited, but both the planktonic foraminifers and the calcareous nannofossils indicate a Quaternary to early Pliocene age fo r sediments above the drowned platform. Planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy identified two Pleistocene biohorizons, the last occurrences  (LOs)  of  Globigerinoides  fistulosus  (1.88  Ma)  an d Globorotalia limbata $(2.39\,\mathrm{\:Ma})$ , which were found at 44.57 an d 63.96 mbsf, respectively. The Pliocene LOs of Dentoglobigerina altispira (3.47 Ma) and Globorotalia margaritae were found at 63.9 6 and 73.7 mbsf, respectively. The occurrence of nannofossils i s sparse and poorly preserved. Thus, no assemblages are unambiguously datable. However, the presence of small Gephyrocapsa specimens in the upper part of the sequence $(25{-}93\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ indicates tha t these samples are Quaternary to middle Pliocene in age (Zone s NN21 to NN14). Similarly, the consistent presence of Sphenolithus specimens in the lower part of the site (73.6–122.1 mbsf) suggest s that this part of the sequence is middle Pliocene or older (Zon e NN15 or older), although they could be reworked. No Miocen e marker species were seen. The drowned platform does not contai n any age-diagnostic benthic foraminifers, but seismic stratigraphi c evidence places a middle Miocene age at the drowning surface.  

At Site U1469, no IW samples were obtained. The carbonat e content in seven sediment samples above the platform yielded carbonate contents between 94.95 and $97.95~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and their total organic carbon is between 0.04 and $0.15~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The mineralogy of th e sediment consists of aragonite, HMC, LMC, and dolomite. HMC i s present only to 25 mbsf and reaches a maximum of $8.9\%$ . Aragonit e occurs at concentrations between $10.7\%$ and $49.0\%$ from the surfac e to 73.6 mbsf. Below this depth, most of the aragonite and all of th e HMC neomorphosed to LMC. Dolomite is present with a low abundance of $<\!3.3\%$ above 93 mbsf. Below 93 mbsf, dolomite increases t o concentrations between $4.4\%$ and $30.9\%$ , and the concentration o f aragonite decreases. $C/\Nu$ ratios of the samples collected for headspace analyses suggest organic matter with a marine origin. Th e platform carbonates at 153.22 mbsf are completely dolomitized. $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratios are high $(1.26{-}3.32\;\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{mol})$ above 80 mbsf. Belo w that depth, they decrease to $<\!1.2\;\mathrm{mmol}/\mathrm{mol}.$ .  

Paleomagnetic measurements of intensity, declination, and inclination on platform carbonates below 151 mbsf yielded som e magnetostratigraphic information. One reversal is recognized a t 153.8 mbsf and is normal below. In addition, a possible short reversal occurs at 153.9 mbsf.  

Physical properties fall into two groups that correspond to th e Pliocene–Pleistocene drift sediments (physical properties Unit 1 ) and the carbonate platform succession (physical properties Unit 2). The slightly lithified grainstone to rudstone facies of the drift sediment displays low NGR that increases downhole. As in the drift sediments of the other sites, bulk density is low $(1.5{-}2.0\;\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , porosity is very high, ranging from $42\%$ to $52\%$ , and $P$ -wave velocit y reaches $2562\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . The dramatic facies change to platform carbonates at 141.7 mbsf is also reflected in the physical properties. Th e dolomitized limestone has high NGR values. Bulk density average s $2.5\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , whereas grain density is $2.84\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , confirming the complete dolomitization of this interval. Porosity is between $15.4\%$ an d $22.8\%$ . Despite relatively high porosity, velocities are over $5000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . This can be explained by the dominance of the moldic pore type s that produce a rock with a stiff framework.  

The time-depth conversion for correlating the seismic sequenc e to the lithology relied on the velocity model from Site U1465, whic h has a similar lithology. Similar to Site U1465, Site U1469 is at th e margin of the drowned Kardiva platform and overlain by drift deposits (Figure F26). At this location, however, the sequence stratigraphic interpretation indicates a younger age for the top of th e Kardiva platform. Additionally, the drift sequences overlying DS 4 are more complete. The seismic facies of the drowned Kardiva platform displays a series of prograding clinoforms with slightly basinward inclined topsets and steep foresets that flatten out basinward. The overlying drift deposits are horizontal, semicontinuous, medium-amplitude reflections of DS4–DS10 and are interpreted to b e late Miocene to recent in age. The drift succession consists o f coarse-grained grainstones that are early Pliocene to recent in age i n the upper part, but no age-diagnostic fossils were found in the portion directly overlying the drowned platform. The drowned platform top is part of PS11, which was interpreted to be middl e Miocene in age. Shore-based radiometric dating will be needed t o assess the exact age.  

# Site U1470  

# Background and objectives  

The western Kardiva Channel that connects the open India n Ocean with the Inner Sea of the Maldives is divided into norther n and southern branches by the Goidhoo atoll. The second transect o f sites drilled during Expedition 359 is located in this souther n branch of the Kardiva Channel. Site U1470 (proposed Site MAL08A) is the westernmost site of this southern transect (Figure F2 ) and has a geographical position of $4^{\circ}45.9823^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $72^{\circ}59.0267^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , and  a water depth of $399.7\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The site was positioned where seismic data indicated that a carbonate platform existed during the early stages of drift deposition. This seismic relationship implied that at this location the platfor m drowning is younger than in the northern Kardiva Channel. Th e main goal at Site U1470 was therefore to recover the drift to platform succession, which contains a platform that drowned at a late r stage than the platforms in the northern transect. The specific objectives were (1) to provide a detailed reconstruction of th e predrowning, drowning, and postdrowning evolution of the carbonate bank by linking the seismic stratigraphic record to the sedimentary record (i.e., depositional facies); (2) to constrain the timin g of this platform drowning and the burial by drift sediments; and (3 ) to reconstruct the neritic carbonate factory of a bank growing in th e current-dominated depositional system.  

# Principal results  

Site U1470 penetrated $147.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of carbonate sands and $186.2~\mathrm{m}$ of limestone from the underlying carbonate platform. The uppermost $59.1\;\mathrm{m}$ (lithostratigraphic Unit I) of the sheeted drift deposit s was unlithified coarse-grained grainstone to packstone with abundant planktonic foraminifers but also benthic foraminifers, ostracods, pteropods, echinoderm spines, bryozoan fragments, an d bivalves, as well as yellow-red–stained lithic grains and red alga e fragments. In lithostratigraphic Unit II (59.1–147.8 mbsf), th e grainstones become more lithified and the composition changes t o a diverse assemblage of bioclasts (bivalve fragments, benthic foraminifers, echinoderm spines, planktonic foraminifers, and bryozoan and red algae). Crystal overgrowth and cementation i s pervasive and was detrimental for biostratigraphy.  

Three lithostratigraphic units were identified in the platfor m succession. Lithostratigraphic Unit III (147.9–188.4 mbsf) comprises coral-rich floatstone to boundstone, documenting a shallowwater reefal environment at the top of the drowned platform. Lithostratigraphic Unit IV (198–207.7 mbsf) is a bioclast-rich grainston e to rudstone that, with its composition of large benthic foraminifers, red algae, green algae (Halimeda), and coral fragments, resembles  a reef-apron facies. Lithostratigraphic Unit V (207.7–334.11 mbsf) i s a reef facies with interbedded grayish brown coral-rich boundston e and red algae floatstone. Coral fragments include massive, platy, and branching forms. Rhodoliths are present in different sizes up t o $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ long with branching irregular shapes.  

Micropaleontological analysis (Figure F27) of the core sample s from the drift package above the platform carbonates allowed us t o define a sequence of biostratigraphic events and a well-constraine d age model for the upper part of the sedimentary succession tha t spans from the Quaternary to the lower Pliocene. As at other sites, however, throughout this interval the planktonic foraminifers consistently indicate older ages and lower sedimentation rates than th e calcareous nannofossils. For the lower part of the cored interval, lower Pliocene and possibly uppermost Miocene, only a singl e planktonic foraminiferal event was identified. This suggests that th e sedimentation rate remained constant throughout the Pliocene a t ${\sim}2.2\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ and that the base of the drift sequence is older than 5.9 2 Ma.  

The concentrations of major anions and cations determine d from interstitial water chemistry display near constant and close t o seawater values through the uppermost $150\,\textrm{m}$ of the unlithifie d drift sediments. This lack of gradient and thus indication of diagenetic alteration is in contrast to the changes in carbonate mineralog y across the same interval that document the disappearance of HM C and formation of small amounts of dolomite (Figure F28). This pattern was observed at several other sites during Expedition 359 an d might be the result of massive advection that dilutes the signature o f diagenesis in the pore water of highly porous drift sediment. Th e drowned platform cored at Site U1470 is mostly limestone with onl y a short interval with $20\%$ dolomite and preserved aragonite betwee n 200 and 250 mbsf. In the platform strata recovered at Sites U146 9 and U1465, the drowned platform is considerably more dolomitized.  

The paleomagnetic analysis was severely hampered by tw o problems: a persistent contamination that typically affected the firs t two sections of each core (this problem was already observed at th e other sites) and a novel artifact that mostly affected measurement s below 60 mbsf in Hole U1470A. Starting from Core 359-U1470A8H, the measured paleomagnetic directions of the “uncontaminated” portion of each core show a constant direction toward eas t with a subhorizontal inclination $(\sim\!090/00)$ , independent of the actual core orientation. A correction was applied to this second problem, and the corrected values looked more credible, even suggestin g the presence of some reversals in the declination record. Inclinatio n values were rather high, however, and given all the uncertainties associated with these measurements, we did not attempt to interpre t these results as a record of geomagnetic polarity changes.  

The sedimentary succession from Site U1470 is divided int o three physical properties units based on the changes observed i n NGR, $P.$ -wave velocity, bulk density, and porosity measurements. Physical properties Units 1 and 2 $(0{-}148~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) comprise uppe r Miocene to recent drift sediments. The entire package has very hig h porosity, although in Unit 1 porosity decreases from $80\%$ to $60\%$ with a more gradual decrease ranging from $60\%$ to $40\%$ in physical properties Unit 2. Sonic velocity is low (average $=1725\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ ) and increases slightly to the bottom of Unit 2. NGR fluctuates with hig h frequency throughout these two units but has a low at the uni t boundary. Physical properties Unit 3 (148–334.1 mbsf) consists o f samples from the carbonate platform succession identified by th e abrupt increase of velocity and density values and a concomitan t decrease in porosity. Velocity varies widely from 2000 to $5000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ .  

The interpreted seismic data show that the drift sequences overlying the drowned platform are mostly subparallel, semicontinuou s reflections, mainly of medium amplitude. The top of the drowne d carbonate platform is indicated by strong reflections of a lower frequency (Figure F29). To the west, at a distance of around $400\,\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , thi s platform package thins out and DS3 and DS2 almost merge. DS 1 and DS2 at this locality therefore bear a platform succession tha t postdates the drowning event recognized at Sites U1465 and U1469. The DS2 relict bank package is characterized by an elevated top an d shows basinward-dipping reflections in its eastern part. To the west, these reflections abut the basal sequence boundary of DS3, whic h can be explained by two processes. This stratal pattern could show  a late-stage predrowning reef package or it might reflect erosion o f the reef-related strata.  

DS10 and DS9 correspond to lithostratigraphic Unit I, whic h consists of an unlithified planktonic foraminifer–rich grainstone. This package is followed by the partly lithified bioclastic grain- t o packstone of lithostratigraphic Unit II, which comprises DS3–DS8. The bounding unconformity of DS3 corresponds to the top of th e shallow-water platform limestone (lithostratigraphic Unit III). Th e top of the coral-rich boundstone and floatstone in lithostratigraphi c Unit V is the reflector for DS1.  

# Site U1471  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1471 (proposed Site MAL-07A) is the eastern end of th e southern transect at $4^{\circ}45.9828^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $073^{\circ}08.1146^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , in a water depth o f $419.3~\mathrm{m}$ in the Inner Sea (Figure F2). Geologically, the site is positioned on the distal portion of the prograding drift where it thin s and is overlain by the sheeted drift deposits. The target depth is i n the distal bottomsets of the sea level–controlled platform sequence s underneath the drift, estimated to be at about 950 mbsf (Figure F5) .  

At this location, all sequence boundaries are conformable; therefore, cores from this site were expected to provide a continuous an d expanded record of current evolution from the middle Miocen e throughout the Pleistocene.  

The specific objectives for Site U1471 were (1) to constrain th e age of onset of current-dominated sedimentation; (2) to analyze th e cyclostratigraphy of drift deposits, therefore providing reconstructions of changes in the current regime and monsoon cyclicity; an d (3) to constrain the timing of sequence boundaries within the drif t and the youngest platform sequence.  

# Principal results  

An $889\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of drift deposits above $110.9\;\mathrm{m}$ thic k distal platform bottomsets was retrieved at Site U1471. Seven lithostratigraphic units are distinguished in the drift deposits that reflec t the degree of current-controlled winnowing and diagenetic overprint. Lithostratigraphic Unit VIII comprises the periplatform deposits in the distal bottomsets. Lithostratigraphic Units I–III $\left(0-\right.$ $180.1\ \mathrm{mbsf}\$ ) consist of planktonic foraminifer–rich packstone t o wackestone that is heavily bioturbated, often producing a mottle d appearance. All three units contain benthic foraminifers, echinoderm spines, pteropods, sponge spicules, calcareous nannofossils, and mollusk fragments in addition to abundant planktonic foraminifers. The degree of lithification was used to distinguish unlithifie d Unit I from partly lithified Unit II, and the predominance of th e wackestone texture was taken as the criteria to separate Unit III. Al l three units contain alternations of intervals with darker and lighte r colors. These alternations range from ${\sim}1$ to $10\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and the darke r portion of the alternation is generally much thinner $(\sim\!20\%$ of th e total). The dark intervals comprise higher amounts of organic material and tunicates but fewer benthic foraminifers compared to th e lighter intervals.  

Lithostratigraphic Units IV (180.1–254.6 mbsf) and V (254.6– $588.2\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ) have a similar texture and consist predominantly o f planktonic foraminifer–rich packstone. These units differ in th e amount of lithification rather than composition, with alternatin g lithified and unlithified layers in Unit IV. Unit V contains densel y cemented layers and also layers with moldic porosity. Lithostratigraphic Unit IV has some wackestone intercalations that are generally less lithified than the packstone. In both units, overgrowth o f bioclasts was prevalent. Several intervals in Unit V exhibit visibl e porosity, including intraparticle, moldic, and vuggy porosity. A t times, celestine is present, forming large crystals spanning adjacen t pores (Figure F30).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit VI was defined by the occurrence of alternations of very fine to medium-grained dark brownish packston e and dark brownish gray to light gray wackestone/packstone. In addition to planktonic foraminifers, sponge spicules, radiolarians, an d calcareous nannofossils were identified, as well as rare dolomit e crystals. Packstone intervals are thinner than those comprisin g wackestone. Packstone intervals are thicker and more prevalen t downhole. Packstone intervals are less bioturbated than wackeston e intervals, individual burrows are discernable, and lamination-lik e structures are present. The burrows are in some cases completel y flattened, and some of the noncontinuous lamination-like structures may be highly compacted burrows, possibly with organic matter.  Planolites,  Chondrites,  Palaeophycus,  Phycosiphon, Thalassinoides, Teichichnus, and Zoophycos ichnofossils were identified, in that order of abundance. Fractures in incompletely cemented beds occur as both open and cemented fractures.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit VII contains thin, loosely cemente d grainstone layers in a background sediment of fine-grained foraminifer-rich packstone. The light brownish gray to light gra y coarse-grained bioclastic-rich grainstone is between 2 and $78~\mathrm{cm}$ thick (average $=14.0~\mathrm{{cm}_{1}^{\prime}}$ ). The layers often (but not always) hav e sharp lower boundaries and a more gradational top. The grain siz e does not vary much within the grainstone layers. These layers wer e interpreted as reflecting high-energy current events within this firs t drift sequence.  

In the distal bottomsets of the prograding clinoforms of lithostratigraphic Unit VIII, the facies changes considerably from ver y fine to fine-grained, white to light gray, foraminifer-rich packston e to wackestone and from very fine grained and finer dark gra y wackestone to mudstone. Calcareous nannofossils are abundant i n both end-members; planktonic foraminifers are abundant in th e lighter packstone to wackestone and rare in the dark wackestone t o mudstone (Figure F31). Benthic foraminifers and glauconite ar e present only in the lighter packstone to wackestone. In the lighte r intervals, bioturbation is common with ichnofossils, includin g Planolites, Thalassinoides, Zoophycos, and Chondrites.  

Biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental analyses were conducted in Holes U1471A, U1471C, and U1471E and provide a robust age model at Site U1471 in the expanded section of younge r drift sequences and the tops of underlying bottomsets. Pleistocen e and late Pliocene sediments extend from the seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbs f and are defined by a succession of well-constrained events and reasonably good agreement of the data. The implied sedimentatio n rate is $4.0\;\mathrm{{cm/ky}}$ . However, there is a consistent offset between th e ages inferred from calcareous nannofossil events and those fro m planktonic foraminifers, with the planktonic foraminifers suggesting ages about $0.5\;\mathrm{My}$ older than the calcareous nannofossils. Thi s pattern was also seen in this interval at Sites U1465, U1466 an d U1467, so possibly the age calibrations of these events may need revision, at least for this area.  

In the lower Pliocene to middle Miocene sediments and rock s within the top of underlying bottomsets, preservation of planktoni c foraminifers is generally moderate to very poor, with mostly poor t o very poor preservation in the samples from Hole U1471E. Benthi c foraminifers are moderately preserved throughout this interval, with preservation decreasing downhole. Nannofossil preservation i s poor to moderate throughout most of the core. In the lower part o f Hole U1471E (Cores 37R–44R), nannofossils are generally mor e abundant and better preserved. The planktonic foraminiferal an d nannofossil events recognized in this lower Pliocene to mid-Miocene section reasonably agree with each other. They provide an inferred sedimentation rate of $8.0\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ .  

The concentrations of major anions and cations in interstitia l water of the upper 40 mbsf exhibit negligible changes, reflecting either low rates of organic matter remineralization or fast rates of advection by seawater. Below this interval, pore water profiles of man y elements start to vary, indicating numerous diagenetic processe s occurring in the sediment column. The inflection points of thes e profiles, however, did not coincide with boundaries between lithostratigraphic units.  

A decrease of sulfate coincided well with an increase in alkalinity, indicating that bacterial sulfate reduction is occurring in th e sediment column. However, a greater increase in alkalinity was expected from the ${\sim}4~\mathrm{mM}$ decrease in sulfate than was observed; th e difference is explained by the authigenic precipitation of calcite. The decrease in $M\mathrm{g}^{2+}$ and concurrent increase in $C a^{2+}$ reflects dolomitization by replacement of calcium carbonate. However, only  a minor amount of dolomite was found at this site, with the dolomit e peak at 105.55 mbsf occurring close to the maximum decrease i n $M\mathrm{g}^{2+}$ concentrations. A rapid increase in the $\mathrm{Sr^{2+}/C a^{2+}}$ ratios of th e pore water occurs below 40 mbsf, documenting the neomorphis m of aragonite sediments to LMC, which is also evident in the change s in carbonate mineralogy based on the XRD data (Figure F32). Th e large increase in $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ caused the pore fluids to attain saturation wit h respect to celestine $\left(\mathrm{SrSO_{4}}\right)$ ). The presence of celestine based o n XRD spectra and high sedimentary $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratios extends to approximately 700 mbsf. Changes in the Mn content of the pore waters an d sediments were related to the redox state. The higher Pliocene– Pleistocene $\mathrm{Mn}/\mathrm{Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratios may reflect a more reducin g environment during this time interval relative to the late Miocene. The small increase in $\mathrm{Mn}/\mathrm{Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{Ca}$ in the middle Miocene ma y be coincident with the development of the Oxygen Minimum Zon e (OMZ) as proposed by Dickens and Owen (1994).  

A cyclic pattern in carbonate content is visible when the data ar e smoothed with a five-point moving average, with alternations of ${\sim}5$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ between higher and lower values. The upper 300 mbsf has  a period of ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m}$ with seven or eight maxima within this depth interval. Where recovery was poor, from 300 to 400 mbsf, the smoothin g was not effective, but cycles with an amplitude of ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ carbonat e were again apparent between 400 and 1000 mbsf. The apparent cycles in carbonate content may be related to changes in climate o r currents, which influenced sediment supply and probably carbonat e dissolution at Site U1471.  

For establishing a magnetostratigraphy at Site U1471, the cor e orienting device was used in the upper 19 cores drilled in Hol e U1471C and in Cores 359-U1471D-6H and 7H. The magnetostratigraphy is based on the interpretation of the declinations in th e oriented APC cores that show relatively consistent directions withi n each core, with most of the reversals occurring within a single core.  

The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary was tentatively placed between Cores 359-U1471C-4H and 359-U1471D-6H (36–39 mbsf ) based on the short reversal found in Core 359-U1471D-5H, whic h was interpreted as the Jaramillo Event. Additional reversals wer e identified at 79, 84, 112, 152, 169, and 172 mbsf (Cores 359- U1471C-9H, 10H, 12H, 16H, and 19H). For unoriented Hol e U1471A cores, a smoothing moving average (six points) was use d for the inclination, and a series of magnetozones were defined as intervals with multiple consecutive sections with the same polarity. The magnetostratigraphy based on inclination only, however, has  a high degree of uncertainty because of the subequatorial paleolatitude of Site U1471.  

Analysis of physical properties allowed us to divide the sedimentary formation into six units primarily based on porosity an d NGR  measurements and  not  necessarily following lithostratigraphic unit boundaries. In physical properties Unit 1 $\left(0{-}68\;\mathrm{mbsf}\right)$ , sediments have high porosity values of $60\%{-75\%}$ decreasing downhole within the unit. Porosity, however, increases again downhole i n physical properties Unit 2 ( $68{-}138~\mathrm{mbsf})$ to reach $75\%$ . A simila r reversal of the porosity trend occurs in the lower part of the succession in physical properties Unit 6 (700–1003 mbsf), where porosit y values reach around $50\%$ and are on average higher than in physica l properties Unit 5 (320–700 mbsf). NGR counts reach values highe r than 80 counts/s in physical properties Unit 4 (180–320 mbsf) an d are the highest NGR values measured on Expedition 359 cores.  

Three logging runs were conducted at Site U1471, but only th e triple combo tool string reached the bottom of the hole. The VS I tool string encountered an unpassable obstruction at ${\sim}615\mathrm{~m~}$ WS F and the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string did th e same at $454\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. The triple combo tool string produced goo d quality data, except in three intervals where the borehole diamete r was too large. Gamma ray values are dominated by uranium, as a t other sites. The porosity log confirmed the high porosities measured in the laboratory and the unusual high porosities of the drif t deposits. Resistivity and magnetic susceptibility display simila r trends and increase slightly downhole between 50 and $400\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ They decrease from there to the bottom of the hole but have a small but abrupt decrease at the bottom of the drift. In the short interval velocity was measured, it displays a gradual increase with depth t o $400\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ with a few higher peaks. In the deepest $40\;\mathrm{m}$ of the lo g data $\langle400{-}440\mathrm{\,m\,WSF}\rangle$ ), velocity fluctuates dramatically and reache s as high as $3.5\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ . These fluctuations match the alternating lithified and unlithified lithologies observed in the cores. Four formation temperature measurements documented a low geothermal gradient of $15.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

Determining the relative positions of core gaps among the various holes at Site U1471 during coring was accomplished usin g gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density data collected at $5\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolution on the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger. NGR was also use d to evaluate sedimentary completeness for Holes U1471A, U1471C, and U1471D. High-resolution compositing was based on the $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ interval color reflectance parameter $L^{\ast}$ for all but one interval wher e $L^{\ast}$ lacked distinct patterns. The composite depth scale and splice a t Site U1471 are constructed from 0.0 to 195.71 m CCSF-D; deepe r cores from Hole U1471A are appended with a constant affine value.  

The upper $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of the $L^{\ast}$ records from Sites U1467 and U147 1 were compared to assess Late Pleistocene sections at each site. Thi s interval was correlated to $0{-}800\ \mathrm{ka}$ at Site U1467. Based on the $L^{\ast}$ records, the latest Pleistocene is slightly more expanded at Sit e U1467 than Site U1471 over the interval correlated to marine isotope Stages (MIS) 1–11. Below this level, the reflectivity $L^{\ast}$ highs ar e more expanded at Site U1471 than Site U1467. The change in relative thickness of the reflectivity highs between Site U1467 an d U1471 sedimentation may indicate subtle changes in the location o f current-controlled sedimentation at ${\sim}450\ \mathrm{ka}$ .  

Seismic stratigraphy and core data were correlated using thre e stations of the check shot survey with the VSI tool string in the upper part of the hole. To anchor our velocity model in the interval below 604.6 mbsf, where hole collapse prevented further lowerin g of the tool, we used the boundary between lithostratigraphic Unit s VII and VIII (Core 359-U1471E-33R), which marks the change fro m drift to platform sequences at 898 mbsf, as a tie point. The thre e oldest drift sequences (DS1–DS3) at Site U1471 show a pronounce d clinoform prograding reflection pattern. DS5–DS10 are classified a s elongated mounded separate drifts. Site U1471 penetrated the bottomsets of the prograding drift bodies, calibrating the seismic facie s with the depositional facies. For example, high-amplitude reflections, especially in DS3, are related to strong impedance contrast s produced by the alternation of partly lithified and lithified beds. I n DS3 and DS4, small-scale wavy reflections are interpreted as cycli c steps or bottom current–related features.  

Correlation of the seismic sequences and the biostratigraphi c age model shows that DS9 encompasses the Pleistocene. The pronounced change in lithology between lithostratigraphic Units I V and V at 254.6 mbsf correlates with the base of DS4 (261.5 mbsf ) and roughly coincides with the boundary between the Pliocene an d Miocene. The bottom of the drift that is the base of DS1 at 898 mbs f lithologically expresses the last occurrence of grainstone layers a t 898 mbsf in the upper middle Miocene.  

# Site U1472  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1472 (proposed Site MAL-06B) is in the middle of th e southern transect at $4^{\circ}46.2653^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $073^{\circ}04.0111^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{:}$ , at a water depth o f $379.34\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figure F2). The site is located well within the middle par t of the west to east prograding contourite fan. The target for corin g at this site was the lower sequence boundary of DS1, but it was no t reached because of time constraints at the end of the cruise. Corin g penetrated to 251.9 mbsf and recovered $233.75\;\mathrm{m}\;(93\%)$ , providing  a valuable data set for understanding drift deposition in the Inner Se a and the contourite fan depositional system. The specific objective s at this site were to (1) constrain the ages of the drift depositiona l sequences; (2) analyze the cyclostratigraphy of drift deposits, therefore providing reconstructions of changes in the current regime an d monsoon cyclicity; and (3) retrieve the lithology of the wavy seismi c facies to confirm their current-controlled deposition.  

# Principal results  

The succession at Site U1472 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units. Lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0{-}52.70~\mathrm{mbsf})$ consists o f unlithified packstone and grainstone texture and mud-lean fine t o medium sand. Deposits contain abundant fairly well preserve d planktonic foraminifers, pteropods, otoliths, echinoid fragments, and shell fragments. This facies is similar to the top units of all th e sequences drilled during Expedition 359. Layers of floatstone contain large bioclasts such as pteropods and solitary corals (Figur e F33). Light gray to brownish gray sediment was interpreted to reflect the presence of organic matter and also of iron in reduce d form. This sediment provides evidence for suboxic conditions at th e seafloor, as does the NGR measured on the cores. Varying graybrown color changes associated with a cyclic pattern of $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ color reflectance and NGR likely indicate that these conditions fluctuate d through time.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I has grainstone to packstone textures, whereas lithostratigraphic Unit II (52.70–195.20 mbsf) consists o f packstone to wackestone. The composition of the sediment is similar to lithostratigraphic Unit I sediments, with the difference tha t Unit II does not contain pteropods. NGR values in Unit II are distinctly lower than in Unit I, and the top of Unit II contains large bioclasts and shells, suggesting a phase of intensified bottom current.  

The transition from packstone to grainstone texture and th e grain size change from predominantly medium- to coarse-graine d sand defines the top of lithostratigraphic Unit III. Unit III is characterized by the appearance of large benthic foraminiferal assemblages typical of neritic environments. Foraminiferal shells hav e extensive overgrowths, masking their original shape. The textural, grain size, and biota assemblage changes collectively imply that thi s unit represents a shallowing-upward succession.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit IV (224.22–249.24 mbsf) is marked by  a change toward a grainstone texture and coarse-grained sand. Th e bioclast assemblage is composed of corals, red algae, large benthi c foraminifers, and bivalves. Texture, grain size, and inclined layer s indicate that these sediments were deposited under high-energ y conditions that existed on the top of the contourite fan drift sequence.  

Calcareous microfossils are present throughout the sequence, showing good preservation in the upper $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and poor to ver y poor preservation below. The calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy suggests a late Miocene age for the bottom of the sequence.  A useful sequence of biostratigraphic events through the Quaternar y and early Pliocene provides a fairly clear age model that indicates  a sedimentation rate of $2.6\,\mathrm{{cm}/\mathrm{{ky}}}$ throughout the succession. As observed at other Expedition 359 sites, planktonic foraminifers in thi s interval consistently indicate older ages and therefore lower sedimentation rates than those based on calcareous nannofossils.  

IW analysis indicates that the slight increase in chloride in por e waters at Site U1472 is higher than the increase observed at Sit e U1471 but not as strong as that at Sites U1466 or U1468. This ma y be a relict signal of Last Glacial Maximum seawater that has not ye t diffused. Negligible rates of bacterial sulfate reduction relative t o advection of seawater at Site U1472 are indicated by the constan t alkalinity concentrations with depth. XRD analysis of the sediment s showed that neomorphism of aragonite to LMC does not appear t o occur with the same intensity as at other Expedition 359 sites. Th e high abundance of aragonite even at 200 mbsf is unique to this sit e and may be related to the general lack of modern, active diagenesi s inferred from constant pore fluid profiles. The constant alkalinity a t Site U1472 also implies that the small amounts of dolomite presen t in the sediments are the result of previous episodes of alteration an d are not actively forming in the modern sediment column. Carbonate diagenesis and dolomitization must have occurred in previou s time intervals but unusually do not seem to have resulted in aragonite neomorphism to LMC.  

Measurements of the magnetic sediment properties exhibi t early vertical and negative inclinations in the uppermost 30 mbsf o f Hole U1472A that could be interpreted as a coring disturbance i n these soft and fluid-rich sediments. The rest of the inclination record, although it shows generally shallower inclination, still has  a rather erratic behavior that was not easily interpretable as a sequence of reversals.  

Because of time constraints at the end of the expedition, only  a reduced suite of physical property measurements was performed o n Site U1472 cores (primarily whole-round and split core track measurements). Four physical properties units are observed and correlate well with the lithostratigraphic units. Physical propertie s Units 1 and 2 have high NGR values in their lower parts and decreasing values toward the top. Physical properties Units 2–4 generally show lower NGR values with little variation but some isolate d peaks of higher values. Sediment bulk density at Site U1472 increases continuously downhole, whereas there is an inversion of th e $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities below 185 mbsf. As at other sites, porosity is ver y high at the top $(>\!70\%)$ and decreases to ${\sim}50\%$ at 200 mbsf.  

Site U1472 comprises a complete succession of all drift sequences (DS1–DS10) in the southern transect. For a time to dept h conversion, the check shot information from Site U1470 was use d because the sediments had similar characteristics at both sites. Sheeted DS7–DS10 are imaged by well-stratified continuous reflections of medium to low amplitude. The subhorizontal reflections o f the topsets of DS4–DS6 are discontinuous to wavy at Site U1472, but the reflections become more continuous in a distal direction t o the east. Whereas DS5 and DS6 are sheet-like, DS3 and DS4 have  a divergent pattern and thicken basinward. The calibration of thes e seismic facies was one of the objectives for Site U1472.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I corresponds to Pleistocene DS10 an d DS9. Underlying DS8–DS5 are dominated by packstones, which become increasingly lithified with depth. Large benthic foraminifer s in DS4 indicate shallow-water conditions. The transition fro m lithostratigraphic Units III to IV at 224 mbsf is within DS3 and i s accompanied by a significant increase in benthic foraminifers an d by more diverse skeletal components. Both DS3 and DS4 show  a characteristic chaotic reflection pattern of high amplitude that correlates well to the abundance of coarse material in Units III and I V and layers with downcutting erosion. Both features indicate a highenergy depositional regime within this drift sequence.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Eight sites were drilled along two transects in the Kardiva Channel in the Inner Sea of the Maldives during Expedition 359. The recovered cores retrieved material to achieve all of the objectives se t for the expedition. Beyond the acquisition of these data, coring als o revealed a series of unexpected discoveries.  

Drilling the carbonate platforms and drifts in the Maldive s aimed to recover the marine tropical record of the Neogene se a level changes and the onset of the monsoon-related current syste m in the Indian Ocean. The recovered cores and log data elucidat e both aspects with great detail. The most arresting accomplishmen t is the documentation of how the sea level–controlled carbonat e platform system thrived during the mid-Miocene Climate Optimum and abruptly transitioned into a current-dominated system i n the late middle Miocene. This transition is linked to the onset of a n early intensification of the Indian monsoon and the coeval demis e of some of the Maldivian platforms. In addition to accomplishing al l of the primary objectives, four major discoveries were made, and al l are major contributions to the fields of paleoceanography, sedimentology, biostratigraphy, and geochemistry. How these objectives an d the additional discoveries were achieved is outlined below.  

# Objectives  

1. To decipher the record of Neogene environmental changes in the Maldives sediment archive.  

Cores and downhole logs allowed us to produce a solid recor d and reconstruct Neogene environmental changes in the central Indian Ocean. Site U1468 cored the entire succession from the uppe r Oligocene to Pleistocene. Deeper cores recovered illustrate how a n Oligocene neritic carbonate platform drowned and how sedimentation turned to a hemipelagic mode. Coinciding with the Oligocen e to Miocene transition, the sedimentary regime changed to a pelagi c system characterized by events of high organic accumulation. Th e record of the sea level–controlled lower and middle Miocene carbonate platform was cored at Sites U1466 and U1467. The onset o f the monsoon wind–driven depositional system was cored at Site s U1466, U1467, U1468, and U1471. Preliminary shipboard analyse s allow precise dating of this major paleoclimatological and paleoceanographical change, as it also applies to the extension of th e OMZ into this part of the Indian Ocean. Coring produced a soli d framework to foster postcruise research of these distinct topics. W e therefore regard this objective as fully accomplished.  

2. To place the Maldives current system into the larger scale ocean current framework present during Neogene global cooling and monsoon evolution.  

Seismic data from the Maldives document mounded drift packages deposited by the ocean currents that sweep through the Inne r Sea. Today these currents are linked directly to the monsoon as the y flow from west to east during the summer monsoon and reverse direction with the onset of the winter monsoon. This changing current also occurred during Expedition 359 and served as a goo d illustration of the sedimentary and oceanographic dynamics of th e archipelago. Based on seismic stratigraphy, the onset of drift deposition coincides with cessation of sea level–controlled platform progradation during the late middle Miocene global cooling phase. I f the Miocene drift deposits are related to the monsoon, as they ar e today, the onset of the drift deposits give strong evidence of the onset or at least major strengthening of the monsoon at this time. Th e biostratigraphic age model of Expedition 359 indicates a late middl e Miocene age for the onset.  

Complete spliced sections and logging at key sites during Expedition 359 provide the potential to assemble a cycle-based astrochronology for the Neogene section in the Maldives. This highresolution chronology will allow (1) assignment of independen t ages to key biostratigraphic events in the Maldives for compariso n with those from other tropical regions; (2) assignment of more precise ages for the major sequence boundaries and unconformities; and (3) evaluation of higher resolution sedimentation rate variations.  

The age of the onset of the drift deposition and thus the curren t system in this part of the Indian Ocean is essentially the same as th e onset of the Santaren Drift in the Bahamas that is formed by th e Florida Current. Initial comparison shows that not only the onse t but also the changes in sedimentation rates within the two drif t bodies are coeval. Likewise, the onset of the current across the Marion Plateau, northeast Australia, is only slightly younger based o n data from ODP Leg 194. The synchronous evolution of the drifts indicates that the onset of the current in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans was basically simultaneous. Postcruise research will have to establish the extent of the lead and lag in each ocean.  

3. To obtain a continuous carbon isotopic record to calibrate a platform and platform margin record with the pelagic record.  

This objective was achieved by coring the platform tops at thre e sites (U1465, U1469, and U1470) and the entire Neogene periplatform strata at several sites at varying distances from the platfor m (U1468, U1467, and U1471). Together, the cored intervals will provide a complete record of the carbon isotopic record of the platfor m and platform margin sediments. Because sedimentation rates ar e high to very high in these settings, these cores provide an expande d record that will be suitable for high-resolution carbon isotope stratigraphy. In the distal portions of the prograding clinoforms, sedimentation rates were between 3.2 and $4.4~\mathrm{cm/ky},$ and in the drif t deposits, they reached $17\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . The base of the Neogene was penetrated at Site U1468, where the earliest Miocene succession was  a shallow-water carbonate lagoonal environment that developed int o a somewhat deeper basin, the paleo–Inner Sea of the Maldives, wit h fine-grained carbonates that also contain numerous dark organicrich intervals. Together with the sediments of the overlying distal bottom set from the Kardiva platform in the west, these sediment s will provide a continuous carbon isotopic record to the late middl e Miocene. The overlying late middle Miocene to recent drift deposit s were cored at Sites U1466, U1467, U1468, and U1471. Each of thes e sites covered a different age interval with a high sedimentation rate. Thus, the entire Neogene is cored, and therefore we obtained a n ideal candidate for shore-based analysis of carbon isotopes on bot h the organic and inorganic fractions. This will allow the record o f carbon isotope change to be extended back in time from the approximate 8 My record, which was already measured on sediment s from ODP Site 716, to ${\sim}25$ Ma at Site U1467. A complete comparison will be possible not only with ODP Site 1007, which penetrate d the entire Miocene, but also in relation to other platform and pelagic records over the same time period. This comparison will allo w assessment of the extent to which platform carbonates recor d changes in the global carbon cycle and determine whether change s in the carbon isotopic composition of organic and inorganic components covary and the implications this has on the deep-time record.  

# Additional discoveries  

1. Organic-rich layers indicate early Miocene oxygen minima  

At Site U1466, coring recovered an upper Oligocene to lowe r Miocene alternation of chalky white wackestone and black organicrich layers in the lower Miocene. At Site U1468, the same facies wa s recovered above neritic carbonates with large benthic foraminifers. Here, the succession with nannofossil chalk and black organic-ric h sediments is approximately $^{90\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick. Based on their positio n within the stratigraphic succession and the estimated water depth o f the Inner Sea at the time, the presumed oxygen minima condition s necessary for their formation must have formed a relatively shallo w basin.  

# 2. The shallow nature of a carbonate contourite fan  

Although the drift package in the Kardiva Channel was identified based on the geometries seen on the seismic data, the cores revealed a facies evolution that has far-reaching implications fo r interpretations of neritic carbonates. Together with lithologies fro m the cores, this drift is best classified as a contourite fan. No such system has been previously reported for carbonates. The reason thi s discovery will have major implications for carbonate sedimentolog y is that the facies within this drift is very similar to what has hithert o been described as, for example, neritic shoals, prograding delt a lobes, and so on. For example, Site U1468 cores from the apex of th e drift mound contain large benthic foraminiferal floatstones that resemble benthic foraminiferal shoals. Likewise, the prograding lobe s of this contourite fan are very reminiscent of what might be called  a tidal delta front. The documentation of this carbonate contourit e fan will thus trigger reinterpretation of deposits with these characteristics.  

# 3. Advection dominance of fluid flow  

Early diagenesis is thought to be controlled by diffusion of seawater into the underlying sediments. This diffusion-related diagenesis generally produces a characteristic depth profile of the majo r anions and cations. This general lack of variation may result bot h from high rates of advection in the high-permeability drift sediments and from different geochemical profiles and carbonate diagenesis  being  present  during  the  sedimentary  history.  Man y workers assume that the present measured pore water profile migh t have been similar throughout the history of a particular site an d used gradients in various elements and isotopes to calculate rates o f neomorphism and recrystallization (e.g., Baker et al., 1982; Richte r and DePaolo, 1987). Therefore, the findings made during Expedition 359 question one of the basic assumptions inherent in suc h modeling studies.  

# 4. Planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil biostratigraphy  

During Expedition 359, age models were constructed with a succession of well-constrained events of calcareous nannofossils an d planktonic foraminifers, which generally were in good agreement. However, through much of the Pleistocene and Pliocene intervals i n all cores there was a consistent offset between the ages inferre d from calcareous nannofossil events and those from planktonic foraminifers, with the planktonic foraminifers suggesting ages about 0. 5 My older than the calcareous nannofossils. This persistent patter n indicates that possibly the age calibrations of these events need revision, at least for the Maldives (i.e., the central Indian Ocean).

# Port call and transit  

Expedition 359 officially began with the first line ashore For t Hill Wharf, Berth 2W, Darwin, Australia, at $1013\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 September 2015. The initial week of Expedition 359 consisted entirely o f port call activities in Darwin, including routine resupply of consumables, offloading the previous expedition’s freight, and refueling. Unfortunately, no work could be conducted after dark because o f noise restrictions.  

IODP JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) staff and th e Expedition 359 Co-Chief Scientists boarded the vessel at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 30 September and immediately started crossover meetings with th e previous expedition’s participants. Other activities on the first da y included loading the ship operator’s air freight, the Schlumberge r logging sources, and local fresh food. In addition, a press conferenc e with the Expedition 356 Co-Chief Scientists and a public relation s tour were conducted. The second day of port call (1 October) included the ship crew change, the arrival of Expedition 359 scientists, and a tour for VIPs and media. We also offloaded Expeditio n 356 cores, loaded frozen food, and started loading drilling mud. O n 2 October, loading continued with drilling mud, drill collars, arriving sea freight, and locally-sourced laboratory supplies. Expeditio n 356 outgoing shipments were dispatched, including remainin g cores, scientists’ personal samples, and JRSO/Schlumberger airfreight.  

Completion of activities on 3 October was critical to an on-tim e departure for Expedition 359 because the port side aft crane coul d not be used during the refueling process planned for the followin g day. Therefore, all loading and storing of supplies that required th e aft crane had to be completed before moving the ship to the bunkering pier. This was further complicated because we were not able t o operate the cranes after dark and were only able to operate on e crane at a time in the afternoon.  

On 4 October, the JOIDES Resolution was relocated to the Eas t Arm Wharf refueling dock in Darwin, where bunkering activitie s commenced and the final loading of reentry cones and a box of operations hardware (Motion Decoupled Hydraulic Delivery Syste m [MDHDS]) was completed. Bunkering continued through the nigh t and was completed at $1024\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 October.  

The port pilot came aboard, and with tugs on-site, the last lin e was cast away at $1206~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 October. The pilot was discharged a t $1306\ \mathrm{h},$ and the sea passage to the Maldives began. As part of th e agreement with the Republic of Maldives, the vessel was required t o report to anchorage in Malé and clear into the country. Two Maldivian coastal observers were also scheduled to board the vessel an d participate on the expedition. In addition, Overseas Drilling Limited (ODL) planned to have one of their drillers board the ship i n Malé.  

The ship was favored with good weather and calm seas durin g the two weeks of transit. The drilling department took advantage o f the stable platform to conduct routine drilling equipment maintenance. Three time changes took place during the first week of transit with the clocks being turned back a total of $2.5~\mathrm{h},$ , placing th e vessel on $\mathrm{UTC}\,+\,8\ \mathrm{h}$ time or $13~\mathrm{{h}}$ ahead of College Station, Texa s (USA). As of $2400\,\mathrm{h}$ on Sunday, 11 October, the vessel had transite d $1869\;\mathrm{nmi}$ at an average speed of $11.9\,\mathrm{kt}$ . With 1737 nmi remainin g to our destination and a projected time of arrival at the Malé pilo t station of $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 October, the ship was approximately $18~\mathrm{{h}}$ ahead of schedule.  

Already on the third week of the expedition, the ship continue d to make good time in transit to Malé. At $1813\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 October, th e vessel crossed the Equator, entering into the Northern Hemisphere. Time was changed two more times, with the last change takin g place at $0200~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 October, placing the ship on Maldives tim e $\mathrm{(UTC+5\h}$ or $^{10\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ ahead of College Station) for the remainder o f the operational period prior to the final transit of the expeditio n from Malé to Colombo (Sri Lanka).  

The vessel arrived at the Malé pilot station at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on Sunday, 18 October, completing the $3594{\mathrm{\,nmi}}$ transit from Darwin at an average speed of $11.6\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The harbor pilot boarded the ship at $1030\;\mathrm{h}$ , and the ship proceeded to anchorage. By $1142~\mathrm{h}$ , the ship was securely anchored. Maldivian Customs and Immigration personne l cleared the ship by $1300\,\mathrm{h},$ and there was a brief visit by the Maldivian Coast Guard. During the Malé stopover, the ship was cleare d into Maldivian waters to conduct scientific coring operations ove r the next 6 week period. In addition, the Minister of Fisheries an d Agriculture from the Republic of the Maldives, accompanied by a n entourage of local news media personnel, took a brief tour of th e ship’s laboratory facilities and held a press conference with the expedition Co-Chief Scientists. A limited amount of fresh food an d supplies were brought aboard, including some spare parts. Finally, two coastal observers from the Republic of Maldives Ministry o f Defense joined the ship to sail with us until the end of coring operations. The ship was scheduled to return to Malé on 28 November t o clear the Republic of Maldives waters and disembark the two observers.  

At $2048\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 October, the harbor pilot arrived on board, an d we proceeded out of the Malé harbor. After discharging the pilot a t $2142\,\mathrm{h}$ , we began our sea passage to the first site (U1465). At $0418\,\mathrm{h}$ the next day, Monday, 19 October, the vessel completed the $65\;\mathrm{nmi}$ to Site U1465 at an average speed of $9.9\,\mathrm{kt}$ .  

# Site U1465  

# Hole U1465A  

Thrusters/hydrophones were lowered, and by $0456~\mathrm{h}$ on Monday, 19 October 2015, full control of the vessel was shifted to th e dynamic positioning (DP) system operator. A positioning beaco n was deployed at $0611\,\mathrm{h}$ . The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) and th e outer core barrel assembly were made up, and APC/XCB space-ou t was checked. A precision depth recorder (PDR) reading indicate d the seafloor was at $\mathord{\sim}514.4$ meters below rig floor (mbrf). The sinke r bars were made up, and an APC core barrel was run in the hole wit h the bit positioned at 509.4 mbrf, or $5.0\,\mathrm{m}$ above the PDR depth. Thi s core barrel was recovered empty, so the pipe was lowered an additional $9.0\textrm{m}$ for a second attempt. This time the barrel was agai n recovered empty; however, the core barrel may have hit the seafloo r because the gap at the base of the core liner contained a smal l amount of coarse sand. At this point, the drill string compensato r was opened, and the bit was lowered until it hit something hard a t ${\sim}524.4$ mbrf and again at ${\sim}528.0$ mbrf. A third attempt at startin g Hole U1465A was successful at $1405~\mathrm{h}$ with the bit positioned a t 523.4 mbrf. Core 1H recovered $7.3\,\textrm{m}$ and established a seafloo r depth of $525.8~\mathrm{mbrf}$ . It was later determined that the original PD R measurement had a $10\;\mathrm{m}$ error.  

Coring in Hole U1465A continued to a total depth of 76.6 mbsf. Nine APC cores were obtained and recovered $77\%$ of the $64.4\mathrm{~m~}$ penetrated. One HLAPC core was taken and recovered $71\%$ of th e  

$4.7\,\mathrm{m}$ advance, and a single XCB core was cut at total depth, advancing $7.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovering a mere $0.42\mathrm{~m~}(6\%)$ . Coring was problematic from the start due primarily to the highly sandy formation and  a few interspersed hard layers. The APCT-3 temperature shoe wa s deployed three times; however, analysis indicated that all measurements were suspect. The formation conditions were not good fo r core recovery or formation temperature measurement. Therefore, we halted coring when the depth objective, the ancient carbonat e platform, was reached. As planned, we transited in DP mode to th e next site (U1466). The strategy was to save time by using the sam e BHA on both holes to recover and date the thick prograding drif t succession at Site U1466 and then return to Site U1465 to rotar y core down to the target depth.  

Overall recovery for Hole U1465A was $70\%$ . The drill string wa s pulled clear of the seafloor and secured for a move in DP mode t o Site U1466. At $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 20 October, the ship began moving eas t with the thrusters down.  

# Hole U1465B  

Hole U1466B was completed at $1220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 October 2015, officially ending operations at Site U1466. The ship was moved in D P mode ${\sim}1\;\mathrm{nmi}$ back to Site U1465 while a new RCB bit/BHA was assembled. Once on station, the drill string was lowered to the se a bottom and a seafloor depth was established as 512 meters belo w sea level (mbsl). The top drive was picked up, and after spacing ou t the drill string, Hole U1465B was spudded at $0655\,\mathrm{h}$ . The hole wa s drilled to 65.9 mbsf before deploying an RCB core barrel. Continuous rotary coring began at that point and continued through Cor e 23R to 221.3 mbsf. Recovery was poor through the high-porosit y carbonate sedimentary unit. RCB half-cores were used a few time s in an attempt to improve recovery with very limited success. Ultimately, the inability to effectively clean the hole, high drillin g torque, and occasional stuck pipe led us to abandon the hole at 021 5 h on 27 October. The drill string was pulled with the top drive t o 63.5 mbsf before becoming stuck for $0.75~\mathrm{h}$ . Once the drill strin g was freed, the bit was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0610\,\mathrm{h}$ and th e top drive was set back. The ship was offset $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ east of Hol e U1465B to start Hole U1465C.  

# Hole U1465C  

A third hole at this site was not originally planned, but becaus e of the exceptionally poor recovery in Hole U1465B we decided t o make another attempt to core the formation using the HLAPC an d XCB coring systems. The target depth was reduced from the original 720 to 500 mbsf because given the sedimentological propertie s of the formation it was highly unlikely that hole conditions woul d allow penetrating even that deep. In this hole, the cores were no t oriented  and  no  temperature measurements  were  taken.  A n APC/XCB BHA was assembled with a mechanical bit release (MBR ) system above the bit even though no logging was planned. The MB R was included to have the option of releasing the bit in case the pip e became stuck in the hole. After spacing out the wireline core barrels, the drill string was lowered to the bottom, where a seafloor ta g established a mudline depth of 510 mbsl. Hole U1465C was spudded at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 October 2015. The hole was drilled to 55 mbs f before coring began. Recovery was poor; however, the objective wa s to reach $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbsf (or into the sediment drifts below the drowne d reef complex). APC/XCB coring was ultimately suspended at 233. 2 mbsf because, just as in Hole U1465B, all circulation began goin g downhole into the formation and the drillers were no longer able t o get the drill cuttings pumped out of the hole. After discussion, th e general consensus was that most likely both holes were drilled int o an area of very high porosity within the ancient reef formation, which made it impossible to further deepen either hole. Therefore, at $1430~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 October, we stopped further cleaning attempts i n Hole U1465B and ended operations at this site.  

# Site U1466  

# Transit to Site U1466  

After the ${\sim}1\;\mathrm{nm}$ transit from Site U1465 to Site U1466, the shi p was positioned over the new location by $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 October 201 5 and rig floor activities began. The top drive was picked up, and th e drill string was spaced out.  

# Hole U1466A  

At $0625\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 October 2015, Hole U1466A was started, recovering $5\textrm{m}$ of core and establishing a seafloor depth of $528.9\ \mathrm{mbrf}.$ Coring was problematic in this hole because of the abundance o f sand in the surface layers of the formation. Nevertheless, corin g with the APC and HLAPC coring systems proceeded to 100.5 mbs f (Core 12F). Three formation temperature measurements (APCT-3 ) were attempted; however, all the values were considered suspect because the characteristic friction curves did not occur. At this point, we decided to make a wiper trip because of high drilling torque. A t $^{1730\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 20 October, the drill string was pulled back to 63.1 mbs f and then washed back to bottom. With all drilling parameters bac k to normal, coring resumed at $1930~\mathrm{h}$ and continued through Cor e 20F to $155.0\ \mathrm{mbsf}$ . Once again, high drilling torque necessitated  a wiper trip. At $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 October, the drill string was recovered t o 63.1 mbsf and then washed back to the bottom of the hole at 155. 0 mbsf. As on the first wiper trip, the hole cleaned up, and all drillin g parameters returned to normal. Coring resumed at $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ and continued through Core 50X to a total depth of 326.2 mbsf. All thre e coring systems (APC, HLAPC, and XCB) were used interchangeably and with great effectiveness during this cored interval. Corin g was terminated at $0400~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 October because the depth objective was achieved and we decided the formation could be cored a t that point with the RCB coring system. The drill string was recovered and pulled back to the rig floor at $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 October, officially ending Hole U1466A and initiating Hole U1466B.  

# Hole U1466B  

An RCB BHA was lowered to the seafloor, and with the compensator open, the driller physically tagged the seafloor with the bi t at 528.0 mbrf. Drilling without coring in Hole U1466B started a t $1620~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 October 2015 at the seafloor and continued to 15 8 mbsf. A wiper trip to 61 mbsf and back to bottom was conducte d with no overpull or drag experienced and no fill noted on bottom. Drilling resumed, and 313.9 mbsf was reached by $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on $23\;\mathrm{Oc}-$ tober. A second wiper trip was conducted, and again there was n o overpull or drag noted. At the bottom, $2\;\mathrm{m}$ of fill was circulated ou t with a high-viscosity mud sweep. At $1045\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , we started RCB corin g at 314.0 mbsf. Coring continued with nonmagnetic core barrels. Poor recovery through the highly interbedded hard/soft formatio n led to a combination of full and half RCB cores. As the hole progressed and the scientific data grew, the scientists decided that th e scientific objectives had essentially been reached and terminate d the hole so that downhole logging could start. At $1150\,\mathrm{h}$ on $25\;\mathrm{Oc}-$ tober, the last RCB core (57R) was recovered at 809.7 mbsf. Hol e conditions remained good. The bit was released, and the hole wa s displaced with heavy mud. The drill string was pulled up, and th e end of the pipe was placed at 106.0 mbsf. At $1800~\mathrm{h}$ , rig-up of th e first wireline logging tool string was initiated. The triple combo tool string, without the source installed, was run in the hole. However, the tools would not pass 894.0 mbrf (366.0 mbsf). Log data wer e collected up from there, but constant tool drag indicated the hol e was rapidly deteriorating. The triple combo was back on deck a t $2100\;\mathrm{h},$ and the decision was made to abandon any further loggin g attempts in Hole U1466B. The drill string was pulled out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $2250\,\mathrm{h}$ . Hole U1466B was completed at 122 0 h on 26 October, officially ending operations at Site U1466.  

Total recovery for Site U1466 was $243.8\;\mathrm{~m~}\;(75\%)$ in Hol e U1466A and $88.54\mathrm{~m~}(18\%)$ in Hole U1466B. Of the total 106 core s recovered, 20 were full APC cores, 20 were half-length APC cores, 10 were XCB cores, and 56 were RCB cores.  

# Site U1467  

# Transit to Site U1467  

The short transit from Site U1465 to Site U1467 was complete d in $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $8.5\;\mathrm{kt}$ . At $2045~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 October 2015, the ship was unde r DP control over Site U1467. We prepared an APC/XCB BHA including a nonmagnetic drill collar for oriented piston coring and  a MBR for eventual wireline logging and as insurance for freeing  a stuck BHA.  

# Hole U1467A  

Hole U1467A was spudded at $0055~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 October 2015 wit h the bit positioned at 481 mbsl. Core 1H recovered $3.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and established a seafloor depth of $487~\mathrm{m}$ . Oriented piston coring continue d through Core 4H to 32.0 mbsf; a single formation temperature measurement (APCT-3) was made while taking Core 3H at $22.5~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ Right from the start, the coring system was not behaving normally. Barrels were seating high and then dropping down while unde r 300–400 psi pressure; the resultant jarring impact caused the shea r pins to shear and the barrels to fully stroke. To free the core barrels, 5000 lb of overpull was necessary. In an attempt to determin e whether there was some sort of blockage or a broken flapper valve, an XCB core barrel was deployed. This barrel also landed high an d also experienced an initial 5000 lb overpull. Convinced that something was wrong in the BHA, we decided to abandon the hole, recover the drill string, and inspect the coring assembly. The bi t arrived back on the rig floor at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 October. Upon inspection of the coring tools, the MBR, float valve, and landing shoulder s were all determined to be in good shape, but further inspection determined that the XCB latch sleeve was damaged, which was wh y the wireline barrels were jamming upon deployment and recovery. The latch sub and sleeve were replaced. The drill string was deployed back to the seafloor, and Hole U1467B was spudded at 143 0 h.  

# Hole U1467B  

In Hole U1467, Core 1H recovered $3.46\:\mathrm{m}$ and established a water depth of $487~\mathrm{m}$ . Oriented APC coring continued through Cor e 37H to 338 mbsf. Formation temperature measurements (APCT-3 ) were made while taking Cores 3H, 5H, 7H, and 9H (22.5, 41.5, 60.5, and 79.5 mbsf, respectively); however, all the temperature measurements appear to be erroneous. At $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 October 2015, afte r reaching refusal with the HLAPC (Core 42F at $361.4\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), corin g was suspended in order to test the MDHDS and Electronic RS (ERS ) overshot system.  

The MDHDS is being developed for use when deploying th e temperature dual-pressure tool (T2P); however, it can also be use d to deploy the Sediment Temperature Tool (SET), SET2, and sediment temperature/pressure tool (SETP). The ERS will also be usefu l for deploying future CORK thermistor strings. Both systems are deployed with the conductor cable or “wireline” that is used primaril y for downhole logging. The MDHDS system was assembled an d hung off at the rig floor, and the ERS was attached to the top of th e MDHDS. The system was deployed into the hole using the wireline, but all communication with the ERS was lost and the tool had to b e recovered back to the rig floor. Subsequent testing indicated that  a component had failed in the ERS electronic module. This was subsequently repaired, and the tool was deployed back into the hole. During the descent, however, a concern was raised about the compatibility of the MDHDS/SET system with the standard MBR an d float valve assembly in the deployed BHA. The MDHDS is designe d to be deployed through a lockable float valve (LFV) and has bee n deployed in this manner on a previous expedition. In this case,  a MBR was being run in lieu of a LFV because it provided anothe r way to free up the drill string should it become stuck in the hole. The test was suspended, and after an assessment it appeared th e MDHDS system was compatible. The SET tool being deployed wa s also compatible as long as the shear pins were not sheared in th e SET tool, as would be the case when taking a normal temperatur e measurement. There was no plan to do this during the MDHD S test; however, there was some concern that if the shear pins accidentally sheared and the SET tool scoped out, it would have bee n impossible to recover it inside the BHA because the float valve flapper engages a square shoulder. Because of this potential risk to  a high-value hole, the test was suspended and the tools were pulle d out of the hole. The system was back at the rig floor just before 030 0 h on 31 October.  

Continuous oriented APC coring resumed and continued unti l $0615~\mathrm{h}$ on 31 October, when Core 45H reached 389.9 mbsf. Cor e 45H achieved a full stroke, but at 100,000 lb overpull the barrel required drillover with the XCB core bit. Coring then continued usin g the HLAPC through Core 61F to 465.1 mbsf. Coring with th e HLAPC was suspended when the last two cores each had 100,000 l b overpull and required drillover. At $1530\;\mathrm{h},$ we switched to the XC B coring system. Coring continued through Core 77X to 617.2 mbsf. At that time, the assistant driller noted that he was getting hig h (10,000 lb) overpull when recovering the XCB core barrels. A n HLAPC was deployed, and this barrel landed high. After pressurin g up the drill string, the shear pins prematurely sheared at 400 ps i (upon impact) after being pushed through the XCB double windo w latch sleeve. These were the same symptoms experienced earlier i n Hole U1467A with the XCB latch sleeve. With the hole only $97\textrm{m}$ from the desired total depth, a meeting was called with the CoChief Scientists and technical personnel to discuss options. We decided to stop coring Hole U1467B, recover/repair the BHA, an d modify the plan for Hole U1467C. APC coring to $200\;\mathrm{m}$ was alread y planned for Hole U1467C, so we planned to add drilling to ${\sim}610\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , XCB coring to the target depth, and wireline logging.  

# Hole U1467C  

The drill string was recovered, the XCB latch sleeve was replaced, the ship was offset $20\textrm{m}$ north of Hole U1467B, and Hol e U1467C was started at $1620\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 November 2015. Core 1H established a seafloor depth of $487\;\mathrm{m}$ . By $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 November, we extended coring to 111.2 mbsf (Cores 2H–12H). Coring continued th e next day using the APC coring system through Core 22H to 198. 7 mbsf. The XCB was then used to drill ahead to 325.8 mbsf before  a center bit had to be deployed. The XCB with center bit advanced t o 578.6 mbsf, and the center bit was recovered via wireline. At $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 November, XCB coring was initiated, and it continued throug h Core 37X to 714.0 mbsf, the Environmental Protection and Safet y Panel–approved depth for the site. A mud sweep was circulated t o clean the hole one final time, and the drill string was recovered an d spaced out for wireline logging with the bit placed at 101.8 mbsf.  

At $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 November, wireline logging began. As the tripl e combo tool string was being made up, the rig crew noted backflo w of water coming from the tool joint at the rig floor. The tripl e combo tool string was removed so we could add heavy mud in th e drill pipe to prevent further backflow. While attempting to reinser t the tool string, a fiberglass connection on the bottom of the magnetic susceptibility tool broke off and the connected LFV go-devil fell through the drill string. This was not a significant concern because these go-devils were free-fall deployed in the past. After manufacturing a new fiberglass connector sleeve and changing out th e magnetic susceptibility sonde with the onboard spare, the tripl e combo tool string was redeployed. The tool string was run to th e total depth of the hole (714 mbsf) without any problems. After completing the first logging run, it was determined that the borehole diameter was too large ( $_{>17}$ inches) for collecting useful data with th e FMS-sonic and VSI tool strings. Therefore, the triple combo tool string was recovered and the tools were rigged down. We then decided to drill a dedicated logging hole utilizing a $9\%$ inch tricon e drill bit after completing one additional APC hole to $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf. The drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0010\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 November.  

# Hole U1467D  

The top drive was picked up, the drill string was spaced out t o 1.5 mbsf, and coring in Hole U1467D started at $_{0130\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 4 November 2015. This space-out was used to spread out the breaks betwee n cores in adjacent holes to enable the recovery of a complete sectio n for paleoceanographic studies. APC coring (not orientated) continued through Core 22H to 201.0 mbsf. The drill string was then recovered on ship with the bit arriving on the rig floor at $1325\,\mathrm{h}$ on  4 November.  

# Hole U1467E  

Our final operation at Site U1467 was to drill a dedicated logging hole. The ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1467A. The BH A was changed to a noncoring drill bit, and the drill string was lowered back to the seafloor. The top drive was picked up, and the drill string was spaced out using an offset seafloor depth of 498.4 mbs f taken from Hole U1467A. Drilling in Hole U1467E started at $1710\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 November 2015. This dedicated logging hole was drilled without coring to 714.0 mbsf in $25~\mathrm{h}$ . A mud sweep was circulated t o clear cuttings out of the hole, and two wireline runs were made t o release the bit at the bottom of the hole and reverse shift the MB R sleeve. Because of the stability seen in the previous holes at this sit e and while drilling the hole, we decided that a wiper trip was no t necessary and there was no need to displace the hole with heav y mud. The drill string was raised up the hole, and the end of the pip e was placed at 98.6 mbsf. We started rigging up for wireline loggin g at $2230~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 November. The triple combo was run into the hol e and reached the total depth at 714.0 mbsf. Caliper logs from this deployment indicated a hole diameter of 11–17 inches. The tripl e combo tool string was recovered and rigged down by $0600\mathrm{~h~}6\mathrm{~No-}$ vember. Taking advantage of daylight and following the marin e mammal protection protocol, the VSP experiment was conducte d next. The VSI tool was able to reach $\mathord{\sim}684$ mbsf or ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ off bottom, apparently because of fill in the borehole, and data were collected up from there. A very good signal was received at each VS P station, thus providing the necessary information for an accurat e time-depth conversion for comparison of seismic and downhol e (core and logging) data. The FMS-sonic tool string was deployed a t $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 November and reached 664 mbsf, where it stopped because of further fill at the bottom of the borehole. One of the fou r FMS pads was not recording accurate data because it was covere d with grease, which prevented good contact between the pad and th e borehole wall. After the FMS-sonic data were obtained, the too l string was recovered and rigged down by $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 November.  

The rig floor was secured from logging operations by $2000\ \mathrm{h},$ and by $2015~\mathrm{h}$ the upper guide horn was raised in preparation fo r pressure testing the new fiber optics–based subsea camera system. The camera was deployed down the drill string to the seafloor. Thi s system was installed prior to the last expedition (356); however, because all of the shallow-water operating depths during Expeditio n 356, the system has only been tested to ${\sim}90$ mbrf. We needed to tes t this system prior to the next expedition (360), which will requir e multiple deployments of the system for making bit changes in th e course of drilling a single $1500\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{RCB}$ hole into gabbro in ${\sim}700\,\mathrm{m}$ o f water. Testing the camera system at Site U1467 $\left(473\mathrm{~m}\right)$ indicate d that the system is $100\%$ operational. The camera was back on boar d and secured within $^{1\,}\mathrm{h},$ and the drill string was pulled clear of th e seafloor and recovered to the ship. After the seafloor positionin g beacon was recovered and the ship was secured for transit, we began the ${\sim}13.6\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1468 at $0024\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 November.  

Total recovery for Site U1467 was $31.49\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(98\%)$ in Hol e U1467A, $560.4\mathrm{~m~}(91\%)$ in Hole U1466B, $266.15\mathrm{~m~}(80\%)$ in Hol e U1467C, and 203.7 $(102\%)$ in Hole U1467D. Of the total 137 core s recovered, 86 were full APC cores, 21 were half-length APC cores, and 30 were XCB cores.  

# Site U1468  

# Transit to Site U1468  

The $13.6\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1467 to Site U1468 require d only $1.5\,\mathrm{h},$ and by $_{0232\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 7 November 2015, the ship arrived ove r the site coordinates and switched to the DP system. Soon after, th e rig crew began assembling the APC/XCB BHA. A positioning beacon was deployed, and the drill string was lowered to the seafloor.  

# Hole U1468A  

For Site U1468, we obtained an extension for the total EPSP approved penetration depth to 1000 mbsf to ensure the achievemen t of the site’s main scientific objective of coring thorough the Oligocene/Miocene boundary. Ultimately, coring with the XCB syste m terminated with Core 359-U1468A-111X at a total depth of 874. 7 mbsf when the biostratigraphers confirmed the Oligocene age of th e recovered core.  

Hole U1468A was spudded at $0830~\mathrm{h}$ on 7 November 2015, establishing a seafloor depth of $521.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Nonoriented APC corin g continued through Core 13H to 112.6 mbsf. Coring using th e HLAPC followed until APC refusal on Core 38F at 225.6 mbsf. Coring with the XCB coring system continued. Hole stability was maintained throughout by circulating 20 bbl high-viscosity mud sweep s every other core. This resulted in little or no fill on connections, normal drilling torque, and no overpull or drag with the drill string. After laying out the final core barrel, the bit was raised to 795.5 mbs f and the top drive was set back. The drill string was pulled out of th e hole, clearing the seafloor at $2215~\mathrm{h},$ , and the bit arrived on the ri g floor at $2400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 November.  

# Hole U1468B  

We offset the ship $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1468A and started assembling the tricone drill bit with a MBR to drill the dedicated loggin g hole. An extra stand of $8\%$ inch drill collars was added to the existing drilling BHA to place the bit at $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf or slightly deeper t o allow the end of the pipe to be below a potentially problematic san d package. We lowered the bit to the seafloor and started drillin g without coring in Hole U1468B at $0810~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 November 2015. During the course of drilling the dedicated logging hole, the drille r noted elevated drilling torque and hole cleaning problems at 131. 7 mbsf. At $1345\,\mathrm{h}$ , we spent nearly $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ conducting a wiper trip by raising the bit to 43.5 mbsf and then running it back to the bottom o f the hole. At $1530~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , drilling resumed and continued without incident until the bit reached a total depth of 874.7 mbsf at $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 2 November. We circulated a high-viscosity mud sweep, released th e bit in the bottom of the hole, and at $0115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 November the en d of the pipe had been positioned at 140.5 mbsf in preparation fo r wireline logging. We rigged up the triple combo tool string and ra n it into Hole U1468B at $0240~\mathrm{h}$ . The tool string reached ${\sim}835$ mbsf, where it tagged bottom, indicating ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of infill in the hole.  A short pass logged from the bottom of the hole up to ${\sim}735$ mbs f showed reasonable hole diameter. The tool string was run back t o total depth, and the main pass started at 835 mbsf, recordin g gamma radiation, density, porosity, electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility. Borehole diameter varied smoothly, rangin g from ${\sim}17$ to 12 inches, until a narrow section ( $(\AA^{<}6\$ inches) was encountered at ${\sim}465$ mbsf. Significant overpull was required to continue pulling the tool string up to ${\sim}290$ mbsf, suggesting th e borehole had deteriorated in this interval. Above ${\sim}290~\mathrm{mbsf},$ hol e diameter increased, and the main pass continued up to the base o f the drill pipe at 140 mbsf. Logging data were recorded continuall y throughout the main pass with the triple combo tool string, but further logging operations could not be carried out because of the stat e of the borehole. The tool string was returned to the rig floor an d rigged down, and logging operations in Hole U1468B were completed by $0915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 November.  

After rigging down from wireline logging, the pipe was pulle d out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0935\,\mathrm{h}$ . Hole U1468B ende d when the bit arrived back on the rig floor at $1125\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Site U1469  

# Transit to Site U1469  

Site U1469 was only a $4\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1468, so the D P system was used to move the ship to the new coordinates. Durin g the transit, the drill string was recovered and a new RCB BHA wa s assembled and lowered to the seafloor.  

# Hole U1469A  

We tagged the seafloor with the drill bit and established a seafloor depth of 427 mbsl. RCB coring in Hole U1469A started at 182 5 h on 13 November 2015. Coring was extremely challenging becaus e of the loosely cemented carbonate sand formation. High torque an d overpull occurred when pulling the bit off the bottom of the hole. However, we were able to penetrate to 122.1 mbsf before making  a wiper trip up. At $0245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November, with the bit back on bottom again, RCB coring continued, but hole conditions continued t o be problematic. We suspected that drilling had encountered a zon e of high permeability within the buried reefal carbonate rocks, causing a loss of circulation uphole that was required to clean the drille d cuttings off the hole. At $0630\,\mathrm{~h},$ we decided to abandon Hol e  

U1469A and try a new hole after offsetting the ship $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ west. Th e drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0810\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November, ending Hole U1469A.  

# Hole U1469B  

Drilling in Hole U1469B started at $0850\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November 201 5 after using the drill bit to tag the seafloor (427 mbsl). Hole U1469 B was drilled without coring to 122 mbsf without incident, and it appeared that this hole would be considerably better than the previou s hole. This optimism was short lived, as the same hole cleaning problems occurred again after cutting just three RCB cores to 151. 4 mbsf. Convinced that the hole could not be deepened any furthe r because of lost circulation, Hole U1469B was also abandoned. Th e drill string was retrieved back on board, the positioning beacon wa s picked up, the thrusters were raised, and we started the transit t o the next site (U1470) at $2045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November.  

# Site U1470  

# Transit to Site U1470 and Hole U1470A  

After a $17.8\,\mathrm{\nm}$ transit from Site U1469, we arrived at Sit e U1470 at $2306~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November 2015. We lowered the thruster s and hydrophones and switched to DP mode. We assembled a n APC/XCB BHA and lowered it to the seafloor. After establishing  a PDR depth of $367.0~\mathrm{mbrf},$ , the first APC core barrel was deployed, recovering just a water core. The bit was lowered to $403.5\;\mathrm{mbrf},$ , an d a second APC core barrel was deployed, recovering $2.17~\mathrm{m}$ of cor e and establishing a seafloor depth of 410.8 mbrf $(400.3~\mathrm{mbsl})$ ). AP C coring continued through Core 17H to 148.4 mbsf before a lithologic change in the formation to hard reef material led us to switc h to the XCB coring system. Cores 18X and 19X had very poor recovery (0.17 and $_0\;\mathrm{m}$ , respectively). The material was hard but very friable, and rock pieces would break and jam in the core catcher. Th e HLAPC system was deployed for Cores 20F and 21F, which recovered 1.76 and $1.90\:\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , respectively. The improved recovery was welcome, but the time required to deepen the hole was a concern. W e therefore attempted another XCB core, this time using an “extended” XCB cutting shoe that placed the cutting structure eve n further ahead of the main drill bit. Recovery with the extended XC B shoe was not better, and because of the higher risk associated wit h the longer extension of the XCB shoe, it was not run again. Corin g was terminated after Core 24X at 190.0 mbsf in favor of starting  a new hole using the RCB system. The drill string was pulled clear o f the seafloor at $1910\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the bit arrived on the rig floor at $2055~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 November, ending Hole U1470A.  

# Hole U1470B  

By $2400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 November 2015, we finished making up an RC B BHA and spacing out the core barrels in preparation for lowerin g the drill string back to the seafloor. The ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west o f Hole U1470A, and Hole U1470B was started at $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on $16\;\mathrm{No}\mathrm{-}$ vember. An offset seafloor depth of 410.8 mbsl was utilized from adjacent Hole U1470A. Drilling proceeded to 150.0 mbsf before th e formation stiffened up enough to warrant deploying a RCB cente r bit. Drilling continued to 168.9 mbsf, and at $0930~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 November, RCB coring was initiated. Only a single core was cut to 178. 6 mbsf before high torque and overpull forced the need for a wipe r trip. The drill string was pulled back to 90.2 mbsf, placing the top o f the tapered drill collar above seafloor before drilling parameters returned to normal. The hole was washed/reamed to total depth, an d at $1345~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 November, RCB coring resumed. Cores 3R–8R t o 227.1 mbsf were cut before high torque and overpull indicated cuttings again were not being properly flushed from the hole, perhap s aggravated by zones of lost circulation within the cavernous reefal limestone. Another $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ wiper trip was made, and at $2030~\mathrm{h},$ , RC B coring restarted. Coring continued through Core 19R to 343.7 mbsf, and coring was terminated shortly after $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ because of need t o wireline log the hole. Downhole logging was considered to be o f greater importance than deepening a challenging hole. The shiftin g tool was run in the hole; however, there were problems shifting th e MBR sleeve to release the bit. Repeatedly jarring on the sleeve wit h the wireline jars eventually knocked the sleeve loose, and the bit wa s released at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ . The sleeve was reverse shifted without incident, and the drill string was pulled to logging depth at 100.2 mbsf.  

Because of the uncertainty about hole conditions and stability,  a single logging run was planned with a tool string designed to measure the highest priority data (gamma ray, sonic velocity, electrical resistivity, and borehole diameter). Rig-up for wireline logging began at $0730~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November. We ran this sonic-resistivity tool string into the hole without installing the nuclear source, but unfortunately, resistance was encountered almost immediately as th e tools reached $10\;\mathrm{m}$ below the end of the pipe and we were not abl e to securely pass a collapsing section of the borehole just $52\;\mathrm{m}$ belo w the end of the pipe at $100.2\ \mathrm{mbsf}.$ The winch operator eventuall y pulled the tool string back into the pipe and up to the rig floor, where it was rigged down, and logging operations in Hole U1470 B were concluded by $1215\ \mathrm{h}$ on 17 November. The drill string wa s pulled clear of the seafloor at $1230\,\mathrm{h},$ and the drill string was recovered back onboard the ship with the end of the pipe clearing the ri g floor rotary table at $1355\,\mathrm{h}$ . The positioning beacon was recovere d on deck at $1410~\mathrm{h}$ . Thrusters were pulled, and the rig was secure d for transit to the next site.  

# Site U1471  

# Transit to Site U1471  

At $1448~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November 2015, we started the transit to Sit e U1471. We covered the short $9.1\ \mathrm{nmi}$ distance in $^{1\,\mathrm{h}_{:}}$ , arriving ove r the site coordinates at $1548\,\mathrm{h}$ . Thrusters were lowered, and headin g control was switched over to DP at $1636\,\mathrm{h}$ . This process took a littl e longer than usual because the captain had to turn the ship aroun d and change heading prior to getting back on the location coordinates. The APC/XCB BHA was built, and at $1707\,\mathrm{h}$ we deployed th e same positioning beacon recovered from Site U1470. We lowere d the drill string to the seafloor, picked up the top drive, and space d out the bit at 414.6 mbsl.  

# Hole U1471A  

We started Hole U1471A at $2050~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November 2015 b y cutting Core 1H and recovering $4.62\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, thus establishing a seafloor depth of 419.5 mbsl. Uninterrupted oriented AP C coring continued through Core 32H to $295.1\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , where high overpull and an incomplete stroke with the APC system led us to switc h to the HLAPC coring system. We continued to core with th e HLAPC system through Core 37F to 318.6 mbsf. All HLAPC core s were incomplete strokes, and penetration continually decreased. The high content of sand in the formation caused the flapper valv e in the core barrel to lock up, leading to occasional misfires of th e APC and HLAPC coring systems. We therefore switched to XC B coring and continued through Core 44X to 384.0 mbsf, but becaus e of poor recovery, we attempted another HLAPC core. Core 45F recovered only $0.51\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , indicating the formation had become mor e lithified and therefore too hard for piston coring. In addition, th e driller noticed that the wash pipe assembly on top of the top driv e was seriously leaking, leading to an impromptu wiper trip to condition the hole and position the tapered drill collar above the seafloor. The standpipe assembly was replaced, and the bit was washed bac k to bottom. At $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 November, we resumed XCB coring an d continued through Core 59X to 515.1 mbsf. Recovery was extremel y poor, averaging just $9\%$ $(2\%{-}27\%)$ . Only 2 of 14 cores were recovered with more than $^{1\textrm{m}}$ of sediment. Cores 60F and 61F wer e HLAPC cores in an attempt to improve recovery. These cores recovered 1.91 and $1.16\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , respectively. It was deemed too risky t o drill out the rat hole with the pipe open ended and no core barrel i n place. Core 63F was the final HLAPC core attempted, and it recovered $1.74\;\mathrm{m}$ . Continuous XCB coring began with Core 64X at 531. 5 mbsf and continued through Core 82X to 685.1 mbsf. XCB corin g the interbedded hard/soft material was difficult, and recovery wa s marginal because the lithified limestone jammed in the XCB cuttin g shoe and the softer material washed away. Although hole condition s remained good throughout and core recovery improved significantly over the last $100\,\mathrm{m}$ interval (averaging $44.5\%$ and ranging between $19\%$ and $88\%$ ), we decided to stop coring before reaching ou r depth and age objectives because of the slow rate of penetration $_{<8}$ $\mathrm{m/h})$ ) and in favor of reaching our target depth in an RCB hole to b e drilled after completing two more APC holes. Therefore, at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 November, we stopped coring Hole U1471A and pulled th e drill string back, clearing the seafloor.  

# Holes U1471B and U1471C  

After offsetting the ship $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ west, we started coring Hol e U1471B at $0440\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 November 2015. The mudline core recovered $6.62\;\mathrm{m},$ but the core liner was shattered and much of the material was lost. Therefore, we started Hole U1471C another $20\;\mathrm{m}$ wes t at $0555~\mathrm{h}$ . Core 1H recovered $7.85\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and established a seafloo r depth of 419.3 mbsl. APC coring continued through Core 19H to  a total depth of $178.8\ \mathrm{mbsf}$ . Successful temperature measurement s were made using the APCT-3 at 26.8, 45.8, 64.8, 83.8, and 169. 3 mbsf and were $11.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , $11.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , $12^{\circ}C$ , $12.2^{\circ}C$ , and $13.5^{\circ}C$ , respectively. The downhole temperature trend defined a very low temperature gradient of $15.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . In addition, as a result of on e APCT-3 cutting shoe arriving late to the rig floor, the shoe was inadvertently installed without a core catcher, resulting in Core 5 H $36.3{-}45.8\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ being recovered empty. The drill string was pulle d clear of the seafloor at $2000\;\mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1471C.  

# Hole U1471D  

The ship was moved another $20\ \mathrm{m}$ west, and we initiated Hol e U1471D at $2105~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 November 2015. For this hole, the bit wa s advanced to 1 mbsf before taking the first core to optimally positio n the core breaks for a reliable stratigraphic correlation. Cores 2H–7 H were recovered to 59.0 mbsf. The last two cores were not oriented.  

# Testing of the Motion Decoupled Hydraulic Delivery System  

After  completing  coring  operations  in  Hole  U1471D,  th e planned test of the MDHDS took place with mixed results. Handling of the tool at the rig floor was vastly improved, reducing deployment time from the $1.5~\mathrm{h}$ required during the first test at Sit e U1467 to $30\;\mathrm{min}$ . The ERS was opened and closed numerous time s and worked flawlessly each time. The SET2 functioned as designe d and successfully recorded data although it was not inserted into th e formation because the MDHDS became stuck in the LFV. A roun d trip of the drill string was completed, and the bit cleared the ri g floor at $0545\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 November 2015, ending Hole U1471D.  

The MDHDS tool was removed without incident at the rig floor , and the LFV was discovered packed with sand. It appeared that entrained sand was restricting removal of the MDHDS tool downhol e and was flushed from the system during the pipe trip, which als o explained several unusual piston core sequences where the pressur e profile was atypical.  

# Hole U1471E  

After making up a new RCB coring bit with a MBR and a fourstand BHA, the drill string was once again lowered to the seafloor. The ship was offset another $20\,\mathrm{m}$ west, and at $1110\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 November 2015, we started drilling Hole U1471E. Our initial goal was t o drill this hole to ${\sim}610$ mbsf and then continuously RCB core to ${\sim}950$ mbsf. Once coring operations were completed, downhole loggin g would follow with the three suites of wireline tools: the tripl e combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI tool strings. By midnight on Sunday, 2 2 November, Hole U1471E was drilled to $421.4~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . Drilling ahea d continued to 596.3 mbsf. Several deployments of the RCB bit deplugger were required to clear debris from the float valve flapper, resulting in drill string backflow. Drilling was halted because of th e slow penetration rate and a concern for possible damage to the RC B center bit in the hard formation. The center bit was recovered vi a wireline, and an RCB core barrel was deployed. At $1045\,\mathrm{h}$ on $23\,\mathrm{No}\cdot$ - vember, RCB coring was initiated. Coring continued through Cor e 44R to 1003.7 mbsf. The original EPSP-approved depth was 95 0 mbsf, but because of concerns about the reliability of the velocit y depth model used, we requested to deepen the hole and received  a depth extension approval from the EPSP to 1050 mbsf to ensur e penetration to the target seismic reflector. This also provided  a small amount of rat hole below the target depth, which allowed fo r logging data across the target facies. Additional depth would als o accommodate any cuttings that might settle out of the hole annulu s or cave-in during subsequent logging runs. Core recovery was adequate for most of the hole but continually improved with depth. Overall recovery for the hole was $42\%$ ; however, this increased to a n average of $57\%$ over the last $100~\mathrm{m}$ $(37\%{-}89\%)$ . Toward the end o f the cored interval, multiple deployments of the bit deplugger wer e made because of excessive backflow during drill string connections. Although these were unsuccessful, the coring process was not impacted. This suggested that the spring in the float valve was eithe r broken or weakened and no longer able to fully seal the end of th e pipe. There were no indications of hole stability issues through th e course of drilling/coring in the hole. There was no filling identifie d on bottom between connections, no elevated drilling torque noted, and no wiper trips required during the course of the drilling/corin g effort. As a result, the hole was not displaced with heavy mud an d there was no prelogging wiper trip conducted in preparation fo r wireline logging.  

# Downhole logging  

The RCB bit was released at the bottom of the hole, and the pip e was pulled up to a logging depth of 99.7 mbsf. The triple combo tool string was rigged up and deployed in the hole at $0545~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 November 2015. A downlog was completed to 1003.7 mbsf (the total drilled depth), a short repeat pass was logged, and the main pass o f the tool string was recorded from the bottom of the hole up past th e seafloor. Borehole diameter in the upper section of the hole was a t the maximum reach of the caliper arm ( $\left[\sim\!17\right.$ inches), but much o f the lower section was in gauge. The VSI tool string was rigged u p next and run into the hole at $1245\,\mathrm{h}$ for a VSP experiment. The tool string reached an unpassable obstruction at ${\sim}615\$ mbsf, where th e borehole had been observed to be very narrow during the tripl e combo run. Therefore, only shallow VSP stations could be reached; clear waveforms were recorded at three depth stations between 23 3 and 606 mbsf. The VSI tool string was run one more time into th e hole to attempt one deeper station, but on this second attempt, a n obstruction was encountered at 454 mbsf, another narrow sectio n observed during the triple combo run. A third logging run wa s made with a sonic tool string, measuring gamma ray and sonic velocity, with the aim of recording velocity data in the available ope n hole interval. The FMS tool that is usually combined with the soni c tool has a maximum caliper reach of ${\sim}15$ inches and would not hav e made contact with the borehole walls in sections where the diameter exceeded 17 inches; thus, it was not included in the third loggin g tool string. The sonic tool string was run into the hole at $1620\,\mathrm{h}$ , an d a downlog was recorded down to 454 mbsf, the same location wher e an obstruction blocked passage of the VSI tool string. After severa l unsuccessful attempts to pass the blocked section, the sonic too l string was pulled up from 454 mbsf to record a main pass throug h the shallow section of open hole up to the seafloor. The sonic too l string was rigged down, and logging operations for Hole U1471 E and Expedition 359 were completed by $1940\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill string wa s pulled on board and the seafloor-positioning beacon was recovere d as the ship began to move using the DP system to the next sit e (U1472) at $2120\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 November.  

# Site U1472  

# Hole U1472A  

With limited time available because we needed to depart fo r Malé no later than $0200~\mathrm{h}$ on Saturday 28 November 2015, we decided to move to Site U1472 and core one final APC hole as deep a s possible with the remaining expedition time. Site U1472 was originally a primary drill site for the expedition, but it was downgrade d to alternate status as a result of a higher scientific priority to core a t Site U1471.  

An APC/XCB BHA was made up as the ship moved $4.1~\mathrm{nmi}$ i n DP mode to Site U1472. The drill string was run to the seafloor, an d Hole U1472A was started at $0415~\mathrm{h}$ . We cut and recovered Core s 1H–34F from 0 to $251.9~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , recovering $233.75\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(93\%)$ . None of the cores were oriented. The last core of Expedition 35 9 arrived on deck at $2015\,\mathrm{h},$ and the final drill string trip of the expedition began. All drilling equipment was secured. The seafloor-positioning beacon was released, but it did not come to the surface. Thrusters were pulled, and at $0212\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 November we began th e transit to Malé.  

# Transit to Malé  

The transit ended at $0718\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 November 2015, and at 072 0 h the pilot came on board. The anchor was ultimately dropped i n the Malé anchorage at $0806\,\mathrm{h}$ . As part of the Republic of Maldive s drilling clearance, the ship was required to check in at Malé. Tw o observers were discharged, and the agent took everyone’s passport s ashore again to clear out of Maldivian waters. In addition, Maldivian Minister of Fisheries and Agriculture came onboard for a meeting with the Co-Chief Scientists, who gave him a briefing on th e expedition results. Passports were returned, and the pilot cam e aboard at $1430\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . At $1448\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 28 November, the anchor wa s weighed, and at $1512\,\mathrm{h}$ , the pilot departed the ship, marking the beginning of the sea transit to Colombo, Sri Lanka.  

# Transit to Colombo  

The transit to Colombo was quick and uneventful. Shipboar d clocks were advanced $30\ \mathrm{min}$ at $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 November 2015. Although the pilot was scheduled for $0700\;\mathrm{h}$ , it was not until $1013~\mathrm{h}$ that the pilot actually boarded the ship. The first line went ashore a t the Unity Container Terminal berth at Colombo (Sri Lanka) at 110 0 h on 30 November, officially ending Expedition 359.

Figure F3. Sketch of the Maldives carbonate platform stratigraphy. The volcanic basement is overlain by Eocene and Oligocene neritic carbonates. During th e Oligocene, the platform areas shrank and two north-south–trending carbonate banks developed. During the Miocene, shallow-water carbonate banks partl y drowned, whereas other platform areas grew further on. Contemporaneously, the carbonate platform was affected by an intensification of currents, as registered by the onset of widespread drift sedimentation in the Inner Sea of the Maldives. The research strategy for Expedition 359 was to drill two transects o f sites going from the inner part of the drowned platforms toward the Inner Sea, where the drifts accumulated in more current-protected settings.
