# Abstract  

Geologic processes at convergent plate margins control geochemical cycling, seismicity, and deep biosphere activity in subduction zones and suprasubduction zone lithosphere. Internationa l Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 366 was designed t o address the nature of these processes in the shallow to intermediat e depth of the Mariana subduction channel. Although no technolog y is available to permit direct sampling of the subduction channel o f an intraoceanic convergent margin at depths up to $18\,\mathrm{km}$ , the Mariana forearc region (between the trench and the active volcanic arc ) provides a means to access this zone.  

Active conduits, resulting from fractures in the forearc, ar e prompted by along- and across-strike extension that allows slab-derived fluids and materials to ascend to the seafloor along associate d faults, resulting in the formation of serpentinite mud volcanoes. Serpentinite mud volcanoes of the Mariana forearc are the larges t mud volcanoes on Earth. Their positions adjacent to or atop faul t scarps on the forearc are likely related to the regional extension an d vertical tectonic deformation in the forearc. Serpentinite mudflow s at these volcanoes include serpentinized forearc mantle clasts, crustal and subducted Pacific plate materials, a matrix of serpentinite muds, and deep-sourced formation fluid. Mud volcanis m on the Mariana forearc occurs within $100~\mathrm{km}$ of the trench, representing a range of depths and temperatures to the downgoing plat e and the subduction channel. These processes have likely been activ e for tens of millions of years at this site and for billions of years o n Earth.  

At least 10 active serpentinite mud volcanoes have been locate d in the Mariana forearc. Two of these mud volcanoes are Conical an d South Chamorro Seamounts, which are the furthest from the Mariana Trench at 86 and $78~\mathrm{km}$ , respectively. Both seamounts wer e cored during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 125 and 195, respectively. Data from these two seamounts represent deeper, warmer examples of the continuum of slab-derived materials as th e Pacific plate subducts, providing a snapshot of how slab subductio n affects fluid release, the composition of ascending fluids, mantle hydration, and the metamorphic paragenesis of subducted oceani c lithosphere. Data from the study of these two mud volcanoes constrain the pressure, temperature, and composition of fluids and materials within the subduction channel at depths of about 18 to 1 9 km. Understanding such processes is necessary for elucidating factors that control seismicity in convergent margins, tectonic an d magma genesis processes in the forearc and volcanic arc, fluid an d material fluxes, and the nature and variability of environmenta l conditions that impact subseafloor microbial communities.  

Expedition 366 centered on data collection from cores recovered from three serpentinite mud volcanoes that define a continuum of subduction-channel processes defined by the two previousl y cored serpentinite mud volcanoes and the trench. Three serpentinite mud volcanoes (Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro) were chosen at distances 55 to $72~\mathrm{km}$ from the Mariana Trench. Cores were recovered from active sites of eruption on their summi t regions and on the flanks where ancient flows are overlain by mor e recent ones. Recovered materials show the effects of dynamic processes that are active at these sites, bringing a range of materials t o the seafloor, including materials from the lithosphere of the Pacifi c plate and from subducted seamounts (including corals). Most of th e recovered material consists of serpentinite mud containing lithi c clasts, which are derived from the underlying forearc crust an d mantle and the subducting Pacific plate. Cores from each of th e three seamounts drilled during Expedition 366, as well as thos e from Legs 125 and 195, include material from the underlying Pacifi c plate. A thin cover of pelagic sediment was recovered at many Expedition 366 sites, and at Site U1498 we cored through serpentinit e flows to the underlying pelagic sediment and volcanic ash deposits. Recovered serpentinites are largely uniform in major element composition, with serpentinized ultramafic rocks and serpentinite mud s spanning a limited range in $\mathrm{{SiO}_{2},}$ , MgO, and $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ compositions. However, variation in trace element composition reflects pore flui d composition, which differs as a function of the temperature an d pressure of the underlying subduction channel. Dissolved gases $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ $\mathrm{CH}_{4},$ and ${\cal C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}$ are highest at the site furthest from the trench, which also has the most active fluid discharge of the Expedition 36 6 serpentinite mud volcanoes. These dissolved gases and their activ e discharge from depth likely support active microbial communities, which were the focus of in-depth subsampling and preservation fo r shore-based analytical and culturing procedures. The effects o f fluid discharge were also registered in the porosity and GRA densit y data indicated by higher than expected values at some of the summit sites. These higher values are consistent with overpressured fluids that minimize compaction of serpentinite mud deposits. I n contrast, flank sites have significantly greater decreases in porosit y with depth, suggesting that processes in addition to compaction ar e required to achieve the observed data. Thermal measurements reveal higher heat flow values on the flanks $({\sim}31\,\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ than on th e summits $({\sim}17~\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ of the seamounts. The new 2G Enterprise s superconducting rock magnetometer (liquid helium free) revealed relatively high values of both magnetization and bulk magnetic susceptibility of discrete samples related to ultramafic rocks, particularly in dunite. Magnetite, a product of serpentinization, an d authigenic carbonates were observed in the mudflow matrix materials.  

In addition to coring operations, Expedition 366 focused on th e deployment and remediation of borehole casings for future observatories and set the framework for in situ experimentation. Borehole work commenced at South Chamorro Seamount, where th e original-style CORK was partially removed. Work then continued a t each of the three summit sites following coring operations. Case d boreholes with at least three joints of screened casing were deployed, and a plug of cement was placed at the bottom of each hole. Water samples were collected from two of the three boreholes, revealing significant inputs of formation fluids. This suggests tha t each of the boreholes tapped a hydrologic zone, making these boreholes suitable for experimentation with the future deployment of  a CORK-lite.  

An active education and outreach program connected wit h many classrooms on shore and with the general public through social media.  

# Background  

Geologic processes at convergent plate margins affect geochemical cycling and fluxes, seismicity and natural hazards, crustal an d mantle evolution and mixing, and biosphere activity and populatio n dynamics in subduction zones. To constrain these processes, on e needs to quantify the inputs and outputs. Quantifying inputs into  a convergent plate margin is accomplished by sampling the downgoing plate prior to subduction, providing a geochemical, physical, and mechanical reference. The study of the output in terms o f magma and volatiles in volcanic arcs and in backarc basin setting s constrains processes that occur deep within the subduction zone, but such studies of subduction systems are incomplete, lacking a n understanding of processes that occur between the time the subducting plate enters the trench and the time it reaches the zone o f magma genesis beneath the arc. The Mariana convergent syste m provides a window into this zone.  

The Mariana convergent system is a nonaccretionary-type convergent plate margin (Uyeda and Kanamori, 1979). Here, fluids an d materials rise from the subducted Pacific plate within long-live d permeable pathways through the overlying Philippine plate. Suc h pathways are maintained with across- and along-strike extensio n (Fryer and Salisbury, 2006). Vertical tectonic deformation is anothe r potential process that shapes fault patterns in the forearc. Vertica l deformation occurs when Cretaceous Pacific plate guyots are subducted. In contrast, the zone between the trench and the region o f arc magmagenesis is not accessible in accretionary forearcs. Here, deep-sourced fluids ascend through imbricate fault systems an d splays in an accretionary prism. Transit of deep-sourced fluid s through the prism result in a reaction with a compositionally heterogeneous package of accreted sediments, obfuscating the composition of the deep-sourced fluid. Thus, the Mariana forearc region i s unique in the world today, in that it provides direct access to deepsourced fluids and material from the subduction channel and suprasubduction zone via active serpentinite mud volcanism. Furthermore, ascending deep-sourced fluids, with elevated $\mathsf{p H},$ methane, and hydrogen concentrations relative to seawater, support subsurface microbial communities. Such fluids vent at summit seeps, sometimes  supporting  megafaunal  communities  (Fryer,  2011; Ohara et al., 2010).  

Therefore, to study processes in the Mariana forearc we chos e four active serpentinite mud volcanoes (Yinazao, Fantangisña, Asù t Tesoro, and South Chamorro) for investigation during Expeditio n 366 (Figure F1; Table T1). Operations included coring at summi t and flank sites on Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts, deploying a screened casing for future borehole experiments on the summits of each, and revitalizing the borehol e observatory (CORK) at South Chamorro Seamount (Ocean Drillin g Program [ODP] Site 1200).  

Yinazao Seamount (informally called Blue Moon Seamount) lie s on the eastern edge of a forearc graben about $55\,\mathrm{km}$ from the Mariana Trench axis (Figure F1; Table T1). Of the three mud volcanoe s cored during the expedition, Yinazao Seamount is the closest to th e trench, and the subducting slab lies approximately $13\;\mathrm{km}$ below it s summit (Oakley et al., 2007, 2008). Like the many other serpentinit e mud volcanoes that populate the southern half of the Marian a forearc, Yinazao Seamount is situated along a zone of weakness i n the overriding plate’s lithosphere. The fault trend that controlled th e growth of the edifice has a northeast–southwest trend and intersects a northwest–southeast trend immediately south.  

A primary feature of the summit of Yinazao Seamount is a faul t scarp with a maximum throw of about $80\,\mathrm{m}$ that is colinear with th e regional fault trend. The eastern half of the summit is shallower, an d the overall morphology of the summit suggests a right-lateral motion on a fault with dip-slip to the northwest. The offset on the faul t is apparently a combination of footwall uplift (eastern block) an d downdrop of the hanging wall to the northwest (western block). This deformation may have directed the egress of rising fluids to th e southwest edge of the summit area where a spring was located. Systematic variation in pore water composition from sediment pisto n cores collected from the research vessel (R/V) Thomas G. Thompson in 2003 confirmed the presence of fluid discharge at a rate of u p to ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Hulme et al., 2010). Discharge at rates of meters pe r year was identified from push cores collected in 2003 by the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) Jason $I I$ within a $50~\mathrm{m}$ range of th e piston core with the greatest fluid upwelling rate.  

Coring on the flanks of Yinazao Seamount, as on those of th e other two target mud volcanoes, was designed to recover some o f the oldest serpentinite mudflow materials. We anticipated recovering matrix muds and rock clasts that would provide information regarding the lithology of these early erupted materials. Serpentinize d peridotite clasts and other lithologies might reveal different decollement pressure, temperature, and compositional conditions fro m those that would be expected from the shallower (younger) period s as the shape of the forearc evolves, currently trending to the east. I t was also expected that pore fluids would have interacted with seawater after lengthy exposure at the base of the seamount. Such interactions  may  affect  microbial  communities  present  in  th e subseafloor environment. Each of the five flank sites on these thre e seamounts is located on a multichannel seismic line that intersecte d either a region of the flank that was undisturbed by mass-wasting o r that crossed the distal edge of a mudflow of particular interest.  

Fantangisña Seamount (informally known as Celestial Seamount) is located about $62~\mathrm{km}$ from the trench and about $14~\mathrm{km}$ above the subducting Pacific plate (Figure F1; Table T1). This seamount lies on the northern edge of a prominent uplifted forear c block that trends northwest and its intersection with a northeasttrending lineament. The main feature of the summit is a slump o n the northern flank. Several stages of slumps exist, based on neste d headwalls with sharply defined features at 2000 and $1840\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth, for example.  

No active seeps or chimneys were observed during the one RO V Jason $I I$ dive (J2-038) on Fantangisña Seamount in 2003. This div e started within the summit depression at the headwall of the $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ slump and headed up the southeastern slope to the summit rim. The only indication of active serpentinite processes is based on on e piston core from the center of the summit depression. This core recovered $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ of serpentinite material; however, at the base of th e core, concentrations of $\mathrm{Mg}$ and alkalinity (49.6 and $0.89\;\mathrm{mmol/kg},$ respectively) in pore fluids were lower than bottom seawater value s (53 and $2.4\,\mathrm{\mmol/kg},$ , respectively). These data indicate a deepsourced input close to the seafloor, consistent with slow, centimeters per year or less discharge of pore waters in excess of the sediment matrix.  

Asùt Tesoru Seamount (informally called Big Blue Seamount) i s a serpentinite mud volcano that lies about $72\;\mathrm{km}$ from the trenc h axis with the subducting slab approximately $18~\mathrm{km}$ below its summit (Oakley et al., 2007, 2008) (Figure F1, Table T1). Asùt Tesor u Seamount is the farthest from the trench of the three seamount s targeted for coring. It is also the largest one on the Mariana forearc, with a diameter of ${\sim}50~\mathrm{km}$ and over $2~\mathrm{km}$ high. The major faul t trend that controlled the growth of the edifice has a north-northeas t trend and is crosscut by a fault trending north-northwest. Asùt Tesoru Seamount may have been active since the Eocene, based o n analysis of two serpentine-bearing ( $\mathrm{\sim}50\%$ serpentine) sediment intervals immediately above Eocene basement recovered during Dee p Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 60 at Site 459 (Despraires, 1981).  

The summit region of Asùt Tesoru Seamount has a prominen t mound at the intersection of the two fault trends. The summi t mound is roughly circular and about $2~\mathrm{km}$ in diameter and $300\mathrm{~m~}$ high. At its apex, it has three smaller circular mounds. One is centered at the middle of the $2\;\mathrm{km}$ wide mound and is about $150\;\mathrm{m}$ i n diameter and $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ high. The two other mounds are about $75~\mathrm{m}$ i n diameter and $20\textrm{m}$ high. The two smaller mounds lie side by sid e west of the larger mound and are both overlapped by it. An RO V transect of the larger mound was conducted in 2003 with the Jaso n II (J2-034 and J2-036) from west to east and explored farther to th e northeast distant from the topographical high. The highest rate o f fluid discharge occurred in the middle of the surveyed mound o n the summit of the seamount.  

South Chamorro Seamount is located about $78\ \mathrm{km}$ from th e trench, with the subducting slab approximately $19~\mathrm{km}$ below it s summit; it was drilled during ODP Leg 195 (Figure F1; Table T1). This seamount is primarily composed of unconsolidated flows o f serpentine mud with clasts consisting dominantly of serpentinize d mantle peridotite but also includes blueschist fragments (Shipboar d Scientific Party, 2002). The summit shows active fluid seepage o f slab-derived fluids with megafaunal assemblages that include mussels, gastropods, worm tubes, and galatheid crabs (Fryer and Mottl, 1997). Subsurface microbes include archaea (Mottl et al., 2003; Curtis et al., 2013) and Bacteria (Takai et al., 2005). Even with evidenc e for fluid flow from a deep source (Hulme et al., 2010), temperature s measured in the uppermost $1\,\mathrm{m}$ at Site 1200 are between $2^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}C$ , which is just above the bottom water temperature of $1.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

During Leg 195, a borehole observatory (CORK) was deployed. This original-style CORK included a $202.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long casing with  a screened section from about 148.8 to 202.3 meters below seafloo r (mbsf). This screened section provides a conduit for formation fluids at depth to exchange with fluids within the borehole. When th e borehole is open at the seafloor, fluids naturally discharge (Wheat e t al., 2008). However, the lack of latches to maintain formation pressure and the small diameter imposed by the original-style COR K limit the usefulness of this installation. The plan for Expedition 36 6 was to remove the CORK body, leaving the hole open for a futur e ROV deployment of a CORK-lite (Wheat et al., 2012).  

# Objectives  

The four primary scientific goals outlined in the Expedition 36 6 Scientific Prospectus were to assess (1) mass transport processes i n the Mariana forearc region, (2) spatial variability of slab-related fluids, (3) metamorphic and tectonic history and physical properties o f the subduction zone, and (4) biological activity associated wit h deep-derived subduction zone material. To meet or address thes e goals, the specific objectives were to gain better insight into mas s transport (fluids and solid materials) in the Mariana forearc regio n and its relationship to subduction zone tectonics and subseafloo r biological processes. The sites chosen for drilling on the three targe t serpentinite mud volcanoes span different distances (thus depth t o slab) from the Mariana Trench. Results from Expedition 366 wil l therefore complement previous drilling completed during OD P Legs 125 and 195. In addition, the long-term goal of the expeditio n was to establish borehole observatory sites at the summits of th e three seamounts targeted for coring.  

To meet the specific objectives for coring during Expeditio n 366, the operational plan was to (1) intersect mudflows of variabl e composition that mantled the flank of each edifice and, at the tw o that were known to be active, recover conduit muds from areas nea r active springs; (2) potentially date discrete mudflows paleontologically, should there be sediment layers between them; (3) determin e variability in the composition of rock clasts in the mudflows; (4) investigate potential systematic variability in degree of serpentinization (possibly lower degrees at initiation of mud volcanism vi a conduit “throat clearing” or greater on the flanks where rock clast s may have reacted more fully with enclosing serpentinite muds an d fluids); (5) examine transport conditions of muds and pore fluids; (6) provide a measure for the scale of potential flow characteristic s (e.g., diffuse versus channelized); (7) determine the composition o f fluid from depth; and (8) collect samples for the study of microbial/viral community interactions at depth and if possible near th e underlying forearc sediment surface under a range of conditions.  

The primary objective for establishing borehole observatorie s was to deploy three screened and cased boreholes that bisect hydrologic zones (aquifers), one at each of the three summit sites o n Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts. These boreholes, each sealed with cement at their base, would then serve as th e foundation for a return mission with an ROV to emplace CORKlites within the cased holes. CORK-lites would enable downhol e monitoring, experimental capabilities, and collection of pristin e deep-source fluids within a gas-tight sampling system for dissolve d gas analyses. Given the original-style CORK at South Chamorr o Seamount, the objective was to remove the CORK body so the borehole could be used for a range of experiment types and instrumen t sizes.  

# Coring results  

Three serpentinite mud volcanoes were cored during Expedition 366 (Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts). Cored materials were recovered from each of the summit and flan k sites using a variety of coring technologies designed for maximu m recovery, penetrating hard materials, or achieving a desired dept h (Table T2). Thus, combined with data from Legs 125 and 195, th e new data from Expedition 366 provide a continuum from relativel y cool $(\sim\!80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and shallow $\langle{\sim}13\ \mathrm{km}\rangle$ conditions at depth within th e subduction channel closer to the trench to hot $(\mathrm{\sim}350^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and dee p $\left({\sim}19\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ conditions further from the trench (Table T1).  

Materials recovered during drilling operations were analyze d using standard techniques commonly utilized on IODP expeditions. We present a summary of these data types and an initial interpretation organized by shipboard laboratory, providing an integrated vision of subsurface process based on data from each of the thre e cored sites. Each laboratory began the process of comparing an d contrasting results from summit sites, which represent the mos t pristine materials in terms of transport from depth, and flank sites, where eruptive materials overlie previous deposits and have undergone alteration reactions made possible through diffusive exchang e with overlying oxic bottom seawater. Ultimately, results from th e various laboratories will be integrated to provide greater constraint s for evaluating mass transport, temporal variability, metamorphi c and tectonic history, and microbial mechanisms and activity.  

# Lithostratigraphy, petrology, and structure  

Material recovered during Expedition 366 consists primarily o f serpentinite mud containing lithic clasts derived from the underlying forearc crust and mantle and the subducting Pacific plate. A thi n cover of pelagic sediment was found at many sites, whereas pelagi c sediments and volcanic ash deposits were cored underlying serpentinite mud flows on the distal flanks of one of the three core d seamounts. The conceptual model for serpentinite mud volcanis m processes within forearc/subduction complex is best described wit h a cross-section perpendicular to subduction (depicted schematically in Figure F2). Here, we describe in more detail the results fro m each site cored during Expedition 366.  

The bulk of the material recovered in the cores is serpentinit e mudflow matrix (Zone 1 in Figure F2). The matrix ranges from pal e green to dark blue-gray, except in the upper few meters of materia l recovered on the flanks of the seamount, where the serpentinite i s typically oxidized to a yellow-orange color. The serpentinite mu d consists largely of clay- to silt-sized serpentine grains plus accessor y phases such as Fe oxide (magnetite and/or hematite), brucite, spinel , calcite, hydrogarnet, talc, tremolite, and chlorite. Secondary alteration minerals include sjogrenite group minerals, clays, aragonite, and gypsum. Authigenic aragonite, as single acicular needles or radiating clusters of acicular crystals, is common in the upper fe w tens of meters. Some serpentinite mud horizons appear to be reworked; these horizons may contain pelagic nannofossils, volcani c ash, and mineral fragments (e.g., clinopyroxene). Clast content s vary from ${<}1\,\mathrm{vol}\%$ to more than $35\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ lithic clasts, with a mode o f around $5\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ lithic clasts.  

Ultramafic clasts are the dominant clast type (Zone 4) and ar e mainly serpentinized harzburgite $(<<\!5\%$ clinopyroxene) with les s common dunite and pyroxenite. The range in degree of serpentinization is broad, $30\%{-}100\%$ of the original material. Serpentinizatio n is commonly pseudomorphic, and primary modes are inferred i n most of the peridotites because the grain sizes for pyroxene (bastite ) and spinel are largely unaffected. Primary textures were identified i n most samples based on relict mineral phases or pyroxene-spinel relations. All dunites and most harzburgites (from Sites U1491, U1493–U1495, and U1497) are inferred to be porphyroclastic o r coarse tabular primary textures with elongate, deformed olivine an d enstatite, smaller strain-free neoblasts of olivine, as well as holl y leaf–shaped interstitial spinel (e.g., Mercier and Nicolas, 1975; Lenoir et al., 2000). These textures imply that serpentinite material s have undergone solid-state deformation in the lithosphere at relatively low temperatures.  

In contrast, harzburgites from Sites U1492 and U1498 are characterized by protogranular textures, with vermicular spinel-pyroxene clusters inferred to represent decompression breakdown o f garnet (Smith, 1977; Bhanot et al., in press). The protogranular textures are overprinted by a subsequent texture formed in response t o diffuse porous flow and reactive melt transport. Orthopyroxene ha s ragged lobate margins with sharp cusps that point into olivine grai n boundaries (or former grain boundaries); some olivine grains hav e flat facets against orthopyroxene, signifying crystal growth faces i n a melt; and olivine also occurs as euhedral to anhedral inclusion s within larger orthopyroxene grains. Resorbed orthopyroxene sometimes has an oikocrystic appearance, with scattered fragments wit h the same optical orientation. Textures resembled postcumulus textures in cumulate rocks. These textures are inferred to be melt infiltration textures formed by reactive diffuse porous flow of a lowsilica melt. This melt is undersaturated in orthopyroxene, whic h melted incongruently to form a silica-rich melt and new olivine. Because the delicate apices of interstitial pyroxene would likely be destroyed by solid-state flow in the lithosphere, we propose that thi s texture formed in the asthenosphere during melt production in response to subduction initiation.  

No systematic changes of the serpentine textures were observe d between the different sites (Zones 1–4 in Figures F2, F3). Serpentinized ultramafic rocks display mainly pseudomorphic mes h and bastite textures that replaced olivine and orthopyroxene, respectively. Such textures are likely composed of lizardite and chrysotile, but this assumption needs to be verified with postexpeditio n analyses. The mesh displays a pronounced blue color at Yinazao an d Fantangisña Seamounts. Such coloration could be attributed to serpentine composition. Rare interpenetrating textures, which coul d correspond to the high pressure and temperature serpentine variet y (antigorite), were mainly observed at Fantangisña and Asùt Tesor u Seamounts. Serpentinized ultramafic clasts are commonly crosscu t by massive to fibrous veins of serpentine (chrysotile?), crystallizin g into isolated networks of fractures, some of which are conjugate an d some of which display crack-seal-like textures within the vein center. Although the cored serpentinite mud volcanoes are located a t different distances from the Mariana Trench, the absence of a clea r variation of serpentine textures in the ultramafic clasts suggests tha t the  serpentinization  process  occurs  continuously  from  th e slab/mantle interface to the surface and that each mud volcano includes ultramafic clasts that were serpentinized at a range of depth s (temperature and pressure). Late stages of serpentinite alteratio n were observed within each mud volcano, mainly corresponding t o breccia  consisting  of  fragments  of  serpentine  minerals,  serpentinites, and clay minerals cemented by carbonate. The fragmentation obliterated previous serpentine and mantle textures.  

Crustal rocks derived from the underlying forearc crust and th e subducting Pacific plate (Zones 3 and 6, respectively) were observe d at several sites, but they form a major fraction of the recovere d clasts at three sites: U1496 (Asùt Tesoru summit), U1497 (Fantangisña summit), and U1498 (Fantangisña flank). Low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and basalts were recovered from th e summit site of Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Site U1496). These sedimentary clasts are fossiliferous cherty limestones. Mafic volcanic clast s are dolerites and augite-phyric vitrophyres, both with pink titanaugite.  

Volcanic clasts from Fantangisña Seamount include forear c basalts (Zone 3), boninite and volcanic glass (boninitic), an d greenstones and subgreenschist (prehnite-pumpellyite facies) metavolcanics (Zone 6). Metasediments from Sites U1497 and U1498 ar e characterized by recrystallization of calcareous and siliceous microfossils (Zone 5). The degree of recrystallization indicates low-grad e metamorphic conditions. Metasedimentary and volcanic rocks ar e brecciated to varying degrees. Clasts from ultracataclastic shea r zones with rounded clasts suggest deformation mechanisms alon g the plate boundary. Deformed sediment and volcanic rock clasts a t these sites and at Site U1496 are consistent with a significant fraction of the material entrained by the Fantangisña and Asùt Tesor u Seamounts and derived from the subducting Pacific plate (Zones  5 and 6), whereas clasts of boninite and volcanic glass were mor e likely from the oceanic crust of the Philippine Sea plate (Zone 3).  

The seamounts overlie pelagic sediment, which was sampled a t Site U1498. This material is composed of volcanic ash, calcareou s nannofossils (discoasters and coccoliths), foraminifers, radiolarians, and sponge spicules (Zone 2). The underlying volcanic ash establishes a maximum age for mud volcano activity or flank gravity sliding (Oakley et al., 2007). A similar pelagic sediment was recovere d in the first cores from most flank sites; thus, paleontological analysi s will help constrain the date of the most recent activity at each site.  

# Site U1491  

Site U1491 is located on the flank of Yinazao Seamount near th e base of a slight topographic valley. Mixed pelagic muds containing  a variety of clastic materials were typically found at the tops of Hole s U1491A (1.3 mbsf), U1491B (19.4 mbsf), and U1491C (34.2 mbsf ) (Table T2). Beneath these pelagic sediments in Holes U1491B an d U1491C, we recovered normally graded carbonate-dominated breccia-conglomerate sequences and serpentinite muds containin g clasts of serpentinized ultramafic and occasionally carbonate (ree f material?). The nature of the sediment units recovered in Hole s U1491A–U1491C is consistent with the interpretation that thes e units represent serpentinite mudflows, the deepest of which tappe d a source of carbonate clasts and serpentinized ultramafic rocks tha t are likely far less matrix supported than observed previously. Th e source of the carbonate materials is possibly an underlying subducted Cretaceous seamount.  

# Site U1492  

Site U1492 is located on the summit of Yinazao Seamount alon g the extension of an inferred normal fault. Holes U1492A, U1492B, U1492C, and U1492D were drilled to 38.3, 51.4, 139.1, and 228. 8 mbsf, respectively; no materials were recovered from Hole U1492 D (Table T2). Recovered materials from Holes U1492A–U1492C consist of an uppermost unit of red-brown pelagic mud with lithi c clasts, generally ${<}4\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, overlying a lower unit of blue-gray serpentinite pebbly mud containing $5\%{-}10\%$ lithic  clasts  of  serpentinized ultramafic rock. The occurrence of pelagic mud at th e summit of Yinazao Seamount is consistent with the observed sequence of predominantly serpentinite muds containing heavily serpentinized ultramafic clasts capped by a thin veneer of mor e oxidized, seawater-altered serpentinite muds and pelagic sediments. Hole U1492C has an intermediate unit of green serpentinit e mud. Ultramafic clasts in the lowermost portions of the borehole s display the most extreme degrees of serpentinization, with continuous transition toward plastically deforming components. Conversely, ultramafic clasts in the brown to light green uppermos t intervals retain their hardness and frequently exhibit milder degree s of alteration.  

# Sites U1493, U1494, and U1495  

Sites U1493, U1494, and U1495 were drilled on a line fro m south to north on the south flank of Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Tabl e T2). The deepest site (U1493; 3359 meters below sea level [mbsl]) i s the closest to the distal southern edge of the edifice. Hole U1493 A was drilled to 0.1 mbsf, and Hole U1493B was drilled to $32.6~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . Site U1494, with only one hole (39 mbsf) at $2200\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , is farther u p the south slope, and Site U1495, at $1400\;\mathrm{mbsl},$ , is located just sout h of the summit mound.  

Serpentinite muds are covered by brownish pelagic mud tha t contains volcanic ash, foraminifers, nannofossils, and minor diatoms and radiolarians. The thickness of the pelagic muds varies between sites, with approximately $80~\mathrm{{cm}}$ in Hole U1493B, $_{0\mathrm{{~cm}}}$ i n Hole U1494A (likely lost during mudline attempts), $6~\mathrm{{cm}}$ in Hol e U1495A, and $40~\mathrm{{cm}}$ in Hole U1495B. Hole U1494A recovered a n interval of mass flow between 6.9 and 8.78 mbsf that contains reworked serpentinite mud, volcanic ash, and brown muddy to silt y fine sand with foraminifers that are assumed to derive from upslop e sedimentary deposits. Holes U1495A (10.7 mbsf) and U1495B (10. 8 mbsf) exposed a sequence of sandy silt with foraminifers and aragonite crystals overlying oxidized brownish and greenish gray serpentinite pebbly mud. The brownish gray serpentinite pebbly mu d contains authigenic aragonite crystals and lithic clasts. The greenis h gray serpentinite pebbly mud contains lithic clasts and occasiona l layers of matrix-supported breccia-conglomerate.  

The three sites share a common stratigraphy that differs in detai l with location. Uppermost recoveries consist of a layer of reddish oxidized sediments that include microfossil-bearing pelagic mud s with volcanic ash near the surface and reddish yellow serpentinit e muds. The thickness of pelagic sediments and microfossils generall y decreases upslope. Beneath this layer, pale green serpentinite mudflows occur. These mudflows overlie several meters of dark blue t o blue-gray serpentinite mud commonly intercalated with lighte r green serpentinite mud.  

Small clasts of mafic igneous rocks were recovered. These clast s resemble metabasalts, displaying green (chlorite and possibly epidote) and pale red (carbonate) layers. These clasts are either part o f the subducted oceanic crust from the Pacific plate, altered by lowgrade metamorphism and seafloor hydration processes, or from th e crust of the overriding Mariana forearc area of the Philippine Se a plate.  

# Site U1496  

Material from the summit of Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Hole s U1496A [44.8 mbsf] and U1496B [36 mbsf]; Hole U1496C had n o recovery) is characterized by a dominance of pale green serpentinit e mud with a low proportion of lithic clasts compared to the seamount’s flanks and other sites (Table T2). The pale green serpentinite mud is typically soupy or very soft due to high ga s contents and often continued to out-gas days later. Dark blue serpentinite mud is uncommon, but when present it is characterize d by higher clast counts. These characteristics are consistent with a n active summit site that is currently producing high-pH water an d abiotic hydrogen and methane.  

Although less common than at other sites, hard rock clasts derived from the seamount summit mound provide important insights into the plumbing system of the mud volcano. Most commo n are ultramafic clasts, typically highly serpentinized harzburgite s with less common dunite and orthopyroxenite. These material s likely derive from the underlying forearc mantle lithosphere.  

We also recovered clasts of mafic metavolcanic and sedimentar y rock. Sedimentary clasts included a fossiliferous, cherty limeston e that may be pre-Eocene in age. Mafic metavolcanic clasts inclu d dolerites with pink titanaugite- and augite-phyric vitrophyres. Th e presence of pink clinopyroxene in these rocks suggests that thei r protoliths may have been alkali basalts. They are interpreted to b e recycled material from subducted seamounts of the Pacific plate.  

# Site U1497  

Four holes were drilled at Site U1497 on the summit of Fantangisña Seamount (Holes U1497A [34.2 mbsf] and U1497B [23. 8 mbsf]; no recovery from Holes U1497C and U1497D) (Table T2) . The occurrence of deformed sediments and volcanic rocks at thi s site suggests that a significant fraction of the material entrained b y this mud volcano is derived from the subducting Pacific plate. I n particular, the pink augite–bearing volcanic rocks implies mildly alkaline volcanic series in an ocean island seamount. In addition, th e deformed sediments appeared to contain microfossils, such a s radiolarians, that are representative of older (Mesozoic?) sedimen t from the Pacific plate. The presence of ultracataclasite, which requires severe brittle deformation, is unlikely to have occurred i n sediments that were lying on top of the upper plate.  

Mantle-derived harzburgites from Site U1497 are fully serpentinized but retain evidence of primary textures. They are characterized by pseudomorphs of orthopyroxene porphyroclasts tha t are highly elongated (in one case $4\ \mathrm{mm}\times0.4\ \mathrm{mm})$ ), with kink fold s and undulatory extinction. Spinel occurs in association with pyroxene and with subhedral to holly leaf shapes, $1{-}2~\mathrm{mm}$ in size. We interpret  these  observations  to  indicate  altered  porphyroclasti c textures, consistent with deformation at relatively low temperature s and moderate to high rates of strain. The (meta-) sediments ar e characterized by recrystallization of calcareous and siliceous microfossils. The degree of recrystallization indicates low-grade metamorphic conditions. Both the metasedimentary and metavolcani c rocks are brecciated to varying degrees. Brecciation resulted in th e development of fine-grained cataclasite to ultracataclasite domains. The very fine grained sediments (shales and sandstones) were partl y transformed into ultracataclastic shear zones with rounded clasts. The very small grain size $\left(<2\,\upmu\mathrm{m}\right)$ within these shear zones indicate s that the general deformation mechanism was ductile flow. Shea r might have been localized along these shear zones. In general, brecciation (fracture) implies cataclastic deformation mechanisms (fracture and friction) at low-grade, moderate to high strain rates.  

# Site U1498  

Site U1498 is located on the flank of Fantangisña Seamount. Hole U1498A (181.6 mbsf) is on the extreme southwestern flank, very close to the distal edge of the edifice and immediately downslope from a distinct break in slope of the lower flank (at 3507. 5 mbsl) (Table T2). Hole U1498B (260 mbsf; 3296.0 mbsl) was ${\sim}700$ m upslope northeast of Hole U1498A. Lithologies recovered at Sit e U1498A, with increasing depth in hole, include yellowish oxidize d pelagic muds with pelagic microfossils; intercalated blue, green, an d yellow-orange serpentinite mudflow matrix silts and sands; partiall y serpentinized ultramafic rocks (harzburgite and dunite); mafi c metavolcanic rocks and boninites; and, at the bottom of the hole, nannofossil- and volcanic ash-rich sedimentary rocks (siltstone s and fine sandstones). In addition, Hole U1498B returned a large $^{\sim2}$ m) compound clast of ultramafic rock, mafic metavolcanic rock, metalimestone,  and  metachert,  likely  originally  within  a  serpentinite mud matrix, which was not recovered because the use o f rotary coring likely washed out any existing matrix. All but th e ultramafic rock was suspected to be part of a Cretaceous seamount. The recovered clasts from Hole U1498B provide a particularl y illuminating sequence of materials that deserves more detailed description. With increasing depth, the recovery includes (1) partiall y altered (to clay) serpentinized ultramafic rock clasts (stones an d boulders),  (2)  serpentinite  pebbly  mud  with  pebbles  of  serpentinized ultramafics, (3) boulders of serpentinized ultramafic s with numerous fractures filled with chrysotile, and (4) boulders o f metabasite and cherty limestone and clasts of boninite and volcani c glass. These clasts and boulders were likely embedded within serpentinite pebbly mud (observed adhering to some of them), muc h of which was probably washed out during rotary coring. The mudflow matrix is well preserved in Sections 366-U1498B-7R-1 throug h 21R-1, $0{-}30~\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , with intermittent boulders. The most surprisin g recovery occurs in Core 21R. In Section 21R-1, $116~\mathrm{cm}$ , there is  a preserved and presumed inverted primary contact between a boulder of metabasite $\langle35{-}116~\mathrm{cm};$ interpreted to be “igneous basement”) and a boulder of cherty limestone (116–132 cm an d continuing into Section 22R-1, $0{-}81~\mathrm{cm};$ interpreted to be “sedimentary cover,” i.e., originally overlying the metabasite). The deformed cherty limestone appears to contain microfossils such a s radiolarians that are common in older sediments from the Pacifi c plate. The texture and mineralogical composition of the metabasit e (greenstone with chlorite and amphibole) and cherty limestone indicate low- to possibly medium-grade metamorphic overprint o f these lithologies. These two boulders are clearly distinct from th e volcanic rocks (boninites and forearc basalts) of the overriding Mariana forearc crust. The metabasite and limestones are consisten t with a lower plate origin, and their paragenesis and position withi n the serpentinite mudflow matrix material suggests a dynamic overturning during exhumation. Furthermore, preserved cataclasti c  

faults and extensional structures within these boulders (high-angl e normal faults and extensional veins) may be related to (1) shearin g within the subduction channel and bending of the lower plat e during subduction, (2) incorporation and vertical tectonism of intact guyot masses into the forearc region, or (3) faulting during th e early stages of exhumation. The presence of ultracataclasite in th e cherty limestone boulder requires severe brittle deformation tha t would not likely occur in sediment from the overriding forear c crust. At the base of Section 22R-CC, $81{-}93~\mathrm{cm}$ , is a serpentinit e mudflow matrix that continues to Section 23R-1, $12\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . A boulde r of greenstone with numerous fractures infilled with white secondary precipitate was observed in Section 23R-1, $12{-}81\;\mathrm{cm}$ . At abou t Section 24R-1, $9\;\mathrm{cm}_{:}$ , we recovered a contact between serpentinit e mud matrix containing serpentinized ultramafic rock and darkgray, pelagic, vitric silt that contains microfossils. Thus we achieve d our goal of penetrating into the sediment that predates serpentinit e flows at this site. Beginning at Section 27R-1, $13\;\mathrm{cm}$ , we recovere d intercalated pelagic, light tan to medium brown layers of pelagic, silty clay that persisted to the end of the hole.  

# Sediment and rock chemistry  

A selection of representative serpentinites, sediments, and rock s recovered during Expedition 366 were analyzed with the new portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF). On the basis of thes e and visual results, a subset of materials was powdered for a suite o f ship- and shore-based analyses (Table T3). In addition, a thin section was located next to each of the powered rock samples. At sea, powered samples were analyzed using standard inductively couple d plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) techniques t o measure concentrations of Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Sc, V, and $Z\mathbf{r},$ and th e pXRF was used to determine concentrations of Fe, Ca, Mn, Ni, Cr, Zn, and Sr (Table T4).  

Recovered serpentinites are largely uniform in composition , with serpentinized ultramafic rocks and serpentinite muds spanning a limited range in $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{MgO},$ , and $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ compositions (Figur e F4). No significant site-to-site or seamount-to-seamount variabilit y was evident in these major elements or in the variations in $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ which range from 0.1 to $1.7\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ with a mean value of ${\approx}0.6\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Table T3). This range is similar to the ranges reported by Savov et al. (2005a, 2005b, 2007) for serpentinized ultramafic clasts from Conical Seamount and for mudflow matrix and clasts from Sout h Chamorro Seamount.  

Fluid-immobile minor and trace elements Ni, Cr, Zn, V, and S c show no clear distinctions from site to site or seamount to seamount in the serpentinized ultramafic rocks (Figure F5). V, Sc, Mn, and $Z\mathfrak{n}$ show regular patterns of variation; these elements appea r not to be redistributed by fluid-rock exchanges associated with serpentinization. $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ variations in serpentinites differ from those o f the other immobile elements in that there may be site-related variability, with higher values evident for Site U1496 samples. However, Ti concentrations are close to the limits of detection using the shipboard ICP-AES, with only a fraction of our samples yielding detectable readings. It is equally possible that this small number of highe r values were analytical artifacts.  

Major and trace elements that are sensitive to redistribution b y fluid-rock exchange processes with ultramafic rocks show mor e variable patterns. CaO concentrations show considerable variability, ranging from $_{<0.01}$ to ${>}10~\mathrm{wt\%}$ across a limited range in $\mathrm{MgO}$ values (Figure F6). Samples analyzed from all three seamounts include rocks with both $\mathrm{CaO}\geq10~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and high $\mathrm{MgO},$ suggestive o f ultramafic cumulate bulk compositions  for some of the  serpentinized ultramafic rocks. A plot of $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ versus $\mathrm{MgO}$ (Figure F6 ) shows an evident distinction between the serpentinized ultramafi c clasts, which have $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ values of ${>}0.4\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ , and the serpentinit e muds, which range as high as $2.0\,\mathrm{\Delta_{W}t_{/0}^{o/}}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ . Seamount-to-seamount variations are evident; serpentinite muds from the Asùt Tesoru summit site (U1496) have higher $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ concentrations tha n those from the summit of Yinazao Seamount (Site U1492) or Fantangisña Seamount (Site U1497). Pore fluids at the Asùt Tesor u summit are markedly higher in Na than those from the summits o f Fantangisña or Yinazao Seamounts. Thus, the high $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ in Asù t Tesoru muds may reflect equilibration with these Na-enriched por e fluids.  

Sr concentrations in serpentinites are highly variable, rangin g from ${<}5$ to ${>}6000~\mathrm{ppm}$ . As with $\mathrm{Na}$ , the serpentinized ultramafi c clasts are lower, all with ${\le}100\ \mathrm{ppm}\ \mathrm{Sr},$ , relative to the serpentinit e muds ( $100{-}6000+$ ppm; mean $\approx600~\mathrm{ppm}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ). In addition, there ar e clear seamount-to-seamount differences in the serpentinite composition of the muds, likely related to equilibrium with their associate d pore fluids. Yinazao Seamount muds (Site U1492; pore fluids $>700$ $\upmu\mathrm{M})$ are markedly higher in Sr than those from Asùt Tesoru Seamount (Site U1496; pore fluids $\leq10~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ ). The highest Sr and Ca i n sediment samples were found in near-surface cores and relate to th e presence of authigenic aragonite and/or gypsum.  

A small but unique number of metamorphosed mafic volcani c and crustal rocks (sedimentary breccias, metamorphosed basalts, and boninites) were recovered, primarily from the summits of Asù t Tesoru Seamount (Site U1496) and Fantangisña Seamount (Site s U1497 and U1498) (Tables T3, T4). These metabasalts show elevated concentrations of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ $)_{2}\left(1.6\%{-3.3\%}\right)$ and $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ $(2.7\%{-}6.7\%)$ an d range from 16 to $18.6\,\mathrm{\wt\%}$ in $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ , with highly variable Mg O $(2.5\%{-}11.3\%)$ and $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ $(0.8\%{-3.5\%})$ (Figure F7). Analyzed sample s have Ni concentrations of ${\sim}55~\mathrm{ppm}$ , high $\mathrm{V}$ and Sc concentration s (up to 280 and $28\;\mathrm{ppm}$ , respectively) (Figure F5), Sr concentration s between 54 and 236 ppm (Figure F6), Ba concentrations up to 8 8 ppm, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ concentrations between ${\sim}240$ and $470~\mathrm{ppm}$ . There i s evidence for within-clast heterogeneity; samples from each of th e two core sections characterized by mafic clasts (Sections 366- U1496B-8X-CC and 10F-2) show considerable variability in a number of immobile and mobile elements. Plotted on the Shervai s (1982) V-Ti tectonic classification diagram, these rocks are simila r to those from the intraplate/alkali basalt field (Figure F5).  

The metamorphosed mafic rocks resemble a subset of (1) samples recovered from dredges along a wall of a forearc graben nort h of the sites drilled during Expedition 366 (Johnson and Fryer, 1990 ) and (2) trachybasalts recovered from the western Pacific immediately outboard of the Mariana Trench (http://www.iedadata.org) . These mafic rocks do not resemble the forearc tholeiite an d boninite lavas that were known to comprise the volcanic crust of th e outer Mariana forearc (e.g., Reagan et al., 2010). Thus, the mos t likely origin for these rocks is the downgoing Pacific plate, wher e seamounts that expose alkalic lavas are currently subducting.  

# Pore water geochemistry  

Studies of pore fluid geochemistry from summit sites core d during Expedition 366 focused on collecting end-member compositional information, thus improving our overall understanding of th e deep-sourced processes. In contrast, studies of pore fluids from th e flanks of the three cored seamounts focused on elucidating compositional changes of pore fluids with time in the context of water-roc k reactions, diffusive exchange with seawater, microbial activity, an d processes associated with pelagic sediments that underlie serpentinite mud volcanoes in the Mariana forearc.  

Measured dissolved gases $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ , and ${\cal C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}$ provide importan t insights into the physical and chemical conditions of the dee p source. High concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4},$ and ${\cal C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}$ wer e measured in samples from the summit of Asùt Tesoru Seamount, and comparatively low but significant levels were detected a t Yinazao Seamount summit and flank sites. Variability in gas compositions among the three seamounts indicate differences in serpentinization and fluid migration process. Dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ (Figure F8A) show two groupings broadly consistent with thermodynamic estimates of serpentinization-driven $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production (McCollom and Bach, 2009) and subsequent abiotic (Fischer-Tropsc h Type) ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ production.  

Plots of methane versus ethane data from Asùt Tesoru, Conical , and South Chamorro Seamounts reveal linear trends (Figure F8B) . Data from Asùt Tesoru Seamount are consistent with trends fro m South Chamorro and Conical Seamounts. These trends may reflec t different methane consumption rates and/or methane productio n rates of subseafloor microbial communities, likely associated wit h habitability, abundance, and function. Both trends converge at a potential end-member composition $(\mathrm{CH_{4}}=60–100\,\mathrm{mM}$ , $\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}=600-$ $1000\,\upmu\mathrm{M},$ , and $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratio $=100{-}150)$ that may represent the hydrocarbon values predominantly produced by abiotic (Fisher-Tropsc h Type) synthesis processes at depth.  

The chemical composition of deep-sourced pore fluids was assessed along the continuum from shallow to deep source and fro m closest to farthest from the trench (Yinazao, Fantangisña, Asùt Tesoru, South Chamorro, and Conical Seamounts) (Table T1; Figur e F9). Fluids from the summits of Yinazao and, to a lesser extent, Fantangisña Seamounts show elevated Ca and Sr and low to extremel y low K, Na, Cl, $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ B, and $\mathrm{Na}/\mathrm{Cl}$ concentrations relative to botto m seawater. In contrast, fluids that upwelled at the summit of Asùt Tesoru seamount are similar in composition to those from Sout h Chamorro and Conical Seamounts, with extremely high pH value s (up to 12.4), Ca and Sr depletions, and marked enrichments in carbonate alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), $\mathrm{NH}_{4},$ Na, K, $\mathrm{Na}/\mathrm{Cl}_{:}$ , and B. Na concentration s are higher at Asùt Tesoru than any of these five seamounts (Figur e F9; see discussion below).  

We mapped changes in chemical composition of pore fluid s across the Mariana forearc in relation to subduction-related prograde diagenetic and metamorphic reactions that may trigger flui d and elemental releases (Figures F10, F11). Processes that occurre d early (shallow) within the subduction system (i.e., Yinazao and Fantangisña Seamounts) were likely dominated by diagenesis and opal dehydration, whereas later processes (deeper) (i.e., Asùt Tesoru Seamount) included decarbonation and clay mineral decompositio n (Fryer, Pearce, Stokking, et al., 1990; Haggerty, 1991; Haggerty an d Chaudhuri, 1992; Haggerty and Fisher, 1992; Mottl, 1992; Mottl an d Alt, 1992; Fryer et al., 1998; Mottl et al., 2003, 2004; Hulme et al., 2010; Wheat et al., 2008, 2010). Higher DIC at greater depths-toslab is likely linked to carbonate decomposition within the slab. DI C reacting with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from serpentinization could produce $\mathrm{{CH}_{4}},$ light alkanes, or short-chained organic molecules (e.g., acetate and formate). Ca and $\operatorname{Sr}$ were sequestered from the fluids by carbonat e precipitation (the lack of calcite in core samples from Asùt Tesor u Seamount suggests this reaction occurred slightly closer to th e trench, which would exhaust $\mathrm{Ca}$ with continued $C O_{3}{}^{2-}$ production). Although Asùt Tesoru Seamount’s pore fluids are broadly similar t o those studied at South Chamorro and Conical Seamounts, they ar e nonetheless distinct, with much higher Na and Cl concentration s and 3–4 times lower B contents. These differences likely reflect th e lowest pressure-temperature (P-T) prograde metamorphic mineralogical reactions, impacting slab sediments and saponites that result in fluid release (Figure F11).  

This slab signal is overprinted by low-temperature peridotiteseawater reactions and by microbial interaction with fluids, particularly near the seafloor (Mottl et al., 2003; Takai et al., 2005; Curtis e t al., 2013) and on the flanks of the seamounts. Initial pore fluid results from five flank sites cored during Expedition 366 indicate tha t the fluids are mixtures of slab-derived fluids that have undergon e various degrees of alteration with serpentinite materials in the mu d flows and exchange with overlying seawater.  

# Microbiology  

# Sample recovery  

Microbiology sampling during Expedition 366 focused on exploring the limits of microbial life and viral components in serpentinite  mudflow  habitats  across  multiple  depths  usin g cultivation-based and cultivation-independent molecular biologica l approaches and microscopy. Sampling efforts targeted both nearsurface and deeper whole-round cores, especially if there was evidence of a transition across gradients of microbiologically affectin g compounds and gases (e.g., hydrogen, methane, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfate). Two $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ long whole-round samples were collected a t each sampled depth for general microbial analyses (Table T5). Additional whole-round samples were collected for individual investigations. Samples were collected within the context of tracer studie s to assess potential contamination resulting from the drilling an d sample recovery processes.  

Microbiological samples will be analyzed on shore using an array of microbial community–level interrogation techniques. Samples were fixed for total cell counts to quantify microbial biomass. Other samples were maintained at $4^{\circ}C$ for multiple cultivation techniques (including fluorescence-activated cell sorter [FACS] highthroughput media screening and detection of adaptation to physica l parameters such as pressure tolerance). Other samples were flashfrozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for molecular analyses, including small-subuni t (SSU) ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing (to address communit y structure in greater detail), functional gene detection and quantification through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactio n (qPCR), and single-cell genomics (to specifically address individua l cell contributions). In addition, metagenomics of the entire microbial community and metatranscriptomics of the most highly expressed genes will be used to establish metabolic potential an d deeper ecological and evolutionary relationships. Lastly, sample s were preserved for enumerating viral counts and assessing viral diversity.  

# Contamination testing  

Perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PMCH) was used at the first tw o sites (U1491 and U1492) and the last site (U1498), whereas perfluoromethyldecalin (PFMD) was used at the remaining sites (U1493– U1497). This split was partially due to tracer availability and partially to our ability to establish proper protocols for both perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs). Data obtained from PMCH measurement s show relatively clean (uncontaminated) drilling by advanced pisto n corer (APC) and half-length APC (HLAPC) operations at Sit e U1492. This analysis, however, indicates disturbance in cores an d drill fluid intrusion at Site U1498, which was drilled using a rotar y core barrel (RCB) technique. Generally, drill fluid intrusion int o samples was higher at sites where drilling became difficult and required the use of either extended core barrel (XCB) or RCB drilling. Unfortunately, analysis of the PFMD data does not provide a distinct indication of contamination compared to results using th e PMCH tracer. PFMD is a relatively new method for contaminatio n tracing, and the results from this expedition strongly reinforce th e need for further method development if it is to be used when corin g sediment.  

# Shipboard DNA extraction and qPCR  

Shipboard DNA extraction from serpentinite mud samples wa s unsuccessful using a standard qPCR protocol (e.g., Lever et al., 2015). Additional analysis shows high adsorption of DNA to serpentinite minerals; thus, improvements in DNA extraction protocols in terms of adsorption prevention will be necessary for furthe r DNA extractions. Performing qPCRs on board the R/V JOIDES Resolution is feasible and can expand the range of available shipboar d analyses for future expeditions.  

# Physical properties  

Among the eight sites that were drilled during Expedition 366 , the physical properties obtained at the two summit sites at Yinaza o and Asùt Tesoru Seamounts (U1492 and U1496, respectively) ar e distinct. Physical property values are usually associated with consolidation and compaction of sedimentary deposits (e.g., bulk density, porosity, thermal conductivity, and shear strength); however, data from the two summit sites, at the active spring areas observe d from the ROV Jason II, indicate that serpentinite muds at these site s were subject to different processes than those at the other sites, which experienced “typical” consolidation.  

For example, the porosity data collected during Expedition 36 6 followed two trends (Figure F12). One trend was defined by dat a from summit Sites U1492 and U1496 and ODP Site 780. At each o f these sites, porosity decreases with depth from seafloor values o f $60\%{-}70\%$ to values of $45\%{-}55\%$ at 120 mbsf. An exponential tren d was fit to the Site U1492 data, resulting in an Athy’s coefficien t (Athy, 1930) of 0.36, indicating that this summit site is slightl y underconsolidated (Bekins and Dreiss, 1992). Both sites (U1492 an d U1496) are located in areas of fluid discharge where discharge rate s exceed $10\;\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Hulme et al., 2010). These sites targeted our bes t estimate for the location of the current conduit for fluid and material flow from depth. A slight compaction effect is suggested i n Holes U1492A and U1492B by the overall increasing trend i n gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density with depth, whereas Hol e U1492C, the closest one to the presumptive conduit, has lower GR A values and a rather constant trend to the bottom of the hole $[\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf) (Figure F13). Likewise, consolidation and compaction trend s with depth in Hole U1496A at Asùt Tesoru Seamount show a sligh t increase of bulk density, whereas no such trend was observed i n Hole U1496B. The rather constant GRA bulk density and porosit y values observed in Holes U1492C and U1496B, both located les s than $20\;\mathrm{m}$ from the presumptive conduit area, are jointly influence d by overpressured fluids localized in the immediate $\left(\sim\!20\textrm{m}\right)$ regio n of the central conduit system, which minimized the compaction o f serpentinite mud deposits at these holes. In contrast, GRA densit y increases in Holes U1492A, U1492B, and U1496A suggest this overpressure effect associated with the conduit system is not effective 5 0 to $100\,\mathrm{m}$ from the area with the most active fluid discharge. A widt h of less than ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ for the active conduit at Yinazao and Asùt Tesoru Seamounts is consistent with conduit diameters, which ar e considerably smaller than the size of the mud volcanoes themselve s and those described for other mud volcanoes (Krastel et al., 2003).  

In contrast, there is a greater decrease in porosity with depth a t the other sites (mostly flank sites) to porosity values less than $30\%$ a t only 40 mbsf. The Athy coefficient fit at Site U1494, for example, i s 17.3—unreasonably high for a compaction trend. Below 40 mbsf, porosity values stabilize and remain fairly constant with depth. Suc h low porosities (and high Athy coefficients) are suggestive of processes other than compaction being responsible for the observe d data.  

Although similar, there are slight peculiarities in data from th e other sites. Even the two sites located on the edge of seamount summits, Sites U1495 and U1497, show behavior more typical of flan k sites. The porosity trend at Site U1495 resembles other flank site s but is more extreme, decreasing from $57\%$ to $36\%$ at only 4 mbsf.  

The third summit site (Site U1497 on Fantangisña Seamount) i s distinct from the other two summit sites. The porosity trend wit h depth is comparable to those described for the other flank sites (Figure F12). These trends suggest that either the mud volcano has no t been active recently or subsurface flow in this area was either diffuse, compartmentalized, and not necessarily vertical or was following trends in local faults associated with the slump features at th e summit.  

# Downhole measurements  

Temperature measurements using the advanced piston core r temperature tool (APCT-3) were attempted 14 times, resulting in 1 1 records that were used to estimate formation temperatures. Thes e estimates were combined with measured seafloor temperatures an d thermal conductivities from collected cores to calculate heat flo w for the three summit sites and two of the flank sites (Table T6). Th e summit heat flow values range from 16.8 to $17.8~\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , wherea s the two flank sites range from 30.5 to $31.9~\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ (Figure F14). These values and differences are consistent with data from th e South Chamorro Seamount summit, which average $15~\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ i n ODP Holes 1200A and 1200E (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002), and those collected on the flanks of Conical Seamount at DSD P Sites 458 and 459 (Uyeda and Horai, 1981).  

Wireline logging was conducted in Hole U1498B after penetrating to 260 mbsf. The triple combo tool string was used to measur e magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma radiation (NGR), electrica l resistivity, borehole diameter, and temperature of borehole fluids. The downhole logging data show excellent agreement with the shipboard data. The NGR data are consistent with $9\textrm{m}$ of pelagic sediment at the sediment/water interface that was not recovered durin g coring operations and registered the cherty limestone and metabasalt units. Two possible layers of pelagic sediments may be present at 118 and 137 mbsf intercalated within the serpentinite (e.g., pale streaks in intervals 366-U1498B-13R-4, $21{-}25~\mathrm{cm}$ , and 15R-3, $6{-}10~\mathrm{cm}]$ ). Here, peaks in NGR values are at similar levels to th e Unit I, presumable ash-rich pelagic sediments that are thought t o exist in the upper $9\;\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1498A. Additional evidence for layers of pelagic sediment is the lack of evidence in the resistivity dat a for clasts. The resistivity data were useful for detecting large clasts.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The new 2G Enterprises superconducting rock magnetomete r (SRM; liquid helium free) was installed at the start of Expeditio n 366. Paleomagnetic analyses of archive halves and representativ e discrete samples were performed. The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of almost all section halves was measured at $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals  after  0,  5,  10,  15,  and $20\ \mathrm{~mT~}$ alternating  field  (AF ) demagnetization steps. The use of principal component analyse s (PCA) provided consistent NRM inclination and declination value s between section halves and discrete samples.  

A pervasive vertical magnetic overprint was imparted to th e cores, likely by the drilling process. In some cases, overprinting wa s largely demagnetized by AF demagnetization in peak fields of $5\;\mathrm{mT}$ ; in many intervals, however, enough of the overprint remains afte r the $20\,\mathrm{~mT~}$ demagnetization step that inclination values remai n anomalously high. The axial dipole inclination was expected to b e between $29.5^{\circ}$ and $33.2^{\circ}$ at the latitude $(15.8^{\circ}{-}18.1^{\circ}\mathrm{N})$ of coring operations. We searched for paleomagnetic reversals for magnetostratigraphic dating in the volcanic ash-rich pelagic sediments tha t overlie the serpentinite muds, but no clear reversals were found. I n some cores, a particularly high intensity overprint was observed between 3 and $5\;\mathrm{m}$ above the base of the core, for example, Cores 366- U1492C-5F and 8F (Figure F15).  

Magnetic susceptibility levels are generally high, reflecting th e high concentrations of magnetic minerals, particularly magnetite, in the cores. Magnetite was of interest because it was produce d during serpentinization reactions, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the iron content of the initial minerals. Magnetic susceptibility is higher at the Asùt Tesoru sites, averaging over 1000 SI, compared to the other two mud volcanoes (Figure F15). There i s some local correlation between magnetic susceptibility levels an d the color of the serpentinite mud, but no correlation across all of th e sites. In Hole U1496A, for example, the darker mud between 26 an d 27 mbsf has five times lower susceptibility than the surroundin g pale green serpentinite mud, whereas in Hole U1493, the pale gree n serpentinite mud at 20–23 mbsf has much lower susceptibility tha n the blue-gray mud above and below it.  

Magnetic intensities are high, given the high concentrations o f magnetic minerals, but there is an unexpectedly large range of intensity values (Figure F15). At Site U1496, the paleomagnetic intensity is relatively low and correlates with magnetic susceptibility, a s expected from a consistent lithology and magnetization process. A t other sites, however, magnetic intensity is relatively high compare d to magnetic susceptibility, and the correlation between the two i s less clear, perhaps due to the difficulty in demagnetizing the variable overprint in many of these cores. NRM intensity generall y ranges from $1.0\times10^{-3}$ to $1.0\;\mathrm{A/m}$ , reaching maximum values of 1 0 $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1494A in a dark bluish gray serpentinite pebbly mud. Generally, ultramafic rock clasts present relatively high values o f both magnetization and bulk magnetic susceptibility in discret e samples.  

# Cased borehole operations and results  

Each of the four serpentinite mud volcanoes visited during Expedition  366  (Yinazao,  Fantangisña,  Asùt  Tesoro,  and  Sout h Chamorro Seamounts) included a borehole operational component. The goal was to deploy an infrastructure that intersected a n active hydrologic flow of deep-sourced fluid along a continuum o f conditions across the forearc. These boreholes include screene d sections to allow formation fluids to enter and are designed for future deployments of CORK-lites (Wheat et al., 2012). This construct will enable the community to use the boreholes for scientifi c endeavors, including but not limited to monitoring physical an d chemical changes, in situ passive experimentation, and manipulative experiments to address a range of potential scientific question s that center on geophysical, geochemical, and/or microbial studies.  

A CORK-lite has a modular design that includes multiple ports fo r experiments and sensors inside or outside of the CORK body an d for large-diameter $\left(25\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ experiments and sensors to be deploye d within the boreholes, which can be either sealed or allowed to discharge.  

# South Chamorro Seamount (Site 1200)  

Given the limitations of the original-style CORK that was deployed at Site 1200 during Leg 195, the plan was to remove th e CORK body, thus leaving the hole open for a future ROV deployment of a CORK-lite (Wheat et al., 2012). While attempting to remove the CORK body, the latch rods failed to remove the portion o f the CORK that latches into the casing hanger, forming a seal an d focusing discharge up a steel pipe that contains the seal sleeve. Thi s steel pipe parted above the seal sleeve. However, the CORK is likel y sealed with access to the underlying casing via a portion of a PV C insert that was deployed in 2009, providing a conduit for futur e sampling activities. The recovered CORK body included white an d reddish material on the outside that was collected for microbial an d mineralogical analyses. About seven limpets also were recovere d from the CORK body and preserved for shore-based identification.  

# Yinazao (Site U1492), Fantangisña (Site U1497), and Asùt Tesoro (Site U1496) Seamounts  

A casing string was deployed after an initial hole was drilled int o the summit region at Yinazao, Fantangisña, and Asùt Tesoro Seamounts. The casing string included at least three joints of screene d casing, placing the screened casing as deep as possible and well below the near-surface microbial “transition” layer (e.g., Mottl et al., 2003). Difficulties experienced during the deployment of the firs t casing string changed the depth and design of the second and thir d deployments.  

The initial borehole casing string was deployed at Site U1492. This casing string was $211~\mathrm{m}$ long with a screened section at $^{153-}$ 199 mbsf. The other two casing strings were shorter ( ${\sim}110\;\mathrm{m}$ long ) with screened sections at ${\sim}35{-}70$ mbsf. A cement plug was deployed at the base of each of the three casing strings because of  a failure during the deployment of a mechanical bridge plug at Sit e U1492; however, later operations did break the bridge plug free s o the base of the casing string could be cemented. These cementin g operations were important because serpentinite material flowe d into the base of the casing string at Site U1496 within hours of landing the casing within the casing hanger, filling the bottom $7\,\mathrm{m}$ of th e open cased hole. We returned to two (Sites U1496 and U1497) o f the three boreholes to check the status of the cement and collect  a water sample with the water-sampling temperature probe (WSTP ) within these two boreholes. We did not have time to return to th e cased borehole at Site U1492 after cementing operations.  

The cement plug was reached at both sites (U1496 and U1497 ) several days after cementing operations. The cement was in place a s planned and likely sealed the boreholes from intruding material. Water samples were collected from the middle of the uppe r screened casing joint at both sites. Analysis of this water indicates  a mixture of seawater and formation fluid. The Site U1496 sample includes the highest dissolved gas measurements made during the expedition, highlighting the importance of sampling formation fluid s directly and without the artifacts induced by the coring and sampl e handling process.  

Each of the three new boreholes tapped an active hydrologi c zone with formation fluids that discharge into the casing and vent a t the seafloor. By deploying a CORK-lite with an ROV, the community will be able to collect pristine fluids (especially dissolved gases ) that are unaffected by sampling artifacts. The community also will be able to collect and/or filter tens to thousands of liters of formation fluid for chemical, microbial, and viral analyses, volumes tha t are not possible to obtain during standard IODP coring operations. The deployment of CORK-lites also opens the cased boreholes to  a range of sensors, samplers, and experiments that will allow scientists to build a network of experiments, monitoring, and manipulations at the seafloor or within the borehole and with the borehole s sealed or open to discharge.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 366 successfully cored the flanks and summit regions of three Mariana forearc serpentinite mud volcanoes, each located  at  varying  depth  to  the  subducting  Pacific  plate,  t o characterize processes associated with the formation and activity o f these mud volcanoes. The expedition was designed to examine subduction-related processes in terms of the relationship between geochemical  cycling,  seismicity,  and  deep  biosphere  activity  i n subduction zones and suprasubduction zone lithosphere. The intent of the expedition was to address how these processes vary spatially along the strike of the Mariana system and with depth to th e subduction channel ${\sim}13\$ to $18\,\mathrm{km}$ below). The results from this expedition complement those from previous Legs 125 and 195 at tw o other serpentinite mud volcanoes, Conical and South Chamorr o Seamounts, both further from the trench than the three core d during Expedition 366.  

Previous drilling during Leg 125 used rotary coring, and poo r recovery failed to provide much of the mudflow matrix in which th e rock clasts were entrained. Leg 195 used APC/XCB coring and recovered many thin mudflows, some with more than $100\%$ recovery, because the matrix contained gases that expanded upon recovery. During Expedition 366, all three coring systems were used, each fo r a specific purpose. Drilling results during Legs 125 and 195 prove d that the mudflows contain, in part, materials from the subductio n channel below the edifices. Expedition 366 recovered a greater diversity of subduction channel material from closer to the Marian a Trench, thus from shallower depth-to-slab, than material recovere d in the two previous legs. Rock clasts and matrix muds from the serpentinite flows recovered during Expedition 366 provide a far bette r view of the regional processes that have affected the forearc. Furthermore, the cased holes with screened sections that were drille d into the summit regions of these three mud volcanoes now constitute the first regional laboratory for monitoring subduction-relate d phenomena in the trench-proximal region of a nonaccretionary, intraoceanic, convergent plate margin.  

We achieved or will achieve with shore-based analyses all four o f the overarching scientific goals outlined in the Expedition 366 Scientific Prospectus. These goals were to assess (1) mass transpor t processes in the Mariana forearc region, (2) spatial variability o f slab-related fluids, (3) metamorphic and tectonic history and physical properties of the subduction zone, and (4) biological activity associated with deep-derived subduction zone material. Associate d with these four scientific goals are nine specific objectives, described below.  

1. Core mudflows on the flanks of each mud volcano and recover conduit muds from areas near active springs on the summit of each mud volcano.  

This objective allowed us to address both construction histor y and transport processes. We recovered serpentinite mudflows wit h variable characteristics on the flank of each edifice from Site s U1491 (Yinazao Seamount), U1493, U1494, U1495 (Asùt Tesor u Seamount), and U1498 (Fantangisña Seamount). The serpentinit e mudflow matrix varies in color with depth, and although it was distinctly disturbed by flow-in during APC and XCB coring, it doe s preserve discrete horizons of clast content and matrix constituents. The cause of the color change in the serpentinite muds is not obvious and will become the focus of several proposed shore-base d studies. Although we were without X-ray diffraction (XRD) or X-ra y fluorescence (XRF) instruments during Expedition 366, samples analyzed with a pXRF and ICP-AES showed essentially no differenc e in the major elements between the compositions of the serpentinized rock clasts and muds from seamount to seamount, except for specific major and trace elements that are sensitive t o redistribution by fluid-rock exchange processes. These element s showed more variable patterns in the matrix and fluid data, indicating a regional consistency with depth-to-slab. Expedition 366 results confirm the broad interpretation of gravity core, piston core, and submersible/ROV push core work over the past decade that revealed a regional gradient in terms of change in slab-related fluid s with depth to the subduction channel recorded by the fluids risin g in active springs in serpentinite mud volcanoes. The enhancemen t of this finding as a result of Expedition 366 was that the source o f most of the fluids is initially prehnite-pumpellyite facies dehydration followed by greenschist alteration and lastly blueschist dehydration and mobilization of fluid mobile elements. For example, boron and potassium data show drastic increases in the concentration in muds and fluids with distance from the trench. There remai n questions regarding the eruptive processes. Such questions woul d be better addressed through monitoring. For example, how variabl e were the volumes of erupted materials, and what controls the eruptive cycle? The planned CORK-lite installations at the cased boreholes will be instrumental in addressing temporal-related questions.  

2. Date discrete mudflows paleontologically, should there be sediment layers between them.  

Dating discrete layers will help to better understand the episodicity of the eruptions and how differences among episodes may affect transport processes. Dating will be possible as a consequence o f recovering pelagic sediment overlying flank serpentinite mudflow s and because we were able to penetrate the underlying forearc sediments at two of the holes on Fantangisña Seamount’s flank. We recovered interlayered mudflows of clay-sized serpentinite mud of  a wide variety of oxidized and unoxidized material, as well as interlayered pelagic sediments on the distal edges of Fantangisña Seamount. Very few rock clasts were found in these mudflows. Also, beneath the serpentinite on Fantangisña Seamount, we recovere d ash-rich sediment with abundant microfossils. Biostratigraphic age s for the recovered sediments will be determined on shore. The recovery of this material is reminiscent of that in the deepest sediment interval (near Eocene igneous basement) in Hole 459 (Leg 60), which is located south of Asùt Tesoro Seamount (Despraires, 1982).  

3. Determine variability in the composition of rock clasts in the mudflows.  

The anticipated discovery of subduction channel physical an d compositional properties was realized through the recovery of numerous rock clasts. We discovered striking variability in the lithology of the clasts within the mudflows, and the results of shipboar d observations and analysis show that all five of the serpentinite seamounts cored to date (including Leg 125 and 195 cores) contain materials from the subducted slab. The fact that all of these mu d volcanoes tapped slab-derived fluids and erupt rock clasts from th e subduction channel confirms that these edifices are indeed natural windows to slab processes. The range of recovered material fro m Expedition 366 is particularly illuminating because we recovere d coralline material and metavolcanics with alkalic provenance, a s well as compositions consistent with ocean island basalts and shallow intrusives. These lithologies indicate a source from subducte d Pacific plate seamounts. Also collected were clasts that span the entire range of lithospheric compositions known to have formed in th e suprasubduction-zone region of the Mariana forearc. Thus, Expedition 366 results also confirm that serpentinite mud volcanoes erup t the entire suite of rock materials that represent the subsurface architecture of the Mariana arc. The fact that the mud volcanoes occur exclusively in association with forearc scarps suggests tha t vertical tectonism of the forearc is the rule rather than the exception.  

4. Study potential systematic variability in the degree of serpentinization of rock clasts and distinguish the characteristics of the mudflow matrix on the flanks from those in the summit conduit regions.  

Coring on the flanks of the edifices revealed for the first tim e that there is systematic increase in the degree of serpentinization o f rock clasts and of secondary mineralization of the mudflow matri x with increasing depth down the flanks of the mud volcanoes. Mos t ultramafic clasts recovered from the flanks reacted to a greater extent with muds that are generally $100\%$ serpentinized. Furthermore, individual serpentinized rock clasts are soft enough to indent with  a fingernail. Reaction of the clasts with the matrix muds is eviden t where halos surround clasts and darken the adjacent mud. The degree of serpentinization in ultramafic clasts is variable in the summit regions, where episodicity of activity in the conduits of thes e edifices may cause pulsing, presumably on various timescales, of th e mud matrix and fluids and may refresh the throat with new, and les s reacted materials.  

5. Examine transport conditions of muds and pore fluids on the seamount flanks.  

Transport conditions of muds and pore fluids are remarkabl y variable on the flanks and in the summit regions of the seamounts. Changes in the density and porosity of mudflows on the flanks o f the seamounts indicates that compaction is not the only force tha t affects trends in these physical properties with depth. Additionally, deformation by gravitational sliding (Oakley et al., 2007) may affec t these profiles, as well as continued serpentinization and alteratio n to other phases that significantly reduce porosity. Causes for thes e changes in physical properties will be assessed in shore-based mineralogical analysis and rheologic studies of whole-round samples. The latter were collected and preserved for mechanical, stress, an d permeability testing, including the determination of physical properties.  

6. Provide a measure for comparing the nature of hydrologic characteristics (e.g., diffuse versus channelized fluid flow) on the flanks and summit regions of the mud volcanoes.  

Systematic variations in interstitial water composition profile s from flank sites indicate no significant vertical discharge of fluids. At each of the summit sites, pore fluid compositions show clear evidence of seepage at discharge rates in excess of the serpentinite matrix, which also is ascending and constructing the dome-lik e features on the summit of two of the three cored seamounts. Thes e results are consistent with published data that define the range an d area of discharge at the summit sites.  

7. Determine the composition of fluid from depth and assess the type, extent, and effect of diagenetic reactions that occurred on the flanks of serpentinite mud volcanoes.  

Systematic variations in interstitial water composition profile s from Yinazao ( $13\,\mathrm{km}$ depth-to-slab), Fantangisña $\left(14\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ , and Asù t Tesoru $\mathrm{[18~km]}$ ) Seamounts augments previous results from Sout h Chamorro $\left(19\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ and Conical $\left(18\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ Seamounts (Table T1). Thi s combination of data reaffirms the dramatic change in the compositions of the slab-derived serpentinizing fluids as the slab descend s (Mottl et al., 2004; Hulme et al., 2010). Dramatic differences includ e elevated Ca and Sr and low to extremely low K, Na, Cl, $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ B, an d $\mathrm{Na}/\mathrm{Cl}$ in fluids from Yinazao Seamount and, to a lesser extent, Fantangisña Seamount. In contrast, discharging fluids from Asùt Tesoru Seamount have a composition similar to that from Sout h Chamorro and Conical Seamounts, with extremely high pH (up t o 12.4), Ca and Sr depletions, and marked enrichments in carbonat e alkalinity, DIC, DOC, $\mathrm{NH}_{4},$ Na, K, $\mathrm{Na}/\mathrm{Cl}_{:}$ , and B. Na concentration s are higher at Asùt Tesoru Seamount than at any the five seamount s mentioned above. Chemical compositions of pore water from th e flank sites are consistent with a mixture of slab-derived fluid an d seawater. Superimposed on this mixture are diagenetic changes tha t are evident in some of the measured chemical species.  

Coupled to the seventh objective was the desire to document th e composition of dissolved gases, specifically $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4},$ and $\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}$ . Compositions of these gases differed from site to site, providing  a measure of deep-sourced fluid composition. High concentrations o f $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4},$ and ${\cal C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}$ were observed at the summit of Asùt Tesoru Seamount, and comparatively low but significant levels were detecte d at both summit and flank sites at Yinazao Seamount. Concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ show two distinct groupings of data: serpentinization-driven $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production  and  methane  production.  Th e relationship between methane and ethane data from Asùt Tesoru, South Chamorro, and Conical Seamounts converge on a singl e composition that may represent the hydrocarbon values produce d by abiotic (Fisher Tropsch Type) synthesis in the deep-source d fluid.  

8. Collect samples for the study of microbial/viral community interactions in materials bathed in deep-sourced fluids, distal serpentinite mud flows, and the underlying forearc pelagic sediment.  

Whole-round samples collected for microbiological studie s were subsampled for shore-based analyses to explore the limits o f microbial life in serpentinized mud using cultivation-based and cultivation-independent molecular biological approaches, microscopy, and assays for the detection of viruses. Postexpedition analyses wil l include an array of microbial community–level interrogation techniques: (1) total cell counts to quantify microbial biomass; (2) cultivation (including FACS high-throughput media screening an d detection of adaptation to physical parameters such as pressure tolerance); (3) molecular analyses, including SSU ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing (to address community structure in greate r detail), functional gene detection, and quantification through qPC R and single-cell genomics (to specifically address individual cell contributions); (4) metagenomics of the entire microbial communit y and metatranscriptomics of the most highly expressed genes to establish metabolic potential and deeper ecological and evolutionar y relationships; and (5) viral counts and diversity. The only microbia l analysis conducted at sea was to assess the quality of the whol e rounds via tracer analysis. Tracers were pumped into the drill strin g prior to and during core recovery. Systematic sampling of the core d material and overlying surficial fluids indicates that most of th e whole-round samples for microbiology are suitable for continue d shore-based analyses.  

9. Complete initial fabrication of borehole structures for future in situ experiments and observations.  

Three casing strings, each with three or more joints of screene d casing, were deployed, one in each of the summits of the cored serpentinite mud volcanoes. These casing strings form the foundatio n for a future deployment of CORK-lites (Wheat et al., 2012), whic h allow for a range of experiments and observations to be conducte d simultaneously within a single structure that is open to deepsourced fluids. We collected a water sample and measured temperature within two of the three newly deployed cased boreholes day s after the bottom was sealed with cement. The recovered fluids wer e a mixture of seawater (drilling fluids) and deep-sourced fluid, an d temperatures were higher than expected based on measurement s collected during sediment coring operations. Combined, these dat a indicate that both boreholes tapped a hydrologic zone and activ e fluid discharge exists. The third site also should have active discharge based on systematic variations in interstitial water composition profiles that indicate fluid discharge rates of centimeters to ten s of centimeters per year in the summit area. Similar results were observed at South Chamorro Seamount, which supports a COR K (Hole 1200C) with active fluid discharge. During Expedition 366, we visited Hole 1200C to remove the CORK body. Most of th e CORK body from Hole 1200C was removed, leaving the sleeve join t that allows access to the CORK, but it retains the 3.25 inch diameter. Thus, with future funding and ROV operations, a network o f four cased borehole systems will exist that span a range of distance s from the trench, representing a range of pressure and temperatur e conditions at depth and different compositions of deep-sourced fluids. Such a transect will be instrumental to in situ experimentatio n and future monitoring to study, for example, processes associate d with material (e.g., rocks, fluid, and mud) flow and alteration (e.g., abiotic and biotic reactions).

# Guam port call  

Expedition 366 officially began with the first line ashore at Doc k F-3 in Guam at $0648~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 December 2016. Actions for the por t call were to complete the change out of the top drive motor, whic h failed on the last site of the previous expedition, and replace th e cryogenic magnetometer, which required JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) technical staff with third-party support fro m 2G Enterprises. Loading included 1000 metric tons of marine gas oil (MGO), 20 metric tons of barite, and 20 metric tons of sepiolit e drilling mud via local P-trucks, 58 joints (3 flats) of $10\%$ inch 40. 5 lb/ft buttress casing, 2 Baker-Hughes-Inteq drilling motors, 2 HO C DTU950 underreamers, and 3 standard reentry cones. Refrigerate d containers carrying nearly $7~\mathrm{km}$ of Expedition 363 cores were dispatched to the Kochi Core Repository in Japan, and returning surface freight was dispatched including the rental mud motor, a n HOC DTU950 underreamer for refurbishment, and other miscellaneous freight. Originally, the JOIDES Resolution was scheduled t o depart at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on Tuesday, 13 December. However, due to militar y operations taking place in the area that morning, the decision wa s made with the pilot to depart at $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Transit to Site 1200  

The last line was cast off at $0518~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 December 2016, an d the transit proceeded without incident. The ship arrived at Sit e 1200 at $1624\,\mathrm{h}$ the same day.  

# Site 1200  

# Hole 1200C  

After an $11~\mathrm{h}$ transit from Guam, the vessel arrived at Site 120 0 (proposed Site MAF-4B; $13^{\circ}47.0724^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $146^{\circ}0.1717^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; water depth $=$ $2932\ \mathrm{m})$ at $1624\ \mathrm{h}$ on 13 December 2016. Planned operations a t Hole 1200C were to remove the currently installed CORK and RO V platform, install a new ROV platform, and deploy the WSTP beyond the drill string to the depth of the screened portion of th e cased hole to collect pristine formation fluid and measure a temperature profile for calculating the natural rate of fluid discharg e from the borehole.  

The recovery attempt began at $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 December, and several near misses occurred when the tool appeared to go over the to p of the CORK head but the pipe heaved off before the J-slots wer e fully engaged. After $5.25~\mathrm{h}$ , the CORK head was engaged and th e recovery tool J-slots were fully engaged. However, the CORK hea d parted while attempting to pull it free of the reentry structure. Les s than 10,000 lb of overpull was applied to get the CORK latch t o shift; however, it failed at the latch assembly. Video of the reentr y cone after removal showed a small diameter tube protruding fro m the center of the reentry cone. This was interpreted to be a piece o f PVC tubing that had been previously installed in the CORK vi a ROV in 2009 after the original thermistor string was recovered i n 2003. The high-resolution camera with the new upgraded pan, tilt, and zoom capability proved to be effective during the CORK recovery and assessment.  

At $1615~\mathrm{h},$ , the recovery tool with the recovered portion of th e CORK returned to the rig floor. Science party microbiologists an d geochemists sampled macrofauna and precipitates from the COR K head. Because the original CORK platform was not recovered an d because the lower portion of the CORK remained in the hole, replacement of the ROV landing platform and the WSTP water sampling could not take place, and preparations were made to transit t o Site U1491.  

# Site U1491  

The ship transited $137\;\mathrm{nmi}$ to Site U1491 (proposed Site MAF16A) in $14.5~\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $9.8~\mathrm{kt}$ , arriving in the area o f Site U1491 at $1050\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 December 2016.  

# Hole U1491A  

A precision depth recorder (PDR) seafloor depth measuremen t was taken once the ship was over the site coordinates. A PDR seafloor depth measurement was 4442 meters below sea level (mbsl), different from the calculated depth of $4500~\mathrm{mbsl}$ . This differenc e was attributed to the slope geometry of the seamount’s flank; th e PDR $3.5\;\mathrm{kHz}$ reflection first arrival came from upslope rather tha n from directly under the ship. To be certain about the seafloor depth, the seafloor was tagged with the core bit. At $0645\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 Decembe r 2016, the bit took weight at $4494~\mathrm{{mbsl},}$ , starting Hole U1491 A $\left\langle{15^{\circ}47.1175^{\prime}}\mathrm{N}\right\rangle$ , $147^{\circ}8.4909^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; water depth $=\,4494\,\mathrm{{\m}}$ ). During th e tagging process, sediment entered the bit and bottom-hole assembly (BHA) and was then collected with the APC core barrel fro m inside the BHA without the core barrel being fired. The core barrel was recovered at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ with $1.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of recovery, including three distinct mudlines, likely resulting from ship heave causing the BHA t o hop and tag the seafloor three or more times.  

# Hole U1491B  

At $1015\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , Hole U1491B $\phantom{-}15^{\circ}47.1176^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{{:}}}$ , $147^{\circ}8.4908^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ wate r depth $=4493\;\mathrm{m}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ) was started at a seafloor depth of 4492 mbrf. Oriented APC coring continued using the advance by recovery metho d penetrating to 19.4 mbsf and recovering $19.0~\mathrm{m}$ of core $(98\%)$ . Coring was halted due to the continued presence of coarse gravel. All cores were incomplete strokes. Formation temperature measurements using the APCT-3 were attempted at 13.2 and 19.4 mbsf. Th e drill string was pulled out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at 232 5 h.  

# Hole U1491C  

Hole U1491C $\left\langle15^{\circ}47.1940^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{:}\right.$ , $147^{\circ}8.4119^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; water depth $=4519$ m) is located $200\mathrm{~m~}$ northwest (downslope) of Hole U1491B, an d coring started at $0025~\mathrm{h}$ at a seafloor depth of 4519 mbsl. The firs t two cores were oriented APC cores, and then because of incomplet e stroke we switched to the HLAPC and advanced by recovery fo r Cores 366-U1491C-3F through 8F. At no time did the barrel full y stroke, and recovery varied from 1 to $4.7\;\mathrm{m},$ prompting a switch t o XCB coring. XCB Core 9X required $70\ \mathrm{min}$ of rotating time to cu t the core, as well as substantial effort to clean out $5\,\textrm{m}$ of coars e gravel fill on the bottom prior to cutting the core. Core 9X contained only $0.27\textrm{m}$ recovery due to a jammed piece of core in th e XCB cutting shoe. A second XCB core barrel was deployed, and th e bit was advanced to $43.9\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ when the driller noticed a loss o f torque and pump pressure. Two unsuccessful attempts were mad e to recover the core barrel, but the overshot did not engage the pulling neck on the barrel. Upon recovery of the sinker bar string, th e overshot was found to have all shear pins intact, but the core lin e was damaged on both runs. Recognizing that something was wron g with the drill assembly (and fearing a BHA failure), the drill strin g was recovered back to the ship. We found that the BHA had faile d and that the following were lost in the hole: the bit, a nonmagneti c drill collar, an APC/XCB outer core barrel assembly, and an XC B core barrel assembly. At $0000\ \mathrm{h}$ on 18 December 2016, the shi p started the $9\,\mathrm{km}$ transit to Site U1492 in DP mode.  

# Site U1492  

# Hole U1492A  

The ship arrived at Site U1492 (proposed Site MAF-15A) a t $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December 2016 after a $9\,\mathrm{km}$ transit from Site U1491 i n DP mode. Two replacement drill collars and a new APC/XCB oute r core barrel assembly were made up to replace those lost in Hol e U1491B. The rig mechanic worked on the blower motor in the to p drive for $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ before the remainder of the BHA was assembled. Th e pipe trip to the seafloor began at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December. The camera was deployed for a seafloor survey, and the target, a seep marke d by a previous ROV survey, was found immediately, so no furthe r survey was required. The ship was offset $200\textrm{m}$ to the north, an d coring in Hole U1492A $15^{\circ}42.6775^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{:}$ , $147^{\circ}10.6003^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; water dept h $=3657\;\mathrm{m})$ ) started at $0725\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 December, establishing a seafloo r depth of 3657 mbsl. After Core 366-U1492A-2H, further coring wa s conducted using the HLAPC for better recovery in the stiff serpentinite muds. While recovering 9F from 38.3 mbsf, the core lin e became snarled in the oil saver due to a kink above the rope socket, most likely caused by the high ship’s heave. At this point, we cease d coring in the hole, not far short of the 50 mbsf target depth, wit h $38.3~\mathrm{m}$ cored and $38.5~\mathrm{m}$ recovered. After slipping and cutting th e drilling line, the oil saver was cleared of the tangled core line and th e core line was reheaded.  

# Hole U1492B  

Hole U1492B $\mathrm{(15^{\circ}42.6216^{\prime}N}$ , $147^{\circ}10.6011^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; water depth $=3669$ m), started at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 December 2016, is located $100\;\mathrm{m}$ sout h of Hole U1492A and is the second in the minitransect of holes a t this site. The seafloor depth was 3669.1 mbsl, $12.5\;\mathrm{m}$ deeper than a t Hole U1492A. Coring continued using the HLAPC coring syste m through Core 366-U1492B-13F to 51.4 mbsf with $52.0\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered, completing the objective at this hole.  

# Hole U1492C  

At $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 December 2016, the ship was offset $^{120}\,\mathrm{m}$ sout h to start Hole U1492C $\langle15^{\circ}42.5590^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , $147^{\circ}10.6001^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; water depth $=$ $3666~\mathrm{m}]$ ) with a seafloor depth of 3666.5 mbsl. HLAPC coring continued through Core 366-U1492C-23F to 98.7 mbsf. Formatio n temperature measurements (APCT-3) were made during Cores 3F, 6F, 9F, 13F, 16F, 19F, and 22F (9.5, 23.5, 33.6, 51.7, 65.8, 73.9, an d 94.0 mbsf, respectively). Coring was suspended at this point to allo w deployment of the temperature dual-pressure tool (T2P) on the motion decoupled hydraulic delivery system (MDHDS). The hole wa s swept with 20 barrels of high-viscosity mud while the tools were being rigged up and prepared for deployment on the rig floor. Th e hole had been stable up to that point with no fill on connections o r overpull coming off bottom. It took less than $1\,\mathrm{~h~}$ to rig up th e MDHDS/T2P/Electrical Release System (ERS) tools, but while stabbing the logging line through the blocks (without rotation or circulation), the hole became unstable. The line was quickly pulled bac k out, and the driller fought to maintain rotation, with top driv e torque increasing from 200 to over $500\mathrm{~A~}$ . It was agreed that th e T2P deployment should be abandoned for this site and retried at  a shallower depth at the next summit drill site (U1496). The hole wa s swept with 20 barrels of high-viscosity drilling mud, and a wipe r trip was made to 70.6 mbsf to try and get some of the dense cutting s either out of the hole or below the bit so they could be ground to  a finer grain size and circulated out of the hole. Coring resumed a t $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 December. HLAPC Cores 24F through 28G were cu t to 117.5 mbsf before high torque and overpull necessitated a secon d wiper trip. The next $13.75\,\mathrm{h}$ were spent on hole conditioning befor e it was considered safe enough to install the sinker bars and recove r the XCB wash barrel, which contained ghost Core 28G (ghost core s come from an interval that has been previously penetrated). Corin g then proceeded using the XCB coring system to recover Cores 29 X through 30X to 129.4 mbsf. While cutting Core 31X at 139.1 mbsf, the driller once again lost rotation. The next $2.5\,\mathrm{h}$ were spent working to free the pipe; we then decided to abandon further attempts t o core Hole U1492C, and the drill pipe was pulled up to the rig floor. We cored $139.1\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $72.0\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1492C.  

# Hole U1492D  

At 0935 h on 24 December 2016, preparations began for deploying the reentry cone/drill-in casing system for Hole U1492 D $(15^{\circ}42.5694^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $147^{\circ}10.5991^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; water depth $=\;3666\mathrm{~m})$ ). The previously assembled standard reentry cone was moved over well cente r on the moonpool doors. The casing shoe joint and four 39 f t screened casing joints were assembled, followed by 13 additiona l 10.75 inch casing joints. The casing string was lowered and latche d into the reentry cone. The stinger assembly was made up, includin g a tricone bit, a Baker-Hughes Inteq high-torque mud motor, a set o f HOC underreamers, and the Dril-Quip (DQ) running tool. Th e motor/underreamer combo was tested in the moonpool for prope r operation. At $_{0630\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 25 December, the driller began lowering th e reentry cone/casing assembly to the seafloor. Several QA/QC issue s were identified during the making up of the casing and drilling assembly, including (1) an improperly machined thread on a casin g joint, (2) a ${\sim}0.020$ inch under gauge 16 inch casing hanger that prevented connection to the DQ running tool until $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ of grindin g work enabled them to fit together, (3) one of the other 16 inch casing hangers that was also found to be out of specification, and (4 ) the first set of HOC DTU950 underreamers that failed to open an d close properly during the predeployment test at the usual 30–3 5 strokes/min, requiring instead 80 strokes/min to open and a pressure in excess of 700 psi. This underreamer was set aside and another was picked up; it performed normally.  

Hole U1492D was started at $1620\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 December at a tagge d seafloor depth of $3666~\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , the same depth as for Hole U1492C. The drill-in casing method employed here used a mud motor t o power rotation of the bit and underreamer bit assembly, which projects ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ below the bottom of the casing. The casing is 10.75 inc h in diameter, the screened casing joints are 12.5 inch in diameter, an d the underreamer arms were set to create a 14.75 inch diameter hole. Drilling proceeded smoothly until a harder layer was encountere d at ${\sim}84$ mbsf, a similar depth to a hard (but unrecovered) layer encountered while coring in Hole U1492C. The bit caught on thi s layer, causing the drill pipe to torque up and then detorque in th e opposite direction when the bit was freed. On one such detorque, the pipe rotated enough to activate the casing running tool and release the reentry cone, and the reentry cone fell down the casin g string and onto the seafloor over the hole. Shortly after this, at 023 0 h on 26 December, the $211\,\textrm{m}$ long casing string also disengage d from the casing running tool and dropped about $3\,\mathrm{m}$ . We could still drill ahead, and we were able to reengage the casing and penetrat e to 93 mbsf. However, hole conditions remained poor, and it was decided to pull the casing back to the ship and inspect the casing an d drilling assemblies. On recovery, one cone was missing from th e underreamer, but other parts of the assemblies were in working order. The casing string was hung off in the moonpool forward of well center.  

Given the difficulties drilling into serpentinite mud containin g rock clasts in this hole, we decided on a different approach. We decided to first drill the hole without coring to 225 mbsf using a 14.7 5 inch bit and then reenter this hole and drill in the casing using th e mud motor and underreamer bit. At $1415\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 December, Hol e U1492D was reentered and reamed down to the previous total depth of 93 mbsf. From that point, it took $17\,\mathrm{h}$ to advance the 14.7 5 inch bit to the target depth of 225 mbsf ( $11\;\mathrm{m}$ deeper than casing t o provide an adequate amount of rathole). The drill bit was raised t o 67 mbsf then run back down to $225~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and the hole was swep t three times with high-viscosity mud to clean out cuttings prior t o pulling this bit out of the hole to prepare for our second attempt t o install casing.  

At $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 December, the rig crew moved the already assembled casing string back to the center of the moonpool, reassembled the mud motor and underreamer, and then lowered the casin g and drilling assembly to the seafloor. Hole U1492D was reentere d for the second time at $2300~\mathrm{h}$ . The casing was lowered to 54 mbs f before taking weight, and then drilling/washing with the underreamer continued slowly to 144 mbsf, where the casing becam e stuck. Freeing the casing took $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ . After further slow progress wa s halted at 184 mbsf by poor hole conditions, the bit was pulled bac k to 96 mbsf to free the casing. We resumed drilling it in and wer e able finally to drill all the way to the total target depth of 214 mbsf a t an average rate of $10\,\mathrm{m/h}_{\mathrm{m}}$ ; the casing shoe is at 211 mbsf. The casin g running tool was released at $2240\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . It was not possible to confir m that the latch ring on the casing hanger had fully engaged the reentry cone because clouds of cuttings and drilling mud obscured ou r camera images, but this lack of confirmation was not considered t o be a significant problem for the installation. The drill string wa s raised back to the ship and was on the rig floor by $0915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 January 2017.  

Three tasks remained to make the cased hole ready for a futur e deployment of borehole monitoring equipment: (1) clean the hol e of any accumulated debris, (2) install a bridge plug at its base, (3 ) and install an ROV landing platform. A drilling BHA was lowered t o the seafloor and reentered Hole U1492D to clean out any materia l that built up in the base of the casing. No obstructions were foun d to 211 mbsf, and a 30 barrel high-viscosity mud sweep made sur e the hole was clear. The BHA was raised back to the ship, the botto m part was exchanged to include the bridge plug deployment apparatus, and Hole U1492D was reentered. The bridge plug was to be se t near the base of the casing to prevent formation muds from comin g up into the casing. However, at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 January, while the pip e was hung off at the rotary for a pipe connection, the drill strin g jolted, suggesting that the drill string had become attached to th e casing. After completing the pipe connection, it was confirmed tha t the mechanical bridge plug had set prematurely at a depth of 3 7 mbsf. After an unsuccessful attempt to unseat the bridge plug, th e drill pipe was detached from it and raised back to the ship, wher e the bridge plug release tool was inspected. Nothing was found to b e wrong with the running tool. The prevailing theory is that durin g the pipe trip through the water column, the running tool settin g ring rotated the 10 required turns. Then, after reentry, when th e pipe was hung off on the elevator stool, the ship took a large heav e and the slips on the bridge plug hung up in the gap between casin g joints (opposite the coupling), which allowed the appropriat e amount of force to be applied, causing the slips on the bridge plug t o set. Because removal of the bridge plug required preparation time, we decided to move on to Site U1493 at the foot of Asùt Tesoru Seamount, and return to Site U1492 later in the expedition. The dril l string and positioning beacon were recovered, and the $136\ \mathrm{nmi}$ se a passage to Site U1493 began by $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 January.  

We arrived back at Hole U1492D at $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 January, after  a $50\;\mathrm{nmi}$ , $^{5\,\mathrm{h}}$ transit from Site U1497. Hole U1492D was reentered a t $0740\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 January with the purpose of hammering out the bridg e plug. The bridge plug was tagged at $40~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and it was hammere d using a custom-built tool over a period of $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$ before it gave way an d moved downhole. The pipe was lowered, and we relocated th e bridge plug at 211 mbsf, just below the base of casing. The RO V landing platform was deployed by freefall, landing very close to centered in the reentry cone. The base of casing was cemented with  5 barrels of $14~\mathrm{lb/g}$ cement. Cementing became the expedition’s preferred method of sealing the base of casing because of the risk of th e mechanical bridge plugs setting prematurely. The casing at Sit e U1492D is ready for future deployment of borehole monitoring instruments. The ship departed at $0200~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 January for the 14 4 nmi transit to Hole U1496C.  

# Site U1493  

# Hole U1493A  

The ship arrived at Site U1493 (proposed Site MAF-14A ; $17^{\circ}59.1668^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $147^{\circ}06.0057^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; water depth $=3359\mathrm{~m})$ ) at $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on  4 January 2017 following a $136\ \mathrm{nmi}$ , $13~\mathrm{{h}}$ transit from Site U1492.  A reentry cone was set up in the moonpool in preparation for its use a t Site U1496 at the summit of Asùt Tesoru Seamount, and the drill pipe was lowered through it. Sites U1493–U1496 form a ${\sim}14~\mathrm{km}$ south-to-north transect from the foot to the summit and are clos e enough for transit between them in DP mode, which allowed th e same drill string to be used without being raised back up to the ship. Owing to the time taken to deploy casing Hole U1492D, we scale d back the drilling plan for the Asùt Tesoru flank sites (U1493– U1495) to a single $50\mathrm{\;m\;APC/\;XCB}$ hole at each of these three sites. While taking the first core, the APC core barrel bent in two places. This core recovered $9\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ of mud with microfossils, and we decid e to offset a short distance to avoid the hard zone or rock that cause d the bent core barrel at this location.  

# Hole U1493B  

The ship was offset $^{10\textbf{m}}$ east, and we started Hole U1493 B $(17^{\circ}59.1665^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $147^{\circ}06.0060^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ water depth $=3359\;\mathrm{m}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ) at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on  4 January 2017. Coring in Hole U1493B penetrated to $32.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . A n APCT-3 measurement was made on Core 366-U1493B-5F at 24. 5 mbsf, obtaining a satisfactory temperature equilibration curve. Because of slow coring due to difficult APC/XCB drilling condition s and because we had sufficient samples for lithologic, geochemical, and microbiological assessment of the site, we decided to stop afte r Core 9X and move $4\,\mathrm{nmi}$ upslope to Site U1494. Hole U1493B penetrated $32.6~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $19.0\ \mathrm{m}$ $(58\%)$ . The transit started a t $1615\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 January in DP mode.  

# Site U1494  

# Hole U1494A  

The ship arrived at Site U1494 at $2050\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 January 2017 afte r at $4\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1493 in DP mode. The first core at Hol e U1494A $18^{\circ}03.00896^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $147^{\circ}06.0003^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; water depth $=2200\;\mathrm{m}$ ) wa s taken at $2325\,\mathrm{h},$ , and HLAPC and XCB coring became progressivel y more difficult with depth. After Core 366-U1494-11X took $^{2\mathrm{~h~}}$ t o drill, we decided end the hole and move on to Site U1495. Hol e U1494A penetrated $39.0~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $29.6\mathrm{~m~}(76\%)$ . The shor t transit to Site U1495 started at $2135\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 January.  

# Site U1495  

# Hole U1495A  

The ship arrived at Site U1495 at $0115~\mathrm{h}$ on 7 January 2017. I t quickly became apparent that the hole was unstable for drilling, an d after each HLAPC core an XCB barrel was deployed and the bi t drilled down to the depth of the previous HLAPC core. These XC B hole cleaning runs recovered two ghost cores containing mostl y rock clasts. Elevated levels of hydrogen were found in Core 366- U1495A-2F, so we decided to core a second hole at this site to increase the number of microbiological and interstitial water sample s across this interval. Hole U1495A ( $18^{\circ}05.6693^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $147^{\circ}06.0004^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ water depth $=\;1406\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ) penetrated $10.7\,\textrm{m}$ and recovered $5.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(76\%)$ .  

# Hole U1495B  

The vessel was offset $25\,\mathrm{~m~}$ northwest, and Hole U1495 B $\mathrm{[18^{\circ}05.6788^{\prime}N}$ , $147^{\circ}05.9901^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; water depth $=1402\;\mathrm{m}$ ) was started a t $1320~\mathrm{h}$ . The water depth here was 1403 mbsl, $^{3\textrm{m}}$ shallower tha n Hole U1495A. Coring continued with the HLAPC coring system t o a total depth of 10.8 mbsf. Once again, hole cleaning and a slow rat e of penetration drilling out the HLAPC rathole led us to stop corin g this hole. Hole U1495B penetrated $10.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $10.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(100\%)$ . The transit to Site U1496 in DP mode began at $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Site U1496  

# Hole U1496A  

Coring at Hole U1496A (proposed Site MAF-11A; $18^{\circ}6.5936^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $147^{\circ}6.0999^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; water depth $=1244\;\mathrm{m})$ began at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 Januar y 2017 after a 1 nmi transit from Site U1495. We started with HLAP C coring and switched to XCB coring after Core 366-U1496A-9F di d not achieve a full stroke. Penetration rate slowed, and after reachin g 44.8 mbsf, we ended the hole. Hole U1496A penetrated to 44.8 mbs f and recovered $38.7\;\mathrm{m}\;(86\%)$ .  

# Hole U1496B  

Hole  U1496B $(18^{\circ}6.6210^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{{:}}}$ , $147^{\circ}6.1000^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ;  water  depth $=$ $1240\;\mathrm{m}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ) was started $50\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1496A at $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 January 2017. Coring proceeded well until a clast-rich zone starting a t about 28 mbsf slowed coring. To try to pass through the zone, w e took XCB Core 366-U1496B-8X, then drilled ahead to $34.3\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ and took Core 10F, which contained only rock clasts, so we ende d the hole at this point. Hole U1496A penetrated to 36.0 mbsf and recovered 22.9 m $(64\%)$ . To reach the target depth of abou t 110 mbsf at this site, we pulled the drill pipe back up to the ship t o switch to RCB coring in a new hole.  

# Hole U1496C  

Hole  U1496C $\langle18^{\circ}6.6074^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $147^{\circ}6.1000^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ;  water  depth $=$ $1244\;\mathrm{m})$ ) started at $2320~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 January 2017 at a location midwa y between the first two holes at the site. Coring progressed quickly, penetrated $105\,\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , and recovered $8.52\;\mathrm{m}\left(8\%\right)$ . The low levels of cor e recovery were anticipated for rotary coring in this material, and th e coring did its intended job of reaching 105 mbsf, the depth to whic h casing would be emplaced in the hole. The hole was swept an d reamed, the reentry cone was deployed, and the drill pipe was raise d back to the ship. To further prepare the hole for casing, it was reentered at $2340\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 January with a 14.75 inch bit and was widene d by drilling and reaming to 120 mbsf. The drill pipe was raised up t o the drill floor, and the $105\;\mathrm{m}$ long casing was assembled.  

The casing for Hole U1496C consisted of two regular 10.75 inc h casing joints, three screened casing joints, and three further regula r casing joints connected to a 16 inch casing hanger at the top. Th e underreamer and mud motor BHA was assembled and lowere d through the casing, and the running tool on the BHA was attache d to the casing hanger on the casing. The bit extended about $4\;\mathrm{m}$ below the base of casing. The casing and bit/underreamer assembl y reentered Hole U1496C at $_{0130\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 12 January and reached th e target depth of 109 mbsf at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ . Progress was fairly rapid, apar t from taking a few hours to pass through a hard zone at ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ . The casing was latched to the reentry cone, and the bit/underreamer assembly was pulled inside the casing. The ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{m}$ diamete r circular ROV platform was deployed and landed slightly off-cente r by about $30\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ , but it is still functional. Hard fill was found in th e casing at 99 mbsf, indicating that formation material had come u p about $6\,\mathrm{m}$ inside the casing. The drill pipe was raised up to the ship, and the rig floor was secured for transit to Site U1497.  

We returned to Hole U1496C on 21 January at $1525\,\mathrm{h}$ after a 14 4 nmi, $13.4~\mathrm{h}$ transit from Hole U1492D. The aim was to take a wate r sample using the WSTP, remove the fill, and cement the bottom o f the casing. The drill pipe was lowered to the seafloor and reentere d Hole U1496C without difficulty, despite having to pass through th e 32 inch diameter central aperture in the ROV landing platform. Th e drill pipe was lowered to 42 mbsf, within the upper joint of screene d casing, where the WSTP was deployed to sample borehole fluid s and take temperature measurements. Initial geochemical measurements of the ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{L}$ WSTP fluid sample indicate that it is mostly formation water, mixed with some drilling water (seawater). We used  a 9.825 inch polycrystalline diamond (PDC) coring bit because it wa s narrow enough to fit inside the casing. The drill pipe was lowered, and we found fill at 99 mbsf, ${\sim}7\;\mathrm{m}$ above the base of casing, a simila r depth to where it was when the casing was installed on 12 January. We sampled the material inside the casing with Cores 366-U1496C12G and 13G, which recovered $7.7~\mathrm{m}$ serpentinite mud with lithi c clasts from this previously cored depth interval. Five barrels of 1 4 $\;|\mathbf{b}/\mathbf{g}$ cement were pumped with the aim of sealing the base of casing. The drill pipe was raised above the seafloor, flushed to remove an y residual cement, and then raised back to the ship, concluding operations at Site U1496.  

# Site U1497  

# Hole U1497A  

The $94\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1497 (proposed site MAF-9B) too k $^{9\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ at $10.4\,\mathrm{kt}$ . Site U1497 is located near the summit of Fantangisñ a Seamount and is known from previous ROV dives to have more surface boulders and cobbles than the other two seamounts drille d during this expedition. Prior to starting the hole, we surveyed th e seafloor with the subsea camera to find preferred coring location s with  fewer  surface  rocks.  Hole  U1497A $\langle16^{\circ}32.2538^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $147^{\circ}13.2641^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ water depth $=2020\ \mathrm{m})$ began at $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 January 2017 and reached 34.2 mbsf using a combination of HLAPC an d XCB coring. After each HLAPC core, we reamed/drilled down t o the base of advancement of the previous HLAPC core, during whic h we recovered additional core material (ghost cores). Hole U1497 A cored $34.2\:\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $23.4\:\mathrm{m}\:(70\%)$ .  

# Hole U1497B  

Hole U1497B $\langle16^{\circ}32.2528^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $147^{\circ}13.2606^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; water depth $=2019$ m) started at $1530~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 January 2017; it reached 25.1 mbsf an d recovered $23.8\;\mathrm{m}\;(95\%)$ . It was decided to stop the hole at this poin t because of difficult drilling, and the bit was raised clear of the seafloor at $0005\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 January.  

# Hole U1497C  

Hole U1497C ( $16^{\circ}32.2504^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $147^{\circ}13.2500^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; water depth $=2019$ m) started at $1145\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 January 2017 with the aim to drill dow n with a 14.75 inch bit to about 120 mbsf and then deploy screene d casing in this predrilled hole for future borehole monitoring at thi s site. However, we stopped this hole at 12 mbsf because of hig h torque and slow penetration.  

# Hole U1497D  

For a second attempt to drill a 14.75 inch hole to 120 mbsf, w e started Hole U1497D $\mathrm{[16^{\circ}32.2548^{\prime}N}$ , $147^{\circ}13.2621^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ water depth $=$ $2020\;\mathrm{m}$ ) $5\;\mathrm{m}$ north of where Hole U1497B had achieved reasonabl e penetration. Hole U1497D reached 120 mbsf at a slow but stead y average rate of $7\,\mathrm{m/h}$ . The formation was firm, and the hole appeared to be in good condition, apart from a difficult zone in th e upper part of the hole, perhaps related to loose sand and gravel observed in Hole U1497A between 23–26 mbsf. The hole was swep t with 50 barrels of high-viscosity mud to prepare for installing th e screened casing. The reentry cone was deployed by freefall, an d then the drill pipe was raised back up to the ship.  

The rig crew assembled the $106\;\mathrm{m}$ long casing string, includin g three joints of 10.75 inch casing, three joints of screened casing, an d three further joints of 10.75 inch casing. The regular casing joint s underneath the screened section provided space for cement to sea l the bottom of the casing to prevent the formation from entering. The mud motor and underreamer assembly was lowered throug h the casing string, and the running tool on the drill pipe was attache d to the hanger at the top of the casing. The bit and underreamer extended ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{m}$ below the base of the casing. The whole assembly wa s lowered to the seafloor, and Hole U1497D was reentered at $2310\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 January 2017. At $1230~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 January, the casing had bee n successfully installed to 107 mbsf in Hole U1497D. During the installation, it took ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{h}$ to pass below a difficult zone at ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m}$ . The n at ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{mbsf},$ the casing prereleased from the running tool, fallin g $\mathord{\sim}15\;\mathrm{m}$ farther down the hole (a similar prerelease happened at Hol e U1492D earlier in the expedition), but we were able to continu e washing and reaming down to the target depth. The hole was swep t with high-viscosity mud, and the drill pipe and underreamer assembly was raised back up to the ship.  

The cementing BHA reentered Hole U1497D and was lowere d to $105\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , where 5 barrels of $14\,|\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{g}$ cement was pumped down t o seal the bottom of the casing at that depth. The drill pipe was raise d above the seafloor, and the drill pipe was flushed to remove any residual cement. The bit was at the rig floor at $1540\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 January, and the ship prepared for transit. The positioning beacon would no t release from the seafloor, but we planned to return to Hole U1497 D to check the location of the cement plug later in the expedition an d to try to retrieve the beacon using a grapple hook.  

We returned to Hole U1497D at $2045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 January after a 9 5 nmi, $^{9\mathrm{~h~}}$ transit. Hole U1497D was reentered at $0325\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January, and the drill pipe was lowered to $24~\mathrm{mbsf},$ in the middle of th e top joint of screened casing, where the WSTP was deployed to sample borehole fluids and take temperature measurements. The dril l pipe was lowered further to check the location of the cement plug, now that it had time to harden. The top of cement was tagged at 10 3 mbsf, about $4~\mathrm{m}$ above the base of the casing. The cement plug i s therefore well positioned to stop the formation entering into th e casing. The ROV landing platform was deployed by freefall. On ou r previous visit to Site U1497, the beacon failed to release, so we no w fished it manually using a grappling hook that had been attached t o the subsea camera frame for this purpose. This concluded operations at Site U1497.  

# Site U1498  

# Hole U1498A  

The ship transited 6 nmi in DP mode to Site U1498 (propose d Site MAF-10B) in $^{9\mathrm{\,h}}$ from the Fantangis?ñ a Seamount summit, arriving at $2300\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . We had moved the location of Hole U1498 A $\left\langle{16^{\circ}27.0898^{\prime}}\mathrm{N}\right\rangle$ , $147^{\circ}09.8502^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; water depth $=\;3497\;\mathrm{~m~}\!$ ) ${\sim}1300\;\mathrm{m}$ southwest (downslope) from the planned location to the toe of th e slope where the serpentinite mud flows are thinner and where drilling could reach the underlying sediments more easily/quickly in th e remaining operation time. An RCB coring assembly was lowere d and tagged the seafloor at 3497 mbsl at $0615~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 January. Th e steep $(\sim\!25\%)$ slopes at the foot of the mud volcano cause underestimated seafloor depths when calculated from PDR or the seismi c seafloor reflection, and the bathymetric data for the site locatio n proved to be more accurate. Cores 366-U1498A-1R through 19 R penetrated $182\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $21\textrm{m}(11\%)$ . Coring was faster below 45 mbsf, in the nannofossil-bearing volcanic ashes that underli e the serpentinite mudflows. Following low recovery, we ended Hol e U1498A at 182 mbsf and moved ${\sim}700\,\mathrm{~m~}$ northeast, upslope, to  a location where the serpentinite mud flows are thicker.  

# Hole U1498B  

At $0300\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 26 January 2017, the seafloor at Hole U1498 B $\langle16^{\circ}27.3716^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{{:}}}$ , $147^{\circ}10.1166^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; water depth $\,=\,3285\,\mathrm{~m~})$ was tagge d with the drill pipe, and the tag was observed with the subsea camer a to confirm the water depth and check seafloor conditions on th e lower slope of Fantangisña Seamount. Seafloor depth from th e bathymetry was within $1\;\mathrm{m}$ of the tagged seafloor depth at this hole. Cores 366-U1498B-1R through 27R penetrated $260\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $^{83}\textrm{m}$ $(32\%)$ . In the upper five cores, the RCB coring syste m preferentially recovered hard rock clasts, and below this depth, recovery of serpentinite muds increased with depth. Drilling was slo w until we drilled through to the underlying sediments in the middl e of Core 23R at 205 mbsf. We stopped drilling when the hole reache d 260 mbsf, and the last core of the expedition came on deck at $1730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 January. Enough operation time remained for downhole logging, so the drill bit was raised up to 52 mbsf, and we logged th e hole with the triple combo tool string, comprising magnetic susceptibility, NGR, resistivity, and caliper tools. The tool string reache d 229 mbsf, $31\textrm{m}$ from the base of the hole. Magnetic susceptibility, NGR, resistivity, and temperature data were recorded for on e downward pass and two upward passes of the tool string. The logging data cover the transition from the sediments to the overlyin g serpentinite mudflows and up to the base of the drill pipe. The tool s were rigged down by $0530~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January, and the drill pipe wa s raised back to the ship by $1250\,\mathrm{h}$ . The rig was secured, and the transit to Hong Kong began at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January.  

# Transit to Hong Kong port call  

The 1917 nmi transit to Hong Kong took 7.8 days at an averag e speed of 10.3 knots. We proceeded to Hong Kong East Lamm a Channel pilot station for a timed arrival for the scheduled pilo t boarding time of $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 February 2017.  

# Education and outreach  

Two education and outreach personnel participated on Expedition 366. Many of their interactions with students were in the for m of live video broadcasts, YouTube videos, blogs, and Faceboo k posts. About 40 live video broadcasts with classrooms were conducted, reaching an estimated 1500 students and teachers. Surve y responses from participants indicated that they found the objective s of the expedition clearly explained; they learned about science content, process, and careers; presentations were presented at the appropriate level for the audience; and programs exceeded thei r expectations. Respondents also indicated that the programs helped them to meet their relevant state and local education standards. Based on additional written comments and thank-you notes from teachers, these broadcasts had a positive impact on the students. Several teachers mentioned that they used the YouTube video series prior to these broadcasts to introduce students to the scientific goals of the expedition.  

Two series of short YouTube videos were produced. One series showcased research conducted by individual scientists or teams of scientists (Science Spotlights). The other series was a personal take on life on board the JOIDES Resolution, highlighting holiday activities, different parts of the ship, and other updates (Video Diaries). All videos were aimed at increasing ocean science understanding and awareness, particularly among middle school and college students, and secondarily among the broader audience that follows JOIDES Resolution via the website or social media. Twelve videos were completed, with a total of 1945 views prior to departing the ship. These videos will continue to be available indefinitely as a resource through USSSP’s YouTube channel.  

The education and outreach team also published 45 blogs to the JOIDES Resolution website, with a total of 5806 reads prior to departing from the ship (ranging from 160 to 1025 reads per blog). These blogs cover everything from science activities to the ship, shipboard life, weather, and a range of topics of interest to the general public. The public provided many comments to these blogs.  

In addition to these media connections, the education and outreach team created two focused projects. One included the creation of a 3-D model of a serpentinite mud volcano made to scale, including an accurate representation of the layers beneath the volcano. It was used for live broadcasts and will be used in a German school by one of the education and outreach team members.  

The second project was centered on a small 360 camera. The camera was placed in various spaces around the ship to record research activity. Some of the 360 videos and photos were posted to Facebook and received positive feedback and engagement. Although it was difficult to incorporate 360 video into other video projects and live broadcasts, due to technological constraints, the concept has broad appeal. We hope IODP will continue to integrate this technology into future outreach efforts. The TAMU-based computer specialists will look into possible technical applications for future outreach activities.  

Education and outreach activities will continue ashore. Both team members plan on submitting articles for publication and expanding current blogs to connect deep-sea scientific drilling to other aspects of marine science. Lastly, both team members will participate in a workshop. The German team member will participate in IODP Expedition at Geo-Show in Braunschweig on 15 March 2017, held simultaneously with the 2017 ICDP/IODP Symposium in Germany. The US Outreach Officer will participate in USSSP’s booth and teacher outreach activities at the National Science Teachers Association annual conference in Los Angeles on 29 March–2 April 2017.

Figure F15. Magnetic susceptibility and magnetic intensity of the uppermost $40\;\mathsf{m}$ after $20~\mathsf{m T}$ AF demagnetization, Expedition 366. All sites are include d except Site U1495, which penetrated to only ${\sim}10$ mbsf. High magnetic intensity relative to magnetic susceptibility in some cores and holes is likely due to dril l string overprint. Asùt Tesoru holes have a higher average susceptibility than the other mud volcanoes
