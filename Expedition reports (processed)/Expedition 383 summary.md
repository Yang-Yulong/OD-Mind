# Abstract  

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), the world’s strongest zonal current system, connects all three major ocean basins o f the global ocean and therefore integrates and responds to global climate variability. Its flow is largely driven by strong westerly wind s and is constricted to its narrowest extent in the Drake Passage. Fresh and cold Pacific surface and intermediate water flowin g through the Drake Passage (cold-water route) and warm India n Ocean water masses flowing through the Agulhas region (warmwater route) are critical for the South Atlantic contribution to Meridional Overturning Circulation changes. Furthermore, physica l and  biological  processes  associated  with  the  ACC  affect  th e strength of the ocean carbon pump and therefore are critical t o feedbacks linking atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentrations, ocean circulation, and climate/cryosphere on a global scale. In contrast to the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the ACC, and with the exception of dril l cores from the Antarctic continental margin and off New Zealand, there are no deep-sea drilling paleoceanographic records from th e Pacific sector of the ACC. To advance our understanding of Miocene to Holocene atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere dynamics in th e Pacific and their implications for regional and global climate and atmospheric $C O_{2},$ , International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 383 recovered sedimentary sequences at (1) three sites in th e central South Pacific (CSP) (U1539, U1540, and U1541), (2) tw o sites at the Chilean margin (U1542 and U1544), and (3) one sit e from the pelagic eastern South Pacific (U1543) close to the entranc e to the Drake Passage. Because of persistently stormy conditions an d the resulting bad weather avoidance, we were not successful in recovering the originally planned Proposed Site CSP-3A in the Pola r Frontal Zone of the CSP. The drilled sediments at Sites U1541 an d U1543 reach back to the late Miocene, and those at Site U154 0 reach back to the early Pliocene. High sedimentation rate sequence s reaching back to the early Pleistocene (Site U1539) and the lat e Pleistocene (Sites U1542 and U1544) were recovered in both th e CSP and at the Chilean margin. Taken together, the sites represent  a depth transect from ${\sim}1100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ at Chilean margin Site U1542 t o ${\sim}4070\mathrm{~m~}$ at CSP Site U1539 and allow investigation of changes i n the vertical structure of the ACC, a key issue for understanding th e role of the Southern Ocean in the global carbon cycle. The sites ar e located at latitudes and water depths where sediments will allow th e application of a wide range of siliciclastic-, carbonate-, and opalbased proxies to address our objectives of reconstructing, with unprecedented stratigraphic detail, surface to deep-ocean variation s and their relation to atmosphere and cryosphere changes.  

# Introduction  

Our prior knowledge of southern high latitude paleoceanography comes from conventional sediment coring and Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP)/Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drilling in th e Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Antarctic Circumpolar Curren t (ACC). A prominent example is ODP Leg 177, which drilled site s along a north–south transect across the major ACC fronts and documented the Cenozoic history of the Atlantic sector of the Souther n Ocean. These sites revealed, for example, linked changes in dus t supply, marine productivity, and biological nutrient consumptio n (Martínez-Garcia et al., 2009, 2011, 2014), opposing changes in productivity in the Antarctic compared to the Subantarctic Zone o n glacial–interglacial cycles (Jaccard et al., 2013) and in the AC C compared to the Antarctic margin on longer timescales (Cortese e t al., 2004), marked steps in sea-surface temperature (SST) evolutio n since the Pliocene (Martínez-García et al., 2010), and Antarctic Ic e Sheet (AIS) dynamics during the late Quaternary (Kanfoush et al., 2002; Teitler et al., 2010, 2015; Venz and Hodell, 2002; Hayes et al., 2014).  

In contrast, studies of the Pacific sector of the ACC have bee n limited mainly to regions close to the Antarctic continental margi n south of the ACC (e.g., Ross Sea during DSDP Leg 28 and Antarcti c Peninsula during ODP Leg 178). Integrated Ocean Discovery Program Leg 318 drilled Cenozoic sediments off Wilkes Land (easter n Indian Southern Ocean) and revealed significant vulnerability of th e East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) to Pliocene warming (Cook et al., 2013; Expedition 318 Scientists, 2010). A substantial advance i n constraining the history and stability of the West Antarctic Ic e Sheet (WAIS) and Ross Ice Shelf came from the Antarctic Geological Drilling (ANDRILL) project (e.g., Naish et al., 2009; Florindo e t al. 2008), which documented ice sheets that were expanded and stable between 13 and $11\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and more dynamic in the late Miocene– late Pliocene $(10{-}2.5\,\mathrm{\Ma})$ with cyclic expansion of grounded ic e sheets over the coring site after $2.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

These on- and near-shore drilling programs have significantl y advanced our understanding of AIS dynamics during the Cenozoic. However, to understand how these ice sheet changes are ultimatel y linked to climate, atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ levels, and ocean circulation requires constraints on the strength, latitudinal extent, and overall nature of the ACC (i.e., the current system that connects Antarctica t o the rest of the globe). In this context, the results of Expedition 38 3 in the Pacific ACC will be closely linked to the recently complete d International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions to th e Ross Sea (Expedition 374), Amundsen Sea (Expedition 379), an d Scotia Sea (Expedition 382). These expeditions targeted Antarcti c near-shore records, which will likely be incomplete due to glacia l erosion, and the potential for analyses of paleoceanographic proxie s may be limited. Therefore, Expedition 383, Dynamics of the Pacifi c Antarctic Circumpolar Current (DYNAPACC), pelagic sites wer e selected to provide critical paleoceanographic baseline information, including rates of change, for improving the understanding of reconstructed AIS changes and testing ice sheet models.  

# Background  

The ACC, the world’s largest current system, connects all thre e major basins of the global ocean (i.e., the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans; Figure F1) and therefore integrates and responds t o climate signals throughout the globe (e.g., Talley, 2013). Throug h deep mixing, upwelling, and water mass formation, the ACC is fundamentally tied to the global Meridional Overturning Circulatio n (MOC; Marshall and Speer, 2012) and the stability of Antarctica’ s ice sheets.  

The ACC has long been recognized as a key player in regulatin g atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ variations and therefore global climate based o n the tight coupling between Southern Hemisphere temperatures an d atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentrations observed in Antarctic ice core s (e.g., Parrenin et al., 2013). Strong, zonally symmetric westerl y winds drive a northward Ekman component of flow that promote s ventilation of deep water, which provides a direct hydrographic lin k between the large deep-ocean reservoir of dissolved inorganic carbon and the surface ocean (e.g., Kuhlbrodt et al., 2007; Marshall an d Speer, 2012). The ACC therefore acts as a window through whic h the interior ocean and atmosphere interact and as a key player i n regulating atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ variations and therefore global climate.  

Biological utilization of nutrients in the Southern Ocean is particularly important in relation to changes in atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration because it regulates the preformed nutrient inventory fo r most of the deep ocean and therefore the global average efficienc y of the biological pump (e.g., Sigman and Boyle, 2000; Sigman et al., 2010). Nutrient utilization is inefficient in the Southern Ocean today in part because phytoplankton growth is limited by the scarcit y of bioavailable iron (e.g., de Baar et al., 1995). Martin (1990) proposed that dust-borne iron fertilization of Southern Ocean phytoplankton  caused  the  ice  age  reduction  in  atmospheric $C O_{2}$ . However, the role of iron in explaining variations in opal export t o the Southern Ocean sediments is complex. Chase et al. (2015) foun d a significant correlation between annual average net primary production and modeled dust deposition but not between dust deposition and opal burial. On glacial–interglacial timescales, prox y records from the Subantarctic region support a positive relationshi p between dust flux and opal production (e.g., Chase et al., 2003; Bradtmiller et al., 2009; Lamy et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 1995; Anderson et al., 2014). The opposite is true south of the Antarctic Pola r Front (APF) (e.g., Chase et al., 2003; Jaccard et al., 2013), indicatin g that factors other than dust regulate the production and export o f opal in the Southern Ocean and, by association, the strength an d efficiency of the biological carbon pump. Leading candidates fo r these other factors include changes related to shifts in the hydrographic fronts, the flow of the ACC, the spatial and temporal variability of wind-driven upwelling that supplies nutrients and $C O_{2}$ t o surface waters, and sea ice extent.  

# Oceanographic setting  

Expedition 383 drilled sites located in the ACC system in th e central South Pacific (CSP), the eastern South Pacific (ESP) and a t the southern Chilean margin close to the Drake Passage. The flow o f the ACC is largely driven by Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) an d is constricted to its narrowest extent in the Drake Passage. This socalled “cold-water route” through the Drake Passage is one important pathway for the return of fresh and cold waters from the Pacifi c to the Atlantic, which strongly affects the strength of the Atlanti c MOC (AMOC), in concert with the “warm-water route” inflow o f warm and salty Indian Ocean water masses through the Agulha s Current system (Beal et al., 2011; Gordon, 1986). The Drake Passag e is ${\sim}800\,\mathrm{km}$ wide, and it is located between Cape Horn and the western Antarctic Peninsula (Figure F1). Numerous hydrographic surveys across the Drake Passage since the 1970s have contributed t o the understanding of seasonal and interannual variability in AC C transport through the Drake Passage and the mechanisms forcin g physical and biological changes in the Southern Ocean (e.g., Meredith et al., 2011). Despite the insight gained from model simulation s (e.g., Meijers, 2014) and from hydrographic time series reachin g back $20\,\mathrm{y}$ (Koenig et al., 2014) in this relatively well constrained region of the ACC, important issues such as the role of zonal winds i n forcing ACC transport remain controversial (Watson et al., 2015).

![](images/623b984acab68145f3f94126ccd24b1d99a0468b5cec43ed2ee0eba975d3e7e7.jpg)  

The total ACC flow transported through the Drake Passage i s estimated to be between ${\sim}130$ and $150\,\mathrm{Sv}$ (Koenig et al., 2014; Meredith et al., 2011; Renault et al., 2011). Three major ACC oceanographic fronts (Orsi et al., 1995), the Subantarctic Front (SAF), th e APF, and the Southern ACC Front (SACCF), occur from north t o south in the Drake Passage. The modern winter sea ice (WSI) margin does not extend significantly north into the Drake Passage. Oceanographic studies show that more than half of the total Drak e Passage transport occurs at and north of the SAF (i.e., in the Subantarctic Zone), with the majority of the remaining transport in the Polar Frontal Zone (between the SAF and the APF) (Donohue et al., 2016). The relative contribution of Drake Passage transport south o f the APF is generally ${<}20\%$ .  

At slightly lower latitudes along the southernmost Chilean margin, the southward flowing Cape Horn Current (CHC), a norther n branch of the ACC that continues toward the Drake Passage, provides a major fraction of the present day northern Drake Passag e transport (Well et al., 2003). Satellite-tracked surface drifters revea l that after crossing the East Pacific Rise (EPR), Subantarctic surfac e water of the ACC is transported northeastward across the ESP toward the Chilean coast at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , $75^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005). Subsequently, only a minor fraction of the ACC is deflecte d northward into the Humboldt Current System (HCS), whereas th e major fraction is deviated southward toward the Drake Passag e within the CHC. The CHC thus transports a significant amount o f northern ACC water toward the Drake Passage in a narrow bel t ${\sim}100{-}150\ \mathrm{km}$ wide off the coast (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005 ) (Figure F2).  

The CSP drill sites are located at Subantarctic latitudes betwee n $56^{\circ}$ and $50^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . Sites U1539 and U1540 are located east of the EPR, whereas Site U1541 lies west of the EPR. Unfortunately, the originally proposed drill site south of the APF could not be reache d during Expedition 383 because of persistent bad weather conditions. The drilled sites (U1539–U1541) lie in the pathway of th e Subantarctic Pacific ACC, 100–170 nmi north of the modern mea n position of the SAF in a zonal transition zone of the ACC. Thes e ACC fronts form the core of the ACC and are partly constrained b y the bathymetry of the EPR in this area. As a result of seafloor topography, frontal positions in the ACC close to large bathymetric features remain relatively stable at seasonal and interannual timescale, whereas over abyssal plains their location appears to be fairly unstable (Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009). The SAF at the western and easter n flank of the EPR, where our sites are located, is therefore partly constrained by topography and the location of major fracture zone s (e.g., Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zone). Interannual and decadal oceanographic conditions in the South Pacific are influenced by th e Southern Annular Mode, by the Amundsen Sea Low, and by tropical variability and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (Thompson e t al., 2011; Turner et al., 2009; Yuan, 2004). At these timescales, SS T and sea ice changes are amplified in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean; for example, observations of trends from 1979–2011 indicate a distinct increase in sea ice north of the Ross Sea embaymen t

and a strong sea ice decrease in the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Se a (Maksym et al., 2012; Stammerjohn et al., 2012).  

A portion of the deep water that upwells south of the APF becomes Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) close to the Antarcti c margin, while Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) and Mod e Water is derived from the same deep water mass north of the AP F (e.g., Sloyan and Rintoul, 2001; Talley, 2013). The Southeast Pacifi c is known as the major AAIW formation area where fresh, cold, high-oxygen and low-nutrient waters are formed. Originally, it wa s thought that AAIW originates from the subduction of Antarcti c surface waters below the SAF (e.g., Deacon, 1937). Later, it was suggested that the formation of AAIW is directly linked to the formation of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) (McCartney, 1977), which has similar properties in the Southeast Pacific. More recen t studies confirm AAIW formation occurs primarily in the ESP and i s related to deep mixed-layer development leading to SAMW formation and finally to AAIW formation (Bostock et al., 2013). Th e Southern Ocean’s major water mass, the Circumpolar Deep Wate r (CDW), is divided into upper and lower branches. Lower CD W (LCDW) is identified by a salinity maximum inherited from Nort h Atlantic Deep Water (Reid and Lynn, 1971; Orsi et al., 1995). Uppe r CDW (UCDW) is typically identified as an oxygen-minimum laye r derived from oxygen-depleted, nutrient-rich Indian Deep Wate r and North Pacific Deep Water (Callahan, 1972). LCDW an d UCDW are transported into the North Pacific, where they ar e transformed into NPDW, and return to the Southern Ocean in th e East Pacific along the South American continent at $1500{-}3500\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth (Kawabe and Fujio, 2010). North of the SAF, UCDW i s centered at ${\sim}1500\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth and LCDW covers water depth s below $2000\ \mathrm{m}$ . Below LCDW, northward-spreading dense AAB W formed in the Weddell and Ross Seas and along the Adélie Coas t covers the abyss around Antarctica. In the South Pacific, the expansion of Ross Sea Bottom Water, the coldest and saltiest variety o f AABW, is restricted by bottom topography to areas south of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (Orsi et al., 1995). Miocene to recent Site s U1539–U1541 and U1543 are currently bathed by LCDW, and Chilean continental margin Sites U1542 and U1544 are currently bathe d by AAIW and a mixture of CDW and NPDW, respectively.

# Geological setting  

The drill sites in the CSP are located on oceanic crust near th e EPR. Site U1541 is located ${\sim}160~\mathrm{nmi}$ west of the crest of the EPR, north of the Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zone. The basement age (Figure F3) (Eagles, 2006) at this location is about $10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (late Miocene). Sites U1539 and U1540 are located at a similar distance to the fracture zone but ${\sim}210\ \mathrm{nmi}$ east of the EPR crest on slightly older crus t with a middle Miocene basement age of ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

One of the ESP drill sites (U1543) is located west of the Chil e Trench on a topographically elevated ridge ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above th e trench axis ( ${\sim}4200\,\mathrm{m}$ water depth). The basement at this location i s oceanic crust older than ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Eagles, 2006). The other two ES P drill sites (U1542 and U1544) are located at the Chilean margin o n continental crust. The southern Chilean margin is characterized b y a complex geodynamic setting with oblique convergence betwee n plates, transcurrent motion, and tectonic rotation on land (Poloni a et al., 2007). This portion of the South American margin is influenced by the relative movements between three main plates (Antarctica,  Scotia,  and  South  America),  resulting  in  a  stron g segmentation of the southern Chilean margin, which is clearly visible in bathymetric and multichannel seismic (MCS) data (Polonia e t al., 2007). Two major fore-arc basins at ${\sim}53^{\circ}{-}54.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ and $55^{\circ}{-}56.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ are characterized by thick sediment infill of as much as $\sim\!3\;\mathrm{km}$ (Figure F4). We drilled one site in the southern fore-arc basin (U1544), where Seismic Line IT97-171 (Figure F4) documents $\sim\!3\;\mathrm{km}$ of remarkably undeformed sediments (Polonia et al., 2007). This southern basin most likely formed after ridge subduction $(14{-}10\ \mathrm{Ma})$ when convergence resumed, contributing to the construction of th e outer bathymetric high that provided the barrier for the accumulation of continent-derived sediments (Figure F4).

1. Hypothesis H1: ACC dynamics and Drake Passage throughflow conditioned the global MOC and high–low climate linkages on orbital and submillennial timescales since the Pliocene.  

North of ${\sim}53^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , subduction in the Chile Trench is more orthogonal. Here, the transition between the undeformed Antarctic abyssal plain and the lower slope is very abrupt and results in a stee p slope incised by canyons that run perpendicular to the trench axis. Recent sediment cover is minor at the lower slope, but a small-scal e sediment depocenter occurs at the upper continental slope near th e western entrance to the Strait of Magellan. Site U1542 is located a t this sediment drift, which contains a sediment sequence as thick a s ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ that most likely does not extend beyond the early Pleistocene because of high sedimentation rates.  

# Scientific objectives  

The overall goal of Expedition 383 is to improve our knowledg e of late Miocene to recent atmosphere-ocean dynamics of the AC C in the Pacific and their implications for regional and global climat e and atmospheric $C O_{2}$ using sediment records with the highest possible resolution. The sites (Table T1; Figure F1) are located at latitudes and water depths where sediments will allow the applicatio n of a wide range of siliciclastic-, carbonate-, and opal-based proxie s for reconstructing surface to deep-ocean variations and their relation to atmosphere and cryosphere changes with unprecedente d stratigraphic detail. The cores recovered during Expedition 383 wil l allow us to test two major scientific hypotheses.  

The Drake Passage is the major geographic constriction for th e ACC and forms an important pathway for the return of upper waters to the Atlantic through the cold-water route of the AMO C (Gordon, 1986). Resolving changes in the flow of circumpolar water masses through the Drake Passage is crucial for advancing ou r understanding of the Southern Ocean’s role in affecting ocean an d climate change on a global scale. Surface and intermediate wate r masses flowing through the Drake Passage, together with th e warm-water route inflow of Indian Ocean water through th e Agulhas Current system, strongly affect AMOC (Beal et al., 2011; Knorr and Lohmann, 2003). Complementary sites below th e warm-water route were drilled during IODP Expedition 361 (Hal l et al., 2015).  

The role of the Drake Passage throughflow in driving changes i n global MOC on glacial–interglacial and millennial timescales is no t well constrained (Knorr and Lohmann, 2003; McCave et al., 2014). For the last glacial cycle, Lamy et al. (2015) reconstructed Drak e Passage throughflow based on a sediment record (MD07-3128 ) from the Chilean margin close to Site U1542 and another recor d from the southernmost Argentinean continental slope and found  a significant glacial decrease in Drake Passage throughflow (Figur e F5). This finding is consistent with generally reduced current velocities of the ACC during glacials and concomitant reduction in interbasin exchange in the Southern Ocean that is most likely regulate d by variations in the SWW field over the Subantarctic Zone an d changes in Antarctic sea ice extent. However, the link between AC C flow through the Drake Passage and changes in the AMOC are still not well established.

Past studies suggest that there are likely regional differences i n how the ACC varies on glacial–interglacial timescales. For example, downstream of the Drake Passage, a meridional section of sedimen t records from the Scotia Sea revealed little overall bottom curren t speed variations between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and th e Holocene (McCave et al., 2014). In the Indian sector of the Souther n Ocean, a $500~\mathrm{ky}$ record suggests that the ACC was weak durin g warm stages and strong during glacial intervals (Mazaud et al., 2010). Likewise in the southwest Pacific, the deep western boundary current east of New Zealand intensified during glacial period s over the past 1.2 My (Hall et al., 2001), a change that has been related to a northward extension of the ACC along the New Zealan d continental margin. Finally, a recent density reconstruction (base d on benthic foraminifers) across the ACC south of Australia suggested a moderate increase of the ACC flow during the LG M (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2016). Taken together, there is substantial disagreement about the ACC flow speed. Given the evidence for substantial  regional  differences  in  ACC  behavior,  it  has  bee n particularly challenging to make the link between Drake Passag e throughflow and changes in the AMOC dynamics on glacial–interglacial timescales.  

Superimposed on the long-term glacial reduction of Drake Passage throughflow, prominent high-amplitude, millennial-scale variability was observed, implying that the northern ACC in th e Southeast Pacific has a strong sensitivity to, or role in, suborbital climate variations (Lamy et al., 2015). Enhanced Drake Passag e throughflow during Antarctic warm periods is consistent with th e previously suggested impact of the bipolar seesaw mechanism o n the Southern Ocean (e.g., Anderson et al., 2009; Lamy et al., 2007), which includes surface water warming, enhanced upwelling, and  a stronger ACC caused by southward-shifted SWW. The glacial reduction of the cold-water route occurred in concert with the welldocumented decrease of the warm-water route (Agulhas leakage; Beal et al., 2011). The data currently available thus indicate tha t both of these oceanographic corridors are critical for the South Atlantic contribution to glacial AMOC strength changes.  

Our sites along the south Chilean margin (U1542 and U1544 ) and in the ESP (U1543) (Figure F2) provide a unique opportunity t o extend the existing ESP 60 ky record (Lamy et al., 2015) back int o the early Pleistocene and Pliocene to investigate the role of longterm, orbital-scale, and millennial-scale changes in ACC strengt h and Drake Passage throughflow on Antarctic and global climat e change, including warmer-than-present interglacials (e.g., Marin e Isotope Stages [MISs] 5e, 11, and 31) and Late Neogene warm periods.  

In the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, pronounced pas t changes in surface-ocean properties at both millennial and orbita l timescales, particularly SSTs, indicate an exceptional climate sensitivity to external and internal forcing. Glacial–interglacial amplitudes in Subantarctic SSTs are generally ${\tt>}4^{\circ}C$ in the Atlanti c (Gersonde et al., 2005; Martínez-García et al., 2010), Indian (e.g., D e Deckker et al., 2012; Lorrey et al., 2012), and Pacific Souther n Ocean (Caniupán et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2012; Pahnke et al., 2003). Millennial-scale fluctuations with amplitudes of ${\sim}2^{\circ}{-}3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ are observed at continental margin sites in the Subantarctic Pacific durin g the last glacial (Barrows et al., 2007; Caniupán et al., 2011; Lamy e t al., 2004; Pahnke et al., 2003). Furthermore, there is evidence fro m studies of Subantarctic surface ocean variability that high, middle, and low latitude ocean conditions are strongly linked. High-amplitude glacial–interglacial SST changes in the Subantarctic Pacifi c sector of the Southern Ocean (Ho et al., 2012) are closely coupled t o those observed in the subtropical ESP, implying large shifts of th e northern ACC system and export of Subantarctic surface wate r masses into the HCS. This variability is probably directly related t o variations in the strength and position of the ACC fronts, the SWW, and Drake Passage throughflow (Lamy et al., 2015) (Figure F5) . Along the Chilean margin, glacial cooling implies a stronger northward extension of the Antarctic cold water in the ESP (Ho et al., 2012) compared to the central Pacific (Figure F5). The significan t glacial decrease in Drake Passage transport accompanied by a reduction of the ACC transport strongly reduced the interbasin wate r mass exchange and enhanced the high–low latitude exchange in th e Pacific Eastern Boundary Current system. The reacceleration o f Drake Passage transport during the deglaciation matches majo r warming in the Subantarctic Southeast Pacific and South Atlanti c (Barker and Diz, 2014), suggesting a close coupling of Drake Passag e throughflow to the initiation of Southern Hemisphere warming.  

Evidence for the link between the ESP and far-field oceanographic changes can also be inferred from millennial-scale change s in Drake Passage throughflow (Lamy et al., 2015) that are parallele d by SST changes in the Southeast Pacific (ODP Site 1233) (Kaise r and Lamy, 2010) that extend north to the cold tongue in the easter n tropical Pacific (Lea et al., 2006). These data imply that substantial changes in the oceanographic dynamics of the South Pacific Gyr e are related to the northward deflection of ACC waters at millennial timescales. The suggested enhanced glacial northward export o f cold-water masses to the tropical Pacific reinforces modeling studies showing the importance of southerly derived surface and intermediate water masses in the tropical Pacific for global coolin g during the LGM (Liu et al., 2002). Paleoceanographic reconstructions based on our sites at the Chilean margin (U1542 and U1544 ) and in the ESP (U1543) in combination with ODP Leg 202 sites (Figure F6) (e.g., Dekens et al., 2007; Lamy et al., 2004; Pena et al., 2008; Rincon-Martinez  et  al.,  2009)  and  the  JR100  expeditio n (http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/JR100_379T.html) sites will allow us to examine, in unprecedented detail, changes i n the coupling between the ACC and the tropical Pacific over variou s timescales and at warmer-than-present climate states.  

Our drill sites will allow us to better constrain the latitudina l shifts of the Southern Ocean fronts over time to understand the resulting changes in ACC transport, intrabasin mixing, and AAI W production over a wider range of climate states. For example, reconstructions of past changes in the latitudinal position of the SAF suggest as much as $9^{\circ}$ latitude northward shifts during glacials, wherea s other areas suggest no shift at all (Kohfeld et al., 2013). Smalle r shifts probably occurred where the front is bathymetrically confined, like in the vicinity of the EPR (CSP sites). Large shifts likel y occurred in the ESP with the SAF potentially located north of th e Drake Passage during peak glacials (Gersonde et al., 2003; Ho et al., 2012; Lamy et al., 2015). As stated above, these changes may substantially affect the Drake Passage throughflow and low–high latitude exchange of heat and nutrients with major implications for th e global climate development. Farther south, Benz et al. (2016) reconstructed a glacial WSI expansion by ${\sim}2^{\circ}{-}3^{\circ}$ in latitude in the western part of the Pacific sector and an even stronger shift ( $\sim\!5^{\circ}$ i n latitude) of both the SACCF and the WSI edge in the central par t (Figures F6, F7). This west–east differentiation in the winter SS T pattern and sea ice extent can be related to differences in topographic and atmospheric forcing (Benz et al., 2016).  

Despite the potential importance of the Subantarctic Souther n Ocean in global climate change, there have been very few studie s that focus on the role of the ACC in the evolution of the cryospher e  

Figure F5. Central and eastern South Pacific paleoceanography and Drake Passage (DP) throughflow (modified from Lamy et al., 2015). The pronounced glacia l cooling in the eastern Subantarctic is consistent with a northward extension of Antarctic cold-water influence. Reduced Cape Horn Current (CHC) and mor e sluggish glacial northern DP transport results in reduced the export of Pacific Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) water into the South Atlantic (cold-wate r route). Reduced Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) strength and extended sea ice diminish the wind forcing on the ACC and thus the DP transport. Stronge r winds in the northern SWW enhance the South Pacific Gyre and the export of northern ACC water into the HCS.

and of the low–high latitude climate system connectivity from th e warm Pliocene and into the Pleistocene. Only one SST record i s available that reaches back to the Pliocene (ODP Site 1090 in th e Subantarctic Atlantic) (Figure F8). Here, the major cooling phase after ${\sim}1.6\,M\mathbf{a}$ coincides with the emergence of the eastern tropical Pacific  cold  tongue  and  an  intensification  of  the  meridiona l temperature gradients (Martínez-García et al., 2010) (Figure F4). The ANDRILL records suggest that high latitude climate coolin g between 3.0 and $2.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ drove both the WAIS and EAIS towar d their present expanded cold polar state (Naish et al., 2009). The intensification of Antarctic cooling resulted in strengthened SW W and northward migration of Southern Ocean fronts, which woul d restrict water exchange between ocean basins beginning after 3. 3 Ma (McKay et al., 2012). Warm early Pleistocene and Pliocene SST s are consistent with the poleward expanded warm pool (Brierley e t al., 2009).  

Our sites from the CSP (U1539–U1541) will allow a more comprehensive assessment of its temperature evolution and relation t o atmospheric variations of the SWW, sea ice, AIS variability, and lo w latitude climate change during cold and warmer-than-present (e.g., MISs 5, 11, and 31 and the Pliocene warming) time periods. Information on warm periods is critical to the assessment of the Southern Ocean’s role under future warming; this is especially true for th e AIS melting and associated sea level rise because ice sheet modelin g and modern observations show that oceanic forcing is the most important determinant of AIS melting (Pollard and DeConto 2009; Paolo et al., 2015).  

Moreover, temperature records from our high-resolution sites a t the Chilean margin (U1542 and U1544) and CSP (U1539 an d U1540) will allow us to compare millennial-scale variations betwee n the Pacific Southern Ocean and Antarctica for a time interval that i s well beyond the reach of ice cores. Even on a global scale, such millennial-scale temperature records back into the Pliocene are rar e (e.g., Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1313 [Naafs et al., 2013] and ODP Site 980 [McManus et al., 1999]).  

2. Hypothesis H2: variations in the Pacific ACC determine the physical and biological characteristics of the oceanic carbon pump and atmospheric $C O_{2}.$  

Atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere  interactions  and  teleconnections between high and low latitudes play an important role in pas t and future climate change, and the Subantarctic Southern Ocea n provides the major link between Antarctica and the low latitudes. I n the Southern Ocean, atmosphere-ocean interactions are believed t o

The geographic locations and water depths of the sites allow us to (1) compare the dynamics of the ACC laterally between the central Sout h Pacific in the vicinity of the EPR (bathymetric constraints) and the eastern South Pacific before entering the Drake Passage and (2) investigate the vertica l structure of the ACC. The sites sample the major water masses of the ACC in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean from AAIW (Site U1542), across th e CDW/PDW (Sites U1539–U1541), and potentially down to AABW (U1543) (Ferrari et al., 2014).

control sea ice cover, AIS dynamics, upper ocean stratification, biological nutrient utilization, and exposure rates of deep water. Thus, they have been considered to play a key role in explaining the variability in atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ concentrations, which are controlled b y biogeochemical and physical processes.  

The SWW strongly impact the upwelling of carbon-rich deepwater masses in the Southern Ocean that affect atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (e.g., Toggweiler 2006, Anderson et al., 2009) and also control th e return flow of intermediate waters to the tropics (Figure F9). Moreover, the SWW exert an important control on upwelling of relativel y warm deep water at the West Antarctic continental shelf, where i t causes sub–ice shelf melting and mass loss of the WAIS (e.g., Stei g et al., 2012). Thus, the SWW are thought to play a key role in pas t and future climate change, yet their strength and position in colde r and warmer climates relative to today remain a wide-open questio n (Kohfeld et al., 2013).  

In the modern Southern Ocean, deep waters with high dissolve d inorganic carbon and major nutrient concentrations are carried t o the surface by wind-driven upwelling and density-driven overturning. However, because phytoplankton growth is limited by the scarcity of iron, a substantial fraction of these nutrients return to th e subsurface before they are completely consumed. This incomplet e utilization of nutrients represents a substantial leak in the moder n global biological pump because it allows the escape of deeply sequestered carbon back to the atmosphere, keeping atmospheri c $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ levels high during interglacial stages. An increase in the efficiency of the global biological pump can be accomplished either b y decreasing the physical cycling of deep water through the surface o f the Southern Ocean or by increasing the degree to which surfac e nutrients are consumed by marine organisms (e.g., as a result of increasing iron availability relative to other nutrients) (Sigman an d Boyle, 2000; Sigman et al., 2010).  

Paleoceanographic records (mainly from the Atlantic sector o f the Southern Ocean) indicate that ice age productivity was lowe r (Anderson et al., 2009; Kohfeld et al., 2005; Jaccard et al., 2013) i n the Antarctic zone (i.e., south of the APF) and nutrient consumption was higher (Robinson and Sigman, 2008; Studer et al., 2015). These data indicate that the Antarctic zone was more strongly stratified during ice ages, inhibiting the physical mixing of deep carbonrich deep water to the surface and therefore contributing to the lowering of atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ during glacial times.  

In the Subantarctic Atlantic, higher dust flux, increased productivity and nutrient consumption, and lower atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ co-occur during peak glacial times and Antarctic millennial cold events, which has been associated with iron fertilization (e.g., Frank et al., 2000; Kumar et al., 1995; Martínez-García et al., 2009, 2011, 2014). Martínez-García et al. (2009, 2014) suggested that around 40–5 0 ppmv of the glacial atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ decline can be attributed t o iron fertilization (Figure F10), which is in good agreement wit h some model estimates (Hain et al., 2010; Chalk et al., 2017; Brovki n et al., 2007). At ODP Site 1090, the first significant rise in ice ag e dust and iron deposition over the past 4 My occurred at ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ and the most pronounced rise in dust deposition occurred acros s the mid-Pleistocene transition (Martínez-García et al., 2011).  

For the past 1 My, higher dust deposition during glacial period s compared to interglacials has also been documented for the Pacifi c Southern Ocean, suggesting an eastward extension of the influenc e of Australian and/or New Zealand dust sources (Lamy et al., 2014). In this area, dust fluxes follow the same glacial–interglacial fluctuations, but absolute glacial fluxes in the Subantarctic Pacific ar e about half of those in the Atlantic Southern Ocean (Figure F11). A s in the Atlantic sector, export production in the Subantarctic Zon e of the Pacific sector over the past ${\sim}450~\mathrm{ky}$ is higher during glacial times, but in contrast to the Subantarctic Atlantic (Martínez-Garcí a et al., 2014), the relationship between productivity and nutrien t consumption has not yet been evaluated in detail. Preliminary dat a suggest that nutrient consumption increased in response to iro n fertilization (A. Martínez-García, unpubl. data).  

Expedition 383 drill cores from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean will allow exploration of the glacial–interglacial change s

in biological productivity both north and south of the APF in mor e detail. Published studies, including those from ODP Leg 177, sho w that during glacial periods of the late Quaternary in the Atlanti c sector of the Southern Ocean, biological productivity increased i n the Subantarctic Zone and decreased in the Antarctic Zone south o f the APF (Diekmann, 2007; Jaccard et al., 2013). The glacial productivity decrease south of the APF is under debate and may have bee n caused either by stratification of the water column (Sigman et al., 2004; Jaccard et al., 2005) or expansion of Antarctic sea ice coverag e (Hillenbrand and Cortese, 2006).  

Our drill sites in the CSP (U1539–U1541) will provide robus t data to test to what extent processes that are active in the Atlanti c sector can be translated to the Pacific sector, thus allowing th e construction of a more global picture of the Southern Ocean’s rol e in nutrient distribution and biogenic export production and thei r impact on $C O_{2}$ variations. It is necessary to solve these issues i n the Pacific before the impact on the ocean carbon cycle under different climate boundary conditions can be modeled more realistically.  

Moreover, the ESP site (U1543) and Chilean margin site s (U1542 and U1544) will provide a long-term record of variabilit y of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS). Both terrestrial records fro m Patagonia and records of ice-rafted debris (IRD) in marine sediment cores from the Chilean margin (Core MD07-3128 at Proposed  Site  CHI-4A)  indicate  substantial  millennial-scal e variability of the PIS paralleling dust input changes recorded i n Antarctic ice cores. This covariance implies a causal link betwee n ice sheet advances and dust availability (Caniupán et al., 2011; Sugden et al., 2009). Thus, the Chilean margin sites will provid e important baseline information for dust variability in the Atlanti c sector of the ACC.  

Our two hypotheses contain a large number of challenging research targets critical for paleoceanography and paleoclimatolog y on a global scale. CSP Sites U1539–U1541 represent the first drill cores in the Subantarctic Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Th e deep Pacific ESP site (U1543) is located in a particularly sensitiv e ocean area where glacial–interglacial changes are strongly amplified. Finally, the Chilean margin sites provide information o n changes at shallower water depths together with changes in PIS extent and potential links to dust input to the Atlantic sector of th e Southern Ocean.

# Background and objectives  

Site U1539 (Proposed Site CSP-2B) is located in the CSP a t $56^{\circ}09.0655^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $115^{\circ}08.038^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , ${\sim}1600\ \mathrm{nmi}$ west of the Strait of Magellan at $4070\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F12). The site sits at the easter n flank of the southernmost EPR, ${\sim}220\,\mathrm{nmi}$ from the modern seafloo r spreading axis, and is underlain by oceanic crust formed betwee n ${\sim}10$ and $12\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Eagles, 2006). Assuming a constant seafloor halfspreading rate of ${\sim}4.5~\mathrm{cm}$ (Pitman and Heirtzler, 1966), the plat e tectonic backtrack path of Site U1539 moves the site westward. Th e extrapolated backward trajectory translates to an early Pliocene position ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{nmi}$ closer to the crest of the EPR at a water depth shallower by several hundred meters. At a smaller scale, the site i s located in a northeast–southwest oriented, ${\sim}5\;\mathrm{nmi}$ wide trough tha t parallels the orientation of the EPR. The adjacent ridges rise t o ${\sim}3000\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth northwest of the site and to ${\sim}3500\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth to the southeast (Figure F12).  

Site U1539 is located on MCS Line AWI-201000013 (Figur e F13A) close to the intersection with Line AWI-2010000011 (Gersonde, 2011). The seismic cross-lines indicate ${\sim}650\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sediments above oceanic basement. Sediments are mostly well stratifie d with flat-lying reflectors. Low to moderately reflecting layers become stronger deeper than ${\sim}100{-}120\;\mathrm{m}$ sediment depth. Sedimen t echo sound (Parasound) profiles (Gersonde, 2011) reveal excellen t penetration $(>\!150\;\mathrm{m})$ with distinct layering (Figure F13B), suggesting a succession of fine-grained soft sediments with varying lithologic composition.  

Site U1539 lies in the pathway of the Subantarctic ACC, ${\sim}100$ nmi north of the modern average SAF, in a zonal transition zone o f the ACC. West of the site, the ACC and associated fronts ar e strongly steered by the topography of seafloor spreading system s (Udintsev and Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zone systems), whereas t o the east the vast Amundsen Sea basin does not influence the AC C strongly.  

SSTs  seasonally vary  between ${\sim}2^{\circ}C$ (July–September) an d ${\sim}6.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (January–March). The area is located west of the mai n AAIW and Mode Water formation regions in the ESP. The $4070\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth places Site U1539 within LCDW, close to the boundar y with AABW (Figure F14). This hydrographic setting makes it ideal to evaluate past changes in frontal position, associated export production, ACC current speed and position, and aeolian dust and IR D input during the Pleistocene.  

The main objectives at Site U1539 were to • Recover a moderate- to high-resolution Subantarctic Pliocene– Quaternary sediment record close to the SAF; • Characterize the stratigraphy of siliceous and calcareous oozes, allowing for a wide range of paleoceanographic reconstructions; • Reconstruct high-amplitude Subantarctic SSTs and sea ice variations; • Provide a record of lowermost CDW and glacial AABW; • Reconstruct productivity (opal versus carbonate), nutrient distribution, and dust-productivity coupling; and • Recover a potential far-field record of WAIS variability.  

# Operations  

The first core of Expedition 383 was taken from Hole U1539A a t 0445 h on 1 June 2019 from 4071.1 meters below sea level (mbsl). We used the advanced piston corer (APC) system to penetrate fro m the seafloor to $107.6\;\mathrm{m}$ core depth below seafloor, Method A (CSFA) (Cores 1H–12H) and recover $104.75\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(97\%)$ . The hol e was terminated after Core 12H because of rough weather and se a conditions. Shattered liners were recorded on Cores 5H and 11H. Shear pins were sheared prematurely on Cores 1H, 11H, and 12H.  

After $27\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of waiting on weather, Hole U1539B was spudded a t $0540~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 June. Cores $\mathrm{1H-3H}$ recovered $21.9~\mathrm{m}$ $78\%$ recovery), but Cores 2H and 3H were misfires, so we decided to terminate th e hole and wait for seas to further improve before continuing operations.  

By $1245\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , heave had fallen to $_{3.0\mathrm{~m~}}$ and we resumed coring . Hole U1539C was started with Core 1H returning a full $9.7\textrm{m}$ cor e barrel. This allowed us to determine a seafloor depth of 4070. 2 mbsl. Full-length APC coring continued to refusal at $240.1\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ (Core 26H). Half-length APC (HLAPC) coring was then used t o

deepen the hole, and coring terminated after Core 32F at $268.1\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. A total of 32 cores were taken in this hole using the AP C and HLAPC systems. Formation temperature measurements wer e taken with Cores 4H, 13H, and 16H. Partial strokes were recorde d on Cores 24H–27F with high overpull on Cores 17H–26H. A misfire was recorded on Core 31F.  

Hole U1539D was spot cored to fill in coring gaps from the previous holes. The hole was spudded at $1405\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 June, drilled ahea d without recovery to $47.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, where coring began, and continued to $198\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with seven drilled intervals totaling $68.7~\mathrm{m}$ .  A total of 14 APC cores were taken over the $129.3\textrm{m}$ cored interval with a recovery of $128.15\mathrm{~m~}(99\%)$ . The hole reached maximu m depth at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 June, and the drill string was recovered, endin g the hole and Site U1539. Misfires were recorded on Cores 2H, 3H, 6H, 8H, and 9H and a partial stroke was recorded on Core 18H. N o temperature or orientation measurements were taken in this hole.

# Principal results  

At Site U1539, a $268.1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick continuous sequence of Holocen e to early Pleistocene sediments was recovered with a bottom-hol e age of ${\sim}1.3\,M\mathbf{a}$ and a mean sedimentation rate of ${\sim}20.6\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ Hol e U1539C recovered the deepest cored sediments at $268.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The recovered $247.50\mathrm{~m~}$ of core spans one lithologic unit with tw o subunits consisting of interbedded calcareous and siliceous biogenic ooze (Figure F15). Site U1539 sediments can broadly be divided into two categories: (1) diatom ooze with varying amounts o f calcareous and biosiliceous components and (2) biogenic carbonat e ooze with varying amounts of biosiliceous and other calcareou s components. Siliceous microfossils show relatively good preservation and are abundant throughout the record. Preservation of calcareous microfossils varies from moderate to good.  

Five primary lithofacies were identified, and they mostly diffe r in their proportions of calcareous and biosiliceous components (Table T2). Secondary defining attributes include degree of diageneti c alteration, bioturbation, and in the case of Lithofacies 5, microfossi l size and sedimentary structure. Lithofacies 1a is composed of distinct centimeter-scale diatom mats in a biogenic ooze matrix. Thi s facies can be distinguished from Lithofacies 1b, which is characterized by sequences of more pronounced and stacked diatom mat s with a near absence of diatom ooze matrix. Lithofacies 2 is the dominant lithofacies at Site U1539. It consists of light greenish gray t o gray carbonate-bearing or carbonate-rich diatomaceous ooze tha t exhibits moderate to heavy bioturbation. Lithofacies 3 consists o f white to light gray diatom-bearing to diatom-rich nannofossil o r calcareous oozes that occur as thin beds generally $<\!3\textrm{m}$ thick wit h moderate to heavy bioturbation. Lithofacies 4 is nearly pure nannofossil ooze. Lithofacies 5 consists of foraminiferal oozes and sand s that occur sporadically as centimeter- to decimeter-scale layer s characterized by a sharp basal contact and distinct cross-beddin g observable in X-ray images.  

We divided the Site U1539 stratigraphic sequence into Subunit s IA and IB based on the relative abundance of the five defined lithofacies. With the exception of Lithofacies 5 in Subunit IB, all lithofacies are present in both subunits, but the thickness, frequency, an d overall occurrence differs between the two. Subunit IA is characterized by the frequent occurrence of ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ thick beds of calcareou s and nannofossil ooze (Lithofacies 3) and limited occurrence of diatom mats (Lithofacies 1b). In contrast, Subunit IB has only a few occurrences of Lithofacies 4 and is largely dominated by beds of thic k and continuous diatom mats (Figure F16). One massive homogenous ${\sim}10.7\;\mathrm{m}$ thick bed of diatom-rich nannofossil ooze that exhibits  an  erosional  basal  contact  overlain  by  foraminifer  sand s (Lithofacies 5) interrupts the normal depositional sequence of Subunit IB and most likely represents a single rapidly deposited bed. Carbonate-bearing and carbonate-rich diatomaceous ooze (Lithofacies 2) is the dominant lithofacies in both subunits and does no t provide a useful means to divide the stratigraphy because of it s widespread occurrence. The prominent white to light gray calcareous beds associated with Lithofacies 4 drive the high-amplitud e variations in color reflectance and spectrophotometry values (redgreen-blue color space [RGB] blue and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ ). In general, we observe d high-amplitude, low-frequency variations above the subunit boundary at $125\,\mathrm{~m~}$ core composite depth below seafloor, Method  A (CCSF-A), and more frequent low-amplitude variations below i t (Figure F16).  

Biostratigraphic age assignments are in agreement with eac h other and are mainly derived from diatom, radiolarian, and calcareous nannofossil datums. The preliminary shipboard age model derived largely from diatom, radiolarian, and nannofossil datum s indicate no major hiatuses, indicating that a continuous sedimen t sequence from the early Pleistocene through the Holocene was recovered at this site.  

We could not observe unambiguous evidence for geomagneti c reversals in any of the holes at Site U1539. This is probably due t o low natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensities that coul d be related to the high diatom content of the sediments. Therefore, paleomagnetic reversals were not included in the preliminary shipboard age model for Site U1539.  

We analyzed samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bulk sediment chemistry at a resolution of three per cor e for Hole U1539A and three per core from 78.9 to ${120}\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, tw o per core from 120 to $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and one per core from $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the bottom of Hole U1539C at $266.41\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Headspace samples were not collected from HLAPC cores. Methan e concentration is low at this site overall. It gradually increases downhole, averaging 12.3 ppmv and never exceeding 18.4 ppmv. Ethan e and propane remain below detection limit throughout the entir e hole. In Hole U1539A, alkalinity increases in the uppermost $10.6\;\mathrm{m}$ to $\sim\!5\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{{r}}}$ , likely because of anaerobic organic matter remineralization. pH values also increase from 7.7 at the surface to ${\sim}8$ at $2.94\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and remain constant with depth. Interstitial water magnesium and lithium concentrations appear conservative throughou t the sediment column. Dissolved manganese concentrations increase sharply from below detection limit in the mudline sample t o a maximum of $60\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $7.57\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, indicating anaerobic, reductive dissolution of manganese oxides within the uppermost $3\textrm{m}$ o f sediment.

The composite carbonate record at Site U1539 (Holes U1539 A and U1539C) shows downhole variability ranging from 2.9 to 92. 8 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ and a strong correlation with RGB blue and reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ measurements (Figure F17) and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bul k density. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentration has a mea n value of $0.40\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , and values range between 0.18 and $0.75\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ $\left[n=\right.$ 86). Total nitrogen (TN) concentrations vary between 0.004 an d $0.079\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ with a U1539 average of $0.039~\mathrm{wt}\%$ $(n=90)$ ). The mea n value of TOC/TN is often ${>}10$ from $0.8\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1539A t o $115.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1539C.  

Physical properties measurements at Site U1539 included nondestructive whole-round measurements of GRA bulk density, magnetic  susceptibility  (MS),  Whole-Round  Multisensor  Logge r (WRMSL) $P$ -wave velocity, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) o n core sections from Holes U1539A–U1539D. Additional physical properties collected include thermal conductivity on whole-roun d cores from all holes. Downhole changes in physical property char

Correlations between holes at Site U1539 were accomplishe d using the Correlator software (version 3.0). We constructed  a splice for the upper portion of the site from 0 to 219.80 m CCSF- A using Holes U1539A–U1539D. However, the splice contains several gaps, as detailed below. Below $219.80\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A, only a singl e hole (U1539C) was drilled; thus, Cores 383-U1539C-22H throug h 32F were appended to the splice with gaps set between each cor e to the bottom of the hole. The composite depth scale is anchore d to the mudline of Core 383-U1539A-1H, which is assigned as $0\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A.  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic results, mainly including diatom and nannofossil age mark  

![](images/1672974899766b04c76f80d32f89ab268f9bc84e6661ef9cd13f80ee078873e5.jpg)  
ers. These data suggest that the sedimentary sequence recovered a t Site U1539 covers the past ${\sim}1.3$ My (Figure F19). For a pelagic setting, sedimentation rates are extraordinarily high, reaching on average $17\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ back to $0.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and even higher values of ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ from $\mathord{\sim}0.9$ to $1.3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . This biostratigraphic age model is generall y consistent with preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed onboard based on physical property data such as color measurement s (RGB blue) and GRA bulk density.  

The combination of nearly continuous recovery, very high sedimentation rates driven by high diatom productivity and potential sediment focusing, clear patterns in physical properties and sediment color, and a rich array of well-preserved diatoms combine d with calcareous microfossils will provide unprecedented opportunities for improving our understanding of the dynamics of the AC C and its link to global carbon cycle changes at orbital and suborbital timescales.

Site U1540  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1540 (Proposed Site CSP-7A) is located in the CSP a t $55^{\circ}08.467^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $114^{\circ}50.515^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , ${\sim}1600~\mathrm{nmi}$ west of the Strait of Magellan at $3580~\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F20). The site sits at the easter n flank of the southernmost EPR within the Eltanin-Tharp Fractur e Zone, ${\sim}130\ \mathrm{nmi}$ from the modern seafloor spreading axis, and i s underlain by oceanic crust formed at the EPR about 6–8 My ag o (Eagles, 2006). Assuming overall constant seafloor half-spreadin g rates of ${\sim}4.5~\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Pitman and Heirtzler, 1966), the plate tectoni c backtrack path of Site U1540 moves the site westward to an earl y Pliocene position ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{nmi}$ closer to the crest of the EPR at a wate r depth shallower by several hundred meters. At a smaller scale, th e site is located at the northeast end of a ridge that parallels the orientation of the EPR.  

Site U1540 is crossed by a sediment echo sound (Parasound) profile that is oriented northwest–southeast. The Parasound profile documents excellent penetration $\left(>\!150\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering (Figur e

Site U1540 lies in the pathway of the Subantarctic ACC, ${\sim}170$ nmi north of the modern mean position of the SAF in a zonal transition zone of the ACC. West of the site, the ACC and the associate d fronts are strongly steered by the topography of seafloor spreadin g systems (Udintsev and Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zone systems), whereas to the east, the vast Amundsen Sea basin does not influence the position of the ACC strongly.

SSTs seasonally vary between ${\sim}2.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (July–September) an d ${\sim}7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (January–March). The area is located west of the main AAI W and Mode Water formation regions in the Southeast Pacific. Th e $3580\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth places Site U1540 within LCDW (Figure F14). This hydrographic setting makes it ideal to evaluate past changes i n frontal position, associated export production, ACC current spee d and position, and aeolian dust and IRD input during the Pleistocen e and Pliocene.  

The main objectives at Site U1540 were to • Recover a moderate- to high-resolution Subantarctic Pliocene– Quaternary sediment record close to the SAF; • Characterize the stratigraphy of siliceous and calcareous oozes, allowing for a wide range of paleoceanographic reconstructions; • Reconstruct high-amplitude Subantarctic SSTs and sea ice variations; • Provide a record of LCDW and glacial AABW;

# Operations  

The sea voyage to Site U1540 began at $0224\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 7 June 2019. I t was a short $61\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit that was completed in only $6.1\,\mathrm{h},$ and th e ship arrived on site at $0830\,\mathrm{h}$ . The thrusters were lowered, and th e vessel was in full dynamic positioning mode over the site coordinates by $0929\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill crew made up an APC/extended core barrel (XCB) bottom-hole assembly (BHA) and lowered the drill strin g to the seafloor, placing the bit at 2171 meters below rig floor (mbrf ) by $1645~\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel began experiencing heave above $7~\mathrm{m}$ with  a roll of ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ at that time, and it was decided to wait for the seas t o calm before continuing operations.  

By $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 June, the seas had calmed sufficiently to continu e operations. With an estimated depth of $3600.6~\mathrm{mbrf}$ (calculated b y the precision depth recorder [PDR]), the bit was lowered to 3595. 0 mbrf to spud Hole U1540A. Core 1H recovered $9.0\;\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t and determined a seafloor depth of 3584.6 mbsl. Hole U1540A wa s deepened to $150\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and Cores 1H–16H recovered $155.1\;\mathrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ by $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 June. The top drive was set back, and the bi t was pulled to 3561 mbrf, clearing the seafloor at $0900~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 Jun e and ending Hole U1540A. Formation temperature measurement s were taken with the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3 ) tool on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, and $16\mathrm{H},$ and orientation measurements were taken on all cores. Misfires were recorded on Cores 1H, 7H, and 16H. A misfire on Core 7H caused an unreliable temperature reading.  

The vessel was moved $^{20\mathrm{~m~}}$ east, and the bit was lowered t o 3575 mbrf to spud Hole U1540B. Our first attempt to take a mudline core did not retrieve any sediment. The bit was then lowere d $9.5\textrm{m}$ to $384.5~\mathrm{mbrf},$ and Hole U1540B was started at $1220~\mathrm{h}$ on  9 June. Based on the recovery in Core 1H, the seafloor was calculate d at 3580.0 mbsl. APC coring continued to $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with thre e drilled intervals (totaling $10\,\mathrm{\,m},$ ) to help obtain good overlap wit h

cores from Hole U1540A. A total of 16 cores were taken over a 140. 8 m interval with $101\%$ recovery. Misfires were recorded on Core s 1H, 6H, 8H, and 11H. The bit was raised, clearing the seafloor a t $0958\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 June and ending Hole U1540B.  

After coring Hole U1540B, permission was requested from th e IODP Environmental Protection and Safety Panel to extend the allowed penetration depth at Site U1540 from 150 to $275~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. This request was based on the successful recovery of a complete an d continuous Pleistocene sedimentary record from Holes U1540 A and U1540B. The increase in penetration depth would allow us t o extend this record into the Pliocene, which was expected directl y below the already cored maximum depth of $150\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ . An additional reason for the request was the prevailing sea conditions, which predicted two additional days of reasonably calm seas, thu s allowing for further drilling, whereas significantly worst sea conditions were forecast at our two other primary sites in the CSP.  

Hole U1540C was spudded $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1540B at 111 0 h on 10 June with the bit positioned at 3587.5 mbrf. Core 383- U1540C-1H recovered $6.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , but the top of the core lacked th e characteristic light brown oxidized layer that would have indicate d the recovery of a good sediment–water interface. Therefore, we decided to end Hole U1540C and attempt another mudline core.  

![](images/39c2542885a78360e1ddecf9a99500d8a191c0361ea5aea6822b3d6a5a611ec0.jpg)

We repositioned the vessel $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ west of Hole U1540C an d started Hole U1540D with the bit at 3587.5 mbrf. Core 1H recovere d $8.9\textrm{m}(100\%)$ with a noticeable light brown sediment layer at the to p of the core. The amount of core recovered determined a water dept h of 3577.5 mbsl. APC coring continued to $79.2~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with thre e interspersed, short drilled intervals to ensure adequate core overla p for stratigraphic correlation between Holes U1540A–U1540C.  

Permission to extend the penetration depth at Site U1540 to 27 5 m CSF-A was received while retrieving Core 383-U1540D-11 H from $79.2~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. At that point, we drilled ahead without recovery to $131.0\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ before resuming coring operations. The AP C coring system was redeployed, and the hole was deepened until w e reached APC refusal at $210.5\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ . Cores 21H and 22H (207.0– $210.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ) recovered just 3.39 and $_{0.5\textrm{m}}$ of sediment, respectively, with numerous rock fragments. We chose to deploy the XC B system for one more core in an attempt to recover more of the presumed basement material, but after coring for $45\;\mathrm{min}$ with only 0. 5 m of advancement, the core barrel was pulled back on board wit h no recovery. We raised the bit, which cleared the seafloor at $1710\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 June, ending Hole U1540D. A total of 19 cores were take n over a $151.8~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $151\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered $(99\%)$ . Misfires wer e recorded on Cores 4H and 6H, and partial strokes were recorded o n Cores 22H and 23H.  

The vessel was offset another $20\textrm{m}$ west of Hole U1540D, an d the bit was spaced out for spudding another hole using the seafloo r depth calculated from Hole U1540D. Hole U1540E was spudded a t $1840~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 June and drilled ahead without recovery to $135.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. At that point, we deployed the APC system and cored continuously until APC refusal at 213.3 m CSF-A (Cores 2H–10H). Th e pipe was recovered on board, and the bit cleared the rotary table a t $1900~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 June. The rig was secured and readied for transit b y $1905\,\mathrm{h}$ . A total of eight cores were taken from Hole U1540E with th e APC system over a $76.0~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $78.9~\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(104\%)$ . Core $10\mathrm{H}$ experienced a partial stroke. Two drilled intervals advanced $137.0\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

With the seas too high to raise the thrusters, the vessel waite d on weather until the seas calmed down at $1545~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 June. Th e thrusters were then raised, and the vessel began the transit to Sit e U1541.  

# Principal results  

A ${\sim}213\mathrm{~m~}$ thick continuous sequence of Holocene to early Pliocene sediments was recovered at Site U1540 (Figure F22). A bottom-hole age of ${\sim}4.8\mathrm{~Ma}$ and a mean sedimentation rate of ${\sim}4.5$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ were determined. The deepest cored sediments were recovered in Hole U1540E. A spliced sedimentary sequence ${\sim}227\mathrm{~m~}$ i n length was constructed from Holes U1540A–U1540E. Five primar y lithofacies were identified at this site (Figure F23). The numberin g of facies is based on all facies documented for Expedition 383 so far. The sequence is dominated by light greenish gray to gray carbonatebearing to carbonate-rich diatom oozes (Lithofacies 2). These ar e frequently interbedded with light gray or light greenish gray diatom-bearing to diatom-rich nannofossil or calcareous oozes (Lithofacies 3). Less abundant are white to very light gray nannofossil oozes of heavily bioturbated, massive appearance (Lithofacies 4 ) and greenish gray to gray clay-bearing to clay-rich biogenic ooze s (Lithofacies 6) and carbonate- and/or biosilica-bearing clay (Lithofacies 7). Based on the distribution and co-occurrence of the defined lithofacies, we divided the Site U1540 sedimentary sequenc e into two lithostratigraphic units and divided Unit I into two subunits, IA and IB. Subunit IA extends to ${\sim}58\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ${\sim}62.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A) and is dominated by Lithofacies 2 and thin intercalate d beds of Lithofacies 4. It is therefore broadly equivalent to Subuni t IA at Site U1539. Subunit IB spans from ${\sim}58$ to $\sim\!156\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF- A $[\sim\!62.3\$ to $177.8\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ ) and shows an increased occurrence o f Lithofacies 3 and a decreased contribution of Lithofacies 2. Lithofacies 1, 4, and 6 are virtually missing in this subunit. Unit II extend s from $178\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A to the base of the record at $227.13\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF- A ( $165.83{-}210.50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1540D and $165.33{-}213.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1540E). This unit is marked by a significant increase in the proportion of calcareous Lithofacies 3 and 4 and th e appearance of the clay-bearing to clay-rich Lithofacies 6 in the lowermost ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m}$ of the unit. Lithofacies 7 occupies parts of the lowermost $\mathord{\sim}8\,\mathrm{m}$ of Unit II, is pale yellowish brown to dark reddish brown, and the sediment appears to be enriched in iron (hydr)oxides. Th e last two sections of Core 383-U1540D-21H and the core catcher o f Core 22H contain altered volcanic glass.  

Biostratigraphic age assignments are overall consistent wit h each other and are mainly derived from diatom, radiolarian, an d calcareous nannofossil datums as well as planktonic foraminife r biozonations. None of the different biozonations record any majo r hiatuses, indicating that a continuous sediment sequence from th e early Pliocene through the Holocene was recovered at this site. Th e core catcher sample of the deepest core from Hole U1540E (Cor e 10H) contained a few reworked taxa from the Miocene. However, the in situ microfossils present in this interval indicate a maximu m early Pliocene age at the base of Site U1540.  

Paleomagnetic measurements indicate a number of polarit y changes that are best illustrated by downhole changes in inclination. The boundaries that define each polarity reversal are overall reasonably distinct. Prior to demagnetization, inclinations in the uppermost $40\,\textrm{m}$ are dominantly positive, which is opposite to th e expected inclination during the normal polarity Brunhes Chron. After demagnetization, inclinations become steeply negative an d largely consistent with values expected for a geocentric axial dipol e for the site’s location. Positive inclinations associated with reverse d polarity of the Matuyama Chron were observed in Holes U1540A, U1540B, and U1540D. However, the Matuyama–Brunhes polarit y transition is not definitively captured within any core other tha n possibly at the base of Core 383-U1540B-5H. Three normal polarit y subchrons within the Matuyama Chron were observed. The uppe r

Methane concentrations are ver y low at this site overall, ranging from 6 to 2 ppm with an average content of 4 ppm. Ethane and propane remained below detection limi t throughout the entire hole.  

We analyzed samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bulk sediment chemistry at a resolution of three sample s per core from 0 to $120\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, two per core from 120 to $150~\mathrm{m}$

Above $\mathord{\sim}134\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Holes U1540A and U1540B), alkalinit y and $\mathsf{p H}$ show no obvious trends, varying around averages of $3.4~\pm$ $0.5~\mathrm{mM}$ and $7.96\,\pm\,0.07$ , respectively. Below this depth, alkalinit y and $\mathsf{p H}$ exhibit almost identical behavior, first increasing to a loca l peak at ${\sim}157\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and then decreasing steadily to the botto m of Hole U1540D.  

The composite carbonate record at Site U1540 shows downhol e variability ranging from 6 to $93.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ and a strong correlation wit h RGB blue and reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ (Figure F24) and GRA bulk densit y measurements. TOC content has a mean value of $0.36~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and  a standard deviation of 0.13 across the entire cored interval. TOC values range from $0.75~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $20.63\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1540A to 0.1 3 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $204.4~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1540D. The TOC record shows n o correlation to the $C a C O_{3}$ record $(r^{2}=0.004)$ ) downhole.  

Physical property measurements at Site U1540 include nondestructive whole-round measurements of GRA bulk density, MS, WRMSL $P$ -wave velocity, and NGR on core sections from Hole s U1540A–U1540E. Additional physical properties collected includ e

These data suggest that th e sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1540 covers the past ${\sim}4.8$ My (Figure F26). Though substantially lower than at Site U1539, sedimentation rates at Site U1540 are remarkably high for a pelagi c setting. Below a condensed shallow section downhole to ${\sim}0.3\mathrm{~Ma}$ , sedimentation rates average $7.5~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ downhole to $\sim\!2.7$ Ma an d decrease to ${\sim}1.5\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ during most of the Pliocene $(2.7{-}4.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . This age model is generally consistent with preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed on board based on physical property dat a such as color measurements (RGB blue) and GRA bulk density.  

The combination of nearly continuous recovery, very high sedimentation rates driven by high diatom productivity during glacial periods and potential sediment focusing, clear patterns in physical

Site U1541 (Proposed Site CSP-1A) is located in the CSP a t $54^{\circ}12.756^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $125^{\circ}25.540^{\prime}\mathbb{W}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , ${\sim}1830~\mathrm{nmi}$ west of the Strait of Magellan, at $3604\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F27). The site sits at the wester n flank of the southernmost EPR, ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{nmi}$ north of the Tharp Fracture Zone and ${\sim}160\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ west of the modern seafloor spreadin g axis, and is underlain by oceanic crust formed at the EPR at $\mathord{\sim}6\mathrm{-}8$ Ma (Eagles, 2006). Assuming overall constant seafloor half spreading rates of ${\sim}4.5~\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Pitman and Heirtzler, 1966), the plate tectonic backtrack path of Site U1541 moves the site eastward, placin g it ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{nmi}$ closer to the crest of the EPR at a water depth shallowe r by several hundred meters in the early Pliocene. At a smaller scale, the site is located in a ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{nmi}$ wide trough oriented NNE–SSW, parallel to the orientation of the EPR. The adjacent ridges rise to $\mathord{\sim}3400$ m water depth southeast of the site and to ${\sim}3500\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth t o the northwest (Figure F27).

Site U1541 is located on MCS Line AWI-201000014 at the intersection with Line AWI-2010000016 (Figure F28A) (Gersonde, 2011). The seismic cross-lines indicate ${\sim}180~\mathrm{m}$ thick sediments above oceanic basement. Sediments are mostly well stratified with flat lying, slightly irregular reflectors. Low to moderately reflecting layers become stronger below ${\sim}120{-}140\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Sediment echo soun d (Parasound) profiles (Gersonde, 2011) indicate moderate penetratio n $\left(\sim\!80\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering (Figure F28B), suggesting a successio n of fine-grained soft sediments with varying lithologic composition.  

Site U1541 lies in the pathway of the Subantarctic ACC, ${\sim}100$ nmi north of the modern mean position of the SAF. In this sector o f the ACC, the associated fronts are strongly steered by the topography of seafloor spreading systems (Udintsev and Eltanin-Thar p Fracture Zone systems).  

SSTs seasonally vary between ${\sim}3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (July–September) and ${\sim}7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (January–March). The area is located west of the main Antarctic Intermediate and Mode Water formation regions in the ESP. The 360 4 m water depth places Site U1541 within LCDW (Figure F14).  

The main objectives at Site U1541 were to  

• Recover a moderate-resolution Subantarctic Miocene–Quaternary sediment record close to the SAF;   
• Characterize the stratigraphy of calcareous and siliceous oozes, allowing for a wide range of paleoceanographic reconstructions;   
• Reconstruct high-amplitude Subantarctic SSTs based on multiple proxies;   
• Investigate long-term changes in dust input;   
• Provide a record of LCDW and potential influence of AABW during glacial periods;   
• Reconstruct productivity (opal versus carbonate), nutrient distribution, and dust-productivity coupling; and   
• Recover a potential far-field record of WAIS variability.  

# Operations  

During the transit to Site U1541, rough weather systems move d in, causing high seas at the site location. Therefore, upon reachin g the site coordinates at ${\sim}2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 June 2019, the vessel continued at reduced speed on a $245^{\circ}$ weather avoidance course for another ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{nmi}$ past the site. At $2105\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 June, the sea state ha d sufficiently calmed down to turn the ship around and head back.

We completed the sea voyage and arrived at Site U1541 at 073 6 h on 17 June. We lowered the thrusters and the vessel was place d over the site coordinates and on dynamic positioning mode by 082 0 h. Soon after, the drill crew started to build the APC/XCB BHA an d to lower the drill string to the seafloor.  

By $1815\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 June, the drill bit was lowered to 3597 mbrf, $5\;\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor depth calculated by the onboard PDR. We attempted to spud Hole U1541A, but the first core came up empty. Thre e more attempts followed with the bit at 3602, 3607, and 3617 mbrf before we successfully recovered any sediment. Finally, we spudded Hol e U1541A at $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 June. Core 1H recovered $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, indicating a missed mudline, and we ended the hole at that point.  

The bit was raised to 3612.0 mbrf, and Hole U1541B was spudded at $0055~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 June. Based on the recovery in Core 1H, th e seafloor was calculated at $3614.4\,\mathrm{mbrf}$ (or 3603.7 mbsl). Coring continued without incident until a partial stroke was recorded on Cor e 15H. When the core was recovered, the APCT-3 tool cutting sho e showed damage, and the driller pulled back the next APC core barrel before it arrived at the bottom. An XCB core barrel was droppe d to attempt Core 16X. After drilling for $45~\mathrm{min}$ and advancing onl y $0.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , the barrel was pulled back on board. Core 16X retrieve d three large pebble-sized basalt pieces $\scriptstyle2-5\;\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter) in th e core catcher. The bit was pulled out of the hole, clearing the seafloo r at $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ and ending Hole U1541B.  

A total of 16 cores were taken in Hole U1541B. The APC syste m was used for 15 of these, reaching $138.0\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ before APC refusal and recovering $129.3\;\mathrm{m}$ $(94\%)$ . The XCB system was used fo r one core; it advanced $_{0.5\textrm{m}}$ and recovered $0.06\mathrm{~m~}$ of basalt $(12\%)$ .

The APCT-3 tool was used on Cores 4H, 7H, 11H, and 15H. Misfires were recorded on Cores 1H, 4H, and $6\mathrm{H}$ , and a partial strok e was registered on Core 15H. A total of $25~\mathrm{h}$ were spent in Hol e U1541B.  

The vessel was offset $20\textrm{m}$ east of Hole U1541B, the bit wa s raised to 3608.0 mbrf, and Hole U1541C was spudded at $0325\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 19 June. The hole was deepened with the APC system to $118.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Cores 1H–13H) before coring was terminated at $1805\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 19 June to allow the vessel to evade approaching heavy weather.  

The drill pipe was retrieved, and the rig floor was secured fo r transit at $0204\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June, ending Hole U1541C and Site U1541.  A total of 13 APC cores were taken over a $118.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with a recovery of $100.4\:\mathrm{m}\;(85\%)$ .  

In summary, three holes were cored at Site U1541 using the fulllength APC coring system. Hole U1541A was cored to $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A $^{(9.67\mathrm{~m~})}$ recovered; $101.8\%)$ , Hole U1541B was cored to $138.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A $\left(129.27\:\mathrm{m}\right.$ recovered; $93.3\%$ ), and Hole U1541C was cored t o $118.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A ( $100.37\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $85\%$ ).

# Principal results  

A ${\sim}145\mathrm{~m~}$ spliced sedimentary sequence of Holocene–Miocen e age was recovered at Site U1541 from Holes U1541A–U1541C (Figure F29). The sedimentary sequence includes four lithofacies: carbonate-bearing to carbonate-rich diatom ooze (Lithofacies 2), diatom-bearing to diatom-rich nannofossil/calcareous ooze (Lithofacies 3), nearly pure nannofossil ooze (Lithofacies 4), and claybearing to clayey biogenic ooze (Lithofacies 6) (Figure F30). Base d on the distribution and co-occurrence of the defined lithofacies, w e divided the Site U1541 sedimentary sequence into three lithostratigraphic units. The youngest, Unit I, is divided into two subunits: I A to ${\sim}25\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A $\cdot27\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A) and IB from ${\sim}25$ to ${\sim}63\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A trast to Subunit IIIA. The presence of basalt rock and volcanic glas s fragments at the base of Hole U1541B in Sections 15H-5 and 16XCC suggests the complete recovery of the pelagic sediment sequence above oceanic basement at this site.

All microfossil groups studied on board (diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, benthic and planktonic foraminifers, nannofossils, and ostracods) are present at the site. The preservation of diatoms i s moderate overall. Radiolarians are generally very well preserved except for a few samples. Silicoflagellates are rare to barren throughout the core except for four samples in which they are common t o abundant. Calcareous nannofossils are present in all the samples. They are common to abundant except for a few samples and become dominant in specific nannofossil ooze intervals. Planktoni c and benthic foraminifers and ostracods show good to moderat e preservation in the upper part of Hole U1541B and moderate preservation in the lowermost core catcher samples. Ostracods are particularly abundant in Sample 9H-CC.

The biostratigraphic age model at Site U1541 was mainly base d on analyses from Hole U1541B with additional samples from Hol e U1541C analyzed for diatoms and nannofossils. Split-core sample s were taken in both holes to refine the stratigraphy in the lower hal f of the site. In total, 117 biostratigraphic events were recognized, an d they indicate an estimated age of ${\sim}7.7\mathrm{~Ma}$ at the bottom of bot h holes. The integrated biostratigraphy of diatoms, radiolarians, calcareous nannofossils, and planktonic foraminifers showed no majo r hiatuses at Site U1541, suggesting a continuous sequence of lat e Miocene to Holocene sediments.  

Paleomagnetic measurements indicate a number of polarit y changes that are best illustrated by downhole changes in inclination. These capture a series of apparent polarity reversals that are consistent between Holes U1541B and U1541C, where they overlap and together provide a long and almost continuous record of polarit y change over the past 8 My (Figure F31). The Matuyama/Brunhes an d upper/lower Jaramillo polarity boundaries, which define the uppe r part of the Matuyama Chron (C1r.1r and C1r.1n), were observed. Most reversal boundaries from the Olduvai Chron (C2n) to Chro n C4r.1n (8.254 Ma) are generally well characterized. The record of inclination and intensity after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization for th e splice composite record allows polarity interpretations and correlation to the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS; Cande and Kent, 1995). Only the boundaries associated with the reversed polarity intervals of the Gauss Chron (C2An) (Kaena and Mountain) and th e

We analyzed samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bulk sediment chemistry at a resolution of three per cor e from 0 to $9.5\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hole U1541A and 0 to $138.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A i n Hole U1541B and two per core from 0 to $32.6\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hol e U1541C. Methane concentrations are low at this site overall, neve r exceeding 3.47 ppmv. Ethane and propane remain below detectio n limit throughout the entire hole.  

Alkalinity and pH decrease with depth starting around $80\,\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF}}.$ - A. Interstitial water iron concentration deeper than $^{86\textrm{m}}$ CSF- A drops below detection limits, and interstitial water manganese concentration drops below detection limits deeper than $105.05\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

Calcium carbonate content is relatively high at this site; it neve r falls below $21.6\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ and has a downhole average content of $68.6\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Calcium carbonate content shows a good correlation with sedimen t color reflectance parameter $L^{\ast}$ and RGB blue data (Figure F32). TO C contributes a maximum of $0.8\:\mathrm{wt\%}$ to the total carbon pool throughout this site and shows no clear correlation with calcium carbonat e content. TN is very low at this site, never exceeding $0.06\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

The bulk sediment elemental composition shows marked increase in concentrations toward the bottom at $135.85\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , indicating interaction between basement rocks and the sediment. Oxide contents of magnesium, potassium, iron, silica, and titaniu m co-vary strongly with aluminum oxides, suggesting that these elements are present primarily in clay minerals. High coherency between the downhole calcium and strontium concentration pattern s suggests that strontium is incorporated in biogenic carbonate.  

Physical property data acquired from whole-round measurements are generally in good agreement with those from split-cor e measurements for MS loop and point measurements. GRA bul k density and $P$ -wave logger (PWL) velocity values indicate shorte r term variations in Lithostratigraphic Unit I and at the top of Unit II, and the shortest term variations at the top of Unit II and in Subuni t IB are probably linked to $40~\mathrm{ky}$ cycles in the early Pleistocene. M S shows both high amplitude and large timescale variability all alon g the record. GRA bulk density shows higher values in Unit II an d Subunit IIIB, corresponding to a higher fraction of carbonate/nannofossils compared to diatoms, whereas MS and NGR show highe r values in Subunit IIIA likely linked to higher terrigenous content.  

Downhole changes in physical property characteristics overal l are in good agreement with the defined lithofacies (Figure F33) bu t show different relationships with one another compared to Site s U1539 and U1540 in intervals of low diatom content.

combination of measurements was used. We constructed a splic e from 0 to $127.254\:\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A using three holes; however, because o f some disturbed cores or cores that were too short to be used, th e splice contains two gaps. Because Hole U1541B was drilled deepe r than either of the other holes, the last two cores in Hole U1541 B were appended to the bottom of the splice.  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic age markers. These data suggest that th e sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1541 covers the past ${\sim}8$ My (Figure F34). Though substantially lower than at Site U1539 an d U1540, sedimentation rates at Site U1541 average $2.7\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ downhole to $\sim\!3\mathrm{~Ma}$ and decrease to ${\sim}1.3\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during most of the Pliocene and late Miocene. This age model is generally consistent wit h preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed on board based o n physical property data such as color measurements (RGB blue) an d GRA bulk density.  

The combination of nearly continuous recovery, medium-tohigh sedimentation rates primarily driven by calcareous and diato m productivity during glacial periods, clear patterns in physical properties and sediment color, and a rich array of well-preserved calcareous  microfossils  combined  with  diatoms  will  provid e unprecedented opportunities for improving our understanding o f the dynamics of the ACC and its link to global carbon cycle change s at orbital timescales back into the late Miocene. Site U1541 wil l therefore provide a crucial Miocene-to-present perspective on th e evolution of the ACC system, and its climate impact and will complement higher resolution paleoclimate reconstructions based o n Sites U1539 and U1540, which cover the period from the Pliocen e to present.  

# Site U1542  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1542 (Proposed Site CHI-4B) is located at the Chile continental margin in the ESP at $52^{\circ}42.2917^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $75^{\circ}35.76915^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{nmi}$ west of the entrance of the Strait of Magellan at $1101\;\mathrm{m}$ water dept h (Figure F35). North of ${\sim}53^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , subduction in the Chile Trench i s more orthogonal and results in a steep slope incised by canyons tha t run perpendicular to the trench axis. Recent sediment cover is minor at the lower slope, but a relatively small-scale sediment depocenter  (“sediment  drift”)  has  been  identified  at  the  uppe r continental slope where Site U1542 is located.  

Site U1542 is located on MCS Line AWI-20160511 ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ north of the intersection with Line AWI-20160513 (Figure F36A ) (Lamy, 2016). The seismic cross-lines indicate sediments as thick a s ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ above continental basement. The basement age of the drif t is unknown; a maximum age of ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ can be derived from the en d of the tectonic erosion and start of subsidence at the continental margin (Polonia et al., 2007). Sediments are mostly well stratifie d with slightly irregular reflectors. Low to moderately reflecting layer s become stronger below ${\sim}350\,\mathrm{~m~}$ sediment depth. Sediment ech o sound (Parasound) profiles (Lamy, 2016) reveal moderate penetration $\left(\sim\!50\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering (Figure F36B), suggesting a succession  of  fine-  to  medium-grained  sediments  with  varyin g lithologic composition.  

Site U1542 is located underneath the southward-flowing CHC , a northern branch of the ACC that continues toward the Drake Passage and provides a major fraction of the present-day norther n Drake Passage transport (Well and Roether, 2003). Satellite-tracke d surface drifters reveal that after crossing the EPR, Subantarctic surface water of the ACC is transported northeastward across the ES P toward the Chile coast at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , $75^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ (Figures F2, F37). Here, presently only a minor part of ACC water is deflected northward int o the HCS, whereas the major fraction is deviated southward towar d the Drake Passage. The CHC thus transports a significant amoun t of northern ACC water toward the Drake Passage in a narro w ${\sim}100{-}150~\mathrm{km}$ wide belt along the coast (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005) (Figures F2, F37). Modern surface current velocities in th e CHC reach $>\!35\ \mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s},$ , and high flow speeds of ${\sim}20~\mathrm{cm/s}$ extend t o middepths (Boisvert, 1969; Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005).  

Site U1542 is located at the lower limit of AAIW and lies close t o or within the major modern AAIW formation area in the ESP (e.g., Bostock et al., 2013). CDW underlies AAIW in this region (Figur e F38). The area off the Strait of Magellan is located ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ latitud e north of the present SAF. Modern mean annual SST in this area i s ${\sim}8^{\circ}C_{\iota}$ , and the seasonal range is ${\sim}3^{\circ}C$ .  

The main objectives at Site U1542 were to  

• Recover Pleistocene paleoceanographic records over the past several glacial–interglacial cycles with suborbital-scale resolution,   
• Reconstruct the strength of the CHC (Subantarctic ACC) before entering the Drake Passage,   
• Investigate AAIW and CDW water mass properties,   
• Investigate changes of continental paleoclimate, and

Four holes were cored at Site U1542 using the full-length AP C coring system: U1542A $_{0-169.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ CSF-A; $181.74\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $107\%$ ), U1542B ( $0{-}1.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A; $1.46~\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $104\%$ ), U1542 C $0{-}213.7\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A; $225\;\mathrm{m}$ cored and $236.9\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $105\%$ ), an d U1542D (0–234 m CSF-A; $202.7\mathrm{~m~}$ cored and $205.4\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $101\%$ ).  

# Transit to Site U1542  

At $0236\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June 2019, the vessel got underway at full spee d northeast of Site U1541 to avoid heavy weather headed toward th e

operational area. Taking advantage of the transit, we deployed th e towed magnetometer. The vessel continued transiting on a northeasterly course for $1109\ \mathrm{nmi}$ over 4.7 days until $1845~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 Jun e when sea conditions allowed us to turn south towards our operational area at the southwest Chilean margin. During the northwar d transit on 21 June, we passed just $120\ \mathrm{nmi}$ east of Point Nemo,  a remote ocean location that is the most distant from a coastline o n our planet.  

At $1845~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 June, we set a southeast course toward Proposed Site CHI-1C, located at the southernmost Chilean margi n close to the Pacific entrance of the Drake Passage. This provided th e best ability to change course for Site U1542 or U1543 if the weathe r improved over those sites first. We continued on this course until $1230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 June, covering $873\;\mathrm{nmi},$ , when a strong system of hig h winds and seas was predicted to begin moving across the transi t path and into the Chilean margin operational area, forcing us t o

At $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 July, the weather system we were monitoring ha d moved past our projected course and subsided enough over the operational area in the Chilean margin resume transit for the remaining $575\;\mathrm{nmi}$ . The thrusters were raised, and we resumed navigatio n at $1330~\mathrm{h}$ on a $122^{\circ}$ southeast course to the southwest margin o f Chile. At $1345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 July, we adjusted the heading to $109^{\circ}$ southeas t for Site U1542.  

# Hole U1542A  

We arrived at Site U1542 at $1948\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 July 2019. The thruster s were lowered, and the vessel switched into dynamic positionin g mode by $2030~\mathrm{h}$ . An APC/XCB BHA was made up and lowered t o the seafloor. Based on a PDR reading of 1111.4 mbrf, an APC shooting depth of 1108.4 mbrf was chosen, and Hole U1542A was spudded at $0215\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 4 July. Core 1H retrieved $7.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment, determining the seafloor depth at 1110.8 mbrf (or $1099.8\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ ).  

APC coring continued until $165.6~\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Cores 383- U1542A-1H through 19H), when the core barrel became detache d from the sinker bars during retrieval. The core barrel fell ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ back to the landing seat. Three attempts were needed to finally retrieve the barrel. Once at the surface, we found that only $1.05\mathrm{~m~}$ o f core was recovered, and we decided to switch to the HLAPC syste m to deepen the hole. The HLAPC system was used for one core, recording a partial stroke and recovering $3.91\textrm{m}$ before the hole wa s abandoned because of high seas and winds. The bit was pulled t o $1033\;\mathrm{mbrf},$ , clearing the seafloor at $2359\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 July and ending Hol e U1542A. A total of 20 APC and HLAPC cores were taken over  a $169.5\:\mathrm{m}$ interval, recovering $181.74\;\mathrm{m}\;(107.2\%)$ .  

Nonmagnetic core barrels and the core orientation tool wer e used on all cores. Formation temperature was measured on Core s 383-U1542A-4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, and 16H. Partial strokes were recorded on Cores 10H–13H and 16H–21F. The total time spent i n Hole U1542A was $27.5\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.1 days).  

# Hole U1542B  

The vessel waited on the seas and winds to calm from $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ t o $1545~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 July 2019 with the bit set at $1033{\mathrm{~mbrf}}.$ . The vessel wa s then offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1542A, the bit was lowered to 1104. 0 mbrf, and Hole U1542B was spudded at $1745~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 July. Core 1 H recovered only $1.46\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, and because of the low recover y and quality of the core we decided to obtain a better mudline core, so Hole U1542B was abandoned.  

# Hole U1542C  

The vessel stayed at the same coordinates, and the bit was lowered to $1105.0\;\mathrm{mbrf}.$ . Hole U1542C was spudded at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 Jul y 2019. Based on the recovery from Core 1H $\left(3.3\:\mathrm{m}\right)$ , the seafloor wa s calculated at 1111.2 mbrf $1100.2\ \mathrm{mbsl})$ . APC coring continued t o $169.3\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with Core 20H. While running in with the core barrel for Core 21H, the Captain terminated operations because of hig h currents and winds. When the core barrel was retrieved, it wa s found that the pins had sheared and $3.57\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core had been retrieved for an advance of ${3.0}\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

At $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 July, the bit was pulled to $71.8\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and th e top drive was set back to wait on weather with the bit in the hole. The crew continued to wait on weather until the seas subsided a t $1630~\mathrm{h}$ . The top drive was picked up, the hole was washed to th e bottom by $1815~\mathrm{h},$ and coring continued with Cores 383-U1542C22H through 28H to $226.0\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at midnight on 6 July.  

A total of 26 cores were taken over a $217.0\ \mathrm{m}$ interval with tw o $4.5\textrm{m}$ drilled intervals $\mathrm{~\leftmoon~m~}$ total drilled). A total of $228.91\;\mathrm{m}$ wa s recovered $106\%$ recovery). Nonmagnetic core barrels were use d with all cores, and the core orientation tool was removed after Cor e 383-U1542C-20H. A misfire was recorded on Core 8H, and partia l strokes were recorded on Cores $10\mathrm{H}$ , 12H, 13H, 16H, 17H, an d 20H–28H.  

# Hole U1542D  

The vessel was offset $_{20\textrm{m}}$ south of Hole U1542C, and the bi t was spaced out to 1107 mbrf. Hole U1542D was spudded at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 July 2019. Based on recovery from Core 1H, seafloor was calculated at 1111.7 m CSF-A $[1100.7\;\mathrm{mbrf}]$ . The hole then was cored t o a total depth of 213.7 m CSF-A using the full-length APC system, and three intervals were drilled without recovery over a total of 11. 0 m to help eliminate gaps in core coverage between holes. Afte r reaching total depth, the bit was recovered to the surface, clearin g the seafloor at $0245~\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table at $0545~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 July. Th e BHA was racked back in the derrick, and the rig floor was secure d for transit at $0555~\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel was switched from dynamic positioning to cruise mode at $0558\ \mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1542D and Sit e U1542.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used on all cores, but no orientation or temperature measurements were taken. Partial stroke s were recorded on Cores 383-U1542D-10H and $12\mathrm{H}{-}27\mathrm{H}$ . A total o f 24 cores were taken over a $202.7\:\mathrm{m}$ interval with $205.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of recover y $(101.2\%)$ . Three drilled intervals were used following Core 12H, 22H, and 24H. The hole was advanced by recovery on all partia l strokes.  

# Principal results  

A ${\sim}249\,\mathrm{~m~}$ spliced sedimentary sequence of Holocene–middl e Pleistocene age was recovered at Site U1542 from Holes U1542A– U1542D (Figure F39). It comprises five lithofacies, one of which wa s identified at previous Expedition 383 sites in the central South Pacific (nannofossil ooze; Lithofacies 4). New lithofacies includ e clayey silt to silty clay (Lithofacies 8), carbonate- and/or sand-bearing clayey to sandy silt (Lithofacies 9), foraminifers and sand - and/or clay-bearing silty nannofossil ooze (Lithofacies 10), and san d (Lithofacies 11). Site U1542 is characterized by exceptionally hig h sedimentation rates that exceed $30~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . The entire recovere d sedimentary sequence $\left(\sim\!249\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ can be described as one lithostratigraphic unit (Unit I) that covers the middle Pleistocene to Holocen e interval. Sediments at Site U1542 are of siliciclastic nature. The sedimentary sequence at this site is dominated by dark gray to dar k greenish gray clayey silts or silty clays, whereas thin beds of ligh t greenish gray to light gray nannofossil ooze occur infrequently (Figure F40). Below $50\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , intervals as thick as $3\;\mathrm{m}$ of interbedded clayey silt and sand appear recurrently. In addition, thin, ligh t gray, foraminifer-bearing calcareous ooze, clay-bearing silty nannofossil ooze, and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze were observe d below $95\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ .  

Diatoms and radiolarians are rare throughout the sediment succession, silicoflagellates are absent, nannofossils are few to barren, benthic and planktonic foraminifers are abundant, and ostracod s are sparsely present in some intervals at the site. The biostratigraphic age model for Site U1542 was mainly based on biostratigraphic analyses of core catcher and split-core samples from Hol e U1542A (0–169 m CSF-A) and the bottom of Hole U1542C (172.3–  

$234.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). In total, eight biostratigraphic events were recognized that indicate an estimated age of ${\sim}0.7$ Ma at the bottom o f Hole U1542C.  

The NRM of the archive-half sections of Site U1542 was measured and remeasured after alternating field (AF) demagnetizatio n at $2\ \mathrm{cm}$ increments. In general, the number of demagnetizatio n steps reflect  

• The desire for more steps to study the magnetization(s), • The severity of the drill string and natural overprints that hopefully can be removed to recover the natural remanence, • The desire to use low peak fields to preserve the magnetization for future shore-based studies, and • The need to maintain core flow through the laboratory.  

After demagnetization, the intensity correlates with neither M S nor intensity prior to demagnetization, suggesting that the larg e drill string overprint was successfully removed and a geomagneti c signal was recovered. Inclinations are steep and positive prior to demagnetization and steep and negative after, suggesting, as with th e intensity data, that a vertical $\left(+z\right)$ drill string magnetic overprint wa s removed, giving way to a primary remanence that varies around expected directions $(-69^{\circ})$ for the site latitude during normal polarity. The NRM after $15\;\mathrm{mT}$ shows no evidence for reversed polarity, suggesting that Site U1542 sediments are younger than 0.781 M a (Hilgen et al., 2012). Shore-based studies will verify these interpretations and further develop these sediments as geomagnetic recorders,  providing  information  on  field  intensity  and  directional variability while facilitating the next iteration in magnetic stratigraphy.  

Routine safety hydrocarbon measurements were collected a t Site U1542 in headspace gastight vials at a resolution of approximately one $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sample per core for Holes U1542A and U1542 C $^{\left(5.98-230.99\mathrm{~m~}\right.}$ CSF-A). Methane concentrations increase rapidl y from 4.39 ppmv at $5.98\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to 60,786 ppmv at $60.66\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and decrease gradually to 5,667 ppmv at $230.99\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Ethan e occurs from 60.66 to $100.77\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and from $128.04\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A t o the bottom of Hole U1542C. The strong degassing of sediments after coring produced many cracks and affected the core quality a t Site 1542.  

The interstitial water chemistry at this site is influenced by anaerobic organic matter remineralization. As oxygen is depleted wit h depth by respiration, nitrate, manganese, and iron serve as terminal electron acceptors in organic matter remineralization. Sulfate reduction  occurs  when  other  electron  acceptors  become  consumed/unavailable,  and once sulfate  is  completely consumed, methanogenesis becomes the primary remineralization pathway. A t this site, sulfate reduction predominates in the shallow sedimen t and the sulfate–methane transition zone likely occurs at $\mathrm{\sim}9\,\mathrm{m}$ CSFA. This is not unusual for continental margin sediments and i s probably due to the fact that Site U1542 lies in a high productivit y zone supported by abundant supply of nutrients from continental runoff.  

Calcium carbonate content is very low at this site with the exception of two peaks of 39.2 and $80.0~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at 97.22 and $125.57\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, respectively. The carbonate record shows no correlatio n with reflectance $L^{\ast}$ and RGB blue data. Organic carbon contribute s a maximum of $0.67\mathrm{~wt}\%$ to the total carbon pool throughout thi s site. TN is very low, never exceeding $0.05~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and low concentrations yield poor reproducibility of samples because of the detectio n limit of the instrument.

Physical property data acquired from whole-round measure- X-ray fluorescence scanning and manual inspection of MS will clarments for Site U1542 are generally in good agreement with thos e ify this further. The applied manual processing to all Site U154 2 from split-core measurements; however, at this site considerabl e holes based on the whole-round WRMSL/Special Task Multisenso r offsets in many individual section depths exist through all holes du e Logger (STMSL) log sheets provided sufficiently “clean” data fo r to ongoing expansion of sediment between whole-round loggin g GRA bulk density, MS, and NGR but yielded data loss of about $8\%-$ and splitting the cores.

surements largely failed for Site U1542 because of core expansio n and related cracking of the sediment.  

At this site, the downhole changes in the physical property dat a weakly correspond with the defined lithofacies (Figure F41) base d on sediment characteristics. Higher MS and GRA bulk density values correspond to the hemipelagic composition and higher lithogenic input to the sedimentary matrix at Site U1542, but thes e parameters exhibit different relationships with one in intervals o f low diatom content another compared to previous Sites U1539 an d U1540.  

The higher complexity of this hemipelagic site in terms of sediment delivery mechanisms is reflected in the acquired physica l properties of Site U1542. The predominantly terrigenous sedimen t supply likely is composed of multiple processes such as ice and glacial meltwater transport as well as dust and current-induced latera l material transport and sorting after deposition, all influenced b y various forcing such as climate and glacier mass balance changes, associated sea level changes, and dynamic changes in middept h ocean circulation that affects the transport direction and strengt h on both orbital and short (sub)millennial timescales.  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic age markers. These data suggest that the sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1542 covers the past ${\sim}0.7$ My (Figur e F42) with sedimentation rates averaging $37\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ .  

The combination of nearly continuous recovery, very high sedimentation rates in a sediment drift primarily driven by siliciclasti c sediment input during glacials, and, though diluted, a rich array o f calcareous microfossils combined with diatoms will provide unprecedented opportunities for improving our understanding of th e dynamics of the northern ACC before entering the Drake Passage, variations of the CHC, intermediate water mass circulation, and PI S variability.

Site U1543  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1543 (Proposed Site ESP-1B) is located in the ESP a t $54^{\circ}35.06^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $76^{\circ}40.59^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ ${\sim}110\ \mathrm{nmi}$ west of the Chile coast and ${\sim}120$ nmi south-southwest of Site U1542 at ${\sim}3860\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figur e F43). The site is situated west of the Chile Trench on a topographically elevated ridge ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ above the trench axis ( ${\sim}4200\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth) (Figure F44A). The basement at this location is oceanic crus t older than ${\sim}20\,M\mathbf{a}$ (Eagles, 2006).  

Site U1543 lies at the intersection of two seismic lines with  a sediment thickness of $600{-}700\,\mathrm{m}$ . MCS Line AWI-20160501 lies ${\sim}1$ nmi southwest of the intersection with Line AWI-20160503 (Figur e F44A) (Lamy, 2016). Sediments are mostly well stratified with onl y slightly irregular reflectors. Sediment cover is drape-type and en

Sediment echo sound (Parasound) profiles (Lamy, 2016) revea l moderate penetration $\left({\sim}70\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering (Figure F44B), suggesting a succession of fine-grained sediments with varying lithologic composition.

Satellitetracked surface drifters reveal that after crossing the EPR, Subantarctic surface water of the ACC is transported northeastward across th e ESP toward the Chile coast at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , $75^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ (Figures F2, F37). Here, presently only a minor part of ACC water is deflected northward int o the HCS, and the major fraction is deviated southward toward th e  

Site U1543 is located at the offshore reach of the southward-flowing CHC, a northern branch of the ACC that continues toward th e

Drake Passage. The CHC thus transports a significant amount o f northern ACC water toward the Drake Passage in a narrow $\mathord{\sim}100\mathord{-}150$ km wide belt along the coast (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005) (Figure s F2, F37). Modern surface current velocities in the CHC reach ${>}35$ $\mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s}$ at the continental margin (Site U1542) but decrease offshore toward Site U1543 (Boisvert, 1969; Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005).

Site U1543 is presently located at the lower limit of LCDW an d might have been affected by AABW in the past (Figure F38). Th e site is located ${\sim}4^{\circ}$ latitude north of the present SAF. Modern mea n annual SST in this area is ${\sim}8.5^{\circ}C,$ and the seasonal range is ${\sim}3^{\circ}C$ .  

The main objectives at Site U1543 were to  

• Recover a Pliocene–Pleistocene undisturbed, continuous sediment record with medium high sedimentation rates;   
• Reconstruct the strength of the CHC (Subantarctic ACC) before entering the Drake Passage;   
• Investigate AABW, CDW, and Pacific Deep Water (PDW) water mass properties;   
• Investigate changes of continental paleoclimate; and   
• Recover a potential far-field record of PIS variability over the past several million years.  

# Operations  

The R/V JOIDES Resolution completed the 119 nmi transit fro m Site U1542 to Site U1543 at $1717~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 July 2019 after travelin g $10.5~\mathrm{h}$ and averaging 11.3 knots. A water depth reading using th e PDR set the preliminary seafloor depth at 3877.4 mbrf for Hol e U1543A. The operations plan for Site U1543 initially included thre e holes to $400\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. This plan was modified because of time los t to weather during the expedition, shallowing the penetration dept h to $250~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A for each hole. While coring Hole U1543A, it wa s decided to continue deepening the hole until APC refusal and t o only core two holes to APC refusal at this site.  

# Hole U1543A  

Hole U1543A was spudded at $0325~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 July 2019, and Cor e 1H recovered $7.1\textrm{m}$ . Core recovery determined a seafloor depth o f

$3863.4~\mathrm{{mbsl}}$ . Soon after, at $0415\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , coring operations were suspended when one of the ship’s main propulsion shafts was shu t down because of mechanical problems. The engineers found  a faulty shaft brake unit. The brake was taken out of service, and th e shaft was repaired and brought back online by $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ . At that point, coring resumed and continued without interruption through 11 Jul y in good weather and sea conditions. Coring was terminated afte r 90,000 lb of overpull were needed to retrieve Core 36H from 339. 6 m CSF-A. The drill string was pulled out of the hole, clearing th e seafloor at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 July. Overall, 36 cores were taken with $103\%$ recovery.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used on all cores. The core orientation tool was used in most cores except for 383-U1543A-8H, 14H, 16H, 17H, 24H–29H, and 32H–36H. Formation temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 tool on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, 16H, and 19H. Partial strokes were recorded on Cores 32H– 36H. The total time spent in Hole U1543A was $73.2\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.05 days).  

# Hole U1543B  

The vessel was offset $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ east of Hole U1543A, and Hol e U1543B was spudded at $2010\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 July 2019. The seafloor dept h was calculated at 2876.4 mbrf $(3865.3\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ based on the recover y from Core 1H. Hole U1543B was cored entirely with the APC system, and two drilled intervals were used to cover coring gaps between Holes U1543A and U1543B. The first drilled interval $\left(1.9\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ followed Core 1H, and the second drilled interval $\left(1.5\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ followe d  

Core 23H. Core 33H reached a total depth of $286.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Overall, 31 cores were taken over a $283.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $104\%$ recovery.  

The bit was retrieved to the surface, clearing the seafloor at 180 0 h on 13 July and the rotary table at $0045~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 July. The rig floo r was secured for transit at $0110~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , and JOIDES Resolution bega n transiting to Site U1544.  

A total of 31 cores were taken over a $283.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval. A total o f $294.97\,\mathrm{~m~}$ was recovered $104.2\%$ recovery). Two intervals wer e drilled without recovery for a total of $3.4\;\mathrm{m}$ . Nonmagnetic core barrels were used with all cores, and the core orientation tool was no t used. Partial strokes were recorded on Cores 383-U1543B-31 H through 33H. The liners of Cores 3H, 14H, 20H, 21H, 25H, an d 31H–33H shattered on the catwalk after holes were drilled to release formation gas.  

# Principal results  

Site U1543 consists of a $376.3~\mathrm{m}$ spliced sedimentary sequenc e (Figure F45, F46). The sedimentary record comprises five lithofacies (Figure F46) identified at previous Expedition 383 sites. Thes e include major biogenic lithologies (nannofossil ooze [Lithofacies 4]; clay-bearing to clayey diatom ooze [Lithofacies 6]); and diatom-, clay-, and/or silt-bearing to rich nannofossil or calcareous ooz e [Lithofacies 10]) and mainly siliciclastic sediments (diatom-bearin g to rich clay [Lithofacies 7] and silt-bearing clay to clay-bearing sil t [Lithofacies 8]). The biogenic lithofacies were first characterized i n the central South Pacific, whereas the pure siliciclastic sedimentar y lithofacies were observed at northern Chilean margin Site U1542. Their definition is expanded according to the varieties of lithofacie s observed at this site. The sedimentary sequence at Site U1543 i s characterized by moderate average sedimentation rates of ${\sim}5$ $\mathrm{{cm/ky.}}$ Site U1543 comprises two lithostratigraphic units, Unit I $\left(0-\right.$ 115.5 m CCSF-A) and Unit II (115.5–376.5 m CCSF-A), that cove r the early Pleistocene to Holocene and late Miocene to early Pleistocene intervals, respectively. Unit I largely consists of greenish gra y to dark greenish gray silt-bearing clay (Lithofacies 8) that contain s prominent $10{-}30~\mathrm{cm}$ thick beds of light gray to light greenish gra y carbonate-, clay-, and/or diatom-rich nannofossil ooze. Below 11 5 m CCSF-A, the abundance of diatomaceous sediments increases, mostly in the form of diatom-bearing silty clay (Lithofacies 7) an d carbonate and silt-bearing diatom ooze (Lithofacies 6). The latte r often occurs in association with decimeter-scale beds of nannofossil ooze. Diatom mats and dropstones are rare, and burrows and mottling due to diagenetic overprints are frequent. Lithification, secondary carbonate precipitation, and microfracturing increasingl y occur below $275\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ .  

A sediment succession of Holocene to Late Miocene age was recovered at Site U1543. Diatoms and radiolarians are abundan t throughout the sediment succession, silicoflagellates are absent t o few but locally abundant, nannofossil abundance varies strongl y with good preservation, benthic and planktonic foraminifers are absent in glacials and moderately preserved when present, and ostracods are rarely present at the site and restricted to Miocen e samples. Biostratigraphic analyses of Hole U1543A core catcher an d split-core samples allowed the recognition of 56 biostratigraphi c events that indicate an estimated age of 7.3–8.5 Ma at the bottom o f the hole.  

The NRM of the archive-half sections of Site U1543 was measured and remeasured after AF demagnetization at $2\ \mathrm{cm}$ increments. In general, the number of demagnetization steps reflects  

![](images/3fa619f955ce6db34f5b5f0f9a6e2e2592fb9a41a1e503f98eaa800addf41f67.jpg)  
• The desire for more steps to study the magnetization(s), • The severity of the drill string and natural overprints that hopefully can be removed to recover the natural remanence, • The desire to use low peak fields to preserve the magnetization for future shore-based studies, and  

• The need to maintain core flow through the laboratory.  

The intensities before and after demagnetization for the uppe r $140\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of cores recovered from Hole U1543A are generally quit e strong, varying around the $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ range. A few discret e  

![](images/1c52c8b89b63f1e6acdcfdaf07945f4b81f2a6a24c1dfd191d35ca1a13a15717.jpg)  
intervals have values as low as $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ and are generally associate d with MS lows. Below $140\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, intensities are slightly lower o n average, falling to $\leq\!10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Below $240\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, intensities ar e more variable and values in the $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ range are muc h more common. Compared with previous sites, there is little difference in intensity before and after demagnetization at a peak AF o f  

$15~\mathrm{mT_{i}}$ , suggesting a finer magnetic mineralogy with a higher coercivity that is less susceptible to the drill string overprint.  

The inclination for Holes U1543A and U1543B before and afte r AF demagnetization at $15~\mathrm{mT}$ captures a series of apparent polarit y reversals, either directly observed or inferred from polarity change s between cores, and when observed within a section the reversals ar e generally well defined and many times reproduced. Their position s in Hole U1543A are illustrated in Figure F47. All polarity boundaries from the Matuyama/Brunhes at 0.781 Ma through Chro n C3Br.2r at $7.285\:\mathrm{Ma}$ , 31 polarity reversals in total, are either directl y observed or closely constrained and correlated to the GPTS (Cand e and Kent, 1995; Hilgen et al., 2012). Reversed and normal polarit y associated with the base of Chron C3B and the upper part of Chro n C4 (older than 7.432 Ma) were observed, but the boundaries are no t constrained in the deepest cores in Hole U1543A. Shore-base d studies will refine correlations to the GPTS and facilitate development of relative paleointensity as the next steps in magnetic stratigraphy at Site U1543.

Routine safety hydrocarbon measurements were collected a t Site U1543 in headspace gastight vials at a resolution of approximately one $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sample per core from 5.99 to $337.63\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Methane concentrations remain very low at this site, ranging from  4 to 17 ppmv. Propene occurs at a low concentration of $0.5~\mathrm{ppm}$ a t $280.67\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and concentrations of ethene, ethane, and propane remain below detection limit.  

Biologically mediated anaerobic oxidation of organic matter i s evidenced in the interstitial water by the presence of reduced iro n and manganese, high alkalinity and ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , and high ammonium concentrations. Farther downcore, interstitial water chemistry may b e additionally impacted by oxidative processes either deep in the cor e or below the cored depth with upward diffusion. This is demonstrated by decreases in ammonium and increases in sulfate wit h depth. The deeper parts of the core show evidence of opal and carbonate dissolution and reprecipitation as well as the interplay of dissolution  and  precipitation  of  iron-  and  manganese-bearin g minerals.  

Calcium carbonate content at this site is low but highly variable , and several peaks fluctuate between 0.1 and $86.8\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . A linear correlation between calcium carbonate contents and RGB blue and reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ data was observed at this site for samples above $1\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F48). Organic carbon concentrations are below $0.43\mathrm{\wt\%}$ , whereas TN concentrations are below $0.048~\mathrm{wt\%}$ .  

Physical property data acquired from whole-round measurements for Site U1543 are generally in good agreement with thos e from split-core measurements. In Unit I, higher MS, bulk density, an d NGR values are positively correlated with sedimentary lithofacie s that have a higher proportion of siliciclastic material (Lithofacies  7 and 8), whereas lower values are associated with sedimentary lithofacies with increased biogenic components (Lithofacies 4, 6, and 10). Although some minima in those physical properties corresponds t o changing lithofacies, the physical properties also record subtl e changes between siliciclastic and biogenic components at high temporal frequency and for long term, likely allowing a precise correlation with isotopic stratigraphy. Furthermore, GRA bulk density an d $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity show different behaviors for increased nannofossi l and diatom presence in Lithofacies 8. Both values decrease for increasing nannofossil content, and GRA bulk density decreases. $P.$ - wave velocities, however, increase with increasing diatom content. I t is thus possible, by combining the different high-resolution physica l property records, GRA bulk density, MS loop, and PWL, to interpre t the large to smaller variations of the records as variations of either diatom or nannofossil content in siliciclastic Lithofacies 8 (Figure F49).

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic age markers. These data suggest that th e sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1543 covers the past ${\sim}8.4$ My (Figure F50). Sedimentation rates are overall relatively constan t and average ${\sim}4.5\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . This age model is generally consistent wit h preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed on board based o n physical property data such as color measurements (RGB blue) an d GRA bulk density.

Overall, the undisturbed continuous sediment record with medium to high sedimentation rates extending into the Miocene recovered at Site U1543 is exceptional. The record is an importan t eastern end-member locality to the CSP sites recovered during Expedition 383 that can be used to evaluate past oceanographic an d climate changes from the late Miocene to the present. The observe d variations in lithology and physical properties are at least in par t driven by glacial–interglacial climate change that consistently impacts the delivery and nature of sediment deposited at Site U1543. The longer term evolution of these depositional processes recorde d at Site U1543 will illuminate the multimillion-year history of PI S growth and retreat, ACC transport, and the underlying climati c conditions in which these processes evolved.

# Site U1544  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1544 (Proposed Site CHI-1C) is located at the Chile continental margin in the ESP at $55^{\circ}32.2192^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $71^{\circ}35.6194^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{nmi}$ southwest off the Chile coast and at ${\sim}2090\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figur e F51).  

Tectonically, the southern Chilean margin is characterized by  a complex geodynamic setting with oblique convergence betwee n plates, transcurrent motion, and tectonic rotation on land (Poloni a et al., 2007). The geodynamic setting of the southernmost Chilea n margin is driven by relative movements between three main plates: Antarctica, Scotia, and South America. This complex setting result s in strong segmentation of the southern Chilean margin, which i s clearly visible in bathymetric data and MCS data (Polonia et al., 2007) (Figure F4). There are two major fore-arc basins at ${\sim}53^{\circ}-$ $54.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ and $55^{\circ}{-}56.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ that are characterized by a thick sediment infill of as much as $\sim\!3\;\mathrm{km}$ . Site U1544 is situated close to the axis o f the southern fore-arc basin on the continental crust of the Scoti a plate. This southern basin most likely formed after the ridge consumption $(10{-}14\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . When accretion resumed, it contributed t o an outer high that provided the barrier for the accumulation of continent-derived sediments. The upper unit in the southern basement, relevant for drilling, shows onlap terminations on both basin flanks.  

Site U1544 lies on MCS Line IT95-181 ${\sim}3$ nmi southeast of th e intersection with Profile IT95-171 (Figure F52) (Lamy, 2016). Sediments are mostly well stratified, and sediment cover at the site exceeds $2.5~\mathrm{km}$ . Sediment echo sound (Parasound) profiles (Lamy, 2016) reveal poor to moderate penetration $\left(\sim\!30\,\textrm{m}\right)$ with distinc t layering and an irregular surface, suggesting a succession of fine- t o medium-grained sediments with occasional coarser grained composition.  

Site U1544 is located underneath the southward-flowing CHC, a northern branch of the ACC that continues toward the Drake Passage and provides a major fraction of the present-day norther n Drake Passage transport (Well and Roether, 2003). Satellite-tracke d surface drifters reveal that after crossing the EPR, Subantarctic surface water of the ACC is transported northeastward across the ES P toward the Chile coast at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , $75^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ (Figures F2, F37). Here, presently only a minor part of ACC water is deflected northward int o the HCS, whereas the major fraction is deviated southward towar d the Drake Passage. The CHC thus transports a significant amoun t of northern ACC water toward the Drake Passage within a narro w belt of ${\sim}100{-}150\,\mathrm{km}$ width along the coast (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005) (Figures F2, F37). Modern surface current velocities in th e CHC reach $>\!35\ \mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s},$ , and high flow speeds of ${\sim}20~\mathrm{cm/s}$ extend t o middepths (Boisvert, 1969; Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005).  

Site U1544 is presently located at the lower limit of LCDW an d might have been affected by AABW in the past (Figure F38). Th e site is located ${\sim}4^{\circ}$ north of the present SAF. Modern mean annual SST in this area is ${\sim}8.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and the seasonal range is $3^{\circ}C$ .  

The main objectives at Site U1544 were to  

• Recover Pleistocene paleoceanographic records over the past several glacial–interglacial cycles with suborbital-scale resolution,   
• Reconstruct the strength of the CHC (Subantarctic ACC) before entering the Drake Passage,   
• Investigate CDW and PDW water mass properties,   
• Investigate changes of continental paleoclimate, and   
• Recover a potential near-field record of PIS variability.  

# Operations  

We arrived at Site U1544 at $1746~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 July 2019. Soon afte r arrival, the rig floor crew assembled the APC/XCB BHA and deployed the drill string to the seafloor, reaching 2055 mbrf by midnight.  

The initial attempt to spud Hole U1544A was made at $_{0015}\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 15 July and resulted in a bent/broken APC core barrel, which mad e it necessary to pull the bit back to the rig floor and remove the stuc k portion of the barrel. The vessel was then moved $50\;\mathrm{m}$ southwest a t $225^{\circ}$ to attempt starting Hole U1544A again. Because of a hard laye r below the sediment surface, we used the XCB system to spud th e hole and break through the hard layer.  

Hole U1544A finally was spudded at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 July with th e first core advancing $7.8~\mathrm{m}$ into a softer formation. When the XC B core barrel was retrieved, we found a ${\sim}5~\mathrm{cm}$ granite pebble in th e core catcher. We then deployed the APC system and cored to AP C refusal at $88.1~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The HLAPC system was used to deepe n the hole to the final depth of $106.0~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A before coring was terminated because of high seas and winds. The drill string was pulle d out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0958\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 July and endin g Hole U1544A.

The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1544A with the bit a t 2055 mbrf to wait for the seas to subside so an attempt could b e made to spud Hole U1544B. However, heave was still above $3.5\;\mathrm{m}$ a t $0630~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 July, and operations were terminated. The drill pip e was pulled to the surface, and the vessel was secured for transit b y $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 July, ending Site U1544. A total of 19 cores were take n over a $103.0\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $89\%$ recovery.  

# Principal results  

Site U1544 consists of a $91.3~\mathrm{m}$ sedimentary sequence obtaine d from a single hole (Figure F53). The sedimentary record comprise s four lithofacies (Figure F54), all of which were identified at previou s Expedition 383 sites. They include fine-grained (biosilica-bearin g silty clay [Lithofacies 7] and silty clay [Lithofacies 8]) and coarsegrained (sand [Lithofacies 11]) siliciclastic sediments as well as biogenic sediments (diatom-, clay-, and/or silt-bearing to -rich nannofossil  or  calcareous  ooze  [Lithofacies  10]).  The  sedimentar y sequence in Hole U1544A is dominated by siliciclastic sediment s (Lithofacies 7, 8, and 11), with only sporadic layers of calcareou s ooze. Sedimentation is characterized by highly variable sedimentation rates of $\geq25\ \mathrm{cm/ky},$ and rapidly deposited gravity-driven sedimentation (e.g., turbidities) contributes a significant fraction of th e sedimentary sequence. Hole U1544A sediments make up only on e lithostratigraphic unit in this hole, Unit I $(7.7{-}106.1\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), which covers the late Pleistocene interval. Unit I largely consists o f greenish gray to dark greenish gray silty clay (Lithofacies 8) or biosilica-bearing silty clay (Lithofacies 7) that frequently alternate s with prominent decimeter- to meter-scale dark gray sand layers tha t often have normal grading and erosional boundaries to underlyin g strata. Prominent $<\!1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick beds of light gray to light greenish gra y silt-bearing and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze occur in two intervals at $^{26-28}$ and $80.5–82.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Dropstones are rare, whereas mottling due to diagenetic overprints is minor but frequent. The uppermost core, 383-U1544A-2X, retrieved a singl e hard rock pebble that suggests a rocky and hard substrate close t o the seafloor at this site.

Figure F52. (A) Multichannel seismic (MCS) and (B) Parasound profiles, Sit e U1544.  

Diatoms are rare to abundant throughout the sediment succession, radiolarians and silicoflagellates are absent, nannofossils ar e abundant to barren, benthic and planktonic foraminifers are abundant above ${\sim}85\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and ostracods are sparsely presen t throughout the sequence but abundant at ${\sim}60$ and ${\sim}101\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . The biostratigraphy of Site U1544 is not well constrained because o f the lack of marker species for most fossil groups. Based on the biostratigraphic events recorded, the estimated age is $_{<0.42}$ Ma at th e bottom of Hole U1544A.  

The NRM of archive-half core sections from Site U1544 wa s measured and remeasured after AF demagnetization at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ increments. The intensities prior to demagnetization of cores recovere d from Hole U1544A are relatively strong and generally lie in the $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}\mathrm{A/m}$ range. Inclinations both before and after AF demagnetization at $15~\mathrm{mT}$ are quite variable, reflecting the sandy nature o f these sediments. Fine-grained intervals are often better defined, and steep and positive inclinations prior to demagnetization an d steep and negative inclinations after suggest removal of a drill strin g magnetic overprint giving way to a primary remanence that varie s around expected directions $(-71^{\circ})$ for the site latitude during normal polarity. Although the record is very noisy, no evidence for reliable reversed polarity is observed, suggesting that Site U154 4 sediments are younger than $0.781\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Hilgen et al., 2012).  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic age markers. These data suggest that the sedimentary sequence  recovered  at  Site  U1544  covers  less  than ${\sim}0.4$ My. Sedimentation rates are high and average ${\sim}25\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$  

The low sampling resolution makes it difficult to interpret interstitial water profiles from this site. Low sulfate and high methan e concentrations suggest that the sulfate–methane transition zon e occurs shallower than ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Iversen and Jorgensen, 1985). The high alkalinity indicates that organic matter degradation i s dominated by anaerobic processes, and concentrations of interstitial water iron suggest that microbial iron reduction also occurs a t this site. Because of limited time, only two samples were analyze d for TN and carbon, and observed TN values are among the highes t of all Expedition 383 sites.  

At this site, the downhole changes in physical property characteristics do not show obvious features aligned with the define d lithofacies based on sedimentologic characteristics (Figure F55) . Principally, lower MS and low GRA bulk density values match th e interval of higher biogenic component, but they do not show  a unique relationship with one another throughout the record. Comparing NGR and MS records could provide indications about th e different terrigenous components because they are mainly anticorrelated as at shallow-water Site U1542.  

The close proximity of Site U1544 to the southernmost Chilea n margin explains the dominance of terrigenous sediments at this site. Terrigenous sediment is likely delivered to the site by a combinatio n of ice rafting, suspension fallout from glacial meltwater plume s and/or freshwater plumes that originate from nonglaciated catchments, fine-grained sediments transported by the CHC entering th e Drake Passage as the northern branch of the ACC, and perhap s most importantly, episodic downslope transport from the oute r continental shelf. The large proportion of normally graded san d beds with erosive basal contacts implies that turbidity currents wer e a transport mechanism to carry sediments from the continental shelf and the upper slope during the Pleistocene. We conservativel y estimate the contribution of turbidities as ${\sim}40\%$ based on the thickness of sand layers (Lithofacies 11). However, it is possible that  a certain fraction of the hemipelagic sediments also represents th e uppermost portion of the normal graded turbidite deposition sequence. If so, then turbidites may account for even a larger proportion of the sequence and sedimentation at Site U1544 was ofte n interrupted by gravity-driven flows. Future geochemical and sedimentary analyses will provide crucial insights into the nature an d temporal evolution of sedimentation processes at Site U1544.

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

The overall goal of Expedition 383 was to improve our knowledge of Pliocene–Pleistocene atmosphere-ocean dynamics of th e ACC in the Pacific and their implications for regional and global climate and atmospheric $C O_{2}$ based on sediment records with highes t possible resolution.  

Expedition 383 was very successful. We accomplished drillin g and coring at six of the planned seven sites in the South Pacific. Th e drilling and coring objectives were largely achieved, and a total o f $2636\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered from six sites over a $2649\mathrm{~m~}$ core d interval. This is the first time sedimentary records of this lengt h and, in particular, of this resolution have been recovered from th e South Pacific. We achieved our overall goal of recovering sedimentary sequences to improve our knowledge of Pliocene–Pleistocen e atmosphere-ocean dynamics. Based on extrapolating sedimentatio n rates from the site survey cores and the planned length of the drille d sequences, we expected to reach the early Pliocene $\left({\sim}5\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . At tw o of our sites (U1541 and U1543), we were able to drill continuous sequences that reach back to about $8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , well into the Miocene, thu s exceeding our expectations and allowing an even more complete investigation of the long-term evolution of the climate system in th e South Pacific. The key achievements of the drilling operations include the following:  

• All sequences cored except at Site U1544 are continuous and do not display any shipboard detectable hiatuses.   
• Site U1539 and to a lesser extent Site U1540 have very high sedimentation rates (as high as $30\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ at Site U1539) for a pelagic setting, thus allowing for the first time analyses of climate variability at millennial and submillennial timescales in the Southern Ocean. The sites are complemented by a lower resolution site, U1541, with a remarkably constant sedimentation rate of $2.7\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ downhole to ${\sim}3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and then ${\sim}1.3\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during most of the Pliocene and late Miocene. It provides a continuous paleoclimate record back to the Miocene that is expected to serve as a reference site for the region.   
• Sites U1541 and U1543 provide the longest continuous paleoceanographic records obtained in the Southern Ocean.   
• Even though poor weather prevented the completion of the cross-frontal transect in the central South Pacific, Site U1539, closest to the modern SAF, and Site U1540, ${\sim}170$ nmi north of the SAF, provide pronounced lithologic differences, suggesting strong gradients between both sites, particularly during glacial periods.   
• The recovery of two Miocene to recent cores from the CSP (Site U1541) and the ESP (Site U1543) provides an excellent opportunity to create a comparative zonal transect across the ESP over the past 8 My that can be used to assess ACC variability.  

Despite the drilling success at the six sites, the overall expeditio n experienced two challenges that affected the drilling strategy and, t o some extent, the scientific objectives.  

1. Approval to drill in Chilean waters. By the time we left Punta Arenas on 24 May 2019, we had not obtained approval from the Chilean authorities to conduct drilling and coring operations in their territorial waters. This forced us to change the original operations plan by reordering the sequence of our sites to allow the Chilean authorities more time for approval for the initial sites planned in Chilean waters. We received notice about clearance on 31 May, 1 week into the expedition when we were already well underway to the drill sites in the CSP. The delay in obtain  

ing the permits severely limited our flexibility in planning operations. 2. Weather-related interruptions and adjustments. During the entire expedition, we faced rough weather and sea conditions that impacted our drilling operation and required us to adjust our drilling plans on a continuous basis. Weather-related challenges were anticipated because Expedition 383 was targeting areas of the South Pacific Ocean that are within the range of maximum wind speeds of the SWW. Expedition 383 was scheduled during austral autumn/winter when historical weather records show winds speeds in the Pacific Southern Ocean to be substantially reduced. However, we encountered rough weather and seas above the long-term climatological mean resulting in the loss of substantial operational time. Broadly, the weather-related issues were two different types:  

• Weather and sea conditions on site stopped coring operations and partly prohibited the coring of three full holes per site as originally planned. At most of the sites, we had to interrupt drilling operations because of high seas and resulting high heave. In these cases, we stayed on site, waited until the seas calmed sufficiently, and continued drilling. Such conditions lead to a total of $106\,\mathrm{h}$ of lost drilling time. In addition to the loss of time on site, high heave caused excessive drilling disturbance at some sites and along some intervals of the core. Although minor (on the order of meters), it prevented us from developing composite records completely devoid of gaps and obtaining sufficient material to create multiple copies of the composite sequence. • While drilling at Site U1541 in the central South Pacific, a large-scale $\langle{>}2000\,\mathrm{km}\rangle$ storm system developed in the Southeast Pacific and forced us to transit on a northeast course across the South Pacific on a bad-weather avoidance course. This not only caused a significant loss of time (12.3 days) but also made it impossible to reach one of our targeted sites, Proposed Site CSP-3A, at $60^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ close to the APF. As a result of the bad-weather avoidance, we had to eliminate Site CSP-3A from our expedition plan.  

Despite encountering weather-related challenges, we were successful in mitigating the impacts on the scientific drilling progra m through good time management, intense attention to weather forecasting, and excellent communication with the captain and the operations superintendent.  

# Assessment related to the scientific hypotheses  

Expedition 383 was built around two major scientific hypotheses. Here, we break down the objectives of the expedition in th e context of these two hypotheses and document the achievement s and potential for each hypothesis.  

1. Hypothesis H1: ACC dynamics and Drake Passage throughflow conditioned the global MOC and high-low climate linkages on orbital and submillennial timescales since the Pliocene.  

The Drake Passage is the major geographic constriction for th e ACC and forms an important pathway for the return of upper waters to the Atlantic through the cold-water route of the MOC (Gordon, 1986). Resolving changes in the flow of circumpolar wate r masses through the Drake Passage is crucial for advancing our understanding of the Southern Ocean’s role in affecting ocean and climate  change  on  a  global  scale.  Before  Expedition  383, reconstructions of the throughflow along the Chilean margin wer e limited to the past $60\;\mathrm{ky}$ and no further information was available. We were highly successful in drilling Site U1542, which will exten d this type of record back to the middle Pleistocene. Site U1542 i s complemented by a long and detailed record from Site U1543 in th e ESP that reaches back to the Miocene. The weather conditions a t Site U1543 were extremely favorable for the region and allowed u s to drill two holes deeper than $300\;\mathrm{m}$ without any interruption an d with a minimum of heave-related drilling disturbance. The recor d recovered at this site has an excellent paleomagnetic chronolog y and a pronounced variability in MS that provides a promising stratigraphic tuning target. At the third site in the region, U1544, th e borehole depth had to be shortened to about $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ because o f rough weather and time constraints at the end of the expedition. Accordingly, the record at this site is much shorter and limited t o the last few glacial cycles, but it will prove helpful to evaluate Hypothesis H1 with regard to the last interglacial period, MIS 5, an d potentially MIS 7. However, two fully occupied sites (U1542 an d U1543) provide continuous and very well dated sequences that include relatively highly resolved interglacials and glacial–interglacia l transitions. The two sites together will allow us to address the longterm, orbital-scale, and millennial-scale evolution and variability i n ACC strength and Drake Passage throughflow, particularly i n warmer-than-present interglacials (e.g., MIS 5e, 11, and 31) an d across the Pliocene warm period at Site U1543. We anticipate tha t the recovered material will allow us to fully tackle Hypothesis H 1 and associated research questions beyond the originally propose d Pliocene–Pleistocene timescale to the late Miocene.  

2. Hypothesis H2: Variations in the Pacific ACC determine the physical and biological characteristics of the oceanic carbon pump and atmospheric $C O_{2}$  

Atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere  interactions  and  teleconnections between high and low latitudes play an important role in understanding processes and feedbacks of past and future climat e change, and the Subantarctic Southern Ocean provides the majo r link between Antarctica and the low latitudes. In the Souther n Ocean, these interactions are believed to control sea ice cover, AI S dynamics, upper ocean stratification, biological nutrient utilization, and exposure rates of deep water. They have been considered to pla y a key role in explaining the variability in atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentrations.  

We drilled three excellent sites in the Subantarctic South Pacific, U1539–U1541, that matched or even exceeded our expectations fo r these records in resolution (Site U1539) and covered time perio d (Site U1541). These drill cores from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean will allow us to explore in more detail the glacial–interglacial changes and longer term climate evolution north of the APF. Our drill sites from the CSP (U1539–U1541) will provide robus t data to test to what extent processes described from the Atlanti c sector can be translated to the Pacific sector, thus allowing the construction of a more global picture of the Southern Ocean’s role i n nutrient distribution and biogenic export production and their impact on $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ variations. The cores will enable us to generate key records of SST, dust, export production, and other parameters back t o the Miocene. These reconstructions will provide important benchmarks for a climate-sensitive region that are important constraint s to more realistically model the impact on the ocean carbon cycl e under different climate boundary conditions.  

Unfortunately, we were not able to reach the southern site clos e to the APF zone (Proposed Site CSP-3A) because of persisten t rough weather in the region; therefore, we were not able to complete the cross-frontal transect. The elimination of this key site fro m Expedition 383 has impacts on some aspects of testing Hypothese s H2 and related research questions that target processes in the sout h of the APF as well as comparisons between the Subantarctic an d Antarctic zone.  

At two of the sites (U1540 and U1541) east and west of the EPR , we drilled to the basement of the overlying sediment sequence. Th e lowermost sediments at both sites provide evidence of hydrothermal alteration that may add an unforeseen aspect to the future research at the Expedition 383 sites.  

The potential range of scientific applications for the unique se t of cores drilled during Expedition 383 is very large, encompassin g paleoclimate reconstructions, carbon cycle, evaluation of hydrothermal inputs, geochemistry, reconstruction of ice sheet variability,  land-ocean  interaction,  and  sedimentary  processes.  W e anticipate exciting and impactful results from both the science part y and the scientific community at large for many years to come.
