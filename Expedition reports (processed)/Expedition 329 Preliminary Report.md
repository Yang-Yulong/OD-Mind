# Abstract  

Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 329 made major strides toward fulfilling its objectives. Shipboard studies (1) documented many fundamental aspects of subseafloor sedimentary habitats, metabolic activities, and biomass in this very lowactivity sedimentary ecosystem; (2) significantly improved understanding of how oceanographic factors control variation in subseafloor sedimentary habitats, activities, and biomass from gyre center to gyre margin; (3) quantified the availability of dissolved hydrogen throughout the sediment column; and (4) document first-order patterns of basement habitability and potential microbial activities. A broad range of postexpedition studies will complete the expedition objectives.  

Expedition 329 sites are located along two transects, hinged in the center of the South Pacific Gyre. The first transect progresses from the western edge of the gyre (Site U1365) to the gyre center (Site U1368). The second transect goes from the gyre center (Site U1368) through the southern gyre edge (Site U1370) to the northern edge of the upwelling region south of the gyre (Site U1371).  

# Subseafloor sedimentary habitability and life  

The dominant lithology is zeolitic metalliferous clay at the deeper water sites on older basement (58 to ${\leq}120\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ) within the gyre (Sites U1365, U1366, U1369, and U1370). Manganese nodules occur at the seafloor and intermittently within the upper sediment column at these sites. Chert and porcellanite layers are pronounced in the lower half of the sediment column at Sites U1365 and U1366. The dominant lithology is carbonate ooze at Site U1368, the site on youngest basement $(13.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and, consequently, in the shallowest water. At Site U1371, which lies on relatively old basaltic basement $71.5–73\mathrm{\Ma})$ ) just south of the gyre, the dominant lithology is siliceous ooze, with metalliferous zeolitic clay at the base of the sediment column.  

Throughout the South Pacific Gyre (Sites U1365–U1370), dissolved oxygen and dissolved nitrate are present throughout the entire sediment column. Concentration profiles of oxygen and nitrate demonstrate subseafloor $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ loss and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{}^{-}$ production and indicate that the subseafloor rate of microbial respiration is generally extremely low. In contrast, at Site U1371 in the upwelling zone just south of the gyre, detectable dissolved oxygen and dissolved nitrate are limited to just below the sediment/water interface and just above the sediment/basalt interface. Manganese reduction is a prominent electron-accepting process throughout most of this sediment column.  

Geographic variation in subseafloor profiles of dissolved oxygen, dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), solid-phase total organic carbon (TOC), and solid-phase total nitrogen (TN) are consistent with the magnitude of organic-fueled subseafloor respiration declining from outside the gyre to the gyre center.  

At all sites located within the gyre, microbial cell counts are three or more orders of magnitude lower than at the same sediment depths at all sites previously cored by scientific ocean drilling. Microbial cell counts are generally higher at the site outside the gyre (Site U1371) than at the sites within the gyre but are lower than at all other sites previously drilled. Countable cells disappear within the upper sediment column at every site in the gyre (Sites U1365–U1370). Dissolved oxygen content, dissolved nitrate concentration, TOC, and TN also decrease with depth and then stabilize as countable cells disappear. The downhole disappearance of countable cells and measurable organic oxidation appears to result from the disappearance of organic electron donors.  

Dissolved electron acceptors (oxygen at Sites U1365–U1370 and sulfate at Site U1371), dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate, and DIC are present throughout the entire sediment column at all sites in the gyre, indicating that microbial life is not limited by availability of electron acceptors or major nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) in these sedimentary environments.  

Dissolved hydrogen concentration is below detection in the upper sediment column of all sites within the gyre. At most sites, it rises above detection with increasing depth. Because dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is continually produced by in situ water radiolysis, the presence of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in many samples suggests that hydrogen-utilizing microbial activity is impaired or absent at sample depths where $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentration is detectable and oxygen is present. At Site U1371, which is anoxic throughout most of the sediment column, dissolved hydrogen concentration is low but above detection through much of the column, with slightly higher values at the base of the column.  

# Paleoceanography  

High-resolution measurements of dissolved chloride and nitrate concentrations, as well as formation factor, provide the opportunity for reconstruction of glacial seawater characteristics through the South Pacific Gyre. Given the importance of this region in terms of ocean circulation, such reconstruction will greatly contribute to understanding of the global ocean-climate system.  

# Basalt alteration and habitability  

At the sites with oldest basement, alteration of the basement basalt continues on the timescale of formation fluid replacement. At all sites, the presence of dissolved oxygen in the lowermost sediment at below-deepwater concentrations suggests that either (1) basement oxidation has occurred since seawater migrated into the formation or (2) oxygen has been lost to the overlying sediment along the flow path. At the sites with deepest sediment (Sites U1365, U1370, and U1371), dissolved potassium profiles indicate that (1) dissolved potassium fluxes into the underlying basalt and (2) basalt alteration continues despite the great age of basement at all three sites (84–120, 74– 79.5, and $71.5–73\mathrm{~Ma}$ , respectively). Profiles of dissolved oxygen, DIC, dissolved nitrate, and dissolved phosphate in the lowermost sediment at each site indicate that if microbial life is present in the uppermost basalt, it is not limited by access to electron acceptors (oxygen and nitrate) or major nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus).  

# Introduction  

The nature of life in the sediment beneath mid-ocean gyres is very poorly known. Almost all sites where subseafloor sedimentary life has been studied are on ocean margins (Ocean Drilling Program [ODP] Legs 112, 180, 201, and 204 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program [IODP] Expeditions 301, 307, and 323) or in the equatorial ocean (ODP Legs 138 and 201). Despite those advances, the extent and character of subsurface life throughout most of the ocean remains unknown (Ocean Studies Board, 2003). This absence of knowledge is largely due to ignorance of subseafloor life in the major ocean gyres, which collectively cover most of the area of the open ocean.  

The South Pacific Gyre is the ideal region for exploring the nature of subseafloor sedimentary communities and habitats in the low-activity heart of an open-ocean gyre. It is the largest of the ocean gyres and its center is farther from continents than the center of any other gyre. Surface chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity are lower in this gyre than in other regions of the world ocean (Behrenfeld and Falkowski, 1997) (Fig. F1). Its surface water is the clearest in the world (Morel et al., 2007). The sediment of this region has some of the lowest organic burial rates in the ocean (Jahnke, 1996). Our recent survey cruise demonstrates that shallow sediment of this region contains the lowest cell concentrations and lowest rates of microbial activity ever encountered in shallow marine sediment (D’Hondt et al., 2009).  

The region is also ideal for testing hypotheses of the factors that limit hydrothermal circulation and chemical habitability in aging oceanic crust (sedimentary overburden, basement permeability, and decreasing basal heat flux). It contains a continuous sweep of oceanic crust with thin $(1{-}100\;\mathrm{m})$ sedimentary cover spanning thousands of kilometers and ${>}100\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . of seafloor age.  

The South Pacific Gyre contains the largest portion of the seafloor that has never been explored with scientific ocean drilling. Consequently, IODP Expedition 329 will advance scientific understanding across a broad front, will help to constrain the nature of crustal inputs to the subduction factory, and will constrain the origin of the Cretaceous Normal Superchron and tectonic history of a region as large as Australia. Recovery of sedimentary interstitial waters at several of the proposed sites will provide novel constraint on glacial–interglacial $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}$ models.  

# Background  

# Expedition history  

Expedition 329 is based on IODP drilling Proposal 662-Full3, “Life beneath the seafloor of the South Pacific Gyre” (available at iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/precruise/ spacificgyre/662-Full3_DHondt.pdf). Following ranking by the IODP Scientific Advisory Structure, the expedition was scheduled for the R/V JOIDES Resolution, operating under contract with the U.S. Implementing Organization (USIO). The expedition started in Papeete, Tahiti, on 8 October 2010 and ended in Auckland, New Zealand, on 13 December. Further details about USIO and the facilities aboard the JOIDES Resolution can be found at www.iodp-usio.org/. Supporting site survey data for Expedition 329 are archived at the IODP Management International, Inc., Site Survey Data Bank (ssdb.iodp.org/).  

# Geological setting  

Expedition 329 sites span nearly the entire width of the Pacific plate in the Southern Hemisphere between $20^{\circ}$ and $45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Fig. F2). This ocean crust was accreted along at least four different plate boundaries (e.g., Pacific/Phoenix, Pacific/Antarctic, Pacific/ Farallon, and Pacific/Nazca). Crustal ages range from ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Chron 34n) at Site U1365 to ${\sim}6\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ (Chron 3An.1n) at alternate Proposed Site SPG-7A. Calculated spreading rates range from slow–intermediate $({<}20\ \mathrm{km/m.y.}$ , half-rate) to ultrafast $\left(>80\;\mathrm{km/m.y.}\right)$ , half-rate).  

The site locations cover a relatively wide range of crustal ages, spreading rates, and tectonic/volcanic environments. The depth and crustal age of each coring site correlates well with the predicted depth versus age curve (Stein and Stein, 1994), which suggests the sites are located on representative crust. Calculated spreading rates at each site are somewhat biased toward fast and ultrafast spreading rates $(28{-}95\ \mathrm{km}/$ m.y., half-rate). Surprisingly, the $95\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{m}$ .y. value is one of the fastest spreading halfrates measured globally. The abyssal hill fabric is relatively well defined for most coring sites. However, off-axis volcanism at alternate Site SPG-5A and Site U1368 masked the original seafloor fabric. Sediment thickness ranges from ${<}3$ to $122{-}130\,\mathrm{m}$ and generally increases west and south of our survey area. This sediment thickness trend is consistent with greater sediment cover on older crust and on crust located farther away from the center of the gyre. The notable exception to this trend is along the northern transect on crust accreted along the Pacific-Farallon spreading system and older than ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{m}.$ .y. Sediment at each of the sites generally appears as pelagic drape, with some localized mass wasting deposits. Seismic images also reveal areas of bottom current activity occasionally resulting in localized scouring of all sediment above volcanic basement (e.g., alternate Site SPG-5A).  

# Microbiological setting  

The sedimentary communities and activities of shallow (0–8 mbsf) South Pacific Gyre sediment are unlike those in any sediment of equal depth previously explored by IODP or ODP (D’Hondt et al., 2009). The survey expedition, KNOX-02RR, demonstrated that cell concentrations and organic fueled respiration in the shallow sediment (0–8 meters below seafloor [mbsf]) of Sites U1365–U1370 are orders of magnitude lower than concentrations in previously examined sediment of equivalent depth (Fig. F3) (D’Hondt et al., 2009). Dissolved oxygen $(\mathrm{O}_{2})$ penetrates extremely deeply (Fig. F4) (Fischer et al., 2009).  

These results demonstrated that at least in the shallow sediment (1) net metabolic activities are low and oxygen is the principal net terminal electron acceptor and (2) biomass is substantially different than in any previously examined deep-sea sediment. In contrast, on the southern edge of the gyre, where sea-surface chlorophyll content is much higher, cell concentrations and dissolved chemical concentrations in the shallow (0–4 mbsf) sediment (D’Hondt et al., 2009) resemble those of ODP Site 1231 (on the northeastern edge of the gyre) (Figs. F3, F4), where most of the subseafloor pore water is anoxic and the community may be principally supported by oxidation of organic matter coupled to reduction of Mn(IV), Fe(II), and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{}^{-}$ migrating up from the underlying basaltic aquifer (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003; D’Hondt et al., 2004). These results suggest that biomass and microbial activity in subseafloor sediment may vary predictably with sea-surface chlorophyll content.  

# Seismic studies/Site survey data  

From 18 December 2006 to 27 January 2007, Expedition KNOX-02RR, aboard the $\mathrm{R}/$ V Revelle, surveyed all 11 drilling sites (Fig. F1). Sediment was geophysically imaged and cored at all 11 sites. Sites U1365–U1370 are in the central portion of the South Pacific Gyre. Site U1371 is below higher productivity water at the gyre’s southern edge. All of the sites are at a crossing point of two track lines or on a single track line immediately adjacent to a crossing point. The multibeam and seismic results are provided in figure form for each site (see D’Hondt et al., 2010).  

Geophysical data collected at each site include SIMRAD EM120 swath map bathymetry and Knudsen digitally recorded $3.5\;\mathrm{kHz}$ seismic reflection and multichannel seismic reflection. Data were collected at 4.5–6 kt with continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation, including at least one set of intersecting track lines. Following each geophysical survey, shallow sediment $(0{-}8\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ was recovered using gravity, piston, and multicores. At sites with water depths deeper than $4\;\mathrm{km}$ , this shallow sediment is principally abyssal clay capped by manganese nodules. At sites in shallower water (proposed Sites SPG-6A and SPG-7A), the shallow sediment is clayey nannofossil ooze.  

All Expedition 329 drill sites are supported by seismic, navigation, and bathymetric data and classified as $^{\prime\prime}1\mathrm{Aa}^{\prime\prime}$ by the Site Survey Panel (SSP). The 1Aa classification indicates that all required data are in the data bank and have been reviewed by the SSP and that they image the target adequately and there are no scientific concerns of drill site location and penetration.  

# Scientific objectives  

Our study has the following fundamental objectives:  

1. To document the habitats, metabolic activities, genetic composition and biomass of microbial communities in subseafloor sediment with very low total activity.  

2. To test how oceanographic factors (such as surface ocean productivity) control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities and communities from gyre center to gyre margin.   
3. To quantify the extent to which subseafloor microbial communities of this region may be supplied with electron donors (food) by water radiolysis, a process independent of the surface photosynthetic world.   
4. To determine how basaltic basement habitats, potential activities and, if measurable, microbial communities vary with crust age and hydrologic regime (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

We proposed to meet these objectives by (1) coring the entire sediment column at several sites along two transects in the region of the South Pacific Gyre (Figs. F1, F2); (2) coring and logging the upper $100\;\mathrm{m}$ of the basaltic basement at three key sites; and (3) undertaking extensive microbiological, biogeochemical, geological, and geophysical analyses of the cores and drill holes.  

The project results address several significant questions. Are the communities in midgyre subseafloor sediment uniquely structured? Do they contain previously unknown organisms? What are their principal sources of metabolic energy? Do their principal metabolic activities, and composition vary with properties of the surface world, such as sea-surface chlorophyll concentrations or organic flux to the seafloor? Is microbial activity is sustainable in subseafloor basalt by mineral oxidation (e.g., oxidation of iron and sulfur species in the basaltic minerals) for tens of millions of years after basalt formation? Are microbial communities recognizably present in subseafloor basalt older than $13\;\mathrm{Ma}?$  

These questions can be framed as hypotheses to be tested. For example, we hypothesized that:  

1. A living community persists in the most organic poor sediment of the world ocean.   
2. Organic-fueled metabolic activity is extremely low and oxygen is the principal net terminal electron acceptor in this sediment. Consequently, the degree of anaerobic activities is far lower here than in previously examined subseafloor sediments.   
3. The biomass and composition of this subseafloor sedimentary community is distinctly different from the communities observed in organic-rich anaerobic subseafloor ecosystems on the continental margins.   
4. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from water radiolysis is a significant electron donor for microbial respiration in the most organic-poor subseafloor sediment.   
5. Open flow continues in the very old basalt of the western gyre.   
6. Basalt oxidation may support chemolithotrophic microbial activity for $100\;\mathrm{m.y}$ . here.   
7. Biomass and activity decrease with basement age as electron donor accessibility decreases.  

Even if none of the above hypotheses are found to be valid, the results of Expedition 329 will significantly advance understanding of the subsurface world. Scientists will test the extent to which distinct oceanographic and geologic provinces contain distinct subseafloor habitats and distinct subseafloor communities. They will document the extent to which life in the low-activity gyre sediment depends on the surface photosynthetic world—and the extent, if any, to which it is metabolically independent of the surface world. They will place firm constraints on the potential for microbial redox activity in ancient subseafloor basalt and how that potential varies with crustal age over $100\;\mathrm{m.y}$ . or more. They will place firm constraints on estimates of total subseafloor biomass and habitable space on our planet.  

The results of Expedition 329 and subsequent shore-based studies will also test  

1. The factors that control evolution of geothermal circulation and chemical alter  
ation in oceanic crust,   
2. Models of regional tectonic history,   
3. Geodynamo models, and   
4. Models of glacial–interglacial ocean-climate change.  

# Explanation of primary objectives  

1. To document the habitats, metabolic activities, genetic composition, and biomass of microbial communities in subseafloor sediment with very low total activity.  

Key questions: What are the principal microbial activities in mid-gyre subseafloor sediment? What are the rates of those activities? How dense are the populations in this sediment? What are the communities active here? How do these communities and activities compare to those in subseafloor sediment with much higher levels of activity? How unique are their organisms?  

Expedition 329 provides a crucial opportunity to document microbial habitats, activities, and community composition in a subseafloor sedimentary ecosystem that has never been explored by scientific ocean drilling.  

# Metabolic activities  

The penetration of high concentrations of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ meters into the sediment at KNOX-02RR survey sites suggested that the net rate of electron-accepting activity is even lower in the South Pacific Gyre than at Site 1231 (in the Peru Basin) (D’Hondt et al., 2009). Along with chemical data from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 92, these $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{}^{-}$ profiles also suggested that the principal electron-accepting activity in the deep subseafloor sediment of this region may be different than at any of the sites where subseafloor sedimentary communities have been previously explored. A sequence of sites was drilled during Leg 92 at ${\sim}20^{\circ}\mathbf{S}$ in the northern portion of the gyre (Leinen, Rea, et al., 1986). At all Leg 92 sites where pore water chemistry was analyzed, dissolved $\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ is present throughout the entire sediment column, which is as thick as $50\;\mathrm{m}$ (Gieskes and Boulègue, 1986). Because $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{}^{-}$ concentrations do not significantly change with depth in the KNOX-02RR survey cores (except at Site U1371) or the Leg 92 cores, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ was predicted to be the principal net electron acceptor in subseafloor sediment throughout the South Pacific Gyre (D’Hondt et al., 2009).  

# Biomass  

Quantification of subseafloor biomass in the South Pacific Gyre will place strong constraints on the size of Earth’s subseafloor biomass and total biomass.  

On the basis of acridine orange direct counts in subseafloor sediment of relatively high activity sites, subseafloor sedimentary biomass has been estimated to comprise one-tenth to one-third of total carbon of living biomass on Earth (Parkes et al., 2000; Whitman et al., 1999). A subsequent study of intact polar lipids estimated living archaeal biomass in subseafloor sediment to be $90~\mathrm{Pg}$ (Lipp and Hinrichs, 2009), equal to ${\sim}15\%$ of Earth’s living biomass. These estimates make a key assumption that needs to be tested by Expedition 329; they assume that the sites where cells were counted are representative of biomass content in the subseafloor sediment of all regions. However, most sites used for these biomass estimates are in relatively organic-rich highbiomass sedimentary environments and therefore may not accurately represent much of the world ocean. As described earlier, cell concentrations in the KNOX-02RR cores are orders of magnitude lower than concentrations at the same depths in all previous IODP/ODP sediment (D’Hondt et al., 2009) (Fig. F3). Therefore, living subseafloor biomass may be far lower than $10\%{-}30\%$ of Earth’s total biomass. This fundamental issue will be addressed by Expedition 329.  

# Community composition  

Genetic analyses of bulk sediment samples and cultured bacterial isolates from deep beneath the seafloor have demonstrated that similar subseafloor sedimentary environments separated by thousands of kilometers contain similar phylogenetic types of microbial communities. For example, hydrate-bearing sediment of the Peru margin and the northwestern U.S. margin (Hydrate Ridge) resulted in statistically similar compositions of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene clone libraries (Inagaki et al., 2006). In contrast, nearby sites with different sedimentary environments contain very different populations, suggesting that environmental factors on energetic constraints and availability may significantly affect the geographic distribution of microbial communities and their metabolic processes (Inagaki et al., 2006).  

Other studies demonstrated the presence of previously undiscovered and therefore uncharacterized phylogenetic lineages in subseafloor sediment, even within a few meters of the seafloor (Sørensen et al., 2004). For example, archaeal 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from shallow sediment $(\leq\!2.1$ mbsf) collected during the KNOX-02RR cruise show that the diversity of predominant archaeal components shift from Nitrosopmilus-related ammonia oxidizers (a-subgroup) to physiologically unknown members of η- and υ-subgroups within the Marine Crenarchaeota Group I (MG-I) (Durbin and Teske, 2010).  

In combination with the metabolic points described above, these genetic discoveries underscore three important points about potential community composition in subseafloor sediment of the South Pacific Gyre. First, the gyre’s subseafloor microbial communities may greatly differ from those of any subseafloor environments explored to date. Second, the very low activity and potentially aerobic communities of the deepest sediment in the South Pacific Gyre are likely to contain unique and previously undiscovered microorganisms. Third, exploration of the gyre sediment may provide deep insight into community composition and structure throughout much of the open ocean, because the genetic communities of subseafloor sediment in the other major ocean gyres may resemble those of the South Pacific Gyre.  

2. To test how oceanographic factors (such as surface ocean productivity) control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities and communities from gyre center to gyre margin.  

Key question: How are subseafloor sedimentary activities and communities affected by oceanographic properties that vary predictably from gyre center to gyre margin?  

Expedition 329 provides a unique opportunity to document how the nature of subseafloor sedimentary life varies with oceanographic properties in the least biologically active region of the world ocean.  

Pore water surveys of regions with higher organic fluxes to the seafloor, such as the equatorial Pacific and continental margins, suggest that the principal electron-accepting activity and the net rates of electron-accepting activities vary predictably with seasurface chlorophyll content and organic flux to the seafloor (D’Hondt et al., 2002, 2004). These relationships appear principally due to reliance of subseafloor sedimentary communities on burial of photosynthesized organic matter for electron donors. Other sedimentary properties that vary with measures of oceanic productivity include sediment composition, which depends on the rate of microfossil production in the overlying water column as well as on the position of the carbonate compensation depth (CCD), and sediment thickness, which largely depends on the rate of calcium carbonate and biosilica production in the overlying water column.  

The KNOX-02RR results (D’Hondt et al., 2009) suggest that the principal electron-accepting activity, net rates of activities, and cell concentrations in the shallow subseafloor sediment of the South Pacific Gyre vary with sea-surface chlorophyll content from within the gyre to outside the gyre and perhaps from site to site within it. Expedition 329 will test these predictions.  

3. To quantify the extent to which these sedimentary communities may be supplied with electron donors (food) by water radiolysis.  

Key question: To what extent does the ecosystem of organic-poor sediment depend on in situ radiolysis of pore water?  

Expedition 329 will provide an unprecedented opportunity to determine if subseafloor life in very low activity sediment is nourished to a significant extent by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from in situ radiolysis of water.  

Buried organic matter appears to be the principal source of electron donors in subseafloor sediment of ocean margins and the equatorial Pacific (D’Hondt et al., 2004).  

However, the burial flux of organic carbon is so low in the South Pacific Gyre that in situ radiolysis of water may be the principal source of electron donors there (D’Hondt et al., 2009) (Fig. F5).  

Water radiolysis has been described as a possible source of energy for ecosystems in hard rock far beneath continental surfaces (Pedersen, 1996; Lin et al., 2005a). The longest-lived products of water radiolysis are the electron donor $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and the electron acceptor $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (Debierne, 1909). $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ can be supplied by in situ radiolysis or, in theory, by transport of radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from a much deeper biologically dead environment (e.g., the mantle and oceanic basement deep beneath sediment).  

The potential importance of water radiolysis to subseafloor sedimentary communities can be assessed by comparing radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production to organic-fueled respiration. For this comparison, in situ $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production by water radiolysis must be quantified from (1) logging estimates of uranium, thorium, and potassium concentrations (D’Hondt, Jørgensen, Miller, et al., 2003) or inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry data (Blair et al., 2007), (2) shipboard physical property measurements (porosity and density) (D’Hondt, Jørgensen, Miller, et al., 2003), and (3) a numerical model of water radiolysis (Blair et al., 2007).  

Water radiolysis may provide a higher flux of electron donors than buried organic matter in gyre sediment. Organic-fueled respiration rates are much lower in this sediment than in any previously drilled regions of the world ocean. Clay-rich sediment contains much higher concentrations of radioactive elements than other deep-sea sediment. Furthermore, in fine-grained porous sediment, most alpha and beta production occurs within striking range of pore water. Consequently, clay-rich sediment will yield much higher rates of water radiolysis than other geological environments.  

Quantification of rates of microbial uptake of radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ requires measurement of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations in the cored sediment (Fig. F6). The expected rate of radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production is so high (D’Hondt et al., 2009) that in situ $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations are measurable onboard if the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is not biologically utilized. If $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is biologically utilized, its in situ concentrations will be below detection; because of its high activation enthalpy, the recombination of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ does not occur at measurable rates at temperatures below $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Bacterial catalysis allows this reaction on a timescale of minutes.  

A number of postexpedition studies will help to further constrain the role of radiolysis in the subseafloor sediment and basalt of the South Pacific Gyre. Measurement and transport modeling of $\mathrm{He^{-4}}$ concentration profiles will constrain estimates of radiolysis rates independently of estimates based on abundances of radioactive elements. Postcruise experiments with sterilized samples of cored sediment and basalt plus tritium-labeled water may be used to verify rates of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ production by water radiolysis Similar (unlabeled) experiments with artificial radiation sources were done by Lin et al. (2005b). Radiolysis rates may be compared to measured hydrogen turnover in sediment incubations with known numbers of microbial cells using an array of relevant electron acceptors $(\mathrm{O}_{2},\,\mathrm{NO}_{3\,\mathrm{~}}$ , and oxidized metals). In this way, possible rates of microbial hydrogen oxidation in the subsurface ecosystem can be constrained.  

4. To determine how basement habitats, potential activities and, if measurable, communities vary with crust age and hydrologic regime (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

Key questions: How does the habitability of subseafloor basalt change with crust age? How does this change depend on basement hydrologic evolution and mineral alteration? Do fractures remain open for flow in basalt as old as $100\;\mathrm{Ma}?$ What is the role of sediment cover in controlling hydrologic flow, alteration, and habitability in subseafloor basalt? Are dissolved oxidants (oxygen and nitrate) available in thinly sedimented subseafloor basalt as old as $100\ \mathrm{Ma}?$ Are reduced elements (e.g., iron and sulfur) available for oxidation in basalt as old as $100\,\mathrm{Ma}?$ Does mineral oxidation support measurable microbial activity in this basalt?  

Expedition 329 provides a unique opportunity to determine how basement habitability and microbial communities vary with crust age, sediment cover, and hydrologic conditions over $100\,\mathrm{m}$ .y. or more of basement history in the most thinly sedimented region of the world ocean.  

Subseafloor basalt has been described as the largest potential microbial habitat on Earth (Fisk et al., 1998). Glass alteration textures have been interpreted as evidence of microbial colonization in subseafloor basalt as old as $145\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Fisk et al., 1998; Furnes and Staudigel, 1999). Laboratory experiments indicate that microbial communities may play an important role in basalt weathering (Staudigel et al., 1998). Other experiments with cultured isolates and biomineralogical studies using seafloor basalts suggest that microbes can derive their energy from rock weathering (e.g., oxidation of reduced iron and sulfur in minerals) (Edwards et al., 2003). A study of fluid samples from a cased borehole in $3.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ basalt on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca ridge showed that microbes exist in the borehole (Cowen et al., 2003).  

Despite this evidence, the nature and extent of subseafloor basaltic communities remain largely unknown and the factors that control the “metabolic habitability” of the basalt (the ability of the basalt to fuel microbial reactions) are largely unexplored. The biological significance of the textural features and the factors that control alteration and its timing in crust are not well constrained.  

Metabolic habitability of subseafloor basalt ultimately depends on the supply of electron donors (including reduced Fe and S) in the basalt and hydrogen from in situ radiolysis and the supply of electron acceptors (e.g., $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NO}{_{3}}^{-}$ ) from seawater flowing into and through the basalt. Processes that change these supplies over the basalt’s lifetime include mineral alteration, which changes the supply of electron donors, and the evolution of hydrologic flow through the basalt, which changes the supply of electron acceptors.  

# Evolution of crust alteration and metabolic habitability  

Compilation of DSDP/ODP geochemical data, mostly from the North Atlantic, suggests that oxidation of Fe and S in the upper few hundred meters of subseafloor basalt occurs principally during the first $10\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ . after basalt formation (Bach and Edwards, 2003). During this interval, the Fe(III)/ΣFe ratio of the bulk basalt in the database increases from ${\sim}0.15$ to 0.35 and most of the sulfur is oxidized (Bach and Edwards, 2003). Whether this alteration is microbially mediated or not, it changes the redox habitability of the basalt. Alteration patterns are heterogeneous within and between cores, with greatest alteration in permeable zones, such as brecciated pillows (Bach and Edwards, 2003).  

Recent studies of altered basalt at ODP Site 801 $^{(\sim170\mathrm{~Ma})}$ ) showed that alteration characteristics of this ancient oceanic basement are generally similar to those observed in much younger crust (e.g., ODP Hole 504B at ${\sim}6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ), suggesting that most alteration takes place when oceanic crust is young (Alt et al., 1992). If oxidative alteration ceases $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ . after basalt formation, then the oceanic crust inhabitable by mineral-oxidizing microbes is limited to basalt younger than $10–15\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Other evidence suggests that oxidative alteration need not be limited to basalt younger than $10–15\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Older basalt has potential for continued redox alteration, and it probably occurs in some geochemical/hydrological regimes. Geophysical measures of matrix density suggest that about half of all intergrain-scale crustal alteration in the uppermost basalt occurs in basement older than $10–15\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Jarrard et al., 2003). In the equatorial Pacific, dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ are present in basement as old as 35  

Ma (D’Hondt et al., 2004). As much as $65\%$ of the Fe remains as $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{II})$ in shallow oceanic basalt older than $10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Bach and Edwards, 2003). Whether this Fe(II) continues to be oxidized at very slow rates where exposed to dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{}^{-}$ or is physically inaccessible to oxidation remains to be determined.  

Sediment thickness provides one explanation for the average change in redox alteration at $10{-}15\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Once sedimentary cover is thick enough and anoxic enough to seal basement from contact with oxidized seawater, redox disequilibria (habitability) may disappear and oxidative alteration cease. Drilling basement of different ages beneath the unusually thin sediment cover in this region of the Pacific presents a unique test of this hypothesis. If a critical sediment thickness is necessary to curtail oxidative alteration, then the young $(13.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , moderate $(33.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , and old $84{-}125\ \mathrm{Ma})$ basement sites drilled during Expedition 329 will exhibit more intense or differing styles of alteration relative to other fast-spreading sites of comparable age and greater sediment cover (e.g., Site 801, ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment at ${\sim}170\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ; ODP Site 1256, ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment at $15\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ; and Hole 504B, ${\sim}250\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment at ${\sim}6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ). If this is the case, the basaltic environment of the South Pacific Gyre is redox habitable for many tens of millions of years after basalt formation.  

# Evolution of crustal hydrology and chemical habitability  

The timing and distribution of shallow basement alteration is intriguingly linked to evidence of the hydrologic evolution of subseafloor basalt. Seismic velocity and macroporosity data suggest that porosity and bulk permeability of subseafloor basalt decrease rapidly during the first $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . after basalt formation (Jarrard et al., 2003). These decreases are thought to derive from secondary mineralization in the basalt. This mineralization reduces surface area within the basalt and may limit electron donor and nutrient availability in the basaltic aquifer.  

Global compilations of heat flow data indicate that advective heat loss is high in young seafloor and decreases with increasing age until ${\sim}65\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , where, on average, advective heat loss ceases (Stein and Stein, 1994) (Fig. F7). Fisher and Becker (2000) explain these observations by invoking closure of small-scale permeability in basement within $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ . but ongoing flow for $65\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ in large fractures and faults that fill a relatively small volume of the rock. Three mechanisms are thought responsible for limiting hydrothermal circulation in old crust:  

1. Buildup of low-permeability sediment cover, which reduces basement relief and isolates the oceanic crust from overlying seawater;  

2. Ongoing mineralization, which decreases basement permeability with age; and 3. Decreasing basal heat flux with age, which reduces the driving force for buoyant fluid flow.  

Basement permeability is commonly thought to ultimately control the cessation of hydrothermal circulation (Stein and Stein, 1994; Jarrard et al., 2003).  

However, a growing body of evidence suggests that oceanic basalt remains permeable enough to sustain advective heat loss through its life. This evidence includes the significant variance in age-dependent heat flow averages (Stein and Stein, 1994) (Fig. F7), large variations in heat flow survey data of Cretaceous-aged basement (Von Herzen, 2004; Fisher and Von Herzen, 2005) velocity logs, macroporosity data, matrix data (Jarrard et al., 2003), present-day fluid flow within ${\sim}132\ \mathrm{Ma}$ basement at ODP Site 1149 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2000), and celadonite precipitation ages that indicate low-temperature fluid circulation at the Trodos ophiolite (Gallahan and Duncan, 1994). Given these lines of evidence, the termination of the average heat flow deficit at ${\sim}65\ \mathrm{Ma}$ probably signifies that much of the open circulation between basaltic basement and ocean has largely stopped by then, rather than that hydrothermal flow has ended (Anderson and Skilbeck, 1981; Jacobson, 1992; Stein and Stein, 1994).  

We hypothesize that advective fluid flow paths remain open even on old seafloor. If this is true, the apparent waning of hydrothermal circulation at ${\sim}65\ \mathrm{Ma}$ is controlled by sediment thickness or declining heat flow, rather than by basement permeability. The South Pacific Gyre offers a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis because its sediment is thin and its basement relief is relatively variable. If the hypothesis is true, large-scale permeability will be high regardless of basement age and heat flow data at the drill sites may deviate significantly from conductive values. Surface heat flow data from our recent survey (Fig. F7) and from scattered older measurements within 200 km of Sites U1365 and U1367 suggest that an active flow system may be present in the basement throughout the region of proposed drilling.  

If this hypothesis is correct, the supply of the dissolved electron acceptors $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ to the upper basement of the South Pacific Gyre may remain high long past the first $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . after basalt formation. If drilling of the lowermost sediment and the basalt shows the occurrence of these electron acceptors in the upper basement at the sites, either (1) the metabolic habitability of South Pacific Gyre basalt remains sufficient to support life for as long as $100\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ or (2) the metabolic habitability of this basalt is ultimately controlled by the inaccessibility of electron donors in the basalt rather than by access to electron acceptors. If the first case applies, increased oxidative alteration may be evident in crust of increasingly greater age (e.g., alteration at Site U1365 will be greater than alteration at Site U1367, which will be greater than alteration at Site U1368). If the second case applies, oxidative alteration will be similar at all three sites.  

Assessment of the extent and relative importance of secondary alteration to the basaltic basement will require an integrated program of petrographic, geochemical, and borehole analyses. At hand-sample and thin section scales, we will carefully describe general alteration textures and characteristics (e.g., veins, halos, vesicle filling, mineral/matrix replacement, and glass palagonitization), principal secondary mineralogy (e.g., saponite, celadonite, calcite, Fe oxyhydroxide, etc.), and the size, distribution, and orientation of veins and other structural features in the crust. Discrete samples of the core, representing “fresh” (e.g., pristine glass, if recovered), average, and endmember altered domains, will be powdered and analyzed for bulk major, trace, and volatile element chemistry, as a means of characterizing the bulk crustal composition and geochemical effects of alteration. Borehole logging and core-log integration are invaluable for reconstructing recovery gaps and estimating bulk geochemical and structural characteristics of deep basement drill sites (Barr et al., 2002; Révillon et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2003; Pockalny and Larson, 2003). Post-expedition radiogenic isotope measurements will place important constraints on the timing of alteration at each site. For example, calcite formed during crust alteration often contains high concentrations of uranium but little to no lead, making the lead isotopic system a potentially useful calcite precipitation geochronometer, especially in old oceanic crust (Hauff et al., 2003).  

# Basement community composition  

Drilling of the basalt sites during Expedition 329 provides a direct opportunity to test the existence and composition of microbial communities in oceanic basement of three very different ages (13.5, 33.5, and $80{-}125\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). Molecular microscopic analyses of uncontaminated basalt from the site with youngest basement will test whether or not microbes take full advantage of the redox habitability of relatively young basalt in open exchange with the overlying ocean while analyses of samples from the sites with older basement will test whether or not ongoing oxidation of the subseafloor basalt (by occurrence of reduced Fe and supply of dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ by ongoing advection  and  diffusion  through  the  sediment)  sustains  similar  (or  different) communities, albeit at slower rates of redox activity. Collectively, the study of these sites will track the compositional and functional evolution of basement microbial communities ${>}100\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ in a thinly sedimented region of fast-spreading crust, where we hypothesize supply of dissolved oxidants to continue for as long as $100\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . (or more).  

# Explanation of secondary objectives  

# Oceanic crust inputs to the subduction factory  

The altered oceanic crust at our oldest basement sites (U1365 and U1366) is outboard of the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone. Characterizing the style and extent of alteration in this subducting plate will provide an important reference for assessing the role of altered oceanic crust in the subduction process. Of global arcs, the Tonga arc has perhaps the smallest sediment flux (Plank and Langmuir, 1998) and the altered oceanic crust in this system is proportionally more influential in the subduction process than at most other arcs. If the low sedimentation rate at this site has resulted in unusual alteration characteristics in the subducting oceanic crust, these differences may translate into geochemically distinct signatures in the magmas produced at the Tonga arc.  

# Regional tectonics  

Sites U1365 and U1366 are centrally located in ocean crust accreted during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (CNS). The tectonic history of this Australia-sized area is poorly constrained because correlatable magnetic seafloor anomalies are not present. Although limited bathymetry data suggest a general north–south spreading direction, the actual direction(s) and the presence of a failed rift within the region are poorly constrained. Drilling and logging ocean crust at these sites would address these questions. Radiometric dating of plagioclase within the recovered basalt would provide important age constraints (Koppers et al., 2003) and structural analysis of dipping flow units with core logging data would provide a spreading direction (Pockalny and Larson, 2003). Resolving the tectonic history of this region is critical to understanding the effect of large igneous provinces on tectonic processes and whether the Ontong Java, Manihiki, and Hikurangi plateaus were created by one or multiple mantle plumes (Taylor, 2006).  

# Geodynamo  

The causal mechanisms for the Cocos-Nazca spreading center are still debated. Some authors have proposed the presence of a strong magnetic field during superchrons (Larson and Olson, 1991; Tarduno et al., 2001), which would argue for an efficient geodynamo (i.e., large intensities during low reversal frequency). Others argue for a weak field (Loper and McCartney, 1986; Pick and Tauxe, 1993), suggesting that increased convective vigor in the core would increase the reversal rate by generating frequent instabilities. If the latter model applies, the Cocos-Nazca spreading center record is low in paleointensity but may contain frequent reversals. To add further controversy, the limited number of paleointensity measurements from the Cocos-Nazca spreading center yield very different results for different methods (Pick and Tauxe, 1993; Tarduno et al., 2001). Drilling basement at Site U1365 will provide important data and samples to test these models and methods. The paleointensity methods could be compared and the measurements would provide important data (in conjunction with the radiometric age) for the origin of the Cocos-Nazca spreading center and its relationship to the geodynamo.  

# Paleoceanography  

Interstitial waters of the South Pacific Gyre represent a unique archive of glacial-aged water from which relict $\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ can be used to test hypotheses of glacial–interglacial ocean-climate change with significantly lower uncertainty than through proxy measurements.  

It has been hypothesized that changes in strength of the biological carbon pump caused the dominant variation in Earth’s climate and atmospheric $C O_{2}$ over the last 1 m.y. (Broecker, 1982). We will test the two principal models of this variation by reconstructing the preformed $\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ content and deep ocean $\delta^{15}\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ of the last glacial maximum (LGM) through measurement of $\mathrm{O}_{2},\,\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{\mathrm{-}}$ , and $\delta^{15}\mathrm{NO}_{3}{}^{-}$ in the interstitial fluid of gyre sediment. Our tests utilize the fact that pore fluids from depths greater than ${\sim}30{-}50$ mbsf (e.g., at Sites U1365 and U1370) are samples of paleo–bottom water that have effectively been out of diffusive contact with the ocean since the LGM.  

# Relationship to previous drilling  

Site U1365 is located in the western portion of the gyre, near DSDP Sites 595 and 596 (Menard, Natland, Jordan, Orcutt, et al., 1987). There are no DSDP/ODP/IODP sites near any of the other Expedition 329 sites. The closest sites were cored during Leg 92, which recovered Oligocene and younger sediment from a series of sites at $20^{\circ}\mathbf{S}$ (Leinen, Rea, et al., 1986). The Leg 92 sites are located beneath higher productivity waters than the central gyre (Fig. F1). The entire sediment column was cored at the  

Leg 92 sites; basement was encountered between 1 and 50 mbsf (with sediment depth increasing westward).  

# Coring-drilling strategy  

Our general strategy during Expedition 329 was to core the entire sediment column multiple times at seven sites and to core the upper basement at three sites. The sites collectively underlie the full range of surface-ocean productivity conditions present in the South Pacific Gyre, ranging from the extremely low productivity conditions of the gyre center (Site U1368) to the moderately high (for open ocean) productivity at the southern edge of the gyre (Site U1371, at the northern edge of the Antarctic Convergence) (Figs. F1, F2). This series of sites is composed of two transects (Fig. F1), with the first transect centered at ${\sim}26^{\circ}\mathbf{S}$ , beneath the heart of the South Pacific Gyre, and the second transect centered at ${\sim}42^{\circ}\mathbf{S}$ in the southern portion of the gyre.  

The sites in the northern sequence have been continuously far from shore and beneath the low-productivity gyre waters for many tens of millions of years (Figs. F1, F2). They provide an ideal opportunity to meet our first objective (to document the nature of life in subseafloor sediment with very low biomass and very low rates of activity). In combination with the southern transect, the northern transect is also necessary to meet our second objective (to determine how subseafloor sedimentary activities and communities vary from gyre center to gyre margin).  

Sites U1365 to U1371 are necessary for our third objective (to quantify the extent to which subseafloor communities in organic-poor sediment are sustained by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from radiolysis of water). Sites U1365, U1370, and U1371 are particularly crucial for this objective because their sediment columns are thick enough that their dissolved $\mathrm{He}^{-4}$ (alpha particle) concentrations and fluxes will be measurable.  

The sites in the second transect have been in the southern portion of the present gyre (Sites U1369 and U1370) or south of the gyre (Site U1371) for tens of millions of years. Particularly at Site U1371, chlorophyll-a concentrations and primary productivity are much higher than at all of the sites in the northern transect (Figs. F1, F2). This transect is necessary to meet our second objective (to document how subseafloor sedimentary activities and communities vary from gyre center to gyre margin). Because Site U1371 provides an anoxic standard of comparison for the other sites, it is also crucial for documenting the potential uniqueness (or ubiquity) of the communities and activities that persist in the low-activity, low-biomass sediment beneath the gyre center.  

The northern sequence of sites (U1365–U1368) is placed on basaltic basement of steadily increasing age from east to west (Fig. F2). Basaltic basement ranges in age from 7 to as much as $125\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Site U1365). Basement age of the southern sites ranges from 39 to $73\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Their water depths generally follow the classic curve (Parsons and Sclater, 1977) of increasing water depth with increasing basement age (Fig. F2). These sites are necessary to meet our fourth objective (to document the evolution of basalt hydrology and its implications for metabolic habitability and microbial communities in ocean crust under very thin sediment cover).  

# Expedition synthesis  

# Sediment  

Expedition 329 sites are located along two transects, hinged in the center of the South Pacific Gyre (Figs. F1, F2). The first transect progresses from the western edge of the gyre (Site U1365) to the gyre center (Site U1368). The second transect goes from the gyre center (Site U1368) through the southern gyre edge (Site U1370) to the northern edge of the upwelling region south of the gyre (Site U1371).  

The dominant lithology is zeolitic metalliferous clay at the deeper water sites on older basement (58 to ${\leq}120\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ) within the gyre (Sites U1365, U1366, U1369, and U1370) (Figs. F2, F8). Manganese nodules occur at the seafloor and intermittently within the upper sediment column at these sites. Chert and porcellanite layers are pronounced in the lower half of the sediment column at Sites U1365 and U1366. The dominant lithology is carbonate ooze at Site U1368, the site on youngest basement $(13.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and, consequently, in the shallowest water. At Site U1371, which lies on relatively old basaltic basement ( $71.5–73\;\mathrm{Ma})$ just south of the gyre, the dominant lithology is siliceous ooze, although metalliferous zeolitic clay dominates the lowest portion of this sediment column.  

The dominant lithology shifts from clay to carbonate ooze at depth in two of the sites (Fig. F8). At Site U1367, the transition from clay to carbonate at 6–7 mbsf marks the time that the site subsided beneath the CCD as the underlying basement cooled with age. At Site U1370, carbonate ooze is the dominant lithology for a short interval deposited during planktonic foraminiferal Zone P1. This foraminifer-bearing interval is most simply interpreted as resulting from the CCD diving to greater water depth than the water depth of this site during the early Paleocene interval of low planktonic carbonate production.  

Sediment thickness is generally very low throughout the gyre (Fig. F8). When sites of broadly similar age are compared (Site U1366, 84–120 Ma; Site U1369, $58\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ; Site U1370; $74{-}80\ \mathrm{Ma}_{}$ ; and Site U1371, 71.5–73 Ma), thickness of the sediment column generally increases with increasing distance from the gyre center (Figs. F1, F2, F8).  

# Sedimentary microbial communities and habitability  

Throughout the South Pacific Gyre (Sites U1365–U1370), dissolved oxygen and dissolved nitrate are present throughout the entire sediment column (Fig. F9), indicating that microbial respiration is oxic throughout the column, as predicted by D’Hondt et al. (2009) and Fischer et al. (2009). The concentration profiles of oxygen and nitrate demonstrate subseafloor $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ loss and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}-$ production and indicate that the subseafloor rate of microbial respiration is generally extremely low.  

In contrast, at Site U1371 in the upwelling zone just south of the gyre (Fig. F1), detectable dissolved oxygen and dissolved nitrate are limited to just below the sediment/water interface and just above the sediment/basalt interface. Between these interfaces, the sediment is anoxic. Very high concentrations of dissolved (presumably reduced) manganese indicate that manganese reduction is a prominent electron-accepting process throughout most of this sediment column, with perhaps very short intervals of iron reduction suggested by minor peaks in dissolved iron concentration associated with local minima in dissolved manganese concentration. The rapid drop of dissolved oxygen and nitrate below their detection limits at the upper and lower edges of this sediment column and the relatively high concentrations of dissolved phosphate within this column suggest that the subseafloor rate of microbial respiration is much higher at this site than at the sites located in the gyre.  

Geographic variation in subseafloor profiles of dissolved oxygen, dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total solid-phase organic carbon (TOC), and total solid-phase nitrogen (TN) are consistent with the magnitude of organic-fueled subseafloor respiration declining from outside the gyre (Site U1371) to gyre margins (Sites U1365 and U1370) to gyre center (Site U1368) (Figs. F1, F9, F10).  

At all sites located within the gyre (Sites U1365–U1370), microbial cell counts are three or more orders of magnitude lower than at the same sediment depths in all sites previously cored by scientific ocean drilling (Fig. F11). Microbial cell counts are generally higher at Site U1371 than at the sites within the gyre (Sites U1365–U1370) but are lower than at all other sites previously drilled.  

At all of the sites in the gyre, TOC and TN decline rapidly with depth in the upper sediment column and are generally constant at greater depth (Fig. F10). In contrast, at Site U1371 TOC and TN are generally much higher than at the other sites at all depths.  

Countable cells disappear within the upper sediment column at every site in the gyre. Dissolved oxygen content, dissolved nitrate concentration, TOC, and TN stabilize as countable cells disappear. The downhole disappearance of countable cells and measurable oxygen reduction appears to result from the disappearance of organic electron donors.  

Dissolved oxygen, dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate and DIC are present throughout the entire sediment column at all sites in the gyre (Sites U1365–U1370) (Fig. F9), indicating that microbial life is not limited by availability of electron acceptors or major nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) in this sedimentary environment. At Site U1371, dissolved oxygen is absent from most of the sediment column, but the dissolved manganese concentration profile suggests that manganese reduction occurs through most of the sequence. Dissolved sulfate, dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate, and DIC are present throughout the entire sediment column at Site U1371, indicating that microbial life is not limited by availability of electron acceptors or major nutrients in this sedimentary environment either.  

Dissolved hydrogen concentration is below detection in the upper sediment column of all sites within the gyre (Fig. F10). At most sites, it rises above detection with increasing depth. Because dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is continually produced by in situ water radiolysis, the presence of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in many samples suggests that hydrogen-utilizing microbial activity is impaired or absent at sample depths where $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentration is detectable and oxygen is present. At Site U1371, which is anoxic throughout most of the sediment column, dissolved hydrogen concentration is low, but above detection through much of the column, with slightly higher values at the base of the column. In the deepest sediment at that site, the apparent coexistence of dissolved oxygen, dissolved manganese, and dissolved hydrogen suggests that microbial activity at that depth is insufficient to fully remove either oxygen or the electron donors, manganese and hydrogen.  

The sulfate anomaly profile and the occurrence of disseminated pyrite in the upper $10\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment at Site U1371 suggest that sulfate and manganese reduction co-occur within the column.  

# Paleoceanography  

High-resolution measurements of dissolved chloride and nitrate concentrations, as well as formation factor, provide the opportunity for reconstruction of glacial seawater characteristics through the South Pacific Gyre. Given the importance of this region in terms of ocean circulation, such reconstruction will greatly contribute to understanding of the global ocean-climate system.  

# Basalt  

The uppermost basaltic basement at Site U1365 is composed of lava flows, whereas the uppermost basement at Sites U1367 and U1368 is primarily composed of pillow basalt.  

# Basalt alteration  

Alteration in lava flow units, as evident at Site U1365, appears to be strongly controlled by lithologic structure, with most alteration focused at the flow boundaries (Fig. F14). In contrast, alteration in pillow lava units (the dominant lithologies at Sites U1367 and U1368) appears to be more evenly distributed.  

At all sites, the presence of dissolved oxygen in the lowermost sediment at below– deep water concentrations (Fig. F9) suggests that either (1) basement oxidation has occurred since seawater migrated into the formation or (2) oxygen has been lost to the overlying sediment along the flow path.  

At the sites with oldest basement, alteration of the basement basalt continues on the timescale of formation fluid replacement. Natural gamma radiation (NGR) core logs, downhole NGR logs (Site U1368), and chemical analyses of the rock demonstrate that potassium has been consistently taken up during basalt alteration at all three sites where the basaltic basement was drilled (Sites U1365, U1367, and U1368) (Fig. F13). At the sites with deepest sediment (Site U1365, where basalt was drilled, plus Sites U1370 and U1371, where basalt was not drilled), dissolved potassium concentrations are noticeably lower in the deepest sediment than in the shallow sediment (Fig. F14), indicating that (1) dissolved potassium fluxes into the underlying basalt and (2) basalt alteration continues despite the great age of basement at all three sites (84–120, 74– 79.5, and 71.5–73, respectively).  

At all three sites where basement was rotary cored (Sites U1365, U1367, and U1368), secondary minerals provide evidence of both oxidative alteration (iron oxyhydroxide and celadonite) and oxygen-poor alteration (saponite and secondary sulfides). Some samples have undergone multiple stages of alteration. Late vein infills suggest that alteration may be continuous or at least occur intermittently throughout the life of the ocean crust. At Site U1365, the presence in the lowermost sediment of dissolved Mg at below–deep water concentrations and dissolved Ca at above–deep water concentrations indicates that basalt-water interaction in the form of Mg exchange for Ca has occurred since seawater migrated into the formation. This exchange may continue to drive late-stage calcite precipitation, despite the great age of basement at this site (80– $120\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ).  

# Habitability of basaltic basement  

Profiles of dissolved oxygen, DIC, dissolved nitrate, and dissolved phosphate in the lowermost sediment at each site indicate that if microbial life is present in the uppermost basalt (Fig. F9), it is not limited by access to electron acceptors (oxygen and nitrate) or major nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus).  

# Past microbial activity?  

Tubelike micro-scale weathering features occur in altered glass from Site U1365 (Fig. F12). They are arranged in discrete clusters or in masses adjacent to or near fractures and iron oxyhydroxide within the glass. Similar features have been observed in marine basaltic glass elsewhere and attributed to microbial origin (e.g., Fisk et al, 1998).  

# Technical advances  

Expedition 329 used a wide range of instruments and techniques that have not often been used on scientific ocean drilling expeditions. Details of their Expedition 329 application are provided in the “Methods” chapter of the Expedition Report, particularly in the “Biogeochemistry,” “Microbiology,” and “Physical properties” sections.  

Two technical approaches were used by the Expedition 329 Scientific Party on an experimental basis, with the intention of refining them heavily for future application.  

The first of these techniques was flow cytometric cell counting. The second was use of NGR core logging for shipboard quantification of absolute concentrations of $^{238}\mathrm{U}.$ - series elements, $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ -series elements, and potassium. Because these techniques were used on an experimental basis, they are described in dedicated chapters of the Expedition Report.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 329 had the following four fundamental objectives:  

1. To document the habitats, metabolic activities, genetic composition and biomass of microbial communities in subseafloor sediment with very low total activity.   
2. To test how oceanographic factors (such as surface ocean productivity, sedimentation rate, and distance from shore) control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities and communities from gyre center to gyre margin.   
3. To quantify the extent to which subseafloor microbial communities of this region may be supplied with electron donors (food) by water radiolysis, a process independent of the surface photosynthetic world.   
4. To determine how basement habitats, potential activities and, if measurable, microbial communities vary with crust age and hydrologic regime (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

The expedition made major strides toward fulfilling all of these objectives.  

Shipboard biogeochemistry, lithostratigraphy, microbiology, and physical property studies documented many fundamental aspects of subseafloor sedimentary habitats, metabolic activities, and biomass in this very low activity sedimentary ecosystem. Documentation of genetic composition and additional aspects of sedimentary habitability and biomass must await shore-based study.  

Shipboard biogeochemical and cell-enumeration results have also significantly improved understanding of how oceanographic factors control variation in subseafloor sedimentary habitats, activities, and biomass from gyre center to gyre margin. Postexpedition studies are necessary to improve understanding of the underlying mechanisms and to test how oceanographic factors control variation in community composition.  

Shipboard studies have quantified the availability of dissolved hydrogen throughout the sediment column and taken the samples necessary to quantify in situ rates of radiolytic hydrogen production. Postexpedition analyses of these samples are required to quantify these rates and their distribution throughout the sediment column of each site.  

Shipboard biogeochemical, petrological, and physical property data document firstorder patterns of basement habitability and potential microbial activities. A broad range of postexpedition studies will be necessary to further constrain habitability and to test how microbial community structure varies with basement age, water-rock interactions, and hydrologic regime.  

# Operations  

During Expedition 329 we conducted operations in 42 holes at 7 sites ranging from 3749 to 5707 meters below sea level (mbsl). We cored $1321.8\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and basalt and recovered $1168.8\,\mathrm{m}$ of core (Table T1). Downhole logs were collected in one hole. Here we describe the coring and logging operations at each of these sites. The overall time distribution included 5.1 days in port, 27.26 days in transit, and 33.7 days on site. We covered $6655~\mathrm{nmi}$ , of which 4503 nmi was transit between the first and the last site. All times in the operations section are given in local ship time unless otherwise noted. For most of the expedition, local time was Universal Time Coordinated – $^{10}\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Papeete port call  

Expedition 329 began with the first line ashore on Papeete, Tahiti (French Polynesia), at $0734~\mathrm{h}$ on 7 October 2010. The first Tahiti port call for the JOIDES Resolution included refueling after the long journey from Victoria, British Columbia. After refueling, the ship was secured by tugboats and moved to the EPI North Pier, across from the town center, on 8 October. USIO staff, the expedition Co-Chiefs, and some members of the Scientific Party boarded the ship on 9 October to start setting up thirdparty instrumentation in the ship’s laboratories in preparation for the expedition. The rest of the Science Party moved onboard on 10 October. Port call lasted 5.1 days.  

# Transit to Site U1365  

The JOIDES Resolution departed Papeete for the $982\;\mathrm{nmi}$ journey to Site U1365 in the morning of 12 October 2010. The vessel sailed at full speed, averaging $11.5~\mathrm{kt}$ , and arrived at Site U1365 at $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 October. The position reference was a combination of GPS signals. Although an acoustic beacon was deployed, it was not used for positioning at this site because of an electronic malfunction in the dynamic positioning system. The positioning beacon was deployed at $0805\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 October and recovered at $2044~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 October.  

# Site U1365  

Five holes were cored at Site U1365. The first four holes were cored with the advanced piston coring (APC) system. The fifth and final hole was drilled with a $9\%$ inch rotary core bit. Downhole logging was originally scheduled for this site but was canceled when the overall depth of the hole was reduced because of the low penetration rates with the rotary core barrel (RCB) bit. As a proxy for microbial contamination, perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) was continuously injected into the drilling fluid for all coring of Holes U1365B–U1365E. The advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) was deployed 8 times on the APC system, and usable data was recovered 7 times. On one of the tool runs, the data was lost while trying to recover it from the tool. For this site, APC system recovery was $95.2\%$ and RCB system recovery was $74.5\%$ . Overall core recovery for this site was $90.8\%$ . A total of 55 cores were recovered after coring $251.1\,\mathrm{m}$ . The total length of core recovered was $228.07\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Hole U1365A  

Rig floor operations started at $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 October 2010. The trip to the seafloor was without incident while measuring and drifting the tubulars and assembling the bottom-hole assembly (BHA). The top drive was picked up, the drill string was spaced out, and a washdown hole was drilled to determine depth of basement. The center bit was pulled by wireline, the vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west, and the top drive was spaced out to spud Hole U1365A. After making up the first APC core, the core barrel was run to bottom on the wireline and Hole U1365A was spudded at $0530\;\mathrm{h}$ on 17 October. Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5706.3 meters below rig floor (mbrf). Nonmagnetic core barrels and the Flexit tool were used for the first 4 cores and APCT-3 temperature measurements were taken on Cores 329-U1365A-1H, 3H, and 4H. APC continued until basement was reached at 75.5 mbsf. A total of 26 cores were taken in Hole U1365A, with a total recovery of $74.06\;\mathrm{m}$ $(98.1\%)$ ). All cores after Core  

4H were incomplete strokes, and the recovery was slowed by a very thick layer of chert formation from ${\sim}42$ to $63.5~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . After reaching basement on Core 26H, the bit was tripped back to just above the seafloor, ending Hole U1365A at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 October.  

# Hole U1365B  

Hole U1365B was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1365A and was spudded at $1010\,\mathrm{h}$ . The mudline core established seafloor depth at 5705.4 mbrf. APC continued until 42.5 mbsf. Temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 on Cores 329-U1365B3H, 4H, and 5H, although the data on Core 3H was lost trying to download the data from the tool. The center bit was then deployed and the formation was drilled from 42.5 to 63.5 mbsf. The center bit was pulled and APC continued until basement was reached at 75.6 mbsf. A total of 8 cores were taken with a total recovery of $55.79\mathrm{~m~}$ $(102.2\%)$ . All cores after Core 5H were incomplete strokes and a $21\;\mathrm{m}$ section of hole was drilled to avoid coring a very thick layer of chert formation from ${\sim}42$ to 63.5 mbsf. The drill string was tripped to just above the mudline, clearing the sea floor at $0640\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 October and ending Hole U1365B.  

# Hole U1365C  

After offsetting the vessel $20\,\mathrm{m}$ north, Hole U1365C was spudded at $0940\,\mathrm{h}$ on $20\,\mathrm{Oc}-$ tober and advanced with the APC system to 37.5 mbsf before encountering the first hard chert layer. Temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 on Cores 329-U1365C-3H and 4H. The center bit was then dropped and the subsequent drilled interval ended again at 63.5 mbsf after advancing $26\,\mathrm{m}$ . The center bit was pulled and the APC system was redeployed and advanced by recovery until basement was encountered at 74.8 mbsf. A total of 8 cores were taken with a total recovery of $39.67\;\mathrm{m}$ $(81.3\%)$ . All cores after Core 4H were incomplete strokes. The drill string was then tripped to just above the mudline, clearing the seafloor at $0435\;\mathrm{h}$ on 21 October and ending Hole U1365C.  

# Hole U1365D  

After offsetting the vessel $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east, Hole U1365D was spudded at $0540\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 October. The hole was advanced with the APC system for 2 cores to 19 mbsf and 18.89 m of sediment was recovered, for an overall recovery of $99.4\%$ . After the second core, the drill string was tripped to surface and the bit cleared the rotary table at $2030\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , ending Hole U1365D.  

# Hole U1365E  

The objective at Hole U1365E was to drill and core through the sediment/basalt interface and ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ into the basaltic basement. However, we cored ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ of basement with good recovery, did not capture the sediment/basement interface, and ran out of allocated time because of slow coring rates $(<\!1\;\mathrm{m/h})$ . After a $20\;\mathrm{m}$ offset to the south, Hole U1365E began at $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 October. The BHA was set back, the APC bit was removed, and the rotary core bit and RCB coring system were assembled in preparation for running the new RCB BHA. The BHA was being assembled when a worrisome noise was noticed on the rig floor. Subsequent investigation revealed a failed crown block sheave bearing on the Number 2 sheave. After discussions with onboard staff, Transocean management, Transocean engineering, and the original equipment manufacturer, a decision was reached to restring the blocks to a 10-part configuration, isolating the damaged sheave from the system. Work was completed on the field modification and repair at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 October. The BHA was then run into the hole, followed by the drill pipe, and the top drive was picked up and the drill string was spaced out to spud Hole U1365E. Water depth was recorded at 5705 mbrf using the offset from the previous hole. The center bit was deployed and Hole U1365E was spudded at $2210\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 October. At 71 mbsf, the center bit was pulled and the RCB was dropped and coring began. RCB coring continued from 71 to 124.2 mbsf with good recovery. Because of extremely slow penetration rates, after the first core, half cores were cut and retrieved. A total of $53.2\;\mathrm{m}$ was cored and $39.66\mathrm{~m~}$ was recovered $(74.6\%$ recovery). Contamination testing was done with fluorescent microspheres (as well as PFT) on all cores after the sediment/basement interface core. The drill string was then tripped back to the rig floor and secured for the $494\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to the next site, ending Hole U1365E and Site U1365 at $2115\;\mathrm{h}$ on 27 October.  

# Transit to Site U1366  

After a $48.85\;\mathrm{h}$ transit from Site U1365, covering $494\;\mathrm{nmi}$ and averaging 10.1 kt, the speed was reduced and thrusters and hydrophones were lowered. Speed was less than expected because two of the propulsion motors on the starboard shaft were offline with failed field coils. Dynamic positioning was initiated over Site U1366 at $2215\mathrm{~h~}$ on 29 October 2010. The position reference was a combination of GPS signals. No acoustic beacon was deployed, but a beacon remained on standby in the event of loss of GPS satellite coverage. Whereas automatic input into the dynamic positioning system was not possible, it was possible to manually hold the vessel in position to clear the seafloor with the BHA, if necessary.  

# Site U1366  

Six holes were drilled or cored at this site. The first hole was a washdown hole drilled with the center bit in order to establish the sediment depth. The next five holes were cored and drilled with the APC system. PFT was continuously injected into the drilling fluid for all coring of Holes U1366B–U1366F. The APCT-3 was not deployed because the sediment thickness was only ${\sim}20\textrm{m}$ . APC system recovery for Site U1366, was $100.6\%$ . Extended core barrel (XCB) recovery was $0\%$ . A total of 14 cores were attempted after coring $97.9\textrm{m}$ . The total length of core recovered from this site was $96.45\mathrm{~m~}$ for a recovery of $98.5\%$ .  

# Hole U1366A  

Rig floor operations commenced at $2215\;\mathrm{h}$ on 29 October 2010. The trip to the seafloor was uneventful. The top drive was picked up, and the drill string was spaced out and spudded at $0815\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . The PFT pump was turned on to distribute PFT evenly throughout the fluid in the drill string. The washdown hole was drilled to determine depth of basement. Mud line was established at 5146.0 mbrf by tagging with the bit. After drilling down, basement was established at 17.8 mbsf. The bit was pulled back, clearing the seafloor at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ and ending Hole U1366A.  

# Hole U1366B  

After clearing the seafloor, the center bit was pulled by wireline, the vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west, and the drill string was spaced out to spud Hole U1366B. After making up the first APC core barrel, the core barrel was run to bottom on the wireline and Hole U1366B was spudded at $1045\,\mathrm{h}$ on $30\,\mathrm{O}$ ctober. Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5141.8 mbrf. APC coring continued to 17.2 mbsf. Two cores were taken with a total recovery of $17.31\,\mathrm{m}$ ( $100.6\%$ recovery). After Core 329-U1366A-2H, the bit was tripped back to just above the seafloor, ending Hole U1366B at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 October.  

# Hole U1366C  

Hole U1366C began at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ when the APC assembly cleared the seafloor after completing Hole U1366B. After offsetting the vessel $20\;\mathrm{m}$ north, Hole U1366C was spudded at $1345\mathrm{~h~}$ on 30 October and advanced with the APC system to 25 mbsf before encountering basement. Seafloor was established at 5140.5 mbrf. Three cores were taken with a total recovery of $25.42\textrm{m}$ ( $101.7\%$ recovery). The drill string was then tripped to just above the mudline, clearing the seafloor at $1715\;\mathrm{h}$ on 30 October and ending Hole U1366C.  

# Hole U1366D  

Hole U1366D began at $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ when the APC assembly cleared the seafloor after completing Hole U1366C. After offsetting the vessel $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east, Hole U1366D was spudded at $1800\;\mathrm{h}$ on 30 October and advanced with the APC system for three cores to 18.9 mbsf with an $18.86\;\mathrm{m}$ recovery $g9.8\%$ recovery). Seafloor was established at 5137.1 mbrf. After APC refusal, an XCB core barrel was deployed and advanced $2\,\mathrm{m}$ into the formation without any recovery. After the last core, the drill string was tripped to just above the mudline, clearing the seafloor at $2330~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 October and ending Hole U1366D.  

# Hole U1366E  

After clearing the seafloor, the vessel was offset $40\textrm{m}$ west and the drill string was spaced out to spud Hole U1366E. After making up the first APC core barrel, the core barrel was run to bottom on the wireline and Hole U1366E was spudded at $0015\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 October. Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5138.8 mbrf. APC coring consisted of a single mudline core to 4.7 mbsf.

# Site U1370  

Six holes were drilled or cored at Site U1370. The first hole was a washdown hole drilled with the center bit in order to establish the sediment depth of 66.7 mbsf and any hard layers (chert) throughout the formation. Hole U1370B had one mudline core taken before coring problems forced abandonment of the hole. Hole U1370C was drilled to $7.8\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , and the attempt to take a piston core failed. The last three holes were cored successfully with the APC system. The APCT-3 was deployed four times on Holes U1370D and U1370E.

The total length of core recovered at this site was $214.59\,\mathrm{m}$ . The overall recovery for Site U1370 using the APC coring system was $104\%$ .  

# Hole U1370A  

Rig floor operations commenced at 1602 h on 26 November 2010. The trip to the seafloor was uneventful. The top drive was picked up, the drill string was spaced out, and the hole was spudded at $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 November. The washdown hole was drilled to determine depth of basement. Mudline was established as 5085.7 mbrf using an offset depth from Hole U1370B. After drilling down, basement was established at 5150.4 mbrf (64.7 mbsf). Basement depth was verified by drilling two additional meters into the basement. The bit was pulled back above the seafloor, clearing the seafloor at 0620 h and ending Hole U1370A.  

# Hole U1370B  

After clearing the seafloor, the center bit was pulled by wireline, the vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west, and the drill string was spaced out to spud Hole U1370B. After making up the first APC core barrel, the core barrel was run to bottom on the wireline and Hole U1370B was spudded at $0745\mathrm{~h~}$ on 27 November. Seafloor depth was established at 5085.7 mbrf with a mudline core. APC coring was terminated after the second core attempt. It appeared as if there was something blocking the seal-bore collar that was preventing the core barrel from seating. The center bit was deployed in order to verify a clean seal-bore assembly and to check flow against the slow circulating rates taken at the start of the hole. Subsequent problems determined that it was most likely the shear pins failing during the deployment of the core barrel. The hole was terminated and several remedial measures were implemented. One core was taken with a total recovery of $7.81\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(100.1\%)$ . After Core 329-U1370B-1H was recovered, the bit was tripped back to just above the sea floor, ending Hole U1370B at $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 November.  

# Hole U1370C  

Hole U1370C began at $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ when the APC assembly cleared the seafloor after completing Hole U1370B. After offsetting the vessel $20\;\mathrm{m}$ north, an attempt to spud Hole U1370C was made. After multiple wireline runs and multiple attempts to spud Hole U1370C, the hole was spudded at $1810\,\mathrm{h}$ in an attempt to advance the hole and coring began. During the effort to continue coring, several remediation efforts were attempted. The root problem seemed to be shear pin failure during the wireline trip into the hole. Rig instrumentation indicated that the core line received increasingly high tension variation as the core line was run to greater depth. Variations were \~2500 lb of force. An extra shear pin was added to the system in an effort to land the core barrel with the shear pin assembly intact. This still failed. A $90^{\circ}$ heading change was made to try to reduce the overall heave of the vessel. Decreasing weather and the heading change successfully reduced the heave by over a meter. In an attempt to dampen the tension variation, the compensator was opened for core barrel deployment. After a drilled advance of $7.8~\mathrm{m}$ , the core barrel was finally deployed without the shear pin failure that had been experienced all day. With three shear pins installed and the core barrel landed, the mud pump pressure was insufficient to shear the pins and shoot the APC core barrel. Consequently, the core barrel was pulled to the surface and redressed with new shear system components and two shear pins. Hole U1370C was abandoned and the bit cleared the seafloor at $2000\;\mathrm{h}$ on 27 November, ending Hole U1370C.

After Core 9H, the bit was advanced and rotated into basement to verify basement depth (65.6 mbsf) and the bit was tripped back to just above the seafloor, ending Hole U1370E at $0855\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 November.  

# Hole U1370F  

Hole U1370F began at $0855\,\mathrm{h}$ when the APC assembly cleared the seafloor after completing Hole U1370E. The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1370E. After making up the first APC core barrel, the core barrel was run to bottom on the wireline and Hole U1370F was spudded at $1010\;\mathrm{h}$ . Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5084.8 mbrf. The APC system was used to take eight cores to 64.7 mbsf with a $66.32\mathrm{~m~}$ recovery $(102.5\%)$ . PFT was mixed with the drilling fluid (sea water) and pumped on all cores for contamination testing. After Core 329-U1370F-8H, the bit was advanced and rotated into basement to verify basement depth (64.7 mbsf). The drill string was tripped to the surface, clearing the rotary table at $0530~\mathrm{h}$ on $30\;\mathrm{No}.$ - vember. The rig floor was secured for the $499\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to the next site, ending Hole U1370F and Site U1370 at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Transit to Site U1371  

After a $51\,\mathrm{h}$ transit from Site U1370, covering $499\;\mathrm{nmi}$ and averaging 9.8 kt, the speed was reduced and thrusters were lowered. Dynamic positioning was initiated over Site U1371 at $0907\;\mathrm{h}$ on 2 December 2010. The position reference was a combination of GPS signals. No acoustic beacon was deployed, but a beacon remained on standby in the event of a loss of GPS satellite coverage. Whereas automatic input into the dynamic positioning system was not possible because of a system malfunction, it was possible to manually hold the vessel in position to clear the sea floor with the BHA if necessary.  

# Site U1371  

Eight holes were drilled or cored at Site U1371. The first hole was a washdown hole drilled with the center bit in order to establish the sediment depth of 122.5 mbsf. The entire time on site was plagued by high vessel heave, which hindered the APC coring. The first APC hole at the site came back with a disturbed mudline core and was abandoned. The second attempt at a mudline resulted in an over penetration without securing mudline and was abandoned as well. The following three APC holes were successfully cored to refusal. With the remaining time, an additional two holes were cored for mudline cores. The APCT-3 was deployed five times on Hole U1371D. PFT was pumped from Hole U1371E onward until the last core was on deck. APC system recovery for Site U1371 was $94.9\%$ . A total of 46 cores were attempted while coring $410.0\:\mathrm{m}$ . The total length of core recovered at Site U1370 was $389.01\;\mathrm{m}$ $94.9\%$ recovery).  

# Hole U1371A  

Rig floor operations commenced at $0907\;\mathrm{h}$ on 2 December 2010. The trip to the seafloor was uneventful. The top drive was picked up, the drill string was spaced out, and the hole was spudded at $1845\mathrm{~h~}$ on 2 December. The washdown hole was drilled to determine depth of basement. Mudline was established as 5316.0 mbrf using the drill bit–tagged depth. There were no anomalies detected during the washdown to basement. After drilling down, basement was established at 5438.5 mbrf (122.5 mbsf). Total depth of the hole was 5439.5 mbrf after the bit was advanced into basement to verify basement contact. The bit was pulled back above the seafloor, clearing the seafloor at $2350\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 December and ending Hole U1371A.  

# Hole U1371B  

After clearing the seafloor, the center bit was pulled by wireline, the vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west, and the drill string was spaced out to spud Hole U1371B. After making up the first APC core barrel, the core barrel was run to bottom on the wireline and fired from 5310 mbrf. The core barrel came back empty and the bit was repositioned to 5315 mbrf. Hole U1371B was spudded at $0300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 December. Seafloor depth was established at 5316.4 mbrf $\langle5305.1~\mathrm{mbsl}\rangle$ ) with a mudline core. Vessel heave during spud in was ${\sim}4\textrm{m}$ . The first mudline core was too disturbed for science and the hole was terminated. One core was taken with a total recovery of $8.15~\mathrm{m}$ for an overall recovery in Hole U1371B of $100.6\%$ . After Core 329-U1371B-1H, the vessel was moved $20\;\mathrm{m}$ north, ending Hole U1371B at $0300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 December.  

# Hole U1371C  

Hole U1371C began at $0300~\mathrm{h}$ after abandoning Hole U1371B. After offsetting the vessel $20\,\mathrm{m}$ north, Hole U1371C spudded at $0445\,\mathrm{h}$ . Core 329-U1371C-1H came back with a full core barrel and no obvious mudline. Shoot depth was $5312{\mathrm{~mbrf}}$ , which was $3\;\mathrm{m}$ higher than the shoot depth for Hole U1371B. The best explanation for another mudline failure was the high heave $(\succ4\mathrm{~m})$ at the time of spudding. One core was taken in Hole U1371C, with a total recovery of $9.85\mathrm{~m~}$ $(103.5\%)$ . Hole U1371C was abandoned after the first core and the vessel was moved $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east on 3 December, ending Hole U1371C at $0445\;\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Hole U1371D  

Hole U1371D was spudded $20\textrm{m}$ east of Hole U1371C at $0635\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 3 December. Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5311.1 mbrf (5299.9 mbsl). Orientation with the Flexit tools was done on Cores 329-U1371D-1H through 11H. APCT-3 measurements were taken on Cores 4H–6H, 8H, and 10H. All temperature measurements returned good data. While pulling Core 6H, the coring line parted at the wire rope socket and the core barrel and sinker bars fell back inside the drill pipe. The wireline was removed from the hole and reheaded at surface. The aft sinker bars were installed and a rotary core barrel was dropped to $\sqrt{\mathrm{{fish}^{\prime\prime}}}$ the forward sinker bars. The sinker bars were recovered by wireline, and Core 6H was recovered. Total time from the incident to resumption of coring was $5.5\;\mathrm{h}$ . Coring continued until refusal on Core 14H. The APC system was used to take 14 cores to 126.0 mbsf with $126.87\;\mathrm{m}$ recovery $(100.7\%)$ . After Core 14H, the bit was advanced and rotated into basement to verify basement depth. The bit was tripped back to just above the seafloor, ending Hole U1371D at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 December.  

# Hole U1371E  

Hole U1371E began with the ship offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1471D. Hole U1371E was spudded at $1605\ \mathrm{h}$ on 4 December. Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5310.2 mbrf. The APC system was used to take 14 cores to 128.2 mbsf with a $118.16\,\mathrm{m}$ recovery $(92.2\%)$ . Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for the first 12 cores. PFT was mixed with the drilling fluid (sea water) and pumped on all cores for contamination testing. After Core 329-U1371E-14H, the bit was advanced and rotated into basement to confirm basement depth and tripped back to just above the seafloor, ending Hole U1371E at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 December.  

# Hole U1371F  

Hole U1371F was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1371E. After making up the first APC core barrel, it was run to bottom on the wireline and Hole U1371F was spudded at $1205\;\mathrm{h}$ on 5 December. Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5308.3 mbrf. The APC system was used to take 14 cores to 130.6 mbsf with a $118.44\;\mathrm{m}$ recovery $(90.7\%)$ . PFT was mixed with the drilling fluid (sea water) and pumped on all cores for contamination testing. After Core 329-U1371F-14H, the bit was advanced and rotated into basement to verify basement depth and APC advance. The drill string was tripped to just above the seafloor, ending Hole U1371F at $0655\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December.  

# Hole U1371G  

Hole U1371G was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1371F. After making up the first APC core barrel, the core barrel was run to bottom on the wireline and Hole U1371G was spudded at $0755\mathrm{~h~}$ on 6 December. Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5314.1 mbrf. The APC system was used to take a single core to 1.4 mbsf with a $1.37\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovery $(97.9\%)$ . PFT was mixed with the drilling fluid (sea water) and pumped on for contamination testing. After taking mudline Core 329-U1371G-1H, a second core (test Core 329-U1371G-2H) was taken for training purposes. The drill string was tripped to just above the seafloor, ending Hole U1371G at $0945\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December.  

# Hole U1371H  

Hole U1371H was offset $20\textrm{m}$ west of Hole U1371G. After making up the first APC core barrel, the core barrel was run to bottom on the wireline and Hole U1371H was spudded at $1030~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December. Seafloor depth was established with a mudline core at 5310.3 mbrf. The APC system was used to take a single core to 6.2 mbsf with a $6.19\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovery $(99.8\%)$ . PFT was mixed with the drilling fluid (sea water) and pumped in for contamination testing. After taking mudline Core 329-U1371H-1H, the drill string was tripped to the surface, clearing the rotary table at $2326\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December. The rig floor was secured for the $1172~\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Auckland, ending the final hole and site of Expedition 329 at $2326\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December.  

# Site summaries  

# Site U1365  

The scientific objectives at Site U1365 are  

1. To document the nature of subseafloor life in very old $(>\!100\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and slowly accumulating organic-poor sediments;   
2. To test how oceanographic factors (such as surface ocean productivity, sedimentation rate and distance from shore) control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities, and communities from gyre center to gyre margin;   
3. To quantify the extent to which subseafloor communities in organic-poor sediment are sustained by $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from radiolysis of water; and   
4. To determine how basement habitats, potential activities, and, if measurable, communities vary with basalt age and hydrologic regime (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

Site U1365 (5708 mbsl) is centrally located in ocean crust formed during the CNS. The tectonic history of this Australia-sized area is poorly constrained because correlatable magnetic seafloor anomalies are not present. Consequently, radiometric dating of the recovered basalt will provide important constraints on the tectonic and volcanic history of this region.  

The complete sedimentary succession was recovered by APC coring in Hole U1365A. Excluding a drilled-over chert interval in the lower sediment column, complete successions were also recovered from Holes U1365B and U1365C. Core recovery in the underlying basalt was unusually high $(75\%)$ . However, slow penetration $(<\!1\;\mathrm{m/h})$ allowed us to drill only ${\sim}50\mathrm{~m~}$ of basalt, preventing us from reaching sufficient depth below seafloor to deploy downhole logging tools.  

# Principal results  

Sediment  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1365 is composed of three units. Unit I consists of medium-brown zeolitic metalliferous pelagic clay (0–44 mbsf). Unit II consists of porcellanite and chert (44–65 mbsf). Unit III consists of dark brown metalliferous clay $(65{-}75~\mathrm{mbsf})$ (Fig. F15).  

Microbial cell counts are three or more orders of magnitude lower than at the same sediment depths in all sites previously cored by scientific ocean drilling and decline to near the minimum detection limit (MDL) at 15 mbsf. They are above the MDL (1.4 $\times\,10^{3}\,\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ in many samples (and below the MDL in many other samples) for the remainder of Unit I (Fig. F16). Because the chert cannot be disaggregated, the presence or absence of cells cannot be determined in Unit II. Cell counts are consistently below the MDL in the metalliferous clay at the base of the sediment column (Unit III).  

Dissolved oxygen is present throughout the entire sediment column at Site U1365. It declines most rapidly in the first several meters of the sediment column and then declines at increasingly lower rates with increasing depth in Unit I (Fig. F17). We could not measure its concentration in the chert and porcellanite of Unit II. Its concentration is essentially constant throughout Unit III.  

Dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate, and dissolved inorganic carbon are also present throughout the sediment column. The increase in dissolved nitrate concentration (from ${\sim}35$ to $45~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ ) over the first 20 mbsf is consistent with nitrate production by oxygen-fueled reduction of organic matter (Fig. F17). Below the chert-dominated interval, dissolved nitrate concentration approximates the present deepwater value.  

Dissolved hydrogen concentration is below detection throughout most of the sediment column (with the exception of a $30\;\mathrm{nM}$ peak centered at $30\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ).  

The concentration of TN declines rapidly in the first 10 mbsf from 0.05 to 0.01 wt%. It then declines more slowly, until it drops consistently beneath its MDL $({\sim}0.007\$ $\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) at 38 mbsf. Consistently, TOC declines rapidly over the first few meters below seafloor (from $\sim\!0.2$ to $0.05~\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and remains below $0.05~\mathrm{wt\%}$ for the remainder of the sediment column (Fig. F18).  

# Basalt  

The drilled sequence of basement rock is composed of a series of massive basalt flows (Fig. F14). Massive flows at the top of deep-sea basement are unusual in ocean drilling history (e.g., Site 1256 and Site 1243 [interpreted as a lava pond]). The low-temperature alteration is similar to alteration in the uppermost basalt at other ocean drilling sites (Menard, Natland, Jordan, Orcutt, et al., 1987; Laverne et al., 1996; Teagle et al., 1996, 2006).  

Relationships between igneous unit boundaries and alteration indicate that alteration at Site U1365 is strongly controlled by the structure of the basalt (Fig. F14). Ingress of seawater, secondary mineral precipitation, and wall-rock interaction is primarily restricted to regions between lava flows. A direct relationship between visual observations of alteration and NGR-based potassium content (Fig. F14) indicates that NGR can provide a more accurate and quantitative approach to estimating alteration extent than visual interpretation alone.  

Secondary minerals provide evidence of both oxidative and oxygen-poor alteration. Some samples have undergone several stages of vein opening and halo emplacement. Minerals indicative of oxygen-poor alteration are most prevalent toward the base of the drilled basalt column.  

Tubelike micro-scale weathering features occur in altered glass and discrete clusters or masses adjacent to fractures and iron oxyhydroxide (Fig. F12). Similar features have been observed in marine basaltic glass elsewhere and attributed to microbial origin (Fisk et al., 1998).  

Multiple episodes of late-stage calcite precipitation and vein infill have occurred at Site U1365. These late fills suggest that alteration may be continuous or at least occur intermittently during the life of the ocean crust. Dissolved concentrations of magnesium and calcium in the lowermost sediment indicate that basalt-water interaction in the form of Mg exchange for Ca has occurred since seawater migrated into the formation. This exchange may continue to drive late-stage calcite precipitation.  

# General results  

Downhole temperature was measured using the APCT-3. Six measurements give a least-squares thermal gradient of $76^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km}$ . This result closely agrees with the thermal gradient observed by site survey cruise KNOX-02RR of $74^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km}$ (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2007). The heat flow of $61\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ is typical for crust of this age. Bottom water temperature is $1.22^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and temperature at the sediment/basement interface is estimated to be $6.8^{\circ}C$ . These temperatures are well within the range inhabited by psychrophilic microbes.  

A wide range of microbiology experiments was initiated shipboard. Experiments on major microbial processes and cultivation of viable microbes were initiated on samples taken at selected depths ranging from near the sediment/water interface to nearly $50\,\mathrm{m}$ into the basaltic basement. Subsamples for shore-based biogeochemical and molecular ecological studies were routinely taken from all of the distinct lithologic units.  

# Site U1366  

The scientific objectives at Site U1366 are  

1. To document the habitats, metabolic activities, genetic composition, and biomass of microbial communities in subseafloor sediment with very low total activity;   
2. To test how oceanographic factors control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities, and communities from gyre center to gyre margin;   
3. To quantify the extent to which these sedimentary communities may be supplied with electron donors by water radiolysis; and   
4. To assess from porewater chemistry how basement habitats and potential activities vary in the underlying basalt with crust age and sediment thickness (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

Site U1366 (5127 mbsl) is located in ocean crust formed during the CNS. The complete sedimentary succession, from seafloor to underlying basalt, was recovered by APC coring in Hole U1366F. Partial successions, from seafloor to various depths, were also recovered from Holes U1366B–U1366E.  

# Principal results  

The sediment at Site U1366 is primarily clay and is assigned to two lithologic units: zeolitic metalliferous pelagic clay (Unit I) and metalliferous clay (Unit II) (Fig. F19). The principal components of the sediment are smectite, mica-group members, phillipsite, and red-brown to yellow-brown semiopaque oxide (RSO). Manganese nodules are relatively common at the seafloor and at depth in Unit I. The nodules generally produce peaks in NGR, magnetic susceptibility, and gamma ray attenuation density.  

Both clay and zeolite exhibit overall trends of decreasing abundance with increasing depth.  

NGR core logging can be used to quantify in situ concentrations of potassium, $^{238}\mathrm{U}.$ - series isotopes and $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ -series isotopes (Fig. F20). Prominent NGR features at Site U1366 include (1) a pronounced peak in $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ -series isotopes just below the seafloor and (2) NGR peaks associated with manganese nodules, which were temporarily removed from the core for additional NGR logging. The manganese nodules (at the seafloor and at depth) do not contribute to the $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ -isotope peak just below the seafloor.  

Cell counts for Site U1366 sediment are three or more orders of magnitude lower than at the same depths in all sediment cored gathered by previous scientific ocean drilling expeditions. Cell counts range from below the MDL $(1.4\times10^{3}\,\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ to nearly $10^{4}$ cells $\prime\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . They do not exhibit any consistent trend with depth (Fig. F21).  

The concentration of TN declines steadily from $0.04\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ at the seafloor to below detection at 15 mbsf. TOC declines downhole to ${\sim}0.03\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ at 10.75 mbsf (Fig. F22). Dissolved oxygen is present throughout the entire sediment column. Its concentration drops rapidly by $20\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$ in the first 3 mbsf and declines linearly with depth to $\mathord{\sim}110$ $\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at the sediment/basalt interface. Over the first ${\sim}10$ mbsf, dissolved nitrate and DIC increase slightly in concentration (from ${\sim}35$ to ${\sim}40\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ and ${\sim}2.5$ to ${\sim}2.7\ \mathrm{mM}$ , respectively) (Fig. F23A, F23B). Both are relatively stable for the remainder of the sediment column. These gradual increases are consistent with oxygen-fueled reduction of organic matter in the first 10 mbsf. Dissolved hydrogen concentration is below detection throughout the first $15\textrm{m}$ of the sediment column but rises by several tens of nanno mols as the basaltic basement is approached. Chloride concentrations increase monotonically from ${\sim}550~\mathrm{mM}$ to reach a maximum of ${\sim}570~\mathrm{mM}$ in the deepest $5\textrm{m}$ of the sediment column (a $3\%$ increase) (Fig. F23C). This increase is most likely due to relict glacial seawater and, possibly, hydration of the underlying basement.  

A wide range of microbiology experiments was initiated shipboard. Experiments on major microbial processes and cultivations of viable microbes were initiated on samples taken at selected depths ranging from near the sediment/water interface to the sediment/basement contact. Subsamples for shore-based biogeochemical and molecular ecological studies were routinely taken from all of the distinct lithologic units.  

# Site U1367  

Site U1367 was selected as a drilling target because (1) its microbial activities and cell counts were expected to be characteristic of a setting midway between the western gyre edge and the gyre center, and (2) its basement age renders it a reasonable location for documenting microbial habitability and testing the extent of basalt alteration and openness to flow in a thinly sedimented region of ${\sim}33.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ basaltic basement.  

The principal objectives at Site U1367 are  

1. To document the habitats, metabolic activities, genetic composition, and biomass of microbial communities in subseafloor sediment with very low total activity;   
2. To test how oceanographic factors control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities, and communities from gyre center to gyre margin;   
3. To quantify the extent to which these sedimentary communities may be supplied with electron donors by water radiolysis; and   
4. To determine how habitats, potential activities and, if measurable, communities in subseafloor basalt vary with crust age and hydrologic regime (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

Site U1367 $(4285~\mathrm{mbsl})$ ) is located in ocean crust formed during magnetic polarity Chron 13n (33.3–33.7 Ma; Gradstein et al., 2004). The complete sedimentary succession, from seafloor to underlying basalt, was recovered by APC coring in Holes U1367B–U1367E. The sediment/basalt contact varies by a few meters from hole to hole. The lowermost sediment and fragments of the underlying basalt were recovered by RCB coring in Hole U1367F. Core recovery of the basalt was unusually low $(11\%)$ . Continuous infall of basaltic debris forced us to terminate the hole early, preventing us from reaching sufficient depth below seafloor to deploy downhole logging tools.  

# Principal results  

# Sediment  

The sediment at Site U1367 is composed of $5.5–7\textrm{m}$ of pelagic clay (Unit I) overlying $\sim\!16\;\mathrm{m}$ of Oligocene carbonate ooze (Unit II) (Fig. F24). The principal components of the clay are smectite and mica-group members, phillipsite (a zeolite), and RSO. The ooze is composed mainly of coccolithophores and RSO, accompanied by foraminifers. The clay and ooze differ significantly in several physical properties, including porosity, bulk density, electrical conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, and NGR. The transition from clay to ooze is gradual. The depth of the sediment/basalt interface varies by ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ from hole to hole. Although unit thickness and composition vary from hole to hole, general sediment composition is very similar in each hole.  

Microbial cell counts decline rapidly from $\mathrm{\sim}10^{5}$ cells $\prime\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at 0.15 mbsf to the MDL ( $^{10^{3}}$ cells $^{\prime}\mathrm{cm}^{3},$ ) at 2 mbsf. They are mostly below the MDL throughout the remaining sediment column.  

The concentration of TN declines to below detection in the first 7 mbsf (from $0.03\%$ to $0.0\%$ ). TOC declines from 0.17 to $0.02~\mathrm{wt\%}$ over the same interval. Dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate, and DIC are present throughout the sediment column (Fig. F25). Dissolved oxygen also occurs throughout the column. Dissolved hydrogen concentration is below detection in most of the clay but above detection in most samples of the carbonate.  

# Basalt  

The recovered sequence of basement rock is composed of pillow basalt fragments with prominent chill margins. Secondary mineralization and wall-rock interaction is limited in the recovered basalt. However, it is likely that the most altered portions of the basalt were not recovered.  

A wide range of microbiology experiments was initiated shipboard. Experiments on major microbial processes and cultivations of viable microbes were initiated on samples taken at selected depths ranging from near the sediment-water interface to ${\sim}30$ m into the basaltic basement. Subsamples were routinely taken from all of the distinct lithologic units for postcruise molecular assays and microbiological experiments.  

# Site U1368  

Site U1368 was selected as a drilling target because (1) its microbial activities and cell counts were expected to be characteristic of the gyre center and (2) its basement age renders it a reasonable location for testing the extent of microbial habitability and basalt alteration in a thinly sedimented region of ${\sim}13.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ basaltic basement.  

The principal objectives at Site U1368 are  

1. To document the habitats, metabolic activities, genetic composition, and biomass of microbial communities in subseafloor sediment with very low total activity;  

2. To test how oceanographic factors control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities, and communities from gyre center to gyre margin,   
3. To quantify the extent to which these sedimentary communities may be supplied with electron donors by water radiolysis; and   
4. To determine how habitats, potential activities, and, if measurable, communities in subseafloor basalt vary with crust age and hydrologic regime (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

Site U1368 (3738 mbsl) is located in ocean crust formed during magnetic polarity Chron 5ABn (13.4–13.6 Ma; Gradstein et al., 2004). Most or all of the sedimentary succession was recovered by APC coring in Holes U1368B–U1368E. Basalt fragments were recovered from the basal cores of Holes U1368B and U1368D. The upper $\mathord{\sim}100$ m of basalt was cored using RCB in Hole U1368F. Approximately $60\,\mathrm{m}$ of the basaltic basement was logged with both the triple combo and the FMS tool string.  

# Principal results  

# Sediment  

The sediment at Site U1368 is $15{-}16\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists of calcareous ooze, pelagic clay, and lithic sand. An additional $^{1\textrm{m}}$ of volcaniclastic breccia was recovered from an interval between basalt flows, $80\,\mathrm{m}$ below the upper sediment/basalt interface. The principal components of the ooze are calcareous nannofossils accompanied by RSO and foraminifers (Fig. F26). Planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy indicates that the calcareous ooze spans from the middle Miocene to the middle Pliocene. Clay minerals are in relatively low abundance throughout the sediment. The lowermost sediment contains one to three sandy intervals that collectively contain a wide variety of minerals, including albite-anorthite, ankerite, augite, calcite, chlorite, hematite, and titanomagnetite. The volcaniclastic breccia contains altered basaltic lithic and vitric grains.  

Microbial cell counts decline rapidly from $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}\,\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ just below the seafloor to slightly more than $10^{3}~\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at ${\sim}5$ mbsf. They hover near the MDL ( $10^{3}$ cells/ $\mathrm{cm}^{3},$ ) for the remainder of the sediment column.  

The concentration of TN declines to below detection in the first $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ below seafloor. TOC declines to $0.03\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ over the first 0.5 mbsf and remains low for the remainder of the sediment column. Dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate, DIC, and dissolved oxygen are present throughout the sediment column. Dissolved hydrogen concentration is below detection for the first 9.4 mbsf but above detection in half of the samples at greater depth (Fig. F27).  

# Basalt  

The recovered sequence of basement rock is composed of pillow basalt fragments with prominent chill margins.  

Estimates of potassium content derived from downhole NGR logging agree closely with potassium concentration estimates derived from NGR logging of whole-round cores (Fig. F28).  

A wide range of microbiology experiments was initiated shipboard. Experiments on major microbial processes and cultivations of viable microbes were initiated on samples from selected depths ranging from near the sediment/water interface to ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ into the basaltic basement. Subsamples were routinely taken from all of the distinct lithologic units for postcruise molecular assays and microbiological experiments.  

# Site U1369  

Site U1369 was selected as a drilling target because (1) its microbial activities and cell counts were expected to be characteristic of midway between gyre center and the southern gyre edge and (2) its basement age renders it a reasonable location for testing the extent of sediment-basement interaction in a thinly sedimented region of ${\sim}58\,\mathrm{Ma}$ basaltic basement.  

The principal objectives at Site U1369 are  

1. To document the habitats, metabolic activities, genetic composition, and biomass of microbial communities in subseafloor sediment with very low total activity;   
2. To test how oceanographic factors control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities, and communities from gyre center to gyre margin;   
3. To quantify the extent to which these sedimentary communities may be supplied with electron donors by water radiolysis; and   
4. To determine how sediment-basement exchange and potential activities in the basaltic basement vary with basement age and hydrologic regime (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

Site U1369 is located in the South Pacific Gyre at 5277 mbsl. Basement age is estimated from extrapolated magnetic models and changes in spreading rate recorded by neighboring magnetic profiles. Our best estimate of the crustal age is ${\sim}58\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and corresponds to magnetic polarity Chron 25r ( $57.2–58.4~\mathrm{Ma}$ ; Gradstein et al., 2004). The sedimentary succession was recovered by APC coring in Holes U1369B, U1369C, and U1369E. Basalt fragments were recovered from the basal cores of these holes.

# Sediment  

The sediment at Site U1369 consists of $\sim\!16\;\mathrm{m}$ of zeolitic metalliferous clay. The sediment is massive in texture and contains visible burrows throughout. The principal components of the clay are phillipsite, RSO, and clay (Fig. F29). Manganese nodules were recovered from the sediment/water interface and from deeper in the sediment column. Micro- and nannofossils are almost completely absent. The sediment/basalt interface consists of vitric sand overlying altered basalt. Sediment thickness and composition are fairly uniform from hole to hole.  

Microbial cell counts decline rapidly from ${\sim}10^{5}~\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ just below the seafloor to ${\sim}10^{3}\;\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at $\sim\!2$ mbsf (Fig. F30). They are below the MDL $({\sim}10^{3}\;\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ for the remainder of the sediment column.  

TN and TOC decrease rapidly from near the seafloor to ${\sim}3$ mbsf and are extremely low for the remainder of the sediment column. Dissolved oxygen, dissolved nitrate, dissolved phosphate, and DIC are present throughout the sediment column (Fig. F31). Dissolved hydrogen concentration is consistently low throughout the column.  

A wide range of microbiology experiments was initiated shipboard. Experiments on major microbial processes and cultivations of viable microbes were initiated with samples from selected depths ranging from near the sediment/water interface to the sediment/basalt interface. Subsamples were routinely taken from all of the distinct lithologic units for postcruise molecular assays and microbiological experiments.  

# Site U1370  

Site U1370 was selected as a drilling target because (1) its microbial activities and cell counts were expected to be characteristic of midway between gyre center and the southern gyre edge and (2) its basement age renders it a reasonable location for testing the extent of sediment-basement interaction in a moderately sedimented region 74– $80\;\mathrm{Ma}$ basaltic basement.  

The principal objectives at Site U1370 are  

1. To document the habitats, metabolic activities, genetic composition, and biomass of microbial communities in subseafloor sediment with low total activity;   
2. To test how oceanographic factors control variation in sedimentary habitats, activities, and communities from gyre center to gyre margin;   
3. To quantify the extent to which these communities may be supplied with electron donors by water radiolysis; and   
4. To determine how sediment-basement exchange and potential activities in the basaltic basement vary with basement age and hydrologic regime (from ridge crest to abyssal plain).  

Site U1370 is located in the South Pacific Gyre at 5074 mbsl. The coring site is located within magnetic polarity Chron $33\mathrm{n}$ , so the crustal age may range from 73.6 to 79.5 Ma (Gradstein et al., 2004). The sedimentary succession was recovered by APC coring in Holes U1370D, U1370E, and U1370F. Altered basaltic fragments were recovered from the basal cores of Holes U1370D and U1370F.  

# Principal results  

# Sediment  

The sediment at Site U1370 is ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{m}$ thick. The dominant lithology is dark brown zeolitic metalliferous pelagic clay (Fig. F32). The principal components of the clay are RSO, phillipsite, and smectite. Unit I lies between the sediment/water interface and the top of a nannofossil ooze (Unit II) at ${\sim}61$ mbsf. Unit II is a relatively short (30–290 cm) pale yellow interval predominantly composed of coccolithophores, with trace phillipsite, and clay. Unit III is a thin clay interval containing $88\%$ RSO and $12\%$ clay that directly overlays the basaltic basement. Although volcanic glass is locally abundant $(\sim\!43\%)$ in Unit I, its overall abundance is only $7\%$ , and it is completely absent in Units II and III. A large, fragmented manganese nodule was recovered in Hole U1370D at $10\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ , and fragments of a manganese-encrusted hardground were in recovered in Hole U1370F at 52 mbsf.  

Overall sediment structure at Site U1370 is massive, although occasional laminations and thin beds are visible in the lower half of Unit I. Planolites (horizontal) burrows are faintly visible in most of the clay and Trichichnus (vertical) burrows blend the upper  

and lower contacts of the nannofossil ooze and the overlying and underlying clay.   
Sediment thickness and composition are uniform from hole to hole.  

The nannofossil ooze was deposited during early Paleocene foraminiferal Zone P1. Its occurrence in this deep-sea clay sequence is attributed to deepening of the CCD and lysocline during the interval of decreased planktonic carbonate precipitation that followed the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (D’Hondt, 2005).  

Microbial cell counts were above the MDL ( ${\sim}10^{3}$ cells $\mathbf{\chi}_{\mathrm{cm}^{3}}$ ) throughout much of the sediment column.  

The dissolved oxygen and nitrate profiles at Site U1370 (Fig. F33) exhibit much greater curvature than the profiles at previous Expedition 329 sites. Dissolved oxygen concentration decreases sharply in the first several meters below seafloor and then more gradually to 40 mbsf. Below that depth, it decreases monotonically from ${\sim}10$ $\upmu\mathrm{M}$ to a few micro mols at the sediment/basalt interface. The rate of increase in dissolved nitrate concentration from surface sediment to 20 mbsf is higher than at previous sites (U1365–U1369), suggesting that organic nitrogen oxidation in the sediment is greater here than at those sites. The changes in dissolved oxygen and nitrate throughout the upper sediment column are attributed to oxygen consuming organic oxidation by sedimentary microbes.  

# Basalt  

Dissolved potassium concentration declines nearly linearly with depth in the sediment (Fig. F34), indicating a sink for dissolved potassium in the underlying basaltic basement. This sink is inferred to be basalt alteration (clay formation).  

A wide range of microbiology experiments was initiated shipboard. Experiments on major microbial processes and cultivations of viable microbes were initiated with samples taken at selected depths ranging from near the sediment/water interface to the sediment/basalt interface. Subsamples were routinely taken from all of the distinct lithologic units for postcruise molecular assays and microbiological experiments.  

# Site U1371  

Site U1371 was selected as a drilling target because (1) its microbial activities and cell counts were expected to be characteristic of the upwelling region just south of the gyre and (2) its basement age renders it a reasonable location for testing the extent of sediment-basement interaction in a moderately sedimented region of 71.5–73 Ma basaltic basement.  

The principal objectives at Site U1371 are  

1. To document the nature of life in moderately slowly accumulating sediments of great age (as old as $73\,\mathrm{Ma}_{}$ ), where the surface ocean is characterized by moderate mean chlorophyll content $(<\!3{\mathrm{~mg}}/{\mathrm{m}}^{3})$ ;   
2. To determine the extent to which basement age, thermal regime, and chemical transport through the $73\,\mathrm{\,Ma}$ basaltic basement affect microbial communities and biogeochemical processes in the sediment and the extent to which chemical transport and microbial activities in the sediment affect the alteration and habitability of the basaltic basement;   
3. To provide a much higher activity standard of comparison for the sites within the gyre (Sites U1365–U1370); and   
4. To test the extent to which life in this sediment may be supplied with an electron donor (dissolved hydrogen) by radiolysis of water.  

Site U1371 is located in the South Pacific Gyre at ${\sim}5300$ mbsl. The coring site is located within magnetic polarity Chron $32\mathbf{n}.2\mathbf{n}$ , so the crustal age may range from 71.5 to $72.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Gradstein et al., 2004). Based on a tectonic reconstruction of the region by Larson et al. (2002), the crust was accreted along the Pacific-Phoenix spreading center at ${\sim}73\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The sedimentary succession was recovered by APC coring in Holes U1371D–U1371F. Additional mudline cores were recovered in Holes U1371B, U1371C, U1371G, and U1371H. Altered basaltic fragments were recovered from the basal core of Hole U1371F.  

# Principal results  

# Sediment  

The sediment at Site U1371 consists of ${\sim}130~\mathrm{m}$ of diatom ooze and pelagic clay, divided into two units based on their sharply contrasting mineralogy (Fig. F35). Unit I is ooze with average diatom and clay content of $56\%$ and $17\%$ , respectively. It is 104– $107~\mathrm{m}$ thick and contains numerous ash layers and multiple thin hardgrounds. Unit II is a blend of clay $(32\%)$ , zeolite $(30\%)$ , and red-brown to yellow-brown semiopaque iron-manganese oxyhydroxides $(15\%)$ . The transition from ooze to clay constitutes the upper $5\textrm{m}$ of Unit II; this portion of Unit II contains as much as $26\%$ diatoms.  

Other minor sedimentary components at Site U1371 include quartz, pyrite, manganese oxide/hydroxide, radiolarians, spicules, and silicoflagellates.  

The clay-bearing diatom ooze and pelagic clay at Site U1371 form interbedded intervals of highly fossiliferous and clay-rich layers. Bioturbation is a prominent feature of the sediment, causing diffuse boundaries on most beds. Overall sediment thickness and composition appear to be broadly uniform from hole to hole.  

Microbial cell counts were above the MDL ( ${\sim}10^{3}$ cells $^{\prime}\mathrm{cm}^{3},$ ) throughout much of the sediment column.  

Profiles of dissolved chemicals clearly indicate that most of the sediment column is anoxic, with thin oxic zones at the top and bottom of the column (Fig. F36). Manganese is a prominent net electron acceptor throughout most of the column. Dissolved oxygen concentration decreases rapidly within the first meter below seafloor and is below detection by ${\sim}5$ mbsf. Below that depth, it is indistinguishable from zero until to a few meters above the sediment/basalt interface, when it rises to a few micro mols. Dissolved oxygen content generally matches sediment color, with dissolved oxygen present in the brown sediment at the top and bottom of the column but indistinguishable from zero throughout the gray sediment that characterized most of the column. Dissolved nitrate disappears within 2.5 mbsf but re-appears above the sediment/basalt interface, from 105 to 120 mbsf (the deepest sample analyzed for nitrate). Dissolved ammonium rises from $0.35\;\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at 0.15 mbsf to a maximum of ${\sim}55$ $\upmu\mathrm{M}$ between 30 and 65 mbsf and then decreases slightly to $40~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at 97 mbsf (no deeper samples were analyzed for ammonium). Dissolved manganese strongly increases to ${\sim}360\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ in the uppermost 3 mbsf, exhibits four broad maxima and three local minima within the column, and decreases to ${\sim}70~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at \~128 mbsf. Redox potential, measured by electrode, broadly mirrors the dissolved manganese profile, with positive potential at the top and bottom of the sediment column and generally negative (but sometimes low positive) potential throughout most of the column. Three minima in redox potential within the column correspond to the local minima in dissolved manganese concentration.  

Throughout the sediment column, concentrations of dissolved phosphate and DIC are much higher at Site U1371 than at equivalent sediment depths at the sites within the gyre (Sites U1365–U1370). Concentrations of these chemical species peak a few meters below seafloor.  

Shipboard studies of Site U1371 found at least four additional results of note. First, the presence of pyrite in the first $0{-}10\,\mathrm{m}$ of the sediment column suggests that sulfate and iron reduction have occurred in the near-seafloor zones of oxygen, nitrate, and manganese reduction. Second, the sulfate anomaly profile suggests that sulfate reduction and manganese reduction may broadly co-occur within the column. Third, dissolved oxygen and dissolved manganese appear to co-exist for at least $13\textrm{m}$ in the lowermost sediment column. Fourth, dissolved oxygen and dissolved hydrogen also appear to co-exist in the lowermost sediment column. Postcruise studies will test (1) the co-occurrence of sulfate reduction, iron reduction, and other redox processes in this sediment column and (2) explanations of the co-occurrence of dissolved oxygen, manganese, and hydrogen deep in the column.  

# Basalt  

The presence of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, and DIC in the lowermost sediment indicates that life is not inhibited in the upper basaltic basement by absence of electron acceptors, major nutrients, or carbon.  

Dissolved potassium concentration declines with depth in the sediment, indicating a sink for dissolved potassium in the underlying basaltic basement. This sink is inferred to be basalt alteration (clay formation).  

A wide range of microbiology experiments was initiated shipboard. Experiments on major microbial processes and cultivations of viable microbes were initiated with samples taken at selected depths ranging from near the sediment/water interface to the sediment/basalt interface. Subsamples were routinely taken from all of the distinct lithologic units for postcruise molecular assays and microbiological experiments.

White lines $=$ basement age in $10\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . increments. As illustrated by paleoposition histories of proposed Sites SPG-1 and SPG-12 (black lines), paleopositions determined with a fixed hotspot reference frame indicate that proposed Sites SPG-1– SPG-10 have been in the gyre for tens of millions of years and proposed Site SPG-12 has been at the gyre margin for tens of millions of years.

Subseafloor cell concentrations in shallow sediment at Expedition 329 sites (open circles $=$ data from Sites U1365–U1370, open triangles $=$ data from Site U1371, just outside the gyre) and at all previously counted ODP/IODP sites (solid circles) (D’Hondt et al., 2009). Site U1371 is the only Cruise KNOX-02RR site at which concentrations approach previous ODP/IODP values.

Figure F5. Model for relative rates of organic carbon (OC) oxidation and radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ oxidation with depth. Dotted pink line $=$ maximum depth below seafloor cored curing Cruise KNOX-02RR. Radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ may provide more than half of the electron donors at some proposed sites (D’Hondt et al., 2009). Because organic carbon is oxidized at highest rates in the youngest sediment, at some depth below seafloor (dashed blue line), microbial oxidation of radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ may exceed oxidation of buried organic carbon. At still greater depth (solid green line), reactive organic matter may be depleted and radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ may be the sole electron donor. These predictions can only be tested by drilling the entire sediment column.

Figure F6. Models of radiolytic $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations with depth. If $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is microbially oxidized, its concentration will be below our detection limit (pink line $=$ concentrations measured at Site U1370 during Cruise KNOX-02RR [below detection limit of $3.5~\times~10^{-8}~\mathrm{M}$ . Other lines indicate predicted concentrations if the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is not oxidized (e.g., if sediment is sterile), but radioactivity and porosity are constant throughout the sediment (blue line $=$ diffusive loss of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to both overlying ocean and underlying basement aquifer, red line $=$ diffusive loss to the overlying ocean but basement is impermeable to chemical exchange). The constancy of radioactivity and porosity with depth and the concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ at depth can only be tested by drilling to basement.

Heavy black line $=$ expected heat flow for conductive crust in the absence of advection. No Cruise Knox-02RR data are available for Sites U1370 or U1371 because of technical failure and thermistor loss. Proposed Sites SPG3, SPG6, and SPG9 were not drilled during Expedition 329.
