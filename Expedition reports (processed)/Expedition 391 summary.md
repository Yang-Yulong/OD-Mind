# Abstract  

Hotspot tracks (chains of seamounts, ridges, and other volcanic structures) provide important records of plate motions, as well as mantle geodynamics, magma flux, and mantle source compositions. The Tristan-Gough-Walvis Ridge (TGW) hotspot track, extending from the active volcanic islands of Tristan da Cunha and Gough through a province of guyots and then along Walvis Ridge to the Etendeka flood basalt province, forms one of the most prominent and complex global hotspot tracks. The TGW hotspot track displays a tight linear age progression in which ages increase from the islands to the flood basalts (covering ${\sim}135\,\mathrm{My}$ ). Unlike Pacific tracks, which are often simple, nearly linear chains of seamounts, the TGW track is alternately a steep-sided narrow ridge, an oceanic plateau, subparallel linear ridges and chains of seamounts (most are flat-topped guyots). The track displays isotopic zonation over the last ${\sim}70$ My. The zonation appears near the middle of the track just before it splits into two to three chains of ridge- and guyot-type seamounts. Walvis Ridge, forming the older part of the track, is also overprinted with age-progressive late-stage volcanism, which was emplaced ${\sim}30{-}40$ My after the initial eruptions and has a distinct isotopic composition. The plan for Expedition 391 was to drill at six sites, three along Walvis Ridge and three in the seamounts of the Guyot Province, to collect igneous rocks to better understand the formation of volcanic edifices, the temporal and geochemical evolution of the hotspot, and the variation in paleolatitudes at which the volcanic edifices formed.  

After a delay of 18 days to address a shipboard Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, Expedition 391 proceeded to drill at four of the proposed sites: three sites on Walvis Ridge around Valdivia Bank, an ocean plateau within the ridge, and one site on the lower flank of a guyot in the Center track of the Guyot Province, a ridge located between the Tristan subtrack (which extends from the end of Walvis Ridge to the islands of Tristan da Cunha) and the Gough subtrack (which extends from Walvis Ridge to Gough Island). The first hole was drilled at Site U1575, located on a low portion of the northeastern Walvis Ridge just north of Valdivia Bank. At this location, $209.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediments and $122.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement were cored. The sediments ranged in age from Late Pleistocene $({\sim}0.43{-}1.24\ \mathrm{Ma})$ to Late Cretaceous (Campanian; $72{-}78\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). The igneous basement comprised 10 submarine lava units consisting of pillow, lobate, sheet, and massive lava flows, the thickest of which was ${\sim}21\mathrm{~m~}$ . Most lavas are tholeiitic, but some alkalic basalts were recovered. A portion of the igneous succession consists of low-Ti basalts, which are unusual because they appear in the Etendeka flood basalts but have not been previously found on Walvis Ridge. Two holes were drilled at Site U1576 on the west flank of Valdivia Bank. The first of these holes was terminated because a bit jammed shortly after entering the igneous basement. Hole U1576A recovered a remarkable ${\sim}380~\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary section consisting mostly of chalk covering a nearly complete sequence from Late Pleistocene $({\sim}0.43{-}1.24\ \mathrm{Ma})$ to Late Cretaceous (Campanian; ${\sim}79-$  

$81.38\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). These sediments display short and long cyclic color changes that imply astronomicall y forced and longer term paleoenvironmental changes. The igneous basement recovered in Hol e U1576B yielded 11 submarine lava units (total thickness $=\sim\!-65\,\mathrm{m}$ ). The flows range from pillows t o massive flows with compositions varying from tholeiitic basalt to basaltic andesite, only the second occurrence of the latter composition recovered from the TGW track thus far. These units ar e separated by seven sedimentary chalk units that range $0.1{-}11.6\mathrm{~m~}$ in thickness, implying a longterm interplay of sedimentation and lava eruptions. These intercalated sediments revealed Uppe r Cretaceous (Campanian) ages of ${\sim}77{-}79\ \mathrm{Ma}$ for the upper two interbeds and ${\sim}79{-}81.38\ \mathrm{Ma}$ fo r the lower beds. Coring at Site U1577, on the extreme eastern flank of Valdivia Bank, penetrated  a $154.8~\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary section ranging from the Paleocene (Thanetian; ${\sim}58.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) to Uppe r Cretaceous (Campanian; ${\sim}81.43{-}83.20\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . Igneous basement coring progressed only $39.1\,\textrm{m}$ below the sediment/basalt contact, recovering three massive submarine tholeiitic basalt lava flow s that are 4.1, 15.5, and ${>}19.1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, respectively. Paleomagnetic data from Sites U1577 and U157 6 indicate that the former volcanic basement formed just before the end of the Cretaceous Norma l Superchron and the latter during Chron $33\mathrm{r},$ shortly afterward. Biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data suggest that Valdivia Bank becomes younger from east to west. Site U1578, locate d on a Center track guyot, provided a long and varied igneous section. After coring through $184.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of pelagic carbonate sediments mainly consisting of Eocene and Paleocene chalk $(\sim\!55.64\!-\!63.5$ Ma), Hole U1578A cored $302.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. Basement lavas are largely pillows but ar e interspersed with sheet and massive flows. Lava compositions are mostly alkalic basalts with som e hawaiite. Several intervals contain abundant olivine (some fresh), and some of the pillow stack s consist of basalt with remarkably high Ti content. The igneous sequence is interrupted by 10 sedimentary interbeds consisting of chalk and volcaniclastics and ranging $0.46{-}10.19\ \mathrm{m}$ in thickness. Investigations of toothpick samples from the intercalated sediments were examined, each revealing the same age range of ${\sim}63.5{-}64.81\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (lower Paleocene; Danian). Paleomagnetic data displa y a change in basement magnetic polarity ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ above the base of the hole. Combining magneti c stratigraphy with biostratigraphic data, the igneous section is inferred to span $^{>1}$ My.  

Nearly 7 months after Expedition 391, JOIDES Resolution transited from Cape Town to the nort h Atlantic. During this transit (Expedition 397T), 7.9 days of ship time were used to drill two hole s (U1584A and U1585A) at sites on the Gough and Tristan tracks that had been omitted because o f COVID-19–related time loss on the earlier cruise. For both, coring was begun only a short distance above the igneous basement to save time. The $75.2~\mathrm{m}$ thick section drilled in Hole U1584 A contains two sedimentary units: clay-rich carbonate sediments overlie a pumice-dominated volcaniclastic deposit containing basalt fragments. Because the goal was to core basalt and the base o f the volcaniclastic deposit was not imaged in the seismic profile, the hole was terminated early t o save operation time for the next site. In Hole U1585A, coring penetrated a $273.5\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimen t section overlying an $81.2\;\mathrm{m}$ thick pile of massive basalt flows. The sediment section is divided int o four units:  

• The uppermost unit consists of nannofossil chalk;   
• The two intermediate units contain alternating chalk and volcaniclastic sediments containing several breccia units; and   
• The lowermost unit consists of volcanic breccia containing juvenile blocks, bombs, and accretionary lapilli.  

This thick sedimentary section documents a transition from shallow-water volcanism to openocean sedimentation as the seamount subsided. The thick underlying basalt section is made up o f four sparsely to highly phyric massive flows, the thickest of which is ${>}43\;\mathrm{m}$ thick. Samples of thes e units are mostly basalt with a few trachybasalts and one trachyandesite.  

Although the igneous penetration was less than planned, coring during Expeditions 391 and 397 T obtained samples that clearly will lead to an improved understanding of the evolution of the TG W hotspot and its track. Reasonable recovery of fresh basalt in some holes provides ample sample s for geochemical, geochronologic, and paleomagnetic studies. Good recovery of Late Cretaceou s and early Cenozoic chalk successions provides samples for paleoenvironmental study.  

# 1. Introduction  

At ${\sim}3100\ \mathrm{km}$ in length, the Tristan-Gough-Walvis Ridge (TGW) volcanic chain is one of Earth’ s longest quasi-linear, intraplate features on the seafloor. It was one of the first proposed to hav e been formed by a hotspot (Wilson, 1963), which Morgan (1971) proposed was a mantle plume,  a melting anomaly at the top of a narrow, buoyant, columnar upwelling of higher temperature mantle material. Unlike the Hawaiian-Emperor and Louisville Seamount chains in the Pacific, whic h are mostly simple chains of individual volcanic seamounts and considered archetypal plume trail s (Clague and Dalrymple, 1989; Koppers et al., 2004), the TGW chain is highly complex in its morphology, isotope geochemistry, and history.  

Morphologically, the TGW chain includes a continuous ridge (Frio Ridge) with a straight side an d top corrugated with faults, an oceanic plateau (Valdivia Bank), elongated ridges subparallel to th e overall ridge trend, chains of guyots, and scattered seamounts (Figure F1). The post–60 Ma volcanism (referred to as the Guyot Province) can be divided into two distinct tracks of seamounts, on e extending from the end of Walvis Ridge to Tristan Island (the Tristan track) and the other fro m Walvis Ridge to Gough Island (the Gough track). These two chains are characterized by distinc t Pb isotopic compositions, but both have enriched mantle one (EMI)-type geochemistry (Rohde e t al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015). This represents the longest-lived hotspot zonation recognize d thus far. A ridge and seamounts on the boundary of the Tristan and Gough subtracks have bee n considered as a separate Center track by some, but it is not clear whether its isotopic signatur e represents mixing of the Tristan and Gough end-members or constitutes a third distinct geochemical composition. The older Walvis Ridge (pre– $-70\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) has a Gough-type EMI isotopic composition. Younger guyot-type seamounts with a different high $\upmu$ (HIMU)-type composition (hig h time-integrated U/Pb ratio resulting in radiogenic $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Pb}}$ isotope ratios) overlie the flat-topped an d faulted Walvis Ridge basement. Both the EMI-type TGW chain and the HIMU seamounts continuing into Africa display remarkably linear age progressions, offset by 30–40 My, which ar e interpreted as reflecting two distinct plumes derived from distinct portions of the large low-shea r velocity province (LLSVP) at the base of the lower mantle (Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019, 2020). Moreover, the Valdivia Bank Plateau of Walvis Ridge apparently formed on the boundary of  a microplate, which may have affected its development along with that of its conjugate, the Ri o Grande Rise on the South American plate (Sager et al., 2021).

The TGW chain is also an important geodynamic indicator. It is nearly antipodal to the HawaiianEmperor chain, which has been the fodder for debates about the fidelity of seamount chains t o define plate motions relative to the underlying mantle. Two phenomena that can cause hotspo t motion are mantle flow and true polar wander (TPW; the shift of the spin axis relative to th e Earth’s mantle). Because the two hotspots are nearly antipolar, if there was significant TPW durin g the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, the effect should be a coherent shift with Pacific and Atlanti c hotspots (nominally, in the opposite direction from Hawaii). If other phenomena, such as plum e motion, are the cause of TGW chain paleolatitude shifts, they are predicted to be in the sam e direction as Hawaii (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Moreover, the TGW track is the longest and mos t continuous on the African plate, so it plays an outsized role in determining the absolute motion o f that plate. Thus, a better definition of the TGW chain age progression and paleolatitude is important for refining absolute plate motion models.  

Owing to its complex nature, the TGW track can give important insights into (1) the interaction o f mantle plume(s) with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, (2) plume geochemical zonation, (3) complication s (e.g., morphological and geochemical) related to a second hotspot event superimposed onto th e first, (4) microplate formation, (5) plume movement, and (6) TPW. Expeditions 391 and 397 T sought to explore these complexities by coring at six locations, three in the Guyot Province an d three on Valdivia Bank (Figure F1).  

The original plan for Expedition 391 included drilling at six sites, three on the older Walvis Ridg e near Valdivia Bank and three in the Guyot Province just southeast of the split into two or thre e separate tracks. Unfortunately, Expedition 391 began in Cape Town, South Africa, during a spik e in the COVID-19 pandemic, and an outbreak occurred on board. This required a return to Cap e Town and a wait at the dock until the virus was eliminated from the ship. Eventually, this wa s achieved but at a loss of almost one-third of the allotted ship time. A pared-down plan was conceived to visit four of the six sites (Figure F1) with reduced time for deep penetration. The focu s was to core the three sites on Valdivia Bank to gain an understanding and timing of the formatio n of that edifice and to core the Center track in the Guyot Province because it would be central t o addressing geochemical zonation and paleolatitude questions. Later, during Expedition 397T,  a transit from Cape Town to Lisbon, an opportunity arose to regain some of the lost drilling time. The two omitted sites in the Guyot Province were cored, penetrating to basaltic crust in one.  

Drilling during Expedition 391 cored total sedimentary (Figure F2) and igneous (Figure F3) thicknesses of $949.6\;\mathrm{m}$ and $546.9\;\mathrm{m}$ , respectively. Expedition 397T added coring of $348.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t and $81.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous rock, making two expedition totals of $1298.3\,\mathrm{m}$ and $628.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . Drilling at Sit e U1575 on the northern Valdivia Bank penetrated $209.9\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment and sedimentary rock an d $122.4~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous material comprising 10 units for $332.3\;\mathrm{m}$ total depth. Drilling at Sites U157 6 and U1577 penetrated the west and east flanks of Valdivia Bank. Two holes at U1576 traverse d 380.2 and $385.4\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment and 17.9 and $64.9~\mathrm{m}$ of basalt flows intercalated with sediment, totaling 398.1 and $450.3\mathrm{~m~}$ of total depth, respectively. The basement succession consists of 1 2 igneous units and 7 sedimentary interbeds. Site U1577 penetrated $154.8\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and $39.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of massive basalt flows, totaling $193.9\;\mathrm{m}$ . Site U1578, situated on the distal flank of a guyot, core d $184.3~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and $302.1\textrm{m}$ of intercalated lava flows and sediment, ending at 486.4 mbsf. The igneous section at this site contains 12 volcanic units interspersed with 10 sedimentary interbeds. Coring at Site U1584 traversed $75.2~\mathrm{m}$ of clay- and volcaniclastic-rich carbonate sediment s lying atop pumice-dominated volcaniclastics. At Site U1585, a $273.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sedimentary section range s from volcanic breccias to carbonate ooze. Beneath is an $81.2\;\mathrm{m}$ section with massive basalt flows.

# 2. Background  

Most of the background information included here comes from the proposal that was accepted fo r Expedition 391 and related proposals and papers by the proposal authors. It is included here as  a detailed justification and rationale for Expedition 391.  

# 2.1. Hotspot models and geodynamics  

Early concepts of hotspots were compelling because they seemed to fit nicely with the new paradigm of plate tectonics. Hotspots were explained as a melting anomaly beneath the lithospheri c plates (Wilson, 1963) above a narrow thermal plume arising from the deep mantle (Morgan, 1971, 1972). Eventually, hotspot volcanic chains were widely used as a mantle reference frame (Morgan, 1971, 1972, 1981; Duncan, 1981; Duncan and Clague, 1985; Müller et al., 1993) because the volcanic sources seemed to be fixed within the mantle and thus volcanic chains were interpreted as a n indication of absolute plate motion. This view lost favor as studies discovered problems with absolute plate motion models. Some studies showed discrepancies between the Pacific and IndoAtlantic hotspot reference frames (Stock and Molnar, 1987; Cande et al., 1995; Raymond et al., 2000). Other studies questioned the fixed hotspot hypothesis because numerical models implie d perturbations by mantle flow (Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998, 2000; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger et al., 2004). Paleolatitude data showed significant latitudinal motion of the Hawaiia n hotspot (Tarduno and Cottrell, 1997; Tarduno et al., 2003) in contrast with limited motion for th e Louisville hotspot (Koppers et al., 2012). Simultaneously, other authors questioned the plum e model and the role of plumes in mantle convection (Foulger, 2005, 2007). The result was a shift o f consensus from fixed to mobile hotspots. With renewed scrutiny, researchers have found th e plume and hotspot hypotheses to be more complicated than was first thought. Although man y researchers accept the plume hypothesis, the number, composition, sources, mobility, structure, and geodynamic implications are still debated (e.g., Courtillot et al., 2003; Anderson, 2005; Montelli et al., 2006; Foulger, 2007; Farnetani and Samuel, 2005; French and Romanowicz, 2015; Koppers et al., 2021; Liu and Leng, 2020).  

Hotspot volcanic chains are most clearly expressed in the oceans as quasilinear seamount chains, but most are poorly sampled and studied, leaving room for uncertainty and speculation. Th e Hawaiian-Emperor chain is the archetypal hotspot track. Its apparent age progression is relativel y simple (Clague and Dalrymple, 1989) and inspired Wilson (1963) to propose the hotspot hypothesis, followed by the mantle plume hypothesis (Morgan, 1971). Many Pacific seamount chains display a “string of pearls” morphology with largely individual volcanic seamounts, most of which ar e characterized by relatively flat tops (guyots), in a line recording the motion of the plate relative t o the hotspot (e.g., Clague and Dalrymple, 1989; Koppers et al., 2011). This idea is widely accepte d and applied to other linear seamount chains. In contrast to many Pacific seamount tracks, Atlanti c seamount chains are diffuse and sometimes imply different rates of motion (e.g., O’Connor et al., 1999). Some chains, such as Ninetyeast Ridge and Walvis Ridge, have complex morphologies, containing quasiconical and ridge-like structures, plateaus, multiple tracks, and large offsets, whic h indicates that their shapes are partly a result of interactions with plate boundaries (e.g., Expeditio n 324 Scientists, 2010; Sager, 2021; Krishna et al., 2012; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b; Hoernl e et al., 2016). In addition, there is evidence that large igneous provinces (LIPs) and mid-ocea n ridges can interact over tens of millions of years (Krishna et al., 2012; Sager et al., 2016, 2019, 2021), suggesting that plume and mid-ocean ridge convection may be linked (Whittaker et al., 2015).  

# 2.2. Geologic setting  

The TGW chain, located in the South Atlantic (Figure F1), is one of the most geodynamicall y complex and significant hotspot tracks. It was one of the first proposed plume tracks (Morgan, 1971, 1972) and is considered to have formed by age-progressive volcanism like Hawaii (O’Conno r and Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b; Homrighausen et al., 2019). It is one of only three hotspot tracks that connect a continenta l flood basalt province to active volcanoes (Richards et al., 1989). It is also considered one of onl y seven primary (probably from the lower mantle) plumes (Courtillot et al., 2003). Furthermore, it i s one of several South Atlantic hotspots tied to the edge of the African LLSVP at the base of th e lower mantle, a possible plume generation zone (Torsvik et al., 2006; O’Connor et al., 2012; Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019, 2020). Because of its prominence and ${\sim}120$ My duration (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b; Homrighausen et al., 2019), Walvi s Ridge is a keystone in the Indo-Atlantic hotspot absolute motion reference frame (e.g., Duncan, 1981; Müller et al., 1993; Doubrovine et al., 2012), but with its geologic complexities and th e uncertainty of plumes as fixed mantle markers, the geodynamic implications of the TGW track ar e unclear. Indeed, some authors posit that the TGW chain was formed by nonhotspot-related volcanism along shear zones and structural weaknesses (Fairhead and Wilson, 2005; Foulger, 2007, 2018). Although many researchers think there is strong evidence that Walvis Ridge was formed b y a mantle plume, its complexity contrasts with the simple Hawaiian-Emperor chain. The TG W chain forms a narrow ridge near the continent after a sharp bend forms a plateau (Valdivia Bank ) and then splits into two or three seamount chains farther southwest until it reaches a width of 40 0 km between the active volcanic island groups of Tristan da Cunha and Gough. This region of guyots and ridge-type seamounts is known as the Guyot Province. The two outer seamount tracks en d in the active volcanic islands (Figure F1). It may be that the TGW track is an example of a differen t type of mantle plume, emplaced near a ridge during its early history and from more diffuse o r multiple upwellings (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2012; Anderson and Natland, 2014; Rohde et al., 2013b; Liu and Leng, 2020). The TGW track also represents the longest known $({\sim}70\,\,\mathrm{My})$ geochemicall y zoned hotspot, and the onset of zonation occurs just before the morphologic split (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Class et al., 2015). Moreover, the Valdivia Bank section of Walvis Ridg e displays age-progressive secondary volcanism with a distinct isotopic composition (HIMU, or hig h time-integrated $\mathrm{^{238}U/^{204}P b}$ type) that lags the original volcanism by ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{My},$ , implying a secondar y plume (Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019, 2020). For these reasons, knowledge of the TGW trac k history is important for understanding hotspot geodynamics and volcanism.  

# 2.2.1. Evolution of Walvis Ridge: Rio Grande Rise hotspot twins  

Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise (Figure F4) are considered examples of LIPs formed from  a mantle plume located beneath a spreading ridge (Morgan, 1981; O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; Whittaker et al., 2015). While the plume was beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during the Late Cretaceous, eruptions occurred on both the South American and African plates, forming Rio Grand e Rise and Walvis Ridge (O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; Rohde et al., 2013b). Although the TG W chain appears as a quasilinear ridge and seamount chain, LIP eruptions formed two oceanic plateaus, Valdivia Bank $(400\,\mathrm{km}\times550\,\mathrm{km})$ and Rio Grande Rise Massif $(500\,\mathrm{km}\times950\,\mathrm{km})$ , at ${\sim}80-$ $90\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Rohde et al., 2013b; Homrighausen et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). The hotspot and th e Mid-Atlantic Ridge separated at ${\sim}65\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and the hotspot erupted on the African plate thereafter. Consequently, volcanism ceased on the South American plate, whereas linear seamount chain s extended southwest from Walvis Ridge. Since these pioneering studies, authors have tried to fi t the TGW chain with hotspot models that have a monotonic age progression (Figure F5) (Duncan, 1981; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Müller et al., 1993; Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012). Such simple hotspot models do a poor job of fitting the complex Walvis Ridge morphology. In response, authors have resorted to models with multiple hotspots (O’Connor and le Roex, 1992), moving hotspots (Doubrovine et al., 2012), hotspot-ridge interaction (O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b), and/or distinct plumelets beneath the Tristan and Gough subtracks (Rohde et al., 2013b )

to explain TGW track morphologic changes, but no hotspot model is entirely satisfactory. Mor e recent studies, however, show that the TGW chain forms a very good age progression whe n younger volcanism with a distinct HIMU-type composition is considered separately from th e EMI-type basement (Figure F6) (Homrighausen et al., 2019). A seismic tomographic study show s a narrow plume conduit ( ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{km}$ in diameter) extending to a depth of ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{km}$ beneath a poin t just southwest of the Tristan volcanic island complex (Schlömer et al., 2017). The study did not, however, include the area beneath Gough Island, so this picture is incomplete.

A further problem with the simple plume hypothesis for the older $\mathrm{(pre-70~Ma)}$ portion of th e hotspot track is the dramatically different morphologies of Rio Grande Rise and the TGW chain. Rio Grande Rise contains two subrounded plateaus and a north–south ridge oriented parallel t o the paleo–Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis, whereas Walvis Ridge is a curved linear feature whose morphology changes along its length (Figures F1, F4). Both the Rio Grande Rise Massif and the southeastern Rio Grande Rise are split by the prominent northwest–southeast oriented Cruzeiro do Su l rift. The current explanation for these troughs is a failed Eocene rifting event (Camboa and Rabinowitz, 1984; Mohriak et al., 2010), which occurred in a midplate setting and has no clear tectoni c cause. A similar rift has been observed at Valdivia Bank (Jiménez García, 2017; Sager et al., 2021; Contreras et al., 2022), but its origin is still unknown. Notably, similar rifts are observed at othe r LIPs, such as the Manihiki Plateau (Danger Island and Suvorov Troughs) (Nakanishi et al., 2015; Pietsch and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2016). In contrast, the TGW chain changes morphology alon g its length from ridge to plateau to elongated ridges leading to several seamount trails. O’Conno r and Jokat (2015a) explained the morphology changes along Walvis Ridge by the interaction of th e TGW plume and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and proposed that the seamounts on the ridge represented the best estimate of the actual TGW hotspot track. Homrighausen et al. (2018, 2019, 2020), however, showed that seamounts atop the original TGW chain form a secondary hotspot trac k ${\sim}30{-}40\ \mathrm{Ma}$ younger than the original TGW edifices. They also point out that extensional faultin g appears to postdate substantial erosion of the originally subaerial Walvis Ridge, which places it s relationship to TGW plume-ridge interaction into question. After the Mid-Atlantic Ridge drifte d away from the TGW hotspot, individual seamount chains of the Guyot Province formed as th e plume and Mid-Atlantic Ridge drifted apart (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b).  

When all recently published radiometric ages for Walvis Ridge are considered, they show a wid e range of ages (up to $50\;\mathrm{My}.$ ) at a single location and only display a crude progression of ages tha t becomes older toward Namibia for much of the Late Cretaceous (Figure F6) (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b; Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019). Nevertheless, Homrighausen et al. (2018, 2019, 2020) showed that TGW chain volcanism forms two distinct geochemical types. Th e basement, which has undergone extensive erosion and faulting, has an EMI-type compositio n characterized by unradiogenic $\mathrm{^{206}P b/^{204}P b}$ isotope ratios. In contrast, the younger seamounts o n the EMI basement have a HIMU-type composition characterized by radiogenic $\mathrm{^{206}P b/^{204}P b}$ isotop e ratios. When only the EMI basement volcanics are considered, they show a tight age progressio n (Figure F6) (Homrighausen et al., 2019). The HIMU seamount volcanism shows a similar age progression but is offset by 30–40 My at a given location from the EMI basement lavas (Figure F6). The HIMU-type seamounts have been interpreted to reflect the passage of Walvis Ridge over  a secondary hotspot ${\sim}30{-}40$ My after formation of the Walvis Ridge EMI basement. It has bee n proposed that the EMI TGW hotspot was derived from the outer margin of the LLSVP, and th e secondary HIMU hotspot was derived from an internal step in the LLSVP (Homrighausen et al., 2020). Reconstructions (Figure F7) imply that the main edifices of Rio Grande Rise and Valdivi a Bank formed together at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between ${\sim}80$ and $90\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Few radiometric date s are available from Rio Grande Rise. Tholeiitic basalt samples from Deep Sea Drilling Projec t (DSDP) Site 516 produced radiometric ages of $80{-}86\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , and a dredged alkali basalt from th e edge of the Cruzeiro do Sul rift yielded an age of $46\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a). Several authors recognized secondary volcanism in seismic lines and attributed it to  a regional tectonic event of unknown cause (Camboa and Rabinowitz, 1984; Mohriak et al., 2010). Although age data thus far define an excellent age progression for Walvis Ridge, the scant age dat a from Rio Grande Rise and its complexity do not allow us to properly assess whether this volcanis m is also age progressive in the direction of plate motion.  

# 2.2.2. Did Rio Grande Rise Massif and Valdivia Bank form at a microplate?  

Results from a recent study of Rio Grande Rise–Walvis Ridge tectonics based on tectonic fabric i n satellite gravity and magnetic data (Sager et al., 2015, 2021; Thoram et al., 2019) reveal tectoni c anomalies associated with the formation of the two LIPs. Seafloor fabric (orthogonal fractur e zones and ridge fault blocks) is quite regular in most of the South Atlantic, except for the are a between Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge and magnetic Chron 34 ( $83.7\,\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; anomaly ages fro m Ogg, 2020) and Chron 30 $.66.3\,\mathrm{Ma})$ . The prominent magnetic anomaly of Chron 33r appears to o early in reconstructions of Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise, implying extra (older) materia l between the two. Coupled with discordant seafloor fabric, it is postulated that a microplate existe d between Rio Grande Rise and Valdivia Bank during the Late Cretaceous (Figure F8) (Thoram e t al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). Given reconstructions showing a ring of igneous constructs aroun d the proposed microplate, it is possible that microplate formation affected volcanism in both provinces. The cause is thought to be a reorganization of a long-offset fracture zone during the Lat e Cretaceous. First located north of Frio Ridge in the northeastern Walvis Ridge, the fracture zon e broke apart between approximately 92 and $68\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and reformed as multiple fracture zones farthe r south (Sager et al., 2021).  

The microplate hypothesis potentially changes the way we interpret the TGW chain and Ri o Grande Rise during their most effusive phase. Rather than developing with a simple age progression, volcanism may have occurred in multiple places simultaneously: for example, at plate boundaries along the rim of the microplate or along the middle TGW chain where fracture zones create d elongated ridges at about the time of the Chron C34 to C30 reorganization. Microplates ofte n rotate (e.g., Schouten et al., 1993; Bird et al., 1998), which could cause misleading tectonic trend s for hotspot models. In many other settings, ridge reorganizations, microplates, triple junctions, and LIPs occur together (Tamaki and Larson, 1988; Sager et al., 1999; Sager, 2005; Taylor, 2006; Chandler et al., 2012), implying possible linkages among these processes.

Figure F7. Bathymetry reconstruction of Rio Grande Rise and Valdivia Bank at 88, 83, and 78 Ma. At 88 Ma, the main Rio Grande Rise and Valdivia Bank formed at th e Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Around $83\;{\mathsf{M a}}_{}$ , Rio Grande Rise, Valdivia Bank, and part of East Rio Grande Rise formed a volcanic ring surrounding a small basin that may hav e contained a microplate (Thoram et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). White line $=$ location of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge inferred from existing age models (Müller et al., 2008). This reconstruction shows bathymetry by crustal age, so features that postdate crustal formation appear too early. For this reason, guyots younger than the seafloo r are masked.

# 2.2.3. Paleolatitude and hotspot motion  

Paleomagnetic polar wander is chiefly ascribed to plate motion (e.g., Butler, 1992). Less recognized are contributions from the movement of the spin axis relative to the entire Earth (i.e., TPW ) (Gold, 1955; Goldreich and Toomre, 1969) and time-varying nondipole geomagnetic field components (Coupland and Van der Voo, 1980; Livermore et al., 1984; McElhinny et al., 1996). Althoug h nondipole fields are generally believed to be small $(\varsigma10\%$ of dipole) (Livermore et al., 1984; McElhinny et al., 1996), TPW can be much larger. The maximum principle axis of inertia ma y even suddenly shift ${\sim}90^{\circ}$ (inertial interchange TPW), causing the spin axis to follow (Kirschvink e t al., 1997). Smaller spin axis shifts and oscillations probably also occur, controlled by convectiv e currents and the viscoelastic relaxation time of the lithosphere and mantle (Creveling et al., 2012; Mitchell et al., 2021).  

The difficulty with inferring TPW is that it is hard to define because it requires paleomagneti c data to be compared with an independent geographic reference frame. The hotspot referenc e frame was widely used as a basis to separate plate motions from TPW; the standard procedure wa s to subtract plate motion relative to the hotspots (mantle reference frame) from paleomagneti c polar wander (Gordon, 1987; Besse and Courtillot, 2002). The remaining polar drift was interpreted as TPW. When hotspots were considered fixed relative to the mantle, this comparison wa s simple. Recent research suggesting that hotspots may move relative to one another and to th e mantle owing to convection (Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger e t al., 2004) makes the definition of a hotspot reference frame uncertain. Several studies have tried t o revive the hotspot reference frame by computing an average hotspot reference frame that minimizes interhotspot drift (O’Neill et al., 2005; Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012).  

Even with allowance for moving hotspots, differences occur between the average hotspot reference frame and paleomagnetic polar wander, implying TPW (Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine e t al., 2012; Koivisto et al., 2014). Furthermore, these moving hotspot models produce inconsistencies with other kinematic observations related to past ridge-axis positions (Wessel and Müller, 2016) and regional plate motion reorganizations (Seton et al., 2015). A robust mantle referenc e frame is needed to investigate and understand global surface tectonics and mantle geodynamics. To build such a reference frame, the size, direction, and timing of uniform hotspot drift (caused b y TPW) must be firmly established. This requires better understanding of the paleomagneti c records from hotspots.  

# 2.2.4. Paleolatitudes from scientific drilling in the Pacific  

DSDP and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) samples from the Emperor Seamounts show an offse t from the current hotspot latitude of $\mathrm{\sim}14^{\circ}$ to $15^{\circ}$ for the oldest edifices (Kono, 1980; Tarduno an d Cottrell, 1997; Tarduno et al., 2003). At first, the offset was attributed to TPW (Gordon and Cape, 1981; Gordon, 1982). However, discrepancies and misfits with the hotspot reference frame (e.g., Stock and Molnar, 1987; Cande et al., 1995; Raymond et al., 2000) and models of mantle flow (e.g., Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998, 2000; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger et al., 2004) favored the ide a that hotspots are not fixed in the mantle (Steinberger et al., 2004; Tarduno et al., 2009). Paleomagnetic data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 330 to the Louisville Seamount s showed little motion of the Louisville hotspot in contrast to the large change for the contemporaneous Hawaiian hotspot, implying interhotspot motion consistent with mantle flow models (Koppers et al., 2012). Recently, however, Gordon and others suggested that interpretations of hotspo t motion are overblown and that part of the Hawaiian hotspot paleolatitude change resulted from  a Cenozoic episode of TPW (Woodworth and Gordon, 2018; Zheng et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019).  

# 2.2.5. Hotspot motion versus true polar wander  

Although varying degrees of interhotspot motion are widely accepted, TPW cannot be dismissed. It has a robust theoretical underpinning (Gold, 1955; Goldreich and Toomre, 1969; Gordon, 1987; Creveling et al., 2012) and is supported by independent evidence of shifts in paleolatitud e (Kirschvink et al., 1997; Prévot et al., 2000; Doubrovine et al., 2012). The debate about the role o f TPW in hotspot latitude shifts continues because of difficulties in defining an absolute referenc e frame and sparse paleomagnetic data sets. Recent moving hotspot absolute plate motion model s show promise in sorting out these phenomena (O’Neill et al., 2005; Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012), but the uncertainties of such models are large because of combined uncertainties of plate motion and mantle flow, especially for times earlier than the Cenozoic, whe n mantle flow model uncertainties become large (Steinberger, 2000). As noted by Doubrovine et al. (2012), “substantial amounts of TPW at rates varying between ${\sim}0.1^{\circ}/\mathrm{Ma}$ and $1^{\circ}/\mathrm{Ma}^{\prime\prime}$ occur in thei r global moving hotspot model. In fact, TPW is the dominant part of motion between the paleomagnetic axis and hotspots in that model. Thus, it is important to determine the paleolatitud e history of primary hotspots for constraints on hotspot motion and TPW. Even when significan t paleomagnetic data exist for the same plate (as is the case for Africa), data from the hotspot trac k itself are critical for deciphering the different processes that contribute to its latitude history.  

# 2.2.6. Paleolatitude changes for the Tristan-Gough-Walvis hotspot  

There are few paleomagnetic data from the TGW chain, so we must look to continental paleomagnetic data. Such data imply significant paleolatitude changes for the TGW chain over the pas t 120 My (Figure F9) (Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012). Between the mid-Cretaceou s and early Cenozoic, there was a rapid southward paleolatitude shift, totaling $\mathrm{\sim}18^{\circ}{-}20^{\circ}$ , from ${\sim}10^{\circ}-$ $12^{\circ}$ north to ${\sim}5^{\circ}{-}7^{\circ}$ south of the current hotspot latitude. This was followed by slow drift northward to the current latitude. These trends are unexpected because they are not predicted b y hotspot models. The total ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ of northward motion implied by Walvis Ridge (Figure F9) can b e explained by the ${\sim}7^{\circ}$ southward motion of the hotspot and the ${\sim}13^{\circ}$ northward motion of th e African plate relative to the mantle (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Although this is one model, othe r moving-hotspot models give similar results (O’Neill et al., 2005; Torsvik et al., 2008), and no mantle flow models predict northward motion of the hotspot as implied by Cenozoic paleomagneti c data. The difference between the absolute plate motion model and observed paleomagnetic data i s interpreted as TPW (Doubrovine et al., 2012), which may account for both the rapid southwar d shift during the Cretaceous and the northward Cenozoic shift (Figure F9).  

The Cenozoic paleolatitude trend is similar to that expected for TPW rotation that causes a southward paleolatitude shift for the Hawaiian hotspot (as observed) and a northward shift for th e TGW chain hotspot. It is true that the amplitude and timing of the shift appear different in the tw o oceans, but a contributing factor could be averaging: the paleolatitude curve in Figure F9 is a 2 0 My running average that smooths and potentially shifts paleolatitude changes, whereas paleolatitude data from Pacific hotspots cover short time intervals. Coring on the TGW track shoul d show a large paleolatitude change $(\mathrm{\sim}10^{\circ})$ from the oldest Cretaceous site to the early Cenozoi c sites. Moreover, the Cenozoic sites should show a significant departure $\langle{\sim}5^{\circ}$ or 6°) from the present latitude. Given that well-averaged paleolatitudes from coring have uncertainties of ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ , th e predicted paleolatitude shifts are within the resolution of coring studies (Tarduno et al., 2003; Koppers et al., 2012). It is difficult to know beforehand the ages of the planned drill sites. According to a fixed hotspot model (Figure F5) (Torsvik et al., 2008), the guyot sites range ${\sim}45\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Sit e U1578) to $56\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (proposed primary Sites TT-4A and GT-4A) and the Valdivia Bank sites rang e ${\sim}80{-}85\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ (Sites U1576 and U1577) to $95\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Site U1575). A moving hotspot model (Doubrovine et al., 2012) predicts an age of ${\sim}55\ \mathrm{Ma}$ for Site U1578 and ${\sim}64\ \mathrm{Ma}$ for proposed primar y Sites TT-4A and GT-4A but shows a greater age span along the axis of Valdivia Bank, from ${\sim}85$ M a for Sites U1576 and U1577 and ${\sim}110\ \mathrm{Ma}$ for Site U1575. Reliable radiometric ages are sparse, bu t Homrighausen et al. (2019) gave an age of $59\,\mathrm{Ma}$ for the southern end of the ridge upon which Sit e U1578 is located, as well as oldest ages of $81{-}84\ \mathrm{Ma}$ on the southern Valdivia Bank (Sites U157 6 and U1577) and $\mathord{\sim}109$ Ma on the northwestern scarp of Frio Ridge (Figure F6).  

# 2.3. Geochemical setting  

# 2.3.1. Geochemistry and isotopic zonation  

Increasingly, spatial geochemical zonation, present as subparallel geographically and geochemically distinct domains, is observed along hotspot tracks, including Hawaii, Galápagos, Samoa, Marquesas, Discovery, and TGW (e.g., Hoernle et al. 2000; Werner et al., 2003; Abouchami et al., 2005; Weis et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Schwindrofsk a et al., 2016; Harrison et al. 2017; Homrighausen et al., 2019). The TGW hotspot track, whic h includes Walvis Ridge, Guyot Province, and active island groups around Tristan da Cunha an d Gough Islands, has been recognized as the longest lived zoned hotspot system, displaying ${\sim}70$ M y of zonation (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2019), compared t o possibly 6.5 My for Hawaii (Harrison et al., 2017) and ${\sim}20$ My for Galápagos (Hoernle et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003). Between ${\sim}115$ and $70\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and ${\sim}85$ and $6.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , the enriched Gough and mor e depleted Kea components dominated the composition of the TGW and Hawaiian hotspot track, respectively (Portnyagin et al., 2008; Hoernle et al., 2015; Harrison et al., 2017; Homrighausen e t al., 2019). Modeling suggests that a zoned hotspot track reflects bilateral zonation of and lamina r flow within the plume stem, thus preserving evidence for distinct chemical reservoirs in the sourc e region (e.g., Kerr and Mériaux, 2004; Lohmann et al., 2009; Farnetani and Samuel, 2005; Farnetan i et al., 2012). Although most zoned hotspot tracks identified thus far consist of dual distinct chemical domains oriented parallel to the hotspot track, Hoernle et al. (2000) showed that the Galápagos hotspot track displays trilateral zonation and argued for trilateral zonation of the plume bu t noted that the central geochemical stripe may result from mixing of material from the outer tw o stripes. Modeling showed that such zonation is possible if the plume samples three distinct geochemical reservoirs at its base (Lohmann et al., 2009). New isotope data from Guyot Provinc e dredge samples (Class et al., 2014, 2015; Sager et al., 2020) identified a possible third, intermediat e zone in 3-D Pb isotopic space (Figures F10, F11), suggesting that the Tristan-Gough hotspot trac k may be formed by a long-lived, triple-zoned plume. If confirmed by drilling that the triple zonatio n does not result simply from mixing of the Tristan and Gough domains at their boundary, it woul d place tight constraints on the possible spatial distribution of components in the plume sourc e (Lohmann et al., 2009). Geochemical zonation has not been found in the older TGW chain (Figur e F11), leading Hoernle et al. (2015) to suggest that at ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{Ma}$ the plume source area either began t o suck in Tristan-type material from outside the LLSVP margin, due to having exhausted Goug h material near the boundary, or the base of the plume moved so that it straddled the boundar y between the LLSVP and surrounding ambient mantle. Plume zonation places important constraints on plume dynamics and heterogeneity of the lower mantle at the LLSVP boundaries.

Pink square $=$ paleolatitude determined for 60–75 Ma sediments (sed) from Site 525 (Chave, 1984). Its departure from the paleolatitude curve may be a result of inclination shallowing that is common for sediments (Verosub, 1977). Black triangle (NPB), open square (CPB), and purple diamond (SPB) $=$ paleolatitudes from the north, central, and sout h Paraná flood basalts, respectively (Ernesto et al., 1990, 1999).

Blue band $\left({\mathsf{V K}}92\right)=$ hotspot drift estimated by Van Fossen and Kent (1992). Blu e arrows $=$ estimated ages of proposed drill sites from an age progression model (Homrighausen et al., 2019, 2020). Top: northward drift and TPW. Red line $=$ paleolatitudes estimated from paleomagnetic data (same as lower plot). Black line $=$ northward drift of a seamount with time if formed at the Tristan hotspot location (Schlömer et al., 2017), assuming a fixe d hotspot model (Torsvik et al., 2008). Blue line $=a$ moving hotspot model (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Green line $=$ paleolatitudes of the Tristan hotspot from a mantle flow model (Doubrovine et al., 2012), indicating ${\sim}7^{\circ}$ southward motion in 12 0 My. Orange line $=$ northward drift of the African plate in the moving hotspot model (Doubrovine et al., 2012). It is less tha n the fixed hotspot model because the Tristan hotspot is modeled as moving south. Adding the hotspot motion to the moving hotspot model absolute motion equals the total northward motion indicated by the morphology of the TGW chain an d the fixed hotspot model. All absolute motion models indicate that the African plate moved nearly monotonically northward, so they do not explain the rapid southward shift in paleolatitudes during the Late Cretaceous or the northward offse t of paleolatitudes during the early Cenozoic. The difference between modeled and observed paleolatitudes implies significant TPW (purple curve) (Doubrovine et al., 2012).  

Although dredge data from the TGW chain provide a foundation for identifying the evolution o f source zonation and plume-ridge interaction (Rohde et al., 2013a, 2013b; Hoernle et al., 2015; Class et al., 2014, 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019, 2020), fundamental questions remai n about source geometry, heterogeneity (how many end-members are required to explain the geochemical zonation?), and plume dynamics (O’Connor et al., 2012) that are important to furthe r our understanding of the global spectrum of plume systems. Is zonation of the TGW plum e caused by contributions from the LLSVP to one (or more) of the zones? What can this tell us abou t lower mantle heterogeneity, including LLSVP heterogeneity? Is TGW plume zonation linked t o the split into separate chains, as suggested by Rohde et al. (2013b)? What is the role of plume-ridg e interaction in both the morphology of the plume trail and the geochemically distinct subparalle l trends? To further address these questions, International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) dril l core sampling was required.

Figure F10. 3-D plot of the Pb isotopic composition of TGW hotspot track samples. Spatial geochemical zonation indicate s a triple-zoned plume (Class et al., 2015) where new data from dredge samples extend the previously identified dual zonation (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015). Gough track $=$ red, orange, purple; Tristan track $=$ blue; Center track $=$ green. Only high-precision Pb isotope data are shown, and uncertainty is smaller than the symbol size. Samples from the Trista n track with added depleted component with high Hf, high Nd, and low Sr isotopic composition are not shown for clarit y (Figure F13). Data sources: Salters and Sachi-Kocher (2010), Rohde et al. (2013a), Hoernle et al. (2015), and Homrighausen e t al. (2019). New data on Gough, Tristan, and Inaccessible Islands as well as seamounts sampled by MV1203 and older dredg e samples from McNish and RSA by C. Class (unpubl. data).  

Geochemical observations are limited by dredging because we do not know the stratigraphic relationship between different samples in a dredge. Dredges also generally only sample exposed unit s and thus often don’t provide more than a single composition (e.g., same lava flow sampled multipl e times) for individual dredge sites, in this case representing only a single point in compositiona l space. In contrast, sampling of the islands and DSDP Site 527 showed a compositional range (Figure F12, black outlines), representing (temporal/downhole) geochemical variability (e.g., Salter s and Sachi-Kocher, 2010). The potentially triple-zoned TGW plume can possibly be described by  a set of five linear binary mixing arrays in 3-D Pb isotopic space, four of which are defined by array s of island or drill site samples, namely Gough (forms two arrays), Tristan-Inaccessible, and DSD P Sites 527 and 528 (Figure F12). Only new drill cores can provide sufficient data to test whethe r there is indeed a geochemically distinct Center track (green in Figures F10, F11, F12, F13) (Clas s et al., 2014, 2015) or it simply reflects a mixture of the two outer (Tristan and Gough) geochemica l domains, as is also possible for the central track identified in the Galápagos hotspot track (Hoernl e et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003). Furthermore, detailed isotopic studies, including isotopes of Os, rare gases, and other isotope systems, for which appropriate material has not yet been recovere d by dredging, could provide evidence that the Center track lavas are derived from a distinct sourc e that cannot be explained by mixing of Tristan and Gough compositional end-members. As note d above, isotope data for the different units at a drill site can form arrays on isotope diagrams, whic h could help distinguish between the aforementioned possibilities. If the arrays from different site s extend from the Gough to Tristan compositional domain, then mixing of Tristan and Gough is th e more likely origin of the central domain. If the central samples form an array that is subparallel t o the Tristan and Gough domains or if additional isotope systems show that the central domain ha s a composition that cannot be explained by mixing of Gough and Tristan compositions, this woul d argue for a distinct intermediate third domain. Most present models of plume zonation attribut e the zonation to sampling of the LLSVP margin by part of the plume base and sampling of th e ambient mantle surrounding the LLSVP. In the simplest case, this should result in two geochemically distinct compositional fields that are not directly related. Evidence for an additional geochemical zone would place this simple model into question, requiring the presence of three o r more distinct chemical reservoirs at the plume base (Lohmann et al., 2009). Zonation of the Discovery plume, with distinct zones of Gough-type material in the north and even more enriche d and distinct EMI-type material in the south (but no evidence of the Tristan composition), indicates that the model proposed thus far to explain Tristan-Gough zonation may be too simpl e (Schwindrofska et al., 2016). If the Gough and Tristan tracks share a common end-member (e.g., low $\mathrm{^{206}P b/^{204}P b)}$ , defined by the intersection of three main geographic arrays (Figure F12), thi s could also call into question the simple model that the LLSVP is the global cause for plume zonation because it would imply that all three TGW zones share at least one common end-member. Nevertheless, this could also point to mixing of ambient mantle with three distinct component s with radiogenic $\tt P b$ isotopes from the LLSVP. Being able to define small-scale trends in drill core s (especially if there is deeper penetration of the volcanic sequence, e.g., ${\geq}200~\mathrm{m}$ ) can help us sor t out the origin of the different components.

Gough track $=$ red, purple; Tristan track $=$ blue, turquois e (depleted), yellow (plume-ridge); Center track $=$ green. The three tracks are highlighted with transparent lines (that do no t reflect plate motion) that connect most of the samples of each compositional zone and demonstrate the mostly spatiall y well separated zones (though there is some overlap). Only the north prong of the TGW chain after the split shows geochemical evidence for interaction of the plume with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In contrast, Tristan track samples with depleted compositions can be found over the entire length of the Tristan track. The older Walvis Ridge (red circles) shows no chemica l zonation but extends the Gough track signature (Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2019).

The compositional range is described as linear mixing arrays, and $95\%$ confidence belts are shown. Highlighte d are DSDP 527 and 528, Tristan Island group, and Gough Island samples, which show that the islands and drill sites sho w compositional variability that define mixing arrays. In contrast, dredge locations generally give only one compositiona l point. The few dredge locations that gave a compositional range are outlined and generally follow mixing arrays. Drillin g can help test the triple-zoned plume model; a drill site in each of the three zones should give arrays that are parallel to th e proposed mixing arrays. If the Center zone instead shows mixing between the Gough and Tristan end-members (compositional array perpendicular to the Center track), this will support the current model that zoned plumes sample the LLSV P margin and the ambient mantle outside of the LLSVP.

Data sources: Salters and Sachi-Kocher (2010), Rohde et al. (2013a), Hoernle et al. (2015), and Homrighausen et al. (2019).  

The recent identification in $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Pb}}$ isotopic space of zoned plumes containing more than two distinc t chemical zones—Galápagos (Hoernle et al., 2000), Samoa (Jackson et al., 2014), and TGW (Clas s et al., 2014, 2015)—provide an opportunity to further refine our understanding of the dynami c process of source sampling by plumes. For Samoa, the mixing relationship between He and P b isotopic data is best explained by an LLSVP-sourced, high- $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ plume matrix that hosts an d mixes with several distinct low $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ end-members representing subducted slabs that overli e the LLSVP (Jackson et al., 2014). In the case of the TGW, Discovery, and Shona plumes in th e South Atlantic, the Gough composition, the main compositional type in all three hotspots, ha s been attributed to the LLSVP, whereas the Tristan and Southern Discovery components coul d reflect a heterogeneous ambient mantle outside of the LLSVP and/or heterogeneity within th e LLSVP (consisting of primarily Gough but also more enriched pockets in Southern Discovery). Unlike Samoa, the Gough compositional domain in the hotspot tracks does not generally appea r to serve as a matrix for the other components such as Southern Discovery and only in a very limited fashion for the TGW composition. Galápagos (Hoernle et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003), Samoa (Jackson et al., 2014), Discovery (Schwindrofska et al., 2016), and the unpublished data fo r the TGW system (Class et al., 2014, 2015) suggested that plume zonation could be considerabl y more complex than models simply explaining dual chemical tracts. To gain further insights as t o whether the TGW hotspot consists primarily of two compositionally and geographically distinc t compositional fields or it instead consists of multiple distinct binary mixing arrays, we need samples from stratigraphic sequences at separate locations to see whether each such sequence forms  a distinct binary array and/or whether the data fall in distinct compositional fields for a given geographic location or zone. Using additional isotope systems, if appropriate material is recovered, could also shed further light on plume zonation.  

O’Connor and Jokat (2015b) proposed that the north side of Walvis Ridge, including the Trista n track of the morphological split, was formed by plume-ridge interaction, whereas the Center trac k and Gough track were formed by intraplate plume volcanism. Radiogenic isotope signatures o f plume-ridge interaction, as inferred from ridge segments close to Tristan and Gough islands an d characterized by an intermediate enriched mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB)-like composition, ar e only found in dredge samples from the Tristan track (Figure F13, yellow circles) (C. Class, unpubl. data) but not in the rest of Walvis Ridge (Figure F13). The drill sites at Valdivia Bank (U1576 an d U1577) and Frio Ridge (Site U1575) can further test the model of plume-ridge interaction. Becaus e it samples all three prongs (on- and off-ridge seamounts), the transect of proposed drill site s across the Guyot Province split will clarify the role of plume-ridge interaction and the endmember compositions from the plume contributing to each of the three seamount trails.  

Recently, samples from seamounts in the TGW chain, interpreted by O’Connor and Jokat (2015b ) to represent the Tristan-Gough plume track, were found to have a distinct composition from th e TGW basement (Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019). The eastern TGW basement generally has  a flat top with some graben structures cutting it, and younger seamount volcanoes are located o n top of the flat-topped ridge. This deformation has been related to plume-ridge interactio n (O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b), but it must postdate the erosion of Walvis Ridge, placing plumeridge interaction for the cause of this deformation into question. The EMI (Gough and Tristan)- type basement shows an excellent age progression of about $30\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ (Figure F6). In contrast to th e EMI-type compositions of the Walvis Ridge basement, the younger seamounts, which also sho w an age progression but with ${\sim}30$ My younger ages on average than the EMI basement at a give n location, have compositions extending from end-member St. Helena HIMU to enriched MORB– type mantle (Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019). An important question that might be addresse d through drilling is to find a stratigraphic sequence with HIMU-type lavas overlying EMI-typ e lavas or the presence of HIMU dikes/sills within the EMI basement sequence.  

Previous scientific drilling has demonstrated that fresh olivine-bearing volcanic rocks and glas s are commonly recovered. Olivines and volcanic glass are highly susceptible to alteration by seawater contact, and thus dredging rarely retrieves such samples, in particular fresh olivine. Fres h glass can provide the liquid composition and preserve accurate abundances of volatile elements, such as $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{:}$ , S, F, and Cl. Fresh olivines can be used for a variety of analytical purposes, includin g analyses of He isotopes to test for high $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ and thus a lower mantle origin of the material, an d to constrain further the degassing history of the Earth (Class and Goldstein, 2005; Tolstikhin an d Hofmann, 2005; Jackson and Carlson, 2011). Thus far, high $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ ratios above MORB value s $\left(>10\;\mathrm{R/Ra}\right)$ have not been found along the submarine Tristan-Gough hotspot track. In contrast t o the other major plumes that show bilateral zonation (Hawaii, Galápagos, and Samoa), no hig h $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ signature has been identified for the TGW chain. High $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ isotope ratios, however , have been found in samples with Gough-type Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions where the Discovery and Shona hotspots are interacting with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sarda et al., 2000). If high H e isotopic ratios are found in olivines from drill samples along the TGW hotspot track, they coul d help unravel which components may be derived from the LLSVP. Olivine can also provide important information about the contents of primitive (early and deeply trapped) volatile elements i n melt inclusions and of the composition of primitive and, in some cases, possibly primary melts. They can be used to determine O isotopes to evaluate the involvement of continental material i n the source of the magmas, which has been postulated for the EMI signature found in Walvis Ridg e lavas. Finally, olivine chemistry can help determine the source lithology, constraining the relativ e role of pyroxenite versus peridotite in the source of oceanic basalts. This will allow for the assessment of the role of recycled oceanic crust in plume sources and thus provide insights into th e geodynamic evolution of Earth’s mantle (Sobolev et al., 2005).  

It has been proposed that Valdivia Bank and Rio Grande Rise Massif are continental fragment s (van der Linden, 1980; Santos et al., 2019). Continental rocks and zircons have been found in othe r large volcanic provinces, such as Kerguelen Plateau and Broken Ridge (Frey et al., 2002; Ingle et al., 2002), Iceland (Torsvik et al., 2015), and Mauritius (Torsvik et al., 2013). This relationship is uncertain but may reflect the transport of continental slivers into ocean basins during continental riftin g (Torsvik et al., 2015). Although gravity fabric within Valdivia Bank implies that its formation i s related to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sager et al., 2021), the continental fragment hypothesis can b e tested by coring Valdivia Bank to see if lavas show geochemical signals of continental lithospher e assimilation during fractional crystallization.  

During Expedition 391, we drilled the Center track to confirm or dismiss the triple-zoned plum e model versus a mixed center zone model (Site U1578). Core samples from Valdivia Bank (Site s U1576 and U1577) and Frio Ridge (Site U1575) will test the lack of zonation in the older Walvi s Ridge and a possible continental fragment at Valdivia Bank. All sites can potentially provide samples with which we can test the role of lower mantle as the source of the various components, a s well as the geochemical fingerprints of plume-ridge interactions. In addition, the cores will b e used to test for temporal changes in composition during the formation of the TGW hotspot track, whether they are on the scale of a single hole or whether they occur during the longer term histor y of the hotspot. Finally, detailed major and trace element data combined with isotope geochemistr y can be used to evaluate magma system dynamics during the growth of individual volcanic structures in the Guyot Province and the eastern Walvis Ridge, and volcanological studies can be use d to evaluate the detailed growth of parts of these structures through time and magma-water interactions.  

# 2.4. Prior drilling results from Walvis Ridge  

A small number of sites were drilled on Walvis Ridge, and most only cored the sedimentary section. During DSDP Leg 39, Site 359 was drilled atop one of the Walvis Ridge Guyot Province seamounts (The Shipboard Scientific Party, 1977), and during DSDP Leg 40, Sites 362 and 363 wer e cored on Frio Ridge near the continental margin (The Shipboard Scientific Party, 1978). Coring a t Site 359 penetrated only 107 meters below seafloor (mbsf) and ended in Eocene volcaniclasti c sediments and breccia (The Shipboard Scientific Party, 1977), whereas coring at Sites 362 and 36 3 penetrated 1081 and 715 mbsf, respectively, and ended in Eocene and Aptian limestone, respectively.  

During DSDP Leg 74, five sites (525–529) were drilled across Walvis Ridge between $2^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ . Al l sites recovered Cenozoic to Late Cretaceous carbonate sediments, and three penetrated into igneous crust (Site $525=103\;\mathrm{m};$ ; Site $527=43\;\mathrm{m}$ ; Site $528=80\;\mathrm{m}$ ) (Moore et al., 1984). At these thre e sites, basement recovery was high (average $=62\%$ ), and basalt flows with intercalated sediment s were recovered. Radiometric dates at the sites range $68{-}72\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , with one exception that was to o young (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b). During DSDP Leg 75, Sites 530 and 53 2 were drilled on or near Frio Ridge, not far from the continental margin (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1984a). Coring at Site 530, which is located in the Angola Basin immediately north of Frio Ridge, penetrated $1121\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sedimentary section, recovering Late Albian sediments atop basalt flow s (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1984a). Coring at Site 532, located atop Frio Ridge at $10.5^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ , penetrated $291\,\textrm{m}$ of sediments, the oldest of which is Miocene (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1984a). ODP Leg 208 revisited the Leg 74 transect but cored only the sedimentary section for paleoceanographic studies (Sites 1262–1267) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004).  

Away from the continental margin, most cored sediments are open ocean carbonates. These res t atop shallow-water carbonate sediments and basalt at the base of the section. Both Legs 74 an d 208 recovered Cenozoic nannofossil or foraminifera ooze grading to ooze and chalk at 200–30 0 mbsf (The Shipboard Scientific Party, 1978; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004). This sedimentar y section is often $300{-}500\,\mathrm{m}$ thick, ranging from Paleocene–Eocene to Neogene. Distinct basal sediments atop igneous basement have only been cored at a few sites; volcanic breccia were recovere d at Site 359 (The Shipboard Scientific Party, 1977), and volcanogenic turbidites and carbonate san d were recovered at Sites 526, 528, and 529 (Moore et al., 1984). Cores from Sites 359 and 526, whic h are both located on guyot tops, suggest the possibility of volcaniclastic sections on seamount summits. At Site 359, shipboard scientists conjectured a volcaniclastic layer ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ thick based on  a single core and a poor-quality seismic profile (The Shipboard Scientific Party, 1977). At Site 526, coring penetrated $114\,\mathrm{m}$ of Eocene carbonate sands and sandstone that contain $20\%{-}40\%$ volcani c debris (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1984b). Summarizing these prior results, drilling on low-slop e seamount flanks should encounter a thin cover of open ocean calcareous ooze and chalk overlyin g basalt flows. On seamount summits, open-ocean carbonates may be underlain by a basal layer o f shallow water carbonates and volcaniclastics.  

# 3. Site survey data and site selection  

# 3.1. Site selection  

The proposal for Expedition 391 was based initially on four modern multichannel seismic profile s collected by German scientists on the research vessels (R/Vs) Meteor and Polarstern. This dat a paucity is a result of years of underfunding of seismic investigations in the Southern Ocean. Nevertheless, we were lucky to have these data. Without them, the Walvis Ridge proposal would no t have passed evaluation by the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP). Although th e initial lines had no seismic cross-lines, which are normally done for IODP site surveys, sites wer e approved on the recognition that seamount flanks have a relatively simple structure, with gentl y sloping flanks consisting of lava flows covered with a thin layer of sediment. It is possible to infe r the flank slopes and direction, and there are no known safety hazards. The primary sites propose d from these initial data were Sites CT-4A, GT-4A, TT-1A, VB-1B, VB-4B, and FR-1B. These si x primary sites and an additional eight alternate sites were approved at the September 2018 EPS P meeting.  

Subsequently, a site survey proposal was funded by the US National Science Foundation to collec t seismic data over Walvis Ridge. This survey (R/V Thomas G. Thompson Cruise TN373) was carried out in late 2019. New seismic lines were run across the three previously targeted guyots an d Valdivia Bank. These lines also crossed most of the previously proposed sites. An additional 1 4 new sites were proposed and accepted by the EPSP at the February 2020 meeting. Three of th e previously approved sites were replaced with new sites. Proposed Site TT-4A, on the lower flan k of the TT guyot, replaced proposed Site TT-1A because of the latter’s proximity to a summit cone, revealed by the new seismic data, that may represent later volcanism. Proposed Site VB-12A, o n the east flank of Valdivia Bank, replaced proposed Site VB-1B to provide a site on the east flank o f the plateau. Proposed Site VB-14A replaced proposed Site VB-4B on the west flank of Valdivi a Bank. The new seismic line shows rough basement and diffractions near the old site that may represent a fault zone. The new site is upslope on basement that appears less fractured. Aside fro m the 6 primary sites, the remaining 22 sites were retained as alternates so that if problems arose at  a primary site, there would be alternates nearby.  

Of the four sites cored on Expedition 391, two were alternate sites. As planned, Site U1575 wa s cored at proposed primary Site FR-1B and Site U1576 was cored at proposed primary Site VB14A. Owing to severe time constraints in the revised plan, Site U1577 was cored at alternate Sit e VB-13A and Site U1578 was cored at alternate Site CT-5A. In both cases, the alternate was chose n because it had less sediment cover, which meant less time was devoted to coring sediments. Limited time also characterized the drilling done during Expedition 397T, so two sites were chosen fo r shallow depths and thin sedimentary cover. For Site U1584, a new proposed site (GT-6A) wa s picked near the previously proposed Site GT-4A, about $1~\mathrm{km}$ farther upslope where sedimen t thickness was about half as much. Although alternate Site TT-3A was initially targeted for Expedition 397T, instead, the original Expedition 391 primary Site TT-4A was drilled as Site U1585.  

# 3.2. Seismic data from the Meteor and Polarstern cruises  

The four initial seismic lines are GeoB01-25, GeoB01-29, AWI-20060650, and AWI-20060660. The GeoB profiles were collected from Meteor during Cruise 49 Leg 1, which was completed i n 2001. Seismic data collected during this cruise were used as site survey data for ODP Leg 208. Th e two AWI profiles were obtained from Polarstern during Expedition ANT-XXIII Leg 5 in 2006. Both cruises used GPS for positioning. The Polarstern cruise collected bathymetry data with  a Krupp-Atlas Hydrosweep multibeam echosounder. The multibeam on Meteor was not working a t the time of the survey.  

The Meteor seismic data were collected with a 48-channel streamer, $600~\mathrm{m}$ in length, which wa s kept at the desired depth by 10 DigiCourse depth controllers (birds). The source had three components: two generator-injector (GI) air guns and a water gun. The GI guns had generator and injector volumes of $0.41\,\mathrm{L}$ (a reduced-volume source) and $1.7\,\mathrm{L}$ and were towed at a depth of $1.4\,\mathrm{m}$ . Th e water gun volume was $0.16\,\mathrm{L}$ , and it was towed at a $0.5\,\mathrm{m}$ depth. Shots were fired at ${\sim}10$ s intervals, producing shot intervals of ${\sim}30{-}35\;\mathrm{m},$ , but the GI guns were alternated.  

The Polarstern seismic data were collected as a part of a larger effort that included seismic refraction. The seismic source was therefore large: four air guns with $8.5\,\mathrm{L}$ volume operated at 190 ba r pressure. The streamer had a total length of $800\,\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , with an active section $600\,\mathrm{m}$ in length, containing 96 channels with $6.25\:\mathrm{m}$ hydrophone group spacing. The shooting interval was $15\,s_{\scriptscriptstyle\!\perp}$ , producin g shot intervals of ${\sim}35\mathrm{~m~}$ . The streamer was towed at a depth of $10~\mathrm{m}$ , whereas the air guns wer e towed at a depth of $5\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The processing of the seismic data from these two cruises was as follows. As a first step, eac h profile was binned to a common midpoint (CMP) interval of $15\;\mathrm{m}$ , resulting in a fold of up to 1 4 and 18 in GeoB and AWI lines, respectively. The sampling rate of GeoB profiles was reduced t o $0.5\;\mathrm{ms}$ to match the frequency content of the source signal $(20{-}250\ \mathrm{Hz})$ . After removing corrup t traces/channels and adding a recording delay of up to $5\;s$ , a 2-D spike removal within individua l channels was performed. Data were then corrected for normal moveout (NMO) with a velocity o f $1500~\mathrm{m/s}$ . A static correction was applied to eliminate wave motion effects, and spike remova l within shot gathers was performed before stacking. CMP stacked data then underwent frequenc y filtering: a Butterworth filter of 10/25/550/860 Hz and an adjustable notch filter aroun d $47/49/51/53\ \mathrm{Hz}$ were applied. Trace interpolation was used to fill missing CMP locations. Whit e noise reduction preceded the final step, which was finite difference time migration ( $1500\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s},$ 1 ms tau step, and a filtered $45^{\circ}{-}65^{\circ}$ solution). Processing of AWI lines followed a similar sequence. Data manipulation included an initial debias step. Static corrections were not performed. Rathe r than frequency filtering, an F-K filter was applied to CMP-stacked data to remove noise stripe s within the signal frequency range. Because of the lower data sampling rate, time migration wa s carried out with an 8 tau step.  

# 3.3. Site survey data from the Thomas G. Thompson cruise  

New site survey data were collected during Thomas G. Thompson Cruise TN373 in November– December 2019. A total of ${\sim}3015\,\mathrm{km}$ of 2-D multichannel seismic profiles were collected with th e Scripps Institution of Oceanography multichannel seismic system, which consists of a 96-channe l Geometrics GeoEel streamer and two Sercel $45{-}105\ \mathrm{in}^{3}$ (0.16–0.37 L) GI air guns as a source. Swath bathymetry data were obtained with a $30\;\mathrm{kHz}$ Kongsberg EM302 multibeam system. Subbottom profiles were recorded with a Knudsen Model 3260 CHIRP sonar operating at $3.5~\mathrm{kHz}$ frequency.  

The multichannel system was towed at a speed of 4.5–5.0 kt $(8.3{-}9.3\;\mathrm{km/h})$ ), and shots were fire d on distance at $25\textrm{m}$ intervals. Because the GeoEel streamer has a group spacing of $6.25\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , thi s speed provided 12-fold coverage, with a CMP spacing of $3.125\mathrm{~m~}$ . Data were digitized at an interval of $1~\mathrm{ms}$ and recorded in SEGD format shot files. The seismic streamer was towed at a dept h of $4\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and depth was maintained by four birds. Electronic compasses in the birds were used t o calculate the geometry and position of the streamer so that accurate CMP positions could be calculated. The source air guns were towed at a depth of $3\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Processing was done with GeoEast software from BGP. Preprocessing included removing duplicate shot records, fixing incorrect shot locations, and removing malfunctioning receiver records. For statics correction, the source delay was fixed by adding a constant $50\,\mathrm{m}$ shift to the data. Swell, linear, and wild noise attenuation were applied to lessen swell, linear, and high-amplitude noise, respectively. Deghosting was done to reduce the signal reflected from the ocean surface. Fo r debubbling, a matching filter was determined from the source wavelet, and this signal wa s removed from the data. Surface multiples were predicted and attenuated using the SRME modul e in GeoEast. Root mean square velocity profiles were determined with semblance analysis, typicall y done every 300 CMP but sometimes more often in areas with complex structure. Prior to stacking, NMO was removed along with stretch muting and $8{-}200~\mathrm{Hz}$ bandpass filtering. For poststac k migration, root mean square velocities were converted to interval velocity and finite-differenc e migration was carried out in the x-t domain.  

# 4. Scientific objectives  

Expedition 391 addresses the geodynamic implications of the TGW hotspot track, the most prominent in the Atlantic, to improve our understanding of the global spectrum of hotspot volcanism. Primary questions include the following:  

• Is Walvis Ridge split into two or three geochemically distinct seamount chains, and is isotopic zonation consistent with involvement of two, as proposed for bilaterally zoned Pacific hotspots, or three distinct plume sources at the LLSVP edge?   
• Is the chain strictly age progressive, or were multiple plume pulses, microplates, or continental fragments involved?   
• What do potentially large shifts in paleolatitude reveal about the fixity and geodynamics of the hotspot?  

The R/V JOIDES Resolution cored sediments and basaltic lava flows at six sites, coring ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ o f lava flows at five sites (U1575–U1577, U1584, and U1585) and ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ at one site (U1578). Basal t samples will be analyzed to document the geochemical and isotopic evolution of the TG W hotspot, testing the hypothesis of geochemical division into two or three distinct geographic geochemical zones beginning at ${\sim}70\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Research on samples from Sites U1578, U1584, and U158 5 will test whether a third geochemical reservoir was involved in the formation of the younge r hotspot track. High-precision geochronology from igneous samples will test models of ridgehotspot interaction, including a microplate model; examine the duration of volcanism at individual sites; and further document the age progression. Paleomagnetic measurements on igneou s samples will constrain paleolatitude changes of the hotspot track, allowing for more rigorous testing of models of hotspot motion and TPW.  

# 4.1. Scientific questions and answer strategy  

# 4.1.1. What is the basement age progression at Valdivia Bank?  

Many hotspot models assume that Valdivia Bank is an age-progressive segment of Walvis Ridg e that becomes younger to the south (e.g., Doubrovine et al., 2012). Others suggest that this edific e formed along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge crest (O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b), perhaps because of interaction with a microplate (Thoram et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021), which implies that the entir e edifice is nearly the same age. Although there is considerable overlap in ages, when the samples ar e divided based on geochemistry the EMI- and HIMU-type samples form distinct age-progressiv e trends, suggesting that some of the complications may result from late-stage volcanism coverin g much of the older Valdivia Bank structure (Homrighausen et al., 2018, 2019, 2020). High-precisio n geochronology data will test whether there is an age progression in the basement lavas alon g Valdivia Bank, as expected from the plume model, or whether it formed synchronously over  a large area, as implied by the plume-ridge or microplate models. High-precision geochemical dat a will elucidate the genetic relationship between Valdivia Bank, Rio Grande Rise, and the MidAtlantic Ridge.  

# 4.1.2. Does Valdivia Bank contain a continental fragment?  

Although no longer widely accepted, it has been proposed that Valdivia Bank is a continental fragment (van der Linden, 1980). Evidence of continental material has been found in other oceani c plateaus: Kerguelen Plateau (Frey et al., 2002; Ingle et al., 2002), Mauritius (Torsvik et al., 2013), and Iceland (Torsvik et al., 2015). Furthermore, the same has been suggested for Rio Grande Ris e (Santos et al., 2019), so the idea cannot yet be dismissed. Coring on Valdivia Bank can help test thi s idea, either through direct drilling of continental rocks or by showing continental crustal contamination in the geochemistry of the recovered rocks or as xenocrysts (e.g., quartz or zircon) o r xenoliths of continental crust. If continental material is found, it will indicate that the continenta l fragment hypothesis is correct, although lack of such evidence is unlikely to disprove the hypothesis because it can be argued that such evidence was simply missed by limited coring.  

# 4.1.3. Is Valdivia Bank a product of ridge volcanism?  

Recent magnetic studies of Shatsky Rise found linear magnetic anomalies covering the entire plateau, leading to the conclusion that the plateau was formed by seafloor spreading (Huang et al., 2018; Sager et al., 2019). Geochemical studies indicated that Shatsky Rise rocks have composition s of enriched MORB (Sano et al., 2012) and formed with higher percentages $(15\%{-}23\%)$ of partia l melt than MORB (Husen et al., 2013; Heydolph et al., 2014). Plate reconstructions imply tha t Ontong Java Plateau also formed at or near a spreading ridge (Mahoney and Spencer, 1991; Taylor, 2006) with high degrees of partial melting $(30\%)$ (Fitton and Godard, 2004). Magnetic anomalie s over Valdivia Bank imply that it also formed by spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Thoram et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). Evidence for the involvement of MORB in the EMI-type basement lavas, however, is not obvious (Figure F13). Thus, geochemical studies of Valdivia Bank lavas can provide improved knowledge of the process by which oceanic plateaus form in conjunction wit h spreading ridges. Olivines can be used as geothermometers to infer the temperature of melting. Major and trace elements can be used to infer percentages of partial melting involved in formin g the basalts.  

# 4.1.4. Does Walvis Ridge split into three distinct isotopic signatures?  

Studies of isotope ratios show that Walvis Ridge splits into two distinct isotopic signatures nea r the location where the chain splits into two or three separate seamount chains, at an age of ${\sim}65\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015). Preliminary isotopic studies suggest that the middl e seamount chain may have a different signature and that the younger part of the TGW hotspo t track possibly displays three distinct geochemical zones (Class et al., 2015). Because isotopic zoning is thought to arise from heterogeneities at the base of a mantle plume (Farnetani and Samuel, 2005; Farnetani and Hofmann, 2009; Farnetani et al., 2012; Lohmann et al., 2009), perhaps at th e  

LLSVP edge (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Schwindrofska et al., 2016), the answer t o this question has important implications for mantle geodynamics.  

# 4.1.5. Is the isotopic split related to the morphological split into separate seamount chains?  

The northernmost seamount chain (Tristan track) appears to have formed by hotspot interactio n with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, whereas the other one or two seamount chains (Center track an d Gough track) formed from one or more hotspots beneath the African plate (O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a). Can the isotopic differences be explained by on-ridge versus off-ridge formation? Thi s question can be answered by comparing geochemical and isotopic data from cored igneous rock s on the Tristan track to samples from the possible Center and Gough tracks.  

# 4.1.6. What is the paleolatitude motion of the hotspot?  

Basaltic rocks are excellent magnetic field recorders and have been used to measure the paleolatitude of other hotspots: Hawaii (Tarduno et al., 2003) and Louisville (Koppers et al., 2012). Coring targeted Walvis Ridge igneous basement with the objective of collecting enough samples t o calculate a precise paleolatitude for the mid-Late Cretaceous (Valdivia Bank; ${\sim}84{-}103\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) an d Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic (guyots; $55\mathrm{-}65\ \mathrm{Ma}_{\cdot}$ ). In addition, coring penetrated a sedimentary section that may contain lithified carbonate sediments that can also be used to estimat e paleolatitude. These paleolatitude data can record changes that can be compared with geodynamic models of hotspot motion and TPW.  

# 4.2. Drilling and coring strategy  

The plan for Expeditions 391 and 397T included coring at six primary sites on Walvis Ridge in tw o groups of three. Sites U1575–U1577 cross Valdivia Bank from west to east and north to sout h (Figure F1) to test age and formation models for that oceanic plateau. The general approach was t o drill as much igneous rock as possible in the time allowed. The Guyot Province sites (U1578, U1584, and U1585) form a transect across three seamount chains that define the morphologi c split of the TGW track (Figure F1). These sites are positioned to record differences in geochemica l and isotopic characteristics from the seamount sources.  

The plan was to use the rotary core barrel (RCB) system at each site to maximize the time spen t coring igneous rock. This system is designed for coring hard formations, so it often does a poo r job of coring poorly lithified sediments. To obtain minimally disturbed sediments, cores are usually obtained with the advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel (XCB) systems, bu t they require a different bit assembly. Typically, use of the RCB system results in moderate to sever e disturbance of unlithified carbonate oozes. In contrast, it often produces good samples from mor e lithified chalk and limestone.  

Initially, four proposed sites were planned to be single-bit holes (VB-12A, VB-14A, TT-4A, an d GT-4A), meaning that coring proceeds into basement until the bit fails or allotted time expires. From past drilling of seamount lavas, it was estimated that this would penetrate ${\sim}80{-}100\;\mathrm{m}$ int o igneous rock. Three of the four sites drilled during Expedition 391 and both sites drilled durin g Expedition 397T were single-bit holes. Penetration was less than expected at Site U1577 becaus e massive lava flows encountered led to slow penetration rates coupled with reduced time for operations. Penetration at Site U1584 was also less than planned because indurated volcaniclastic s were encountered, so time was saved for future operations by terminating drilling early. Two proposed sites were planned to establish two-bit holes (FR-1B and CT-4A), meaning that the hol e would be cored first with one bit and that bit replaced when it wears out. Owing to lack of time, only one two-bit hole (Site U1578) was drilled.  

Changing the bit for drilling a two-bit hole requires raising and taking apart the drill string, whic h requires ${\sim}8\mathrm{~h~}$ , depending on water depth. After the bit is replaced on the bottom-hole assembl y (BHA), it is lowered to the seafloor by reassembling the drill string, which takes about the sam e amount of time as raising it. Hole reentry is possible with a reentry cone on the seafloor. The con e is located with the aid of sonar and a subsea camera, and the ship’s crew positions the ship abov e the cone so that the drill string can be lowered into the hole. Reentry was accomplished using  a free-fall funnel as the seafloor cone because this device is usually the most economical in terms o f time. This funnel is assembled around the drill string and then dropped to the seafloor.  

# 4.3. Wireline logging strategy  

The wireline logging plan for Expedition 391 aimed to provide continuous stratigraphic coverag e of in situ formation properties at all proposed sites. Two tool string configurations were planne d for each site. Unfortunately, the logging plan was a casualty of severe time limitations caused b y lost time addressing the COVID-19 outbreak on board JOIDES Resolution. All available operation s time during Expedition 397T was directed toward coring.  

# 5. Site summaries  

# 5.1. Site U1575  

# 5.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1575 (proposed Site FR-1B) is located within a low saddle on the northeastern end of Walvi s Ridge between the higher Frio Ridge (near the continental margin) and Valdivia Bank, a larg e ocean plateau edifice (Figure F1). Its location is on Seismic Line GeoB-029 where sediments ar e relatively thin and the basement reflector is clear (Figures F14, F15). The drill site was chosen a s the eastern (older) end of the Expedition 391 transect because it represented an opportunity t o sample a part of the ridge that cannot be sampled by dredging due to sediment cover. It also represents the hotspot trail shortly after it passed from the African continental margin to oceani c crust. Trace element and isotopic geochemistry can provide insights into the transition from th e plume head to plume tail stage of hotspots, specifically whether both high- $\mathrm{\cdotTiO_{2}}$ (Gough-type) an d low- $\mathrm{\cdotTiO_{2}}$ (Doros-type) basalts are present in the plume tail, as has been found in the Etendek a (and Paraná) flood basalts (plume head stage) (Zhou et al., 2020). Furthermore, does the Trista n signature, which is found in the younger chain (seamount chain going from Walvis Ridge DSD P Site 527 to Tristan da Cunha Islands), appear in the older portion of the ridge, extending the geochemical zonation of the hotspot track further back in time? The drill cores provided samples tha t show the eruption age of the main TGW hotspot track in an area that is often overprinted wit h late-stage volcanism. Furthermore, Site U1575 provided paleomagnetic samples for a time whe n the hotspot is predicted to have been ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ north of its current paleolatitude and when the paleolatitude was rapidly changing. The site also recovered sediments deposited near the Benguela Current in a regime that is transitional from continental margin siliciclastic to open-ocean pelagi c carbonate deposition, which could reveal past marine environmental conditions.

A single hole was cored at Site U1575 (Table T1). Hole U1575A is located at $21^{\circ}51.9659^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $6^{\circ}35.4369^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $3231.3\;\mathrm{m}$ as obtained from the precision depth recorder (PDR). I n Hole U1575A, we used the RCB coring system to advance from the seafloor to a final depth o f 332.3 mbsf and recovered $185.2\;\mathrm{m}$ $(56\%)$ of sediment and igneous rock. Hole U1575A penetrate d $122.4~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. Coring was terminated to meet the remaining major objectives o f the expedition. The total time spent on Hole U1575A was $137.0\,\mathrm{h},$ or 5.7 days.

# 5.1.3. Principal results  

# 5.1.3.1. Sedimentology  

The sedimentary cover at Site U1575 includes three lithostratigraphic units that consist of a thic k Pleistocene to late Miocene succession of unconsolidated calcareous nannofossil-foraminifer a ooze (Lithostratigraphic Unit I; 0–194.10 mbsf) and a much shorter Miocene to Upper Cretaceou s succession of poorly lithified nannofossil-foraminifera chalk with clay (Units II and III) to the bottom of the sedimentary succession above the igneous basement (Unit IV) at 209.92 mbsf (Figur e F16). It was not clear whether the contact between the sedimentary cover and the uppermost lav a in the basement (Igneous Unit 1) was recovered, but sedimentologic observations and preliminar y shipboard biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data do not suggest the existence of a significan t time gap between the deposition of the lavas and the overlying sedimentary sequence. Consisten t with an increase in sediment consolidation downhole, core recovery increases from ${\sim}52\%$ i n Lithostratigraphic Unit I to ${\sim}73\%$ in Unit III.

Figure F16. Lithostratigraphic summary, Hole U1575A.  

Unit I consists of a ${\sim}195\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession of white nannofossil-foraminifera ooze with mino r radiolarians that represents Pleistocene to Pliocene pelagic sedimentation. Subtle gray and, mor e rarely, white to green centimeter-sized banding occurs throughout due to accumulations of pyrit e framboids and possibly Fe-Mn-rich particles. The succession becomes pale brown in the lowermost $10\;\mathrm{m}$ of the unit, reflecting a minor increase in the clay content.  

Unit II is a much thinner $^{\leftmoon}_{\leftmoon}{<}10\,\textrm{m}\right)$ late Miocene to early Oligocene succession (194.10–198.5 6 mbsf) consisting of a brown nannofossil-foraminifera chalk with minor radiolarians and clays. Th e chalk is commonly bioturbated and includes subtle white to pale brown color changes controlle d by the relative abundance of calcareous (mostly biogenic) components and clays at the centimete r to subcentimeter scale. Rare microscopic particles of palagonite and volcanic minerals o f unknown provenance were also observed. Concentrated foraminifera bands and parallel to crossbedded laminae in the chalk likely indicate local winnowing and reworking by bottom currents.  

Unit III represents a ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Campanian sequence (198.56–209.92 mbsf) of predominantl y consolidated brown to pink nannofossil-foraminifera chalk with rare to minor radiolarians an d clays. Bioturbated chalk intervals are interrupted by winnowed bioclastic sand with parallel t o cross-bedded laminae and more rarely normal to inverse grading. Volcaniclastic deposits are rar e and consist of altered volcanic glass, ferromagnesian and Fe oxide minerals, and feldspars. Thes e clasts are mixed with a dominant bioclastic fraction composed of foraminifera and fragments o f inoceramid shells. Rare fragments of red algae were encountered, which suggests deposition of th e sequence at $<\!300$ mbsf and/or sediment reworking from a nearby shoal. These observation s support pelagic sedimentation under the influence of bottom currents and, possibly, low-densit y turbidity currents.  

Few structural features were observed in the sedimentary succession above the igneous basemen t of Unit IV. Several intervals of tilted bedding occur in Units II and III, which might represent primary sedimentary features or could be due to drilling disturbance effects. The apparent dips of th e tilted beds in Unit II are around $11^{\circ}$ , whereas those in Unit III are higher, averaging around $39^{\circ}$ . Two thick intervals $(\sim\!30\;\mathrm{cm})$ of sedimentary dikes formed above the tilted beds in Unit III, wher e sediments are strongly disturbed and mixed with coarse angular grains.  

Sedimentary deposits are also present intercalated with the lava succession in the igneous basement (Unit IV). In the upper part of the basement, the sedimentary deposits consist of white azoi c to nannofossil-bearing micrite that occurs in layered infills of cavities and cracks between an d within the lavas. Farther downhole, below the lower pillow lava package, similar thin intercalation s were deposited during hiatuses in volcanic activity.  

# 5.1.3.2. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Hole U1575A penetrated $122.4\textrm{m}$ of igneous basement, recovering $71.6~\mathrm{m}$ of rock $(58.5\%)$ . Thi s basement was divided into 10 igneous units, beginning with a succession of four massive submarine flows (Figure F17). Overall, the eruptive style comprises an alternating sequence of submarine lavas involving massive flows (up to $21\;\mathrm{m}$ thick), individual sheet flows, and stacks of pillo w and lobate lavas (Figure F17). All of these units consist of aphanitic to intersertal to holocrystallin e basalt with phenocrysts and glomerocrysts of plagioclase $(3\%{-}15\%)$ and clinopyroxene $(1\%-5\%)$ . Olivine is sparse and only intermittently present $(0\%{-}3\%)$ and is completely altered in $\mathord{\sim}50\%$ of th e lavas. The igneous units show significant overlap in mineralogy but may be summarized as follows: massive flow Igneous Subunits 1a and 1b $8.04\,\mathrm{m}$ thick) and 2a and 2b ( $18.08\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) consis t of pairs of highly plagioclase-pyroxene $\pm$ olivine phyric, holocrystalline basaltic lava flows separated by a glassy margin. Subunits $3\mathrm{a}{-}3\mathrm{d}$ present a change of eruptive behavior and consist o f $12.87\textrm{m}$ of intercalated succession of sheet flows, lobate flows, and pillow lava (i.e., pillow lav a stack). Modal compositions vary from sparsely to highly plagioclase-pyroxene-olivine phyric. Basaltic glass and altered aphanitic material are found in pillow rims and flow boundaries. Unit  4 comprises two massive basalt flows (2.16 and $6.22~\mathrm{m}$ thick) with sparse to moderate plagioclas e and pyroxene phenocryst abundance, including sparse olivine. Underlying these massive flows i s Unit 5, a thick $\left(15.00\,\textrm{m}\right)$ succession of pillow lavas that shows numerous glassy margins. Phenocrysts consist of plagioclase and pyroxene with trace amounts of olivine, and the groundmas s ranges from glassy to aphanitic to holocrystalline. Units 6–9 range from massive flows (Unit $6=$ $4.01~\mathrm{m}$ ; Unit $8\,=\,21.08\ \mathrm{m}$ ) to thinner underlying pillow lavas (Unit $7\,=\,4.05\mathrm{~m};$ ; Unit $9\,=\,1.92\mathrm{~m})$ ). Mineralogy varies from sparsely to moderately plagioclase-pyroxene phyric, lacking olivine. Thi s sequence erupted onto a nannofossil-foraminifera chalk substrate that is partially preserved at it s base and in pillow lobe interstices as disturbed and deformed material. At the bottom of Hol e U1575A, Subunits 10a $\left(5.06\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and 10b $(13.31\;\mathrm{m})$ consist of one massive flow each, separated b y chilled margins. They are moderately phyric and consist of variable proportions of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine with glomerophyric and holocrystalline textures. Alteration in the igneou s basement is due to ambient low-temperature seafloor processes. Oxidative alteration likel y occurred shortly after eruption as cooling lava units were subjected to seawater ingress, aided b y the development of cooling fractures in the brittle outer flow crust, leading to calcite precipitatio n in fractures. Alteration intensity is slight to occasionally moderate throughout, with centers o f thicker flows presenting near-fresh primary minerals (except for olivine). Low-temperature alteration is also reflected by carbonate vein networks, which vary in thickness and orientation. Thes e veins are frequently observed in the uppermost $20\textrm{m}$ of the volcanic succession of Unit IV an d decrease in abundance downhole. Throughout the igneous basement, the degree of overall alteration correlates positively with the abundance of carbonate veins.  

# 5.1.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Detailed calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera biostratigraphy was performed o n core catcher samples recovered from Hole U1575A. Microfossil examination provided a preliminary chronostratigraphic framework for sediments at Site U1575. First occurrence (FO) and las t occurrence (LO) datums were largely based on Gradstein et al. (2020).  

![](images/3f7c7074062d82ed2712b959226ca949034553f6efc5cc4660eeadbcc7b0e45a.jpg)  
Figure F17. Stratigraphic column for the volcanic succession in Lithostratigraphic Unit IV, Hole U1575A.  

The sediment succession at Site U1575 spans the Pleistocene to Upper Cretaceous (upper Campanian) time interval $(0.43{-}78\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). An almost continuous Pleistocene to Pliocene pelagic sediment succession was recorded in Lithostratigraphic Unit I, ranging 0.43–4.50 Ma (possibl y excluding the earliest Pliocene [Zanclean]). Key taxa for this time interval for calcareous nannofossils are Pseudoemiliania lacunosa, Helicosphaera sellii, Discoaster tamalis, and Amaurolithu s primus. Key taxa of planktonic foraminifera for this interval are Globorotalia hessi, Globorotali a crassaformis, and Globorotalia margaritae. Uncertainties in the assignment of the Pliocene/Miocene boundary were noted based on shipboard examination, and higher resolution studies will b e required to verify this boundary. The interpretation of the Miocene interval in Unit II was mor e complex due to possible hiatuses, poor recovery, and the presence of mixed assemblages. A tentative biostratigraphic framework places this part of the sequence in the upper Miocene, and furthe r postexpedition investigation is required. In Sections 391-U1575A-20R-CC through 21R-CC, Uni t II shows a time gap and extends to the lowest Oligocene (Rupelian), as detected by the occurrenc e of calcareous nannofossil Reticulofenestra umbilicus in Section 21R-CC. Farther downhole,  a major unconformity separates early Oligocene and late Campanian flora and fauna recorded i n Units II and III, respectively; the latter is the lowermost part of the cored sedimentary succession. The maximum age detected is ${\sim}78\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Section 20R-CC) based on the occurrence of nannofossi l species Eiffellithus eximius and Uniplanarius sissinghii along with the absence of Uniplanariu s trifidus. Samples were taken from thin sediment layers interbedded with lava flows within the igneous basement (Unit IV), but preliminary age determination will require postexpedition analysis.  

# 5.1.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Sediments recovered at Site U1575 are weakly magnetic (ranging $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m})$ ) in Cores 391- U1575A-1R through 20R (0–194.1 mbsf). As such, both the superconducting rock magnetomete r (SRM) and the JR-6A spinner magnetometer failed to produce reliable directions, and n o magnetostratigraphy could be determined for this interval. Lithified basal sediments from Core s 21R and 22R had stronger magnetizations (ranging $10^{-3}$ to $10^{1}\;\mathrm{A/m}\rangle$ ). Several intervals within th e basal sediments, however, exhibited pervasive tilting, precluding determination of a robus t magnetostratigraphy for Cores 21R and 22R. Nevertheless, we interpret Sections 22R-4 and 22R- 5 to represent reversed polarity Chron 32r.  

Igneous rocks recovered at Site U1575 are characterized by low unblocking temperatures $(\mathrm{\sim}150^{\circ}-$ $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ ) and median destructive field values ranging ${\sim}5{-}125~\mathrm{mT}$ . These unusually high coercivit y values are likely caused by the presence of dendritic iron oxides (most likely titanomagnetite o r titanomaghemite), which can exhibit strong magnetic anisotropy. These phases were observed i n thin sections of Hole U1575A igneous rocks. Thermal demagnetization of some discrete sample s showed evidence of possible partial self-reversal of magnetization. All samples subjected to alternating field (AF) demagnetization displayed a drill string overprint that was typically removed b y $20\;\mathrm{~mT~}$ before revealing a unidirectional origin-trending component. Magnetic inclination s obtained using principal component analysis from discrete samples agree well with inclination s associated with the $20~\mathrm{{mT}}$ AF demagnetization step in SRM data acquired from archive-hal f section at corresponding depths. Nearly all measurements are of normal polarity, consistent wit h basement formation during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (C34n).  

# 5.1.3.5. Geochemistry  

At Site U1575, interstitial water (IW) samples were analyzed for ${\mathsf{p H}}_{:}$ , alkalinity, major cation an d anion concentrations, and trace element concentrations. An alkalinity maximum is identified at 1 2 mbsf. Slightly below this depth, at $25{-}30~\mathrm{mbsf},$ maxima for $\mathsf{p H}$ , calcium, potassium, strontium, and silicon and minima for magnesium and lithium concentrations are observed. These feature s are attributable to diageneses of biogenic carbonates and silica in Lithostratigraphic Unit I.  A manganese reduction interval is found at $1.5{-}10\ \mathrm{mbsf}$ , followed by a sulfate reduction interval a t $10{-}50\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . The peaks of phosphate and ammonium located at 1.5 and 50 mbsf, respectively, ar e consistent with the manganese and sulfate reduction zone. Because of the hiatus between Lithostratigraphic Units I and II, no signs of interaction between basaltic basement and Unit I ar e observed, and profiles of many elemental concentrations remain uniform between 50 and 20 0 mbsf. Sediment samples were also analyzed to determine the content of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ total carbon, an d total organic carbon. In Unit I (dominantly nannofossil-foraminifera ooze), the $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ conten t ranges $93{-}98\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ . In Units II and III (dominantly nannofossil-foraminifera chalk), the $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content declines to 85 and $74\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively. Methane concentrations measured from the headspace gas are at the atmospheric background level (lower than $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L/L)}$ ).  

Representative samples obtained from the igneous basement were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and portable $\mathrm{X}$ -ray fluorescence (pXRF ) on both rock powders ${\big(}{\mathrm{n}}=33{\mathrm{\big)}}$ ) and surfaces of archive-half section rock pieces $(\mathfrak{n}=128)$ ). Overall, comparison of the ICP-AES and $\mathtt{p X R F}$ results from the same samples displays excellent to goo d correlation. The loss on ignition (LOI), a common indicator for the degree of alteration, is relatively low for such old submarine rocks $(<\!3\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ). Nevertheless, K and Sr enrichment due to seawater interaction and olivine alteration affect the composition of the analyzed lavas to variabl e degrees, which has also been documented by petrographic investigations. All igneous rock samples are basalts and have $\mathrm{Ti/V}$ values similar to MORBs and ridge-centered ocean island basalts. Downhole geochemical variations display an overall increase in MgO, possibly reflecting increasing differentiation of the magma reservoir with decreasing age. The most striking geochemica l variability is observed at ${\sim}274$ mbsf. In the upper portions of the recovered interval, the $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content is relatively constant and sharply drops at 274 mbsf at the bottom of Igneous Unit 5. Thereafter, the $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ value remains constant throughout Units 5–8 and slowly increases from Unit 9 t o Unit 10 again to a concentration similar to the upper part of the volcanic sequence (Units 1–5). This Ti evolution correlates with similar patterns for Sr, Y, and Zr. Another geochemical anomal y was identified around 255 mbsf in the lower part of Subunit 4a, which shows an enrichment o f $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ Ni, and Cu.  

# 5.1.3.6. Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were made on recovered whole-round and section half cores a s well as discrete cube and wedge samples, indicating three distinct units that correspond to th e established lithostratigraphic units: (1) calcareous ooze, (2) chalk, and (3) basalt. Within the sedimentary succession, natural gamma radiation (NGR) and magnetic susceptibility (MS) peaks a t $\mathord{\sim}194$ mbsf correlate to the calcareous ooze/chalk contact; mean NGR values increase from 3.3 t o 16.0 counts/s and average MS increases from 1.0 to $38.1~\mathrm{SI}\times10^{-5}$ . The transition from the sedimentary overburden to igneous basement is imaged at ${\sim}210$ mbsf by gamma ray attenuatio n (GRA) bulk density, moisture and density (MAD) bulk density, and NGR average values. Bulk density increases from 1.73 to $2.59~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ (GRA) and from 1.89 to $2.85~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ (MAD), and NG R decreases from 8.68 to 3.20 counts/s across the sediment/basement interface. Intervals of low M S and point magnetic susceptibility (MSP) values appear to correlate with intervals of highly fragmented basalt, and higher values $\mathord{\sim}1000$ to ${\sim}3000~\mathrm{SI}\,\times\,10^{-5}$ for both instruments) appear to b e associated with intervals of coherent (length ${>}20\,\mathsf{c m}$ ) basalt core pieces. These trends are consistent with GRA bulk density and NGR measurements from the same intervals. However, anomalously high MS/MSP and NGR values in a rubbly zone appear to correspond to a shift from high t o low $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ concentrations in the volcanic sequence at ${\sim}270$ mbsf.  

# 5.2. Site U1576  

# 5.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1576 (proposed Site VB-14A) is located on the middle west flank of Valdivia Bank, the broa d oceanic plateau that is part of Walvis Ridge (Figures F1, F18). The site was chosen to obtain samples from midflank igneous basement, buried by several hundred meters of sediment, in a locatio n that can only be sampled by drilling (Figures F19, F20). Valdivia Bank represents a poorly understood edifice of Walvis Ridge that may have formed by interaction of a mantle plume with the MidAtlantic Ridge or a microplate formed by a plate boundary reorganization. Radiometric age datin g is planned to determine the age of the igneous basement at this site. Along with other drill sit e sampling of Valdivia Bank, age dating will enable us to test whether there is a north–south ag e progression, as predicted by hotspot models, or an east–west age progression, as predicted b y plume-ridge interaction models. The petrology and geochemistry of the basement basalt sample s should elucidate the petrogenesis and mantle sources of these magmas, including whether the isotopic zonation observed at the DSDP Leg 74 transect, a few hundred kilometers to the southwest, continues to Valdivia Bank. Paleomagnetic data from sediment and basalt samples will help determine the paleolatitude of the hotspot during the Late Cretaceous. Sediments recovered at Sit e

# 5.2.2. Operations  

Two holes were drilled at Site U1576 (Table T1). Hole U1576A is located at $24^{\circ}35.7520^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $5^{\circ}7.3163^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $3032.3\;\mathrm{m}$ as obtained from the PDR. In Hole U1576A, we used th e RCB coring system to advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 398.1 mbsf and recovered 309. 3 $\mathrm{m}\ (78\%)$ of sediment and igneous rock. After attempts to clear a plug in the outer core barrel an d bit at the bottom of the hole failed, it was decided to abandon Hole U1576A and offset the drillin g $400~\mathrm{m}$ along the site survey seismic line at an orientation of $95^{\circ}$ (Figure F19) to start a new hol e (U1576B). The total time spent on Hole U1576A was $76.25\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 3.2 days. In Hole U1576B, locate d at $24^{\circ}35.7711^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $5^{\circ}7.5513^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $3027.2\:\mathrm{m}$ as obtained from the PDR, we first drille d without recovery from the seafloor to 365.0 mbsf. The RCB coring system was then deployed t o advance from 365.0 mbsf to a final depth of 450.3 mbsf with a recovery of $66.3\mathrm{~m~}(78\%)$ of sedimentary and igneous rock. Coring was terminated early to complete the remaining major objectives of the expedition. In total, Holes U1576A and U1576B penetrated $17.9\textrm{m}$ and $64.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ o f igneous basement, respectively. The total time spent on Hole U1576B was $78.75~\mathrm{h}$ , or 3.3 days. Overall, we spent $155.0\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 6.5 days, at Site U1576.  

# 5.2.3. Principal results  

# 5.2.3.1. Sedimentology  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1576 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units. It consist s of a ${\sim}380\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of ooze and chalk on top of a volcanic basement (Figure F21) and si x intercalations of chalk in the volcanic basement for an additional cumulated sediment thickness o f ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figure F22). Two holes were drilled at Site U1576. Hole U1576A recovered the sedimentary cover from 0 to 380.18 mbsf. Hole U1576B recovered the lower ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ of this sedimentar y cover from $365.00\$ to 380.18 mbsf and then six sedimentary intervals in the volcanic basement t o 441.36 mbsf (Figure F22). Excellent lithostratigraphic correlation was found in the lower ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}$ o f the sedimentary cover retrieved in the two holes. The sedimentary cover is divided into four mai n lithostratigraphic units of ooze (Lithostratigraphic Unit I) and chalk (Units II–IV) that wer e deposited on top of the volcanic basement between the Pleistocene and early Campanian. Drillin g disturbance is present throughout the ooze of Unit I but is commonly restricted to the outermos t edges of the cores with uparching of the bedding (i.e., beds form an inverted U). Increased consolidation in the chalk of Units II–IV allowed better preservation of sedimentary detail with onl y local biscuiting and minor uparching of the bedding. Core recovery ranges from ${\sim}75\%$ in Unit  I $(0{-}96.83~\mathrm{mbsf})$ to $\mathord{\sim}89\%$ in Unit II (96.83–124.71 mbsf) and Unit III (124.71–322.19 mbsf) an d ${\sim}52\%$ in Unit IV (Hole $\mathrm{U1576A}=322.19{-}380.18~\mathrm{mb}$ sf; Hole $\mathrm{U1576B}=365.00{-}385.28\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ .  

Unit I is a $96.83\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of unconsolidated nannofossil-foraminifera ooze and nannofossil ooze with foraminifera, locally with clay and minor radiolarians, that records pelagic sedimentation between the Pleistocene and middle Miocene. Three subunits were defined in Unit  I based on a distinct brownish color correlated with minor changes in clay content. The lowe r boundary of the unit is marked by a sharp contact with brown-pink calcareous ooze/chalk wit h clay in Unit II.

Unit II represents a ${\sim}28\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of unconsolidated to consolidated pale brown to brow n foraminifera-nannofossil ooze/chalk with clay and minor radiolarians that records pelagic sedimentation during the Paleocene. The base of the unit corresponds to the occurrence of a distinctive ferromanganese crust at the top of Unit III, which likely represents a significant reduction o r pause in ooze accumulation very close to or at the Cretaceous/Paleogene $(\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{Pg})$ boundary. Unit I I is almost exclusively composed of layered, slightly to heavily burrowed foraminifera-nannofossi l ooze/chalk with clay with regular color changes that form approximately $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ thick cycle s with more prominent burrowing in the darker intervals. A minor fraction (volume $=<1\%$ ) of th e unit consists of partly disaggregated layers and beds of well-sorted foraminifera to volcanic sand, of which the nature and origin(s) remain poorly constrained due to drilling disturbance. Thes e beds could represent winnowing of the ooze by bottom currents as well as volcaniclastic deposition by turbidites and/or tephra fallout.  

Unit III consists of a $\mathord{\sim}197\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sedimentary succession predominantly composed of welldefined cyclical white and reddish brown or greenish gray foraminifera-nannofossil chalk wit h clay that records pelagic sedimentation between the Maastrichtian and the Campanian. Two subunits (IIIA and IIIB) were defined in Unit III based on progressive attenuation of reddish brow n coloring of the chalk and its replacement by a greenish gray color, which may correspond to  a transition from predominantly oxidative to predominantly reducing conditions on the seafloo r starting at ${\sim}275$ mbsf (approximately middle Campanian). The base of the unit is marked b y almost complete attenuation/replacement of the reddish brown color downhole and the firs t appearance of thin centimeter-sized bands of dark green siliceous chalk in Unit IV. Similar to Uni t II, the chalk of Unit III is interbedded or mingled with sparse volcanic to calcareous sand. Thes e are commonly laminated and normally graded and are considered to represent infrequent botto m and/or turbidity currents. Unit III is also characterized by sparse, thin layers of altered ash that ar e interpreted as distal tephra deposits preserved during periods of low sedimentation and/or bioturbation in the pelagic sediment.

Figure F21. Lithostratigraphic summary, Hole U1576A.  

Unit IV is a ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{m}$ (Hole U1576B; 365.00–385.28 mbsf) to ${\sim}58~\mathrm{m}$ (Hole U1576A; 322.19–380.1 8 mbsf) thick sedimentary sequence that is predominantly composed of light green to darker gra y foraminifera-nannofossil chalk with clay and locally faint nuances of pinkish gray intervals. Simila r to Subunit IIIB, the chalk represents pelagic sedimentation in anoxic conditions during the earl y Campanian, possibly reflecting cyclical sedimentation. Calcareous and volcanic sandy deposit s similar to those observed in Units II and III become slightly more important in Unit IV, formin g $5\%$ of the recovered sediment. The lower boundary of Unit IV corresponds to the inferred (i.e., no t recovered) contact with the underlying igneous succession (Unit V) in Holes U1576A an d U1576B. The correlation of Unit IV between Holes U1576A and U1576B is further established b y the occurrence of a ${\sim}1.61\;\mathrm{m}$ thick matrix-supported calcareous conglomeratic deposit that define s a clear stratigraphic marker $\mathord{\sim}18.2$ and $16.0\;\mathrm{m}$ above the igneous basement in Holes U1576A an d U1576B, respectively. This lithology and other calcareous clastic deposits record a turbidite-ric h interval in Unit IV. Tilted beds observed in Unit IV usually show low apparent dip angles of les s than $10^{\circ}$ . Apparent angles of up to ${\sim}55^{\circ}$ are occasionally present close to the sediment/basemen t contact.  

Seven sedimentary interbeds (S1–S7) of variable thickness $\langle{\sim}0.8{-}11.7\ \mathrm{m}\rangle$ ) recovered as intercalations within the volcanic basement in Hole U1576B are a downhole continuation of the lithologies retrieved in the lower sedimentary cover above the uppermost basalt lava (Unit IV). Sedimentation is similarly dominated by pelagic deposition of gray bioturbated foraminiferanannofossil chalk with clay with thin interbeds of calcareous to volcaniclastic turbidites. Locally, lava-sediment interaction led to formation of peperites and hydrothermal alteration of both basal t and sediment. A submeter interval of metalliferous sedimentation occurs at ${\sim}420$ mbsf betwee n lavas, which similarly suggests nearby synvolcanic hydrothermal activity on the seafloor. Interval s of significant deformation were found in two sediment interbeds. Healed fractures and tilted beddings show various dipping angles. Both normal and reversed faults occur. Deformation structure s include conjugate normal faults as well as en echelon and downward splaying normal faults.

# 5.2.3.2. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Igneous rocks were recovered from Holes U1576A and U1576B. The igneous basement at Sit e U1576 represents Lithostratigraphic Unit V in the overall subseafloor succession, and the tw o holes are stratigraphically correlated (Figure F22). Hole U1576A penetrated $12.62\textrm{m}$ of igneou s basement, recovering $7.56\:\mathrm{m}$ $(\sim\!60\%)$ , and consists entirely of basalt. Two igneous units are identified in Hole U1576A (Figure F22). The first unit is a sheet flow $\left(1.97\,\textrm{m}\right)$ , and the second uni t consists of pillow basalt, in which the hole terminates at $10.65\;\mathrm{m}$ cored thickness. The lavas rang e from glassy and aphanitic to holocrystalline and intersertal. Fresh glass is present in the pillo w sequence and on the tops of some sheet flows. The lavas are slightly vesicular with small $(\sim\!1\;\mathrm{mm})$ round vesicles and range from aphyric to highly phyric (plagioclase $=9\%{-}12\%$ ; clinopyroxene $=$ $6\%-8\%$ . Hole U1576B penetrated $64.9~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement, recovering $51.48\mathrm{~m~}(\mathrm{{\sim}}79\%),$ , consisting of $32.79\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt and $18.69\;\mathrm{m}$ of intercalated chalk and turbidite horizons (Figure F22). Hole U1576B terminates within a sheet flow with a minimum thickness of $2.56~\mathrm{m}$ . A total of 1 1 igneous units were identified in Hole U1576B, comprising pillow, sheet, and massive lava flows, with cumulative total drilled thicknesses of 18.16, 2.56, and $20.02\textrm{m}$ , respectively (Figure F22). The top basaltic unit consists of completely altered pillow basalt lava flows that correlate to th e pillow basalts at the base of Hole U1576A. Igneous Units 1–3 (pillow lava flows) and 4–5 (massiv e lava flows) represent aphyric basalts with plagioclase microphenocrysts occurring occasionally. Units 6–11 (one massive flow, one sheet flow, and several pillow basalt flows) are sparsely plagioclase $\pm$ clinopyroxene phyric $(2\%-4\%$ total phenocrysts). Massive and sheet flows contain bot h plagioclase and clinopyroxene glomerocrysts and phenocrysts in an intersertal groundmass, showing higher phenocryst abundances $(8\%)$ in the center of the flows. Seriate textures are common in massive lava interiors, whereas clear porphyritic textures are found closer to flow boundaries. Pillow lavas contain plagioclase and clinopyroxene microlites and small glomerocrysts i n their glassy rims. Olivine occurs infrequently $(<\!1\%)$ and is completely altered. Fresh glass is present at some flow margins, but it is mostly altered and replaced by clay minerals. The lavas ar e dominantly nonvesicular to slightly vesicular, except for the pillow lavas of Unit 2, which are moderately to highly vesicular with vesicles filled by secondary minerals. Alteration in the basalt lav a successions in both holes at Site U1576 is significant and pervasive at the tops and bottoms of lav a flows and throughout the interiors of small flows; only the larger massive flow cores contain nearfresh igneous minerals. Chemically reduced hydrothermal fluids dominated alteration processes, which caused a pale green discoloration and formation of secondary pyrite in vesicles and in th e groundmass. This alteration is distinctive from the pale reddish tan color associated with the oxidative alteration at Site U1575. Alteration-derived veins that crosscut each other are commo n within the recovered volcanic sequence, indicating multiple phases of hydrothermal fluid percolation.  

# 5.2.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Detailed calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera biostratigraphy was performed on 3 9 and 16 core catcher samples, respectively, from the continuous sediment successions of Hole s U1576A and U1576B. Five additional core catchers were analyzed for calcareous nannofossil s from the interbedded sediments recovered from Hole U1576B. Core catcher samples were analyzed for FO and LO datums, which were based on Gradstein et al. (2012, 2020). Nannofossil an d foraminifera datums showed good agreement throughout the cored sediment sequence. Biostratigraphic analysis revealed a succession of Pleistocene through lower Miocene (Lithostratigraphi c Subunits IA–IC) sediments that is likely incomplete. Additional analysis of these units is require d to determine where and how much time is encompassed within the potential hiatuses. A larg e hiatus/unconformity is observed between the oldest Miocene sediments (Langhian) in Sectio n 391-U1576A-10R-CC and lower Paleocene (Danian) sediments in Section 11R-CC, suggestin g that the Lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary corresponds to a major, ${\sim}45$ My hiatus in the uppe r part of the Hole U1576A sediment succession, with both the Oligocene and Eocene missing fro m retrieved cores. Sediments recovered below the unconformity revealed an apparent continuou s section from the lower Paleocene (Danian) through the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian/ Campanian). This succession likely contains the $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary and will be closely analyzed postexpedition to determine its exact placement within the cored sequence. The lower part of the sediments provided a maximum early Campanian basement age of approximately $79.00{-}81.38\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Interbedded sediments recovered from Hole U1576B revealed only Campanian ages. These interbeds likely represent an older continued succession of the basement interval recovered from Hol e U1576A, with most samples assigned to lower Campanian biozones.  

# 5.2.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Cores 391-U1576A-1R through 10R are primarily composed of weakly magnetic (ranging $10^{-6}$ t o $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m})$ unconsolidated calcareous nannofossil ooze. As such, both the SRM and JR-6A spinne r magnetometer failed to produce reliable directions, and no magnetostratigraphy could be determined for this interval. Lithified sediments were recovered from Cores 391-U1576A-11R throug h 39R and Sections 391-U1576B-2R-1 through 5R-3. These lithified sediments have stronger magnetizations (ranging $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}\,\,\mathrm{A/m})$ and produced higher quality magnetic measurements, which permitted development of a robust magnetostratigraphy for these intervals. Demagnetizations carried out on discrete samples agree well with section-half measurements and suggest tha t magnetization is carried by a mixture of magnetite and hematite. For Hole U1576A, we identifie d 14 polarity chrons that span from the Danian (Chron 26r in Core 11R) to the early Campania n (Chron 33r near the contact with igneous basement). We assigned polarity chrons for sedimentar y cores from Hole U1576B that were consistent with polarity chrons from Hole U1576A. Section s 391-U1576B-2R-1 through 4R-2 are of normal polarity and are consistent with normal Chron $33\mathrm{n}$ . These are underlain by sedimentary Sections 5R-1 through 5R-3, which make contact with th e basement and exhibit reversed polarity consistent with Chron 33r. No major gaps were identifie d in the magnetostratigraphy in the Paleocene and older sediments.  

Igneous rocks recovered from Site U1576 span Cores 391-U1576A-40R through 41R and 391- U1576B-5R through 17R. These cores consist of basalts with interbedded chalk between flows. Some of the basalts are considerably altered, particularly close to contacts with sediment interbeds, changing their magnetic characteristics. Magnetic intensities range $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ in th e sediment interbeds and heavily altered basalt and $1{-}10\,\mathrm{A/m}$ in the mostly unaltered basaltic sections. Nearly all igneous cores display a reversed polarity magnetization after AF cleaning to 2 0 mT, which is compatible with the reversed polarity chron assignment of Chron 33r observed at th e top of the igneous basement. Most of the igneous rocks are characterized by unblocking temperatures between $200^{\circ}$ and $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and median destructive field values around $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The large rang e of magnetization unblocking temperatures is most likely related to the presence of titanomagnetite with varying Ti concentrations.  

# 5.2.3.5. Geochemistry  

At Site U1576, IW samples from Hole U1576A were analyzed for ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , alkalinity, and concentrations of major cations, anions, and trace elements. Both alkalinity and pH peak at 230–250 mbsf i n Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIA. Across the entire sedimentary succession, we observe linea r increases in calcium and lithium concentrations and linear decreases in magnesium and potassium concentrations. Two maxima of silicon concentration, near the top of the sediment and at th e bottom of the sediment succession, are attributable to dissolution of biogenic silica and volcani c sands, respectively. A broad manganese peak found in Unit I through the upper part of Subuni t IIIA indicates the presence of a manganese reduction interval in the upper part of the sedimen t succession. A sulfate reduction interval is also observed in Unit I through the upper part of Subunit IIIA. We observe the phosphate maximum at 1.8 mbsf with a narrow peak in Subunits IA an d IB. The ammonium concentration is consistent across the entire sediment depth. In general, I W geochemistry at Site U1576 is affected by diagenetic processes of calcite, silica, and organic matter, as well as interactions of interstitial waters with volcanic basement and volcanic sands. Sedimen t samples were also analyzed for $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ total carbon, and total organic carbon contents. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content remains high across Subunits IA–IIIA and declines in Subunit IIIB and Unit IV as th e content of clay increases. Methane concentrations measured from the headspace gas are lowe r than the atmospheric background level of $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{L}$ .  

At Site U1576, 2 samples from Hole U1576A and 10 samples from Hole U1576B were analyze d using ICP-AES on powders and pXRF on 59 archive-half section pieces of the recovered cores fo r the determination of major and trace elements. Even though the least altered recovered sections o f the distinct lithologies were analyzed, several samples were affected by varying degrees of alteration, as demonstrated by scattered concentration data of fluid-mobile elements (e.g., K). The analyzed rocks are all subalkaline and range from basalt to basaltic andesite. The Ti-V composition o f all samples from Site U1576 is similar to MORBs and ridge-centered ocean island basalts. Interestingly, V and $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ are well correlated at Sites U1575 and U1576, but the trend is shifted, and Sit e U1576 has a slightly lower V concentration at a given Ti content. On bivariate diagrams with Mg O versus the other major oxides and trace elements, the Site U1576 rocks generally lie within th e compositional array of the previously reported dredge and DSDP site samples from Walvis Ridge. Two igneous units are distinguished in Hole U1576A, and 11 are distinguished in Hole U1576B. Based on the lithology and geochemical composition, the second unit of Hole U1576A and firs t unit of Hole U1576B appear to be indistinguishable; they most likely represent the same pillo w lava flow stack. Therefore, 12 distinct igneous units are present within the combined volcanic succession at Site U1576. Geochemical downhole variation using pXRF and ICP-AES analysis show s that all lavas in both holes at Site U1576 have high $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ concentration, unlike Site U1575, whic h contains lavas with both high and low $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ contents.  

# 5.2.3.6. Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were made on 93 cores from Holes U1576A and U1576B. NGR, MS/MSP, GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, porosity, and thermal conductivity measurement s reveal a relatively simple succession of sedimentary and volcanic units in Hole U1576A: calcareou s ooze grading into more cohesive chalk and limestone from the seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}380$ mbsf and relativel y altered basalt flows and pillows to the bottom of the hole at $\mathord{\sim}392$ mbsf. In Hole U1576B, the sam e suite of measurements recorded a more complex sequence of interbedded sediment and basal t units below the initial sediment/basement contact at ${\sim}385$ mbsf to the bottom of the hole at ${\sim}451$ mbsf. Localized features within the sedimentary and volcanic intervals of both holes are als o reflected by physical properties data sets, specifically NGR and MS/MSP. In Hole U1576A, th e highest MS $(325\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}]$ ) recorded in the sediment interval correlates to a ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick volcaniclastic deposit at ${\sim}135$ mbsf (Section 15R-1), and at the same depth, NGR abruptly increases t o 22.2 counts/s from a background range of ${\sim}6{-}8.5$ counts/s. Other MS and NGR peaks within th e sediment interval each correlate to a ${\sim}2\;\mathrm{cm}$ volcaniclastic layer at ${\sim}98$ mbsf $(\mathrm{MS}=150\times10^{-5}$ SI; $\mathrm{NGR}=10.1$ counts/s; Section 11R-3) and ${\sim}123$ mbsf $(\mathrm{MS}=145\times10^{-5}$ SI; $\mathrm{NGR}=18.8$ counts/s; Section 13R-6). In Hole U1576A, peaks in NGR, MS, and Section Half Multisensor Logge r (SHMSL) logs align with discrete turbidite or altered tuff layers from ${\sim}95$ to 280 mbsf, and all thre e data sets display a broad cyclical trend over the same interval. In Hole U1576B, MS values ar e uniformly low in the upper chalk layer and interbedded limestones, with an overall mean value o f $15.8\,\pm\,24.8\,\times\,10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI},$ , but NGR counts in interbedded chalk and limestone below the uppermos t sediment/basalt contact increase with depth from 4.31 counts/s at 387 mbsf to 30.2 counts/s a t 441 mbsf. Basalt layers in Hole U1576B show an increase in MS to an overall mean of $986\pm171\times$ $10^{-5}$ SI. Relatively high NGR and MS/MSP values in Hole U1576B may be related to pervasiv e alteration in interbedded sedimentary and basalt units. Similar trends in MS and GRA bulk density values at $\mathord{\sim}371$ mbsf $\mathrm{MS}=8.55\times10^{-5}$ SI; $\mathrm{NGR}=18.5$ counts/s) in Hole U1576A and at ${\sim}374$ mbsf $(\mathrm{MS}\,=\,8.84\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI; $\mathrm{NGR}\,=\,18.8$ counts/s) in Hole U1576B correlate to a volcaniclasti c deposit at the same depth in each hole. This correlation suggests that Holes U1576A and U1576 B may sample a common stratigraphic sequence from the seafloor to ${\sim}451$ mbsf.  

# 5.3. Site U1577  

# 5.3.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1577 (proposed Site VB-13A) is located on the extreme eastern flank of Valdivia Bank as  a complement to Sites U1575 and U1576 on the western and northern sides of the edifice, respectively (Figures F1, F23). The site was selected to recover igneous basement samples from a burie d part of the plateau to understand its geologic and geochemical evolution in a location that can onl y be sampled by drilling (Figure F24). Samples from Site U1577 will help determine whether th e isotopic zonation, observed several hundred kilometers farther southwest in the TGW hotspo t track, is found at Valdivia Bank. Geochronology studies of basalts from Site U1577, along wit h those from other Valdivia Bank sites, will constrain the temporal evolution of the plateau. Specifically, is there a north–south age progression, as predicted by hotspot models, or is the progressio n east–west, as predicted by plume-ridge interaction? Paleomagnetic studies of Site U1577 basalt s will add to those from other sites to examine the paleolatitude of the hotspot during the Late Cretaceous. Studies of the sedimentary overburden will add to those from previous sites to understand the sedimentary and paleoenvironmental history of Valdivia Bank.  

# 5.3.2. Operations  

A single hole was drilled at Site U1577 (Table T1). Hole U1577A is located at $25^{\circ}12.1439^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $7^{\circ}29.8140^{\prime}\mathrm{E},$ , at a water depth of $3940.2\:\mathrm{m}$ as obtained from the PDR. In Hole U1577A, we used th e RCB coring system to advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 193.9 mbsf and recovered 152. 9 $\mathrm{m}\left(79\%\right)$ of sediment and igneous rock. In total, Hole U1577A penetrated $39.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. Coring was terminated early to complete the remaining major objectives of the expedition. The total time spent on Hole U1577A was $109.5\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 4.6 days.  

# 5.3.3. Principal results  

# 5.3.3.1. Sedimentology  

The sedimentary deposits at Site U1577 are divided into three lithostratigraphic units that rang e in age from the Paleocene (Thanetian) to Upper Cretaceous (latest Santonian). The sediment s consist of a ${\sim}155\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession of nannofossil ooze and chalk with variable contents of cla y and volcanic tephra (Figure F25). This sedimentary succession overlies the igneous basement, which consists of three massive lava flows (4, 12, and $19\,\mathrm{m}$ thick) devoid of sedimentary intercalation or infillings (Figure F26). The lithostratigraphic division was defined based on macroscopi c and microscopic lithologic observations supplemented with changes in NGR and biostratigraphi c data. Three units of pelagic sediment with a minor component of tephra layers were define d (Lithostratigraphic Units I–III) (Figure F25). Sediment consolidation increases gradually downhole, with ooze dominant in Unit I and chalk dominant in Units II and III. Drilling disturbanc e occurs throughout the ooze of Unit I where the cores commonly display uparching of the beddin g (i.e., beds form an inverted U). The increased consolidation in the sediment deeper in the hol e offers better preservation of sedimentary detail, with disturbance limited to less consolidate d intervals where localized biscuiting and minor uparching of the bedding occur. Consistent wit h the increase in sediment consolidation downhole, core recovery is ${\sim}69\%$ in Unit I (0–46.90 mbsf), ${\sim}90\%$ in Unit II (46.90–70.72 mbsf), and ${\sim}82\%$ in Unit III (70.72–154.80 mbsf).

Contours are plotted at $50\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals and labeled in kilometers. Blue line $=$ Seismic Line TN373-VB05, heavy blue line $=$ portion of the seismic line shown in Figure F24.  

Unit I is a $46.90\;\mathrm{m}$ thick Paleocene succession of unconsolidated pale brown to white bioturbate d nannofossil ooze with clay. It is irregularly interbedded with minor, brown, altered volcanic as h layers containing sparse crystals of feldspar, biotite, and amphibole. A marked decrease in cla y content and tephra abundance occurs between ${\sim}11$ and 24 mbsf, producing an interval of distinctively lighter sediment. The more clayey ooze intervals at the top and bottom of the unit displa y light brown to brown $10{-}50\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick cycles, and the lowest 3 to $4\,\mathrm{m}$ have an increasingly pink hu e and show ferromanganese layers disaggregated by drilling. Because tephra changes reflect phase s of increased volcanic input rather than changes in background pelagic sedimentation, they wer e not used for stratigraphic division. Instead, the lower boundary of the unit was based on paleontological data supporting a transition to Upper Cretaceous microfossil assemblages in th e underlying units.  

Unit II is a ${\sim}23.82\mathrm{~m~}$ thick (46.90–70.72 mbsf) Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) succession o f slightly to heavily burrowed pinkish brown to pale brown clayey nannofossil ooze to chalk wit h minor interbeds of brown to gray ash to tuff, both of which are commonly altered. The $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary, which is assumed to form the boundary between Units I and II, was not recovered. Uni t II differs from Unit I in that clay content (i.e., brown color) remains high throughout. In addition, Unit II lacks the black ferromanganese layers seen in the lower part of Unit I, and it records th e first appearance of inoceramid shell fragments downhole. The pelagic sediment of Unit II is characterized by cyclical changes in color at a $10{-}60~\mathrm{cm}$ scale that most likely correspond to fluctuation in the relative abundance of clays and Fe oxides relative to carbonates. At least 20 layers o f typically well-defined, brown to dark brown, graded and/or bioturbated tephra occur throughout. The lower boundary of Unit II is taken as the base of the lowermost graded tephra layer, belo w which both biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data suggest a stratigraphic gap or period o f reduced sedimentation of ${\sim}3$ My.

Unit III represents over half $(84.08\;\mathrm{m})$ of the sedimentary cover (70.72–154.80 mbsf). It is a Campanian to possibly latest Santonian succession of bioturbated clayey nannofossil chalk with intermittent, commonly burrowed graded tephra interbeds. Overall, Unit III represents a long duratio n of seafloor pelagic sedimentation interspersed with tephra input of differing types. Changes i n color at a $10{-}60~\mathrm{cm}$ scale, similar to those observed in Unit II, are locally recognized in Unit III, but these are more commonly obscured by irregular occurrences of slightly to extensively bioturbated tephra layers. Unit III is further divided into three subunits (IIIA–IIIC) based on color variation (pinkish to green) that reflects clear variations in the overall preserved oxidation state in th e chalk and also based on attendant changes in the abundance and type of tephra deposits. Subuni t IIIA is a $22\,\mathrm{m}$ thick succession $(70.72{-}92.23\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ dominated by pinkish brown chalk with mino r gray tephra layers typically $<\!5\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick. Subunit IIIB is a ${\sim}41\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession (92.23–133.5 3 mbsf) dominated by greenish gray chalk with slightly more abundant black tephra layers (\~5–1 5 cm thick). Finally, Subunit IIIB is a $21\textbf{m}$ thick succession (133.53–154.80 mbsf) dominated b y pinkish brown chalk with fewer intervals of gray, brown, and black tephra layers (also ${\sim}5{-}15~\mathrm{cm}$ thick). Rare ${<}15~\mathrm{cm}$ thick layers of hyaloclastite appear toward the base of the unit closer to th e contact with underlying volcanic basement. This contact is marked by the top of a massive lav a overlain by a $0.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick layer of altered hyaloclastite and bioturbated clayey nannofossil chalk.

Figure F25. Lithostratigraphic summary, Site U1577.  

As previously observed in the sedimentary cover at Site U1576, Unit III at Site U1577 preserves  a detailed record of changes in paleoenvironment at Valdivia Bank (e.g., either cyclical patterns an d possible anoxic versus oxic seafloor conditions or depositional diagenesis) for the Campanian an d Maastrichtian.  

# 5.3.3.2. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Hole U1577A penetrated $39.1~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement, recovering $28.0~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous rocks $(80\%)$ representing Lithostratigraphic Unit IV in the overall subseafloor succession (Figure F26). Hol e U1577A terminates within a massive basalt flow with a minimum thickness of $19.07\textrm{m}$ . Igneou s basement was intersected in Sections 391-U1577A-18R-1 through 26R-1. The volcanic successio n consists of a single unit (Igneous Unit 1) made up of highly phyric basalt that is divided into thre e subunits (i.e., massive lava flows) based on features which identify flow boundaries (Figure F26). All igneous subunits are porphyritic; the groundmass texture grades to aphanitic adjacent to flo w boundaries. The uppermost subunit contains a glassy rim in contact with the overlying pelagi c sediment. The phenocryst concentrations are $\mathord{\sim}18\%$ in the massive flows, with $\mathord{\sim}15\%$ plagioclase, $2\%{-}5\%$ pyroxene, and $0\%{-3\%}$ olivine. The lavas are slightly vesicular and contain round vesicle s that are $1{-}2\ \mathrm{mm}$ in diameter and filled with at least one secondary mineral (e.g., clay, calcite, and/or zeolite). The groundmass in flow interiors consists of fine- to medium-grained clinopyroxene and plagioclase in subophitic textures, often showing late-stage crystallization after olivine and plagioclase. In flow interiors, the groundmass has a seriate texture and coarse crystal siz e distribution that approaches that of the phenocrysts. Mesostasis (quenched melt) forms irregula r globules that consist of microcrystalline plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides. The flo w margins consist of plagioclase-clinopyroxene-olivine phyric basalt. Plagioclase is still the dominant phenocryst phase in the form of similarly blocky or tabular glomerocrysts (up to $2.4~\mathrm{mm}$ i n size) but with much lower abundance than in flow interiors $(\sim\!5\%)$ . Olivine (typically altered t o saponite) and clinopyroxene are less common and form small anhedral grains (up to $0.6\:\mathrm{mm}$ ). Th e groundmass in samples from flow margins is markedly distinct from flow interiors; plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti-oxides are very fine grained, showing intergranular textures. Plagioclas e forms small needle-like skeletal crystals $(<\!0.4\,\mathrm{\mm})$ , whereas clinopyroxene $(<\!0.08\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\mm}})$ form s small blocky crystals. There is no seriate gradation in size, as seen in the flow interiors. Mesostasi s forms distinct regions with microcrystalline textures. Secondary minerals are relatively scarce, bu t those that do occur are disseminated as limited peripheral alteration or oxidative films aroun d crystals, and these changes impart minor color variations from the unaltered blue-gray flow interiors to a light brown hue. Oxidative changes also occur as discolored halos extending $2{-}4~\mathsf{c m}$ away from calcite- and Fe oxyhydroxide–filled fractures and veins.

# 5.3.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera biostratigraphy were performed on cor e catcher sections from Hole U1577A. Nannofossil analysis included 15 core catcher samples an d two toothpick samples, and foraminifera analysis included seven core catcher samples. Foraminifera sample processing was difficult, limiting the number of samples analyzed in the time availabl e for this hole. Planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossil ages show good agreemen t throughout the hole.  

Notably, Section 391-U1577A-1R-CC recovered sediments that were late Paleocene (Thanetian; ${\sim}58.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). Therefore, the shallowest possible sample (i.e., the mudline) was examined to determine whether this age also corresponds to the top of the sequence or a thin layer of younger sediment was present. Investigation of the mudline revealed sediments with a maximum age of lates t Pleistocene, indicating present-day sedimentation is not below the carbonate compensatio n depth. This likely indicates a long persistent erosional surface at this site; thus, a major unconformity exists between sediments younger than ${\sim}0.43\mathrm{~Ma}$ and the latest Paleocene-aged sediment s recovered in Core 1R. Additional samples from this core will be analyzed postexpedition to identify the precise location of this unconformity. A nearly continuous succession of upper Paleocen e (Thanetian) to Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) sediment was recovered in Sections 1R-C C through 17R-CC. An apparent unconformity was discovered between Sections 7R-CC and 8R-CC, spanning the Maastrichtian/Campanian boundary and encompassing a time gap of about $5.6\;\mathrm{My}$ between $\mathord{\sim}69.0$ and $74.6\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . This observation is corroborated by NGR data measured on wholeround sections and magnetostratigraphic data. Higher resolution sampling through Core 8R i s required to identify the true range of missing time due to this unconformity.  

The age of the oldest sediment in Hole U1577A is unclear. Foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils do not record Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) marker taxa. However, paleomagnetic dat a indicate that the interval of the Cretaceous Normal Superchron was intersected (possibly in Section 17R-3), which is considered to be the boundary between the Campanian and Santonian stage s of the Upper Cretaceous. In Section 17R-CC, foraminifera and nannofossils agree on an earl y Campanian age from ${\sim}79.00$ to 81.38 Ma. However, the poor preservation of planktonic foraminifera limited the complete evaluation of the assemblage. A toothpick sample was taken from jus t above the sediment/basement contact, but confident Santonian markers were not observed. Las t occurrences of foraminifera markers Dicarinella asymetrica, Dicarinella concavata, and Sigali a deflaensis coincide with the Santonian/Campanian boundary $(83.64\,\mathrm{Ma})$ (Gradstein et al., 2012).  

# 5.3.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Sedimentary Cores 391-U1577A-1R through 18R are mostly made up of partially to fully consolidated clay and chalk. Archive-half sections and discrete samples were analyzed using the SRM an d JR-6A spinner magnetometer, respectively. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) values fo r sediments range $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . Most sediments have median destructive fields ranging 10–3 0 mT. Thermal demagnetization spectra of sediment specimens often revealed slow unblocking o f magnetization in the $200^{\circ}{-}400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ range, with a sharper drop in magnetic moment close to $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (the Curie temperature of magnetite). This demagnetization behavior suggests that the dominan t magnetization carriers in sediments from Hole U1577A are likely a mixture of titanomagnetit e with varying Ti concentrations and magnetite. A total of eight polarity chrons were identified i n these sections that cover the Thanetian (late Paleocene; Chron C26n in Core 1R) to the early Santonian (Late Cretaceous; Chron $C34\mathrm{n}$ near the contact with basement). The three major breaks i n the magnetostratigraphy are probably due to poor core recovery or unconformities: (1) betwee n Cores 4R and 5R, where sediment ages jump from Chron C26r to Chron $C28\mathrm{n}$ ; (2) between Core s 5R and 6R, where sediment ages jump from Chron $C28\boldsymbol{\mathrm{n}}$ to Chron $C30\mathrm{n}$ ; and (3) in Section 8R-3, where sediment ages jump from Chron C31r to Chron C33r. All of these gaps are consistent wit h the available biostratigraphic markers for these cores.  

Igneous rocks recovered from Site U1577 span Cores 391-U1577A-18R through 26R. Their NR M values range from slightly below 1 to slightly above $10\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Nearly all igneous cores displayed  a positive polarity magnetization after AF cleaning to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ , which is compatible with the assignment of polarity Chron C34n (Cretaceous Normal Superchron) observed in the sediments abov e the sediment/basalt contact. Occasionally, basalts from sections with large hydrothermal vein s exhibited reversed polarity, which likely reflects secondary remagnetization due to alteration. Most of the igneous rocks had median destructive field values between 5 and $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ and exhibite d a range of thermal demagnetization behaviors. Some igneous specimens exhibited lowe r maximum unblocking temperatures around $200^{\circ}{C_{\iota}}$ , whereas others showed higher unblockin g temperatures near the magnetite Curie temperature of $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The remainder of specimens progressively lost their magnetization between $100^{\circ}$ and $350^{\circ}C$ . This wide range of thermal demagnetization behaviors implies the coexistence of several magnetic phases, including pseudo-singl e domain to multidomain magnetite and titanomagnetite with a large range of Ti concentrations.  

# 5.3.3.5. Geochemistry  

At Site U1577, IW samples were analyzed for ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , alkalinity, and concentrations of major cations, anions, and trace elements. Both alkalinity and pH show narrow ranges except for low alkalinit y and high pH anomalies observed within Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIB. Across the entire sedimentary succession, overall nonlinear increases of calcium and decreases in magnesium ar e observed with low concentration anomalies within Subunit IIIB. A broad peak of potassium concentration is also found in Subunit IIIB, whereas the potassium concentration is uniform in Unit  I through Subunit IIIA. Similar to Site U1576, two maxima of silicon concentration are found at th e top and bottom of the sediment succession, indicating dissolution of biogenic silica and volcani c matters, respectively. A broad manganese peak is identified in Subunit IIIB, coinciding with alkalinity, $\mathsf{p H}$ , calcium, magnesium, and potassium anomalies. We observe an overall decrease of sulfate concentration throughout the entire sediment succession. A narrow phosphate peak is foun d in the upper part of Unit I with a linear increase below this depth. Compared to previous sites, ammonium and phosphate concentrations are significantly lower at Site U1577 with a molar rati o of 1:1. In summary, IW geochemistry at Site U1577 indicates slower diageneses of calcite, silica, and organic matter than at the other Valdivia Bank sites (U1575 and U1576). Sediment sample s were also analyzed for the $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ total carbon, and total organic carbon content. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ conten t declines in Unit III, whereas organic carbon content is relatively consistent in the overall sedimentary sequence. Methane concentrations measured from the headspace gas are lower than th e atmospheric background level of $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{L}$ .  

Three igneous subunits of massive lava flows consisting of highly phyric basalt were recovered a t Site U1577. Seven samples were analyzed for major and trace elements using ICP-AES. Additionally, 50 measurements were conducted on archive-half section pieces using pXRF spectrometry. The analyzed samples show a low LOI of ${<}1.35\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ , indicating relatively fresh submarine rocks. Overall, Site U1577 samples are extremely homogeneous, showing limited geochemical variatio n downhole that is less variable in composition than the other Valdivia Bank sites (U1575 an d U1576). Based on the low LOI and homogeneous composition, we conclude that the brownis h discoloration of some samples reflects minor oxidation without significant element mobilization. All samples from Site U1577 are classified as basalts and have a tholeiitic composition. The Ti- V composition of the basalts is similar to the other Valdivia Bank sites and is comparable to MORB s and ridge-centered ocean island basalts. On bivariate diagrams of $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ versus the other major an d trace elements, Site U1577 samples form tight clusters that overlap with previous dredge an d DSDP drill site samples from Walvis Ridge. Consistent with the absence of olivine, olivine-fre e Igneous Subunit 1b is slightly lower in MgO, Mg#, Ni, and $_\mathrm{Cr}$ relative to Subunits 1a and 1c.  

# 5.3.3.6. Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were made on whole-round cores, section halves, and discret e samples from 26 cores recovered from Hole U1577A. A suite of measurements, including NGR, MS/MSP, bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, porosity, and thermal conductivity record two lithostratigraphic breaks: (1) a boundary between calcareous ooze/chalk units at ${\sim}70$ mbsf and (2) th e sediment/basalt contact at ${\sim}155$ mbsf. The first lithostratigraphic boundary, between Lithostratigraphic Unit II and Subunit IIIA, is defined by an abrupt shift from relatively high, wide-rangin g NGR values to a narrower and lower range of values ( $[{\sim}10\$ to ${\sim}16$ counts/s) at ${\sim}70$ mbsf. At th e same depth, NGR observations are correlated to paleomagnetic measurements: remanent magnetism indicates a shift from Chron C31n to Chron C33r and suggests that part of the sedimentar y record is missing. The sediment/basalt contact is clearly imaged at ${\sim}155$ mbsf as an increase i n MS/MSP and bulk density (up to $2709\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ and $2.95~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively) and an accompanying decrease in porosity and NGR counts (as low as $2.73\ \mathrm{vol\%}$ and 4.98 counts/s, respectively). Sediments above the basalt contact have comparably lower MS/MSP and bulk density (up to $647\times$ $10^{-5}$ SI and $2.12\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively) and higher NGR and porosity (up to 31.3 counts/s and 73. 2 $\mathrm{vol\%}$ , respectively). Bulk density, MS/MSP, and NGR values indicate a continuous package of relatively unaltered basalt with no interbedded sediments from ${\sim}155$ mbsf to the bottom of Hol e U1577A at 193.4 mbsf. Physical properties measurements also record lithologic variations withi n the sediment interval that align with observations from previous sites. As in Holes U1576A an d U1576B, higher MS/MSP values (e.g., $647\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ in Section 391-U1577A-8R-3; $\mathord{\sim}71$ mbsf) ar e associated with volcaniclastic deposits within the sediment interval. Additionally, sediment s between ${\sim}80$ and ${\sim}90$ mbsf appear to display cyclic variations in NGR that are similar to cycle s observed in Hole U1576A.  

# 5.4. Site U1578  

# 5.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1578 (proposed Site CT-5A) is the westernmost drilling location for Expedition 391 (Figur e F1), and it is the youngest, with an expected age either in the latest Cretaceous or earliest Paleocene (Figure F5). It is the only Expedition 391 site in the morphologically distinct Guyot Province. It is located on the lower flanks of a Center track guyot where sediments are thin (Figures F27, F28, F29). With ${>}300\ \mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement cored, it is also the deepest basement penetratio n site of Expedition 391. The site was chosen because the erupted lavas are either likely to be a mixture of Tristan- and Gough-type components or to constitute a distinct third isotopic signature.  A major objective for this site was to measure the geochemical composition of samples from a dee p downhole section of lava flows. The geochemistry should offer clues to the magma source an d evolution of the Center track ridge. Although there are already many radiometric dates for Walvi s Ridge seamounts, samples from Site U1578 help fill gaps in prior sampling. The expected age fo r Site U1578 basement is a propitious time for understanding the paleolatitude changes of the TG W hotspot because global paleomagnetic data sets suggest that the paleolatitude for the latest Cretaceous and earliest Paleocene TGW hotspot location was south of its current latitude, implyin g northward motion. In contrast, hotspot drift models imply the opposite sense of motion. Moreover, the sense of motion may be opposite to the Hawaiian hotspot, which would confirm TPW. Although the location of Site U1578 was selected to minimize sediment cover, the sedimentar y sequence is expected to provide insights into paleoceanographic conditions at Walvis Ridg e during the Cenozoic.  

# 5.4.2. Operations  

A single hole was drilled at Site U1578 (Table T1). Hole U1578A is located at $32^{\circ}19.6836^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $0^{\circ}38.5876^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at a water depth of $3793.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ as obtained from the driller’s tag depth. In Hol e U1578A, we used the RCB coring system to advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 486. 4 mbsf and recovered $239.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(49\%)$ of sediment and igneous rock. The total advance in Hol e U1578A required the deployment of two RCB coring bits through a bit change and reentry into th e hole. In total, Hole U1578A penetrated $302.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. The total time spent on Hol e U1578A was $244.0\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 10.2 days.  

# 5.4.3. Principal results  

# 5.4.3.1. Sedimentology  

A $\mathord{\sim}184\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of calcareous pelagic sediment interbedded with volcaniclastic layer s lies on top of the volcanic basement (Figure F30). Two main lithostratigraphic units, the secon d divided into two subunits, were recognized based on macroscopic and microscopic (smear slide, thin section, and scanning electron microscopy) lithologic observations along with changes in MS, NGR, and biostratigraphic data. These overlie the igneous succession, which consists of lav a stacks intercalated with 10 sedimentary interbeds.  

Unit I forms the uppermost $27\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sedimentary cover (Figure F30). It consists of Pleistocen e to Pliocene white to pale brown foraminifera-nannofossil ooze with clay. Significant drilling disturbance occurs throughout due to poor consolidation of this pelagic sediment, but almost complete $(99\%)$ recovery was achieved. A mass transport deposit occurs toward the boundary wit h Unit II in Section 391-U1578A-3R-6. The boundary itself is marked by the appearance of tephr a and a gradual clay increase in the calcareous ooze/chalk downhole, which correlates with a n increase in MS and NGR values and the occurrence of Eocene–Paleocene foraminifera and nannofossil assemblages, indicating a significant stratigraphic gap.  

Unit II is a $\mathord{\sim}157\mathrm{~m}$ thick succession of mostly Paleocene calcareous pelagic sediment with rar e volcaniclastic deposits that becomes progressively more consolidated with depth (Figure F30). Relatively limited $(<\!40\%)$ recovery in this unit probably occurred due to significant heave durin g drilling. Two subunits (IIA and IIB) were defined based on changes in clay content and NGR values. Subunit IIA is early Eocene to Paleocene in age (27.00–135.20 mbsf). It consists of white t o pale pinkish brown nannofossil ooze to chalk with clay and rare radiolarians, siliceous spong e spicules, and small foraminifera. The unit also includes minor (commonly disturbed) interbeds o f light to dark gray tephra with colorless to light brown highly vesicular volcanic glass and pumices. Subunit IIB is Paleocene in age (135.20–184.26 mbsf) and continues to the top of the underlyin g volcanic succession. It consists of light gray to greenish gray clayey nannofossil chalk with rar e radiolarians, siliceous sponge spicules, and small foraminifera. The chalk lithology is darker an d more clayey than that of Subunit IIA, consistent with a gradual increase in NGR in the lower par t of the sedimentary cover. Subunit IIB also includes minor interbeds of dark greenish gray to blac k vitric sandstone/tuff with normal grading that increase in abundance toward the top of the volcanic basement. Volcanic glass shards in the dark sandstone/tuff are fresh to altered with highl y vesicular to pumiceous textures, but they are distinctively browner than the glass shards of Subunit IIA. The texture of the tephra and sedimentary structures of volcaniclastic beds suggest shallow marine and possibly subaerial volcanism with synvolcanic deposition during pelagic fallou t and/or syn- to postvolcanic reworking by turbidity and/or bottom currents.

This sedimentary succession overlies the igneous basement, which consists of 12 igneous units. These units consist of massive flows alternating with thick pillow lava stacks, with rare peperiti c intervals and 10 sedimentary interbeds (Figure F31). These interbeds vary in thickness betwee n approximately $>\!0.5$ and ${>}10\ \mathrm{m}$ and occur down to 416.87 mbsf. They are lithologically similar t o the lowermost sedimentary cover and are composed of clayey nannofossil chalk with volcaniclastic layers. The volcaniclastic deposits typically consist of turbidites with variably altered vitri c clasts. The glass shards are highly vesicular in the uppermost six sedimentary intervals an d become less vesicular in the lower part of the hole.  

# 5.4.3.2. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Hole U1578A penetrated $302.12\,\textrm{m}$ of igneous basement (interval 391-U1578A-20R-1, $46~\mathrm{cm}$ , through 65R-3, $45\;\mathrm{cm}$ ) with $181.26\;\mathrm{m}\;(59.9\%)$ recovery. The igneous basement at Site U1578 represents Lithostratigraphic Unit III in the overall subseafloor succession (Figure F31). Hol e U1578A terminates in a pillow lava unit with a minimum thickness of $67\;\mathrm{m}$ . Twelve igneous unit s were identified in Hole U1578A (Figure F31). They comprise pillow and lobate lava flows, shee t flows, and massive flows with interbedded sediments. The changing eruptive style, changes i n chemistry, and pelagic sediment interbeds suggest episodic volcanic activity. The uppermost $96\;\mathrm{m}$ of the succession consists largely of sheet and massive flows intercalated with volcanic sands an d silts; pillow lava flows are present in thin sequences. One massive flow is distinguished by a zon e of olivine accumulation in the lowermost $^{1\,}\mathbf{m}$ , with up to $25\%$ modal olivine. Below that, the dominant unit comprises $96~\mathrm{m}$ of continuous pillow basalt followed by $109\;\mathrm{m}$ of pillow lava with tw o massive flows and one $6.3~\mathrm{m}$ thick sediment horizon. Glass rims are preserved on many pillo w margins. The massive flows can be quite voluminous; one massive basalt unit is at least $14.9\textrm{m}$ thick. The lavas range from highly phyric $(\sim\!8\%{-}15\%$ plagioclase, $0\%{-}4\%$ olivine, and $1\%{-3\%}$ pyroxene) to sparsely phyric or aphyric basalts. In highly phyric lavas, plagioclase phenocrysts an d glomerocrysts can be up to $15~\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter; pyroxene and olivine are generally much smalle r $(1{-}3\ \mathrm{mm})$ . Thicker massive units present relatively fresh rock, and pillow units are pervasivel y altered except for very fine-grained pillows, which preserve primary modal compositions in thei r interior. The vesicular and fractured nature of pillow lava stacks lends themselves to mineralization in the form of vesicle infilling and veins in fractures. The nature of this alteration change s downhole through the succession with carbonate and calcite, together with Fe oxyhydroxide dominating the upper igneous units and pyrite (marcasite), and associated Cu-bearing coatings an d zeolite infillings, becoming more common downhole. Farther within the volcanic sequence ther e is distinctive epidote mineralization along fractures and within pillow lava vesicles.

# 5.4.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Preliminary calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera biostratigraphy was conducted o n core catcher sections from Hole U1578A. A preliminary chronostratigraphic framework for sediments in this hole was obtained from the stratigraphic distribution of the investigated microfossi l groups, referring to biozonations based on Gradstein et al. (2012, 2020). Calcareous nannofossi l analysis was conducted on 18 core catcher sections and on 10 toothpick samples taken fro m within core sections. Planktonic foraminifera were analyzed in a total of 10 core catcher samples t o provide additional key age controls. Foraminifera sample preparation required the use of hydroge n peroxide $(30\%)$ to disaggregate lithified sediments, which limited the time available for shipboar d analysis. Overall, calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera are in good agreement a t Site U1578.  

![](images/7ff57b6ca369d2adc06fb8bf2a6985b90a36b9543afa2ea871056f3364241c55.jpg)  
Figure F31. Stratigraphic column for igneous basement, Hole U1578A.  

Calcareous nannofossils show good preservation and high abundances throughout Hole U1578A. Planktonic foraminifera are well preserved and abundant in the upper part of the stratigraphi c sequence (Sections 1R-CC and 2R-CC; Lithostratigraphic Unit I). Conversely, foraminifera abundances decrease downhole (Sections 3R-CC through 18R-CC) where an increase in radiolarian s was noted. Moreover, planktonic foraminifera show a decrease in test size in the same time interval, which possibly indicates a response to environmental stress. Sections 1R-CC and 2R-C C record late Pliocene (Piacenzian) to Pleistocene $(<\!0.43\;\mathrm{Ma})$ sediments. Toothpick samples for calcareous nannofossil analysis were taken from Section 2R-5 to investigate a lithologic change tha t was thought to be an additional age horizon. The examined samples revealed the presence of Oligocene and Eocene flora mixed with Gelasian (early Pleistocene) assemblages. The occurrence o f older taxa within the Pleistocene deposits may be indicative of sediment remobilization (e.g., slump/landslide). The existence of a major unconformity between early Pliocene (Zanclean) an d Paleogene deposits at ${\sim}27.0$ mbsf was confirmed by both calcareous nannofossil and planktoni c foraminifera data. A shift in MS and magnetic remanence values was also observed from the sam e depth interval, supporting the presence of the unconformity. Sections 3R-CC through 18R-C C recovered a continuous Paleogene stratigraphic sequence. Uncertainties in the placement of th e Eocene/Paleocene boundary derived from the analysis of calcareous nannofossil and planktoni c foraminifera assemblages. Planktonic foraminifera data indicate a mix of early Eocene (Ypresian ) and late Paleocene (Thanetian) taxa in Section 3R-CC. Calcareous nannofossils suggest a possibl e early Eocene age for the same sample because the late Paleocene marker Ericsonia robusta (56.7 8 Ma) is not observed until Section 5R-CC. The bottommost section (18R-CC), at the sediment/ basement contact, is dated between 61.98 and 62.07 Ma based on calcareous nannofossils. Planktonic foraminifera suggest a possibly older age $(62.2{-}63.5\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , but this date is considered unreliable due to the scarce abundance of foraminifera specimens in the section.  

Interbedded sediments within the basement section were investigated using calcareous nannofossils. Preliminary shipboard analyses indicate a possible age of ${\sim}63.25{-}64.81$ Ma. However, high-resolution postexpedition examination is required to better evaluate the age of the intercalated sediments. Preliminary biostratigraphic data from the chalk units of the uppermost fiv e interbeds indicate a Paleocene (Danian) age of deposition.  

# 5.4.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Sediment Cores 391-U1578A-1R through 19R consist of ooze to chalk with varying clay content. Archive halves and discrete samples were analyzed using the SRM and JR-6A spinner magnetometer, respectively. Sediment NRM values range $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-1}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Most sediments have media n destructive fields ranging $30{-}50~\mathrm{mT}$ . Thermal demagnetization spectra of sediment specimen s often revealed slow unblocking of magnetization starting from $200^{\circ}C$ and sometimes persisting t o $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This demagnetization behavior suggests that the dominant magnetization carriers in sediments from Hole U1578A are likely a mixture of titanomagnetite with varying Ti concentrations, magnetite, and hematite. We did not assign polarity chrons to Cores 1R–3R because there wa s high dispersion in magnetic inclination values for those cores. However, we were able to assembl e a magnetostratigraphy spanning six polarity chrons starting with Chron $C24\mathbf{r}$ in Core 4R throug h the top of Chron $C27\mathbf{n}$ in Core 19R, which is located just above the contact with the basement.  

Igneous rocks recovered from Site U1578 span Cores 391-U1578A-19R through 65R and primarily consist of basalt. Occasionally, layers of sedimentary rocks or hyaloclastites were observe d between basalt flows. The igneous rocks typically have NRM values ranging $1{-}10\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . After A F cleaning to $20\,\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , igneous rocks from Cores 20R–45R dominantly displayed a negative inclinatio n magnetization consistent with them having formed during a normal polarity interval. A brie f reversed polarity chron in Core 23R could possibly represent Chron $C27\mathbf{r}$ $(63.5{-}62.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), but i t could also be attributable to secondary chemical remagnetization or unsuccessful removal of dril l string overprints during partial AF demagnetization. Demagnetization of discrete samples fro m Cores 38R–44R had an unusually high failure rate. Cores 46R–65R dominantly displayed a positiv e inclination magnetization consistent with formation during a reversed polarity interval. This suggests that at least one geomagnetic reversal is recorded in the eruptive sequence at Site U1578. Most of the igneous rocks have median destructive field values between 5 and $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ and exhibit  a range of thermal demagnetization behaviors, with maximum unblocking temperatures rangin g ${\sim}200^{\circ}{-}580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (the Curie temperature of magnetite). This wide range of thermal demagnetizatio n behaviors implies the coexistence of several magnetic phases, such as magnetite and titanomagnetite with a large range of Ti content.  

# 5.4.3.5. Geochemistry  

At Site U1578, IW samples were analyzed for ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , alkalinity, and concentrations of major cations, anions, and trace elements. Both alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ show relatively narrow ranges compared t o previous sites. Calcium concentration increases downhole to 30 mbsf in Lithostratigraphic Unit  I and slowly decreases below this unit, whereas magnesium concentration shows a decreasing tren d throughout the sediment succession that is the reverse of the depth trend of potassium concentration. Silicon concentration increases from the top of the sediment to 50 mbsf and maintains hig h concentrations throughout the lower sediment succession. Lithium concentration decrease s within the top $50~\mathrm{m}$ of the sediment succession and remains at the low concentration below ${\sim}50$ mbsf, showing a trend generally opposite to silicon. We observe a narrow peak of manganese nea r the top of the sediment in Unit I and a broad peak near the bottom of the sediment in Subunit II A where iron concentrations are lower than the instrumental detection limit. A nonlinear decreas e of sulfate concentration is broadly found in Subunit IIA. Shallow phosphate and ammonium peak s are found at the top of the sediment $(2.96~\mathrm{m})$ , and below this depth phosphate and ammoniu m concentrations are nearly constant. Ammonium and phosphate concentrations at Site U1578 ar e significantly lower than at Sites U1575 and U1576 but are comparable to Site U1577 with a mola r ratio of 0.5:1. In summary, IW geochemistry at Site U1578 is affected by diagenesis of biogeni c carbonates at shallow depths and diagenesis of biogenic silica at deep depths. Sediment sample s were also analyzed for $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ total carbon, and total organic carbon contents. $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ conten t declines in Unit II, and organic carbon content is consistently low in the entire sedimentar y sequence. Methane concentrations measured from the headspace gas are lower than the atmospheric background level of $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{L}$ .  

Site U1578 recovered 12 igneous lithologic units of aphyric and phyric basalt lava flows. Sixtee n samples from the first eight units were analyzed for major and trace elements using ICP-AES. Additionally, 253 measurements were conducted on archive-half section pieces along the entir e igneous section using pXRF. LOI represents an indicator for the degree of alteration, and the analyzed samples show L $\mathrm{OI}<3\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , which is relatively fresh, given that they represent old submarin e rocks. All samples from Site U1578 are classified as basalts, except one hawaiite sample, and hav e an alkalic composition. In contrast to the previously drilled Expedition 391 sites, the Ti-V compositions are comparable to the ocean island basalt array and similar to other alkaline intraplate lava s previously reported from the TGW hotspot track. Based on the $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content, the samples ar e divided into high-Ti rocks $(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}=3.4–3.9\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ and very high–Ti rocks $\mathrm{(TiO_{2}}>\!3.9\,\,\mathrm{wt\%)}$ . In bivariate diagrams, the major and trace element trends of the high-Ti rocks are generally consisten t with olivine, $_\mathrm{Cr}$ -spinel, and pyroxene fractionation. The very high–Ti rocks are offset relative t o the high-Ti rocks to overall higher $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ , MnO, Sc, V, Co, Zn, and Y values, but they hav e lower $\mathrm{SiO}_{2},\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ and $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ contents for a given $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ . Site U1578 represents the longest basemen t interval drilled during Expedition 391, and significant downhole geochemical variations ar e observed. The $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content, for example, is relatively low $(2.5{-}3.3\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ in the upper part of th e recovered igneous succession. In Igneous Unit 8, the rocks are characterized by very high $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ values $(4.0{-}4.5\,\mathrm{\wt\%})$ that decrease to values averaging $3.6\,\mathrm{\,\wt\%}$ in Unit 9 and then graduall y decrease downhole to Units 11 and 12, where $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ is comparable to the upper part of the basement succession.  

# 5.4.3.6. Physical properties  

Three general lithostratigraphic intervals are identified in Hole U1578A based on physical properties measurements, including NGR, MS, MSP, bulk density, thermal conductivity, $P$ -wave velocity, and porosity. The first interval, consisting of calcareous ooze, clay, and chalk, may be divided int o upper and lower units based on NGR and MS/MSP values. At ${\sim}30$ mbsf, a pronounced increase i n mean MS/MSP (a shift from $7.39\times10^{-5}$ to $17.4\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}_{\rightmoon}$ ) and mean NGR (a shift from 3.32 to 6.1 7 counts/s) defines the boundary between Lithostratigraphic Unit I and Subunit IIA. Below th e $\mathord{\sim}184$ mbsf calcareous sediment/basalt contact, basalt units and volcaniclastic interbeds are distinguished by porosity (34.1 and $58.4~\mathrm{vol}\%$ in volcaniclastic interbeds versus 4.20 and $15.1\;\mathrm{vol}\%$ i n basalts) and thermal conductivity (1.05 to $1.33\;\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\mathrm{.K}]$ in volcaniclastic interbeds versus 1.66 t o 1.77 W/[m·K] in basalts). Increases in MS/MSP, $P$ -wave velocity, and GRA/MAD bulk density als o accompany the transition from volcaniclastic interbeds to basalt units. Physical properties measurements also appear to image mineralogical and compositional trends. Olivine-phyric lava flow s correlate to higher $(>3000\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ ) MS/MSP at ${\sim}218$ and ${\sim}253$ mbsf, and an anomalously hig h NGR count at ${\sim}270$ mbsf appears to correlate to a high-potassium aphyric basalt at the sam e depth.
