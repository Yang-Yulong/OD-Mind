# Introduction, background, and operations  

This chapter documents the procedures and methods employe d in the various shipboard laboratories on the research vessel (R/V ) JOIDES Resolution during International Ocean Discovery Progra m (IODP) Expedition 359. This information applies only to shipboar d work described in the expedition reports section of the Expeditio n 359 Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of Expedition  359  data  will  be  described  in  separate  individua l publications. This introductory section provides an overview of operations, curatorial conventions, depth scale terminology, and general core handling and analyses.  

# Site locations  

GPS coordinates from pre-expedition site surveys were used t o position the vessel at all Expedition 359 sites. A SyQuest Bathy 201 0 compressed high-intensity radar pulse (CHIRP) subbottom profile r was used to monitor seafloor depth on the approach to each site t o confirm the depth profiles from pre-expedition surveys. Once th e vessel was positioned over a site’s coordinates, the thrusters wer e lowered and a positioning beacon was dropped to the seafloor. Dynamic positioning control of the vessel used navigational input fro m the GPS system and triangulation to the seafloor beacon, weighte d by the estimated positional accuracy. The final hole position was th e mean position calculated from GPS data collected over a significan t time interval.  

# Coring and drilling operations  

All three standard coring systems, the advanced piston core r (APC), extended core barrel (XCB), and rotary core barrel (RCB )  

systems, were used during Expedition 359. The APC was used i n the upper portion of each hole (except at Site U1469 where only th e RCB system was used [see Operations in the Site U1469 chapte r (Betzler et al., 2017d)]) to obtain higher quality core. The APC cut s soft-sediment cores with minimal coring disturbance relative t o other IODP coring systems. After the APC core barrel is lowere d through the drill pipe and lands near the bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until the two shear pins that hold the inner barrel attache d to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation and cuts the core. The driller can detect a successful cut, o r “full stroke,” from the pressure gauge on the rig floor.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in two ways: (1) the pisto n fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from the pum p pressure reading) because the formation is too hard, or (2) excessiv e force $^{\leftmoon}_{\rightmoon}{}60{,}000$ lb; ${\sim}267\,\mathrm{kN})$ ) is required to pull the core barrel out o f the formation. When a full stroke cannot be achieved, additional attempts are typically made, and after each attempt, the bit is advanced by the length of core recovered. The number of additional attempts is generally dictated by the length of recovery of the partial stroke core and the time available to advance the hole by piston coring. This results in a nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ based on the assumption that the barrel penetrates the formation by the equivalen t of the length of core recovered. When a full or partial stroke i s achieved but excessive force cannot retrieve the barrel, the core barrel is sometimes “drilled over,” meaning after the inner core barrel i s successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit is advanced to total depth to free the APC barrel.  

The standard APC coring system contains a $9.5\:\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. Expedition 359 also used the half-length APC (HLAPC) corin g system, which uses a $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, th e HLAPC system was deployed after APC refusal. During use of th e HLAPC system, the same criteria for refusal were applied as for th e  

APC system. Use of this new technology allowed for significantl y greater continuous APC sampling depths to be attained than woul d have otherwise been possible.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used during all APC deployments to a pull force of ${\sim}40{,}000$ lb. APC cores were oriented usin g the FlexIT tool (see Paleomagnetism). Formation temperatur e measurements were made with the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3). The APCT-3 was used to obtain temperatur e gradients and heat flow estimates (see Downhole measurements ) for APC holes. A newly designed Motion Decoupled Hydraulic Delivery System (MDHDS) used to deploy the Sediment Temperatur e Tool (SET2) was tested at Sites U1467 and U1471. The MDHDS i s designed to decouple the SET2 from the ship heave and thereby giv e more accurate readings because of reduced movement in sedimen t (see Operations in the Site U1467 and Site U1471 chapters [Betzler et al., 2017c, 2017e]).  

The XCB coring system was used to advance the hole when AP C refusal occurred before the target depth was reached or when eithe r the formation became too stiff for APC coring or hard substrate wa s encountered. The XCB system is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe (bit) that extends below the large APC/XCB bit. Th e smaller bit can cut a semi-indurated core with less torque and flui d circulation than the main bit, optimizing recovery. The XCB cuttin g shoe extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediment bu t retracts into the main bit when hard formations are encountered. XCB core barrels are $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long.  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is the lowermost part of th e drill string. The exact configuration of the BHA is reported in th e Operations section of each site chapter. A typical APC/XCB BH A consisted of a drill bit (outer diameter $=11\,\%$ inch), a bit sub, a sea l bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub, a modifie d head sub, a nonmagnetic drill collar (for APC/XCB), a number of  8 inch $({\sim}20.32~\mathrm{cm)}$ drill collars, a tapered drill collar, six joints (tw o stands) of $5\%$ inch $({\sim}13.97~\mathrm{cm})$ drill pipe, and one crossover sub.  A lockable float valve was used when downhole logging was planne d so that downhole logs could be collected through the bit.  

The RCB coring system was deployed when the formation became too hard for XCB coring. The RCB system is the most conventional rotary drilling system and was used during Expedition 359 t o drill and core into lithified carbonate rocks. The RCB system requires a dedicated RCB BHA and a dedicated RCB drilling bit. Th e BHA used for RCB coring included a $9\%$ inch RCB drill bit, a mechanical bit release (if logging was considered), a modified head sub, an outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, an d seven to ten control-length drill collars followed by a tapered dril l collar to the two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe. Most cored interval s are ${\sim}9.7\mathrm{~m~}$ long, which is the length of a standard rotary core an d approximately the length of a joint of drill pipe. In some cases, th e drill string is drilled or “washed” ahead without recovering sediment to advance the drill bit to a target depth to resume core recovery. Such intervals are typically drilled using a center bit installe d within the RCB bit. During RCB coring, half cores were sometime s collected to improve recovery.  

# Core handling and analysis  

Cores recovered during Expedition 359 were extracted from th e core barrel in $67~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter plastic liners. These liners were carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwal k outside the core laboratory, where they were split into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections. The exact section length was noted and later entered into th e database as “created length” using the SampleMaster application. This number was used to calculate recovery. Headspace sample s were taken from selected section ends (at least one per core) using  a syringe for immediate hydrocarbon analysis as part of the shipboar d safety and pollution prevention program. Similarly, whole-roun d samples for interstitial water (IW) were cut on the catwalk at th e same sampling resolution. Core catcher samples were taken for biostratigraphic analysis. When catwalk sampling was complete, line r caps (blue $=$ top; colorless $=$ bottom; yellow $=$ bottom; whole-roun d cut) were glued with acetone onto liner sections, and the section s were placed in core racks in the laboratory for analysis. Rhizon I W samples were taken from selected intervals in addition to whol e rounds after the whole-round core sections were measured fo r physical properties (see Geochemistry).  

Indurated rock core pieces were slid out of the liners and place d in order in new, clean sections of core liner that were already split i n half. Pieces having a vertical length greater than the internal (horizontal) diameter of the core liner are considered oriented pieces because they could have rotated only around their vertical axes. Thos e pieces were immediately marked on the bottom with a red wax pencil to preserve their vertical (upward) orientations. Pieces that wer e too small to be oriented with certainty were left unmarked. Adjacent but broken core pieces that could be fit together along fracture s were curated as single pieces. The carbonate sedimentologist o n shift confirmed the piece matches and corrected any errors.  

Core sections were then placed in core racks in the laboratory . When the cores reached equilibrium with laboratory temperatur e (typically after ${\sim}4~\mathrm{h}$ ), whole-round core sections were run throug h the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL; measuring $P$ - wave velocity, density, and magnetic susceptibility) and the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL). Thermal conductivity measurements were typically taken at a rate of one per core (see Physica l properties). Core sections were then split lengthwise from botto m to top into working and archive halves. This process may transpor t older material upward on the split face of each section during splitting. For hard rock sections, each piece of core was split with a diamond-impregnated saw into archive and working halves.  

The working half of each core was sampled for shipboard biostratigraphic, physical properties, carbonate, paleomagnetic, an d inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES) analyses. Archive halves of all cores were scanned on the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) with a line scan camera at 20 pix$\mathrm{els}/\mathrm{mm}$ and  measured  for  color  reflectance  and  magneti c susceptibility on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). A t the same time, archive halves were described visually and by mean s of smear slides and thin sections. All observations were recorded i n the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) databas e using DESClogik, a descriptive data capture application. After visual description, archive halves were run through the cryogeni c magnetometer. Finally, digital color close-up images were taken o f particular features of the archive or working halves, as requested b y individual scientists. For hard sedimentary rock cores, routine sampling meetings were held to select key sampling intervals for shipboard and limited shore-based analyses. Discrete samples wer e taken from working halves for physical properties, paleomagnetism, thin section, and ICP-AES analyses. After these shipboard sample s were taken, limited sampling for personal postexpedition researc h was conducted on the working halves. The IODP curator kept records of all samples taken.  

Both halves of the core were put into labeled plastic tubes (Dtubes) that were sealed and transferred to cold storage space aboar d the ship. At the end of the expedition, the cores were transported t o cold storage at the Gulf Coast Repository at Texas A&M Universit y (USA) for inventory and preparation for the postexpedition sampling party. After the sampling party was completed, all Expeditio n 359 cores were shipped to permanent cold storage at the Kochi Cor e Center (Japan), which houses cores collected from the western Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Kerguelen Plateau, and Bering Sea.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed as a result of the drillin g process and may contain extraneous material as a result of the coring and core handling processes. In formations with loose sand layers, sand from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down b y drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom of the hole, and b e sampled with the next core. The uppermost $10{-}50\;\mathrm{cm}$ of each cor e must therefore be examined critically during description for potential “fall-in.” Common coring-induced deformation includes th e concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Piston action may result in fluidization (“flow-in”) at the bottom o f APC cores. Retrieval from depth to the surface may result in elasti c rebound. Gas that is in solution at depth may become free and driv e core segments within the liner apart. Both elastic rebound and ga s pressure can result in a total length for each core that is longer tha n the interval that was cored and thus a calculated recovery of ${>}100\%$ . If gas expansion or other coring disturbance results in a void in an y particular core section, the void can be closed by either moving material to the very large void, stabilized by a foam insert if moderatel y large, or left as is. These disturbances are described in the Lithostratigraphy sections of each site chapter and are graphically indicate d on the core summary graphic reports (digital visual core descriptions [VCDs]). Core disturbance by gas was minimal during Expedition 359. The few core sections so affected are marked by a yello w label with the word “disturbed,” and the nature of the disturbance i s noted in the coring log.  

# Curatorial procedures  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples follows standar d IODP procedure. Drilling sites are numbered consecutively fro m the first site drilled by the drilling vessel (D/V) Glomar Challenger in 1968. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 301 bega n using the prefix “U” to designate sites occupied by the United State s Implementing Organization (USIO) platform, the JOIDES Resolution. This practice is continued today by IODP and the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO). For all IODP drill sites, a lette r suffix distinguishes each hole drilled at the same site. The first hol e drilled is assigned the site number modified by the suffix “A,” th e second hole the site number and the suffix “B,” and so on.  

Cores taken from a hole are numbered sequentially from the to p of the hole downward. When an interval is drilled down, this interval is also numbered sequentially, and the drill down is designate d by a $^{\ast}1^{\prime\prime}$ instead of a letter that designates the coring method use d (e.g., 359-U1465A-11). Cores taken with the APC system are designated with $\mathcal{A}^{\flat}$ (APC cores) or ${}^{\epsilon}\mathrm{F}^{\upsilon}$ (HLAPC cores), “X” designate s XCB cores, and ${}^{\ast}\mathbf{R}^{\ast}$ designates RCB cores. ${}^{*}\!G^{,*}$ designates “ghost ” cores that are collected while washing down through a previousl y drilled portion of a hole with a core barrel in place. The core barre l is then retrieved prior to coring the next interval. Core numbers an d their associated cored intervals are unique in a given hole. Generally, maximum recovery for a single core is $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment (APC ) or $9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of rock or sediment (XCB/RCB) contained in a plastic line r $_{\left.6.6\mathrm{~cm}\right.}$ internal diameter) plus an additional ${\sim}0.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ in the cor e catcher, which is a device at the bottom of the core barrel that prevents the core from sliding out when the barrel is retrieved from th e hole. In certain situations, recovery may exceed the 9.5 or $9.7\,\textrm{m}$ maximum. In soft sediment, this is normally caused by core expansion resulting from depressurization. In hard rock cores, this typically occurs when a pedestal of rock fails to break off and is grabbe d by the core barrel of the subsequent core. High heave, tidal changes, and overdrilling can also result in an advance that differs from th e planned $9.5/9.7\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

Recovered cores are divided into $1.5\textrm{m}$ sections that are numbered serially from the top downcore. When full recovery is obtained, the sections are numbered 1–7, with the last section usuall y being $_{<1.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ . Rarely, an unusually long core may require more tha n seven sections. When the recovered core is shorter than the core d interval, by convention the top of the core is deemed to be located a t the top of the cored interval for the purpose of calculating (consistent) depths. When coring hard rock, all pieces recovered are place d immediately adjacent to each other in the core tray. Samples and descriptions of cores are designated by distance, measured in centimeters, from the top of the section to the top and bottom of eac h sample or interval. By convention, hard rock material recovere d from the core catcher is placed below the last section. In sedimentary cores, the core catcher section is treated as a separate sectio n ${\mathsf{\Gamma}}^{\iota\epsilon}{\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{C}}^{\upsilon}{\rangle}$ . When the only recovered material is in the core catcher, it i s placed at the top of the cored interval.  

A full curatorial sample identifier consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, and interval in centimeters measured from the top of the cor e section. For example, a sample identification of $^{4}359$ -U1469C-2H-5, $80{-}85~\mathrm{cm},^{\prime\prime}$ represents a sample taken from the interval between 8 0 and $85\;\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 5 of Core 2 (collected using th e APC system) of Hole C of Site U1469 during Expedition 359.  

# Sample depth calculations  

The primary depth scale types are based on the measurement o f the drill string length deployed beneath the rig floor (drilling dept h below rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]), th e length of each core recovered (core depth below seafloor [CSF] an d core composite depth below seafloor [CCSF]), and the length of th e logging wireline deployed (wireline log depth below rig floo r [WRF], wireline log depth below seafloor [WSF], and wireline lo g matched depth below seafloor [WMSF]). All units are in meters. Depths of samples and measurements are calculated at the applicable depth scale either by fixed protocol (e.g., CSF) or by combinations of protocols with user-defined correlations (e.g., CCSF). Th e definition of these depth scale types and the distinction in nomenclature should keep the user aware that a nominal depth value a t two different depth scale types usually does not refer to exactly th e same stratigraphic interval in a hole.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF scale). The depth of the cored interval is referenced to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth at the time of th e first hole from the DRF depth of the interval. In most cases, the seafloor depth is the length of pipe deployed minus the length of th e mudline core recovered. However, some seafloor depths were determined by offset from a previous known measurement of depth or b y tagging the seafloor with the camera system in place.  

Standard depths of cores in meters below the seafloor (CSF- A scale) are determined based on the assumptions that (1) the to p depth of a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of its core d interval (DSF scale) and (2) the recovered material is a contiguou s section even if core segments are separated by voids when recovered. Voids in the core are closed by pushing core segments together, if possible, during core handling. This convention is als o applied if a core has incomplete recovery, in which case the true position of the core within the cored interval is unknown and shoul d be considered a sample depth uncertainty, up to the length of th e core barrel used, when analyzing data associated with the core material. Standard depths of samples and associated measurement s (CSF-A scale) are calculated by adding the offset of the sample o r measurement from the top of its section and the lengths of al l higher sections in the core to the top depth of the cored interval.  

A soft to semisoft sediment core from less than a few hundre d meters below seafloor expands upon recovery (typically a few percent to as much as $15\%$ ), so the length of the recovered core exceed s that of the cored interval. Therefore, a stratigraphic interval ma y not have the same nominal depth at the DSF and CSF scales in th e same hole. When core recovery (the ratio of recovered core to core d interval times $100\%$ ) is ${>}100\%$ , the CSF depth of a sample take n from the bottom of a core will be deeper than that of a sample fro m the top of the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated with the tw o core intervals overlap at the CSF-A scale).  

Core composite depth scales (CCSF) are constructed to mitigat e the CSF-A core overlap or coring gap problems and to create as continuous a stratigraphic record as possible. Using shipboard trackbased physical properties data verified with core photos, cor e depths in adjacent holes at a site are vertically shifted to correlat e between cores recovered in adjacent holes. This process produce s the CCSF-A depth scale. The correlation process results in affine tables, indicating the vertical shift of cores at the CCSF scale relativ e to the CSF-A scale. Once the CCSF scale is constructed, a splice ca n be defined that best represents the stratigraphy of a site by utilizin g and splicing the best portions of individual sections and cores fro m each hole at a site. This process produces the CCSF-D depth scale, which is strictly correct only along the splice. Because of core expansion, the CCSF-A/D depths of stratigraphic intervals are typically $10\%{-}15\%$ deeper  than  their  CSF-A  depths.  CCSF- A construction also reveals that coring gaps on the order of $1{-}1.5\ \mathrm{m}$ may occur between two subsequent cores, despite the apparen t ${>}100\%$ recovery.  

Cored intervals are defined by the core top depth on the DS F scale and the distance the driller advanced the bit and/or core barre l in meters. The length of the core is defined by the sum of th e lengths of core sections. The CSF depth of a sample is calculated b y adding the offset of the sample below the section top and th e lengths of all higher sections in the core to the core top depth measured with the drill string (DSF). During Expedition 359, all cor e depths below seafloor were calculated according to CSF Method  A (CSF-A) depth scale (see IODP Depth Scales Terminology, v.2, a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines).  To  more  easil y communicate shipboard results, CSF-A depths are reported in thi s volume in text, tables, and figures as meters below seafloor (mbsf ) unless otherwise noted.

# Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology  

The primary procedures used for lithostratigraphic analysi s during Expedition 359 included visual core description, sedimen t classification, digital color imaging, and smear slide and thin sectio n description. These analyses are complemented by color spectrophotometry and point source magnetic susceptibility data acquire d prior to core description, which are described in detail in Physica l properties. Carbonate, organic matter (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogensulfur [CHNS] analysis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and geochemical measurements are described in detail in Geochemistry.  

# Core preparation  

The standard method of splitting cores into working and archiv e halves (using either piano wire or a saw) can affect the appearanc e of the split-core surface and obscure fine details of lithology an d sedimentary structure. When necessary, the archive halves of core s were gently scraped using a stainless steel or glass scraper to prepare the surface for sedimentologic examination and digital imaging. Scraping parallel to bedding with a freshly cleaned tool prevented contamination. Cleaned sections were then photographed using the SHIL and measured for magnetic susceptibilit y using the SHMSL (see Physical properties).  

# Sediment and rock classification  

Sediments  were  described  using  a  modified  classificatio n scheme derived from those of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg s 166 and 194 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1997a, 2002) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 346 (Tada et al., 2015a). For consistency and uniformity, the Dunham (1962) textural classification was applied in conjunction with the depositional texture s described by Embry and Klovan (1972) (Figure F1). Following Dunham (1962), carbonate crystals or fragments smaller than $30~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ (not visible/determinable with a hand lens) are considered as matri x or microcrystalline carbonates known as micrite or mud. Constituents $>\!30\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ are called grains. We used the following definitions:  

Mudstone $=$ mud-supported fabric with ${<}10\%$ grains.   
Wackestone $=$ mud-supported fabric with ${>}10\%$ grains.   
Packstone $=$ grain-supported fabric with intergranular mud, ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ grains.   
Grainstone $=$ mud-free grain-supported fabric.   
Floatstone $=$ matrix-supported fabric grains, at least $10\%$ of which are $>\!2\;\mathrm{mm}$ in size.   
Rudstone $=$ grain-supported fabric grains, at least $10\%$ of which are $>\!2\;\mathrm{mm}$ in size.   
Boundstone $=$ components organically bound during deposition.  

# The boundstone group includes the following:  

Bafflestone $=$ formed by organisms that act as baffles.  

![](images/33a765c485a24b7c19a9dfc3f88a2204844a3c6c92ee3b779252775c182ebb0f.jpg)  

Bindstone $=$ formed by organisms that encrust or bind. Framestone $=$ formed by organisms that build a rigid framework.  

# Nomenclature  

Lithologic names assigned to sediments consist of a principa l name and modifiers based on composition, texture, and degree o f lithification, as well as texture as determined from visual core description. Additional detail to visual descriptions was derived fro m smear slide observations.  

If possible, the major modifiers “skeletal” and “nonskeletal” wer e used to indicate the occurrence of bioclastic fragments and nonbioclastic allochems, respectively, within the carbonate sediments. Th e lack of such a modifier implies that components were not identifie d or that the sediments include an even proportion of skeletal an d nonskeletal allochems. If nonskeletal components exceed $25\%$ , the n the lithology was determined to be nonskeletal.  

Whenever dolomite or dolomitic texture was recognized $(\mathrm{>}25\%)$ in carbonate sediments, the term “dolomitic” was used as a majo r modifier (e.g., dolomitic mudstone). When a lithology appeared t o contain more than $\sim\!75\%$ dolomite, it was called “dolostone” or, i f skeletal components were recognized, “skeletal dolostone.”  

# Sediment core description  

The following strategy was adopted before writing comments o n the VCD template used for each core section (Figure F2):  

1. Digital photographs of every core section, including core catcher fraction and voids, were taken using the methodology described in Digital color imaging. 2. Descriptive logging sheets and VCD forms with core photographs were printed and used for macroscopic core description. 3. Cores were examined to identify boundaries, determine lithologies, identify key features, and identify samples to be collected (i.e., smear slide, thin section, and/or close-up photograph sites). Observations were recorded on the VCDs. 4. Cores were described in detail on the VCDs following the procedure outlined in Visual core description. 5. The archive halves of soft-sediment cores were analyzed with the contact core logger (SHMSL) to obtain spectral color reflec  

tance data and point magnetic susceptibility (the latter is described in Physical properties).   
6. Information recorded on the VCDs was entered in the LIMS database using the data entry software DESClogik to store the data and produce the final digital VCDs (see Core descriptions). Entry parameters were customized according to the objectives of Expedition 359 and based on the above classification scheme.   
7. Ultimately, VCD data from different holes at a site were compiled into one figure and one table, visualizing an overview of lithostratigraphic units.  

# Visual core description  

VCD sheets provide a summary of data collected during shipboard analysis of each core (Figure F2). Detailed observations o f each section were initially recorded by hand on paper, adjacent t o the printed scanned image of that section. Copies of these original descriptions were scanned and converted to PDF files and are included in SHIL in Supplementary material. The recorded dat a were subsequently entered with the DESClogik software into th e LIMS database, which provides data that can be used in Strater t o generate a simplified, annotated graphical description (VCD) fo r each core.  

Site, hole, and depth (in meters CSF-A, or mbsf) are given at th e top of the VCD sheets, with the corresponding depths of core sections along the right margin of the core photograph (depth acronyms  follow  the  IODP  Depth  Scale  Terminology  a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines). Columns on th e VCD sheets include Lithologic unit, Core image, Shipboard samples, Coring disturbance (type and intensity), Graphic lithology, Texture classification (Dunham, 1962), Average grain size, Lithologic accessories (Components), Sedimentary structures, Lithification, Bioturbation intensity, Age, and Color. Profiles of magneti c susceptibility, natural gamma radiation (NGR), and reflectance $\left(\mathbf{L}^{*},\right.$ , $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ , and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) are also included. These columns are discussed in mor e detail below.  

IODP conventions used for compiling hand-drawn and digita l VCDs and the modifications to these procedures adopted durin g Expedition 359 are described below. The order of the followin g headers reflects the order from left to right of the columns on th e hand-drawn section VCDs.

This column lists the offset from the top of the section in centimeters.  

# Samples  

Sample material for shipboard sedimentological and chemica l analyses consisted of IW whole rounds, micropaleontology samples, smear slides, thin sections, and XRD samples for bulk analysi s and was routinely taken from the core catcher of each core adjacen t to the micropaleontological sample and at other levels of lithologi c interest. Carbonate analyses were routinely taken from IW squeez e cakes at the rate of two per core and at additional levels where requested. The following abbreviations were used on the digital VCD s for samples: ${\boldsymbol{S}}=$ smear slide, $\mathrm{TS}=$ thin section, $\mathrm{PAL=}$ micropaleontology, $C\mathbf{P}=$ close-up photo, $\mathrm{XRD}=\mathrm{X}.$ -ray diffraction, and $\mathbf{IW}=\mathbf{in}\cdot$ - terstitial water. All samples taken were noted in the Shipboar d samples column with the following abbreviations: ${\boldsymbol{S}}=$ smear slide,  C $=$ carbonate, $\operatorname{IW}=$ interstitial water, $\mathbf{P}=$ micropaleontology, $X=X\cdot$ - ray diffraction, $\mathrm{T}=$ thin section, and $\mathrm{H}=$ headspace.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Because core disturbance from the drilling process can impac t the integrity of the stratigraphic sequence, drilling disturbances, i f any, are documented for both soft and firm sediment using the following classification scheme:  

• Slightly disturbed: bedding contacts are slightly bent or bowed in a concave-downward appearance. • Moderately disturbed: bedding is moderately deformed but probably still in the correct stratigraphic sequence. • Heavily disturbed: sediment is completely deformed and may show no traces of original bedding or structure.  

In addition to this first-order assessment of disturbance, a number of other terms (Figure F3) may appear on the VCDs to characterize drilling disturbance. Some of the more common type s observed include the following:  

• Flow-in: soupy, displaced sediment was pulled into the core liner during APC coring.   
• Fall-in: downhole contamination resulting from loose material falling from the drill hole walls into the top of the core. The uppermost $10{-}15\;\mathrm{cm}$ of each core was inspected during description for potential fall-in.   
• Bowed: bedding contacts are slightly to moderately deformed but still subhorizontal and continuous.   
• Soupy/mousse-like (“soupy”): intervals are water saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
• Biscuit: sediment of intermediate stiffness shows vertical variations in the degree of disturbance. Softer intervals are washed

# Lithology  

General terminology defining the type of rock/sediment. IOD P generally uses standard lithologic descriptors (e.g., ooze for nonlithified sediments or limestone for hard calcareous rock made of aragonite, calcite, or Mg-calcite) to produce the standard lithologi c column. However, during Expedition 359, the Dunham (1962) textural classification was applied in conjunction with the depositiona l textures described by Embry and Klovan (1972) to classify all carbonate sediments. Hard rock composed of dolomite was classifie d as dolostone.  

# Texture  

Sedimentary textures in all levels of lithification and with n o separation for environments and components were systematicall y classified using the Dunham (1962) textural classification wit h modification by Embry and Klovan (1972).  

# Color  

Color was determined qualitatively using Munsell Soil Colo r Charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 1994) and described immediately after cores were split to avoid color changes associated wit h drying and redox reactions. When portions of the split core surfac e required cleaning with a stainless steel or glass scraper, they wer e cleaned prior to determining the color. Munsell color names and th e corresponding hue and chroma values are provided in the Colo r column on the VCDs.  

Grain size  

Four major grain size classes were used: <63, 63–250, 250–2000, and ${>}2000~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ (scale from Wentworth, 1922). Relative abundance s of a sample were estimated based on sieving small samples take n from the working half. Alternatively, if sieving was not possible, th e dominant grain size of the components is listed; grains were measured under a magnifying glass with respect to length scale.  

Special notes for modality and matrix grain size are made in th e Comments column.  

# Components  

A preliminary list (prior to smear slides and thin sections) o f components is given in Figure F3.  

# Sedimentary structures  

This column includes sedimentary structures not related to bioturbation, syn- and postdepositional (e.g., grain sorting, cross-bedding,  and  erosional  boundaries).  The  locations  and  types  o f stratification and sedimentary structures visible on the prepare d surfaces of the split cores are shown on the hand-drawn sectio n VCD. Symbols on the digital core VCD indicate the locations an d scales of stratification and the locations of individual bedding features and any other sedimentary features, such as scours, rippl e laminations, and fining-upward, coarsening-upward, or bigradational bedded intervals.  

Lithification  

Firmness of recovered materials was defined as in Gealy et al . (1971). Three levels of firmness were used to describe sediment s and rocks, indicating the degree of lithification:  

1. Unlithified: soft sediments that have little strength and are readily deformed under the pressure of a fingernail or the broad blade of a spatula. Corresponds to the term “ooze” for pelagic calcareous sediments. 2. Partially lithified: firm but friable sediments that can be scratched with a fingernail or the edge of a spatula blade. 3. Lithified: hard, nonfriable cemented rock, difficult or impossible to scratch with a fingernail or the edge of a spatula.  

# Bioturbation  

Five levels of bioturbation intensity were recognized using  a scheme similar to that of Droser and Bottjer (1986). These levels ar e illustrated with a numeric scale in the Bioturbation intensity column.  

${\bf1}={\bf n o}$ bioturbation.   
$2=$ slight bioturbation $\left(<\!10\%{-30\%}\right)$ .   
$3=$ moderate bioturbation $(>\!30\%{-}60\%)$ .   
$4=$ heavy bioturbation $(>\!60\%-90\%)$ .   
$5=$ complete bioturbation $(>\!90\%$ ).  

Any identifiable trace fossils (ichnofossils) are identified in the bioturbation comments.  

# Layering  

Layers and bedding thickness were further described and classified following terminology based on Stow (2005) and described i n the comments column:  

Thin lamination $=<\!3\;\mathrm{mm}$ thick.   
Medium lamination $=0.3–0.6\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thick lamination $=>\!0.6–1\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Very thin bed $={>}1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thin bed $=>\!3\!-\!10\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Medium bed $=>\!10\!-\!30\,\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thick bed $=>\!30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Very thick bed $=>\!100\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.  

Descriptive terms for bed boundaries, such as sharp, erosive, gradual, irregular, and bioturbated, are noted.  

Comments  

This section of the VCD contains a written summary of the lithologies graphically presented. Dominant and supporting skeletal components are listed in order of importance, as well as other distinctive observations that are not indicated graphically. Key feature s such as exposure surfaces, changes in mineralogy, sudden porosit y changes, and so on, are noted for emphasis where they are critical t o identifying lithologic unit boundaries. In some cases, informal interpretation of the depositional environment is additionally provided.  

# Other lithostratigraphy and sedimentology analyses  

# Smear slides  

Smear slide samples were taken from archive halves during cor e description to determine the matrix of the sediments at location s with a major lithologic change. A small amount of sediment was removed with a wooden toothpick, dispersed evenly in deionized water on a $25\:\mathrm{mm}\times75\:\mathrm{mm}$ glass slide, and dried on a hot plate at a lo w setting. A drop of mounting medium (Norland Optical) and a 2 2 $\mathrm{mm}\times30\;\mathrm{mm}$ cover glass were added, and the slide was placed in a n UV light box for ${\sim}15\ \mathrm{min}$ . Once fixed, each slide was scanned a t $\times100$ to $\times200$ with a transmitted light petrographic microscope using an eyepiece micrometer to assess grain size distributions in cla y $(<\!4{\mathrm{~}}\upmu{\mathrm{m}})$ , silt $(4{-}63~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and sand $(>\!63\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ fractions. An eyepiec e micrometer was calibrated once for each magnification and combination of ocular and objective using an inscribed stage micrometer.  

Relative abundance (percent) of each grain size and type was estimated by microscopic examination. Smear slide analyses tend t o underestimate the abundance of sand-sized and larger grains (e.g., foraminifers, radiolarians, and siliciclastic/volcaniclastic sand) because these are difficult to incorporate into the smear. After scanning for grain size distribution, several fields were examined at $\times200$ to $\times500$ for mineralogical and microfossil identification.  

Standard petrographic techniques were employed to identif y minerals and skeletal components, as well as important accessor y minerals and microfossils. The smear slide analysis data workshee t used during these analyses is shown in Figure F4. The data generated are included in the core descriptions. These tables provide information about the sample location, a description of where th e smear slide was taken, the estimated abundances of texture (i.e., sand, silt, and clay), and the relative composition of individual components in the sediment (i.e., detrital carbonate, biogenic carbonate, and biogenic silica).  

Relative abundances of identified components such as minera l grains, microfossils, and biogenic fragments were assigned on  a semiquantitative basis using the following abbreviations:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $>\!20\%$ of field of view).   
$C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $(>\!5\%{-}20\%$ of field of view).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $(1\%-5\%$ of field of view).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $1\%$ of field of view).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present (1 per 1–10 fields of view).  

$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none in field of view).  

# Thin sections  

Thin sections were described using dedicated forms for listin g texture and skeletal and nonskeletal components and registering cement content and morphology; these forms include a hand drawin g showing significant features (Figure F5). In addition, pore type s were identified and percentage of visual porosity was estimate d during this process.  

# Digital color imaging  

The archive half of each core was placed in the SHIL, which captures continuous high-resolution images of the archive-half surfac e for analysis and description. Images were collected shortly afte r core splitting and surface scraping in an effort to avoid colo r changes resulting from excessive sediment drying and oxidation o f the surface. The shipboard system uses a commercial line-sca n camera lens (AF Micro Nikon; $60\ \mathrm{mm};\ 1{:}2.8\ \mathrm{D})$ , with illuminatio n provided by a custom assembly of three pairs of LED strip light s that provide constant illumination over a range of surface elevations. Each LED pair has a color temperature of $6{,}500\ \mathrm{K}$ and emit s 90,000 lux at 3 inches. The resolution of the line-scan camera wa s set at 20 pixels/mm. Available files include the original high-resolution TIFF image with a gray scale and ruler and reduced JPEG images cropped to show only section-half surfaces. High-resolutio n color data (red, green, and blue) were acquired by digital color imaging. A manually cropped JPEG image was generated to assist i n visual core description. Postprocessing of data included color balance (performed by the Imaging Specialist) and construction of  a composite JPEG of each core.  

# Grain size distribution  

Either small samples taken from the working halves or cleanin g residue from the archive halves were used for grain size analysis. Samples were wet sieved and dry sieved using the following grai n size classes: $<\!63\,\upmu\mathrm{m},\,63\mathrm{-}250\,\upmu\mathrm{m},\,250\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ to $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ , and $>\!2\;\mathrm{mm}$ . Results were noted on the sieve sample analysis form (Figure F6).

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils, radiolarians, ostracods, and foraminifers in core catcher samples were studied at all sites. Samples fro m core sections were also examined when a more refined age determination was necessary and when time permitted. Biostratigraphi c events, mainly the first occurrence (FO or base) and last occurrenc e (LO or top) of diagnostic species, are tied to the geomagnetic polarity timescale of Gradstein et al. (2012). Because we mainly studie d core catchers, the depth of an event was calculated as the midpoin t between the two core catchers that enclose the event. Correlation o f the zonation and events for the different groups is presented in Figure F7.  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Calcareous nannofossils were examined in smear slides usin g standard light microscope techniques under crossed polarizers, transmitted light, and phase contrast at $1000\times$ magnification. Nannofossil taxonomy follows Young (1998), Hine and Weaver (1998), and Young et al. (2003) as synthesized on the Nannotax websit e (http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3). Bioevent ages were assigne d based on the occurrence of calcareous nannofossils (dominant, present, or absent) in core catcher samples and in additional splitcore sections when necessary. Calibration of the identified event s was derived mainly from Gradstein et al. (2012) as synthesized i n TimeScaleCreator v6.3. The principal events recognized are summarized in Table T1. The standard zonal scheme of Martini (1971 ) was adopted as a general frame of reference. However, for age models and intersite calibration, individual events were used accordin g to their reliability and ease of recognition irrespective of whethe r they formed part of the standard zonation. The compilations o f Backman et al. (2012) and Raffi et al. (2006) were used to provid e additional information on the reliability, definition, and timing o f events.

# Preparation techniques  

Samples were primarily prepared following the rippled smea r slide technique (Bown and Young, 1998) and mounted with Norland Optical Adhesive-NOA61. Coarse sands encountered at som e sites were not easily prepared using smear slides, and in these level s suspension slides were used: a few millimeters cubed of crushe d sediment was suspended in water in a $5~\mathrm{mL}$ microcentrifuge tub e and allowed to settle for approximately $30\,{\mathsf s}_{}$ , and then a few drops o f the overlying suspension were pipetted onto a slide. In addition, “mudline” samples were analyzed for core-top calcareous nannofossils. These samples were collected from the suspended sediment i n the seawater recovered from above the sediment/seawater interfac e in the first core of each site. Approximately $20~\mathrm{mL}$ of suspensio n was collected in a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for  1 min to separate the seawater, and the pellet was resuspended in  a buffered solution. Selected samples were also examined using th e shipboard scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi TM3000).  

# Data recording  

To facilitate consistent data recording between the three nannofossil specialists, a common assemblage record sheet was produce d (Figure F8). This sheet provided a list of all significant taxa we anticipated finding in the target interval (Holocene to the base of th e Miocene) with, where relevant, brief indications of taxonomic concepts used. This sheet was transcribed into the DESClogik syste m and is available in the LIMS database (http://iodp.tamu.edu / tasapps).  

Total calcareous nannofossil abundance within the sedimen t was recorded as follows:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $750\%$ of sediment particles).   
$C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $(>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $(1\%{-}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no specimens).

Abundance of individual calcareous nannofossil taxa was recorded as follows:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $_{>10}$ specimens per field of view).   
$C=$ common $_{(>1-10}$ specimens per field of view).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per 1–10 fields of view).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $_{<1}$ specimen per 10 fields of view).  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils was recorded as follows:  

$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics only slightly altered, and specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (specimens exhibit some etching and/or recrystallization and primary morphological characteristics somewhat altered; however, most specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{poor}$ (specimens severely etched or overgrown, primary morphological characteristics largely destroyed, fragmentation has occurred, and specimens often unidentifiable at the species and/or generic level).  

These are standard categories; in practice, overgrowth and recrystallization were far more common than etching at all sites.  

# Foraminifers  

# Planktonic foraminifers  

The planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphic zonation scheme s of Blow (1969, 1979) and Berggren et al. (1995) as modified by Wad e et al. (2011) were used in this study. Calibrated ages for bioevent s used during this expedition are from Gradstein et al. (2012) and ar e summarized in Table T1. We included the LO of Globigerinoides ruber (pink) $\mathbf{\dot{\left(0.12\,Ma_{\lambda}}\right)}$ ; Thompson et al., 1979) as a biostratigraphic indicator. Taxonomic concepts for Neogene and Paleogene tax a mainly follow those of Kennett and Srinivasan (1983) and Bolli an d Saunders (1985).  

# Benthic foraminifers  

Taxonomic assignments follow Tjalsma and Lohmann (1983), van Morkhoven et al. (1986), Miller and Katz (1987), Thoma s (1990), Van Marle (1991), Katz and Miller (1991), Kato (1992), Jone s (1994), Nomura (1995), Hanagata (2003), Hanagata and Hiramats u (2005), Kaminski and Gradstein (2005), and Holbourn et al. (2013). The generic classification of Loeblich and Tappan (1988) was use d and updated in some instances, particularly for uniserial taxa (Hayward, 2002).  

Paleodepth estimates were based on selected benthic foraminiferal taxa noted and described by van Morkhoven et al. (1986) using the following categories:  

Neritic $=-200\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
Bathyal $=200{-}2000\,\mathrm{m}$ .   
Upper bathyal $=200{-}600\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
Middle bathyal $=600–1000\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
Lower bathyal $=1000{-}2000\,\mathrm{m}$ .   
Abyssal $=>\!2000\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
Upper abyssal $=2000{-}3000\,\mathrm{m}$ .   
Lower abyssal $=>\!3000\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Preparation and examination techniques  

Sample preparation for foraminifer identification uses the sam e techniques as for planktonic and benthic foraminifers. Core catche r samples were soaked in distilled water and washed over a $63~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh sieve. Lithified material was crushed to ${\sim}0.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ pieces, occasionally heated in a Calgon/hydrogen peroxide solution, and the n sieved as above. All samples were dried on a ${<}60^{\circ}C$ hot plate. Drie d samples were sieved over a $150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve, retaining the ${<}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ siz e fraction for additional observation when necessary. When lithifie d sediments occurred, samples were also sieved using a $500\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mes h to facilitate foraminifer picking and identification. The ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size-fraction specimens were examined under a Zeiss Discovery V 8 microscope. In addition, mudline samples were taken from at leas t one hole from each site and analyzed for planktonic and benthi c foraminifers and ostracods. Mudline samples were collected b y emptying the sediment/water material that sometimes spills ou t from the top of the core liner of the mudline core (Core 1H in eac h hole) when laid horizontally in the core receiving platform into  a bucket and then washing it with tap water over a $63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ wire mes h sieve. Tests using Rose Bengal $(1{\mathrm{~g/L}})$ were performed to confir m the presence of living ostracods and planktonic and benthic foraminifers in the mudline sample. For this, a portion of the sampl e was incubated for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ with Rose Bengal stain before being washe d on a $63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve. All samples were then dried in a low-temperatur e oven at ${\sim}50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and subsequently examined under a light microscope. Selected samples and microfossil specimens were also examined and imaged using the shipboard SEM.  

The total abundance of foraminifers was defined as follows, fo r both planktonic and benthic foraminifers:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( $530\%$ foraminifer specimens in total residue).   
$C=$ common $\underline{{10\%}}{-30\%}$ foraminifer specimens in total residue).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $\!\!\:(1\%\!-\!10\%$ foraminifer specimens in total residue).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present ( $1\%$ foraminifer specimens in total residue).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no foraminifer specimens in total residue).  

Individual species of foraminifers were recorded in qualitativ e terms based on an assessment of forms observed in a random sample from the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction. For planktonic foraminifers, w e mainly focused on the key species to date the sequences. For benthic foraminifers, we focused on the species that provide age control as well as paleobathymetry. Relative abundances were reported using the following categories:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!30\%$ of the assemblage).   
$C=$ common $(10\%{-}30\%)$ ).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(1\%{-}10\%)$ .   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present $(<\!1\%)$ .  

Preservation of foraminifer assemblages was recorded as follows:  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (no evidence of breakage or dissolution).   
$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ $580\%$ of specimens unbroken with only minor evidence of diagenetic alteration).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate $(30\%{-}80\%$ of the specimens unbroken).   
$\Gamma={\mathsf{p o o r}}$ (strongly recrystallized or dominated by fragments and broken or corroded specimens).   
${\mathrm{VP}}=$ very poor (strong recrystallization, only a few specimens can be identified)  

The information included in the tables generated for each sit e was transferred to DESClogik to be stored in the IODP data sets an d is also included in each site report.  

# Ostracods  

Sample preparation for ostracod examination and illustratio n followed the same techniques as for planktonic and benthic foraminifers. Representative ostracod taxa were imaged using the shipboard SEM. Ostracod taxonomic assignments follow Hartman n (1978), Jellinek (1993), and Mostafawi et al. (2005).  

Abundance of ostracods was noted as follows:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( $_{>30}$ specimens per sample).   
$C=$ common (10–30 specimens per sample).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $_{<10}$ specimens per sample).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren.  

The preservation status of ostracods was estimated as follows:  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (valves translucent; no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
$G=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (valves semitranslucent; little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (common but minor calcite overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ poor (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, or fragmentation of the valves).  

In addition, the presence of pteropods, fish teeth, sponge spicules, and other bioclasts in the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions of the cor e catcher samples was noted as follows:  

$C=$ common $^{>5}$ specimens per sample).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1–5 specimens per sample).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren.  

Abundance estimates of the radiolarian assemblage are qualitative estimates of the concentration of radiolarians in individual sediment samples, using the following categories. The size of eac h sample is constant throughout this expedition.  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( ${>}100$ specimens in a sample).   
$C=$ common (51–100 specimens in a sample).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few (11–50 specimens in a sample).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1–10 specimens in a sample).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (0 specimens in a sample).  

Abundance of individual radiolarian species was recorded a s follows:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $J16\%$ of the radiolarian assemblage).   
$C{=}$ common $(4\%{-}16\%$ of the radiolarian assemblage).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $\langle1\%{-}4\%$ of the radiolarian assemblage).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $\langle0.2\%{-}1\%$ of the radiolarian assemblage).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present $(\mathrm{-}0.2\%$ of the radiolarian assemblage).  

Preservation of the radiolarian assemblage was recorded as follows:  

$G=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (majority of specimens complete with no or minor dissolution, recrystallization, and/or breakage).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (minor but common dissolution with a small amount of breakage of specimens).   
$\mathbb{P}=\mathbf{poor}$ (strong dissolution, recrystallization, or breakage; many specimens unidentifiable).  

# Geochemistry  

# Radiolarians  

Radiolarian biostratigraphy was mainly based on the zonation o f Sanfilippo and Nigrini (1998), which uses the FOs and LOs of ke y species. These datums are correlated to the timescale of Gradstei n et al. (2012) and given in Table T1. For Pleistocene sections, we use d the more specific radiolarian zonation for the South China Sea defined by Wang and Abelmann (2002). Taxonomic concepts for radiolarian species are mainly based on Moore (1995), Chen and Ta n (1996), Sanfilippo and Nigrini (1998), Nigrini and Sanfilippo (2001), and Takahashi (1991).  

Gradstein et al. (2012) ages were assigned to all tropical radiolarian datums. All other datums were converted to Gradstein et al. (2012) from previous geologic timescales.  

# Methods  

Sample preparation for light microscopy observation was conducted as follows:  

1. Core catcher sediment was sieved and rinsed using a $45\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh sieve.   
2. When needed, samples were processed with $10\%$ hydrogen peroxide $(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2})$ and $15\%$ hydrochloric acid (HCl) to remove calcium carbonate and clay infillings and sieved over a $45\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh sieve.   
3. Residues were pipetted on a glass slide and then dried and mounted with Norland optical adhesive and a cover glass.   
4. The adhesive was solidified by placing the slide under UV light for ${\sim}15\;\mathrm{min}$ .   
5. Slides were partially examined at $50\times$ to $400\times$ magnification for stratigraphic markers and other common taxa using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope.  

The shipboard geochemistry program for Expedition 359 included measurements for  

• Headspace gas content;   
• IW composition;   
• Sedimentary geochemistry including total inorganic carbon (TIC), total carbon, total nitrogen, and major and minor element contents; and   
• XRD composition.  

These analyses were carried out to satisfy routine shipboard safet y and pollution prevention requirements, characterize IW and sediment geochemistry for shipboard interpretation, and provide a basis for sampling for shore-based research. Future shore-base d research will include the interpretation of (1) carbonate diagenesi s in a setting in which a majority of sediments are derived from shallow-water platforms and are therefore composed of aragonite an d high-Mg calcite (HMC), rather than low-Mg calcite (LMC), and (2 ) the geochemical history of organic and inorganic proxies. The dat a will therefore supplement materials collected from previous OD P expeditions that studied similar processes at other carbonate platforms including the Maldives (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1988), th e Bahamas (Palmer, Austin, and Schlager, 1986; Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 1997b), the Great Barrier Reef (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1991), and the Great Australian Bight (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2000).  

# Interstitial water chemistry  

During Expedition 359, the standard IODP analytical protocol s were employed for major and trace element analyses in the pore fluids. In this context, major elements are Na, Cl, Ca, K, S, and Mg, an d trace elements are the remainder of elements measured (Sr, Ba, B,  

Li, Si, Mn, P, N, V, and Fe). In most cases, elements exist mainly a s their free ionic form; for example, the calcium concentration is referred to as $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ concentration. In some instances where the valence state of an element or the nature of its complex is uncertain, however, the element is referred to without a charge balance. Fo r example, iron is referred to as Fe rather than $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ . Sulfur exists mainly as $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ , B as $\mathrm{B(OH)_{4}}^{-}$ , Si as $\mathrm{Si(OH)}_{4}{}^{0}$ , and $\mathrm{P}$ as $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ .  

# Sample collection  

Routine IW samples were obtained by squeezing whole-roun d sections cut from cores. Standard whole-round samples were $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ long, but as water content decreased downhole, the size of th e whole-round samples increased to $15\,\mathrm{cm}$ to enable extraction of th e ${\sim}30~\mathrm{mL}$ of water needed for shipboard and shore-based analyses. Whole-round samples were cut and capped as quickly as possibl e after the core arrived on deck and immediately moved to the chemistry laboratory for squeezing. Whole-round samples were typicall y collected at a frequency of one sample per core for the top ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , and then one sample for every three cores to the maximum drillin g depth or until IW extraction required a $>\!15\ \mathrm{cm}$ whole-round section to preserve core for visual core description and other sampling. The exterior of the whole-round sample was carefully cleaned wit h a spatula to remove potential contamination from drilling fluid. Fo r XCB cores, the intruded drilling mud between biscuits was also removed to eliminate contamination. The cleaned sediment wa s placed into a 9 cm diameter titanium squeezer that was then place d in a Carver hydraulic press (Manheim and Sayles, 1974) an d squeezed at pressures up to 35,000 lb $\left({\sim}17\ \mathrm{MPa}\right)$ ). The squeezed I W was collected into an HCl- and water-washed $_{\leftmoon}18\ \mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm}\right)$ highdensity polyethylene (HDPE) syringe attached to the squeezing assembly and subsequently filtered through a $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ polyethersulfone membrane filter into various sample containers. For Site s U1466 and U1467, IW was collected both by squeezing wholeround samples and Rhizon samplers (Tada et al., 2015b). Wholeround samples were taken once per core, with one to two Rhizo n samples per section to obtain high-resolution IW depth profiles fo r the upper $40\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. Rhizon sampling for IW lasted for $\sim\!2\mathrm{-}$ $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to obtain ${\sim}20~\mathrm{mL}$ water samples for shore-based analyses.  

Sample allocation was determined based on the pore fluid volume obtained and analytical priorities based on expedition objectives. Aliquots for analysis by ICP-AES were acidified by adding ${\sim}10$ $\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of trace metal–grade concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and placed in $4~\mathrm{mL}$ cryovials. Aliquots for titration and ion chromatography (IC) analyses were put in $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ HDPE vials. Aliquots for dissolved inorgani c carbon (DIC) and its $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ were treated with $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of saturated Hg$\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ solution and placed in glass ampules that were subsequentl y sealed with a torch. Aliquots for other isotopic analyses (e.g., oxyge n isotopes) were also placed into $2~\mathrm{mL}$ sealed glass ampules. Aliquot s for total $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ were placed in $2~\mathrm{mL}$ septum screw-lid glass vials wit h $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ of $20\%$ zinc acetate solution. Samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ after collection.  

After IW extraction was complete, sediment squeeze cakes wer e divided and sealed in plastic bags for shipboard and shore-base d analyses. Squeeze cake samples were refrigerated at $4^{\circ}C$ .  

# Shipboard analysis  

IW samples were analyzed on board following the protocols i n Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately afte r squeezing, following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinit y was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handhel d refractometer. Alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with a n autotitrator (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) on $3\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sample usin g $0.1\,\mathrm{M}$ HCl at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ and $\mathsf{p H}$ was measured with a combination glas s electrode. International Association for the Physical Sciences of th e Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater was used for calibration an d was analyzed at the beginning and end of a set of samples for eac h site and after every ${\sim}10$ samples. Alkalinity titrations had a precision better than $2\%$ based on repeated analysis of IAPSO standar d seawater. For sample volumes $\leq\!15\ \mathrm{mL}$ , alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ were no t measured.  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were analyzed immediately after th e IW sample was obtained. For the first three sites (U1465–U1467), the default settings for $\mathsf{p H}$ measurement were used. In essence, th e pH-meter program waited for the $\mathsf{p H}$ reading to stabilize, and if i t did not do so to the parameters set by the software, it took the reading after an interval of $10\;\mathrm{min}$ and proceed with titration. As samples are retrieved from depth they are initially under highe r pressure and contain higher concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . At th e surface, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ degases from the sample, causing $\mathsf{p H}$ to change continually. Eventually, given sufficient time, $\mathsf{p H}$ will reflect equilibriu m with laboratory $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels. Over the $10\;\mathrm{min}$ the alkalinity progra m waits for $\mathsf{p H}$ to stabilize, during which the sample is continually agitated, $\mathsf{p H}$ continually rises from low values representative of thos e in situ to higher values. We considered $10\ \mathrm{min}$ to be too long an d reduced it to $120~\mathrm{s}$ for samples collected from Sites U1468–U1472. This time is somewhat arbitrary, but we feel that it provides mor e meaningful data than the $10\;\mathrm{min}$ default.  

# Chloride by titration  

High-precision analyses of chloride concentrations were carrie d out on $0.5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sample diluted with $30~\mathrm{mL}$ of an $80\mathrm{~mM~HNO}_{3}$ solution by titration with a $0.1\,\mathrm{M}$ silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ solution using a Metrohm 785 DMP autotitrator and calibrated against repeated titrations of an IAPSO standard. Repeated analyses of a n IAPSO standard yielded a precision better than $0.05\%$ ; however, chloride concentrations yielded by titration include not only dissolved chloride but also all of the other halide elements and bisulfide. In addition, chloride was determined by IC (Metrohm 85 0 Profession IC).  

# Sulfate, chloride, bromide, calcium, magnesium, and sodium  

Concentrations of sulfate $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ , chloride $\left(C\mathrm{I}^{-}\right)$ , bromide $\left(\mathbf{B}\mathbf{r}^{-}\right)$ calcium $(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+})$ , magnesium $(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+})$ , and sodium $\left(\mathbf{Na}^{+}\right)$ were analyzed by IC (Metrohm 850 Professional IC) using aliquots of $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ diluted 1:100 with deionized water $(18\ \mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm})$ ). At the beginnin g and end of each run, different dilutions of IAPSO standard seawate r were analyzed for quality control and to determine accuracy an d precision.  

# Ammonium and phosphate  

Concentrations of ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$ and phosphate $\mathrm{(PO}_{4}^{\;3-})$ were determined using an Agilent Technologies Cary Series 10 0 UV-Vis spectrophotometer with a sipper sample introduction system following the protocol in Gieskes et al. (1991). For analysis o f $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ concentrations, a $0.1\ \mathrm{mL}$ sample aliquot was diluted with  1 mL of deionized water, to which $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ phenol ethanol, $0.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ sodium nitroprusside, and $1~\mathrm{mL}$ oxidizing solution (trisodium citrat e and sodium hydroxide) were added in a $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ capped glass vial. Th e solution was kept at room temperature for ${\sim}6.5\,\mathrm{h}$ to allow the colo r to develop. Intensities were determined at an absorbance of $640\;\mathrm{nm}$ . Precision and accuracy of the $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ analyses were within $2.5\%$ an d $3\%$ , respectively.  

For the analysis of $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ , a $0.3\;\mathrm{mL}$ sample was diluted with $1\,\mathrm{mL}$ deionized water $(18\ \mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm})$ in a $4~\mathrm{mL}$ glass vial. Then $2~\mathrm{mL}$ o f mixed reagent (ammonium molybdate, sulfuric acid, ascorbic acid, and potassium antimony tartrate) was added to the vial, which wa s capped and kept at room temperature for at least several minutes t o develop color. Concentrations of $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\;3-}$ were determined at an absorbance of $885~\mathrm{nm}\sim\!30~\mathrm{i}$ min after adding the mixed reagent solution. Precision and accuracy of $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\;3-}$ analyses were better than $2\%$ and $2\%$ , respectively.  

# Major and minor elements  

Dissolved major and minor elements were determined using  a Leeman ICP-AES. For major cation $(\mathrm{Na}^{+},\mathrm{K}^{+},\mathrm{Ca}^{2+},$ , and ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ ) analyses, dilutions of IAPSO standard seawater were used as calibratio n standards. Standards and acidified samples were diluted $1{:}100\ \mathrm{(v/v)}$ with a $2\%\,\mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ (by volume) solution (matrix) with Y at $10\;\mathrm{ppm}\;\mathbf{a};$ s an internal standard. Calibration for minor elements $(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ , B, Si, $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ , and $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ ) was done with dilutions of a multielemen t synthetic standard solution composed of mixed single-elemen t standards. Acidified samples measured for minor elements on th e ICP-AES were diluted $1{:}20\ (\mathbf{v}/\mathbf{v})$ with the same matrix used for major element analysis. Drift correction was made for both major an d minor elements using the factor from a drift monitor solutio n $100\%$ IAPSO for majors and $100\%$ stock solution for minors) tha t was analyzed every eight samples. The ICP-AES autosampler an d analysis chamber were rinsed with a $3\%$ (by volume) $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solutio n between samples. Major cations $(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , and $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ ) were als o determined by IC at 1:100 dilution.  

# Headspace gas geochemistry  

One sediment sample $\langle{\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}\rangle$ from each core, collected immediately after core retrieval, was placed in a $20~\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ glass vial an d sealed with a crimped metal cap with a septum. When consolidate d or lithified samples were encountered, chips of material were place d in the vial and sealed. If an IW sample was obtained, the headspac e sample was taken from the top of the section immediately next t o the IW sample whenever possible. The vial was labeled with th e core, section, and interval from which the sample was taken an d placed in an oven at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ . A $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ volume of gas extracted through the septum was then injected with a gas-tight glas s syringe into a gas chromatograph.  

The gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 equipped electronic pressure control and a flame ionization detector) was set at $250^{\circ}C$ an d used to accurately and rapidly measure concentrations of methan e $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethylene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propylene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ . A $2.4\:\mathrm{m}\times\:2.0\:\mathrm{mm}$ stainless steel column packed with 80/100 mes h HayeSep ${}^{\ast}\mathbf{R}^{\ast}$ is installed in the oven. The injector consists of a $^{1\!}/\!_{16}$ inch Valco union with a $7\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ screen connected to a Valco-to-Luerlock syringe adaptor. This injector connects to a 10-port Valco valv e that was switched pneumatically by a digital valve interface. The injector temperature was set at $120^{\circ}C$ . Samples were introduced int o the gas chromatograph through a $0.25~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample loop connecte d to the Valco valve. The valve can be switched automatically to backflush the column. The oven temperature was programmed to star t at $80^{\circ}C$ for $8.25\,\mathrm{min}$ and then increase to $150^{\circ}C$ for $5\,\mathrm{{min}}$ at a rate o f $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ . Helium was used as the carrier gas. Initial helium flow i n the column was $30~\mathrm{mL/min}$ . Flow was ramped to $60~\mathrm{mL/min}$ afte r $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ to accelerate elution of $C_{3}$ and $C_{3=}$ . Run time was $15\,\mathrm{min}$ .  

# Sediment geochemistry  

# Sedimentary inorganic and organic carbon content  

Sediment samples were collected from IW squeeze cakes, wit h additional samples taken from intervals of distinct lithology. Samples were freeze-dried for ${\sim}24~\mathrm{h}$ , crushed using an agate pestle an d mortar, and then analyzed for total carbon, TIC, and total nitrogen.  

Total carbon and total nitrogen of sediment samples were determined with a Thermo Electron Corporation Flash EA 1112 CHN S elemental analyzer equipped with a Thermo Electron packed column CHNS/NCS gas chromatograph and a thermal conductivit y detector. Approximately $10{-}15~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighed into  a tin cup and then combusted at $950^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in a stream of oxygen. The reaction gases were passed through a reduction chamber to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and were then separated by the ga s chromatograph before detection by thermal conductivity detector. All measurements were calibrated to a standard (Soil Reference Material NC [PN 33840025]) run every 10 samples. Peak areas from th e thermal conductivity detector were calculated to determine the total carbon and total nitrogen of the samples.  

TIC was determined using a Coulometrics $5015\,\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Approximately $10~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighed into a glass vial and acidified with $2\,\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{HCl}$ . The liberated $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was titrated, and th e corresponding change in light transmittance in the coulometric cell was monitored using a photodetection cell. The weight percent o f calcium carbonate was calculated from the inorganic carbon content using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\left(w t\%\right)\times100/12.}
$$  

This equation assumes that all carbonate is present as calcium carbonate, which can result in overestimates of carbonate conten t when dolomite is present. Where significant amounts $(\mathrm{>}10\%)$ of dolomite were identified using XRD data, carbonate content wa s scaled appropriately to reflect this contribution.  

A weighed amount of standard calcium carbonate (standard reference material) was used to confirm accuracy. Total organic carbon content was calculated by subtraction of inorganic carbon fro m total carbon.  

# Elemental analysis of bulk sediment/sedimentary rock by ICP-AES  

Major, minor, and trace element analyses were performed on al l squeeze cake samples. Because the types of sediment were expecte d to contain greater than $90\%$ carbonate, we dissolved approximatel y $10\;\mathrm{mg}$ of sample in $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}$ of $4\%$ acetic acid solution and $5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of $4\%$ nitric acid and assumed that all major and trace elements were derived from the dissolution of calcium carbonate. After digestion, th e samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was pipetted into  a sample vial prior to being analyzed using a Leeman ICP-AES.  

# Standardization and data reduction  

Standardization was achieved using a matrix-matched approac h in which standard solutions that spanned concentrations expecte d in the carbonate samples were prepared. Additional standard solutions were prepared with high magnesium content to permit calibration of samples containing dolomite. A blank solution was als o prepared that consisted of equal volume amounts of $2\%$ acetic an d $2\%$ nitric acid. Concentrations of elements in the solutions were calculated by developing equations between intensity and concentrations from the standards. Because concentrations of Ca, Sr, and $\mathrm{Mg}$ were significantly above background values, intensity values for th e blank solutions were not incorporated into the relationship betwee n intensity and concentration. For the other elements analyzed (Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Fe, K, Mn, Na, P, and V), the background value of th e blank solution was used to calculate the calibration line. Changes i n intensity as a function of instrument drift were corrected by th e analysis of a standard carbonate material every 10 samples. Corrections for the actual amount of carbonate in the samples were derived from percent carbonate data, and trace and minor elementa l data are reported as molar ratios relative to calcium.  

# X-ray diffraction  

Samples were prepared for XRD analysis to make qualitative t o semiquantitative bulk mineral estimates. XRD results combine d with smear slide estimates and visual descriptions were used to assist in lithologic classification. In general, one $2.5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample wa s routinely taken from the squeeze cake IW sample. Additional limited samples were taken and analyzed based on visual core descriptions (e.g., color variability and visual changes in lithology an d texture) and smear slides. Samples analyzed for bulk mineralog y were freeze-dried and ground by hand (soft sediment) or in an agat e ball mill (rock) as necessary. Prepared samples were top-mounte d onto a sample holder and analyzed using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor diffractometer mounted with a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtere d CuKα radiation. The standard locked coupled scan was as follows:  

Voltage $=40\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
Goniometer $\mathrm{\scan}=20^{\circ}–40^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
Step size $=0.0087^{\circ}26$ .   
Scan speed $=0.2\;\mathbf{s}_{I}$ /step.   
Divergence slit $=0.3\;\mathrm{mm}$ .  

Diffractograms of bulk samples were evaluated with the aid o f the EVA software package, which allowed for mineral identificatio n and basic peak characterization (e.g., baseline removal and maximum peak intensity). Files were created that contained d-spacin g values, diffraction angles, and peak intensities with background removed. The peak areas of the appropriate major peaks for aragonit e (1,1,1), quartz (1,0,1), LMC (1,0,4), HMC (1,0,4), and dolomit e (1,0,4) were determined, and the percentage of the minerals was calculated using the approach of Swart et al. (2002). In this method, i t is assumed that the entire sample is composed only of these fiv e minerals and the ratios of the peak areas aragonite, quartz, dolomite, and HMC relative to the areas of HMC and LMC are plotte d relative to the same ratios in weighed standards. From these relationships, the ratios of the unknown minerals are calculated an d their percentage determined in the sample. The relative percentag e error on this method is approximately $\pm10\%$ . Because these standards were not available during the time the samples were measured aboard the JOIDES Resolution, the relationships calculate d using the X-ray diffractometer at the University of Miami (USA; Panalytical X-pert Pro) were used. Shore-based analysis of Sit e U1466 samples showed that the Miami instrument provided concentrations similar to those provided by the shipboard instrument. In some samples, the mineral celestine was also identified, but n o attempt was made to quantify its abundance using XRD. Digital file s with diffraction patterns are available from the LIMS databas e (http://iodp.tamu.edu/tasapps).  

# Rationale for geochemical analyses  

# Fluids  

The rationale for studying any of these species in the pore fluid s is that their concentrations provide information about diageneti c processes currently taking place in the sedimentary system (Swart, 2015). Major, minor, and trace elements can be fundamentally separated into two classes: conservative and nonconservative species. Conservative species include $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ , Cl–, $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ , $\mathrm{{B}(O H)_{4}-}$ , and $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ ; the y generally do not participate in reactions involving precipitation o f carbonate minerals or oxidation of organic matter. Most other elements are nonconservative. Calcium is nonconservative because a s calcium carbonate is dissolved, the concentration of $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ in th e pore fluids increases, and when it is precipitated, its concentratio n decreases. Because the salinity of the pore fluids might change as  a result of diffusion of fluids with differing salinities, concentration o f $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ can be altered without involving the precipitation or dissolution of carbonate. It is therefore convenient to normalize concentrations of $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ and other elements that are involved in carbonat e reactions, such as $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ , to a conservative ion such as $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ and report changes relative to $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ (i.e., $C\mathrm{a}^{2+}/C\mathrm{l}^{-}$ , $\mathrm{Mg^{2+}/C l^{-}}$ , an d $\mathrm{Sr^{2+}/C l^{-}}$ ratios). In addition, because the distribution coefficient s $(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{Sr}}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{Mg}},$ ) of minor elements such as $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ and ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ are typicall y different for the formation of diagenetic minerals such as calcite an d dolomite, it is useful to calculate changes in $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}/\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Mg^{2+}/C a^{2+}}$ , and $\mathrm{Li^{+}}/{\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}$ ratios in pore waters. Increases in the $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}/\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ratio, for example, indicate the formation of minerals such as LMC an d dolomite, which have lower $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{Sr}}$ values than the precursor minerals:  

$$
\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{Sr}}=(\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{carbonate}})/(\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}/\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}_{\mathrm{fluid}}).
$$  

Changes in concentrations of redox-sensitive elements (Mn an d Fe) reflect changes in oxidation state and their subsequent incorporation in diagenetic carbonates. For example, both Mn and Fe normally exist in seawater as oxidized forms and as such are present i n seawater in very low concentrations. Fe and Mn exist predominantly as insoluble Fe and Mn oxides. During slight reductions in $\mathrm{E_{h}},$ $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ and $M{\Omega}^{4+}$ are reduced to $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $M{{\bf{n}}^{2+}}$ , increasing the concentrations of $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $M{{\bf{n}}^{2+}}$ dissolved within the pore fluids. These divalent forms are more readily incorporated in diagenetic carbonate, thus rapidly reducing their concentrations in the pore fluids as carbonates are precipitated and sediment is buried.  

Barium is often considered to be a nutrient-type element tracking changes in upwelling (Lea et al., 1989). It is easily incorporate d into carbonate because it is similar in ionic radius to $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ .  

The oxidation of organic material can be tracked by examinin g changes in alkalinity, ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , and $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ concentrations in the pore fluids. Sediments high in organic material and with relatively low permeability will undergo bacterial sulfate reduction, using up availabl e $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ and producing alkalinity. At the same time, concentrations o f species such as $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ will increase, related to the degradation of organic material.  

# Sediments  

Although pore fluids are powerful indicators of the diageneti c reactions taking place, they only provide an indication of what i s presently taking place in the pore fluids or what took place in th e recent past. Many assume that the present measured pore wate r profile might have been similar throughout the history of a particular site and have used gradients in various elements and isotopes t o calculate rates of neomorphism and recrystallization (Baker et al., 1982; Richter and DePaolo, 1987). Such an assumption can only b e considered valid if the pore water profiles have not changed, an assumption which is unlikely in sediments deposited adjacent to shallow-water carbonate systems, which are subjected to sea leve l changes, hiatuses in deposition, and erosion. Sediments lock i n changes related to diagenesis, which occurred at the time of alteration, and therefore bulk chemistry reflects a combination of th e original sediment and some diagenetic contribution. It is therefor e valuable to examine the same elements that were measured in th e pore fluids and assess changes in light of what has been learned ove r several decades of pore water studies during the Deep Sea Drillin g Project (DSDP), ODP, and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Progra m by numerous investigators (Baker, 1986; Gieskes, 1973; Kastner an d Gieskes, 1976; Kramer et al., 2000; Lawrence et al., 1975; McDuff, 1981; Presley and Kaplan, 1971; Swart and Burns, 1990). Thes e studies characterize the behavior of minor and trace elements unde r numerous hydrologic scenarios, some of which can be applied t o data from Expedition 359. Assessment of elemental changes in th e sediment can therefore provide information on the timing and environments of sediment diagenesis.  

In sediments mainly composed of calcium, carbon, and oxyge n (carbonates), these elements are considered major elements. Th e minor elements are Sr, Mg, and Na, and the remainder are considered trace elements. During Expedition 359, we measured Al, K, Ba, B, Li, Mn, Si, Co, Cr, V, and Fe in addition to minor and major elements. Elements are reported relative to Ca as molar ratios (e.g., $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Mg/Ca)}$ .  

An example of how Sr might be expected to behave in carbonates is as follows. Normal calcitic and aragonitic sediments have relatively high Sr concentrations. Coccoliths and many foraminifer s are LMC, with Sr contents of $\mathord{\sim}1000$ to $1200\ \mathrm{ppm}$ , whereas aragonitic sediments typically have values above $7000\ \mathrm{ppm}$ . In contrast, diagenetic LMC has much lower concentrations of Sr, and therefor e as these Sr-rich allochems dissolve and LMC or dolomite forms, S r is rejected and accumulates in the pore fluids. Typically this proces s is reflected by increased $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}/\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ratios in the pore fluids. Consequently, diagenetic carbonates formed from this fluid will hav e higher $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratios than those formed from normal seawater. Similar principles hold with other elements, but if the distribution coefficient of an element is greater than unity, then the concentration o f the elements will decrease as recrystallization or neomorphism progresses. This is the case for elements such as Mn and Fe. Examination of such patterns helps to ascertain the nature of the pas t diagenetic regime.  

# Paleomagnetism  

We conducted paleomagnetic studies primarily to determine directions of remanence components. Routine measurements wer e completed on all archive halves with stepwise alternating field (AF ) demagnetization. Discrete cube samples were taken from selecte d working halves and were measured with stepwise AF demagnetization. We also performed isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM ) acquisition experiments on selected samples to define the magneti c carrier. These data were used to support magnetostratigraphic dating and define rock magnetic properties. The low-field mass normalized  magnetic  susceptibility  and  anisotropy  of  magneti c susceptibility (AMS) was also measured on discrete cubes to gathe r information on possible sedimentation flattening (namely compaction due to the weight of overlying sediments) and paleocurrent direction and strength.  

# Magnetic measurements  

Remanent magnetization was measured using a superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) (2G Enterprises model 760R ) equipped with direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and an in-line automated AF demagnetize r capable of reaching a peak field of $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ Ocean drilling cores generally carry secondary remanence components (overprints), including natural viscous remanence and a steep downward-pointin g component attributed to the drill string. To separate the overprint s from the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM), stepwis e demagnetization experiments were performed as described below.  

# Archive-half sections  

Measurements of archive halves were conducted using the SR M software for every section (version 1.0) with a nominal sample-are a parameter of $15.59~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ . The measurement interval varied betwee n 5 and $15~\mathrm{cm}$ depending on core flow, with speed of $10~\mathrm{cm/s}$ . Th e response functions of the pick-up coils of the SQUID sensors have  a full width of $7{-}8\,\mathrm{cm}$ at half height (Parker and Gee, 2002); therefore, except for the $5\ \mathrm{cm}$ interval, each measurement is independen t from the adjacent ones. Data collected within ${\sim}4\ \mathrm{{cm}}$ of piec e boundaries (or voids) are significantly affected by edge effects. Consequently, all data points within $4.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ of piece boundaries (as documented in the curatorial record) were filtered out prior to furthe r processing. It should be noted that edge effects may also occur in  a contiguous core piece if substantial heterogeneity in intensity i s present in the piece. These heterogeneities can sometimes be detected examining a plot of natural remanent magnetization (NRM ) intensity.  

We performed progressive AF demagnetization using the in-lin e AF demagnetizer of the SRM (2G Enterprises model 2G600) on all archive sections. The in-line AF demagnetizer applies a field to th e $x_{\mathrm{~}},\,y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ , and $z$ -axes of the SRM in this fixed order. Previous report s suggest that higher AF demagnetization fields produce significan t anhysteretic remanent magnetization along the $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axis of the SRM. With this limitation, we performed steps from NRM to $40~\mathrm{{mT}}$ demagnetization. If needed, AF demagnetization results were plotte d individually as vector plots (Zijderveld, 1967). We analyzed th e stepwise demagnetization data by principal component analyse s (PCA) to define ChRM (Kirschvink, 1980). More often, paleomagnetic data were interpreted using blanket demagnetization at $30\,\mathrm{mT}$ . We inspected plots visually to judge whether the remanence afte r demagnetization at the highest AF step reflects the ChRM and geomagnetic polarity sequence.  

# Discrete samples  

Discrete samples representative of lithology were collected fro m working-half sections. In soft sediment, discrete samples were take n in plastic “Japanese” Natsuhara-Giken sampling cubes ( $7~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample volume). Cubes were pushed by hand into the working half o f the core with the “up” arrow on the cube pointing upsection. Fo r indurated intervals, cubes were cut with a table saw or cylinder s were drilled from the working halves. The NRM of discrete sample s was measured using a spinner magnetometer (AGICO model JR6A).  

In discrete samples, we performed stepwise AF demagnetization using the DTech AF demagnetizer (model D-2000) up to $90\;\mathrm{mT}$

and measured them using the spinner measurements. We also performed a few acquisitions of IRM up to 1 T using the ASC-Scientifi c Model IM-10 impulse magnetizer to investigate the magnetic mineralogy of the sediments to decipher which magnetic mineral carries the magnetization. Section-half and discrete data collected o n the pass-through SRM were uploaded to the LIMS database. W e also analyzed the stepwise demagnetization data by PCA to defin e ChRM (Kirschvink, 1980).  

Low-field magnetic susceptibility of both whole rounds and spli t sections (see Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology and Physica l properties) was routinely measured to roughly indicate the presence of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic minerals. Low-field mas s normalized magnetic susceptibility and AMS measurements wer e made on an AGICO KLY 4S Kappabridge instrument using the Sufar (AGICO) software. The KLY 4S Kappabridge measures AMS b y rotating the sample along three axes, stacking the data, and calculating the best-fit second-order tensor. It also measures the volumenormalized, calibrated bulk susceptibility $(\upchi)$ .

# Coordinates  

All magnetic data are reported relative to IODP orientation conventions (Figure F9): $+x$ is into the face of the working half, $+y$ points toward the left side of the face of the working half, and $+z$ points downsection. The relationship between the SRM coordinate s $(X,\,Y,$ and $Z$ ) and the data coordinates $(x,\,y,$ and $z)$ is $x=X,y=-Y,$ and $z=Z$ for archive halves and $x=-X,y=Y,$ and $z=Z$ for workin g halves. The coordinate systems for the spinner magnetometer an d Natsuhara-Giken sampling cubes are indicated in Figure F10.  

# Core orientation  

When possible, APC core orientation was measured with an orientation tool (Icefield MI-5) mounted on the core barrel. The too l consists of three mutually perpendicular fluxgate magnetic sensor s and two perpendicular gravity sensors. The information from bot h sets of sensors allows the azimuth and dip of the hole to be measured, as well as the azimuth of the APC core orientation. Orientation information was fundamental for paleomagnetic polarit y determinations and magnetostratigraphic interpretations at lowlatitude sites such as the cores from the Maldives $(4^{\circ}40^{\prime}{-}4^{\circ}50^{\prime}\mathrm{N})$ ; however, we noticed that the orientation data collected were no t very reliable.  

![](images/e5363194677fd10c9a0520b24acb6ca3f3cb3e00e3b6b4251b17abc2d96378f9.jpg)  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Magnetostratigraphy for each site was constructed by correlating observed polarity sequences with the geomagnetic polarit y timescale in combination with biostratigraphic datums. We adopte d the geomagnetic polarity timescale of Gradstein et al. (2012), i n which boundary ages for Chrons C1n–C13n and ${\mathrm{C}}24{\mathrm{n}}.1{\mathrm{n}}{\mathrm{-}}{\mathrm{C}}34{\mathrm{n}}$ are orbitally tuned and those for Chrons C13r–C23r are spline fitted.  

For azimuthally unoriented samples from sedimentary rock deposited at low latitudes, determining the polarity of sedimentar y units can be challenging. Polarity ambiguity arises when sample s are azimuthally unoriented and the inclination is shallow in subequatorial sites (the angular distance between reversed and normal polarity inclinations is small) (Figure F11). Very often, the large dispersion around the mean inclination value observed in these sediment cores introduced large uncertainty in the determination o f magnetic polarity (e.g., McFadden and Reid, 1982; Cox and Gordon,  

![](images/0e8d845cd9d3468aee720a414557c591cf1a3681861e27c23371d08d6d65ee1a.jpg)  
Figure F11. Paleolatitude reconstruction for the Maldives sites (Torsvik et al., 2012) used during Expedition 359.  

1984); therefore, the results should be used with caution as a definitive estimate of magnetic polarity. Additional problems can aris e from inclination anomalies due to nondipole fields, which bias th e inclinations at low latitudes (e.g., Schneider and Kent, 1998).  

Whenever possible, we offer an interpretation of the magneti c polarity following the naming convention of correlative anomal y numbers prefaced by the letter C (Tauxe et al., 1984). Normal polarity subchrons are referred to by adding suffixes (n1, n2, etc.) tha t increase with age. For the younger part of the timescale (Pliocene– Pleistocene), we use traditional names to refer to the various chron s and subchrons (e.g., Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, etc.). In general, polarity reversals occurring at core section ends have been treate d with extreme caution.  

# Physical properties  

High-resolution physical property measurements were made t o petrophysically characterize sediments and rocks recovered durin g Expedition 359. These data also complement lithostratigraphic descriptions and help tie sediment/rock properties to downhole logging data and seismic profiles. In particular, physical property dat a play a major role in hole-to-hole and site-to-site stratigraphic correlation, discontinuity/inhomogeneity detection, compositional an d textural differences, major seismic reflection identification, an d construction of synthetic seismic profiles. A variety of petrophysica l techniques and methods were used to characterize whole-rounds, split cores, and discrete samples. Procedures for measuring sediment or hard rock cores differ slightly. The sampling plan for th e Expedition 359 is summarized in Table T2.  

# Sedimentary cores  

Recovered whole-round core sections are traditionally allowe d to equilibrate to ambient room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and pressur e for ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{h}$ in the ship’s Core Laboratory. However, because water bottom temperatures at the relatively shallow water sites cored durin g  

Expedition 359 were close to $15^{\circ}C,$ it was determined that an equilibration period was unnecessary. Therefore, core sections wer e measured for physical properties soon after recovery. First, cor e sections were run through the WRMSL to measure density b y gamma ray attenuation (GRA), magnetic susceptibility, and compressional wave velocity on the $P$ -wave logger (PWL). Cores recovered with the XCB or RCB systems are slightly smaller in diamete r than those cored with the APC system, producing gaps between th e liner and the core. As a result, $P$ -wave velocity was measured wit h the WRMSL on sections cored with the APC system but not alway s measured on sections cored with the XCB or RCB systems. Section s were then measured with the spectral NGRL. Thermal conductivit y was the final measurement made on whole-round sections prior t o splitting them into working and archive halves.  

Archive halves were passed through the SHMSL to measur e point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance. Discrete samples were collected from the working halves (one per section) t o measure wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density using moisture and density (MAD) procedures. $P$ - wave velocity measurements were made on working halves that ha d been sampled for MAD, employing a transducer oriented in the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ - axis direction.  

# Rock cores  

Recovered core sections were run through the WRMSL an d NGRL. Afterward, core sections were split into working and archiv e halves and all rock pieces were labeled. Archive halves were passe d through the SHMSL to measure point magnetic susceptibility an d color reflectance. Thermal conductivity was measured once pe r core using a contact probe on a piece of the section half in a seawater bath. $P_{-}$ -wave velocity measurements were made on discret e samples. Two samples were taken in each section of the workin g half at offsets of 25 and $125\,\mathrm{cm}$ . Some of these samples (one per section) were shared for MAD measurements.  

A full discussion of all methodologies and calculations use d aboard the JOIDES Resolution in the Physical Properties Laborator y is available in Blum (1997). Details and procedures for each physical property measurement are described below.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

GRA-derived bulk density, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, and magnetic susceptibility were measured nondestructively with the WRMSL. T o optimize the measurement process, sampling intervals and measurement integration times were the same for all sensors. Samplin g intervals were set at $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ with an integration time of 2.5 s for eac h measurement. These sampling intervals are common denominator s of the distances between the sensors installed on the WRMSL (30– $50~\mathrm{cm},$ ), which allows sequential and simultaneous measurements. Following the last section in each core, quality assurance/qualit y control (QA/QC) was conducted by passing a single core liner fille d with deionized water through the WRMSL.  

# Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

Bulk density can be used to estimate pore volume and evaluat e the consolidation state of sediment. GRA density is an estimate o f bulk density based on the attenuation of a gamma ray beam. Th e beam is produced by a $^{137}\!C s$ gamma ray source at a radiation level o f 370 MBq within a lead shield with a $5\,\mathrm{mm}$ collimator and is directe d through the whole-round core. The gamma ray detector on the opposite side of the core from the source includes a scintillator and a n integral photomultiplier tube to record the gamma radiation tha t passes through the core. The attenuation of gamma rays occurs primarily by Compton scattering, in which gamma rays are scattere d by electrons in the formation; the degree of scattering is related t o the material bulk density. Therefore, for a known thickness of sample, the density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of the attenuate d gamma rays and can be expressed as

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I/I_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$I=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$\mathrm{I_{0}}=\mathrm{gamma}$ ray source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

# To calculate $\uprho$ from $I,\upmu$ and $\mathrm{I}_{0}$ are treated as constants.  

In general, WRMSL measurements are the most accurate whe n taken on a completely filled core liner with minimal drilling disturbance; otherwise, measurements tend to underestimate true values. By default, the instrument reports measurements using the interna l diameter of the core liner $.66\;\mathrm{mm})$ as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for most sediment cores obtained wit h the APC system; however, for sediment and/or hard rock cored b y the XCB or RCB systems, core diameter is usually about $58\;\mathrm{mm}$ o r less. Following Jarrard and Kerneklian (2007), density measurements of XCB and RCB cores were corrected by multiplying th e density values by $66/58=1.138$ to account for this bias. The spatia l resolution of the GRA densitometer is less than $\pm1\,\mathrm{cm}$ . The gamm a ray detector is calibrated with sealed calibration cores (one standar d core liner filled with distilled water and PVC cylinders of variou s diameters). To establish the calibration curves, gamma ray count s were taken through each water/PVC cylinder for $_{60\ s}$ . Each water/PVC cylinder has a density of $2.7\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and $^d$ is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, o r $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The relationship between $I$ and $\upmu d$ is  

$$
\ln(I)=\mathrm{A}(\upmu d)^{2}+\mathrm{B}(\upmu d)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where A, B, and C are coefficients determined from the calibration. Recalibration was performed as needed when the deionized water QA/QC standard deviated significantly (more than a few percent) from $1\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Low-field magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measur e of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic field:  

$$
\mathrm{\Delta}\mathrm{Y}=M/\mathrm{H},
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field of strength H. Magnetic susceptibility is primarily sensitive t o the concentration of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g., magnetite, hematite, and maghemite), which is significant for understanding the provenance of the sediment and processes that occurred soon after deposition. When ferromagnetic/ferrimagneti c minerals are scarce, magnetic susceptibility may also be sensitive t o paramagnetic and diamagnetic minerals, which can be related t o the origin of the materials and their subsequent diagenesis.  

Measurements were made using a Bartington MS2C loop senso r with a $9\,\mathrm{cm}$ diameter. An oscillator circuit in the sensor, operating a t a frequency of $0.565\ \mathrm{kHz}$ and an AF of ${\sim}140\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}_{:}$ , produces a lowintensity, nonsaturating alternating magnetic field. Sediment o r hard rock core sections going through the influence of this fiel d cause a change in its oscillator frequency. Frequency informatio n returned in pulse to the susceptometer is converted into magneti c susceptibility. The loop sensor has a spatial resolution of $23{-}27\;\mathrm{mm}$ and is accurate to within $2\%$ .  

# P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity data can be used to evaluate small-strain modul i to correlate downhole logging and core data. $P.$ -wave velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ i s defined by the time required for a compressional wave to travel  a specific distance:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=\mathrm{d}/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where d is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is th e traveltime through the core.  

The PWL measures the traveltime of $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasonic wave s horizontally through the core at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals while the core remains in the core liner. Waves are transmitted to the core by plasti c transducer contacts connected to linear actuators. Pressure is applied to the actuators to ensure good coupling between the transducers and the core liner. $P$ -wave velocity transducers measure th e total traveltime of the compressional wave between transducers.  

The wave travels horizontally through the whole core and core liner. The total observed traveltime $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is composed of  

$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry,   
$t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure,   
$t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner, and   
$t_{\mathrm{core}}=$ traveltime through the sediment.  

The system is calibrated using a core liner filled with distille d water, which provides control for $t_{\mathrm{delay}},\ t_{\mathrm{pulse}},$ and $t_{\mathrm{liner}}$ . From thes e calibrations, $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ can be calculated for whole-round specimens i n core liners:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{cl}}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{\mathrm{o}}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{cl}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner, $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness, and $t_{\mathrm{o}}=$ measured total traveltime.  

This equation assumes that the core completely fills the core liner. The WRMSL PWL was turned off for XCB and RCB cores, whic h often do not fill the core liner.  

# Natural Gamma Radiation Logger measurements  

Gamma radiation is emitted from the decay of mineral-hoste d 238-uranium $^{(238\mathrm{{U})}}$ , 232-thorium $(^{232}\mathrm{{Th})}$ , and 40-potassium $(^{40}\mathrm{K})$ . The NGRL measures this natural emission on whole-round core s using a system designed and built at the USIO (Texas A&M University, USA) (Vasiliev et al., 2011; Dunlea et al., 2013). When $^{238}\mathrm{U}_{:}$ $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotopes decay, they and their daughter product s emit gamma radiation at specific energy levels unique to each isotope. NGR spectroscopy measures a wide energy spectrum that ca n be used to estimate the abundance of each isotope based on th e strength of the signal at characteristic energies (Blum et al., 1997; Gilmore, 2008). Spectral data were collected and can be used fo r postcruise processing for U, Th, and K abundance but were not processed during the expedition. Total counts were used for shipboar d reporting of NGR, with high counts usually identifying either finegrained deposits containing K-rich clay minerals and their absorbe d U and Th isotopes or organic-rich intervals with increased U content. NGR data thus reveal stratigraphic details that aid in core-tocore correlations. The main NGR detector unit consists of eight sodium iodide (NaI) detectors arranged along the core measuremen t axis at $20~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals surrounding the lower half of the section. The detector array has passive (layers of lead) and active (plasti c scintillators) shielding to reduce background environmental an d cosmic radiation. The overlying plastic scintillators detect incomin g high-energy gamma and muon cosmic radiation and cancel this signal from the total counted by the NaI detectors.  

A measurement run consisted of two sample positions $10~\mathrm{cm}$ apart for a total of 16 measurements per $150\,\mathrm{cm}$ section. The qualit y of the energy spectrum measured in a core depends on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample and on the counting time, with higher times yielding better spectra. Counting times were  5 min per position, or ${\sim}10$ min per core, yielding statistically significant energy spectra (Vasiliev et al., 2011).  

# Thermal conductivity measurements  

After NGR measurements were completed, thermal conductivity was measured with the TK04 (Teka Bolin) system using a needl e probe method in full-space configuration for whole-round sediment cores (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959) or a contact prob e method in half-space configuration on split cores for hard rock. Th e probes contain a heater wire and a calibrated thermistor.  

For soft sediment, the needle probe was inserted into a $2~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter hole drilled through the liner (typically in Section 3) alon g one of the lines that later guided core splitting. To avoid interferenc e from air flow in the laboratory, the core was placed into an enclose d box insulated with foam.  

For hard rock cores, samples were selected from the workin g half and returned unaltered to the core liner upon completion of th e tests. The contact probe embedded in the surface of an epoxy bloc k with a low thermal conductivity (Vacquier, 1985) was maintained i n contact with the sample, and both were equilibrated together in  a seawater bath at room temperature in a cooler insulated with extruded polystyrene foam. The calibrated heat source of the prob e was then turned on, and the increase in temperature was recorde d over $80~\mathbf{s}.$ . A heating power of $1.7~\mathrm{W/m}$ was typically used in sof t sediment, and $1.9\:\mathrm{W/m}$ was used for indurated material. The solution to the heat conduction equation with a line source of heat wa s then fit to the temperature measurements to obtain the thermal conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductive than sediment or hard rock, the probe is assumed to be a perfect conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of the superconductiv e probe has a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of th e time after the initiation of the heat:  

$$
\mathrm{T}(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\mathrm{ln}(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where  

$\mathrm{~T~}=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (in seconds), and $C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three measuring cycles were automatically performed to calculate average conductivity. A self-test, which included a drift study, was conducted at the beginning of each measurement cycle. Onc e the probe temperature stabilized, the heater circuit was closed an d the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity was calculated from the rate of temperature rise while the heate r current was flowing. Temperatures measured during the first 80 s o f the heating cycle were fitted to an approximate solution of a constantly heated line source (for details, see Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Measurement errors were $5\%{-}10\%$ . Thermal conductivit y measurements were routinely taken in one section per core (middl e interval of Section 3). Some XCB cores yielded no results for thermal conductivity because cracks in the hard sediment caused poo r coupling of the needle probe to the sediment.  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

Color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility were measured o n archive halves using the SHMSL. The archive half was placed on th e core logger, above which an electronic platform moves along  a track, recording the height of the split-core surface with a laser sensor. The laser establishes the location of the bottom of the section, and then the platform reverses the direction of movement, movin g from bottom to top making measurements of point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance. All foam inserts were remove d from the section-half cores before measurement so that the measured range of values represented the core material only. Point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance data were collected a t constant $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals for most cores but were collected at 1 an d $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ for some cores, depending on the available processing time. The measurements collected at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ have sufficient resolution fo r comparison with the results obtained from the magnetic susceptibility loop of the WRMSL.  

# Color reflectance spectrometry  

The color reflectance spectrometer uses an Ocean Optics 3 0 mm integrating sphere and both halogen and LED light sources, which cover wavelengths from ultraviolet through visible to near infrared. Measurements were taken from 380 to $900\;\mathrm{nm}$ wavelength s at $2~\mathrm{nm}$ intervals. The approximate $_{\mathrm{~3~s~}}$ data acquisition offset wa s applied for the entire scan of the archive half. Data are reported using the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{b}^{\ast}$ color system, in which $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ is rednes s (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative). The color reflectance spectromete r calibrates on two spectra, pure white (reference) and pure blac k (dark). Color calibration was conducted approximately every $^{6\mathrm{~h~}}$ (twice per shift).  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

Point magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartingto n MS2 meter and an MS2K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diamete r round sensor with a $25~\mathrm{mm}$ field of influence and an operation frequency of $930~\mathrm{Hz}$ . The instrument averages three measurement s from the sensor for each offset, leading to an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . Th e spatial resolution of the point magnetic susceptibility instrument i s ${\sim}3.8~\mathrm{mm}$ , higher than that of whole-round magnetic susceptibilit y for sections containing broken pieces ${<}4\ \mathrm{cm}$ in length (the spatia l resolution of whole-round magnetic susceptibility). As with wholeround measurements, the output displayed by the point magneti c susceptibility sensor must be converted to dimensionless SI units b y multiplying by $10^{-5}$ . The probe is zeroed in air before each measurement to avoid influence from the metal track. The point magneti c susceptibility meter was calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on the ship and was quality checked every ${\sim}6\mathrm{~h~}$ at th e same time as color reflectance sensor calibration.  

# Section Half Measurement Gantry measurements  

For soft-sediment cores, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity and shear strengt h measurements were performed on the working halves of split core s before any samples were taken. $P$ -wave velocity measurements use d the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis  caliper  on  the  Section  Half Measurement  Gantr y (SHMG), with two analyses per section. Measurements were usuall y taken at 25 and $125\,\mathrm{cm}$ in each section; however, if this interval provided no good sediment/transducer coupling (e.g., caused by hig h amounts of sand or cracks), different positions were chosen to generate reliable data. XCB cores generally did not provide usable dat a because of bad sediment/liner contact and disturbed sediment. Fo r hard rock cores, $P_{-}$ -wave velocity was measured on the discrete samples chosen for both physical property and paleomagnetic measurements.  

# P-wave velocity  

The $P$ -wave velocity system uses Panametrics-NDT Microsca n delay line transducers, which transmit at $0.5~\mathrm{MHz}$ . The signal received through the section half or the discrete sample was recorde d by the computer attached to the system with the peak ( $P.$ -wave arrival) usually chosen by autopicking software. In the case of a wea k signal, the first arrival was manually picked at the very base of th e first arrival peak, leaving out the automatically picked points tha t usually fell along the ascending curve. The distance between transducers was measured with a built-in linear voltage displacemen t transformer. Calibration was performed with a series of acrylic cylinders of differing thicknesses and a known $P$ -wave velocity of 275 0 $\pm~20~\mathrm{m/s}$ . The system time delay determined from calibration wa s subtracted from the picked arrival time to give a traveltime of the $P$ - wave through the sample. The thickness of the sample (calculate d by the linear voltage displacement transformer, in meters) was divided by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P$ -wave velocity i n meters per second.  

# Shear strength  

Shear strength is the resistance of a material to failure in shear . Shear stress in unconsolidated materials is resisted only by the network of solid particles. Shear strength $\left(\uptau_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ is expressed as a functio n of the effective normal stress at failure $(\sigma^{\prime})$ , the effective cohesio n $(c^{\prime})$ , and friction angle $\left(\Phi^{\prime}\right)$ ,  

$$
\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\mathsf{T}}}_{\mathrm{f}}=c^{\prime}+\boldsymbol{\mathsf{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}}^{\prime}\tan\boldsymbol{\Phi}^{\prime},
$$  

where $c^{\prime}$ and $\Phi^{\prime}$ are the shear strength parameters that define a linear relationship between $\tau_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $\Phi^{\prime}$ , according to the Mohr-Coulom b failure criterion.  

Shear strength parameters were determined by means of multiple laboratory tests. Values of $c^{\prime}$ and $\Phi^{\prime}$ are relevant in situation s where field drainage conditions correspond to test conditions. Th e shear strength of a soil under undrained conditions (IW drainag e does not occur during failure) is different from that under draine d conditions (IW drainage occurs).  

Undrained shear strength $\left(S_{\mathrm{u}}\right)$ is expressed in terms of total stress in the case of fully saturated materials of low permeabilit y (e.g., clays). The most common strength tests in shipboard laboratories are vane shear and penetrometer tests, which provide measurement of undrained shear strength (Blum, 1997).  

$S_{\mathrm{u}}$ was measured in undisturbed fine-grained sediment usin g the handheld Torvane shear device on working halves. Undraine d shear strength was determined by inserting an eight-bladed van e into the split core and putting it under shear stress to cause a cylindrical surface to be sheared by the vane. This procedure provides  a measurement of peak shear strength expressed in units of kilogram s per square centimeter. Measurements were made with the vane rotation axis perpendicular to the split surface. Shear strength wa s measured once in each core when sediments were within the instrument range.  

# Discrete sample measurements of moisture and density  

Discrete samples were collected from the working halves to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, an d porosity. In soft sediment, $\sim\!10\ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were collected with  a plastic syringe, the diameter of which fit that of shipboard glass vials. An attempt was made to sample every section. In indurated sediment and hard rock, minicores were extracted from the workin g halves for physical property measurements, with some also share d for paleomagnetic measurements.  

# Sample preparation  

Soft-sediment samples were placed in numbered, preweighe d ${\sim}16~\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment weighing, drying, and dry volume measurements. Determination of an accurate wet mass of the minicore samples of indurated sediment an d hard rock first required that the pore space of the samples be completely saturated with seawater. As soon as the core was split, therefore, samples were taken and the wet mass was immediatel y determined using the dual balance system. Then the samples wer e dried in a convection oven for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Dried samples were then cooled in a desiccator for at least $60\;\mathrm{min}$ before dr y mass and volume were measured.  

# Dual balance mass measurement  

The weights of wet and dry sample masses were determined to  a precision of $0.005\ \mathrm{g}$ using two Mettler Toledo electronic balances, with one acting as a reference. A standard weight of similar value t o the sample was placed upon the reference balance to increase accuracy. A computer averaging system was used to compensate for th e ship’s motion. The default setting of the balances is 300 measurements (taking ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{min}$ ).  

# Pycnometer volume measurement  

Dry sample volume was determined using a hexapycnomete r system of a six-celled, custom-configured Micrometrics AccuPy c 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer. The precision of eac h cell is $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. Volume measurement was preceded by three purges of the sample chamber with helium warme d to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run for each sample.  A reference volume (set of two calibration spheres) was placed sequentially in one of the chambers to check for instrument drift an d systematic error. The volumes occupied by the numbered Wheato n vials were calculated before the expedition by multiplying each vial’ s weight by the average density of the vial glass. Dry mass and volum e were measured after samples were heated in an oven at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ and allowed to cool in a desiccator. Procedures for determining these physical properties comply with the American Societ y for Testing and Materials (ASTM) designation (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). The fundamental relation and assumptions fo r the calculations of all physical property parameters are discussed b y Blum (1997) and summarized below.  

# Mass and volume calculation  

We measured wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volum e $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ . The ratio of mass (rm) is a computational constant of 0.96 5 (i.e., $0.965\mathrm{~g~}$ of freshwater per $1\ \mathrm{g}$ of seawater). Salt precipitated i n sediment pores during the drying process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and sal t $(M_{\mathrm{salt}})$ in the sample are given by  

$$
M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}
$$  

and  

$$
M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[{\bf s}/(1-{\bf s})],
$$  

where s is the assumed saltwater salinity $(0.035\%)$ corresponding t o a pore water density $\l(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ of $1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $(\boldsymbol\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ o f $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of por e water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , volume of sal t $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\mathrm{~\textit~{~V~}~}_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},}&{{}}&{}\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}},}&{{}}&{}\end{array}
$$  

$$
M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},
$$  

$$
M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\rho_{\mathrm{salt}},
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{wet}}=V_{\mathrm{dry}}-V_{\mathrm{salt}}+V_{\mathrm{pw}},
$$  

and  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as th e ratio of mass of pore water to wet sediment (total) mass:  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grain density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio (VR) are calculated as  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{0dry}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{9solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{9solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{9}}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\end{array}
$$  

and  

$$
\mathrm{VR}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.
$$  

MAD properties reported and plotted in the Physical propertie s sections of the site chapters were calculated with the MADMa x shipboard program set with the “method $C^{\dprime}$ calculation process.  

# Downhole measurements  

Downhole logs record measurements of physical, chemical, an d structural properties of the formation surrounding a borehole tha t are made after completion of drilling. Data are rapidly collected, continuous with depth (at vertical sampling intervals ranging fro m $2.5\;\mathrm{mm}$ to $15\,\mathrm{cm}$ ), and measured in situ. Downhole logs record formation properties on a scale that is intermediate between those obtained from laboratory measurements on core samples and thos e from geophysical surveys. As such, they are useful in calibrating th e interpretation of geophysical data and provide a critical link for th e integrated understanding of physical properties on all scales.  

Downhole logs can be interpreted in terms of the stratigraphy , lithology, mineralogy, magnetic characteristics, and geochemical composition of the penetrated formation. They also provide information on the condition, shape, and size of the borehole and o n possible deformation induced by drilling or formation stress. Wher e core recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log data may provide th e only way to characterize the borehole section and fill in betwee n sampled intervals. Where core recovery is good, log and core dat a complement one another and may be interpreted jointly.  

During Expedition 359, downhole logging measurements wer e recorded  in  Holes  U1466B,  U1467C,  U1467E,  U1468B,  an d U1471E. An attempt was made in Hole U1470B, but the first tool string was not able pass more than ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ below the base of pipe; limited downhole logging data were recorded over a few tens of meters. In addition, downhole temperature measurements were acquired using the APCT-3 in Holes U1465A, U1466A, U1467B, an d U1471C.  

# Wireline logging operations  

During wireline logging operations, logs are recorded with a variety of logging tools combined into tool strings that are lowere d into the hole after completion of coring operations. Three primar y tool strings were used during Expedition 359 (Figure F12):  

1. The triple combination (triple combo) tool string, which measures spectral and NGR, porosity, density, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility;   
2. The Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string, which provides high-resolution resistivity images of the borehole wall and sonic velocities; and   
3. The Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) tool string for vertical seismic profiles (VSPs).  

Figure F12. Wireline tool strings planned for deployment during Expeditio n 359. For definitions of tool acronyms, see Table T3. LEH-QT $=$ logging equipment head with tension.  

![](images/0e2e3050b118e35dd3329012fba61bf81fe552fcee8fd13b664646a0b718716b.jpg)  

These tool strings were modified in response to expected borehol e conditions or tool performance during the expedition (see Figur e F13 for modified tool strings). Each tool string also contains a telemetry cartridge for communicating through the wireline to th e Schlumberger data acquisition system (multitasking acquisition an d imaging system [MAXIS] unit) on the ship. Individual tools ar e listed in Table T3.  

In preparation for logging, boreholes were flushed of debris b y circulating viscous drilling fluid and filled with seawater or seawater-based logging gel (sepiolite mud mixed with seawater an d weighted with barite; approximate density $=\,10.5\ \mathrm{lb/gal}$ or 1.25 8 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ to help stabilize the borehole walls. The BHA was pulled u p to $90{-}150\ \mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , depending on the stability of the hole. Tool string s were then lowered downhole on a seven-conductor wireline cabl e during sequential deployments. Each tool string deployment is  a logging “run,” starting with the assembly of the tool string and an y necessary calibrations. The tool string is then lowered to the botto m of the hole while recording a partial set of data and, except for th e VSI, is pulled up at a constant speed (typically $250{-}500\ \mathrm{m/h}$ ) to record the main data. The VSI is held stationary at regularly space d depths while shooting the seismic source and then pulled up between stations. During each run, tool strings can be lowered dow n and pulled up the hole several times for repeatability or to try to improve the data quality. Each lowering or hauling-up of a tool strin g while collecting data constitutes a “pass.” During each pass, incoming data are recorded and monitored in real time on the surfac e minimum configuration MAXIS. A logging run is complete when  a tool string has been recovered to the rig floor and disassembled.  A wireline heave compensator (WHC) can be employed to minimiz e the effect of ship’s heave on the tool string’s position in the borehol e (see Wireline heave compensator). The sea state was calm durin g all Expedition 359 logging operations, so the WHC was not needed.

# Logged sediment properties and tool measurement principles  

The primary logging measurements recorded during Expeditio n 359 are listed in Table T4. The logged properties and the principle s used in the tools that measure them are briefly described below. More detailed information on individual tools and their geologica l applications may be found in Serra (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989, 1994), Rider (1996), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), and Ellis and Singer (2007). More information about IOD P downhole  logging  tools  and  measurements  can  be  found  a t http://iodp.tamu.edu/tools/logging/index.html.

# Natural gamma radiation  

The Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS ) was used on both the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings t o measure natural gamma radioactivity in the formation. The HNG S uses two bismuth germanate scintillation detectors and five-window spectroscopy to determine concentrations of potassium (i n weight percent), thorium (in parts per million), and uranium (i n parts per million) from the characteristic gamma ray energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}_{\cdot}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series, whic h dominate the natural radiation spectrum. Computation of elemental abundances uses a least-squares method of extracting U, Th, an d K elemental concentrations from the spectral measurements. Th e HNGS filters out gamma ray energies below $500\ \mathrm{keV},$ eliminatin g sensitivity to bentonite or KCl in the drilling mud and improvin g measurement accuracy. The HNGS also measures total gamma ra y (HSGR) emission and uranium-free or computed gamma ra y (HCGR) emission in American Petroleum Institute units (gAPI). The HNGS response is influenced by the borehole diameter, an d therefore HNGS data are corrected for borehole diameter variation s during acquisition.  

The Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC; see Auxiliary logging equipment), which is used primarily to communicat e data to the surface, includes a sodium iodide scintillation detecto r that also measures total natural gamma ray emission. It is not  a spectral tool, but it provides high-resolution total gamma ray measurements for each pass, which allows precise depth-match processing between logging runs and passes.  

The inclusion of a gamma ray sonde in every tool string provide s gamma ray data for precise depth correlation between loggin g strings and passes.  

# Porosity  

Formation porosity was measured with the Accelerator Porosit y Sonde (APS), which includes a minitron neutron generator tha t produces fast $(14.4\,\mathrm{MeV})$ neutrons and five neutron detectors (fou r epithermal and one thermal) positioned at different spacing fro m the minitron. The tool’s detectors count neutrons that arrive at th e detectors after being scattered and slowed by collisions with atomi c nuclei in the formation.  

The highest energy loss occurs when neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei, which have practically the same mass as the neutro n (the neutrons bounce off heavier elements without losing much energy). If the hydrogen (i.e., water) concentration is low, as in lowporosity formations, neutrons can travel farther before being captured, and the count rates increase at the detector. The opposite effect occurs in high-porosity formations where the water content i s high. The raw porosity value is often an overestimate because hydrogen bound in minerals such as clays or in hydrocarbons als o contributes to the measurement.  

Upon reaching thermal energies $(0.025\ \mathrm{eV})$ , the neutrons ar e captured by the nuclei of Cl, Si, B, and other elements, resulting in  a gamma ray emission. This neutron capture cross section $(\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}})$ is als o measured by the tool.

# Density and photoelectric factor  

Formation density was measured with the Hostile Environmen t Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS). The sonde contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source $(622\;\mathrm{keV})$ and far and near gamm a ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid, which is pressed agains t the borehole wall by a hydraulically activated decentralizing arm. Gamma rays emitted by the source undergo Compton scattering, where gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. Th e number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detectors is proportional to the density of electrons in the formation, which is in tur n related to bulk density. Porosity may also be derived from this bul k density if the matrix (grain) density is known.  

The HLDS also measures the photoelectric effect factor (PEF),  a measure of the photoelectric absorption of low-energy gamma radiation. Photoelectric absorption occurs when gamma ray energy fall s below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of being repeatedly scattered by electron s in the formation. PEF is determined by comparing counts from th e far detector in the high-energy region, where only Compton scattering occurs, with those in the low-energy region, where count rate s depend on both reactions. The far detector is used because it has  a greater depth of investigation (approximately tens of centimeters). The response of the short-spaced detector, most influenced b y mudcake (not typically present in IODP-drilled boreholes becaus e seawater-based drilling mud is used) and borehole rugosity, is use d to correct the density measurement for these effects. Because PE F depends on the atomic number of the elements in the formatio n (heavier elements have higher PEFs), it also varies according to th e chemical composition of the minerals present and can be used fo r the identification of some minerals. For example, the PEF of calcit e is 5.08 barns per electron $(\mathsf{b}/\mathsf{e}^{-})$ , celestine is $55.13\,\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ , and quartz i s $1.81\,\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ .  

Good contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential fo r good HLDS logs. Poor contact results in underestimation of densit y values. Both the density correction and caliper measurement of th e hole are used to check the contact quality.  

# Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) provides six electrical resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation  (including  the  borehole,  or  mud,  resistivity  and  fiv e measurements of formation resistivity with increasing penetratio n into the formation). The sonde sends a focused current into the formation and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constan t drop in voltage across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivit y measurements. The array has one central (source) electrode and si x electrodes above and below it, which serve alternatively as focusin g and returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role o f these electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool is designed to ensure that al l signals are measured at exactly the same time and tool position, an d to reduce the sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects when crossin g sharp beds thinner than the electrode spacing. The design of th e HRLA, which eliminates the need for a surface reference electrode, improves formation resistivity evaluation compared to traditiona l dual induction and allows the full range of resistivity to be measured, from low (e.g., in high-porosity sediments) to high (e.g., i n basalt). The HRLA needs to be run centralized in the borehole fo r optimal results, so knuckle joints were used to centralize the HRL A while allowing the density and porosity tools that are on the sam e tool string to maintain good contact with the borehole wall.  

Calcite,  silica,  and  hydrocarbons  are  electrical  insulators, whereas ionic solutions like IW are conductors. Electrical resistivity, therefore, can be used to evaluate porosity for a given salinit y and resistivity of the IW. Clay surface conduction also contribute s to the resistivity values, but at high porosities, this is a relatively minor effect.  

# Magnetic Susceptibility  

The Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde (MSS) is a nonstandar d wireline tool designed by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observator y (LDEO). It measures the ease with which formations are magnetized when subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetization, or susceptibility, is ultimately related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magnetic minerals in th e formation. These measurements provide one of the best method s for investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy and litholog y because the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructiv e and because different lithologies often have strongly contrastin g susceptibilities.  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution measurements with ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ depth of horizontal investigation. The MSS wa s run as the lowermost tool in the triple combo tool string, using  a specially developed data translation cartridge to enable the MSS t o be run in combination with Schlumberger tools. The MSS also ha s an optional single-coil sensor to provide higher resolution measurements, but this was not used during Expedition 359.  

Magnetic susceptibility data are plotted as uncalibrated units. MSS responses are affected by temperature (higher temperature s lead to higher susceptibility readings) and borehole size; preliminary processing can be performed to remove the temperature drif t by calculating a least-squares polynomial fit to the data and subtracting the calculated trend from the data set. When the magneti c susceptibility signal in sediment is very low, the detection limits o f the tool may be reached. For quality control and environmental correction, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $z$ -axis acceleration, and low-resolution borehole conductivity.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The Dipole Shear Sonic Imager (DSI) measures transit times between sonic transmitters and an array of eight receivers. The waveforms are then used to calculate the sonic velocity in the formation. The omnidirectional monopole transmitter emits high-frequenc y $(5{-}15\;\mathrm{kHz})$ pulses to extract the compressional velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ of th e formation, as well as the shear velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{{S}}}\right)$ when it is faster than th e sound velocity in the borehole fluid. It combines replicate measurements, thus providing a direct measurement of compressional velocity through sediments that is relatively free from the effects o f formation damage and an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989). The same transmitter can be fired in sequence at a lower frequenc y $(0.5{-}1~\mathrm{kHz})$ to generate Stoneley waves that are sensitive to fractures and variations in permeability. Along with the monopol e transmitters found on most sonic tools, the DSI also has tw o crossed-dipole transmitters that allow an additional measuremen t of shear wave velocity. Dipole measurements are necessary to measure shear velocities in “slow” formations in which shear velocity i s slower than the borehole fluid velocity. Such slow formations ar e typically encountered in deep ocean drilling. The two shear velocities measured from the two orthogonal dipole transmitters can b e used to identify sonic anisotropy that can be associated with the local stress regime.  

# Resistivity images  

The FMS provides high-resolution electrical resistivity–base d images of the borehole walls that can be used for detailed lithostratigraphic or structural interpretation. The tool has four orthogonally oriented arms, each with 16 button electrodes that ar e pressed against the borehole walls during logging. The electrode s are arranged in two diagonally offset rows of eight electrodes each. A focused current is emitted from the button electrodes into th e formation, with a return electrode near the top of the tool. Resistivity of the formation at the button electrodes is derived from the intensity of current passing through the button electrodes.  

Processing transforms the resistivity measurements into oriented high-resolution images that reveal geologic structures of th e borehole wall based on their conductivity. Features such as bedding, stratification, fracturing, slump folding, and bioturbation can be resolved (Luthi, 1990; Salimullah and Stow, 1992; Lovell et al., 1998). Because the images are oriented to magnetic north, further analysi s can provide measurement of the dip and direction (azimuth) of planar features in the formation. In addition, when the correspondin g planar features can be identified in the recovered core samples, individual core pieces can be reoriented with respect to true north.  

The maximum extension of the FMS caliper arms is $40.6\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ (1 6 inches). In holes with a diameter greater than this maximum, th e pad contact at the end of the caliper arms will be inconsistent an d the FMS images may appear out of focus and too conductive. Irregular (rough) borehole walls will also adversely affect the images i f contact with the wall is poor. Approximately $30\%$ of a borehole wit h a diameter of $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ is imaged during a single pass. Standard procedure is to make two full uphole passes with the FMS to maximiz e the borehole coverage with the pads.  

# Acceleration and inclinometry  

The General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT) was included i n the FMS-sonic tool string to measure tool acceleration and orientation during logging. Tool orientation is defined by three parameters: tool deviation, tool azimuth, and relative bearing. The GPIT utilize s a three-axis inclinometer and a three-axis fluxgate magnetomete r to record the orientation of the FMS as the magnetometer record s the magnetic field components $(F_{\mathrm{x}},F_{\mathrm{y}})$ and $F_{z})$ . Thus, the FMS images can be corrected for irregular tool motion, and the dip and direction (azimuth) of features in FMS images can be determined. Corrections for cable stretching and/or ship heave using GPIT acceleration data $(A_{\mathrm{x}},\,A_{\mathrm{y}},$ and $A_{\mathrm{z}})$ allow precise determination of lo g depths.  

# Vertical seismic profile  

In a VSP experiment, a borehole seismic tool (VSI) is anchore d against the borehole wall at regularly spaced intervals (or wher e borehole conditions permit) and records the full waveform of elasti c waves generated by a seismic source positioned just below the se a surface. The main purpose of this experiment is to provide a direc t measurement of the time needed for seismic waves to travel fro m the surface to a given depth and thus to tie observations in the borehole, recorded as a function of depth, to reflections in the seismi c survey data, recorded as a function of time.  

The VSI used for the VSP experiment is a three-axis geophon e accelerometer that is anchored to the borehole wall by a caliper ar m prior to recording. The orientation of the horizontal components, $X$ and $\mathit{Y,}$ vary because of sensor rotation during logging, but tool orientation is recorded. During Expedition 359, the VSI was anchore d against the borehole wall at approximately $50\textrm{m}$ station interval s and 5–10 air gun shots were typically taken at each station. The recorded waveforms were stacked, and a one-way traveltime was determined from the median of the first breaks for each station. Th e seismic source on the JOIDES Resolution was a Sercel G. Gun Parallel Cluster composed of two $250\,\mathrm{in}^{3}$ air guns separated by $1\,\mathrm{m}$ ; however, only a single gun was used during the VSP experiments fo r Expedition 359, for a total source volume of $250\;\mathrm{in}^{3}$ . The source wa s positioned off the port side of the JOIDES Resolution at a total horizontal offset from the top of the wellhead of $34\,\mathrm{m}$ and maintained a t a water depth of 3 meters below sea level (mbsl).  

In accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act, all seismic activities  were  conducted  during  daytime,  and  Protected  Specie s Observers kept watch for protected species for the duration of th e VSP experiment. Any sight of protected species within the exclusion zone of $900\;\mathrm{m}$ , used for a $250\;\mathrm{in}^{3}$ source in intermediate wate r depths $:\!100{-}1000\ \mathrm{m})$ , would interrupt the survey for $60\ \mathrm{min}$ afte r the last sighting or until the protected species were seen leaving th e exclusion zone. Protected Species Observers began observations $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ prior to the use of the seismic source, which started with a $30\ \mathrm{min}$ ramp-up procedure, gradually increasing the operational pressur e and firing rate to provide time for undetected protected species t o vacate the area. The same ramp-up procedure would be used whe n resuming activity after any interruption due to the sighting of protected species or whenever the gun was not fired for more than 3 0 min.  

# Auxiliary logging equipment  

The Schlumberger logging equipment head (LEH or cable head ) measures tension at the very top of the wireline tool string, whic h diagnoses difficulties in running the tool string up or down th e borehole or when exiting or entering the drilling string or casing.  

Telemetry cartridges are used in each tool string to transmi t data from the tools to the surface. The EDTC also includes a sodiu m iodide scintillation detector to measure the total natural gamma ra y emission of the formation. This gamma ray log was used to matc h the depths between the different passes and runs. In addition, it includes an accelerometer, whose data can be used in real time t o evaluate the efficiency of the WHC.  

Because the tool strings combine tools of different generation s and with various designs, they include several adapters and joint s between individual tools to allow communication, provide isolation, avoid interferences (mechanical and acoustic), terminate wirings, o r to position the tool properly in the borehole. The knuckle joints i n particular were used to allow tools such as the HRLA to remain centralized in the borehole while the overlying HLDS was presse d against the borehole wall.  

All of these additions are included and contribute to the tota l length of the tool strings as shown in Figures F12 and F13.  

# Log data quality  

The main influence on log data quality is the condition of th e borehole wall. Where borehole diameter varies over short interval s because of washouts of softer material or ledges of harder material, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehole wall (i.e., FMS, density, and porosity tools) may be degraded. Deep investigation measurements such as gamma radiation, resistivity, an d sonic velocity, which do not require contact with the borehole wall, are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions. “Bridged” sections, where borehole diameter is significantly less than the bit size, will also cause irregular log results. The quality of the borehole i s improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling fluid while drilling, flushing the borehole to remove debris, and logging as soon a s possible after drilling and conditioning are completed.  

The quality of the wireline depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determine d from the length of the cable payed out from the winch on the ship. The seafloor is identified on the natural gamma ray log by th e abrupt reduction in gamma ray count at the water/sediment interface (mudline). Discrepancies between the drilling depth (DSF), core depth (CSF-A), and wireline log depth may occur because o f core expansion, incomplete core recovery, or incomplete heav e compensation for the drilling depth. In the case of log depth, discrepancies between successive runs may occur because of incomplete heave compensation, incomplete correction for cable stretch, and cable slip. In the case of very fine sediments in suspension, th e mudline can be an elusive datum. Tidal changes in sea level may als o affect both drilling and logging depths. To minimize the wirelin e tool motion caused by ship heave, a hydraulic WHC can be used t o adjust the wireline depth for rig motion during wireline logging operations.  

# Wireline heave compensator  

During wireline logging operations, the up-and-down motion o f the ship (heave) causes a similar motion in the downhole loggin g tools. If the amplitude of this motion is large, depth discrepancie s can be introduced into the logging data. The risk of damagin g downhole instruments is also increased. A WHC system was thu s designed to compensate for the vertical motion of the ship an d maintain a steady motion of the logging tools to ensure high-qualit y logging data acquisition (Liu et al., 2013; Iturrino et al., 2013). Th e WHC uses a vertical accelerometer (motion reference unit [MRU] ) positioned under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertical motion of the ship with respect to the seafloor. I t then adjusts the length of the wireline by varying the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes in order t o minimize downhole tool motion. Real-time measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleration are made simultaneousl y by the MRU and the EDTC, respectively. The sea state was cal m during all Expedition 359 logging operations, and the ship’s heav e was minimal, so the WHC was not used.  

# Logging data flow and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real tim e and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. Initia l logging data were referenced to the rig floor (WRF). After loggin g was completed, data were shifted to a seafloor reference (WSF ) based on the step in gamma radiation at the sediment/water interface.  

Data were transferred onshore to LDEO, where standardize d data processing took place using Schlumberger Geo-Quest’s GeoFrame software package. The main part of the processing is dept h matching to remove depth offsets between logs from different logging runs, which results in a new WMSF depth scale. Also, corrections are made to certain tools and logs (e.g., FMS imagery i s corrected for tool acceleration, including “stick and slip”), documentation for the logs (with an assessment of log quality) is prepared, and data are converted to ASCII for the conventional log s and GIF for the FMS images. Data were transferred back to the shi p within a few days of logging, and this processed data set was mad e available to the science party (in ASCII and digital log informatio n standard [DLIS] formats) through shipboard servers.  

# In situ temperature measurements  

During Expedition 359, in situ temperature measurements wer e made using the APCT-3 temperature tool in one hole at Site s U1465, U1466, U1467, and U1471 when the APC system was deployed. The APCT-3 fits directly into the coring shoe of the AP C system and consists of a battery pack, data logger, and platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over a temperature range o f $0^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Before entering the borehole, the tool is first stopped at th e seafloor for $5{-}10\ \mathrm{min}$ to thermally equilibrate with bottom water. However, the lowest temperature recorded during the run down i s preferred to the average temperature at the seafloor as an estimat e of bottom water temperature because (1) this measurement is mor e repeatable and (2) the bottom water is expected to have the lowes t temperature in the profile. After the APC penetrated the sediment, it was held in place for $5{-}10\ \mathrm{min}$ while the APCT-3 instrument recorded the temperature of the cutting shoe every second. When th e APC was fired into the formation, there was typically an instantaneous temperature rise due to frictional heating (although this wa s not observed during any APCT-3 deployments at Site U1467). Th e heat gradually dissipated into the surrounding sediment as the temperature at the APCT-3 equilibrated to the temperature of the sediment.  

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment was estimated b y applying a mathematical heat-conduction model to the temperatur e decay record (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The synthetic therma l decay curve for the APCT-3 tool is a function of the geometry an d thermal properties of the probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The equilibrium temperature mus t be estimated by applying a fitting procedure in the TP-Fit softwar e designed by Heesemann. However, when the APC does not achiev e a full stroke or when ship heave pulls up the APC from full penetration, the temperature equilibration curve is disturbed and temperature determination is less accurate. The nominal accuracy of th e APCT-3 temperature measurements is $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

When a reasonable number of data points are measured, APCT3 temperature data may be combined with measurements of thermal conductivity (see Physical properties) obtained from wholeround core sections to obtain heat flow values. Heat flow may b e calculated according to the Bullard method, to be consistent wit h the synthesis of ODP heat flow data by Pribnow et al. (2000).  

# Stratigraphic correlation and sedimentation rates  

Meeting the scientific objectives of Expedition 359 required recovery of complete stratigraphic sections at some of the coring sites. Such sections cannot be constructed from a single borehole becaus e core-recovery gaps on the order of 20 to $50\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ occur between successive cores despite $100\%$ or more nominal recovery at these site s (e.g., Ruddiman et al., 1987; Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2001). The construction of a complete stratigraphic section, referred to as a splice, requires combining stratigraphic intervals fro m two or more offset holes cored at the same site.  

# Meters below seafloor scale  

Expedition 359 uses the scale terminology of meters below seafloor (mbsf) to designate positions of recovered core relative to th e seafloor instead of the CSF-A scale adopted by some IODP expeditions. The depth to the top of each core is based on the DSF scale, which is determined by the length of drill string below the rig floo r to the top of the cored interval minus the length of drill string fro m the rig floor to the mudline (assumed to be the seafloor). The dept h to a position within a given core is determined by adding to the cor e top depth the distance the position occurs from the top of the core, which is measured onboard by a curator and includes growth due t o relief of overburden as well as gas expansion. Therefore, the mbs f depth scale used during Expedition 359 is exactly the same as tha t used in the historical DSDP, ODP, and Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program expeditions. Error in the mbsf scale includes pipe an d BHA stretch and compression, tides, uncompensated heave, and incomplete recovery and core expansion. Tidal influence on thi s depth measurement was first predicted during ODP Leg 13 8 (Hagelberg et al., 1995) and demonstrated during ODP Leg 20 2 (Mix, Tiedemann, Blum, et al., 2003). During Expedition 359, tidal range was low $(<\!1\;\mathrm{m})$ and was not considered in the mbsf scale.  

# Core composite depth below seafloor scale  

The goal of constructing a composite depth scale is to place coeval, laterally continuous stratigraphic features into a commo n frame of reference by depth-shifting individual cores (starting o n the mbsf scale) to maximize correlation between holes. The resulting CCSF-A scale is equivalent to the historical ODP and Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program meters composite depth (mcd) scale. I n constructing the CCSF-A scale from the mbsf scale, individual cor e depths are shifted by a constant amount (no stretching or squeezin g within an individual core). Ultimately, this provides good first-orde r correlation between cores from different holes, estimates of th e length of coring gaps, and a basis on which higher order composit e depth scales are constructed. Rather than being tied to a drill strin g measurement, the CCSF-A scale is built by correlating feature s downhole from the sedimentological mudline. Here, the mudline i s not merely taken as the top of the first core in a given hole but is th e top of the first core at the site with the best-preserved sediment/water interface. This establishes the top of the stratigraphic sectio n and anchors the entire composite depth scale for all cores from all holes at a site. The mudline (or anchor) core is typically the onl y core in which the depths are the same for both the mbsf and CCSFA scales. Each core downhole is tied to the composite section b y adding or subtracting a depth offset (a constant) that best aligns a n observed lithologic feature among adjacent cores from differen t holes. Because of the differing effects of coring-induced stretchin g and squeezing among cores, as well as hole-to-hole sedimentological differences, this approach very rarely aligns all features (Figur e F14).  

The depth offset of every core is tabulated in an affine table. Provided between-core gaps never come into alignment among al l holes at a site and recovery is sufficiently high, it should be possibl e to correlate (“tie”) each successive core in one hole to a core from a n adjacent hole all the way to the bottom of a drilled section. Aligne d coring gaps across all holes cored at a site may still occur, in whic h case cores below the gaps are no longer tied to the mudline core bu t can often still be tied to one another.  

In the process of constructing the composite section, the tota l CCSF-A depth is usually larger than that of the mbsf scale. This expansion, typically ${\sim}5\%$ to $15\%$ , is mostly caused by decompressio n of the cores as they are brought to the surface, gas expansion, stretching that occurs as part of the coring process, and/or curatio n practice, in which material that has fallen downhole or gas expansion voids are curated as part of the core (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2001).  

# Core composite depth below seafloor scale  

Once the CCSF-A scale is developed and the between-core gap s are identified, a complete stratigraphic section (splice) is constructed by combining selected intervals from among holes an d avoiding the gaps, overlaps, and disturbed sections. The depth scal e for the splice is the CCSF-D scale (Figure F14). Although the CCSFD scale is merely a subset of the CCSF-A scale, the “-D” designatio n applies only to intervals included in the splice. Intervals not included in the primary splice, including any alternate splice(s), ar e assigned a CCSF-A scale only. Should coring gaps happen to alig n across all holes drilled at a site, the spliced sections below are “appended” to those above and referred to as floating splice section s (i.e., not tied to the mudline). In this case, the amount of missin g material between floating splices can be measured using downhol e logs. Where no logs are available, the mbsf scale provides a reasonably accurate estimate of the length of the missing section, especially when coring in calm seas.  

# Age models and sedimentation rates  

Preliminary age models and sedimentation rates were generate d for each site considering all available datums generated by the Biostratigraphy,  Paleomagnetism,  and  Lithostratigraphy  (tephra ) groups. These shipboard age models provide the context for variations in physical properties (e.g., GRA, NGR, and $L^{\ast}$ ) generated o n either whole- or half-round sections that can be used to identif y sedimentary cycles with a periodic forcing. Preliminary “astrochronologies” provide refinement of the biostratigraphic age models.

# Seismic stratigraphy  

Seismic stratigraphy relies on high-resolution reflection seismi c lines acquired during NEOMA Cruise M74/4 with the R/V METEOR in 2007 and Cruise SO236 with the R/V SONNE in 2014 b y the University of Hamburg (Betzler et al., 2013; Lüdman et al., 2013). In addition, published low- to medium-resolution industria l reflection seismic lines shot for Elf in 1973–1974 (Purdy and Bertram, 1993; Aubert and Droxler, 1996) and for Shell in 1989–199 0 (Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004) were used for regional context an d initial sequence analysis. The Shell seismic data set covers the Inne r Sea and the interatoll passages. The Elf seismic grid also transect s most of the Maldivian atolls and offers good penetration depth s across the atolls and their drowned parts.  

The high-resolution seismic data set consists of approximatel y $1715\;\mathrm{km}$ (Cruise M74/4) and $1400\,\mathrm{km}$ (Cruise SO236) of reflectio n seismic profiles. During both cruises, seismic signals were generated by a 2-gun cluster of a standard and mini generator injecto r (GI) guns. Both fired in true GI modus with a total volume of $195\;\mathrm{in}^{3}$ $(150\,+\,45\,\,\mathrm{in}^{3})$ . A digital 144-channel streamer array with an activ e length of $600\;\mathrm{m}$ and a group interval of $4.167\;\mathrm{m}$ was used. The dat a were digitized with seven SeaMUX 24-channel 24-bit digitizin g modules configured in six multiple arrays totaling 144 channels. The shotpoint distance during the entire cruise was $12.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Th e dominant frequencies center around $100{-}200\ \mathrm{Hz}$ . Processing of reflection seismic data was done using the software package ProMA X 2-D (Halliburton-Landmark). Data were processed to zero phase, filtered in time and f-k domains, and corrected for dip moveout. I n basinal areas, a suppression of multiple reflections was achieved b y predictive deconvolution of prestacked data. Amplitude losses wer e compensated by a power function.  

The vertical resolution of the newly acquired data is approximately $4{-}6\mathrm{~m},$ , depending on depth. In comparison, the Shell seismic data had a resolution of only $10{-}25\;\mathrm{m}$ (Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004), and the vertical resolution of the Elf seismic data is eve n lower.  

Interpretation and visualization was performed on time-migrated data in time domain using the software package Petre l (Schlumberger). All seismic data were tied to the seafloor topography computed from the multibeam data acquired during the presit e surveys (see Figure F5 in the Expedition 359 summary chapter [Betzler et al., 2017a]). A preliminary time model was established vi a correlation of the mapped seismic units to published data of exploration Wells NMA-1 and ARI-1 (Aubert and Droxler, 1996; Belopolsky and Droxler, 2004) and ODP Site 716 (Backman, Duncan, et al., 1988). A velocity model for the basin and platform sequence s was deduced from interval velocities obtained from Well ARI-1 (basin) and a comparable platform setting (ODP Leg 166; Great Bahama Bank; Eberli, Swart, Malone, et al., 1997), respectively. Mapping seismic units is based on the principles of sequence stratigraphy established by Mitchum and Vail (1977), who define a sequence as a relatively conformable succession of genetically relate d strata bounded by unconformities or their correlative conformities. Sequence and system tract boundaries are identified by their termination pattern: onlap, toplap, downlap, or truncation. Their externa l (sheet, wedge, clinoform, mound, etc.) and internal (reflector pattern: parallel, shingled, chaotic, etc.) configuration as well as seismi c facies (reflection amplitude, continuity, frequency, and interval velocity) are interpreted in terms of depositional environment.  

The sequences in the Inner Sea are deposited in two main depositional environments, prograding carbonate platform and drift deposits (see Figures F7 and F8 in the Expedition 359 summar y chapter [Betzler et al., 2017a]). The environments are reflected i n the names, which are platform sequences (PS) and drift sequence s (DS). The basal sequence boundary is numbered from old to young; 11 sequences in the platform environment are thus labeled PS1– PS11 and the overlying drift sequences are labeled DS1–DS10 (se e Figure F30 in the Site U1465 chapter [Betzler et al., 2017b]).  

# Seismic-core-log correlation  

The work flow for correlation between seismic profiles, cores , and logs comprises a number of different steps:  

• Fine tuning the preliminary velocity models by newly acquired VSI velocity data (see Downhole measurements),   
• Tying sequence boundaries to core chronostratigraphy (see Biostratigraphy),   
• Correlating WRMSL logs (density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P$ -wave velocity) with sequence boundaries (see Physical properties),   
• Correlating core lithology with seismic facies (see Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology),   
• Using downhole logs to fill core gaps and identify spatial and temporal depositional trends along the platform to basin transects (see Downhole measurements),   
• Correlating lithostratigraphic and log units to the seismic sequence, and   
• Importing age information from age-depth plots to determine ages of seismic sequence boundaries (see Biostratigraphy).  

Seismic-core-log correlation was carried out with the interpretatio n software package Petrel 2014 (Schlumberger) provided by IODP.
