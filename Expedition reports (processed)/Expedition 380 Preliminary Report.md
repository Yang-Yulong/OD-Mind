# Abstract  

The multiexpedition Integrated Ocean Drilling Program/International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) was designed to investigat e fault mechanics and seismogenesis along subduction megathrust s through direct sampling, in situ measurements, and long-ter m monitoring in conjunction with allied laboratory and numerica l modeling studies. Overall NanTroSEIZE scientific objectives include characterizing the nature of fault slip and strain accumulation, fault and wall rock composition, fault architecture, and state variables throughout the active plate boundary system. Expedition 38 0 was the twelfth NanTroSEIZE expedition since 2007. Refer to Kop f et al. (2017) for a comprehensive summary of objectives, operations, and results during the first 11 expeditions. Expedition 380 focuse d on one primary objective: riserless deployment of a long-term borehole monitoring system (LTBMS) in Hole C0006G in the overridin g plate at the toe of the Nankai accretionary prism.  

The LTBMS installed in Hole C0006G incorporates multileve l pore pressure sensing and a volumetric strainmeter, tiltmeter, geophone, broadband seismometer, accelerometer, and thermisto r string. Similar previous LTBMS installations were completed farther upslope at IODP Sites C0002 and C0010. The ${\sim}35~\mathrm{km}$ trenchnormal transect of three LTBMS installations will provide monitoring within and above regions of contrasting behavior in the megasplay fault and the plate boundary as a whole, including a site abov e the updip edge of the locked zone (Site C0002), a shallow site in th e megasplay fault zone and its footwall (Site C0010), and a site at th e tip of the accretionary prism (the Expedition 380 installation at Sit e C0006). In combination, this suite of observatories has the potentia l to capture stress and deformation spanning a wide range of timescales (e.g., seismic and microseismic activity, slow slip, and interseismic strain accumulation) across the transect from near-trenc h to the seismogenic zone.  

Expedition 380 achieved its primary scientific and operationa l goal with successful installation of the LTBMS to a total depth o f $457\textrm{m}$ below seafloor in Hole C0006G. The installation was conducted in considerably less time than budgeted, partly because th e Kuroshio Current had shifted away from the NanTroSEIZE area after $10\,\mathrm{y}$ of seriously affecting D/V Chikyu NanTroSEIZE operations. After Expedition 380, the LTBMS was to be connected to the Dens e Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis i n March 2018 using the remotely operated vehicle Hyper-Dolphin from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technolog y R/V Shinsei Maru.  

# Introduction and geological setting  

Subduction zones account for ${\sim}90\%$ of the global seismic moment release and can generate damaging earthquakes and tsunami s with potentially disastrous effects on heavily populated coastal areas (e.g., Lay et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2010; Simons et al., 2011). Understanding the processes that govern the strength, nature, an d distribution of slip along these plate boundary fault systems is crucial in evaluating earthquake and tsunami hazards. Characterizin g fault slip behavior and mechanical state at convergent plate boundaries through direct sampling, near-field geophysical observations, measurement of in situ conditions, and shore-based laboratory experiments is a fundamental and societally relevant goal of curren t earth science and the overarching goal of the International Ocea n  

Discovery Program (IODP) Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) project.  

Expedition 380 was the twelfth IODP expedition since 2007 t o address the NanTroSEIZE project’s objectives. The fundamental scientific objectives of NanTroSEIZE include characterizing the nature of fault slip and strain accumulation, fault and wall rock composition, fault architecture, and state variables throughout th e active plate boundary system through direct sampling, in situ measurements, downhole experiments such as walk-away vertical seismic profile, and long-term monitoring in conjunction with allie d laboratory and numerical modeling studies (Tobin and Kinoshita, 2006). See Kopf et al. (2017) for the most recent comprehensiv e summary of the rationale and history of the NanTroSEIZE projec t and regional survey data. To date, NanTroSEIZE has involved coring, logging, and installation of long-term borehole observatories a t 14 sites in a trench-normal transect across the Nankai Trough subduction zone offshore the Kii Peninsula in southwest Honshu Island. This transect runs from the Kumano Basin in the fore-ar c region ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{km}$ landward of the trench axis to the Kashinosaki Knoll in the downgoing plate ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{km}$ seaward (Figures F1, F2).  

The Nankai Trough is formed by subduction of the Philippin e Sea plate to the northwest beneath the Eurasian plate at a rate o f ${\sim}65\;\mathrm{mm/y}$ (Miyazaki and Heki, 2001; DeMets et al., 2010). The convergence direction is slightly oblique to the trench, and trenc h wedge turbidites and underlying Shikoku Basin hemipelagic sediments accrete at the deformation front. The Nankai Trough regio n has 1300 y of historical and archeological records of recurring grea t earthquakes that are typically tsunamigenic, including the 194 4 Tonankai $_{\mathrm{M8.2}}$ and 1946 Nankaido M8.3 earthquakes (Ando, 1975; Hori et al., 2004). The rupture area and zone of tsunami generatio n for the 1944 event (within which the Expedition 380 site is located ) are now reasonably well understood (Tanioka and Satake, 2001; Ichinose et al., 2003; Kikuchi et al., 2003; Baba and Cummins, 2005; Baba et al., 2005, 2006). Land-based off-shore geodetic studies suggest that the plate boundary thrust is currently strongly locked (Miyazaki  and  Heki,  2001;  Yokota  et  al.,  2016).  Similarly,  lowe r microseismicity levels near the updip edge of the rupture area of th e 1940s earthquakes (Obana et al., 2001) imply significant interseismic strain accumulation on the megathrust.  

Recent geological studies at the Nankai margin (Sakaguchi et al. , 2011; Yamaguchi et al., 2011), direct observational evidence fro m the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (e.g., Fujiwara et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2013), and new results from both a seafloor cabled network an d long-term borehole monitoring system (LTBMS) installations $\mathord{\sim}25-$ $35\ \mathrm{km}$ landward of the trench along the NanTroSEIZE transec t (Wallace et al., 2016; Araki et al., 2017) suggest that the décollemen t or frontal thrust are capable of storing and releasing elastic strai n and may participate in both periodic slow slip events (SSEs) an d megathrust earthquakes. Observations of very low frequency (VLF ) earthquakes and tremor within or just below the accretionary pris m in the drilling area (Obara and Ito, 2005; Ito and Obara, 2006; Obana and Kodaira, 2009; Sugioka et al., 2012) demonstrate that interseismic strain is not confined to slow elastic strain accumulation. New observations from two LTBMSs installed at IODP Site C001 0 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0002, located ${\sim}25{-}35\$ km from the trench, reveal repeating SSEs that extend to ${<}25~\mathrm{km}$ from the trench, are accompanied by low-frequency tremor, and recur approximately every 12–18 months (Araki et al., 2017). Thes e SSEs may accommodate as much as $50\%$ of the plate convergenc e budget, indicating that quasiperiodic accumulation and release o f strain on the shallowest megathrust through slow slip plays an important role in the earthquake cycle. Monitoring of this region i s therefore a high priority to detect interseismic strain accumulatio n and release to better understand outer wedge megathrust processes.  

Expedition 380 returned to Site C0006 in the toe of the Nanka i accretionary prism ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{km}$ landward of the trench axis (Figure F3). The sole objective of Expedition 380 was riserless installation of  a LTBMS at ${\sim}450~\mathrm{m}$ below seafloor (mbsf) in the hanging wall abov e the plate boundary fault. The objective was completed in Hol e C006G. Site C0006 was logged and cored during two of the initia l NanTroSEIZE expeditions, 314 and 316 (Kinoshita et al., 2009; Screaton et al., 2009). The LTBMS was of the same general design as th e borehole observatories previously installed in Hole C0010 farthe r up the accretionary prism (Kopf et al., 2017) and Hole C0002 at th e southeastern edge of the Kumano Basin above the prism (Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011). Those two LTBMS observatories are already connected to the Dense Oceanfloor Network System fo r Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET), and the LTBMS in Hol e C0006G was scheduled to be connected in March 2018, shortly after Expedition 380. This transect of three observatories should provide unprecedented resolution of the state of stress and strain in th e leading edge of the overriding plate from the near-trench region t o the seismogenic zone on a wide range of timescales, with nearly rea l time data freely available to the scientific community.  

# Operations  

Expedition 380 began in the port of Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture (Japan), on 12 January 2018. The first few days were spen t quayside, loading cargo and supplies. The science party boarded th e Chikyu on 12 January and participated in the shipboard prespu d meeting on 14 January. The Chikyu sailed from Shimizu at $0900~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 January, arriving on location at Site C0006 by $0300~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 6 January. Operation details can be found in Table T1.  

# Site C0006  

After arrival at Site C0006, four transponders were droppe d while making up and running the 20 inch casing began. Runnin g stopped to install the underwater television (UWTV) on the dril l pipe. The UWTV was run down to $7\textrm{m}$ above the 20 inch casin g shoe. The vessel shifted to tag the seabed, and the Hole C0006G location and water depth ( $3902\;\mathrm{m}$ below rotary table [BRT]; $3873.5\;\mathrm{m}$ from mean sea level) was confirmed before jetting in.  

# Hole C0006G  

Jetting in for Hole C0006G commenced and reached 65 mbsf o n 18 January 2018. The UWTV was retrieved so that drill down coul d commence. After reaching 399 mbsf, the drill string was picked u p to 66 mbsf while the UWTV was run to check the drill-ahead too l (DAT). The DAT and the UWTV were recovered in the moonpool. On 19 January, the $9\%$ inch casing was made up, and it was run t o $388\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT by 20 January. The UWTV was opened and set aroun d the drill pipe and then run down to the Activation Kit so that th e UWTV’s cameras could monitor the kit’s pressure. The casing an d casing hanger running tool (CHRT) were run to $3854\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT i n preparation for reentering Hole C0006G. The wellhead was found, and the casing was run in on 21 January. Cementing the $9\%$ inc h casing began on 21 January and was completed the next morning. Once the cementing was finished, the running tool was unlocke d from the casing hanger and the entire string was pulled out of th e hole to prepare for running the bicenter bit bottom-hole assembl y (BHA). This BHA was run down to begin drilling out cement. Several Hydrolift Power Swivel (HPS) stalls were observed. Drillin g stopped, and the BHA was pulled out of the hole on the morning o f 24 January. The bicenter bit showed damage with no appreciabl e advance; therefore, a drill-out-cement BHA was made up and run i n the hole. The Hole C0006G wellhead was reentered on 24 January. Drilling and reaming out the cement began again and continued t o 409 mbsf. The drill-out-cement BHA was pulled out of the hole an d laid down on 25 January. The derrick stopped for HPS and travelin g block maintenance, which was completed by the evening of 25 January.  

The bicenter bit (Table T2) was made up again and run to 387 0 m BRT on 26 January. The UWTV was run to $7~\mathrm{m}$ above the bit t o help with wellhead reentry. After reentering, the bit was run to 40 7 mbsf. Operations paused until the UWTV was recovered in th e moonpool. The bicenter bit BHA drilled to total depth $(495~\mathrm{mbsf})$ by $2030\,\mathrm{h},$ and the hole was swept twice and spotted with saltwate r gel. A wiper trip to 393 mbsf showed no excessive drag, indicatin g that the hole was in good condition. Schlumberger set a special Protect Zone treatment at the bottom of the hole. The bicenter BH A was pulled out of the hole on 27 January. A scraper run confirme d that the casing section was uncontaminated by cement (Table T3) . After the scraper runs, the ROV platform was made up on the working cart in the moonpool and run with the UWTV on 28 January. During the running and landing, the two downward-looking camera lights failed. The remaining upward-looking camera light wer e tilted down to observe the ROV platform landing. The UWTV wa s recovered on the surface, and the scraper BHA was pulled out of th e hole and laid down by $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 January.  

The LTBMS completion string run began at $1230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 January with 3.5 inch tubing, and the strainmeter and instrument carrie r were run downhole to the moonpool, where the sensors were connected to sensor cables. The hydraulic line from the pressure por t (Port 1) was connected to a flatpack to be run all the way up to th e LTBMS CORK head and pressure sensing unit (PSU). Cable attachments, tie bands, and metal straps were used to secure the hydrauli c lines and sensor cables to the strainmeter and instrument carrie r and 3.5 inch tubing. A series of communication tests of each senso r cable was performed before and after adding the swellable packe r and before the sensor cables were terminated by the Teledyne OD I engineers.  

On 31 January, the ODI engineers then started the molding, soldering, and termination process. After the initial molding and soldering,  a  sensor  communication  test  confirmed  goo d communication, and termination proceeded. Termination wa s completed early on 1 February, and another sensor communicatio n check confirmed good communication through the ODI underwater mateable connectors (UMC) to the sensors. After wrapping th e sensor cables onto the LTBMS CORK cable bay, another communication check discovered that the seismometer could not receiv e commands. Troubleshooting ended with cutting the ODI connection and checking sensor communication with the bare cable. Successful  communication  meant  that  the  cable  needed  to  b e reterminated, a task that was completed by $0730~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February. Checks confirmed that communication with the seismometer wa s fully functional (sending commands and receiving correct responses). The ODI cable was fixed onto the LTBMS CORK head, and all UMCs were fixed to the acoustic modem. Sensor check s through the acoustic modem confirmed good performance, and th e LTBMS CORK head was dunked into the moonpool for 5 min t o bleed out air from the hydraulic lines. The LTBMS CORK head wa s then picked up, the three-way valves were set to “OCEAN,” the twoway sampling valves were closed, and all valve handles were fixed i n position with plastic tie wraps. The LTBMS was set so that the Activation Kit could be picked up and pressurized with N2 and blowou t preventer fluid, a task that was finished by $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ . The completio n string and Activation Kit and hydraulically activated running too l (HART) were all run to $1400\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT. While waiting for the UWTV, the scientists performed another sensor check with the acousti c modem. By $0115~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February, the UWTV reached the Activation Kit and confirmed that it was holding pressure. Running th e completion string and UWTV continued to $2000\,\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT for another Activation Kit pressure check. The pressure check was completed, and the completion string was run to $3880~\mathrm{m}$ BRT, where i t paused to let the UWTV catch up. The scientists again checked th e sensors before the observatory reentered Hole C0006G. Th e UWTV found a small leak in the strainmeter assemblage during  a circulation test, possibly from an imperfect or cracked weld on th e cement bypass conduit. After discussion, Operations Superintendent, Offshore Installation Manager, and Co-Chief scientists decided that this leak would not impact cementing.  

The wellhead was reentered at $0930~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February, and th e LTBMS assembly was slowly run into the wellhead, landing at 161 5 h. Post-landing cementing started after a final communication wit h the sensors; all were healthy. At $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ , the UWTV sent the releas e command by acoustic modem to the Activation Kit. Neither th e first command nor a following acoustic command activated the release mechanism, so mechanical release by running the UWT V guide funnel over the Activation Kit trigger pins was attempted. Between $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February and $0645\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 February, multiple attempts at triggering the manual release failed. Release was finall y activated at $0645\mathrm{~h~}$ on 5 February after two modifications to th e UWTV guide funnel and 14 passes of the UWTV guide funnel pas t the Activation Kit pins.  

The drill string was cleaned, pulled out of the hole, and lai d down, and moonpool equipment was secured in preparation fo r sailing back to Shimizu. The Chikyu arrived off Shimizu by $1630~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 February and anchored offshore. At $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 February, th e pilot boarded and guided the vessel to quayside. The gangplank wa s lowered, and the expedition scientists disembarked.  

# NanTroSEIZE LTBMS transect  

The Expedition 380 LTBMS in Hole C0006G was the thir d LTMBS  installed  in  the  NanTroSEIZE  transect.  Previously,   a LTBMS was installed in Hole C0002G during Expedition 322 i n 2010 (Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011) and another one was installed in Hole C0010A during Expedition 365 (Saffer et al., 2017). With the addition of the Expedition 380 installation, the array o f three LTBMS observatories now extends ${\sim}35\,\mathrm{km}$ landward from th e toe of the accretionary prism. The transect spans locations withi n and above regions of contrasting behavior in the megasplay faul t zone and plate boundary as a whole. Note that recent studies an d discussion suggest that the “megasplay” below Site C0002 is mor e likely to be the active plate boundary (which can mechanically connect either to the décollement or the shallow out-of-sequenc e thrusts), whereas the underlying reflector (top of oceanic crust) i s probably not active (Moore et al., 2007; Strasser et al., 2009). Th e LTBMS sites include a site above the updip edge of the “locked ” zone (Site C0002), a shallow site in the splay fault zone and its footwall side (Site C0010), and a site at the tip of the accretionary pris m (Site C0006, Expedition 380). Placing the LTBMSs at these sites wa s motivated by observed slip in the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake, which indicated that at some margins, coseismic ruptur e may propagate along the plate boundary all the way to the trenc h (e.g., Fujiwara et al., 2011). The importance of the last is emphasize d by newly observed, repeating SSEs within ${<}25\ \mathrm{km}$ of the trenc h (Araki, et al., 2017). The suite of NanTroSEIZE observatories ha s the potential to capture, in unprecedented detail, seismic an d microseismic activity, slow slip, and interseismic strain accumulation across a transect from the near trench to the seismogenic zone. Such temporally continuous and spatially distributed observation s are necessary to understand how each part of the plate boundar y functions through the seismic cycle of megathrust earthquakes.  

The LTBMS in Hole C0006G shares the same general design a s the two LTBMSs previously installed in Holes C0002G and C0010A. The Hole C0006G LTBMS includes an array of sensors designed t o monitor slow crustal deformation (e.g., strain, tilt, and pore pressure as a proxy for strain), seismic events such as VLF earthquakes, hydrologic transients associated with strain events, ambient por e pressure, and temperature. To ensure the long-term and continuou s monitoring necessary to capture events that occur over a wid e range of timescales, the borehole observatory will be connected to  a submarine cabled observation network (DONET; http://www.jamstec.go.jp/donet/e) in March 2018 to provide power and allow fo r higher sampling rates than can be achieved in a standalone mode. The Site C0002 and C0010 LTBMSs are already connected to thi s network, and the data can be viewed and downloaded at two openaccess observatory data portals, J-SEIS (http://join-web.jamstec.go.jp/join-portal/en) and the NanTroSEIZE Observatory Dat a Portal (http://offshore.geosc.psu.edu/about).  

# Selection of LTBMS monitoring zones from previous results at Site C0006  

No new coring or logging was conducted during Expedition 380 . Site C0006 was originally drilled during Expedition 314 with measurement while drilling (MWD) or logging while drilling (LWD) t o 885.5 mbsf in two holes ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ apart. Site C0006 was cored wit h four holes during Expedition 316 to a maximum depth of 603 mbsf. The LTBMS design and operational plan were based on these previous results, especially the continuous logging profiles. Therefore, the new Expedition 380 LTBMS Hole C0006G was positioned midway between the two Expedition 314 MWD/LWD holes (C0006 A and C0006B).  

From examination of the Site C0006 cores, Expedition 316 Scientists (2009) identified three primary lithologic units (Figure F4) . Unit I extends from the seafloor to ${\sim}27$ mbsf and comprises trenc h to slope transition facies. Unit II is composed of trench deposits divided into four subunits based mainly on variations in silt and san d content, with significant repetition of sequences caused by numerous thrust faults. Unit II extends to ${\sim}407\$ mbsf in Hole C0006E an d \~450 mbsf in Hole C00006F. Subunit IIA comprises mainly sanddominated trench wedge deposits, Subunit IIB comprises mixe d sand-mud trench wedge deposits, Subunit IIC comprises muddominated trench wedge deposits, and Subunit IID comprise s deep-marine basin to mud-dominated trench transition deposits. Unit III comprises late Miocene to Pleistocene deep-marine basi n deposits.  

Four primary logging units (Figure F2) were identified based o n differing trends and LWD log responses (Expedition 314 Scientists, 2009). Logging Unit I (0–197.8 m LWD depth below seafloor [LSF] )  

was interpreted as sandy and muddy deposits. Logging Unit I I $197.8{-}428.3\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{LSF}$ ) was interpreted as mud with occasional thic k sand layers. Logging Unit III $(428.3{-}711.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{LSF})$ was identified a s alternating beds of mud and sand and is divided into two subunits. The boundary between logging Units II and III might be a fault zon e (Figure F4), but this interpretation is not certain. Logging Unit I V $']11.5\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{LSF}$ to total depth) was interpreted as underthrust, coarse, trench-fill sediments. The main frontal thrust was identified by  a sudden decrease in gamma ray values (from ${\sim}90$ to $20{\-}50~\mathrm{gAPI})$ ) across the Unit III/IV boundary.  

Based on these results, the target zone for the main LTBMS instrument  package  (strainmeter/seismometer/tiltmeter/pressure ) was selected within the deepest part of logging Unit II at ${\sim}410{-}425$ mbsf (Figure F4). Here, the formation was expected to be relativel y competent mudstones suitable for monitoring formation pressur e and deformation in the hanging wall at the frontal toe of the prism. With the main package at 410–425 mbsf, the LTBMS design also allowed for (1) a deeper pressure monitoring screen at ${\sim}455{-}456$ mbsf within the open hole below the boundary between loggin g Units II and III and (2) placement of the five thermistor cable sensors from ${\sim}412$ to 237 mbsf spanning much of Unit IIC.  

As described in Operations, the LTBMS was successfully installed as of 5 February 2018. At the final sensor checks, all instruments and sensors tested properly with one minor exception, th e deepest sensor on the five-sensor thermistor cable. The final configuration of the installed LTBMS is illustrated in Figure F5.
