# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 35 7 successfully cored an east–west transect across the southern wall o f Atlantis Massif on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge t o study the links between serpentinization processes and microbia l activity in the shallow subsurface of highly altered ultramafic an d mafic sequences that have been uplifted to the seafloor along a major detachment fault zone. The primary goals of this expeditio n were to (1) examine the role of serpentinization in driving hydrothermal systems, sustaining microbial communities, and sequestering carbon; (2) characterize the tectonomagmatic processes tha t lead to lithospheric heterogeneities and detachment faulting; an d (3) assess how abiotic and biotic processes change with variations i n rock type and progressive exposure on the seafloor. To accomplis h these objectives, we developed a coring and sampling strategy base d around the use of seabed rock drills—the first time that such systems have been used in the scientific ocean drilling programs. Thi s technology was chosen in hopes of achieving high recovery of th e carbonate cap sequences and intact contact and deformation relationships. The expedition plans also included several engineerin g developments to assess geochemical parameters during drilling; sample bottom water before and after drilling; supply synthetic tracers during drilling for contamination assessment; gather downhol e electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility logs for assessin g fractures, fluid flow, and extent of serpentinization; and seal boreholes to provide opportunities for future experiments.  

Seventeen holes were drilled at nine sites across Atlantis Massif, with two sites on the eastern end of the southern wall (Sites M006 8 and M0075), three sites in the central section of the southern wal l north of the Lost City hydrothermal field (Sites M0069, M0072, an d M0076), two sites on the western end (Sites M0071 and M0073), and two sites north of the southern wall in the direction of the central dome of the massif and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sit e U1309 (Sites M0070 and M0074). Use of seabed rock drills enable d collection of more than $57\,\textrm{m}$ of core, with borehole penetratio n ranging from 1.3 to 16.44 meters below seafloor and core recoverie s as high as $75\%$ of total penetration. This high level of recovery o f shallow mantle sequences is unprecedented in the history of ocea n drilling. The cores recovered along the southern wall of Atlanti s Massif have highly heterogeneous lithologies, types of alteration, and degrees of deformation. The ultramafic rocks are dominated b y harzburgites with intervals of dunite and minor pyroxenite veins, a s well as gabbroic rocks occurring as melt impregnations and veins, all of which provide information about early magmatic processe s and the magmatic evolution in the southernmost portion of Atlanti s Massif. Dolerite dikes and basaltic rocks represent the latest stage o f magmatic activity. Overall, the ultramafic rocks recovered durin g Expedition 357 revealed a high degree of serpentinization, as well a s metasomatic talc-amphibole-chlorite overprinting and local rodingitization. Metasomatism postdates an early phase of serpentinization but predates late-stage intrusion and alteration of dolerite dike s and the extrusion of basalt. The intensity of alteration is generall y lower in the gabbroic and doleritic rocks. Chilled margins in dolerite intruded into talc-amphibole-chlorite schists are observed at th e most eastern Site M0075. Deformation in Expedition 357 cores i s variable and dominated by brecciation and formation of localize d shear zones; the degree of carbonate veining was lower than anticipated. All types of variably altered and deformed ultramafic an d mafic rocks occur as components in sedimentary breccias and a s fault scarp rubble. The sedimentary cap rocks include basaltic breccias with a carbonate sand matrix and/or fossiliferous carbonate. Fresh glass on basaltic components was observed in some of th e breccias.  

The expedition also successfully applied new technologies , namely (1) extensively using an in situ sensor package and wate r sampling system on the seabed drills for evaluating real-time dissolved oxygen and methane, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, temperature, and conductivity during drilling; (2) deploying a borehole plug system for sealing seabed drill boreholes at four sites t o allow access for future sampling; and (3) proving that tracers can b e delivered into drilling fluids when using seabed drills. The rock drill sensor packages and water sampling enabled detection of elevate d dissolved methane and hydrogen concentrations during and/or after drilling, with “hot spots” of hydrogen observed over Site s M0068–M0072 and methane over Sites M0070–M0072. Shipboar d determination of contamination tracer delivery confirmed appropriate sample handling procedures for microbiological and geochemical analyses, which will aid all subsequent microbiological investigations that are part of the science party sampling plans, a s well as verify this new tracer delivery technology for seabed drill rigs. Shipboard investigation of biomass density in select sample s revealed relatively low and variable cell densities, and enrichmen t experiments set up shipboard reveal growth. Thus, we anticipat e achieving many of the deep biosphere–related objectives of the expedition through continued scientific investigation in the comin g years.  

Finally, although not an objective of the expedition, we were serendipitously able to generate a high-resolution ( $20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ per pixel ) multibeam bathymetry map across the entire Atlantis Massif an d the nearby fracture zone, Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and eastern conjugate, taking advantage of weather and operational downtime. Thi s will assist science party members in evaluating and interpreting tectonic and mass-wasting processes at Atlantis Massif.  

# Introduction  

Drilling at Atlantis Massif focuses on two relatively recent discoveries in marine geosciences: off-axis serpentinite-hosted flui d circulation as exemplified by the Lost City hydrothermal fiel d (LCHF) and oceanic core complexes (OCCs) as major component s of slow-spreading ridges. An estimated $40\%$ or more of the Atlanti c Ocean floor was formed by interlinked processes of asymmetric extension, magmatism, and detachment faulting resulting in the exposure of mantle and lower crustal rocks in OCCs (Dick et al., 2008; Cannat et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2006, 2008; Ildefonse et al., 2007; Escartín et al., 2008; Tucholke et al., 2008). OCCs incorporate highl y reactive olivine-rich rocks that interact with seawater over a rang e of temperatures to produce both high- and low-temperature hydrothermal systems (Douville et al., 1997, 2002; Charlou et al., 1998, 2002; Sagalevich et al., 2000; Kelley et al., 2005; McCaig et al., 2007). Chemical exchange between the mantle and the hydrosphere supports abundant microbial communities in regions of focused flui d discharge in both types of systems (Schrenk et al., 2004; Takai et al., 2004; Nercessian et al., 2005; Brazelton et al., 2006; Campbell et al., 2006; Perner et al., 2007). However, it is unknown whether activ e microbial communities are also sustained by fluid–rock interactio n in mantle-derived host rocks or in diffusely venting areas that surround focused-flow sites. At Atlantis Massif, we can study biogeochemical and tectonomagmatic processes related to three phases i n the evolution of an OCC:  

1. Serpentinization processes associated with active fluid discharge at the LCHF and the influence of serpentinization on microbial communities in a range of environments, including carbonate sediments, alteration in both ultramafic and mafic rocks, and zones of subsurface fluid flow of various intensities.   
2. Evolution of the massif and the effects of alteration processes on microbial activity as it was progressively denuded to the seafloor and rapidly cooled from around $1\,\mathrm{Ma}$ onward. This includes understanding the longevity of and possible precursors to the LCHF, determining the evolution of serpentinization with progressive denudation, and evaluating variations in microbial communities with seafloor age and as the dominant lithology changes from ultramafic to mafic in composition.   
3. Early history of the detachment fault, which localized high strain deformation and fluid flow at $300^{\circ}{-}400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Schroeder and John, 2004; Boschi et al., 2006; Karson et al., 2006; Escartín et al., 2003), possibly as deep as several kilometers below the seafloor.  

# Background Active serpentinite-hosted hydrothermal systems and chemical exchange between the mantle, biosphere, and hydrosphere  

Approximately $30,\!000{\mathrm{~km}}$ or roughly $50\%$ of the global midocean ridges are spreading at rates ${<}40\mathrm{\mm/y}$ and extend from th e Arctic Ocean, along the entire Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR), and int o the southwest Indian Ocean. The recognition that ultramafic rock s are tectonically emplaced along major normal faults at these slowspreading ridge environments has led to new considerations of th e geophysical, geochemical, and biological consequences of serpentinization for the global marine system (Figure F1) (Cannat, 1993; Dick et al., 2003, 2008; Smith et al., 2006; Escartín et al., 2003). Serpentinization is associated with the uptake or release of man y major and minor components, such as $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ Mg, Ca, Si, Cl, Li, B, C, and S, with important consequences for long-term global geochemical fluxes and biogeochemical cycles (Alt and Shanks, 1998, 2003, 2006; Früh-Green et al., $2004;$ Boschi et al., 2008; Delacour et al., 2008a, 2008b, 2008c). In addition, serpentinization reactions lead t o the production of highly reduced fluids and result in high concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and reduced C-species including methane, ethane, propane, and straight-chain hydrocarbons (Proskurowski et al., 2006, 2008; Konn et al., 2009; Holm and Charlou, 2001; Foustouko s and Seyfriend, 2004). These reduced species are believed to for m through Sabatier or Fischer-Tropsch type (FTT) reactions catalyze d by Fe-, Ni-, and Cr-bearing minerals and have important consequences for biological activity on and within the seafloor and fo r global carbon cycling (Kelley et al., 2005; Takai et al., $2004;$ Brazelton et al., 2006; Perner et al., 2007; Proskurowski et al., 2008; Kohn et al., 2009; Holm and Charlou, 2001).  

To date, six sites along the MAR—the high-temperature Rainbow, Logatchev, Ashadze, and Nibelungen fields and the lower temperature Lost City and Saldanha hydrothermal fields—are known t o be hosted in mafic and ultramafic basement rocks, and more ar e likely to be found. Studies of the Lost City system suggest that low - to moderate-temperature ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal system s are long lived and occur in the seafloor to $2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Ludwig et al., 2011; Früh-Green et al., 2003). Serpentinization reactions at less tha n ${\sim}200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ play a key role in the production of high-pH fluids, whic h control carbonate precipitation and have important consequence s for the sequestration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from seawater. Diffuse high-pH fluid s also directly promote lithification of overlying sedimentary deposit s (Früh-Green et al., 2003), which in turn affect heat flow and flui d circulation pathways. In contrast to basalt-hosted hydrothermal systems, where conceptual models of the fluid pathways, alteratio n reactions,  and  element  uptake  are  relatively  well  constraine d (Wheat and Fisher, 2008; Wheat et al., 2003; Fisher, 1998; Fisher an d Becker, 2000), little is known of the fluid pathways and degree o f heat and mass transfer that can support a subsurface biosphere i n such moderate-temperature, serpentinite-hosted hydrothermal systems.  

# Impact of serpentinization on the subsurface biosphere  

One goal of our planned drilling was to explore the subsurfac e environment and the potential for a hydrogen-based deep biospher e in an area undergoing active serpentinization. Lost City is characterized by extreme conditions never before seen in the deep marin e environment. Carbonate-brucite structures are venting warm (temperatures up to $91^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ ), high-pH (9–11) hydrothermal fluids that ar e metal and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ poor and have high concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ (up to 1 5 $\mathrm{mmol/kg})$ , ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ $(1\mathrm{-}2\mathrm{\mmol/kg})$ , organic acids, and low molecula r weight hydrocarbons (Kelley et al., 2005; Proskurowski et al., 2006, 2008; Konn et al., 2009). Formate and low molecular weight hydrocarbons are believed to be formed abiologically during serpentinization reactions at depth (Lang et al., 2010, 2012). Foustoukos an d Seyfried (2004) indicate that even small amounts of $_\mathrm{Cr}$ -bearin g phases typical of ultramafic rock types can enhance the synthesis o f short-chain alkanes, providing an abiotic mechanism for hydrocarbon production in ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems (McCollom and Seewald, 2001, 2003, 2006; McCollom, 2007). Th e production of $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ abiotic hydrocarbons, and possibly format e during serpentinization reactions, along with mixing with oxidize d seawater, provide metabolic energy for chemolithoautotrophic an d heterotrophic organisms (McCollom, 2007; McCollom and Shock, 1997). Development of an ecosystem depends on the availabilit y and renewal of a carbon source, electron donors (such as $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4},$ $\mathrm{H}_{2}S,$ , and $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ), and electron acceptors (particularly $\mathrm{O}_{2},\,\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{~-~}}}$ , an d $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ . In ultramafic environments, electron donors are generall y unlimited in the form of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4},$ whereas electron acceptor s depend greatly on the fate of sulfate (which is $1{-}4\;\mathrm{mM}$ in Lost Cit y fluids) (Kelley et al., 2005) and on seawater recharge and mixin g with serpentinizing fluids. Numerical models show that ultramafichosted systems may be capable of supplying about twice the metabolic energy as analogous deep-sea hydrothermal systems hosted i n basaltic rocks (McCollom, 2007).  

Considering the extent of ultramafic environments on the seafloor and the longevity of seawater circulation during serpentinization,  the  total  biomass  of  the  ultramafic-hosted  subsurfac e biosphere may be substantial. Some researchers also propose tha t organic compounds produced abiotically in serpentinites may contribute to certain oil and gas reservoirs (Gold, 1979, 1999; Szatmari, 1989) and that similar reactions may have been the source of prebiotic organic compounds on early Earth (Holm and Andersson, 1998; Shock and Schulte, 1998; Sleep et al., 2004). Conditions o f early Earth were likely similar to the hydrogen-rich anaerobic environment within the subsurface of Lost City, and the alkaline conditions are favorable for some aspects of prebiotic chemistry, such a s formation of RNA-bearing vesicles (Russell, 2003). Despite the potential importance of a subsurface hydrogen-based biosphere, it ha s not been well studied. Previous studies of ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems concentrated on active vent areas and their hydrothermal deposits (Schrenk et al., 2004; Takai et al., 2004; Nercessia n et al., 2005; Brazelton et al., 2006, 2009, 2010; Perner et al., 2007; Brazelton and Baross, 2009). Because of the significant difference i n volatile compositions and limited $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ stability at high pH, one ca n expect that biotopes hosted in serpentinizing environments will differ significantly from axial basaltic-hosted vent systems in whic h $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is a dominant volatile species (Perner et al., 2007; Proskurowsk i et al., 2004, 2006, 2008; McCollom and Seewald, 2006; McCollom, 2007). In addition, the mixing of oxidized seawater with highly reduced fluids leads to complex 3-D gradients in fluid chemistry an d temperature that may influence microbial distribution and activity. Substantially different habitats harboring various types of aerobi c and anaerobic metabolisms may thus occur over a narrow spatia l scale. However, essentially nothing is known from in situ studies o f the nature and importance of microbial communities in serpentinizing basement rocks and in areas of diffuse flow or ho w these vary with lithology and seafloor age. In addition, little i s known about the role microbes play in controlling fluid compositions and carbonate precipitation (Dupraz et al., 2009; Ehrlich, 2009).  

# Carbon budget of hydrothermal circulation  

Large-amplitude anomalies exhibiting very low total dissolve d manganese/methane ratios  in  the water  column  above faultbounded peridotite bodies confirm that seawater-peridotite interactions generate extensive ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}$ plumes (Charlou et al., 1991, 1998; German et al., 2009; Bougault et al., 1993; Rona et al., 1992). Additional evidence that considerable volumes of hydrocarbons may b e generated during serpentinization processes is provided by por e waters sampled during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 125 at  a serpentinized seamount in the Mariana fore arc, where high concentrations of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and ${\cal C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}$ were measured (Haggerty, 1991; Mott l and Haggerty, 1989). These studies imply that a significant amoun t of carbon is transferred from the upper mantle to the hydrospher e through serpentinization processes.  

Stable isotope and radiocarbon measurements on methan e venting at Lost City demonstrate that methane is ultimately derive d abiotically from mantle $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as opposed to seawater bicarbonat e (Proskurowski et al., 2008) and imply that seawater bicarbonate carried with recharge fluids is largely removed, presumably in carbonate minerals, before the abiotic reactions that form methane occur. This process is consistent with similar studies of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in high-temperature fluids from the Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuc a Ridge (Proskurowski et al., 2004) that indicate a magmatic source o f carbon in hydrothermal fluids that were venting after a 1999 earthquake and require that a large fraction of seawater bicarbonate originally  present  in  downwelling  fluids  is  removed  durin g hydrothermal  circulation.  Extraction  of  seawater  bicarbonat e during recharge processes at the LCHF is substantiated by stabl e isotope compositions of calcite veins in the basement rocks (FrühGreen et al., 2003) that point to a dominant seawater component i n the fluids at the time of calcite precipitation. Thus, the calcite vei n networks in the Atlantis Massif footwall indicate seawater recharg e pathways during the lifetime of the system that provide local domains for mixing of oxidizing seawater and reduced hydrotherma l fluids with important consequences for the existence of a deep biosphere. Because of the unique relationship between $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ i n serpentinizing systems, understanding the controls on the production and consumption of $C O_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CH_{4}}$ is fundamental to understanding carbon biogeochemical cycles in these systems. At Los t City, significant quantities of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are also removed from seawate r in forming the chimneys themselves. In addition, oceanic serpentinites may be a previously unrecognized reservoir of organi c carbon, possibly originating from dissolved organic carbon in seawater (Delacour et al., 2008c). However, it is still uncertain whethe r there is net fixation of carbon from the hydrosphere into the soli d Earth during these processes.  

When considering global carbon budgets and the potential fo r $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sequestration through carbonate precipitation in peridotite s (Kelemen and Matter, 2008; Andreani et al., 2009; Boschi et al., 2009), it is important to constrain the source of carbon, the volum e of carbonate, and the rate of precipitation in ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal systems and the longevity of hydrothermal circulation. In this system, there may be positive feedback in which high reaction rates are enhanced by exothermic heating during serpentinization where permeability and reactive surface area are maintained o r enhanced by cracking in response to volume expansion (Keleme n and Matter, 2008). If so, quantifying carbonate precipitation durin g serpentinization has direct implications for evaluating the potential of in situ peridotites for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ capture and storage. In the case of th e LCHF, although we can constrain the current focused output of th e system, we do not know the large-scale patterns of recharge an d more diffuse discharge or the volume of carbonate veining in th e footwall and have only a minimum estimate of the longevity of th e system (Früh-Green et al., 2003; Ludwig et al., 2011). To evaluat e how widespread Lost City–type intermediate-temperature system s are in slow-spreading environments and to what distance from th e ridge axis seawater circulation and serpentinization persist, w e need a better understanding of the controls on the location of th e LCHF as well as spatial and temporal constraints on serpentinization and carbonate precipitation. Much remains to be understoo d about the necessary conditions (pressure, temperature, mineral reactions, and fluid fluxes) to form carbonate deposits and the controls on fluid circulation and its role in supporting a subsurfac e biosphere.  

# The evolution of hydrothermal circulation associated with detachment faulting  

Another important question to address through drilling concerned the links between detachment faults, deformation, and hydrothermal circulation that feed high-temperature mid-ocean-ridg e vent fields. Research on detachment faulting and OCCs indicate s that this style of oceanic spreading is intimately linked to hydrothermal circulation and encompasses a wide variety of fluid flow and hydrothermal regimes (McCaig et al., 2007). High-temperature flui d circulation is well documented mineralogically and geochemicall y (Schroeder and John, 2004; Boschi et al., 2006; McCaig et al., 2010), and uplift along detachments may promote circulation and alteration within the footwall (Andreani et al., 2007). McCaig et al. (2007) propose temporal evolution in the style of hydrothermal circulation associated with the development of OCCs: from high-temperature systems hosted in the basaltic hanging wall within the rif t valley (e.g., Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse [TAG]-type), to high-temperature ultramafic-hosted systems within the footwall (Rainbowtype), and ultimately to off-axis ultramafic-hosted systems withi n the footwall (Lost City–type). At Atlantis Massif we can study th e first and third of these circulation types.  

Recent estimates suggest that focused flow in large high-temperature hydrothermal fields may dominate the transfer of much o f the total heat from the ridges to the oceans in slow-spreading environments (German et al., 2009) and are therefore fundamental i n the thermal evolution of our planet. Sampling at different location s along the former detachment fault will allow us to evaluate record s of fluid-rock interaction and metasomatism and test the hypothesi s that exhumation faults serve as long-lived permeable pathways fo r hydrothermal flow that can feed moderate- to high-temperature hydrothermal vents (McCaig et al., 2007). In ultramafic/mafic systems, assemblages of talc-tremolite-chlorite form at $>\!350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Boschi et al., 2006, 2008; McCaig et al., 2010), typical of black smoker discharg e zones, whereas serpentine-prehnite-hydrogarnet assemblages for m at lower temperature vents (Frost et al., 2008; Bach and Klein, 2009). Spatially constrained sampling of the Atlantis Massif detachmen t system gives us an opportunity to map these variations in metamorphic assemblages, which in combination with geochemical and isotopic studies will help constrain temperatures and fluid-rock ratio s (Delacour et al., 2008d).  

# Tectonomagmatic processes at asymmetric slow spreading ridges  

OCCs are exposed in volcanic-poor areas where detachmen t faults remain active over periods of 1 to 3 My. These faults accommodate slip of up to $125\,\mathrm{km}$ (e.g., the Godzilla Mullion [Ohara et al., 2001, 2002]), implying that an extremely weak zone of localize d strain is maintained for significant periods of time. The envisage d mechanisms controlling long-lived stretching of the lithospher e along oceanic detachment faults call for feedback with hydrothermal fluid flow along the fault and the growth of weak hydrous minerals (notably serpentine and talc) that favor localization of ongoin g deformation (Escartín et al., 2008). This process involves a crackseal mechanism associated with fluid circulation and mineral precipitation and could be a candidate for the generation of low-magnitude microseismicity.  

Numerous recent geophysical and geological studies, as well a s drilling at ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites 735B, 1275, and U1309 (Ildefonse et al., 2007; Dick et al., 2000; Kelemen e t al., 2007; Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006) have changed ou r view of how slow-spreading ridges operate. Magmatic activity is locally relatively high, as evidenced by an abundance of gabbros/diabase exposed and drilled in these regions. (e.g., at Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program Site U1309; Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006). Th e unexpected abundance of gabbro hosted by mantle peridotite suggests that significant quantities of melt are generated beneath thes e volcanic-poor ridge segments, but much is trapped in the mantle a s it turns into lithosphere beneath the ridge axis, rather than migrating upward to form a continuous magmatic crust (Figure F1). Ongoing  magmatic  activity  associated  with  asymmetric  norma l faulting results in a heterogeneous mafic and ultramafic lithospher e with diabase intrusions exposed in the denuded footwall, wherea s accretion of volcanic seafloor persists in the hanging wall (Cannat e t al., 2006; Smith et al., 2006; Ildefonse et al., 2007; Karson et al., 2006). These results are consistent with recent numerical model s that suggest about $50\%$ of ridge extension must be accommodate d by magmatic accretion to allow low-angle detachment faults to develop (Tucholke et al., 2008). This magmatic activity is probably essential  to  initiate  and  maintain  large  high-temperatur e hydrothermal systems (McCaig et al., 2007; Rona et al., 1993; Lalo u et al., 1995; deMartin et al., 2007; Humphris and Cann, 2000; Cannat et al., 2004) and provides crucial feedback mechanisms betwee n hydration-promoted melting, hydration, detachment faulting, an d mass transfer (Jöns et al., 2009; Escartín et al., 2008; Reinen et al., 1991; Moore and Rymer, 2007; Scruggs, 1997).  

Understanding the links between faults in the brittle axial domain and deformation of the deeper ductile lithosphere is a key parameter for determining the mechanisms accommodating plat e separation at mid-ocean ridges characterized by roughly equal partitioning of tectonic and magmatic spreading. Detachment fault s are thought to initiate as high-angle normal faults extending ${\sim}8–10$ km; hence, the exhumed footwall provides a cross section throug h the upper part of the lithosphere (Figure F1). We proposed to sample the exposed, and therefore inactive, section of the Atlantis Massif fault system. Rocks recovered from near the breakaway (wester n side of the massif) originated from shallow depths, and rocks fro m the easternmost side originated from depths of several kilometers. We did not plan to drill deep into the footwall, as this was achieve d during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 304/305.  

# Proposed drill sites Southern wall of Atlantis Massif  

The southern wall of Atlantis Massif is cut by steep norma l faults that, together with mass wasting, expose a cross section of th e lithosphere along a near-vertical, $3800\,\mathrm{m}$ high scarp north of the Atlantis Fracture Zone (Figure F2). Extensive submersible and dredg e sampling along this scarp recovered primarily serpentinized ultramafic rocks $(\sim\!70\%)$ with interspersed lenses of gabbroic rock s $(\sim\!30\%)$ (Kelley et al., 2005; Schroeder and John, 2004; Boschi et al., 2006; Karson et al., 2006; Blackman et al., 2002). These samples o f peridotites are primarily depleted spinel harzburgites and are affected by variable but high degrees of serpentinization (in general $70\%{-}100\%$ ). An approximately $100~\mathrm{m}$ thick zone of heterogeneou s deformation and metamorphic assemblages considered to represent the zone of detachment faulting (Karson et al., 2006) was previously mapped for at least $3\,\mathrm{km}$ along the crest of the Atlantis Massi f southern wall in the vicinity of the LCHF. Within this zone, strai n localization and focused fluid flow is marked by the presence o f centimeter- to decimeter-thick domains of mylonitic serpentinize d peridotites and metasomatic talc-rich and/or amphibole-chlorite– rich rocks that form shear zones with anastomosing to laminate d foliations  surrounding  less  deformed  peridotites  and  gabbr o (Schroeder and John, 2004; Boschi et al., 2006; Karson et al., 2006). Fresh high-temperature peridotite mylonites locally preserve unaltered olivine relics, which suggests an early high-temperature history of the fault zone (Schroeder and John, 2004; Boschi et al., 2006, 2008). These observations indicate that the detachment cannot b e considered a single fault boundary between deformed and undeformed rocks but is rather a broad “damage” zone with localize d high-strain deformation within a heterogeneous upper mantle section. Pelagic limestones and sedimentary breccias with basaltic an d serpentinite clasts cover the zone of detachment faulting and form  a nearly flat-lying sedimentary cap (Figure F3) believed to act as  a barrier for heat and hydrothermal fluids (Kelley et al., 2005; Karso n et al., 2006; Früh-Green et al., 2003; Schroeder et al., 2002).  

# Lost City hydrothermal field  

The LCHF extends more than $400\;\mathrm{m}$ in length, with numerou s active and inactive carbonate-brucite structures up to $^{60\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ i n height hosting dense microbial communities with limited phylogenetic diversity (Schrenk et al., 2004; Brazelton et al., 2006; Meht a and Baross, 2006). The high-temperature anoxic interior zones o f the chimneys harbor biofilms dominated by a single phylotype o f archaea, referred to as Lost City Methanosarcinales, whereas bacteria phylogenetically related to $\mathrm{{CH}_{4}.}$ - and S-oxidizers are mostl y found in the oxygenated outer walls of carbonate chimneys, wher e fluid chemistry is influenced by the ingress and mixing of seawate r (Kelley et al., 2005; Schrenk et al., $2004;$ ; Brazelton et al., 2006; Lan g et al., 2012).  

Older nonventing sites are dominated by a single phylotype belonging to the ANME-1 clade of anaerobic methane–oxidizing archaea  (Brazelton  et  al.,  2006).  Organic  geochemical  studie s identified archaeal biomarkers in the chimneys that include isoprenoid hydrocarbons, glycerol diphytanyl diethers, and glycero l dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (Bradley et al., $2009{\mathrm{a}}$ , 2009b; Méhay et al., 2009, 2013) and bacterial biomarkers that include fatt y acids, alcohols, hopanoids, and nonisoprenoidal diethers. The integration of genomic data (Brazelton et al., 2006, 2009, 2010; Brazleton  and  Baross,  2009)  and  compound-specific  isotop e characterization of the lipid biomarkers indicate variations in metabolism involving methanogenesis, methane and sulfur oxidation, and sulfate reduction over small scales during biofilm growth. Analyses of organic carbon in the hydrothermal deposits show that up t o $50\%$ of the microbial biomass is synthesized from this mantle carbon in areas where sulfate reduction is important (Lang et al., 2012). These studies imply that a significant amount of abiogenic carbo n can be transferred from upper mantle domains to the biosphere an d hydrosphere through serpentinization processes. A study utilizin g next-generation sequencing technology shows that the archaeal an d bacterial biofilm communities undergo dramatic changes as environmental conditions in Lost City chimneys change over time (Brazelton et al., 2010). Microorganisms that comprise a small fractio n of the community in the hottest, youngest chimneys may be th e dominant species in older chimneys with different mineralogy an d fluid chemistry. This observation indicates that these species ca n remain in the rare biosphere for at least hundreds of years befor e they find themselves in conditions for which they were optimall y adapted. Sampling the proposed Atlantis Massif transect may revea l dynamics of the rare biosphere operating on even longer timescales.  

Fracture and fault networks in the basement below Lost Cit y provide pathways for the fluids both vertically, forming the spir e structures, and horizontally, forming carbonate growths parallel t o the foliation in the serpentinites (Kelley et al., 2001, 2005; Ludwig e t al., 2006). The nearly horizontal sheet-like style of flow is very different to the vertical conduits that typify black smoker environments (Kelley et al., 2005). Field mapping and observations indicat e that fluid expulsion also occurs along steep fractures that exten d into the carbonate cap sediments (Figure F3).  

# Central dome of Atlantis Massif  

Expedition 304/305 targeted the central dome of Atlantis Massif. Drilling into the footwall was exceptionally successful in Hol e U1309D ( $1656~\mathrm{m}$ water depth), resulting in a stable $1415.5\;\mathrm{m}$ dee p hole with very high average recovery $(75\%)$ (Expedition 304/30 5 Scientists, 2006; Expedition Scientific Party, 2005a, 2005b). However, the recovered lithology was unexpected: extremely limite d proportions $(<\!0.3\%)$ of mantle peridotite but a predominance o f gabbro $(91.4\%)$ ; mostly very primitive), ultramafic intrusive sequences (including troctolites; $5.7\%$ ), and diabase $(3\%)$ . Drilling results suggest that the gabbro body is a discrete body hosted within  a mantle protolith (Ildefonse et al., 2007; Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006). Drilling at Site U1309 was instrumental in overturnin g many predrilling hypotheses and has led to a need for revised paradigms regarding processes of crustal accretion in these environments, particularly magma generation and distribution.  

In general, Hole U1309D gabbros are remarkably undeformed . Evidence for talc-tremolite-chlorite schists, which mark the detachment fault on the southern wall, is confined to around $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ of intac t core, clasts in fault breccia, and loose cobbles in several holes. Th e thickness of fault rocks cannot be more than $15\,\mathrm{m}$ , as gabbros occu r within $^{20\mathrm{~m~}}$ of the seafloor, suggesting significant thinning compared with the south wall. However, the fault zone may also be expressed by several zones of breccia within the upper $120\,\mathrm{m}$ of Hole s U1309B and U1309D and by a deeper zone at around 700 meter s below seafloor (mbsf) (Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006; Expedition Scientific Party 2005a, 2005b; Michibayashi et al., 2008). Detailed  paleomagnetic  studies  on  cores  from  Hole  U1309 D reoriented using borehole wall imagery demonstrate that the Atlantis Massif footwall has undergone a bulk tectonic rotation of at leas t $46^{\circ}\pm6^{\circ}$ around a ridge-parallel $\mathrm{[011^{\circ}}.$ -trending) axis, consistent wit h a “rolling hinge” flexural unloading model for the detachment faul t system (Morris et al., 2009). Together, these results challenge th e commonly held hypothesis that the bulk rheology of slow-spreadin g lithosphere is primarily controlled by cooling of a simple thermal structure and instead suggest that strain localization favored by lithologic contrasts and hydrous alteration are also important, as well as perhaps highly heterogeneous cooling around large hydrothermal systems (Boschi et al., 2006; Karson et al., 2006; Escartín et al., 2003; McCaig et al., 2010).  

# Scientific objectives The need for shallow drilling across Atlantis Massif  

Our drilling strategy focused on obtaining good recovery o f continuous sequences in the upper $50{-}80\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , both along an east– west profile at the top of the Atlantis Massif southern wall (in th e vicinity of the LCHF) and in a north–south profile toward the central dome (where the substrate is gabbroic). Currently, almost nothing  is  known  about  the  existence  of  a  serpentinite-hoste d subsurface biosphere (in any setting, marine or terrestrial), let alon e its variation. Drilling the east–west profile would allow a better understanding of the evolution of the detachment fault and how microbial communities evolve as ultramafic rocks are emplaced on th e seafloor. Drilling the north–south profile would allow assessment o f the role of gabbros versus serpentinized ultramafic rocks in supporting ecosystems and in localizing detachment faults.  

Specific hypotheses that we proposed to test by drilling were a s follows:  

• An extensive subsurface hydrogen-based biosphere persists in serpentinizing lithosphere. These communities evolve and adapt to variations in diffuse fluid flow, fluid chemistry, heat flow distribution, and age of exposure on seafloor aging. • Serpentinizing environments sustain higher biomass than gabbroic-dominated domains. • Progressive denudation and seawater interaction with ultramafic- and mafic-dominated lithosphere lead to ultramafichosted hydrothermal systems that change from high-temperature, magmatically driven sulfide deposits to low-temperature hydrothermal carbonate deposits. Moderate- to low-temperature hydrothermal activity may last for hundreds of thousands of years, and the change to carbonate-dominated systems occurs  

as soon as ultramafic rocks are exposed on the seafloor in the absence of active volcanism.   
• The transition from sulfide- to carbonate-dominated environments can be detected by changes in the rare biosphere of the associated microbial communities.   
• Zones of intense carbonate veining underlie sites of diffuse venting and represent seawater recharge and net sequestration of $C O_{2}$ from the hydrosphere into the lithosphere. These zones are biological hot spots where microbial communities are supported by the high fluxes of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ mixing with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .   
• Strain localization on detachments results from weak serpentine-, talc-, amphibole-, and chlorite-bearing assemblages concentrated into ultramafic rather than gabbroic rocks.  

# Constraining the deep biosphere in a serpentinizing environment  

A major question to be addressed is whether serpentinizatio n supports microbial communities in the basement rocks similar t o those in the carbonate chimneys and fluids at the LCHF. The warmest, highest pH domains of carbonate chimneys are dominated by  a single clade of Lost City Methanosarcinales archaea (Schrenk et al., 2004). Other organisms are apparently unable to succeed in the extreme (low $\Sigma{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ , high $\mathsf{p H},$ , and highly reducing) conditions of th e serpentinizing fluids at temperatures approaching $100^{\circ}C$ . Zone s where $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and electron acceptors such as oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate are provided by mixing ambient seawater with hydrotherma l fluid harbor diverse bacteria including methane- and sulfur-oxidizing organisms.  

Because fluid flow in the basement rocks is likely to be muc h more diffuse than the focused flow creating the Lost City chimneys, it is likely that these fluids will contain more $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and electron acceptors mixed in from seawater and/or not yet reduced by serpentinization reactions. Therefore, we hypothesized that microbia l communities in the underlying peridotites would show greater diversity than those in the main chimney complex. Also, because o f the immense volume of Atlantis Massif expected to host hydrothermal circulation, the biomass of this subsurface community coul d potentially dwarf that of the Lost City chimneys. In particular, primary producers utilizing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from seawater and reduced species , such as $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ from serpentinizing fluids, should flourish. Sulfate i s likely to be an important electron acceptor in subsurface communities because sulfate concentrations remain high in Lost City fluid s $(1{-}4\;\mathrm{mM})$ (Kelley et al., 2005). We expected that domains with sufficient concentrations of sulfate will host consortia of anaerobi c methane oxidizing archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria, as observed in gas hydrates and mud volcanoes (Orphan et al., 2001). Therefore, Atlantis Massif could potentially host extensive communities dominated by both methanogens and methanotrophs. Constraining the distribution and activity of these organisms is essentia l for understanding biological carbon cycling through slow-spreading ocean crust.  

In addition to chemolithoautotrophs, heterotrophic organism s are expected to be present in the ultramafic subsurface, where the y could be supported by organic compounds generated by serpentinization. Environmental DNA sequencing of Lost City fluids (Brazelton et al., 2006, 2009, 2010; Brazelton and Baross, 2009) and lipi d biomarker analyses (Bradley et al., 2009a, 2009b; Méhay et al., 2009, 2013) reveal the presence of archaeal species that are absent in th e carbonate chimneys. These include 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to Thermococcales (Euryarchaeota phylum) and uncultured Crenarchaeota, which are surprisingly similar to those i n diffuse hydrothermal fluids of basalt-hosted hydrothermal system s (Brazleton et al., 2006). In such systems, the presence of these thermophilic archaea is indicative of an organic-rich, high-temperatur e subseafloor biotope (Summit and Baross, 2001). Although thei r physiology is unknown, the Thermococcales representatives ar e most closely related to heterotrophs, implying a source of organic s in the subsurface. The proposed drill cores would allow us to directly test whether heterotrophic communities are abundant withi n Atlantis Massif and whether their distribution is consistent with  a community supported by serpentinization-derived organic compounds.  

The proposed east–west transect would also provide an excellent opportunity to explore the rare biosphere (Brazelton et al., 2010) of subsurface communities inhabiting rocks differing in ag e by ${\sim}1\mathrm{~Ma}$ . Virtually nothing is known about the biogeography o f subsurface communities in oceanic crust. Our sampling scheme will shed light on important questions of whether microbial communities potentially adapted to magmatically driven, sulfide-dominate d environments and are able to transition to serpentinizing, carbonate-dominated environments over a ${\sim}1$ My timescale. Is there an y overlap between the communities? At what point are the sulfideadapted organisms succeeded by carbonate-adapted organisms ? Are species in the westernmost, oldest rocks already present at ver y rare levels in the easternmost, youngest rocks, indicating that species can remain rare for up to 1 My before “blooming”?  

Some microbiological results are available from Expedition 30 5 at Atlantis Massif to guide our efforts (Mason et al., 2010). Rock s were collected for molecular analyses from 400 to 1400 mbsf, an d aerobic bacteria were cultured in variable lithologies (gabbro an d olivine-bearing gabbro) with variable $(10\%{-}50\%)$ alteration deepe r than $1300~\mathrm{mbsf}$ (temperature $>75^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ ). Mason et al. (2010) had n o success culturing bacteria from the troctolites, and no archaea wer e found. The microorganisms cultured from the central dome ar e most similar to organisms known to degrade hydrocarbons and ar e distinct from those cultured from LCHF carbonates (Schrenk et al., $2004;$ ; Brazelton et al., 2006).  

# Importance of recovering carbonate cap sequences  

Polymictic sedimentary breccias overlain by pelagic limestone s or chalks form the $1\mathrm{-}2\textrm{m}$ thick, flat-lying carbonate cap that wa s previously mapped over a large portion of the top of Atlantis Massi f (Figure F3) (Kelley et al., 2001, 2005; Blackman et al., 2002). The diffusely percolating high-pH fluids emanating from the underlyin g serpentinites locally promoted rapid sediment lithification and ma y provide an important niche for microbial activity kilometers awa y from areas of focused flow. Recovery of intact sedimentary sequences was not possible during Expedition 304/305, and this remained a priority attainable with our proposed drilling strategy.  

At present, we have no constraints on the presence, diversity , and abundance of microbial communities in the sediments. Th e carbonate cap was thus an important target for drilling to evaluat e its role in microbial activity in a carbonate-dominated environment, one in which the chemistry (with precursor sedimentary organi c and inorganic carbon sources), porosity, and temperature structur e is different than those of hydrothermal carbonate towers or in basement peridotites. This environment likely supports a more divers e microbial community that may be distinct from those in the basement, carbonate chimneys, and fissure fillings. The wide lateral extent of the carbonate cap has implications for the quantification o f total chemical fluxes and the diversity of ecosystems that may b e supported by peridotite-hosted hydrothermal systems. If alkaline, $\mathrm{CH}_{4^{-}}$ , and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ -rich fluids are emitted diffusely over a broad region, the sedimentary cap rocks represent an important biological nich e for communities living in diffuse fluid flow and expands the amoun t of biomass that may be supported by these systems. Drilling in th e sedimentary cap rocks also offers an important opportunity to constrain the depositional, diagenetic, and alteration history of thes e sediments. Determination of the mineralogies and fossil and lithi c assemblages, combined with O-isotope stratigraphy and radiocarbon age dating, can provide important information on the timing o f microbial community shifts in relation to the evolution of detachment faulting, exhumation, and the initiation and episodicity of hydrothermal activity.  

# Detachment faulting and the evolution of oceanic core complexes  

Our planned drilling aimed at obtaining good, continuous recovery of the talc-amphibole-chlorite schists, serpentinite mylonites, and variably altered peridotites and gabbros that comprise th e zone of detachment faulting across and along isochrons. Drillin g profiles into the damage zone would constrain thickness variation s of the detachment fault zone, help us better understand how strai n is localized at this tectonic boundary, and document discontinuitie s that may reflect removal by later faulting. By drilling east–west profiles along the southern wall and north–south profiles toward th e central dome and using Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Hol e U1309D as a tie point, we would be able to document spatial an d temporal heterogeneity in rock type and therefore magmatic an d tectonic accommodation to plate spreading and to assess the role o f rheological contrasts between competent gabbro and weaker serpentinized ultramafic rocks in localizing detachment faults. Drillin g would ultimately allow a better understanding of the evolution o f the massif as it was progressively uplifted to the seafloor and cooled. Although there are other OCCs where similar studies could be envisaged, Atlantis Massif is the only one currently known that als o hosts a low/moderate-temperature hydrothermal system, allowin g multiple objectives to be achieved within a single expedition. Thus, our study provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the extent an d activity of the subsurface biosphere within a well-defined geologica l and geochemical context that is representative of processes tha t form a large proportion of the seafloor in slow-spreading ridge environments.  

# Alignment with the IODP Science Plan  

Expedition 357 set out to drill a series of shallow $\left(\sim\!50\!-\!80\textrm{m}\right)$ holes across Atlantis Massif $30^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ ; MAR) in an effort to (1) recove r in situ sequences of sediments, hydrothermal deposits/veins, an d variably deformed metasomatic talc-amphibole-chlorite–rich rock s and serpentinized peridotites along a spreading-parallel (east–west ) profile at the top of the southern wall of Atlantis Massif and (2) obtain comparable in situ sequences along a ridge-parallel (north– south) profile on the Atlantis Massif central dome, where rock type s are known to change from dominantly ultramafic to dominantl y mafic.  

Major scientific questions that we planned to address by drillin g include the following:  

• What is the nature of microbial communities hosted by serpentinizing rocks, and to what depth is microbial activity sustained? How do these vary with aging of the lithosphere? How  

do they differ from or interact with communities in sediments and mafic substrates in the same age crust?   
• What are the consequences of serpentinization processes for global (bio)geochemical cycles?   
• What are the spatial scales of lithologic and hydrothermal variability in slow-spreading lithosphere and the implications for heat and fluid fluxes and microbial life?   
• How are carbon-bearing phases distributed locally and regionally? What are the rates of carbon fixation, as biomass or solid carbonate, in ultramafic rocks during low-temperature hydrothermal activity? What is the role of serpentinization in carbon sequestration?   
• How do oceanic detachment faults develop and facilitate hydrothermal circulation? How do they affect the development of alteration patterns and the evolution of the deep biosphere in these environments?  

Drilling Atlantis Massif provides an important opportunity t o evaluate the extent and activity of the subsurface biosphere within  a well-defined geological and geochemical context that is representative of processes that form a large proportion of the seafloor in slowspreading ridge environments. The planned drilling specifically addresses fundamental questions identified in the IODP Science Pla n (https://www.iodp.org/science-plan-for-2013-2023)  regardin g Biosphere Frontiers, Earth Connections, and Earth in Motion:  

• What are the origin, composition, and global significance of deep subseafloor communities?   
• What are the limits of life in the subseafloor?   
• How are seafloor spreading and mantle melting linked to ocean crustal architecture?   
• What are the mechanisms, magnitude, and history of chemical exchanges between the oceanic crust and seawater?   
• How do fluids link subseafloor tectonic, thermal, and biogeochemical processes?  

The processes controlling fluid flow and a deep biosphere are intimately linked, and over the past years many studies have concentrated on understanding sedimentary or volcanic systems with hightemperature discharge or on areas of diffuse flow in volcanic unit s (D’Hondt et al., 2002, 2004; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003; Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Nakagawa et al., 2006; Lipp et al., 2008; Parkes et al., 2005; Biddle et al., 2006; Hinrichs et al., 2006; Inagak i et al., 2006; Huber et al., 2002, 2003). In contrast, the spatial scale o f lithologic variability between mafic and ultramafic seafloor at slowspreading ridges, the implications for fluid flow paths and fluxes, and the subsurface ecosystems supported by these systems remai n almost completely unconstrained. A major aim of drilling Atlanti s Massif was to investigate the nature and distribution of microbial communities and their links with seawater infiltration and alteration processes in two distinct, lithologically heterogeneous domains of an OCC: (1) the serpentinizing basement at varyin g distances both from the ridge axis and from the active, low-temperature hydrothermal field, the LCHF, and (2) a mafic, plutoni c domain sampled from Hole U1309D that is less influenced by present-day hydrothermal activity and serpentinization. Our objective s open new opportunities for the study of abiogenic production of organic compounds and their implications for prebiotic synthesi s (Holm and Andersson, 1998; Shock and Schulte, 1998; Sleep et al., 2004) and will help constrain the subsurface scale and longevity o f hydrothermal circulation and hence rates of carbon fixation. Thi s study has implications both for past climate change (Kelemen an d Matter, 2008; Andreani et al., 2009; Boschi et al., 2009) and possibl e active sequestration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in ultramafic rocks.  

# Operational strategy Overview of offshore operational logistics  

To achieve the expedition scientific objectives, seabed rock dril l technology was chosen as the ideal method to recover high-qualit y shallow $^{\leftmoon}\left(50\mathrm{-}70\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ total length) cores from Atlantis Massif. To enable continuous operations, two seabed rock drills were chosen fo r this purpose: the Meeresboden-Bohrgerät (MeBo) 70 rock dril l from the Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (MARUM; University of Bremen, Germany) and the British Geological Surve y (BGS) RockDrill2 (RD2) (Figure F4). The RRS James Cook (Natura l Environment Research Council [NERC], UK) was provided as an inkind contribution as the drilling platform in support of the seabe d rock drill operations.  

This was the first time that seabed drill technology was used i n the ocean drilling programs. Both drills are remotely operated systems that are lowered onto the seabed, with power and contro l maintained from the surface via an umbilical. The systems use multiple rods and core barrels to progressively penetrate into the seabed. They are both loosely based on an HQ-size coring system, producing between 61 and $62\,\mathrm{mm}$ diameter cores, similar in size t o the standard IODP core diameter, while cutting a smaller diamete r hole. By sitting on the seabed, they do not require heave compensation and consequently have good control on bit weight, analogou s to land-based mining coring. Each system has the capacity to operate with either clear polycarbonate liners or stainless steel splits.  

In support of the expedition’s scientific objectives, several othe r tools were utilized in addition to the seabed drills:  

• A drill-mounted water sensor $^+$ sampling package   
• A drill-mounted tracer delivery system   
• Drill rig–deployed borehole plugs   
• Cableless logging tools   
• A conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) rosette system on the RRS James Cook  

Several of these tools were custom designed for this expedition. Details of these systems will be provided in more detail in the Expedition 357 methods chapter.  

Mobilization of the vessel began on 16 October 2015 in Southampton, UK. The offshore science party joined the vessel on $24\,\mathrm{Oc}-$ tober, and the RRS James Cook sailed on 26 October. The offshor e phase ran for 47 days from 26 October to 11 December when th e offshore science party disembarked the vessel and demobilizatio n began. All European Consortium for Ocean Research Drillin g (ECORD) Science Operator (ESO), BGS RD2, and MARUM MeB o staff cleared the vessel by 15 December.  

In total, 16.4 days of Expedition 357 were spent operational o n station, 19.5 days in transit, 4.7 days on standby because of weather, and 5.4 days on equipment-related downtime. See Table T1 for  a summary of offshore operations and recovery. Shipboard-generate d recovery plots are available on the ECORD Atlantis Massif Serpentinization and Life Expedition website under weekly summarie s (http://www.eso.ecord.org/expeditions/357/daily.php).  

# Offshore operations  

Based on seismic and bathymetric data acquired during previous research in the Atlantis Massif area, 11 drill sites were propose d for investigation, encompassing an east–west transect and a north– south transect. All holes were sited within an area approved by th e Environmental Protection and Safety Panel. The general location s of the sites cored are shown in Figure F2. Table T2 details the distances between the various holes and sites.  

Prior to coring operations, a multibeam survey was conducte d to accurately place the break of slope against two preexisting bathymetric data sets and the proponent-provided site locations. Th e RRS James Cook operates a Kongsberg Simrad EM120 deep-se a multibeam echo sounder. To improve resolution and analysis o f slope angles at each drill site, the beam angle on the EM120 was decreased to $45^{\circ}$ . A $50\;\mathrm{m}$ resolution surface was generated within Caris HIPS and SIPS to assess each location for slope prior to landin g each rock drill. This was later supplemented by further multibea m surveys over Atlantis Massif, the Atlantis Fracture Zone, the MAR, and some of the conjugate margin when coring operations were suspended because of weather. The same swath settings were used as i n the initial site survey.  

Operations at each site followed a similar pattern. Before commencing drilling operations, a cast of the ship’s CTD was run t o capture a water column profile, in particular the bottom water character, prior to coring and any associated disturbance. Three Niski n bottles were fired at the bottom of the cast, two in the midwater column, and one near the surface. During drilling operations, real-tim e data streams from the drill-mounted sensors were monitored t o track ephemeral events during penetration and operations. Whe n suitable conditions enabled them, deployments of the cableless logging tools and/or borehole plug systems were attempted after drilling concluded. After recovery of the rock drills, water and cor e samples were immediately removed from the drills and brought int o the laboratory for processing.  

As with all mission-specific platform expeditions, no cores wer e split during the offshore phase; therefore, a comprehensive onshor e phase complemented the offshore phase. Table T3 summarizes th e descriptions and measurements made during Expedition 357 an d indicates whether these were taken offshore or onshore. To preven t degradation of ephemeral samples during the offshore phase, selected whole-round cores were acquired for microbiology (see Microbiology), and core material and water samples were obtained fo r analyses of gases and geochemistry (see Bulk rock geochemistry) . Offshore analyses for contamination were conducted on drill flui d samples taken during operations (see Fluid chemistry and microbiology). All microbiology and geochemistry samples acquired offshore for postexpedition research were shipped either directly bac k to the requestor’s home laboratory or, for the pooled microbiolog y samples, directly to the Kochi Core Center (Japan) for later processing by members of the science party. All samples were shipped under controlled temperature conditions.  

# Onshore Science Party  

The cores and geochemistry splits collected offshore were transported under refrigeration to the IODP Bremen Core Repositor y (BCR) at MARUM. Further analytical laboratories were accessed a t MARUM (nondestructive core logging, marine geotechnics, and inorganic geochemistry) and the Department of Geosciences at th e University of Bremen (paleomagnetism and the carbon/sulfur analysis system).  

Prior to the Onshore Science Party (OSP), natural gamma radiation (NGR) measurements were conducted on all cores. In addition, continuous digital line scanning was conducted on each cor e through the liner, with four passes per core. After each pass, th e core was rotated $90^{\circ}$ , resulting in a composite whole-core image (se e Physical properties).  

During the OSP (20 January–4 February 2016), the cores wer e described in detail and the IODP minimum and some standar d measurements were made (Table T3). In addition, sampling fo r postexpedition scientific research was undertaken.  

# Summary of achievements  

Expedition 357 was the first IODP expedition to utilize seabe d rock drills to acquire subsurface core material. Although there wer e some technical challenges, as is to be expected when using subse a systems involving hydraulics, the method worked well, with recovery of coherent material from a wide range of lithologies and degrees of deformation. The total core recovered by the two seabe d drills was $57~\mathrm{m}$ after $109\;\mathrm{m}$ of total penetration, with an overall recovery of $53\%$ at nine different sites. Two holes north of the LCH F were drilled to nearly $16.5~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , with an average core recovery o f $71\%{-}75\%$ . Such high recovery in shallow mantle sequences is nearl y unprecedented in the history of ocean drilling. The cored section s were highly heterogeneous, ranging from moderately to highly altered and deformed serpentinized peridotites with varying compositions  and  occurrences  of  talc-amphibole-schist  zones  an d dolerites. Less abundant lithologies included lithified basalt breccias, rodingites, and metagabbros with cataclastic to (ultra)mylonitic deformation fabrics.  

In addition to recovering lower crustal and upper mantle sequences of the Atlantis Massif detachment fault zone, advancements in seabed drill rig technology funded by the ECORD wer e achieved during Expedition 357. For the first time, four borehol e plug systems were installed by the RD2 drill, two of which we consider to be well seated, whereas the condition of the other two borehole plugs are uncertain. These borehole plugs will enable futur e sampling of formation fluid from the boreholes to understand geochemical and microbiological processes in an actively serpentinizing system. New sensor packages designed for the expedition wer e highly successful and consistently delivered real-time chemical information while drilling, allowing in situ confirmation of ephemera l events such as gas release during penetration. Finally, a new pum p system was proven to deliver a geochemical tracer during drillin g for reliable contamination tracer testing.  

The European Petrophysics Consortium worked with both dril l teams and the ANTARES company (ANTARES Datensystem e GmbH, Stuhr, Germany) to develop a suite of battery-powered logging tools that could be deployed cable-free downhole and stored i n the tool rack of either drill system. Although we were unable to deploy these systems in the open hole during the expedition becaus e of unsuitable hole conditions, this was another key technologica l development that enhances the operational capability of seabe d rock drills for future expeditions.  

# Principal expedition results Multibeam bathymetry  

During Expedition 357, a multibeam bathymetry survey wa s conducted over Atlantis Massif, portions of the conjugate margi n across the MAR, and along the Atlantis Fracture Zone to the south. The new bathymetry, after processing, provides a grid with a resolution of $20{-}50\;\mathrm{m}$ per pixel (Figures F5, F6), which is two to five time s higher resolution than previously available bathymetry for this are a ( $100\;\mathrm{m}$ per pixel) (Blackman et al., 2002). The survey covers the entire striated detachment fault surface and surrounding terrain, including the ridge axis to the east, the Atlantis Fracture Zone to th e south, the tectonized terrain off-axis and west of the detachment, and its gradual narrowing transition to the adjacent seafloor to th e north (Figures F6, F7).  

The striated detachment surface shows variations in geometr y along-axis from south to north. Near the transform wall (south), th e detachment fault surface summits near the LCHF at ${<}800$ meter s below sea level (mbsl); from there it dips ${\sim}8^{\circ}$ east toward the ridg e axis, ${\sim}6^{\circ}$ west (Figure F7), and ${\sim}8^{\circ}{-}10^{\circ}$ north toward the central dome. The detachment deepens to the north to $>\!1500$ mbsl. Thi s deepening is associated with a change in shape; the detachmen t shows curvature along the spreading direction with slopes of up t o $15^{\circ}$ at its termination toward the ridge axis, becomes subhorizontal, and dips up to $10^{\circ}$ away from the axis. Across-axis profiles at different locations along Atlantis Massif in Figure F8 show the position o f the holes from Expedition 357 and the cored depth at Hole U1309 D drilled during Expedition 304/305.  

The hanging wall cutoff (termination) is well preserved towar d the northern, deeper part of Atlantis Massif, corresponding to  a sharp contact between the ridgeward-dipping striated fault plan e and the adjacent seafloor volcanic terrain. This volcanic terrain ha s an ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ to $\mathrm{<}10^{\circ}$ tilt westward, away from the ridge axis, and hosts volcanic cones and a bathymetric texture typical of volcanic terrai n along the rift valley floor (Figure F7). This portion of volcanic seafloor is bound further east by a fault scarp and corresponds to th e top of a back tilted tectonic block, as previously identified (Blackman et al., 2002; Cann et al., 1997).  

The termination is not preserved to the south, ridgeward of th e elevated portion of the detachment. Instead, the striated surface i s dissected by a major scarp, with a relief of up to $3000\;\mathrm{m}$ from the rif t valley floor and the top of the scarp (Figures F6, F7). This scar p shows a lobate structure indicating mass-wasting processes (slumping). Laterally, it links north with the fault scarp bounding the tectonically uplifted volcanic seafloor.  

The striated surface is also affected by extensive mass wastin g along its southern boundary toward the transform valley (Figure s F6, F7). The mass wasting produces scarps that are concave at thei r subvertical headwall. The transform wall south of Atlantis Massi f has an average slope of ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ and numerous channels bound by hig h ridges channeling debris that deposits at the base of the transfor m valley. Smaller scale mass wasting is also observed on steeper slope s of the detachment fault surface, defining the extension-parallel striations.  

Late small-slip faults (centimeters to tens of meters) cut the striated detachment surface. Faults are subparallel to oblique to th e ridge axis (Figure F7). Most have scarps facing away from the ridg e axis, with scarps up to ${\sim}10{-}20\;\mathrm{m}$ in vertical relief. The scarps hav e gentle slopes $(<\!20^{\circ})$ , likely due to the limited resolution of the multibeam bathymetry that cannot resolve these small-size scarps.  

# Lithology, alteration, and structure Mantle to lithospheric processes  

Cores from six sites across the southern wall of Atlantis Massi f recovered a variety of ultramafic, mafic, and sedimentary rocks tha t exhibit a range of alteration styles and extent of alteration and deformation. Of the core recovered, serpentinized harzburgites an d serpentinized dunites are predominant $44\%$ by length); other majo r rock types include metadolerites and basaltic rocks (together $24\%$ )  

and schistose metasomatic rocks containing talc, amphibole, and/o r chlorite $(11\%)$ . Minor calcareous sedimentary units $(8\%)$ and gabbroic rocks $(4\%)$ were also recovered (Figure F9).  

Serpentinized harzburgites and subordinate serpentinized dunites are typically undeformed and commonly exhibit protogranula r textures but are extensively serpentinized. Serpentinized dunite s are found exclusively as limited intervals alternating with harzburgite and likely represent relict mantle melt channels. Mantle meltrock reaction textures including vermicular spinels, and orthopyroxene veins were also observed. Minor intervals of ultramafi c rocks infiltrated by gabbroic melts are also present. A small volum e of gabbroic plutonic rocks was recovered, but no long coherent sections of gabbroic core were observed. Dolerites intrude amphibolerich fault rocks, locally with fractured chilled margins adjacent t o these contacts. Poorly vesicular aphanitic to microcrystalline basalts are also present, typically within sedimentary breccias an d commonly with glassy margins. Calcareous sands rich in foraminifers and with rare rounded lithic fragments of basalt are common i n shallow cores.  

The southern wall is characterized by distinctly heterogeneous, both laterally and vertically, distribution of ultramafic and mafi c rocks and a strong degree of alteration (Figure F10). The rock type s and proportion of gabbroic rocks recovered during Expedition 35 7 are distinctly different from the $1400\;\mathrm{m}$ long core of gabbroic rock s recovered during Expedition 304/305 at the central dome of the Atlantis Massif.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithostratigraphy is described in an east–west transec t across the southern wall of Atlantis Massif, followed by the site s north of the southern wall, as illustrated in Figure F10.  

# Eastern sites  

Site M0075. The upper sections of both holes at Site M0075 recovered surficial deposits of angular sedimentary basaltic breccia s underlying carbonate sand, with Hole M0075B recovering underlying rubble and drilled fragments of metadolerite in addition to talcamphibole-chlorite-rich intervals.  

Site M0068. Site M0068 is structurally more complex tha n what was observed at other sites, and a variety of lithologies wer e recovered, including intervals of intact rock commonly bounded b y deformed talc-amphibole schists and breccias. Intervals of serpentinized harzburgite are locally found with small gabbroic veins, and one interval appears to have been extensively impregnated b y gabbroic melt. Some fresh olivine was also observed in the serpentinized harzburgite from this site. Metagabbro and gabbronorit e are present in small intervals. Metagabbro and talc-tremolite schist s were both observed to contain rare zircon in thin section. Most o f the lower cores are composed of loose rubble of mixed composition. Structurally, this site is interpreted as a mass-wasting deposit wit h large boulders in places separated by intervals of finer rubble.  

# Central sites  

Site M0069. Hole M0069A consisted of 10 cores that recovere d serpentinized harzburgites, lesser serpentinized dunites, metagabbros, and metadolerites. The upper four cores of the hole contai n carbonate sand, transitioning into a loose rubble unit dominated b y angular fragments of serpentinized harzburgite (Section 5R-1, Uni t 1; fragments to $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ ). Coherent sections of serpentinized harzburgites $5\%$ bastite after orthopyroxene) with observable mesh texture s were observed below (Section 5R-1, Unit 2). A large portion of th e remaining cores is dominated by metadolerite (Sections 5R-1, Uni t 3, through 9R-1, Unit 2) and rubble sections. Metadolerite is generally aphyric and microcrystalline to fine grained (typically 0.2–0. 5 mm); some sections exhibit larger clinopyroxene (up to $1~\mathrm{mm}$ ) an d disseminated sulfides $\mathsf{<}1\;\mathsf{m m})$ . The lower sections of the hole (9R1, Unit 3, through 10R-3) contain alternating serpentinized harzburgites and serpentinized dunites; harzburgites exhibit relict orthopyroxene (bastites; up to $10\,\textrm{m m}$ and typically with a modal abundance of $10\%{-}15\%)$ , and dunites typically contain chromianspinel.  

Site M0072. In contrast to many other sites, Site M0072 contains abundant mafic and metasomatic domains within the serpentinized peridotites. The upper sections of both holes consist o f surficial features including carbonate sands (with centimeter-scal e subrounded basaltic lithic fragments), sedimentary basaltic breccias, and basaltic rubble (with rare oxide gabbro fragments observed in Hole M0072B). Deeper intervals of the basement wer e drilled in Hole M0072B; below surficial units, rubble sections o f mixed composition (metabasalt, metagabbro, and serpentinize d harzburgite; Sections 3R-1 through 5R-1, Unit 1) overlie a principally continuous interval of alternating talc-amphibole schists, rodingites, and serpentinized harzburgites (Sections 5R-1, Unit 3, t o bottom of hole in 8R-2).  

Site M0076. The predominant igneous lithology of Site M007 6 is serpentinized porphyroclastic harzburgite with lesser mafic lithologies. The upper sections of both holes are sedimentary basalti c breccias, which are stratigraphically  better preserved  in  Hol e M0076A (including the overlying fossiliferous carbonate sediment; Section 357-M0076B-1R-1 contains mostly rubble). Below this uppermost interval is a principally coherent sequence dominated b y oxidized serpentinized harzburgites. The upper contact of this zon e consists of talc-amphibole schists that enclose small sections o f metagabbro and oxidized serpentinized harzburgite. This transitio n into coherent intervals of metagabbro and oxidized serpentinize d harzburgite (bastite after orthopyroxene to $10\ \mathrm{mm}$ , typically at  a modal abundance of $10\%{-}15\%$ ; Section 357-M0076A-2R-1, Unit 3). Below sections of mixed rubble (including fragments of serpentinized harzburgite, serpentinized dunite, metagabbro, and talcamphibole schists) with intervals of coherent serpentinites (Sections 3R-1 and 4R-1, Unit 1) are continuous sections of veined an d altered alternating serpentinized harzburgites and serpentinize d dunites (Section 4R-1, Unit 2 and below).  

# Western and northern sites  

Site M0071. Site  M0071  cores  consist  principally  of  serpentinized harzburgites and serpentinized dunites, with intervals o f metagabbro and evidence for metagabbroic infiltration into ultramafic rocks. Rubble sections are common throughout, and th e ultramafic lithologies stratigraphically overlie a drilled interval o f metadolerite. Overall, the site appears to have been drilled throug h a large ultramafic-dominated boulder on top of the surface of Atlantis Massif.  

Site M0070. The recovered lithologies are dominated by aphanitic to microcrystalline basalts that are typically poorly to sparsel y vesicular and variably altered. Basaltic and doleritic fragments wer e exclusively observed within a variably cemented carbonate-matri x breccia. The material cored from this site is interpreted to be surficial sedimentary material (although this is likely to be locally derived); no coherent sequences of intact igneous rock were drilled. Occasional plagioclase-phyric basalt fragments and minor metadolerite were observed.  

Site M0074. A single short core of fossiliferous carbonate san d was recovered.  

# Hydrothermal alteration of mantle-dominated lithosphere at Atlantis Massif Alteration types  

Within the recovered cores, five types of alteration were distinguished: serpentinization, talc-amphibole-chlorite metasomatism, rodingitization, oxidation, and one type classified as “other.” Thi s “other” classification refers to hydration of gabbros, dolerites, an d basaltic lithologies. Serpentinization is present throughout the site s and predominantly manifests as pervasive alteration with extensiv e to complete replacement of the primary mineralogy. Serpentinization is characterized by mesh textures after olivine, bastites after orthopyroxene,  and  serpentine  veins.  Talc-amphibole-chlorit e metasomatism is evidenced by pale greenish white alteration wit h assemblages of variable proportions of talc, amphibole, and chlorite. It develops both as pervasive and localized alteration and enclose s serpentinized harzburgite intervals on centimeter to decimete r scales. Talc-amphibole-chlorite metasomatism is found at the contacts with gabbros. Rodingitization is primarily restricted to Sit e M0072, where approximately five centimeter-sized intervals wit h pale brown to pinkish color occur adjacent to dark green regions o f chlorite black walls and are repeatedly present over a few meters. Oxidation is characterized by reddish to brown serpentinized harzburgites and dunites. It occurs as both pervasive and localized alteration and is  also associated with calcium carbonate veining. Hydration of dolerites and basalts manifests as pervasive background alteration with slight to moderate intensity accompanied b y alteration halos that flank veins. Secondary minerals vary depending on the temperature of alteration, with dolerites dominated b y greenschist facies minerals (chlorite and amphibole) and basalts b y low-temperature oxidation to iron oxyhydroxides and clays. Hydration of gabbros is generally associated with chlorite-amphibole assemblages.  

# Alteration history  

Serpentinization, talc-amphibole-chlorite metasomatism, an d oxidation alteration types are always present at sites that recovere d ultramafic lithologies. Of these three types, serpentinization is th e most dominant and pervasive. Overprinting relationships are frequently observed and demonstrate an overall progression from serpentinization to talc-amphibole-chlorite metasomatism and late r oxidation.  Rodingites  show  exceptional  relationships  betwee n rodingite, talc $\pm$ amphibole-rich zones, and serpentinized harzburgites and form at the contacts between gabbroic veins/lenses and serpentinized harzburgites.  

Hydrothermal veins are present within all lithologies, and compositions include serpentine, talc, chlorite, amphibole, epidote, quartz, and calcium carbonate. The veins are often complex, wit h multiple infillings and internal textures. Crosscutting relationship s are complicated, with the same veins observed both crosscuttin g and being crosscut by a second vein. These observations indicat e that the hydrothermal system does not show a simple evolution o f the fluids. Calcium carbonate veins are not abundant across th e massif and are surprisingly low in the sites around the LCHF.  

Based on these observations, it is clear that hydrothermal alteration at Atlantis Massif is a highly dynamic system with complex relationships between the three dominant alteration types. Th e heterogeneity of the alteration and the hydrothermal veins provid e insight into the scales of the hydrothermal processes operatin g within the detachment fault zone.  

# Structures and deformation history  

The drilled sites are located along a roughly spreading-paralle l transect (west–east) in various positions (trough or wall/flank) relative to individual corrugations of the detachment fault over th e southern wall of Atlantis Massif. Despite the fact that a number o f the holes recovered rocks considered not to be in situ, generalizations can be made about the structural history recorded.  

Rare magmatic fabrics characterized by diffuse but planar centimeter-scale banding/layering of igneous minerals in gabbroic rock s were recovered in Hole M0068. Where characterized, the majorit y of the recovered harzburgite preserves protogranular textures; onl y rare, low intensity, localized protoclastic serpentinized peridotite s were recovered.  

As in Hole U1309D, a minimal amount of recovered core ha s strongly deformed microstructures formed at high temperatures. The majority of the recovered cores show only greenschist-grad e semibrittle and brittle deformation, commonly associated with doleritic intrusions. Fault rocks in shear zones are dominated by anastomosing intervals of variable intensity, with schistose amphibole $\pm$ talc $\pm$ chlorite zones up to tens of centimeters thick. Locally, schistose shear zones contain undeformed dolerite intrusions with preserved chilled margins; elsewhere, dolerite sheets record brittle an d semibrittle deformation textures indicating repeated magmatis m and faulting. Thin intervals of the schistose shear zones locally display intense cataclasis of other rock types reworked in the faul t zone, with rare fine-grained intervals of cataclasis (possible faul t gouge) recovered.  

# Bulk rock geochemistry  

Rock samples were collected during the offshore and onshor e phases for whole-rock geochemical measurements. Because of th e decision to delay processing of these samples until work could b e undertaken in a shore-based laboratory with appropriate equipment for ultramafic materials, these data were not available by th e end of the onshore phase. Results will be reported in the Proceedings volume.  

# Fluid chemistry and microbiology  

# Inorganic, organic, and volatile fluid chemistry  

An extensive water sampling program was conducted as part o f the expedition to assess geochemical processes in the subsurfac e and connectivity to bottom water in the form of hydrothermal plumes. Sensor package Niskins were used to collect fluids flushe d from the borehole (Table T4), and interstitial fluids in sediment s were collected where available. An extensive CTD program collected near-bottom water ${\mathit{\omega}}_{<3{\textrm{m}}}$ above seafloor) from each drill sit e prior to drilling to identify the undisturbed predrilling characteristics of the area (Table T5). Two casts collected background seawate r for comparison in the Atlantis Fracture Zone and the MAR (described as Holes M0075X and M0075Z, respectively, in Table T5).  A final cast collected samples from the middle of the hydrothermal plume above the western end of the LCHF by using the methan e sensor to identify the appropriate water column depth (described a s Hole M0072X in Table T5).  

A total of 41 fluid samples were analyzed for shipboard salinit y and ammonium, and 38 samples were analyzed for dissolved inorganic chemistry. These samples originated from the sensor packag e  

Niskin bottles collected after drilling $\left(N=14\right)$ ), the CTD rosette Niskin bottles collected from bottom water prior to drilling $\left(N=17\right)$ , and interstitial fluids from a few sediment cores collected durin g drilling $\left(N=9\right)$ . With few exceptions, the chemical composition o f these fluids is identical to seawater composition in terms of salinity, major cations and anions, trace elements (when above limits of detection), alkalinity, and ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , with the noted exception of a slight correlated deviation in sediment alkalinity, dissolved calcium, and th e stable carbon isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon i n interstitial fluids from Hole M0069A sediments. There was no detectable sulfide or ammonia in any sample. A total of 56 and 70 water samples for hydrogen and methane analyses were collected fro m the shipboard CTD/rosette system and the drill rig sensor packages, respectively. Both methane and hydrogen range from below detection limit to nanomolar quantities. Typically, samples collected i n the sensor package Niskins have significantly higher hydrogen concentrations than the bottom water collected prior to drilling. Ho t spots of hydrogen were observed over Sites M0068–M0072; methane concentrations were highest over Site M0072 and were elevate d at Sites M0069–M0071.  

# Microbiology  

To accomplish the microbiology-related objectives of the expedition, an extensive program was carried out offshore to collec t whole-round core samples immediately after core retrieval, curation, and scanning with the multisensor core logger to enable preservation of ephemeral microbiological properties. This include d (1) frozen preservation of core material for DNA- and lipid-base d analyses in shore-based laboratories, (2) establishment of enrichment incubations on the ship to assess the potential for various microbial metabolisms, (3) collection of samples to evaluate th e performance of the tracer delivery, (4) preservation of samples fo r biomass determination via cell counting, and (5) collection of parallel samples for spatial and isotopic geochemical determination, particularly focused on carbon and minerals. In addition to wholeround core samples, the liner fluids bathing the cores and core barrels were also collected to assess for potential contamination of th e samples. Bottom water samples prior to and before drilling wer e also collected for this purpose, as well as to examine the flux of subsurface components to the water column.  

The execution of the sampling plan for microbiology and othe r ephemeral properties was highly successful, even given the technological constraints of adapting this methodology to the particular s of seabed drilling. Because of the nature of seabed drilling, individual cores wait on the seabed until all cores from a hole are recovere d at once. During Expedition 357, cores remained on the seabed fro m $1.5{-}54\,\mathrm{h}$ prior to recovery on deck, with time on the seabed dependent on drilling speed, total depth of penetration, and position o f the core within the hole. The offshore core flow plan was optimize d for collecting whole-round cores for ephemeral properties as soo n as possible, resulting in total handling times once cores were recovered on deck from $8\;\mathrm{min}$ (for the deepest core sections) to $7\,\mathrm{{h}}$ (fo r the shallower sections). In total, 42 whole-round core samples wer e taken from the 17 holes drilled during the expedition, totalin g nearly $8\;\mathrm{m}$ in combined length and representing roughly $14\%$ of th e entire core recovered. From these samples, 29 different enrichmen t experiments were established on the ship, with initial indications o f some positive activity in some of the treatments based on elevate d cell counts.  

Subsamples from these whole-round cores were immediatel y frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and then shipped to the Kochi Core Center, Japan. Exteriors of whole-round cores were then cut under sterile conditions with a band saw system equipped in a clean booth and subsampled  for  perfluoromethylcyclohexane  (PFC)  tracer  check s (exterior), concentration and isotopic composition of total inorganic and total organic carbon, vein analysis, in situ organic carbo n and Fe mineral analysis, and trapped-gas analysis. The interior portions of frozen samples were subsampled and distributed for shorebased DNA and RNA analyses, interior PFC tracers, and amino aci d and lipid analyses.  

To create initial assessments of microbial biomass in the cor e samples, cell abundance was determined offshore by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope following cell separatio n from the sample matrix. Cell abundance was variable and relativel y low, ranging from $10^{2}–10^{4}$ cells per cubic centimeter in rock samples and higher abundances in sediment samples. To enable suc h low levels of cell detection, great care was taken on the ship to minimize dust contamination of samples during processing, resulting i n minimum quantification limit of 48 cells $\mathsf{\Gamma}_{\mathrm{Cm}^{3}}$ .  

A major technical development for this expedition was establishing a delivery system for adding a synthetic tracer (PFC) into th e drilling fluids to monitor for the possibility of drilling-induced contamination. Samples of core barrel liner fluids, sensor package Niskin bottles, and exterior and interior pieces of whole-round cor e were collected to quantify the concentration of PFC tracer adde d during drilling operations and track its potential distribution int o samples. After overcoming some technical difficulties with the metering pump in the delivery system, we established that PFC was delivered at saturating $\left(>1\:\mathrm{\mg/L}\right)$ concentrations into the drillin g fluids. Moreover, appropriate handling conditions combined wit h coherent core samples resulted in the absence of tracer from the interior of core samples (whereas less coherent materials suffered potential contamination from intrusion of tracer). Tracer delivery wa s most successful while coring Holes M0068B, M0070A–M0070C, M0071C, M0075A, and M0075B.  

# Sensor package  

There were 17 full deployments of the custom sensor packag e on the rock drills during Expedition 357. As described in Offshor e operations, each deployment included sensors for dissolved methane, dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, conductivity, temperature, and pressure; deployments shallower than $1200\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth also contained a pH sensor. Data from these sensors wer e observable in real time during drilling operations. Significant excursions in methane during operations were observed in Hole s M0070A, M0071A, M0072B, and M0076B, with visual observatio n of bubbles emanating from the boreholes during drilling at Hole s M0070A and M0071A.  

# Borehole plugs  

Two borehole plug systems were successfully installed by th e RD2 drill (Holes M0072B and M0075B), with two other attempt s made (Holes M0068B and M0071B) with unknown success. Thes e borehole plug systems will enable future sampling of formation flui d from the boreholes to understand geochemical and microbiological processes in an actively serpentinizing system. In addition, equipment was left behind in three holes (Holes M0069A, M0071C, an d  

M0076B) after difficult drilling conditions; it may be possible to utilize this lost equipment for scientific purposes in the future.  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties data were acquired from all cores recovere d during Expedition 357. This includes measurements on wholeround cores (magnetic susceptibility, gamma density, electrical resistivity, NGR, and digital line scans through liners), split core s (high-resolution digital line scans and color reflectance spectrophotometry), and 21 subsamples $P$ -wave velocity and moisture an d density) taken from a range of lithologies across the study sites.  

A negative correlation between magnetic susceptibility an d electrical resistivity is relatively standard across most of the roc k cores, whereas those parameters are positively correlated in sediment units. This may be attributed to fluid controlling resistivity i n the sediment cores where the magnetic susceptibility and resistivit y are both low. In hard rock cores, low porosity combined with th e high proportion of magnetically susceptible components results i n resistivity being controlled by the solid phases rather than any flui d present.  

Density measurements on whole cores are primarily influence d by the quality of the core, and intervals of rubble are echoed in th e scatter of the data profiles. Using gamma density in tandem wit h magnetic susceptibility can aid identification of certain lithologi c boundaries, indicated by stepwise changes in the two parameters. For example, an interval of talc-amphibole-chlorite schist in Hol e M0068B in the eastern area is characterized by lower densities an d magnetic susceptibilities than the overlying (gabbroic) and underlying (ultramafic) units. Similarly, at the boundary between serpentinite and metagabbro at the base of Hole M0071A, a shar p decrease in magnetic susceptibility and increase in gamma densit y was observed.  

Magnetic susceptibility does change overall from area to area, with western area cores having the highest magnetic susceptibilit y $(\mathrm{mean}\,=\,3591\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\,\mathrm{SI}$ ) across the Atlantis Massif study site an d northern area cores (dominated by sediment) having the lowes t $(\mathrm{mean}=157\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI})$ . The central and eastern areas are more comparable, with mean magnetic susceptibilities of $1187\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ an d $1280\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\mathrm{~S~}$ I, respectively. A lower abundance of talc from th e western area holes may be indicative of higher magnetite content i n the recovered cores, compared to more talc-rich lithologies to th e east (see Lithology, alteration, and structure). This hypothesis i s supported by X-ray diffraction measurements of bulk rock samples, which show significantly higher amounts of magnetite in the wes t than in the other areas.  

NGR intensities are consistently low across all sites, which i s reasonable given the lithologies cored. The corresponding in sit u data sets from three of the holes (M0068B, M0071C, and M0076B; see Downhole logging) may facilitate depth matching cores an d logs to position the cores closer to their original in situ depth belo w seafloor.  

In terms of recorded color reflectance parameters, the mea n lightness $\left(\mathbb{L}^{*}\right)$ of cores is relatively constant across all four study areas (from $39.49\%$ [central] to $44.98\%$ [northern]). Color opponen t dimension parameters are more variable. Mean $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is negative at al l but the northern sites, where the orange-colored sediment recovered from Site M0074 skews the data to positive (red). Mean $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ i s consistently positive (yellow) across the study areas. It is most positive in the northern (7.06) and central (3.03) areas because of th e influence of the data from the sediment units at Site M0074 (northern) and Site M0069 (central).  

Moisture and density analyses on samples reveal that the serpentinites form a discrete population with lower grain densities an d slightly higher porosities compared to the schists, metadolerites, metagabbros, and gabbros (Figure F11). Calcareous sediment samples have similar grain densities to serpentinites but considerabl y higher porosities. It is difficult to comment on systematic change s in these parameters across Atlantis Massif because of the limite d size of the data set.  

Triaxial $P_{\|}$ -wave measurements were undertaken on all but th e sediment minicore samples (Figure F12). Serpentinites yielded th e widest range of $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities of the lithologies sampled, rangin g from 4.46 to $7.62\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ (values represent mean values of the triaxial measurements for each sample), with an overall mean of $5.94\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ . The mafic rocks (metadolerites, metagabbros, and gabbros) have  a narrower range of mean values, varying from 4.89 to $6.05\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ wit h an overall mean of $5.48\;\mathrm{km/s}$ . Schists have similar velocities to mafi c rocks, with mean values from 4.41 to $6.68\:\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ and an overall mea n of $5.26~\mathrm{km/s}$ . No systematic changes in these velocities across th e study areas were discerned based on this limited data set (18 samples). However, when relating the mean $(x-,y-,z$ -direction) $P$ -wav e velocities to the corresponding porosity data, it is clear that the velocities are porosity controlled (Figure F12).  

# Downhole logging  

During Expedition 357, ${\sim}35\;\mathrm{m}$ of through-pipe total gamma ra y logging measurements were acquired across three holes (M0068 B [eastern], M0076B [central], and M0071C [western]). Other petrophysical measurements (notably resistivity and magnetic susceptibility) in the open hole were not possible for a variety of reasons, including boreholes too shallow for logging, boreholes obstructe d by stuck core barrels and bottom-hole assemblies, and technical issues with the seabed drills that prevented tool deployment (see Offshore operations).  

The total gamma ray data acquired indicate extremely low intensities of NGR from the lithologies encountered during this expedition  across  the  three  areas.  Some  similarities  with  th e complementary data sets taken on whole-round cores may facilitat e depth-matching core data to the downhole logs. This correlatio n could provide a better estimate of the original in situ depth of th e core material, especially in lower recovery holes.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Magnetic susceptibility (kappa; κ) and natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of 15 discrete cylinder samples (volume $=11~{\mathsf{c m}}^{3}.$ ) from the eastern, central, and western sites were measured durin g the OSP. Samples were taken from working halves and relatively oriented with respect to the top of the sampled cores. κ ranges fro m 0.00031 to 0.0778 SI units (Table T6; Figure F13). The highest magnetic susceptibilities were displayed by a serpentinized dunite wit h melt intrusion, and the lowest κ values were restricted to specimen s of talc-amphibole-chlorite schist. Higher κ values were frequentl y associated with more mafic rocks with greater amounts of iron oxide minerals such as magnetite. A viscous NRM component in th e vast majority of discrete paleomagnetic pilot samples was effectivel y randomized by the application of an alternating field of $5{-}20\;\mathrm{mT}$ t o determine inclinations and declinations of all the discrete sample s (Table T6; Figure F14). Cores were not oriented with respect to a n azimuth, and the relatively few sample points per core section limi t the usefulness of the declination data. A distinct cluster of dat a points from the central sites varies a few degrees from the predictions of a geocentric axial dipole (GAD) model. Notably, all of th e samples from the eastern sites have shallow inclinations; these wer e all serpentinites. Additionally, several samples had positive inclinations; these were restricted to a metagabbro recovered from Hol e M0071A.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

The overarching objectives of Expedition 357 focused on  

• Exploring the extent and activity of the subsurface biosphere in young ultramafic and mafic seafloor;   
• Quantifying the role of serpentinization in driving hydrothermal systems, sustaining microbiological communities, and sequestration of carbon in ultramafic rocks;   
• Assessing how abiotic and biotic processes change with aging of the lithosphere and variations in rock type; and   
• Characterizing tectonomagmatic processes that lead to lithospheric heterogeneities and the evolution of hydrothermal activity associated with detachment faulting.  

To achieve these objectives, we set out to drill an east–west, spreading-parallel transect across the southern wall of Atlanti s Massif and a south–north, ridge-parallel transect into the center o f the massif (Figure F2). The east–west profile would allow evaluation of how microbial communities evolve with variations in hydrothermal activity and age of emplacement on the seafloor and of th e extent and evolution of carbonate precipitation in serpentinizin g peridotites. The south–north profile would allow evaluation of th e deep biosphere in varying lithologies and provide information o n the role of differing rheologies of gabbros and serpentinized ultramafic rocks in localizing detachment faults.  

To accomplish these operations, we developed a coring an d sampling strategy based around the use of seabed rock drills—th e first time that such systems have been used in the ocean drillin g programs. This technology was chosen in the hopes of achievin g high recovery of the carbonate cap sequences and intact contac t and deformation sequences to 50 mbsf, which is generally difficul t to achieve in hard rock with conventional ocean drilling technologies. The expedition plan also included several engineering developments to assess geochemical parameters during drilling; sampl e bottom water before and after coring; supply synthetic tracer s during drilling for contamination assessment; gather downhole log s of electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility for assessin g fractures, fluid flows, and extent of serpentinization; and seal boreholes to provide opportunities for future experiments, all of whic h were supported and funded by IODP through ECORD. Althoug h not an objective of the expedition, we were serendipitously able t o generate a high-resolution $\,\!^{20}\,\mathrm{m}$ per pixel) multibeam bathymetr y map across the entire Atlantis Massif and nearby fracture zone, MAR, and eastern conjugate (Figure F6), taking advantage o f weather and operational downtime. This map will assist scienc e party members in evaluating and interpreting tectonic and masswasting processes operating on Atlantis Massif.  

Expedition 357 successfully drilled 13 holes along the east–wes t transect of the southern wall of Atlantis Massif, including 4 holes o n the eastern section, 6 in the carbonate cap and basement immediately north of the LCHF, and 3 on the western edge (Figures F2, F10). We also collected core from 4 holes north of the souther n wall. In total, we collected $57\;\mathrm{m}$ of core with $55\%$ overall core recovery (ranging from $0\%$ at one site to $71\%$ at another site and wit h $100\%$ recovery in some sections). Many lithologic contacts an d structural features are preserved in the cores (Figure F10), even i n fractured units and shear intervals, which validates our choice of using seabed rock drills. Although penetration below 17 mbsf prove d impossible to achieve during the expedition because of the challenges of drilling in highly fractured and altered hard rock, we wer e successful in recovering the target rock type of moderately to highl y altered and deformed serpentinized peridotites, gabbros, and mafi c extrusive and dike rocks.  

Core descriptions, structural measurements, and evaluation o f the multibeam data during the onshore phase of the expedition provided an overview of the lithologic variations along the souther n wall of Atlantis Massif. The lithologies along the east–west profil e are dominated by highly serpentinized harzburgite with lesser dunite, with gabbroic veins and lenses, and show variable degrees o f talc-amphibole-chlorite metasomatism and local rodingitization. Cores from the central sites (M0069, M0072, and M0076) recovere d in situ continuous sections that preserve intrusive contacts an d sheared intervals. These cores provide a record of early magmatis m in the shallow mantle, multiphased and continuous serpentinization and metasomatism, injections of dolerite melts, and recent basaltic volcanism.  

Cores from the eastern and western sites recovered variabl y sized blocks of rubble and sedimentary units. The rubble block s consist of serpentinized harzburgite and dunite, metagabbros, dolerites, metadolerites, and sedimentary units dominated by basalti c breccias. The lithologies, deformation, and alteration characteristics in the rubble blocks are consistent with observations in the i n situ sequences at the central sites; however, they provide no information as to the orientation of structures or veins. Surprisingly, th e cores we recovered had only minor amounts of carbonate veins an d no evidence for extensive carbonation.  

Despite not reaching the target depths, 42 whole-round cor e samples for detailed microbiological and geochemical analyses wer e collected. Shipboard determination of contamination tracer delivery enabled confirmation of appropriate sample handling procedures  for  these  samples,  which  will  aid  all  subsequen t microbiological investigations that are part of the science part y sampling plans, as well as verification of this new tracer deliver y technology for seabed drill rigs. Shipboard investigation of biomas s density in select samples revealed relatively low and variable cell densities in the samples, and enrichment experiments set up shipboard will continue to be monitored for growth and activity. Thus, we anticipate achieving many of the deep biosphere–related objectives of the expedition through continued scientific investigatio n over the coming years. In combination with the anticipated microbiological results, shore-based petrological, structural, and geochemical studies will allow us to achieve a number of our goals se t out for the east–west transect.  

Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in completing the south– north operations planned for the expedition, which will limit ou r ability to satisfy objectives related to understanding detachmen t faults. Also, no open-hole logging operations could be conducte d during the expedition due to challenging hole conditions and equipment failure. However, we were able to demonstrate the functionality of the new magnetic susceptibility logging tool, which could hav e future applications for oceanographic and industry research, an d the Optical Acoustic Gamma tool was run through pipe in thre e holes, providing a complementary data set for the NGR measurements conducted prior to the OSP.  

We were also successful in the application of other new technologies used in support of the expedition: (1) extensive use of a custom-designed in situ sensor package and water sampling system o n the seabed drills for evaluating real-time dissolved methane, oxygen, ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , oxidation-reduction potential, temperature, and conductivity during drilling; (2) deploying a borehole plug system fo r sealing seabed drill boreholes to allow access for future sampling; and (3) proving that contamination tracers can be delivered int o drilling fluids on seabed drills. The sensor packages delivered valuable real-time data that provided important evidence that the ultramafic, and possibly volcanic, sequences are producing significan t concentrations of hydrogen and methane during active serpentinization.  

# Offshore operations Transit to Atlantis Massif  

At $0950~\mathrm{h}$ Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) on 26 Octobe r 2015, the Pilot joined the RRS James Cook. The vessel left the quayside at Southampton at $1021\ \mathrm{h},$ and the Pilot departed at $1141~\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel continued on transit toward the Atlantis Massif sites, arriving at the first site at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ local time $\mathrm{(UTC-2\,h)}$ on Thursday, 5 November. All times hereafter will be in local time unless otherwise stated.  

# Multibeam surveys and waiting on weather  

Pre-existing bathymetric data sets included a more regional 10 0 m resolution grid and a detailed $2\,\mathrm{m}$ resolution grid of the Lost City. However, there was an apparent offset between the two, potentiall y due to using different geographic projections. Therefore, prior t o commencing coring operations, it was necessary to run a multibeam survey over the proposed coring sites to evaluate the slope angles for both drills and accurately locate the break in slope at th e southern edge of the Atlantis Massif complex.  

On  5  November  2015,  in  proximity  to  Site  M0068  a t $30^{\circ}7.49717^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $42^{\circ}5.74742^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ a sound velocity profile was conducted. The sonde was deployed at $1627\,\mathrm{h}$ and recovered to deck a t $1741\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . As data were downloaded, the vessel moved to the start o f the first multibeam survey line. In total, five north–south surve y lines were run, starting at $1814\,\mathrm{h}$ and ending at $2208~\mathrm{h}$ . This initia l survey covered Sites M0068 (proposed Site AM-02A), M0069 (proposed Site AM-06A), M0071 (proposed Site AM-04A), M0072 (proposed Site AM-01A), and M0076 (proposed Site AM-11A). On  8 November, two multibeam lines were run in a northeast–southwes t direction to survey the locations for Site M0070 (proposed Site AM07A), and Site M0074 (proposed Site AM-09A). The survey commenced at $1027\,\mathrm{h}$ and was completed by $1145\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

On 12 November at $0830\,\mathrm{h}$ the Master of the Vessel decided t o cease drilling operations because of concerns regarding the weathe r (after effects of Hurricane Kate). However, multibeam and CTD operations were still possible, and we decided to prepare for possibl e coring at Sites M0073 (proposed Site AM-05A) and M0075 (proposed Site AM-03A) by running these activities in advance of an y coring at these locations. The vessel departed Site M0072 at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ following recovery of the RD2 to deck and transited to the start o f the first multibeam line. The vessel initially ran three lines: east– west to cover proposed Site AM-05A, west–east covering Sit e M0075, and then continued east to cover an additional CTD cas t taken over the MAR. This initial multibeam survey commenced a t $0928~\mathrm{h}$ and was completed by $1220~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 November. Followin g completion of the CTD cast at the MAR (see below) and Sit e M0073, another multibeam survey was started at $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ on $12\,\mathrm{No}-$ vember and ran until ${\sim}0800\mathrm{~h~}$ on 13 November, when a CTD wa s conducted at Site M0074. This portion of the survey covered th e western side of the Atlantis Massif complex.  

Following the CTD cast at Site M0074 on 13 November, the vessel continued to be officially “waiting on weather” as far as drillin g operations were concerned, so we continued running north–sout h multibeam lines across the Atlantis Massif complex. This started a t $1150\,\mathrm{h}$ and continued until $2240\,\mathrm{h}$ when the weather became so ba d that the survey had to be terminated so that the vessel could tur n into the predominant weather direction and maintain a stead y course, with winds from the southwest and $5\,\textrm{m}$ swell from th e northwest. The vessel maintained this course until the early hour s of 14 November when operations began at Site M0075.  

The vessel departed Site M0076 at $1900\ \mathrm{h}$ on 17 November . With both drills still undergoing repairs, we decided to continue th e multibeam survey, concentrating on running east over the MA R and the conjugate margin to the Atlantis Massif complex. A total o f five north–south lines were run starting at $1940\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 Novembe r and ending at $0812~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 November. The vessel then began t o transit to Site M0071 to begin coring operations with the RD2.  

Following deterioration of the weather conditions again an d with the forecast not showing improvement, the vessel was put o n “waiting on weather” status as far as coring operations were concerned on 19 November. The vessel departed Site M0071 at $1226\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 November and transited toward the start of two multibea m lines planned to image the Atlantis Fracture Zone south of the Atlantis Massif complex. The survey commenced at $1315\,\mathrm{h}$ and ende d at $2052\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

By this point, the weather had deteriorated so much that th e multibeam data were badly affected. The Master ordered the vessel onto a southwest course, heading $246^{\circ}$ until further notice. The vessel spent the entire day of 20 November heading southwest and the n south, trying to avoid the worst of the weather. $\mathrm{On}\,21$ November, w e decided to turn the vessel back toward Atlantis Massif and track th e bad weather north, aiming to arrive back on site in workable conditions. The vessel turned at $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

At $2229\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 21 November, despite marginal conditions (swell $>$ $4.8\;\mathrm{m})$ ), the vessel slowed to $\sim\!5\,\mathrm{kt}$ to begin a multibeam line runnin g back across the Atlantis Fracture Zone and toward the Atlanti s Massif complex. The data quality was marginal. At $0027~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 2 November, a new multibeam line was started running west to eas t along the foot of the massif complex to fill in some data gaps. However, the sea state was not conducive to running in this direction, causing the system to freeze and requiring restarting twice, wit h very poor data quality, and the line was terminated at $0243~\mathrm{h}$ . W e decided to move to the eastern conjugate margin and begin a sout h to north oriented line that would run with the swell. This third lin e started at $0348\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 November and continued until $0600\,\mathrm{h},$ whe n the vessel was turned toward Site M0070.  

At $2013~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 November, the vessel departed Site M0075 t o recommence multibeam surveying while waiting on technical repairs to the RD2. The first line was the rerunning of a west to eas t line along the foot of Atlantis Massif because of the poor data quality acquired on 22 November. Following this run, the vessel move d to continue the north–south lines covering the eastern conjugat e margin of Atlantis Massif. The survey commenced at $2215\ \mathrm{h}$ an d ended at $0547\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 November with the vessel transiting back t o Site M0075 to restart coring operations.  

At $1620\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 November, the vessel departed from Site M007 4 to begin further multibeam surveys over Atlantis Massif, the Atlantis Fracture Zone, and the eastern conjugate margin. Both seabe d drills were nonoperational with repairs not able to be undertaken a t sea. The decision was therefore made to supplement the multibea m already acquired by continuing to survey the area, with one brea k for an additional CTD cast over Lost City, so as to best utilize th e operational time remaining before commencing the transit back t o Southampton, UK. The multibeam survey began at $1645~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 0 November, broke off at $0815~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 December for the CTD cast, restarted at $1734\;\mathrm{h},$ and ran until $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 December, when th e vessel began the transit.  

# Additional CTDs  

In addition to conducting a CTD cast prior to beginning corin g operations at every site, two additional CTDs were requested by offshore science party members while waiting on weather and unabl e to continue with coring operations. These additional casts were intended to capture the geochemical signature away from the mai n Lost City site and proposed coring locations, as unexpected levels o f gases had been captured during the baseline CTDs prior to coring.  

On 12 November, a CTD cast over the Atlantis Fracture Zon e was conducted between 1220 and $1529\,\mathrm{h}$ . The cast reached ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{m}$ of f the seafloor, with the deepest samples collected from ${\sim}4135\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth. Two Niskin bottles were fired at depth, and then two eac h were fired at a midway point in the water column. No near-surfac e sample was collected from this site. This additional CTD site wa s linked to Site M0072 (the closest coring location) and given the prefix M0072X. See Tables T4 and T5 for details of all CTD casts an d Niskin bottle depths. The vessel then began to transit to Site M007 3 to conduct another precoring CTD cast.  

On 14 November, a CTD cast over the MAR was conducted between 1229 and $1526\,\mathrm{h}$ . The cast reached ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{m}$ off the seafloor, wit h the deepest samples collected from ${\sim}4221\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth. In thi s instance, the usual sampling strategy was not followed, and two bottles were fired near the seafloor, a further two approximately $100\;\mathrm{m}$ above that, and the final two approximately $200\ \mathrm{m}$ above seafloor. This additional CTD site was linked to Site M0075 (the closest coring location) and given the prefix M0075X (Tables T4, T5). The vessel then began to transit toward Site M0070.  

On 1 December, a CTD cast was conducted in close proximit y to Lost City. The CTD commenced at $1548\,\mathrm{h}$ and was completed b y $1725\mathrm{~h~}$ . The deepest samples were collected from $807.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth. Samples were collected at ${\sim}807$ , 802, and $797\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth, based on a methane spike observed in the data. No near-surfac e sample was collected from this site. This additional CTD site wa s linked to Site M0072 (the closest coring location) and given the prefix M0072Z (Tables T4, T5). The vessel then returned to running  a multibeam survey over the western and northern edges of the Atlantis Massif area.  

# Site M0068  

# Hole M0068A  

The vessel moved onto Site M0068 (proposed Site AM-02A) a t $2208\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 November 2015, with the site position centered over th e RD2 port-side deployment position. The vessel settled into dynami c positioning (DP) mode. Prior to coring at each location, a CTD cas t was conducted to quantify the background geochemistry and microbiology within the water column. The CTD was deployed a t $2248\ \mathrm{h}$ and held at $10\textrm{m}$ water depth for a full systems check. A t $2332\,\mathrm{h},$ the CTD was $1.6\;\mathrm{m}$ off the bottom, and the first three Niski n bottles were fired. Two further Niskin bottles were fired on the wa y up, with a final one fired near the surface (Tables T4, T5). The CT D was recovered to deck at $0005\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 November.  

During the CTD cast, the RD2 was made ready for deployment . However,  a  communications  problem  with  the  CTD  senso r mounted on the drill delayed launch. The RD2 was deployed at 012 4 h; however, problems with the winch spooling mechanism and th e methane sensor on the water sensor package meant the drill was recovered at $0146\,\mathrm{h}$ before landing on the seafloor. At $_{0234}\,\mathrm{h}$ , the RD 2 was launched again, landing on the seafloor at $0356~\mathrm{h}$ after a full mid–water column systems check. Coring operations commence d at $0418\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The first core run was completed at $0602\,\mathrm{h}$ . However, a proble m with the Arm Shift meant that the RD2 had to be recovered after  a total penetration of $1.965\;\mathrm{m}$ . Prior to recovery, the Niskin bottles o n the water sampling package were fired. The RD2 was on deck an d secure by 0835. The vessel began to transit to Site M0069at $0840~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 November. Preparations began for deploying the MeBo.  

One coring attempt was made in Hole M0068A to a maximu m depth of $1.965\;\mathrm{m}$ with $23.9\%$ recovery.  

# Hole M0068B  

The vessel arrived on station at $1545~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 November 2015 . RD2 preparations continued until $1757~\mathrm{h},$ , when the drill was deployed. At $1836\;\mathrm{h},$ , the RD2 was brought back on deck after a mid– water column systems check revealed two sensors inputs wer e wrongly connected. The RD2 returned to deck at $1848~\mathrm{h}$ and wa s back in the water again by $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $2012\,\mathrm{h}$ , the RD2 landed on th e seafloor but had to reposition due to the angle of the drill. At $2031\,\mathrm{h}$ , the RD2 was settled on the seafloor, and coring operations began a t $2051\,\mathrm{h}$ . The first four core runs were completed at $2250\,\mathrm{h}$ on $23\,\mathrm{No}\cdot$ - vember and 0213, 0702, and $1158~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 November. Following  a problem with the LED light power supply, the tracer injection system was turned off from $0744\,\mathrm{h}$ to $1423\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 November, coverin g the period of core Run 4. The fourth core barrel was stuck in th e bottom-hole assembly (BHA), so the entire BHA was tripped and  a new one was inserted with a G7 bit.  

Difficulty was noted on reaming back down the hole, and corin g had to start from $^{1\textrm{m}}$ above the base of the hole because it looke d like the hole had partially collapsed. Core $\mathrm{Run}~5$ started at $1452~\mathrm{h}$ and was completed by $1605~\mathrm{h}.$ . At $1800~\mathrm{h}$ a hydraulic oil leak fro m the top drive was noted. At the rate of loss, there was approximatel y $20\,\mathrm{{h}}$ coring time left before logging and installing the packer woul d have to take place. Core Runs 6 and 7 were recovered at $1908\,\mathrm{h}$ an d $2340\ \mathrm{h},$ , respectively. Core $\scriptstyle\mathrm{{Run}}\;7$ did not achieve full penetration. Core Run 8 began at $0037~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 November, but by $0618~\mathrm{h}$ littl e progress $({\sim}70\,\mathrm{cm})$ had been made, so the barrel was tripped and th e hole conditioned and reamed. Barrel 9 was then loaded. However, after a discussion about the hole conditions, we decided to abando n the hole and attempt logging and installation of the packer.  

During this discussion, it was noted that the flush was variabl e with difficulties maintaining the flush pressure and flow; followin g the decision, it was found that the barrel was stuck in the BHA. A t $1023\,\mathrm{~h~}$ the optical acoustic gamma (OAG) logging tool was deployed, conducting two through-pipe upward logging passes. Thi s was completed by $1122\,\mathrm{h}$ . The magnetic susceptibility tool was the n deployed (at $1155\,\mathrm{h}$ ) through the pipe as an operational test for deployment, triggering, and recovery, as this had not been done so fa r on the expedition. The test was successfully completed by 1211 h. At $1218\;\mathrm{h},$ tripping of the rods commenced.  

Installation of the downhole packer commenced at $1305~\mathrm{h}$ an d was completed by $1343\,\mathrm{h}.$ . As the RD2 lifted off the seafloor at 135 0 h, the rig tilted and caught the top of the plug with the breakout table. It is unknown whether the plug was fully or partially pulled ou t of the borehole. The RD2 was recovered to deck and secure by 143 4 h on 25 November and the vessel immediately began to transit toward Site M0071.  

Nine coring attempts were made in Hole M0068B to a maximum depth of $9.6\;\mathrm{m}$ with $66.04\%$ recovery.  

# Site M0069  

# Hole M0069A  

The vessel arrived on station at Site M0069 (proposed Site AM06A) and settled into DP mode at $0915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 November 2015. Th e CTD was deployed at $0922\,\mathrm{{h},}$ . At 1006 the CTD was $1.7\textrm{m}$ off th e bottom, and the first three Niskin bottles were fired. Two furthe r Niskin bottles were fired on the way up, with a final one near th e surface (Tables T4, T5). The CTD was recovered on deck at $1038\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 November.  

At $1201~\mathrm{h}$ , MeBo drill deployment began. A full systems chec k was performed at $100\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth at $1304~\mathrm{h},$ but at $1337~\mathrm{h}$ w e found a hydraulic leak on the umbilical winch. After investigation, the deployment was continued, but after further leaking from th e umbilical winch, the dive was aborted at $1425\,\mathrm{h}$ and the MeBo wa s recovered on deck and was secure by $1530~\mathrm{h}$ . The RD2 was mad e ready for deployment because the predicted weather would put th e swell outside the operational range for launching the MeBo.  

At $2002\,\mathrm{~h~}$ the RD2 was deployed, stopping for a full system s check at $300\,\mathrm{m}$ water depth. At $2111\,\mathrm{h}$ , the bridge asked for the RD 2 to be stopped while they checked out a problem with GPS2. Th e RD2 held ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m}$ off seafloor for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ before continuing down t o the seafloor. Coring operations commenced at $2204\,\mathrm{h}$ . Coring continued steadily for 10 core runs, with core runs completed at $2218\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 November; 0057, 0510, 0726, 1113, 1413, 1705, 1921, and 220 5 h on 7 November; and $0249\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 November. Core Run 11 commenced at $0448\,\mathrm{h}$ . However, a technical problem with the gate valv e resulted in the reduction of flushing down the borehole. The dril l rods became stuck, and the drill string, BHA, bit, and core Barrel 1 1 were lost in the hole after attempts to free the rods were unsuccessful. The RD2 was recovered on deck by $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 November.  

During recovery, the Niskin bottles on the drill were not fired, s o a ship’s CTD cast was conducted over the drill site. The CTD wa s deployed at $0853~\mathrm{h}$ . At $0933\,\mathrm{h},$ , the CTD was $2.1~\mathrm{m}$ off the bottom, and four Niskin bottles were fired. No other bottles were fired mid– water column or near surface, and the CTD was recovered on dec k at $0955\,\mathrm{h}$ (Tables T4, T5). The vessel departed station immediatel y on recovery of the CTD on deck.  

Ten coring attempts were made in Hole M0069A to a maximu m depth of $16.44\;\mathrm{m}$ with $74.76\%$ recovery.  

# Site M0070  

# Hole M0070A  

The vessel was on station at Site M0070 (proposed Site AM07A) at $1212\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 8 November 2015 and settled into DP mode following a short multibeam survey over the area. The CTD was deployed at $1212\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . At $1259\,\mathrm{h},$ , the CTD was $1.7\;\mathrm{m}$ off the bottom, an d the first three Niskin bottles were fired. Two further Niskin bottle s were fired on the way up, with a final one near the surface (Table s T4, T5). The CTD was recovered on deck at $1334\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 November. The vessel position was adjusted so that the DP center was locate d over the stern deployment position for the MeBo drill.  

The MeBo was deployed at $1405~\mathrm{h},$ and by $1604~\mathrm{h}$ the drill wa s on the seafloor after mid–water column systems checks. The ri g was leveled to ensure the overshot was central over the breakout table, and at $1748\mathrm{~h~}$ coring operations commenced. At $2148~\mathrm{h}$ an d with $1.7\textrm{m}$ of penetration, rotation of the drill rod stopped due t o “sticky” conditions. The BHA was recovered and a new BHA pu t down the hole, changing from a surface set to a G4 bit. At $2040~\mathrm{h}$ , numerous bubbles were observed on the camera feed from th e MeBo drill. The MeBo stopped coring and the bubbles appeared t o stop, accompanied by a kick in the water sensor package readings. The MeBo started coring again at $2050\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , continuing until $0228\ \mathrm{h}$ on 8 November, when the overshot wire snapped while trying to recover core Run 3. The RD2 was put on standby and made ready fo r deployment. The MeBo was recovered on deck by $0506~\mathrm{h}$ , and a n assessment was made of the repairs required (overshot wire and  a transformer problem on the HV unit). The vessel departed the sit e at $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 November.  

Three coring attempts were made in Hole M0070A to a maximum depth of $4\,\mathrm{m}$ with $52.25\%$ recovery.  

# Hole M0070B  

After conducting a deep-water CTD cast over the MAR, the se a state calmed enough to deploy the RD2. The vessel transited to Sit e M0070, arriving and settling into DP mode by $1640\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November 2015. The all clear was given from the bridge at $1710\,\mathrm{h}$ , and th e RD2 was deployed at $1747\,\mathrm{h},$ landing on the seafloor at $1852\,\mathrm{h}$ . Coring started at $1910\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , but the BHA stalled at $1921\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $2039\,\mathrm{h},$ , th e RD2 lost all communications with the drill. The MeBo started predive checks in case the RD2 had to be recovered. At $2053\ \mathrm{h},$ afte r attempts to restart communications, the RD2 had to be recovered, initially with the BHA protruding from the bottom of the drill. A t $467~\mathrm{m}$ water depth at $2117\ \mathrm{h},$ , communications came back onlin e and the BHA could be retracted for a normal recovery. The RD 2 was on deck and secure by $2150\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November. The vessel wa s given clearance to begin the transit to Site M0073 for a MeBo deployment.  

One coring attempt was made in Hole M0070B to a maximu m depth of $1.3\;\mathrm{m}$ with $29.23\%$ recovery.  

# Hole M0070C  

The vessel arrived on station at $^{0720\mathrm{~h~}}$ on 22 November 201 5 after stopping a multibeam survey of the eastern conjugate margi n when bad weather conditions began to decrease. Because of swell from three directions, it took a while to find the best heading, so n o operations were allowed until $0818~\mathrm{h}$ . At this time, the RD2 wa s launched for a wet test and was recovered on deck at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ . Ther e were still issues with the RD2 gate valve, and weather condition s were still considered marginal for deployment of either drill, so th e vessel maintained position waiting on weather.  

The sea state and swell slowly came down, and at $1546\mathrm{~h~}$ th e Master of the Vessel gave permission for operations to start wit h MeBo deployment. The MeBo was in the water at $1659\,\mathrm{h}$ and on th e seafloor by $1835\,\mathrm{h}.$ . Coring started at $1916\,\mathrm{h}$ . Penetration slowed a t $1.17~\mathrm{m},$ , and the decision was made to take out the BHA (surface se t bit) and replace with a new BHA (G4) and second core barrel. Thi s process was completed by $2056~\mathrm{h}$ with the start of core Run 2. A t $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 November, the MeBo penetrated $5.2~\mathrm{m}$ with the thir d core barrel. However, there were problems in getting core Barrel  4 into the BHA, and after multiple attempts, we decided to remov e this BHA and replace it with the third one carried on the magazines. Because of broken magazine retainers it was not possible to remov e the third BHA from the magazine, so the second BHA was reinserted into the borehole in an attempt to ream back into the hole t o log and install a packer. Reentry proved difficult, and the onboar d cameras indicated that the hole was blocked near the surface. Afte r $^{1\,}\mathrm{m}$ of reaming the hole was aborted, neither logging nor packer insertion was attempted. On recovery, we noted that the shoe, liner, and core had been left inside the second BHA when the third cor e barrel was removed as part of normal operations. It is not understood how this happened, but it was this that caused the initia l problems with inserting Barrel 4. Additionally, although triggered, the Niskin bottles had failed to fire.  

The MeBo was recovered on deck by $1511\;\mathrm{h},$ and the vessel began to transit to Site M0068 for an RD2 deployment while the MeB o underwent repairs.  

Three coring attempts were made in Hole M0070C to a maximum depth of $5.21\;\mathrm{m}$ with $42.42\%$ recovery.  

# Site M0071  

# Hole M0071A  

At $1000~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 November 2015, following discussion with th e Co-Chief Scientist on shift, the vessel departed Site M0070 an d transited to Site M0071 (proposed Site AM-04A), arriving on station under DP by $1125~\mathrm{h}$ . The initial plan was to deploy the MeBo, but at $1340\,\mathrm{h},$ , because of a hydraulic leak, the plan altered to a RD 2 deployment, with the RD2 made ready by $1500~\mathrm{h}$ . By $1400~\mathrm{h},$ th e MeBo leak was repaired, however, and the plan reverted back to  a MeBo deployment.  

At $1400\,\mathrm{h},$ , a CTD cast was begun. At $1446\,\mathrm{h},$ the CTD was $2.2\,\mathrm{m}$ off the bottom, and the first three Niskin bottles were fired. Tw o further Niskin bottles were fired on the way up, with a final one nea r the surface (Tables T4, T5). The CTD was recovered on deck b y $1525\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The MeBo was deployed at $1700~\mathrm{h}$ , landing on the seafloor a t $1924\,\mathrm{h}$ after a mid–water column systems check. The slope was $19^{\circ}$ , so the drill had to reposition. It lifted off the seafloor and the vesse l moved ahead $10\;\mathrm{m}$ . At $2017\,\mathrm{h}$ , the MeBo was again on the seafloor, and coring started at $2050~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 November. Two core runs wer e completed at $0140~\mathrm{h}$ and $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 November. However, on recovering the barrel from core Run 2, the overshot wire snapped an d the hole had to be aborted. The MeBo was recovered on deck b y $0531\,\mathrm{h}$ following a technical issue with the winch slowing recovery, and repairs were started. The RD2 was made ready for deployment. The vessel departed the station at $0532\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Two coring attempts were made in Hole M0071A to a maximu m depth of $5.22\;\mathrm{m}$ with $54.6\%$ recovery.  

# Hole M0071B  

The vessel arrived on station and settled into DP mode at $0952\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 November 2015. Following completion of pre-dive checks, the RD2 was deployed at $1117~\mathrm{h}$ . However, a sensor failure on th e tool arm during a mid–water column systems checks meant th e drill had to be recovered, landing on deck at $1310\,\mathrm{h}$ . As repairs wer e still ongoing with the MeBo, the vessel stayed on station until th e RD2 could be relaunched at this site.  

The RD2 was deployed again at $1530~\mathrm{h}$ and landed on the seafloor at $1634\,\mathrm{h}$ . After repositioning once because of the slope angl e caused by landing on cobbles/boulders, coring commenced at 172 0 h. At $2025\ \mathrm{h},$ the tracer pump for the PFC tracer injection wa s turned off. The power supply was shared with one of the cameras, and interference was increasing and the cameras were dropping out. At $2027~\mathrm{h}$ , when delatching the core barrel from Run 1, the barre l was dropped; the slope angle caused the barrel to swing away fro m the tool arm and fall against the rig. The barrel was recovered an d stowed safely by $2147~\mathrm{h}$ . The second core run was completed b y $0011\ \mathrm{h}$ on 19 November, but latching and delatching core barrel s was still problematic because of the angle of the rig. It was therefor e decided to deploy core Barrel 3, ream out and lift the BHA out of th e hole, level the rig, and then ream back into the base of the hole before recommencing coring. This process was completed by $0254~\mathrm{h}$ . At $0709\,\mathrm{h},$ the RD2 began suffering hydraulic problems, with a small leak, and intermittent control issues. The Niskin bottles were fired, but because of a blocked gate valve, it was not possible to log.  

The top plug was connected to the packer section and inserte d into the borehole; however, the stop ring ended up $150~\mathrm{mm}$ abov e the breakout table. The “J” connector was disconnected from th e top plug at $1014\,\mathrm{h},$ and the RD2 was lifted off the seafloor at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ . However, the stop ring caught on the breakout table as the RD 2 came off the seafloor, pulling the plug out of the borehole. The RD 2 was recovered to deck by $1156\,\mathrm{h}$ in increasingly rough weather. On e leg would not retracted because of hydraulic problems, so one of th e Launch and Recovery System (LARS) base plates was removed t o set the drill level on the vessel. Coring operations were put on “waiting on weather” status, and the vessel left the site at $1226\ \mathrm{h}$ on 1 9 November to begin running multibeam surveys.  

Three coring attempts were made in Hole M0071B to a maximum depth of $4.3\;\mathrm{m}$ with $53.6\%$ recovery.  

# Hole M0071C  

The vessel arrived on station at $1515~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 November 201 5 having completed operations in Hole M0068B. MeBo deploymen t began at $1529\,\mathrm{h}$ with the drill on the seafloor in a stable position a t $1723\,\mathrm{h}$ . Coring operations commenced at $1802\,\mathrm{h}$ with a slight paus e in operations between 1808 and $1810~\mathrm{h}$ because the BHA looke d bent. The first core run was completed at $2015~\mathrm{h}$ . At $2115~\mathrm{h}$ , a full reboot of the MeBo was performed, causing disruption to the sensor package data stream. This stream was restarted at $2128\,\mathrm{h}$ . Coring continued throughout 26 November with core Runs 2– 5 recovered at 0425, 1047, 1620, and $2105\,\mathrm{h}$ . However, an issue developed with the sensor logger because of the systems reboot performed on 25 November. The package lost connection to external power until $0400~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 November, coinciding with core Run 2. Following this run, the sensor logger remained stable.  

Core Run 6 was completed on 27 November at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ after difficult drilling conditions and very slow penetration. Core Barrel  7 was deployed and reaming back to the base of the hole commenced, but again progress was very slow. At $1140\,\mathrm{h}$ , we decided to trip th e drill rods and change to a new BHA. On recovery $(1315\,\mathrm{h})$ ), we discovered that Barrel 7 was not latched into the BHA. A new BH A with a G4 bit was deployed at $1330~\mathrm{h}$ . Core Run 8 was effectivel y reaming back down to the base of the hole. There were problem s with hole stability and high torque, and the barrel was recovered a t $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ . Core Barrel 9 was deployed at $1937\;\mathrm{h},$ and reaming continued from 9.67 mbsf to the base of the original hole at 11.77 mbs f (core Run 6). Core Run 9 then continued $38\,\mathrm{cm}$ to 12.15 mbsf befor e recovery was attempted at $2225\,\mathrm{h}$ . However, the barrel was initiall y stuck in the BHA, only becoming free at $2345\,\mathrm{h}$ after numerous attempts to recover it with the overshot.  

At $2355\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 November, we decided to abandon the hole an d begin logging operations and installation of a downhole plug because of concerns over hole stability and slow progress. Two in-pip e runs were completed with the spectral gamma sonde by $0151\,\mathrm{h}_{!}$ an d the dual induction tool (DIL) was then picked up from the magazine. However, the top drive suffered a hydraulic failure, and the upper chuck would not  open. This  failure  not only prevente d deployment of the DIL but also recovery of the drill rods and BHA. At $0340\,\mathrm{h}$ on November 28, the MeBo was lifted off the seafloor, o n deck and secure by $0525\,\mathrm{h}$ . After removal of the Niskin bottles, th e vessel departed from the site at $0536\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on transit toward Sit e M0075.  

Nine coring attempts were made in Hole M0071C to a maximum depth of $12.15\;\mathrm{m}$ with $36.87\%$ recovery.  

# Site M0072  

# Hole M0072A  

At $0532\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 November 2015, the vessel began the transit t o Site M0072 (proposed Site AM-01A) from Site M0071. By $0610\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the vessel was on DP mode and the CTD was prepared for deployment. By $0723\,\mathrm{h}$ , the CTD cast was complete, having reached ${\sim}1.8$ m off the seafloor. Three Niskin bottles were fired near the seafloor, two mid–water column, and one near the surface (Tables T4, T5).  

By $0736\,\mathrm{h},$ the ship was settled into DP mode, centered over th e port-side deployment position for the RD2, and the drill was bein g made ready for launch. The RD2 was deployed at $1010\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $1045\,\mathrm{h}$ , following mid–water column checks, it was discovered that the onboard CTD sensor package had not been started. It was possible t o do this remotely, however, so the deployment continued and at 111 4 h the drill was positioned on the seafloor. Coring operations commenced at $1129\,\mathrm{h}$ , with the first core run completed by $1252\,\mathrm{h}$ . Th e second core run commenced at $1418\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . However, this run wa s aborted at $1438\mathrm{~h~}$ after consultation with the Co-Chief Scientist s when it was discovered that a packer had not been loaded onto th e drill. The RD2 was recovered to deck by $1535~\mathrm{h}$ . The two core barrels were unloaded, and the drill was readied for redeployment.  

Two coring attempts were made in Hole M0072A to a maximu m depth of $2.225\;\mathrm{m}$ with $39.1\%$ recovery.  

# Hole M0072B  

At $1642\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 November 2015, the RD2 was deployed in Hol e M0072B. The drill was on the seafloor at $1708~\mathrm{h}$ , and coring commenced at $1717~\mathrm{h}$ . Hole M0072A was visible $\sim\!1\textrm{m}$ away under th e skid of the RD2. The first three core runs were completed at 1815, 2053, and $2319\,\mathrm{h}$ . On recovery, however, the third barrel was foun d to be stuck in the BHA. After flushing and rotating the drill rods, the barrel was still stuck. The rod and BHA were tripped with th e barrel still inside, and a new BHA was deployed at $0229\,\mathrm{h}$ on $11\,\mathrm{No}-$ vember. After discussion, we decided to ream back down to th e depth reached by Run three $(5.1\textrm{m})$ and then open-hole past th e problem area (believed to be caused by talc) and recommence coring at $6\;\mathrm{m}$ . During this process, a sharp increase in torque was observed at the depth where the third barrel had become stuck.  

Coring continued throughout 11 November with high torqu e again observed at $8.93~\mathrm{m},$ , resulting in a short core run of only 1.2 8 m. The barrel of core Run 7 became stuck at $8.98~\mathrm{m}$ but was recovered after flushing. At 0411 h on 12 November, it was noted that th e umbilical had become twisted, possibly due to the influence of a n increasing sea swell, causing disruption to the controls to the hydraulic systems and the onboard cameras. It was requested that th e vessel move under DP, spinning about the drill position in an attempt to untwist the umbilical. It was initially believed that this ha d been successful, and the RD2 maintained position for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ to ensure communications were stable. However, communications wer e again lost, and the decision was made to recover the RD2 at $0535\,\mathrm{h}$ . It was not deemed safe to log the hole with unstable communications to the subsea drill controller, but the Niskin bottles were fire d at $0740\,\mathrm{h}$ and the packer was installed by $0805\,\mathrm{h}$ . By $0900\,\mathrm{h},$ , the RD 2 was on deck and secure. The umbilical was damaged and needed retermination, requiring at least $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ .  

At $0830\,\mathrm{h}$ the Master of the Vessel decided that the sea state wa s becoming excessive for deployment of either drill, so at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ th e vessel departed the site to continue a multibeam survey across Site s M0070 and M0074.  

Eight coring attempts were made in Hole M0072B to a maximum depth of $12.428\;\mathrm{m}$ with $52.22\%$ recovery.  

# Site M0073  

# Hole M0073A  

The vessel first arrived on Site M0073 (proposed Site AM-05A) , at $1640~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 November 2015 to conduct a CTD in advance o f coring. Drilling operations were on standby due to weather. Th e CTD was deployed at $1647\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $1731\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the CTD was $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ off th e bottom, and the first three Niskin bottles were fired. Two furthe r Niskin bottles were fired on the way up, with a final one near th e surface (Tables T4, T5). The CTD was recovered on deck at $1812\,\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel then left the site to continue a multibeam survey covering the western side of the Atlantis Massif complex.  

The vessel returned to Hole M0073A at $2242\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 Novembe r from Hole M0070B. The MeBo was made ready for deploymen t while repairs were ongoing with the RD2 after the communication s failure (this turned out to be a software issue requiring a reboot o f the Jupiter Control system).  

Fitting the water sampling system back onto the MeBo was delayed; it was deployed at $0220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 November and landed on th e seafloor at $0413\,\mathrm{h}$ . The seafloor was strewn with cobbles/boulders, causing leveling issues for the MeBo rig due to high slope angle s upon landing. The MeBo was repositioned three times before finally settling on site at $0455\,\mathrm{~h~}$ and beginning coring operations. There were some concerns regarding the stability of the GUI Interface on the Mebo controlling system, potentially affected by feedback from the high slope angles.  

At $0615\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , the MeBo team discovered that the base plate wa s damaged at some point, causing the port side leg to bend in and preventing the top drive from passing at the end of core Run 1. Corin g operations were aborted and the MeBo was recovered on deck b y $0909\mathrm{~h}.$ RD2 repairs were ongoing, with the ram for the headshif t requiring replacement following the discovery of a bent top pin preventing full extension. This was expected to take until midday. W e decided to transit to Site M0076, and the vessel departed at $0909\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 November.  

One coring attempt was made in Hole M0073A to a maximu m depth of $2.2~\mathrm{m}$ with no recovery.  

# Site M0074  

# Hole M0074A  

At $0824\mathrm{~h~}$ on 13 November 2015, we decided to temporaril y cease the multibeam survey of the Atlantis Massif complex and conduct a CTD cast at Site M0074 (proposed Site AM-09A). This cas t would obtain the baseline water information required for drillin g the site at a later date and make the best use of the current “waitin g on weather” status applicable to drilling operations. The CTD commenced at $0853~\mathrm{h},$ , reaching approximately $1.3\textrm{m}$ off the seafloor, and was back on deck and secure by $1042~\mathrm{h}$ . Three Niskin bottle s were fired near the seafloor, two were fired mid–water column, an d one near the surface (Tables T4, T5). Following this process, th e multibeam survey of the Atlantis Massif complex recommenced.  

The vessel returned to Site M0074 on 30 November at $1050~\mathrm{h}$ . With the RD2 nonoperational and the MeBo only able to run on e barrel length before having to return to deck (due to loss of too l handling capability), we planned to conduct a series of short hole s to try to intersect the fault deformation zone. The MeBo was deployed at $1056~\mathrm{h}$ and was on seafloor, after a mid–water colum n winch problem, by $1256~\mathrm{h}$ . Coring commenced at $1305~\mathrm{h}$ and rapidly progressed with $2.68\;\mathrm{m}$ penetration by $1325\,\mathrm{h}$ . However, initia l issues on recovery were followed by a mid–water column stop t o replace a failed winch controller card at $1450~\mathrm{h}$ . The MeBo was recovered on deck at $1535~\mathrm{h}$ . With no further drill operations no w possible for either drill, we decided to continue with the multibea m survey. The vessel departed the site at $1620\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 November.  

One coring attempt was made in Hole M0074A to a maximu m depth of $2.68\:\mathrm{m}$ with $32.09\%$ recovery.  

# Site M0075  

# Hole M0075A  

At 0300 on 14 November $2015\,\mathrm{h},$ , the vessel turned onto an eastsoutheast course for Site M0075 (proposed Site AM-03A). The vessel settled into DP mode at $0800\,\mathrm{h};$ however, the swell was still prohibitive for the deployment of either drill $(>\!4\;\mathrm{m})$ . At $0838\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , a CT D cast was begun. At $1003\;\mathrm{h},$ , the CTD was $2.4~\mathrm{m}$ off the bottom, an d the first three Niskin bottles were fired. Two further Niskin bottle s were fired on the way up, with a final one fired near the surface (Tables T4, T5). The CTD was recovered on deck by $1102~\mathrm{h}$ . Havin g completed the CTD, the sea state was still too rough, so the vesse l moved off site at $1111\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November to conduct an additiona l CTD cast over the MAR.  

The vessel returned to Site M0075 on 28 November at $0625\ \mathrm{h}$ from Hole M0071C.The RD2 was initially deployed at $0654\,\mathrm{h}$ . However, after repositioning three times because of the angle of the ri g on landing, the RD2 had to return to deck at $0912~\mathrm{h}$ because of  a minor oil leak. The RD2 was redeployed at $1058\,\mathrm{h}$ and landed on th e seafloor at $1153~\mathrm{h}$ . Coring commenced at $1210\;\mathrm{h},$ and the first cor e run was completed by $1320~\mathrm{h}$ . Core Barrel 2 was loaded into th e BHA at $1356\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , but at $1400~\mathrm{h}$ the RD2 suffered a sensor cable faul t and we had to abandon the hole, returning it on deck at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ . Th e vessel held position while for repairs. By $^{1700\ \mathrm{h},}$ the cable wa s changed out, but a hydraulic leak in the top drive was discovered. The only option was to exchange the top drive for another one, which would take approximately $18\,\mathrm{h}$ . The fault with the MeBo, suffered in Hole M0071C, was a hydraulic slip ring inside the top driv e assembly that is not repairable at sea. Because repairs to the RD 2 would take some time, we decided to leave the site and continu e running the multibeam survey. The vessel departed the site at 201 3 h on 28 November.  

One coring attempt was made in Hole M0075A to a maximu m depth of $1.72\,\mathrm{m}$ with $37.79\%$ recovery.  

# Hole M0075B  

The vessel arrived on station at $0725~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 November 201 5 having completed a short multibeam survey at $0547\,\mathrm{h}$ . Repairs wer e still ongoing on the RD2, so the vessel waited on station until th e drill was ready for deployment at $1505~\mathrm{h}$ . During mid–water column checks a misalignment between the newly fitted top drive an d the breakout table was noted, and the RD2 was recovered on deck a t $1540~\mathrm{h}$ . The RD2 crew removed the shims from the breakout tabl e and redeployed at $1834~\mathrm{h}$ despite a small misalignment. The RD 2 landed on the seafloor at $1941\ \mathrm{h}$ and began coring operations a t $1948~\mathrm{h}$ . The first core was recovered at $2028~\mathrm{h}$ . The second barre l was inserted, and a rod was added. The misalignment meant tha t this previously automated action had to be done manually, after th e first automated try resulted in the threads of the rod being rippe d off. This situation meant longer rod handling times but allowed coring to continue despite the misalignment.  

Core Run 2 was completed at $2329\,\mathrm{h},$ , and a new core run commenced at $0015\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 November. At $0530\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ there was a technical failure in the ECU motherboard, terminating the hole and preventing any logging runs because we were could not operate the overshot. The Niskin bottles were fired at $0612\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , the drill rods and BH A were recovered to the rig by $0652\,\mathrm{h}$ , and a shortened version of th e downhole plug was installed by $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ . The RD2 was back on dec k and secure by $0950~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 November, and the vessel departed fo r Site M0074 immediately.  

Three coring attempts were made in Hole M0075B to a maximum depth of $5.7\;\mathrm{m}$ with $47.88\%$ recovery.  

# Site M0076  

# Hole M0076A  

The vessel arrived at Site M0076 (proposed Site AM-11A) a t $1020~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 November 2015 and settled into DP mode. RD2 predive checks were still ongoing at the time of arrival, and deploymen t was delayed until $1339~\mathrm{h}$ . Coring operations began at $1456~\mathrm{h}$ wit h rapid penetration to 1.72 mbsf (end of core Run 1) by $1523\,\mathrm{h}$ . A hydraulic leak on the headshift terminated the hole early, and the RD 2 was recovered on deck by $1606\,\mathrm{h}$ . No Niskin bottles were fired under instruction from the Co-Chief Scientist on shift.  

The MeBo was still being repaired following the damage to th e base plate and leg, so the RD2 was rapidly turned around and redeployed in Hole M0076B.  

One coring attempt was made in Hole M0076A to a maximu m depth of $1.72\,\mathrm{m}$ with $23.26\%$ recovery.  

# Hole M0076B  

The RD2 was redeployed at Site M0076 at 1731 h on 15 November 2015. After initially landing on the seafloor at $1812\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , the drill had to be repositioned because of a high slope angle caused by landing unevenly on cobbles/boulders. The RD2 finally settled on th e seafloor at $2012\,\mathrm{{h}}$ after three attempts to reposition both the drill and the umbilical. Coring operations commenced at 2040. Corin g continued well until the end of core Run 2 $[0005~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 November), when high flush had to be run until $0133~\mathrm{h}$ to free the stuc k core barrel. A further eight core runs were recovered at 0615, 0933, 1336, 1706, and $2158\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 November and 0132, 0429, and $0914\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November. At $14.75\;\mathrm{m}$ penetration, high backpressure on th e flush pump was noted due to a “sticky” section. At the start of cor e $\mathrm{Run\,11}$ (penetration $=16.3\;\mathrm{m}]$ ), there was difficulty reaming back t o the base of the hole. The rods became stuck with a small stick-u p due to failure of the gate valve and subsequently no flush flow int o the borehole. There was difficulty removing the overshot spea r point from the overshot; this was finally achieved using the fishin g tool, which is slightly shorter in length.  

Prior to attempting to free the drill rods, two OAG loggin g passes were completed through the pipe logging from the botto m up. The logging runs commenced at $1315\,\mathrm{h}$ and were complete b y $1347\,\mathrm{h}$ . Various attempts were then made to free the drill rods, enabling the last rod to be unscrewed and recovered. An attempt wa s then made to connect the borehole plug to the drill rods still in th e borehole, but it could not be connected. In attempting connection, the “J” connection at the top of the plug parted, resulting in the plu g being unconnected both top and bottom. It was clamped in th e breakout jaws but was lost during recovery of the drill. The RD2 wa s recovered on deck by $1656\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November.  

While coring was ongoing, repairs were undertaken on th e MeBo drill to port and starboard leg positions, a missing base plate, and the leg connection point. Some areas were cut away to allow fo r welding of new plates to strengthen the frame. On recovery, th e RD2 crew required $12{-}14\;\mathrm{h}$ of maintenance to get the drill operational. As both drills were unavailable for deployment, we decide d to continue with the multibeam survey, imaging the conjugate margin of the Atlantis Massif complex. The vessel departed Site M007 6 at $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November.  

Ten coring attempts were made in Hole M0076B to a maximu m depth of $16.3~\mathrm{m}$ with $71.79\%$ recovery.  

# Transit back to Southampton, UK  

The vessel departed from the Atlantis Massif survey area at 020 0 h on 2 December 2015. The vessel arrived at the pilot station at th e entrance to Southampton Water at $0600~\mathrm{h}$ UTC on 11 December, and the pilot came onboard at $0830~\mathrm{h}$ UTC for the final approac h into Southampton and the National Oceanography Centre Southampton quayside. The ropes were ashore by $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ UTC.  

# Outreach and communication  

The primary objective of Expedition 357 outreach and communication efforts was to demonstrate the benefits and excitement o f the expedition’s science and the IODP program in general to th e media, nongovernmental organizations, governments, the scientifi c community, and the general public.  

To accomplish this objective, our primary efforts were publicit y of the expedition’s aims and findings to international media, focused on media and journalist networks developed within th e IODP/ECORD community and through the scientific participants. Secondary efforts were focused on hosting web-logs during the expedition for the general public to follow along with the life of science at sea.  

Targeted activities in support of the communication objectiv e included  

• Preparation of expedition promotional materials, including an expedition logo, flier, and briefing kit.   
• Radio interviews with, for example, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for use on local and national news, as well as the BBC World Service.   
• Organization of a media briefing prior to the start of the expedition. This briefing was held at the Foreign Press Office in London, England (UK), on 22 October 2015. The briefing included short presentations by the Co-Chief Scientists about the scientific aims of the expedition, followed by a question and answer session with journalists. This was followed by a small media briefing onboard the RRS James Cook for local journalists in Southampton.   
• Organization of a second media event during the on-shore phase of the expedition. This event was held on 1 February 2016 at MARUM and featured short presentations by the Co-Chief Scientists followed by interviews and tours of the laboratory facilities and core repository.  

• Individual contacts and interviews of members of the science party with public relations services at their home institutions and with local media in different countries. • Regular promotion of the expedition’s accomplishments through posts on social media platforms such as Twitter.  

These efforts were successful in gaining international attentio n for the expedition, which was featured in news articles in Finland, France, Germany, UK, and USA, as well as radio and TV segment s with interviews from the Co-Chief Scientists and several scientifi c participants. The expedition’s science is also targeted for feature i n a news documentary.

Figure F1. A. Conceptual sketch of lithospheric accretion and the tectonomagmatic evolution of a heterogeneous lithosphere and denudation of mantle rock s as detachment faulting progresses and oceanic core complexes are formed at slow-spreading ridges (from 2010 AGU Chapman Conference Report “Detachments in oceanic lithosphere: deformation, magmatism, fluid flow, and ecosystems,” available at http://2010chapman.blogspot.fr). B. Example from Atlanti s Massif: the southern wall is dominated by variably altered peridotites with gabbroic lenses (modified after Boschi et al., 2006) in contrast to (C) major gabbroi c intrusions in the central dome (Grimes et al., 2008; copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union).

Figure F3. Field relations in the target area along the Atlantis Massif southern wall. A. Sedimentary cap sequences overlie the detachment fault zone (consisting of variably thick zones of talc-amphibole schists within mylonitic and serpentinized peridotites) (Boschi et al., 2006; Karson et al., 2006). B. These sequence s underlie hydrothermal deposits in the vicinity of the LCHF and overlie the detachment shear zone (DSZ) (Karson et al., 2006; copyright 2006 by the America n Geophysical Union). C. Above the LCHF, cap sediments are cut by hydrothermal carbonates. D. These carbonates are locally venting diffuse fluids and hav e microbial filaments.
