# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 361 drille d six sites on the southeast African margin (southwest Indian Ocean ) and in the Indian-Atlantic Ocean gateway, from 30 January to 3 1 March 2016. In total, $5175\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered, with an averag e recovery of $102\%$ , during 29.7 days of on-site operations. The sites, situated in the Mozambique Channel at locations directly influenced by discharge from the Zambezi and Limpopo River catchments, the Natal Valley, the Agulhas Plateau, and Cape Basin, wer e targeted to reconstruct the history of the greater Agulhas Curren t system over the past ${\sim}5$ My. The Agulhas Current is the stronges t western boundary current in the Southern Hemisphere, transporting some $70~\mathrm{Sv}$ of warm, saline surface water from the tropical Indian Ocean along the East African margin to the tip of Africa. Exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere influenc e southern African climates, including individual weather system s such as extratropical cyclone formation in the region and rainfal l patterns. Recent ocean model and paleoceanographic data furthe r point at a potential role of the Agulhas Current in controlling th e strength and mode of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during the Late Pleistocene. Spillage of saline Agulha s water into the South Atlantic stimulates buoyancy anomalies tha t may influence basin-wide AMOC, with implications for convectiv e activity in the North Atlantic and global climate change. The mai n objectives of the expedition were to establish the role of the Agulha s Current in climatic changes during the Pliocene–Pleistocene, specifically to document the dynamics of the Indian-Atlantic Ocea n gateway circulation during this time, to examine the connection o f the Agulhas leakage and AMOC, and to address the influence of th e Agulhas Current on African terrestrial climates and coincidence s with human evolution. Additionally, the expedition set out to fulfill the needs of Ancillary Project Letter number 845, consisting o f high-resolution interstitial water sampling to help constrain th e temperature and salinity profiles of the ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum.  

The expedition made major strides toward fulfilling each o f these objectives. The recovered sequences allowed generation o f complete spliced stratigraphic sections that range from 0 to between ${\sim}0.13$ and $7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . This sediment will provide decadal- to millennial-scale  climatic  records  that  will  allow  answering  th e paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic questions set out in the drilling proposal.

The greater Agulhas Current system around South Africa consists of the Agulhas Current flowing south along the African shelf. Off the southern tip of Africa, the Agulhas Current abruptl y retroflects and feeds back into the Indian Ocean. During this process, huge rings of water (Agulhas rings) are separated, drifting into the Atlantic and representing “salt leakage.”

gest western boundary current in the Southern Hemisphere (Lutjeharms, 2006a) transporting ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{Sv}$ ( $1\;\mathrm{Sv}=10^{6}\:\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s})$ of warm, salin e tropical surface waters to the tip of Africa (Figures F1, F2), roughl y twice that of the Gulf Steam in the North Atlantic (Cunningham e t al., 2007). Like its northern counterpart, the Agulhas Current fosters exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere that influence regional climates and weather systems (Reason and Mulenga, 1999). A portion of the Agulhas waters invade the South Atlanti c through the Agulhas rings (Arhan et al., 2011), which form whe n the current retroflects at the tip of Africa and transport between 5 and $20\,\mathrm{Sv}$ of warm, saline water from the Indian Ocean to the Sout h Atlantic—the so-called interocean “warm-water route” of the global oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). Ocean models and paleoceanographic data strongly suggest that the “leakage” of salin e Agulhas water into the South Atlantic stimulates regional buoyanc y anomalies that ultimately impact convective activity in the norther n North Atlantic, plausibly acting as a contributor to the basin-wid e Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (Figure F1 ) (Weijer, 2001; Weijer et al., 2002; Knorr and Lohmann, 2003; va n Sebille et al., 2009; Biastoch et al., 2008, 2009a). Numerical simulations specifically point to Agulhas leakage as a potential modulato r of the AMOC and a rheostat for the ventilation of the deep ocean. Hence the significance of the Agulhas Current is threefold: (1) th e Agulhas Current is a significant component of the global THC-carrying surface water into the Atlantic that compensates for the export of deep water from the Atlantic Basin to the world ocean, (2 ) the Agulhas leakage transfer of salt to the South Atlantic variabl y impacts the buoyancy structure there and may contribute to mod e changes and variability of the AMOC and thus climate variability i n the North Atlantic region and beyond, and (3) variations in Agulha s warm-water transports along the southeast African continental margin drive interannual variability with implications for souther n Africa regional climate and weather systems.  

Studies of the long-term evolution of ocean circulation of f southern Africa, on Pliocene–Pleistocene timescales, have previously been undertaken on the Atlantic side of the continent. Dee p Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Legs 40 and 75 in 1974 and 1980 an d Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 108 and 114 in 1985 and 198 7 targeted the southwest African continental slope and rise north an d south of Walvis Ridge to explore marine conditions during th e opening of the South Atlantic, including the origin and paleoceanographic history of the Eastern Walvis Ridge and carbonate dissolution cycles. More recently, ODP Leg 175 in 1997 targeted th e southeastern Atlantic margin between $5^{\circ}$ and $32^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to assess the history of the Benguela Current and upwelling off Angola and Namibia. ODP Leg 208 in 2003 drilled a transect of six sites on Walvi s Ridge to gain insight into paleoceanographic events such as the hyperthermal events of the Paleocene and Eocene and the early Oligocene Oi1 cold event.  

By contrast, the eastern continental margin off southern Afric a is poorly represented in the database of scientific drill sites. Prior t o Expedition 361, only one site, DSDP Site 244, had been drille d within the direct reaches of the South Indian Ocean western boundary current. The site is positioned on Davie Ridge, at the norther n entrance of the Mozambique Channel, and was occupied durin g Leg 25 in 1972 (Simpson, Schlich, et al., 1974) to provide data on th e structure and geological history of the East African margin an d western Madagascar.  

Expedition 361 fills this scientific/geographic gap by drilling targets in three sectors of the greater Agulhas Current system (Figur e F3):  

1. The northern sector in the Mozambique Channel that provides the source waters of the Agulhas Current,   
2. The central sector in the confluence region where the southwestern extension of the East Madagascar Current converges

# Background  

# Motivation for drilling in the greater Agulhas Current system  

# The Agulhas Current system—modern oceanographic circulation  

The Agulhas Current constitutes the largest ocean wester n boundary jet in the Southern Hemisphere. The current is part of th e warm-water return flow that feeds the renewal of North Atlanti c Deep Water (NADW) and is a key component of the global oceani c thermohaline “conveyor belt” circulation (Gordon, 1986; Weijer e t al., 1999; Lutjeharms, 2006a). The Agulhas Current carries thermocline waters from the South Indian Ocean subtropical gyre wit h contributions from the Red Sea and Arabian Sea and from the Indonesian Throughflow (Lutjeharms, 2006a) (Figure F4). Driven by th e anticyclonic wind field over the South Indian Ocean, Agulhas Current water is advected by eddies and meanders from the equatorial Indian Ocean through the Mozambique Channel and the East Madagascar Current (EMC) (Song et al., 2004; Beal et al., 2006). Interaction between Madagascar and westward-traveling Rossby wave s from the tropical Indian Ocean contribute to the formation of eddies (Schouten et al., 2002a) east of Madagascar (Biastoch an d Krauss, 1999). Four to five of these eddies per year, as wide as 35 0 km, drift southward through the Mozambique Channel, with  a mean transport of $17~\mathrm{Sv}$ (Ridderinkhof et al., 2010). These eddie s impose short-term circulation modulation over the entire dept h and width of the channel (de Ruijter et al., 2002) and impart an interannual variability of ${\sim}9~\mathrm{Sv}$ to the Agulhas Current (Biastoch e t al., 2009a).  

The ocean/atmosphere coupling in the tropical Indian Ocea n provides important upstream forcing of the Agulhas Current (Ridderinkhof et al., 2010). The South Equatorial Current (SEC), split s into a southern and northern branch, once reaching Madagascar, forming the South East Madagascar Current (SEMC) and Nort h East Madagascar Current (NEMC) (Figure F3). The SEMC has a n estimated average transport of 20 Sv in its northern reaches (Donohue and Toole, 2003; Schott et al., 1988), increasing to $35\;\mathrm{Sv}$ at th e southern tip of Madagascar (Nauw et al., 2008). At the latitude o f Durban $(30^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ , the westward-flowing southern extension of th e SEMC converges with the southward-flowing train of Mozambiqu e Channel eddies to form the Agulhas Current as a narrow jet-typ e current that is steered by the steep South African continental margin. Fully constituted at $32^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , the Agulhas Current carries ${\sim}70$ Sv o f warm $(24^{\circ}{-}17^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and saline (35.5–35.2 psu) (Gordon and Haxby, 1990; Gordon et al., 1992; Beal and Bryden, 1999; Bryden and Beal, 2001) waters of the South Indian Ocean thermocline (Bryden et al., 2005). In its deeper parts, the current also includes saline Red Se a Intermediate Water (Gordon et al., 1987) and other waters derive d from far-distant sources in the Pacific Ocean (Gordon and Fine, 1996; Speich et al., 2002) (Figure F4).  

The Agulhas Current’s mean trajectory is steered by the bathymetry of the narrow southeast African shelf where its steep conti

nental slope provides for maximum barotropic and baroclini c guidance (de Ruijter et al., 1999b; Lutjeharms and de Ruijter, 1996; Goschen and Schuman, 1990). Instabilities of the current are cause d by the migration of eddies and meanders that interact with th e bathymetry and morphology of the continental margin. An exampl e is solitary meanders that form in the Natal Bight, the so-called Nata l Pulses (Figure F5) (e.g., Lutjeharms and Roberts, 1988; Beal an d Bryden, 1999; de Ruijter et al., 1999b; van Leeuwen et al., 2000; Bryden et al., 2005; Biastoch et al., 2008; Tsugawa and Hasumi, 2010; Rouault and Penven, 2011). At the tip of Africa, the curren t veers briefly to the west, driven by its own inertia, and then retroflects back to the east into the Indian Ocean as the ARC (Lutjeharm s and Van Ballegooyen, 1988). Mozambique Channel and EMC eddies that propagate downstream with the Agulhas Current a s strongly barotropic solitary meanders (Bryden et al., 2005; Biastoc h et al., $2009{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Tsugawa and Hasumi, 2010) destabilize the retroflection. Four to six anticyclonic eddies (Agulhas rings) form per yea r with a radius of up to $400~\mathrm{km};$ ; they spin off the retroflection are a carrying between 2 and $20\,\mathrm{Sv}$ of thermocline water to the South Atlantic Ocean (de Ruijter et al., $1999\mathrm{a}$ ; Richardson, 2007). Some researchers have suggested that Agulhas leakage is linked wit h interannual modes of Indian and Pacific Ocean variability, thus implying a connection with the Indian Ocean Dipole and Pacifi c Ocean La Niña/El Niño phases (Schouten et al., $2002\mathrm{b}$ ; Palastang a et al., 2006).  

# Agulhas leakage and the AMOC  

The dynamics of the Agulhas leakage and its possible impact o n the AMOC and global climate have been explored in a number o f ocean and climate models. These studies suggest that (1) the transfer affects the buoyancy of Atlantic Ocean thermocline waters, potentially influencing NADW formation on multidecadal timescale s

(Weijer et al., 2002; Knorr and Lohmann, 2003; Biastoch et al., $2009\mathrm{a})$ and (2) perturbations of planetary (Kelvin and Rossby) wave s by mesoscale eddies propagate across the Atlantic Basin influenc e variability of the AMOC (van Sebille and van Leeuwen, 2007; Biastoch et al., 2008, 2009a).  

Short-term variability that appears to be associated with Agulhas leakage is observed in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean (d e Ruijter et al., 1999a), whereas some of the interannual to decadal AMOC variability seen in the models plausibly stems from the frequency of Agulhas ring shedding that, in turn, is modulated by tropical interannual variability (de Ruijter et al., 1999a; Gordon an d Haxby, 1990). The basin-scale radiation of planetary waves triggered by Agulhas leakage hence constitutes a “fast-response” mechanism that operates on interannual to decadal timescales.  

The advection of saltwater from the Agulhas region to the convection centers in the North Atlantic Ocean is the likely connectio n between the AMOC response and Agulhas leakage. Seeding numerical Lagrangian floats into the Agulhas retroflection area in highresolution ocean general circulation models reveals an advectiv e transit time of 30–40 y from the Agulhas Current to the North Atlantic Ocean (van Sebille et al., 2010). These time estimates are als o consistent with those obtained with lower-resolution models (Weijer, 2001). Continuing heat exchange with the overlying atmospher e augments the density anomaly associated with leaked Agulhas saltwater parcels as they drift northward (Weijer, 2001; Haarsma et al., 2011). Agulhas leakage therefore stimulates an AMOC respons e with a time delay dictated by the advective timescale for the exces s salt to reach the North Atlantic Ocean; the new AMOC equilibriu m state is achieved several hundred years later when buoyancy fluxe s and mixing are in balance (Weijer, 2001; Hughes et al., 2009). Establishing the impact of wind forcing on Agulhas leakage and its subsequent effect on the AMOC is not straightforward because th e strength and position of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitud e westerlies may affect the Agulhas leakage and AMOC simultaneously (Biastoch et al., 2009b; Toggweiler and Samuels, 1995; Sijp an d England, 2008), perhaps by shifting the position of the Subtropica l Front (STF) south of Africa. For example, the STF is thought b y some to define the width of the Agulhas leakage corridor, hence th e strength of the leakage. On the other hand, recent modeling studie s show a stronger dynamic relationship with the intensity of th e Southern Hemisphere westerlies (Durgadoo et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the westerlies control the northward Ekman transport in th e Southern Ocean, which forces deep water to ascend to the uppe r ocean, conceivably “pulling” the deep branch of the AMOC (Toggweiler and Samuels, 1995; Visbeck, 2007). Through their influenc e on deep-water upwelling and AMOC strength, the westerly wind s and Agulhas buoyancy fluxes likely play important roles in the regulation of the ocean’s ability to store carbon (Watson and Garabato, 2006; Backeberg et al., 2012). This connection represents an additional plausible link between Agulhas leakage and global climat e variability.  

# Paleoceanography of the Agulhas Current system  

The Agulhas Current region is an area in which retrieval o f high-quality sediment cores is difficult. The southeast African margin has a very narrow shelf and a steep continental slope, leading t o frequent sediment instability and slumping. Further, the vigorou s Agulhas Current and its mesoscale variability can cause sedimen t redistribution because meanders and eddies frequently reach th e seafloor. Yet, a number of published studies and emerging wor k demonstrate that paleoceanographic records of excellent quality ar e in fact achievable for reconstructing both surface and deep-wate r variability in the region. A full synthesis of the paleoceanographi c evidence is yet to emerge, but several aspects of the Agulhas paleotime series reflect broad consensus. Based on published records, Agulhas leakage has been a persistent feature of the past $1.3~\mathrm{My},$ with less leakage during full glacial times than interglacial times an d greatest leakage at the glacial terminations (Peeters et al., 2004; Caley et al., 2012; Petrick et al., 2015). There is also general agreemen t about evidence for a more northerly position of the STF during glacial times (Rau et al., 2002, 2006; Bard and Rickaby, 2009; MartínezMéndez et al., 2010) and some suggestion that this may play a role i n reducing Agulhas leakage. However, it is also possible that the positions of the westerly wind belt and STF can be decoupled (Graha m and De Boer, 2013; De Boer et al., 2013; Durgadoo et al., 2013), leading to some uncertainty in the exact mechanisms of changing Agulhas leakage.  

At the tip of Africa, a spliced record composed of Cores GeoB3603-2 and MD96-2081 (termed the Cape Basin Record; Peeters e t al., 2004) shows maximum abundance of the so-called “Agulha s leakage fauna” (ALF) that appears to be related to minima in precession index (maxima in northern summer insolation), leading thes e authors to suggest a possible teleconnection to the monsoon system. Multiple-proxy data from planktonic foraminifers from sediment Core MD96-2080 on the Agulhas Bank provide a detaile d reconstruction of surface-ocean conditions in the area. Continue d warming across full-glacial stages (marine isotope Stages [MIS]  2 and 6) displayed in planktonic $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ data implies increased influence of warm Agulhas water in the region and/or reduced northward advection of cold subantarctic surface water (MartínezMéndez et al., 2010) (Figure F6). This pattern is consistent with th e

![](images/442bd5ff932c36aa16e922c666e17514c695efee2715081cceaa1c90b13443c2.jpg)  

hypothesis that peak Agulhas leakage occurred during glacial terminations and plausibly aided the AMOC to shift to its full-strengt h interglacial mode (Knorr and Lohmann, 2003, 2007; Peeters et al., 2004). A high-resolution faunal record of the accumulation rate o f tropical species Globorotalia menardii at ODP Site 1087 in th e southern Benguela region was used to infer that Agulhas leakag e strengthened during every glacial termination of the past 1.3 M y (Caley et al., 2012). The interpretation of increased leakage durin g terminations in the Late Pleistocene is also supported by the combination of alkenone proxies $\mathrm{[}\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{k}}{}^{37}$ and δD) along with dinoflagellat e cyst assemblages, sea-surface temperature (SST), and salinity estimates (Petrick et al., 2015).  

SST and salinity records upstream along the southeast Africa n margin (Core MD96-2048; 26°S) display prominent 41 ky cyclicit y that was interpreted to suggest that long-term Agulhas Curren t variations are associated with high-latitude (as opposed to regional tropical) climate forcing (Caley et al., 2011). However, the cyclicit y also suggests that some of the apparent variability in Agulhas leakage could actually be due to changes in the Agulhas Current. Thus, to circumvent the potential problem that ALF (Peeters et al., 2004 ) and G. menardii (Rau et al., 2006; Caley et al., 2012) indexes migh t be sensitive to the changing composition of the Agulhas source assemblage upstream, Caley et al. (2014) developed a new quantitativ e foraminiferal-based proxy index for Agulhas leakage, named Agulhas leakage efficiency; they suggested that Agulhas leakage efficiency represents the transfer of Agulhas water from the India n Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean independent of the variations in th e source assemblage. Using this approach, Caley et al. (2014) confirmed substantial changes in Agulhas leakage volume transports a t the termination of glacial periods and suggested the possibility of  a complete halt of leakage during MIS 12.  

The composition of terrigenous sediment in core tops of marin e sediment cores around South Africa shows significant and systematic provenance variations (Franzese et al., 2006, 2009). Provenanc e studies using $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\mathrm{Sr},$ εNd, and $^{230}\mathrm{Th}_{\mathrm{xs}}$ flux estimates from Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) samples from a number o f cores near the tip of South Africa were used to suggest reduced advection of sediment derived from Agulhas water (and therefore possibly Agulhas leakage) during peak glacial times (Franzese et al., 2006). In a follow-up study, Franzese et al. (2009) made a more detailed geographic study of Holocene and LGM samples from a set o f cores from the R/V Charles Darwin 154 site survey cruise as well a s additional Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory repository core s from the Agulhas Plateau. The authors of these two studies infer  a weaker Agulhas Current and less leakage, as well as an Agulhas trajectory very similar to modern. These results are partly at odds wit h models that suggest that if the wind pattern is fixed but its strengt h reduced, a weaker Agulhas Current results in increased leakage (D e Ruijter, 1982; Dijkstra and De Ruijter, 2001; van Sebille et al., 2009). However, if the winds shift northward and weaken during glacia l periods, a weaker Agulhas Current could combine with reduce d leakage. The equivocal comparison between data and models call s for further work including multiproxy analyses.  

A key question concerning Agulhas leakage is How importan t are the locations of the STF and westerly wind belts? For instance, early work from Core MD96-2080 from the western flank of th e Agulhas Bank (Rau et al., 2006) showed the continuous presence o f subtropical planktonic foraminifers (e.g., G. menardii); this observation implies persistent leakage of Indian Ocean to Atlantic Ocea n surface water flow during the last $450\;\mathrm{ky}$ . On the other hand, transient occurrences of subpolar species (Neogloboquadrina pachyderma dextral) suggest intermittent incursions of cold subantarcti c waters in the Agulhas corridor during glacial periods (Rau et al., 2002, 2006), perhaps the result of meridional shifts of the subtropical and subantarctic fronts. The evidence suggesting significan t northward movement of the STF during some full-glacial stages (b y as much as $7^{\circ}$ ; Bard and Rickaby, 2009) is consistent with this ide a because Agulhas Current transports into the gateway and leakage t o the South Atlantic Ocean would presumably be reduced as a consequence. However, this picture is contrasted by substantial increase s of ALF (Peeters et al., 2004) in the Agulhas corridor at the termination of glacial periods, alluding to an involvement of Agulhas leakage in interhemispheric ocean and climate change, notably th e resumption of NADW formation (Peeters et al., 2004). Additionally, the records of Caley et al. (2014) and Petrick et al. (2015) als o demonstrate Agulhas leakage was a persistent feature of the pas t $500~\mathrm{ky},$ including glacial MIS 10 (Caley et al., 2014), apparently a t odds with the inferred effect on Agulhas leakage caused by the significant northward migration of the STF. Again the apparent contradictions of different data sets and between data sets and theor y call for further work.  

Multiple-species stable isotope and alkenone data from OD P Site 1085, slightly further north on the Atlantic margin, have als o been taken to suggest that Agulhas leakage variability during MI S 11 was directly related to AMOC activity and wind forcing. Sit e 1085 shows evidence for strengthened leakage at the end of MIS 1 1 that may have contributed to renewed ice-sheet build-up and th e demise of warm conditions (Dickson et al., 2010).  

Recent reconstructions detailing the multicentennial- to millennial-timescale hydrographic variability in the Agulhas corridor hav e been published for the last glacial cycle $80\,\mathrm{\ka}$ to present; Cor e MD02-2594) (Dyez et al., 2014), the previous two glacial–interglacial climate cycles of MIS 8–5 (Core MD96-2080; 265–77 ka) (Marino et al., 2013), and upstream in the Agulhas Current for the las t glacial cycle (Core CD154 17-17K; Simon et al., 2013). These studie s confirm a connection of leakage maxima with glacial–interglacial climate transitions and extend the connections to millennial-scal e salinity anomalies that appear to systematically coincide with accelerated warming at the end of the North Atlantic cold phases (stadials).  These  findings  lend  credence  to  earlier  hypothetical considerations (Lutjeharms, 2006a) and numerical models (Knor r and Lohmann, 2003; Weijer et al., 2002; Biastoch et al., 2008) pointing to Indian-Atlantic salt leakage as an essential modulator o f abrupt climate change. However, reanalyses of a freshwater LG M hosing experiment using a fully coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (Gong et al., 2013) has been recently used to suggest that the millennial-scale salinity increases in the Agulhas corridor are consistent with the presence of a quasi-interhemispheri c salt seesaw. This salt seesaw is analogous to the thermal bipolar seesaw, responding to reduced cross-hemispheric heat and salt exchange during times of weakened AMOC (Simon et al., 2015a). Indeed, Simon et al. (2015a) suggest that although more upstrea m saline Agulhas water was propagated to the Indian-Atlantic Ocea n gateway during Heinrich Stadial 1, the salt flux into the South Atlantic Ocean, through the Indian-Atlantic Ocean gateway, durin g that time was actually reduced. Accordingly, intervals with highe r salinity in the Agulhas Current source region cannot necessarily b e taken to indicate increased salt exchange through the Indian-Atlantic Ocean gateway into the South Atlantic Ocean, again calling fo r further study.  

The combined analysis of these multiple proxies on the sam e sediments from Expedition 361 and the greater time interval available for study will help to elucidate the apparently contradictor y scenarios from individual studies.  

# Agulhas Current links with southern African climates and rainfall patterns  

Southern Africa spans a significant range of climatic and vegetation zones (Figure F7) from the low-latitude tropical regime that i s primarily under the influence of the Intertropical Convergenc e Zone (ITCZ) and Congo Air Boundary (CAB) to the high souther n latitudes that are influenced by the northern extensions of the circum-Antarctic westerly wind belt (Tyson, 1986; Chase and Meadows, 2007) (Figure F3). The ITCZ and CAB collectively form th e divide between easterly winds arriving from the Indian Ocean an d westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean (Leroux, 1983). Presently, the southernmost extent of the seasonal migrations of the ITCZ an d CAB is situated over the Zambezi Catchment during austral summer (December, January, and February [DJF]). The Zambezi Catchment is the largest riverine catchment in southeastern Africa, wit h headwaters extending far into the continental interior. Because o f the northern position of the African rainfall belt as well as the presence of mountain ranges of the East African Rift zone, annual rainfall amounts are higher across the Zambezi Catchment compared t o the neighboring Limpopo Catchment to the south. Although directly connected with the ITCZ, the convergence zone over tropical southern Africa is decoupled on occasion from the divide betwee n dry trade winds in the east and wet monsoon in the west, as occurring, for instance, over West Africa in summer. Rainfall intensity today in southeast Africa is correlated to SST variability in th e southwest Indian Ocean and the Agulhas Current system (Reaso n and Mulenga, 1999; Walker, 1990; Jury et al., 1993; Reason, 2002; Singleton and Reason, 2007). Additionally, the interannual variability of precipitation in the historical record of South Africa is antiphased with that of tropical East Africa (Goddard and Graham, 1999). It is apparent from modern observations that terrestrial precipitation records have very regional patterns, and thus understanding past variability requires records from a range of archives that span this variability.

Figure F7. Global land cover map of Africa (Mayaux et al., 2004).  

During the Late Pleistocene, shifts in African climate were paced by regional insolation changes driven by orbital precession (deMenocal et al., 1993). These orbital changes resulted in antiphased summer insolation maxima between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, driving an interhemispheric temperature contrast resulting in shifts of the ITCZ and leaving an imprint of the summer monsoonal rainfall (Kutzbach et al., 2008). Additionally, African climate was influenced by high-latitude forcing predominantly varying on longer obliquity and eccentricity timescales (Tuenter et al., 2003; Weber and Tuenter, 2011). Although in the lowlatitude tropics African climate is dominated by the influence of the ITCZ and associated rain belts, studies from central and eastern Africa document the increasing influence of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Castañeda et al., 2007; Schefuß et al., 2005; Tierney et al., 2008). Whereas longer term climate evolution of the African continent is documented by a variety of terrestrial and marine records, the history of the northeastern and southeastern tropical Africa (e.g., Schneider et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2002; Schefuß et al., 2005; Castañeda et al., 2007; Weldeab et al., 2007; Tierney et al., 2008, 2011; Ziegler et al., 2010; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2014) is better constrained than southern Africa. Southern African records are sparse, fragmented, and often suffer from a lack of robust age frameworks (e.g., Gasse et al., 2001; Partidge et al., 1997, 2004; Chase et al., 2007; Collins et al., 2014). Such information is important because variability is likely to have significantly influenced African biomes during the Pleistocene, and it appears that this has in turn affected the distributions of species as well as human demography (Scott et al., 2008).  

Lake Malawi, the southernmost of the East African Rift lakes in the southern tropics, provides the only available continuous continental climate record of the last $1.3\,\mathrm{My}$ in southern East Africa. Reconstruction of temperature (using the organic proxy $\mathrm{TEX}_{86}\mathrm{,}$ ) and aridity (using leaf wax $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C},$ ) has been used to suggest a variable and predominantly arid climate that has $40~\mathrm{ky}$ periodicity prior to 900 ka (the mid-Pleistocene transition [MPT]), shifting to a more humid environment after the MPT (Johnson et al., 2016). After the MPT, the record has strong $100~\mathrm{ky}$ periodicity, with warmer and wetter conditions in interglacial intervals and relatively cool and dry glacial intervals (Johnson et al., 2016). The inferred shift in climate conditions across the MPT is supported by additional sedimentological proxies that indicate lower lake levels prior to the MPT followed by higher amplitude lake level variability and overfilled lake conditions until ${\sim}100$ ka punctuated by intervals of short-lived extreme drought (Lyons et al., 2015). A similar story for the MPT is also found in the record of African $C_{4}$ plant abundance from ODP Site 1077 in the tropical South Atlantic Ocean, although this record does not exhibit the shift toward overall more humid conditions for the last ${\sim}900\,\mathrm{ky}$ (Schefuß et al., 2003).  

Millennial-scale climate variations are known from sediment cores off the Zambezi River, which drains into the Indian Ocean at ${\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . A $\delta\mathrm{{D}_{\mathrm{{leaf}\;\mathrm{{wax}}}}}$ record in sediment Core GeoB 9307-3 off the Zambezi River documents brief and distinctly wetter intervals that correlate with the Younger Dryas and Heinrich Stadial 1 (Schefuß et al., 2011). Together with BIT index (the relative abundances of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers [GDGTs] and the isoprenoid GDGT, crenarchaeol [Hopmans et al., $2004;$ Huguet et al., 2007]) and X-ray fluorescence data, this proxy record is taken to indicate that rainfall intensities and Zambezi sediment discharge increased because of a southward shift of the ITCZ during Northern Hemisphere cold events. However, in an apparent contradiction, the $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{leaf\,wax}}$ record of this core shows an increased abundance of drought-tolerant $C_{4}$ grasses during these inferred wet intervals. This discrepancy in $C_{3}{\mathrm{-}}C_{4}$ plants may be attributed to shifts in source areas within the Zambezi subcatchments, as inferred from magnetic mineral inventories (Just et al., 2014), presumably due to changes in the locus of rainfall.  

A more distal, deeper coring site ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{km}$ north of the Zambezi River mouth at ${\sim}1300\mathrm{\;m}$ water depth provides continuous sedimentary records spanning the last ${\sim}40\ \mathrm{ky}.$ . A high-resolution record of neodymium isotopes (εNd) in the lithogenic clay fraction from one of the cores (64PE304-80) is interpreted to reflect changes in Zambezi sediment discharge relative to sediment transported from more northern sources by the strong net southward eddy-induced flow through the Mozambique Channel (van der Lubbe et al., 2016). The reconstructed intervals of enhanced Zambezi discharge are in agreement with the δD rainfall record obtained from a parallel core (GIK16160-30; Wang et al., 2013) after correction for the $C_{3}–C_{4}$ vegetation abundances.  

Collectively, the evidence is consistent with the inference that the Zambezi Catchment experienced relatively wetter conditions during MIS 2 and the late Holocene, whereby Heinrich Stadial 1 and the Younger Dryas stand out as intervals of extreme wet conditions. More arid conditions occurred during MIS 3 and between ${\sim}15$ and $5\,\mathrm{ka}$ . The later interval is synchronous with the African Humid Period in northern Africa. Altogether, Zambezi Catchment records document precession-paced changes in the African monsoona l rainfall belt with enhanced rainfall during periods of increase d Southern Hemisphere summer insolation, superimposed by we t conditions during high-latitude Northern Hemisphere abrupt col d events.  

Farther south, a $342\ \mathrm{ky}$ pollen record from marine sedimen t Core MD96-2048 from $660~\mathrm{m}$ water depth ${\sim}120~\mathrm{km}$ south of th e Limpopo River mouth shows glacial–interglacial and precessioncorrelated climate variations in the extent of the subtropical biom e (Dupont et al., 2011). On land the sediment record from Tswain g Crater, a meteorite impact north of Pretoria, provides the longes t terrestrial record of climate variability in South Africa, spanning th e last $200\,\mathrm{ky}$ . Clastic particle size variations from Tswaing Crater hav e also been used to suggest that cyclic changes in precipitation wer e linked with the long-term effect of regional insolation change s driven by orbital precession (Partridge, et al., 1997, 2004).  

Marine sediment Core CD154-10-06P located off the east coas t of subtropical South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), reveals shifts i n river runoff at the southeast African margin spanning the past 27 0 ky that also strongly follow orbital precession pacing (Figure F8). Xray fluorescence elemental data from Simon et al. (2015b) show humid phases that can be plausibly correlated with millennial-scal e Northern Hemisphere cold events. These excursions extend thos e recently identified in similar data from Core CD154-17-17K, a littl e farther south, that were linked to periods of early modern huma n innovation during the middle Stone Age (Ziegler et al., 2013). Som e of the millennial-scale events recorded in the eastern South Afric a runoff records are coincident with periods of enhanced dune activity and mobility in the Kalahari and Namib Deserts and are thu s consistent with the suggestion of shifted rainfall patterns and win d regimes (Stokes et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 2000; Stuut et al., 2002). Broadly, the conclusion drawn from the data is that past continenta l climate changes in southern Africa were linked with changes i n ocean and atmospheric circulation that in turn varied due to precession of Earth’s orbit. In some cases the changes were inferred to b e associated with shifts of the ITCZ, and in other cases migration o f the Antarctic Circumpolar Ocean fronts and/or the Souther n Hemisphere mid-latitude westerly wind belt was likely influential.  

A particularly intriguing feature of records from both stalagmites in coastal caves in South Africa (Bar-Matthews et al., 2010 ) and marine sediment cores at the southeast African continenta l margin (Schefuß et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Ziegler et al., 2013; Just et al., 2014; van der Lubbe et al., 2014, 2016; Weldeab et al., 2014; Simon et al., 2015b) is the indication of recurrent but spatiall y variable millennial oscillations of rainfall patterns. Such variabilit y demands highly resolved spatial and temporal records as well as numerical simulations.  

Precession-only sensitivity experiments using a high-resolution, fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model (altering the seasonal an d latitudinal distribution of solar insolation) show that during precession maxima (Pmax) higher Southern Hemisphere summer (DJF ) insolation causes higher temperatures and lower surface pressur e over the Southern Hemisphere, especially over land (Figure F9). Specifically, lower pressure during Pmax over South Africa an d higher surface pressure over the southern Indian Ocean results i n stronger easterly surface winds blowing toward eastern South Africa (Figure F9). Over land, convection also increases, resulting i n greater precipitation and greater net precipitation (precipitatio n minus evaporation) over nearly all of southern Africa during Pmax. The enhanced precipitation during Pmax and associated higher surface runoff is particularly pronounced in the KZN and Eastern Cap e

province region, compared to other regions further north or west, which may explain the considerable spatial variability observed i n different core sites adjacent to land in the southwest Indian Ocean.  

# Density profile of the LGM ocean  

The circulation of the deep ocean at the LGM is a crucial piec e of the puzzle to understand past variations in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and glacial–interglacial cycles more generally. Although the distribution of sedimentary deep-ocean circulation tracers $\delta^{13}C$ , $\mathrm{Cd}/\mathrm{Ca}$ , εNd, an d $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O})$ indicate that LGM ocean circulation was likely different tha n that of the modern ocean (e.g., Rutberg et al., 2000; Piotrowski et al., 2004, 2005; Marchal and Curry, 2008; Lund et al., 2011) the distri

butions of these properties are inconclusive enough that they ma y also be consistent with modern circulation and differences in surface  forcing  (e.g.,  Gebbie,  2012;  Gebbie  and  Huybers,  2006; LeGrand and Wunsch, 1995). Thus, to understand the role of th e deep ocean in ice age climate variability, we require a more robus t assessment of ice age deep-ocean variability, using a suite of tracer s characterized by wide-ranging sensitivity to surface forcing.  

In the modern ocean, we use the pattern of temperature and salinity to map the distribution of deep-water masses. In addition, these values inform the balance of sea-atmosphere exchange (i.e., precipitation, evaporation, heat exchange) processes that are required to create the negative buoyancy to form deep water; they ar e an integrated record of climate at high latitudes. It would be ideal t o use the same strategy for the ice age ocean. However, there are fe w available means to develop a full temperature-salinity plot for th e LGM. Schrag and DePaolo (1993) and Schrag et al. (1996, 2002) pioneered a strategy for quantifying the $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of seawater by samplin g a profile of interstitial waters from deep-ocean sediment from IOD P sites, making highly precise measurements of $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and applying diffusion models to estimate the value of LGM seawater. This strateg y has been expanded to include $\left[{\mathrm{Cl-}}\right]$ , thus allowing an estimate of salinity (Adkins et al., 2002; Adkins, 2013; Miller et al., 2015). Wit h local $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ data from benthic foraminifers, interstitial water information from a coring site can be turned into a single point on th e LGM temperature-salinity diagram. The current version of thi s plot, from sampling IODP material, contains only five pairs o f points (Figure F10) (Adkins et al., 2002). The relative scarcity of th e observations stems from the requirements of the approach: sediment must be drilled to $>\!150\,\mathrm{m}$ below seafloor to properly measur e and model the diffusion profile; a well-behaved sediment column, free of complicated fluid flow and diagenesis, must be sampled; an d an entire hole must be dedicated to the pursuit. Nevertheless, despite the stringent requirements this approach is currently the mos t direct way to estimate temperature and salinity of the ice age dee p ocean.  

Although sparse, the existing data imply that there were largerthan-modern density differences between deep-ocean water masse s at the LGM, and most of the ocean was close to the freezing poin t and therefore differences in density were due primarily to salinit y (see also discussion in Miller et al., 2012). Most surprisingly, the sal t gradient in the modern Atlantic Ocean, consisting of fresh southern-sourced waters and salty northern-sourced waters appears t o have been reversed at the LGM. This suggests the saltiest waters o f the LGM ocean originated in the Southern Hemisphere, althoug h this inference is based on a single site (IODP Site 1093). Adkins et al. (2002) concluded that Glacial Southern Source Bottom Water wa s the densest water mass due to its high salinity. Enhanced densit y differences between northern- and southern-sourced bottom waters imply greater vertical stratification. A stronger vertical stratification would help explain indications that there was a physicall y isolated reservoir of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the deep ocean at the LGM (Broecke r and Barker, 2007). In the years since the original work, analytical measurement of $\left[{{\bf{C}}{\bf{l}}-}\right]$ has been improved, several new samplin g strategies have targeted increasing throughput, and the data analysis tools used to model the data have been improved. The next mos t important step in constraining the temperature, salinity, and densit y

structure of the LGM deep ocean is to obtain depth transects o f these properties and just generally more data from different parts o f the ocean. To this end, samples taken during Expedition 361 site s ranging from 450 to $3040~\mathrm{m}$ water depth will be used to help constrain the processes that could have filled the LGM deep ocean an d controlled its circulation.  

# Objectives  

Expedition 361 Pliocene–Pleistocene objectives include the following:  

• To establish the sensitivity of the Agulhas Current to changing climates of the Pliocene–Pleistocene in association with transient to long-term changes of high-latitude climates, ocean gateways, tropical heat budgets, and the monsoon system;  

• To determine the dynamics of the Indian-Atlantic Ocean gateway circulation during such climate changes in association with changing wind fields and migrating ocean fronts; • To examine the connection between Agulhas leakage and ensuing buoyancy transfer and shifts of the AMOC during major ocean and climate reorganizations during at least the last 5 My; and • To address the impact of Agulhas variability on southern Africa terrestrial climates and notably rainfall patterns and river runoff.  

Specific scientific objectives include the following:  

• To determine the variability of the greater Agulhas Current system under contrasting climatic regimes: Agulhas Current variability under early Pliocene warm conditions, during the midPliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and through the MPT;   
• To establish the role of Agulhas leakage in transient and longterm shifts of the AMOC during these climatic transitions: proxy records of mode/strength of the Agulhas leakage during periods of major climatic reorganizations and for AMOC variations through the same intervals;   
• To establish the response of the Agulhas Current system to Antarctic climate variability and bipolar linkages: evidence for variation of the Agulhas leakage in highly resolved temporal records will be compared to Antarctic and bipolar climate changes, as well as with evidence for shifts of Southern Ocean fronts bordering the Agulhas corridor at the southern tip of Africa, and position and strength of the westerlies;   
• To understand the remote tropical origins of Agulhas Current variability: evidence for variation of the Agulhas leakage in highly resolved temporal records will be compared to records of Indonesian Throughflow and monsoon modulation on the Agulhas Current source region and impacts on warm and saltwater transports along the southeast African margin and IndianAtlantic saltwater leakage;   
• To better determine southern African climate sensitivity: comparison of varying Agulhas Current warm-water transports with rainfall patterns in southern Africa, in connection with the Pliocene–Pleistocene evolution of tropical climates, ITCZ migration, and tectonic history of eastern Africa; and   
• To provide further verification of glacial–interglacial variations in the Southern Ocean’s role in the carbon cycle: nutrient cycling, productivity, and $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ and their role in regional and global biogeochemical cycles.  

Additionally, Expedition 361 will complete an intensive interstitial fluids program aimed at constraining the temperature, salinity, and density structure of the LGM deep ocean, from the bottom o f the ocean to the base of the main thermocline. High-resolution interstitial water samples will be utilized for $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and chloride measurements to characterize the salinity of the bottom water and t o deconvolve the temperature and ice volume control on $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of benthic foraminifers.  

# Principal results Site U1474  

Site  U1474  is  located  in  the  northernmost  Natal  Valle y $(31^{\circ}13.00^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ ; $31^{\circ}32.71^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ) ${\sim}88~\mathrm{nmi}$ south-southeast of Durban, Sout h Africa, in a water depth of $3034\;\mathrm{m}$ below sea level (mbsl). The Natal Valley is a sediment-filled basin between the coast of southeast Africa and Mozambique Ridge. At its northern end, the shoaling valle y passes into the extensive coastal plains of southern Mozambiqu e (Dingle et al., 1978; Goodlad, 1986), whereas toward the south th e deepening Natal Valley merges with Transkei Basin below 450 0 mbsl. Terrigenous sediment supply into the basin is dominated b y seasonal discharge from the numerous short but fast-flowing river s that characterize the drainage system of the Natal coast (e.g., th e Tugela River), as well as contributions from the Limpopo River an d possibly the Zambezi River. Surface sediment dispersal is strongl y affected by the ${\sim}100~\mathrm{km}$ wide Agulhas Current flowing southwar d close to the continental shelf edge and transporting ${\sim}70$ Sv at $32^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Beal and Bryden, 1999) with surface velocities up to $1.5~\mathrm{m/s}$ . A t depth, the northward-flowing Agulhas Undercurrent hugs the continental slope, presently transporting NADW. The currents relate d to this northward flow have led to the formation of a network o f elongate, north-south–orientated sediment drifts.  

According to Lutjeharms (2006a), the Agulhas Current is full y constituted at ${\sim}26^{\circ}\mathrm{S}_{:}$ , around Ponta do Ouro, close to the border between Mozambique and South Africa. Here, the East Madagasca r Current converges with Mozambique Channel throughflow to for m the Agulhas Current. The northern section of the Agulhas Curren t system, overlying Site U1474, is extraordinarily stable due to th e steep, nearly rectilinear continental shelf that topographically steer s the current flow southward (de Ruijter et al., $1999\mathrm{a}$ ; Lutjeharms, 2006a, 2007).  

Several high-resolution orbital- to millennial-timescale record s from shallow-penetration marine sediment cores located near Sit e U1474 (Ziegler et al., 2013; Simon et al., 2013, 2015a, 2015b) hav e provided multiproxy reconstruction of hydrographic variabilit y within the main flow of the Agulhas Current as well as river discharge from the catchments of the Natal coast over the past $250\;\mathrm{ky}.$ . In particular, Simon et al. (2013) demonstrated a strong correspondence between upstream Agulhas Current hydrographic variabilit y and that of the Agulhas leakage corridor (deduced from foraminiferal proxies for temperature, salinity, and Agulhas leakage.) Thi s system can be plausibly linked to the influence of recirculatio n within the southwest Indian Ocean subgyre, as predicted fro m physical oceanography (e.g., Gordon, 1985; Stramma and Lutjeharms, 1997). Additionally, it has been shown that changes in terrestrial climate (hydroclimate) are related to regional precessionpaced insolation changes and the effects associated with high-latitude abrupt climate forcing (Simon et al., 2015b). When considere d in combination with archaeological records, these records appear t o suggest links between climate and human settlement in South Africa during the middle Stone Age (Ziegler et al., 2013).  

Our primary objective was to recover a key Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary succession, including the early Pliocene warm period, mid-Pliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and the MPT, formed under the influence of the upper reaches o f the Agulhas Current. Site U1474 is ideally located to provide  

• A reconstruction of Agulhas Current warm-water transports close to the start of the fully constituted Agulhas Current; • An upstream record that may allow discerning connections between Agulhas leakage and its headwater variability; • Evidence to understand the connections between southern African terrestrial climates and southeast Indian Ocean heat budgets, notably Agulhas Current warm-water transports and associated ocean-atmosphere heat and moisture transfer; • A record of the vigor and hydrography of NADW (or its precursors) transported to the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and the southwest Indian Ocean; and • An interstitial water profile of $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and chloride ion concentration that can enhance the understanding of temperature, salinity, and density of the deep water bathing Site U1474 by providing an additional data point to the presently available pore water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Site U1474 consists of eight holes ranging in penetration dept h from 3.1 to $254.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF). Overall, 111 cores were recovered at this site. The advanced piston corin g (APC) system penetrated $794.0\ \mathrm{m}$ and recovered $809.79\mathrm{~m~}$ of cor e ( $102\%$ recovery). The half-length APC (HLAPC) system penetrate d $102.4~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $100.96\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $99\%$ recovery). A total o f $910.75\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment was recovered from the $896.4\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interva l cored ( $102\%$ recovery) at Site U1474. The total time spent at Sit e U1474 was 7.6 days (Table T1).  

# Sedimentology  

The sediment at Site U1474 consists of one lithologic unit. Uni t I $(0{-}254.07\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A) a brown (uppermost ${\sim}0.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) an d greenish gray (deeper than $0.5\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ) foraminifer-bearing cla y with nannofossils alternating with intervals of greenish gray nannofossil-rich clay with or without foraminifers. Nannofossil-rich cla y is more common downhole. Dark gray foraminifer-bearing finesand layers are common (typically 1–3 per core) and range in thickness from a few centimeters to $\sim\!2\textrm{m}$ (most are a few centimeter s thick). The composition of these sandy layers is predominantl y quartz with carbonate, and many have erosional bases. Sediment includes dark gray mottling that we interpret as bioturbation. The relative intensity of the bioturbation typically increases with dept h throughout. Sediment at Site U1474 also includes millimeter- t o centimeter-scale green layers that contain pyrite and glauconit e based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) and smear slide observations. These layers represent diagenetic alterations.  

Significant drilling disturbance was observed in the first sectio n of most of the cores and in the base of partial-stroke APC cores.  

# Physical properties  

Despite the relatively homogeneous lithology, physical parameters vary along the entire sequence. Porosity increases with dept h from 0 to $12.8\textrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF-A), reaching a maximum of $72\%$ followed by a decrease to ${<}50\%$ at th e bottom of the cored section. This decreasing trend toward the bottom is likely due to compaction. Variations in gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density reflect the same compaction pattern. Natural gamma radiation (NGR) and magnetic susceptibility markedly decrease in the upper $10\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ and increase to $130\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. Below $130\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A, NGR and magnetic susceptibility values decrease to the base of the section. This decreasing trend occurs i n spite of compaction and thus likely reflects decreasing abundance s of clay and magnetic minerals within the sediment. Superimpose d on the general trends are cyclic variations in NGR of typically $\mathord{\sim}10-$ 15 counts/s, which may be related to the variable mixtures of terrigenous and biogenic sediment components. Fine-sand layers foun d throughout the cored section are clearly identified by peaks in magnetic susceptibility and GRA density values. Spectral reflectanc e shows a marked cyclic pattern downhole and broadly correspond s with the trends in color spectrometry values.  

# Micropaleontology  

Analysis of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and diatoms from core catcher and split-core sample s from Hole U1474A indicates that Site U1474 spans the Late Pleistocene to the latest Miocene $\left({\sim}6.2\,M\mathbf{a}\right)$ . Calcareous microfossils sho w good to moderate preservation in the upper $180\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A of th e site. Below this depth, preservation and fossil group abundances decrease. A complete sequence of calcareous nannofossil zones wa s found from the late Miocene (Biozones NN11–NN21) to Late Pleistocene. Evidence for reworking of calcareous nannofossils is foun d throughout the entire sequence, marked by the persistent presenc e of early Miocene species. The calcareous nannofossil assemblage s are typical of tropical to subtropical settings, although the temperate species, Coccolithus pelagicus, is found throughout the cored interval. Planktonic foraminifers also record a complete sequence o f tropical biozones that span Miocene Biozone M13 to Late Pleistocene Subzone Pt1b. The planktonic foraminifer fauna is dominate d by Globorotalia inflata, which is indicative of transitional environments between subtropical and polar water masses, and in deepe r parts of the sequence the assemblage contains elements of the globoconellid group that are typical of subtropical convergence zones. Benthic foraminifer fauna is diverse and includes numerous suboxi c components characteristic of a lower bathyal to abyssal environment. Siliceous microfossils are characteristic of a modern India n Ocean assemblage and make up a minor component of the mudlin e sample. Below the mudline sample, sponge spicules are rare to trac e until they disappear completely below Sample 361-U1474A-10HCC ( $90.19\mathrm{\,m\,CSF{-}A}\mathrm{)}$ ) and other siliceous fossils are not found.

The age model for Site U1474 is based on the biozonation of calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifers. These data revea l that the recovered sedimentary sequence is free of hiatuses and tha t sedimentation rates are nearly constant throughout the recovere d sequence (estimated to be ${\sim}3.7~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ ). Near the bottom there appears to be a higher accumulation rate, but more shore-based wor k will be required to refine the age model.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses were carried out o n sediment cores from Holes U1474A–U1474H. Analyses of discret e samples taken from Hole U1474A indicate that the magnetic mineralogy is dominated by magnetite. The relatively high saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) and high and stable Sratios further reveal that magnetic minerals are well preserve d throughout the sequence. Below ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, an increase o f magnetic minerals is expressed by high SIRM. Inclination and declination records were obtained by measuring and demagnetizing th e natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archive core halves an d discrete samples. The majority of the APC cores were oriented using the Icefield MI-5 tool. The inclination record is of good quality, and nine polarity zones can be identified. The boundaries of th e Brunhes, Matuyama, Jaramillo, Olduvai, Gauss, Gilbert, C3n, an d C3r (sub)paleomagnetic chrons constrain the chronology of th e sediment and are in good agreement with the biostratigraphic data.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Continuous and distinctive variations in magnetic susceptibilit y were  used  to  make  hole-to-hole  correlations  among  Hole s U1474A–U1474F. Confidence in these correlations is high becaus e they can be cross-checked with continuous downcore measurements of color reflectance parameter $L^{\ast}$ and NGR. A complete affine table to the base of Hole U1474A was constructed to provid e tabulated offsets for all cores relative to core depths (CSF-A). A continuous splice was constructed downhole to $234\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-D usin g cores from Holes U1474D–U1474F where possible. For some intervals, it was necessary to use sections from Hole U1474A, but sequences in which whole-round samples had been removed wer e avoided. All sections of disturbed sediment were also avoided fo r construction of the splice. The continuity of the splice was confirmed with magnetic susceptibility, GRA density, NGR, and reflectance. Core intervals not included in the splice may be correlated t o the CCSF-D depth scale using within-core variations of these data.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry shows a moderate degree of earl y sediment diagenesis at Site U1474. Profiles of Mn and Fe indicat e suboxic conditions from the seafloor to $5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Sulfate reduction occurs throughout much of the sediment column. The overal l low organic carbon content, on average ${<}0.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , does not suppor t complete removal of sulfate by $250\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and methane concentrations remain at background levels. Carbonate content of the pelagic sediment is moderate, averaging $40\,\mathrm{\,\,wt\%}$ . The sandy layer s contain significantly less carbonate than the nannofossil-rich clays, with values ranging between 20 and $30\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Profiles of conservativ e elements (K and Mg) downhole suggest either fluid flow or cla y mineral alteration reactions at depths below $250\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Site U1475  

Site U1475 is located on the southwestern flank of Agulhas Plateau $\mathrm{(41^{\circ}25.61^{\prime}S}$ ; $25^{\circ}15.64^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ ) ${\sim}450\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ south of Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in a water depth of 2669 mbsl. The Agulhas Plateau, which was formed during the early stages of the opening of th e South Atlantic at ${\sim}90\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Parsiegla et al., 2008), is a major bathymetric high that is variably coated with sediment (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001). The $230,\!000{\mathrm{~km}}^{2}$ plateau, which ascends to ${\sim}2500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the adjacent seafloor, is bounded on the north by the $4700\;\mathrm{m}$ deep Agulhas Passage and is flanked by Agulhas Basin in the wes t and Transkei Basin in the northeast. The northern part of the plateau is characterized by rugged topography, whereas the central an d southern parts of the plateau exhibit relatively smooth topograph y (Allen and Tucholke, 1981) and have greater sediment thicknes s (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001).  

A strong flow of deep water passes over the Agulhas Plateau region (Macdonald, 1993), which involves the water column from th e surface downward to the upper CDW. The hydrography of the upper ocean is dominated by the ARC, which comprises the component of the Agulhas Current that is not leaked to the South Atlanti c Ocean but rather flows eastward from the Agulhas Retroflectio n (Lutjeharms and Ansorge, 2001). Antarctic Intermediate Water, below the ARC, also follows the same flow path near South Africa a s the Agulhas Current and shows a similar retroflection (Lutjeharms, 1996). During its return to the southwest Indian Ocean, the AR C crosses the Agulhas Plateau, which deflects the deep-reaching current toward the Equator (Harris, 1970).  

Site survey data collected during seismic cruises with the R/ V Petr Kottsov in 1998 (Uenzelmann-Neben, 1998) and the R/V Marion Dufresne in 2002 show that Site U1475 is located on a sedimen t drift (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001, 2002) that is deposited on th e southwestern flank of Agulhas Plateau by NADW exiting the Sout h Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean. The wedge-shaped sedimen t drift thickens to the west, reaching a water depth of ${\sim}2510\ \mathrm{m}$ at it s crest. The wavy character of the seafloor topography and the subsurface seismic reflection pattern are interpreted as sediment wave s that document sedimentation by active deep-water flow. Site U147 5 is located at 2669 mbsl, near the drift crest where minor buried depressions create a locally expanded sequence.  

Millennial-scale multiproxy records covering the past $350\,\mathrm{~ky}$ previously collected at this location highlight the synchrony of th e regional ocean climatology and Antarctic climate variability. Evidence for regional ocean paleoclimatology includes latitudinal migrations of the Southern Ocean fronts and deposition of ice-rafte d debris that document expansion of sub-Antarctic conditions to th e plateau. These data serve as evidence for possible meridional shift s in the subantarctic frontal zone that borders the Agulhas leakag e corridor and likely influences Agulhas leakage.  

Paleoceanographic studies spanning the past $350~\mathrm{ky}$ combine d with seismic reflection data support the suitability of Site U1475 t o achieve our primary objectives, which are to  

• Recover a complete Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary succession from a high-accumulation sediment drift located within the southern ARC sector of the Indian-Atlantic Ocean gateway;   
• Assess the linking between Antarctic climate variations, circumpolar ocean front instability, and connections with Agulhas leakage into the South Atlantic Ocean;   
• Assess the vigor and hydrography of NADW (or its precursors) exported to CDW and the southwest Indian Ocean at a location proximal to the entrance of NADW to the Southern Ocean and South Indian Ocean; and   
• Evaluate the possibility of advective salinity feedbacks between Agulhas Leakage and AMOC variability, particularly the possible role of the Agulhas Leakage in modulating surface-to-deep ocean coupling in the North Atlantic during the transition between climatic states.  

Site U1475 consists of six holes that range in depth from 1.5 t o $277.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF. The APC system cored a total of $987.9\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $1015.92\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $103\%$ core recovery). Six intervals advance d without coring to provide a continuous stratigraphic sequence penetrated a total of $86.0~\mathrm{m}$ . The total time spent at Site U1475 was 5. 7 days (Table T1).  

# Sedimentology  

The sediment recovered at Site U1475 consists of two lithologi c units. Unit I $(0{-}4.75\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ is composed of pale brown, ligh t greenish or olive-gray, and white-gray nannofossil-rich foraminife r ooze. Unit II $(4.75{-}277.22\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ is composed of light greenis h or pale gray to white-gray nannofossil ooze. Alternations betwee n foraminifer-bearing  or  foraminifer-rich  nannofossil  ooze  an d nannofossil ooze with fine sand (foraminifers, quartz, and occasionally diatoms) were observed.  

Sediment in both units includes dark gray mottling that we interpret as bioturbation (ichnofossil burrows [Planolites]). Thi n darker bands commonly surround burrows, and macroscopic pyritized burrows are also common. Dropstones displaying coarse san d to granule grain sizes were observed in three different cores, whic h we interpret to represent ice-rafted debris. Sediment in both unit s also includes green layers that predominantly consist of pyrite an d glauconite representing diagenetic alteration.  

# Physical properties  

Despite the homogeneous lithology, physical parameters sho w downhole trends as well as cyclic variations. A marked change i n physical sediment properties occurs at ${\sim}110\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Above thi s depth, a change from quasi-regular short and lower amplitude variations to longer, higher amplitude, and more irregular cyclic variation is observed. This change is most clearly displayed in NGR an d color reflectance $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\right)$ data. In addition, $P$ -wave velocities decreas e and bulk densities increase at this depth, following a compactio n trend. Prominent changes in $P$ -wave velocity at Site U1475 can b e clearly linked to seismic reflectors present in the site survey profiles.  

# Micropaleontology  

Analysis of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and diatoms from core catchers and working-half core sample s from Holes U1475B, U1475C, and U1475E reveals that the ${\sim}277\mathrm{~m~}$ section recovered at Site U1475 spans the latest Miocene $({\sim}6.91\$ Ma) to recent. Calcareous nannofossils show moderate to goo d preservation in all sequences with the consistent presence of wellpreserved Eocene to middle Miocene (reworked) species. Th e nannofossil chronostratigraphy at Site U1475 spans from Biozone s NN21 to NN11 and CN15 to the Subzone CN9d/CN9c boundary. Calcareous nannofossil assemblages are characterized by specie s typical of tropical to subtropical and temperate environments. Planktonic foraminifer biota at Site U1475 are moderately to wel l preserved and are mostly composed of subtropical convergenc e species mixed with polar species. The Pleistocene foraminifer assemblage is dominated by G. inflata, which typically constitute s $30\%{-}50\%$ of each sample. Diatoms show poor to moderate preservation and have a mixed assemblage of subtropical and Souther n Ocean taxa. Diatom markers from both environmental settings ar e used to define datums; however, the Southern Ocean assemblag e abundance is greatly reduced below $101.62\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Overall, th e diatom chronostratigraphy spans from Biozone NTD17 to NTD12.  

Sedimentation rates at Site U1475, based on biostratigraphy an d paleomagnetic reversals during the Pleistocene and latest Pliocen e are nearly linear at $2.8\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ between 0 and $3.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . A significantl y higher sedimentation rate of $9.6\;\mathrm{{cm/ky}}$ occurs between 3.9 and 5. 3 Ma. Finally, older than $5.3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , sedimentation rates is again lowe r and is ${\sim}2.5\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

All archive halves from Holes U1475B, U1475C, and U1475 F and Cores 361-U1475E-1H through 15H were analyzed for NR M and demagnetized at 15 and $25~\mathrm{mT}$ . In total, 98 discrete cube samples were taken from Holes U1475A, U1475B, and U1475D an d subjected to NRM demagnetization. Cores from Site U1475 wer e not oriented because the relatively high latitude of the site implie s that inclination data provide a reliable record of magnetic reversals. For most of the recovered interval, magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that the sediment is diamagnetic in characte r and many readings are below the detection limit of the whole-roun d and point magnetic susceptibility instruments. Nonetheless, take n together, the inclination records of all individual holes provide  a consistent and detailed magnetostratigraphy for Site U1475. Th e boundaries of the Brunhes, Matuyama, Jaramillo, Olduvai, Gauss, Kaena, and Mammoth paleomagnetic chrons and subchrons constrain the chronology of the sediment and are in general agreemen t with the biostratigraphic data.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Select sequences from Holes U1475B, U1475C, U1475E, an d U1475F were spliced together to create the most complete and representative section possible using RGB blue, $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color reflectance, and NGR data. Sedimentological logs were consulted meticulousl y in the process of constructing the splice to avoid inclusion of an y obviously disturbed sections or sections with completely uniqu e features (relative to the other adjacent holes). The splice constitute s a continuous sequence with a total length of ${\sim}292\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-D. However, confidence in the splice is low surrounding occasional problematic intervals, and further work on shore will be required t o improve confidence.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry shows a moderate degree of earl y sediment diagenesis at Site U1475. The nitrate profile indicates suboxic conditions in the upper $0.25\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Sulfate concentration s decrease throughout the sediment column, and sulfate is neve r completely consumed. Methane concentrations remain at background levels. Carbonate is the dominant sedimentary component, ranging from 75 to $85~\mathrm{wt\%},$ with terrigenous material dominatin g the remaining fraction. Organic carbon contents range from 0.3 t o $0.6\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , decreasing slightly downhole. Together, carbonate, organi c carbon, and elemental biogenic indicator profiles suggest that export production increased into the Late Pleistocene.  

# Site U1476  

Site U1476 is located on Davie Ridge at the northern entrance o f the Mozambique Channel $\left\langle15^{\circ}49.25^{\prime}\mathrm{S};\right.$ ; $41^{\circ}46.12^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ ) at a water dept h of $2165\;\mathrm{mbsl.}$ It is $3\,\mathrm{nmi}$ northwest of DSDP Site 242.  

The Mozambique Channel is considered to be one of the mos t turbulent areas in the world ocean (Ternon et al., 2014), bordered b y Madagascar to the east and Mozambique to the west. At its southern end, flow through the channel feeds into the greater Agulha s Current system. The Mozambique Channel is characterized b y complex and variable surface and subsurface circulation. Several water masses converge within the Mozambique Channel, and th e circulation is dominated by activity related to the inflow of both Indonesian Throughflow and Tasman Strait Throughflow as well a s the strength of the tropical and subtropical surface gyres in the Indian Ocean (Palastanga et al., 2006; Penven et al., 2006; Schott et al., 2009; Backeberg and Reason, 2010; Ridderinkhof et al., 2010). Satellite observations (e.g., Schouten et al., 2003; Quartly and Srokosz, 2004) and ocean models (Biastoch and Krauss, 1999) have show n that mesoscale anticyclonic eddies generally form as the channel narrows close to Davie Ridge (at about $16^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ), between the norther n and central basin of the Mozambique Channel. These eddies typically maintain a high rotational velocity, often ${>}1.5\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ (Schouten e t al., 2003; Ullgren et al., 2012) as they migrate southward through th e channel at a mean rate of ${\sim}4{-}7$ eddies per year. Accordingly, processes in the Mozambique Channel have downstream implication s for the Agulhas Current including leakage into the South Atlanti c Ocean (e.g., Bryden et al., 2005; Biastoch et al., 2008, 2009b). Mozambique Channel eddies may also be linked with interannual modes of Indian and Pacific Ocean variability, implying a connection with the Indian Ocean Dipole and Pacific Ocean La Niña/El Niño phases (Schouten et al., $2002{\mathrm{a}}$ ; Palastanga et al., 2006).  

Limited paleoceanographic evidence currently exists to document the longer term linkage between variability in the norther n source waters of the Agulhas Current and its eventual leakage int o the South Atlantic Ocean. The primary objectives at Site U1476 ar e to  

• Recover a complete Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary succession including the early Pliocene warm period, the mid-Pliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and the MPT;  

• Reconstruct Mozambique Current warm-water transports during periods of orbitally modulated and suborbitally accelerated climate changes; and   
• Assess the influence of remote upstream forcing on southeast African warm-water transport.  

Specific questions that will be addressed include Did the restriction of the Indonesian Seaway and the associated change of the Indonesian Throughflow in the Pliocene affect the Agulhas Curren t source region in the western tropical Indian Ocean and subsequently impact warm-water and saltwater transports along th e southeast African margin? Did the Agulhas Current respond to th e long-term development of tropical climates and the associate d weakening of the monsoons in the course of the global cooling o f the Pliocene?  

Site U1476 consists of five holes that penetrated from 5.7 t o $234.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The APC system penetrated a total of $841.1\mathrm{~m~}$ an d recovered $873.83\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(104\%)$ . One interval was advanced 1. 0 m without coring to adjust coring gaps to provide a continuou s stratigraphic sequence. The total time spent at Site U1476 was 4. 1 days (Table T1).  

# Sedimentology  

Two lithologic units were described at Site U1476. Unit I $\left(0-\right.$ $34.57\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) is composed of light brown to greenish gray foraminifer ooze with nannofossils alternating with foraminifer-ric h nannofossil ooze. Unit II (34.57–235.41 m CSF-A) is composed o f greenish gray foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze and nannofossi l ooze with foraminifers, silt, and clay.  

Sediment in both units includes dark gray mottling that we interpret as bioturbation. Thin darker bands commonly surroun d burrows, and macroscopic pyritized burrows are common. Sediment also includes green layers that predominantly consist of pyrit e and glauconite, which are diagenetic alterations. Only minor corin g disturbance is observed in the cores.  

# Physical properties  

Despite the relatively homogeneous lithology, different physica l parameters show significant trends downhole as well as cyclic variations along the sediment column. High-amplitude cyclic change s occur in the uppermost $^{16\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ CSF-A of all holes. These cycli c changes continue downward to the bottom of the holes with lowe r amplitude and higher frequency. Variations in color reflectance indicate sediment compositional changes and RGB data broadly correspond  with  color  reflectance  parameter $L^{\ast}$ .  Bulk  densitie s increase downhole due to compaction, but there are large variation s in the uppermost $16\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A that are also seen in the other physical properties.  

# Micropaleontology  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicates that Hole U1476A spans the Late Pleistocene t o late Miocene. Diatoms are barren throughout the section except fo r tropical diatoms present in minor amounts in the mudline sample. Calcareous microfossils show very good preservation in Pliocene - to Pleistocene-age sediment; however, the late Miocene samples ar e characterized by an increase of fragmented planktonic foraminifers. Assemblages in both microfossil groups include tropical to subtropical forms with the periodic appearance of species typical of temperate environments. Sedimentation rates, based on calcareou s nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer datums, increase from 2.3 t o $3.5\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ downhole. No hiatuses were observed; however, event s that are seemingly diachronous were observed within the planktonic foraminifer biochronology. These events might suggest tha t calibration of microfossil datums from the tropical western India n Ocean need refinement.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses were carried out o n sediment  cores  from  Holes  U1476A,  U1476B,  U1476D,  an d U1476E. All together, the rock magnetic data imply that the concentration of  high-coercivity minerals (e.g., hematite and titanomagnetite) is relatively stable, whereas magnetite concentration s decrease below $\mathord{\sim}150\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Demagnetization of NRM carrie d out on discrete samples and archive halves shows that the directional record carries a strong coring overprint. The uppermost tw o sections of each core reveal steep downward inclinations after demagnetization at maximum levels of $25~\mathrm{mT}$ , suggesting that the applied field was too weak to remove the overprint. More detaile d demagnetization experiments on discrete samples show changes i n inclination after demagnetization of $40~\mathrm{mT},$ suggesting that sediment has an early diagenetic overprint that might be removed b y demagnetization at higher fields. Because the Icefield MI-5 orientation tool malfunctioned, the declination data could not be correcte d for core orientation and can therefore not be used for assigning polarity zones. A more detailed investigation of demagnetization behavior will be needed to establish a more confident paleomagneti c stratigraphy for Site U1476.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Ideal coring conditions and good signal in the magnetic susceptibility measurements allowed for near–real time correlation at Sit e U1476. Coring offsets were applied in Holes U1476A and U1476 D so that no gaps were present downhole to the full depth of the hole s $\mathrm{229.0\,\m}$ CSF-A). Hole U1476E provided similar offsets to Hol e U1476A so that a splice could be constructed primarily betwee n Holes U1476D and U1476E. The splice was constructed using magnetic susceptibility data and confirmed using NGR and RGB (blue ) data.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry shows mild early sediment diagenesis at Site U1476. Nitrate and sulfate, two species that disappea r with  progressively  more  intense  microbial  respiration,  persis t deeper into the sediment column and at higher concentrations tha n was documented at Sites U1474 or U1475. Methane concentration s remain at or near background levels. Decreasing concentrations o f major elements, such as potassium and sodium, reflect uptake b y clay minerals. Carbonate is variable $(45\mathrm{-}75\mathrm{\wt\%})$ , with terrigenou s sediment making up the remainder of the sediment. The sedimen t is organic carbon poor, with average concentrations of $0.24\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ total organic carbon (TOC).  

# Site U1477  

Site U1477 is located in the western Mozambique Channel o n the upper continental slope $19^{\circ}21.29^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ ; $36^{\circ}54.90^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ ), ${\sim}65~\mathrm{nmi}$ eas t of the Zambezi River delta region, at a water depth of 429.2 mbsl.  

Site U1477 receives fluvial material exported from the Zambez i Catchment, which is in the southernmost reach of the African monsoonal precipitation belt and drains multiple subbasins. Collectively, these subbasins span ${\sim}1.385$ million $\mathrm{km^{2}}$ and the river itsel f extends more than $2500~\mathrm{km}$ . Annual precipitation across the Zambezi Catchment varies spatially with ${\sim}150~\mathrm{cm/y}$ in the norther n catchment region, ${\sim}85~\mathrm{cm/y}$ in the southern region, and 60–70 $\mathrm{cm/y}$ in the central region (Ronco et al., 2006). Peak precipitation in the Zambezi Catchment occurs during the austral summer (DJF), when the ITCZ is located at its most southerly position.  

The mean outflow of the Zambezi River is $3000\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$ (Gammelsrød, 1992), and it transports an annual sediment load of ${\sim}51\;\mathrm{Mm}^{3},$ , making it the largest single source of suspended sediment supply to the Mozambique margin (Walford et al., 2005). This fluvial sediment mixes with current-transported and biogenic material and forms a major component of the extensive current-controlled sedimentary deposits that characterize the Mozambique margin. Recent work on shorter cores demonstrates that the strata here have the potential to provide comprehensive proxy records of regional oceanographic changes as well as changes in hydrological conditions of the African precipitation belt in southeastern Africa (e.g., Schefuß et al., 2011; Schulz et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Weldeab et al., 2013, 2014; Just et al., 2014; van der Lubbe et al., 2014, 2016).  

Site U1477 is positioned on a contourite drift deposited under the influence of the eddy-dominated water flow through the Mozambique Channel. The drift displays packages of parallel and laterally continuous subseafloor reflectors. Site U1477 is immediately southwest  of  the $6.51~\mathrm{~m~}$ long  sediment  core  GeoB9307-3 $\left(18^{\circ}33.99^{\prime}\mathrm{S}_{\rightmoon}$ , $37^{\circ}22.89^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $542~\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) (Schefuß et al., 2011). The site was selected because Core GeoB9307-3 showed elevated sedimentation rates during the deglacial period to the Holocene and thus suggested the great potential of Site U1477 for providing a centennial-scale paleoceanographic record. As noted below, the site had almost 10 times higher accumulation than Core GeoB9307-3, so the primary objectives for the site are necessarily modified from the original objectives.  

The Site U1477 primary objectives are to  

• Recover a complete high-resolution sedimentary succession that spans the last 2 My, including the MPT, from the Mozambique margin close to the Zambezi River delta (we only recovered ${<}200\,\mathrm{ky}$ because of the extremely high accumulation rate);   
• Generate a high-resolution Pleistocene profile of southern African continental climate changes on orbital and suborbital timescales;   
• Establish linking between southern African terrestrial climates and southwest Indian Ocean heat budgets, notably warm-water transport along the southeast African margin and associated ocean–atmosphere heat and moisture transfer;   
• Examine the relationship between such climate variability and early human evolution (this objective could not be achieved due to the extreme accumulation rate); and   
• Reconstruct upstream control on Agulhas leakage through headwater variability during periods of orbitally modulated and suborbitally accelerated climate changes.  

The stratigraphic extent of Site U1477 was considerably shorter than anticipated, with a basal age of $<\!200\,\mathrm{ka}$ . As a result, the paleoclimate site objectives will require adjustment to focus on high– temporal timescale variability (decadal–centennial) over the last glacial cycle. The remarkably high sedimentation rates at Site U1477 promise an unprecedented opportunity to investigate hydroclimate variability in southeastern Africa and its potential links to changes in the greater Agulhas Current system. A specific question that will be addressed is whether variable Agulhas Current warmwater transport contributes to and modulates the impacts of shifting air boundaries and rainfall patterns over southeast Africa, and possibly offsets these patterns from those over southwest Africa and the Namib (Dupont et al., 2005, 2011; Maslin et al., 2012; Castañeda et al., 2016).  

Site U1477 consists of three holes that penetrated from 119.4 to $181.2~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. A total of $490.01\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was taken over a $474.0\ \mathrm{m}$ cored interval $(103\%)$ . The APC system penetrated a total of 296.2 m and recovered $308.07\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(104\%)$ . The HLAPC recovered $174.00\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over a $169.2\;\mathrm{m}$ interval $(103\%)$ . The extended core barrel (XCB) was deployed for one core resulting in $7.96~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $(97\%)$ . One interval was advanced ${1.0}\,\mathrm{m}$ without coring to offset the otherwise aligned coring gaps for obtaining a continuous stratigraphic sequence. The total time spent at Site U1477 was 1.8 days (Table T1).  

# Sedimentology  

Sediment at Site U1477 consists of two lithologic units. Unit I $_{2-0.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ CSF-A) is composed of very dark gray to dark greenish gray sandy clay with foraminifers and nannofossils. Unit II $\left(0.5-\right.$ $254.07\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}_{\prime}$ ) is composed of very dark gray to dark greenish gray silty clay with intermittent to frequent occurrences of sand layers. These sand layers contain quartz and clay, and thicknesses range from centimeter to meter scale.  

Bioturbation is not apparent in either unit. Macrofossils, including bivalve and echinoderm fragments, are present throughout the cores. Many of the cores show disturbance related to gas expansion.  

# Physical properties  

Despite the relatively homogeneous lithology, physical properties at Site U1477 show a complex pattern of high-amplitude changes that are likely caused by climate-related variations in terrigenous sediment supply and/or current sorting effects. However, some excursions to lower values in NGR and GRA bulk density data may be due to the voids caused by gas expansion. Also, collection of reliable $P$ -wave data below $16.9\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in all of the holes was inhibited by strong signal attenuation resulting from the frequent occurrence of gas expansion voids. Porosities at Site U1477 decrease downhole, and average porosities are significantly lower when compared to the previous sites (U1474–U1476).  

# Micropaleontology  

Site U1477 spans the Holocene to the Late Pleistocene. Two biostratigraphic datums were observed: the abundance crossover from Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica to Emiliana huxleyi at ${\sim}90~\mathrm{ky}$ and the top occurrence of Globigerinoides ruber (pink) at ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{ky}$ . Sedimentation rates, estimated from biostratigraphic datums as well as radiocarbon ages tied in from a nearby piston core (van der Lubbe et al., 2014), suggest deposition rates of ${\sim}1.5\mathrm{~m/ky}$ from 0 to ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1477A that decrease to ${\sim}83~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to the base of the hole. Calcareous microfossils are generally well preserved, although abundance is typically low. Planktonic foraminifer tests compose ${<}1\%$ of sediment particles in most samples, and fewer than 50 nannofossils per field of view were observed throughout most of the section. The planktonic assemblage includes the regular occurrence of pteropods, benthic foraminifers, ostracods, sponge and gorgonian spicules, mollusks, echinoderm plates, and fish otoliths. Siliceous microfossils make up a minor component of the mudline and core catcher samples where marine and freshwater diatoms, phytoliths, and sponge spicules are present, providing indications of both terrestrial and marine sources. Siliceous microfossils were not found in samples below the mudline.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic measurements at Site U1477 show a clear magnetic signal. For all holes, inclinations center around $-50^{\circ}$ as expected for the site location during the Brunhes Chron. Rockmagnetic data acquired on discrete samples reveal phases of hig h ferrimagnetic mineral content that largely match magnetic susceptibility data collected on archive section halves and whole cores. Variations in magnetic mineral compositions reflect either a chang e in the composition of the terrigenous fraction or preferential mineral dissolution.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Real-time stratigraphic correlation was possible at Site U147 7 using magnetic susceptibility data. Holes U1477A–U1477C wer e used for the splice from 0 to ${\sim}85\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. Below ${\sim}85\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ , the splice consists primarily of sediment from Hole U1477B, with  a couple of exceptions where intervals of Hole U1477A were used.  A continuous stratigraphic splice was not possible to achieve at thi s site because of substantial gas expansion that led to core fracturin g and variable core stretching between holes.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry and headspace gas concentration s show relatively intense early sediment diagenesis at Site U1477. Th e sulfate–methane transition appears at ${\sim}16\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, below whic h sulfate is completely consumed and methane concentrations increase rapidly to a peak of ${\sim}75{,}500$ ppmv at ${\sim}35\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Othe r redox-sensitive elements, including iron, manganese, and barium, show enrichments caused by remobilization. Terrigenous sedimen t is the dominant constituent of the core. Carbonate contents averag e $5\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , with a few intermittent layers rich in shell material with carbonate contents as high as ${\sim}20~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The average TOC content i s $0.61\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

# Site U1478  

Site U1478 is located in the Delagoa Bight on the Inharrime Terrace $\mathrm{^{25^{\circ}49.26^{\prime}S}}$ ; $34^{\circ}46.16^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ) ${\sim}75\,\mathrm{nmi}$ east of the Limpopo River at  a water depth of $488\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ .  

The Delagoa Bight is a distinct indentation of the continenta l margin (Lamont et al., 2010) into which the Limpopo River, the second largest eastward-draining river in Africa, deposits sediment. The hydrography of the Delagoa Bight is influenced by the southerl y flowing waters from the Mozambique Channel and the East Madagascar Current (Lutjeharms, 2006a, 2006b), the confluence of whic h forms the Agulhas Current. The Limpopo Catchment is a little ove r $410,\!000{\mathrm{~km}}^{2}$ , considerably smaller than that of the neighborin g Zambezi River. The Limpopo River has a mean annual discharge o f ${\sim}170\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}$ and delivers annual sediment loads of 33 Mt/y (Millima n and Meade, 1983) to the Delagoa Bight.  

The Site U1478 primary objectives are to  

• Recover a complete high-resolution sedimentary succession that spans the last 2 My;   
• Generate a high-resolution Pleistocene profile of southern African continental climate changes on orbital and suborbital timescales;   
• Establish linking between southern African terrestrial climates and southwest Indian Ocean heat budgets, notably warm-water transports along the southeast African margin and associated ocean–atmosphere heat and moisture transfer;   
• Examine the relationship between such climate variability and early human evolution; and  

• Reconstruct upstream control on Agulhas leakage through headwater variability during periods of orbitally modulated and suborbitally accelerated climate changes.  

Specific questions that will be addressed include Did the longterm climatic developments of the Pleistocene, through their impact on atmospheric circulation, alter the rainfall patterns ove r southeast Africa? Did variable Agulhas Current warm-water transports contribute to and modulate the impacts of shifting air boundaries and rainfall patterns over southeast Africa and possibly offse t these patterns from those over southwest Africa and the Nami b (Dupont et al., 2005; Maslin et al., 2012)?  

Site U1478 consists of four holes that penetrated from 216.0 t o $248.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. A total of $922.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered over a 905. 7 m interval $(102\%)$ . The APC system penetrated a total of $698.9\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $708.66\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(101\%)$ . The HLAPC recovered  a total of $213.4~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over a $206.8~\mathrm{m}$ cored interval $(103\%)$ . Five intervals were advanced $54.3~\mathrm{m}$ without coring to adjust corin g gaps to provide a continuous stratigraphic sequence. The total tim e spent at Site U1478 was 2.7 days.  

# Sedimentology  

Sediment at Site U1478 consists of one lithologic unit. Unit I (0– $248.59\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) is composed of dark olive-gray and dark greenis h gray sand with foraminifers and nannofossils that alternate wit h clayey or sandy silt with foraminifers and nannofossils. The sand i s predominantly composed of quartz.  

Bioturbation is rare; however, the coarser grained sediment a t Site U1478 may obscure sedimentary structures such as bioturbation and diagenetic alterations. Macrofossils, including bivalves, gastropods, and echinoderms, are present throughout the cores.  

# Physical properties  

The physical properties measured at Site U1478 show a comple x pattern of amplitude changes and trends. All high-resolution records derived by physical properties core logging (magnetic susceptibility,  NGR,  GRA  bulk  density,  RGB  color,  and  spectral reflectance) show cyclic changes that are likely related to the variable lithologic alternations between silt-rich and sand-rich intervals. These cyclic changes are pervasive throughout the sequenc e and probably reflect complex interactions between ocean circulation, sea-level fluctuations, and fluvial discharges recorded at Sit e U1478. Two zones of very low magnetic susceptibility values a t ${\sim}89{-}92$ and ${\sim}164{-}168\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A may be related to sediment diagenesis as indicated by elevated iron and manganese concentration s in the interstitial water. Porosities decrease downhole, and averag e porosities are similar to those at Site U1477 but are significantl y lower compared to the deeper water Sites U1474–U1476.  

# Micropaleontology  

Biostratigraphy of calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers indicates that Hole U1478A spans the Late Pleistocene t o the middle Pliocene with a basal age of ${\sim}4\mathrm{~Ma}$ . Calcareous microfossil assemblages include warm subtropical to tropical species i n combination with coastal taxa. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils are abundant throughout Site U1478. Foraminifer s dominate sandy beds, whereas calcareous nannofossils are typicall y more abundant in silty and clay-rich intervals. Glassy and translucent foraminifers are found throughout most of the recovered sequence, although fragmentation is apparent in the oldest parts o f the sequence. Calcareous nannofossils are mostly well preserved, but the Discoaster group commonly exhibits fragmentation of th e delicate arms. Diatoms are present only in surface sediment, an d sponge spicules and phytoliths are scarce in the lower parts of th e sequence. Low levels of reworking are evident in planktonic foraminifer records. The biochronology for both calcareous microfossi l groups reveals sedimentation rates of ${\sim}9~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ between the Lat e Pleistocene and ${\sim}2.1$ Ma and lower rates of $2.9{-}5.3\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ olde r than $2.1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossil s give diverging age-depth relationships between 1.9 and $3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , whic h is possibly linked to sedimentological processes. The two fossi l groups are in agreement in the lowermost ${\sim}25\;\mathrm{m}$ of Site U1478 an d indicate a basal age of $4{-}4.1\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

Rock magnetic and paleomagnetic analyses were carried out o n discrete samples from Hole U1478A and archive-half sections fro m Holes U1478A–U1478D. SIRM and hard isothermal remanen t magnetization (HIRM) measured on discrete samples largely follo w downcore patterns in magnetic susceptibility. The $S_{}$ -ratio is mostl y stable; however, distinct minima at ${\sim}90$ , 165, and $245\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A indicate a strong depletion of low-coercivity minerals. These interval s coincide with minima in the magnetic susceptibility and SIRM records. The minimum in magnetic susceptibility at ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A lie s below the sulfate–methane transition, and the minimum at ${\sim}165\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A is located just below an interval of elevated dissolved Fe an d Mn concentrations, suggesting that in these zones early diageneti c processes affected the magnetic mineral record.  

Inclination data appear to be of good quality, and the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary and the Jaramillo Subchron were identified. According to biostratigraphy, the sedimentary sequence date s to ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ; however, the Matuyama–Gauss Chron transition was no t identified in the paleomagnetic data which might relate to a loss o f the paleomagnetic signal because of diagenetic processes.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Four holes were drilled at Site U1478 using the APC an d HLAPC. Generally good core quality and clear magnetic susceptibility signals resulted in robust and unambiguous stratigraphic tie s between holes. We have high confidence that these holes constitut e a nearly complete section spanning the full length of the longes t hole $248~\mathrm{m}$ recovered in Hole U1478A), with the exception of on e probable gap at ${\sim}195\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The objective of obtaining a complete section was aided by the fact that the magnetic susceptibilit y from whole-round physical property loggers could be used for realtime correlation in Holes U1478B–U1478D; adjustments to th e drilling depth were made in these holes for the purpose of avoidin g potential core gap alignment. A continuous splice was constructe d for the uppermost ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-D, and a floating splice of anothe r ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ of section is appended below the coring gap. In general, th e clarity of the stratigraphic ties and the multiple cross-checks fro m several different data sets gives us high confidence in the integrity o f these two separate spliced sequences.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry and headspace gas concentration s show relatively intense early sediment diagenesis at Site U1478. Th e sulfate–methane transition zone occurs at ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, belo w which sulfate is completely consumed and methane concentration s increase rapidly. Several methane peaks occur below the sulfatemethane transition, with the largest of ${\sim}65{,}000$ ppmv at ${\sim}214\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Other redox-sensitive elements, including iron and manganese, also show multiple peaks at depth. These pulses of iron an d manganese and associated lows in magnetic susceptibility are interpreted as paleoredox horizons related to repeated fluctuations i n sedimentation. Detrital material is the dominant sedimentary component. Carbonate contents average $28\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and TOC contents average $0.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ; neither show any trend with depth.  

# Site U1479  

Site U1479 is located on a $30\,\mathrm{km}$ wide morphological high, rising ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{m}$ above the regional seafloor, on the mid-to-lower western  slope  of  the  Agulhas  Bank  in  Cape  Basin $(35^{\circ}03.53^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ ; $17^{\circ}24.06^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ , ${\sim}85\ \mathrm{nmi}$ southwest of Cape Town, South Africa, at  a water depth of 2615 mbsl.  

This region has been the focus of numerous oceanographi c studies and a growing number of paleoceanographic studies (e.g., Beal et al., 2011, and references therein) in order to describe th e present hydrography within the so-called Indian-Atlantic Ocea n gateway (or “Agulhas ring corridor”; Gordon, 2003) and also to gai n a better understanding of past oceanographic variations in the are a and how they may be related with global climate changes. Several studies have highlighted the Agulhas Current’s sensitivity to climat e changes and reorganizations of atmosphere and the ocean circulation at large.  

As the Agulhas Current detaches from the Agulhas Bank at th e southern tip of Africa, it retroflects, shedding rings, eddies, and filaments to the South Atlantic. This leads to leakage of between 2 an d $20\,\,\mathrm{Sv}$ of Indian Ocean water into the Atlantic Ocean and affects th e water column to depths of $2000\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ (Gordon et al., 1987; de Ruijte r et al., $1999\mathbf{a}$ ; Richardson, 2007).  

The Agulhas ring corridor is an area in which retrieval of highquality sediment cores is difficult. The vigorous Agulhas Curren t and its variability can cause sediment redistribution because meanders and eddies frequently reach the seafloor. However, a number o f published studies and emerging work demonstrate that paleoceanographic records of excellent quality are in fact achievable for reconstructing both surface and deep-water variability in the region (e.g., Rau et al., 2002, 2006; Peeters et al., 2004; Dickson et al., 2010; Martínez-Méndez et al., 2010; Caley et al., 2011, 2012, 2014; Marin o et al., 2013; Dyez et al., 2014; Petrick et al., 2015).  

The Site U1479 primary objectives are to  

• Recover a complete Pliocene–Pleistocene sedimentary succession, including the early Pliocene warm period, mid-Pliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and the MPT, from a high-accumulation site located within the Agulhas ring corridor;   
• Reconstruct Agulhas Current warm-water transports during orbitally modulated and suborbitally accelerated climatic changes;   
• Assess the linking between Antarctic climate variations, circumpolar ocean front instability, and connections with Agulhas leakage into the South Atlantic Ocean;   
• Assess the vigor and hydrography of NADW, or its precursors, exported to CDW and the southwest Indian Ocean; and   
• Evaluate the possibility of advective salinity feedbacks between Agulhas leakage and AMOC variability, notably the possible role of the leakage in modulating surface-to-deep ocean coupling in the North Atlantic during the transition between climatic states.  

Site U1479 consisted of nine holes, ranging in depth from 1.0 t o $300.7\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Overall, 105 cores were recorded for the site. A total o f $963.08\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over a $975.3\mathrm{~m~}$ interval was recovered using th e APC system $99\%$ core recovery). Seven intervals were advance d without coring over $175.7\;\mathrm{m}$ . The total time spent at Site U1479 wa s 6.0 days.  

# Sedimentology  

Sediment at Site U1479 consists of one lithologic unit. Unit I (0– $301.03~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) is composed of light greenish gray, greenish gray, and light olive-gray (5Y 6/2) nannofossil ooze with or without foraminifers.  

Moderate to strong bioturbation is the only secondary sedimentary structure observed and is widespread throughout the sequence. Discrete ichnofossil burrows were commonly observed, often surrounded by thin darker bands. The occurrence of intervals rich i n sand-sized quartz and foraminifers further suggests the depositio n of contourites and/or turbidites.  

# Physical properties  

All high-resolution physical property records derived by cor e logging show similar cyclic changes that are likely related to alternations within the nannofossil ooze between intervals of more or les s terrigenous content and thus may reflect changes in ocean circulation and/or terrigenous supply. Generally, the changes in physica l properties trends broadly correlate between the parameters.  A slump in the lowermost part of Site U1479 is characterized by physical properties that are distinctly different from the rest of the core d section.  

# Micropaleontology  

Biostratigraphy of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and diatoms indicates that Hole U1479B spans the Late Pleistocene to the late Miocene with a bottom age of ${\sim}7\mathrm{~Ma}$ . Calcareou s microfossils include primarily subtropical convergence and coastal - to slope-water taxa with minor abundances of warm subtropica l and subpolar taxa. Diatoms are mostly composed of subtropica l taxa with a minor presence of Southern Ocean taxa in the Pleistocene. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils are abundant throughout Site U1479, whereas diatoms make episodi c appearances, particularly in the upper and lower parts of the record. Preservation is good to moderate for calcareous taxa and moderat e to poor for diatoms. The biochronology for both calcareous microfossil groups and diatoms is consistent with an average sedimentation rate of ${\sim}4.9\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic analyses were carried out on archive halves fro m Site U1479 and on discrete samples from Hole U1479B. The inclination and declination data from the archive halves are relativel y noisy, which might be partially explained by (1) high dilution by carbonate and (2) the alteration of magnetic minerals as suggested b y downhole records of various rock magnetic parameters includin g the S-ratio, HIRM, SIRM, and magnetic susceptibility. Inclination s and declinations show an interval of normal polarity in the uppermost ${\sim}55\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Brunhes Chron), although the lower boundar y is deeper than would be anticipated from the biostratigraphy. A distinct interval of reversed polarity between ${\sim}55$ and ${\sim}125\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF- A corresponds probably to the Matuyama Chron, which spans fro m ${\sim}2.6$ to $3.6\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Unlike the Brunhes/Matuyama Chron boundary, th e inferred Matuyama/Gauss Chron boundary is in agreement wit h ages derived from the biostratigraphy. Additional shore-base d paleomagnetic analyses on rock magnetic properties and directional data are necessary to refine the magnetostratigraphy for Sit e U1479.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Stratigraphic correlation of Holes U1479B–U1479I was complicated by very low magnetic susceptibility and adverse weather conditions resulting in several partial core recoveries in all the holes, a s well as soupy top sections that were generally unusable for stratigraphy. Notwithstanding, the NGR and color (e.g., RGB green) records display clear variability in all undisturbed core sections, making the alignment of cores relatively straightforward once all scanning was complete. Furthermore, comparatively constant offsets between cores in Holes U1479B and U1479C led to the development of a robust and nearly complete splice from just below th e mudline to the bottom of Hole U1479B at ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The generally clear stratigraphic relationship between Holes U1479B an d U1479C only needed refinement and supplementation in scattere d discrete intervals.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water chemistry and headspace gas concentration s indicate moderate early sediment diagenesis. Major element concentrations show some evidence of incorporation into clay mineral s and precipitation of authigenic carbonates. There is no clear sulfate–methane transition zone in Hole U1479B—sulfate concentrations are zero at ${\sim}185\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, but methane concentrations ar e never above ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{ppmv.}$ . Other redox-sensitive elements, such a s iron and barium, show more dramatic enrichments, with iro n reaching ${\sim}15\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at ${\sim}60\mathrm{\m\,CSF{-}A}$ and barium reaching ${\sim}600\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ a t ${\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ . Calcium carbonate ranges from ${\sim}51$ to $91\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , wit h an average value of $67\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ and no distinct trend downhole. Organi c carbon ranges between 0.15 and $1.93\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ with an average value o f $0.62\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

# Expedition synthesis and preliminary scientific assessment  

The greater Agulhas Current system is a key location to stud y past ocean circulation and climate, as it represents a significan t component of the global thermohaline circulation, carrying surfac e water into the Atlantic Ocean that compensates for the export o f deep water from the Atlantic Basin to the world ocean (Figure F1) . The Agulhas Current marks the western boundary of the South Indian Ocean subtropical gyre where it flows southwards along th e southeastern African continental margin. At the southern tip o f South Africa the Agulhas Current, under its own inertia, separate s from the margin and retroflects back into the Indian Ocean flowin g as the ARC. During the retroflection the Agulhas current periodically sheds large (up to $400~\mathrm{km})$ ) mesoscale anticyclonic Agulha s rings (Figure F2), which represent a significant pathway for war m and high-salinity water transfer from the Indian Ocean into th e South Atlantic Ocean. Modulation of this so-called “Agulhas leakage” variably impacts the buoyancy structure there and also likel y contributes to mode changes and variability of the AMOC and thu s climate variability in the North Atlantic region and beyond. Additionally, variations in Agulhas warm-water transports along th e southeast African continental margin foster exchanges of heat an d moisture with the atmosphere that influence regional climates i n southern Africa.  

Operations during Expedition 361 drilled six sites in the IndianAtlantic Ocean gateway in February and March 2016 (Figure F3). I n total, we recovered $5175\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core, with an average recovery o f $102\%$ , during 29.7 days of on-site operations, from a region poorl y represented previously in the database of drill sites for scientifi c purposes. No holes were logged. This is considerably less than th e initially planned campaign targeting $5811\mathrm{~m~}$ of section, includin g downhole logging at four sites (Hall et al., 2015). The differenc e amounts to ${\sim}11$ days of lost operational time. A medical evacuatio n accounted for 1.8 days and weather a further 1.5 days of lost operations. The remainder of the lost operational time was due to delay s in attaining the necessary permissions to operate in Mozambique’ s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) waters, which necessitated a revision of the drilling plan and $2840\ \mathrm{nmi}$ of additional transit to Expedition 361.  

Expedition 361 South African Climates (Agulhas LGM Densit y Profile) had the following five fundamental objectives:  

• To establish the sensitivity of the Agulhas Current to changing climates of the Pliocene–Pleistocene in association with transient to long-term changes of high-latitude climates, ocean gateways, tropical heat budgets, and the monsoon system;   
• To determine the dynamics of the Indian-Atlantic Ocean gateway circulation during such climate changes in association with changing wind fields and migrating ocean fronts;   
• To examine the connection between Agulhas leakage and ensuing buoyancy transfer and shifts of the AMOC during major ocean and climate reorganizations during at least the last 5 My;   
• To address the impact of Agulhas variability on southern Africa terrestrial climates and, notably, rainfall patterns and river runoff; and   
• To constrain the temperature, salinity, and density structure of the LGM deep ocean from the bottom of the ocean to the base of the main thermocline.  

The expedition made major strides toward fulfilling each o f these objectives. The recovered sequences allowed complete splice d sections to be generated that span the interval of 0 to between ${\sim}0.13$ and 7 Ma (Figure F11). The sedimentary compositions (Figure F12) range from highly terrigenous near the Zambezi (Site U1477) an d Limpopo (Site U1478) Rivers and in the Natal Valley (Site U1474) t o very carbonate rich in the northern Mozambique Channel (Sit e U1476), the Agulhas Plateau (Site U1475), and Cape Basin (Sit e U1479). The carbonate fossil preservation is good in the Pleistocen e and mostly good to moderate, tending to be a little worse near th e bottom of each sequence (Figures F13, F14). A robust biostratigraphy was developed for each Site using nannofossils and foraminifers (Figures F15, F16). At Sites U1475 and U1479, diatoms ar e abundant enough to provide further biostratigraphic constraints, and at these sites there is potential for future paleoenvironmenta l work with diatoms (Figure F17). All the fossils showed a mixture o f tropical and subtropical convergence and temperate or subpola r species in the southernmost sites (Figures F17, F18, F19).Change s in these assemblages through time will provide important constraints on the dynamics of the Agulhas Current system.  

For Sites U1475, U1476, U1478, and U1479, sea conditions an d time were sufficient that geochemical compositions were measure d on a suite of solid bulk samples from the carbonate sample residue. As Ba/Al ratios may be a good X-ray fluorescence proxy for productivity, Figure F20 displays the $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratios of bulk samples agains t TOC. Site U1477, with an extremely high terrigenous load, show s no correlation and has $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratios of typical silicate detritus. Sit e U1478 also has mostly terrigenous $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratios, but a few sample s stand above. Site U1476 is in an area of low productivity, so th e range of Ba/Al ratios is low and not correlated with TOC. However,

it is elevated above terrigenous, indicating at least $50\%$ of the Ba i s probably from biogenic sources. Site U1475, located on the Agulha s Plateau where we would expect variations with the position of th e STF, has high Ba/Al ratios and has a generally strong positive tren d with TOC with the exception of a couple of samples.  

Early sediment diagenesis, driven by microbial respiration of organic matter in sediment, defines many dissolved elemental profiles. One of the characteristic profiles that indicates the extent an d intensity of these reactions is dissolved sulfate (Figure F21). Wher e microbial respiration is intense as a result organic matter availabilit y sulfate is rapidly consumed. Where microbial respiration is mor e moderate sulfate decreases more gradually and sometimes persist s to the base of the measured interval. We see a range of diageneti c intensities across the Expedition 361 sites, with the most intens e microbial activity and diagenesis at Site U1477 (Zambezi) and th e least activity at Site U1476 (Mozambique Channel). It is likely tha t the observed differences between sites are driven by location an d sedimentation rate rather than organic carbon content becaus e TOC does not vary systematically between sites (Figure F20).  

Operations at Site U1474 (Natal Valley; Figure F3) were scheduled to produce three APC/XCB holes to 300 meters below seafloo r (mbsf), with logging in one of the deep holes and a single hole t o

Sites U1474, U1477, and U1478 are characterized b y terrigenous sedimentation with carbonate content between 5 and 37. 5 $w t\%$ . Sites U1475, U1476, and U1479 are characterized by pelagic sedimentation with carbonate content between 58 and $80~{\mathsf{W t}}\%$ . Sediment colo r ranges from white-gray (Site U1475) to greenish gray (Sites U1474, U1476, and U1479) and dark gray (Sites U1477 and U1478). Slight to moderate bioturbation occurs at Sites U1476–U1478, whereas strong bioturbation mark s the sediment at Sites U1474, U1475, and U1479. Sandy layers $/{\sim}0.5\;\mathsf{c m}$ to $^{\sim2}$ m thick) at Sites U1474, U1478, and U1479 are interpreted as contourit e and/or turbidite deposits.

150 mbsf for interstitial water samples. This drilling objective wa s largely accomplished with the exception of logging and a reductio n in the target section depth to $254\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A because of loss of operational time as noted above. Recovery was excellent, and triple-coring allowed compilation of a complete spliced record extending t o the latest Miocene $\left\langle{\sim}6.2\ M\mathrm{a}\right\rangle$ . The site boasts an excellent paleomagnetic timescale (Figure F22) that is in good agreement with th e biostratigraphy, and these together suggest uniform sedimentatio n rates of ${\sim}4.1\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ over most of the sequence with an apparent increase near the bottom (Figure F11). This is the only site situate d beneath the main flow of the fully constituted Agulhas Current an d will therefore provide the opportunity for high-resolution climat e reconstructions of Agulhas Current warm-water transports and upstream variability that may allow the identification of connection s between Agulhas leakage and its headwater variability. The site als o holds significant potential to investigate the connections betwee n southern African terrestrial climates and southeast Indian Ocea n heat budgets and notably the links to the cultural evolution of earl y modern humans. A high-resolution program of interstitial wate r samples, collected from a $150\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A section, will provide an additional data point to the presently available pore water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Operations at Site U1475 (Agulhas Plateau; Figure F3) wer e scheduled for three APC/XCB holes to 300 mbsf with logging and  a single hole to 150 mbsf for interstitial water samples. This drillin g objective was largely accomplished with the exception of logging. Recovery was excellent, and multiple coring, including some spo t coring needed because of weather-related disturbances, allowed recovery of a complete spliced record extending to the late Miocen e $({\sim}7\mathrm{~Ma})$ . The paleomagnetic timescale is robust to the base of th e Mammoth Chron (C2An.2r at $99\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A) (Figure F22) and is i n good agreement with the biostratigraphy, but the signal was to o weak to allow a paleomagnetic timescale to be extended to the bottom based on shipboard data. Biostratigraphic estimates sugges t sedimentation rates of ${\sim}2.9~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the uppermost $115\mathrm{~m~CCSF}.$ A, $10.3\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ between 115 and $255\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ , and $2.8\;\mathrm{{cm/ky}}$ between $255~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A and the bottom of the section (Figure F11). This record will provide the opportunity for high-resolution climat e reconstructions of the ARC and connections with the STF, productivity, and deep-water circulation. A high-resolution program of interstitial water samples, collected from a $150\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A section, will provide an additional data point to the presently available interstitial water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Operations at Site U1476 (Mozambique Channel; Figure F3) were scheduled for three APC/XCB holes to 300 mbsf with loggin g and a single hole to 150 mbsf for interstitial water samples. Thi s drilling objective was largely accomplished with the exception o f logging and a reduction in the target depth to $220\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A becaus e of loss of operational time as noted above. Recovery was excellent, and triple coring allowed recovery of a complete spliced record extending to the late Miocene $(\sim\!6.9\,M\mathrm{a})$ . The site boasts excellent biostratigraphy and notably cyclic physical properties. Th e paleomagnetic reversal signal was complicated by apparent cyclically varying magnetic mineralogy, strong coring overprints and operational issues with the orientation tool. Shore-based work will b e required to try to extract a paleomagnetic timescale at this site (Figure F22). The sedimentation rate based on biostratigraphy is ${\sim}2.2$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from the mudline to ${\sim}50\mathrm{\m\,CCSF{-}A}$ and $3.8\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from ${\sim}50$ m CCSF-A to the bottom (Figure F11). This site is located on Davi e Ridge at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel, in a regio n with low productivity and a mean annual sea-air $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ flux is close t o zero (Takahashi et al. 2009). The site will therefore provide the opportunity for high-resolution reconstructions of tropical faunal assemblages is promising for the identification of connection s between Agulhas leakage and its headwater variability. The site als o holds significant potential to investigate the connections betwee n southern African terrestrial climates and southeast Indian Ocea n heat budgets and thermocline and deep-water variability with likel y links to the development of the Indonesian Throughflow as well a s aridification of east Africa. Foraminifers show excellent preservation, thus also making this an ideal site for a long record of surfaceocean pH from boron isotopes. A high-resolution program of interstitial water samples collected from a $150\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ section will provide an additional data point to the presently available interstitial water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Operations at Site U1477 (Zambezi Catchment; Figure F3) wer e scheduled for three APC/XCB holes to 207 mbsf. This drilling objective was modified to end at APC refusal, which led to recoverin g ${\sim}166\;\mathrm{m}$ . Recovery was excellent, and triple coring allowed compila

Qualitative percentages of nannofossi l group (red) and reworked species (green) abundances are indicated on the right with relative latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates for each site.

Site U1477 sequence covers only the Pleistocene; reworke d species are sparsely recorded and it is the only site where nannofossil abundance is variable. The rest of the sites are characterized by a total abundance o f calcareous nannofossils ${>}80\%$ of sediment particles within the three time intervals.

tion of a complete spliced record to ${\sim}85\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A. The magneti c susceptibility signal is strong and could be matched to nearby $^{14}\mathrm{C}_{^{-}}$ dated cores, and two biostratigraphic markers, in agreement, pointed to sediment accumulation rates of ${\sim}1~\mathrm{m/ky}$ at this site (Figure F11). This extreme accumulation rate was a complete surpris e and led to only recovering ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{ky}$ of sediment record from th e Zambezi Catchment. Therefore, the sediment sequence does no t provide 2 My record as planned, but will instead provide the opportunity for extremely high resolution reconstructions of, for example, terrestrial climate and thermocline characteristics during the las t glacial cycle. The site also holds significant potential to investigat e the connections between southern African terrestrial climates an d southeast Indian Ocean heat budgets and the links to the cultura l evolution of modern humans.  

Operations at Site U1478 (Limpopo Catchment; Figure F3) wer e scheduled to be three APC/XCB holes to 180 mbsf, with a permitted depth to 250 mbsf, and a single hole to 150 mbsf for interstitia l waters. This drilling objective was successfully accomplished, an d coring was taken to the maximum allowed depth of $250~\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A with APC, until refusal, followed by HLAPC coring. Recovery wa s excellent, and triple coring allowed compilation of a complet e spliced record extending to ${\sim}4\mathrm{~Ma}$ . The paleomagnetic timescal e was robust for the uppermost ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, below which the signal appears to be modified by diagenesis (Figure F22). For the uppe r part, the magnetic reversal positions are in good agreement wit h the biostratigraphy, and these together suggest a sedimentation rat e of ${\sim}9.3\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from the mudline to ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ and rate of 2. 8 $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to the bottom of the site (Figure F11). This record will provide the opportunity for high-resolution climat e reconstructions of faunal, biogeochemical, and terrigenous tracer s that are characteristic for the upper reaches of the Agulhas Curren t warm-water transports that will allow connections between Agulhas leakage and its headwater variability. The site also holds significant potential to investigate the connections between souther n

A high-resolution program of interstitial water samples collecte d from a $150\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ section will provide an additional data point t o the presently available interstitial water LGM temperature and salinity inventory.  

Operations at Site U1479 (Cape Basin; Figure F3) were scheduled for three APC/XCB holes to 350 mbsf with logging. This drilling objective was largely accomplished with the exception of loggin g and a reduction in the target section depth to ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A because of time and sea condition constraints and the biostratigraph y indication that we had achieved the target age. Recovery was excellent, and multiple coring (with extra cores taken because of disturbed intervals related to large ocean swells) allowed compilatio n of a complete spliced record extending to $\sim\!7\,\mathrm{{Ma}}$ . Although the signal is weak and therefore will need future work on shore, the paleomagnetic timescale (Figure F22) is in good agreement with th e biostratigraphy, and these together suggest uniform sedimentatio n rates of ${\sim}4.3\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ through the sequence (Figure F11). This recor d represents the only site situated in the immediate Agulhas leakag e pathway. It will therefore provide the opportunity for high-resolution climate reconstructions of the leakage and temporal comparisons with deep-water circulation.  

The following specific scientific objectives of the expedition ar e expected to be readably achievable with the materials recovered:  

• To determine the variability of the greater Agulhas Current system under contrasting climatic regimes: early Pliocene warm conditions, during the mid-Pliocene expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and through the MPT;  

• To establish the role of Agulhas leakage in transient and longterm shifts of the AMOC during these climatic transitions: proxy records of mode/strength of Agulhas leakage during periods of major climatic reorganizations and for AMOC variations through the same intervals;   
• To establish the response of the Agulhas Current system to Antarctic climate variability and bipolar linkages: evidence for variation of the Agulhas leakage in highly resolved temporal records will be compared to Antarctic and bipolar climate changes as well as with evidence for shifts of Southern Ocean fronts bordering the Agulhas corridor at the southern tip of Africa, and position and strength of the westerly wind belt;   
• To understand the remote tropical origins of Agulhas Current variability: evidence for variation of Agulhas leakage in highly resolved temporal records will be compared to records of Indonesian Throughflow and monsoon modulation on the Agulhas Current source region and impacts on warm-water and saltwater transports along the southeast African margin and IndianAtlantic saltwater leakage;   
• To better determine southern African climate sensitivity: comparison of varying Agulhas Current warm-water transports with rainfall patterns in southern Africa in connection with the Pliocene–Pleistocene evolution of tropical climates, ITCZ migration, and tectonic history of eastern Africa;   
• To provide further verification of glacial–interglacial variations in the Southern Ocean’s role in the carbon cycle: nutrient cycling, productivity, and $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ and their connections with global biogeochemical cycles.

Drilling operations and core handling were performed, as i s widely acknowledged for IODP, with total professionalism and wit h outstanding commitment to achieving the expedition scientific objectives. As a result, materials recovered during Expedition 36 1 were accordingly astonishing and promise significant future scientific research, including full-recovery APC coring to deeper tha n $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at Site U1479; complete APC records through the lat e Miocene/early Pliocene to recent at Sites U1474–U1476, U1478, and U1479; and 382 interstitial water samples from Sites U1474– U1476 and U1478 to help constrain the temperature, salinity, an d density structure of the LGM spanning from 488 to 3045 mbsl. A t Site U1477, where degassing within the core barrel was pronounced, appropriate core handling adjustments were implemente d rapidly, preserving the scientific value of the cored sections. In summary, the exceptional skills of the drillers and core technicians wer e the main reason why, despite setbacks, the scientific objectives o f Expedition 361 could be accomplished.  

The majority of the lost operational time was due to delays i n attaining the necessary permissions to operate in Mozambique EE Z waters (received some 48 days after the expedition start). These issues should be addressed and resolved prior to an expedition so a s not to impact operational time and thereby jeopardize the scientifi c impact of the recovered material. Although such issues are relativel y rare, in this case Expedition 361 had to compensate by dropping all of the planned logging operations and shortening holes (i.e., exclud e XCB drilling) to ensure complete APC spliced records to targe t stratigraphic depths. To this end the paleoceanographic objective s and the interstitial water program, in support of the APL (Agulha s LGM Density Profile), were met. Fortunately, smooth coring operations, sequence characteristics, and a clement sea state for much o f the expedition worked in our favor to produce $100\%$ recovery. Thi s will serve to reduce the negative impact of lost operational time.
