# Abstract  

Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 334, also known as the Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project (CRISP), was designed to understand the processes that control nucleation and seismic rupture of large earthquakes at erosional subduction zones. CRISP involved the only known erosional end-member of convergent margins within reach of scientific drilling. With a relatively thin sediment cover, fast convergence rate, abundant seismicity, subduction erosion, and change in subducting plate relief along strike, CRISP offered excellent opportunities to learn the causes of earthquake nucleation and rupture propagation. This project complements other deep-fault drilling (San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth and Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment) and investigates the first-order seismogenic processes common to most faults and those unique to erosional margins. The primary goals of Expedition 334 were  

1. Characterization of lithological, physical, and frictional properties of upper plate material;   
2. Estimation of subduction channel thickness and the rate of subsidence caused by subduction erosion;   
3. Characterization of the fluid flow system and thermal structure of the erosive margin; and   
4. Determination of the change in the stress field across the updip limit of the seismogenic zone.  

In order to accomplish these objectives, coring was conducted at three slope sites (Sites U1378 and U1380 on the middle slope and Site U1379 on the upper slope) and at one site on the Cocos plate (Site U1381). Expedition 334 is also the first step toward deep riser drilling through the aseismic and seismic plate boundary; both slope sites might serve as pilot holes for a potential future riser drilling project. Sites U1378 and U1379 were first characterized by logging while drilling (LWD) to document in situ physical properties, stratigraphic and structural features, and stress state, in addition to continuous core sampling to the target depth. Cores at both sites were taken to examine slope sediments and the underlying upper plate basement. The coupling of LWD data with data from sediment and basement samples provides important information about tectonic, hydrologic, and seismic features along this erosive convergent margin.  

# Background  

# Subducting plate and the Cocos Ridge  

The oceanic Cocos plate subducting beneath Costa Rica has been formed at two different spreading centers, the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and the Cocos-Nazca Spreading Center (CNS), and has been largely influenced by Galapagos hotspot volcanism. The largest feature formed by the passage of the Cocos plate over the Galapagos hotspot is the $2.5\;\mathrm{km}$ high Cocos Ridge (Fig. F1). The oceanic crust beneath the ridge is three times thicker than normal oceanic crust $^{25}\,\mathrm{km}$ ; Stavenhagen et al., 1998), having a Galapagos-type geochemical composition. Bordering the ridge to the northwest is regular CNS oceanic crust. Younger seamounts also being formed by the Galapagos hotspot cover $40\%$ of this area of the Cocos plate (Fig. F1), resulting in a rather rough plate morphology. Further north, the EPR-generated crust has a smoother morphology. The area drilled during Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 84 and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 170 and 205 (von Huene, Aubouin, et al., 1985; Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003) lies just northwest of the EPR/CNS crustal boundary (Barckhausen et al., 2001). Sills with a Galapagos-type geochemistry drilled at ODP Sites 1039 and 1253 show the great lateral extent of hotspot volcanism.  

The influence of Cocos Ridge subduction increases from the Nicoya Peninsula in the northwest to the Burica Peninsula in the southeast ${\sim}400\ \mathrm{km}$ ; Fig. F1) and is accompanied by morphologic changes along the margin in response to shallowing of the Wadati-Benioff Zone. The seismically active slab dips at ${\sim}65^{\circ}$ near the Nicaraguan border and shallows a few degrees inboard of the Cocos Ridge. The timing of the Cocos Ridge impinging on the Middle American Trench is an unresolved issue, with estimates ranging from ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Hey, 1977; Lonsdale and Klitgord, 1978) to ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Miocene time; Sutter, 1985). The $5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ age is based on the emplacement of adakitic arc rocks between 5.8 and $2.0\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Abratis and Wörner, 2001) and thermochronological constraints on the uplift of the Talamanca Cordillera (Gräfe et al., 2002). However, marine deposition and volcanic flows in the Pliocene Terraba forearc basin directly inboard of the Cocos Ridge (Kolarsky et al., 1995) raise serious concerns about this model. A second question is when the Cocos Ridge started to form. Several investigators have proposed a date of ${\sim}20{-}22\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , synchronous with the formation of the CNS (van Andel et al., 1971; Lonsdale and Klitgord, 1978).  

# Upper plate and onland geology  

Arcward of the Middle American Trench offshore the Osa Peninsula, the lower slope consists of a $10{-}12\ \mathrm{km}$ wide frontal prism (Fig. F2). A similar $3{-}5\ \mathrm{km}$ wide frontal prism is also present offshore the Nicoya Peninsula, where it is composed of slope sediment redeposited into the trench and buttressed against forearc basement. The forearc basement, although poorly sampled during Leg 170, is generally accepted to be composed of the same igneous rock exposed onshore (Ye et al., 1996; Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997; Vannucchi et al., 2001). The igneous complexes exposed in Costa Rica represent parts of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province (CLIP) (emplaced between 74 and $94\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ; Sinton et al., 1998) and accreted ocean islands and aseismic ridge terranes (Hauff et al., 1997, 2000; Sinton et al., 1997; Hoernle et al., 2002). Crucially, there is no evidence that the forearc is composed of a complex of tectonized sediments offscraped from the currently subducting plate, although the $60{-}65\,\mathrm{\Ma}$ Quepos and Osa terranes are interpreted to reflect rocks accreted from subducted edifices generated by the Galapagos hotspot (Hauff et al., 1997; Vannucchi et al., 2006).  

The forearc basement (Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project [CRISP] transect) southeast of the operation area of Legs 84, 170, and 205 is interpreted to be composed of a middle Eocene–middle Miocene melange of oceanic lithologies accreted to the overriding plate (Vannucchi et al., 2006). The Osa Mélange, dominated by basalt, radiolarite, and limestone, is the most seaward unit exposed on land close to the CRISP transect. The nature and significance of the Osa Mélange remains a subject of debate. It has alternatively been interpreted as debris flows that were subsequently accreted to the margin (Buchs and Baumgartner, 2003), as a tectonic mélange produced by subduction erosion (Meschede et al., 1999), or as an old tectonic mélange developed within material that was accreted prior to the arrival of the Cocos Ridge (Vannucchi et al., 2006). There is no evidence to suggest that the Osa Mélange reflects accretion from the currently subducting plate, and the evidence for ongoing tectonic erosion of the forearc is compelling. The Osa Mélange is, to our best knowledge, the unit that forms the forearc basement, which we could expect to drill as upper plate basement during CRISP. A major unknown is the nature of the high-amplitude landward-dipping reflectors cutting through the forearc basement (Fig. F2). The reflectors branch upward from the plate interface similarly to “splay faults” (Park et al., 2002). Our interpretation, though, suggests that these surfaces represent old faults related to a middle Eocene–middle Miocene accretionary event, now sealed by the slope apron sediments. Only a few of these faults have been reactivated as normal faults, as indicated by offsets at the top of the forearc basement into the slope apron that commonly occur offshore the Nicoya Peninsula and Quepos (McIntosh et al., 1993; Ranero and von Huene, 2000). Thus, the lack of a clear thrust sequence argues against the presence of out-of-sequence thrusts cutting the submarine portions of the forearc.  

Seismic reflectors extending into the forearc basement have been interpreted as faults that are potential planes of weakness, which could play a role in focusing the flow of fluids drained from the deeper part of the margin, as suggested by the high reflectivity and high heat flux. However, the nature of permeability along these discontinuities is unknown. Identifying the nature and age of the landward-dipping reflectors is fundamental to understanding the tectonic history and the modern functioning of the margin offshore of the Osa Peninsula. The near-orthogonal subduction of bathymetrically rough oceanic lithosphere along the northern flank of the Cocos Ridge imprints a distinctive style of deformation on the overriding Costa Rican forearc. The CRISP drilling area has experienced the subduction of the Cocos Ridge, which has caused  

1. The extinction of the arc volcanism and uplift of the Talamanca Cordillera; 2. The inversion of the middle Eocene–Pliocene forearc basin, now exposed along the Fila Costeña, a fold and thrust belt with peak elevations of $1000{-}1500\,\mathrm{m}.$ ; and 3. The exhumation of the Late Cretaceous–early Eocene ophiolitic rocks cropping out along the Gulfo Dulce and the middle Eocene–middle Miocene Osa Mélange.  

In correspondence to the onland projection of the Cocos Ridge axis, mesoscale fault populations and field mapping record active shortening related to the Fila Costeña fold-and-thrust belt (Fisher et al., 2004). Magnitudes of shortening decrease northwest and southeast of the onland projection of the Cocos Ridge axis. Locally, the foldand-thrust belt accommodates at least $36~\mathrm{km}$ of post–middle Pliocene shortening, which translates to a shortening rate of ${\sim}40~\mathrm{mm/y},$ or nearly $50\%$ of the total plate convergence rate (Sitchler et al., 2007).  

Across the northwest coast of the Osa Peninsula, uplifted late Quaternary marine deposits have been dated (Sak et al., 2004). These Quaternary deposits disconformably overlie exposures of semilithified late Tertiary and Quaternary sediment of the Charco Azul and Armuelles Formations and the Paleogene Osa Mélange (Sprechmann, 1984; Corrigan et al., 1990; Di Marco et al., 1995; Vannucchi et al., 2006). Exposures of late Paleocene deposits inboard of the axis of the subducting Cocos Ridge provide a detailed record of a complex history of vertical tectonism. Uplifted accumulations of fining-upward marine sands indicative of increasing water depth were deposited during an interval of eustatic sea level fall. This complex, yo-yo-like history of rapid syndepositional subsidence followed by rapid uplift observed across the northwestern Osa Peninsula may be related to the morphology of the underthrusting Cocos plate (Sak et al., 2004). The permanent strain recorded by uplift of these Quaternary surfaces exceeds the predicted rebound of stored elastic strain released during subduction-zone earthquakes.  

# Volcanic arc  

Throughout the Tertiary, and especially during the Miocene, frequent volcanism in Central America produced very large eruptions of highly siliceous magma (Sigurdsson et al., 2000; Jordan et al., 2006). The majority of this magma formed the ignimbrites that extend from southern Mexico to southern Nicaragua, forming the Central American highlands (Sigurdsson et al., 2000). Some of the Miocene ignimbrites are present as far south as Costa Rica (Vogel et al., 2004, 2006). At ${\sim}8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , the volcanic front in Nicaragua shifted, probably in response to a change of the subduction direction (Ehrenborg, 1996; Barckhausen et al., 2001; DeMets, 2001), to its present position. In contrast, the volcanic arc in Costa Rica and Guatemala has maintained a more or less stable position.  

In Costa Rica, new $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ dating indicates a maximum age of the volcanic arc of at least $24\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Gans et al., 2002). Plutons intruded the Talamanca Cordillera until the late Miocene $({\sim}7\mathrm{~Ma})$ (Mora, 1979; Sutter, 1985; Gans et al., 2002), after which subduction-related calc-alkaline magmatism diminished. Although normal arc magmatism ceased in southern Costa Rica and western Panama from the late Miocene to Pliocene (i.e., ${\sim}6{-}3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ), backarc alkaline magmatism produced lava flows, dikes, and sills (Abratis and Wörner, 2001). Volumetrically insignificant Pliocene to Quaternary $\left\langle5.8{-}2.0\ \mathrm{Ma}\right\rangle$ ) volcanic rocks erupted just south of the central magmatic arc. These lavas have a trace element signature characterizing them as partial melting products of subducted oceanic crust with garnet residue, or adakites, and a plume-related isotope signature (Abratis and Wörner, 2001; Gans et al., 2002; MacMillan et al., 2004).  

One of the few younger large-magnitude eruptions of central Costa Rica is represented by the $322\mathrm{~ka}$ Tiribí Tuff (Pérez et al., 2006). However, there are additional widespread Plinian fall deposits from Costa Rican volcanoes that can be identified in the marine sediments, although no onshore correlatives have been identified (Kutterolf et al., 2008).  

Variations in the nature of the incoming plate, in crustal thickness and composition (von Huene et al., 1995; Barckhausen et al., 1998) and in the tectonic setting, are accompanied by arc-parallel variations in the composition of the volcanic rocks (Carr, 1984; Feigenson and Carr, 1986; Carr et al., 1990, 2003, 2007; Patino et al., 1997, 2000; Hoernle et al., 2002; Feigenson et al., 2004) and the magnitudes of eruptions (Rose et al., 1999). Such compositional variations are very helpful when correlating volcanic depositions on land with marine ash beds (Kutterolf et al., 2008). Compositional differences like these probably also exist for the neogene volcanism of Central America.  

The arc volcanic rocks from Costa Rica have a composition that is similar to oceanisland basalts (OIBs), resembling volcanic rocks found along the Galapagos hotspot (Reagan and Gill, 1989). The origin of this geochemical signature is discussed. Different models exist favoring the origin of this signature either by residual Galapagostype mantle after formation of the large igneous province or flow of OIB-type astenospheric mantle: (1) through a slab window or (2) from the northwest margin of South America (Herrstrom et al., 1995; Abratis and Wörner, 2001; Feigenson et al., 2004). Others explain the OIB signature by subduction erosion of older Galapagos and CLIP terranes in the Costa Rican forearc (Goss and Kay, 2006) or that it is primarily derived from the subducting Galapagos hotspot track (Hoernle et al., 2008). Because the Galapagos hotspot tracks (and islands) are chemically zoned (Hoernle et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003), radiogenic isotope ratios, which are not modified by melting processes, can be used to distinguish between magmas influenced by the seamount province and the Cocos and Coiba Ridges. These characteristics allow estimates of arc-parallel mantle flow rate in the wedge of $63{-}190\,\mathrm{mm/}\mathrm{y}$ y from Costa Rica to Nicaragua (Hoernle et al., 2008)  

The Central America volcanic arc was a high-priority study area of the Subduction Factory initiative of the US MARGINS program. Along this arc, variations in subduction dynamics result in sharp differences in the apparent sediment transport to depth, mirroring strong along-strike changes in trace element and isotopic chemistry, such as the $^{10}\mathrm{Be}$ deficit in Costa Rican volcanoes (Morris et al., 2002).  

Investigations of the tephra stratigraphy preserved in the slope apron sediments offshore Osa will help in the along-strike reconstruction of the margin and will open a window into the processes linked to the volcanic arc shutdown when compared to the ash stratigraphy already recovered offshore the Nicoya Peninsula.  

# Subduction erosion  

Drilling and seismic data indicate active and long-lived subduction erosion from Guatemala to Costa Rica (Ranero and von Huene, 2000; Ranero et al., 2000; Vannucchi et al., 2001, 2003, 2004). This interpretation is based on long-term subsidence of the continental slope offshore Nicoya Peninsula. Leg 170 provided direct evidence of shallow-water sedimentary rocks, now located in $3900\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth on the forearc and marking the slope apron–forearc basement unconformity, proving that the margin offshore Nicoya Peninsula has experienced a net loss of crust since ${\sim}16\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Vannucchi et al., 2001). Detailed analysis of the benthic fauna preserved in the slope apron sediment from Legs 84 and 170 indicates that the slow background subsidence of ${\sim}20~\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ . dramatically increased to ${\sim}600\ \mathrm{m/m.y.}$ . starting at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary (Vannucchi et al., 2003). This acceleration in subsidence linked to the arrival of the Cocos Ridge at the Middle American Trench (Vannucchi et al., 2003) is our best proxy for faster subduction erosion offshore Osa Peninsula where ridge subduction caused severe damage to the margin, as suggested by the disrupted topography (von Huene et al., 2000). The whole margin, in fact, has a broad concavity centered on the Cocos Ridge reflecting the removal of material through ridge subduction. The slope offshore Osa has retreated as much as $20\,\mathrm{km}$ more than in the Nicoya area, where the subducting plate is smoother and the trench retreat has been estimated at ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{km}$ since $16\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Vannucchi et al., 2001). The inner slope trench of Costa Rica is punctuated by subducted seamount tracks reflecting a net loss of material. There, a particularly disrupted topography is present at the base of the slope and in the wake of seamounts.  

The slope apron–forearc unconformity extends regionally across the igneous basement in northern Costa Rica and the middle Eocene–middle Miocene mélange in southern Costa Rica. Offshore Nicaragua, subsidence driven by tectonic erosion triggered the development of the Sandino forearc basin (Ranero and von Huene, 2000; Ranero et al., 2000).  

# Fluids and volatiles in the forearc  

Active fluid venting indicated by elevated methane concentrations in the bottom water have been observed along the entire Costa Rican margin (Kahn et al., 1996; McAdoo et al., 1996; Bohrmann et al., 2002). Chemoautotrophic and methanotrophic communities mark cold vents at numerous localities, but higher concentrations have been found where subducted seamounts have triggered fractures, slides, and slumps that break a low-permeability, shallow sediment carapace, allowing ascending fluids to feed the communities that are particularly concentrated at the headwall scarps (Kahn et al., 1996; Bohrmann et al., 2002; Ranero et al., 2008). Mud volcanoes and mud diapirs have also been found, particularly across the middle slope, and are associated with a high density of chemosynthetic vents. The chemistry of the pore fluids sampled at these mid-slope features is indicative of dehydration reactions at depth, suggesting they are associated with structures that enable effective transport of fluids in the overpressured slope sediments (Shipley et al., 1992; Bohrmann et al., 2002; Grevemeyer et al., 2004; Hensen et al., 2004).  

Coring and sampling during Leg 170 revealed freshened pore waters containing elevated Ca, Li, and $C_{3}{-}C_{6}$ hydrocarbon concentrations and low K concentrations along the décollement and the upper fault zone in the prism (Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997; Silver et al., 2000; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003). These fluids contrast with pore fluids from below the décollement and between the décollement and upper fault zone that have near-seawater chemistry (Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003). Downhole temperatures measured during Legs 170 and 205 are insufficient to support in situ mineral dehydration and thermogenic methane. Collectively, the geochemical data in the décollement offshore Nicoya Peninsula indicate that this flow system is active and a fraction of the fluid is derived from depths within the subduction zone where temperatures are ${\sim}80^{\circ}{-}150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Chan and Kastner, 2000; Silver et al., 2000; Kastner et al., 2006; Solomon et al., 2009). The sharpness of the geochemical anomalies in the décollement and the estimated temperature of the fluid suggest updip flow from a source region ${\sim}38{-}55~\mathrm{km}$ landward of the trench at ${\sim}9{-}14~\mathrm{km}$ depth, near the updip limit of the seismogenic zone (Harris and Wang, 2002; Spinelli and Saffer, 2004; Kastner et al., 2006; Ranero et al., 2008).  

During Leg 205, two sealed borehole hydrologic observatories (CORKs) were installed offshore Nicoya Peninsula to investigate the relationship between tectonics, fluid flow, and fluid composition (Jannasch et al., 2003; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003; Solomon et al., 2009). One of these CORKs was deployed at Site 1255 with downhole instrumentation designed to monitor formation fluid flow rates, composition, pressure, and temperature in a screened interval in the décollement. The other CORK was deployed at Site 1253 with downhole instrumentation to measure fluid pressure, temperature, and chemistry in the subducting igneous basement. The initial 2 y record was recovered in September 2004, and a second record was recovered in February 2009. The long-term pore fluid pressure record at Site 1255 showed a nearsteady-state pressure that was only moderately superhydrostatic with a pore pressure ratio $(\lambda^{\star})$ of $\mathord{\sim}0.2$ (Davis and Villinger, 2006), and flow rates averaged ${\sim}1.0\,\mathrm{cm/y}$ during the 2002–2004 deployment period (Solomon et al., 2009). Two positive transients in fluid pressure, flow rates, and composition were observed along the décollement between 2002 and 2004 (Davis and Villinger, 2006; Solomon et al., 2009). Both transients coincided with onshore deformational events recorded at continuously monitored GPS stations on the Nicoya Peninsula $\sim\!\!2$ weeks prior to being recorded near the trench at the CORK (Protti et al., 2004). These two transients were the result of aseismic slip dislocations that propagated updip over the course of $\sim\!2$ weeks, terminating before reaching Site 1255 and the trench (Solomon et al., 2009), and indicate that slow slip events propagate through the seismogenic zone to the trench at the Costa Rica subduction zone.  

The importance of the hydrological activity in the subducting oceanic plate is just beginning to be appreciated (Silver et al., 2000; Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2008; Solomon et al., 2009; Harris et al., 2010a). Low heat flow values averaging ${\sim}30~\mathrm{mW/}$ $\mathbf{m}^{2}$ exist in the EPR-generated crust offshore the Nicoya Peninsula (Langseth and Silver, 1996; Fisher et al., 2003; Heesemann et al., 2006). These values reflect ${<}30\%$ of the expected value from conductive lithospheric cooling models for $24\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ crust (Stein and Stein, 1994), indicating effective hydrothermal cooling of the upper oceanic crust in the study area with recharge and discharge occurring at distant igneous outcrops and seamounts (Fisher et al., 2003). This inference is corroborated by pore fluid chemical and isotopic profiles in basal sediments that show a return to approximate seawater values near the upper part of the igneous basement (Chan and Kastner, 2000; Silver et al., 2000; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003). In addition to the cooling effect, the vigorous lateral flow of seawater must also alter and hydrate the igneous crust, affecting chemical and isotopic mass balances as well as the transfer of volatiles through the subducting slab down to the depth of magma genesis.  

The continuous fluid pressure, temperature, and chemistry record obtained from the CORK at Site 1253 shows that the pressure in uppermost igneous basement is ${\sim}6~\mathrm{kPa}$ subhydrostatic (Davis and Villinger, 2006), indicating it is highly permeable. The average fluid flow rate measured at the Site 1253 CORK is $0.3\;\mathrm{m/y},$ , and the fluid chemistry in the basement indicates that the basement fluid is actually a mixture between seawater $(\sim\!50\%)$ from the regional fluid flow system and a subduction zone fluid originating within the forearc $(\sim\!50\%)$ (Solomon et al., 2009). These results suggest that the uppermost basement offshore Nicoya Peninsula serves as an efficient pathway for fluid expelled from the forearc. Offshore Osa Peninsula, heat flow values are much higher than at Nicoya Peninsula (averaging ${\sim}130\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ (von Herzen and Uyeda,  

1963; Vacquier et al., 1967). The Cocos Ridge upper crust is well layered and probably very permeable (C.R. Ranero, pers. comm., 2003). The contribution from the lower plate to the fluid circulation could also be significant in the CRISP drilling area. Drilling during Expedition 334 will help clarify fluid sources and pathways in this segment of the Costa Rica margin.  

# Seismic reflection data  

Seismic reflection images collected between Osa and the Cocos Ridge (Fig. F2) are indicative of a more stratified forearc basement and lower velocity material $({\sim}1\ \mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s})$ than in equivalent areas along the Nicoya transect. The contact between the Osa Mé- lange and a separate forearc igneous basement is indicated in wide-angle seismic data, reflection data (Fig. F3), and magnetic modeling. Short-wavelength magnetic anomalies beneath the Osa continental shelf are interpreted as localized bodies of igneous rock mixed with sedimentary rocks (U. Barckhausen, unpubl. data). Dredged rock samples from the Cocos Ridge and related seamounts give ages of 13.0–14.5 Ma near the trench (Werner et al., 1999). This leaves a $45\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ gap in the geologic record between the Galapagos hotspot activity preserved in the Cocos Ridge and the CLIP (74– $94\mathrm{\Ma}$ ). Rocks emplaced during this interval may be partially recorded in rock accreted beneath the Osa continental slope-forearc (Hoernle et al., 2002).  

# Heat flow  

Offshore Costa Rica regional values of heat flow show marked changes along strike. Offshore the northern Nicoya Peninsula, heat flow values are anomalously low compared to global averages of similarly aged crust and conductive cooling models. In contrast, regional heat flow values offshore the southern Nicoya Peninsula and to the south are scattered but the mean is consistent with conductive cooling models. Two heat flow surveys (Ticoflux I and II) mapped the thermal transition between these crustal regions seaward of the trench and found that the thermal transition was quite sharp, indicative of a shallow source and consistent with more vigorous circulation. Locally, the location of the thermal transition zone is influenced by the presence of seamounts that act as sites of recharge and discharge (Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2006, 2007). Detailed profiles along the margin were made by the R/V METEOR Cruise 54-2 from Nicaragua south to southern Costa Rica (Harris et al., 2010a). These values, coupled with an earlier survey (Langseth and Silver, 1996) and values from Leg 170 (Ruppel and Kinoshita, 2000), document the thermal structure of the incoming plate and margin. Additionally, bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) depths used as a proxy for heat flow extend the spatial coverage of seafloor measurements. Comparisons of collocated seafloor heat flow measurements and BSR-derived heat flow are in excellent agreement, adding confidence to the use of BSRs as a heat flow proxy in this area (Harris et al., 2010a). The combination of these data show the profound effect of fluid flow through faults that cut the margin and within the upper oceanic basement as the plate subducts (Harris et al., 2010a, 2010b). Temperatures beneath the midslope drilling sites are estimated to range between $60^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# Seismogenic zone and earthquakes  

CRISP Program A is preparatory for the seismogenic zone experiment and will define the tectonic reference for deeper drilling. A full overview of the seismogenesis studies offshore the Osa Peninsula is provided in the CRISP Complex Drilling Project document. Here we want to emphasize, using teleseismic waveform modeling, that the Mw 6.4 June 2002 underthrusting earthquake (including its aftershocks) (Fig. F4) occurred at a shallower depth $(\sim\!9\ \mathrm{km})$ (S.L. Bilek, pers. comm., 2003; I. Arroyo, pers. comm., 2009) than the 1999 earthquake event to the north. This may reflect alongstrike variations in the updip extent of the seismogenic zone or its transitional nature.  

GPS measurements on land indicate high stress over the subducted Cocos Ridge with most of the plate interface in the seismogenic region essentially fully locked (Dixon, 2003). In contrast, seismic profiles indicate fault geometries (i.e., angles between forethrusts, backthrusts, and the décollement), suggesting low values of plate boundary friction (von Huene et al., 2000, 2004; von Huene and Ranero, 2003). These values are comparable to the shear strength of marine sediment and are able to accommodate seafloor relief at the front of the margin without much deformation. Fluids draining from the subducting lower plate are sufficient to hydrofracture and mobilize about a $1{-}2\,\mathrm{km}$ thick and $20\,\mathrm{km}$ long section of the upper plate material every million years in Central America.  

# Site survey data  

The regional framework of the Middle American Trench off Costa Rica is well known from investigations since DSDP drilling in the early 1980s (Aubouin, von Huene, et al., 1982; von Huene, Aubouin, et al., 1985) and later Legs 170 and 205 (Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003). Recently, it has been the focus area of two major scientific projects: the German Collaborative Research Center (SFB) 574 “Volatiles and fluids in subduction zones” (sfb574.ifm-geomar.de/ home/) and the US MARGINS National Science Foundation program (www.nsf-margins.org/SEIZE/CR-N/CostaRica.html). The results are ${>}10,\!000\ \mathrm{km}$ of seismic data acquisition, detailed seismological studies, and extensive bathymetric imaging (swath bathymetry; Weinrebe and Ranero, in GeoMapApp and MARGINS Data Portal) (Fig. F5). The extensive multibeam bathymetric mapping started after the results from Cruise SO-76 of the German R/V Sonne, which showed a varying seafloor morphology from offshore the Nicoya Peninsula to offshore the Osa Peninsula (von Huene et al., 1995). The multibeam bathymetry is complemented by several deep-towed instrument traverses. The towed ocean bottom instrument (TOBI) sidescan sonar system of the Southampton Oceanography Centre was used during Cruise SO-163 in the spring of 2002 to detect active fluid flow at seafloor mounds and mass wasting offshore Costa Rica (Weinrebe and Ranero, 2003). Together with the results of the TOBI survey during Cruise SO-144 in 1999, much of the continental margin from Costa Rica to southeast Nicaragua was imaged with a resolution of $10\,\mathrm{m}$ . Parts of that surveyed area were imaged with greater resolution using the GEOMAR DTS-1 deep-towed sidescan sonar system to map key areas with a resolution of better than $^1\textrm{m}$ (Klaucke et al., 2008; Petersen et al., 2009). Observations of the seafloor with a TV sled, gravity coring, and a TV-guided grab (Flüh et al., 2004) pinpointed areas of interest. Widespread mounds, some tens of meters high and a few hundred meters wide, have been monitored with current meters and hydrographic stations (Flüh et al., 2004). Outcropping carbonates on top and at the flanks indicate that these mounds are formed by chemoherm carbonates with abundant signs of fluid flow (Bohrmann et al., 2002; Hensen et al., 2004).  

Two permanent seismological networks have recorded seismicity in the area for the last three decades. Because offshore coverage is necessary to obtain high-quality locations for earthquakes originating at the seismogenic zone, several marine seismological networks of ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and ocean-bottom hydrophones (OBH) have been deployed offshore Costa Rica. The Costa Rica Seismogenic Zone Experiment (CRSEIZE), run by the University of California Santa Cruz, University of California San Diego, Observatorio Vulcanologico y Sismologico de Costa Rica, and University of Miami, established two seismic networks off the Osa and Nicoya Peninsulas. The first network was a 3 month (September–November 1999) onshore and offshore deployment between Quepos and the north shore of the Osa Peninsula, recording aftershocks from the 20 August 1999 Mw 6.9 underthrust earthquake. The second network operated onshore and offshore the Nicoya Peninsula from December 1999 to June 2000 (Newman et al., 2002; DeShon et al., 2006). CRSEIZE also included GPS campaigns across Costa Rica (Norabuena et al., 2004). German SFB 574 and the  

Red Sismologica Nacional used Cruises SO-163, SO-173, and M-54 (R/V Meteor) to deploy and recover two networks of OBS and land stations between Nicoya and Osa Peninsulas, each running during a period of six months from April 2002 to March 2003 (Arroyo et al., 2009; Dinc et al., 2010). The first of these networks (April–October 2002) happened to record the Mw 6.4 main shock and $\mathord{\sim}400$ aftershocks to the west of Osa Peninsula (Aden-Arroyo, 2008). The latter sequence surrounds the drilling scheduled in 2011.  

Geophysical data acquisition in the proposed Osa drilling area is extensive. Besides the already mentioned CRSEIZE transect (Newman et al., 2002; Norabuena et al., 2004), the proposed sites are positioned on an OBS/OBH seismic refraction transect across the entire onshore/offshore of Costa Rica (Ye et al., 1996; Stavenhagen et al., 1998) (Fig. F3) acquired in 1995/1996 during the Trans Isthmus Costa Rica Scientific Exploration of a Crustal Transect (TICOSECT) project. The TICOSECT transect is coincident with three multichannel seismic reflection surveys. The first was shot in 1978 (IG2903 vessel Ida Green), later reshot by Shell Oil (Kolarsky et al., 1995), and shot again in 1999 (BGR99 vessel Prof. Polshkov) with a long streamer and an industry acquisition system (Fig. F6). More recently, from 2004 to 2006, the German project SFB 574 operated a transect of broadband seismological stations following the same orientation as TICOSECT (Dzierma et al., 2010).  

During 1991 and 1992, the Sonne made two cruises (SO-76 and SO-81) that greatly expanded swath mapping, seismic reflection, and refraction coverage from the area off the Nicoya Peninsula for ${\sim}250~\mathrm{km}$ to the southeast where the crest of Cocos Ridge is subducting (Fig. F1). The interpretation of the seismic reflection data from Cruise SO81 (Hinz et al., 1996) complements data acquired in 1999. Two BGR99 records are processed in depth (Fig. F2) and the remainder in time domains. The principal site survey line is flanked on either side by 2 lines at $1\;\mathrm{km}$ spacing and then by lines at 2, 5, and $10\,\mathrm{km}$ spacing (Fig. F6). Although these are the most revealing seismic images, other industry- and academic-acquired records in the area are numerous. Unfortunately, the resources are not available to process them to their full potential. Proposed sites have cross-lines of industry and academic heritage. Transducer and high-resolution sparker coverage is available. Magnetic and gravity data cover the area (Barckhausen et al., 1998; Barckhausen et al., 2001). GPS geodesy has been studied for more than a decade and results show a locked Osa Peninsula area (LaFemina et al., 2009).  

# Scientific objectives  

The target of Expedition 334 was the slope sediments and the shallow portion of the upper plate basement in the Costa Rica erosive subduction system. The scientific objectives of LWD and coring at the two slope sites are the following:  

1. Estimate the composition, texture, and physical and frictional properties of the upper plate material.  

The upper plate material at erosive convergent margins is transported into the subduction channel, and thus into the seismogenic zone, by upward migration of the plate boundary. The onset of seismogenic behavior along the subduction thrust is influenced by the physical and frictional properties of the overriding plate material. Geologic and experimental characterization of the upper plate basement is needed to provide structural and mechanical constraints on the possible changes in frictional behavior across the updip limit of the seismogenic zone. Sampling rocks of the upper plate basement beneath the upper slope is also useful to define drilling conditions for deep holes.  

2. Quantify subduction channel thickness and the rate of subduction erosion.  

The actively slipping plate boundary interface is located within the subduction channel. Determination of the thickness of the subduction channel is critical for preparatory structural geology work and the concept of describing the active slip surface and the damage zone for the deep riser drilling. To estimate the thickness of the subduction channel, namely the zone of broken upper plate material currently subducting, we need quantification of mass removal in the CRISP study area. A two-point recovery of fossiliferous sediment across the margin allows the crustal loss rate to be determined through the evaluation of a subsidence profile. Offshore Nicoya, the estimated volume of eroded upper plate rock carried down the subduction zone is essentially four times the volume of subducted trench sediment. Along the CRISP transect we expect the process to be accelerated, possibly as a result of the subduction of the Cocos Ridge.  

3. Characterize fluid/rock interaction, the hydrologic system, and the geochemical processes active within the upper plate.  

We expect that the Cocos Ridge subduction caused extensive fracturing of the upper plate that modified the hydrological system (e.g., flow paths, flow rates, heat flow, and mass transport). Landward-dipping reflectors cutting through the upper plate have been interpreted to connect all the way to the plate boundary. Geochemistry can open a window directly to the seismogenic zone through the analysis of parameters that can be related to chemical reactions or mineral precipitation occurring at seismogenic depths. Fluids are also a key control factor on seismicity because fluid pressure is a physical variable defining the stress state and is a parameter of the effective stress law. Fluid pressure and temperature control the strength and frictional behavior of the rocks. Stress state and deformation processes, in turn, influence porosity and permeability and, consequently, fluid pressure. Hence, measuring the thermal and hydrologic regime is critical. Fluid pressure and temperature may be measured in situ until a depth where the material is semiconsolidated. Laboratory analysis, such as consolidation tests, can give indirect but realistic values of pore pressure.  

4. Measure the stress field along the updip limit of the seismogenic zone.  

The stress field may be inferred from borehole breakouts obtained by LWD. Both GPS investigations and the pattern of microearthquake epicenters indicate a highly stressed area in the vicinity of the Osa Peninsula, implying that relative plate motion in the seismogenic zone is primarily accommodated by coseismic frictional slip. Drilling will contribute to a better definition of the orientation of the horizontal compressive stress in the area. Downhole in situ heat flow measurements will improve our understanding of the thermal regime, allowing better temperature estimates associated with the onset of seismicity as well as allowing us to develop viscoelastic models of deformation.  

Expedition 334 is also considered a stand-alone project providing data to solve longstanding problems related to the tectonics of the region. These primary objectives are  

1. Determining the Cocos Ridge subduction arrival time and its effects on the margin tectonics (e.g., acceleration of tectonic erosion processes); 2. Examining the evolution of the Central America volcanic arc, of which the most relevant effects would be the timing of the progressive shut off of the volcanic arc and the uplift of the Talamanca Cordillera; and 3. Determining the time progression of the death of a volcanic arc and the identification of potential late products. This subject can be explored in detail because we would have at least two sedimentary columns to correlate events and thereby explore the consequences of the time-progressive subduction of the Cocos Ridge.  

# Coring and drilling strategy  

The main aim of Expedition 334 is the thorough characterization of sediment coverage and basement in at least two different sites along the Costa Rica erosive margin offshore the Osa Peninsula: Site U1379 (proposed Site CRIS-4A, alternate Site CRIS11A) above the locked portion of the subduction zone and Site U1378 (proposed Site CRIS-3B, alternate Site CRISP-10A) above the unlocked portion of the subduction zone. Generally, these objectives involved logging and coring as much of the sedimentary sequence and the basement at both sites as possible in the specified time window, and drilling operations were adjusted accordingly.  

The originally proposed drilling strategy determined at the precruise meeting in College Station, Texas (USA), in May 2010 was to begin drilling at Site U1378 followed by Site U1379 and to core two holes at the each site. At both sites, we planned to core the first hole (Hole A) with the advanced piston coring (APC) system to refusal, followed by extended core barrel (XCB) coring to refusal. The estimated refusal depth was $\mathord{\sim}500$ meters below seafloor (mbsf). We planned to drill the second hole (Hole B) at both sites to a depth slightly above the refusal depth of Hole A (e.g., ${\sim}490~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , followed by rotary core barrel (RCB) coring to the target depth (\~950–1000 mbsf). While drilling/coring, we planned to take a number of advanced piston coring temperature tool (APCT-3) and Sediment Temperature Tool (SET)/sediment temperature pressure (SET-P) probe measurements to calculate temperature and pressure gradients at both sites. Core orientation measurements with the Flexit tool were also planned during the APC-cored sections at each site.  

The downhole logging program of Expedition 334 was designed to complement the core sample record at both sites by measuring continuous, in situ profiles of physical properties such as bulk density, porosity, resistivity, and natural gamma radiation. In addition to these formation properties, downhole logging provides oriented images of the borehole wall that are useful for determining the directions of bedding planes, fractures, and borehole breakouts. In the conventional technique of wireline logging, downhole measurements are taken by tools lowered in a previously drilled borehole. Wireline logging has had limited success in deep holes in unconsolidated clastic sequences because these holes tend to be unstable after drilling. It may be difficult to lower wireline tools in an unstable borehole, and hole irregularity can compromise the quality of the measurements. In LWD, downhole measurements are taken by instrumented drill collars in the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) near the drill bit. Hence, LWD measurements are made shortly after the hole is drilled and before the adverse effects of continued drilling or coring operations. LWD has been successful in previous scientific drilling expeditions to convergent margins such as Nankai trough during ODP Leg 196 and IODP Expeditions 314 and 319 (Mikada et al., 2002; Kinoshita et al., 2009; Saffer et al., 2010), Barbados during ODP Legs 156 and 171A (Shipley et al., 1995; Moore et al., 1998), and Costa Rica during ODP Leg 170 (Kimura et al., 1997). LWD was selected as the logging technique for Expedition 334. The LWD equipment used during this expedition was provided by Schlumberger Drilling and Measurements under contract with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Borehole Research Group.  

The Schlumberger LWD tools used during Expedition 334 were the geoVISION 675 (near-bit electrical resistivity, resistivity images, and natural gamma radiation), the arcVISION 675 (annular borehole pressure, resistivity, natural gamma radiation), the adnVISION 675 (bulk density, neutron porosity, an density and ultrasonic caliper), and the measurement-while-drilling (MWD) TeleScope 675. Detailed descriptions of all down hole logging tools can be found at iodp.ldeo.columbia.edu/TOOLS_LABS/ index.html. In addition to collecting drilling mechanics data, the MWD tool also transmits a limited LWD data set by acoustic telemetry to the surface for real-time monitoring. The real-time measurements included the pressure of the borehole fluid in the annulus (the space between the drill string and the borehole wall). During Expedition 334, annular pressure was monitored while drilling to ensure that free gas did not enter the borehole.  

In Expedition 334, LWD measurements were planned to be made in a dedicated hole drilled first at each site. The advantage of this strategy is that detailed physical property logs are available to optimize coring in subsequent holes. The operations plan estimated ${\sim}3$ days/hole for LWD. This time allows for logging the whole sediment section at expected rates of penetration (ROPs) of ${\sim}20~\mathrm{m/h}$ . These are “gross” ROPs that include time for pipe connections. The allotted time is enough to reach the total depth objective in each hole if ROPs in the basement interval can be maintained at ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m/h}$ . If ROPs in the basement are significantly slower, the plan was to log as much as possible of the basement interval given the time constraint of ${\sim}3$ days per LWD hole.  

# Operations  

# Site U1378  

Two holes were drilled or cored at this site (Table T1). The first hole was drilled with a $8\%$ inch drill bit with LWD tools in the BHA to 456.9 mbsf. The next hole was cored with the APC/XCB coring system to 523.9 mbsf. The APCT-3 was deployed four times and useable data was recovered four times. The Flexit tool was deployed on all 16 piston cores in Hole U1378B. All APC holes were cored with nonmagnetic core barrels. Recovery for Site U1378 was $101.4\%$ with the APC system and $100.3\%$ with the XCB system. Overall core recovery for Site U1378 was $100.5\%$ . A total of 63 cores were recovered after coring $523.9\,\mathrm{m}$ . The total length of core recovered at this site was 526.69 m. Hole U1378B was terminated after Core 334-U1378B-63X when hole conditions deteriorated and could not be remediated.  

# First transit to Site U1378  

After an $8.6~\mathrm{h}$ transit from Puntarenas, Costa Rica, covering $94\ \mathrm{nmi}$ and averaging $10.8~\mathrm{kt}$ , speed was reduced and thrusters and hydrophones were lowered. Dynamic positioning was initiated over Site U1378 at $1000\;\mathrm{h}$ (UTC – 6 h) on 17 March 2011. The position reference was a combination of GPS signals and a single acoustic beacon. The positioning beacon was deployed at 1109 h on 17 March. The beacon was left on site for our return after Site U1379. On reoccupation, the beacon was nonresponsive and declared “lost.” Another beacon was deployed at $1204\mathrm{~h~}$ on 2 April and was recovered at $2042\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April.  

# Hole U1378A  

Rig floor operations commenced at $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 March. The trip to the seafloor was uneventful. The top drive was picked up, the drill string was spaced out, and the LWD hole was spudded at $0425\ \mathrm{h}$ on 18 March. After $37.5~\mathrm{h}$ of drilling, Hole U1378A was terminated at 456.9 mbsf. High standpipe pressures, lost circulation, and high torque contributed to the decision to abandon the hole. A wiper trip was attempted, but given the time available versus the progress made to date, the decision was made to terminate Hole U1378A and move to Site U1379 and complete LWD drilling at the second site. After picking up off bottom, the hole was displaced with heavy drilling mud $(10.5\;\mathrm{ppg})$ and the drill string was tripped out of the hole to $\mathord{\sim}640$ meters below rig floor (mbrf) while experiencing high torque and significant overpull. The top drive was set back and the drill string was tripped the rest of the way to surface. The $6\%$ inch drill collars were set back in the derrick. The LWD tools were stored for transit and the rig floor was secured. Thrusters and hydrophones were pulled and the vessel was put into cruise mode, ending Hole U1378A at $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 March.  

# Second transit to Site U1378  

After a $1.25\,\mathrm{h}$ transit from Site U1379 covering 6 nmi and averaging $4.8\,\mathrm{kt}$ , speed was reduced and thrusters and hydrophones were lowered. Dynamic positioning was initiated over Site U1378 at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ (UTC – 6 h) on 2 April. The position reference was a combination of GPS signals and a single acoustic beacon. On reoccupation of Site U1378, the beacon which had been left on bottom was nonresponsive and declared “lost.” Another beacon was deployed at 1204 hours on 2 April and was recovered at $2042\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April.  

# Hole U1378B  

After offsetting the vessel $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west, Hole U1378B was spudded at $1515\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April and advanced with the APC coring system to 127.8 mbsf before refusal. All cores after the fifth core were partial strokes and the hole was advanced by recovery. The coring system was switched to the XCB coring system and coring continued from Core 334- U1378B-17X through 63X. Temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H. Microspheres were run on Cores 20X, 30X, 40X, 50X, and 60X. A total of 16 APC cores were taken with a total recovery of $129.56\mathrm{~m~}$ for an overall APC recovery in Hole U1378B of $101.4\%$ . A total of $47\;\mathrm{XCB}$ cores were taken over a $396.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval, recovering $396.83~\mathrm{m}$ of core for a XCB recovery of $100.3\%$ .  

Coring was terminated after Core 334-U1378B-63X when it became impossible to continue advancing. High top drive torque and lost circulation were major factors. A wiper trip was done to try to clean up the hole, but it was impossible to return to bottom. The hole was terminated, plugged, and then abandoned.  

Total cored interval in Hole U1378B was $523.9\;\mathrm{m}$ with $526.69\:\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered for an APC/XCB combined recovery of $100.5\%$ . Last core on deck for Hole U1378B was at $0035\mathrm{~h~}$ on April 6. After trying to condition the hole for $14.5~\mathrm{h}$ , the decision to abandon the hole was made. The hole was displaced with $10.5\;\mathrm{ppg}$ mud and the drill string was pulled back to 960 mbrf with the top drive in place. The top drive was set back and the remainder of the drill pipe and BHA were tripped back to the surface. The seafloor was cleared at $1850\,\mathrm{h}$ and the bit cleared the rotary table at $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ . The rig was secured for transit and the beacon was recovered at $2042\mathrm{~h~}$ , ending Hole U1378B at $2045~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April.  

# Transit to Site U1379  

After a $1.25\,\mathrm{h}$ transit from Site U1378 covering 6 nmi and averaging $4.8\,\mathrm{kt}$ , speed was reduced and thrusters and hydrophones were lowered. Dynamic positioning was initiated over Site U1379 at $0345\,\mathrm{h}$ (UTC – 6 h) on 20 March 2011. The position reference was a combination of GPS signals and a single acoustic beacon. The positioning beacon was deployed at $1109\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 March and recovered at $0940\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April.  

# Site U1379  

Three holes were drilled or cored at this site (Table T1). The first hole was drilled with a $8\%$ inch drill bit with LWD tools in the BHA. The next hole was drilled with the APC coring system to recover a mudline core and one additional core. The third hole was drilled with the APC coring system to refusal at 91.2 mbsf followed by XCB coring to refusal at 949.0 mbsf (1087.8 mbrf). The APCT-3 was deployed six times and useable data was recovered five times. The Flexit tool was deployed on all APC cores in Hole U1379C, but data was lost from the first 10 cores when a critical computer was turned off during the first tool’s deployment, causing the tool to lose synchronization with the computer. All APC holes were cored with nonmagnetic core barrels. Recovery for Site U1379 was $100.3\%$ with the APC system and $84.4\%$ with the XCB system. Overall core recovery for Site U1379 was $85.9\%$ . A total of 120 cores were recovered after coring $959.5\mathrm{~m~}$ . Total length of core recovered at this site was $824.17\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Hole U1379A  

Rig floor operations commenced at $0345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 March 2011. The trip to the seafloor was uneventful in the very shallow water. The top drive was picked up, the drill string was spaced out, and the LWD hole was spudded at $0955\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 March. After $73\,\mathrm{h}$ of drilling, Hole U1379A was terminated at 962.8 mbsf. After picking up off bottom, the hole was displaced with heavy drilling mud $(10.5\;\mathrm{ppg})$ and the drill string was tripped out of the hole to $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbrf while experiencing high torque and significant overpull. The top drive was set back and the drill string was tripped the rest of the way to surface. The $6\%$ inch drill collars were laid out for offloading in Puntarenas. Data was downloaded from the LWD tools as they were broken down at the rig floor. The LWD tools were then stored for transit and the rig floor was secured. Thrusters and hydrophones were pulled and the vessel was put into cruise mode, ending Hole U1379A at $2254\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 March. The vessel transited to Puntarenas to offload the LWD tools and equipment.  

# Hole U1379B  

After offloading the LWD tools in Puntarenas, the vessel made the $^{9\textrm{h}}$ transit back from Puntarenas, covering $97.2\ \mathrm{nmi}$ and averaging $11.8\ \mathrm{kt}.$ . Speed was reduced and thrusters and hydrophones were lowered. Dynamic positioning was initiated over Site U1379 at $0530~\mathrm{h}$ (UTC – 6 h) on 25 March. After offsetting the vessel $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1379A, Hole U1379B was spudded at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ . The mudline core established seafloor depth at 138.5 mbrf. APC coring continued until 10.5 mbsf. Two cores were taken with a total recovery of $8.72\,\mathrm{m}$ for an overall recovery in Hole U1379B of $83.0\%$ . The drill string was tripped to just above the mud line, clearing the seafloor at 1030 h on 25 March, ending Hole U1379B.  

# Hole U1379C  

After offsetting the vessel $20\textrm{m}$ north, Hole U1379C was spudded at $1255\mathrm{~h~}$ on 25 March and advanced with the APC coring system to 91.2 mbsf before refusal. All cores after the second core were partial strokes and the hole was advanced by recovery. The coring system was switched to the XCB coring system and coring continued from Core 334-U1379C-18X through Core 118X. Temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 12H, 13H, and 16H. Microspheres were run on Cores 20X, 30X, 40X, 50X, 60X, 75X, 92X, 105X, and 107X. A total of 17 APC cores were taken with a total recovery of $91.92\;\mathrm{m}$ $(100.8\%)$ . A total of 101 XCB cores were taken over a $857.8\;\mathrm{m}$ interval, recovering $723.64\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(84.4\%)$ .  

After reviewing the LWD penetration rates, which remained high into the basement section of Hole U1379A, and given the high recovery rates of the XCB system, a decision was made to push the XCB system into the basement section of Hole U1379C. XCB core recovery continued to be excellent until basement was reached. After Core 334-U1379C-104X, the recovery dropped off as we experienced soft to hard to soft formation changes. Average recovery after Core 103X through 118X at 949 mbsf was $19.8\%$ . Average XCB recovery prior to Core 104X was $89.2\%$ .  

Total cored interval in Hole U1379C was $949.0\;\mathrm{m}$ with $815.56\,\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered for an APC/XCB combined recovery of $85.9\%$ . Last core on deck for Hole U1379C was at $0130~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April 2. The hole was displaced with $10.5~\mathrm{ppg}$ mud and the drill string was pulled back to 565 mbrf with the top drive in place. High torque $>\!500$ amps) and overpull were observed all the way to 565 mbrf. At 565 mbrf, the top drive was set back and the remainder of the drill pipe and BHA were tripped back to the surface. The seafloor was cleared at $0755\,\mathrm{h}$ and the bit cleared the rotary table at $0910\,\mathrm{h}$ . The rig was secured for transit and the beacon was recovered at $0941\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , ending Hole U1379C at $0945\;\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April.  

# Transit to Site U1380  

After a move in dynamic positioning mode from Site U1378, the vessel stabilized over Site U1380 (proposed Site CRIS-10A) at $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ (UTC – 6 h) on 6 April 2011. The position reference was a combination of GPS signals and a single acoustic beacon. The positioning beacon was deployed at $2142\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April and recovered at $1930\;\mathrm{h}$ on 8 April.  

# Site U1380  

A single hole was drilled at this site to a depth of 397.0 mbsf (Table T1) with a $9\%$ inch RCB core bit with the center bit installed. The center bit was pulled and RCB coring began at 397.0 mbsf. Coring continued through Core 334-U1380A-10R to 482.4 mbsf. At that point, it became difficult to circulate and high torque was observed on the top drive. A decision was made to make a wiper trip to remediate the poor hole conditions. It was necessary to pull back from 997.4 to 853.0 mbrf before normal circulation and torque were restored. After attempting to return to bottom from 853.0 mbrf, the bit started taking weight at 920.0 mbrf. High torque and lost circulation made it impossible to return to bottom. At $1500\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , preparations began to abandon Hole U1380A. The core barrel was retrieved and the hole was displaced with $120\,\mathrm{bbl}$ of 10.5 ppg mud. Overall core recovery for Site U1380 was $61.6\%$ . Nine cores were recovered after coring $85.4~\mathrm{m}$ . The total length of core recovered at this site was $52.37\textrm{m}$ . Hole U1380A was terminated after Core 334-U1380A-10R when hole conditions deteriorated and could not be remediated.  

# Hole U1380A  

Rig floor operations commenced at $2135\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 April 2011. The RCB BHA was made up with a Rock Bit International (RBI) ${\mathrm{C}}{-}4~\mathrm{RCB}$ bit and mechanical bit release. The trip to the seafloor was uneventful. The top drive was picked up, the drill string was spaced out, and the hole was spudded at $0215\mathrm{~h~}$ on 7 April. After $19.5~\mathrm{h}$ of drilling with the center bit installed, the center bit was pulled and a RCB core barrel was dropped and coring began.  

Coring was terminated after Core 334-U1380A-10R when it became impossible to continue advancing. High top drive torque and lost circulation were major factors. A wiper trip was done to try to clean up the hole, but it was impossible to return to bottom and the hole was terminated, plugged, and then abandoned.  

Total drilled interval was $397.0\ \mathrm{m}$ . Total cored interval in Hole U1380A was $85.4~\mathrm{m}$ with $52.37\textrm{m}$ of core recovered for an RCB system recovery of $61.3\%$ . Last core on deck for Hole U1380A was at $1005\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 April. After trying to condition the hole for $5.0\;\mathrm{h}$ , the decision to abandon the hole was made. The hole was displaced with 10.5 ppg mud and the drill string was pulled back to 824 mbrf with the top drive in place. The top drive was set back and the remainder of the drill pipe and BHA were tripped back to the surface. The seafloor was cleared at $1730\,\mathrm{h}$ and the bit cleared the rotary table at $1905\,\mathrm{h}$ . The beacon was recovered at $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ and the rig was secured for transit at $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1380A and Site U1380 on 8 April.  

# Transit to Site U1381  

After a $11.4\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1381 from Site U1380, the vessel stabilized over Site U1381 (proposed Site CRIS-1A) at $2133~\mathrm{h}$ (UTC – 6 h) on 8 April 2011. The position reference was a combination of GPS signals and a single acoustic beacon. The positioning beacon was deployed at $2152\mathrm{~h~}$ on 8 April and recovered at $1527~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 April.  

# Site U1381  

Two holes were cored at this site (Table T1). Hole U1381A was cored to 164.1 mbsf with a $9\%$ inch RCB core bit and a $171.13\mathrm{~m~}$ long BHA. Coring continued through Core 334-U1381A-26R to 164.1 mbsf. Coring was terminated at 0045 on 12 April 2011. Hole U1381B had two major objectives. The first objective was to establish a temperature gradient for the sediment section above oceanic crust. The second objective was to take samples for geochemistry and microbiology in the uppermost $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. SET-P temperature measurements were taken at $\mathord{\sim}30$ , 50, 70, and 90 mbsf. Overall core recovery for Site U1381 was $46.5\%$ . A total of 29 cores were recovered after coring $193.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . The total length of core recovered at this site was $89.84\mathrm{~m~}$ . Hole U1381B was terminated after drilled interval 334-U1380B-43 after the last temperature measurement was made at ${\sim}90$ mbsf.  

# Hole U1381A  

Rig floor operations commenced at $2133\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 8 April 2011. The RCB BHA was made up with a RBI C-4 RCB bit and mechanical bit release. The trip to the seafloor was uneventful. The top drive was picked up, the drill string was spaced out, and the hole was spudded at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 April. Coring continued for $69.25\,\mathrm{h}$ and was terminated after Core 334-U1381A-26R to move to Hole U1381B.  

Total cored interval in Hole U1381A was $164.1\;\mathrm{m}$ with $73.86\mathrm{~m~}$ of core recovered for an RCB system recovery of $45.0\%$ . Last core on deck for Hole U1381A was at $0045\;\mathrm{h}$ on 12 April. The hole was displaced with 50 bbl of 10.5 ppg mud, and the drill string was pulled back to just above the seafloor with the top drive in place. The seafloor was cleared at $0220\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1381A.  

# Hole U1381B  

After offsetting the vessel $20\,\mathrm{m}$ west, Hole U1381B was spudded at $0325\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 April and advanced with the RCB coring system to 29.0 mbsf before running the SET-P tool. Three RCB cores were taken in Hole U1381B with a $15.98\;\mathrm{m}$ recovery. The cores were taken without circulation and were essentially punch cores. At 29.0 mbsf, the SET-P tool was run on wireline and the first measurement was taken. The hole was then advanced without recovery to 50 mbsf. The core barrel was pulled and the SET-P was again lowered by wireline to take the second measurement. The procedure was repeated for measurements at 71 and 91 mbsf. After the last temperature measurement was taken, the hole was displaced with $10.5\;\mathrm{ppg}$ heavy mud and the drill string was pulled back to surface. The rotary bit cleared the seafloor at $1440~\mathrm{h}$ and cleared the rotary table at $1835\ \mathrm{h}$ . The beacon was recovered at $1527~\mathrm{h}$ and the rig was secured for transit at $1857\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1381B and Site U1381 on 12 April. The vessel left Site U1381 on a $100.6\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Puntarenas after completing operations during Expedition 334.  

# Site summaries  

# Site U1378  

Site U1378 was drilled into the middle slope of the Costa Rica margin, $41\,\mathrm{km}$ offshore Osa Peninsula along BGR99 Line 7 (Fig. F2) above the unlocked portion of the plate boundary according to interplate earthquake relocation and geodetic measurements (S.L. Bilek, pers. comm., 2003; LaFemina et al., 2009). The margin here consists of an upper plate basement underlying about $750\,\mathrm{m}$ thick slope sediments. The seismic sections show that this site is above the seaward edge of one of the high-amplitude reflectors interpreted as displacement surfaces. Site U1378 was designed to penetrate one of these surfaces. The primary purpose of drilling Site U1378 was to determine the nature, composition, and physical properties of the upper plate basement and to understand the nature of the landward-dipping seismic reflectors. Two holes were drilled at this site, Holes U1378A and U1378B, penetrating 456.9 and $523.9\mathrm{~m~}$ into the seafloor, respectively. Hole U1378A was dedicated to LWD operations to measure the in situ physical properties of the material in the borehole. Hole U1378B was designed to retrieve as much of the sediment coverage and basement as possible within the specified time window. Overall, $526.39\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment were retrieved with an average total recovery of $100.48\%$ . The basement was not reached in any of the holes because drilling was terminated early as a result of unfavorable hole conditions.  

Based on lithologic characteristics, the sediments recovered at Site U1378 can be divided into two main lithostratigraphic units (Fig. F7). Unit I, ${\sim}128\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, is composed of mainly soft, dark greenish gray, terrigenous silty clay. Intercalated in this silty clay is a series of $\leq\!5\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick fining-upward sequences consisting of lithic sands and 21 tephra layers ranging in thickness from 0.5 to $7\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The basal boundary between the silty clay and the sand and tephra sequences are sharp, whereas the top boundaries are gradational. Unit II, ${\sim}385.73\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, consists predominantly of massive,  well  consolidated,  olive-green  terrigeneous  clayey  silt(stone)  and  silty clay(stone) with minor layers of sand(stone), sandy silty clay(stone), clay, clayey silt(stone), and 61 tephra layers that remain unlithified to 560 mbsf. The basal contact between the background sedimentation and the tephra layers is sharp, whereas the top contact is gradational. Within this monotonous sequence, sandy intervals become thicker and more common with depth. Throughout all of Unit II, fining- and coarsening-upward decimeter-scale sequences of sand are present. In the coarser sand layers, rip-up clasts, rounded clay lenses, and abundant shell fragments are commonly observed. Framboidal pyrite was observed in many of the smear slides throughout Unit II. Horizons of abundant calcareous concretions or lithified carbonate mud clasts are rare and concentrated within a $2\;\mathrm{m}$ interval of Core 334-U1378B27X (Sections 334-U1378B-27X-4 through 27X-CC; 222.08–224.41 mbsf).  

The 82 identified tephra layers seem to be quite heterogeneous in composition, 30 of which are light gray to pinkish/brownish white felsic tephras, 40 are pinkish gray/ brown more mafic tephras, and 12 are pinkish/greenish black mafic tephras. Mafic tephra beds account for ${\sim}15\%$ of the total tephra bed assemblage in Hole U1378B. The felsic tephra layers are mainly $(>\!90\;\mathrm{vol\%})$ ) composed of fresh, clear, colorless, fine to coarse ash-sized glass shards varying from angular blocky, cuspate, flat, and Y-shaped shards with nearly no bubbles to highly vesicular, pumiceous textures with many elongated bubbles. Dark gray mafic ash layers consist predominantly of dark to light brown glass shards. Most of the glass shards have blocky shapes and are medially to poorly vesicular and show strong signs of alteration, especially in the deeper part of the hole.  

Generally, the sediment cored in Hole U1378B is characterized by low-angle bedding planes $(<\!30^{\circ})$ as well as by healed and open faults with relatively steep dipping angles. Sediment-filled vein structures were observed from 262.2 mbsf downward. The main fault populations, characterized by zones of intense brecciation and sediment deformation, occur at 279.2–281.4, 361.9–376.5, 475.9–477.2, and $514.2~\mathrm{mbsf}$ to an unknown lower boundary. The second fault zone shows the most intensive deformation and corresponds to a low-density/high-porosity interval identified by LWD.  

Preliminary X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the sediment suggests that there is little variation in mineralogical composition among the different lithostratigraphic units. XRD data indicate that the major mineral components are clay minerals including illite, smectite, kaolinite, and attapulgite, as well as calcite, anorthite, and quartz. Amphibole (hornblende and richterite), chlorite, pyroxene (augite and hypersthene), olivine, and pyrite peaks are present.  

The physical property data obtained from cored material display expected behavior with depth and reflect the different units cored (Fig. F7). Physical property measurements were made after sediment cores reached thermal equilibrium with ambient temperature at $\sim\!20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Wet bulk density values increase with depth, likely a result of dewatering caused by overburden pressure and are well described by a linear trend. A small offset in wet bulk density values marks the boundary between lithostratigraphic Units I and II. Grain densities are relatively constant with depth, with an average value of $2.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ; however, they are quite variable in Unit II, ranging between 2.5 and $2.9\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . There is no discernible offset between values characterizing lithostratigraphic Units I and II. On the whole, these values suggest a terrigenous origin. Porosity, inversely correlated with bulk density, decreases from ${\sim}70\%$ at the seafloor to $40\%$ at the bottom of the hole. A slight increase in porosity between Units I and II corresponds to the decrease in wet bulk density at this boundary. An increase of porosity is observed at ${\sim}440$ mbsf and corresponds to a sandy interval. Porosity increases a few percent between $\mathord{\sim}480$ and 529 mbsf and may correspond to a decrease in the clay content. Magnetic susceptibility in the sedimentary sequence is low, indicating an abundance of noniron-bearing clays and scarcity of magnetic minerals. However, a region of generally higher values is present between ${\sim}85$ and 195 mbsf. Other notable regions of relatively high values occur at 335, 355, 440, and 460 mbsf. These excursions show high–wave number variability and may be due to lithologic variations between sands, silts, and clays. NGR values indicate a small positive trend through lithostratigraphic Unit I and are relatively constant through Unit II. Notable excursions to higher values in Unit II occur at $\mathord{\sim}200$ and 480 mbsf. The lowermost NGR high is associated with scoria and a high abundance of mafic glass particles. Thermal conductivity measurements show that the thermal conductivity generally increases with depth and is inversely correlated with porosity. In the upper $100\;\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , variability is significant and likely reflects gas concentrations in the core. Downhole temperature measurements using the APCT-3 show a linear equilibrium temperature increase; coupled with the average bottom water temperature and thermal conductivity measurements, they give a least-squares geothermal gradient of $51.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ and a heat flow of $44\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . This value is consistent with forearc values of heat flow.  

Generally, all the observations summarized above are consistent with changing depositional conditions in a more downslope environment. The cover sequence recovered from Hole U1378B is a terrestrially sourced slope sequence that is consistent with high sediment accumulation rates throughout the depositional interval. Recognition of wood debris and thin layers $\langle5\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick) of normal graded sands with sharp erosional bases within Unit I at this site are consistent with deposition in the distal facies of a clastic turbidite sequence.  

This similarity is also consistent with the results of shipboard studies of calcareous nannofossils and foraminifers. Biogenic components in the cored sediments have a bimodal distribution in Unit II. Whereas shell fragments, diatoms, and nannofossils are sparse but ubiquitous throughout the unit, foraminifers are partly enriched within the sediments and are a major constituent of the sand-sized fraction. Based on nannofossil biostratigraphy, the sediments of the basal core were most likely deposited in the lower Pleistocene, thus the sediments throughout the core are younger than $2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . The sequence between 5.36 and 224.39 mbsf is assigned to the undifferentiated Zones NN21–NN20 of the late to middle Pleistocene based on the presence of Emiliania huxleyi in Sample 334-U1378B-1H-CC (5.36 mbsf) and the absence of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa. Good preservation allows the tentative identification of E. huxleyi in Sections 334-U1378B-1H-CC (5.36 mbsf) through 16H-CC (127.91 mbsf). Samples 28X-CC $(237.47~\mathrm{mbsf})$ through 63X-CC are assigned to Zone NN20 based on the last occurrence (LO) of $P.$ lacunosa in Sample 28X-CC (237.47 mbsf) and the absence of Discoaster brouweri. Sample 57X-CC (476.18 mbsf) contains the first occurrence of early Pleistocene marker Helicosphaera sellii. Dominant species include Helicosphaera carteri,  

Gephryocapsa oceanica, Gephryocapsa caribbeanica, Gephryocapsa small, and Calcidiscus leptoporus. Thus, averaged sedimentation rates are ${\sim}516$ and $236\;\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ . in the upper ( $(237$ mbsf) and lower parts $237{\sim}524~\mathrm{mbsf})$ of the hole, respectively.  

Although the boundary of planktonic foraminiferal zones was not established, a few occurrence horizons of index species are approximately concordant with nannofossil zonation. Planktonic foraminifers, which are common to rare in the upper part of Hole U1378B, are mainly dominated by tropical fauna such as Globigerinoides quadrilobatus (Globigerinoides sacculifer), Globigerinoides ruber, Orbulina universa, Globorotalia menardii, and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. Two index marker species of planktonic foraminifers were identified in limited horizons. Sample 334-U1378B-5H-CC (43.77 mbsf) contained pink G. ruber (last appearance at $0.12\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ), whereas Sample 4H-CC (34.62 mbsf) did not contain the pink specimen. Thus, marine isotope Stage 5e is located in the interval between these two samples, and the horizons are assigned to foraminiferal Zone PT1. Coiling change of Pulleniatina from sinistral to dextral was observed in Samples 42X-CC (351.71 mbsf) through 30X-CC (245.19 mbsf). Thus, the sediments from Section 42X-CC are older than $0.8\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Benthic foraminifers are abundant in the upper part of Hole U1378B; abundances in the lower parts are variable and range from common to rare. Generally, the majority of the observed benthic foraminiferal species are similar to modern assemblages, which are characteristic for the oxygen minimum zone in this region. Thus, the benthic foraminiferal community observed in the sediment of this hole are dominated by bathyal species. In general, the upper part of cored sediment at this site contains Pseudoparrella bradyana, Trifarina carinata, Valvulineria inflata, Cassidulina limbata, Uvigerina, and Gyroidina. Bolivina is characteristic for the upper to middle bathyal environment. In contrast to this, the sediments of the lower part of this site ${>}209.28$ mbsf) contain species characteristic of a greater water depth (Uvigerina hispida, Melonis barleeanus, Gyroidina, and Oridorsalis umbonatus). Generally, the faunal changes observed at this site reflect continuous environmental changes from upper slope to middle slope.  

Paleomagnetic investigations partially support Pleistocene deposition ages of the cored sediments. Remanent magnetization was measured on archive-half cores and discrete samples taken from the working half recovered from Hole U1378B. All archive-half cores were demagnetized in an alternating field (AF) to $15~\mathrm{mT}$ and measured with the pass-through magnetometer, whereas discrete samples were subjected to complete stepwise AF demagnetization and measured in both the SRM and a JR6 magnetometer. Cores 334-U1378B-1H through 16H were cored with the APC system using a nonmagnetic cutting shoe and oriented with the Flexit orientation tool. Cores 17X through 63X were cored with the XCB system using a standard cutting shoe. For the APC cores, inclination data from neither archive half sections nor discrete sample measurements show any sign of reversed polarity magnetization. Declination data corrected by the Flexit tool cluster near the present day geomagnetic North. Thus, the sediments in the APC cores $_{<127.8}$ mbsf) were deposited within the Brunhes period $(<\!0.78\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . This age assignment is consistent with the shipboard micropaleontological data, which suggest that the foraminifer fossil G. ruber (pink) found in Core 5H may be $0.125\;\mathrm{Ma}$ in age. Paleomagnetic measurements on the XCB cores are severely affected by drilling-induced remagnetization and inconclusive, but so far they have not revealed any reversed polarity. NRM intensities correlate with magnetic susceptibility data, suggesting some of the downhole susceptibility variation reflects change in magnetic minerals.  

The geochemical trends displayed by the analyzed pore water (82 whole rounds) and gas samples (65 headspace samples, 99 void gas samples, and 173 gas samples) are reflecting the different materials cored and present at the basement (Fig. F7). The pore fluid profiles of sulfate, alkalinity, ammonium, methane, and Ca in the upper 20 mbsf at this site reflect typical changes associated with organic carbon cycling. Sulfate concentrations decrease almost linearly from the seafloor to the sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ) at ${\sim}13$ mbsf, whereas alkalinity increases from a seawater value at the seafloor to a maximum at 24 mbsf. Likewise, ammonium concentrations increase in the zone of active $\mathrm{{SO}_{4}}$ reduction and reach a local maximum below the SMTZ at 24 mbsf, reflecting on-going organic matter diagenesis. Calcium concentrations decrease from seawater value at the seafloor in this zone, reflecting the precipitation of authigenic carbonates. The highest methane concentrations are observed just below the SMTZ between 14.1 and 23.6 mbsf. The gas at these depths results from biogenic production, as indicated by the high ratio of methane to heavier homologues (ethane and propane), with $\mathrm{CH}_{4}/(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}\,+\,\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{8})$ values ranging from 8,000 to 15,000. From 20.7 to $200\ \mathrm{mbsf}$ , the ratio mainly steadily decreases and is interpreted as a mixing zone between shallow biogenic and deep-sourced thermogenic gas transported upward by diffusion.  

From 100 to ${\sim}440~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , salinity, Cl, Mg, K, B, and Na concentrations mainly show a monotonic decrease with depth (Fig. F7). Dissolved Ca concentrations are variable to $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf and increase with depth to a peak concentration at 440 mbsf that is coincident with minima in Cl, Mg, and K concentrations. Silica concentrations are variable with depth, and there is a concentration maximum at 300 mbsf and minima at 100 and 460 mbsf in the same interval as the maxima in Ca concentrations. Collectively, the pore fluid chemical profiles suggest there is a unique fluid between 420 and 500 mbsf characterized by relatively low salinity, Cl, Mg, K, alkalinity, Si, and Sr concentrations and elevated Ca concentrations. This depth interval also corresponds to a marked increase in thermogenic hydrocarbons (propane, $_n$ -butane, and iso-butane). The in situ temperature at this depth is too cold for local generation of thermogenic hydrocarbons, suggesting lateral migration of a fluid sourced in a region with temperatures high enough to support clay dehydration and thermogenic hydrocarbon production.  

The three samples recovered below 500 mbsf show a steep depth gradient in salinity and chloride, indicating diffusional communication with another fluid below the cored section. Since the Cl and salinity profiles decrease below $500~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , this fluid must be fresher than the deeper sourced fluid sampled between 420 and $500~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . Ethane, propane, and iso- and $_n$ -butane all show maxima at 518.7 mbsf. Corresponding with the increasing concentrations and maxima of these higher chain hydrocarbons $(C_{2+})$ , the $\mathrm{CH}_{4}/(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}+\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{8})$ ratios indicate the dominance of thermogenic gas at depth in Hole U1378B.  

Results from LWD generally correspond to the lithostratigraphic observations as well as to the physical property data obtained from the cored sediments. The LWD tools deployed in the hole included the adnVISION 675 (density, neutron, and ultrasonic caliper), the TeleScope 675 (MWD; power and data transmission and drilling parameters), the arcVISION 675 (propagation resistivity, gamma radiation, and annular pressure), and the geoVISION 675 (resistivity images and gamma radiation). The measurements recorded by the LWD tools were downloaded and processed successfully, except for the geoVISION resistivity image data.  

Two logging units were defined on the basis of the LWD measurements. Logging Unit 1 (0–82 mbsf) corresponds to a compacting sequence where density and resistivity increase and porosity decreases with depth, reaching $\sim\!1.6\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , $1\,\Omega\mathrm{m}$ , and $60\%$ porosity at the base of the unit. The top of logging Unit 2 (82–455 mbsf) is marked by a step increase in density and resistivity, which then increase slowly with depth (from 1.8 $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$ and just above $1\;\Omega\mathbf{m}$ at the top to $1.9\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and just below $2\,\Omega\mathbf{m}$ at the bottom of the unit). Porosity shows a matching small decrease with depth, from $55\%$ at the top of logging Unit 2 to $45\%$ at the base.  

The adnVISION tool collected oriented images of bulk density and borehole radius. Despite its limited azimuthal resolution (image data are sampled in 16 azimuthal sectors, i.e., every $22.5^{\circ})$ ), the images display well-defined vertical bands of large borehole radius in the interval 110–438 mbsf, interpreted as borehole breakouts caused by differences in the principal horizontal stresses. The average azimuth of the breakouts is roughly northeast–southwest to east-northeast–west-southwest, indicating that the maximum horizontal stress is oriented northwest–southeast to north-northwest– south-southeast.  

# Site U1379  

Site U1379 was drilled in the upper slope of the Costa Rica margin, $28.2\,\mathrm{km}$ offshore Osa Peninsula and Caño Island along BGR99 Line 7 (Fig. F2). The site is located above the locked portion of the plate boundary according to interplate earthquake relocation and geodetic measurements (Bilek, 2003; LaFemina et al., 2009). The margin here consists of an upper plate basement underlying ${\sim}890~\mathrm{m}$ thick slope sediments. The primary purpose of drilling Site U1379 is to determine the nature, composition, and physical properties of the upper plate basement. This site is also designed as a “pilot hole” in preparation for proposed deeper CRISP Program B drilling at this location. Three holes were drilled or cored at Site U1379 penetrating 960, 10.5, and $949\;\mathrm{m}$ into the seafloor. Hole U1379A was dedicated to LWD operations to measure in situ physical properties of the material in the borehole. The hole was drilled with an $8\%$ inch drill bit with LWD tools in the BHA. Hole U1379B, drilled with the APC system, was completely dedicated to high-resolution geochemical and microbiology sampling to precisely determine the depth of the SMTZ and the associated microbiological changes. Hole U1379C was designed to retrieve as much sediment and basement core as possible within the specified time window. It was drilled with the APC system to refusal at 91.2 mbsf, followed by the XCB system to a refusal depth of 949.0 mbsf. The APCT-3 was deployed six times and useable data were recovered five times. The Flexit orientation tool was deployed on all APC cores in Hole U1379C, but data were lost from the first 10 cores when a critical computer was turned off during the first tool’s deployment, causing the tool to lose synchronization with the computer. All APC holes were cored with nonmagnetic core barrels. Core recovery for Site U1379 was $100.3\%$ with APC and $84.4\%$ with XCB. Overall, $804\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and $12\,\mathrm{m}$ of basement were retrieved, despite the difficult drilling conditions in the basement.  

Based on lithologic characteristics, the sediments recovered from Hole U1379C are divided, from top to bottom, into five lithostratigraphic units (Fig. F8). Unit I, the relatively thin top unit, consists of medium- to coarse-grained sand with abundant shell fragments. It is worth noting that Unit I observed in this hole is not the same lithostratigraphic unit as Unit I in Hole U1378B. Unit II, ${\sim}650\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, is composed of mainly olive-green clayey silt(stone) and silty clay(stone) with minor layers of sand(stone), sandy silty clay(stone), clay, clayey silt(stone), and tephra. The sediments in this unit are massive and well consolidated; the tephra layers are unlithified. Superimposed on the main background sedimentation of Unit II are three different subunits mainly consisting of consolidated clay, clayey silt with intercalated carbonate and dolomite concretions, and fining- and coarsening-upward decimeter-scale sequences of silty sands and sandstone, respectively. Generally, the deposits of Unit II in this hole are lithostratigraphically similar to the clay-rich deposits of Unit II observed in Hole U1378B. Nonetheless, the difference between the abundance of calcareous concretions or lithified carbonate mud clasts observed at this site compared to Site U1378 is striking. Unit III is ${\sim}229\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and consists of fining- and coarseningupward sequences (decimeter thick) of olive-green silty sands and sandstone. Smear slides indicate that the sandstones are dominated by lithic clasts composed of magmatic rock fragments and feldspar minerals. Chlorite is the most abundant accessory mineral and is followed, in decreasing order of abundance, by volcanic glass, opaque minerals, and amphibole. Trace abundances of calcite, pyroxene, and quartz are present. Tephra layers are sparse in this unit, accumulating mainly in one sequence within the upper part of the unit. Unit IV ( ${\sim}2\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) consists of carbonate-cemented medium- to coarse-grained sand with well-rounded, lithic pebble- sized clasts and thickwalled shell shards. Unit V is ${\sim}67~\mathrm{m}$ thick and is composed of matrix-supported breccia with clasts of limestone, basalt, and mudstone in a fine sandy matrix intercalated with basalt in the upper part $\mathrm{(881.75{-}906.72\ m b s f)}$ and a sequence of variably sandy and clayey silt in the lower part $(916.40–947.52\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ). The basalt ranges from aphyric to moderately phyric, containing plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine phenocrysts and showing minor signs of alteration along veins.  

Overall, 53 tephra layers $2{-}45\ \mathrm{cm}$ thick) have been identified intercalated in the background sedimentation of the different units, the majority of them below 324 mbsf. Smear slides indicate that most tephras consist of felsic glass shards varying from angular blocky, cuspate, flat, and Y-shaped shards with nearly no bubbles to highly vesicular, pumiceous textures with commonly elongated bubbles. The transparent glass shards of the felsic tephras are mostly fresh without any signs of alteration until Core 334-U1379C-60X. Below this core, divitrification structures increase with depth within the glass shards, reflecting differing levels of alteration. Grain size ranges from very fine to coarse ash (up to millimeter size). Identified mineral assemblages consist of plagioclase, pyroxene, hornblende, and biotite. Plagioclase is the dominant phase, but some tephras are dominated by amphibole and biotite, which normally occurs in the most evolved felsic layers. The few observed dark gray mafic ash layers are predominantly composed of dark to light brown glass shards. Most of the glass shards are blocky and are medium to poorly vesicular and show strong signs of alteration, especially in the deeper part of the hole. The mineral assemblages of the mafic tephras include plagioclase, pyroxene, and spinel. In contrast to felsic tephras, mafic tephras contain more crystals. In general, tephra layers have a sharp basal contact to underlying terrigenous sediment but a gradual transition with overlying ashbearing terrigeneous sediment, and many are normally graded in grain size and well sorted.  

The structural characteristics of the cored sediments can be divided into three zones corresponding to the upper and lower part of the sedimentary sequences and to Unit V, respectively. The upper part of the sedimentary sequences and the basement represent zones of gently dipping bedding planes and poor fault populations. Several healed normal faults and layer-parallel faults, likely formed during early stage deformation, were found in the upper part of the sedimentary sequences (lithostratigraphic Unit II). A zone with steep bedding dips and increased fault populations characterizes the lower part of the sedimentary sequences, below 597 mbsf. This part contains at least four fault zones composed of brecciated zones, fracture zones, and weakly deformed zones. The first fault zone (642.1–652.8 mbsf) corresponds to the lowermost section of lithostratigraphic Unit II and to considerably low density and high-porosity intervals identified by LWD.  

Even though, macroscopically, these sediments seem to be heterogeneous, XRD analytical results indicate that there is little variation in mineralogical composition across the lithostratigraphic units described. XRD spectra indicate that the major mineral components are calcite, anorthite, and quartz, with amphibole, chlorite, pyroxene, olivine, and pyrite accessory minerals. Although very few monocrystalline quartz grains were seen in the smear slides, it may be possible that other silica-rich components (sedimentary and magmatic lithic fragments) are producing this signal.  

These findings are generally reflected by physical property data obtained on the cored material (Fig. F8). Bulk density values were determined from both gamma ray attenuation (GRA) measurements on whole cores and mass/volume measurements on discrete samples from the working halves of split cores. In general, values of wet bulk density determined from whole-round GRA measurements and measurements from discrete samples agree well. Wet bulk density increases with depth, increasing more rapidly in the upper section than in the lower section, likely a result of dewatering caused by overburden pressure. Bulk density values in the brecciated basement are ${\sim}2.3\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Grain densities determined from discrete samples are relatively homogeneous, ranging between 2.6 and $2.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Measured porosities within the sediment section are inversely correlated with bulk density, decreasing with increasing depth. Magnetic susceptibilities are, with two exceptions, low and uniform, indicating an abundance of noniron-bearing clays and scarcity of magnetic minerals. Basement values of magnetic susceptibility are overall quite low considering absolute values; it is unlikely that this material contributes to any magnetic anomalies. Measured natural gamma ray values are relatively uniform to about Core 334-U1379C-78X, below which they start to decrease, consistent with the observed downward increase of sandy sediments and the increase in grain density. NGR values in the basement are mainly low, consistent with the sandy lithologies described in this interval. $P\cdot$ -wave velocities show a sharp increase from the sediment coverage into the basement, reflecting the low porosity and high consolidation of the sediments. Thermal conductivity increases with depth and is inversely correlated to porosity. Measured downhole temperatures using the APCT-3 show a relatively linear increase of equilibrium temperatures with depth. Coupling these temperatures with the average bottom water temperature as well as with the measured thermal conductivity results in a leastsquares geothermal gradient of $41.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ and a heat flow of $40\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2},$ , which is consistent with forearc values of heat flow.  

Generally, the observations summarized above are consistent with changing depositional conditions in a forearc basin that may range from a near-shore environment to shelf sediments to upper slope sediments (turbidites) interrupted by calcareous mud debris from close fluid-venting areas. The calcareous microfossil community identified in the cored sediments also supports this interpretation.  

Shipboard studies of calcareous nannofossils and foraminifers are generally used to further constrain the depositional environment and ages of the cored sediments. Calcareous nannofossils provided excellent biostratigraphic control for most of the cored section. All observed microfossils are characteristic of the Pleistocene. Based on nannofossil biostratigraphy, sediments retrieved from the lowest core seem to have been deposited in the lowermost Pleistocene. Thus, the sediments throughout the core would be younger than $2.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , resulting in an average sediment accumulation rate for the upper $\mathrm{\sim}566\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ and the middle part (566\~722 mbsf) of the section of $\mathord{\sim}1230$ and $100\ \mathrm{m/m.y.}$ , respectively. Although the boundary of planktonic foraminifers could not be established, a few occurring horizons of index species are approximately concordant with nannofossil zonation. The faunal changes observed in the benthic foraminiferal community reflect continuous environmental changes from continental shelf to upper slope (middle bathyal).  

Paleomagnetic investigations partially support Pleistocene deposition ages and the high sediment accumulation rates. Stepwise AF demagnetization was performed on all archive-half sections (to $30\,\mathrm{mT}$ ), and discrete samples were taken from the working half. For APC cores, inclination data from neither archive-half sections nor discrete sample measurements show any sign of reversed polarity magnetization. Declination data do not show near- $\cdot180^{\circ}$ shifts within each core. Thus, the sediments in the APC cores $(<\!91.2\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) were deposited within the Brunhes period $(<\!0.78\;\mathrm{Ma})$ .  

Paleomagnetic measurements on XCB cores are severely affected by drilling-induced remagnetization and are inconclusive. From the pass-through measurements of archive-half sections, one interval at ${\sim}701{-}704$ mbsf (Section 334-U1379C-83X-3 through the top part of 83X-4) show dominantly reversed polarity after AF demagnetization. Biostratigraphic Zone NN19 of the early Pleistocene is placed at this interval. Using calcareous nannoplankton zonal schemes of the eastern equatorial Pacific for the lower boundary of Zone NN19 $(2.3\mathrm{~Ma})$ , this observed reversed polarity should correlate with Chron C1r.2r (1.185–1.778 Ma). If true, this would suggest a rapid sediment accumulation rate $(>388\mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{y}.)$ .  

NRM intensities correlate with magnetic susceptibility data, suggesting some of the downhole susceptibility variation reflects change in magnetic minerals.  

The geochemical trends displayed by the analyzed pore water samples (110 whole rounds), interstitial gas samples (118 sediment plug samples), and void gas samples (74 samples) are also consistent with the different materials cored (Fig. F8). The upper 50 mbsf at this site reflects typical changes associated with organic carbon cycling. Alkalinity and ammonium increase from seawater values to maxima at 12 mbsf, reflecting organic matter diagenesis. At ${\sim}14~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , the sulfate gradient decreases, associated with a concomitant decrease in ammonium concentrations and decrease in the alkalinity gradient. Based on the sulfate data, the depth of the SMTZ is estimated to be $\mathord{\sim}30$ mbsf. This zone is characterized by a decrease in dissolved Ca, suggesting authigenic carbonate precipitation between 20 and 30 mbsf. Below the SMTZ, methane concentrations increase with depth and reach the highest concentrations from 42.31 to 67.18 mbsf. The methane at these depths is dominated by microbial production, as indicated by the high ratio of methane to heavier homologues (ethane and propane), with $\mathrm{C}_{1}/(\mathrm{C}_{2}+\mathrm{C}_{3})$ values of \~8,000 to 10,000.  

The pore fluid geochemistry below the zone of most intense biogeochemical cycling can be split into three zones. The first zone extends from ${\sim}50$ to 500 mbsf and is characterized by a steady increase in Ca concentrations and a decrease in $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K concentrations with depth. These trends are most likely not the result of volcanic ash alteration to clays and zeolites, because salinities (hence Cl) decrease with depth rather than increase, as would be expected, and the tephras recovered are largely unaltered. Rather, the trends appear to result from clay-ion exchange, ongoing biogeochemical reactions, and authigenic carbonate precipitation/dissolution reactions. Below ${\sim}100~\mathrm{mbsf}_{i}$ , ethane concentrations increase progressively, whereas propane to pentane are only detected in insignificant amounts. At $\sim\!360$ mbsf, abrupt increases in $C_{2}..C_{5}$ gas concentrations correlate with an increase in ammonium concentrations observed in the pore fluids. Another peak in the heavier hydrocarbon gases occurs at 440 mbsf, and both $C_{2}..C_{5}$ maxima indicate the presence of thermogenic gases at and below 360 mbsf.  

The second zone occurs between $\mathord{\sim}500$ and 800 mbsf and is characterized by a broad zone of low Ca, salinity, $\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g},$ ammonium, and alkalinity concentrations. The K concentration-depth profile, however, shows a steady decrease in this interval, which is similar to the gradient observed in the upper $500\,\mathrm{m}$ of the sediment section. The lowest $\mathrm{C}_{1}/(\mathrm{C}_{2}+\mathrm{C}_{3})$ values observed at this site occur in the zone between 598.49 and $656.55~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , in which methane concentrations are between $\mathord{\sim}3000$ and $6000\ \mathrm{ppmv}.$ . A strong peak in $C_{3}{\mathrm{-}}C_{5}$ concentrations occurs at ${\sim}650\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , coincident with the minima in Ca and salinity concentrations observed in the pore fluids. The broad decrease in the major elements and decrease in the ratio of methane to the heavier hydrocarbons correlates with lithostratigraphic Unit III, which is dominated by coarser grained sediments as well as several fault zones identified below $\mathord{\sim}600$ mbsf. Generally, the inorganic and organic geochemical data suggest lateral and upward flow of a low-salinity (hence Cl) fluid with elevated concentrations of thermogenic hydrocarbons (up to iso-pentanes) and K. The geothermal gradient at Site U1379 is $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ ; thus, the temperature between 600 and 800 mbsf ranges from $24^{\circ}{-}32^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This temperature range is too low for the in situ production of thermogenic hydrocarbons or for extensive clay dehydration, suggesting the fluid sampled in Unit III is from a deeper source and is migrating laterally and upward along the permeable sand horizons and faults.  

The third zone occurs from $\mathord{\sim}800$ to $\mathord{\sim}900$ mbsf (lithostratigraphic Unit III into Unit IV) and is characterized by a strong linear increase in Ca concentrations and a decrease in $\mathrm{Mg}$ concentrations. These trends suggest that the basement fluid is dominated by fluid-rock reaction with basalt in the basement. Pore fluids are also enriched in hydrocarbon gases in this interval, with methane concentrations ranging from $\mathord{\sim}1\mathrm{,}000$ to >10,000 ppmv and $\mathrm{CH}_{4}/(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}+\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{8})$ ratios increasing from $\mathord{\sim}300$ to 1400 at 800–947.22 centimeters below seafloor.  

Results from LWD generally correspond to the observations as well as to the physical property data obtained from the cored sediments. The LWD tools deployed in the hole included the adnVISION 675 (density, neutron, and ultrasonic caliper), the TeleScope 675 (MWD; power and data transmission and drilling parameters), the arcVISION 675 (propagation resistivity, gamma radiation, and annular pressure), and the geoVISION 675 (resistivity images and gamma radiation). The measurements recorded by the LWD tools were downloaded and processed successfully, except for the geoVISION data. The Schlumberger logging engineers and the Schlumberger LWD data processing center in Houston, Texas (USA, were unable to recover useful geoVISION measurements.  

Based on the LWD measurements, four logging units have been defined. Logging Unit 1 (0–492 mbsf) corresponds to a compacting sequence where density and resistivity increase and porosity decreases with depth, reaching nearly constant values of $\mathord{\sim}1.9$ $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$ , $1\;\Omega\mathrm{m}$ , and $45\%$ porosity at the base of the unit. The top of logging Unit 2 (492– $600\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ is marked by a small step increase in density and resistivity $({\sim}2\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $1.3\;\Omega\mathrm{m})$ ). The distinguishing feature of logging Unit 3 (600–892 mbsf) is the presence of many borehole enlargements, which are likely to correspond to intervals containing unconsolidated sands or fractured intervals. Logging Unit 4 (892–955 mbsf) corresponds to the basement rocks of the sedimentary sequence and is clearly identified by a sharp shift in the baseline of NGR, density, and resistivity logs. Compared to the sediments above, the basement unit shows a markedly higher average density and resistivity $(2.3\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $2.5\;\Omega\mathbf{m}$ ) and lower porosity $(\sim\!20\%)$ .  

The adnVISION tool collected oriented images of bulk density and borehole radius. Despite its limited azimuthal resolution (image data are sampled in 16 azimuthal sectors, i.e., every $22.5^{\circ})$ , the images clearly display vertical bands of large borehole radius in the interval 292–885 mbsf interpreted as borehole breakouts caused by differences in the principal horizontal stresses. The average azimuth of the breakouts is roughly north–south to north-northwest–south-southeast, indicating that the maximum horizontal stress is oriented east–west to east-northeast–west-southwest.  

# Site U1380  

Site U1380 was drilled as the alternate site for Site U1378 with the objective to core enough sediment to stratigraphically correlate Sites U1378 and U1380 and to core as much basement in the remaining time window as possible. Site U1380 is on the middle slope of the Costa Rica margin above the unlocked portion of the plate boundary according to interplate earthquake relocation and geodetic measurements (Fig. F2). The margin here consists of upper plate basement underlying ${\sim}550\;\mathrm{m}$ thick slope sediments. The site was drilled to 397 mbsf, followed by coring to total depth at $\mathord{\sim}480$ mbsf, where Hole U1380A was deteriorating, making it necessary to terminate, plug, and abandon the hole. Overall, we retrieved $52.37\textrm{m}$ of sediment at this site.  

Generally, the sediments cored in Hole U1380A were assigned to a single lithostratigraphic  unit  consisting  of  olive-green,  terrigeneous,  well-consolidated  clayey silt(stone) and silty clay(stone) with minor layers of sand(stone), sandy silty clay(stone), clay, and clayey silt(stone) (Fig. F9). Intercalated in the main background sedimentation are decimeter-scale fining- and coarsening-upward sequences of sands as well as several tephra layers. The tephra layers range in thickness from 0.5 to 35 cm. Unconformable and/or inclined bedding of the tephra was observed throughout the entire cored material. In general, the tephra layers have a sharp basal sediment contact and a gradational top contact, mainly normally graded and well sorted. The tephra layers are mainly composed of felsic $(>\!90\ \nu01\%)$ ), transparent, colorless, and very fine to coarse ash-sized glass shards with angular blocky, cuspate, flat, or Yshaped morphology. The majority of the glass is altered, as shown by the undulous extinction under cross-polarized light. In the coarser sand layers, rip-up clasts, rounded clay lenses, and abundant shell fragments are commonly observed. Framboidal pyrite was observed in many of the smear slides throughout lithostratigraphic Unit I.  

Structurally, the material cored at Site U1380 is characterized by shallow- to moderate-dipping bedding planes $(\mathrm{mean}={\sim}40^{\circ})$ and two fault zones. The fault zones encountered between 407–419 and 454–477 mbsf show relatively intense fracturing and brecciation.  

The physical property data obtained from the cored material display expected behavior with depth and reflect that only a single sediment unit, as well as a limited depth interval, was cored at this site (Fig. F9). Wet bulk densities determined from wholeround GRA measurements are relatively constant throughout the cored interval, with a mean density value of $1.87\pm0.05~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Grain densities determined by mass/volume measurements on discrete samples are also relatively constant with depth, with an average value of $2.67\pm0.08\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}.$ ; however, the variability increases with depth. These values suggest a terrigenous origin of the deposited material. Porosities obtained by mass/volume measurements on discrete samples using moisture and density (MAD) method C are also relatively constant through the cored interval, with a value of $49\%$ . The magnetic susceptibility measured in the sedimentary sequence is also relatively homogeneous and low, indicating an abundance of noniron-bearing clays and scarcity of magnetic minerals. The thermal conductivity is relatively constant throughout the cored interval, with a mean of $1.05\pm0.22\:\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ .  

The biogenic components observed at this site are similar to those observed in lithostratigraphic Unit II at Site U1378. Biogenic components have a bimodal distribution in Unit I: shell fragments, diatoms, and nannofossils are sparse but ubiquitous throughout the unit, whereas foraminifers are partly enriched within the sediments and are a major constituent of the sand-sized fraction. Preservation ranges from poor to moderate. Based on nannofossil biostratigraphy (Zone NN19) the sediments retrieved from the basal core were deposited in the early Pleistocene; thus, the sediments cored at Site U1380 are younger than $2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . However, the top and bottom boundaries of Zone NN19, defined by the LOs of $P.$ lacunosa and D. brouweri, respectively, could not be constrained. The dominant species observed at this site include H. carteri, H. sellii, Helicosphaera neogranulata/hyalina, Coccolithus pelagicus, and C. leptoporus.  

Planktonic foraminiferal zones could not be established in the sediments cored at this site because of their rare occurrences. Benthic foraminifers, on the other hand, reflect continuous paleoenvironmental changes. Planktonic foraminifers were observed in limited horizons of six core catcher samples and are characteristic of tropical fauna (G. quadrilobatus [G. sacculifer]), G. ruber, O. universa, G. menardii, and N. dutertrei). The benthic foraminifers observed at this site are similar to modern assemblages, which is characteristic for the oxygen-minimum zone in this region. Thus, benthic foraminiferal faunas mainly represent bathyal species. The faunas include many species similar to those of nearby Site U1378. In general, the following species have been observed: Bolivina argentea, Epistominella smithi, Uvigerina peregrina, Cibicidoides mckannai, and  

Gyroidina. These species are characteristic of upper to middle bathyal paleoenvironments.  

Paleomagnetic investigation revealed behavior similar to that Site U1378. Stepwise AF demagnetization was performed on all archive-half sections (to $15~\mathrm{mT}$ ) and discrete samples taken from the working half. The sections and samples are severely affected by drilling-induced remagnetization, and NRM intensities are comparable to those of Site U1378. The number of discrete samples analyzed so far is too limited to confidently define the magnetic polarity for this site. Thermal demagnetization experiments on three discrete samples revealed low unblocking temperature of NRM ${\sim}60\%$ loss by $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ ), suggesting that the main NRM carriers are Ti-rich titanomagnetite, maghemite, or goethite.  

The geochemical trends displayed by the analyzed pore water and gas samples (10 whole rounds, 9 headspace samples, and 8 void gas samples) mainly follow the same general trend with depth as the fluids observed at Site U1378 (Fig. F9). Salinity, Cl, Na, $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ , and B concentrations show a monotonic decrease with depth. This indicates diffusional communication with fluids at depth. The low chloride concentrations $(380\;\mathrm{mM})$ and low salinity $(20\;\mathrm{mM})$ , ${\sim}60\%{-}67\%$ of seawater, reflect significant freshening of the fluid. Methane $\mathrm{(CH}_{4})$ concentrations range between 3,346.67 and 11,925.59 ppmv in interstitial waters from sediments sampled between 398.1 and 475.1 mbsf in Hole U1380A. The gas at these depths is thermogenic in origin, as indicated by the low ratios of methane to heavier homologues (ethane and propane), with $\mathrm{CH}_{4}/(\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6}+\mathrm{C}_{3}\mathrm{H}_{8})$ values from 458.78 to 551.80. The ${\mathrm{C}}_{2}{\mathrm{H}}_{6}$ concentrations range between 3.89 and 15.69 ppmv, with the highest concentration at 475.1 mbsf. Propane is also present in the cores, with concentrations ranging from 1.39 to 7.33 ppmv at depth. Iso- and $_n$ -butane were detected from 398.1 to 475.1 mbsf, with concentrations between 0.55 and 3.45 ppmv. Iso-pentane concentrations ranged from 0.64 to 2.34 ppmv. Propane, butane, and pentane concentrations were all highest at 475.1 mbsf.  

A clear offset in the Ca, Mg, Sr, K, ammonium, and alkalinity profiles occurs from $\mathord{\sim}400$ to 500 mbsf between Sites U1380 and U1378. Ca and ammonium concentrations at Site U1380 are lower than at Site U1378, whereas K, Mg, Sr, and alkalinity concentrations are higher at Site U1380. The Ca, Mg, and K concentrations were determined twice by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy at both Sites U1380 and U1378, and the ammonium and alkalinity concentrations were determined by different methods; thus, the offset is not an analytical artifact. Site U1380 is $\sim\!1\ \mathrm{km}$ northeast of Site U1378, and the lithostratigraphy at Site U1378 is only partially represented at Site U1380. The interval between $\mathord{\sim}400$ and 500 mbsf at Site U1378 contains more and thicker sections of coarser grained sediments than at Site U1380, indicating that these horizons are either not present at Site U1380 or were not recovered and sampled. It is likely that these coarser grained horizons are the conduits for the laterally migrating fluids observed at Site U1378, which may explain why the geochemical profiles at Site U1380 show a steady increase (Ca and ammonium) or decrease ( $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K) through the cored depth and do not display the marked anomalies observed at Site U1378.  

# Site U1381  

One of the primary objectives of Expedition 334 was to determine the characteristics of the downward-moving plate entering the Costa Rica Subduction Zone. Fundamental to this objective is an understanding of the nature and hydrologic system of the igneous section entering the zone. In this context Site U1381 serves as a reference site. Site U1381 is also situated on BGR99 Line 7, offshore Osa Peninsula and Caño Island. Site U1381 is on a basement-relative high at common midpoint 5750 $(8^{\circ}25.7150^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $84^{\circ}\ 9.4690^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ at $2067\mathrm{~m~}$ below sea level (Fig. F2). The fundamental difference between this site and the other sites drilled during this expedition is that it is situated on the incoming Cocos Plate outboard of the Middle American Trench. The seismic reflection profile indicates that the basement sediment cover is ${\sim}120~\mathrm{m}$ thick at this site and that it most likely consists of pelagic and hemipelagic sediments. This section disconformably overlies highly reflective basement interpreted as the igneous crust of the Cocos Ridge. Two holes were drilled at this site, Holes U1381A and U1381B. Hole U1381A was drilled to recover as much of the sediment cover and basement rock as possible in the specified time window. Hole U1381B was drilled to retrieve the uppermost $30\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment for detailed geochemical sampling and to take five in situ temperature measurements to determine the geothermal gradient and heat flux at this site. Overall, $54.15\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and $35.69\;\mathrm{m}$ of basement were retrieved at this site, with average recovery rates of $42.30\%$ and $54.82\%$ , respectively.  

The material cored in Hole U1381A can be divided into eight lithostratigraphic units (Fig. F10). Unit I, ${\sim}46.14\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, consists mainly of light greenish gray soft clay sediments, with minor layers of silty clay, and three tephra layers, ranging in thickness from 2 to $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . In general, Unit I is massive with minor changes in the proportions of clay and silt. Biogenic components, especially nannofossils and diatoms, are abundant throughout the unit. Foraminifers, spicules, and radiolarians are present in trace abundances. Smear slide investigations show that the main accessory components observed in this unit are silt-sized grains of feldspar, chert, chlorite, pyroxene, amphibole, opaque minerals, calcite, glauconite, fragments of radiolarians, foraminifers, sponge spicules, glass, and rare quartz. Unit $\mathrm{II}$ is ${\sim}49.64\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and consists of mainly dark grayish to yellowish brown soft to hardened clay/(stone) with abundant intercalated tephra layers. The base of the sediment cover is partly silicified. Unit II is clearly distinguishable from Unit I by its abundant biogenic components and by an abrupt color change. Unit II sediments are ${>}70\%$ spicules, diatoms, radiolarians, and nannofossils. The dominantly felsic tephra layers range in thickness from 0.5 to 35 $\mathbf{Cm}$ , are massive to soft, show normal gradation, and are well sorted. One notable exception is a $35~\mathrm{cm}$ thick silicified mafic tephra layer in interval 334-U1381A-7R-1, $92\,\mathrm{cm}$ , through 7R-2, $9\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ , that shows parallel and cross lamination. With the exception of one tephra layer (interval 5R-5, $29{-}34\ \mathrm{cm})$ , all other tephras show devitrification structures within the glass shards and severe signs of alteration. Grain size ranges from very fine to coarse ash (up to millimeter size). The mineral assemblages observed in the tephra layers consist of plagioclase, pyroxene (hypersthene and augite), hornblende, and biotite. Bedding dips, identified at compositional boundaries or grainsize differences, of the entire cover sediment sequence are almost horizontal (mostly ${\le}5^{\circ},$ ). The igneous basement starts with a $29\textrm{m}$ thick sequence of highly plagioclase phyric to glomerophyric pillow basalts separated by a set of chilled margins (Unit III). At the bottom of Unit III, there is a calcareous claystone (Unit IV) with a recovered thickness of $0.24\mathrm{~m~}$ . Unit $\mathrm{V}$ is composed of a $6\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of aphyric to moderately plagioclase phyric pillow basalts. The contact to the underlying coarser grained basalts (Unit VI) is not clearly defined and is represented by a transitional zone of intercalated pillow basalts and coarser grained basalts. Unit VI consists of a 27 m thick sequence of coarser grained aphyric to moderately plagioclase phyric basalts. At the bottom of these relatively monotonous basalts is a clastic magmatic horizon $0.27\textrm{m}$ thick mainly containing basalt and plagioclase clasts in a fine-grained to microcrystalline matrix (Unit VII). Unit VIII below this horizon consists of another plagioclase phyric pillow basalt unit with a chilled margin on top. We recovered $4\;\mathrm{m}$ of this unit before drilling stopped at 165 mbsf.  

Structures of the sedimentary sequence cored at this site are characterized by gently dipping (mostly $\le\!5^{\circ}$ ) bedding planes, whereas structures of the cored basalt are characterized by fractures with varying dipping angles of $19^{\circ}{-}86^{\circ}$ partly filled with vein minerals. No brittle deformation such as faults and fractures was recognized in the sediment cores.  

The physical property data obtained from the cored material are variable, which is consistent with the different lithologies cored at this site (Fig. F10). Wet bulk densities determined from whole-round GRA measurements are relatively constant throughout the cored sediment section at this site, with a mean density value of $1.40\pm0.14$ $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$ . GRA-derived bulk densities of the basement are highly variable, because of variable filling of the core liner, with a maximum value of $2.3\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Grain densities determined by mass/volume measurements on discrete samples of the cored sediment, although showing a large scatter, generally decrease with depth from $\sim\!2.7$ to $2.5~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Porosities obtained by mass/volume measurements on discrete samples using MAD method C are relatively constant through the cored sediment interval at $76\%$ . Generally, porosity is expected to decrease with depth; the observed constant values could be an artifact caused by the RCB coring system. The magnetic susceptibility measured in the sedimentary sequence is low, with a mean value of $0.009~\pm$ 0.016 SI. The magnetic susceptibility measured in the basement rocks is generally higher, increasing from the sediment/basement interface to a 140 mbsf followed by a slow decrease toward the bottom of the hole. The thermal conductivity is relatively constant throughout the cored interval, with a mean of $0.79\pm0.08$ and $1.45\pm0.07$ $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ in sediment and basement, respectively. These values are quite low for basalt and might be an artifact of the samples not being water saturated before measurement because of time constraints. Downhole equilibrium temperatures acquired using the SET increase linearly with depth and give a least-squares geothermal gradient, coupled with the average bottom water temperature, of $222^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . The heat flow calculated using the mean thermal conductivity of $0.8\:\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ is $178\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . This value is significantly larger than the half-space prediction for $15\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust $\left.130\,\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$ and larger than the observed global average heat flow for crust of this age $(77\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ (Stein and Stein, 1992). This high heat flow value is an indicator for significant fluid flow within the underlying crust.  

The nannofossil and foraminiferal community observed at this site provide significant biostratigraphic control of the cored sediment sequence above the basaltic basement of the Cocos Ridge and reflect the sedimentological differences described above. Based on microfossil biostratigraphy, the sedimentary layers are tentatively divided into an upper part of Pleistocene age and a lower part of middle Miocene age. Thus, the sediments just above the basement are tentatively estimated to be of middle Miocene age. The sediments just above basement basalt would be younger than $16\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The zonation of planktonic foraminifers is approximately concordant with that of the calcareous nannofossils.  

Two different environments, based on species, abundance, and preservation, are represented in the cored sediments at Site U1381. The upper interval (3.69–49.62 mbsf) represents a hemipelagic environment mixed with terrigenous material, whereas the lower interval (53.86–95.5 mbsf), a silicic to calcareous ooze, represents a pelagic environment. The nannofossil assemblage observed in the upper 31.9 mbsf is characteristic of lower Pleistocene Zones NN20–NN19 and contains G. oceanica, G. caribbeanica, H. carteri, and C. leptoporus. However, because of poor preservation and the lack of zonal markers, this interval cannot be biostratigraphically zoned. The interval to 41.5 mbsf is tentatively assigned to nannofossil Zone NN19 based on the occurrence of $P.$ lacunosa and the absence of $D$ . brouweri. However, the top boundary, defined by the LO of $P.$ lacunosa, is undetermined. Sample 334-U1381A-6R-CC (49.62 mbsf) contains a diverse nannofossil assemblage of mixed ages ranging from the Pleistocene Zone NN19 into the upper to middle Miocene. This diverse assemblage is dominated by Pleistocene species, including G. oceanica, G. caribbeanica, H. carteri, and C. leptoporus. Also present, but rare to few in abundance, are Miocene species including Discoaster bellus, Discoaster exilis, Discoaster quinqueramus, Discoaster variabilis, and unidentifiable five- and six-rayed discoasters. The discoasters are poorly to moderately preserved, whereas the placoliths exhibit moderate to good preservation. The condition of the discoasters and the rarity or lack of biostratigraphic markers prevents the further delineation of the Pliocene and Miocene zones.  

The lower interval between 53.86 and 95.5 mbsf is assigned to middle Miocene Zone NN5 based on the occurrence of Helicosphaera heteromorphus and the absence of Helicosphaera ampliaperta. The top and bottom of this zone cannot be constrained because of the uncertainty of the LOs of biostratigraphic markers. Typical species found in the samples include Sphenolithus heteromorphus, Sphenolithus moriformis, C. leptoporus, Cyclicargolithus floridanus, Coccolithus miopelagicus, D. exilis, D. variabilis, Discoaster deflandrei, and Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus.  

Planktonic foraminifers were analyzed in nine core catcher samples. Foraminifers are abundant to common in the sediments of Hole U1381A. Preservation is good to moderate. Fragmentation of foraminifers caused by carbonate dissolution is observed in the samples of sediments from lower bathyal depths. Planktonic foraminifers, abundant to common in this hole, are much more abundant than benthic foraminifers. These trends are quite different from the trends observed in the cored sediments of the other sites. Similar to the observed nannofossil communities in this hole, the foraminiferal assemblages of the upper part of the sediment sequence are quite different from those of the lower parts. This is either caused by a hiatus or by very low sedimentation rates. The foraminiferal community of the upper sediment sequence (3.69–49.62 mbsf) is characterized by tropical fauna (G. quadrilobatus [G. sacculifer]), G. ruber, O. universa, G. menardii, and N. dutertrei). Sample 334-U1381A-3R-CC (13.34 mbsf) contains G. ruber (pink) and is assigned to the Pleistocene (older than $0.12\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ). Sample 6R-CC (49.64 mbsf) contains sinistral coiling Pulletiatina and is assigned to be older than $0.8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ but younger than 4 Ma. From 53.86 to 95.55 mbsf, planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are composed of Dentoglobigerina altispira, G. quadrilobatus, Globigerinoides obliquus, Globoquadrina dehiscens, Globorotalia peripheronda, Globorotalia peripheroacuta, Paragloborotalia siakensis, and Orbulina suturalis. This sequence is tentatively assigned to planktonic foraminiferal Zone M7 ( $14\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . However, the occurrence of Praeorbulina circularis at \~95.55 mbsf may be a sign that the sediments just above the basement basalt are much older (either Zone M5 or M6).  

Paleomagnetic experiments with stepwise AF demagnetization were performed on all archive-half sections and discrete samples taken from the working half. Archive-half sections were demagnetized to $15\;\mathrm{mT}$ for the sediments and $10\,\mathrm{mT}$ for the basalts. For the sediments, NRM intensity is too weak for the shipboard experiments to determine characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM). For the basalts, the majority of the measured samples revealed a ChRM with shallow and positive inclination. Several intervals reveal a NRM with negative inclinations, possibly reflecting prolonged igneous activity.  

The NRM intensity of the basalts ranges from 1 to $8\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . The samples from the top of the basalt section (Cores 334-U1381A-12R through 16R) frequently show NRM with shallow inclination, consistent with the low latitude, and strong intensity. The samples below Core 16R show NRM with steeper inclination of ${\sim}50^{\circ}$ , indicating a stronger effect from drilling-induced remagnetization, and lower intensities. Thermal demagnetization experiments on three discrete samples revealed that blocking temperature of NRM is $550^{\circ}–580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{i}$ , suggesting that the main NRM carrier is titanomagnetite with a low Ti content.  

The geochemical trends displayed by the analyzed pore water samples (17 whole rounds) are generally controlled by organic carbon cycling, alteration of volcanic ash, and diffusive exchange with basement.  

Salinity is lower than seawater value between 13 and 24 mbsf but increases gradually below this depth to the base of the sediment column (Fig. F10). Chloride concentrations are slightly below modern seawater value. A similar dilution of Cl concentrations of ${\sim}2.5\%$ lower than modern seawater was observed in the upper $100\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sediment column cored at the reference site (ODP Site 1039) offshore the Nicoya Peninsula (Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997). Sodium concentrations are below seawater value throughout the cored section and reach a minimum at 35 mbsf. Potassium and Mg show similar decreases at this depth, suggesting local alteration of volcanic ash that is consistent with lithostratigraphic observations. Sodium concentrations are relatively constant below this depth. Sulfate concentrations decrease to a minimum at 23 mbsf and increase nearly linearly with depth. The alkalinity concentration-depth profile is a mirror image of the sulfate profile, reaching a maximum at 23 mbsf and decreasing toward the base of this hole. Organic matter diagenesis in the upper part of the sediment section is also observed in the ammonium profile, which reaches a maximum value at 23 mbsf. Ammonium concentrations remain nearly constant to 35 mbsf and decrease nearly linearly. Calcium concentrations reach a minimum value just below the sulfate minimum at 23 mbsf, suggesting precipitation of authigenic carbonates in the zone of active sulfate reduction and alkalinity production. Below this depth, calcium concentrations monotonically increase toward the base of the sediment column, which most likely reflects diffusive exchange with a basement fluid.  

Potassium and B concentrations decrease gradually with depth and reach minimum values at the base of the sediment cover, whereas dissolved Mn concentrations increase with depth, reaching maximum values at the base. Magnesium concentrations exhibit a minimum at 35 mbsf, which is consistent with the abundant alteration of the volcanic tephra in this interval. Magnesium concentrations remain relatively constant between 45 and 81 mbsf and decrease again at the sediment/basement interface. Dissolved Si concentrations are elevated throughout the cored section, and the profile is primarily controlled by lithology. Si concentrations increase slightly from 13 to 46 mbsf and increase abruptly from 46 to 68 mbsf, reflecting the change from the claydominated terrigeneous sediments in the uppermost sediment column to hemipelagic sediments dominated by calcareous nannofossils and diatoms below. Silica concentrations remain elevated and constant throughout the hemipelagic nannofossil ooze section. Strontium concentrations increase slightly with depth, reaching a maximum at the base of the sediment section. The slight increase in Sr concentrations in the calcareous nannofossil-rich sediments suggests they are relatively unaltered and have not undergone significant diagenetic modification. This interpretation is corroborated by the pristine appearance of the nannofossils within these sediments.  

# Summary and conclusions  

Expedition 334 incorporated both shallow-water drilling on the Caribbean plate continental upper slope (Site U1379) and deepwater drilling on the Cocos plate (Site U1381). This latter site also represented the first ever penetration of the Cocos Ridge igneous basement. A third target area was the Caribbean middle slope where we drilled Sites U1378 and U1380. Acquisition of LWD logs prior to coring was planned and successfully implemented at Sites U1378 and U1379.  

Slope sediments at Sites U1378–U1380 had $100\%$ recovery. Site U1379 had $\sim\!20\%$ recovery in the hard formation forming the basement of the Caribbean plate. Unfortunately both LWD and coring were interrupted without reaching the upper plate basement at Sites U1378 and U1380 because of deteriorated hole conditions.  

Before entering into the scientific facts regarding the cruise, we want to thank the drillers and all JOIDES Resolution staff for their collaboration and optimistic vision of the challenges that they always took with no hesitation. All major objectives of the expedition, both in the view of the entire Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project and as stand-alone goals, were fulfilled, and below we will provide major highlights.  

1. Estimate the composition, texture, and physical properties of the upper plate material.  

The basement was successfully drilled at Site U1379. This site is on the upper slope at $127\textrm{m}$ water depth. At Site U1379, both cores and LWD logs penetrated below the slope sediment and upper plate basement interface for 50 and $70\textrm{m}$ , respectively. LWD logs showed a marked increase in density and resistivity at $\mathord{\sim}892$ mbsf. This change in physical properties was interpreted as penetration into the upper plate basement after drilling a continuous section of slope sediments. Indeed, successive coring at Site U1379 showed a complex change in lithostratigraphy, going from sandstones with lithic fragments of igneous origin to bioclastic sandstones to a poorly sorted, well-lithified breccia with sandy matrix and igneous, calcareous, and mudstone clasts to mudstone. It remains unclear if we entered a transition zone with clasts of basement, for example an erosional surface, or the basement itself. The difficulties are due to the fact that the expected basement at Site U1379 was a mélange; the mudstone recovered from the bottom of the hole may or may not be the matrix of the mé- lange. We need further analysis to completely answer this question.  

A second penetration of the basement was attempted at Site U1378. Both LWD logs and coring were not successful in reaching the basement at this site. Hole conditions did not allow penetration deeper than 457 mbsf during logging and 524 mbsf during coring, whereas the expected depth of top of basement was $\mathord{\sim}750$ mbsf. Successive core description revealed the presence of highly fractured and brecciated zones interpreted as fault zones, which may have caused the impossible advance of drilling.  

A final attempt to reach the basement was conducted at Site U1380, where the basement was expected at ${\sim}550$ mbsf. Site U1380 is ${\sim}1~\mathrm{km}$ upslope from Site U1378, but we encountered the same problems, here at 482 mbsf.  

2. Assess subduction channel thickness and the rate of subduction erosion.  

In an erosive subduction margin, the upper plate material is incorporated into the subduction channel because of basal erosion, resulting in subsidence of the upper plate. Estimation of mass removal from the upper plate in the CRISP area based on subsidence profiles of slope sediments is crucial to assess the thickness of the subduction channel. Expedition 334 successfully recovered slope sediments offshore Osa Peninsula where the Cocos Ridge is subducting beneath the Caribbean plate. The preliminary results of biostratigraphic ages obtained from two slope sites indicate high sediment accumulation rates in the terrestrially sourced slope sequence, ranging from $516{-}236\;\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ at Site U1378 in the middle slope to $1035\mathrm{-}160\;\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ at Site U1379 in the upper slope. In particular, the accumulation rate of the slope sediments, mainly composed of clayey silt/silty clay, at Site U1379 is $1035\mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{y}.$ , much higher than that of slope sediments offshore Nicoya Peninsula $\left(38{-}99\mathrm{~m/m.y.}\right)$ (Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997). The remarkable high accumulation rate offshore Osa Peninsula could be derived from onland uplift triggered by the subduction of the Cocos Ridge. On the other hand, the subduction of such topographic high likely accelerates the basal erosion of the upper plate. The subsidence/uplift profiles of the slope sediments offshore Osa Peninsula are controlled by the high sediment accumulation rate and the basal erosion; the subsidence of the upper plate likely occurred when the rate of subduction erosion was higher than the slope sedimentation rate. The detailed research of sedimentary facies and benthic foraminifer faunal in slope sediments at Sites U1378 and U1379 are keys to estimate the mass removal associated with basal erosion and the thickness of the subduction channel.  

3. Evaluate fluid/rock interaction, the hydrologic system, and the geochemical processes (indicated by composition and volume of fluids) active within the upper plate.  

Fluid flow and fluid pressure in subduction zones can have a profound impact on the shallow thermal structure and fluid content of the subducting and upper plates; fault zone stability and seismogenesis; and the transfer of elements and isotopes to the ocean, volcanic arc, and mantle. Changes in physical and mineralogical properties with depth and the associated evolution of fluids in subduction zones may be intimately linked to the transition from aseismic to seismic behavior along the plate boundary. Fluids advected along fault zones and other permeable horizons in the upper plate record reactions occurring at greater depths in the subduction zone and can be used to constrain reactions occurring within the seismogenic zone. The shipboard geochemistry program during Expedition 334 identified two zones in the upper plate with fluid compositions indicative of the transport of fluids from greater depths and one zone in the reference site where there is lateral flow of modified seawater in the igneous basement.  

Pore fluids in the uppermost ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ at all sites drilled during Expedition 334 are dominated by reactions associated with the cycling of organic carbon. Within the uppermost $50\;\mathrm{m}$ , active sulfate reduction, biogenic methane production, and precipitation of authigenic carbonates are present. The depth of the sulfate methane transition (SMT) varies from site to site, with the shallowest SMT occurring at a depth of ${\sim}13$ mbsf at Site U1378. The sulfate reduction profile at Site U1379 has a steep gradient to ${\sim}15$ mbsf and then becomes less steep, reaching depletion at ${\sim}30~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . The change in the gradient at the slope site (U1379) may reflect changes in the type of organic matter in the sediments or a change in sedimentation rates. At Site U1381, the diffusive flux of sulfate from the overlying water column and from the basement aquifer below the sediment section is faster than microbial sulfate reduction rates in the sediment column; thus, sulfate does not reach depletion in the reference site.  

Fluid flow was detected at each of the sites cored. The flow at each site overprints the general geochemical profiles that are influenced by in situ diagenetic reactions such as ion exchange, ongoing microbial metabolic reactions, volcanic ash alteration, and carbonate precipitation/dissolution. At Site U1379, a broad zone from $\mathord{\sim}600$ to 800 mbsf contains a fluid with low Cl concentrations and peaks in the concentrations of thermogenic hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, $_n$ -butane, iso-butane). The geothermal gradient at Site U1379 is too low to support the in situ production of thermogenic hydrocarbons or for extensive clay dehydration, suggesting a deeper source for the fluid and migration along the permeable sand horizons and fault zones within this depth interval. At Site U1378, there is a monotonic decrease in Cl, Mg, and K concentrations and increase in Ca concentrations with depth, suggesting diffusional communication with fluids below the base of the hole. It is likely that this fluid resides in the fault zone in the basement imaged in the seismic reflection profiles at this site. The fluid at the base of the hole is more dilute (altered) than the fluids sampled at Site U1379. The ratio of methane to the thermogenic hydrocarbons also decreases with depth at this site. The in situ temperature at the sediment/basement contact is too low to support in situ clay dehydration or thermogenic hydrocarbon formation, thus this fluid must also be transported from greater depths. At Site U1381, the geochemical profiles below ${\sim}50$ mbsf reflect diffusional communication with a fluid with seawater-like chemistry in the igneous basement.  

4. Measure the stress field along the CRISP transect.  

We estimated present-day in situ stress orientation from borehole breakouts at Site U1378 in the middle slope and Site U1379 in the upper slope. Borehole breakouts in a vertical hole form in a direction perpendicular to the maximum horizontal principal stress $\left(\upsigma_{\mathsf{H m a x}}\right)$ (Zoback et al., 2003). During Expedition 334, borehole breakouts were identified from LWD images of borehole radius and density. In addition, we determined types, orientations, and kinematics of faults from cores.  

Breakout orientation of slope sediments at Site U1378 indicates that $\sigma_{\mathsf{H m a x}}$ is oriented north–northwest, south–southeast. Both normal and reverse faults are observed in cores from slope sediments at Site U1378. The $\sigma_{\mathsf{H m a x}}$ orientation at Site U1378 is consistent with the north–northwest-directed plate motion vector detected by the GPS measurement northwest of Osa Peninsula (LaFemina et al., 2009) and is oblique to the convergence direction (north–northeast) between the Cocos and Caribbean plates (DeMets, 2001). The Cocos Ridge is considered to act as a rigid indenter to the Caribbean plate, resulting in change in plate motion from north–northeast-directed trench-normal motion in southern Costa Rica to trench-parallel motion in central Costa Rica where plate convergence is normal to the trench (LaFemina et al., 2009). North–northwest-oriented $\sigma_{\mathsf{H m a x}}$ at Site U1378 may represent the shortening of the middle slope opposite the northwestern flank of the Cocos Ridge (thrust faulting stress regime) where plate motion likely deviates from trench-normal motion, although strike-slip and/or normal stress states are also possible.  

The $\sigma_{\mathsf{H m a x}}$ orientation of slope sediments at Site U1379 is east–northeast, west–southwest, perpendicular to $\sigma_{\mathsf{H m a x}}$ orientation at Site U1378. No obvious borehole breakouts appear in the underlying basement at Site U1379. Normal faults dominate in cores from slope sediments at Site U1379. Kinematic analyses of normal faults indicate a vertical maximum principal stress $\left(\upsigma_{1}\right)$ , an intermediate principal stress $(\upsigma_{2})$ oriented west–northwest, and a minimum principal stress $\left(\upsigma_{3}\right)$ oriented north–northeast. The $\sigma_{\mathsf{H m a x}}$ orientation at Site U1379 is consistent with north–northwest-directed horizontal extension parallel to the plate motion vector detected by the GPS measurement northwest of Osa Peninsula (LaFemina et al., 2009) and thus appears to represent a present stress state. On the other hand, the $\upsigma_{3}$ orientation determined from kinematic analyses of core-scale normal faults is parallel to the convergence direction between the Cocos and Caribbean plates (DeMets, 2001). Core-scale normal faults record instantaneous stress conditions when the faults are active. Although stress data sets are derived from slope sediments overlying the upper plate basement, trench-normal extension at Site U1379 is consistent with extensional faulting in the submarine wedge associated with basal erosion (Ranero and von Huene, 2000).  

In summary, stress at the middle slope site is compressional, whereas that at the upper slope site is extensional. This marked change in stress state occurs within ${\sim}12~\mathrm{km}$ along the CRISP transect in the northwestern flank of the Cocos Ridge and may correspond to a change from compression (middle slope) to extension (upper slope), marking the onset of subduction erosion between Sites U1378 and U1379.  

# Cocos Ridge subduction: evolution of the Central America volcanic arc and development of the volcanic arc gap inboard Cocos Ridge  

Expedition 334 is the first research endeavor to drill into the sediments and basalts of Cocos Ridge, which is the trace of the Galapagos hotspot on the Cocos plate. We successfully recovered ${\sim}80\mathrm{~m~}$ of Cocos Ridge basalts, underlying ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of biogenic pelagic sediments, mainly siliceous to calcareous oozes.  

Approximately 170 tephra layers were described and sampled from the cored holes at four different sites with ages ranging from middle Miocene to the present. Postcruise analyses of the tephra will shed light on the evolution of the magmatic arc, including the deactivation of the volcanoes located on the present-day location of the Talamanca Cordillera.
