# Abstract  

The Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica has long been considered the most vulnerable part of the West Antarctic Ice Shee t (WAIS) because of the great water depth at the grounding line an d the absence of substantial ice shelves. Glaciers in this configuratio n are thought to be susceptible to rapid or runaway retreat. Ice flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment is undergoing the mos t rapid changes of any sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet outside th e Antarctic  Peninsula,  including  changes  caused  by  substantia l grounding-line retreat over recent decades, as observed from satellite data. Recent models suggest that a threshold leading to the collapse of WAIS in this sector may have been already crossed and tha t much of the ice sheet could be lost even under relatively moderat e greenhouse gas emission scenarios.  

Drill cores from the Amundsen Sea provide tests of several ke y questions about controls on ice sheet stability. The cores offer a direct record of glacial history offshore from a drainage basin that receives  ice  exclusively  from  the  WAIS,  which  allows  clea r comparisons between the WAIS history and low-latitude climat e records. Today, warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) is impinging onto the Amundsen Sea shelf and causing melting of the underside of the WAIS in most places. Reconstructions of past CD W intrusions can assess the ties between warm water upwelling an d large-scale changes in past grounding-line positions. Carrying ou t these reconstructions offshore from the drainage basin that currently has the most substantial negative mass balance of ice anywhere in Antarctica is thus of prime interest to future predictions.  

The scientific objectives for this expedition are built on hypotheses about WAIS dynamics and related paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions. The main objectives are  

1. To test the hypothesis that WAIS collapses occurred during the Neogene and Quaternary and, if so, when and under which environmental conditions;   
2. To obtain ice-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in the Amundsen Sea that correlate with global records of ice-volume changes and proxy records for atmospheric and ocean temperatures;   
3. To study the stability of a marine-based WAIS margin and how warm deep-water incursions control its position on the shelf;   
4. To find evidence for earliest major grounded WAIS advances onto the middle and outer shelf;   
5. To test the hypothesis that the first major WAIS growth was related to the uplift of the Marie Byrd Land dome.  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 37 9 completed two very successful drill sites on the continental rise o f the Amundsen Sea. Site U1532 is located on a large sediment drift, now called Resolution Drift, and penetrated to $794~\mathrm{m}$ with $90\%$ recovery. We collected almost-continuous cores from the Pleistocen e through the Pliocene and into the late Miocene. At Site U1533, w e drilled $383~\mathrm{m}$ ( $70\%$ recovery) into the more condensed sequence a t the lower flank of the same sediment drift. The cores of both site s contain unique records that will enable study of the cyclicity of ic e sheet advance and retreat processes as well as bottom-water circulation and water mass changes. In particular, Site U1532 revealed  a sequence of Pliocene sediments with an excellent paleomagnetic record for high-resolution climate change studies of the previousl y sparsely sampled Pacific sector of the West Antarctic margin.  

Despite the drilling success at these sites, the overall expeditio n experienced three unexpected difficulties that affected many of th e scientific objectives:  

1. The extensive sea ice on the continental shelf prevented us from drilling any of the proposed shelf sites.   
2. The drill sites on the continental rise were in the path of numerous icebergs of various sizes that frequently forced us to pause drilling or leave the hole entirely as they approached the ship. The overall downtime caused by approaching icebergs was $50\%$ of our time spent on site.   
3. An unfortunate injury to a member of the ship's crew cut the expedition short by one week.  

Recovery of core on the continental rise at Sites U1532 an d U1533 cannot be used to precisely indicate the position of ice or retreat of the ice sheet on the shelf. However, these sediments contained in the cores offer a range of clues about past WAIS extent an d retreat. At Sites U1532 and U1533, coarse-grained sediments interpreted to be ice-rafted debris (IRD) were identified throughout all recovered time periods. A dominant feature of the cores is recorde d by lithofacies cyclicity, which is interpreted to represent relativel y warmer periods variably characterized by higher microfossil abundance, greater bioturbation, and higher counts of IRD alternatin g with colder periods characterized by dominantly gray laminate d terrigenous muds. Initial comparison of these cycles to publishe d records from the region suggests that the units interpreted as records of warmer time intervals in the core tie to interglacial period s and the units interpreted as deposits of colder periods tie to glacial periods.  

The cores from the two drill sites recovered sediments of purel y terrigenous origin intercalated or mixed with pelagic or hemipelagic deposits. In particular, Site U1533, which is located near  a deep-sea channel originating from the continental slope, contain s graded sands and gravel transported downslope from the shelf t o the abyssal plain. The channel is likely the path of such sediment s transported downslope by turbidity currents or other sedimentgravity flows. The association of lithologic facies at both sites predominantly reflects the interplay of downslope and contouritic sediment supply with occasional input of more pelagic sediment. Despite the lack of cores from the shelf, our records from the continental rise reveal the timing of glacial advances across the shelf an d thus the existence of a continent-wide ice sheet in West Antarctic a at least during longer time periods since the late Miocene.  

Cores from both sites contain abundant coarse-grained sediments and clasts of plutonic origin transported either by downslop e processes or by ice rafting. If detailed provenance studies confir m our preliminary assessment that the origin of these samples is fro m the plutonic bedrock of Marie Byrd Land, their thermochronological record will potentially reveal timing and rates of denudation an d erosion linked to crustal uplift. The chronostratigraphy of both site s enables the generation of a seismic sequence stratigraphy not onl y for the Amundsen Sea rise but also for the western Amundsen Se a along the Marie Byrd Land margin through a connecting network o f seismic lines.  

# Introduction  

For decades, the ice in the drainage basins flowing into th e Amundsen Sea has been considered the most vulnerable part of th e  

West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) because of the great water dept h at the grounding line and the lack of substantial buttressing ic e shelves (Hughes, 1981). Glaciers in this configuration are thought t o be susceptible to rapid or runaway retreat (Schoof, 2007). Ice flowing into the Amundsen Sea Embayment is undergoing the mos t rapid changes of any sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, includin g changes caused by substantial grounding line retreat over recent decades, as observed from satellite data (Milillo et al., 2019). Recen t models suggest that a threshold leading to the collapse of WAIS i n this sector may have been passed already (Joughin et al., 2014) an d that much of the ice sheet could be lost even under relatively moderate greenhouse gas emission scenarios (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Model projections are limited by lack of constraints in several areas, most notably in a lack of detailed reconstructions of glacial history.  

Drill cores from the Amundsen Sea (Figure F1) provide tests o f several key questions about controls on ice sheet stability. First, th e cores offer a direct record of glacial history in a drainage basin tha t receives ice only from the WAIS and thus allow clear comparison s between the WAIS history and low-latitude climate records. Ic e draining into the Amundsen Sea is grounded below sea level an d thus allows a test of the marine ice sheet instability theory throug h correlation of the ice sheet history to sea level changes. Althoug h there are currently only relatively small ice shelves in front of th e grounding line today, during some points of its history the embayment had more extended ice shelves (Kirshner et al., 2012; Klages e t al., 2017) that allow examination of the grounding-line history relative to the ice-shelf history. Today, warm Circumpolar Deep Wate r (CDW) impinges onto the Amundsen Sea shelf, which causes melting of the underside of the ice in some places (Milillo et al., 2019). Reconstructions of past CDW intrusions (Hillenbrand et al., 2017; Minzoni et al., 2017) can assess the ties between warm water an d large-scale changes in past grounding-line positions. Carrying ou t these reconstructions offshore from the drainage basin that currently has the largest negative mass balance of ice of anywhere i n Antarctica (Paolo et al., 2015) is thus of prime interest to future predictions. Finally, Expedition 379 is part of a suite of Antarctic International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions that allo w large-scale reconstructions and comparisons between differen t drainage basins.  

# Background  

The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel o n Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) highlighted the fact that the response of continental ice sheets to climatic changes and their contribution to global sea level change is the largest unknown variabl e in predicting future sea level change. The fifth and latest assessmen t report of the IPCC (2013) includes more information about th e likely contributions to sea level change from the Antarctic, but thes e contributions remain one of the primary unknowns in prediction s of future change. Also, the 2013 IPCC assessment report emphasizes that if there is a substantial increase in the rate of sea level ris e in the next century, it is likely to come from marine-based ice lik e that in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. The recent special report o f the IPCC (2018) concludes that marine ice sheet instability in Antarctica and the irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet could b e triggered by $\mathrm{\sim}1.5^{\circ}$ to $2^{\circ}C$ of global warming and could result in multimeter sea level rise over hundreds to thousands of years.  

The WAIS rests on a continental shelf that typically deepens toward the interior of the Antarctic continent. This fore-deepene d continental shelf, and thus the base of the ice, is mostly below se a level. Therefore, the marine-based WAIS is sensitive to global se a level rise and regional oceanographic and atmospheric changes, an d its history has been highly dynamic (e.g., Joughin and Alley, 2011). A complete WAIS collapse would raise the global sea level by 3.3 t o $4.3~\mathrm{m}$ (Fretwell et al., 2013), whereas the collapse of its Amundse n Sea drainage sector would raise the sea level by ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ (Vaughan, 2008). Over the most recent decades, glaciers draining into th e Amundsen Sea thinned at a rapid rate, their flow speed dramaticall y increased, and their grounding lines retreated significantly, thereb y contributing to present sea level rise at a faster rate than from an y other glacier on Earth (e.g., Joughin and Alley, 2011; Joughin et al., 2012; Paolo et al., 2015; Rignot et al., 2019).  

The present ice loss in the Amundsen Sea region is mainly attributed to sub–ice shelf melting induced by relatively warm CD W upwelling onto the shelf and spreading through deep bathymetri c troughs toward the grounding zones (e.g., Arneborg et al., 2012; Joughin et al., 2012). It is unclear, however, whether the current ic e loss results from recent climatic/oceanographic warming or recen t internal ice sheet dynamics (Joughin and Alley, 2011; Joughin et al., 2012). If the WAIS has undergone similar thinning and retreat i n the past, the factors driving that retreat can be compared to moder n conditions.  

The reconstruction and quantification of WAIS collapse durin g the Neogene and Quaternary will provide constraints for ice shee t models (Figure F2) that predict future WAIS behavior and resultin g sea level rise. Numerous modeling studies have tried to link th e waxing and waning of the WAIS to various forcing mechanism s (e.g., Pollard and DeConto, 2009; Holden et al., 2010; DeConto an d Pollard, 2016; Sutter et al., 2016). However, large uncertainties exis t regarding the spatial and temporal variability of past ice sheet advance and retreat. These uncertainties are mainly caused by the lac k of data from cores drilled proximal to the WAIS. The only existin g drill cores along the Pacific Antarctic margin outside the Ross Se a are from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 35 in the Bellingshausen Sea (Hollister and Craddock, 1976) and Ocean Drillin g Program (ODP) Leg 178 on the Antarctic Peninsula margin (Barke r and Camerlenghi, 2002). Results from Leg 178 Site 1097, drilled o n the shelf, revealed a significant late Miocene change in sequence geometry on the outer shelf that may indicate a change in the typical extent of glacial advances, the dynamic behavior of ice streams, o r glacial sediment transport (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002; Bart e t al., 2005; Larter et al., 1997). Scheuer et al. (2006a, 2006b) was abl e to correlate seismic horizons with Leg 178 Sites 1095 and 1096 o n the continental rise and interpreted transitions from preglacial t o intermediate- and full-glacial conditions from the eastern Bellingshausen Sea to the Amundsen Sea.  

The most detailed results on Neogene WAIS history stem fro m the Antarctic Geological Drilling (ANDRILL) project in the wester n Ross Sea, which recovered early Miocene $\left({\sim}20\mathrm{~Ma}\right)$ to Quaternar y sequences in Cores AND-1B (Naish et al., 2009) and AND-2 A (Passchier et al., 2011). Pliocene data from Core AND-1B indicat e that orbitally induced oscillations of the WAIS resulted in transitions from grounded ice or ice shelves to open-water condition s (Naish et al., 2009; McKay et al., 2012). However, previous seismi c stratigraphic work on the Ross Sea shelf beyond Site AND-1B revealed only seven shelf-wide grounding events (Alonso et al., 1992). Given the location of Site AND-1B, which is in a position to be overridden by both the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) and the WAIS, the ANDRILL results are probably not representative of the WAI S outlets in the Amundsen, Bellingshausen, and Weddell Seas. Sedimentary records from the Ross and Weddell Seas provide only a n integrated archive of WAIS and EAIS dynamics, whereas record s from the Amundsen Sea will provide an unambiguous WAIS signal. We expect that results from recent IODP Expedition 374 to th e Ross Sea shelf and slope will provide further insight into the WAI S dynamics for the Ross Sea sector. Although the Filchner-Ronne Ic e Shelf extends far into the southern Weddell Sea, making groundingline proximal positions difficult to access, only small and narrow ic e shelves exist in the Amundsen Sea Embayment today.  

# Oceanographic setting  

Persistent sea ice cover characterizes Pine Island Bay and th e Amundsen Sea Embayment (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2012), and althoug h sea ice cover has decreased significantly in recent decades (Parkinson and Cavalieri, 2012), 2018 and 2019 did not follow this trend; the sea ice cover of the Amundsen Sea was extensive throughout th e entire austral summer and fall. Very little data on tidal ranges exis t for the Amundsen Sea, but models suggest a $40~\mathrm{{cm}}$ tidal height, making the area microtidal (Padman et al., 2002). Water mass temperatures within Pine Island Bay typically range between $-1.5^{\circ}$ an d $0^{\circ}C$ . The exception to this is warm CDW, which can reach $1.5\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ an d impinges onto the shelf through deep glacially carved trough s (Walker et al., 2007; Jacobs et al., 2011, 2013) and at times reache s into some of the smaller bays and fjords on the inner shelf (Minzon i et al., 2017). Productivity in the Amundsen Sea is among the highes t in the Southern Ocean and includes phytoplankton blooms relate d to polynyas (Arrigo et al., 2008; Minzoni et al., 2017). CDW i s widely considered to be the primary external driver of contemporary glacier retreat in the Amundsen Sea, and recent work ha s shown that it can vary on seasonal (Kim et al., 2017) to decadal (Jenkins et al., 2016) timescales in response to wind stress at the continental shelf edge.  

# Geological setting  

Together, ice sheet dynamics and tectonic as well as other geologic processes have shaped the Amundsen Sea continental shel f and rise. A $500{-}700\;\mathrm{m}$ deep shelf is incised by two major paleo–ic e stream troughs (Pine Island and Dotson-Getz) whose tributarie s originate from ice-stream/glaciers on the innermost ultradeep (a s deep as 1600 meters below sea level [mbsl]) shelf and converge a t the transition from the inner to middle shelf. Both troughs exten d toward the outer shelf, thereby becoming shallower and wider. Th e shelf geometry consists of a large pre- and synrift basin on the midshelf between the basement cropping out on the inner shelf and th e buried basement highs on the outer shelf. A subordinate basi n within the large midshelf basin may be associated with motio n along an early West Antarctic Rift System branch. At least $4\,\mathrm{km}$ o f preglacial strata were eroded by ice from the present inner shelf an d coastal hinterland. At least five major erosional unconformities indicate phases of significant WAIS advances. Prograding sequence s and subglacial bedforms on the outer shelf, subglacial tills recovere d in cores, and radiocarbon dates on calcareous microfossils and organic matter in overlying sediments indicate that ground ice expanded to the outer shelf during the LGM and earlier glacia l periods.  

The continental rise is dominated by thick sedimentary deposition centers and by sediment drifts, both of which indicate stron g bottom-current activity. Seismic data analysis from the Amundse n Sea rise reveals that sediment drift formation began in the Eocene/Oligocene (Uenzelmann-Neben and Gohl, 2012, 2014) (Figur e F3). This observation indicates bottom-current activity and hence  a cold climate for the late Paleogene in the area that today probabl y lies under the influence of Antarctic Bottom Water originating i n the Ross Sea. Seismic records from the continental rise along th e entire Marie Byrd Land margin mark the base of the sediment drift s throughout the Amundsen Sea and into the Ross Sea (Lindeque e t al., 2016a, 2016b). These records provide insight into the sedimentation processes from preglacial to glacial times, variations in bottom-water  circulation,  early  ice  sheet  growth,  and  glacial intensification toward the present icehouse regime (UenzelmannNeben and Gohl, 2012, 2014). However, stratigraphic age estimate s are derived from long-distance seismic correlation with the wester n Antarctic Peninsula margin and the Ross Sea margin and hampe r this insight.  

Seismic records from the Amundsen Sea shelf show dippin g strata of the midshelf that are possibly of Cretaceous to Miocene ag e and buried by aggradational, less consolidated strata of presume d Pliocene–Pleistocene age (Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Gohl et al., 2013b). Preliminary results from a seabed drilling expedition plac e constraints on the Cretaceous sequences on top of the outcroppin g bedrock of the middle to inner shelf of Pine Island Bay (Gohl et al., 2017). Since the mid-Miocene, the outer shelf and slope have undergone first progradational and then aggradational deposition (Nitsche et al., 1997; Hochmuth and Gohl, 2013; Gohl et al., 2013b). Several unconformities that possibly indicate phases of subglacial erosion and ice advance separate the dipping strata. Although mos t of the inner Amundsen Sea shelf is void of significant sedimentar y cover (Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Graham et al., 2009; Gohl et al., 2013a, 2013b), a few small, shallow basins lie along its eastern border (Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 2007) and in front of Pine Islan d Glacier (Nitsche et al., 2013; Muto et al., 2016).  

A bathymetric and structural high (Nitsche et al., 2007; Gohl e t al., 2013b) separates the eastern and western Amundsen Sea continental shelves. Oceanward-dipping midshelf strata north of the outcropping basement are evident in seismic data from the DotsonGetz Trough (Wellner et al., 2001; Graham et al., 2009; Weigelt e t al., 2009; Gohl et al., 2013b) and exhibit alternating sequences o f low and high reflectivity that are interpreted to be Miocene episodes of ice sheet advance and retreat. The glacial sequence stratigraphic model by Powell and Cooper (2002) proposed that glacial advances develop morainal banks consisting of unstratified diamicton, sand, and gravel that lead to a chaotic or semitransparent seismic reflection pattern. In contrast, stratified muds are deposite d during a glacial retreat, which is expressed in seismic profiles as  a succession of closely spaced continuous reflectors. Boundaries between the acoustic units are sharp, but without drilling, the timin g of ice sheet oscillations remains unconstrained. Similar seismic facies occur on the Ross Sea and Antarctic Peninsula shelves, wher e drill cores confirmed that the chaotic/transparent units correspon d to massive diamicton and acoustically stratified seismic facies correspond to distal glacimarine sediments (Anderson and Bartek, 1992; Bart and Anderson, 2000; Eyles et al., 2001).  

The current seismostratigraphic model of the Amundsen Se a shelf was developed by long-distance correlation of seismic dat a with those of the Ross Sea shelf, which show striking similaritie s (Gohl et al., 2013b). Adopting the ages of the seismostratigraphi c units and unconformities on the Ross Sea shelf, which are relativel y well constrained by DSDP Leg 28 and ANDRILL records (e.g., D e Santis et al., 1999; McKay et al., 2009), the shelf-basin formatio n model for the Amundsen Sea shows development from a Cretaceous synrift basin to glacially dominated strata in the Neogene an d Quaternary (Gohl et al., 2013b). The seismostratigraphic recor d from the continental shelf is consistent with records from the Ros s Sea (Bartek et al., 1991; Chow and Bart, 2003) and James Ross Basi n in the northwestern Weddell Sea (Smith and Anderson, 2010), indicating a Miocene intensification of glaciation (De Santis et al., 1997 ) in accordance with findings from Core AND-2A (Warny et al., 2009; Passchier et al., 2011) and the Shallow Scientific Drilling on th e Antarctic Continental Margin (SHALDRIL)-II drill cores (Anderson et al., 2011; Anderson and Wellner, 2011).  

Apart from ice sheet dynamics inferred from the geometries an d acoustic facies of seismic reflections, the ice-drainage pattern in th e Amundsen Sea at the LGM and its substrate control were investigated by the analysis of sub- and proglacial bedforms visible i n swath bathymetry surveys and acoustic subbottom profiler dat a (e.g., Larter et al., 2009). The subglacial bedforms on the shelf indicate that grounded ice expanded to the outer shelf or even the shel f edge during the recent past (Wellner et al., 2001; Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Graham et al., 2009, 2010; Jakobsson et al., 2012; Nitsch e et al., 2013). Analysis of subglacial and glacimarine sediments recovered in cores from the continental shelf confirmed an LGM ag e for the last WAIS advance, allowed a reconstruction of its retrea t history (Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Smith et al., 2011, 2014; Kirshner et al., 2012; Hillenbrand et al., 2013; Larter et al., 2014), and indicated dynamically evolving drainage systems (Ehrmann et al., 2011).  Recently,  studies  of  benthic  foraminiferal  assemblage s (Minzoni et al., 2017) and the chemical composition (i.e., stable carbon isotopes and magnesium/calcium ratios) of benthic and planktonic foraminifer shells in ice-proximal marine sediments from th e inner shelf (Hillenbrand et al., 2017) showed that variable inflow o f CDW was the primary driver for grounding-line retreat along th e coast of the Amundsen Sea Embayment throughout the Holocen e and since the 1940s. Sedimentary sequences from the Amundse n Sea continental slope and rise spanning glacial–interglacial cycle s to $1.8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ were investigated by multiproxy analyses to find evidenc e for or against a WAIS collapse during the Quaternary (Hillenbran d et al., 2002, 2009; Konfirst et al., 2012), as was previously suggeste d (e.g., Scherer et al., 1998; Scherer, 2003). One of these studies foun d a mid-Pleistocene depositional anomaly that may indicate a WAI S collapse between 621 and 478 ky ago (Hillenbrand et al., 2009). Al l of these studies provide a robust sedimentological framework fo r interpreting drill cores.  

# Objectives  

The scientific goals and plan for this expedition are built on fiv e hypotheses about WAIS dynamics and related paleoenvironmenta l and paleoclimatic conditions.  

Hypothesis H1: the WAIS responded to atmospheric and oceani c warming by a major retreat from the shelf or by even partial to ful l collapse.  

Ice sheet models hypothesize that past climate warming cause d significant deglaciation of the WAIS (e.g., DeConto and Pollard, 2016). For instance, during the early middle Pliocene, Earth’s climate was ${\sim}3^{\circ}C$ warmer than at present (e.g., Haywood et al., 2009 ) and thus as warm as predicted for the end of this century, althoug h atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was ${\sim}400$ ppm and other climatic boundary conditions were similar to the present (Pagani et al., 2010). The reason s for such a high atmospheric temperature during a time with modes t greenhouse-gas forcing are still unknown. Results from Core AND1B suggest repeated WAIS collapses during warm early middle Pliocene and Pleistocene interglacials (e.g., during Marine Isotope Stag e [MIS] 31) (Naish et al., 2009; Pollard and DeConto, 2009; McKay e t al., 2012; Villa et al., 2012). The hypothesis of WAIS collapses need s confirmation with a less ambiguous record from an outlet drainag e basin exclusively affected by the WAIS. In drill cores from th e Amundsen Sea margin, WAIS collapses would be recognizable b y biogenic sedimentary sequences deposited during times with permanent open-water conditions and reduced supply of glacigenic debris  from  the  West  Antarctic  hinterland  similar  to  thos e documented in the Core AND-1B record (Naish et al., 2009). Suc h sediments would contain abundant microfossils and probabl y tephra layers from the Marie Byrd Land volcanic province (e.g., L e Masurier and Rex, 1991; Wilch et al., 1999), which are essential fo r dating the sediments and reconstructing paleoenvironmental conditions in the region. Thus, the cores will help to answer the crucial question: did the WAIS collapse during the Neogene and Quaternary, as previously suggested, and if yes, when and under which environmental conditions?  

Hypothesis H2: ice-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in th e Amundsen Sea correlate with global records of ice-volume change s and proxy records for atmospheric and ocean temperatures.  

The post-LGM retreat of the WAIS from the Amundsen Se a shelf was episodic (e.g., Lowe and Anderson, 2002; Graham et al., 2009, 2010; Jakobsson et al., 2012; Larter et al., 2014). The retrea t episodes were likely triggered by different processes, including se a level rise, sub–ice shelf erosion by warm deep-water advection, destabilization of the ice sheet by subglacial meltwater outbursts, an d grounding-line retreat into overdeepened inner-shelf basins (Jakobsson et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2011, 2014; Kirshner et al., 2012; Hillenbrand et al., 2013, 2017). These observations raise question s concerning the linkage between climate and glaciological forcing i n regulating WAIS deglaciation. Throughout the Cenozoic era, unexplained discrepancies are observed between Earth’s temperatur e and global ice volume reconstructed from proxies in deep-sea sediments, climate models, sea level estimates, and ice cores for the las t $800\;\mathrm{ky}$ . Reexamination of previously studied cores highlights ongoing uncertainty about the timing of early ice sheet growth (Carter e t al., 2017). The results of the Core AND-1B record (Naish et al., 2009) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 318 to th e Wilkes Land margin (Cook et al., 2013) reignited the debate as t o whether the Antarctic ice sheets underwent major collapses durin g Pliocene interglacials. Such collapses are neither directly recognizable from oxygen isotope proxies at far-field sites nor confirmed b y the apparently persistent glaciation of the Antarctic Peninsula sinc e the latest Miocene (Smellie et al., 2009) and repeated Pliocene ic e sheet advances across the shelf that are observed in seismic profile s all along the Antarctic margin (e.g., Larter et al., 1997; Nitsche et al., 1997; Bart and Anderson, 2000; Smith and Anderson, 2010; Bart, 2001). Indeed, results from SHALDRIL cores and other data fro m the eastern Antarctic Peninsula shelf indicate gradual cooling an d an associated decline in vegetation over the past 37 My culminatin g in early Pliocene ice sheet expansion onto the continental shelf (Anderson et al., 2011). Results from ODP Leg 178 cores from the western Antarctic Peninsula margin are consistent with repeated ic e sheet advances throughout the Pliocene (Eyles et al., 2001; Hillenbrand and Ehrmann, 2005; Hepp et al., 2006; Bart, 2001) but als o indicate significant oceanic warming during Pliocene interglacial s (Hillenbrand and Cortese, 2006; Escutia et al., 2009; Hepp et al., 2009; Bart and Iwai, 2012). Expedition 379 drill sites will help us decipher whether the WAIS responded directly to the orbitally pace d climatic cycles of the Pliocene and Quaternary or varied at period s determined by its internal dynamics, as findings from Leg 178 suggest for the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet (Barker and Camerlenghi, 2002). Similar to cores from the Ross Sea and Antarctic Peninsul a shelves (Eyles et al., 2001; McKay et al., 2009), the Leg 178 cores ar e incomplete because of glacial erosional unconformities. During Expedition 379, cores were drilled from deep-sea drifts on the continental rise of the Amundsen Sea Embayment to obtain complet e sedimentary sequences. Similar drift sediments drilled on the western Antarctic Peninsula continental rise during Leg 178 provide d excellent archives of Neogene to Quaternary ice sheet dynamics an d paleoenvironmental changes (e.g., Hillenbrand and Ehrmann, 2005; Cowan et al., 2008; Hepp et al., 2006, 2009; Escutia et al., 2009; Bar t and Iwai, 2012). A comparable potential has already been demonstrated for Pleistocene drift sediments recovered from the Amundsen Sea continental rise (Hillenbrand et al., 2009).  

Hypothesis H3: the stability of marine-based WAIS margins i s and has been controlled by warm deep-water incursions onto th e shelf.  

In model experiments, incursions of relatively warm CDW ont o the West Antarctic continental shelf have been implicated in regulating WAIS behavior on orbital and suborbital timescales (Thom a et al., 2008; Pollard and DeConto, 2009; Jenkins et al., 2016). Therefore, records of past CDW upwelling are urgently needed to understand  the  relationship  between  WAIS  dynamics  and  ocea n circulation. Generating proxy records of past CDW incursions fro m marine sediment cores is still a challenge but was recently demonstrated to be possible in sediments from the Amundsen Sea Embayment shelf (Hillenbrand et al., 2017; Minzoni et al., 2017). Wit h recent observations of present CDW advection predominantl y through the paleo–ice stream troughs of the Amundsen Sea (e.g., Arneborg et al., 2012), drilling on the continental shelf has a goo d chance to recover sample material suitable for applying benthic foraminifer–based and other proxies to reconstruct past CDW upwelling onto the shelf and its effect on WAIS dynamics.  

Hypothesis H4: major WAIS advances onto the middle and oute r shelf have occurred since the middle Miocene.  

Seismic data revealed progradational and aggradational deposition on the outer shelf and slope of the Amundsen Sea probabl y since the mid-Miocene (e.g., Nitsche et al., 1997, 2000; Hochmut h and Gohl, 2013; Gohl et al., 2013b). Numerous unconformitie s within strata on the shelf document frequent advance and retreat o f grounded ice from the late Miocene until the Pliocene/Pleistocene, according to the stratigraphic age model by Gohl et al. (2013b). Th e preservation of buried grounding-zone wedges in the Pliocene/Pleistocene sequence on the outer Amundsen Sea shelf is consistent wit h the prolonged continuous accumulation of marine and glacimarin e sediments in an open-marine setting, probably during a long interglacial period with a significantly reduced WAIS, as observed on th e Ross Sea shelf during the early Pliocene. However, the models o f grounded-ice advance and retreat across the Amundsen Sea shelf ar e based on long-distance correlations of seismic facies and characteristics, which are tested by core data to constrain past WAIS extent.  

Hypothesis H5: the first WAIS advance onto the inner Amundse n Sea continental shelf occurred during the Oligocene and was relate d to the uplift of Marie Byrd Land.  

The onset of major glaciation in West Antarctica is still no t dated because of sparse drill cores. Records of IRD suggest that glaciers must have reached the coast of the Ross Sea in the early t o mid-Oligocene (Miller et al., 2008). Ice sheet models (e.g., DeCont o and Pollard, 2003) reconstructed an early WAIS nucleus in th e mountain chain extending from elevated Marie Byrd Land over th e Ellsworth Mountains to the southern Antarctic Peninsula. The exhumation and erosion history of Marie Byrd Land and especially th e Marie Byrd Land dome is essential for the interrelations between ic e sheet and lithosphere dynamics (e.g., Rocchi et al., 2006; Wilson an d Luyendyk, 2009; Wilson et al., 2012, 2013; Spiegel et al., 2016) because (1) exhumation and erosion change topography, which in tur n influences glacier movements by slope steepness; (2) exhumation i s often associated with surface uplift, and high altitude favors formation of glaciers; and (3) glaciation changes erosion rates and, because of isostatic adjustment, exhumation rates. This relationship i s investigated using detailed provenance and thermochronological analyses of Neogene drill samples from the midshelf and existin g rock samples from the hinterland.  

# Operations plan/drilling strategy  

The primary aim of our drilling campaign was to obtain core an d log data from seaward-dipping strata along a transect from the Paleogene sequences close to the boundary with bedrock on the inner shel f to the Pliocene to Pleistocene sequences on the outer shelf and continuing onto the continental rise for continuous high-resolution records. Because sea ice conditions during the drilling expedition wer e unsuitable for accessing either the priority sites in Pine Island Troug h or the transect targeting strata of comparable age and cross-shelf position in the Dotson-Getz Trough, a paleo–ice stream trough of th e western Amundsen Sea Embayment, we drilled our third-tier priorit y sites on the continental rise. The sites we drilled during Expeditio n 379 were added to the proposal following the record sea ice in th e 2017/2018 austral summer. The two sites (U1532 and U1533) wer e not lower in priority than other rise sites; instead, they were added t o the proposal in 2018 when sites were no longer required to be on  a crossing seismic line. This change provided an opportunity for alternates even farther north, and thus farther from likely sea ice cove r than the originally proposed sites. Additional modifications in 201 8 to our original proposal included approval of “ribbons” along the seismic line that allowed holes to be drilled in a range of positions and fo r maximum flexibility in severe ice conditions.  

Our plan was to core two holes at each drill site using the advanced piston corer (APC), half-length advanced piston core r (HLAPC), and extended core barrel (XCB) system in the first hol e and the rotary core barrel (RCB) system in the second hole and the n collect log data in the deeper RCB hole. In reality, each of our tw o drill sites included far more holes than intended. Site U1532 includes seven holes, and Site U1533 has four holes. No holes wer e terminated by reaching target depths; we terminated the first 1 0 holes because of approaching icebergs, and we had to abandon th e final hole because of an emergency medical evacuation.  

The coring strategy at each site generally followed the operational plans; however, it was spread out over multiple holes. Whe n we were forced to leave a hole, we drilled a new hole without corin g through the upper section, and then coring resumed with som e overlap. We initiated new holes following a standard offset of $20\;\mathrm{m}$ except when ice conditions would not allow a new hole close to th e original site and other positions along the permitted ribbon wer e open. Thus, the holes at each site are more spread out than those o f many other IODP expeditions.  

Although downhole logging was planned for each site, no downhole log data were collected during Expedition 379 because of th e premature termination of each hole.  

# Site summaries Site U1532  

# Background  

Site U1532 (proposed Site ASRE-08A) is located on the wester n upper flank of a large sediment drift (Resolution Drift) on the continental rise, $270~\mathrm{km}$ north of the Amundsen Sea Embayment shel f edge (Figures F1, F4). This drill site was chosen as the first Expedition 379 site upon arriving in the Amundsen Sea because the sea ic e distribution did not allow drilling at any of the other primary or alternate sites at that time. The Resolution Drift belongs to a syste m of five parallel sediment drifts on this rise that are characterized b y gentle western and steep eastern flanks. Sediment drifts are commonly formed by deposition of suspended sediments transporte d by ocean-bottom contour currents. Deep-sea channels that originate at the foot of the continental slope and reach far into the abyssal plain separate the sediment drifts in the Amundsen Sea. Sediment is transported downslope through these channels by turbidity currents, slumps, and other gravity-driven processes tha t supply a large portion of the detritus deposited in the drifts (Nitsch e et al., 2000; Dowdeswell et al., 2006). Sedimentation rates of drif t deposits along the Antarctic margin are extremely high, whic h makes them high-priority drill targets to obtain continuous paleoceanographic and paleo–ice sheet records of high temporal resolution  (Uenzelmann-Neben  and  Gohl,  2012).  Stratigraphi c interpretations of seismic lines across the sediment drifts of th e Amundsen Sea (e.g., Nitsche et al., 2000; Scheuer et al., 2006b; Uenzelmann-Neben and Gohl, 2012, 2014) are so far only constraine d by long-distance correlation with drilled records of drift deposits o n the Antarctic Peninsula rise (Leg 178; e.g., Acton et al., 2002). However, the interpretations suggest equally high sedimentation rate s for the Pleistocene, Pliocene, and upper Miocene.  

Seven holes (U1532A–U1532G) were drilled in $3962\textrm{m}$ wate r depth (Figure F5). The deepest hole (U1532G) was drilled to $794\;\mathrm{m}$ . Overall core recovery was $90\%$ . Although sea ice was not a proble m for the R/V JOIDES Resolution at this site, icebergs of various sizes, from large tabular icebergs to smaller fragments and growlers, frequently approached the ship and were the primary reason for th e large number of holes. Holes U1532E and U1532F were nothin g more than unsuccessful attempts to start coring at depth before being forced to avoid another approaching iceberg.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Deposits recovered at Site U1532 include silty clay with dispersed sand and gravel and variable biogenic content from fiv e holes down to a recovered core depth of $787.4\mathrm{~m~}$ . Six lithofacie s were identified based on visual characteristics of the sediment s combined with information from smear slides and thin sections. Whole-core $\mathrm{X}$ -radiographs aided in observations of sedimentar y structures, clast occurrence, and drilling disturbance. The dominant lithofacies assemblages are planar thinly laminated silty cla y with episodic occurrences of massive and bioturbated silty clay typically $_{<1.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick. We observed dispersed sand grains, granules, and occasional pebbles throughout the assemblages, but they appear mainly concentrated within the massive and bioturbated facies. Minor lithofacies include foraminifer-rich and biosiliceousrich mud to ooze.  

We identified one lithostratigraphic unit with three subunit s based on changes in facies assemblages: Subunits IA $(0{-}92.6\,\mathrm{~m};$ Pleistocene–Pliocene), IB $\!\!\!^{72.6-400.6\;\mathrm{m};}\!\!$ Pliocene), and IC (401.0– $787.4\;\mathrm{m};$ ; Pliocene–Miocene). The sediments are mostly unconsolidated in the upper $150\ \mathrm{m}$ and become increasingly more consolidated below this depth. Intervals of carbonate-cemented lamina e and very thin beds of coarse siltstone and sandstone are presen t deeper than $400\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Biostratigraphy  

In the upper part of the section recovered at Site U1532 (i.e. , Subunit IA; $0{-}92\;\mathrm{m})$ ), sufficient microfossils for biostratigraphic ag e assignment were only present in the upper ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , providing an ag e of middle Pleistocene to recent $(0.0{-}0.6\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). Based on diatom an d radiolarian biostratigraphy, ${\sim}92{-}156\mathrm{~m~}$ is assigned a mid- to lat e Pliocene age of $3.2–3.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and ${\sim}156{-}224\mathrm{~m~}$ is assigned an earl y Pliocene age of $3.8–4.4\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ . The absence of microfossils or onl y trace occurrences of highly fragmented and recrystallized siliceou s microfossils in samples deeper than ${\sim}224\mathrm{~m~}$ in Hole U1532G precluded shipboard biostratigraphic age determination at most levels. Exceptions include short intervals with poorly preserved but identifiable diatoms between ${\sim}224$ and $332\textrm{m}$ (early Pliocene; ${<}4.7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ) and between $\sim\!332$ and $510\,\textrm{m}$ (early Pliocene to near the Miocene/Pliocene boundary; ${<}5.5\,\mathrm{Ma}]$ ).  

Some  light  green,  biosiliceous-rich  intervals  coincide wit h higher concentrations of coarse sand and gravel, which are inferre d to be IRD, and are generally bioturbated. Other intervals that wer e sampled based on their lower density than the laminated silt y clay(stone) have a greenish color and show evidence of bioturbatio n but lack identifiable biosiliceous material, which we infer, at least i n part, to reflect a diagenetic loss of diatoms and other siliceou s microfossils. Organic microfossils occur throughout the Site U153 2 sequence. A possibly in situ dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblage of very low diversity and low abundance is present throughou t the section but is most persistent deeper than $591.77\;\mathrm{m}$ . Calcareou s microfossils including foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, an d ostracods generally occur in the absence of biosiliceous material i n thin intervals in the Pleistocene section.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The interpreted magnetic polarity at Site U1532 was correlate d with the Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale (GPTS) of Gradstein et al. (2012). The resulting key paleomagnetic data were then integrate d with biostratigraphic data to produce an age model.  

For Hole U1532A, we obtained reliable shipboard magnetostratigraphy that consists of four normal and four reversed polarit y intervals. The Brunhes–Matuyama polarity transition $(0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , the termination and beginning of the Olduvai Subchron (1.778 an d 1.945 Ma, respectively), the Matuyama–Gauss polarity transitio n $(2.581\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , the termination and beginning of the Kaena Subchro n (C2An.1r; 3.032 and 3.116 Ma, respectively), and the terminatio n and beginning of the Mammoth Subchron (C2An.2r; 3.207 an d $3.330\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ , respectively) were identified. Paleomagnetic measurements for Hole U1532B identified the beginning of the Mammot h Subchron (C2An.2r; 3.330 Ma) and the Gauss–Gilbert polarit y transition  (3.596 Ma).  Paleomagnetic measurements for  Hol e U1532C identified the termination of the Nunivak Subchro n (C3n.2n; 4.493 Ma) but no clear Cochiti Subchron (C3n.1n; 4.187– $4.300\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measurement s for Hole U1532G identified the beginning of the Nunivak Subchro n (C3n.2n; 4.631 Ma), the termination and beginning of the Sidufjall  

Subchron (C3n.3n; 4.799 and $4.896~\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), and the termination and beginning of the Thvera Subchron (C3n.4n; 4.997 an d $5.235~\mathrm{~Ma}$ , respectively). Reversed magnetic polarity continue s downhole to the bottom of Hole U1532G. The beginning of Chro n C3r (6.033 Ma) was not observed. Therefore, the oldest sediment s recovered at Site U1532 are presumably of late Miocene age.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1532, 65 interstitial water samples were collected an d measured for salinity, alkalinity, ${\mathsf{p H}}$ , major ions (Na, K, Ca, Cl, an d $\mathrm{SO}_{4})$ , nutrients $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right.$ and $\mathrm{PO}_{4},$ ), silica $\mathrm{(H_{4}S i(O H)_{4})}$ , and trace elements (Sr, Li, Fe, Mn, B, and Ba). Drilling fluid contamination wa s detected in a few interstitial water samples taken from XCB cores. Higher abundances of perfluorocarbon tracer in these samples ar e in line with this observation. The $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ downhole profile shows  a sharp linear decrease from ${\sim}28\;\mathrm{mM}$ near the surface to ${\sim}2.3\mathrm{\mM}$ a t ${\sim}664\mathrm{~m};$ ; however, $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ concentration did not reach zero at this site, indicating a low $S O_{4}$ reduction rate. The $C\mathbf{a}$ and Sr profiles show a n overall increase, whereas the K and $\mathrm{Mg}$ profiles display the revers e trend. Silica concentration is relatively high from 8.5 to $238\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , coinciding with intervals where a higher abundance of diatoms was observed. Diagenesis of diatoms through reaction with the interstitia l water likely results in higher silica concentration.  

Calcium carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ content is low in the sediments o f Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA; discrete maxima in $C a C O_{3}$ observe d in the upper section of Subunit IA are linked to layers rich in calcareous foraminifer tests. Subunit IB is characterized by a general increase in $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ downhole. Total organic carbon (TOC) content i s generally low at Site U1532 but displays a stepwise increase fro m Subunit IA to Subunit IC. Total nitrogen content is low throughou t all subunits. Total sulfur (TS) content decreases throughout Subuni t IA and generally remains low throughout Subunit IB. TS displays  a downhole increase in the uppermost section of Subunit IC (to ${\sim}533$ m). Deeper than ${\sim}533\mathrm{~m~}$ , TS declines again and then shifts to lo w values deeper than ${\sim}670\mathrm{~m~}$ . This shift in TS content is associate d with a near depletion of interstitial water sulfate concentrations, which may limit sulfate reduction.  

Headspace gas samples to monitor for the presence and abundance of $C_{1}-C_{3}$ hydrocarbons indicate that methane occurs in onl y very low concentrations throughout the upper ${\sim}650~\mathrm{m}$ . At ${\sim}667~\mathrm{m},$ methane concentration increases rapidly, exceeding 5000 ppm v deeper than ${\sim}713\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and reaching a maximum of 9517 ppmv a t ${\sim}771\mathrm{~m~}$ . The increase of methane at ${\sim}667~\mathrm{m}$ coincides with a pronounced minimum in sulfate, suggesting that methane may be biogenic at Site U1532.  

# Physical properties  

Collected physical property data include magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma radiation (NGR), gamma ray attenuation (GRA ) bulk density, discrete moisture and density (MAD), $P$ -wave velocity , thermal conductivity, in situ formation temperature (advanced piston corer temperature tool [APCT-3]), and spectral color reflectance. Whole-round magnetic susceptibility trends follow thos e observed in GRA bulk density and NGR, likely indicating change s in terrigenous sediment content. Magnetic susceptibility data wer e used as a primary tool for correlating cores from adjacent holes. I n the upper $65\;\mathrm{m}$ , bulk density increases downhole from ${\sim}1.5$ to ${\sim}1.8$ $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , followed by a more gradual increase to ${\sim}2.2~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ in th e deeper section, reflecting increasing compaction. Intervals of significantly lower density correspond to greenish gray intervals i n Lithostratigraphic Subunits IB and IC. Sediment porosity decrease s downhole from $77\%$ at the seafloor to $60\%$ at $30\textrm{m}$ and decrease s further with depth to $35\%$ at the bottom of Hole U1532G, reflectin g the downward compaction trend of marine sediments. $P.$ -wave velocity increases with depth from ${\sim}1460\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at the seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}2000$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ at the base of Hole U1532G. No major changes in $P$ -wave velocity were observed across the lithostratigraphic subunit boundaries. Overall,  thermal  conductivity  increases  with  depth  from ${\sim}1$ $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m\cdotK})$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}1.8\;\mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ at ${\sim}390\;\mathrm{m},$ correspondin g to a downhole increase in dry bulk density and decrease in porosit y because of compaction. Formation temperature measurement s from 34.0 to $150.0\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1532A were used to estimate a geothermal gradient of ${\sim}54^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

# Site U1533  

# Background  

Site U1533 (proposed Site ASRE-09A) is located $62\,\mathrm{km}$ westsouthwest of Site U1532 on the westernmost lower flank of Resolution Drift, the same sediment drift as Site U1532, on the continental rise of the Amundsen Sea (Figures F1, F6). This lower flank i s bound by a north-south–oriented deep-sea channel west of Sit e U1533 (Uenzelmann-Neben and Gohl, 2012). The channel is likel y the path of sediment transported downslope from the shelf by turbidity currents and sediment gravity flows and, as such, is likely th e major source of terrigenous sediment to the drill site (e.g., Dowdeswell et al., 2006). Bottom currents transported clay- and silt-size d particles before they deposited them to form a drift (e.g., Nitsche e t al., 2000). A robust horizon correlation from Site U1532 was performed along three connected seismic lines, indicating that sedimentary sequences of the same age are more condensed at Sit e U1533.  

Four holes (U1533A–U1533D) were drilled at Site U1533 in water depths between 4179 and $4184\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F7). The deepest penetration (Hole U1533B) reached $383\;\mathrm{m}$ with an overall core recover y of $70\%$ . As at Site U1532, frequent approaches of icebergs of variou s sizes were the primary reason for the large number of holes.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Sediments recovered at Site U1533 consist mainly of silty cla y with varying biogenic content and amounts of bioturbation as well as rare occurrences of diamict and conglomerate. Thin sand and sil t beds and laminae occur throughout, and intervals of carbonate cementation and volcaniclastic material were also observed. The recovered sediments are categorized into seven lithofacies based o n visual characteristics and lithologic information supported b y smear slide observations. The drilled sequence is divided int o Lithostratigraphic Subunits IA and IB based on changes in facies assemblages. Whole-core X-radiographs were used to aid in the identification of sedimentary structures, clast occurrence, and drillin g disturbance. Site U1533 is dominated by deposition of fine-graine d sediments interpreted to be initially supplied by sediment gravit y flows from the continental shelf and subsequently reworked by contour currents. Silt and sand beds are interpreted to have been deposited by overspill of turbidity currents from the submarin e channel. Additionally, a significant amount of biosiliceous material in the sediments is supplied from the overlying surface waters.  

The association of facies in Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA predominantly reflects the interplay of downslope and contouritic sediment supply that also includes input of more pelagic sedimen t during phases of seasonally open marine conditions. The amount o f biogenic material is generally high throughout Subunit IA, suggesting relatively sustained periods of high marine productivity. Deposits related to downslope transport are present throughout th e sedimentary record at Site U1533. In Subunits IA and IB, coarsegrained beds probably indicate that overspill deposition originate d from downslope transport through the adjacent deep-sea channel. Subunit IB has generally higher amounts of visible clasts and pebbles than Subunit IA. Dispersed granules and pebbles, clast nests, and discontinuous bands of coarse sand and granules in Subunits I A and IB are inferred to indicate persistent but likely low-intensity ic e rafting, and there is a higher abundance of this IRD within diato m ooze intervals.  

# Biostratigraphy  

In contrast with Site U1532, which contains significant interval s that are barren of microfossils, the majority of Site U1533 sample s from the mudline to the lowermost sediments contain microfossils. Preservation and abundance of microfossils are highly variable, including some barren intervals noted in the uppermost Pliocene– lowermost Pleistocene and lower Pliocene sections. A similar general pattern of alternating gray-beige to brownish sediments (Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA) and gray-beige to greenish sediment s (Subunit IB) at Site U1532 was commonly observed at Site U153 3 and consisted of gray, laminated, microfossil-poor, mostly terrigenous mudstones punctuated by thinner brownish to greenish bioturbated, variably biosilica-bearing intervals, some with sand t o pebble-sized material interpreted to be IRD. However, the brownis h and greenish bioturbated units have a higher overall concentratio n of biosiliceous material than at Site U1532.  

The upper ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ of Site U1533 spans the Pleistocene and contains variable concentrations of diatoms, radiolarians, and foraminifers; rare marine and reworked terrestrial palynomorphs; and ver y rare calcareous nannofossils. Diatoms and radiolarians are presen t in most samples examined from this interval. Foraminifers are present only in a few intervals in the upper ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m}$ of the sequence.  

Pleistocene to upper Miocene sediments recovered from Hol e U1533B are dated primarily by diatoms and radiolarians. Both ar e documented with variable abundance from the top to the bottom o f Hole U1533B. Samples from the lowermost cores generally contai n common to abundant diatoms, although the assemblages are highl y fragmented. Diatoms and radiolarians provide a latest Miocene ag e $(6.2{-}6.7\ \mathrm{Ma})$ for the lowermost sediments recovered from Hol e U1533B; combined with magnetostratigraphic constraints, th e deepest sediments recovered in Hole U1533B are ${\sim}6.4–6.75\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils were not observed in th e Pliocene sediments in Hole U1533B, whereas rare to common marine and reworked terrestrial palynomorphs are present throughou t the hole.  

# Paleomagnetism  

For Hole U1533A, demagnetization of NRM at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ identifie s the Brunhes–Matuyama transition $(0.781\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , the termination an d beginning of the Jaramillo Subchron (C1r.1n; 0.988 and $1.072\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), and the termination and beginning of the Cob b Mountain Subchron (C1r.2n; 1.173 and $1.185\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively).  

The magnetostratigraphy for Hole U1533B is more comple x than for Hole U1533A because of reduced core recovery and drilling disturbance of some intervals. The shipboard interpretatio n identifies the beginning of the Olduvai Subchron $(\mathrm{C2n};\,1.945\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), the termination and beginning of Subchron C2An.1n (2.581 an d $3.032\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), the termination and beginning of Subchro n C2An.3n (3.330 and $3.596\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), the termination an d beginning of the Cochiti Subchron (C3n.1n; 4.187 and $4.300\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), and the termination and beginning of the Nunivak Subchron $(C3\mathrm{n}.2\mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{{)}}}$ ;  4.493  and  4.631  Ma,  respectively).  Subchro n C2An.2n (3.116–3.207 Ma) might be present in a very condense d form in Core 379-U1533B-5H at ${\sim}58\mathrm{~m~}$ . Further downhole, paleomagnetic measurements reveal the termination and beginning o f the Sidufjall Subchron $(\mathrm{C}3\mathrm{n}.3\mathrm{n};\,4.799$ and $4.896~M{\mathrm{a}}$ , respectively ) and the termination and beginning of the Thvera Subchro n $(\mathrm{C}3\mathrm{n}.4\mathrm{n};4.997$ and $5.235\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively). Below an interval without core recovery, the oldest cores, 39R and 43R, are of mainly normal polarity, suggesting a bottom age for Hole U1533B between th e termination of Subchron C3An.1n $(6.033\;\mathrm{Ma})$ and the beginning o f Subchron C3An.2n (6.733 Ma). Oscillating normal and reversed polarity at the bottom of Hole U1533B provides no clear evidence tha t Subchron C3Ar was recovered.  

For Hole U1533C, no magnetic polarity reversal was recorded , suggesting that the recovered sediments are younger than the Brunhes–Matuyma transition (0.781 Ma).  

For Hole U1533D, paleomagnetic measurements identified th e Brunhes–Matuyama transition (0.781 Ma), the termination and beginning of the Jaramillo Subchron $(\mathsf{C}\mathrm{1r}.\mathrm{1n};0.988$ and 1.072 Ma, respectively), the termination and beginning of the Cobb Mountai n Subchron (C1r.2n; 1.173 and $1.186\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively), and the termination and beginning of the Olduvai Subchron (C2n; 1.778 an d $1.945\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively).  

# Chronostratigraphy  

By combining biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy, th e interval shallower than ${\sim}37~\mathrm{m}$ is assigned a Pleistocene age, ${\sim}37-$ $265~\mathrm{m}$ is assigned a Pliocene age, and ${\sim}265{-}383\ \mathrm{m}$ (base of recovery at Site U1533) is assigned a latest Miocene age. The combine d data indicate a 6.4–6.75 Ma age for the base of Hole U1533B a t $381.23~\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water salinity at Site U1533 is constant at 35 from th e seafloor to ${\sim}235\mathrm{~m~}$ and is slightly lower (33 to ${\sim}34$ ) from 255 to 37 5 m. Chloride (Cl) concentration ranges between 557 and $596~\mathrm{mM_{\mathrm{r}}}$ , with the latter concentration being slightly higher than the averag e concentration in modern seawater $({\sim}559\,\mathrm{\mM})$ . The elevated Cl could be due to hydration reactions during clay formation. Sodiu m (Na) concentration ranges between 440 and $483\,\mathrm{\mM}$ throughou t the section. Deeper than ${\sim}17\,\mathrm{~m~}_{\mathrm{{]}}}$ , sulfate $\left(\mathrm{SO_{4}}\right)$ decreases continuously with depth and reaches its minimum $(-1.6\;\mathrm{mM})$ at $375\;\mathrm{m}$ . Interstitial water alkalinity increases linearly with depth from $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ t o a maximum $({\sim}10.5~\mathrm{mM})$ at $\mathord{\sim}185\ \mathrm{m},$ which is the opposite trend t o that of $S O_{4}$ . Deeper than ${\sim}185\mathrm{~m~}$ , alkalinity slightly decreases wit h depth to $255\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Strontium (Sr) concentration increases overall from $85~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ a t $1.5\,\textrm{m}$ to $196~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $255\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , reaching maximum values ${\sim}2$ time s higher than that of the modern seawater value $(87\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$ . The highe r Sr concentration indicates either higher fluid-rock reaction wit h volcaniclastic material or dissolution of carbonates.  

Methane concentration is ${\sim}4$ ppmv, which is close to the instrumental background signal, in Hole U1533A and most of Hol e U1533B. At $325.60\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , methane concentration abruptly increase s downhole to a peak of 6373 ppmv at $375.02\mathrm{~m~}$ . No hydrocarbon s other than methane were detected at Site U1533. Increased methane was found only at the base of Lithostratigraphic Subunit IB, where the lowest $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ was observed. Together with the absence o f higher hydrocarbons, this suggests a biological source of methane a t Site U1533.  

Total carbon content varies between 0.02 and $0.5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and increases with depth. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ is low at Site U1533 and ranges betwee n 0.02 and $2.54\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC content varies between 0.01 and $0.41~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and is similar in terms of trends and abundances to the TC record, indicating that organic carbon constitutes most of the total carbo n pool.  

Samples for contamination testing were collected from the exterior and center of freshly exposed core sections or whole-roun d samples. Perfluorocarbon tracers were present in variable concentrations in samples taken from most APC core exteriors because o f the direct exposure of the core surface to circulating drilling fluids. However, tracer concentrations are approximately four orders o f magnitude lower in these samples than the target concentrations o f tracers in the drilling fluid. Tracers were below detection in the interior of most APC and HLAPC cores. The absence of tracers in th e central parts of most APC/HLAPC cores and their generally lo w presence in core exteriors suggest low overall contamination. XC B cores generally show low contamination in both the interior and exterior samples, but in contrast to APC/HLAPC cores, contamination was consistently present in the center of the cores. The sample d RCB cores generally showed higher levels of tracer contaminatio n than APC/HLAPC and XCB cores.  

# Physical properties  

Measured whole-round magnetic susceptibility ranges betwee n $4.7\times10^{-5}$ and $804.6\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}.$ . Average magnetic susceptibility value s increase downhole from $\sim\!50\,\times\,10^{-5}$ to ${\sim}100\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\mathrm{~SI~}$ at ${\sim}55\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , which corresponds to the Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA/IB boundary. Within this general downhole increase, the upper ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{~m~}$ o f Holes U1533A, U1533C, and U1533D exhibit a “saw-tooth” patter n of magnetic susceptibility cyclicity, wherein a sharp increase i n overall magnetic susceptibility is followed by a more gradual decline. Magnetic susceptibility data were used as a primary tool fo r correlating cores from adjacent holes to create a shipboard splice fo r the uppermost ${\sim}44\mathrm{~m~}$ of the site. Measured NGR ranges betwee n 13.5 and 235.1 counts/s with an overall average of 56.1 counts/s. Average NGR values increase downhole from $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s at th e mudline to ${\sim}75$ counts/s at ${\sim}55\mathrm{~m},$ , which corresponds to the Subunit IA/IB boundary. Deeper than ${\sim}55\;\mathrm{m}$ , NGR varies cyclically between $\mathord{\sim}20$ and 75 counts/s. NGR values follow trends observed i n magnetic susceptibility and GRA bulk density values except for th e saw-tooth variability observed in the upper parts of the holes, whic h likely indicates changes in the ratio between biogenic and terrigenous sediment content. The GRA bulk density record shows  a sharp downhole increase from ${\sim}1.3$ to ${\sim}1.8~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ in the uppermos t ${\sim}55\;\mathrm{m}$ that corresponds to Subunit IA. Below this depth, GRA density exhibits several stepwise changes. The overall increase in GR A bulk density with depth at this site reflects the increasing compaction of sediment with depth. Smaller scale variability indicate s changes in sediment lithology and correlates well with NGR an d magnetic susceptibility variability. MAD bulk density increase s sharply downhole from ${\sim}1.3~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}1.7~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ a t ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m},$ , corresponding to a sharp decrease in porosity and void ratio. From ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ to the bottom of Hole U1533B at ${\sim}383\;\mathrm{m}$ , bulk densit y increases more gradually.  

$P$ -wave logger (PWL) velocity increases with depth, rangin g from ${\sim}1480\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}1620\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at ${\sim}205\;\mathrm{m}$ . $P_{\|}$ -wave caliper (PWC) measurements track well with the PWL measurement s for the upper ${\sim}205\ \mathrm{m},$ showing a gradual increase with depth. PW C velocity continues to increase as consolidation increases with dept h to an average velocity of ${\sim}1780\,\mathrm{m/s}$ at ${\sim}380\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Thermal conductivity increases with depth from ${\sim}0.7\ \mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}1.4~\mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ at ${\sim}375\mathrm{~m~}$ and corresponds to  a downhole increase in dry bulk density and decrease in porosit y from compaction.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment Operational considerations related to the science objectives  

Expedition 379 accomplished drilling and coring at two ver y successful sites on the continental rise of the Amundsen Sea. Drilling at Site U1532, on a large sediment drift, penetrated to $794\;\mathrm{m}$ $90\%$ recovery), making this site the deepest drilled in West Antarctica with a ship-based rig and resulting in the longest drill core recovered in all of Antarctica drilled with a ship-based rig. W e collected almost continuous core from the Pleistocene through th e Pliocene and into the late Miocene. At Site U1533, we drilled t o $383\;\mathrm{m}$ $70\%$ recovery) into the more condensed sequence at th e lower flank of the same sediment drift. The cores from both site s contain unique records with which to study the cyclicity of ice shee t advance and retreat processes as well as bottom-water circulatio n and water mass changes. In particular, Site U1532 revealed a sequence of Pliocene lithofacies with an excellent paleomagnetic record for high-resolution climate change studies of the previousl y sparsely sampled Pacific margin of West Antarctica.  

Despite the drilling success at both sites, the overall expeditio n experienced three difficulties that affected many of the scientific objectives of all five hypotheses of Proposal 839 and the Scientific Prospectus:  

1. The extensive sea ice on the continental shelf prevented us from drilling any of the primary proposed sites located on the shelf. The two sites that we did successfully drill were added to the project in early 2018 after the record-setting sea ice that austral summer covered all approved primary and alternate sites from the proposal, forcing the creation of additional alternate plans. The sea ice remaining from 2018 became multiyear ice in 2019, limiting the breakout that could happen in a single season. During Expedition 379, sea ice was never at a level low enough for JOIDES Resolution to enter the shelf, even when sea ice became less concentrated between the continental rise and the open-water polynya where many of the shelf sites are located.   
2. On the continental rise, we faced a steady stream of icebergs of various sizes that approached the ship and frequently forced us to pause drilling or leave the hole entirely. The overall downtime caused by approaching icebergs was $50\%$ of our time spent on site (Table T1). This large iceberg abundance in the Amundsen Sea during the austral summer was possibly unprecedented and may have been caused by major calving events of the ice shelves during the last $2{-}3\,\mathrm{y}$ .   
3. Because of an unfortunate injury to a member of the ship’s crew, we had to cut the expedition short by one week. Before the accident, which led to a medical evacuation, we intended to complete Site U1533 by coring all of the Miocene and possibly into the Oligocene, complete downhole logging for the first time during the expedition, and collect APC cores at proposed Primary Site ASRE-05B near the foot of the continental slope, which had become accessible in the days before. Although all three of these goals likely would not have been possible in the last 7 days of the cruise, it is likely at least two of them would have been achieved.  

Because of these three unexpected and extreme circumstances, we were unable to achieve many important objectives, including obtaining ice-proximal shelf records and collecting cores from th e Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum, the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, and the Eocene–Oligocene transition. Drilling sites are neede d to obtain ice-proximal records from these transitions for a full understanding of the proximal glacial history in this region, which i s one of the key components of IODP’s transect approach to understanding high-latitude climate history. The Expedition 379 site s were designed to obtain records of past warm deep-water incursions onto the shelf that are the cause of present melting. Model s suggest that the current incursion of warm deep-water to the bas e of the ice is an unsustainable situation, but we do not yet have records showing whether warm water has encroached onto the shel f in the past and, if so, how the ice responded. The study of such records from the shelf is one of the central scientific objectives of th e proposal for Expedition 379.  

# Preliminary assessment of scientific objectives  

The scientific objectives for this expedition were built on fiv e hypotheses about the dynamics of the WAIS and related paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions. Based on a preliminary analysis of the core material and data collected during th e expedition, we assess each of the five hypotheses below.  

From the outset, Expedition 379 included a wide range of primary and alternate sites to allow for drilling in a range of sea ic e conditions. All five objectives were addressed at most sites, bot h primary and alternate. However, the third tier of drill targets on th e continental rise, proposed in case of extreme sea ice cover, coul d only be used to address the first three hypotheses directly, and unfortunately these third-tier sites were the only sites achieved durin g Expedition 379. Nonetheless, high-quality core recovery combine d with slight modifications to our research approach allows each hypothesis to be addressed to some degree.  

Sites U1532 and U1533 are located on a sediment drift deposit, th e Resolution Drift, on the continental rise north of the Amundsen Se a Embayment shelf edge (Figure F1). Coring at both sites recovered relatively undisturbed sequences from the late Miocene to Quaternary.  

Coring at Site U1532 recovered silty clay with dispersed san d and gravel and variable biogenic content in five holes to a core dept h of $787~\mathrm{m}$ (Figures F4, F8). Linear sedimentation rate calculated between magnetostratigraphic age control points shows a significan t downcore increase in sedimentation rate that averages ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ i n the Pleistocene, ${\sim}18~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the middle Pliocene, and ${\sim}41\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the latest Miocene to early Pliocene section. The highest sedimentation rate documented, ${\sim}61\ \mathrm{cm/ky},$ is between 4.49 and 4.6 3 Ma. The lowest sedimentation rate in the Pliocene section ( $[{\sim}10\$ $\mathrm{{cm/ky})}$ is calculated between 4.63 and $4.80\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and may indicate  a transient decrease in sediment flux to the site or possibly the presence of a short hiatus in this interval.  

Sediments recovered at Site U1533 consist mainly of silty cla y with varying biogenic content and amount of bioturbation and rar e occurrences of diamict and conglomerate intervals. Four holes wer e drilled at this site, reaching a total core depth of $382.6\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figure s F6, F9). Similar trends in sedimentation rates are documented a t Sites U1532 and U1533, but sedimentation rates are 2–3 time s lower at Site U1533. Linear sedimentation rate shows an overal l downcore increase in accumulation rate, which averages ${\sim}1.4$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the Pleistocene, ${\sim}5.4~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ between ${\sim}4.5$ and $2.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ i n the Pliocene, and ${\sim}15.5\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ between ${\sim}5.2$ and $4.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ in the earliest Pliocene. The highest sedimentation rate $({\sim}21{-}22\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ a t  

Site U1533 is in the early Pliocene between 4.493 and 4.631 Ma an d between 4.997 and 5.235 Ma. The lowest sedimentation rate in th e Pliocene section of Site U1533 $({\sim}3\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ is between 4.631 an d $4.799\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . A similar decrease in sedimentation rate is thus inferre d for the same time interval at Sites U1532 and U1533 and Leg 17 8 Site 1095 on the Antarctic Peninsula (Acton et al., 2002), which ma y indicate a regional decrease in terrigenous sediment flux betwee n 4.63 and $4.80\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Hypothesis H1: the WAIS responded to atmospheric and oceanic warming by a major retreat from the shelf or by even partial to full collapse.  

A primary goal of Expedition 379 is to reconstruct the glacia l history of West Antarctica from the Paleogene to recent times wit h a focus on the dynamic behavior of the WAIS during the Neogen e and Quaternary, especially possible partial or even full WAIS collapses. Particular emphasis is placed on studying the response of th e WAIS at times when the $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ in Earth’s atmosphere exceeded 40 0 ppm and atmospheric and oceanic temperatures were higher tha n at present.  

Recovery of core on the continental rise at Sites U1532 an d U1533 cannot give a direct answer regarding the configuration o f glacial ice on the shelf or retreat of the ice sheet across the shelf. However, the sediments contained in the cores offer a range of clue s about past ice sheet extent and retreat. At both sites, coarse-graine d sediments interpreted to be IRD were identified throughout all recovered time periods. Cyclicity is a dominant feature of the core s and is interpreted to represent relatively warmer periods variabl y characterized by higher microfossil abundance and higher counts o f ice-rafted debris alternating with colder periods characterized b y dominantly gray laminated terrigenous muds. A revised age model will be completed after the expedition, and tuning of Expedition 37 9 data sets to precise time periods will follow. However, an initial comparison of these cycles with published late Pleistocene record s from the region (e.g., Hillenbrand et al., 2009) suggests that th e units interpreted as records of warmer time intervals in the core s are tied to interglacial periods and the units interpreted as deposit s of colder periods are tied to glacial periods. Postexpedition work t o determine IRD accumulation rates over time will allow identification of pulses of glacial sediment input that may be representative o f major calving events.  

More specific evidence of major collapse will come from studying the provenance of the IRD at the drill sites. IRD pulses ofte n represent major calving events, although the signal can be ambiguous because it may simply be a local increase in accumulation or, barring detailed age constraints, a signal of decreased flux of finegrained material. Therefore, layers rich in IRD will be targets fo r more detailed studies aimed at identifying the provenance of th e IRD. Coarse grains will be identified by visual description and geochemical analyses that will also be applied to fine-grained detritus, including Sr-Nd signatures, to determine the source of glacigeni c sediment deposited on the Resolution Drift. A change in provenance over time at the site will be an indication of varying position s of the grounding line. Specific isotopic signatures, including Pb isotopes, will be used to identify patterns of bedrock weathering tha t may indicate specific source rocks were exposed subaerially. Additionally, different clay mineral signatures with geochemical analyse s (including Sr-Nd) in the fine-grained fraction may be identified a s having come from specific regions onshore, allowing further identification of the source of sediment shed to the region and thus indicating how far the ice may have retreated.  

These combined signals will allow reconstruction of the ic e sheet since the late Miocene based on the amount and source o f sediment shed to the region. Results from ANDRILL Core AND-1 B suggest repeated WAIS collapses during warm early middle Pliocene and Pleistocene interglacials (e.g., during MIS 31) (Naish et al., 2009; Pollard and DeConto, 2009; McKay et al., 2012; Villa et al., 2012). The hypothesis of WAIS collapse needs confirmation with  a less ambiguous record from an outlet drainage basin exclusively affected by the WAIS. The cores recovered during Expedition 37 9 cannot give such unambiguous information; however, the records o f glacigenic sediment delivery to the sites will give an integrated signal that will record major changes in ice sheet extent.  

# Hypothesis H2: ice-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in the Amundsen Sea correlate with global records of ice-volume changes and proxy records for atmospheric and ocean temperatures.  

A goal of Expedition 379 is to correlate the WAIS-proximal records of ice sheet dynamics in the Amundsen Sea with global records of ice volume changes and proxy records for air and seawate r temperatures. As described above, the initial interpretation of core s from Sites U1532 and U1533 shows repeated alternations betwee n different facies interpreted to represent glacial–interglacial cycles. Comparison with dated gravity and piston cores nearby (e.g., Hillenbrand et al., 2002, 2009) suggest that the cycles identified in core s from both sites are correlative with global oxygen-isotope records. The pattern holds at least as far back as MIS 35, and thus severa l “superinterglacials” have been recovered. Ongoing work will focu s on tuning the age model, particularly for Pliocene warm interval s that are not yet well constrained, to confirm these initial interpretations and allow more detailed analysis, including deconvolving th e glacial–interglacial signals from what may be independent change s in ocean currents bringing sediment to the drill sites.  

Work on proxies will be conducted to determine paleoceanographic characteristics, including temperature, salinity, curren t speed, and water mass origins. These data, which are independen t of the specific age model, will allow the record of ice sheet fluctuations to be tied to local temperature and current information as wel l as to the global records of ice volume.  

# Hypothesis H3: the stability of marine-based WAIS margins is and has been controlled by warm deep-water incursions onto the shelf.  

Today, the dramatic Amundsen Sea sector ice loss is attribute d to incursions of warm CDW reaching the base of the ice shelve s fringing the WAIS (Joughin et al., 2014). Such incursions have bee n identified in the Holocene (Hillenbrand et al., 2017; Minzoni et al., 2017) and recent sediments (Smith et al., 2017), but it is unclea r how often such incursions have happened farther in the past or ho w the ice may have responded. Therefore, another goal of Expeditio n 379 is to study the relationship between incursions of CDW ont o the continental shelf of the Amundsen Sea Embayment and the stability of marine-based ice sheet margins under such warm-wate r conditions. Postexpedition work will try to fingerprint water masse s flowing across the drill site, and multiple proxies will estimate wate r temperature, including both lipid paleothermometers and foraminifer stable isotopes. However, most of these analyses will yield details of either surface water or bottom-water masses, not th e middle-depth signature of CDW, mainly because of the lack of proxies that can yield clear information for that middle depth. Nonetheless, estimates of broad-scale temperature changes will be tied t o  

IRD and other records of ice sheet change, allowing correlation between temperature at the drill sites and ice behavior.  

# Hypothesis H4: major WAIS advances onto the middle and outer shelf have occurred since the middle Miocene.  

The aim during Expedition 379 was to obtain records from various sites on the shelf of the Amundsen Sea Embayment from unconformities within strata that document frequent advance an d retreat of grounded ice from the late Miocene until the Pliocene/Pleistocene. Seismic data reveal progradational and aggradational deposition on the outer shelf and slope probably since th e mid-Miocene (e.g., Nitsche et al., 1997, 2000; Hochmuth and Gohl, 2013; Gohl et al., 2013b). The seismic stratigraphic age model of th e shelf sequences by Gohl et al. (2013b) is only constrained by far-distance correlation of seismic reflection characteristics and patter n with those observed and age-dated from the Ross Sea shelf (e.g., D e Santis et al., 1999) because of the lack of deep drill sites on th e Amundsen Sea shelf. The fact that we were unable to access th e open-water polynya on the middle shelf with JOIDES Resolution during Expedition 379 because of sea ice on the outer shelf prevented us from obtaining such direct shelf records.  

The drill cores from both rise sites, however, recovered sediments of terrigenous origin intercalated or mixed with pelagic o r hemipelagic deposits. In particular, Site U1533, which is locate d near a deep-sea channel running from the lower continental slop e to the abyssal plain, contains graded beds as well as clasts transported downslope from the shelf by turbidity currents or othe r gravitational transport processes.  

The association of lithologic facies in both sites predominantl y reflects the interplay of downslope and contouritic sediment suppl y with more pelagic sediment input during phases of seasonal-ope n marine conditions, which is consistent with a greater amount o f biogenic material and suggests relatively sustained periods of relatively high marine productivity. Recovered dispersed granules an d pebbles, clasts, and discontinuous bands of coarse sand and granules in the cores are inferred to indicate persistent but likely lowintensity ice rafting that may have increased periodically durin g warmer periods. Because these observations can be made throughout the Pleistocene and Pliocene and into the late Miocene, we ca n infer from drilling that grounded ice frequently covered most of th e Amundsen Sea shelf since at least the late Miocene.  

Despite the lack of drill cores from the shelf, our records fro m the continental rise reveal the timing of glacial advances onto th e shelf and thus the existence of a continent-wide ice sheet in Wes t Antarctica for prolonged periods since at least the late Miocene. Hypotheses of earlier phases of WAIS expansion in the Amundse n Sea sector remain untested by drill records.  

# Hypothesis H5: the first WAIS advance onto the inner Amundsen Sea continental shelf occurred during the Oligocene and was related to the uplift of Marie Byrd Land.  

The relationship between the onset of major West Antarctic glaciation and the continental paleotopography necessary for growin g a substantial ice sheet has so far only been addressed by numerical modeling (DeConto and Pollard, 2003; Wilson et al., 2013). Suc h modeling indicates an elevated Marie Byrd Land might be require d for a large ice sheet to form in the Amundsen Sea/Marie Byrd Lan d sector. Seismological models show that a low-velocity, presumabl y hotter than normal mantle exists beneath Marie Byrd Land toda y (e.g., Lloyd et al., 2015). The objective of Expedition 379 is to reveal evidence from drill records that will allow a reconstruction of th e timing and rates of an uplift that has been inferred by studies of th e Marie Byrd Land dome exhumation and erosion history (e.g., Rocchi et al., 2006; Wilson and Luyendyk, 2009; Wilson et al., 2012, 2013; Spiegel et al., 2016). The latest thermochronological stud y suggests an uplift not earlier than early Miocene (Spiegel et al., 2016).  

Although we were unable to drill cores for detailed provenanc e and thermochronological analyses of samples from the shelf, core s from both rise sites contain abundant coarse-fraction sediment s and clasts of plutonic origin transported either by downslope processes or by ice rafting. The common lithic types are polycrystallin e quartz and K-feldspar granite. Biotite-bearing leucogranite and diorite are also present. If detailed provenance studies confirm our preliminary assessment that the origin of these samples is plutoni c bedrock of Marie Byrd Land, their thermochronological record wil l potentially reveal timing and rates of denudation and erosion linke d to crustal uplift.  

The chronostratigraphy of both drill sites enables the generatio n of a seismic sequence stratigraphy not only for the Amundsen Se a rise but also for the western Amundsen Sea along the Marie Byr d Land margin through a connecting network of seismic lines. A detailed analysis of correlated seismic unit boundaries and unconformities will allow reconstruction of the Marie Byrd Land dome uplif t at least back to the earliest age-dated horizons of the late Miocen e and, with an appropriate seismic stratigraphic age model using estimates on earlier sedimentation rates, possibly even back to the Oligocene or earlier.  

In addressing the objectives of this hypothesis, the thermochronological analyses and seismic sequence stratigraphy will make us e of the drilled core samples and the core data from independen t methods to test the hypothesis of the Marie Byrd Land uplift and it s role in early ice sheet evolution.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in 7 holes at Site U1532 (Propose d Site ASRE-08A) and 4 holes at Site U1533 (Proposed Site ASRE09A) (Table T1). At Site U1532, coring penetrated to $794.0~\mathrm{m}$ wit h an overall recovery of $90\%$ . At Site U1533, we cored to a total dept h of $382.6\;\mathrm{m}$ with  

• Multiple holes recovering a complete stratigraphic section in the uppermost $50\,\mathrm{m}$ ,   
• Excellent recovery with APC/HLAPC coring downhole to 205.8 m,   
• Moderate recovery $(63\%)$ ) with XCB coring from 205.8 to 283.9 m, and   
• Low recovery $(15\%)$ from 283.9 to $382.6\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

We spent a total of 23.7 days at Site U1532 and 11.68 days at Sit e U1533. Drifting icebergs caused multiple interruptions that resulte d in nearly half of this time at both sites (11.46 and 5.22 days, respectively) being spent waiting for ice to clear the area or performin g operations not originally planned (pipe trips, reentries, abandone d holes, or repeated drilled intervals). The frequency of interruption s caused by drifting icebergs and significant variations in their spee d and direction proved problematic. Ultimately, deployment of a freefall reentry system shortly after starting to drill into the seafloor wa s required for us to penetrate deeply at each site $\mathrm{^794.0\m}$ in Hol e U1532G and $382.6\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1533B).  

We had to stop drilling operations 6.2 days earlier than originally planned (at $1448\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 March 2019) to return to Chilean waters to evacuate an injured crew member.  

Unless otherwise noted, all depths are calculated as core dept h below seafloor, Method A (CSF-A), and are reported as $^{\ast}\mathbf{m}^{\,:}$ ” All times in this report are in ship local time $\mathrm{(UTC-3\h)}$ . In this section, we also document the start of the expedition in Punta Arenas, Chile, the transits to Sites U1532 and U1533, drilling operations a t the sites, and the transit back to Punta Arenas.  

# Punta Arenas port call and transit to Site U1532  

The Amundsen Sea Expedition was planned to start on 18 January 2019. However, the ship arrived a few days early (15 January ) after the long transit from Hong Kong. This time was used to loa d special Antarctic fuel on 15–16 January at the Cabo Negro Oil Terminal. The ship departed Cabo Negro at $1206\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 January an d was at anchorage off Punta Arenas, Chile, at $1438~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 January. The ship left anchorage at $0548~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 January, and after a ver y short transit arrived at the Prat Terminal 2, Punta Arenas, at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ . The rest of the day was spent loading and installing a critical piec e of drilling hardware (repaired J-connector) and a few other availabl e supplies. Expedition 379 Amundsen Sea officially started at $0800~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 January with the Co-Chief Scientists and staff of the JOIDE S Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) boarding the ship. The JRS O staff conducted their crossover with the departing staff who lef t later in the afternoon. Other port call activities included a Port Stat e Inspection and loading of 60 tons of drilling mud, a flat of drillin g equipment, food and other catering supplies, and various IODPJRSO and ship stores. The JRSO technical staff started with preparations to assemble and install the new X-ray system for acquirin g images of core sections.  

The Expedition 379 scientists boarded the ship on the mornin g of 19 January. After getting settled in their rooms, the scientist s were introduced to life on board JOIDES Resolution, general laboratory safety, and information technology resources/services. Othe r port call activities included loading the final drilling hardware, securing all items for departure, and continued assembly and testin g of an alternate satellite communication system because our normal system was not expected to work effectively in our area of operations.  

On 20 January, the science party met to discuss the primary science objectives of the Amundsen Sea expedition and participated i n the Captain’s introduction and safety meeting. The Co-Chief Scientists, Operations Superintendent, Ice Observers, JRSO Assistant Director, JRSO Manager of Development, IT, and Databases, an d Expedition Project Manager met to converge on shipboard procedures for ice and weather data to be used for science operational planning. We also loaded fresh and frozen food and secured equipment for departure. The JRSO technical staff continued with the final installation and testing of the new X-ray system.  

On January 21, we continued securing equipment for departur e and waited for the arrival of additional backup satellite communications systems required to maintain essential communications,  a backup wireline logging tool (Versatile Seismic Imager [VSI]), an d heaters for the life raft release system required under the polar cod e for us to sail. Also, the Captain was evaluating the weather to determine the optimum timing and route for departing Punta Arenas.  

The backup wireline logging tool (VSI) and the essential backu p satellite communications systems were received on 22 January. Installation of the backup communications systems began immediately while waiting for the heaters for the life raft release syste m scheduled to arrive the following day.  

At $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January, we departed the dock and moved offshore to anchorage to make way for the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer. While at anchorage, we received the last remaining supplies necessary to sail. We were cleared by immigration and departed for th e Amundsen Sea at $1418\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 23 January. Because of significan t weather and seas to the west, we took the eastern route through th e Strait of Magellan. The total transit from Punta Arenas to the firs t proposed site (ASRE-09A) was ${\sim}1800~\mathrm{nmi}$ . The pilot departed th e ship at $2024~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January, and we exited the Strait of Magella n into the South Atlantic shortly after. Late in the day of 24 January, we departed the Atlantic Ocean through the Le Maire Strait, whic h is the passage between the Argentine portion of Tierra del Fueg o and Isla de los Estados; entered the Southern Ocean; and starte d heading southwest toward the Amundsen Sea.  

At the start of our transit, ice and weather data indicated tha t none of the continental shelf sites and only a few of the continenta l rise sites could be occupied, and forecasts led us to aim for Proposed Site ASRE-09A. During our transit, evolving data, forecasts, and science priorities led us to change our first site to Proposed Sit e ASRE-08A, which is ${\sim}33\ \mathrm{nmi}$ east of Proposed Site ASRE-09A. After a transit of $1770\ \mathrm{nmi}$ over 7.3 days at an average speed of 10. 1 $\mathrm{nmi/h}$ , we arrived at Site U1532 at $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January.  

# Site U1532  

We conducted operations in 7 holes at Site U1532 (Table T1) . We cored in 5 holes, collectively recovering core from the seafloo r to $787.41\mathrm{~m~}$ (Holes U1532A–U1532D and U1532G) with an overal l recovery of $90\%$ . Two holes penetrated substantially into the seafloor but had to be abandoned before coring could start because o f approaching ice (Holes U1532E and U1532F). We spent a total o f 23.7 days at Site U1532. Drifting icebergs caused multiple interruptions that resulted in nearly half of this time (11.46 days) being spen t waiting for ice to clear the area or performing operations not originally planned (pipe trips, reentries, or repeated drilled intervals). The frequency of interruptions caused by drifting icebergs and significant variations in their speed and direction proved problematic. In Hole U1532G, deployment of a free-fall reentry system shortl y after starting to drill into the seafloor allowed us to core to $787\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Hole U1532A  

We arrived at Site U1532 at $2100~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January. We lowere d the thrusters, switched to dynamic positioning mode at $2145\,\mathrm{h}$ , an d began drill floor operations. After assembling the outer core barre l and spacing out the inner core barrel, we started assembling an d lowering the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) to the seafloor. $\mathrm{On~}31$ January, we finished assembling the remaining drill collars an d spent the first half of the day lowering the drill string to the seafloo r and verifying the internal diameter clearance and length of eac h piece of the drill string. At $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 January, we installed the to p drive and pumped two pigs down through the drill string to clea n the inside of the drill pipe before coring. After adjusting the bit t o $3968.6~\mathrm{m}$ below the rig floor, we installed the APC core orientatio n tool, lowered the APC core barrel, and started coring in Hol e U1532A at $1650\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 January.  

Core 1H recovered $5.63\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , resulting in a seafloor depth o f 3961.5 mbsl. Cores 1H through 11H penetrated from 0 to $100.6\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $103.04\mathrm{~m~}$ $(102\%)$ . All APC cores were oriented, an d formation temperature measurements were made with the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) coring shoe whil e taking Cores 4H $\left(34.0\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , 7H $\left(62.6\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , and 10H $\left(91.1\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ . After recovering Core 11H, we had to stop coring at $0645\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 Februar y because of a combination of approaching ice and increasing difficulty observing ice caused by fog and snow and a slight swell. W e raised the bit to $50\;\mathrm{m}$ with the intention of resuming coring in Hol e U1532A after conditions improved. Instead, we pulled the bit out o f the hole at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 February, raised the bit $100\,\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor, and spent until $0015\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February adjusting our position t o maintain a safe distance from ice. Although we had a free-fall funnel (FFF) readied for deployment, we did not deploy it given the balanc e between the time it would take to deploy the FFF and reenter i t compared to the time it would take to redrill to $100\;\mathrm{m}$ in a new hol e and resume coring from there.  

# Hole U1532B  

After the drill floor was cleared to resume operations, we offse t the ship $20\textrm{m}$ to the east of Hole U1532A and started drilling i n Hole U1532B at $_{0125}\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February. We drilled from the seafloo r to $93.1\;\mathrm{m}$ without coring, recovered the XCB core barrel with a center bit, and started APC coring. The first core in Hole U1532B (Cor e 2H) arrived on the rig floor at $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February. While we wer e taking the next core (3H), we had to pause coring again because o f approaching ice. We raised the bit to $50.5~\mathrm{m}$ and waited for the ic e to clear from 0800 to $1515~\mathrm{h}$ . We then resumed APC coring, an d Core 4H ( $112.1{-}121.6\mathrm{~m~}$ with a formation temperature measurement) arrived on deck at $1800~\mathrm{h}$ . Before it was laid out on the ri g floor, approaching ice forced us to stop coring again. We raised th e bit to $50.5~\mathrm{m}$ and waited from 1830 to $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February befor e being able to lower the bit to the bottom of the hole and resume coring at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

We continued APC coring and recovered Cores 5H through 9 H $(121.6{-}169.1\ \mathrm{m}$ with a formation temperature measurement o n Core 7H). After recovering Core $\mathrm{9H}$ , approaching ice forced us t o pause coring again at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February, and the bit was raised t o $50.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . We were able to resume operations at $0900\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , so we lowere d the bit to $169.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and resumed coring. Core 10H was a partial stroke with the lowermost core liner deformed and a crack extending up the entire core liner. Core 10H recovered $6.48\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , so we advanced the bit $6.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and switched to HLAPC coring. After Core 11 F $^{(175.6-180.3\;\mathrm{m})}$ was recovered, approaching ice once again force d us to pause coring at $1315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February, and we had to raise th e bit to $50.5~\mathrm{m}$ . Unfortunately, the ice kept converging on our location, so we eventually had to pull the bit completely out of the hol e at $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February. Once again, we decided not to deploy a FF F and opted instead to drill to $180\,\mathrm{m}$ in the next hole and resume coring from that depth. We spent the rest of the 3 February positionin g the ship to avoid the drifting ice. Overall, Hole U1532B was drille d without coring from the seafloor to $93.1\textrm{m}$ . APC/HLAPC corin g penetrated $87.2\textrm{m}(93.1–180.3\textrm{m})$ and recovered $91.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(105\%)$ ).  

# Hole U1532C  

At $0000~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 February, we were able to resume operations . The ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to the south of Hole U1532B, and at 003 5 h on 4 February we started drilling into the seafloor in Hol e U1532C. We drilled without coring from the seafloor to $178.3\;\mathrm{m}$ b y $0415\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . After retrieving the core barrel with the center bit use d during the drilling, we started HLAPC coring. Core 2F (178.3–183. 0 m) arrived on deck at $0630~\mathrm{h}$ . This core was positioned to overla p with the deepest core in Hole U1532B (Core 11F; $175.6{-}180.3\ \mathrm{m})$ ). Cores 2F through 11F $[178.3–225.3\mathrm{~m})$ were recovered, but approaching ice forced us to pause coring at ${\sim}1630\ \mathrm{h}$ on 4 February. The barrel for Core 12F had already been deployed and had to b e recovered before we raised the bit to $61.9~\mathrm{m}$ . We received the approval to resume operations at $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 February, so we lowere d the bit to the bottom of the hole and resumed HLAPC coring. Afte r Cores 12F through 18F penetrated from 225.3 to $258.2\,\mathrm{~m~}_{\!}$ , w e switched to the XCB system. Cores 19X through 22X penetrate d from 258.2 to $291.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $10.18~\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $31\%$ ), after which Core s 20X and 21X only recovered $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . At $1445\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 February, as Cor e 22X arrived at the rig floor, approaching ice forced us to pause coring and raise the bit to $50.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . We were able to resume operations a t $1715~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 February. After lowering the bit to the bottom of th e hole, we took Cores 23X and 24X ( $291.0{-}310.1\ \mathrm{m};\,18.05\ \mathrm{m}$ recovered, $95\%$ ).  

Just as Core 24X arrived on the rig floor at $2355\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 February, we had to stop coring again and raise the bit to $50.5~\mathrm{m}$ because o f approaching ice. At $0530~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 February, we resumed operation s and started lowering the bit to the bottom of the hole. The bit encountered a bridge in the hole at $172.5\ \mathrm{m},$ , so we deployed an XC B core barrel with a center bit to drill through it and then washed th e bit down to the bottom of the hole at $310.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . We circulated 25 bb l of mud to clean cuttings out of the hole and retrieved the center bi t to resume XCB coring. Just as we were about to drop the XCB barre l to start coring, approaching ice put operations on hold again. Thi s time, however, we kept the bit near the bottom of the hole. At 154 5 h on 6 February, the ice moved away and we resumed XCB coring. After Cores 25X through 33X penetrated from 310.1 to $392.3\:\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , approaching ice and diminishing visibility caused by snow forced us t o pause coring, and Core 33X was pulled after only penetrating $5.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . At this point, we decided to abandon further XCB coring and switc h to RCB coring because  

• Penetrating deeply at this site was a primary objective and would require RCB coring,   
• RCB coring may result in better quality core at the current hole depths, and   
• We wanted to take advantage of the time spent waiting for ice and environmental conditions to improve.  

We started recovering the drill string at $1315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 February. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1520\,\mathrm{h},$ and we continued raising th e drill string. Overall, Hole U1532C was drilled without coring fro m the seafloor to $178.3~\mathrm{m},$ , and HLAPC/XCB coring penetrated 214. 0 $\mathsf{m}~(178.3\mathrm{-}392.3\mathrm{~m})$ and recovered $179.6\mathrm{~m~}$ $(84\%)$ . We did not consider deploying a FFF in Hole U1532C and opted to start a new hol e instead because this would provide better chances of coring deepl y with the RCB. Hole U1533C was drilled/cored with an $11\%$ inc h bit, and we had been in the hole for nearly 4.5 days; both factor s contributed to an oversized uppermost top of the hole. Reusing thi s hole would have hampered our ability to core deeply with th e smaller diameter RCB bit $9\%$ inches).  

# Hole U1532D  

We finished recovering the drill string and the APC/XCB BH A with the bit arriving on the rig floor at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 February. Afte r laying out the APC/XCB-specific parts of the BHA (seal bore an d nonmagnetic drill collars), the drill crew started putting togethe r the RCB BHA. Some extra time was required to fix a couple of issues identified by the routine verification of the drill collar interio r diameter and core barrel space out in the BHA. From 0700 to 143 0 h on 8 February, we lowered the bit until it was $21.5~\mathrm{m}$ above th e seafloor. We then installed the top drive, deployed a center bit, an d adjusted the drill string to prepare for starting Hole U1532D. W e planned to start RCB coring at ${\sim}362\;\mathrm{m}$ to overlap with the deepes t cores from Hole U1532C. Unfortunately, at $1545\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 February w e had to pause operations because of approaching ice. We maneuvered the ship to avoid the ice until it cleared the area. We were finally able to start drilling into the seafloor at $2142\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 8 February. We drilled without coring to $247.2\;\mathrm{m}$ by $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February. Unfortunately, at this time approaching ice forced us to raise the bit t o $55.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . The rig floor was cleared to resume operations at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 9 February, and we lowered the bit to the bottom of the hole. A t $1715~\mathrm{h},$ , we dropped an RCB core barrel with a center bit and resumed drilling from $247.2\,\textrm{m}$ . At $2300\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 9 February, the bi t reached $362.7\;\mathrm{m}$ and we started to recover the center bit to prepar e for RCB coring.  

We deployed an RCB core barrel at $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 February an d started RCB coring in Hole U1532D. After Cores 2R through 3 R penetrated from 362.7 to $381.9\,\mathrm{~m},$ , at $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 February approaching ice forced us to raise the bit to just below the seafloor. The ice kept converging, so we had to pull the bit completely out o f Hole U1532D at $0605~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 February. We did not have sufficien t time to deploy a FFF before having to pull out of the hole. Overall, Hole U1532D was drilled without coring from the seafloor to 362. 7 m, and RCB coring penetrated $19.2~\mathrm{m}$ $(362.7\substack{-381.9\mathrm{~m}})$ ) and recovered $17.42\;\mathrm{m}\;(91\%)$ .  

# Hole U1532E and U1532F  

Instead of waiting for the ice to pass and allow us to resume operations, we decided to move ${\sim}0.4~\mathrm{nmi}$ to the northwest along th e seismic reflection profile and start a new hole. After waiting until $1145\,\mathrm{h}$ for ice to clear the area, we started drilling without coring i n Hole U1532E, and the bit reached $101.6\:\mathrm{m}$ at $1445\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 February. Increasing winds, snow, and swell made it difficult to visually trac k smaller pieces of ice, which do not show clearly on the radar. This, combined with larger ice in the area, made us pause operations an d raise the bit to just below the seafloor $\left(48.6\mathrm{~m}\right)$ . Unfortunately, a t $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 February approaching ice forced us to pull the bit completely out of Hole U1532E. Because we had not penetrated significantly and the ice was converging on our position quickly, we di d not choose to deploy a FFF. We raised the bit to $105~\mathrm{m}$ above th e seafloor to wait for the ice to move out of the area. We took advantage of this downtime to conduct routine servicing of the drill lin e (slip and cut). We moved back to the location of Holes U1532A– U1532D and started drilling without coring in Hole U1532F at 231 5 h on 10 February. We planned to start RCB coring at ${\sim}378\ \mathrm{m},$ jus t above the maximum coring depth in Hole U1532D. We drilled without coring from the seafloor to $105.1\;\mathrm{m}$ , where we had to stop to fi x a hydraulic hose in the top drive $(0230{-}0430\ \mathrm{h}$ on 11 February). When the bit reached $321.4\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (at $1630~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 February), approaching ice forced us to stop drilling, recover the RCB core barrel with the center bit, and raise the bit to just below the seafloor (45. 5 m). Again, the ice was converging on our position too quickly to deploy a FFF. We pulled the bit out of seafloor at 1921 h on 11 February and waited for the ice to clear the area with the bit just above th e seafloor.  

# Hole U1532G  

At $0900~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 February, we decided that because of the frequency of ice interruptions, a reentry system more substantial tha n a FFF would be required for the multiple reentries needed to cor e deeply. So, we removed the top drive and recovered the drill string, and the bit arrived on the rig floor at $1845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 February. Whil e recovering the drill string, we started preparing the parts of a freefall reentry system (casing shoe, one joint of casing, mud skirt, th e outer structural parts of the hydraulic release tool, and FFF cone). As soon as the bit was on board, we spent the rest of the day assembling the reentry system in the center of the moonpool beneath th e rig floor.  

We completed assembling the free-fall reentry system at $0115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 February and then started lowering the RCB drilling assembl y through the middle of the reentry system to the seafloor. After starting Hole U1532G at $0920\,\mathrm{h}$ and penetrating to $51.9~\mathrm{m}$ , we droppe d the reentry system at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 February. We continued drillin g without coring to $161.5\;\mathrm{m}$ but had to pause operations from 1730 t o $1815\,\mathrm{h}$ because of approaching ice. After spending ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{h}$ clearing ic e from the wireline seal (blowout preventer) in the top drive, we resumed drilling. When the bit reached $171.2\;\mathrm{m}$ at $1945\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 February, approaching ice forced us to pause operations again and rais e the bit to $54~\mathrm{m}$ .  

At $0345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 February, we had to pull completely out of Hol e U1532G. At $0700~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 February, we adjusted the bit depth fo r reentry, deployed the subsea camera system, and reentered Hol e U1532G at $1005~\mathrm{h}$ . We recovered the camera system and starte d lowering the drill string. When the bit reached $201.5\mathrm{~m~}$ at $1345~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , we had to raise the bit to $45.5~\mathrm{m}$ because of approaching ice. Afte r the rig floor was cleared to resume operations at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 February, we lowered the bit to the bottom of the hole and resume d drilling without coring.  

At $0345\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 15 February, we reached the depth where w e wanted to start coring $(372.3\ \mathrm{m})$ . After clearing ice from the wireline seal in the top drive and sinker bars, we recovered the RCB cor e barrel with the attached center bit and started RCB coring. Onc e Core 3R arrived on deck, approaching ice forced us to pause operations at $1100\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . We resumed coring at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ . After Core 14 R $(487.5\mathrm{--}497.1\;\mathrm{m})$ ) arrived on the rig floor at $1315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 February, approaching ice forced us to stop coring. We raised the bit to $65~\mathrm{m}$ and waited for the ice to clear the area. We resumed operations a t $1845~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 February, lowering the bit from 65.0 to $467.5~\mathrm{m}$ an d resuming RCB coring at $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 February. We then had nearl y $40~\mathrm{{h}}$ of uninterrupted coring. Cores 15R through 34R penetrate d from 497.1 to $688.6\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $170.51\:\mathrm{m}\:(89\%)$ .  

After Core 34R arrived at $1445\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 February, we had to sto p coring because of approaching ice. At $1915\ \mathrm{h},$ , we were able to resume coring, and Cores 35R through 37R penetrated another 28. 7 $\mathrm{m\,(688.6-717.3\,m;24.73\,m}$ recovered; $86\%$ ). As soon as we finishe d cutting Core 37R at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 February, we had to raise the bit t o $54.5~\mathrm{m}$ because of approaching ice. We were finally able to retriev e Core 37R at $_{0420\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ .  

At ${\sim}0655\mathrm{~h~}$ on 20 February, we were cleared to resume corin g and started lowering the bit down the hole. After we installed th e top drive, the bit encountered some resistance at $567.5\ \mathrm{m},$ and w e rotated and circulated to $709.2\textrm{m}$ . At that depth, we had to drop  a center bit to redrill the final $\mathord{\sim}8\;\mathrm{m}$ to the bottom of the hole $(709.2-$ $717.3\:\mathrm{m}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ). After circulating 25 bbl of mud to clean the cuttings out o f the hole, approaching ice forced us to raise the bit to $64.5\;\mathrm{m}$ at 131 5 h. We continued waiting on ice to clear the area until $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 1 February, when approaching ice forced us to pull the bit out of Hol e U1532G so that we could offset the ship. At $0630\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , we deployed th e camera system in anticipation of being able to reenter Hol e U1532G. After adjusting the bit depth for reentry at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ , we surveyed the seafloor around Hole U1532G and began attempts to reenter the hole. The FFF of the reentry system (with ${\sim}14~\mathrm{m}$ of casin g below) was not visible; it had settled substantially into the seafloor.  

After numerous attempts, we were finally able to reenter at $1225\,\mathrm{h}$ . After we recovered the camera system, we started lowering the bi t to the bottom of the hole. At $1615\,\mathrm{h}$ , the bit encountered some resistance at $620.5\;\mathrm{m}$ , so we installed the top drive so that we could circulate and rotate, dropped a core barrel, and reamed to the botto m of the hole $(717.3\;\mathrm{m})$ ). We recovered the core barrel (Core 38G; 0.4 7 m recovered) at $2125\,\mathrm{~h~}$ and resumed RCB coring. Cores 39 R through 45R then penetrated from 717.3 to $779.9\mathrm{~m~}$ . Approachin g ice forced us to stop cutting Core 45R after penetrating only $5.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . At $1315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 February, we raised the bit to $754.5~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered Core 45R. We resumed operations at $1615\,\mathrm{h},$ lowered the bit t o the bottom of the hole, and started coring at $1700~\mathrm{h}$ . After Core s 46R through 47R $(779.9\mathrm{-}787.41\;\mathrm{m})$ ) were recovered, we paused operations again at $2245~\mathrm{h}$ because of approaching ice and raised th e bit to $64.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . We continued waiting on the ice to clear the area until $0545~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 February, when the approaching ice forced us to pull the bit out of the hole. At $0630\,\mathrm{h},$ we decided to stop further operations in Hole U1532G and started to recover the drill string. The bi t arrived on the rig floor at $1335\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the rig floor was secured fo r transit at $1455\,\mathrm{h}$ . Before we could get under way, we had to maneuver the ship away from the ice to raise the thrusters. We started ou r transit to Site U1533 at $1618\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Overall, Hole U1532G was drilled without coring from the seafloor to $372.3\;\mathrm{m}$ and then cored with the RCB system from 372.3 t o $794.0\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , recovering $366.41\;\mathrm{m}\;(87\%)$ .  

# Site U1533  

We conducted coring operations in 4 holes at Site U1533 (Proposed Site ASRE-09A; Table T1). Given the frequent interruption s caused by icebergs at the previous site, we decided to deploy a freefall reentry system as early as possible after starting to core. AP C coring in Hole U1533A penetrated from the seafloor to $28.5~\mathrm{m}$ an d recovered $29.54\;\mathrm{m}\;(104\%)$ , but approaching ice forced us to pull ou t of the hole before deploying the reentry system. Hole U1533B wa s drilled without coring to $25.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , after which we cored to a total depth of $382.6\;\mathrm{m}$ with the APC, HLAPC, XCB, and RCB systems fo r overall recovery of $70\%$ . Shortly after beginning APC coring in Hol e U1533B, we deployed a free-fall reentry system with $24.35\;\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing that allowed us to reenter the hole two times after w e were driven off by approaching ice. The first time the ice forced u s to pull out of Hole U1533B, we used the time to conduct shallowpenetration APC coring in Holes U1533C and U1533D before returning to Hole U1533B. Hole U1533C consisted of a single mudlin e core that recovered $7.74\mathrm{~m},$ , but increased ship heave forced us t o stop drilling operations. After the seas subsided, we conducted AP C coring in Hole U1533D from the seafloor to $40.0~\mathrm{m}$ and recovere d $40.01\:\mathrm{m}\:(100\%)$ .  

We spent a total of 11.68 days at Site U1533. Drifting iceberg s caused multiple interruptions that resulted in nearly half of thi s time (5.22 days) being spent waiting for ice to clear the area or conducting operations not originally planned (pipe trips, reentries, o r repeated drilled intervals). The frequency of interruptions cause d by drifting icebergs and significant variations in their speed and direction proved problematic. We had to stop any further expeditio n drilling operations at $0315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 March 2019 to return to Chilea n waters to evacuate an injured crew member.  

# Hole U1533A  

After completing operations at Site U1532, we started our transit to Site U1533 at $1618\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 February. After the $31\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transi t $(4.4\,\mathrm{h};7.1\,\mathrm{nmi}/\mathrm{h})$ ), we arrived at Site U1533 and switched to dynami c positioning at $2109\,\mathrm{h}$ . Once at the site, we conducted routine servicing of the drill line (slip and cut), prepared the rig floor and moonpool for assembling a reentry system, and then assembled the freefall reentry system (FFF, mud skirt, 2 joints of $10\%$ inch casing). A t $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 February, the reentry system was completed and centered in the moonpool. We attached an APC bit to the BHA an d lowered it through the reentry system. We used an APC polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit, which has a smaller outsid e diameter $9\%$ inches) than our normal APC bits so that it can pas s through the $10\%$ inch casing used in the reentry system. While lowering the bit to the seafloor, we had to stop for $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ $\mathrm{~h~}(0800{-}1000\,\mathrm{h})$ t o repair a line in the rig floor compressed air system. After the bit arrived at ${\sim}90\;\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor at $1500\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , we had to pause operations because of approaching ice. At $1715\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , we installed the to p drive and adjusted the bit to start coring. Unfortunately, we had t o stop operations again at $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ because of approaching ice.  

After ice cleared the area at $0515\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 February, we adjuste d the bit depth and started APC coring in Hole U1533A at $0640~\mathrm{h}$ . Cores 1H through 3H penetrated to $28.5~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $29.54\mathrm{~m~}$ $(104\%)$ . Ice approached, and we had to pull out of Hole U1533A a t $1045\,\mathrm{h}$ before being able to deploy the reentry system.  

# Hole U1533B (first visit)  

We resumed operations at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 February. We offset th e ship ${\sim}1620\mathrm{~m~}$ to the west (264°) of Hole U1533A because the ic e conditions would allow us to start operations sooner at this location, which is along the range of locations on the seismic profile approved for drilling at this site. Hole U1533B was started at $1355\ \mathrm{h},$ and we drilled without coring to $25.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . APC Cores 2H through 7 H then penetrated to $82.5~\mathrm{m}$ . While retrieving Core 4H, we deploye d the free-fall reentry system with $24.35\;\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing.  

After Core 7H arrived at the rig floor at $0050\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 February, approaching ice caused us to pause operations and raise the bit t o $50.4~\mathrm{m}$ . We resumed operations at $0230~\mathrm{h},$ and Cores 8H throug h 12H penetrated to $130.0\ \mathrm{m}$ . After recovering Core $12\mathrm{H}$ , approaching ice forced us to pause operations again at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the bit wa s raised to $50.6~\mathrm{m}$ . At $1415\,\mathrm{h},$ we lowered the bit to the bottom of th e hole and resumed APC coring. Cores 13H through 18H penetrate d to $187.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ before we had to pause operations again $2330~\mathrm{h}$ . W e raised the bit to $50.6~\mathrm{m}$ to wait for the ice to clear the area.  

At $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 February, we had to pull completely out of Hol e U1533B because of approaching ice. Because the ice encroachmen t would not allow the timely reentry of Hole U1533B, we decided t o make use of this time to take a few surficial APC cores.  

# Holes U1533C and U1533D  

We offset the ship to a more ice-free portion of the seismic profile and adjusted the bit for a mudline core. As we prepared to shoo t Core 379-U1533C-1H at $0805~\mathrm{h},$ , significant ship heave caused th e core to fire early. However, we recovered what appeared to be  a good, $7.7\,\textrm{m}$ long mudline core. Before we could take any mor e cores, increasing ship heave forced us to stop operations at $0900~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 February. We raised the bit ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ above the seafloor an d waited until $0645\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 February for the seas to subside enough t o resume coring operations. Our preference was to reenter Hol e U1533B and continue to deepen it, but this required calmer seas because we did not want to risk the bit heaving down on the reentr y funnel and damaging our ability to reenter. So, we offset the ship 1 5 m to the east of Hole U1533C and started APC coring from the seafloor in Hole U1533D. APC Cores U1533D-1H through 5H penetrated to $40\,\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $40.01\:\mathrm{m}\:(100\%)$ . Because this was dee p enough to provide overlap with the shallowest Hole U1533B core s and the swell had decreased enough to allow deeper drilling, we terminated Hole U1533D at $1545\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 February.  

# Hole U1533B (second visit)  

We moved back to Hole U1533B, deployed the camera system , and reentered at $1838\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 February. The top of the reentry con e was observed to be roughly level with the seafloor but clear on all sides from a depression made by the $96~\mathrm{inch^{2}}$ mud skirt. We recovered the camera system and lowered the bit toward the bottom o f the hole. The bit encountered some resistance at $160\ \mathrm{m}$ , so we installed the top drive and rotated/circulated the remaining $27\textrm{m}$ t o the bottom of the hole $(187.0\;\mathrm{m})$ . We resumed coring at $2215\,\mathrm{h},$ an d Cores 19F and 20F penetrated to $196.4\;\mathrm{m}$ . After Core 20F arrived o n the rig floor at $0055\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 March, we had to stop coring because o f approaching ice. At $0130\ \mathrm{h},$ we raised the bit to $165.6\ \mathrm{m},$ , remove d the top drive, and continued raising the bit to $50.6\;\mathrm{m}$ . At $0600\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , w e resumed operations, lowered the bit to the bottom of the hole, an d started coring again. After two HLAPC cores (21F and 22F; 196.4– $205.8\ \mathrm{m})$ ), we decided to switch to XCB coring. Unfortunately, w e had to stop operations at $1115~\mathrm{h}$ because of approaching ice. W e raised the bit to $50.6~\mathrm{m}$ and waited until $1515~\mathrm{h}$ to resume operations. We lowered the bit to the bottom of the hole and drilled Core s 23X through 28X from 205.8 to $262.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . After Core 28X arrived o n the rig floor, we had to stop operations at $0915~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 March because of approaching ice. We raised the bit to $50.6\mathrm{~m~}$ and waite d until $1315\ \mathrm{h}$ to resume operations. While lowering the bit to th e bottom of the hole, it encountered hard fill at $232.6\;\mathrm{m}$ . We installe d the top drive, deployed an XCB core barrel with a center bit, an d drilled to $262.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . After recovering the center bit, we resumed coring at $1645\,\mathrm{h},$ , and Cores 29X through 31X penetrated to $283.9\,\mathrm{m}$ . A t $2145\,\mathrm{h},$ , we had to stop coring again because of approaching ice. Instead of waiting for the ice to leave the area to resume XCB coring, we decided to make use of this time to retrieve the drill string an d switch to RCB coring. We pulled the bit out of Hole U1533B at 230 3 h and retrieved the drill string.  

The APC/XCB bit arrived on the rig floor at $0820\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 March . Core 31X was recovered with the drill string. We prepared the RC B BHA and lowered it the seafloor. We deployed the camera system t o prepare for reentering Hole U1533B. During the deployment of th e camera system, we attached the APCT-3 to the camera system t o measure the seawater temperature from the surface to just abov e the seafloor. Once the camera system reached the bit, we adjuste d the bit depth to reenter Hole U1533B, but approaching ice forced u s to raise the bit to $70\,\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor at $2045\,\mathrm{h}$ . We were cleare d to resume operations at $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ and reentered Hole U1533B at 230 5 h. We recovered the camera system and lowered the bit into Hol e U1533B. After the camera system was on board, we installed the to p drive and circulated and rotated to the bottom of the hole $(283.9\;\mathrm{m})$ . Approaching ice prevented us from coring, causing a delay fro m 0315 to $0630~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 March. Unfortunately, ice kept converging o n our location, so we had to raise the bit to $66~\mathrm{m}$ . At $1215\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{{r}}}$ , we resumed operations and lowered the bit toward the bottom of th e hole. The bit encountered resistance at $257.6\ \mathrm{m},$ , and we had to drill to the bottom of the hole. At $1345~\mathrm{h},$ we started RCB coring fro m $283.9\;\mathrm{m}$ . Cores 32R through 35R then penetrated to $316.0\;\mathrm{m}$ but recovered only $0.07\mathrm{~m~}(0.2\%)$ . At $2245\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , we raised the bit to $65.5~\mathrm{m}$ because of approaching ice.  

After ice cleared the area at $0145\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 March, we lowered th e bit from $65.6~\mathrm{m}$ down the hole. The bit encountered fill at $267.6\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , so we installed the top drive and circulated/rotated the rest of th e way down. We resumed RCB coring from $316.0~\mathrm{m}$ at $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ . Core s 36R through 38R then penetrated to $341.7~\mathrm{m}$ before we had to sto p coring again at $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ because of approaching ice. We raised the bi t to $65.5\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , reinstalled the top drive, and recovered Core 38R at 141 5 h. At $1845\mathrm{h}$ , we were able to resume operations, so we lowered th e bit down the hole, installed the top drive when the bit was at 324. 6 m, and circulated/rotated to the bottom of the hole $(341.7~\mathrm{m})$ ). W e then cut Cores 39R and 40R to $360.9\mathrm{~m~}$ . Before we could recove r Core 40R, approaching ice forced us to pause operations again a t $2315\,\mathrm{h}$ . We waited for the ice to clear with the bit near the bottom o f the hole. We did not install the core line to retrieve Core 40R because it would increase the time required to pull out of the hole i f the ice kept approaching. At $0315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 March, we were finally abl e to recover Core 40R and resume coring. Cores 41R through 43 R penetrated from 360.9 to $382.6\;\mathrm{m}$ . At $0930\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , approaching ice agai n forced us to raise the bit to $65.6~\mathrm{m}$ . The ice kept approaching, an d we had to pull the bit completely out of Hole U1533B at $1115~\mathrm{h}$ . With the bit $106~\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor, we installed the top drive, installed the core line, and recovered Core 43R at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ . We the n deployed the camera system at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ so that we would be ready t o reenter Hole U1533B as soon as the ice would allow. While waitin g for the ice to move away, we conducted a camera survey of the seafloor from 1845 to $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

We continued to wait with the bit $50~\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor fo r the ice to clear the area until $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 March. We then reentere d Hole U1533B at $0155\;\mathrm{h},$ started to retrieve the camera system, an d began lowering the bit into the hole. When the bit reached $324.6~\mathrm{m}$ at $0315\ \mathrm{h},$ we had to stop any further operations so that we coul d return to Chilean waters to evacuate an injured crew member. Afte r the camera system was on board at $0430\ \mathrm{h},$ , we recovered the dril l string. The rig floor was secured for transit at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Transit to Punta Arenas  

We began the $\mathord{\sim}1358$ nmi transit to a point south of Cape Hor n for the medical evacuation at $1448\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 7 March. Poor visibilit y combined with ice in the area initially limited our speed to ${\sim}6{-}7$ $\mathrm{nmi/h}$ through the morning of 8 March. After that, improved visibility and good weather and seas allowed us to proceed much faste r with an overall average speed of $11.5\;\mathrm{nmi/h}$ for the ${\sim}1358\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit.  

As the transit progressed, the evacuation location changed t o Puerto Williams, Chile. We reached the Cape Horn pilot station a t $1400~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 March, two pilots boarded at $1503~\mathrm{h},$ and we proceeded to Puerto Williams. At $0006~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 March, we arrived i n Puerto Williams and anchored. Chilean officials (agent, immigration, port authority, police, and translator) boarded at $0020~\mathrm{h}$ an d departed at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ . Later that morning, the helicopter for the medical evacuation landed on the ship at $0816\,\mathrm{h}$ and departed at $0838~\mathrm{h}$ with the injured crew member. At $1009\,\mathrm{h},$ we departed Puerto Williams and spent the rest of the day in transit to Punta Arenas.  

We arrived at the Mardones Dock in Punta Arenas at $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 14 March and went through immigration and customs. From 15 t o 19 March, we conducted port call activities that included preparin g shipments for offloading, loading and distributing incoming shipments, preparing the labs for the next expedition, and completin g all shipboard reports. Expedition 379 officially ended at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 20 March.  

# Outreach  

Expedition 379 had two Education and Outreach officers o n board the ship. One was a children's author and illustrator, an informal  educator,  and  the  creator  of  a  weekly  science  comic, #AntarcticLog. The other was a geologist as well as a photographer, writer and filmmaker who tells expedition science stories in the media.  

# Live broadcasts  

We worked precruise to book more than 50 live broadcasts wit h schools, universities, and museums all over the world including th e Smithsonian Museum of Natural History and the Natural Histor y Museum of London. Because of internet connectivity issues, mos t of these had to be canceled and were moved to future expeditions. We managed to conduct five live events when we had connectivity: fifth and sixth graders in New Jersey (USA), the University of Perpignan in France with the French media present, and one to IOD P Germany’s live outreach event for 600 school children, reaching approximately 680 people in total.  

# Expedition activities  

The expedition was continually documented by the two outreach officers using film, photo, writing, and interviews. A total o f 26 blogs were posted on the JOIDES Resolution website, includin g updates from the scientists, technicians, and outreach officers. I n addition, four blogs by scientist Claus-Dieter Hillenbrand were edited and photos were provided for the British Antarctic Survey. Biweekly comics for #AntarcticLog were produced leading up to an d during the expedition; these were distributed through social medi a and blogs and will be published in an education and outreach booklet for IODP. A book, Arcticology/Antarcticology, for middle graders, was researched and drafted. A trailer video was produced fo r the expedition and disseminated through social media and blogs. Filming and interviews were completed for a follow-up film abou t IODP Expedition 379 as well as for a short film commissioned b y BBC Global News about the expedition. Filming was completed fo r a Brazilian IODP (CAPES) promotional video featuring scientis t Marcelo Mota.  

# Media  

We filmed video featuring Co-Chief Scientist Karsten Gohl fo r the German science TV show Nano on 3sat, broadcast on 20 February 2019. We also filmed media for French TV that will be broadcas t at later date. Photos, interviews, and information were provided fo r two German news articles and two French news articles. Three U S news articles came from press releases published. BBC Earth Instagram published a series of photos from the expedition with an explanation of what we were doing. The post reached an audience o f over 2.1 million people and was liked by over 40,000 people. Th e BBC World Service radio interviewed Co-Chief Scientist Julia Wellner.  

# Social media  

Daily postings were made on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitte r beginning prior to the cruise, just after the new year. These posting s featured comics, including translations of one comic into nine different languages; photographs; videos; and information posting s about activities aboard. Social media statistics include 53 Faceboo k posts with 168,143 people reached and 205 new followers; 8 3 Tweets with 276,000 impressions and 133 new followers; and 46 Instagram posts with 3,764 total likes.
