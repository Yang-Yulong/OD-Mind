# Abstract  

Elucidating the geologic history of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is essential for understandin g glacial instability thresholds, identified as major climate system tipping points, and how the cryosphere will respond to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. To address current knowledg e gaps in the evolution and variability of the GrIS and its role in Earth's climate system, Internationa l Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 400 obtained sedimentary records from Site s U1603–U1608 across the northwest Greenland margin into Baffin Bay where thick Cenozoi c sedimentary successions can be directly linked to the evolution of the northern GrIS (NGrIS). Th e strategy of drilling along this transect was to retrieve a composite stratigraphic succession representing the late Cenozoic era from the Oligocene/early Miocene to Holocene.  

The proposed sites targeted high–accumulation rate deposits associated with contourite drift s and potential interglacial deposits within a trough mouth fan system densely covered by seismi c data. The principal objectives were to (1) test if the NGrIS underwent near-complete deglaciation s in the Pleistocene and assess the ice sheet’s response to changes in orbital cyclicities through th e mid-Pleistocene transition; (2) ascertain the timing of the NGrIS expansion and examine  a hypothesized linkage between marine heat transport through Baffin Bay and high Arctic warmt h during the Pliocene; and (3) provide new understandings of climate-ecosystem conditions i n Greenland during the geologic periods with increased atmospheric $C O_{2}$ compared to preindustrial values, encompassing the last 30 My. The deep time objective was attained by coring at Sit e U1607 on the inner shelf to 978 meters below seafloor, capturing a succession of mainly Miocen e and Oligocene age. The six sites drilled during Expedition 400 resulted in $2299\mathrm{~m~}$ of recovere d core material, and wireline downhole logging was completed at Sites U1603, U1604, U1607, an d U1608. This unique archive will provide the basis for understanding the full range of forcings an d feedbacks—oceanic, atmospheric, orbital, and tectonic—that influence the GrIS over a range o f timescales, as well as conditions prevailing at the time of glacial inception and deglacial to interglacial periods. We anticipate that the shipboard data and further analytical work on Expeditio n 400 material can constrain predictive models addressing the GrIS response to global warming an d its impending effects on global sea levels.  

# Plain language summary  

Sea level consequences of anthropogenic climate forcing hinge on how the polar ice sheet s respond to global warming. If fully melted, the Greenland Ice Sheet has the potential to raise se a level by ${>}7$ meters, yet we know very little about its long-term responses to past climate warmin g or its role in Earth’s climate system. Expedition 400 seeks to address current knowledge gaps in th e evolution and variability of the northern Greenland Ice Sheet by recovering sedimentary archive s of warm and cold periods going millions of years back in time. This includes periods when th e greenhouse gas content of the atmosphere was higher than it is today. By drilling at six sites to 97 8 meters below seafloor along a transect crossing the northwest Greenland margin into Baffin Bay, we obtained a total of 2299 meters of sediment. This extensive and unique sediment archive will b e valuable for understanding the geologic history of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its response to pas t warming going back 30 million years before present. The sediment cores record climate conditions before Greenland became glaciated and indicate when the Greenland Ice Sheet first began t o expand into the marine environment. We also see glacial and interglacial cycles when the ice shee t grew to its maximum position at the shelf edge and retreated toward land, possibly melting farthe r back than what is known from previous records.  

# 1. Introduction  

The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) holds a large amount of freshwater, equivalent to ${\sim}7.4~\mathrm{m}$ of globa l sea level (Bamber et al., 2013). Recent studies have highlighted the sensitivity of the GrIS t o climate warming and the potential impact its meltwaters would have on sea level rise and th e Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (Alley et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2010; Hansen et al., 2016). With the prospect of irreversible ice sheet retreat as one of the major tipping points, documentin g the full range of forcings and feedbacks—oceanic, atmospheric, orbital, and tectonic—that influence the GrIS over a range of timescales is crucial for making robust predictions of future climat e and sea level change (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] Sixth Assessmen t Report; https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6). To this end, high-resolution sedimentar y archives proximal to Greenland that capture glacial discharges of meltwater and sediments unde r different ice sheet configurations as well as biogenic components reflecting marine and terrestria l climate conditions are needed. The objectives of Expedition 400 directly address the critica l questions posed in the Climate and Ocean Change theme of the International Ocean Discover y Program (IODP) science plan: “How do ice sheets and sea level respond to a warming climate? ” and “How does Earth’s climate system respond to elevated levels of atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ?”  

The response of the GrIS to extreme interglacial warmth is a highly relevant and debated topi c although it is poorly constrained by data. During the last interglacial period, Marine Isotope Stag e (MIS) 5e, global sea level was likely in the range of $6{-}9\;\mathrm{m}$ higher than present (Dutton and Lambeck, 2012), of which the GrIS may have contributed between $10\%$ and $40\%$ (Neem Communit y Members, 2013; Dutton et al., 2015). During MIS 11c, described as a super-interglacial (Loutre, 2003; Melles et al., 2012), global sea levels $6{-}13\;\mathrm{m}$ higher than today have been estimated (Dutto n et al., 2015). Several studies associate MIS 11c with a significant or near-complete loss of the GrI S (Willerslev et al., 2007; de Vernal and Hillaire-Marcel, 2008; Reyes et al., 2014; Christ et al., 2023). The MIS 11c ice sheet loss apparently occurred despite more moderate summer temperature s compared to MIS 5e (Cluett and Thomas, 2021). A compelling result by Schaefer et al. (2016), based on cosmogenic nuclides in subice bedrock, suggests that central Greenland became deglaciated during one or more periods over the last 2.5 My. This concept raises critical questions: (1) What forcings drove near-complete melting of the northern GrIS (NGrIS) during the Pleistocene? (2) How did the ice sheet reconfigure to a state of “normal” glacial–interglacial conditions ? To answer these questions and test the temporal scenarios for ice sheet instabilities and extende d deglaciation through the Pleistocene requires access to semicontinuous records from the continental margins around Greenland (Bierman et al., 2016).  

The mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT) signifies a profound shift in glacial–interglacial cycles fro m 41 to $100~\mathrm{ky}$ periodicities (Hodell and Channell, 2016). Although the 41 ky cycles are strongl y linked to orbital forcing, the insolation changes associated with 100 ky cycles are weak and requir e a persistent amplification mechanism (Yin and Berger, 2010). Explanations for the MPT hav e focused on various aspects of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reservoir exchanges between ice, ocean, and atmospher e (Raymo et al., 1996; Paillard, 1998; Ruddiman, 2006; Yin and Berger, 2010; Rial et al., 2013; Lear e t al., 2016) and changes in ice sheet dynamics controlled by bedrock/regolith cover of Norther n Hemisphere terrains (Clark and Pollard, 1998; Clark et al., 2006; Abe-Ouchi et al., 2013; Willeit e t al., 2019). All hypotheses implicate the GrIS, directly or indirectly, but its dynamic behavior acros s the MPT is scarcely known. A potential linkage between global climate cycles and GrIS dynamic s is highlighted by a recent study denoting a major change in northwest GrIS configuration throug h the MPT (Knutz et al., 2019).  

The current understanding of the Cenozoic evolution of the GrIS has been developed largely fro m North Atlantic deep-sea records. In northeast Greenland, marine-based glaciers appear to hav e been active since the Miocene $(\sim\!18\,\mathrm{Ma})$ (Thiede et al., 2011), but smaller outlets may have existe d as early as the late Eocene (Eldrett et al., 2007; St. John, 2008; Tripati et al., 2008). Deep drilling an d seismic evidence indicate that glacially influenced sedimentation on the central–southern Eas t Greenland margin began during the late Miocene $(\sim\!7\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ (Larsen et al., 1994; Bierman et al., 2016; Pérez et al., 2018). Full-scale glaciation of Greenland is generally considered to be timed wit h intensification of the Northern Hemisphere glaciations interpreted from elevated ice rafting in th e North Atlantic during the late Pliocene–Pleistocene $3.3{-}2.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Shackleton et al., 1984; Janse n et al., 2000; St. John and Krissek, 2002). This ice sheet growth phase is possibly linked with a westward expansion of the GrIS into Baffin Bay during the Pliocene (Nielsen and Kuijpers, 2013; Knut z et al., 2019; Aubry et al., 2021). However, the chronology is poorly constrained and lacks cor e stratigraphic information from the West Greenland margin.  

A better knowledge of the inception of the GrIS and its sectorized expansion during the lat e Cenozoic is needed to support sensitivity studies and climate models (DeConto et al., 2008). I n particular, there is a pressing need for understanding the GrIS behavior during the warm climate s with elevated ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ of the Paleocene and Neogene. The Pliocene $(5.3{-}2.6\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is the most recen t period when atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentrations were similar to the modern levels of ${\sim}400$ ppm. This geologic time period thus functions as a past analog interval for the ongoing and futur e response of the ice sheet under warming conditions. Notably, the mid-Pliocene warm period $\left(3.3-\right.$ $3.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) has been a focal point for paleoclimate reconstruction and modeling (Haywood et al., 2010; Dowsett et al., 2013). To study analogs for future global warming scenarios (e.g., $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ projections ${>}600$ ppm beyond 2050), it is necessary to access records going further back in time. Ke y stratigraphic intervals for gaining knowledge on elevated $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ climate regimes include the middl e Miocene $(16{-}15\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and most of the Oligocene (34–27 Ma) (Zhang et al., 2013; O’Brien et al., 2020; Guillermic et al., 2022). These pre-Quaternary intervals likely exist below the northwes t Greenland margin (Knutz et al., 2015) but have yet to be explored by deep drilling.  

The vulnerability of the GrIS to global climate change is a major concern, but it also highlights  a knowledge gap that limits our ability to confidently project future cryospheric responses, including contributions to sea level rise (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2009; Briner et al., 2017). Cenozoic climat e experienced significant changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, notably linked t o $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ (Pearson and Palmer, 2000; Zachos et al., 2008; Pagani, 2014). Model studies suggest tha t even the modest atmospheric $C O_{2}$ changes $(280{-}400~\mathrm{ppm})$ observed during the late Cenozoi c exert a primary control on GrIS growth across the Pliocene–Pleistocene transition (Lunt et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2018). Other factors controlling ice sheet dynamics include changes in ocea n currents (Nielsen et al., 2011; Knutz et al., 2015; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2017), tectonic base-leve l changes (Solgaard et al., 2013), and variations in geothermal heat flux (Fahnestock et al., 2001; Rogozhina et al., 2016), but these boundary conditions are poorly constrained by data and are no t easily addressed by climate models. For the Oligocene and Miocene time periods, the linkag e between global ice volume, surface temperatures, and atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ is enigmatic. The expansion and dynamic variability of ice sheets in Antarctica during periods of global warming an d moderate $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels imply a strong nonlinear behavior to climate forcing, with implications fo r ice sheet tipping points (Foster et al., 2012; Golledge et al., 2017; O’Brien et al., 2020; DeConto e t al., 2021). The complex linkages or possible decoupling between $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ and global ice volum e (Raymo et al., 1996; Tripati et al., 2009) underscore the importance of evaluating potential forcing s in the earth system. Greenland is surrounded by narrow gateways that over millions of years ma y have changed configuration, potentially modulating ocean heat fluxes between the Arctic an d North Atlantic regions (Thiede and Myhre, 1996). Unraveling the GrIS response to past globa l warming events will need to consider regional effects such as those related to ocean gateways, topography, and ecosystems (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2017; Hodson et al., 2010).  

With a clear goal of addressing the multiple questions and hypotheses that concern the long-ter m evolution and stability of the NGrIS, Expedition 400 will obtain a composite sedimentary archiv e covering the last 25–30 My. The strategy was to drill seven sites along a transect across th e northwest Greenland margin from the deep basin of Baffin Bay to the inner continental shel f (Figures F1, F2, F3). The transect is positioned between two major trough mouth fan (TMF ) systems, the Melville Bugt and the Upernavik TMFs, which are the product of erosion and transport of sediments to the shelf edge by paleo–ice streams. The proposed sites primarily core high– accumulation rate deposits that include contourite, hemipelagic, and glacial-marine sediments o f Quaternary, Pliocene, and Miocene–Oligocene age (Figure F4). With the data extracted fro m composite archives obtained in close vicinity to major glacial outlets, we aim to determine maximum and minimum NGrIS configurations throughout the middle to late Cenozoic, from shel f edge glaciation to hypothesized complete ice loss, such as during Pleistocene super-interglacials.

# 2. Background  

# 2.1. Baffin Bay hydrology  

Baffin Bay is a semienclosed basin with predominantly cyclonic ocean circulation and a pronounced east–west hydrographic gradient (Figures F1, F2). The Baffin Island Current transport s cold, low salinity Arctic waters along the Canadian margin and exits through western Davis Strait. In contrast, the West Greenland Current carries warmer $(3^{\circ}{-}5^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ waters derived from both th e North Atlantic Irminger Current and the East Greenland Current. The West Greenland Curren t travels northward over the West Greenland shelf regions at water depths of 100–500 meters belo w sea level (mbsl) (Bourke et al., 1989; Hamilton and Wu, 2013). Observations of the deep to intermediate circulation of Baffin Bay and hydrographic modeling indicate a southward counter current along the West Greenland slope from $68^{\circ}$ to $72^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ at depths of 1000–1500 mbsl (Tang et al., 2004). Deepwater formation is possibly taking place in northern Baffin Bay, associated with brin e formation during sea ice formation in the North Water Polynya, south of the Nares Strait (Yao an d Tang, 2003). The rates and processes of water mass conversion in this area are not well understoo d (Bourke et al., 1989), but there is growing understanding of the role of the North Water Polyny a and its influence on the interactions of northern and southern sourced water masses in the deepwater formation in Baffin Bay (Bâcle et al., 2002; Rysgaard et al., 2020).  

# 2.2. Greenland Ice Sheet dynamics  

The northwest Greenland shelf region was glaciated on multiple occasions, resulting in prominen t TMFs that are the sedimentary expression of former glacial outlets of the NGrIS (Figure F3). Geophysical data and shallow core studies demonstrate the presence of fast-flowing ice streams tha t reached the outer shelf during the late Pleistocene (Ó Cofaigh et al., 2013; Dowdeswell et al., 2014; Slabon et al., 2016; Newton et al., 2017). The last glacial retreat from outer shelf grounding positions to fjord outlets in northwest Greenland probably occurred in discrete steps controlled b y reverse bed gradients associated with shelf overdeepening (Patton et al., 2016; Newton et al., 2017 ) and enhanced marine ablation linked to the West Greenland Current (Jennings et al., 2017). Confluent Laurentide, Innuitian, and Greenland Ice Sheets blocked the Arctic–Atlantic gateways suc h as Parry Channel and Nares Strait during the Last Glacial Maximum, eliminating the inflow o f Arctic waters into northern Baffin Bay and resulting in a circulation and sea ice regime much different from the modern one (Jennings et al., 2019; Jackson et al., 2021). Arctic–Atlantic gatewa y closures likely occurred during other glacial periods.  

Ice sheet response to major climate transitions, such as the Pleistocene terminations, is poorl y known. A recent study invokes a slow interglacial response to climate forcing, suggesting that th e GrIS is in disequilibrium with global warming (Yang et al., 2022). Conversely, during glacia l maxima ice shelves may have developed over Baffin Bay, buttressing the ice flow and possibl y stabilizing the central ice domes in Greenland (Hulbe et al., 2004; Jennings et al., 2018; Couette e t al., 2022). Thinning and breakup of stabilizing ice shelves can be triggered by ocean forcing at th e grounding line amplified by drainage of surface meltwater to the bed (Holland et al., 2008; Straneo et al., 2012; Scambos et al., 2017; Catania et al., 2020; Jennings et al., 2022). Depending o n physiographic factors such as bathymetry and lateral constraints, ice retreat can be catastrophic o r episodic (Alley et al., 2007, 2015; Pollard et al., 2015; Scambos et al., 2017; Hogan et al., 2020). It i s important to understand the complex forcings and conditions that initiate retreat and govern th e rate of retreat of a previously stable marine-terminating ice sheet to better understand the impact s of ice sheet retreat on sea level, ocean circulation, nutrients, and ecosystems (Catania et al., 2020). Reconstructions of paleo–ice sheet behavior and mass balance change broaden the scope of ou r understanding of the potential outcomes of continued climate warming on the GrIS.  

A better understanding of the boundary conditions and forcings determining long-term ice shee t evolution requires information only attainable by offshore drilling. However, long sedimentar y records specifically illuminating NGrIS history are lacking. Previous drilled sites in the Nort h Atlantic recovered sediment shed from elevated terrains in east Greenland (Thiede et al., 2011; Reyes et al., 2014) influenced by semipermanent alpine glaciers since the late Miocene (Bierman e t al., 2016). The only deeply cored site in Baffin Bay (Site 645) was drilled during the early phase o f the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), and its contribution to understanding GrIS history is limite d because of its location on the Canadian margin, poor recovery, and age uncertainties (Baldauf e t al., 1989). In 2012, shallow coring was carried out in northeast Baffin Bay targeting Mesozoic rif t deposits in exhumed sedimentary basins north of the Melville Bugt trough (Expedition 344S; Acton and the Expedition 344S Scientists, 2012). However, two sites, U0100 and U0110, penetrated a $124\;\mathrm{m}$ thick interval of overcompacted, muddy diamicton. Cosmogenic nuclides and othe r proxy data extracted from these proximal glacigenic sediments suggest that by the early Pleistocene, a persistent yet dynamic ice sheet existed in northwest Greenland (Christ et al., 2023).  

The sensitivity of the GrIS to ocean warming (Holland et al., 2008; Yin et al., 2011) emphasizes th e need for high-resolution records near the major glacial outlets of eastern Baffin Bay. Importan t advances in drilling techniques, dating methodologies, and proxy approaches make new drillin g key for advancing understanding of past GrIS dynamics and ice-ocean-climate interactions, whic h so far have only been addressed by seabed mapping, shallow cores (Jennings et al., 2017, 2018), and seismic stratigraphy correlated to exploration wells (Hofmann et al., 2016).  

# 2.3. Tectonostratigraphic development  

The continental margin of northwest Greenland has a complex geologic and tectonic history tha t involves Cretaceous rift phases, extrusive volcanism, and tectonic inversion as seafloor spreadin g commenced in Baffin Bay. Rifting of the continental margins occurred during the Early and Lat e Cretaceous forming numerous sedimentary basins and elongate grabens that fringe the Baffin Ba y margins (Whittaker et al., 1997; Gregersen et al., 2013; Nøhr-Hansen et al., 2021) (Figure F2). Opening of Baffin Bay ensued from the late Paleocene through the Eocene, likely in tandem wit h the opening of the Labrador Sea (Chalmers et al., 1993) (Figure F1). The separation of Greenlan d relative to the North American continent ceased during the early Oligocene (Chron C13) as seafloor spreading commenced along the Aegir Ridge system of the Icelandic plate boundary (Oake y and Chalmers, 2012; Gregersen et al., 2022). The geologic architecture and stratigraphic knowledge of this region is mainly based on seismic and borehole data collected between 2007 and 201 2 (Gregersen et al., 2013, 2016, 2022; Knutz et al., 2015, 2019, 2022). Eight seismic megaunits hav e been described, of which Megaunits A–E are attributed to the Cenozoic interval deposited afte r continental rifting ceased. The drilling targets of Expedition 400 identified along the key seismi c transect cover Megaunits A–D (Figure F4).  

Oblique plate motions between Greenland and North America resulted in a transpressional tectonic regime (strike-slip) on the West Greenland margin, which gave rise to major basin infillin g packages and deepwater fan systems guided by structural lineaments along inverted rift basin s (Megaunit E). From the middle late Oligocene through the middle Miocene, a more passiv e sedimentation regime ensued with infilling of the remnant rift-basin topography (Megaunits D 1 and D2) (Figures F1, F2, F4). In the Melville Bay Graben, juxtaposed to the Greenland craton, Megaunit D2 forms a several kilometer thick succession of continuously stratified deposits that ar e intensely faulted, primarily as a result of marine clay compaction (Berndt et al., 2003). Thi s package of presumably clay-rich marine sediments overlies stacked fan-type packages that ar e lodged against the Greenland basement, separated by Megaunits D2 and C, and is described as th e mid-Miocene Unconformity (d1) displaying erosion over structural highs and a conformabl e development within basin settings (e.g., Melville Bay Graben) (Figure F4). Megaunit C forms a n asymmetric sediment prism covering wide parts of the inner shelf in northwest Greenland, wit h thicknesses up to $1200\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , that is variably modified by glacial erosion. The prism is interpreted t o be a shelf-bound sediment drift that locally grades into clinoform features associated with prodeltaic environments (Knutz et al., 2015). The boundary between Megaunits C and B is an incise d horizon (c1) that is correlated to extensive mass transport deposits on the lower slope and in th e Baffin Bay basin, suggesting widespread submarine slope instability. The regional character of thi s erosion points to a phase of tectonic adjustment affecting the shelf margin, presumably during th e late Miocene (Knutz et al., 2015). Megaunit B is characterized by distinct lenticular sedimen t bodies featuring asymmetric sediment waves that have accumulated into expanded sections ove r the Horizon c1 erosion scarp (Figure F4). The slope component of Megaunit B is interpreted to b e a contourite drift with seismic ties to nearby drilled sections suggesting a Pliocene age (Knutz e t al., 2015, 2019; Aubry et al., 2021).  

# 2.4. Melville Bugt–Upernavik Trough Mouth Fan system  

A prograded shelf package (Megaunit A) overlying the Neogene sediment drifts reflects deposition under the influence of major ice streams originating from the northwest GrIS sector (Figure s F3, F4). Eleven prograding sedimentary units have been identified, each corresponding to bundle s of glacial advance cycles within a major TMF system (Knutz et al., 2019; Newton et al., 2021). Th e TMF units are numbered according to their top bounding horizons, except for Unit 11, which i s capped by the seabed. The units are separated by glacial unconformities defining paleotrajectorie s of shelf break grounding zones that prograded seaward with sediment supplied by successiv e advances of the NGrIS onto the outer shelf and slope. Between the two modern cross-shel f troughs (Melville Bugt and Upernavik TMFs), topset strata of prograding units and associate d shelf breaks are extremely well preserved because of high sediment input from paleoice stream s and basin subsidence over older rift structures. The Expedition 400 drilling transect was designe d with the intention to extract paleoclimate information from this intertrough aggrading sedimen t wedge (Figure F4). Within the topset package, seismic reflections phase reversed from seabe d onlap the glacial erosion surfaces or infill intrashelf depressions. These reflections, which hav e stratal thicknesses of $>\!20\!-\!30\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , may represent marine muddy sediments deposited during periods of grounding line retreat and rising sea level, interrupting the glacial advance megacycles. A n age model for the depositional evolution of the TMF was reconstructed by correlating the seismi c horizons to nearby wells/boreholes (Knutz et al., 2019). It is hypothesized that the stratal onlaps, succeeding major shifts in ice stream configuration, may have formed during periods of extrem e warmth, such as super-interglacials (Knutz et al., 2019).  

Beyond the shelf break, the horizons of Megaunit A can be traced along clinoformal reflection s to the basin strata, resulting in a complete pseudo-3-D mapping of the depositional units (Figur e F4). The youngest depositional sequence, comprising Units 8–11, which are likely middle to lat e Pleistocene in age, form a series of contourites intersected by channel deposits on the lower slope. Thus, drilling these contourites will allow high-resolution paleoceanographic reconstruction s back to, and potentially through, the MPT.  

In summary, there are several reasons for choosing northeast Baffin Bay for documenting th e Cenozoic evolution of the NGrIS:  

• The area covers a large TMF system primarily constructed by glacial drainage over millions of years.   
• It contains a succession of gently dipping strata where a composite sequence of Oligocene– Quaternary deposits may be drilled at relatively shallow depths.   
• It has extensive coverage of high-quality 2-D and 3-D seismic data with outstanding imaging of glaciogenic sediment progradation, marine deposits formed by along-slope currents, and hemipelagic basin-infilling sediments.   
• A detailed seismic stratigraphy tied to well/borehole information illuminates the sediment transport dynamics from the NGrIS (Knutz et al., 2019).   
• The western Greenland margin is accessible due to amenable ocean temperatures and reduced sea ice associated with the northbound West Greenland Current (Tang et al., 2004; Holland et al., 2008).   
• Expedition 344S demonstrated in 2012 that the R/V JOIDES Resolution can successfully operate in northeast Baffin Bay, a region that is crossed by icebergs but lacks pack ice (Acton and the Expedition 344S, 2012).  

# 2.5. Geophysical data  

The supporting site survey data for Expedition 400 are archived at the IODP Site Survey Dat a Bank (https://ssdb.iodp.org/SSDBquery/SSDBquery.php; select P909 for proposal number).  

Development of the coring plan for Expedition 400 was facilitated by an extensive seismic database. The core sites initially submitted for IODP drilling Proposal 909-Full1 were located usin g 2-D seismic data, including four regional seismic surveys collected by TGS in 2007–2010. Th e final placement of sites (IODP drilling Proposals 909-Full2 and 909-Add) was accomplished base d on (1) two 3-D data volumes, Cairn-PITU-3D-2011 and Shell-ANU-3D-2012, and (2) a dedicate d high-resolution seismic survey completed in 2019 as a collaboration between Geological Survey o f Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) and Geoscience-Aarhus University using the Danish R/V Laug e Koch (LAKO) (Pearce and Knutz, 2019). Both 3-D surveys were utilized in a compilation of seabe d geomorphology (Newton et al., 2017, 2021) and geohazard assessments for further refining dril l site locations (Cox et al., 2020, 2021).  

The LAKO 2019 survey data provide high-resolution coverage (vertical resolution $=\sim\!4\!\-\!-\!6\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m}}]$ ) of al l primary sites and several alternate sites. The multichannel reflection seismic acquisition (15–30 0 Hz) was optimized to gain enhanced resolution in the uppermost $500~\mathrm{m}$ of the sedimentary section, complementary to the existing industry data. A 90 cubic inch generator-injector (GI) gun wa s used as a seismic source configured with a $45~\mathrm{inch^{3}}$ main chamber and a $45~\mathrm{inch^{3}}$ injection chamber. Shot time was $4.0\,s$ for most of the data, and record length varied between 2.0 and $3.5\;{\mathsf s}.$ . Shot s were recorded on a Geometrics GeoEel streamer, which included five $25\textrm{m}$ active sections of  8 channels each (40 channels total) with a group spacing of $3.125\mathrm{~m~}$ . A total of 861 line kilometer s was collected. Initial processing producing a migrated data version was performed on the ship. Final processing on shore included confirmation of static and delay correction, deconvolution t o zero-phase data, and fk filtering. The overall data quality was excellent, except some of the shel f sections marked by significant short wavelength variations due to a rough seabed (e.g., boulders, glacial scouring, and iceberg plough marks).  

For converting seismic drilling targets into metric depths, the proposed sites were bundled int o four groups based on similarities in the depositional setting, geologic context, and general targe t depths. To obtain the most realistic time-depth conversion, all available data from the region wa s reviewed. Velocity information was extracted from existing industry boreholes south of the transect (e.g., Gamma-1), data gained from Expedition 344S sites north of the transect, and an interva l velocity cube derived from the Cairn-PITU-3D-2011 seismic volume. The average vertical profil e velocities applied for each setting were $1800\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ for the deepwater sites (U1603 and U1604; proposed Sites MB-23A and MB-02C), $2200~\mathrm{m/s}$ for the glacigenic topset strata on the shelf (Sit e U1605; proposed Site MB-31A and not drilled Site MB-30A), $1900\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ for the Pliocene contourit e sediments (Sites U1608 and U1606; proposed Sites MB-06D and MB-17A), and $2050\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ for th e Miocene succession (Site U1607; proposed Site MB-07B).  

# 3. Scientific objectives  

The overall objective of Expedition 400 is to provide new insights into the long-term evolution o f the NGrIS. To this end, seismic imaging from the deep basin to inner shelf has guided the selectio n of coring sites and stratigraphic correlation. A multiproxy diagnostic template has been developed, which in concert with a transect-drilling strategy can constrain different phases of ice extent an d regional climate regimes (Figure F5). This template provides a methodological basis to tes t hypotheses that are crucial for understanding GrIS history, how the glacial margins will respond t o continued warming in the near future, and how this may affect other components of the Eart h system.  

Expedition 400 objectives focus on answering three key questions.  

# 3.1. How did the NGrIS respond to extreme interglacial warmth?  

Cosmogenic nuclides in subice bedrock show that central Greenland was almost completely deglaciated during one or more intervals over the last 2.5 My (Schaefer et al., 2016). This study canno t determine a unique ice cover history, but three scenarios are proposed varying from ice-free interglacials to a single $280~\mathrm{ky}$ deglacial event during the early Pleistocene, followed by ${\sim}1.1$ Ma o f uninterrupted ice sheet coverage. Cosmogenic exposure age dating of the basal sediments an d sediment-rich ice at the base of the Camp Century ice core indicate that the northwest GrI S retreated significantly during MIS 11 ${\sim}400\,\mathrm{ka}$ before present [BP]) (Christ et al., 2023). The longterm depositional record on the margin of northeast Baffin Bay contains the glaciation histor y needed to infer when such extreme mass loss occurred. By drilling high-accumulation sites in th e basin (Sites U1603 and U1604) and on the shelf margin (Site U1605) targeting potential interglacial deposits, we intend to test the hypothesis that the NGrIS underwent substantial deglaciatio n on one or more occasions during the Pleistocene. Parameters for identifying warm interglacia l periods will be derived from multiple qualitative and quantitative proxies that constrain ice shee t response and environmental conditions in both marine and terrestrial/atmospheric areas.  

# 3.2. When did glacial inception occur in northwest Greenland, and how did the NGrIS dynamics evolve through Cenozoic climate transitions?  

The relationship between long-term $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ trends, temperature records, and global ice volume i s poorly understood. A northwest Greenland perspective of this knowledge gap will be gained b y retrieving a composite Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene interval covered by primary Site s U1606–U1608. These archives will provide information on timing, sedimentary processes, an d changes in denudation rates of Greenland through periods of large atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ variations. Organic components carried by these sediments in allochthonous or autochthonous fractions wil l provide insights into terrestrial and marine ecosystems and information on background climat e states. We hypothesize that the decrease in $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ from the early middle Oligocene $(>\!600\,\,\mathrm{ppm})$ t o early Miocene $(<\!300\mathrm{\ppm})$ coincides with cold and possibly glacial environments in northwes t Greenland. This will be tested by recovering a $980\,\textrm{m}$ long climate record from Oligocene– Miocene strata at Site U1607.  

A complicating factor, disrupting or modulating a linear response between $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ forcing and ic e sheet growth/decay, may involve tectonic base-level adjustments causing snow line lowerin g (Foster et al., 2010) or changes in heat flux through oceanic gateways (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2017). Extensive submarine landslides into Baffin Bay associated with a late Miocene unconformity (c1 ) along the northwest Greenland margin may reflect a regional tectonic adjustment apparently predating the first shelf edge advances (Knutz et al., 2015). This erosion event may be linked to hinterland uplift (Japsen et al., 2006), but a more concise understanding of its origin requires recovery o f Neogene sediments. Following a full-scale glaciation, physical weathering would redistribute mas s from the Greenland craton to the continental slope and consequently accelerate hinterland uplif t by isostatic compensation (Berger et al., 2008; Medvedev et al., 2013), prompting the question: di d active tectonics play a role in the development of the GrIS (Solgaard et al., 2013), or are the lat e Neogene basin adjustments along the West Greenland margin a response to mass redistributio n caused by glacial erosion (Ruddiman and Kutzbach, 1989; Molnar and England, 1990; Eyles, 1996)?

The timing of the advance of marine-based glaciers onto the northwest Greenland margin is presently ambiguous. Drilling through the initial clinoforms of the first prograding unit and farthe r into marine contourite sediments of probable Pliocene age (Sites U1608 and U1606) will test th e hypothesis that glacial expansion of the NGrIS is linked with intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation $(3.3{-}2.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ .  

Understanding the evolution of the NGrIS may hold the key to the origin of Northern Hemispher e glaciation, including the mechanisms of gradual amplification of glacial cycles since the late Pliocene and the shift from 40 to 100 ky cycles across the MPT (Raymo and Huybers, 2008). A majo r reorganization in the ice flow that drains the NGrIS apparently occurred across the MPT (Knut z et al., 2019). Hence, both local and regional evidence suggests that major changes in the size, erosivity, and responsiveness of the GrIS occurred throughout the Pleistocene (Bierman et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 2016). By drilling Seismic Units 7–9 at the deepwater sites (U1603 and U1604) an d on the shelf (Site U1605), we will examine changes in NGrIS dynamics through the MPT pertaining to recent models, in particular the regolith hypothesis (Clark and Pollard, 1998).  

# 3.3. What is the paleoceanographic and cryospheric significance of Pliocene contourite drifts in northeast Baffin Bay?  

The early mid-Pliocene was characterized by relatively warm and humid forest tundra condition s in the high Arctic of Canada (Matthews and Ovenden, 1990; Fyles et al., 1994; Csank et al., 2011; Rybczynski et al., 2013) and Greenland (Bennike et al., 2002). A similar environment was inferre d from early Pleistocene interglacial deposits in northern Greenland (Funder et al., 2001), which i s when southern Greenland appears to have been forested (de Vernal and Mudie, 1989). Thes e warm Arctic conditions occurred under modest $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels $({\sim}400\,\mathrm{ppm})$ , implying a high sensitivity of the Pliocene Arctic climate to $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ or the influence of other forcing factors (Haywood et al., 2016, 2020; Feng et al., 2022). Pliocene glacial ice was likely limited to high-elevation terrains i n eastern and southern Greenland, although climate models are limited by a dearth of prox y archives close to Greenland (Koenig et al., 2015). In the late Neogene, presumably the lates t Miocene and Pliocene, the West Greenland/Baffin Bay margin was influenced by contour current s that deposited extensive sedimentary drifts (Knutz et al., 2015). The establishment of persisten t oceanic gradients strong enough to maintain a geostrophic boundary current over millions o f years is intriguing and may be linked with enhanced Pliocene Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation. Past configurations of Arctic gateways (e.g., Davis Strait, Nares Strait, Fram Strait, and Berin g Strait) could have played a key role for poleward heat exchange during the Pliocene (Hu et al., 2015; Keisling et al., 2017); however, the tectonic history of these topographic thresholds is poorl y known (Eyles, 1996; Knies et al., 2014). The contourite deposits of Megaunit B, presently expose d at shallow depths below the glacial trough, can illuminate the environmental conditions of thi s paleocurrent system that appear to have existed prior to the expansion of the NGrIS.  

Sites U1608 and U1606 provide a composite succession that can constrain Pliocene climat e variability and paleotemperatures and test whether or not the high Arctic warmth of the earl y mid-Pliocene is associated with enhanced heat advection through Baffin Bay.  

# 3.4. Summary of scientific objectives  

1. Test the hypothesis that the NGrIS underwent significant deglaciation at intervals within the frequency range of orbital eccentricity $({\sim}100{-}400\,\mathrm{ky})$ . Pleistocene sites on the slope (Sites U1603 and U1604) and the outer shelf (Sites U1605) are the key sites for attaining this objective.  

2. Test the hypothesis that the general decrease in $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ from the early middle Oligocene to the early Miocene resulted in cold and possibly glacially dominated environments in northwest Greenland. Site U1607 on the middle shelf addresses this objective.   
3. Provide information on the timing, sedimentary processes, sediment sources, and Greenland exposure history in the context of late Neogene tectonic adjustments inferred from the seismic record. Pliocene drill sites on the middle shelf (Sites U1606 and U1608) and Oligocene to Miocene Site U1607 on the middle shelf will address this objective.   
4. Test the hypothesis that major glacial expansion of the NGrIS is linked with widespread intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation $(3.3{-}2.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . Pliocene drill sites on the middle shelf (Sites U1606 and U1608) will address this objective.   
5. Assess recent models for the change in orbital cycles through the MPT by analyzing sediment maturity and regolith history. Pleistocene sites on the slope (Sites U1603 and U1604) and the outer shelf (Site U1605) are the key sites for attaining this objective.   
6. Investigate whether high Arctic warmth of the early mid-Pliocene is related to heat advection through the western North Atlantic Ocean and Baffin Bay. Pliocene drill sites on the middle shelf (Sites U1606 and U1608) will address this objective.  

# 3.5. Connections to the 2050 Science Framework  

The scientific objectives of IODP Expedition 400 are relevant to Strategic Objectives 3 (Earth’ s Climate System), 4 (Feedbacks in the Earth System), and 5 (Tipping Points in Earth’s History) o f the 2050 Scientific Framework. Strategic Objective 3 Earth’s Climate System recognizes th e importance of understanding ice sheet history as a driver of sea level changes and oceanatmosphere interactions, including understanding how the polar ice sheets will respond t o increasing atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentrations. During Expedition 400, a transect of sites wer e drilled that capture an extensive history of glaciation in northern Greenland over the last 25 My. This timescale includes past warm periods when atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was higher than today an d interglacial periods when sea level exceeded today’s, indicating significant ice sheet melting. Th e GrIS has been resilient in the face of modern warming but is showing signs of enhanced mass loss. The unique geologic archive recovered during Expedition 400 spans pre-Northern Hemispher e glaciation, early ephemeral glaciation on northern Greenland, and the expansion of Norther n Hemisphere glaciation as recorded by the building of the Melville Bugt TMF. The informatio n gained from Expedition 400 is societally relevant because it will contribute important data to computer models that aim to predict future rates and magnitudes of sea level rise from melting ic e sheets. By sampling the natural range of sedimentary processes and responses to climate forcing s involved in the change from Arctic warmth to extreme cooling and notably the onset of Norther n Hemisphere glaciation, the Expedition 400 archive addresses Strategic Objectives 4 Feedbacks i n the Earth System and 5 Tipping Points in Earth’s History. A potential tipping point can result fro m Greenland Ice Sheet meltwaters entering the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre, impacting areas o f deepwater formation and leading to destabilization of the overturning circulation. Expedition 40 0 data provides high-resolution geologic records for evaluating such tipping points over multipl e cycles in the past, which may help to predict how GrIS melt will influence, and be influenced by, today’s changing climate.  

# 4. Site summaries  

# 4.1. Site U1603  

# 4.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1603 (proposed Site MB-23A) is located at $72^{\circ}59.0386^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{{z}}}$ , $62^{\circ}58.8333^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at a water depth o f 1801 mbsl below a prominent crescent-shaped protrusion of the Melville Bugt TMF on the northwest Greenland shelf margin (Figures F1, F2). The site was aimed at retrieving a continuous highresolution record of ice-ocean processes spanning the early late Pleistocene. The depth target wa s the base of an expanded drift-channel succession situated on the lower slope between the Melvill e Bugt and Upernavik TMFs that are the modern expression of major paleoice streams draining th e NGrIS (Knutz et al., 2019; Newton et al., 2017, 2020, 2021). The sedimentary succession is covere d by regional 2-D as well as high-resolution multichannel seismic data providing a detailed seismi c stratigraphy to guide the drilling objectives. The strategy at Site U1603 was to core through th e youngest Seismic Units 9–11 and reach through a stratified interval within Seismic Unit 8, whic h appears to predate the channel formation. Site U1603 is paired with Site U1604 located ${\sim}35~\mathrm{km}$ northwest, where a complementary stratigraphic coverage can be achieved by targeting a n expanded section of Unit 8 and then continue drilling to just below Horizon 7 (Figure F6).  

The drift-channel system cored at Site U1603 is influenced by the circulation of deep water masse s in Baffin Bay, which is poorly constrained by synoptic data (Tang et al., 2004). Gyre pulses of th e West Greenland Current overflow the site at intermediate depths around $300~\mathrm{mbsl}$ (Münchow e t al., 2015). The succession is considered to be a product of Pleistocene ice-ocean interactions tha t were particularly active during periods with ice was grounded on the outer shelf and phases of ic e sheet retreat. The scientific objectives for drilling Sites U1603 and U1604 are to (1) test th e hypothesis that the NGrIS underwent significant deglaciation at intervals within the frequenc y range of orbital eccentricity $({\sim}100{-}400\ \mathrm{ky})$ ) (Schaefer et al., 2016; Knutz et al., 2019) potentiall y related to exceptionally strong super-interglacials (Melles et al., 2012) and (2) achieve a long-ter m understanding (last 0.5 My or older) of marine-based ice sheet dynamics and phasing relation s between ice streams draining different sectors of the North American and Greenland Ice Sheets. In particular, we hope that the records can provide insights to ocean conditions through glacia l terminations and ice-ocean dynamics associated with the different stages of ice sheet configurations (Simon et al., 2014), which may implicate far-field effects such as opening/closing of th e Canadian Arctic Straits (Lofverstrom et al., 2022). Finally, the multiproxy data collected at dee p water Sites U1603 and U1604 will contribute to the objective of assessing the regolith hypothesi s for the change in orbital insolation frequency across the MPT (Clark and Pollard, 1998; Willeit e t al., 2019).

Coring was planned in three holes with a target depth of $250\;\mathrm{m}$ core depth below seafloor, Metho d A (CSF-A), using the advanced piston corer (APC) coring system in the first two holes and $422\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in the third hole using the APC/extended core barrel (XCB) coring system. Downhole logging with triple combo tool string, Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI), and Formation MicroScanne r (FMS) was planned for the third hole.  

# 4.1.2. Operations  

Expedition 400 began in Reykjavík, Iceland, at Skarfabakki Harbor at $0815~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 August 2023. The IODP Expedition 395 science party departed the vessel on 12 August, and on 13 August th e crew, staff, and science party of Expedition 400 boarded the vessel, with the oncoming JOIDE S Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) technical staff arriving at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ and the science party arriving at $1445\,\mathrm{h}$ . Immigration checks for those sailing were done dockside in the afternoon and completed by $1600\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . The science party began expedition preparation and received orientation s including life at sea and safety training, along with introductions to the laboratories during the res t of the port call. The two ice navigators were set up with Internet access, and the ice analysis an d reporting routine was initiated. Freight was completed throughout the port call and included offgoing shipments of core and refrigerated and frozen samples as well as the loading of sepiolit e (drilling mud), drilling equipment, and fresh and frozen foods. On 16 August, fuel was bunkere d and a boat drill was conducted.  

The vessel was readied for departure and the pilot came on board at $0745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 August. The tug s were secured shortly after, and the last line was released at $0806\,\mathrm{h}$ , marking the official start of th e transit. By $0822\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , the tugboats were released, the pilot departed, and sea passage to Site U160 3 began at $0824\mathrm{~h~}$ . The vessel remained underway until arriving at Site U1603 at $1355\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 2 3 August. The thrusters were lowered and secured at $1412\;\mathrm{h},$ , and the vessel was fully in dynami c positioning (DP) mode at $1420\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending the transit. The journey covered $1721\;\mathrm{nmi}$ at an averag e speed of $11.3\,\mathrm{kt}$ (including pilotage).  

The first attempt to spud Hole U1603A was an APC barrel shot from 1802.0 meters below rig floo r (mbrf), resulting in a water core. The pipe was lowered $5\;\mathrm{m}$ , and a core barrel was shot from 180 7 mbrf. Hole U1603A was spudded at $0425\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August with $4.65\:\mathrm{m}$ recovered. The seafloor wa s calculated at $1800.8~\mathrm{{mbsl}}$ (1811.9 mbrf). Meters below rig floor depth is $11.1\,\textrm{m}$ greater tha n meters below sea level. APC coring continued through Core 400-U1603A-13H at $118.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool was run on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H. The core liner shattered on Core 13H and had to be pumped out of the liner.  

At $1515~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August, the bridge notified the drill floor that an iceberg had entered the Re d Zone (i.e., will be within 3 nmi of the vessel in less than twice the time it will take to trip up to 5 0 m CSF-A). The drill string was tripped up with the top drive from 109.1 to $43.21\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ at 160 0 h. From 1600 to $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ , the vessel tracked two icebergs. At $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ , with one of the icebergs entering the Termination Zone (within 1 nmi of the vessel) the order was given to pull the pipe clear o f the seafloor. The drill string was again pulled up with the top drive, this time to 1778.3 mbrf, clearing the seafloor at $1742~\mathrm{h}$ and ending Hole U1603A. The vessel was moved $500\textrm{m}$ south in D P mode. The closest iceberg passed within ${\sim}0.6$ nmi of the vessel. Once it was safe to do so, the vesse l was moved back over location and offset $10\,\mathrm{m}$ northwest from Hole U1603A, coming into positio n at $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August.  

Hole U1603B was spudded at $2035~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August. Hole U1603B was washed down to $109.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A by $0100~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 August. Coring began with Core 400-U1603B-2H from $109.1\textrm{m}$ CSF- A and continued to Core 5H at $147.1\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. After an overpull and drill over of Core 5H, w e switched to the half-length APC (HLAPC) system. Coring with the HLAPC started with Core 6 F and continued through Core 27F, shot from $243.9\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A at $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 August. The barre l pulled free from the formation with no overpull; however, the coring line could not pull the barre l up. The drill string was tripped back up to the vessel, with the bit clearing the rig floor at $1157\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1603B. Once the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was on board, the core barrel wa s recovered with $0.08~\mathrm{m}$ of material, likely from the push down trying to free the barrel. The fina l depth for Hole U1603B was $244.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

The vessel was offset $10\,\mathrm{m}$ northwest, and Hole U1603C was spudded at $0105\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August. Th e hole was drilled down over the next $7.75~\mathrm{h}$ . Cores 400-U1603C-2R through 9R advanced fro m 211.5 to $285.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $22.78\;\mathrm{m}\;(33\%)$ . At $1945\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August, ice moved within  3 nmi of the vessel and we raised the drill string to $22.3\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and began waiting on ice (WOI). At $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 August, ice entered the $1\ \mathrm{nmi}$ exclusion zone. We raised the drill string, clearin g the seafloor at $0009\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , ending Hole U1603C and continued WOI. The vessel was moved $1200\;\mathrm{m}$ east-northeast and then $700\:\mathrm{m}$ east-southeast in DP mode to maintain a safe distance from the ice. By $0330\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , the ice had cleared the site and the vessel was positioned $10\;\mathrm{m}$ northwest from Hol e U1603C.  

Hole U1603D was spudded at $0455~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 August and was drilled ahead with a wash barrel t o $102.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Because ice once again neared the site, we decided to install a free-fall funne l (FFF) to allow us to reenter Hole U1603D. The FFF was deployed at $0950~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{m}}$ , and by $1030~\mathrm{h}$ w e resumed drilling ahead in Hole U1603D to $189.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. At $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ , ice moved within $3\;\mathrm{nmi}$ o f the vessel, and we raised the drill string to $22.3\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A by $1515\,\mathrm{h}$ and began WOI for the remainder of the day.  

By $0015\mathrm{~h~}$ on 29 August, the ice had cleared the site. The drill string was lowered to $169.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and we washed back to $189.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A before drilling ahead to $269.4\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Cores 400- U1603D-2R through 8R advanced from 269.4 to $333.2\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and recovered $14.62\;\mathrm{m}\;(24\%)$ . A t $1400\ \mathrm{h},$ ice moved within $3\ \mathrm{nmi}$ of the vessel, and we raised the drill string to $22.3\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ b y $1545~\mathrm{h}$ and began WOI. Once again ice entered the 1 nmi exclusion zone, and we raised the dril l string, clearing the seafloor at $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel was moved $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ north in DP mode to maintain a safe distance from the ice. By $2157\,\mathrm{h}$ , we began to move back toward the site, and the vesse l was in position over Hole U1603D by $2348\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 August.  

At $0100~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 August, we began preparing the subsea camera system to assist with reenterin g Hole U1603D. At $0320\,\mathrm{h}$ , we successfully reentered the hole and recovered the subsea camera system. The drill string was lowered to $294.4\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and we washed back to $318.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A befor e encountering material that had fallen into the bottom of the hole. A center bit was dropped, an d we washed to $333.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A by $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ . Cores 400-U1603D-9R through 18R advanced from 333. 2 to $422.0\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and recovered $28.69\,\mathrm{m}\,(32\%)$ . Sepiolite (drilling mud) was swept in the hole, an d the bit was released at $2315\,\mathrm{h}$ to prepare for logging Hole U1603D. We then tripped the drill strin g up with the bit positioned at $50.8~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in preparation for logging.  

The modified triple combo tool string, termed the “quad combo,” was rigged up and, following  a repair to the logging winch, was deployed to the base of Hole U1603D $\mathrm{^{(419.5\:m\,CSF-A)}}$ ). The qua d combo measures natural gamma ray, density, acoustic velocity, resistivity, magnetic susceptibilit y (MS), and density. Following a complete pass of the hole, the quad combo was pulled to the ri g floor and broken down. The VSI was rigged up, and the protected species watch began at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 August. The VSI was deployed but almost immediately experienced a communication issue. The tool was brought back on board and repaired. At $1800~\mathrm{h}$ , the VSI was deployed to $413.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and stations were measured uphole until $2120\,\mathrm{h}$ when fog impacted visibility and the ability to monitor for protected species. After the VSI tool was brought back on board and broke n down, the FMS-sonic tool string was assembled and deployed. The FMS-sonic tool string was run, and the tools were back on deck by $0345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 September. With logging completed, we trippe d the pipe out of Hole U1603D, clearing the rig floor at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ and ending Hole U1603D.  

An APC/XCB BHA was made up, and we began tripping the drill pipe back to the seafloor at 120 0 h. The vessel was offset $10\;\mathrm{m}$ northwest in DP mode, and the pipe was pumped with a cleanou t tool while the tracer pumps were running. Hole U1603E was spudded at $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 September, and Core 400-U1603E-1H recovered $6.94~\mathrm{m}$ . Core 2H advanced to $16.4~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $9.75~\mathrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ . Cores 3H through 6H each advanced $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ but recovered almost no material (less than 2 0 cm each). The deplugger was run in the pipe. Core 7F advanced from 54.4 to $59.1~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A an d recovered $0.31\mathrm{~m~}(7\%)$ . Following Core 7F we decided to abandon Hole U1603E because of lack o f recovery, and the drill string was tripped out, clearing the seafloor at $0140\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 September.  

The vessel was offset $10\;\mathrm{m}$ southeast of Hole U1603A to hopefully improve recovery and allow fo r better correlation with other holes. Hole U1603F was spudded at $0235~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 September. Core s 400-U1603F-1H through 5H advanced from 0 to $44.0\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and recovered $45.49\mathrm{~m~}(103\%).$ . Core 6F $\left(44.0{-}48.80\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ CSF-A; $4.73\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered) was cored with the HLAPC system to hel p adjust core spacing to cover gaps in Hole U1603A. Cores 400-U1603F-7H through 15H advance d from 48.8 to $134.3\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $66.71\;\mathrm{m}\;(78\%)$ . The APCT-3 tool was run on Cores 4 H and 10H. We then began pulling the drill string out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $1935\,\mathrm{h}$ . Th e drill string was tripped up, with the bit at the surface at $0030~\mathrm{h}$ . The drill floor was secured fo r transit, and the thrusters were raised and secured for transit at $0145~\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1603F an d Site U1603.  

# 4.1.3. Principal results  

# 4.1.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1603 consists of six overlapping holes (Holes U1603A–U1603F) cored to a total depth of 42 2 m CSF-A. Based on $243.6~\mathrm{m}$ of recovered sediment, the $422~\mathrm{m}$ thick section is divided into fou r lithostratigraphic units. Named lithofacies are sedimentary, are present in all four units with variable predominance, and include mud, calcareous mud, interlaminated to interbedded mud an d sand, sandy mud with common clasts, and diamicton (Figure F7).  

Sediments recovered are consistent with the site location at the base of the continental slope proximal to a glaciated margin and deposited during the early to late Pleistocene. The deposits from  0 to ${\sim}243\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Lithostratigraphic Units I and II) are consistent with downslope and alongslope sedimentation on a channel levee system with high sedimentation rates $({\sim}25~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ . Th e upper ${\sim}42\;\mathrm{m}$ (Lithostratigraphic Unit I) consists of mud with irregular sand laminae and disperse d clasts. A thick sequence of interlaminated to interbedded mud and sand is predominant betwee n ${\sim}42$ and $243\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Lithostratigraphic Unit II) and is further divided into two subunits distinguished by laminae/bed thickness, proportion of mud versus sand, and clast occurrence. Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIA (42–145 m CSF-A) consists of finer laminae, thinner sand beds, and  a lower proportion of sand, whereas Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIB $\left.\sim\!145\!-\!243\,\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ CSF-A) ha s thicker laminae and beds, a higher proportion of sand, and a relatively higher clast abundance. From 243 to 374 m CSF-A, weakly stratified mud lithologies were dominant, sand lithofacies wer e rare, and clast occurrence increases significantly (Lithostratigraphic Unit III). In the lower ${\sim}46~\mathrm{m}$ of the Hole U1603D (Lithostratigraphic Unit IV; 374–422 m CSF-A), weakly stratified muds similar in character to Unit III are present, but this unit also contains an interval of calcareous mu d and various types of soft-sediment deformation that is absent in overlying Unit III.  

# 4.1.3.2. Micropaleontology  

Core catcher samples from Holes U1603A–U1603D, together with additional samples from spli t sections, were examined for foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, and other palynomorphs. The additional samples examined for all microfossil groups were taken within cores where variations i n lithology were observed. Sampling targets included intervals of massive muds, bioturbation, an d muds with dispersed clasts that coincided with low natural gamma radiation (NGR) values, as wel l as carbonate-rich intervals. Mudline samples from Holes U1603A and U1603F were also examined. Cores from Holes U1603E and U1603F, which include a second copy of the upper ${\sim}130\;\mathrm{m}$ o f the cored section, were not examined. Observations of foraminifera from palynomorph and diatom slide preparations were integrated in the overall foraminifera evaluations. Calcareous nannofossils were observed in smear slides by the sedimentology team in one core catcher sample an d two diatom slides. A cursory examination of these was attempted but requires further study by  a nannofossil specialist.  

The muds and interlaminated sands and muds typical of Site U1603 are generally barren of diatoms and foraminifera. Where foraminifera appear, including planktonic and benthic species, the y remain as trace to rare occurrences, except for two distinct intervals in Cores 400-U1603A-8H an d 400-U1603D-13R where the planktonic foraminifera species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma i s common to abundant. Diatoms were found in about $6\%$ of all samples examined with trace to rar e amounts of specimens and species. Palynomorph preparations revealed persistent contribution s of phytoclasts and reworked terrestrial pollen and spores. The observed microfossil specimen s and assemblages for all groups are typical of cold-water polar environments and in situ dinocys t species are typical of coastal or neritic environments. Observed specimens and assemblages ar e broadly consistent with a Pleistocene and younger age. The observed planktonic and benthic foraminifera species have long stratigraphic ranges and provide limited age control; however, th e observed dinocysts are of Pleistocene and younger age. More detailed analysis of calcareous nannofossils may provide future constraints and a test of the paleomagnetic reversal interpretation s and provisional age model.  

One mudline sample was collected for sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) in Hole U1603A.  A total of 60 additional samples for sedaDNA analysis were collected: 9 samples from Hole U1603 E and 51 samples from Hole U1603F. Catwalk samples were generally taken at the bottom of Sections 1, 3, and 5 (if the section was available and the section bottom was undisturbed). Additiona l samples were collected in the working half of split sections targeting nonstratified mud layer s characterized by low values of NGR and MS. All samples were immediately stored at $-86^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . T o assess the potential for contamination during coring and the sectioning of cores on the catwalk,  a perfluorocarbon tracer was added to the drilling fluid and the majority of samples have a contamination level close to or below detection limit.

Figure F7. Lithostratigraphic summary, Site U1603. All Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) point MS measurement s were filtered to exclude measurements greater than two standard deviations from mean (thin red line) and depth-base d rolling average of filtered data using a $10\,\mathsf{m}$ window (thick red line). Same method was used to plot red minus blue Sectio n Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) data and whole-round NGR measurements. Total weight percent calcium carbonate in measured samples are also shown (red lines $=$ samples from intervals identified as calcareous mud [Lithofacies 2]). Clasts coun t per $10\,{\mathsf{c m}}$ data are centered on middle of $10\,{\mathsf{c m}}$ interval. Number of sand beds $\geq\uparrow$ cm thick per core section are centered o n middle of core section (black line $=$ depth-based rolling average of data using a $10\;\mathsf{m}$ window). $\mathsf{c p s=}$ counts per second.  

# 4.1.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements from Site U1603 were performed to investigate th e natural remanent magnetization (NRM) in a total of 313 archive-half sections. Measurement s were not made on 16 archive-half sections that had highly disturbed sediments, and no passthrough measurements were made on core catcher samples. All measurements on section halve s were made at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals; we measured the initial magnetization and the magnetization following stepwise peak alternating field (AF) demagnetizations at 5, 10, 15, and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . Inclination s from filtered data imply that periods of both normal and reversed polarity were recovered at Sit e U1603. Most inclination magnitudes fall under expected values for the latitude of Site U160 3 during normal (positive inclinations) and reversed (negative inclinations) polarities.  

A total of 188 discrete cube samples were taken from the working-half sections from Hole s U1603A–U1603D. Generally, we collected one sample per section, avoiding visually disturbe d intervals. We measured 54 samples on the AGICO JR-6A spinner magnetometer, and 146 sample s on the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM). Some samples were measured on both instruments to ensure cross-calibration. Anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) was also measured on a subset of 45 discrete samples from Holes U1603A and U1603B. These measurement s were compared with bulk MS. The relationship between ARM and MS is quasilinear, which suggests that the concentration of magnetic minerals is the primary control on both measurements, and supports the use of normalized remanence for estimating relative paleointensity.  

# 4.1.3.4. Physical properties  

Physical property data were acquired on all cores of Holes U1603A, U1603B, U1603C, an d U1603D using the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) for wet bulk density from gamm a ray attenuation (GRA), MS, and $P$ -wave velocity $P$ -wave logger [PWL]). We also measured NG R in all sections longer than $50\,\mathrm{cm}$ . Thermal conductivity was measured in one whole-round sectio n per core, when possible. However, it was measured on one working-half section per core if th e sediment was too hard or the whole-round measurement readings were unreliable. For Hole s U1603E and U1603F, only NGR and low-resolution MS were logged. These cores were sampled fo r pore water, thus equalization to room temperature was not possible, and therefore PWL measurements were not made. They were also sampled for sedaDNA, thus the GRA source was kept inactive during WRMSL logging to avoid possible effects on the DNA.  

Once the whole rounds were split into two halves, we acquired X-ray imaging on the archive halve s of every core. The Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) was used to measure point MS an d color reflectance using the $\mathrm{{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{{b}^{\ast}}}}$ color system as well as red-green-blue (RGB) color of the sediments with digital color imaging. In addition, we determined $P$ -wave velocities at discrete point s on the working halves of almost all cores from Site U1603. In general, we measured discrete $P$ - wave velocity in 3 sections per core for APC cores and 2 sections per core for HLAPC and rotar y core barrel (RCB) cores. However, caliper $P$ -wave velocity (PWC) was measured in all sections o f Holes U1603E and U1603F to compensate the lack of PWL measurements. The measuremen t interval within each section was changed to accommodate lithologic variations. Two samples pe r core for moisture and density (MAD) were taken and processed from Holes U1603A–U1603D t o obtain discrete wet bulk density, dry bulk density, grain density, and porosity.  

Prominent variations in physical property values occur at similar depths in NGR, density, and M S and are associated with major lithologic changes in the cores. More uniform lithologies ar e reflected by more monotonous physical property signals. The correlation between these physica l properties distinguishes four physical properties (PP) units (I–IV) for Site U1603. In PP Unit I (0– $20\textrm{m}$ CSF-A), NGR, density, and MS all increase gradually downhole through the unit, whic h simultaneously transitions from mud to interlaminated mud with thin sandy beds. PP Unit II (20– $160\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) is characterized by high-amplitude variability in NGR, density, and MS. The lithology of PP Unit II is widely variable, and mud intervals correspond to low values of NGR, density, and MS whereas intervals of interbedded mud with abundant sand layers have high NGR, density, and MS values. In PP Unit III (160–215 m CSF-A), NGR is relatively constant whereas MS an d density decrease slightly downhole in the unit. The low variability of these physical properties i n PP Unit III occurs in a sand dominated lithology, and minimum MS values in the unit correlate t o interbedded thin layers of mud. PP Unit IV (215–422 m CSF-A) is placed within a transition fro m primarily diamicton to primarily mud and sandy mud with small intervals of diamicton. Highamplitude variability of NGR, density, and MS is likely related to this lithologic transition.  

# 4.1.3.5. Geochemistry  

Samples for headspace gas, interstitial water (IW) chemistry, and bulk sediment geochemistr y were analyzed at Site U1603. Headspace hydrocarbon gas measurements show low concentration s in the upper $150~\mathrm{m}$ and higher concentrations of methane, with a low yet consistent presence o f ethane, in sediments below $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. A key observation from IW analysis is a decrease i n lithium and potassium with depth, possibly suggesting clay formation. A monotonic decrease i n sulfate with depth to a minimum at around $150\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ may provide evidence for a sulfate– methane transition zone. IW iron, manganese, and phosphate show elevated concentrations nea r the seafloor and sharp decreases to low concentrations with depth. Increases in IW calcium an d alkalinity in the shallower depths may indicate dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals. Elemental analysis of solid material revealed overall low concentrations of carbon and nitrogen acros s most intervals, albeit individual layers were rich in calcium carbonate $\mathbf{\left(CaCO_{3}\right)}$ with contents of u p to $60\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ .  

# 4.1.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

The physical property records for Site U1603 were compared and correlated where possible t o establish a common depth scale. To minimize coring gap alignment, sequences from Hole s U1603A–U1603D were examined using whole-round MS ( $\mathrm{2~cm}$ resolution; WRMSL) and NG R ( $\operatorname{l}0\,\mathsf{c m}$ resolution; all holes) data. In addition, NGR and MS (5 cm resolution) data were measure d on sections from Holes U1603E and U1603F and examined in near-real time to ensure adequat e coring depths to fill the gaps in Hole U1603A. Because triple APC offset coring was abandoned i n favor of reaching the total depth at Site U1603, the splice could only provide partial stratigraphi c coverage. The difficulty was further magnified by low recovery rates below $105~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Thus, Holes U1603A, U1603B, U1603C, and U1603D are correlated to each other, but they were mostl y aligned by the seafloor. Holes U1603E and U1603F were correlated to Hole U1603A, completing  a splice of the upper $78\;\mathrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor, Method A (CCSF-A). Although it i s still not possible to build a complete CCSF-A depth scale for Site U1603, the high recovery an d core alignment between Holes U1603A, U1603E, and U1603F allows for the construction of  a pseudo-splice to $98.5\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ .  

# 4.1.3.7. Age model  

The age model for Site U1603 is largely based on magnetostratigraphic interpretations from Hole s U1603A–U1603D. From the seafloor to $\sim\!194\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, sediment is characterized by norma l polarity and is interpreted to be the Brunhes Chron. At $\mathord{\sim}194\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, there is a transition t o reversed polarity, likely representing the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary. We also observe a shallowing in inclinations in the lower part of Core 400-U1603A-1H, likely representing the Lascham p excursion. Between the Laschamp excursion and the bottom of the Brunhes Chron, we estimat e an average sediment accumulation rate of ${\sim}25~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . The normal polarity zone below ${\sim}327\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1603D is not well constrained because of gaps in recovery and drilling disturbance; however, it may be interpreted as the Jaramillo Subcron. The coarse biostratigraphic constraints provided by dinocysts and sporadic foraminifera and diatom occurrences are consisten t with this interpretation of the magnetostratigraphy.  

# 4.1.3.8. Downhole measurements  

Downhole logging was carried out in Hole U1603D. A modified triple combo tool string, the qua d combo, was deployed with Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde (MSS), natural gamma ray, electrical laterolog resistivity, acoustic velocity, and density tools. Upon completion of the downhole loggin g with the quad combo, vertical seismic profiling was attempted with the VSI. The VSI aimed t o obtain an accurate time-depth relationship to tie the logging and coring results with the seismi c data. A total of 15 stations were planned for the geophones to record seismic images on the hole; however, a decrease in visibility due to fog resulted in terminating the VSI experiment after 1 0 stations were attempted. The coupling between the geophone and the hole failed at the botto m station. The FMS was run together with the Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) to obtain formation resistivity and velocity data that were used in the core-log-seismic correlation of this site. The DSI wa s used for calibration/comparison with the velocities obtained using the quad combo. Logging measurements were crucial for covering recovery gaps during RCB coring. The downhole natura l gamma ray and density logs have features in common with the equivalent laboratory data fro m Site U1603 with small offsets between log and core data because of the assignment of core depth s when core recovery was not $100\%$ and other effects. Additionally, the APCT-3 was deployed fou r times in Hole U1603A and two times in Hole U1603F, and formation measurements were used t o derive a local geothermal gradient and heat flux.  

# 4.2. Site U1604  

# 4.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1604 (proposed Site MB-02C) is located on the lower slope below the Melville Bugt TMF a t a water depth of 1943.6 mbsl at $73^{\circ}06.9077^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $63^{\circ}47.3996^{\prime}\mathrm{W}\,16\,\mathrm{k}$ m northwest of Site U1603 (Figure F8). The site targeted a high-resolution sediment drift sequence hypothesized to represen t interactions between bottom contour currents and sediments supplied by NGrIS fluctuation s from the early/middle Pleistocene age (up to $1\ \mathrm{My},$ ) to present. The targeted sequence include s Seismic Units 8–11, especially focusing on an expanded interval of Seismic Unit 8, compared t o Site U1603. Seismic Units 8–11 represent the most recent stages in the developmental history o f the TMF. This site overlaps stratigraphically with the strata drilled at Site U1603. Accordingly, th e two deepwater sites share similar objectives (see Site U1603). With a deeper stratigraphic target, Site U1604 is particularly relevant for testing the hypothesis that the NGrIS underwent significan t deglaciation at intervals within the frequency range of orbital eccentricity $({\sim}100{-}400\ \mathrm{ky})$ an d assessing recent models for the change in orbital cycles through the MPT.  

Coring was planned in two holes with a target depth to $432\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in both holes using th e APC/XCB coring system. Downhole logging with the triple combo tool string, VSI, and FMS wa s planned for the second hole.  

# 4.2.2. Operations  

The vessel transited $16~\mathrm{nmi}$ from Site U1603 to Site U1604, arriving on location at $0306~\mathrm{h}$ on  3 September 2023. The thrusters were lowered and secured at $0324\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the ship was fully in D P mode at $0337\,\mathrm{h}$ . The rig crew made up an APC/XCB BHA and began tripping the drill pipe. Hol e U1604A was spudded at $1020~\mathrm{h}$ , and Core 400-U1604A-1H recovered $2.04~\mathrm{m}$ . The seafloor wa s calculated as 1942.2 mbsl. Cores $1\mathrm{H-}26\mathrm{H}$ advanced from 0 to $206.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and recovere d $195.34\;\mathrm{m}$ $(96\%)$ . Temperature measurements were made on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H.  

We switched to the HLAPC coring system; however, Core 27F only recovered $2.85\;\mathrm{m}$ after a partia l stroke. We then switched to the XCB coring system, and Cores 28X–30X advanced from 209.6 t o $233.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $23.71\;\mathrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ . At $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 September, ice moved within $3\,\mathrm{nmi}$ of the vessel, and we raised the drill string to $16.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A by $2045\,\mathrm{h}$ and began WOI. By $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ , the ice had moved a sufficient distance away from the vessel and we began to lower the drill strin g back into Hole U1604A.  

The drill string was lowered back into Hole U1604A and washed back to $233.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A by 010 0 on 5 September. Cores 31X–32X advanced from 233.0 to $250.6~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $11.05\mathrm{~m~}$ $(63\%)$ . At $0430~\mathrm{h}$ , ice moved within $3\ \mathrm{nmi}$ of the vessel, and we raised the drill string to $16.7~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A by $0545\,\mathrm{h}$ and began WOI. Ice then entered the $_{1\,\mathrm{nmi}}$ exclusion zone and we raised the dril l string, clearing the seafloor at $0715~\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1604A. The vessel was moved $700~\mathrm{m}$ nort h and then $700\;\mathrm{m}$ west to maintain a safe distance from the ice.  

By $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 September, we began to move back toward the site, and the vessel was in positio n over Hole U1604B ( $20\,\mathrm{m}$ northeast of Hole U1604A) by $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ . Hole U1604B was spudded at 175 5 $^{\mathrm{h,}}$ and the seafloor established as 1943.6 mbsl. Cores 400-U1604B-1H through 14H advanced fro m 0 to $105.3\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and recovered $98.14\mathrm{~m~}(93\%)$ . However, Core 14H only recovered $0.2\textrm{m}$ o f material. An XCB core barrel was dropped, and Core 15X advanced from 105.3 to $105.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A and recovered $0.22\textrm{m}$ of hard material. We then switched back to APC coring, and Cores 16H– 22H advanced from 105.5 to $163.1\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and recovered $59.68\mathrm{~m~}(103\%)$ . Cores 21H and 22 H were only partial strokes, so we switched to the HLAPC system for Core 23F, which advance d from 163.1 to $167.9\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and recovered $4.78\;\mathrm{m}\;(100\%)$ . We switched back to APC coring, an d Cores 24H–30H advanced from 167.9 to $216.8~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $49.87\mathrm{~m~}(102\%)$ . We the n switched to the HLAPC coring system, and Cores 31F–35F advanced from 216.8 to $237.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and recovered $16.89\,\mathrm{m}\,\left(83\%\right)$ . With ice still in the general area we decided to install a FFF t o allow us to complete coring and logging of the site in Hole U1604B. The FFF was deployed at 153 0 h on 7 September, and by $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ we resumed coring Hole U1604B. Cores 36X–55X advanced fro m 237.6 to $429.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $88.25\;\mathrm{m}\;(46\%)$ .  

Sepiolite (drilling mud) was swept in the hole and heavy barite mud was added in preparation fo r logging Hole U1604B. The drill string was tripped up, and the end of pipe was set at $58.7\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.

The quad combo tool string was rigged up by $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 September and deployed to the base o f Hole U1604B. Following a complete pass of the hole, the quad combo was pulled to the rig floo r and broken down. The FMS was then assembled and deployed at $0640\,\mathrm{h}$ . The FMS was run, an d the tools were back on deck by $1200~\mathrm{h}$ . With logging completed we tripped the pipe out of Hol e U1604B, clearing the rig floor at $^{1720\,\mathrm{h}}$ . The drill floor was secured for transit, and the thruster s were raised and secured for transit at $1824\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1604B and Site U1604.  

# 4.2.3. Principal results  

# 4.2.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The sediments recovered at Site U1604 are divided into three lithostratigraphic units with name d sedimentary lithofacies including massive mud, weakly stratified mud, calcareous mud, thinl y laminated mud, interlaminated sand and mud, and gravel-bearing sediment (Figure F9). Lithostratigraphic Unit I comprises the upper ${\sim}210\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A of this site, and all lithofacies are presen t in various proportions. Lithostratigraphic Unit I is divided into Lithostratigraphic Subunits IA an d

SHMSL point MS measurements filtered to exclude measurement s greater than one standard deviation from mean of all values (thin red line) and depth-based rolling mean of these value s with a $5\,\mathsf{m}$ window (thick red line). Higher MS values are typically associated with presence of silt, sand, and gravel. Lowe r MS values are typically associated with dominance of clay-sized particles and detrital carbonate layers. B. Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) RGB red minus blue values calculated by subtracting blue magnitude from red magnitude and subsequently filtered to exclude measurements greater than one standard deviation from mean of all values (thin blue line) an d depth-based rolling mean of these values with a $5\,\mathrm{m}$ window (thick blue line). Abrupt increases in red minus blue values ar e typically associated with detrital carbonate intervals, especially when accompanied by dip in NGR and MS values. C. Hol e U1604B SHIL RGB green values filtered to exclude measurements greater than one standard deviation from whole mea n (thin green line) and depth-based rolling mean of these values with a $5\;\mathrm{m}$ window (thick green line). Fluctuations in thi s value are meant to highlight changes in prevalence of green-tinted muds. D.

Bars are centered on core section.  

IB. Subunit IA is ${\sim}110\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and contains the massive mud, weakly stratified mud, and laminated mud lithofacies with interbeds of calcareous mud and gravel-bearing sediment. The underlying subunit, IB, has a larger proportion of interlaminated sand and mud and has relatively fewe r outsized clasts $(>\!2\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter). Lithostratigraphic Unit II is dominated by laminated mud an d diamicton, often occurring as decimeter-scale interbeds. The laminated mud lithofacies continue s to be characteristic downhole into Lithostratigraphic Unit III, which is characterized by a significant reduction in sand laminae and gravel-bearing sediment compared to Unit II. Overall, th e sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1604 is consistent with a glaciated continental slop e environment with inputs from a combination of hemipelagic, contour current, and rare downslope processes and likely ice rafting (providing granule- to boulder-sized clasts) and plumites.  

# 4.2.3.2. Micropaleontology  

Core catcher samples and additional split-core samples from the 32 cores of Hole U1604A and 2 1 of the cores from Hole U1604B were examined for foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, and othe r palynomorphs. A special sampling scheme involving catwalk samples from section ends an d freshly split cores was adopted to provide uncontaminated samples for sedaDNA from th e APC/HLAPC cores of Hole U1604B (through Core 400-U1604B-35F). Core catcher samples wer e not collected from the upper 35 cores of Hole U1604B because they represent a copy of the firs t ${\sim}240\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A of material cored in Hole U1604A. The additional samples were taken within intervals of muds and muds with dispersed clasts, avoiding interlaminated mud and sand lithologies. Mudline samples from Hole U1604A were also examined for microfossils. Observations of foraminifera from palynomorph and diatom slide preparations were integrated in the overall foraminifera evaluations. The muds and interlaminated sands and muds typical of Site U1604 are generall y barren of microfossils, apart from dinocysts, which are present but scarce throught the site, an d occasional horizons where rare to few microfossils are found among the clast-rich lithologies. Where foraminifera appear, they remain as trace to rare occurrences, except for a few discret e intervals where they are rare to common in ${>}63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ residues. Juvenile foraminifera were observe d in palynomorph $15\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieved preparations. Diatoms were found in ${\sim}5\%$ of all samples examine d with specimens presenting as fragments or few individuals. Palynomorph preparations reveale d generally low abundances of in situ dinocysts and varying abundances of reworked terrestrial an d marine palynomorphs. The observed microfossil specimens and assemblages for all groups ar e broadly consistent with a Pleistocene age. The observed taxa have long stratigraphic ranges an d thus provide limited age control. Specimens and assemblages of all groups are typical of coldwater polar environments.  

# 4.2.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements from Site U1604 were performed using the SRM t o investigate the NRM on a total of 389 archive-half sections (157 sections from Hole U1604A an d 91 sections from Hole U1604B). Measurements were not made on archive-half sections that ha d highly disturbed sediments or on core catcher sections. All measurements on section halves wer e made at $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals up to a peak AF demagnetization of $20~\mathrm{mT}.$ . A total of 248 discrete cub e samples were taken from the working-half sections. Discrete samples were measured on the SR M or the JR-6A spinner magnetometer. Generally, one sample per core section was collected, avoiding visually disturbed intervals and filling in gaps where the other hole did not have recovery. AR M was measured on a subset of 29 discrete samples from Hole U1604A. This subset of samples wa s demagnetized to $100~\mathrm{{mT}}$ on all three axes prior to measuring the remanence. An ARM wa s imparted with a peak $100~\mathrm{{mT}}$ AF and $50~\upmu\mathrm{T}$ direct current (DC) field, and the remanence wa s measured. Comparison of the ARM with volume-normalized bulk MS shows a quasilinear relationship between ARM and MS, suggesting that the concentration of magnetic minerals is the primary control on both measurements and supporting the use of normalized remanence fo r estimating relative paleointensity.  

# 4.2.3.4. Physical properties  

Physical property data were acquired on all cores from Holes U1604A and U1604B using th e WRMSL for wet bulk density from GRA, MS, and $P$ -wave velocity (PWL). We also measured NG R in all sections longer than $50\,\mathrm{cm}$ . Thermal conductivity was measured in one whole-round sectio n per core when possible from Hole U1604A and below $250\textrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1604B. Therma l conductivity was measured on the working-half sections if the sediment was too hard or th e whole-round measurement readings were unreliable. In the upper $250\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A of Hole U1604B, only NGR and low-resolution MS were logged. Cores 400-U1604B-1H through 35F constitute  a replica of Hole U1604A, so equilibration to room temperature and GRA measurements wer e avoided in the interest of stratigraphic correlation and sedaDNA sampling. Thus, PWL measurements were not made and the GRA source was kept inactive during WRMSL logging.  

Prominent variations in physical property values occur at similar depths in NGR, density, and M S and are associated with major lithologic changes in the cores. More uniform lithologies ar e reflected by more monotonous physical property signals. The correlation between these physica l properties distinguishes the four PP units (I–IV) of Site U1604. PP Unit I $\mathrm{(0{-}13\ m\,C S F{-}A)}$ is distinguished by increases in NGR, density, and MS that may be related to a decrease in water content below the mudline. Below, in PP Unit II (13–90 m CSF-A) high amplitude variability in NGR, density, and MS reflects broad variability in the lithology. Low values of NGR, density, and M S correlate with mud intervals, whereas intervals of interbedded mud and sand have higher NGR, density, and MS values. In PP Unit III ( $90{-}210\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), NGR, MS, and density increase slightl y downhole within the unit. The low variability of these physical properties in PP Unit III is within  a sand dominated lithology, and minimum MS and NGR values in the unit correlate to intervals o f mud. PP Unit IV (210–420 m CSF-A) is defined by low amplitude variability of NGR, MS, an d density, which all slightly decrease downhole within the unit, which corresponds to a lithologi c transition from mud to sand layers interbedded with diamicton.  

# 4.2.3.5. Geochemistry  

Samples for headspace gas, IW chemistry, and bulk sediment geochemistry were analyzed at Sit e U1604. Headspace hydrocarbon gas concentrations are low in the upper $200\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , and highe r concentrations of methane, with a low yet consistent presence of ethane, are present in sedimen t below $200\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ . The main findings from IW analysis include decreases in lithium and potassium with depth. A monotonic decrease in sulfate with depth to a minimum at ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF- A provides evidence for a sulfate–methane transition zone. IW iron, manganese, and phosphate concentrations are elevated near the seafloor and sharply decrease to low concentrations with dept h (below ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). Increases in IW calcium and alkalinity in the upper ${\sim}25\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ma y indicate dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals. Elemental analysis of solid material reveale d overall low concentrations of carbon and nitrogen across most intervals, albeit individual layer s were rich in $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ with contents of up to $60\%$ .  

# 4.2.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

Sequences from Hole U1604A were examined using NGR data measured on $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals an d whole-round MS measured at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution with the WRMSL. In addition, $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ interval NG R data and $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution MS data were measured on sections from Hole U1604B and examined i n near-real time to ensure adequate coring depths to fill the gaps in Hole U1604A. Because tripl e APC offset coring was not planned at Site U1604, a splice for this site was not completed. Recover y gaps commonly overlap between Holes U1604A and U1604B. The difficulty was further magnifie d by deformation related to XCB coring. Thus, Holes U1604A and U1604B were correlated to th e extent possible, but they were mostly aligned based on the mudline.  

The top of Hole U1604A (which preserved a mudline) served as the anchor (zero depth point) fo r the generation of the CCSF-A depth scale at this site. From this reference, the relative core depth s were determined by establishing depth offsets, or affine ties, between cores from the two hole s based on optimized correlation of WRMSL-derived MS and NGR data. The upper part of th e sequence is tied through Cores 400-U1604A-1H to 400-U1604B-2H, Cores 400-U1604A-3H t o 400-U1604A-6H, and Cores 400-U1604A-7H to 400-U1604B-10H. Below, the cores are placed o n a relative depth to each other. Core disturbances, shattered core liners, and other issues impactin g core quality meant that the stratigraphic coherence of the recovered sequence was variable. Belo w 223 m CSF-A in Hole U1604A, NGR and MS are less coherent, which makes the stratigraphi c correlation of the lowermost overlapping section dubious. In summary, it is not possible to build  a complete CCSF-A depth scale for Site U1604. The high recovery and core alignment betwee n Holes U1604A and U1604B allows for the construction of a preliminary CCSF-A depth scale, bu t the gaps between cores are unknown. Downhole logging data was used to improve the depth accuracy of these cores.  

# 4.2.3.7. Age model  

The age model for Site U1604 is based on magnetostratigraphic interpretations of Holes U1604 A and U1604B. The upper ${\sim}138\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ of sediment is characterized by normal polarity (Zone N1 ) and is interpreted to be the Brunhes Chron (C1n; 0–0.773 Ma; Ogg, 2020). From this identification, we estimate an average sediment accumulation rate of ${\sim}17\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the Brunhes Chron. In addition, within the Brunhes Chron there are a number of decreases in relative paleointensit y (DIPs). DIPs are calculated from the normalized remanence $\mathrm{(NRM_{20mT})}$ divided by MS. Seve n well-defined DIPs in the Site U1604 relative paleointensity record correlate well with the Paleomagnetic Dipole Moment for the last 2 My (PADM2M) constructed by Ziegler et al. (2011). Usin g the PADM2M tie points, it is possible to predict where the MISs of the LR04 stack of Lisiecki an d Raymo (2005) are at Site U1604.  

The age model below ${\sim}138\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ is based on the inclinations. The normal polarity zone belo w $245\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hole U1604B (Zone N2) is not well constrained because of gaps in recovery an d drilling disturbance. However, the best supported identification of this reversal is with the Jaramillo Subchron (C1r.1n at $0.99\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ; Ogg, 2020). If this scenario is correct, the average sedimen t accumulation rate from the base of the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary to the top of the Jaramillo i s $34\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . From the paleomagnetic constraints described above, a preliminary age-depth model i s constructed where the sediment accumulation rates are $17\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ for the Brunhes Chron interva l and $34\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ below. The coarse biostratigraphic constraints provided by dinocysts and sporadi c foraminifera and diatom occurrences in Holes U1604A and U1604B are consistent with this interpretation of the magnetostratigraphy.  

# 4.2.3.8. Downhole measurements  

Downhole logging was carried out in Hole U1604B upon completion of the coring operations.  A modified triple combo tool string was deployed with MSS, natural gamma ray, electrical laterolo g resistivity, acoustic velocity, and density tools. Three runs (a down pass, repeat, and a main pass ) were carried out covering almost the full length of the open hole below the pipe $\mathrm{^{\left(427.6\m\CSF-A;\right.}}$ $2\,\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom of the hole). The repeat (or calibration run) logged the deepest $100\,\mathrm{m}$ of th e hole. The caliper showed a relatively stable hole with frequent washouts, and the instrument s yielded reliable measurements that were used in the core-log-seismic correlation of this site.  

Upon completion of downhole logging with the modified triple combo, the FMS (without sonic ) was lowered downhole. Three runs (a down pass plus two up passes) were completed. On th e down passes, only the gamma ray was measured because the caliper of the FMS was closed. Th e FMS resulted in a high-quality resistivity image of Hole U1604B.  

Logging measurements were crucial for covering recovery gaps. Core logging and downhole logging results differ in absolute values, but the relative trends of the logs are comparable. Hence, logging data could be used for correlation purposes and for covering the formation recovery gap s with confidence. Additionally, the APCT-3 tool was deployed four times in Hole U1604A.  

# 4.3. Site U1605  

# 4.3.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1605 (proposed Site MB-31A) is located at $73^{\circ}33.6421^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $62^{\circ}09.0687^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at a water depth o f 529 mbsl on the outer shelf of the northwest Greenland shelf margin (Figure F10). Constrained b y high-quality seismic data, the objective was to recover potential marine intervals within package s of horizontal, semicontinuous reflections that aggrade over glacial unconformities within topse t strata of the Melville Bugt TMF (Knutz et al., 2019). Site U1605 captures Seismic Units 7–10 wit h a target depth just below Seismic Horizon 6, corresponding to $282~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (based on averag e $P$ -wave velocity of $2200\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ) (Figure F10). The sequence, considered to be mainly of early middl e Pleistocene age, overlaps stratigraphically with deepwater Sites U1603 and U1604. The primar y lithology was assumed to be compacted diamicton with intervals of sand and pebbly mud, representing marine to glaciomarine deposits, intersected by at least four glacial unconformities. Th e scientific objectives for drilling Site U1605 are complementary to deepwater Sites U1603 an d U1604 but with an emphasis on testing the hypothesis that the NGrIS underwent significan t deglaciation potentially related to exceptionally warm or prolonged super-interglacials (Schaefe r et al. 2016; Christ et al., 2023). Additionally, multiproxy data from Site U1605 can be used to asses s the regolith hypothesis for the change in orbital insolation frequency across the MPT (Clark an d Pollard, 1998).  

Coring was planned in two holes with a target depth of $282\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in the first hole using RC B coring and then logging with the triple combo and FMS-sonic. The plan for the second hole was t o drill ahead to $70\;\mathrm{{m}}$ CSF-A followed by APC/HLAPC/XCB coring to $282\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ .  

# 4.3.2. Operations  

The vessel transited $39\ \mathrm{nmi}$ from Site U1604 to Site U1605, arriving on location at $2200~\mathrm{h}$ on  9 September 2023. After we observed that ice was a sufficient distance away from the vessel, th e thrusters were lowered and secured at $2224\ \mathrm{h}$ , and the ship was fully in DP mode at $2229\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . A n RCB BHA was made up and tripped down. We initially attempted to spud Hole U1605A based o n a water depth of 524.1 mbsl. Following a $3\textrm{m}$ advance, the core barrel returned empty. The pip e was lowered, and Hole U1605A was spudded at $0340\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 September and recovered $3.2\,\mathrm{m}$ fro m an $8.0\textrm{m}$ advance. The seafloor was established as 528.66 mbsl. Cores 400-U1605A-1R throug h 47R advanced from 0 to $282~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $38.45~\mathrm{m}$ $(13.6\%)$ . We then began pulling th e drill string out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $1535~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September. The drill string wa s tripped up, with the bit at the surface at $1720~\mathrm{h}$ . The drill floor was secured for transit, and th e thrusters were raised and secured for transit at $1748\;\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1605A and Site U1605. Th e rate of penetration at Site U1605 was highly variable $(0.16{-}28.8\;\mathrm{m/h})$ and averaged $4.56\;\mathrm{m/h}$ .

# 4.3.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Because of low recovery, reporting of lithostratigraphy and depositional history is limited at Sit e U1605. Magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy were restricted by discontinuous sampling an d require further interpretation. The recovered sediment is tentatively interpreted to be Pleistocen e based on seismic stratigraphic constraints.  

The stratigraphy of Site U1605 is summarized as one lithostratigraphic unit comprising two subunits (Lithostratigraphic Subunits IA and IB; younger to older) (Figure F11). Named sedimentar y lithofacies include massive diamicton and stratified diamicton. A significant proportion of cor e recovered contained “washed gravel” (a form of core disturbance) with lithologies consistent wit h clasts present in the diamicton. Of the ${\sim}13\%$ recovered, ${\sim}8\%$ ( ${\sim}23\;\mathrm{m}$ cumulative) is diamicton wit h the remaining ${\sim}5\%$ made up of washed gravel. Subunit IA contains the upper ${\sim}83\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and i s composed of massive diamicton and gravel clasts (washed gravel) that are retained in the cor e barrel when finer unconsolidated sediment washed out during drilling. Subunit IB extends fro m 83 to 275.1 m CSF-A (deepest recovery) and consists of massive diamicton, stratified diamicton, and washed gravel.  

# 4.3.3.2. Micropaleontology  

Recovery was consistently poor, and many cores did not produce core catcher sediment samples. Where sediment was recovered, core catcher samples were composed of diamicton. Despite th e indurated nature of the diamicton, the material disaggregated relatively easily. A total of 12 cor e catcher samples from the 47 cores of Hole U1605A and 1 mudline sample were prepared an d examined for foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, and other palynomorphs. The samples were largel y barren of foraminifera and diatoms. Diatoms were visually barren in the majority of samples, except in the mudline sample, which contained rare, poorly preserved diatoms typical of moder n Arctic marine environments. Dinocysts and other palynomorphs, including Leisopheres (a grou p of acritarchs), were observed in multiple samples. A mudline sample $\left(\sim\!10\ g\right)$ was collected as  a modern DNA reference in Hole U1605A. No samples were collected for sedaDNA analysis.

Figure F11. Lithostratigraphic summary, Site U1605. Because of discontinuous core recovery, this figure emphasizes measurements from discrete recovered intervals, instead of downcore trends emphasized for other sites. Changes in physica l properties did not appear to correlate to lithologic changes. Prior to plotting, (A) SHMSL point MS and (B) Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) RGB data were filtered to exclude measurements greater than one standard deviation from whole mea n with the intention of excluding most pebbles, cobbles, or boulders and making the plot more representative of recovere d diamicton intervals; (C) NGR data were not filtered prior to plotting. Red minus blue values were calculated by subtractin g blue magnitude from red magnitude. Light colored dots $=$ individual filtered measurements. Box plots are at median dept h of represented population, showing interquartile range (box), median (thick black line), and whiskers extend to 1.5 time s interquartile values. Transparent, amorphous shapes around box plots are violin plots of the same data, whose relativ e thicknesses at any x value shows relatively likelihood (kernel density estimate) of a member of the population occurring a t that value.  

# 4.3.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Recovery from Site U1605 was poor, containing many barrels of washed gravel. However, wher e cohesive diamicton was present, paleomagnetic measurements were made on the archive halve s with the SRM and on discrete samples from the working halves, either cut using a parallel saw o r collected using J-cubes. The 11 discrete samples were measured after stepwise demagnetizatio n up to $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization. Magnetic fabric assessed by anisotropic magnetic susceptibility indicated some potential disturbance of the sedimentary fabric. NRM and the remanenc e after 10 and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization were measured on 16 archive-half sections wher e diamicton was continuous for at least $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . Careful filtering of the data for section end effect s and/or other disturbances revealed an inclination change from steeply downward direction s consistent with normal polarity at $217\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to steeply upward directed below $217~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, consistent with reversed polarity.  

# 4.3.3.4. Physical properties  

Standard physical property measurements were made on cores from Site U1605 using th e WRMSL, SHMSL, and Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL) track instruments. Discret e measurements were also made for MAD analysis, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity o n the PWC system. Because of the low recovery and highly disturbed cored material, PWL measurements were unreliable. PWC was limited to diamictic intervals because values of isolated clasts ar e not representative of the formation.  

Prominent variations in physical property values occur at similar depths in NGR, density, and M S and are associated with major lithologic changes in the cores; however, the low recovery at this sit e prevents much interpretation of physical properties. Four PP units (I–IV) are identified at Sit e U1605. In PP Unit I $(0{-}80\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ ), NGR, density, and MS all decrease gradually downhol e through the unit, which may be related to a transition from the mudline to clast-rich diamicto n and gravel. PP Unit II (80–125 m CSF-A) is identified by a sharp increase in density values, combined with a more gradual increase in NGR and MS indicative of the intervals of diamict an d gravel lithologies of the unit. Below, in PP Unit III ( $125{-}175\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) NGR, MS, and densit y values are relatively low but have higher amplitude variability, likely due to the gravel presen t within this unit. PP Unit IV (175–282 m CSF-A) is composed of diamicton with some gravel an d has relatively higher NGR, MS, and density values than PP Unit III. Core-log-seismic correlatio n was based on the average PWC obtained on the diamictic recovered intervals and weighted wit h gravel intervals based on the recovered lithologies.  

# 4.3.3.5. Geochemistry  

Whole-round core samples were processed for IW and headspace (HS) void gas samples wer e measured at Site U1605; however, the frequency of these samples was limited by the availability o f sediment. HS measurements show low concentrations of hydrocarbons in the upper $130\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ and increasing concentrations at depth, with a low yet consistent presence of ethane below $^{180}\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Although low recovery and sporadic sampling led to a discontinuous pore water record, the main findings from IW analysis include decreases in lithium and potassium with depth.  A monotonic decrease in sulfate with depth to a minimum around $190\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ provides evidenc e for a sulfate–methane transition zone. IW iron, manganese, and phosphate show elevated concentrations near the seafloor and sharp decreases to low concentrations with depth. Increases in calcium and alkalinity in the upper ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A are also observed. Elemental analysis of soli d material revealed very low concentrations of carbon and nitrogen throughout the hole.  

# 4.4. Site U1606  

# 4.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1606 (proposed Site MB-17A) is located at $74^{\circ}13.9380^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{:}$ , $61^{\circ}2.2426^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at a water depth of 653 mbsl on the middle section of the northwest Greenland shelf (Figure F3). The site targets the transition from preglacial contourite drift sediments into glacigenic deposits of earliest TMF progradation (Seismic Unit 1), marking the first advance of the NGrIS onto the continental margin. The drilling target was at $411\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A near the base of Megaunit B above Horizon c1 (Figure F12), coring a succession that is complementary to Site U1608. The uppermost $180\,\textrm{m}$ at Site U1606 aimed to capture a stratigraphic record of the preglacial to glacial transition that hypothetically corresponds to the Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary (Knutz et al., 2019). Below $150{-}180\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, Site U1606 targeted a $200\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary unit characterized internally by a uniform bundle of tilting strata that converges updip against an erosional scarp defined by Horizon c1 (Figure F12). The seismic geometries imply accumulation of sedimentary drift deposits over a significantly truncated section of Megaunit C (Knutz et al., 2015).  

The expected lithologies are gravel-sand, diamicton, and pebbly mud in the upper $40\textrm{m}$ CSF-A and mudstone with silty-sandy intervals in the succession below. The seismic characteristics suggest a gradual transition from a deep marine (outer shelf) to a more nearshore environment, eventually replaced by a proglacial setting.

Regional seismic Horizon (Hz) b1 is indicated together with internal horizons (green, pink, blue) that connect Site U1606 with Site U1608 (see Figure F16). Correlation to seismic megaunits is also shown. Vertical scale on Hole U1606A– U1606D lines are meter depth based on preferred time-depth model. ${\mathsf{S P}}=$ shotpoint, TWT $=$ two-way traveltime, ${\sf M T D}=$ mass transport deposit. Bottom: close-up bathymetry map with seismic survey lines in vicinity of Site U1606. Gray line grid $=$ regional 2-D seismic data (TGS), black line grid $=$ high-resolution multichannel seismic data (LAKO19).  

There are two principal goals for this site: (1) capture deposits corresponding to the earliest shelfbased glaciations in northwest Greenland (earliest glacial clinoforms of Megaunit A) an d (2) recover Neogene sediments of likely Pliocene age in Megaunit B that can elucidate paleoceanographic conditions prior to the major expansion of the GrIS (Knutz et al., 2015). Hypothetically, the contourite drift may provide a marine analog to terrestrial outcrops (e.g., Beaufort and Ka p Kobenhavn formations), depicting warm climate conditions in the High Arctic during the lat e Pliocene to early Pleistocene (Gosse et al., 2017).  

Planned drilling at Site U1606 included coring with the RCB system from the seafloor to $411\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in the first hole. If intervals of special interest (e.g., marine mud) were encountered, a second hole would be attempted by washing down followed by coring using the APC system. Downhole logging was planned for the first hole, including the triple combo tool string, FMS, and VS I check shots.  

# 4.4.2. Operations  

The vessel transited $44\mathrm{\nmi}$ from Site U1605 to Site U1606. The thrusters were lowered an d secured, and the ship was fully in DP mode at $2200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September 2023. Ice monitoring began, and the vessel made the final approach to the site slowly as ice vacated the area. The rig crew mad e up an RCB BHA in preparation for Hole U1606A, and the drill string was partially lowered whil e we waited on ice to clear the site. By $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September, we positioned the vessel over th e site, and Hole U1606A was spudded at $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ . Cores 400-U1606A-1R through 20R advanced fro m 0 to $182.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $30.14\;\mathrm{m}\;(16\%)$ . At $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September, ice moved within  3 nmi of the vessel, and we raised the drill string to $24.6\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ by $1215\,\mathrm{h}$ . The ice was slow moving (nearly stationary) and was expected to linger over the site for more than a day while movin g closer to the vessel. The decision was made to pull out of Hole U1606A and move to proposed Sit e MB-07B (Site U1607). The drill string was tripped up, with the bit at the surface at $1424~\mathrm{h}$ . Th e drill floor was secured for transit, and the thrusters were raised and secured for transit at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The vessel transited the $6.6\;\mathrm{nmi}$ from Site U1608 back to Site U1606 on 30 September and arrive d at $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ . The thrusters were lowered and secured, and the ship was fully in DP mode at $1738\,\mathrm{h}$ . The rig crew made up an RCB BHA, and the drill string was tripped to near the seafloor. Hol e U1606B was spudded at $2125\,\mathrm{h}$ , tagging the seafloor at $656.4\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ . Cores 400-U1606B-1R throug h 39R advanced from 0.0 to $350.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $164.44\;\mathrm{m}$ $(47\%)$ . We tripped the pipe ou t of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0110\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 October, ending Hole U1606B.  

The vessel was offset south-southwest of Hole U1606B, and Hole U1606C was spudded at $0245\,\mathrm{h}$ . The hole was drilled ahead to $25\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ before removing the center bit and dropping an RC B core barrel. Cores 400-U1606C-2R through 18R advanced from 25.0 to $186.7\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $45.31\;\mathrm{m}$ $(28\%)$ . We tripped the pipe out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0355\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 October, ending Hole U1606C.  

The vessel was offset south-southwest of Hole U1606A, and Hole U1606D was spudded at $0625\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 October. The hole was drilled ahead to $13.6~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A before removing the center bit an d dropping an RCB core barrel. Cores 400-U1606D-2R through 14R advanced from 13.6 to $132.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $7.83\mathrm{~m~}(7\%)$ . We then tripped the pipe out of Hole U1606D, clearing the ri g floor at $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 October. The drill floor was secured for transit, and the thrusters were raise d and secured for transit at $1206\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1606D and Site U1606.  

# 4.4.3. Principal results  

# 4.4.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The stratigraphy of Site U1606 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units (Figure F13). Sit e U1606 was drilled along a ${\sim}1.3~\mathrm{km}$ long southwest to northeast transect and targeted seismi c stratigraphic packages with varying thicknesses in each hole; therefore, the lithostratigraphic unit s are not laterally continuous and at some sites are not present as a result of stratal pinch-out (Figur e F12). Named sedimentary lithofacies include (1) laminated or bioturbated mud with or withou t dispersed sand; (2) calcareous mud and sand; (3) stratified or bioturbated sandy mud with an d without dispersed clasts; (4) stratified or bioturbated muddy sand and sand, with and withou t dispersed clasts; (5) interlaminated to interbedded sand and mud; and (6) muddy coarse sand, diamicton, and intraclast conglomerate.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I was recovered in Holes U1606A and U1606B and contains unlithifie d brown mud to sandy mud, overlying Lithostratigraphic Unit II of sandy diamicton ranging fro m clast poor to clast rich, also recovered only in Holes U1606A and U1606B. Lithostratigraphic Uni t III is formed of sandy mud and muddy sand with dispersed clasts and has two subunits distinguished by the degree of bioturbation and stratification. Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIA was recovered in all holes at Site U1606 and contains weakly to strongly stratified sandy mud and mudd y sand with dispersed clasts. Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIB is identified only in Holes U1606A an d U1606C and is characterized as moderately bioturbated stratified sandy mud to muddy sand wit h dispersed clasts. Lithostratigraphic Unit IV is defined by alternating bioturbated mud and sand y mud (Lithostratigraphic Subunits IVA and IVC) with interbedded mud and sand (Lithostratigraphic Subunits IVB and IVD). Subunit IVA is present in both Holes U1606B and U1606C, whereas Subunits IVB–IVD are only present in Hole U1606B. Overall, the sedimentary successio n collected at Site U1606 is consistent with an ice-proximal, subglacial or proglacial glaciomarin e depositional environment with highly variable periods of potential bottom-current reworking.  

# 4.4.3.2. Micropaleontology  

Core catcher samples and additional split-core samples from Holes U1606A and U1606B wer e examined for foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, and other palynomorphs. Holes U1606C an d U1606D were low recovery and considered duplicate copies and thus were not sampled routinel y shipboard for biostratigraphic purposes, apart from two test samples for diatom analysis. Subsequent examination of the cores from all holes suggests considerable lithostratigraphic difference s that might warrant full paleontological study in the future. The additional samples from workinghalf sections were taken in the upper $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A of soft, soupy muds of Core 400-U1606A-1R t o provide Holocene reference assemblages. Mudline samples from Hole U1606A were also examined. Samples for sedaDNA were collected in Hole U1606B.  

The sandy muds and muddy sands, with variable clast contributions, typical of Hole U1606A contain sparse but reasonably well-preserved calcareous microfossils. Where foraminifera appear, only benthic species occur and these remain as trace to rare occurrences, except for Sample 400-  

![](images/9d6147b65f13d4ccb6e68423e84c73a6fe9d26e367c1e5afffcad36c3034e899.jpg)

U1606A-11R-CC-PAL $\mathrm{\left({\sim}94\ m\ C S F{-}A\right)}$ ) where benthic species are rare to common in the ${>}63~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ residue. The benthic foraminifera containing interval from Cores 400-U1606A-10R to 13R (84.51– $112.65\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ is consistent with an age older than $700\;\mathrm{ka}$ . Diatoms were observed in ${\sim}52\%$ o f all samples examined with poor to moderate preservation. The diatom assemblages observed ar e consistent a with Pliocene age and signify Atlantic water influence at Site U1606. The dinocys t assemblages downhole to ${\sim}84\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A are indicative of a Pleistocene or younger age. In Hole s U1606A and U1606B, reworked late Pliocene dinocysts are present. The assemblages of Hol e U1606B are consistent with a Pleistocene to Pliocene age. Palynomorph preparations reveale d varying abundances of in situ dinocysts and reworked terrestrial palynomorphs. The observe d microfossil assemblages are typical of cold-water Arctic environments. Other fossil component s observed include bivalve mollusk shell fragments, pieces of terrestrial wood and plants, and fragments of an encrusting bryozoan implying abundant marine life on the Greenland shelf.  

# 4.4.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements from Site U1606 were performed using the SRM t o investigate the remanent magnetization on a total of 182 archive-half sections. Measurement s were not made on core catcher sections or those that were heavily disturbed. All measurements o n archive-half sections were made at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals, up to a peak AF demagnetization of $20~\mathrm{mT}$ .  A total of 144 discrete cube samples were taken from working-half sections. Generally, we collecte d one sample per core section, avoiding visually disturbed intervals, using the parallel saw. Of th e discrete samples, 123 were measured on the SRM and stepwise demagnetized up to $40~\mathrm{mT}$ . Th e inclinations from the filtered $20~\mathrm{mT}$ step archive half data are generally bimodal, with a muc h larger fraction of reversed polarity measurements. Magnetostratigraphy at Site U1606 is highl y uncertain, and correlation between holes is complicated by prominent lateral changes in the sedimentary units, reflected in the seismic stratigraphy.  

# 4.4.3.4. Physical properties  

Standard physical property measurements were made on cores from Site U1606 using th e WRMSL, SHMSL, and NGRL track instruments. Discrete measurements were also made fo r MAD analysis, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity on the PWC system. Because of the lo w recovery and highly disturbed cored material, PWL measurements were unreliable. PWC was limited to diamictic intervals because values of isolated clasts are not representative of the formation.  

Prominent variations in physical property values occur at similar depths in NGR and MS and ar e associated with major lithologic changes in the cores; however, the abundant low recovery intervals of this site produce a highly fragmented record of physical properties. A positive correlation i s found between NGR counts and MS at Site U1606, and the correlation between these physica l properties distinguishes six PP units (I–VI) at Site U1606. In PP Unit I $_{\mathrm{0-170~m}}$ CSF-A), onl y scattered values related to low recovery were obtained and no trends are discernable. Below, in P P Unit II (170–197 m CSF-A) NGR increases downhole and MS values decrease, corresponding t o the transition from mud to muddy sand within the unit. Density values remain relatively constan t across PP Unit II. PP Unit III (197–250 m CSF-A) is characterized by a decrease in NGR downhole, an increase in MS values, and relatively constant density values. The upper half of PP Unit I V (250–290 m CSF-A) is dominated by interlaminated sand and mud that transitions to sandy mu d in the lower half of the unit. NGR increases downhole in the upper part of PP Unit IV before  a sharp decrease to minimum values in the lower part of the unit. Changes in MS and density in P P Unit IV are less pronounced, with MS gradually increasing and density gradually decreasin g downhole within the unit. PP Unit V (290–335 m CSF-A) is defined by an increase downhole i n MS throughout the unit, which is composed of mud and sandy mud. NGR and density remai n relatively constant throughout the unit. PP Unit VI $335{-}350\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A})$ is composed primarily o f muddy sand, with the percentage of sand increasing downhole within the unit. The top of PP Uni t VI is marked by a sharp increase in NGR and density and a decrease in MS. Core-log-seismic correlation at Site U1606 was achieved through implementation of a synthetic seismogram from th e WRMSL density values obtained in Hole U1606B. The obtained interval velocities were late r applied to Holes U1606A, U1606C, and U1606D with local variations based on lithologic changes.  

# 4.4.3.5. Geochemistry  

Samples for headspace gas, IW chemistry, and bulk sediment geochemistry were analyzed at Sit e U1606, primarily in Holes U1606A and U1606B. Headspace hydrocarbon gas measurement s showed low concentrations in the upper $10\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ of Holes U1606A and U1606B, and belo w this high concentrations of methane are present to the bottom of Holes U1606A, U1606B, an d U1606D (up to 87,400 ppmv). The main findings from IW analysis include low salinity measurements (as low as 12) between approximately 20 and $^{140}\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Gradual downhole increases i n salinity, sodium, chloride, and bromide occur below approximately $150\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Elemental analysis of solid material revealed average concentrations of $0.36\%$ organic carbon and $0.05\%$ nitroge n throughout Holes U1606A and U1606B.  

# 4.4.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

Because of low recovery and the large distance between the holes at Site U1606, the standard procedure for stratigraphic correlation could not be implemented. Physical property data, includin g NGR and MS, from all holes at Site U1606 were imported and examined in Correlator v.4. Al l cores from Site U1606 were cored with the RCB system and thus gaps and missing intervals wer e expected. Core disturbances, cores pumped from the liners, and other issues impacting on cor e quality meant that the stratigraphic coherence of the recovered sequence was variable. Recover y gaps commonly overlap between all holes of Site U1606 in the upper $^{180\;\mathrm{m}}$ CSF-A of the record, and only Hole U1606B significantly penetrates below this depth.  

Further efforts were made to correlate the record of each hole with the seismic stratigraphy of th e area. Physical properties and paleomagnetism, together with biostratigraphic and lithologic constraints were taken into consideration, and a core-log-seismic correlation was constructed. Despite the uncertainties on the absolute depths, this model provides a means for the furthe r investigation of the Site U1606 record across all holes.  

# 4.5. Site U1607  

# 4.5.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1607 (proposed Site MB-07B), the easternmost site in the Expedition 400 site transect, i s located at $74^{\circ}29.5499^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $60^{\circ}34.9900^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at a water depth of $739\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ on the middle shelf landwar d of the Melville Bay Ridge (Figure F14). Extensive seismic and limited borehole data indicate tha t this site captures Megaunits C, D1, and D2, interpreted to be a late–middle Miocene sedimen t drift that overlies a succession of mainly hemipelagic strata, possibly of early Miocene to Oligocene age (Knutz et al., 2022) (Figure F14). Accordingly, Site U1607 may capture the time perio d from 6 to $30\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The sediment sequence comprising seismic Megaunits D1 and D2 represents gradual infilling o f the remnant rift basin topography, comprising the Melville Bay Graben (MBG) and adjacent ridg e complex. The MBG was formed during an Early Cretaceous phase of continental rifting and ende d during the early Paleocene as active seafloor spreading commenced in Baffin Bay (e.g., Gregerse n et al., 2022). The overlying seismic Megaunit C is interpreted to be a shelf-based sediment drif t receiving fine clastic input from nearby prodeltaic environments (Knutz et al., 2015). The boundary between Megaunits D2 and C is described as the mid-Miocene Unconformity (Hz d1). I t occurs within a conformable sequence in the basin but is shown as an erosional feature on th e adjacent structural highs. Two seismic unconformities, corresponding to regional horizons (Hz c 1 and b1), are seen near to the top of the sequence. By correlating the seismic profile farther southward it becomes evident that part of Megaunit C has been removed by erosion (Knutz et al., 2015). Thus, apart from the seabed itself, some degree of hiatus development may be assigned to Hz c1 o r d1. Based on the reflection strength, Hz b1 appears more prominently as an erosional unconformity.  

The goal at Site U1607 is to reconstruct past ocean and terrestrial climates in northeastern Baffi n Bay and on Greenland, including testing the hypothesis that decreasing atmospheric ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ from th e middle Oligocene to early Miocene is linked to the onset of ephemeral glaciation in northwes t Greenland (Scientific Objective 2). Additionally, the site may provide core data that can investigat e the influence of Neogene tectonic adjustments on the sediment record (Scientific Objective 3).  

The expected lithology is claystone with silty to sandy intervals and siliceous ooze, consistent wit h predicted hemipelagic marine environments.  

# 4.5.2. Operations  

The vessel transited $17\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ from Site U1606 to Site U1607. The thrusters were lowered an d secured, and the ship was fully in DP mode at $1707\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September 2023. The rig crew made u p an RCB BHA, and the drill string was tripped to near the seafloor. Hole U1607A was spudded a t $2225\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ tagging the seafloor at 738.6 mbsl.  

Cores 400-U1607A-1R through 60R advanced from 0 to $566.3~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $470.47\mathrm{~m~}$ $(83\%)$ . On 20 September, we began a bit change $\cdot^{70\,\mathrm{h}}$ on bit). The pipe was raised to $53.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and a FFF was deployed at $1542~\mathrm{h}$ . The subsea camera system was then deployed at $1652~\mathrm{h}$ t o observe that the FFF had landed in position and ensure a clean exit from Hole U1607A. The bi t cleared the seafloor at $1753~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and the subsea camera system was back on board by $1834~\mathrm{h}$ . Th e drill string was then tripped up, with the bit at the surface at 2037 h. An RCB BHA was made u p with a new C-4 bit, and the drill string was tripped back to the seafloor. The subsea camera syste m was deployed at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ , and Hole U1607A was reentered at $0042\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 September. The subse a camera was back on board at $0130~\mathrm{h}$ . The drill string was lowered to $516.7\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, and w e washed back down to $566.3~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Cores 61R–103R advanced from 566.3 to $978.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF- A and recovered $282.38\;\mathrm{m}$ $(68\%)$ .

Sepiolite (drilling mud) was swept in the hole, and the bit was released at $1940\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 Septembe r to prepare for logging. The hole was displaced with heavy mud (barite), and the end of pipe wa s raised to $59.6~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The modified triple combo tool string was deployed to the base of Hol e U1607A, and at $938\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A ( ${40}\,\mathrm{m}$ from the bottom of the hole) a hard contact was encountered. The drill pipe was raised to $42.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A for the main pass. Following a complete pass of the hole, the modified triple combo was pulled up to the rig floor and broken down. The VSI was rigged up, and the protected species watch began at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 September. The VSI was deployed to $930\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and stations were measured every $30\;\mathrm{m}$ uphole until $1715\;\mathrm{h},$ at which time the protecte d species watch also concluded. The VSI was brought back on board, and with logging completed w e tripped the pipe out of Hole U1607A, clearing the rig floor at $2111\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . The drill floor was secure d for transit, and the thrusters were raised and secured for transit at $2124\;\mathrm{h},$ , ending Hole U1607 A and Site U1607.  

# 4.5.3. Principal results  

# 4.5.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The stratigraphy of Site U1607 is divided into five lithostratigraphic units with subunits (Figur e F15). Some of the named sedimentary lithofacies are present in all units with variable prominence, whereas others are characteristic of a particular unit. The lithofacies include (1) mud, sandy mud, and muddy sand with dispersed clasts; (2) calcareous mud; (3) bioturbated sandy mud and mudd y sand; and (4) glauconite-rich sandy mud, muddy sand, and sandy granule conglomerate.  

![](images/0a0c492038229b8d068b6dfe2695124dec02df2ac1401124be81c0ae37e13df5.jpg)  
Figure F14 (continued).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I contains the upper $3.58\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ of the site and consists of unlithified, soupy mud that likely represents Holocene deposition. Lithostratigraphic Unit II, extending fro m 3.58 to $434.72\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, contains bioturbated mud, sandy mud, muddy sand, calcareous mud, an d dispersed clasts. This unit is divided into four subunits, IIA–IID, broadly following a downcor e coarsening of sediment (mud to sand) and a decrease in dispersed clasts. Subunit IIA is $53.49\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and contains meter-scale beds of bioturbated mud, sandy mud, and muddy sand with dispersed clasts and a few beds of cemented calcareous mud. The underlying Subunit IIB is $136.68\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, and it is lithologically similar to Subunit IIA, distinguished by a color change from greenis h gray to grayish brown, the first appearance downhole of iron sulfide filled burrows, and commo n beds of cemented calcareous mud. Alternating mud and sandy mud to muddy sand lithologies o n a decimeter scale is associated with Subunit IIC, which is $157.55\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, and represents a n increase in the abundance of sand. Calcareous mud remains common, but a significant reductio n in the occurrence of dark fine-grained iron sulfide–filled burrows and a decrease in disperse d clasts occurs within Subunit IIC. Subunit IID $83.42\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) is distinguished from overlying Subunit IIC by an increasing dominance of sand lithologies, a decrease in calcareous mud and carbonate cemented intervals, and rare occurrence of dispersed clasts. Lithostratigraphic Unit III, whic h extends from 434.72 to $530.47\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, consists of bioturbated sand, muddy sand, and sand y mud. A distinguishing characteristic of Unit III is that it consists of glauconite-rich bioturbate d sand, muddy sand, and sandy mud. Lithostratigraphic Unit IV is $315.08\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, shows a significant decrease in detrital glauconite, and is divided into two subunits. Subunit IVA is $171.63\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and has weakly stratified muddy sand and sandy mud as the dominant lithology. Althoug h yellowish brown beds of calcareous mud occur in overlying units, they become more prominent i n Subunit IVA, with beds ranging $3{-}77\ \mathrm{cm}$ in thickness. Subunit IVB is $143.45\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and has  a similar lithology to overlying Subunit IVA. Marked differences include an increase in the dominance of sand over mud, the appearance of common pseudomorphs after ikaite and spherical calcareous concretions, and a decrease in calcareous mud. Lithostratigraphic Unit V, which is 132.4 5 m thick, continues to the bottom of Hole U1607A. This unit is distinguished by the abrupt reappearance of abundant glauconite as sand to granule grade intraclasts in sharp-based, graded, an d stratified sandy lithologies, which is interbedded with and ultimately transitions downhole t o brown and gray, sparsely bioturbated mud. Overall, the sedimentary succession recovered at Sit e U1607 is consistent with marine deposition within a subbasin situated inland of the Melville Ba y Ridge.

# 4.5.3.2. Micropaleontology  

Core catcher samples and additional split-core samples from the 103 cores of Hole U1607A wer e examined for foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, and other palynomorphs. The split-core sample s targeted thin (typically centimeter scale) calcareous mud horizons and/or intervals close to mollusk shells, where carbonate/foraminifera preservation may have been enhanced, and interval s adjacent to where diatoms had been found in core catcher samples. Mudline samples were als o examined for each group and collected for sedaDNA.  

Microfossils generally occur only sporadically and discontinuously in the muddy sands, sand y muds and muds typical of Site U1607, apart from palynomorphs, which have more continuou s occurrences. A combination of paleoenvironmental restrictions (i.e., shelf/neritic environment s unfavorable to pelagic species) and diagenetic influences on pore water chemistry and preservation potential is likely responsible for the paucity of biomineralized skeletal remains in many intervals. Biostratigraphic results are therefore limited but provide some degrees of age control i n different parts of the hole.  

Foraminifera are mostly limited to benthic species, with agglutinated species being most common. Four samples from the weakly stratified very find sands and muds of Lithostratigraphic Units I V and V (634–918 m CSF-A) contain scarce planktonic foraminifera species. Diatoms are observe d in $12\%$ of the samples examined. Dinocysts are present in the uppermost three core catcher samples and two additional samples that were taken from Core 400-U1607A-2R. No dinocysts wer e observed in core catcher samples from Cores 19R–74R, which is likely a result of dilution b y terrigenous sediment input and a low concentration of dinocysts. Dinocyst abundances increas e downhole from the core catcher sample of Core 74R. Postcruise palynological processing usin g hydrofluoric acid (HF) will provide more constraints on dinocyst abundances throughout thi s interval. Mollusk shells and their fragments are regular features of Site U1607 cores. Foraminifer a shells, as well as mineralized burrow fills, are often pyritized.  

The observed assemblages of all microfossil groups are generally composed of species with lon g geologic ranges. In terms of age control, all groups are consistent with Miocene ages, wherea s downhole some taxa are suggestive of Oligocene ages. The meager planktonic foraminifera assemblages are of low diversity and consist of few (5–20 specimens) small-sized individuals. Th e deepest occurrence of planktonic foraminifera, observed in the core catcher sample of Core 400- U1607A-88R, is consistent with an early Miocene to late Oligocene age. The diatom specie s observed suggest Miocene ages and downcore the dinocyst taxa reflect middle to late Miocen e and older ages. In general, the microfossils from the upper $500\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ of Hole U1607A are characteristic of coastal or neritic environments with ample food/nutrient availability and below $\mathord{\sim}500$ m CSF-A assemblages reflect more open marine environments that are at times favorable t o planktonic foraminifera. The prominence of agglutinated benthic foraminifera, which are mor e environmentally tolerant than calcareous species, is also consistent with a food-rich inner shel f environment corrosive to small calcitic tests. All microfossil assemblages have environmental an d climatic affinities comparable to assemblages observed in the Miocene of western Baffin Bay an d the Labrador Sea (ODP Leg 105) and the North Sea (Kaminski et al., 1989; King, 1989).  

# 4.5.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements from Site U1607 were performed using the SRM t o investigate the remanent magnetization on a total of 491 archive-half sections. Measurement s were not made on core catcher sections. All measurements on archive halves were made at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals up to a peak AF demagnetization of $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ .  

A total of 525 discrete cube samples were taken from working halves. Generally, we collected on e sample per core section, avoiding visually disturbed intervals. Of the 525 samples, 512 sample s were taken using the parallel saw and the rest were sampled using J-cubes by inserting them int o the working half. Of the discrete samples, 476 samples were measured on the SRM and stepwis e demagnetized up to $50\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The remaining specimens were preserved for further study.  

At Site U1607, we used a filtering method that assesses the magnetic stability of archive half an d discrete sample data. Above ${\sim}375\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, we defined 13 magnetic polarity zones. Below ${\sim}375$ m CSF-A, magnetic data were unreliable because of a diagenetic loss of remanence-carrying material, and it was not possible to define polarity intervals. Further constraint awaits other chronological information, including confirmation of possible unconformities or hiatuses.  

# 4.5.3.4. Physical properties  

Standard physical property measurements were made on cores from Hole U1607A using th e WRMSL, SHMSL, and NGRL track instruments. Discrete measurements were also made fo r MAD analysis, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity on the PWC system. Because of the lo w recovery and highly disturbed cored material, PWL measurements were unreliable. PWC was limited to diamictic intervals because values of isolated clasts are not representative of the formation.  

Prominent variations in physical property values occur at similar depths in NGR and density an d are associated with major lithologic changes in the cores. A positive correlation is found betwee n density and NGR counts for Site U1607. The correlation between these physical properties distinguishes five PP units (I–V) at Site U1607. PP Unit I (0–180 m CSF-A) is distinguished by a shar p increase downhole in NGR, MS, and density in the upper $50\;\mathrm{m}$ of material, followed by relativel y constant values to $^{180}\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Below, in PP Unit II $180{-}350\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A})$ ) high-amplitude variability of NGR and MS reflects the broad variations in the lithology, which transition from more frequent intervals of mud to muddy sand and sandy mud moving downhole through the unit. PP Uni t III $350{-}720\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A)}$ is characterized by a decrease in NGR and density values compared to Uni t II, which might reflect the transition from intervals of mud and sand to predominantly mudd y sand toward the bottom of this unit. Muddy sand is also the primary lithology of PP Unit IV (720– $825\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ), where NGR, MS, and density remain relatively constant relative to values observe d in the lowermost interval of PP Unit III. PP Unit V (825–978 m CSF-A) is defined by a decrease i n NGR and density to the bottom of the hole within a predominantly mud lithology.  

# 4.5.3.5. Geochemistry  

Samples for headspace gas, IW chemistry, and bulk sediment geochemistry were analyzed at Sit e U1607. Headspace hydrocarbon gas measurements reveal high concentrations below $5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A with methane concentrations up to $113{,}700\,\mathrm{\,ppm}$ . Ethane is found at lower concentrations of up t o $725\,\mathrm{ppm}$ , and longer chain hydrocarbon gases (propane, butane, and pentane) are detected at lo w yet consistent levels below $500\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ . The main findings from IW analysis include low salinit y values in the upper $200\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ of the site. IW iron, manganese, sulfate, and phosphate sho w elevated concentrations near the seafloor and sharp decreases to low concentrations with depth. Lithium and barium both increase significantly with depth. Elemental analysis of solid materia l reveal $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents of largely ${<}1\%$ , and some intervals contain greater amounts (up to $59\%$ ). The contents of total organic carbon and total nitrogen increase notably with increasing depth.  

# 4.5.3.6. Age model  

The initial age constraints of Site U1607 are based on magnetostratigraphic interpretations o f inclination with two additional biostratigraphic considerations. The diatom Proboscia barboi i s present at $198.7\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and has an age range of $3.31{-}9.49\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in the North Atlantic (Koç an d Scherer, 1996). The second possible constraint is from the co-occurrence of two diatoms (Goniothecium rogersii and Goniothecium decoratum) at $199.54\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A whose age ranges overla p between 16 and $23\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Suto et al., 2008). These two observations are mutually inconsistent an d lead to two possible age models. There are also unconformities recorded in the seismic profil e reflecting potential hiatuses at about 26 and $73\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, the latter of which may eliminate th e highest normal polarity zone as a possible constraint.  

The first age model is based on the occurrence of $P_{\cdot}$ barboi at $198.7\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and in this mode l the transition from normal to reversed for the highest normal zone is correlated to Chron C4r.1 r and the lowest reversed to normal transition is correlated to Chron C4Ar.2n. The average sediment accumulation rate for this age model is $19~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . The second age model is based on th e co-occurrence of the $G.$ . rogersii and $G.$ decoratum species, and in this model the transition fro m normal to reversed for the highest normal zone is correlated to Chron C5Cn.2r and the lowes t reversed to normal transition is correlated to Chron C6n. The average sediment accumulation rat e for this age model is $13\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ . Further refinement of the age model for Site U1607 must awai t shore-based studies.  

# 4.5.3.7. Downhole measurements  

Downhole logging was carried out in Hole U1607A upon completion of the coring operations.  A modified triple combo tool string was deployed with MSS, natural gamma ray, electrical laterolo g resistivity, acoustic velocity, and density tools. Four runs (two down passes and two up passes ) were carried out with the sensors recording on the way down and up. Two of the runs (initial dow n pass and final up pass) covered the full length of the hole to $40\;\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom. Two calibration runs (one up pass and one down pass) were logged on the deepest $100\mathrm{~m~}$ of the hole. Th e caliper showed a homogeneous and stable hole with minimum washouts to $880\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

Upon completion of the downhole logging with the modified triple combo, vertical seismic profiling was implemented with the VSI. The VSI aimed to obtain an accurate time-depth relationshi p to tie the logging and coring results with the seismic data. The geophones recorded the seismi c signal at 33 stations located at an average spacing of $30\;\mathrm{m}$ and 3 good shots were recorded in mos t of the stations. Thus, VSI results were used in the core-log-seismic correlations at Site U1607.  A protected species watch was in place before and during the use of the seismic source. Loggin g measurements were crucial for covering recovery gaps in RCB coring, especially near the botto m of Hole U1607A. Core logging and downhole logging results differ on absolute values, but the relative trends of the logs are comparable. Hence, logging data could be used to cover the formatio n recovery gaps with confidence.  

# 4.6. Site U1608  

# 4.6.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1608 (proposed site MB-06D) is located at $74^{\circ}7.6818^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ and $60^{\circ}58.3172^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at a water dept h of 607 mbsl on the middle section of the northwest Greenland shelf west of the Melville Bay Ridg e and graben structures formed during Cretaceous rifting (Figure F16). The main coring targets ar e mounded contourite drift deposits of expected Pliocene age associated with Megaunit B (Knutz e t al., 2015, 2019; Aubry, 2021) and overlying sediments of Megaunit A, recording the transition int o glacigenic deposits of earliest TMF progradation. The expanded interval of Megaunit B, capture d at Site U1608 reflects deposition below a major incised escarpment that is at least $500~\mathrm{m}$ tall an d extends into disturbed sediment packages interpreted to be mass transport deposits. The base of the contourite drift accumulation is defined by Horizon c1 of probable late Miocene age (Knutz et al., 2015). Site U1608 ends ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ above Horizon c1, which at this location is characterized by an erosional unconformity. In the overlying unit, Megaunit A, 10 horizons are mapped using highresolution seismic data, and including the seabed they define 11 seismic units that each record progradation of the TMF system under the influence of grounded glacier ice (Knutz et al., 2019). TMF Seismic Unit 1 targeted at Site U1608 records the first advance of the northwest GrIS onto the continental shelf, hypothesized to correspond to the Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary (Knutz et al., 2019) (Figure F16).  

The expected lithologies are gravel-sand, diamicton, and pebbly mud in the upper $40\,\mathrm{m}$ and mudstone with silty-sandy intervals in the succession below. The seismic characteristics suggest a gradual transition from a deep marine (outer shelf) to a more nearshore environment, eventually replaced by a proglacial setting. The expected lithologies are diamicton and mudstone with siltysandy intervals such as would be expected in proglacial settings and from nearshore to deep marine environments. Drilling at Site U1608 includes RCB coring to $561~\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) and logging.

Regional seismic Horizons (Hz) b1 and c1 are indicated together with internal horizons (green, pink) that connect Site U1608 with Site U1606 (see Figure F12). Correlation to seismic megaunits is also shown. Vertical scale on Site U1608 line is meter depth based on preferred time-depth model. ${\mathsf{S P}}=$ shotpoint, TWT $=$ two-way traveltime.

Gray line grid $=$ regional 2-D seismic data (TGS), black line grid $=$ high-resolution multichannel seismic data (LAKO19).  

There are two principal goals for this site: (1) capture deposits corresponding to the earlies t shelf-based glaciations in northwest Greenland (earliest glacial clinoforms of Megaunit A) an d (2) recover Neogene sediments of likely Pliocene age in Megaunit B that can elucidate paleoceanographic conditions prior to the major expansion of the GrIS (Knutz et al., 2015). Hypothetically, the contourite drift may provide a marine analog to terrestrial outcrops (e.g., Beaufort and Ka p Kobenhavn formations), depicting warm climate conditions in the High Arctic during late Pliocene to early Pleistocene (Gosse et al., 2017).  

Planned drilling at Site U1608 included coring with the RCB system from the seafloor to $561\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in a single hole. Planned downhole logging included the triple combo tool string, FMS, an d VSI check shots.  

# 4.6.2. Operations  

The vessel transited $23\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ from Site U1607 to Site U1608. The thrusters were lowered an d secured, and the ship was fully in DP mode at $0051\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 September 2023. The rig crew made u p an RCB BHA, and the drill string was tripped to near the seafloor. Hole U1608A was spudded a t $0435\,\mathrm{h},$ tagging the seafloor at 606.9 mbsl. Cores 400-U1608A-1R through 60R advanced from 0 t o $561.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $267.35\;\mathrm{m}$ $(47\%)$ .  

Sepiolite (drilling mud) was swept in the hole, and the bit was released in the hole at $1555\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 9 September to prepare for logging Hole U1608A. The hole was displaced with heavy mud (barite), and the pipe was tripped up, with the end of the pipe ultimately placed at $103.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A becaus e of concerns about the condition and stability of the hole. The modified triple combo tool strin g was deployed to the base of Hole U1608A and tagged the bottom at $558.6~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Following  a complete pass of the hole, the modified triple combo was pulled to the rig floor and broken down. The FMS (without sonic) tool string was then assembled and deployed at $0235\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 September. After two successful logs, the FMS tool was brought back on board and broken down. The VSI wa s rigged up and deployed, and the protected species watch began at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ . Stations were measure d uphole every $20\;\mathrm{m},$ and the VSI was back on board by $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ . With logging completed, we trippe d the pipe out of Hole U1608A, clearing the rig floor at $1555\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill floor was secured for transit, and the thrusters were raised and secured for transit at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1608A and Sit e U1608.  

# 4.6.3. Principal results  

# 4.6.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

The stratigraphy of Site U1608 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units (Figure F17). The lithofacies include (1) bioturbated mud with dispersed sand, (2) calcareous mud, (3) sandy mud/mudd y sand with or without dispersed clasts, and (4) clast-poor sandy diamicton. Lithofacies 1 and 3 ar e present in all lithostratigraphic units, and Lithofacies 2 and 4 occur only in Lithostratigraphi c Units II and IV.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I contains the upper $53.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A of the site and consists of washe d gravel (a product of drilling disturbance) with diverse igneous, plutonic, and metamorphic clasts. Lithostratigraphic Unit II, extending from 53.6 to $293.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, contains bioturbated sand y mud/muddy sand with or without dispersed clasts, calcareous mud, and occurrences of clast-poo r sandy diamicton. Lithostratigraphic Unit III extends from 293.5 to $429.3\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and contain s meter- to decimeter-scale intervals of bioturbated mud with sand and sandy mud to muddy san d with or without dispersed clasts. Overall, Unit III is distinguished from Unit II by a decrease in th e abundance of sand, a significant reduction in the occurrence of the calcareous mud lithofacies, and an increase in the abundance of bioturbated mud with dispersed sand. Underlying Unit III i s the $135.8\;\mathrm{m}$ thick Lithostratigraphic Unit IV $(429.3{-}561.46\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ , which consists of alternating meter- to decimeter-scale intervals of bioturbated mud with dispersed sand and decimeterscale intervals of sandy mud/muddy sand. This unit marks a downhole increase in the san d proportion as well as an increase in the occurrence of yellowish calcareous mud. In this unit, th e calcareous mud commonly occurs as centimeter-scale bioturbated patches. Overall, the sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1608 is consistent with deposition in a marine shelf setting wit h sedimentary contributions from glacigenic and minor hemipelagic biosiliceous sources.  

# 4.6.3.2. Micropaleontology  

Core catcher samples from the 60 cores of Hole U1608A were examined for foraminifera, diatoms, dinocysts, and other palynomorphs. Samples were also taken for sedaDNA analysis. The mudlin e was not recovered at Site U1608 and Cores 400-U1608A-1R through 3R contain washed grave l without fine-grained sediment suitable for microfossil analysis. All microfossil groups are presen t in Site U1608 cores and occur throughout much of the recovered sequence. Benthic foraminifer a occur in $88\%$ of the samples. Planktonic foraminifera are found in only 3 samples, represented i n each case by a single specimen. Diatoms were observed in $70\%$ of the samples, and dinocysts wer e observed in $84\%$ of the samples.

Figure F17. Lithostratigraphic summary, Site U1608. A. All SHMSL point MS measurements filtered to exclude measurements greater than two standard deviations from mean of entire data set (thin red line) and depth-based rolling average o f this filtered data using a $10\,\mathsf{m}$ window (thick red line). Same method was used to plot (B) Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL ) RGB red minus blue data and (C) whole-round NGR measurements. D. Clast counts per $10\,{\mathsf{c m}}$ are centered on middle of 1 0 cm interval.  

Foraminifera are absent until ${\sim}85\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Below this depth, they become rare to intermittentl y common to the base of the hole and consist of typical Arctic Neogene shelf-slope benthic specie s (Feyling-Hansen, 1976). The long-ranging benthic species offer little age control, although th e presence of Cassidulina teretis implies that the foraminifera-bearing sediments between ${\sim}85$ an d $524\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A are older than $700\,\mathrm{ky}$ (early Pleistocene) but no older than middle Miocene (Seidenkrantz, 1995). Diatoms are barren until ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, below which they are present in most cor e catcher samples. The diatom assemblages are diverse and well preserved in some samples, providing both age and paleoenvironmental constraints. Palynomorphs occur in every sample in varyin g abundance, including the upper $100\textrm{m}$ CSF-A where other microfossils are rare or absent. Th e dinocyst assemblages, which consist mostly of species associated with neritic, nutrient-rich environments, are also diverse in some intervals, providing additional chronostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental insights. Pulses of terrestrially derived organic material are a distinct feature o f Site U1608. This is evidenced by occurrences of micro-/macrofossil wood and plant fragments i n sieved foraminifera samples, as well as by smaller plant/wood fragments, pollen, spores, an d fungal material in palynomorph preparations. These pulses of terrestrial material in the sieve d $(>\!63\ensuremath{~\upmu\mathrm{m}})$ foraminifera samples occur intermittently and at times intensely from 85 to $488\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# 4.6.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements from Site U1608 were performed using the SRM t o investigate the magnetization of a total of 201 archive-half sections. Measurements were not mad e on core catcher sections. All measurements on section halves were made at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals up to  a peak AF demagnetization of $20~\mathrm{mT}$ Inclinations from the filtered $20~\mathrm{mT}$ step archive halves ar e generally bimodal at the estimates of inclinations for normal and reversed polarities at this latitud e calculated from the geocentric axial dipole, and the bimodal inclination distribution suggests tha t intervals of both normal and reversed polarity were recovered at Site U1608. A total of 192 discrete cube samples were collected from the working-half sections; generally, we collected on e sample per core section, avoiding visually disturbed intervals. Discrete specimens from Cores 400- U1608A-9R through 40R were measured on the SRM up to a peak AF demagnetization of $50\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Cores 41R–60R were only demagnetized to a peak field of $40~\mathrm{{mT}}$ . We utilized a filtering metho d that assessed the magnetic stability of archive-half and discrete sample data and used the filtere d data to define 11 polarity zones at Site U1608.  

# 4.6.3.4. Physical properties  

Standard physical property measurements were made on cores from Hole U1608A using th e WRMSL, SHMSL, and NGRL track instruments. Discrete measurements were also made fo r MAD analysis, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity on the PWC system. Because of the lo w recovery and highly disturbed cored material, PWL measurements were unreliable. PWC was limited to diamictic intervals because values of isolated clasts are not representative of the formation.  

Prominent variations in physical property values occur at similar depths in NGR and density an d are associated with major lithologic changes in the cores. The correlation between these physica l properties distinguishes five PP units (I–V) at Site U1608. PP Unit I (0–130 m CSF-A) include s mostly irregular values of NGR, MS, and density, which is largely due to poor recovery an d partially due to the occurrence of washed gravel in the uppermost $50\textrm{m}$ CSF-A at Site U1608. Thermal conductivity reaches a maximum value for Site U1608 in PP Unit I. Below, in PP Unit I I ( $130{-}215\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) high-amplitude variability of NGR and MS corresponds to lithologies of mud, sandy mud, and muddy sand. Throughout PP Unit II density decreases slightly downhole. PP Uni t III (215–315 m CSF-A) is characterized by low-amplitude variability in NGR coupled with highamplitude variability in MS in the upper half of the unit, followed by an increase in NGR and  a decrease in MS intensity and variability in the lower half of PP Unit III. NGR and MS trends in P P Unit III reflect the transition from sandy mud to muddy sand as the dominant lithology throughout the unit. Muddy sand is also the primary lithology of PP Unit IV (315–450 m CSF-A), althoug h it also contains intervals of calcareous mud in the lower half of the unit where density become s more variable. NGR and MS in PP Unit IV are both highly variable. PP Unit V (450–561 m CSF-A ) is defined by low NGR and MS values, which further decrease downhole throughout the unit.  

# 4.6.3.5. Geochemistry  

Samples for headspace gas, IW chemistry, and bulk sediment geochemistry were analyzed at Sit e U1608. Headspace hydrocarbon gas concentrations are low in the upper $50\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . Below thi s depth, high concentrations of methane (average of $33,800\;\mathrm{ppm})$ ) are found to the bottom of Hol e U1608A. IW samples were not taken in the uppermost 9 cores of the hole because of low recovery. The main findings from IW analysis include downhole increases in alkalinity, potassium, magnesium, and phosphate to around $250\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , and steadily decreasing values for these component s below $300\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . Elemental analysis of solid material revealed average concentrations of $0.5\%$ organic carbon and $0.06\%$ nitrogen throughout Hole U1608A.  

# 4.6.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

To analyze the extent of the core gaps and further improve the depth assessment of the recovere d material, we correlate the physical properties measured on the cores to the downhole log s obtained from the borehole. Whole-round MS and NGR measured on the cores were imported i n Correlator v.4 as well as downhole MS and NGR data, which were imported into the software as  a single core table. Ties between downhole data and core data were assessed based on visual an d statistical matches of the properties. This procedure has some significant uncertainties because o f the presence of large-scale features in the downhole logging data that do not resemble the recor d measured on cores in the laboratory. However, the overall cyclicity of the records is well matche d between the downhole logs and the cores, and the relative depth offset of each core provides information that can be used to confidently improve the depth constraints of the cores. The resultin g depth scale is referred to as CCSF-A even though it is not a scale resulting from the alignment o f two or more holes. The difference between the CSF-A and CCSF-A depths varies downhole fro m a few centimeters up to $10\;\mathrm{m}$ . The depth constraints provided by the downhole logging data allo w an improved interpretation of the formation lithology, age, and physical properties.  

# 4.6.3.7. Age model  

The initial age constraints are based on magnetostratigraphic interpretations on inclination wit h two additional biostratigraphic constraints. The diatom $P_{\cdot}$ barboi was identified in the interva l between 180 and $507\ m\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and has an age range of $3.31{-}9.49\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Koç and Scherer, 1996). Th e second potential constraint is from the occurrence of the diatom Thalassiosira nidulus throughout material recovered from Site U1608, whose first occurrence is at $4.57\;M\mathbf{a}$ (Koç and Scherer, 1996) on the Iceland Basin Plateau. With these considerations, we have two possible age models. There are also possible hiatuses identified in the seismic data at 96 and $535\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, the forme r of which eliminates the highest normal polarity zone as a possible constraint. Model 1 is inconsistent with the occurrence of $P_{\cdot}$ barboi above $238\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and in this model the transition fro m normal (N2) to reversed (R1) is correlated to Chron C2An.1n. The average sediment accumulatio n rate for this age model is $18.5\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . In Model 2, the transition from normal (N2) to reversed (R1 ) is correlated to Chron C3n.1n and the N6–R5 reversal is correlated to Chron C3An.1n. The average sediment accumulation rate for this age model is $15.1\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ .  

# 4.6.3.8. Downhole measurements  

Downhole logging was carried out in Hole U1608A upon completion of the coring operations. Th e modified triple combo tool string was deployed with MSS, natural gamma ray, electrical laterolo g resistivity, acoustic velocity, and density tools. Two of the four runs (initial down pass and final u p pass) covered the full length of the hole to $2\;\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom of the hole ( $561\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). Th e caliper showed a stable hole, and the instruments yielded reliable measurements; however, larg e washouts were observed to 1020 mbrf, and the lower $157~\mathrm{m}$ of the hole was homogeneous.  

Upon completion of the modified triple combos runs, the FMS tool was lowered downhole. Thre e runs (a down pass and two up passes) were completed. Vertical seismic profiling was implemente d with the VSI after the FMS run. The VSI aimed to obtain an accurate time-depth relationship to ti e the logging and coring results with the seismic data, and the geophones recorded the seismic signal at 24 stations located at an average spacing of $20\,\mathrm{m}$ . Successful measurements were made at 2 0 of the 24 planned stations; however, stations between 970 and 1030 mbrf needed further processing. VSI results were used in the core-log-seismic correlation at Site U1608. A protected specie s watch was in place before and during the use of the seismic source.  

Logging measurements were crucial for covering recovery gaps during RCB coring. Core loggin g and downhole logging results differ in absolute values, but the relative trends of the logs ar e comparable. Hence, logging data could be used for covering the formation recovery gaps wit h confidence.  

# 5. Preliminary scientific assessment  

Anthropogenic warming may be forcing the GrIS to respond in manners that are unpredictable, o f which there are no comparisons in recent history (Siegert et al., 2020). For this reason, it is important to understand its past warm-phase behavior and provide a deep temporal baseline for GrI S variability. To address this need, the goal of Expedition 400 was to retrieve a GrIS proximal sedimentary archive, hitherto only imaged on seismic data (Knutz et al., 2015, 2019; Newton, 2021), that could provide new information and cover knowledge gaps pertaining to the evolution of th e GrIS.  

Expedition 400 recovered $2299\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment core by drilling a composite succession of $3084\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , covered by six sites along the transect traversing the northwest Greenland continental margi n (Figures F1, F2, F4, F18, F19; Table T1). In addition, wireline logging was completed at four site s with three of them including VSI data. The average recovery was $51\%$ , which was unsurprising fo r a glaciated margin, but considerable variations were seen between sites and stratigraphic units. Sites U1603 and U1604 in the deep water produced recoveries of $90\%{-}100\%$ in the interval to 25 0 m CSF-A, whereas recoveries in the drilled succession below $250~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A were generally belo w $30\%$ . Site U1605 on the outer shelf margin turned out to be less promising with only $13.6\%$ recovery. For this reason and considering time constraints, we decided to omit proposed Site MB-30A. Site U1608 drilled to $561\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with a recovery of $48\%$ , which is partly due to poor core retur n in upper $100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The pattern of increased recovery below Megaunit A was also manifeste d by the four holes drilled at Sites U1606 and U1608. Most outstanding and somewhat surprisin g was Site U1607, which was cored to $978\textrm{m}$ CSF-A and returned a recovery of $77\%$ . Considerin g that we anticipated a total of $2000{-}3000\ \mathrm{m}$ of sediment at the outset, the actual amount of cor e gained meets our expectations. Four environmental and geologic settings were drilled as part o f Expedition 400, and each of them aimed at meeting specific scientific objective.

# 5.1. Slope to deep-water basin of TMF—Sites U1603 and U1604  

The aim of coring these sites within a drift-channel system was to obtain high-resolution record s that could test the notion that the NGrIS has experienced significant episodes of glacial retrea t associated warm interglacials, also referred to as super-interglacials, since the early Pleistocene. The age model for these sites was based on paleomagnetic reversals and relative paleomagneti c intensity stratigraphy. Sedimentation rates range 28–75 and $15{-}45\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ for Sites U1603 an d U1604, respectively, with the lowest values observed in the sections below $250\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Thi s means that we can expect to gain continuous centennial-scale resolution records from these sites, which fulfills the requirement for identifying discrete pulses of sediment from Greenland. Th e lithology shows distinct changes in ice-rafted debris clasts, some of which fall within layers rich i n detrital carbonate related to Baffin Bay Detrital Carbonate events (Andrews et al., 1998). The variation in clast composition throughout the lithologic sequence prescribe marked changes in th e iceberg-emitting source regions. Further multiproxy studies will be needed to reach a detaile d understanding of the evolution of the NGrIS and its interaction with ocean circulation as well a s other glacial outlets (e.g., the Lancaster Sound and Nares Strait systems).  

The content of microfossils in core catcher samples recovered at deepwater sites was generall y sparse with only sporadic occurrences of assemblages. However, targeted sampling in core sections with low NGR improved the detection of microfossils, especially foraminifera, which i s encouraging for further work.

The data produced from Sites U1603 and U1604 will allow us to test the potential Pleistocene scenarios for GrIS mass loss proposed by Schaefer et al. (2016): ice-free interglacials, ice-free super-interglacials, or one 280,000 y long ice-free period. An additional objective is to address the hypothesis originally proposed by Clark and Pollard (1998) suggesting that the transition from 40,000 to 100,000 y climate cyclicity across the MPT was related to continental ice sheets growing thicker once the regolith-soil on which they were grounded had been eroded away. Knutz et al. (2019) proposed a linkage between GrIS evolution and progressive regolith erosion based on seismic evidence indicating a pronounced shift in ice sheet configuration through the MPT. Bolstered by the age model and sedimentation rates indicated by the shipboard results, sediments cored a t Sites U1603, U1604, and U1605 provide a test for changes in basal ice-flow conditions related t o progressive regolith-soil erosion since $1.2\,M{\bf a}$ . Such changes might be revealed by the compositio n of detrital parent material or organic components reworked from land by successive glacia l advances.

# 5.2. Outer shelf margin of TMF—Site U1605  

Coring at Site U1605 was intended to capture interglacial muds potentially interbedded within th e aggrading shelf wedge of the Melville Bugt TMF. It was also unique in being the only site corin g into Seismic Unit 7 that unlike younger Seismic Units 8–11 displays an elongate slope front depocenter (Knutz et al., 2019). No muddy intervals were recovered at Site U1605. The material recovered at Site U1605, exclusive of drilled clasts, was mainly sandy to muddy diamicton. However, thi s lithology will be valuable for detrital archive analyses informing on weathering and landscap e exposure (Christ et al., 2020) at the onset of the MPT.  

# 5.3. Preglacial contourites—Sites U1606 and U1608  

At Sites U1606 and U1608 the strategy was to core through the deposits of the first progradin g unit, representing the onset of shelf based glacial expansion (Megaunit A), and then continue int o marine contourite sediments of Megaunit B, as defined by the seismic geometries. The overal l recoveries achieved were low $(<\!50\%)$ as a result of large variations (excluding washed gravel) i n Megaunit A representing the uppermost $100{-}160\;\mathrm{m}$ at Sites U1606 and U1608, whereas recover y increases in underlying contourite drifts of Megaunit B. A $450~\mathrm{m}$ thick contourite sequence wa s drilled at Site U1608 with recoveries generally increasing with depth. A highlight from Site U160 8 was the discovery of species in the form of diatoms and foraminifera with affinity toward conditions significantly warmer than today. The paleomagnetic results from Sites U1606 and U160 8 were of good quality through the lower part of the drilled succession where recovery was best. However, the interpretation of ages was not straightforward, resulting in two potential age model s capturing different parts of the Pliocene. However, the micropaleontology results provide mos t support for the younger age model. Rare occurrences of foraminifera in glacial-marine sediment s in Cores 400-U1606B-11R and 14R support an early Pleistocene age.  

We have cored a prominent Pliocene archive and probably the late Pliocene–early Pleistocen e transition, but elaboration on developing a multiproxy paleoclimate record from Sites U1606 an d U1608 is needed. This work will establish the paleoceanography and tectonic framework responsible for maintaining a geostrophic boundary current over millions of years along the Wes t Greenland margin during the Pliocene, potentially connected to Atlantic meridional circulation. Application of paleoceanographic tracers and sedimentologic work may provide information o n current strength and potentially configuration of Arctic gateways, and coarse-grained detrita l components can reveal presence and variability of the past GrIS. The marine sedimentary succession recovered at Sites U1606 and U1608 forms a unique empirical database for establishing Arcti c climate development and ice-ocean interactions during the Pliocene warm analog.  

# 5.4. Postrift basin—Site U1607  

We cored Site U1607 to $978~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with the aim of understanding early ice sheet evolution i n northwest Greenland and its behavior in a past climate periods with stronger greenhouse forcin g than the present. This was the primary site (formerly proposed Site MB-07B) for capturing  a sequence that was characterized by seismic data as a hemipelagic basin infill (Figure F4). Fro m regional seismic lines we also knew that there was a stratigraphic section, presumably over hundreds of meters, missing in the top of the section (\~present seabed) because of tectonic uplif t and/or glacial erosion (Knutz et al., 2015; Gregersen et al., 2022). The site was drilled on the oute r rim of a sedimentary basin situated between a major boundary fault against Greenland (east) an d the Melville Bay Ridge (west). These tectonic elements originated during the Cretaceous rift phas e prior to Baffin Bay opening and were later modified by a late Eocene transpressional regime a s spreading halted (Figure F2).  

Expedition 400 achieved a nearly unbroken sedimentary record that according to biostratigraphi c indexes goes back to the earliest Miocene–late Oligocene. Shipboard paleomagnetic stratigraph y was not affirmative and only possible to about $360\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ because of diagenetic influences o n magnetic mineral components. With limited but important support from the shipboard micropaleontology team, two potential age models were presented, essentially capturing different parts o f the Miocene. Onshore analyses, including further paleomagnetic work, micropaleontology base d on comprehensive sampling and processing, as well as discrete radiogenic dating, will be necessar y to produce a refined age model for Hole U1607A. With a better constrained age model it may b e possible to extract climate rhythms from the continuous proxy data (e.g., NGR or other wirelin e logging data) that can be orbitally tuned to the global climate record (cf. Miller et al., 2020). Wit h further elaboration on lithologic and organic matter proxies we hope to test the hypothesis tha t climate cooling in the late Miocene is associated with an ice sheet expansion in northwest Greenland from ephemeral glaciation to an ice dome drained by glacial-marine outlets. Site U1607 ha s provided us with an Oligocene–Miocene archive adjacent to west Greenland sedimentary source s that will be crucial for understanding the response of the cryosphere to greenhouse gas forcin g and associated tipping points. This information will be valuable for validating paleoclimat e ensemble models aimed at reconstructing warm analogs aimed at future warming scenarios.  

Drilling Site U1607 to the planned target depth of nearly $980\textrm{m}$ CSF-A was clearly a high-risk/ high-gain operation, so we consider the results from Site U1607 to be an overachievement.  

# 6. Outreach  

Expedition 400 had two Education and Outreach officers on board. One outreach officer teache s and leads geology field trips at a community college and a university. The other outreach office r was a world geography educator and polar explorer and is currently a Program Manager for  a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded outreach program.  

# 6.1. Live broadcasts  

Both outreach officers traveled to Denmark and Greenland prior to the expedition. The purpos e was to meet with community and organization representatives who have relevant connections t o the expedition’s scientific objectives and who might be interested in ship-to-shore tours. Durin g the expedition, the International School in Denmark scheduled tours for their 7th and 8th grad e classes. Overall, Internet connectivity was excellent, with only a couple of tours experiencin g significant connectivity problems.  

Two open houses were hosted during the expedition; one open house was early during the expedition, and the other open house occurred later. The outreach officers facilitated a broadcaste d presentation and tour led by Co-Chief Scientist Paul Knutz to the European Consortium fo r Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) Summer School, as well as a tour led by Paul Knutz and GEU S colleague and shipboard scientist Lara Pérez to the GEUS community. The outreach officers facilitated a tour hosted by shipboard scientist Vikash Kumar’s institution, the National Centre fo r Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), that was led by him and fellow shipboard scientist, Faw z Naim.  

The outreach officers also facilitated two tours hosted by IODP China and led by shipboar d scientists Jian Ren and Yancheng Zhang. In total, the outreach officers conducted 60 tours t o approximately 2394 participants, plus approximately 2.5 million participants for the two IOD P China events.  

# 6.2. Expedition activities  

The expedition was continuously documented by the two outreach officers using film, photographs, writing, and social media posts. A preexpedition blog about onshore outreach activitie s and an expedition video trailer were posted just prior to departure. A total of seven blog post s were posted on the JOIDES Resolution website along with three related Discovery on Deck video s posted on the JOIDES Resolution YouTube channel. The Reach The World collaboration, whic h  

spanned the duration of the expedition, included three live broadcasts and four blog-style articles.   
A total of 28 classrooms registered for and several participated in live broadcasts.  

# 6.3. Media  

The outreach officers filmed language tours of JOIDES Resolution in French and Danish. Th e French tour was broadcast at a museum exhibition in Geneva, Switzerland, the home institution o f shipboard scientist Sandrine Le Houedec. The Danish tour was filmed with Co-Chief Scientis t Paul Knutz and will be used as a resource at his home institution, GEUS. They also facilitate d several social media posts with GNS Science in New Zealand and shipboard scientist Georgi a Grant. The outreach officers facilitated a media interview with Co-Chief Scientist Anne Jenning s and assisted with edits on an article to be published at University of Colorado at Boulder.  

# 6.4. Social media  

Several posts were made each week on Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly known as Twitter ) during the expedition. Posts featured a variety of topics including cores recovered, life on board, advertising outreach events and resources, and expedition updates. Outreach officers each too k the lead on platforms, dividing Facebook/Instagram and X/YouTube, to increase the variety o f posts shared across all platforms. Social media statistics include 56 Facebook posts with 112,00 0 people reached and 56 new followers, 116 Tweets with 229,000 impressions and 146 new followers, and 112 Instagram posts with 65,000 people reached and 113 new followers. The scientist s also made posts linked to the expedition and posted on LinkedIn.
