# Abstract  

Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 346 (29 July–27 September 2013) drilled seven sites covering a wide latitudinal range in the body of water bordered by the Eurasian continent, the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese Islands, as well as two closely spaced sites in the East China Sea. This expedition recovered $6135.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of core with an average recovery of $101\%$ —a record amount of core recovered during any single IODP expedition. Expedition 346 was the first scientific drilling expedition ever to focus exclusively on the climate system in this region, which is at once so critical yet potentially vulnerable to the challenges society faces in the coming years of global climate change. With the East Asian Monsoon directly affecting the water supply of one-third of the global population, the expedition scientific results and postexpedition research that will follow have direct bearing on society’s understanding of this complex atmosphere-ocean climate system.  

The high quality of materials recovered and the complete documentation of their geological, geochemical, and geophysical context will lead to an unparalleled series of future studies by the expedition Science Party as well as many other scientists over the coming decades. Cores obtained during this expedition will be used to test the hypothesis that Pliocene–Pleistocene uplift of the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau, and the consequent emergence of the two discrete modes of Westerly Jet circulation, caused the amplification of millennial-scale variability of the East Asian summer monsoon and East Asian winter monsoon and provided teleconnection mechanism(s) for Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles.  

Recent and novel advances in drilling technology and newly developed analytical tools enabled the collection and examination of sediment records that were impossible to acquire even a few years ago. The newly engineered half advanced piston corer enabled recovery of the deepest piston core in Deep Sea Drilling Project/Ocean Drilling Program/IODP history ( $490.4\mathrm{~m~}$ in IODP Hole U1427A); that achievement was also the deepest continuously recovered piston cored sequence, initiated at the mudline and penetrating to ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{m}$ core depth below seafloor, Method A (m CSF-A). Technological advances delivered a series of “new surprises” (e.g., pristine dark–light laminae from ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{Ma}$ sediment recovered by piston core from $410\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at IODP Site U1425 and from $210\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at IODP Site U1430) that will stimulate new scientific inquiry into climate dynamics during a time frame and with a high fidelity that could have only been imagined by scientists even a short time ago. High-resolution geochemistry studies targeting the anaerobic oxidation of methane and the relationships between metal chemistry and the degradation of organic carbon were performed to study the fate of organic carbon in the marine system and constrain rates of microbial reactions in the deep biosphere with a novel fluid extraction technique. Finely tuned comparisons were developed between disparate geographic locations and demonstrated synchroneity in this marginal sea’s regional response to internal and external climate-related forcing.  

# Expedition 346 synthesis  

Operations during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 346 drilled seven sites in the marginal sea bordered by the Eurasian continent, the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese Islands (hereafter referred to as the “marginal sea”),1 as well as two closely spaced sites in the East China Sea in August and September 2013. Six of the marginal sea sites were drilled in oceanic basins (Japan, Yamato, and Ulleung Basins), and one site was drilled on a bank named the Yamato Rise (Fig. F1). In total, we recovered $6135.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, with an average recovery of $101\%$ . To our knowledge, this $6135\,\mathrm{~m~}$ is a record amount of core to be recovered by any single expedition during IODP. We gathered an unparalleled archive of atmospheric-ocean linkages relating to the East Asian monsoonal system and, partly because of the implementation of new coring, sampling, and analytical strategies, we are confident that researchers studying this sediment will be able to propel the field of climate dynamics significantly forward.  

This marginal sea was last investigated by scientific ocean drilling during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 127 and 128, nearly 25 y ago. Prior to those tectonically oriented research legs of ODP, the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) had conducted drilling operations during DSDP Leg 31 in 1973 in a challenging and ambitious attempt to reach basement objectives as the plate tectonic revolution was achieving widespread acceptance. Thus, Expedition 346 was the first scientific drilling expedition ever to focus exclusively on the climate system in this area that is at once so critical, yet potentially vulnerable, to the challenges society faces in the coming years of global climate change. With the East Asian Monsoon directly affecting the water supply of one-third of the global population, this research has direct bearing on society’s understanding of this complex atmosphere-ocean climate system.  

The original research goals of Expedition 346 were oriented toward exploring the relationships between atmospheric processes (e.g., the positioning of the atmospheric Westerly Jet circulation), rainfall (e.g., Yangtze River discharge), and oceanic processes (e.g., surface water circulation, sea ice formation, deepwater convection and oxygenation, and surface biological productivity in the marginal sea). Multiple timescales were targeted, and assessing climate sensitivity variations through time and space was an important component of the research plan. We aimed to reconstruct the onset and evolution of orbital- and millennial-scale variations of summer and winter monsoons, Westerly Jet position and intensity, desertification in East and Central Asia, and their interrelationships during at least the last 5 m.y. In detail, we targeted exploring the linkages between orbital and millennial-scale variations of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM), discharge of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, position of Westerly Jet, and paleoceanography of the marginal sea.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Even the early results from the 6 weeks of core recovery during the 2 month expedition have more than met the original scientific objectives. The high quality of materials recovered and the complete documentation of their geological, geochemical, and geophysical context will lead to an unparalleled series of future studies by the expedition scientific party as well as many other scientists over the coming decades.  

Furthermore, because of recent and novel advances in drilling technology and newly developed analytical tools, we were able to collect and examine sediment records that were impossible to acquire even a few years ago. The newly engineered “half piston core” system (called the half advanced piston corer [APC]) enabled us to recover the deepest piston core in DSDP/ODP/IODP history ( $490.4\:\mathrm{m}$ in IODP Hole U1427A). That achievement was also the deepest continuously recovered piston cored sequence, initiated at the mudline and penetrating ${\sim}500\mathrm{~m~}$ solely by piston coring. These technological advances delivered a series of “new surprises” (e.g., pristine dark–light laminae from ${\sim}12\ \mathrm{Ma}$ sediment recovered by piston coring from $410\mathrm{~m~}$ core depth below seafloor, Method A [m CSF-A] at IODP Site U1425 and from $210\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at IODP Site U1430) (Fig. F2 Laminations) that will stimulate new scientific inquiry into climate dynamics during a time frame and with a high fidelity that could have only been imagined by scientists even a short time ago. To study the fate of organic carbon in the marine system and constrain rates of microbial reactions in the deep biosphere with a novel fluid extraction technique, we performed high-resolution geochemistry studies targeting the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and the relationships between metal chemistry and the degradation of organic carbon (Fig. F3). We took advantage of the impressive array of scientific equipment (e.g., color spectrometry) to develop finely tuned comparisons between disparate geographic locations and demonstrated synchroneity in the regional response to internal and external climate-related forcing (Figs. F4, F5).  

We began our voyage from Valdez, Alaska (USA), with four main targeted objectives, as discussed below. After the 2 week transit, we began our studies in the Japan, Yamato, and Ulleung Basins, the Yamato Rise, and the East China Sea (Fig. F1). Ultimately, we successfully addressed and met or exceeded each of these objectives.  

# 1. Address the timing of onset of orbital- and millennial-scale variability of the EASM and EAWM and their relation with variability of Westerly Jet circulation.  

Dark and light layers of the hemipelagic sediment in the marginal sea represent changes in the intensity of EASM precipitation in South China. We recovered these dark and light layers at six sites (IODP Sites U1422–U1426 and U1430; Fig. F6). We showed that it is possible to correlate centimeter- to meter-scale (and often millimeter-scale) dark and light layers between these geographically widely spaced sites, suggesting that the marginal sea responded as a single system to climatic and/or oceanographic perturbations. We confirmed that alternations of the dark and light layers started at ${\sim}2.6\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and became more frequent and distinct from ${\sim}1.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ to the present.  

The presence of ice-rafted debris (IRD) and the occurrence of deepwater ventilation have previously been shown to be related to the intensity of the EAWM. Color reflectance $(\mathrm{L}^{\star})$ of the sediment seems to reflect bottom water ventilation. Expedition 346 showed that deposition of IRD started at $3.0{\sim}3.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at Site U1422 and ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ at Sites U1423 and U1424, whereas $L^{\star}$ increased significantly from $\sim\!2$ to ${\sim}1.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at all deeper water sites. These findings obtained during the expedition provide tantalizing glimpses of meridional and temporal changes in IRD sedimentation that can be related to the evolution of EAWM climate behavior. Finally, hemipelagic sediment recovered from the marginal sea sites have high potential for studies of eolian dust, which bears directly upon important aspects of the objective relating to the Westerly Jet.  

# 2. Reconstruct orbital- and millennial-scale changes in surface and deepwater circulation and surface productivity during at least the last 5 m.y.  

As described above, sedimentary color reflectance $(\mathrm{L}^{\star})$ seems to reflect deepwater ventilation as well as surface productivity. We retrieved continuous hemipelagic sedimentary records to ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at Site U1422; to ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at Sites U1423, U1424, and U1426; and to ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at Sites U1425 and U1430. The sediment shows orbital- to millennial-scale color cycles associated with various degrees of bioturbation and lamination. Recovery, in particular of the older laminated records, benefitted tremendously from the new half APC system, which was able to recover virtually unblemished material from great depths and ages (Fig. F2).  

In general, darker (lower $L^{\star}$ values) layers of Pleistocene age are poorly bioturbated and/or finely laminated, suggesting oxygen-poor conditions, whereas the lighter layers are more bioturbated, suggesting more oxic conditions. Some of the dark layers are brownish and rich in microfossils such as diatoms, nannofossils, radiolarians, and foraminifers, suggesting high surface biological productivity. Orbital-scale dark–light color cycles appeared at ${\sim}2.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , and millennial-scale dark–light cycles became distinct at ${\sim}1.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Orbital-scale dark–light color cycles also appeared in the Miocene interval ( $_{\sim12}$ to ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ) at Sites U1425 and U1430.  

Because these cycles also appear at Yamato Basin Sites U1426 and U1427, where calcium carbonate is present, we will attempt to establish high-quality $\S^{18}\mathrm{O}$ age models to apply throughout the entire marginal sea. These sites are each likely to serve as a “Rosetta stone” that will provide key age controls for the entire region. Furthermore, at Site U1425 we will apply the technique of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of detrital quartz grains to provide an independent control of age for the last $0.5\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ . (Fig. F7); one that is unaffected by changes in salinity or the isotopic composition of the local seawater.  

The initial cruise objective referred to the time frame “during at least the last 5 m.y.” We exceeded that oldest age by a factor of two. For example, millimeter-scale (decadal-scale) lamination is pervasive in the middle Miocene intervals at Site U1430 that record centennial- to millennial-scale color cycles in ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{Ma}$ sediment (Fig. F2). This laminated interval is highly diatomaceous and rich in organic carbon, suggesting high biological productivity in the surface water. The fidelity of core recovery by the half APC system is remarkable; at Site U1430 we are able to document that in these ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{Ma}$ laminated interval, lighter laminae contain a startling enrichment in the relative proportion of centric versus pennate diatoms, suggesting significantly elevated nutrient inputs to the surface water and indicative of an ecosystem responding sensitively to climate dynamics.  

3. Reconstruct the history of the Yangtze River discharge using cores from the northern end of the East China Sea, as it reflects variation and evolution in the EASM and exerts an impact on the paleoceanography of the marginal sea.  

IODP Sites U1428 and U1429 in the northern East China Sea were selected to accomplish this objective over long timescales (e.g., ideally reaching the middle Miocene), and we were approved to drill to $800\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Unfortunately, we were forced to terminate these two sites at shallow depths of ${\sim}210$ and $\mathord{\sim}185\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, respectively, because of the unexpected occurrence of thick and unconsolidated sand. However, we were also fortuitously delivered the gift of higher than anticipated sedimentation rates ${\sim}42$ and ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ ., respectively) and were able to successfully recover a continuous sequence of biocalcareous mud that was $\mathord{\sim}137$ and ${\sim}179\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, respectively, and that covered the last ${\sim}0.35\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ . Between the two sites, we were able to drill five separate holes with superior stratigraphic correlations between the holes and, indeed, the sites themselves. With such excellent recovery and high sedimentation rates, we will be able to reconstruct very high resolution changes in sea-surface salinity and temperature. Because sea-surface salinity at these sites traces discharge of the Yangtze River, we will be able to reconstruct changes in the intensity of the EASM on orbital and millennial timescales and compare the results with paleoceanographic changes in the marginal sea. This will enable us to link climatic hydrology on the Asian continent (traced through reconstruction of Yangtze River discharge) to oceanography of the sea (traced through the surface and deep water circulation).  

# 4. Examine the interrelationship among the EASM, EAWM, nature and intensity of the influx through the Tsushima Strait, intensity of winter cooling, surface productivity, ventilation, and bottom water oxygenation in the region’s marginal sea and their changes during the last 5 m.y.  

This single objective ties together a variety of multifaceted atmospheric and oceanographic processes. We successfully addressed and met this objective by collected study of the recovered material at all our sites, which were strategically placed to cover two meridional transects and a depth transect and to sample deposition beneath different ocean currents (Fig. F8). For example, Site U1427 in the Yamato Basin (Fig. F1) has a high sedimentation rate of ${\sim}36~\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . and covers the last $1.4\mathrm{~m.y.}$ . (Fig. F9). Our deepest penetration there $\mathrm{\sim}550\mathrm{\;m\;CSF{-}A})$ ) will allow for a long yet high-resolution reconstruction of the changes in the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC). We will be able to assess the different timescales of changes of the TWC and perhaps tie the younger portion of the record at Site U1427 to the very high resolution record of Yangtze River discharge at Sites U1428 and U1429. Thus, the combination of Sites U1427, U1428, and U1429 will allow us to address important questions relating the internal dynamics of the marginal sea to potential external forcing.  

Additionally, the depth and meridional transects described by Sites U1422 (currently at $\mathord{\sim}3500$ meters below sea level [mbsl]), U1424 $\langle{\sim}2800~\mathrm{mbsl}\rangle$ ), U1425 and U1423 $[{\sim}1900$ and ${\sim}1800~\mathrm{mbsl}_{.}$ ), U1426 $({\sim}950~\mathrm{mbsl})$ ), and U1427 $\mathrm{\sim}300~\mathrm{mbsl})$ ) (Fig. F5) will provide a heretofore unrealized opportunity to study the dynamics of ventilation and oxygenation history, which responds to changes in the EASM, EAWM, and TWC flow. The exquisite contrasts in color spectra between the dark and light cycles, which are traceable across the marginal sea, are most pronounced in the deeper sites and become progressively less so at the shallower sites, which speaks to the potential for future studies to generate a painstakingly precise history of oxygenation and, perhaps, changes in the input of newly oxygenated waters during different climate phases. Moreover, the stratigraphic consistency between the evolution of key lithologic units (e.g., Subunit IB; $1.2{-}1.3\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ ) from location to location regardless of depth is a marvelous example of this marginal sea’s ability to serve as a sensitive recorder of largeamplitude sea level changes associated with the climatic Mid-Pleistocene Transition as Earth’s climate evolved from being dominated by 41 k.y. cyclicity and into “the 100 k.y. world” in which we live today (Fig. F10).  

# Site summaries  

# Site U1422  

Site U1422 is located in the northeastern part of the Japan Basin at $43^{\circ}45.99^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $138^{\circ}49.99^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and $3429~\mathrm{mbsl}$ (Fig. F1). The site is ${\sim}40~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of ODP Site 795 and near the northeastern edge of the topographic depression of the Japan Basin (Fig. F8). The site is mainly under the influence of the Liman (Cold) Current but may also be slightly influenced by the TWC. Although more than $\%$ (1.4 Sv) of the TWC $(\sim\!2.5$ Sv) flows out of the marginal sea through the Tsugaru Strait, which is ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{km}$ south of Site U1422, the rest of the TWC (\~1.1 Sv) flows further north and out through the Soya Strait at present (e.g., Talley et al., 2006). Because the sill depth of the Soya Strait, ${\sim}300~\mathrm{km}$ northeast of Site U1422, is only $55~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the influence of the TWC should have been significantly affected by glacioeustatic sea level changes during the Quaternary. Results from previous drilling at Site 795 suggest continuous deposition of hemipelagic sediment since the middle Miocene, with an average linear sedimentation rate (LSR) of ${\sim}5.5\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ for the upper $200\;\mathrm{m}$ (Tada, 1994). This sedimentation rate is low enough to detect the contribution of eolian dust from the Asian continent. The Pliocene–Pleistocene sediment of Site 795 also contains occasional dropstones in the upper $300\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sequence, suggesting its appropriateness for IRD study.  

Site U1422 is the northernmost site of the latitudinal transect targeted by Expedition 346 and is also the deepest site of the depth transect. The location of Site U1422 was selected specifically to identify the timing of the onset of IRD events and to reconstruct temporal variations in its intensity and frequency. Because sea ice formation in this region occurred along the northwestern margin as a result of the strong winter cooling (Talley et al., 2003) that is closely related to the intensity of Siberian High (e.g., Tada, 2004), we expect the intensity of the IRD events to reflect the strength of the EAWM. Therefore, at Site U1422 we hoped to reconstruct the winter monsoon intensity through examination of IRD abundance and distribution along the northern latitudinal transect. At present, stronger winter monsoon wind produces deep water, called Japan Sea Proper Water (JSPW), through sea ice formation in the Japan Basin (Talley et al., 2003). Consequently, sea ice formation and deepwater ventilation could also reflect winter monsoon intensity. Ikehara (2003) described millennial-scale IRD events in the Japan Basin during the last 160 k.y. Correlation of these IRD data with the lightness $(\mathrm{L}^{\star})$ profile of Core MD01-2407 suggests that many of these IRD events coincide with intervals of high $\mathrm{L}^{\star}$ values, further suggesting intense deepwater ventilation that in turn coincides with Heinrich events.  

A composite section and splice were constructed for Site U1422 in an effort to establish a continuous sediment sequence using Holes U1422A–U1422E. Splicing among these holes enabled us to construct a continuous stratigraphic sequence, with the exception of two gaps at ${\sim}85$ and ${\sim}115\,\mathrm{~m~}$ core composite depth below seafloor, Method D (CCSF-D), from the seafloor to the bottom of Core 346-U1422C-18H ( $144.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). From that depth downhole, only sediment from Hole U1422C was recovered. The composite section for Site U1422 consists of four segments, from 0 to ${\sim}85$ , ${\sim}85$ to $\mathord{\sim}115$ , $\mathord{\sim}115$ to $\mathord{\sim}156$ , and $\mathord{\sim}156$ to $217~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-D.  

Although the occurrence of calcareous microfossils is sparse at Site 795 (Tamaki, Pisciotto, Allan, et al., 1990), study of planktonic microfossils may allow examination of the relation between deepwater ventilation and the nature of the influx through the Tsushima Strait and/or the intensity of winter cooling. The site is also appropriate for reconstruction of eolian dust flux, grain size, and provenance changes since $5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , considering the relatively low expected LSR of the site. Although the contribution of IRD to the total terrigenous flux may not be negligible, studies on the specific grain size range of eolian dust $(4-32\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ may differentiate the eolian dust component from IRD and other terrigenous components.  

Drilling at Site U1422 penetrated to a maximum subbottom depth of $205\mathrm{~m~}$ at Hole U1422C, recovering $215.78\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment with a recovery rate of $105\%$ . The shipboard lithostratigraphic program involved visual assessment of sediment composition, color, sedimentary structures, and bioturbation intensity, supplemented by petrographic analysis of smear slides and bulk mineralogic analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD). These were used to describe and define the facies and facies associations from each hole. A total of 212 smear slides were examined from Hole U1422C to help determine lithologic names, whereas fewer samples were taken in Holes U1422D (49) and U1422E (27). From Hole U1422C, 36 samples were selected for XRD analysis for further mineralogic study.  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1422 extends from the Pliocene to Holocene and above ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A closely follows the lithologic sequence previously identified at Site 795, where the lithofacies are dominated by clay, silty clay, and diatomaceous clay with minor volcaniclastic material (Fig. F11). On the other hand, the lithofacies are quite different from those at Site 795 below ${\sim}90\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A because of the numerous intercalations of turbidites.  

The section is divided into two major lithologic units (I and II), distinguished on the basis of sediment composition. Unit I is further divided into two subunits based on the frequency of alternating dark and light color variations. Unit II is distinguished from Unit I based on the significant increase in diatom content. At Site U1422, Unit II is further characterized by the presence of centimeter- to decimeter-scale sandy turbidites (Fig. F12), the frequency of which increases with depth.  

Age assignments at Site U1422 are primarily based on siliceous microfossils (Fig. F13). Radiolarian assemblages show moderate to good preservation except in the interval between 52 and $78\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Radiolarian stratigraphy spans the interval from the $C y$ - cladophora sakaii Zone (Pliocene) to the Botryostrobus aquilonaris Zone (upper Pleistocene). The diatom assemblage is generally moderately to well preserved, although there are several intervals in which valve preservation is poor to moderate. Diatom stratigraphy spans the interval from Zone NPD12 (Pliocene) to Zone NPD7 (upper  

Pleistocene). The nannofossil, radiolarian, and diatom datums and zonal schemes generally agree, with minor inconsistencies.  

The rare occurrence of calcareous microfossils overall reflects dissolution at the seafloor. Calcareous nannofossils are rare and sporadically distributed in the upper $40\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sequence. Planktonic foraminifers are also rare to absent, with moderate to poor preservation throughout most of the succession, yet are abundant in the thin calcareous layers that are interpreted to be turbidites. No in situ planktonic foraminifer zones were documented because of assemblage reworking. Benthic foraminifers occur intermittently throughout the succession and in general are poorly preserved. Overall benthic foraminifer assemblage composition indicates lower bathyal to abyssal paleodepths. The rare occurrence of agglutinated and calcareous benthic foraminifers was perhaps due to unfavorable dysoxic conditions and/or dissolution at the seafloor.  

Paleomagnetism investigations involved analysis of discrete samples and natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measurements of archive-half core sections. Various measurements were made in the different holes in order to accommodate core flow and generate the most useful data set. NRM intensity ranges from $\sim\!10^{-6}$ to $10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Magnetic intensity in Hole U1422C is on the order of $10^{-2}\ \mathrm{A/m}$ in the uppermost ${\sim}7\mathrm{~m~}$ , and intensity gradually decreases with fluctuations from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-6}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ between $\mathord{\sim}7$ and $86\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and then increases toward to the bottom of the hole. The Brunhes/Matuyama polarity transition $(0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and Jaramillo Subchron (C1r.1n) (0.988–1.072 Ma) are identifiable at Site U1422.  

The geochemistry program aimed to characterize interstitial water chemistry and construct an initial geochemical stratigraphy of total organic carbon (TOC) and total inorganic carbon as related to carbonate content. In the upper portion of Unit I, TOC varied from 1 to $4\:\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Below Unit I, TOC values were ${<}1$ wt%. Carbonate content in general was $<\!2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ , except for discrete intervals with elevated values ${>}20\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ . The sulfate–methane transition (SMT), as clearly identified by interstitial water analyses, occurs just below $30\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The methane content of headspace samples also rapidly increased at this level from 100 to ${>}10,000\ \mathrm{ppm}$ . Further analyses of major and minor metals from interstitial water indicate that diagenesis of organic matter and formation of authigenic carbonates dominate downhole geochemical processes.  

Physical property measurements show high variations that reflect the various lithologies and accompanying diagenetic processes (Fig. F8). In Unit I, cyclical variability in density and natural gamma radiation (NGR) appears to be driven by the occurrence of thick, massive, organic-rich dark layers, whereas in Unit II the more subdued variability is largely due to terrigenous clastics from turbidites and biogenic silica from diatoms. Magnetic susceptibility is strongly influenced by redox processes with severe muting of the signal below the SMT. $P$ -wave and shear stress data collection was strongly affected by degassing, which lead to development of microfractures in the core. Reflectance data quantifies the variegated color of the diverse lithostratigraphic packages at this site and provides the opportunity for decimeter- to centimeter-scale correlation for Unit I between this and future sites and other locations.  

Successful temperature measurements were made at five depths using the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3), including the mudline to $115.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1422C. The measured geothermal gradient is $134^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . The calculated heat flow value using this gradient and measured thermal conductivities is $120\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

# Site U1423  

Site U1423 is in the eastern part of the Japan Basin at $41^{\circ}41.95^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $139^{\circ}4.98^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and 1785 mbsl. The site is ${\sim}130~\mathrm{km}$ south of ODP Site 796 and ${\sim}100~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the entrance of the Tsugaru Strait (Fig. F8). Site U1423 is situated on a terrace on the middle of the slope from Oshima Island, a small volcanic island $30\,\mathrm{km}$ to the southeast. The site is under the direct influence of the TWC that flows further north beyond the Tsugaru Strait toward the Soya Strait (Yoon and Kim, 2009). Because the sill depth of the Soya Strait is only $55\;\mathrm{m}$ , the influence of the TWC on the site should have been significantly affected by glacioeustatic sea level changes during the Quaternary. Although Site U1423 is relatively close to Site 796, the tectonic setting of the two sites seems different. Site 796 has been directly influenced by west–east compression caused by incipient subduction along the nearby plate boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates (Tamaki, Suyehiro, Allan, McWilliams, et al., 1992). In contrast, Site U1423 seems less influenced by this compression because seismic profiles (Tada et al., 2013) suggest conformable deposition for at least for the last $\mathrm{-}5\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ . (upper $300\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment). Relatively low LSRs are anticipated based on results from the site survey. The rates are likely to be low enough to detect the contribution of eolian dust from the Asian continent. Analyses of a site survey core confirm occasional dropstones in the upper $150\textrm{m}$ of the sequence, suggesting its appropriateness for studies of IRD.  

Site U1423 is the middle site of the latitudinal transect targeted by Expedition 346 and is also the middle depth site of the depth transect. The location of Site U1423 was selected to identify the spatial extent of IRD events and their temporal variations. Because sea ice formation in the northwestern margin of the Japan Basin occurred as a result of strong winter cooling by EAWM wind (Talley et al., 2003), we expect the intensity of the IRD events to reflect the strength of the EAWM. At Site U1423, we hoped to reconstruct EAWM intensity through examination of IRD abundance and distribution along the northern latitudinal transect in the marginal sea. Because stronger EAWM wind produces deep water (JSPW) through sea ice formation in the northwestern part of the Japan Basin (Talley et al., 2003), sea ice formation and deepwater ventilation could also reflect EAWM intensity.  

Because of the relatively shallow water depth of Site U1423, calcareous microfossils were expected to be relatively well preserved. Planktonic microfossils may allow us to study the nature and strength of the influx of the TWC through the Tsushima Strait and/or the intensity of winter cooling, whereas study of benthic microfossils may allow us to study the nature of the deep water (e.g., oxygenation, saturation level with respect to ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ , temperature, and salinity). Examination of the relation between surface water and deepwater characteristics may allow us to explore the linkage between the nature of the TWC and deepwater ventilation. Furthermore, comparison of $C a C O_{3}$ burial flux and its temporal changes at this site to those at Site U1422 will allow us to reconstruct behavior of the calcium carbonate compensation depth (CCD).  

The site is also appropriate for reconstruction of eolian dust flux, grain size, and provenance changes since $5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , considering the relatively low expected LSR. Although only a slight contribution of IRD to the total terrigenous flux may be expected, the specific grain size of eolian dust $(4{-}32\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ ) may be used to differentiate the eolian dust component from other terrigenous components, including IRD.  

# Main results  

Three holes were drilled at Site U1423. Hole U1423A was cored using the APC system to $206.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Similarly, Hole U1423B was cored with the APC to $249.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Hole U1423C was drilled without coring to $114~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. From this depth to $180\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, we cut and recovered six cores in a series of alternating drilled and cored intervals with the objective of filling gaps in APC cores recovered from the previous two holes. Real-time stratigraphic correlation indicated that the carefully orchestrated drilling/coring operation was successful. Downhole measurements were carried out in Hole U1423B using a modified version of the paleo-combo tool string and the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string. A total of 56 cores were obtained, providing $502.6\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ( $105.2\%$ recovery).  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1423 extends from the Pliocene to Holocene and is dominated by clay, silty clay, and diatomaceous ooze with discrete foraminifer-bearing clay levels. Volcaniclastic material represents a minor component throughout the sediment succession, except in tephra layers where it is the dominant component.  

The section is divided into two major lithologic units distinguished on the basis of sediment composition and particularly the biosiliceous fraction content. Unit I, from 0 to \~ $130\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, is further divided into two subunits based on the relative frequency of alternating dark and light color variations and the intensity of bioturbation (Fig. F14).  

Lithologic Unit I consists of Holocene to the lowest Pleistocene silty clay and clay, with lesser amounts of diatom-bearing and diatom-rich silty clay, and rare calcareous layers containing abundant foraminifers. Discrete tephra (volcanic ash) layers ranging in thickness from a few millimeters to ${>}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ are numerous. The total thickness of tephra layers in each core reaches a maximum in lower Subunit IA to Subunit IB. Pyrite is a minor component in most lithologies, whereas fine-grained tephra occurs as a dispersed component throughout much of the section. Unit I can be characterized primarily as fine-grained material derived from terrigenous sources.  

Color banding, suggested to be related to variable contents of organic matter and pyrite, is the most diagnostic feature of Unit I, with dark gray to dark olive-gray organicrich intervals scattered between light green to light greenish gray organic-poor intervals.  

Lithologic Unit II is dominantly composed of moderate to heavily bioturbated diatomaceous silty clay, clay, and diatom ooze. Unit II is distinguished from Unit I on the basis of a significant increase in diatom content relative to terrigenous material from top to bottom. Color banding is less common in Unit II than in Unit I and nearly disappears in the lower part of the unit. Sediment of Unit II is moderately to heavily bioturbated and often shows mottled facies.  

Microfossil abundance and preservation at Site U1423 varies depending on whether microfossils are siliceous or calcareous. The nannofossil, radiolarian, and diatom datums and zonal schemes generally agree with only minor inconsistencies, and the biostratigraphic zonation ranges from Pliocene to upper Pleistocene (Fig. F15).  

Calcareous nannofossils are generally rare or absent yet are sporadically distributed throughout. Planktonic foraminifers are rare to absent, with moderate to poor preservation, except in the upper part of the succession, where they are abundant. As such, the regional planktonic foraminiferal datums and zonal schemes only have limited application. Radiolarians are generally common to abundant, and diatoms are well preserved with abundances ranging from $2\%{-}5\%$ to ${>}60\%$ . Diatom mats and ooze are found in the Pliocene samples. Benthic foraminifers occur intermittently throughout the succession, exhibiting marked changes in abundance, preservation, and species assemblage. The overall assemblage composition indicates bathyal paleodepths. The assemblage composition reflects variations in organic export flux to the seafloor and deepwater oxygenation.  

Operations during the occupation of Site U1423 were ideal for coring, including very low sediment expansion $(\sim\!4\%)$ and calm seas. These conditions allowed us to target and recover selected intervals in Hole U1423C where coring gaps aligned across Holes U1423A and U1423B. This approach saved considerable time compared to continuously coring all of Hole U1423C. The resulting Site U1423 splice covers the entire length of overlap among holes at this site, from the seafloor to $218.8\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-D. Sedimentation rates at this site vary as a function of lithology (Fig. F15). Unit I (silty clay and clay) is characterized by low sedimentation rates on the order of $30{-}40\ \mathrm{m/m.y.},$ , whereas Unit II (diatomaceous silty clay and clay and diatom ooze) has higher rates (up to $82\;\mathrm{m/m.y.})$ , presumably reflecting siliceous productivity.  

The geochemical profiles at Site U1423 are dominated by degradation of organic material and formation and alteration of carbonate phases. These processes affect a number of dissolved species, such as Mn, which is liberated as $M\mathrm{n}^{2+}$ at shallow depths and depleted at deeper depths by the formation of carbonate minerals such as rhodochrosite. Additionally, Ba is presumably released from barite at the SMT. Methane concentrations are related to changes in sedimentation rate and are overall much lower than at Site U1422.  

Physical property measurements generally show trends that follow lithostratigraphy (Fig. F14). Magnetic susceptibility, bulk density, and NGR total counts have higher values in lithologic Unit I than Unit II, whereas porosity and water content show an opposite trend. $P$ -wave velocity and shear strength gradually increase with depth because of sediment compaction. Color reflectance shows higher variation in Unit I than Unit II and is closely related to the lithology of the former, which consists of alternating very dark brown to black organic-rich bands and lighter olive to green hemipelagic sediment.  

Paleomagnetism investigations mainly focused on measuring NRM of archive halves before and after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ alternating field (AF) demagnetization. NRM of core sections in Holes U1423B and U1423C was only measured after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. We also measured NRM for seven selected discrete samples after stepwise AF demagnetization up to a peak field of $60\;\mathrm{mT}.$ . NRM intensity of the measured core sections after $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization is on the order of $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ for the uppermost $\sim\!22\,\mathrm{m}$ and decreases to $\sim\!10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ below $\sim\!22\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The Brunhes/Matuyama transition $(0.781\,\mathrm{~Ma})$ was found at $54\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1423A and $52\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1423B, whereas the Matuyama/Gauss boundary (2.581 Ma) was found at $113\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1423A and at $112\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1423B.  

Downhole measurements were made in Hole U1423B to $251\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. FMS images were of excellent quality because of the good borehole conditions and sea state during logging operations (Fig. F16). The combination of logs closely reflects lithologic changes in the recovered cores, including ash layers. A distinct change in log characteristics occurs at ${\sim}124\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, which correlates closely with the lithologic Subunit IIA/IIB boundary and with a change downhole to a more diatomaceous rich lithology. Preliminary inspection also revealed apparent cyclicity in some parts of the section that will require further study.  

# Site U1424  

Site U1424 is in the southeastern margin of the Japan Basin at $40^{\circ}11.40^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $138^{\circ}13.90^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and $2808~\mathrm{mbsl}$ . The site is at the same location as ODP Site 794 and is ${\sim}200~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of the entrance of the Tsugaru Strait (Fig. F8). Site U1424 is near the boundary between the Japan and the Yamato Basins and ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the submarine Toyama Channel that extends from the central part of Honshu Island. The site is mainly under the influence of the second branch of the TWC and close to the present position where the third branch merges with the second branch of the TWC during the present summer. Previous drilling at Site 794 revealed that the site is characterized by very slow $({\sim}30\mathrm{~m/m.y.})$ yet continuous sedimentation during the last 4 m.y. (Tada, 1994), which is ideal to detect the contribution of eolian dust from the Asian continent. Preliminary examination of the Pleistocene sediment also suggests possible occurrence of IRD. IRD may contribute to the total terrigenous flux in several intervals; however, the grain size range of eolian dust $(4-32\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ and grain morphology may allow differentiation of the eolian dust component from other terrigenous components.  

Site U1424 is the southernmost site of the northern half of the latitudinal transect targeted by Expedition 346, and is also the second deepest site of the depth transect. The location of Site U1424 was selected specifically to identify the southern limit of IRD events. Together with the results from Sites U1422 and U1423, identification of IRD events at this site and correlation with previous sites will allow us to reconstruct temporal changes in the southern limit of sea ice in the Japan and Yamato Basins during the last $4\;\mathrm{m.y}$ .  

The site is also useful to reconstruct changes in deepwater oxygenation and CCD during the last $4\,\mathrm{\m.y.}$ , particularly because Site U1424 is the second deepest site drilled during Expedition 346. At the deepest site previously drilled during this expedition, Site U1422, this objective was negatively impacted by the presence of numerous turbidites in the interval older than ${\sim}2.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Main results  

Three holes were cored at Site U1424. Coring reached maximum depth in Hole U1424A, penetrating to $158.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and recovering $161\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment $(101\%)$ . Coring in Hole U1424B penetrated to $154.7\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $155.4\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment $(100\%)$ . Hole U1424C was cored to $63.9\;\mathrm{m}$ , with a recovery of $64.4\mathrm{~m~}(101\%)$ .  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1424 closely follows the succession previously identified in the upper part of Site 794 and extends from the Pliocene to Holocene. Lithofacies are dominated by clay, silty clay, and diatomaceous ooze, revealing the predominance of both pelagic and hemipelagic sedimentation. Volcaniclastic material represents a minor component throughout the sediment succession, except in tephra (volcanic ash) layers (Fig. F17). The section is divided into two major lithologic units (I and II) distinguished on the basis of sediment composition. Unit I (lower Pleistocene–Holocene) consists of clay and silty clay with small amounts of diatom-bearing, diatom-rich, and foraminifer-bearing clay. Unit I is further divided into two subunits (IA and IB) based on the frequency of alternating dark brown (organic rich) and light greenish gray (organic poor) clay intervals. Unit II (Pliocene– lower Pleistocene) is distinguished from Unit I based on significant increases in diatom content and bioturbation and is further divided into Subunits IIA and IIB. Subunit IIA is composed of heavily bioturbated diatom-bearing and diatom-rich clay, whereas Subunit IIB is predominantly composed of moderate to heavy bioturbated diatom ooze. A few turbidite deposits are observed in Subunit IIA and in the upper part of Subunit IIB.  

Calcareous nannofossils occur intermittently between 5 and $30\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Planktonic foraminifers are mainly common to abundant in core catcher samples and thin carbonate layers above $40\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A but are rare to absent with moderate to poor preservation below $40\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Benthic foraminifers are absent above $33\textrm{m}$ CSF-A and occasionally present below this depth, generally showing poor preservation. The overall assemblage composition indicates lower bathyal to abyssal paleodepths. The sporadic occurrence of calcareous microfossils below $30\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A most likely reflects dissolution.  

Radiolarian assemblages show good preservation (except between 54 and 64 m CSF-A), and their biostratigraphic zonation ranges from the Larcopyle pylomaticus Zone (Pliocene) to the Botryostrobus aquilonaris Zone (upper Pleistocene). Diatom preservation is good throughout the cored interval. Diatom abundance is low in most of the upper part of the succession and increases downhole below $83\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. The diatom stratigraphy spans the interval from Zone NPD12 (Pliocene) to Zone NPD7 (upper Pleistocene). The presence of freshwater diatom species and phytoliths might be related to freshwater input and/or wind transportation.  

Paleomagnetism investigations focused on measuring NRM of archive halves. NRM of archive-half core sections of 17 APC cores in Hole U1424A was measured before and after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. Because of increased core flow through the paleomagnetism station, NRM of the 17 APC cores in Hole U1424B and 4 APC cores from Hole U1424C was only measured after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. The FlexIT tool was successfully deployed to orient 16 APC cores in Hole U1424A starting from Core 346-U1424A-2H. We measured seven discrete samples collected from varying depths in Hole U1424A before and after stepwise AF demagnetization, with peak fields up to $60\;\mathrm{mT},$ , to verify the archive-half core section measurements and to determine the demagnetization behavior of the recovered sediment. NRM intensity of the archive-half core section measurement after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization in all three holes is similar in magnitude for overlapping intervals, mostly ranging from $\sim\!10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . For the uppermost ${\sim}25\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment, NRM intensity is on the order of $10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . From $\sim\!25\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to the bottom of the holes, NRM intensity is on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Inclination and orientation-corrected declination data from the measured holes indicate that Site U1424 recorded almost all major reversals during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The top and bottom of the Jaramillo (0.988–1.072 Ma) and the Olduvai (1.778–1.945 Ma) Subchrons are recorded in all three holes. In Holes U1424A and U1424B, we identified the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary $(0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), the Matuyama/Gauss boundary $(2.581\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), and the Gauss/ Gilbert boundary $(3.596\,\mathrm{\;Ma})$ ) as well as the Mammoth Subchron (3.207–3.33 Ma) (Fig. F18).  

A composite section and splice were constructed for Site U1424 to establish a continuous sediment sequence using Holes U1424A– U1424C, which were cored to 158.8, 154.7, and $63.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, respectively. In Hole U1424C, only Cores 346-U1424C-4H to 7H were subject to stratigraphic correlation because Cores 1H to 3H were fully sampled for OSL dating and no onboard measurements were conducted. Splicing among these holes enabled us to construct a continuous stratigraphic sequence for the entire interval. Estimated sedimentation rates, based on biostratigraphy, paleomagnestratigraphy, and preliminary tephra identification, range from 14 to $41\ \mathrm{m/m.y.}$ , with the highest sedimentation rates being characteristic of Subunits IA and IB (Fig. F19).  

The lower flux of organic material to Site U1424 distinguishes it from other sites drilled in the marginal sea during Expedition 346. Microbially mediated oxidation of organic material is one of the main controls on the geochemical profiles. No SMT boundary exists at this site, and methane is orders of magnitude lower than at other sites. Sulfate concentrations decrease, but sulfate is still present at depth, implying that sulfate is the final electron acceptor to oxidize organic material. Near the seafloor, Mn and Fe concentrations increase as their oxide forms are reduced to degrade organic material (Fig. F20), but other processes such as authigenic clay formation may also influence the Fe profile Phosphate and alkalinity increase with depth, but their maximum concentrations never exceed ${\sim}65~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ and ${\sim}14\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}$ , respectively. The presence of carbonates is minimal, but alteration of volcanic ash layers and basement basalt influence the Ca, $\mathrm{Mg}.$ , and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Sr}}$ profiles. These processes could also impact the concentrations of Si and Li in the sediment, although Si and Li seem to respond more to the dissolution of diatoms throughout the sediment column. Interstitial water analyses for samples obtained by squeezing whole rounds and Rhizon syringes agree well for most, but not all, elements and provide higher resolution at shallow depths.  

Physical properties at Site U1424 are largely similar to those at Sites U1422 and U1423. They display the pattern typical of this marginal sea’s sediment, with Unit I (Pleistocene to Holocene) exhibiting cyclical variability driven by alternating organicrich and organic-poor layers that transition into Unit II (Pliocene), which has a more subdued variability largely caused by alternating hemipelagic and biogenic silica-rich sediment. Compared to previous Expedition 346 sites, Site U1424 magnetic susceptibility is less influenced by redox processes, whereas $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocity and shear stress data show consistent increasing trends downhole caused by decreased degassing. Reflectance data capture the lithologic and diagenetic variability well at the decimeter to centimeter scale.  

Downhole temperature measurements were made at the seafloor and at $35\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A using the APCT-3. The measurements are in good agreement with the in situ temperature data acquired at the same location during Leg 127, confirming a geothermal gradient of $125^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

# Site U1425  

Site U1425 is on the Yamato Rise at $39^{\circ}29.44^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $134^{\circ}26.55^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and 1909 mbsl (Fig. F1). The site is situated in the central part of a northeast-southwest–oriented graben in the middle of the rise. Site U1425 is ${\sim}60~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of ODP Site 799, which also sits within the graben (Fig. F8). A major difference between these two sites is that Site 799 is in the deepest part of the graben and Site U1425 is on a terrace that is one step higher than the bottom of the graben (Fig. F21). The high topographic setting of Site U1425 was chosen to minimize the influence of turbiditic processes, which were significant at Site 799.  

Site U1425 is the northernmost site of the southern half of the Expedition 346 latitudinal transect and the middepth site of the depth transect. Preliminary site survey results suggested that Site U1425 was characterized by very slow yet continuous sedimentation $(4\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.})$ during the last $600\ \mathrm{k.y.}$ ., which is ideal for detecting the contribution of eolian dust from the Asian continent. Based on the relatively low geothermal gradient of ${\sim}100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ (as observed at nearby Site 799), the opal-A/opal-CT boundary at Site U1425 was predicted to be at ${\sim}400\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Ingle, Suyehiro, von Breymann, et al., 1990). We expected this to allow recovery of unconsolidated sediment back to $10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ or older, permitting reconstruction of eolian dust flux and provenance changes over this period. In combination with the other Expedition 346 sites, it will be possible to reconstruct changes in the position of the atmospheric Westerly Jet stream axis during the last ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{m.y}$ .  

Site U1425 is on the Subpolar Front and under the influence of the first branch of the TWC during summer. Sediment from Site U1425 will be used to reconstruct sea-surface temperature changes associated with the north–south movement of the Subpolar Front, which is considered to be influenced by the strength of the TWC (Isoda, 2011). In addition, the sea ice margin may have reached the site location during glacial periods, and the sedimentary record at this site will help constrain the southern limit of IRD events. Together with results from Sites U1422–U1424, Site U1425 will enable us to reconstruct temporal changes in the southern limit of sea ice in the marginal sea during the last $4\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ Lastly, we will reconstruct changes in deepwater oxygenation and CCD during the last $4\;\mathrm{m}$ .y. by combining results from the Expedition 346 depth transect sites.  

# Main results  

Site U1425 was occupied at two different times during Expedition 346, first following operations at Site U1424 and 3 weeks later after completing operations at all primary sites of the expedition. Return to Site U1425 was possible because all scientific and operations objectives were met ${\sim}5$ days before the end of the expedition, and the remaining time available was spent reoccupying this and another important site (U1427) drilled earlier in the expedition. Therefore, we drilled Hole U1425E during the revisit.  

Coring operations at Site U1425 included drilling five holes using the full and half APC and the extended core barrel (XCB) systems. Hole U1425A was terminated after the first core because the core barrel was recovered full, missing a reliable seafloor determination. Hole U1425B was cored to $407.2\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Hole U1425C was cored only to $25\textrm{m}$ CSF-A because this hole was dedicated for postexpedition OSL dating. Hole U1425D was cored to $431\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and Hole U1425E was cored to $113.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. A total of 148 cores recovered $955.5\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment. In Hole U1425B, four formation temperature measurements were performed and downhole wire log data were obtained to $403.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1425 extends from the Miocene to the Holocene and is dominated by clay, silty clay, diatom ooze, and claystone (Fig. F22). There are numerous discrete tephra (i.e., volcanic ash) layers throughout the sediment record, and volcaniclastic material represents a minor component of the lithology. The section is divided into three major lithologic units (I–III), distinguished on the basis of sediment composition and in particular the abundance of biosiliceous and clay fractions.  

Unit I (mid- to upper Pleistocene to Holocene) consists of clay and silty clay with small amounts of diatom-bearing and diatom-rich clay. Unit I is further divided into two subunits (IA and IB) based on the frequency of alternating dark brown (organic rich) and light greenish gray (organic poor) clay intervals. The regularity of this color banding decreases from Subunit IA to IB.  

Unit II (upper Miocene to lower Pleistocene) is distinguished from Unit I based on a significant increase in diatom content relative to terrigenous material, as well as an increase in the degree of bioturbation. This unit is further divided into two subunits (IIA and IIB). Subunit IIA is composed of diatom-bearing and diatom-rich clay that fluctuates in clay content. This is reflected by regular color banding in Subunit IIA. Subunit IIB is dominated by brownish diatom ooze, with diatoms making up to ${>}70\%$ of the sediment. Well-lithified dolomite beds and concretions are also present throughout Unit II.  

Unit III (Miocene) is divided into two subunits. Subunit IIIA is composed of alternating layers of heavily bioturbated diatom ooze, clayey diatom ooze, and diatom-rich clay. These lithofacies show decimeter- to meter-scale variability between dark gray and gray, but the changes in color can be subtle. There are very few sedimentary structures within Subunit IIIA, although an excellent example of finely laminated diatom ooze ${\sim}1.5\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) is observed in both Holes U1425B and U1425D ( ${\sim}275\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A; Fig. F23). These laminations (of approximately middle Miocene age) occur within a dark organic-rich layer in Subunit IIIA and are not seen elsewhere in the sediment sequence during the Miocene. Subunit IIIB is characterized by gray siliceous claystone with occasional parallel laminations, burrows, and carbonate concretions. The transition from Subunit IIIA to IIIB is defined by the diagenetic loss of biosiliceous material and the formation of siliceous claystone. Below this transition, evidence exists for dissolution of biogenic opal-A and reprecipitation of opal-CT. However, poor recovery in Subunit IIIB makes detailed description of lithologic changes difficult.  

Thirty seven datums were identified based on siliceous and calcareous microfossils. Nannofossils are present in Pleistocene sediment above ${\sim}56\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A but are absent or rare below this depth. Radiolarians are generally common to abundant throughout the sequence, although they are rare or absent below $351.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Diatom abundance is generally low above ${\sim}66\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and increases downhole. The scarcity of freshwater diatoms combined with high abundances of phytoliths suggests wind transportation from land. The complete dissolution of diatoms and the rare occurrence of radiolarians near the base of the succession coincide with the opal-A/opal  

CT boundary. Planktonic foraminifers are mainly confined to the upper part of the succession (above ${\sim}131\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), generally indicating cold and restricted environments. Benthic foraminifers indicate bathyal paleodepths throughout the Pleistocene to Miocene succession. The highly variable composition of the benthic assemblages suggests episodic oxygen depletion and intense carbonate dissolution at the seafloor, particularly during the Pliocene and Miocene.  

A composite section and splice were constructed using Holes U1425B and U1425D to establish a continuous sediment sequence, with the exception of three potential gaps, from the seafloor to the bottom of Core 346-U1425B-51H ( $336.91\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). From that depth downhole, poor core recovery in both holes prohibited us from constructing a composite section. The sedimentation rate at Site U1425 ranges from 25.7 to $64.8\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{y}.$ and is lower in Subunits IB and IIA and the middle of Subunit IA, moderate in Subunit IA, and higher in the upper and lower parts of Subunit IIB and Unit III (Fig. F24).  

Similar to previous sites drilled during Expedition 346, accumulation of organic matter and its subsequent microbial diagenesis strongly affects the geochemistry at Site U1425. Sediment in the upper ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ averages ${\sim}1~\mathrm{wt\%}$ organic carbon. In the upper $1\textrm{m},$ , reactions between this organic matter and metal oxides lead to maxima in dissolved Mn and Fe along with increases in bicarbonate, ammonium, and phosphate. With continued burial, organic matter reacts with dissolved sulfate, which releases additional bicarbonate, ammonium, and phosphate to interstitial water. Much of the organic matter decomposition at Site U1425 occurs through sulfate reduction, as evident by the detailed concave-upward sulfate profile that extends to zero concentration at $60\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Below $60\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, methane concentrations slowly rise, eventually surpassing shipboard (1 atm) saturation conditions at ${\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Dissolved silica concentrations steadily increase downhole until ${\sim}320\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, where they decrease rapidly, presumably as opal-A transforms to opal-CT.  

Physical properties trends measured at Site U1425 generally follow lithostratigraphy. Magnetic susceptibility, bulk density, and NGR have higher values in lithologic Unit I than in Unit II, whereas porosity and water content show an opposite trend. $P\cdot$ -wave velocity and shear strength generally increase with depth because of sediment compaction, although shear strength data are highly scattered in the highly diatomaceous layers below ${\sim}80\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Color reflectance shows higher variation in Unit I than Unit II, and the variations are closely related to the lithology of Unit I, which consists of alternating very dark brown to black organic-rich sediment and lighter olive to green hemipelagic sediment. All physical property values, with the exception of magnetic susceptibility and grain density, are substantially different through the transition between Subunits IIIA and IIIB, which coincides with the opal-A/opal-CT boundary. Bulk density, NGR, and $P$ -wave velocity increase, with complementary decreases in porosity and water content. Through the opal-A/opal-CT boundary, the physical properties change as follows: gamma ray attenuation bulk density increases by $0.23\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , discrete bulk density increases by $0.22\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , NGR counts increase by 12.2 cps, $P$ -wave velocity increases by $52.6\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{}}$ , porosity decreases by $13.1\%$ , and water content decreases by $15.6\%$ .  

Paleomagnetism studies focused on measuring NRM of archive halves. NRM of archive-half core sections in Hole U1425B was measured before and after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. Because of increased core flow, NRM of core sections in Hole U1425D was only measured after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. The FlexIT tool was successfully deployed to orient 12 APC cores in Hole U1425B starting from Core 346-U1425D-2H. We measured 35 discrete samples collected from varying depths in Hole U1425B before and after stepwise AF demagnetization, with peak fields up to $60\,\mathrm{mT},$ , to verify the archive-half core section measurements and to determine the demagnetization behavior of the sediment. NRM intensity of the measured core sections after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization is on the order of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}\ \mathrm{A/m}$ for the uppermost ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and decreases downhole to $\sim\!10^{-5}$ to $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ below ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary $(0.781\,\mathrm{Ma})$ was recorded at ${\sim}33.7\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1425B and at ${\sim}34.2\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1425D. Both the Jaramillo $(0.988{-}1.072\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and Olduvai (1.778– $1.945\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) Subchrons were identified. The Matuyama/Gauss boundary $(2.581\,\mathrm{Ma})$ was recorded at ${\sim}87.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1425B and at ${\sim}85.2\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1425D. Below ${\sim}110\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in both holes, NRM intensity is weak and is generally on the order of $10^{-5}\ \mathrm{A/m}$ . Increased coring disturbance, strong drill string overprint, and the largely scattered paleomagnetic directions make magnetostratigraphic interpretation difficult for the deep part of the holes.  

Downhole wireline log measurements were made in Hole U1425B to $403.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A using the paleo-combo tool string, which recorded spectral gamma ray, caliper, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and lithologic density logs, and the FMS-sonic tool string, which recorded resistivity images of the borehole, sonic velocities, and NGR data (Fig. F25). Each logging tool string was run twice in the hole to ensure the quality of the logging data. The logged interval was divided into three logging units (Unit 1, from the base of the drill pipe to $244~\mathrm{m}$ wireline depth below seafloor [WSF]; Unit 2, from 244 to $338\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{WSF}$ ; and Unit 3, $338\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{WSF}$ to the bottom of the hole). The combination of logs closely reflects the lithologic changes in the recovered cores, including dolomite and ash layers. Preliminary inspection of the data also revealed apparent cyclicities in the logs collected by the two logging tool strings below ${\sim}244\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, mainly reflecting variation in diatom content relative to terrigenous clay. A shift toward higher density and resistivity at ${\sim}340~\mathrm{m}~\mathrm{WSF}$ corresponds to the diagenetic boundary from biogenic opal-A to opal-CT. Successful formation temperature measurements were made using the APCT-3 at four depths, including the mudline, downhole to $94.3~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1425B. The measured geothermal gradient was $104^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}_{\cdot}$ , and the calculated heat flow value was $96\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . This geothermal gradient is slightly higher than the $98^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km}$ value calculated for Site 799.  

# Site U1426  

Site U1426 is in the Yamato Basin at $37^{\circ}2.00^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $134^{\circ}48.00^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and 903 mbsl (Fig. F1). The site is situated near the top of the Oki Ridge, which extends southwest–northeast and bounds the southern margin of the Yamato Basin. Site U1426 is at the same location as ODP Site 798, ${\sim}150\,\mathrm{km}$ north of Honshu Island (Fig. F8). The bathymetric setting of Site U1426 was chosen to minimize the influence of turbidites.  

Site U1426 is under the influence of the second branch of the TWC, which is a highly meandering current characterized by eddies (Hase et al., 1999). Previous results from Site 798 as well as from a piston core retrieved from almost the same location as Site U1426 during the site survey cruise suggest an average sedimentation rate of ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{\m/m.y.}$ (Ingle, Suehiro, von Breymann, et al., 1990). These rates are slightly higher than those found at previous Sites U1423–U1425, but they are still low enough to detect the contribution of eolian dust from the Asian continent, considering the relatively large contribution of biogenic materials at this site. Based on a moderate geothermal gradient of ${\sim}110^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ (as observed at Site 798), the opal-A/ opal-CT boundary at Site U1426 was predicted to be at ${\sim}400\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Ingle, Suehiro, von Breymann, et al., 1990). We expected this to allow recovery of unconsolidated sediment back to at least $4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , permitting reconstruction of eolian dust flux and provenance over this period in the southern part of the study region. The relatively shallow depth of Site U1426 was also expected to provide better preservation of calcareous microfossils.  

Located in the middle of the southern half of the Expedition 346 latitudinal transect, Site U1426 lies at a relatively shallow depth in the expedition depth transect. Together with results from Sites U1423–U1425, Site U1426 will enable us to reconstruct changes in the position of the atmospheric Westerly Jet axis during the last ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ . and sea-surface temperature changes associated with the north–south movement of the Subpolar Front, as it is related to the strength of the TWC (Isoda, 2011). Finally, we will reconstruct changes in deepwater oxygenation and CCD during the last $4\,\mathrm{m.y.}$ . by combining results from the Expedition 346 depth transect sites.  

# Main results  

Four holes were cored at Site U1426 using the full and half APC and the XCB systems. Holes U1426A and U1426C were cored to 396.7 and $204\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered 418.8 m $(106\%)$ and $211.9\mathrm{~m~}(104\%)$ of core, respectively. Hole U1426B was cored to only $34.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A because this hole was dedicated to high-resolution geochemical analyses. Hole U1426D was cored to only $99.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in order to recover additional material from the upper part of the section. A total of 95 APC and 2 XCB cores were obtained with a recovery of $770.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ( $105\%$ core recovery). Four formation temperature measurements were performed in Hole U1426A.  

The sediment succession at Site U1426 extends from the Pliocene to the Holocene and consists of clay and silty clay with varying contents of biogenic silica; foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils; and diatom, biosiliceous, and nannofossil ooze. These lithologies are interbedded with tephra layers. The sediment succession is divided into two lithologic units (Fig. F26) based on sedimentary structures and sediment composition and is similar to that observed at Sites U1422–U1425. At Site U1426, Unit I shows alternations of clay and diatom-rich clay to diatom ooze. Subunit IA shows characteristic centimeter- to decimeter-scale alternations of diatomrich clay and clay with a distinct dark–light color banding. These alternating layers are somewhat less pronounced than at Site U1425. In contrast, Subunit IB is characterized by $3{-}5\mathrm{~m}$ scale alternations of clay with diatom and nannofossil ooze; only subtle color changes were observed between major lithologies. Unit II is characterized by thick intervals of diatom ooze and clay and shows less frequent lithologic and color variations.  

Nannofossils are present shallower than $182.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A but are absent or rare in deeper sediment. Planktonic foraminifers are mainly confined to the upper part of the succession (above ${\sim}172~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), exhibiting good preservation above ${\sim}99\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and moderate to poor preservation from $\sim\!172$ to ${\sim}170\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages above ${\sim}172\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A generally indicate temperate to subarctic environments with intermittent incursions of subtropical species. Benthic foraminifers occur intermittently throughout the succession, showing marked variations in abundance and preservation. The overall assemblage composition indicates bathyal paleodepths. The highly variable composition of the assemblages suggests fluctuating organic fluxes to the seafloor with episodic oxygen depletion and intense carbonate dissolution, particularly during the Pliocene. Radiolarians are generally common to abundant in the sequence, except deeper than ${\sim}289\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, where they are rare or absent. Diatom preservation is good throughout the succession, although extreme diatom dissolution occurs below $392.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Overall, diatom abundances are high at this site and include few or rare species believed to prefer warm-water conditions (Fig. F27). Twenty six datums are documented (six nannofossil, four planktonic foraminifer, ten radiolarian, and six diatom). These datums generally agree with only some minor inconsistencies (Fig. F28).  

Stratigraphic correlation produced a complete splice spanning the entire length of overlap between the two deep holes drilled (Holes U1426A and U1426D). The splice covers $0{-}236.2\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-D ( $0{-}210.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). Cores not used in the splice, including cores from Hole U1426B, which was dedicated to geochemical analyses, and some cores from Hole U1426D, which was drilled to recover additional sediment from the upper $100\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , were also mapped into the splice at centimeter-scale resolution. A preliminary age model was produced using micropaleontological, tephra, and paleomagnetism datums (Fig. F28). Sediment at ${\sim}400\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A approaches ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ in age. Sedimentation rates vary from ${\sim}90$ to $115\;\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ . and are consistent with changes in lithology; Subunit IB (\~125–281 m CSF-A) has slightly higher rates than Subunits IA and IIA, most likely because of the increased biological productivity or enhanced preservation.  

Physical properties are significantly different from the previous deepwater sites of Expedition 346, except that sediment in Unit I shows a similar high variability in lithologic composition and thus physical properties. In Unit I, cyclical changes in physical properties appear to be driven not only by the binary mixture of organic matter and hemipelagic sediment but also by the addition of carbonate and possibly a reduction in the formation in authigenic pyrite. Compared to Sites U1422–U1425, the more abundant clay appears to overtake organic matter as the main factor influencing NGR variability. Magnetic susceptibility is low, but magnetic carriers appear sturdy enough to preserve a good paleomagnetic signal. Four formation temperature measurements were made using the APCT-3 downhole to $116.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1426A. The geothermal gradient was $115^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ , and the heat flow was $94\mathrm{\;mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

Paleomagnetic studies focused on measuring NRM of archive halves. NRM of archivehalf core sections in Hole U1426A was measured before and after $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. Due to increased core flow, NRM of core sections from Holes U1426B, U1426C, and U1426D were only measured after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. The FlexIT tool was successfully deployed to orient 25 APC cores in Hole U1426A beginning with Core 346-U1426A-2H. NRM intensity of the measured core sections after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization mostly ranges between $\sim\!10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m};$ values are close to ${\sim}10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ for the top ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{m}$ , except from ${\sim}60$ to $80\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A where values decrease to $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary $(0.781\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is recorded at 81.5 m CSF-A in Hole U1426A, $74.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1426C, and $80.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1426D. Both the Jaramillo $(0.988{-}1.072\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and Olduvai Subchrons were identified in Holes U1426A and U1426C. The Matuyama/Gauss boundary $(2.581\,\mathrm{~Ma})$ is recorded at ${\sim}254.6\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1426A. Sediments recovered from deeper than ${\sim}260\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A at Site U1426 have mostly positive inclinations that are apparently steeper than the expected normal polarity dipole value. Increased coring disturbance, a strong drilling overprint, the lack of core orientation, and the large scatter in paleomagnetic declinations makes magnetostratigraphic interpretations difficult deeper than ${\sim}260\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

Site U1426 is characterized by relatively high contents of organic carbon $({\sim}2\ \mathrm{wt\%})$ and carbonate (up to $25\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) compared to the previous Expedition 346 sites. A rapid decrease of dissolved Fe and Mn near the seafloor indicates reactions between organic matter and metal oxides, leading to increases in alkalinity, ammonium, and phosphate. The shallow SMT occurs at ${\sim}8\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. A marked change in the slope of the alkalinity profile, constant concentration of dissolved $\mathrm{NH}_{4}+$ , and maximum in dissolved sulfide $\mathrm{(HS^{-})}$ at the SMT are indicative of shallow AOM. The degradation of the large amount of organic carbon at depth drives methanogenesis. The upward flux of methane toward the seafloor reacts with sulfate during AOM. The low values of the methane to ethane ratio, with the occurrence of propane at depth, suggest the possibility of thermogenic methane near the bottom of the recovered sequence.  

# Site U1427  

Site U1427 is in the Yamato Basin at $35^{\circ}57.92^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $134^{\circ}26.06^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and 330.3 mbsl (Fig. F1). The site is situated on the outer margin of the southeast-northwest–trending continental shelf ${\sim}35\,\mathrm{km}$ from the northern coast of Honshu Island and ${\sim}110\,\mathrm{km}$ south of Site U1426 (Fig. F8). Today, this site is under the influence of the first branch of the TWC, which is flowing along the outer margin of the continental shelf of Honshu Island (Hase et al., 1999). A piston core obtained during a preexpedition site survey cruise suggests an average sedimentation rate of ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{y}.$ This is significantly higher than any other sites drilled in the marginal sea, and coring at this site should provide an extremely high resolution record spanning most of the Pleistocene. In addition, the proximity to the southwestern portion of Honshu Island will provide a rare opportunity to examine the interrelationship between terrestrial climate and oceanography in the southern part of the marginal sea.  

Site U1427 is the southernmost site of the Expedition 346 latitudinal transect and is also the shallowest site of the depth transect. The location of Site U1427 was selected to obtain a high-resolution record of changes in the intensity of the influx of the first branch of the TWC during the last $2\,\mathrm{m}$ .y. We anticipate that this site will allow highresolution and continuous reconstruction of the oxygen isotope record because the shallow depth of Site U1427 assures that the site has always been located above the CCD. Accordingly, benthic foraminifers have likely survived burial and resisted corrosion even during glacial maxima climate stages when euxinic deepwater conditions prevailed below 500 mbsl (Ikehara et al., 1994). Together with the results from Sites U1425 and U1426, Site U1427 will enable us to reconstruct sea-surface temperature changes associated with the north–south movement of the Subpolar Front, which is considered to be related to the strength of the TWC (Isoda, 2011).  

# Main results  

Site U1427 was occupied at two different times during Expedition 346. First, following operations at Site U1426 (6 September 2013) and then $\sim\!2$ weeks later after completing operations at Site U1430 (22 September). A return to Site U1427 was driven by the desire to acquire additional material for postcruise studies. This was possible because all scientific and operations objectives were met approximately 5 days before the end of the expedition and, therefore, the remaining time available was spent reoccupying two sites drilled earlier in the expedition (Sites U1427 and U1425). Preliminary shipboard scientific results from Holes U1427A and U1427B indicated that this site exhibits a continuous upper Pleistocene sedimentary sequence with high sedimentation rates and excellent carbonate preservation, both of which are ideal for high-resolution paleoceanographic studies. Therefore, we drilled Hole U1427C during the revisit.  

Three holes were cored at Site U1427 using the full and half APC and XCB systems. Hole U1427A was cored to $548.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (81 cores) with a recovery of $542.59\mathrm{~m~}$ $(98.9\%)$ . Hole U1427B was cored to $405.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (65 cores) with a recovery of  

$422.41\mathrm{~m~}$ $(105\%)$ . Hole U1427C was cored to $351.1\;\mathrm{m}$ (52 cores) with a recovery of $367.77\mathrm{~m~}$ $(105\%)$ . Four formation temperature measurements were performed, and downhole wireline log data were obtained to $548.5\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF in Hole U1427A.  

An exciting aspect of operations at Site U1427 included acquisition of the deepest continuously recovered APC cored sequence in DSDP/ODP/IODP history and the deepest piston core (346-U1427A-81H) from $490.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1427 extends from the lower Pleistocene to the Holocene and is dominated by clayey silt and nannofossil-rich or biosiliceous-rich clayey silt. Numerous tephra beds are interbedded with these major lithologies, and volcaniclastic material represents a minor component throughout (Fig. F29). The complete succession of Site U1427 is assigned to a single unit “Unit A,” based on sedimentary structures and sediment composition. We refer to this unit as Unit A (instead of Unit I) to reinforce that this unit is lithologically distinct from the uppermost unit described at other marginal sea sites occupied during Expedition 346.  

Lithologic Unit A is characterized by tens of meters–scale alternations of biogenic component–rich clayey silt and clayey silt and shows a gradual color change from olive-gray to grayish green. The sediment is generally highly bioturbated and fairly homogeneous. Dispersed tephra and shell fragments are present throughout. Unit A is further divided into two subunits (A1 and A2) at ${\sim}130\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A based on differences in minor lithology. Some intervals in Subunit A1 show very dark gray colors with heavy bioturbation. Laminated intervals only are found in Subunit A2. The downhole variation of maximum grain size shows a coarser size in clayey silt intervals for the upper ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{m}$ (Subunit A1), with finer material in the clayey silt intervals deeper than ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Subunit A2).  

Nannofossils are generally common to abundant and exhibit moderate to good preservation. Six calcareous nannofossil datums were documented. Planktonic foraminifers are generally abundant, except for a few barren horizons and rare occurrences deeper than $511.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are characteristic of temperate to subarctic environments with intermittent incursions of subtropical species. Benthic foraminifers and ostracods are generally abundant and moderately to well preserved, except for a few samples that are either barren or contain impoverished assemblages. The overall composition of assemblages indicates shelf to upper slope paleodepths. However, downhole changes in assemblage composition appear to reflect changing paleoenvironmental conditions, probably related to distinct phases of Pleistocene climate evolution. Radiolarians are generally rare throughout the cored section, except at the base of the succession, where they are abundant. Four radiolarian markers are documented in Hole U1427A from the Stylatractus universus Zone (mid-Pleistocene) and the Botryostrobus aquilonaris Zone (upper Pleistocene). Diatoms are generally abundant and exhibit excellent preservation throughout the sedimentary sequence. No biostratigraphically useful diatom marker species were documented. High abundances of Chaetoceros spores and Paralia sulcata throughout the succession indicate a productive coastal environment. Freshwater diatom species differing from those at previous sites were also recognized. Phytoliths were present in all samples. All calcareous and siliceous microfossil datums generally agree with only minor inconsistencies (Fig. F9).  

Stratigraphic correlation of Holes U1427A and U1427B produced a complete splice extending from the seafloor to the bottom of Core 346-U1427A-63H ( $407.3\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). From that depth downhole, only sediment from Hole U1427A was recovered. Although the cores below Core 63H were not included in the spliced section, comparing the cores’ NGR profiles to the Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde profiles from the wireline measurements suggests that there are no significant core gaps. Sedimentation rates in the single lithologic unit established at this site vary little over the ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ record and average ${\sim}36\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . (Fig. F9).  

Physical properties trends measured at Site U1427 generally follow the alternating darker clay-rich and light biogenic component–rich sediment. Bulk density, NGR, and magnetic susceptibility show higher values in clay-rich sediment intervals, whereas lower values occur in biogenic-rich intervals. Porosity and water contents show opposite trends. Color reflectance also reflects these lithologic changes. Color reflectance parameter $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{b^{\star}}}$ , representing the yellow–blue ratio, is a good indicator to discriminate clay-rich from biogenic-rich sediment and correlates well with the trends of bulk density and NGR.  

Paleomagnetic studies focused on measuring NRM of archive halves. NRM of archivehalf core sections from Hole U1427A was measured before and after $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. Because of increased core flow, NRM of core sections from Hole U1427B was only measured after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization. The FlexIT tool was successfully deployed to orient Cores 346-U1427A-2H to 25H. We measured 12 discrete samples collected from Hole U1427A before and after stepwise AF demagnetization, with peak fields up to $60\;\mathrm{mT},$ to verify the archive-half core section measurements and to determine the demagnetization behavior of the recovered sediment. NRM intensity of the measured core sections after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization mostly ranges between $\sim\!10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . For the uppermost ${\sim}280\ \mathrm{m}$ of the recovered sediment, NRM intensity of the measured core sections after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization is mostly on the order of $10^{-3}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Below ${\sim}280\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the bottom of the holes, NRM intensity decreases to the order of $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A/m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , and the trend appears to be noisier than that from sediment found shallower than ${\sim}280\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The increase in scatter in the NRM intensity data from ${\sim}280\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the bottom of the holes is accompanied by increased scatter in paleomagnetic directional data.  

The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary $(0.781\,\mathrm{\,Ma})$ was recorded at ${\sim}295.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1427A and at ${\sim}293.7\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1427B. Below ${\sim}280\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, NRM inclinations of the cores after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization show mostly positive values that are apparently steeper than the expected normal polarity dipole inclination and scattered intervals with shallow and negative inclinations. Increased coring disturbance, strong drilling overprint, lack of core orientation, and the large scatter in paleomagnetic declinations makes magnetostratigraphic interpretation difficult for the deep part of sediment recovered at Site U1427 (below ${\sim}280\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A).  

We also conducted a short experiment to study changes in NRM as a function of core oxidation. Repeated measurements of NRM after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization of core sections from the dark intervals in the upper ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{m}$ of the holes at varying times indicate that NRM appears to decay through time, possibly because of magnetic mineral alteration caused by oxidation after the cores are split. The light intervals were not nearly as affected as the darker intervals (Fig. F30).  

The geochemistry at Site U1427 typifies that of continental margin sequences with extreme decomposition of organic matter. Organic carbon contents are relatively high with a mean of $1.2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ from the seafloor to ${\sim}550~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Combined with a very high sedimentation rate $({\sim}36\,\mathrm{cm/k.y.})$ , large quantities of organic matter are buried, which facilitates intense microbially mediated organic matter degradation processes including fermentation and methanogenesis. As a consequence, interstitial water is yellow, and certain dissolved species have very high concentrations. In particular, alkalinity, ammonium, phosphate, and bromide are all much higher than at other sites drilled during Expedition 346.  

The considerable organic matter decay also results in very high methane concentrations, which caused numerous gas voids beginning at $\sim\!18\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. A very shallow and sharp SMT occurs at ${\sim}5\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. This SMT is caused by AOM, in which a high upward flux of methane reacts with downward diffusing sulfate. This is shown by analyses of high-resolution water samples collected using a combination of whole round and Rhizon samples. Dissolved silica concentrations increase with depth much more slowly than at other Expedition 346 sites, probably because of the low geothermal gradient $(70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ at Site U1427 compared to that at other locations. Calcium carbonate varies between 2.6 and $25.1\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ and is well preserved over the entire depth of Site U1427, perhaps in part because of the very high interstitial water alkalinity.  

Downhole wireline log measurements were made in Hole U1427A to $548.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A using the paleo-combo tool string, which recorded spectral gamma ray, caliper, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and lithologic density logs, and the FMS-sonic tool string, which recorded resistivity images of the borehole, sonic velocities, and NGR data. Each logging tool string was run twice in the hole to ensure the quality of the logging data. The logs do not show major steps in the base levels, and the entire logged interval was assigned to one logging unit (Unit 1) corresponding to lithologic Unit A. Preliminary inspection of the data revealed cyclicities that mainly reflect variations in biogenic content relative to terrigenous clay and are consistent with lithologic changes in the recovered cores. Intervals with high NGR values, high density, and high resistivity generally reflect terrigenous clay–rich intervals. The measured geothermal gradient was $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}_{\phantom{\ }}$ , and the calculated heat flow value was $71\,\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

# Sites U1428 and U1429  

Site U1428 is in the northernmost part of the East China Sea at $31^{\circ}40.64^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $129^{\circ}02.00^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and $724~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , whereas Site U1429 is only $7.4~\mathrm{km}$ away at $31^{\circ}37.04^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $128^{\circ}59.85^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ and $732~\mathrm{mbsl}$ (Fig. F8). The sites are in the southern part of the Danjo Basin, which is in the northern tip of the Okinawa Trough. The Danjo Basin is a depression ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{km}$ wide and ${\sim}800\;\mathrm{m}$ deep with a sill depth at ${\sim}700\;\mathrm{m}$ and is surrounded by continental shelves to its west, north, and east. Only its south side is open to the Okinawa Trough (Fig. F31).  

Currently, the ${>}500\ \mathrm{km}$ wide continental shelf of the East China Sea spreads west of the Danjo Basin and also extends further northwest to the Yellow Sea. Because the two large rivers, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, drain into the Yellow Sea, there is expected to be a significant contribution of fine detrital material from the west. During glacial lowstands, approximately one-half of the shelf was subaerially exposed and the mouth of the Yellow River advanced southeastward toward the Danjo Basin. Thus, the mouth of the Yellow River was perhaps located only ${\sim}150\ \mathrm{km}$ northwest of Sites  

U1428 and U1429 during glacial maxima. During glacial periods, the mouth of the Yangtze River instead advanced to the southeast and was located ${\sim}400~\mathrm{km}$ to the southwest.  

Sites U1428 and U1429 lie beneath the TWC, which branches from the Kuroshio Current ${\sim}250~\mathrm{km}$ to the south. The sites are also under the influence of East China Sea Coastal Water, which expands eastward from the continental shelf of the northern East China Sea because of the larger discharge of the Yangtze River during summer. Studies on piston cores retrieved from nearby locations suggest high sedimentation rates of ${\sim}300{-}800\;\mathrm{m/m.}\mathrm{)}$ . (Kubota et al., 2010; Kubota, 2013), which should allow for high-resolution paleoceanographic reconstruction of the northern East China Sea.  

One of the major objectives of Expedition 346 is to reconstruct high-resolution changes in EASM intensity since the Pliocene. The location of Sites U1428 and U1429 was selected to explore high-resolution changes in Yangtze River discharge through reconstruction of sea-surface salinity (Kubota et al., 2010). Because the Yangtze River drainage basin occupies the portion of southern China where EASM precipitation is most intense, it is reasonable to consider that Yangtze River discharge reflects the intensity of EASM precipitation.  

The influx of water through the Tsushima Strait is the major source of nutrients as well as freshwater to the marginal sea. Therefore, data from Sites U1428 and U1429 will constrain the history of surface water salinity and nutrient concentration of water that flows into the marginal sea.  

The difference in salinity of surface water relative to that of deep water is one of the major controls of deepwater ventilation in the marginal sea. The nutrient influx together with the deepwater ventilation rate is the major control of biological productivity in the surface as well as of bottom water oxygenation. Therefore, it is important to document the freshwater and nutrient budgets of the marginal sea to best understand the origin of the dark and light layers in the sedimentary record as well as the overall paleoceanographic evolution of the sea (Tada et al., 1999).  

# Main results  

Two holes were cored at primary Site U1428 and three at alternate Site U1429 using the full and half APC and the XCB systems. At both sites, nonmagnetic core barrels were used with the APC system. Only full-length core barrels were oriented. In Hole U1428A, 26 cores extended from the seafloor to $211.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, including 7 drilled intervals (totaling $37.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ) through thick sand beds. The cored interval in Hole U1428A was $173.9\mathrm{~m~}$ with a recovery of $178.86\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(103\%)$ . After completing Hole U1428A, we moved to Site U1429, which was estimated to have higher LSRs and, therefore, an expanded upper Pleistocene section.  

APC coring at Site U1429 was uneventful and penetrated to 188.3 m CSF-A, including two drilled intervals totaling $4.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Core recovery for Hole U1429A was $190.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(103\%)$ . Hole U1429B penetrated to $186.2\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with a recovery of $200.9\:\mathrm{m}$ of core $(108\%)$ . Hole U1429C penetrated to $179.2\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, including two drilled intervals totaling $4.9\;\mathrm{m}$ . Core recovery for Hole U1429C was $180.7\;\mathrm{m}$ $(104\%)$ .  

After completing Site U1429, we returned to Site U1428 to drill an additional hole that provided material to build a complete spliced section at this site spanning at least the last ${\sim}0.3\mathrm{~m.y.}$ . and to provide additional material for high-resolution paleoceanographic studies. Hole U1428B was subsequently APC cored to $143.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (16 cores) with a recovery of $145.85\;\mathrm{m}$ $(102\%)$ .  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Sites U1428 and U1429 extends from the middle Pleistocene to the Holocene (Fig. F32) and is divided into two lithologic units (A and B) based on sedimentary structures and composition (Figs. F33, F34). Unit A at Sites U1428 and U1429 is equivalent to Unit A at Site U1427 in the Yamato Basin. Unit A is composed mainly of calcareous nannofossil ooze and calcareous nannofossil–rich clay. Meter-scale color variations from olive-gray to greenish gray and light greenish gray are visible but subtle and appear to respond to glacial–interglacial variations of paleoceanographic change. Tephra layers with thickness ranging from decimeters to $^{1\!}/2\;\mathrm{{m}}$ occur throughout. Unit B is a sand unit, consisting of fine- to mediumgrained, rounded to subrounded massive sand as thick as $70\textrm{m}$ . Few sedimentary structures are preserved in this unit. Given that the sand is well sorted and rounded, it is strongly suggested that the unit was deposited by strong along-slope currents rather than gravity flow, as in the case of turbidite formation.  

Nannofossils are generally abundant and exhibit good preservation through the upper Pleistocene succession, except in the sand intervals. One calcareous nannofossil datum, the first occurrence of Emiliania huxleyi, is documented. Diatoms are generally common and exhibit good preservation. No biostratigraphically useful marker species are recorded. Variable abundances of Chaetoceros spores and Paralia sulcata indicate the occasional presence of a biologically productive coastal environment. Freshwater diatoms show significant abundance peaks throughout the succession. Planktonic foraminifers are abundant and well preserved except in the sand horizons, which are barren. Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are diverse and typical of subtropical environments. The last occurrence of Globigerinoides ruber (pink) is consistent with the calcareous nannofossil datum. Benthic foraminifers vary markedly in abundance but are generally well preserved. The overall assemblage composition indicates upper bathyal paleodepths. Ostracods are common to abundant and well preserved in the upper ${\sim}130~\mathrm{m}$ but are absent in the sand horizons of the lower part of the section. Downhole changes in assemblage composition reflect variations in organic export fluxes to the seafloor and bottom water ventilation that are probably linked to glacial–interglacial oscillations in biological surface productivity and ocean circulation. In particular, the buliminids, globobuliminids, uvigerinids, miliolids, and the ostracod Krithe, which can be used to reconstruct changes in productivity and dysoxia (Jorissen et al., 2007; Alvarez Zarikian et al., 2009), show marked fluctuations in abundance throughout the succession (Fig. F35).  

Calcium carbonate contents display a cyclic pattern, alternating between ${\sim}15$ and ${\sim}35$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . These changes probably relate to glacial–interglacial oscillations. Carbonate profiles at both sites correlate well once different sedimentation rates between the two sites are taken into account. The organic carbon content varies from being relatively high in the uppermost sample in Hole U1428A ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ TOC) to almost zero in the basal sand layers. This change is a gradual decrease with depth but displays a sawtooth pattern with up to $0.20\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ variance. At ${\sim}90$ and $110\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, TOC values decrease because of the presence of tephras. Total nitrogen content is low, as observed at previous sites; however, it closely follows the TOC pattern of decreasing with depth, from ${\sim}0.3\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ at the top to ${\sim}0.12\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ at the bottom. The C:N ratio is low but follows the TOC trend.  

Interstitial water was collected using traditional whole-round samples and Rhizon samples. Results from both techniques show very unusual profiles. In particular, a sharp change in several constituents at ${\sim}46\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at both sites shows that the uppermost sedimentary section contains interstitial water with very different chemistry compared to that in underlying sediment. The abrupt interface coincides with a very porous tephra horizon at both sites at similar depths. The interface also corresponds with a SMT. The data seem to suggest that subhorizontal fluid flow may be occurring within the abundant tephra horizons and driving microbial activity at these sites.  

Physical properties measured at Sites U1428 and U1429 generally show similar trends that follow sediment lithology. Bulk density and NGR gradually increase with depth in lithologic Unit A, and the highest values occur in the sand of Unit B. Porosity and water content show an opposite trend. Magnetic susceptibility shows high values in the tephra layers and also largely increases downhole in Unit B. At both sites, the color reflectance profiles agree well with changes in the content of calcium carbonate and other physical properties related to tephra and sand layers. Color changes at these two sites are mainly controlled by calcium carbonate content, the color of tephra layers, and the presence of sand.  

Paleomagnetic measurements indicate that the entire section at Sites U1428 and U1429 corresponds to the Brunhes Chron. This interpretation is consistent with biostratigraphic results for the site.  

Five formation temperature measurements, including the mudline, were performed in Holes U1428A and U1429A using the APCT-3. The measured geothermal gradients were $116^{\circ}$ and $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}_{\mathrm{}}$ , and heat flows were 126 and $88\mathrm{~mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ in Holes U1428A and U1429A, respectively.  

Stratigraphic correlation at Sites U1428 and U1429 benefited from calm seas and minimal gas expansion. Although the sites are only $7.4\,\mathrm{km}$ apart, sedimentation rates were sufficiently different to merit generation of separate splices. The Site U1428 splice reaches $\mathord{\sim}145\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-D, with one gap from 88.7 to $93.8~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-D. The Site U1429 splice reaches $\mathord{\sim}188\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-D with two gaps, the first from 50 to $53.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-D and the second from 123 to $125.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-D. Preliminary correlation among the two splices indicates that the shallower gap in the Site U1429 splice was successfully recovered at Site U1428, but the deeper gap is likely in the same interval as the gap at Site U1428. All three of these gaps stem from strong coring disturbance and poor core recovery associated with the unsuccessful coring of unconsolidated coarse sand and ash layers. Preliminary age models based on a very limited number of datums (2–3 at each site) indicate sedimentation rates of ${\sim}42\;\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . at Site U1428 and ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . at Site U1429 (Fig. F32).  

# Site U1430  

Site U1430 is ${\sim}300~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of Site U1425 in the Ulleung Basin at $37^{\circ}54.16^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $131^{\circ}32.25^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ and 1072 mbsl (Fig. F8). The site is on the southern upper slope of the eastern South Korean Plateau, which bounds the northern margin of the Ulleung Basin. Studies of a piston core from a nearby location suggest sedimentation rates of ${\sim}40$ $\mathrm{{m/m.y.}}$ . (Lee et al., 2008), which are as slow as those observed at Site U1425. Seismic data (Tada et al., 2013) suggest a sediment thickness of $285\mathrm{~m~}$ and a basal age of ${\sim}10$ Ma. If this is correct, the cores recovered at Site U1430 will provide a continuous slowsedimentation record that is ideal to study the long-term history of dust provenance and flux changes since 10 Ma.  

Because of its strategic location and proximity to the Asian continent, the sedimentary record at Site U1430 may contain a relatively pristine record of continental input. In addition, by combining the results from this site with those from Sites U1423, U1425, and U1426 it will be possible to reconstruct changes in the position of the atmospheric Westerly Jet axis, as well as dryness of the Gobi Desert, and the position and intensity of the early spring storm track in mid-latitude Asia during the last ${\sim}5$ m.y.  

Site U1430 is under the influence of the second branch of the TWC but is only slightly south of the third branch, which forms the Subpolar Front (Hase et al., 1999). Therefore, the site may provide a good opportunity to monitor the behavior of the Subpolar Front and changes in intensity of the TWC (Isoda, 2011). The site is also useful to reconstruct changes in deepwater oxygenation and CCD during the last $4\:\mathrm{m}$ .y. by combining results from deeper sites such as Sites U1424 and U1425 and shallower sites such as Sites U1426 and U1427.  

# Main results  

Three holes were cored at Site U1430 using the full and half APC and XCB systems. Oriented, nonmagnetic core barrels were used with the full-length APC system in Hole U1430A. Half APC cores in Hole U1430A were not oriented but used nonmagnetic barrels. A total of 29 APC cores and 3 XCB cores penetrated to $274.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1430A, recovering $258.24\;\mathrm{m}$ $(94\%)$ . In Hole U1430B, 29 APC cores and 8 XCB cores extended from the seafloor to $275\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , recovering $259.71\:\mathrm{m}\:(94\%)$ . In Hole U1430C, 33 APC cores and 1 XCB core penetrated to $250\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, recovering $257.02\:\mathrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ . Total core recovery for Site U1430 was $775~\mathrm{m}$ .  

The sedimentary succession extends from the middle Miocene $({\sim}15\;\mathrm{Ma})$ to the Holocene and is dominated by clayey silt, silty clay, nannofossil ooze, diatom ooze, claystone, and sandstone (Fig. F36). Although there are numerous discrete tephra (especially pumice) layers throughout the sediment record, volcaniclastic material represents a minor component of the lithology. The section is divided into three major lithologic units (I–III) distinguished on the basis of sediment composition, referring particularly to the abundance of biosiliceous and siliciclastic fractions.  

Lithologic Unit I (upper Pliocene to Holocene) consists of clayey silt, silty clay, and nannofossil ooze with small amounts of diatom-bearing and diatom-rich silty clay. Unit I is further divided into two subunits (IA and IB) based on the frequency of alternating gray (organic rich) and light greenish gray (organic poor) silty clay intervals. The frequency of this color banding decreases from Subunit IA to IB.  

Lithologic Unit II (upper Miocene to upper Pliocene) is distinguished from Unit I based on a significant downward increase in diatom content relative to terrigenous material and bioturbation. This unit is further divided into two subunits (IIA and IIB). Subunit IIA is composed of diatom-bearing and diatom-rich silty clay that fluctuates in clay content, which is reflected in the more subdued but regular color banding of Subunit IIA. Subunit IIB is dominated by a dark gray diatom ooze, with diatoms making up to ${>}70\%$ of the sediment based on smear slide analysis.  

Lithologic Unit III (middle to upper Miocene) is divided into three subunits. Subunit IIIA is composed of alternating layers of heavily bioturbated diatom ooze, clayey diatom ooze, and diatom-rich silty clay. These lithofacies show decimeter- to meter-scale variability between dark gray to very dark gray, but the changes in color can be subtle. An important feature of Subunit IIIA is that some (yet not all) diatom ooze–rich sequences display ${\sim}5$ to $\sim240\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick intervals that are very finely laminated. Subunit IIIB is characterized by dark gray siliceous silty clay and claystone with few sedimentary structures. The transition from Subunit IIIA to IIIB is defined by the diagenetic loss of biosiliceous material and the formation of siliceous claystone. XRD results show that opal-CT first appears between Subunit IIIB and IIIC. Subunit IIIC, which lies at the base of the recovered sequence, is characterized by dark gray, hard, glauconite-rich quartz/feldspar-dominated sandstone and light gray glauconite-rich dolomite-dominated sandstones.  

Nannofossils are generally absent with the exception of a few intervals where they are rare and exhibit poor preservation. One calcareous nannofossil datum, the first occurrence of Emiliania huxleyi, was documented. Diatoms are generally common and well preserved. Thirteen diatom datums were documented. High abundances of Chaetoceros spores are indicative of a productive paleoenvironment. Laminations near $231\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1430A contain different diatom assemblages in the light and dark layers. Radiolarians are generally abundant throughout the entire succession and are mostly well preserved. Twenty-two radiolarian datums were documented, including the last occurrence of Pentactinosphaera hokurikuensis $.15.0\,\mathrm{Ma})$ near $256.3\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1430B. The abundance of planktonic foraminifers is variable through the succession, ranging from rare to dominant. Planktonic foraminifer preservation is generally poor to moderate. The planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are characteristic of temperate to subarctic environments and primarily consist of Globigerina bulloides, Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral and dextral), and the Neogloboquadrina kagaensis group. Two datums are identified: the last occurrence of the N. kagaensis group and the dextral to sinistral coiling change in N. pachyderma. Benthic foraminifers are generally moderately to well preserved and abundant within the Pleistocene interval above ${\sim}54\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Alternating peak abundances in Cassidulina and Uvigerina suggest elevated but fluctuating organic export fluxes to the seafloor through the middle to upper Pleistocene. Deeper in the succession, most samples are barren or rarely consist of an impoverished assemblage dominated by a few agglutinated species. The overall composition of assemblages at Site U1430 indicates middle bathyal paleodepths from the upper Pliocene to the Pleistocene.  

The upper portions of the sedimentary record at Site U1430 have large variations in organic carbon and carbonate contents and major changes in interstitial water chemistry. The lower unit has more consistent solid and fluid chemistry. Organic carbon contents vary from 1 to $3\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the upper unit. In this interval, the carbonate content has at least three maxima, with the highest $({\sim}24\mathrm{~wt\%})$ at ${\sim}33~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The C:N ratio in the upper $80\textrm{m}$ of sediment is ${\sim}6.4$ . Methane concentrations are very low compared to other Expedition 346 sites. Because of the high levels of TOC in this sediment, we expected much higher methane values. Lower than expected values may reflect that perhaps any methane produced was not trapped in the sediment because of the very low sedimentation rate. Alkalinity increases from 2.4 to $42\;\mathrm{mM}$ , whereas sulfate gradually decreases from 28.4 to $13.4\;\mathrm{mM}_{\sun}$ , from the seafloor to ${\sim}62\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Calcium carbonate is virtually absent $({<}1\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ in the lower stratigraphic section, despite some slightly higher values near the bottom $_{\sim2.0}$ to ${\sim}5.7~\mathrm{wt\%}$ from 232 to 245 m CSF-A).  

Physical properties measured at Site U1430 generally show trends that are largely similar to Site U1425 and follow sediment lithology. Magnetic susceptibility, bulk density, and NGR have higher values in Unit I than in Unit II; porosity and water content show the opposite trend. High magnetic susceptibility and $P$ -wave velocity show high relative maximum values that correspond to the tephra layers in Unit I. Shear strength generally increases with depth to $\mathord{\sim}180~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A because of sediment compaction and then exhibits large variations from $\mathord{\sim}180$ to $240\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Color reflectance shows higher variation in Unit I than in Unit II and is related to the alternating very dark brown to black organic-rich bands and lighter olive to green hemipelagic sediment in Unit I. All physical property values change markedly at ${\sim}240\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, which is inferred to be the opal-A/opal-CT transition zone.  

Paleomagnetic investigations focused on measuring NRM of archive halves. NRM of archive-half core sections from Hole U1430A was measured before and after $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolution. NRM of archive-half core sections from Holes U1430B and U1430C was only measured after $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization at 5 cm resolution. The FlexIT tool was successfully deployed to orient Cores 346-U1430A-2H to $25\mathrm{H}$ . Paleomagnetic measurements documented the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary $(0.781\,\mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}33.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1430A, ${\sim}34\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1430B, and ${\sim}37$ m CSF-A in Hole U1430C. The weak NRM intensity, increased coring disturbance, strong drill string overprint, and large scatter in paleomagnetic declinations makes magnetostratigraphic interpretation difficult for the deeper part of sediment recovered at Site U1430.  

Downhole measurements were made in Hole U1430B to ${\sim}272\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF. The triple combination wireline logging tool string was split into two shorter strings to maximize data acquisition in the lowest part of the hole. The logged interval was divided into two logging units (Unit 1, from the pipe entrance to ${\sim}244\mathrm{~m~WSF},$ , and Unit 2, from ${\sim}244~\mathrm{m}~\mathrm{WSF}$ to the bottom of Hole U1430B). In logging Unit 1, the log data mainly reflect variation in diatom content relative to terrigenous clay and match lithologic changes throughout the section. Preliminary examination of the data revealed apparent high-frequency cyclicity in the FMS images. A distinct change in log characteristics occurs at ${\sim}244\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, which correlates closely with a change downhole to indurated deposits. Core recovery is low in this interval, and the good quality of the downhole logs and borehole images should allow us to refine the lithology within the core gaps.  

Five formation temperature measurements were made using the APCT-3 from the seafloor to $117.6\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1430A. The measured geothermal gradient is $103^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ and the calculated heat flow value is $93\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

Stratigraphic correlation at Site U1430 benefited from calm seas and limited gas expansion. A complete splice was generated from the mudline to ${\sim}259\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A between Holes U1430A and U1430B. A CCSF-C depth scale was generated for Hole U1430C, with the exception of Cores 346-U1430C-4H and 5H because they contained slump features. Depth-age analysis indicates a basal age of ${\sim}15\;\mathrm{Ma}$ for Site U1430, with sedimentation rates ranging from $2\ \mathrm{m/m.y.}$ ., associated with a glauconite-bearing condensed section, to $44\;\mathrm{{\m/m.y.}}$ , associated with more detrital- and siliceous-rich intervals (Fig. F37).  

# Operations  

# Port call  

Expedition 346 began with the first line ashore the Valdez Container Terminal in Valdez, Alaska (USA), at $1120~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 July 2013. The first week of Expedition 346 consisted almost entirely of port call activities. This was the first port of call in Valdez, and operations proceeded very smoothly. In spite of the remote location and logistical challenges, the vessel was resupplied and departed 1 day earlier than scheduled.  

The IODP-United States Implementing Organization crew and the expedition CoChief Scientists arrived at the ship in Valdez on 29 July after an $^{8\,\mathrm{h}}$ bus ride from Anchorage. The ship’s (Siem Offshore) crew arrived the following day. On day three of the port call, the Expedition 346 science party moved aboard, completing the sailing complement for the expedition.  

Port call activities included routine resupply of consumables and offloading of the previous expedition’s (IODP Southern Alaska Margin Expedition 341) freight. All Expedition 341 core samples were offloaded to refrigerated containers and dispatched to the IODP Core Repository at Texas A&M University (College Station, Texas). All microbiological samples were offloaded and dispatched to the Expedition 341 scientists’ home institutions by courier. Three empty core liner boxes were also offloaded for disposal. In addition, 2441 sacks/122.1 short tons of barite, 3920 sacks/196.0 short tons of sea gel, and 1872 sacks/88.0 short tons of cement were loaded. Bunkering totals included loading of 115,015 gal marine gas oil by trucks from a local Valdez refinery.  

The ship’s crew’s activities included receipt and installation of a replacement standpipe valve, including the required X-ray certification of the high-pressure welds by a technician from Anchorage. In addition, a Schlumberger mechanic came to assist the logging engineer with repairs to the securing system holding the logging winch/transmission in place.  

With port call activities completed, the R/V JOIDES Resolution departed for Site U1422 (proposed Site JB-3) with the last line away at $0718\;\mathrm{h}$ on 2 August. Departure was 28 h ahead of the scheduled departure time.  

The 3556 nmi voyage to Site U1422 lasted 2 weeks at an average speed of ${\sim}10.2~\mathrm{kt}$ . During the transit, we crossed two low-pressure cells with their associated strong winds and high seas, which impacted our cruising speed. Average speed over ground during those times was as slow as $7.5\ \mathrm{kt}.$ . A total of eight time changes took place during the transit, with the clock being turned back $7\;\mathrm{h}$ and advanced 1 day to compensate for passage across the International Date Line. In effect, the day of 9 August was lost and the ship time jumped from 8 August directly to 10 August at $2400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 August. The last time change placed the ship at $\mathrm{UTC}+9\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , which was the local time for all Expedition 346 sites as well as Japan and Busan, Korea.  

The ship maintained good speed $\left(+11\,\mathrm{kt}\right)$ during the final days of the transit until entering the heavily trafficked Tsugaru Strait south of Hokkaido, Japan. A strong current on the bow reduced the vessel’s speed over ground through the strait to $6.0~\mathrm{kt}$ . This lost time was made up once exiting the strait and turning to a more northerly course, during which an average speed of $11.7\,\mathrm{kt}$ was achieved during the last day of the transit.  

# Site U1422  

Five holes were cored at Site U1422 using the APC and nonmagnetic core barrels (Table T1). Two holes were cored to $9.5\textrm{m}$ CSF-A (1 core each), one hole to $205.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, one hole to $141.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and one hole to $111.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. A total of 63 cores were required to obtain $502.6\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ( $105.2\%$ recovery). The APCT-3 was deployed four times.  

We arrived at Site U1422 at $1448\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 August 2013. Control of the ship was shifted from bridge “cruise” mode to dynamic positioning mode at $1528\,\mathrm{h}$ . A strong gale was blowing as the ship arrived on location, which complicated the vessel’s maneuvering over the location coordinates. However, the ship soon steadied over the site’s coordinates, and the rig crew began picking up drill collars and making up the APC/XCB bottom-hole assembly (BHA). All tubular joints were measured and drifted (internal diameter clearance checked) as they were made up into the drill string. By ${\sim}0300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 August, the drill string had been deployed to the seafloor.  

# Hole U1422A  

Operations continued at Site U1422 as the drill string was tripped to a depth of 3425.0 meters below rig floor (mbrf). The top drive was picked up, and the pipe was spaced out for spudding Hole U1422A. A precision depth recorder (PDR) reading for the site established a projected seafloor depth of 3450.4 mbrf. This was $4.4\:\mathrm{m}$ deeper than the predicted depth of 3446.0 mbrf for operations at this site. The bit was placed at 3446.4 mbrf, and Hole U1422A was started at $0340~\mathrm{h}$ on the morning of 18 August. When recovered, the core barrel was full $(9.96\;\mathrm{m})$ ), preventing the possibility of determining an accurate seafloor depth. This ended Hole U1422A.  

# Hole U1422B  

The vessel was offset $15\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1422A, and Hole U1422B was spudded at $0515\;\mathrm{h}$ with the bit placed at a depth of 3441.4 mbrf. Once again, the barrel was recovered full $(9.67\;\mathrm{m})$ , necessitating a third attempt to establish mudline.  

# Hole U1422C  

The vessel was offset $30\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1422B, and Hole U1422C was spudded at $0640\,\mathrm{h}$ with the bit placed at 3435.4 mbrf. When recovered, the barrel contained 4.64 m of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 3440.3 mbrf. Coring operations continued in this hole using full-length APC core barrels to a depth $125.3\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Core 346- U1422C-14H required 90,000 lb of overpull, indicating that we would need either to drill over future core barrels or switch to the half APC system. Because of the success of the half APC system during the previous expedition (Expedition 341), this was the tool of choice. Very successful half APC coring continued to a total depth of $205.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $1950\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 August, ending Hole U1422C and beginning Hole U1422D. Total recovery for this hole was $215.78\;\mathrm{m}$ $(105.2\%)$ . A total of 17 half APC cores were recovered. A total of $79.90\mathrm{~m~}$ of penetration was achieved with this system, recovering $86.2\;\mathrm{m}$ $(107.9\%)$ . Four successful temperature measurements were taken using the APCT-3 temperature shoe on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H at depths of 33.1, 61.6, 87.3, and $115.8\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, respectively.  

# Hole U1422D  

The vessel was offset $15~\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1422A, and Hole U1422D was spudded at $2120\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 August. The bit was placed $3\;\mathrm{m}$ lower $(3438.4\,\mathrm{mbrf})$ than it was for Hole U1422C. The mudline core contained $8.14\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 3439.8 mbrf. APC operations continued in this hole to $141.8\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. At that time, the Co-Chief Scientists decided that spending further time on the hole would not be fruitful because of the increasing amount of turbidites recovered from the section. The top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at 1235 h on 20 August, ending Hole U1422D and beginning Hole U1422E. A total of 141.8 m of penetration was achieved, recovering $152.83\;\mathrm{m}$ $(107.8\%)$ .  

# Hole U1422E  

The vessel was offset $15\textrm{m}$ east of Hole U1422A, and Hole U1422E was spudded at $1320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 August, establishing a seafloor depth of 3440.0 mbrf. Coring operations continued in this hole, recovering 14 APC cores to $111.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Two of these cores (346-U1422E-9H and 10H) were half APC cores in an attempt to recover a turbidite section of the formation where recovery had been problematic. Incomplete stroke on Cores 13H and 14H led to curtailment of coring operations for the site. Total recovery for this hole was $114.34\mathrm{~m~}$ $(102.5\%)$ . The top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0420\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August. The drill string was recovered back aboard the vessel, the BHA was set back in the derrick, and the vessel was secured for transit. At $1142~\mathrm{h}$ that same day, the vessel got under way for Site U1423. This ended operations at Site U1422.  

# Site U1423  

Three holes were drilled at Site U1423 (proposed Site JB-2) (Table T1). Hole U1423A was cored using the APC to $206.6\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Similarly, Hole U1423B was cored with the APC to $249.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Hole U1423C was drilled without coring to $114\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. From this depth to $180\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, we cut and recovered six cores in a series of alternating drilled and cored intervals with the objective of filling gaps in APC cores recovered from the previous two holes. Real-time stratigraphic correlation indicated that the carefully orchestrated coring operation appeared to be successful. Downhole measurements were carried out in Hole U1423B using a modified version of the paleocombo tool string and the FMS-sonic tool string. A total of 56 cores were required to obtain $502.6\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment $105.2\%$ recovery).  

# Transit from Site U1422  

The transit to Site U1423 was very short, and the $125\ \mathrm{nmi}$ distance was covered uneventfully in $12\,\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $10.4~\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $2342\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August 2013. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, control of the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control at $0030\;\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August, and a seafloor positioning beacon was deployed at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ the same day.  

# Hole U1423A  

Operations in Hole U1423 started on 22 August. The same three-stand APC/XCB BHA used at the previous site was deployed, and the drill string was lowered to 1774 mbrf. After picking up the top drive and spacing out the drill string, an APC core barrel was deployed at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August. The bit was positioned at 1784.4 mbrf for the mudline core; however, the driller was unable to pressure up the drill string. Suspecting that the shear pins had prematurely failed during deployment, the barrel was recovered to the rig floor, where it was discovered empty and with all shear pins sheared. The pins were replaced, and the bit was lowered $10~\mathrm{m}$ to 1794.4 mbrf for a second attempt. Hole U1423A started at $0640\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August. Core 346-U1423A-1H was recovered with $7.26~\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 1796.6 mbrf. Cores 1H through 22H were taken from 0 to $206.6\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and recovered $212.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(103\%)$ . Four temperature measurements were taken using the APCT-3 temperature shoe on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H (35.8, 64.3, 92.8, and $111.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, respectively). With the top drive left in place, the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $2355\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August, ending Hole U1423A.  

# Hole U1423B  

The ship was offset $15\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1423A and the bit was positioned at 1791.4 mbrf. Hole U1423B was spudded at $0050~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 August. Core 346-U1423B-1H was recovered with $4\textrm{m}$ of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 1797 mbrf. Cores 1H through 28H extended to $249\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered $250\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(100\%)$ . The recovery amount was negatively impacted because of zero recovery for Core 18H $(151.6{-}158.1\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ , the result of a space-out error on the rig floor, resulting in an inadvertent drilling of hole that was to be cored on the next core. APC overpull (using full-length core barrels) varied between 60,000 and 80,000 lb between 142 and $249\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Cores 17H through 28H), with the exception of Core 27H (230.1–239.6 mbrf), when overpull reached 100,000 lb. The last core on deck was recovered at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 August. To prepare for downhole logging, the hole was circulated clean, the logging tools were moved forward to the rig floor, the top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled to a logging depth of 80.0 mbrf. The paleo-combo tool string was deployed and recorded spectral gamma ray, caliper, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and lithologic density logs. The second string consisted of the FMS-sonic tool string, which recorded resistivity images of the borehole, sonic velocities, and NGR data over the entire interval. Both logging tool strings were able to reach total hole depth. The logging tools were then rigged down, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0515\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August. This marked the end of Hole U1423B.  

# Hole U1423C  

The ship was offset $15\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1423A, and Hole U1423C was spudded at $0655\ \mathrm{h}$ on 24 August. The operations plan for this hole was altered to save time and allow for recovering a few gaps in the stratigraphic record remaining after coring Holes U1423A and U1423B. The hole was drilled without coring (using an XCB center bit) to $114~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. APC coring commenced, recovering six cores interspersed with appropriate drilled intervals to properly space out the core breaks and cover the areas of interest. Hole U1423C was terminated at $180.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. After setting back the top drive, the bit cleared the seafloor at $1700\,\mathrm{h}$ and was back on the rig floor at $2040\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August. The positioning beacon was recovered aboard at $1756\,\mathrm{h}$ while tripping the drill string. After breaking out the bit and nonmagnetic drill collar, the rig floor was secured for transit, thrusters/hydrophones were raised, and the sea passage to Site U1424 began at $2136\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August.  

# Site U1424  

Three holes were drilled at Site U1424 (proposed Site JB-1) (Table T1). Hole U1424A was cored using the APC to $158.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Similarly, Hole U1424B was cored with the APC to $154.7\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and Hole U1424C was cored to only $63.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. A total of 41 cores obtained $380.68\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ( $101\%$ recovery).  

# Transit from Site U1423  

The transit to Site U1424 was very short. The $98.5\ \mathrm{nmi}$ distance was covered in just $10\,\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $9.9\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $0738\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 August 2013. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates and turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ the vessel was stabilized for rig floor operations to begin at Site U1424.  

# Hole U1424A  

The drill string was tripped to the seafloor, and the bit was positioned at 2806 mbrf for the mudline core. However, this core barrel was recovered empty. The bit was repositioned at 2816 mbrf for the second attempt, and Hole U1424A was spudded at $1525\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 25 August. Based upon recovery from the first core, a seafloor depth of 2818.7 mbrf was established. APC coring continued with 17 cores recovered to 158.8 m CSF-A. With the top drive left in place, the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0645\;\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August, ending Hole U1424A. Coring recovered $161\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $(101\%)$ .  One  temperature  measurement  was  taken  using  the  APCT-3 temperature shoe on Core 346-U1423A-4H at $35.3\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. This measurement fell exactly on the temperature gradient established during Leg 127 when this site was first cored (Site 794). Therefore, no additional temperature measurements were made at this site.  

# Hole U1424B  

The ship was offset $15\,\textrm{m}$ north of Hole U1424A, and Hole U1424B was started at $0740\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 August. Recovery from Core 346-U1423B-1H established a seafloor depth of 2819.8 mbrf. APC coring continued uneventfully with 17 cores recovered to $154.7\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The bit cleared the seafloor at $2035\mathrm{~h~}$ on 26 August, ending Hole U1424B. Coring recovered $155.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $(100\%)$ .  

# Hole U1424C  

The ship was offset $15\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1424A, and Hole U1424C was spudded at $2125\mathrm{~h~}$ on 26 August. The operations plan for this hole was amended to conserve valuable operating time. Cores 346-U1424C-1H through 3H were taken for postexpedition OSL dating, and Cores 4H through 6H were taken for high-resolution geochemical analyses. Hole U1424C was started with the bit positioned at the same depth as it was for Hole U1424A (2416 mbrf). APC coring extended from the seafloor to $63.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. OSL sampling involved special core handling procedures, and Hole U1424C was intentionally planned to be cored during the night to minimize the cores exposure to light. Cores 1H through 3H were cut in sequence into $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ wholeround sections directly on the drill floor as the core was pulled out of the core barrel and placed into opaque aluminum-lined pouches, labeled, sealed, and stored in the refrigerated core storage. The drill string was pulled out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August, and was back on the rig floor at $0815\;\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August. The rig floor was secured for transit, thrusters were raised, and the sea passage to Site U1425 began at 0854 h on 27 August.  

# Site U1425  

Site U1425 (proposed Site YR-1) was occupied at two different times during Expedition 346, first following operations at Site U1424 on 28 August 2013 and then ${\sim}3$ weeks later after revisiting Site U1427 on 24 September (see below) to acquire additional material for postcruise studies. The return to Sites U1425 and U1427 was possible because all scientific and operations objectives were met ${\sim}5$ days before the end of the expedition; therefore, the remaining time available was spent reoccupying these two important sites drilled earlier in the expedition. We drilled Hole U1425E during the revisit.  

Four holes were cored at Site U1425 using the full and half APC and the XCB (Table T1). Hole U1425A was cored to $9.5\textrm{m}$ CSF-A (one core), Hole U1425B was cored to $407.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, Hole U1425C was cored to $25\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and Hole U1425D was cored to $431\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. A total of 135 cores obtained $502.6\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ( $105.2\%$ recovery). The APCT-3 was deployed four times.  

# Transit from Site U1424  

The $180\ \mathrm{nmi}$ distance between Sites U1424 and U1425 was covered in $17.6~\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $10.2~\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $0230\;\mathrm{h}$ on 28 August. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $0300\,\mathrm{h}$ , the vessel was stabilized for rig floor operations to begin.  

# Hole U1425A  

A three-stand APC/XCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was run to bottom. After picking up the top drive and spacing out the drill string to 1911.4 mbrf ( $\mathit{\Theta}_{6\;\mathrm{m}}$ above the observed seafloor depth on the ship’s PDR), an APC core barrel was deployed. The first core barrel was recovered empty. The bit was repositioned $10\,\mathrm{m}$ lower at 1901.4 mbrf for the second attempt. Hole U1425A was started at $0905\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 August. This time, however, the core barrel was recovered full, once again missing a reliable seafloor determination.  

# Hole U1425B  

The ship was offset $15\;\mathrm{m}$ north, a new APC core barrel was deployed, and the bit was positioned at 1918.4 mbrf. Hole U1425B was spudded at 1005 h on 28 August, establishing a seafloor depth of 1919.1 mbrf. APC/XCB coring continued to a final depth of 407.2 m CSF-A, the scientific target depth for this site. The coring operation in Hole U1425B consisted of 28 full APC cores, 23 half APC cores, and 10 XCB cores. We recovered $397.25\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(98\%)$ . Three successful temperature measurements were taken using the APCT-3 temperature shoe on Cores 346-U1425B-4H, 7H, and 10H (37.3, 65.8, and $94.3~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, respectively). The hole was circulated clean, the logging tools were moved forward to the rig floor, the top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled to a logging depth of 80 mbrf. At $1115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 August, preparations for wireline logging were initiated. The paleo-combo tool string was deployed to the bottom of the hole and recorded spectral gamma ray, caliper, magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and lithologic density logs. The second string consisted of the FMS-sonic tool string, which recorded resistivity images of the borehole, sonic velocities, and NGR data. The FMS-sonic string reached $396.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, $11.2\,\mathrm{m}$ off the bottom of the hole ( $\mathrm{407~m}$ CSF-A). The logging tools were rigged down, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 August.  

# Hole U1425C  

After offsetting the ship $15\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1425A, Hole U1425C was spudded at $0355\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 August. Core 346-U1425C-1H recovered $5.95\:\mathrm{m}$ , establishing a seafloor depth of 1918.9 mbrf. This core was followed by two additional full-length APC cores to $25\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Because these cores were for OSL sampling, they were handled per the protocols established at Site U1424, taking care to shield the core from any natural or artificial light as much as possible. The drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0540\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 August, ending Hole U1425C operations.  

# Hole U1425D  

The ship was offset $15\,\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1425A and Hole U1425D was spudded at 0605 h on 31 August. Core 346-U1425D-1H established a seafloor depth of 1919.6 mbrf. Coring continued to a final depth of $431\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}_{}$ , alternating between the full and half APC and the XCB core barrels. The coring effort consisted of 26 full APC cores, 40 half APC cores, and 4 XCB cores. Core recovery totaled $417.5\mathrm{~m~}(98\%)$ . Recovery percentages are biased in the last few cores in Hole U1425D because both the XCB and half APC systems were pushed into dolomite and siliceous claystone horizons that neither coring system was designed to handle. Despite the poor recovery in the last few cores, the coring effort was scientifically successful, obtaining a dateable cored section for the last half APC core recovered (Core 72H). The top drive was set back and the drill string was recovered back aboard the ship. The positioning beacon was recovered during the pipe trip and was back aboard after lunch on 2 September. The BHA was set back in the derrick, and the vessel was secured for transit to Site U1426, ending (temporarily) operations at Site U1425.  

# Return to Site U1425  

We returned to Site U1425 after completing an additional hole at Site U1427. The 212 nmi distance between these two sites was covered in $19.5\,\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of 10.9 kt. The sea passage ended at $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 September. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $1500\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the JOIDES Resolution was stabilized and rig floor operations began.  

# Hole U1425E  

Deployment of a positioning beacon was deemed unnecessary for this hole because the weather was good, the water depth was ${<}2000\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , and the anticipated penetration depth was only ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Nonetheless, a Falmouth Scientific positioning beacon (model BAP-547; SN1022, 14 KHz, 208 dB) was kept on standby in case it was required.  

As at Site U1427, this hole was to provide extra core material for future sampling needs and postexpedition studies. The APC/XCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was run to bottom. The ship was positioned $15\,\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1425A. The top drive was picked up, and the pipe was spaced out, positioning the bit at a depth of 1913.4 mbrf. The first barrel was recovered empty (water core), so the bit was lowered $3.0\textrm{m}$ to $1916.4\ \mathrm{mbrf}_{\lambda}$ , and the process was repeated. Hole U1425E was ultimately spudded at $1945\mathrm{~h~}$ on 24 September. The first core barrel recovered $5.69\mathrm{~m~}$ of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 1920.2 mbrf. APC coring continued using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1425E-13H to a total depth of $113.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Total recovery for Hole U1425E was $107.75\mathrm{~m~}$ $(95\%)$ . A total of 13 cores were recovered in this hole, all using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels.  

The top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0435\;\mathrm{h}$ on 25 September. All drill collars were laid out to the forward pipe rack, and the bit was clear of the rotary table by $0910\,\mathrm{h}$ . The bit and bit sub were removed, and the outer barrel coring system was disassembled. The rig floor was secured for transit by $0950\,\mathrm{h}$ . Thrusters were raised, and the sea passage to Busan was initiated at $1012\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 September, successfully ending all coring operations of Expedition 346.  

# Site U1426  

Four holes were cored at Site U1426 (proposed Site YB-2) using the full and half APC and the XCB (Table T1; Fig. F38). Holes U1426A, U1426B, U1426C, and U1426D were cored to 396.7, 34.7, 204.0, and $99.4~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and recovered 418.78, 35.82, 211.89, $103.71\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, respectively. A total of 95 APC and 2 XCB cores obtained $770.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ( $104.8\%$ recovery). The APCT-3 was deployed four times.  

# Transit from Site U1425  

The $148\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1426 was covered in $13.4\;\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $11\;\mathrm{kt}.$ . The sea passage ended at $0636~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 September 2013. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $0715\;\mathrm{h}$ , the vessel was stabilized for rig floor operations to begin. A Falmouth Scientific positioning beacon (model BAP-547; SN1028W, 16 KHz, 206 dB) was deployed at $0822\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Hole U1426A  

A three-stand APC/XCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was run to the seafloor. After picking up the top drive and spacing out the drill string to a depth of 907.4 mbrf, which was $6.0\;\mathrm{m}$ below the depth provided by the PDR, an APC core barrel was deployed. The first core barrel recovered $2.47~\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 914.4 mbrf. Oriented APC coring continued using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1426A-28H at $256.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. At this depth, the APC was switched to the half APC $(4.7\textrm{m})$ ) system, and coring continued through Core 37H ( $297.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), where a solid dolomite layer was encountered. The XCB was picked up and used to cut a $1.0\;\mathrm{m}$ core (38X) until breaking through the layer of resistance. Half APC coring resumed from that point and continued through Core 59H $396.7\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). The hole was displaced with 160 bbl of 10.5 ppg mud. The top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $2330~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 September, ending Hole U1426A. Total recovery for this hole was $418.78\mathrm{~m~}(105.6\%)$ . A total of 29 half APC cores were recovered. Four successful temperature measurements were taken using the APCT-3 temperature shoe at 31.0, 59.5, 88.0, and $116.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, respectively.  

# Hole U1426B  

The ship was offset $15\,\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1426A, and the bit was positioned $3\,\mathrm{m}$ lower at a depth of 910.4 mbrf. Hole U1426B was spudded at $0045\mathrm{~h~}$ on 5 September. Recovery from the first core established a seafloor depth of 913.7 mbrf. APC coring continued with four cores recovered for intensive geochemistry sampling to a depth of $34.7\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. By $0215\;\mathrm{h}$ , the last core barrel had been laid out and the rig floor prepared for tripping pipe. Because the hole was shallow, the pipe was tripped out of the hole with the top drive in place. The bit cleared the seafloor at $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ , officially ending Hole U1426B. Recovered core totaled $35.82\;\mathrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ .  

# Hole U1426C  

The ship was offset $15\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1426A. The top drive was picked up, the bit was positioned at 911.4 mbrf, and Hole U1426C was spudded at $0250\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 September. The mudline core established a seafloor depth of 914.4 mbrf. APC coring continued through Core 346-U1426C-15H to $128.3\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. XCB Core 16X cut through a hard dolomite layer, allowing the continuation of APC coring. Full-length core barrels were used through Core $24\mathrm{H}$ to $206\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The hole was plugged and abandoned with 80 bbl of 10.5 ppg mud. The drill string was pulled with the top drive to 895 mbrf, clearing the seafloor at $1425\,\mathrm{h}$ . This ended Hole U1426C. Total recovery for this hole was $211.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(103.9\%)$ . There were no half APC cores from this hole.  

# Hole U1426D  

The ship was offset $15\;\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1426A. The top drive was picked up, and the bit was positioned at 909.4 mbrf. Hole U1426D was spudded at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 September. The sediment/water interface was recovered in Core 1H, establishing a seafloor depth of 914.4 mbrf. APC coring continued with 11 full-length cores recovered to $99.4~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The hole was plugged and abandoned with $40~\mathrm{bbl}$ of $10.5~\mathrm{ppg}$ mud. The top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 September. The bit subsequently cleared the rotary table at $2235\ \mathrm{h}$ . The rig floor was secured for transit, thrusters were raised, and the sea passage to Site U1427 began at $2342\mathrm{~h~}$ on 5 September. Total recovery for this hole was $103.71\mathrm{~m~}$ $(104.3\%)$ . There were no half APC cores taken from this hole.  

# Site U1427  

Site U1427 (proposed Site YB-1) was occupied at two different times during Expedition 346, first following operations at Site U1426 (6 September 2013) and then $\sim\!\!2$ weeks later after completing operations at Site U1430 (22 September), to acquire additional material for postcruise studies. A return to Site U1427 was possible because all scientific and operations objectives were met ${\sim}5$ days before the end of the expedition; therefore, the remaining time available was spent reoccupying two sites drilled earlier in the expedition (Sites U1427 and U1425). Preliminary shipboard scientific results from Holes U1427A and U1427B indicated that this site exhibits a continuous late Pleistocene sedimentary sequence with high sedimentation rates and excellent carbonate preservation, both of which are ideal for high-resolution paleoceanographic studies. Therefore, we drilled Hole U1427C during the revisit.  

Three holes were cored at Site U1427 using the full and half APC and the XCB. Hole U1427A was cored to $548.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (81 cores) with a recovery of $542.59\;\mathrm{m}$ $(98.9\%)$ . Hole U1427B was cored to $405.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (65 cores) with a recovery of $422.41\mathrm{~m~}$ $(105\%)$ . Hole U1427C was cored to $351.1\;\mathrm{m}$ (52 cores) with a recovery of $367.77\mathrm{~m~}$ $(105\%)$ (Table T1; Fig. F38). Four formation temperature measurements were performed, and downhole wireline log data were obtained to $548.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF in Hole U1427A.  

An exciting aspect of operations at Site U1427 included the acquisition of the deepest continuously recovered APC-cored sequence in DSDP/ODP/IODP history and the deepest piston core, 81H, from $490.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Transit from Site U1426  

The $66\;\mathrm{nmi}$ distance to Site U1427 was covered in $6\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at an average speed of $11.1\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $0542\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 September. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, a wide-angle positioning beacon was deployed, thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $0615\,\mathrm{h}$ , the vessel was stabilized, and rig floor operations began.  

# Hole U1427A  

A three-stand APC/XCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was run to bottom. After picking up the top drive and spacing out the drill string to a depth of 329.4 mbrf ( $\left(6.0\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ above PDR depth), an APC core barrel was deployed. The first core barrel recovered $1.79\:\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 337.1 mbrf. Oriented APC coring continued using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1427A$25\mathrm{H}$ to $228.7\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The base of Core 25H recovered reworked volcanic sand, and the next core contained volcanic ash. At that point, we switched to the half APC system and continued coring through Core 81H to a depth of $490.4\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, making this, as mentioned above, the deepest continuously cored sequence ever recovered with the APC coring system in DSDP/ODP/IODP history. An additional 6 XCB cores were cut to a final total depth of $548.6\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The hole was circulated and displaced with 10.5 ppg weighted mud, the top drive was set back, and the pipe was pulled up to logging depth $\mathbf{\langle80\mathrm{~m~WSF}]}$ ). Rig-up for wireline logging began at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 September. Both the paleo-combo and FMS-sonic tool strings were deployed to $548.5\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, and all wireline logging runs were successful. By $1715\;\mathrm{h}$ that same day, the rig floor was rigged down from logging. The pipe was lowered (without the top drive) to $519\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and a $10\;\mathrm{bbl}$ ( $24~\mathrm{m}$ long) 14.5 ppg cement plug was displaced using a circulating head. The drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $2020\;\mathrm{h}$ on 8 September, ending Hole U1427A and beginning Hole U1427B. Total recovery for this hole was $542.6\;\mathrm{m}$ $(99\%)$ . A total of 56 half APC cores were recovered. Four formation temperature measurements were taken using the APCT-3 temperature shoe at 30.3, 58.8, 87.3, and $115.8\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Hole U1427B  

Once clear of the seafloor, the drill string was thoroughly flushed to remove any remnant cement, and an XCB was deployed to aid in flushing/cleaning the lockable flow valve. The XCB was recovered and the ship was offset $15\textrm{m}$ north of Hole U1427A. The bit was placed at a depth of $332.4~\mathrm{mbrf}_{1}$ , and an APC core barrel was deployed. Hole U1427B was spudded at $2220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 September, and the $4.8\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered from the mudline core established a seafloor depth of 337.1 mbrf. APC coring with full core barrels continued through Core 346-U1427B-6H to $52.3\textrm{m}$ CSF-A before a $1.0\;\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval was used to correct the core break offsets. APC coring continued through Core 12H to a depth of $100.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, where a second $^1\textrm{m}$ advance was made. APC coring resumed, recovering Cores 14H through 28H to $235.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. This barrel was an incomplete stroke and was very near the interval in Hole U1427A where the APC met refusal. Eight half APC cores were then recovered (Cores 29H through 36H) to a depth of $273.4\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Because the overpull was zero for the previous six cores, we switched back to full APC barrels beginning with Core 37H. However, this core failed to fully penetrate the formation, and coring resumed at that point using the half APC system once again. A $1.0\;\mathrm{m}$ advance was made to properly align the core breaks, and coring then continued recovering half APC Cores 39H through 47H to $325.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. There, another $3\;\mathrm{m}$ “drill ahead” advance was made to realign core breaks, which had drifted close to stacking up with the earlier hole. With the exception of a fourth drill ahead of $2\,\mathrm{m}$ after Core 52H, half APC coring continued through Core $65\mathrm{H}$ to a total depth of $405.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The hole was displaced with $190\;\mathrm{bbl}$ of 10.5 ppg mud, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor by $0605\mathrm{~h~}$ on 10 September. The bit cleared the rotary table at $0735\mathrm{~h~}$ , the positioning beacon was recovered aboard by $0752\;\mathrm{h}$ , and by $0830\;\mathrm{h}$ the ship was under way for the next drill site (U1428). Total recovery for Hole U1427B was $422.41\mathrm{~m~}$ $(105\%)$ . Of the 61 cores recovered, 32 were half APC cores.  

# Return to Site U1427  

The $182\;\mathrm{nmi}$ between Sites U1430 and U1427 were covered in $17.2~\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $10.6~\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $0830~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 September. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, and a Falmouth Scientific positioning beacon (model BAP-547; SN1028W, 16 KHz, 206 dB) was deployed at $0958~\mathrm{h}$ . Thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ , the vessel was stabilized and rig floor operations began.  

# Hole U1427C  

The APC/XCB BHA was quickly assembled, and the drill string was run to bottom. For this hole, the ship was positioned $15\,\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1427A. The top drive was picked up and the pipe was spaced out, positioning the bit at a depth of 336 mbrf. Hole U1427C was spudded at $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 September. The first core barrel recovered $8.05\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 337.5 mbrf. APC coring continued using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1427C-10H to $93.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. A single half APC core was then taken (Core 11H) to adjust the core break offset. APC coring then continued using full barrels through Core 25H to $224.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA. Coring continued from that point using the half APC through Core 52H to a total depth of $351.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The hole was displaced with $140~\mathrm{bbl}$ of $10.5\;\mathrm{ppg}$ weighted mud, the top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $1710~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 September. The bit was clear of the rotary table by $1815\;\mathrm{h}$ . During the pipe trip, the positioning beacon was recovered at $1739\mathrm{~h~}$ . The bit and bit sub were removed, and the rig floor was secured for transit by $1845\mathrm{~h~}$ . Thrusters and hydrophones were pulled, and the sea voyage to the next site was initiated at $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 September. Total recovery for Hole U1427C was $367.77\mathrm{~m~}$ $(105\%)$ . Of the total 52 cores recovered, 25 were full APC cores and 27 were half APC cores. There were no cores cut using the XCB.  

# Sites U1428 and U1429  

Two holes were cored at primary Site U1428 (proposed Site ECS-1B), and three holes were cored at alternate Site U1429 (alternate Site ECS-1C) using the full and half APC and the XCB. At both sites, nonmagnetic core barrels were used with the APC system. Only full APC core barrels were oriented. In Hole U1428A, 26 cores extended from the seafloor to 211.5 m CSF-A, including seven drilled intervals (totaling $37.6\;\mathrm{m}$ ) through thick sand beds. The cored interval in Hole U1428A was $173.9\mathrm{~m~}$ , with a recovery of $178.86\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(103\%)$ (Table T1; Fig. F38). After completing Hole U1428A, we moved to Site U1429, which was estimated to have higher LSRs and, therefore, an expanded late Pleistocene section.  

APC coring at Site U1429 was uneventful. Hole U1429A penetrated to $188.3\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A},$ including two drilled intervals totaling $4.1\textrm{m}$ . Core recovery for Hole U1429A was $190.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(103\%)$ . Hole U1429B penetrated to $186.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, with a recovery of $200.9\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(108\%)$ . Hole U1429C penetrated to $179.2\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, including two drilled intervals totaling $4.9\;\mathrm{m}$ . Core recovery for Hole U1429C was $180.7\;\mathrm{m}$ $(104\%)$ .  

After completing the three holes at Site U1429, we returned to Site U1428 to drill a second, additional hole that provided material to build a complete spliced section at this site spanning at least the last ${\sim}0.3\mathrm{~m.y.}$ . and to provide additional material for high-resolution paleoceanographic studies. Hole U1428B was subsequently APC cored to $143.3\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (16 cores), with a recovery of $145.85\mathrm{~m~}(102\%)$ .  

# Transit from Site U1427  

The transit to Site U1428 included a short stop offshore at Kitakyushu, Japan, to evacuate a scientist suffering from kidney stones. The $248\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to the rendezvous coordinates $34^{\circ}30.0^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $130^{\circ}23.0^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ) was covered at an average speed of $10.8~\mathrm{kt}.$ . The designated rendezvous time was $0800\;\mathrm{h}$ on the morning of 11 September 2013. Coordination of the medical evacuation was provided by the Sea Trade and Agency Yokohama and locally by Green Shipping in Moji, Japan. The JOIDES Resolution was on location for the evacuation at $0736\,\mathrm{h}$ . The sea-going tug Musashi Maru 2 was alongside by $0752\,\mathrm{h}$ . The transfer was completed safely and efficiently by $0754~\mathrm{h}$ . The tug was clear by $0755\,\mathrm{h}$ and headed back to shore. The JOIDES Resolution then resumed course for Site U1428. The remaining $228\ \mathrm{nmi}$ distance was covered in $21~\mathrm{{h}}$ at an average speed of $10.9~\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $0500~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 September. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 September, the vessel was stabilized and rig floor operations began. A Falmouth Scientific positioning beacon (model BAP-547; SN1028W, 16 KHz, 206 dB) was deployed at $0614\;\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Hole U1428A  

A three-stand APC/XCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was run to bottom. During the pipe trip, the vibration-isolated television (VIT) subsea camera was deployed. The top drive was picked up, and the drill string was spaced out to just above the seafloor. Because of the presence of submarine cables in the vicinity of this site, a camera survey of the seafloor was conducted to ensure that no holes were spudded into a submarine cable. This was considered precautionary only because the closest cables to the drill site should have been nearly $2\textrm{n m i}$ away. A box survey was conducted radiating out from the drill site coordinates in $5\textrm{m}$ increments. The total outside diameter of the box was $25\;\mathrm{m}$ . This ensured that any of the holes spudded within $15\textrm{m}$ of Hole U1428A would be well within the preinspected area. The survey was completed at $1200\,\mathrm{h}_{\cdot}$ , and after returning to zero-zero coordinates, a tag of the seafloor with the drill bit was observed on camera. This established a drill string tag depth of $735.3\;\mathrm{mbrf}$ , or $1.6\;\mathrm{m}$ shallower than the depth predicted with the PDR. The pipe was then picked up $3\;\mathrm{m}$ , placing the bit at $732.3\ \mathrm{mbrf}$ , and Hole U1428A was spudded at $1230~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 September. The first core barrel recovered $6.37\textrm{m}$ of core, establishing an “official” seafloor depth of 735.4 mbrf. Oriented APC coring continued using fulllength nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1428A-18H to a depth of 150.1 m CSF-A. Half APC coring continued from that point through Core 346-U1428A-32H to a total depth of $211.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Because of the large accumulation of sand in the formation, further coring at this site was abandoned. The hole was displaced with 80 bbl of 10.5 ppg weighted mud, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0735\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 September. The bit was clear of the rotary table by $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ . The positioning beacon was recovered at $0811\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the ship was secured for transit by $0940\;\mathrm{h}$ . Thrusters and hydrophones were pulled, and the sea voyage to Site U1429 was initiated at $1024\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 13 September. Total recovery for Hole U1428A was $178.86\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(103\%)$ . There were no half APC cores taken in this hole; however, there were seven drilled intervals totaling $37.6\mathrm{~m~}$ . Three successful formation temperature measurements were taken using the APCT-3 temperature shoe at 34.9, 63.4, and $120.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA. A fourth temperature measurement attempted on Core 10H failed because of insertion into sand.  

# Transit from Site U1428  

The transit to Site U1429 included a brief stop while en route to discharge another scientist, this one suffering from a severe case of shingles. The scientist was removed from the JOIDES Resolution by a Japanese Coast Guard helicopter. The transfer was completed safely and efficiently by $1100~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September. The JOIDES Resolution then resumed full speed for Site U1429. The $228\ \mathrm{nmi}$ to Site U1429 was covered in $1.6\,\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $7.4\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $1215\;\mathrm{h}_{\phantom{\mathrm{}}}$ , the JOIDES Resolution was stabilized, and rig floor operations began.  

# Hole U1429A  

A three-stand APC/XCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was run to bottom. During the pipe trip, the VIT subsea camera was deployed. The top drive was picked up, and the drill string was spaced out to just above the seafloor. As at the previous site, a camera survey of the seafloor was conducted to ensure that no holes were spudded into a submarine cable. As before, a box survey was conducted radiating out from the drill site coordinates in $5\;\mathrm{m}$ increments. The total outside diameter of the box was again $25\;\mathrm{m}$ . This ensured that any of the holes spudded within $15\;\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1429A would be well within the preinspected area. The survey began at $1735\,\mathrm{h}$ and was completed by $1945\;\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September. After returning to zero-zero coordinates, a tag of the seafloor with the drill bit was observed on camera. This established a drill string tag depth of 743.6 mbrf, or $2.8~\mathrm{m}$ shallower than the depth predicted with the PDR. The pipe was then picked up $3\,\mathrm{m}$ , placing the bit at $740.6\,\mathrm{mbrf}_{1}$ , and Hole U1429A was spudded at $2045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September. The first core barrel recovered $6.4~\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishing an “official” seafloor depth of 743.7 mbrf. Oriented APC coring continued using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1429A-23H to 188.3 m CSF-A. As at Site U1428, large accumulations of volcanic sand in the formation prevented coring to the original deeper objectives. This led to the decision to complete three APC holes through the upper section $\mathrm{\Omega}_{\sim200\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})}$ and then abandon the site. The hole was displaced with 75 bbl of $10.5\,\mathrm{ppg}$ weighted mud, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September, ending Hole U1429A and beginning Hole U1429B. Total recovery for this hole was $190.29\mathrm{~m~}$ $(103\%)$ . No half APC cores were taken in this hole; however, there were two drilled intervals totaling $4.1\;\mathrm{m}$ to adjust the core breaks. Four successful formation temperature measurements were taken using the APCT-3 temperature shoe at 34.9, 61.1, 89.6, and $116.4\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Hole U1429B  

Because a massive sand horizon was also present at this site, the operations plan was revised to eliminate any deep penetration attempt. Instead, the focus was on obtaining two additional ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{~m~}$ holes to thoroughly recover the upper section. Hole U1429B began as the drill string cleared the seafloor. The ship was offset $15\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1429A. The bit was positioned at 736.6 mbrf. An APC core barrel was deployed, and Hole U1429B was spudded at $0935\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September. The $2.93\:\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered established a seafloor depth of 743.2 mbrf. APC coring with full-length core barrels continued through Core 346-U1429B-22H to $186.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Partial strokes were experienced on Cores 6H, 18H, and 22H; however, all others were full stroke. Hole U1429B was once again terminated just into the volcanic sand. The hole was displaced with $75~\mathrm{bbl}$ of 10.5 ppg mud, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $2210~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September, ending Hole U1429B. Total recovery for this hole was $200.92\:\mathrm{m}$ $(108\%)$ . Of the 22 cores recovered, all were full-barrel cores. There were no attempted half APC cores.  

# Hole U1429C  

Hole U1429C began as the drill string cleared the seafloor. The ship was offset $15~\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1429A. The bit was positioned at 738.6 mbrf. An APC core barrel was deployed, and Hole U1429C was spudded at $2235\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September. The $4.16\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered established a seafloor depth of 744.0 mbrf. APC coring with full-length core barrels continued through Core 346-U1429C-24H to $179.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Partial strokes were experienced on Cores 6H, 16H, 20H, and 24H; however, all others were full stroke. The hole was once again terminated just into the volcanic sand. Total recovery for Hole U1429C was $180.70~\mathrm{m}$ $(103.7\%)$ . Of the 22 cores recovered, all were full-barrel cores. There were no attempted half APC cores.  

Hole U1429C was displaced with 75 bbl of 10.5 ppg mud, the top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $1055\mathrm{~h~}$ on 15 September. The pipe was tripped back to the surface, and the BHA racked back in the derrick. Because the move back to Site U1428 was only $4\mathrm{\nmi}$ , the last stand with the bit and outer core barrel components was left hanging on the hook through the rotary table. This saved time and allowed the ship to get under way faster. The positioning beacon was recovered back aboard during the pipe trip at $1142\,\mathrm{h}$ . The ship was secured for transit by $1225\,\mathrm{h}$ . Thrusters and hydrophones were pulled, and the sea voyage to Site U1428 was initiated at $1242\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 15 September.  

# Return to Site U1428  

The transit back to Site U1428 was quickly accomplished. The $4.0\;\mathrm{nmi}$ distance was covered in just $0.75~\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $5.3~\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $1330\;\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $1345\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the JOIDES Resolution was stabilized, and rig floor operations began.  

# Hole U1428B  

Because of the shallow nature of the single hole and short duration on site, a positioning beacon was not deployed to the seabed. The APC/XCB BHA was quickly assembled, and the drill string was run to bottom. The ship was offset $15~\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1428A. The top drive was picked up, and the pipe was spaced out, positioning the bit at 728.8 mbrf. Hole U1428B was spudded at $1635\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September. The first core barrel recovered $2.49\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishing a seafloor depth of 735.8 mbrf. APC coring continued using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1428B16H to $143.3\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Hole U1428B was displaced with 55 bbl of 10.5 ppg weighted mud, the top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September. The bit was clear of the rotary table by $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ . The bit and bit sub were removed, and the ship was secured for transit by $0345\;\mathrm{h}$ . Thrusters and hydrophones were pulled, and the sea voyage to Site U1430 was initiated at $0418~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September. Total recovery for this hole was $145.85\mathrm{~m~}$ $(102\%)$ . Of the 16 cores recovered, all were full-barrel cores. There were no attempted half APC cores.  

# Site U1430  

Three holes were cored at Site U1430 using the full and half APC and the XCB. Oriented, nonmagnetic core barrels were used with the full APC system in Hole U1430A. Half APC cores in Hole U1430A were not oriented but used nonmagnetic barrels. A total of 29 APC cores and 3 XCB cores penetrated to $274.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1430A, recovering $258.24\mathrm{~m~}(94\%)$ . In Hole U1430B, 29 APC cores and 8 XCB cores extended from the seafloor to $275\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, recovering $259.71\mathrm{~m~}$ $(94\%)$ . In Hole U1430C, 33 APC cores and 1 XCB core penetrated to $250\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, recovering $257.02\;\mathrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ . Total core recovery for Site U1430 was $775~\mathrm{m}$ (Table T1; Fig. F38).  

# Transit from Site U1428  

The transit to Site U1430 was slowed somewhat by the effects of the distant tropical storm Man-yi, which passed ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{nmi}$ to the east of the JOIDES Resolution off the eastern side of Japan. Strong winds (sustained at $36~\mathrm{kt}$ and gusting to $48\;\mathrm{kt}$ ) caused some heavy seas and a reduced transit speed of $9.0\;\mathrm{kt}$ . The $430.5\;\mathrm{nmi}$ total distance was ultimately covered in $44.0~\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $9.8~\mathrm{kt}$ . The sea passage ended at $0018\;\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September 2013. The vessel was maneuvered over the location coordinates, thrusters were lowered into position, and the vessel was turned over to dynamic positioning control. By $0100~\mathrm{h}$ , the JOIDES Resolution was stabilized, and rig floor operations began.  

# Hole U1430A  

A Falmouth Scientific positioning beacon (model BAP-547; SN1028W, 16 KHz, 206 dB) was deployed at $0123~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September. A three-stand APC/XCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was run to bottom. The top drive was picked up, and the bit was positioned at 1077.7 mbrf, $3.0\textrm{m}$ above the PDR depth. Hole U1430A was spudded at $0445\mathrm{~h~}$ on 18 September. The first core barrel recovered $3.58\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment, establishing a seafloor depth of 1083.6 mbrf. Oriented APC coring continued using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1430A-25H to 230.7 m CSF-A. Half APC coring with nonmagnetic core barrels continued through Core 29H to $249.5\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, where refusal was reached in acoustic basement. The XCB was then used to advance the hole to $274.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Cores 30X through 32X). XCB coring was problematic because of the nature of the interbedded hard/soft layering of the formation. Based on poor recovery and slow penetration rates with the XCB, the decision was made to stop coring in this hole. Hole U1430A was circulated and displaced with $114~\mathrm{bbl}$ of 10.5 ppg heavy mud, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 September, ending the hole. Total recovery for Hole U1430A was $258.24\mathrm{~m~}(94\%).$ ; however, core recovery with the XCB system was only $1.12\,\mathrm{m}$ of the $24.9~\mathrm{m}$ advanced $(4.5\%)$ . Four successful formation temperature measurements were taken using the APCT-3 temperature shoe at 32.1, 60.6, 89.1, and $117.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Hole U1430B  

The ship was offset $15\textrm{m}$ north of Hole U1430A. The bit was positioned at 1081.7 mbrf. An APC core barrel was deployed, and Hole U1430B was spudded at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 September. The $8.27\textrm{m}$ of core recovered established a seafloor depth of 1082.9 mbrf. APC coring with full-length core barrels continued through Core 346-U1430B25H to $234.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. This was followed by the half APC system for Cores 26H through 28H to $246.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. At that point, we switched to XCB and recovered Cores 29X through 36X to $274.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. One final half APC core (37H) advanced the hole to a total depth of $275.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The hole was displaced with 114 bbl of 10.5 ppg mud, the top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled up to a logging depth of $79.1\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. Rig-up for wireline logging began at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 September. Because of the shallow hole depth and to maximize the logging data acquired, the triple combination tool string was split into two shorter tool strings. All logging runs reached within a few meters of total hole depth, and all wireline logging runs were considered successful. By $1530~\mathrm{h}$ , the rig floor was rigged down from logging, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $1550\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 September, ending Hole U1430B. Total recovery for Hole U1430B was $259.71\;\mathrm{m}$ $(94\%)$ . A total of 25 full  

APC cores and 4 half APC cores were recovered. As in Hole U1430A, recovery with the XCB remained poor. Eight XCB cores were attempted, penetrating $28.1\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovering only $5.94\:\mathrm{m}$ $(21\%)$ .  

# Hole U1430C  

Hole U1430C began as the drill string cleared the seafloor. The ship was offset $15~\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1430A. The bit was positioned at 1079.7 mbrf. An APC core barrel was deployed, and Hole U1430C was spudded at $1645\;\mathrm{h}$ on 20 September. The $4.78\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered established a seafloor depth of 1084.4 mbrf. Oriented APC coring continued using full-length nonmagnetic core barrels through Core 346-U1430C-26H to $227.3\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. A single XCB barrel (Core 27X) was deployed to drill through a hard layer, penetrating $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . This core recovered $0.05\;\mathrm{m}$ of dolomite fragments. Half APC coring with nonmagnetic core barrels continued, recovering Cores 28H through 34H to $250.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The hole was displaced with 100 bbl of 10.5 ppg weighted mud, the top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at 1215 h on 21 September. The bit was clear of the rotary table, the bit and bit sub were removed, and the rig floor was secured for transit by $1500~\mathrm{h}$ . Thrusters and hydrophones were pulled, and the sea voyage to the next site was initiated at $1518\;\mathrm{h}$ on 21 September. Total recovery for Hole U1430C was $257.02\:\mathrm{m}\:(103\%)$ . Of the 34 cores recovered, 26 were full APC cores, 7 were half APC-cores, and 1 was an XCB core.  

# Return to Sites U1427 and U1425  

Because of excellent success throughout the expedition with high core recovery stratigraphic correlation, and operations and enjoying the benefit of highly advantageous weather, we had the unusual opportunity to return to several of the previously occupied Expedition 346 sites for additional coring. After extensive discussions with the shipboard science party, technical support staff, and operations superintendent, it was deemed most appropriate to return to Sites U1427 and U1425. The order in which we returned to the two sites was dictated by scientific priority, the most efficient use of transit times, and consideration of end of expedition requirements. The science party and Sample Allocation Committee anticipated that there will be many sample requests for those two sites and that additional coring there would be highly beneficial. For details about the return to these two sites (and operations in Holes U1427C and U1425E, respectively), please refer to the operations sections describing those sites.  

# Transit from Site U1425 to Busan, Korea  

The transit to Busan was completed without incident. The vessel arrived at the Busan pilot station at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 September. The Asian Monsoon Expedition 346 officially ended 24 h early with the first line ashore at 0651 h on 27 September.  

It seems only fitting that on this research voyage, which is the last of this phase of IODP, that we draw attention to the fact that this expedition set the record for the most amount of core recovered during any single research cruise by IODP. That the recovery of $6135\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment occurred during only ${\sim}6$ weeks of drilling operations makes this accomplishment even more remarkable. In combination with the record achieved of acquiring the deepest piston core (and deepest continually piston cored sequence at Site U1427), these achievements speak of the commitment to excellence, teamwork, and, to be direct, impressively hard work of men and women dedicated to the pursuit of scientific knowledge about Planet Earth.
