# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 397T sought to address the shortage of drilling time caused by COVID-19 mitigation during Expedition 391 (Walvis Ridge Hotspot) by drilling at two sites omitted from the earlier cruise. A week of coring time was added to a transit o f JOIDES Resolution from Cape Town to Lisbon, which would cross Walvis Ridge on its way north. These two sites were located on two of the three seamount trails that emerge from the split i n Walvis Ridge morphology into several seamount chains at $2^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ . Site U1584 (proposed Site GT-6A ) sampled the Gough track on the east, and Site U1585 (proposed Site TT-4A) sampled the Trista n track on the west. Together with Site U1578, drilled on the Center track during Expedition 391, they form a transect across the northern Walvis Ridge Guyot Province. The goal was to core seamount basalts and associated volcanic material for geochemical and isotopic, geochronologic, paleomagnetic, and volcanologic study. Scientifically, one emphasis was to better understand th e split in geochemical and isotopic signatures that occurs at the morphologic split. Geochronolog y would add to the established age progression but also give another dimension to understandin g Walvis Ridge seamount formation by giving multiple ages at the same sites. The paleomagneti c study seeks to establish paleolatitudes for Walvis Ridge sites for comparison with those publishe d from hotspot seamount chains in the Pacific, in particular to test whether a component of tru e polar wander affects hotspot paleolatitude.  

Hole U1584A cored a $66.4~\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary and volcaniclastic section with two lithostratigraphic units. Unit I is a $23\,\textrm{m}$ thick sequence of bioturbated clay and nannofossil chalk wit h increasing volcaniclastic content downhole. Unit II is a ${>}43\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of lapillistone wit h basalt fragments. Because the seismic section crossing the site shows no evidence as to the dept h of the volcaniclastic cover, coring was terminated early. Because there were no other shallo w nearby sites with different character on existing seismic lines, the unused operations time fro m Site U1584 was shifted to the next site.  

The seismic reflector interpreted as the top of igneous rock at Site U1585 once again resulted fro m volcaniclastic deposits. Hole U1585A coring began at 144.1 mbsf and penetrated a $273.5\;\mathrm{m}$ thic k sedimentary and volcaniclastic section atop a $81.2\;\mathrm{m}$ thick series of massive basalt flows. The hol e was terminated at 498.8 mbsf because allotted operational time expired. The sedimentary sectio n contains four main units. Unit I (144.1–157.02 mbsf) is a bioturbated nannofossil chalk with foraminifera, similar to the shallowest sediments recovered at Site U1584. Unit II (157.02–249.2 0 mbsf), which is divided into two subunits, is a $92.2\textrm{m}$ thick succession of massive and bedde d pumice and scoria lapillistone with increased reworking, clast alteration, and tuffaceous chal k intercalations downhole. Unit III $(249.20{-}397.76\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ is $148.6\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists of a comple x succession of pink to greenish gray tuffaceous chalk containing multiple thin, graded ash turbidites and tuffaceous ash layers; intercalated tuffaceous chalk slumps; and several thick coarse lapilli and block-dominated volcaniclastic layers. Befitting the complexity, it is divided into eight subunits (IIIA–IIIH). Three of these subunits (IIIA, IIID, and IIIG) are mainly basalt breccias. Unit I V (397.76–417.60 mbsf) is a volcanic breccia, $19.8\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, containing mostly juvenile volcaniclasts. The igneous section, Unit V $(417.60{-}498.80\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ is composed of a small number of massiv e basaltic lava flows. It is divided into three lithologic units, with Unit 2 represented by a single $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ piece of quenched basalt with olivine phenocrysts in a microcrystalline groundmass. This piec e may represent a poorly recovered set of pillow lavas. Unit 1 is sparsely to highly olivine-clinopyroxene $\pm$ plagioclase phyric massive basalt and is divided into Subunits 1a and 1b based on textural and mineralogical differences, which suggests that they are two different flows. Unit 3 als o consists of two massive lava flows with no clear boundary features. Subunit 3a is a $10.3~\mathrm{m}$ thic k highly clinopyroxene-plagioclase phyric massive basalt flow with a fine-grained groundmass. Subunit 3b is a featureless massive basalt flow that is moderately to highly clinopyroxene-olivine-plagioclase phyric and ${>}43.7\mathrm{~m~}$ thick. Alteration of the lava flows is patchy and moderate to low i n grade, with two stages, one at a higher temperature and one at a low temperature, both focuse d around fractures.  

The Site U1585 chronologic succession from basalt flows to pelagic sediment indicates volcani c construction and subsidence. Lava eruptions were followed by inundation and shallow-water volcaniclastic sediment deposition, which deepened over time to deepwater conditions. Although th e massive flows were probably erupted in a short time and have little variability, volcaniclasts in th e sediments may provide geochemical and geochronologic data from a range of time and sources. Chemical analyses indicate that Site U1585 basalt samples are mostly alkalic basalt, with a fe w trachybasalt flow and clast samples and one basaltic trachyandesite clast. Ti/V ratios lie mostl y within the oceanic island basalt (OIB) field but overlap the mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) field. Only a handful of clasts from Site U1584 were analyzed, but geochemical data are similar. Paleomagnetic data from Site U1585 indicate that the sediments and basalt units are strongly magneti c and mostly give coherent inclination data, which indicates that the basaltic section and ${\sim}133\;\mathrm{m}$ o f overlying volcaniclastic sediment is reversely polarized and that this reversal is preserved in a core. Above this, the rest of the sediment section records two normal and two reversed zones. Althoug h there are not enough basalt flows to give a reliable paleolatitude, it may be possible to attain such  a result from the sediments.  

# 1. Introduction  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 397T sought to address the omissio n of two drill sites during Expedition 391 (Walvis Ridge Hotspot) caused by loss of time due t o COVID-19 mitigation. The R/V JOIDES Resolution would necessarily pass over Walvis Ridge o n its transit north from Cape Town to Lisbon to begin a campaign of northern hemisphere drilling. Making the most of the opportunity, 7 days of operations time were added to the transit for corin g at Walvis Ridge. The drilling time was limited to that amount by the length of the transit (Figur e F1) and maintenance of the ship’s schedule. Despite the limited operations time, it was decided t o attempt coring at two sites on what was originally planned as a three-hole transect for Expeditio n 391. The transect crosses the three seamount chains in the Walvis Ridge Guyot Province at a location slightly younger than the morphologic split of the chain from one to three chains (Figure F2). The three chains have the provisional names Tristan track, Center track, and Gough track, wit h the first and last names indicating that the western and eastern chains lead to the volcanicall y active islands of the Tristan da Cunha group and Gough. A hole was drilled at Site U1578 int o ${\sim}302\,\mathrm{m}$ of a volcanic sequence on a Center track seamount during Expedition 391 (Figure F2). Th e aim of Expedition 397T was to sample the two outboard seamount chains at proposed Sites GT6A (Gough track) and TT-3A (Tristan track).  

It was clear that this goal was aspirational because the combined estimated operations time for th e two sites, from Expedition 391 planning, was 9.3 days, but only 7 operational days were allotted t o Expedition 397T. Recognizing this time squeeze, planning sought to reduce operations that wer e not related to coring igneous rock, the main goal of the project. The shallowest sites were chosen,

Site GT-6A on the upper flank of the Gough track seamount and Site TT-3A on the top of th e Tristan track seamount. Shallower sites require less core retrieval wireline time. Site GT-6A was  a new site proposed to take advantage of thinner sediment near the edge of the flank sediment pile. Drilling without coring through most of the sediment package was approved for both sites becaus e these sediments would be similar to those cored at Site U1578. To further save time, the mudlin e was established for both sites by lowering the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) to the estimated seafloor depth and coring until sediment was encountered. This required less time than sending  a camera down the drill string to observe the sea bottom. Even with attempts to minimize drill time, Expedition 397T required a healthy dose of geologic luck. Site U1578 was just right, with a lon g series of lava flows that cored easily underlying a short sediment section. The basalt units contained abundant glass, geochemical variations, and minerals sought by geochemists for study. Would the Expedition 397T sites be as cooperative? No. Expedition 397T was a reminder tha t seamount geology is complex and poorly understood and drilling options are usually constraine d by limited academic site survey data. Drilling at Site U1584 (proposed Site GT-6A) plunged int o volcaniclastics with no seismic evidence of a bottom. Because there were no other sites that had  a different character, the decision was made to terminate coring early after only $66.4~\mathrm{m}$ of corin g (Table T1). The unused time was shifted to the next site, U1585. Because a guyot summit ma y accumulate volcaniclastics from shallow-water eruptions, a decision was made to drill propose d Site TT-4A on the lower flank of the same volcano as proposed Site TT-3A. The seismic sectio n across the site has a similar appearance to that of Site U1578. The extra wireline time for th e deeper site would be made up with time saved from Site U1584. Drilling at Site U1585 (propose d Site TT-4A) also plunged into a thick volcaniclastic section, and core after core of (very interestin g looking) volcaniclastic sediments were recovered. Finally, at 417.6 mbsf, lava flows were encountered and cored to the bottom of the hole (498.8 mbsf) until time expired (Table T1).

# 2. Background  

The scientific background for Walvis Ridge hotspot drilling is given at length in the Expeditio n 391 Preliminary Report (Sager et al., 2022), so only an outline is given here. Walvis Ridge is a long, quasilinear ridge and seamount chain that stretches from the African margin to the active volcanoes of Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island (Figure F3). It is thought that Walvis Ridge volcanis m began around $132\;\mathrm{Ma}$ with eruption of the Etendeka flood basalt. Because of the apparent ag e progression, Walvis Ridge was an early candidate for a hotspot ridge caused by plate motion ove r stationary mantle plume (Morgan, 1971, 1981). It is one of only a handful considered to be a “primary” plume originating in the deep mantle (Courtillot et al., 2003). Early radiometric dates an d reconstructions indicated that Walvis Ridge began with the hotspot at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where it formed the larger Walvis Ridge edifices along with Rio Grande Rise, a conjugate larg e igneous province (LIP) on the South American plate (O’Connor and Duncan, 1990). Around 7 0 Ma, the hotspot and Mid-Atlantic Ridge separated, with the hotspot ending up beneath the African plate, where it formed the seamounts and ridges of the Walvis Ridge Guyot Province (O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b). Subsequent geochronology studie s have refined the age data to produce a tight linear trend of volcano age progression along Walvi s Ridge and the Guyot Province (Figure F4) (Rohde et al., 2013; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a; Homrighausen et al., 2019, 2020).  

Although the Walvis Ridge and its extension to the Guyot Province is the most prominent Atlanti c hotspot track, it nevertheless contains complications to the simple plume model. Starting at th e

MAR $=$ Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  

Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 74 transect, which is slightly north of the morphologic spli t between Walvis Ridge and the Guyot Province (Figures F2, F3), there are two distinct trails of Pbisotope signatures, one characterizing the seamount track that leads to Tristan da Cunha and th e other characteristic of the seamounts leading to Gough Island (Rohde et al., 2013; Hoernle et al., 2015). The ridge formed prior to the morphologic split (farther northeast) has the Gough Islan d isotopic signature (Hoernle et al., 2015). Thus, Walvis Ridge displays the oddity not only that i t splits from a single ridge to two or more but that the isotopic signature splits occur at roughly th e same time. Although isotopic zonation is observed in other hotspot seamount chains, the ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{Ma}$ split makes the Walvis Ridge Guyot Province one of the longest documented examples of suc h zonation (Hoernle et al., 2015). An explanation for the zonation is the tapping of two differen t zones of source material at the edge of the Atlantic large low shear-wave velocity provinc e (LLSVP) at the core mantle boundary (Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018). Unpublished isotopic data suggest that the Center track may constitute an additional isotopic zonatio n (Class et al., 2015) or it may be a result of mixing of Tristan and Gough signatures. If the former, i t may require rethinking of the zonation model.  

Another anomaly is the occurrence in Walvis Ridge of another linear age trend with a differen t isotopic signature and a gap of ${\sim}30{-}40\ \mathrm{Ma}$ after the older age trend (Homrighausen et al., 2019, 2020). This late stage volcanism is attributed to another source of buoyant plume material risin g from the top of the LLSVP (Homrighausen et al., 2019, 2020). Valdivia Bank represents a tectoni c anomaly. It is an oceanic plateau incorporated into Walvis Ridge and represents two sharp bend s in the chain because its trend is at high angle to the Walvis Ridge trend. Recent reconstruction o f Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise suggests that Valdivia Bank and Rio Grande Rise formed at th e Mid-Atlantic Ridge while it was undergoing a reorganization during the Late Cretaceous tha t formed a microplate (Sager et al., 2021). This tectonic event may have disturbed the age progression because the model implies that Valdiva Bank formed from east–west spreading rather than  a north–south hotspot age progression typical of most hotspot models (e.g., Doubrovine et al., 2012).  

Walvis Ridge has important implications for another geodynamic problem, the import of hotspot s as plate motion indicators. Hotspots were initially viewed as being fixed markers in the mantle, formed by deep plumes rising to the surface, which would allow plate motions to be determine d from hotspot seamount trends and age progressions (e.g., Morgan, 1971, 1981; Müller et al., 1993). As the longest and most continuous hotspot track in the Atlantic Ocean, Walvis Ridge has been  a foundation for hotspot models of African plate motion (Duncan, 1981). Nevertheless, hotspo t models for Walvis Ridge have trouble fitting its complex morphology (O’Connor and Le Roex,  

![](images/5454a7cab9798f9b8821f42b1be8510811d0b807091618d3633bce6c66bf497c.jpg)  
Figure F4. Walvis Ridge age progression from radiometrically dated igneous rocks. Samples with enriched mantle on e (EMI) composition follow a tight linear trend. Exceptions are samples with high $\upmu$ (HIMU)–type composition that yield age s \~30–40 My younger than the underlying basement with an EMI-type geochemical composition. Vertical blue bands represent Expedition 391 and 397T sites, denoting estimated ages (see Homrighausen et al., 2019, for sources of age data).  

1992; Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012). Additional age data and studies of Walvis Ridg e tectonic anomalies are required to sort out these problems. Walvis Ridge also has importan t potential to understand whether or how hotspots define a mantle reference frame and the behavior of that reference frame.  

DSDP and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) studies of the paleomagnetism of drill cores from th e Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain demonstrated that from about $80{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , the hotspot move d southward by ${\sim}10^{\circ}{-}15^{\circ}$ (Kono, 1980; Tarduno and Cottrell, 1997; Tarduno et al., 2003). An earl y explanation for this shift was that the Earth’s spin axis shifted away from the Pacific Ocean, a process termed “true polar wander” (TPW) (Gordon and Cape, 1981; Gordon, 1987). TPW has bee n documented on other planets and moons as well as at other times in Earth’s past (e.g., Gold, 1955; Goldriech and Toomre, 1969; Tsai and Stevenson, 2007; Torsvik et al., 2010; Creveling et al., 2012). But has it happened since the Late Cretaceous? Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 33 0 did a similar study of another Pacific hotspot, the Louisville Ridge, documenting less paleolatitud e change (Koppers et al., 2012). Other scientists questioned the fixity of hotspots for other reasons, and this led to the view that most hotspot paleolatitude changes have been caused by hotspo t motion attributed to mantle flow, rather than by TPW (e.g., Tarduno et al., 2009). Nevertheless, recent research suggests that TPW has occurred since the Late Cretaceous (Woodworth and Gordon, 2018; Zheng et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2019), so the implication is that TPW is combine d with hotspot motion during this time. Thus, additional studies of changes in hotspot paleolatitudes are needed. This was recognized by the 2007 Hotspot Geodynamics Detailed Plannin g Group, which recommended coring Walvis Ridge seamounts to determine paleolatitude for comparison with Pacific hotspots (Duncan et al., 2007). Moreover, paleolatitude inferred for Walvi s Ridge from combined continental paleomagnetic poles implies that the paleolatitude during earl y Cenozoic was $4^{\circ}{-}6^{\circ}$ farther south than at present, an anomaly that is not explained by hotspot drif t models but may be an indication of TPW that caused Pacific hotspots to move south while Atlantic hotspots moved north.  

# 3. Scientific objectives  

The main goal of Expedition 397T coring was to recover basalts and associated volcanic materia l for geochemical, isotopic, geochronology, paleomagnetic, and volcanologic study. Coring at tw o sites in the northern Walvis Ridge Guyot Province aimed to complete the three-hole transec t across the three seamount chains originally planned for Expedition 391 but left unfinished owin g to cuts in operations time. Specific objectives were as follows; most rely upon recovering fres h basalt samples:  

• Determine isotopic signatures of basalt flows to determine whether the Center track (Site U1578) represents a different composition or a mixture of Tristan and Gough lavas. Data will be used to understand the isotopic zonation.   
• Analyze geochemistry and isotope compositions to determine mantle source of magmas and degree of partial melt. Such information will help understand how mantle melting creates hotspot seamounts.   
• Create major and trace element chemistry and isotope stratigraphy for successions of lava flows to learn about changes in the source through the evolution of the seamount.   
• Determine multiple high-precision radiometric dates from lava successions to determine the age of the seamount and the span of eruptions recorded in the rock. Most seamounts have only one age because the sample comes from a dredge.   
• Create a geologic record of seamount volcanism to better understand the formation and evolution of Walvis Ridge guyots.   
• Collect samples from multiple basalt flows to measure for paleomagnetic inclination, which will be used to determine hotspot paleolatitude. Walvis Ridge paleolatitude will be compared with coeval Pacific hotspot paleolatitudes to see if there is a coherent shift (TPW).   
• Collect sediment samples to measure for paleomagnetic inclination to complement studies of basalt inclination.

# 4.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1584 was planned to sample a Gough track ridge to provide basalt samples that woul d anchor the Gough end of a geochemical transect across the Walvis Ridge Guyot Province (Figur e F2). The location was chosen to be slightly younger than the morphologic split in Walvis Ridge, which coincides with the development of different geochemical signatures for the different guyo t chains. The major objectives were to core basalt lava flows for major and trace element geochemistry and isotope geochemistry, obtain fresh basalt samples for geochronology, and recover multiple lava units for paleomagnetic inclination studies. Unfortunately, geology disappointed, an d coring quickly encountered indurated volcaniclastic deposits. Seismic data does not indicate  a limit to such deposits, and because there were no alternative sites (or enough time to addres s them), the science team elected to quit Site U1584 and save the unused operations time for th e next site.  

# 4.1.2. Operations  

Expedition 397T began on 10 September 2022, $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ $\left(\mathrm{UTC}+2\right)$ , with the ship tied up at Dunca n Dock E, Cape Town, South Africa. All oncoming Expedition 397T personnel, including 22 JOIDE S Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) staff and 8 scientists, moved onto the ship following a 4 da y hotel quarantine. The quarantine included a PCR and an antigen test according to the COVID-1 9 mitigation protocol. All personnel tested negative. Once onboard, all shipboard personne l received another COVID-19 PCR test, and all were negative. Port call activities continued, including the loading of $500~\mathrm{mt}$ of fuel and fresh food. COVID mitigation protocols continued to b e followed throughout port operations. One more JRSO staff member came on board before th e pilot boarded and the ship departed Cape Town on 12 September at $1018\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

At $0200\;\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September, the ship’s clock was set back $^{1\,\mathrm{h}}$ to $\mathrm{UTC}+1$ . We completed the 81 0 nmi voyage from Cape Town and arrived at Site U1584 (proposed Site GT-06A) at $0830~\mathrm{h}$ . Th e thrusters were deployed, and a drill string with a rotary core barrel (RCB) BHA and a C-4 corin g bit was assembled. At $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ , the top drive was engaged and a pig was deployed to clear potentia l rust and other obstructions from the drill pipe. We estimated the seafloor at 2313 meters below ri g floor (mbrf) based on the corrected precision depth recorder (PDR) signal. At $1800~\mathrm{h}$ , the firs t core barrel was dropped from 2310 mbrf, and the liner returned empty. The driller had observed  a tag at 2315.9 mbrf while lowering the core barrel. For the second attempt, the barrel was droppe d from 2315.9 mbrf. The liner returned empty again except for sediment residue smeared all alon g its length, indicating that the barrel had penetrated the formation but couldn’t hold the sediment. At $2005\,\mathrm{h}$ , we declared the seafloor depth at 2315.9 mbrf and deployed the core barrel. The barre l with the center bit had to be deployed twice because no indication of landing was detected the firs t time. We started to drill down without coring, reaching the target at 141.8 meters below seafloo r (mbsf) at $0515~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September. The wash barrel was retrieved, and the RCB core barrel wa s deployed. RCB coring proceeded from Core 397T-U1584A-3R through Core 9R (141.8–208. 2 mbsf), with core recovery ranging $0\%{-}95\%$ (average $=36\%$ ). The hole was swept with $30\ \mathrm{bbl}$ o f sepiolite mud after Cores 5R (170 mbsf) and 9R (208.2 mbsf).  

At $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September, we decided to terminate operations at Site U1584 because the seismi c basement reflector turned out to be the top of a potentially thick succession of volcaniclastic sediments rather than the desired basaltic lava flows. We retrieved the drill string from Hole U1584A, and the bit cleared the rig floor at $0605\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 September. The rig floor was secured, the thruster s were raised, and we departed Site U1584 at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

COVID-19 mitigation protocols continued to be followed with mask wearing, social distancin g and antigen testing of all personnel. Four individuals tested positive after boarding the ship on 11, 13 (2 people), and 15 September. They were quarantined until antigen tests on two successiv e days, starting on Day 5, were negative.  

# 4.1.3. Lithostratigraphy  

$\mathrm{A}>\!65\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession of sediments was drilled at Site U1584 (Figure F5). It comprises tw o main lithostratigraphic units, an upper chalky pelagic sediment passing into highly bioturbate d sandy silt with clay and foraminifera (Lithostratigraphic Unit I; 142.10–164.84 mbsf) and a lowe r volcaniclastic-dominated (pumiceous) succession composed of greenish to brown pumice lapill i and varying content of fragmentary lithic volcanic lapilli and blocks, together with infrequent layers of moderately well-sorted scoriaceous ash and small lapilli with rare individual bioclast s toward the base (Lithostratigraphic Unit II; 164.84–207.75 mbsf). No igneous basement wa s encountered, and the hole was ended at 207.75 mbsf. In Unit I, core recovery increases with sediment consolidation downhole, from ${\sim}3\%$ in the chalk (Subunit 1A) to $30\%{-}50\%$ in the silty sandstone (Subunits IB and IC). In Unit II, core recovery increases with degree of cementation, fro m ${\sim}25\%{-}40\%$ in the greenish yellow pumiceous lapillistone (Subunit IIA) to ${>}90\%$ in the olive brow n pumiceous lapillistone and volcanic breccia (Subunit IIB).  

Unit I consists of a ${\sim}23\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of bioturbated clayey-nannofossil chalk passing downhole into highly bioturbated, pale brown to reddish silty sand with varying amounts of carbonate, with minor volcaniclastic intercalations including a few coarser beds of vitric and lithic ash. Th e unit is highly bioturbated throughout, effectively erasing any original bedding or sedimentar y structures. Unit I was divided into three subunits based on significant compositional or colo r changes in the clayey-silty sand unit (i.e., rapid change from pale brown to reddish brown at th e base of a tephra band in Section 397T-U1584A-4R-CC, $16~\mathrm{{cm}}$ ) together with a change to a fine r more silt- and carbonate-rich composition.  

• Subunit IA (142.10–150.80 mbsf) recovered 5 to $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ long pieces and gravel-sized fragments of consolidated pale pinkish gray bioturbated clayey-nannofossil chalk $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ content $=$ ${\sim}40\%{-}60\%$ interpreted as a pelagic deposit. • Subunit IB (150.80–153.64 mbsf) is a succession of consolidated/lithified pale brown clayey bioturbated silty sand, potentially up to ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m}$ thick, with volcaniclastics and foraminifera (Ca$\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ content $=\sim\!25\%{-}30\%$ ). This subunit is interpreted as background pelagic carbonate sedimentation with siliciclastic, silt-sized intervals deposited by turbidity currents.  

![](images/4900fceee9558d4d99bf926c61d79b37b40fcba24c0fb2e63840a162d7e35d12.jpg)  
Figure F5. Lithostratigraphic synthesis, Site U1584.  

• Subunit IC (153.64–164.84 mbsf) consists of ${\sim}11\;\mathrm{m}$ of lithified reddish brown silty sandstone with foraminifera, volcaniclastic and clay components, and lower $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content $(\sim\!20\%)$ . The subunit is heavily bioturbated with infrequent layers of moderately well sorted medium sand and gravel and rare shell bioclasts. The relative amount of background pelagic sedimentation decreases relative to siliciclastic, silt- to sand-sized deposition, possibly from turbidity currents.  

Unit II consists of ${>}43\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, dominantly volcaniclastic succession of lapillistone containin g varying proportions of green to reddened (oxidized) pumice mixed with altered basaltic lithi c fragments (see Basaltic clast summary). The boundary between Units I and II is abrupt but no t preserved (Section 397T-U1584A-5R-4, $64\,\mathrm{cm}$ ). Two subunits are recognized in Unit II based on  a change in component proportions in the upper part of Core 5R and increasing downhole lithification by a mixture of interstitial altered ash and zeolite.  

• Subunit IIA (164.84–193.60 mbsf) is a ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ thick unstratified succession of green pumice lapilli fragments with a downward increasing component of basaltic lithic fragments and irregular-shaped blocks set in a matrix of fine-grained gray ash-like material, calcite and zeolite. Two crudely graded intervals from coarser lapilli with volcanic blocks to smaller pumice lapilli with infrequent lapilli-sized basaltic volcaniclasts can be recognized.   
• Subunit IIB (193.60–207.75 mbsf) is $\mathsf{a}>\!14\;\mathrm{m}$ thick lithified olive brown volcanic breccia consisting of unstratified oxidized pumiceous lapillistone and brown volcaniclastics with blocks in roughly equal proportions. The subunit is characterized by a downhole reduction in dominant clast size and a greater frequency of subrounded pumice lapilli with rare rounded, internally zoned lapilli; it has a greater bulk density than Subunit IIA (see Physical properties). Hole U1584A ended within this unit at 207.75 mbsf.  

Deposition of the succession indicates a change from a volcaniclastic-dominated succession i n which the main preserved eruptive products are highly vesicular pumice with basaltic lithic fragments and fine ash. Basaltic fragments include occasional cobble- or block-sized fragments. Th e degree of alteration and rounding of pumice clasts deceases upward, and observable crude layering may have been caused by eruptive pulsing. The later, overlying sediments are fine to mediu m clayey sands passing upward into lower energy (deeper water?) ash clayey silts with a concomitan t decrease in volcaniclastic component and finally into pelagic chalks with a minimal clastic component. These contain infrequent thin and dispersed ash (silt- and sand-sized) layers, most likel y turbidites.  

# 4.1.3.1. Basaltic clast summary  

In Unit II of Hole U1584A, basalt clasts range in diameter from $^{<1}$ to $6\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . These clasts show  a range in mineralogy and porphyritic and aphanitic textures. No volcanic glass was observed. Th e highly phyric clasts typically contain abundant olivine phenocrysts $(8\%{-}10\%)$ with some pyroxen e $(1\%{-}3\%)$ . All olivine is partly to completely altered to iddingsite, and the pyroxenes display varyin g degrees of alteration. Moderately and sparsely phyric basalt clasts have lower olivine abundance s $(0\%-7\%)$ with more plagioclase phenocrysts $(0\%-5\%)$ . Pyroxene is often present in low amount s $(0\%{-}2\%)$ . Aphyric clasts are also present only as a minor component. Texturally, olivine is found a s single crystals or small crystal clusters. Plagioclase phenocrysts range from blocky crystals t o elongate crystals with variable degrees of alteration to sericite. Pyroxene is present in thin, tabula r crystals with only minor visible alteration. Vesicle abundance varied widely, with some vesicle fre e clasts and others containing up to $30\%$ vesicles. Vesicles commonly contain alteration mineral s ranging from a thin zeolite lining to being completely filled with calcite.  

# 4.1.4. Biostratigraphy  

Expedition 397T did not have any biostratigraphers on board, and we therefore have no data o n the age of the sediments. Samples were taken for a micropaleontological assessment after th e expedition.  

# 4.1.5. Paleomagnetism  

Cores from Hole U1584A did not offer much potential for accomplishing paleomagnetic objectives for Expeditions 391 and 397T. No basaltic basement was cored, and the section of basal sediments that might produce reliable paleomagnetic data was short. Much of the section wa s volcaniclastic breccia, which is expected to be a poor magnetic recorder because the glassy matri x has low magnetization and basalt clasts are randomly oriented, so no coherent inclination recor d can be obtained. Superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) measurements were made on al l available material (Cores 397T-U1584A-4R, 5R, and 7R–9R; Core 6R was empty). These measurements found that the basal sediments in Cores 4R and 5R, which contain calcareous clay an d chalk, have moderate and coherent magnetization intensities, but deeper volcaniclastic cores hav e generally low intensities, interrupted by high intensity spikes from basalt clasts. Discrete sampl e measurements augment and reinforce this picture. The coherent magnetization in the calcareou s clay unit gives a consistent positive magnetic inclination that is interpreted as recording a reverse d magnetic polarity.  

# 4.1.6. Sediment geochemistry  

Sediment samples were analyzed to determine $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\,w t\%}$ , total carbon (TC), total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN). At Site U1584, seven samples were collected from Cores 397T-U1584A-3R through 5R. In Lithostratigraphic Subunit IA, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ conten t is moderate with a mean of $55.7\pm15.6\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . The mean $C a C O_{3}$ content then decreases to $23.7\pm3.7$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ and $22.4~\pm~10.3~\mathrm{{wt}\%}$ in Subunit IB and Subunit IC, respectively. TOC shows a genera l decrease from Subunit IA $(0.26\pm0.1\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ to Subunit IC $(0.07\pm0.1\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ . Therefore, TC content s are nearly identical (within error) to total inorganic carbon. Subunit IA has subtly higher TC (6. 5 $\pm\ 1.5\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) than Subunits IB and IC $(3.2\pm0.5\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ and $2.8\pm1.5\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively). TN contents ar e below the instrumental detection limits for all samples.  

Four representative basalt clasts $(4{-}6\;\mathrm{cm})$ found in volcaniclastic sediment from Site U1584 wer e analyzed for major and select trace element compositions using inductively coupled plasma– atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Three samples from Site U1584 are basalt, and one i s basalt trachyandesite; all four samples are alkaline. The basalt clasts from Site U1584 have a narrow range of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ $\mathrm{45.02{-}46.40\ w t\%)}$ , $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ $\left(2.05{-}2.54\;\mathrm{wt}\%\right)$ , and $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ $(1.46{-}1.73\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ but a wid e range of $\mathrm{MgO}$ $(2.23{-}9.50\,\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ . The clasts span a range of Mg# (22.8–62.4) and show decreases i n $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ , and $\scriptstyle\mathrm{Sr}$ and an increase in $\mathrm{Ni}$ with increasing $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ . Although compositionally heterogeneous, Site U1584 samples all have higher $\mathrm{K_{2}O,A l_{2}O_{3},N i,}$ and Sr than the samples from Expedition 391 sites.  

# 4.1.7. Physical properties  

Whole-round core logging included measurement of gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, pass-through magnetic susceptibility (MS), and natural gamma radiation (NGR). The wholeround section surfaces of igneous rocks and some breccias were also imaged in four quadrants. After splitting, the section halves were imaged and measured using the diffuse color spectrophotometer and a point-susceptibility meter. Discrete samples were measured for moisture and densit y (MAD) and $P$ -wave velocity.  

The results can be broken down into two categories based on how well they correlated with th e two main lithostratigraphic units: mud and sand–dominated lithified sediment in Unit I an d lapillistone in Unit II, with an increasing proportion of volcanic lithic fragments downhole. NGR, MS, point MS (MSP) and $P$ -wave velocity correlated with the lithostratigraphic units, showing distinct changes between the units. NGR, MS, and MSP values increase slightly downhole from Subunit IB to Subunit IC, where they reach their highest relative values. Continuing downhole fro m Subunit IC to Subunit IIA, values decrease significantly from ${\sim}25$ to 16 counts/s (NGR) and ${\sim}700$ to 50 SI (MS and MSP). From the top of Subunit IIA through Subunit IIB, NGR, MS and MS P remain relatively constant, with a gradual decrease in their values toward the bottom of the hole. $P_{-}$ -wave velocity behaves inversely to MS and NGR, increasing toward the bottom of Subunit II B (from ${\sim}1770$ to $3600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ ). Bulk density measurements (GRA and MAD) and porosity remain consistent through the lithologic boundary. Density measurements stay consistent from Subunit I B through Subunit IIA and sharply increase going into Subunit IIB (from ${\sim}1.77$ to $2.28~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ ). Porosity stays at its highest value from Subunit IB through Subunit IIA and decreases in Subuni t IIB from ${\sim}56\%$ to ${\sim}27\%$ .  

# 4.2. Site U1585  

# 4.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1585 was the second of two planned sites to sample the northern Walvis Ridge Guyot Province seamounts at locations slightly younger than that of the morphologic split, where the singl e ridge becomes two or three chains with different isotopic signatures. The site cores a Tristan trac k seamount that is part of a quasilinear chain of seamounts and ridges that stretch to the volcanicall y active Tristan da Cunha island group and have the same isotopic signature. The principal goal wa s to core basalt lava flows for major and trace element geochemistry and isotope geochemistry, obtain fresh basalt samples for geochronology, and recover multiple lava units for paleomagneti c inclination studies. Other important science objectives were to learn more about the volcanologi c formation and evolution of Walvis Ridge seamounts and to obtain sediments that complemen t prior studies of sedimentation in the region.  

# 4.2.2. Operations  

We completed the $111\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1584 to Site U1585 (proposed Site TT-04A) at  a speed of $11.4~\mathrm{kt}$ and arrived on 17 September 2022 at $1615\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+1\,h)}$ ). Dynamic positionin g mode was established, and we were ready for operations at $1650\,\mathrm{h}$ . A bit and bit sub were made u p to the RCB BHA, which was deployed to just above the seafloor based on the PDR signal. W e picked up the top drive, pumped the pig to clear the newly installed pipe from potential rust an d other obstructions, dropped the RCB, and began to spud Hole U1585A. The mudline was established by advancing the BHA until the driller noted a tag and the core barrel was recovered with  a muddy coating. At $0340\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September, we declared the seafloor depth at 3468.5 mbrf (3457. 3 meters below sea level [mbsl]). At $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ , a wash barrel was dropped, followed by a center bit, an d we drilled ahead to 144.1 mbsf. The wash barrel and center bit were retrieved at $1815\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{r}}$ , the cor e barrel was dropped, and coring began with Core 3R. The driller noted a hard tag at $250~\mathrm{mbsf},$ followed by a drilling break at 262 mbsf. This corresponded to the penetration of a massive basal t breccia layer. Hard rock drilling rates were encountered from Core 31R downward, correspondin g to the penetration of massive basalt. The last core, 39R, was retrieved the morning of 23 September, reaching a total penetration of 498.8 mbsf. In Hole U1585A, we recovered a total of $217.7\;\mathrm{m}$ o f sediment and rock for a total of $354.7\;\mathrm{m}$ interval cored, with recovery ranging $11\%{-}103\%$ (averag e $=61\%$ ).  

At $0615~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 September, having used the available drilling time, we began retrieving the dril l string, and the bit cleared the rig floor at $1555\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1585A. The drill floor was secured, the thrusters were raised, and the voyage to Lisbon, Portugal, began at $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ . The $4333\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit ended at $0950~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 October when the pilot boarded the vessel. Expedition 397T ended a t $1115\,\mathrm{h}$ when all lines were secured at the Rocha cruise terminal, Port of Lisbon, Portugal.  

COVID-19 mitigation protocols were followed with mask wearing, social distancing, and antige n testing of all personnel for the 6 days that started after the last recorded positive case on board wa s quarantined, as mandated by the COPE protocol. As of midnight on 21 September, daily COVI D testing ended and wearing of masks was no longer mandatory. On 24 September, the last of fou r infected personnel was released from quarantine.  

# 4.2.3. Lithostratigraphy  

A $274~\mathrm{m}$ thick succession consisting of a mixture of pelagic and detrital sediment and mixed fin e (argillaceous) to coarse (blocky) volcaniclastic materials lying on top of $81\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basemen t was drilled at Site U1585 (Figure F6). Igneous basement was encountered at $417.65\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and th e hole was ended at 498.8 mbsf. Five main lithostratigraphic units were recognized, four in the sediment section and one in the igneous section.  

Unit I (144.10–157.02 mbsf) is a ${\sim}13\;\mathrm{m}$ succession of bioturbated nannofossil chalk with foraminifera, faintly alternating in color from whitish to pale green, with chert horizons and containin g occasional thin ash intercalations.  

Unit II (157.02–249.20 mbsf) is a thick $(\sim\!92\mathrm{~m)}$ ) succession of massive and bedded pumice an d scoria lapillistone units showing a downhole increasing abundance of basaltic clasts, reworkin g and compaction. It is divided into two subunits (IIA and IIB) based on increasing reworking, clas t alteration, and tuffaceous chalk intercalations.  

• Subunit IIA (157.02–194.80 mbsf) is a massive, unsorted basaltic lapillistone of dominantly pale green pumice, scoria, and basaltic clasts.   
• Subunit IIB $\mathrm{(194.80{-}249.20\;m b s f)}$ is a continuation of Subunit IIA but displays an increasing degree of reworking and clast oxidation and chalk intercalations.  

Unit III (249.20–397.76 mbsf) is a thick $\left(\sim\!149\,\textrm{m}\right)$ , complex succession of alternating pink t o greenish gray tuffaceous chalk-rich to silty and sandy sediments containing multiple thin, grade d ash turbidites and tuffaceous ash; intercalated thick tuffaceous chalk intervals, occasionall y slumped; and several thick, coarse lapilli- and block-dominated volcaniclastic layers. It is divide d into eight subunits (IIIA–IIIH). Three of these (IIIA, IIID, and IIIG) are mainly basalt breccias.  

• Subunit IIIA (249.02–259.29 mbsf) is $\mathsf{a}>\!10\;\mathrm{m}$ thick unsorted, partially cemented basalt-dominated volcanic lapillistone breccia with basaltic ash.   
• Subunit IIIB (259.29–281.50 mbsf) is a uniform, $>\!22\,\mathrm{m}$ thick, highly bioturbated gray green to pinkish gray tuffaceous chalk and silty clay with some graded pumice and ash layers.   
• Subunit IIIC (281.5–294.48 mbsf) is a ${\sim}13\;\mathrm{m}$ thick bioturbated sequence of alternating dark gray to greenish gray tuffaceous, chalky claystone displaying downhole disturbance including inclined bedding, rounded chalk clasts, and brittle fracturing.   
• Subunit IIID (294.48–298.67mbsf) is a ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{m}$ thick basalt-dominated volcanic lapillistone breccia consisting of densely packed scoria and basalt with a mixture of tuffaceous chalk pebbles and isolated basaltic blocks toward its base.   
• Subunit IIIE $(298.6–331.76\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ is a ${\sim}33\;\mathrm{m}$ thick complex succession of bioturbated tuffaceous chalk displaying pale gray to pinkish brown color alternations and infrequent tuff or ash layers, some preserving plagioclase crystals and bioclasts. Its base contains chaotic intervals displaying soft-sediment deformation with rip-up clasts, indicative of submarine slumping.   
• Subunit IIIF (331.76–367.07 mbsf) is a $>\!35\;\mathrm{m}$ succession of carbonate-rich silty clay with a downhole increase in grain size to a highly bioturbated, dark reddish brown to dark greenishgray silty sand. The frequency of crystal-rich ash and shell debris layers increases downhole, indicative of shallower water.   
• Subunit IIIG $\langle367.07{-}374.10\ \mathrm{mbsf}\rangle$ is a ${>}7\;\mathrm{m}$ thick polymict lapilli-sized volcanic breccia passing downward into blocky breccia with minor reworking. It contains zoned (accretionary?) lapilli and basalt fragments with glassy/palagonitized (tachylitic) rims. These juvenile pyroclasts indicate proximity to a volcanic source.   
• Subunit IIIH (374.10–397.76 mbsf) is $>\!24\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession. The uppermost interval is a bioturbated dark greenish gray to dark reddish brown tuffaceous, carbonate-rich silty clay with numerous ${\sim}2{-}5\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick tuff or ash layers. The lower half of the unit contains thicker $(\sim\!5\mathrm{-}10$ cm) polymict conglomeratic graded intervals containing tuffaceous chalk pebbles, fine shell debris, and lapillistone with some block-sized clasts. Lapillistone contains a palagonitized quenched/glassy basaltic fragments, an admixture of juvenile pyroclastic fall-out.

Figure F6. Lithostratigraphic synthesis, Site U1585.  

Unit IV (397.76–417.60 mbsf) is a thick $\langle{\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}\rangle$ deposit of volcanic breccia consisting of a stacke d succession of basaltic block, bomb, and accretionary lapilli. An abundance of glassy shards an d tachylitic rims on angular basaltic fragments, together with marine bioclasts and recrystallize d foraminifera in the cement, indicates juvenile and reworked volcaniclastic components and a complex explosive eruptive–sedimentary environment. It is not divided into subunits.  

In chronological order, the cored succession begins with an igneous basement consisting o f unusually thick uniform basaltic units (Unit V). This is overlain by a varied succession combinin g initially juvenile volcaniclastic material (Unit IV) and subsequent sedimentary lithofacies involving reworked volcaniclastics eventually passing into deep marine chalk-dominated sedimentar y units (Units I–III). The lowermost basalt flow and primary volcanic deposits represent the en d stages of the constructive phase of the evolution of the volcanic edifice. Following this effusiveexplosive phase is a period of deepening marine environment and the onset of drowning of the sit e (Unit III). Repeated influxes of coarse volcanic debris indicate a nearby offshore, shallow source i n which accumulated clastic detritus periodically slumped into deeper water. Long periods of deepwater pelagic accumulation are represented by the preservation of alternating redox condition s within tuffaceous and increasingly purer nannofossil chalk sediments (Subunits IIIB and IIIE). Tuffaceous carbonates eventually give way to more homogeneous carbonate ooze (chalk). Th e thick pumice and scoria rich layers of Unit II represent a much later and entirely separate phase o f volcanism. The length of hiatus between this later eruptive phase and the emplacement of the earlier lava units remains to be determined.  

# 4.2.4. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Site U1585 penetrated $81.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement (interval 397T-U1585A-31R-5, $75\;\mathrm{cm}$ , to 39R6, $43\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ ) with $70.2~\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(86\%)$ (Figure F7). The igneous basement at Site U1585 is designated Lithostratigraphic Unit V, and Hole U1585A terminates within a massive lava flow with  a minimum flow thickness of $43.3\;\mathrm{m}$ . Three igneous units were identified at Site U1585. Unit 1 an d Unit 3 consist of massive lava flows, and each have two subunits distinguished by distinct textura l and mineralogical changes. Unit 2 is an igneous unit that consists of a mineralogically and texturally distinct piece of quenched lava potentially related to a pillow sequence with very low recovery.  

Igneous Unit 1 is a sparsely to highly olivine-clinopyroxene $\pm$ plagioclase phyric massive basal t (interval 397T-U1585A-31R-5, $75~\mathrm{cm}$ , to 34R-1, $0\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ ; 417.60–441.2 mbsf). Textural and mineralogical changes suggest that this unit likely consists of, at minimum, two basalt flows, each wit h distinctive mineralogy. The topmost flow (Subunit 1a) is a $4.47\,\textrm{m}$ thick (417.60–422.07 mbsf ) massive flow. Subunit 1b is a $19.1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick $(422.07{-}441.20~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) massive flow that is more fractionated (moderately clinopyroxene $\pm$ plagioclase phyric) basalt with noticeably coarser groundmass crystals than Subunit 1a.  

Igneous Unit 2 consists of a $3~\mathrm{cm}$ (441.20–441.23 mbsf) piece of quenched basalt with olivin e phenocrysts in a microcrystalline groundmass. Because unrecovered intervals are defined by th e end of a core, the thickness of Unit 2 is underrepresented and the thickness for Subunit 3A is overrepresented.  

Igneous Unit 3 consists of two massive lava flows without any clear flow boundary features. However, changes in texture, mineralogy, and geochemistry suggest that two flows with separate fractionation histories may be present. The first flow is identified as Subunit 3a. It is $10.3\textbf{m}$ thic k (441.23–451.26 mbsf) and consists of a highly clinopyroxene-plagioclase phyric massive basal t flow with a fine-grained groundmass. Subunit 3b is a thick ( $>\!43.7\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; 451.26–495.0 mbsf), relatively featureless massive basalt flow that is moderately to highly pyroxene-plagioclase $\pm$ olivin e phyric.  

Broadly, two stages of alteration can be identified intermittently throughout the igneous units: (1) a higher temperature alteration chlorite-sericite-zeolite facies and (2) a subsequent, lower temperature Fe oxyhydroxide alteration. The higher temperature alteration was more pervasive an d resulted in pyrite, calcite, chlorite, and zeolite filling vesicles, veins, and fractures. The intensity o f this alteration was moderate through Unit 1 and Subunit 3a but decreased in intensity toward th e bottom of Subunit 3b. The low-temperature, more oxidizing episode of alteration is patchy an d often seen localized around fractures, which provided fluid pathways. The more oxidizing alteration episode happened secondarily and often removed vesicle and vein filling. It is observe d mostly in Unit 1.  

# 4.2.5. Paleomagnetism  

Almost all core sections were measured with the SRM, producing 52,829 measurements. Additionally, 125 discrete samples were treated to detailed demagnetization. Magnetization intensit y within the sedimentary section displayed an extreme range $\left(3.0\times10^{-5}\right.$ to $7.3\:\mathrm{A/m}\mathrm{)}$ ) because of th e variation from weakly magnetic carbonate sediments to basalt breccia (Figure F8). Magnetizatio n intensity of basalt flow cores ranged $0.45{-}15.26\ \mathrm{A/m}$ , which is normal for relatively unaltere d basalt (Figure F9). Although a few of the upper breccia units (Subunits IIB and IIIA) gave scattere d paleomagnetic inclination data, most cores produced consistent results. Cores 397T-U1585A-18 R through the basalt section to the bottom of the hole yielded positive inclinations, implyin g reversed magnetic polarity. The calcareous sediments at the top of the cored interval, Cores 3 R and 4R (Unit I), are also reversed. In between there is at least one but perhaps two normal polarit y zones, depending on confirmation of an intervening reversed interval. Cores 13R and 14R and th e top of Core 15R gave scattered inclination data, but detailed demagnetization of two discrete samples indicates reversed polarity. This polarity zone requires confirmation with later study. If confirmed, it divides normal polarity zones observed in Cores 9R–12R and 15R to the top of Core 18R. If not, there is probably only one normal polarity interval. The occurrence of a magnetic reversa l in the latter core provides a potential opportunity for dating that can help calibrate the magneti c reversal time scale. Isothermal remanent magnetization studies show that the magnetization carriers in the sediments are mostly titanomagnetite, but they have varying amounts of high coercivity mineral, likely hematite. These experiments also show that the magnetizations of some massiv e flows are soft and may be carried by large, multidomain grains.

# 4.2.6. Sedimentary geochemistry  

A total of 119 sediment samples from Lithostratigraphic Units I–III were analyzed to determin e the $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\,w t\%}$ , total carbon (TC), total inorganic carbon, total organic carbon (TOC), and tota l nitrogen (TN). In Unit I, $C a C O_{3}$ content is high with a mean of $77\pm\,9.7\,\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ . The mean $C a C O_{3}$ content is more moderate in Subunits IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IIIE, ranging $40\pm9.1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ to $62.9\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ (numbers with $\pm$ values are averages with standard deviation; those without are single measurements). Subunits IIA, IIIF, and IIIH all have low $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ ranging $26{-}31\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC content is lo w across all lithologic units $(<\!0.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ and shows no consistent trend between units. Therefore, T C contents are nearly identical (within error) to total inorganic carbon and do not show a clear pattern with depth. Likewise, given the complexity of each lithostratigraphic unit, it is difficult t o draw clear connections between TC and lithostratigraphic units. Subunit IA and IIA have relatively higher TC (7.9 and $9.3\pm1.3\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively) than other units. TC is moderate in Subunit s IIB, IIIB, IIIC, IIIE, and IIIH $(4.0{-}6.6\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ and low in Subunits IIA, IIID, and IIIF $(2.8{-}3.1\;\mathrm{wt\%})$ . TN contents are below the instrumental detection limits for all samples.

# 4.2.7. Igneous geochemistry  

At Site U1585, 16 samples were analyzed for major and trace elements via ICP-AES from the tw o igneous units comprised of massive flows. Additionally, 13 samples from large basalt clasts withi n various volcaniclastic lithostratigraphic units above the igneous basement were also analyzed. Th e majority of Site U1585 basalt clasts and lava flows lie within the basalt compositional field. However, five lava flows and three clasts are compositionally trachybasalts, and one basalt clast is  a basaltic trachyandesite. Apart from three transitional basalt clasts, all Site U1585 samples are alkaline. Calculated Ti/V ratios demonstrate that the basalt lava flows have higher Ti/V ratios tha n most of the basalt clasts. The lower Ti/V ratios are consistent with lavas from Expedition 391 Site s U1575–U1577 and overlap with values from MORB and the transition to oceanic island basal t (OIB). The higher Ti/V ratios associated with the basalt lava flows fall between the values fro m Sites U1575–U1577 and Site U1578. They also lie completely in the OIB field.  

The basalt clasts from Site U1585 show a wide range of $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ (32.5–64.6), similar to basalt clast s from Site U1584. However, unlike clasts from Site U1584, the more numerous basalt clasts in Sit e U1585 also show a wider range of other elemental abundances (e.g., $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}=45{-}52\,\mathrm{wt}\%_{2}$ ; $\mathrm{CaO}=5.0-$ $16.6\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ; $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}=0.9–2.8\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ . The scatter in $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ may be due to seawater alteration. In contrast , the basalt lava flows show a range of compositions forming clear trends generated by fractiona l crystallization. The basalt lava flows show increasing $\mathrm{SiO}_{2},$ $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ CaO, $\mathrm{K_{2}O}_{\cdot}$ , $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ , Zr, V, and $\scriptstyle\mathrm{Sr}$ with decreasing $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ . The strong positive correlation between $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ and Ni are indicative of modest olivine accumulation in the most $\mathrm{MgO}$ -rich samples (up to $18.3\;\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{MgO}$ and $565~\mathrm{ppm~Ni}$ ). Overall, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ contents are modest for both basalt clasts and basalt lava flows; none are as $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ - rich as Site U1578 lavas. However, the $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content of the basalt clasts are lower than those of th e basalt lava flows with similar $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ . The relational offset is also observed in $Z\mathbf{r}$ and Sr. This compositional difference between the younger basalt clasts and the older basalt lava flows may be due t o a change in magmatic source.

# 4.2.8. Physical properties  

In Hole U1585A, three primary sedimentary units were identified and defined by changes in sedimentary successions and major shifts in physical property behavior. Three units were also identified within the igneous basement, but those units had minor changes in physical properties an d were mainly distinguished using changes in petrography and geochemistry.  

The physical properties data can be broken down into two categories: (1) properties that mar k major lithostratigraphic boundaries by displaying distinct changes from the previous unit an d (2) properties that display intraunit variation and small-scale variations (e.g., within a single core). Bulk density measurements based on GRA and MAD analysis and $P.$ -wave velocity fall within th e first category and were best suited to identify major lithostratigraphic boundaries. Bulk densit y and $P$ -wave velocity are nearly homogeneous in Units I–III, excluding the basalt breccia units i n Unit III (Subunits IIIA, IIID, and IIIG), where $P$ -wave velocity displays higher peaks. The tw o properties were more variable in Unit IV due to the amount of basaltic blocks within the as h cemented lapillistone but stabilized and steadily increased into the igneous basement to the bottom of the hole. MS, MSP, NGR, and porosity have more interunit variation when compared t o density and $P$ -wave velocity. They display systematic changes within a single core. Core-sectio n (meter-scale) variations are present, but careful processing of the data is needed to remove outlier s introduced by gaps between sections and pieces. In general, both MS and NGR steadily increas e from the top of the hole within the chalky Unit I to the base of breccia Unit IV, and both displa y intraunit variations on meter and core length scale that fluctuate between different sediment successions. NGR decreases a small amount in the highly pyroxene-olivine phyric basalt of Subuni t 3b. Porosity was measured only in Units I–III and varies between 40 and $60\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ across lithologi c units and within single cores.  

# 5. Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 397T was designed to address the loss of two holes during Expedition 391. Two majo r objectives of Expedition 391 were (1) to core a transect in the northern Guyot Province to recove r basalt lava flows from one volcano each of the Tristan, Center, and Gough tracks to better understand the geochemical and isotopic split discovered at the DSDP Leg 74 transect farther north an d (2) to use paleomagnetic measurements from these flows to determine a precise paleolatitude. Additional objectives were to obtain precise radiometric dates and to better understand the volcanologic evolution of Guyot Province seamounts.  

Expedition 391 cored Hole U1578A deep into volcanic basement, producing a set of cores that wa s close to ideal. The ${\sim}300~\mathrm{m}$ section spanned a long time period, with lava flows interspersed wit h numerous pelagic and volcaniclastic intervals. Moreover, the flows rendered many glassy margin s (excellent for geochemistry and isotopic chemistry) and included interesting changes in geochemistry and fresh intervals rich in olivine (a mineral critical to some geochemical studies). In a sport s analogy, Hole U1578A was a home run. Given that the original pre-Expedition 391 operationa l time estimates for drilling at proposed Sites GT-4A and TT-4A was a total of 9.3 days, having onl y 7 days of drilling time allotted for Expedition 397T suggests that it is unfair to compare the result s of Sites U1584 and U1585 with those of Hole U1578A. It was always likely that operational o r geological problems would cut into that time, meaning less scientific output. Overall, Expeditio n 397T came up a little short on one hole, U1584A, but did well on another, U1585A, even if th e latter was significantly different from U1578A. On the whole, Expedition 397T did indeed provid e useful samples that will help achieve the goals of Walvis Ridge Hotspot drilling.  

# 5.1. Hole U1584A  

Hole U1584A on the Gough track guyot recovered only a short interval of calcareous sediment s overlying three cores of volcaniclastics containing generally small basalt clasts. Because of it s inauspicious beginning, drilling in Hole U1584A was terminated early to save the time for drillin g elsewhere. The character of volcanic basement at all locations on the site survey seismic lines wa s the same (smooth), so there was no better place to core on the Gough track guyot.  

Because the basalt clasts are small and encased in porous volcaniclastics, the clasts are altered t o varying degrees. This limits their utility for geochemical, isotopic, and geochronology study. Expedition 397T scientists are hopeful that useful geochemical data can be produced and that at leas t one reliable radiometric age can be determined. The time span is likely to be limited, and becaus e the material was produced by explosive eruption(s) at the end of the guyot’s formation, the material may not represent the original edifice construction (i.e., it may be a late-stage eruption). Nevertheless, any information about the geochemical signature and timing of the volcanic eruptio n will be useful for understanding the formation of Walvis Ridge and its guyots. Because the basal t clasts are jumbled in their volcaniclastic setting, they are useless for paleolatitude study.  

# 5.2. Hole U1585A  

Hole U1585A encountered a volcanic section consisting of ${\sim}274\;\mathrm{m}$ of volcaniclastic material overlying ${\sim}81\mathrm{~m~}$ of basalt in the form of thick, massive flows. The basalt section was disappointin g because it probably spans a limited time, is relatively homogeneous, contains little glass, and i s moderately altered. These conditions mean that it may not serve for some geochemical studie s and may have limited variability and time span to average paleomagnetic secular variation or provide a record of time changes in the magma source. Nevertheless, there is abundant material tha t is likely to give some important geochemical data and a reliable radiometric date. Some parts o f the flows contain fresh olivine, but the crystals are small, so geochemists will have some difficult y separating them out. The sediment section above the basalt is highly varied and contains interval s of abundant volcanic clasts and occasional glass. Moreover, it clearly spans a significant time interval. Thus, there is potential for producing interesting geochemical data as well as radiometri c dates. In other words, the section is not as ideal as that from Site U1578, but it has some potentia l to produce important results.  

From a volcanologic perspective, the recovered sections are quite interesting. The volcaniclasti c cores contain a record of material shed from the volcanic high, potentially spanning a significan t period of the late stages of volcano construction. The cores suggest that the deeper, older sectio n was deposited in shallow water, but that the higher, younger parts were deposited in deeper water. This transition implies emplacement over a long time interval as the volcano subsided beneath th e sea surface. Several magnetic reversals were captured in the sedimentary section, providing mor e evidence of significant time passage. The basalt flow section is also interesting, even though likel y limited in age range. Encountering thick, massive flows on the lower flanks of the seamount wa s unexpected. Seamount volcanism is typically characterized by low-effusion pillow lavas. Als o unexpected were some internal geochemical and paleomagnetic variations within the flows tha t suggest later intrusion(s) and magma evolution. Thus, Hole U1585A may provide important dat a for understanding seamount volcanism in general and Walvis Ridge guyot volcanism in particular.  

It is unclear how useful the Hole U1585A cores will be for paleolatitude studies. The hope was t o core multiple lava flows, which would provide multiple samples of the paleomagnetic field ove r enough time to average paleosecular variation. Paleomagnetists consider lava flows to be a bette r magnetic recorder than most sediments. The cored basalt section probably spans a limited tim e interval, so it will not provide the desired result. It may be possible to obtain one or a few estimate s of paleomagnetic inclination that can be combined with data from Hole U1578A. In contrast, th e sediment section may provide useful data, but it displays complex lithologic changes that wil l require a significant effort to understand the magnetic minerals and their ability to record the geomagnetic field. Nevertheless, shipboard results suggest that two to three magnetic polarity zone s were sampled, so there is a significant time span. Because some paleomagnetists distrust sedimen t samples for paleolatitude study, the trick will be to produce data that are convincingly reliable.  

# 5.3. Why did we not core the expected geology?  

One may wonder why coring encountered volcaniclastics at both sites instead of the desire d basalt. One part of the answer is that they may be hard to tell apart, but the rest of the answer i s underinvestment in site survey seismic data. At both sites acoustic basement, the deepest stron g reflector beneath which little is seen, had the expected characteristic. Beneath sediments with onl y weak internal reflections, basement was a strong reflector and few coherent reflections occurre d below. One may expect lava flows to create strong, undulating reflectors with diffractions an d poor lateral continuity owing to the rough nature of lava flow surfaces. In the case of Site U1584, basement appears smooth, but it is on the flank of a volcano where significant volcaniclastic accumulation would not be expected. In addition, this character was seen on all of the few seismic line s over the target Gough track guyot. In hindsight, it appears that this volcano produced significan t explosive eruptions covering its flanks with volcaniclastics. In a world where funds for geophysica l data acquisition are less limited, perhaps other seismic profiles over nearby seamounts could hav e been acquired, giving an option without volcaniclastic cover.  

Site U1585 appeared to be a better bet because the site is on the lower flank, away from summi t eruptions, and the acoustic basement is strong and undulating, as would be expected. Site U157 8 was in a similar location on a Center track guyot lower flank. It was poor luck that Site U1585 wa s covered with ${\sim}274\mathrm{~m~}$ of volcaniclastic-rich sediments and the lava flows were massive. The dril l bit was in good shape and the hole gave no problems, so had we had more time, we could hav e drilled more deeply, perhaps below the massive flows. We simply ran out of time to go deeper.  

# 6. Connections to the 2050 Science Framework  

Originally submitted during 2007, the Walvis Ridge hotspot drilling proposal was developed fro m the recommendations of the 2007 Hotspot Geodynamics Detailed Planning group (Duncan et al., 2007). This advisory group recommended drilling several hotspot seamount chains to leverag e then new results from the Hawaiian-Emperor chain drilling. The proposal matured under th e guidance of the IODP Science Plan 2013–2023 (Bickle et al., 2013) and mainly addresses the them e “Earth Connections: Deep processes and their impact on Earth’s surface environment” becaus e the project cored volcanic hotspot seamounts to understand the sources of hotspot magmas an d their evolution with time. In particular, the project addressed “Challenge 8: What are the composition, structure, and dynamics of Earth’s upper mantle?” and “Challenge 9: How are seafloo r spreading and mantle melting linked to ocean crustal architecture?” Moreover, because Expeditions 391 and 397T sought to better understand the processes of submarine volcanism, both expeditions also addressed volcanic geohazards, and thus the theme “Earth in Motion: Processes an d hazards on human time scales.” More specifically, such knowledge fits “Challenge 12: What mechanisms control the occurrence of destructive earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis.”  

Now under the guidance of its third planning document, SOD2050 (Koppers and Coggin, 2020 ) knowledge produced by Expeditions 397T and 391 address the strategic objectives “The Oceani c lifecycle of tectonic plates” and “Feedbacks in the Earth system” because hotspot volcanism augments oceanic plates and modifies their behavior and evolution. In addition, the flux of melts fro m the upper mantle to the plates affects the surface and surface environments. Expeditions 391 an d 397T also address the Flagship Initiative “Probing the deep Earth” because geochemistry o f hotspot magmas can give clues about mantle plume source regions in the deep mantle. Moreover, studies of paleolatitude from paleomagnetic data gives clues about the evolution of mantle heterogeneities and their geodynamic effects on spin axis stability or mobility.  

# 7. Education and outreach  

Expedition 397T had one Education and Outreach (E&O) Officer onboard. The officer communicated the objectives and science of the expedition to students and the general public across th e world through live ship-to-shore broadcasts, social media, videos, blogs, and university news outlets. The officer also developed curriculum and educational materials for students in middle an d high school.  

Outreach activities were scaled back during the expedition for several reasons, the most significant of which was that the E&O officer tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and had to isolat e in her cabin for 10 full days. Her isolation continued throughout the full extent of Expedition 397 T coring operations. Additionally, the IODP internet connection was prohibitively slow or nonexistent for several days during transit.  

Despite these setbacks, outreach activities were carried out from 6 September to 12 October 2022.   
Though the scope was limited, overall objectives were met.  

# 7.1. Live broadcasts  

The E&O officer hosted live ship-to-shore video broadcasts to interact with formal and informa l groups all over the world. These events introduced students and members of the general public t o the goals, methods, and scientific findings of Expedition 397T. Audiences included students, teachers, conference attendees, and visitors to the JOIDES Resolution traveling museum exhibit.  

The typical broadcast began with an introduction to IODP, JOIDES Resolution, and Expedition s 391 and 397T. The scientific context and objectives of the expeditions were translated into languages appropriate for each specific audience. Participants then received a tour of the ship tha t included the life boats, bridge, derrick, rig floor, catwalk, and laboratories. Viewers learned abou t the core flow process from scientists in each laboratory, as well as how physical properties analyses, core description, paleomagnetism, biostratigraphy, and geochemistry contribute to th e research and goals of the expedition. Tours ended with extensive question and answer session s with scientists and technicians.  

Over the course of the expedition, the E&O officer facilitated 17 broadcasts to different institutions, including primary and secondary schools, universities, conferences, and informal publi c groups. Student audiences ranged from fourth grade to graduate university level. Broadcast s reached over 530 people across four continents in Australia, England, India, Ireland, and th e United States of America. USA broadcasts reached seven states: Alaska, California, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania. Several broadcasts were recorded by teachers fo r future use.  

Participants were provided with educational materials and useful links from https://joidesresolution.org as well as custom-made Expedition 397T resources prior to their scheduled event. The y were also asked to complete a follow-up survey after the broadcast.  

Scheduling broadcasts was a challenge because two Expedition 397T scientists committed t o teaching their classes remotely while at sea. This blocked out $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ a week of time that could hav e been used for broadcasts. Six broadcasts had to be canceled due to the quarantining of the E& O officer. One broadcast was rescheduled for the same reason. An additional broadcast had to b e rescheduled due to a poor internet connection, and another broadcast was forced to end early. Th e broadcasts that did take place were wholly successful, with positive feedback from event organizers. Below are some responses from teachers:  

• “Thanks again for an excellent tour! Everyone enjoyed it so much.”   
• “We certainly appreciate your time yesterday. Most of us have followed JOIDES on Instagram and/or Facebook following the Zoom session. You won my students’ hearts when you told them they were the nicest kids you had conferenced with!”   
• “Thank you. Our students loved the presentation and the sunrise picture. I made it my desktop background, so the students see it a lot.”   
• “It was a memorable learning experience for all of us at Dept of Earth Sciences, Pondicherry University to participate in the live interaction meeting with you and your team onboard JR. We are grateful to you for this wonderful opportunity. “   
• “That was lovely thank you! I just want to share with you some things I heard during the field trip. ‘I had a purpose to come to school today.’ ‘Some people are just so smart!’ ‘It looks like the lab from Jurassic Park!’ ‘They are just soo smart!’”   
• “Thank you so very much for your videochat yesterday! You are an excellent educator!”   
• “This is the best workshop I have ever attended.”  

# 7.2. Expedition activities  

While at sea, the priority for E&O was to learn more about the science of Expedition 397T, as wel l as the people involved in the expedition, so as to be able to create representative educational materials at the end of the expedition. This included shadowing scientists, technicians, and crew members;  conducting  interviews;  participating  in  scientific  meetings  and  discussions;  an d documenting science and daily life using photographs and videos.  

A total of 10 blog posts were written for the JOIDES Resolution web page: seven by the E&O officer, one by scientist Dr. Rajneesh Bhutani, one by Toolpusher Glenn Barrett, and one by IOD P Manager of Science Operations Dr. Katerina Petronotis. These blogs covered topics including th e scientific objectives and methods of the expedition, life at sea, and how the expedition wa s affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. When compared to the previous 30 days, website pageview s were up $1\%$ and average session duration increased by $36\%$ .  

Two interviews were conducted to support the JOIDES Resolution StoryCorps group outreac h project, spearheaded by IODP Expedition 390 Education and Outreach Officer Dr. Laura Guertin.  

# 7.3. Social media  

The E&O officer maintained four websites during the expedition: Twitter (at least two posts a day), Facebook (at least one post per day), Instagram (at least one post per day), and the JOIDES Resolution Expedition 397T webpage (at least two blog posts per week). From September 6 to Octobe r 12, over 80 posts were made to Twitter, resulting in over 180,100 impressions, 2,300 likes, 60 0 retweets, and 100 replies (Table T2). Twitter impressions increased by $324\%$ during the expeditio n compared to the previous 30 days. The Twitter account gained 113 new followers. More than 5 0 posts were made to Facebook, reaching over 14,500 people and resulting in over 7,000 engagements. Facebook reach increased by $46\%$ during the expedition compared to the previous 30 days. The Facebook account gained 30 new followers. Over 60 posts were made to Instagram, reachin g over 4,300 people and garnering over 7,000 engagements. Instagram reach increased by $80\%$ during the expedition compared to the previous 60 days. The Instagram account gained 56 ne w followers.  

# 7.4. Educational materials  

To provide enduring access to Expedition 391 and 397T science, the E&O officer is developing  a series of digital resources to be used in formal and informal educational settings. The goal of thes e materials is not only to immerse students in the science of the joint expeditions but also to mak e science accessible for students historically underrepresented in the field. These resources includ e a video compiled of several interviews with a diverse group of scientists discussing their paths t o success in the field, lessons to help students develop fundamental science skills, and inquiry-base d investigations to engage students in an authentic process of science. The lessons will be fully digital, which will allow teachers to modify them as necessary to fit their students’ needs, and will b e appropriate for the postpandemic classroom.
