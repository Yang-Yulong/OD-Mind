# Abstract  

Paleoclimate and paleoceanographic studies present opportunities to study the dynamics of the climate system by examining how it responds to external forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas and solar radiation changes) and how its interacting components generate climate oscillations and abrupt changes. Of note is the amplified recent warming of the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, which is presumably related to sea ice albedo feedback and teleconnections to other regions; both the behavior of sea ice–climate interactions and the role of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation in climate change can be studied with geologic records of past climate change in the Bering Sea.  

Over the last $5\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ , global climate has evolved from being warm with only small Northern Hemisphere glaciers to being cold with major Northern Hemisphere glaciations every 100–40 k.y. The ultimate reasons for this major transition are unknown. Over the last hundreds of thousands of years, Milankovitch- and millennial-scale climate oscillations have occurred. Although the regional environmental changes reflected in the sediment are known in some regions, the mechanisms by which they propagate globally are not understood. Possible mechanisms responsible for both the long-term evolution of global climate as well as the generation of high-frequency climate oscillations involve processes such as intermediate water ventilation and sea ice formation in the North Pacific. However, the paucity of data in critical regions of the Pacific such as the Bering Sea has prevented an evaluation of the role of North Pacific processes in global climate change. Because North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) has the potential to be influenced by dense water forming in the Bering Sea and because of the potential far-field impacts of sea ice, the Bering Sea may be critically involved in causing major climate changes. Thus, drilling in the Bering Sea may help answer questions not only about the global extent of climate trends and oscillations but about the mechanisms that produce them.  

In addition to having important sedimentary records of past climate change, the Bering Sea is also a region of relatively high surface productivity, elevated intermediate and deepwater nutrient concentrations, and, presumably, microbial-mediated biogeochemical cycling. Thus, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 323 was also dedicated to examining subseafloor biomass and microbial processes in highproductivity regions for the first time.  

The major objectives of Expedition 323 in the Bering Sea are  

1. To elucidate a detailed evolutionary history of climate and surface ocean conditions since the earliest Pliocene in the Bering Sea, where amplified high-resolution changes of climatic signals are recorded;   
2. To shed light on temporal changes in the origin and intensity of NPIW and possibly deeper water mass formation in the Bering Sea;   
3. To characterize the history of continental glaciation, river discharges, and sea ice formation in order to investigate the link between continental and oceanic conditions of the Bering Sea and adjacent land areas;   
4. To investigate linkages through comparison to pelagic records between ocean/ climate processes that occur in the more sensitive marginal sea environment and processes that occur in the North Pacific and/or globally. This objective includes an evaluation of how the ocean/climate history of the Bering Strait gateway region may have affected North Pacific and global conditions; and   
5. To constrain global models of subseafloor biomass and microbial respiration by quantifying subseafloor cell abundance and pore water chemistry in an extremely high productivity region of the ocean. We also aim to determine how subseafloor community composition is influenced by high productivity in the overlying water column.  

During Expedition 323 in the Bering Sea, $5741\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment $(97.4\%$ recovery) was drilled at seven sites covering three different areas: Umnak Plateau, proximal to the modern Alaskan Stream entry; Bowers Ridge, proximal to the glacial Alaskan Stream entry; and the Bering Sea shelf region, proximal to the modern sea ice extent. Four deep holes were drilled that ranged in depth from 600 to $745\;\mathrm{m}$ below seafloor, spanning 1.9 to 5 Ma in age. The water depths ranged from 818 to $3174\;\mathrm{m}$ in order to characterize past vertical water mass distribution and circulation. The highlights of our findings include the following:  

1. An understanding of the long-term evolution of surface water mass distribution during the past $5\ \mathrm{m.y}$ ., including the expansion of seasonal sea ice to Bowers Ridge between 3.0 and $2.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and the intensification of seasonal sea ice at both Bowers Ridge and the Bering slope at ${\sim}1.0\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , the mid-Pleistocene Transition. 2. The characterization of intermediate and deep water masses, including evidence from benthic foraminifers and sediment laminations, for episodes of low-oxygen conditions in the Bering Sea throughout the last $5\;\mathrm{m.y}$ . 3. The terrigenous and biogenic sedimentary history of the Bering Sea, including evidence for strong climatological and sea level control of siliciclastic deposition at all sites. Records of lithostratigraphic variations indicate that Bering Sea environmental conditions were strongly linked to global climate change; this is apparent both in long-term million year trends and in the orbital, millennial, and shorter oscillations within the lithostratigraphic records generated at sea.  

4. A large range of inferred microbial activity with notable site-to-site variations, including significant activity as deep as $700\;\mathrm{m}$ core depth below seafloor (CSF) at the Bering slope sites, and, in contrast, very low rates of microbial-mediated sulfate reduction at Bowers Ridge.  

# Introduction  

The rate and regional expression of recent global warming is difficult to understand and even more difficult to predict because of the complex nature of the climate system, whose components interact nonlinearly with various time lags and timescales. Paleoclimate and paleoceanographic studies present opportunities to study the dynamics of the climate system by examining how it responds to external forcing (e.g., greenhouse gas and solar radiation changes) and how it generates internal variability due to interacting Earth-system processes. Of note is the amplified recent warming of the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (Solomon et al., 2007), which is presumably related to sea ice albedo feedback and teleconnections to other regions; both the behavior of sea ice–climate interactions and the role of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation in climate change can be studied with geologic records of past climate changes in the Bering Sea.  

Prior to Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 323, little was known about the sedimentology and climate history of the Bering Sea outside of a few piston core studies (e.g., Cook et al., 2005; Okazaki et al., 2005; Tanaka and Takahashi, 2005; Takahashi et al., 2005) and Sites 188 and 185 (Scholl and Creager, 1973), which were drilled by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) in 1971 with old drilling technology and poor recovery. Past studies using piston cores in the Bering Sea indicated that, while current conditions in the Bering Sea promote seasonal sea ice formation, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) conditions sustained perennial or nearly perennial sea ice cover (Katsuki and Takahashi, 2005), attesting to the potential utility of sedimentary records in the Bering Sea to examine sea ice distributions. In paleoceanographic studies in the North Pacific, the Bering and Okhotsk seas have been implicated as sources of dense oxygenated intermediate water that possibly impacted oceanic and climate conditions throughout the Pacific on glacial–interglacial (e.g.,  

Gorbarenko, 1996; Matsumoto et al., 2002) and millennial (e.g., Hendy and Kennett, 2003) timescales. In addition, changes in Bering Sea conditions could be related to sea level and circulation changes, which alter flow through small straits that connect the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The lack of Bering Sea material has so far prevented the evaluation of these and other ideas.  

Seven sites whose terrigenous and biogenic components capture the spatial and temporal evolution of the Bering Sea through the Pliocene and Pleistocene were successfully drilled during Expedition 323 (Fig. F1; Tables T1, T2). Additionally, Expedition 323 collected a rich archive of information regarding the role of microbes on biogeochemical cycles in ultra-high-productivity environments, the postdepositional processes that impact geochemical, lithologic, and physical properties of the sediment, and past oceanic chemistry preserved in pore waters. This preliminary report presents background on environmental setting and important scientific questions in the Bering Sea, followed by highlights of the scientific findings of Expedition 323.  

# Background  

# Geological and physical setting  

With an area of $2.29\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{km}^{2}$ and a volume of $3.75\times10^{6}\;\mathrm{km}^{3}$ , the Bering Sea is the third largest marginal sea in the world, surpassed only by the Mediterranean and South China seas (Hood, 1983). Approximately one-half of the Bering Sea is a shallow $(0{-}200\;\mathrm{m})$ ) neritic environment, with the majority of the continental shelf spanning the eastern side of the basin off Alaska from Bristol Bay to the Bering Strait (Fig. F1). The northern continental shelf is seasonally ice covered, but little ice forms over the deep southwest areas. In addition to the shelf regions, two significant topographic highs have better $C a C O_{3}$ preservation than the deep basins: Shirshov Ridge, which extends south of the Koryak Range in eastern Siberia along $170^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ and separates the southwestern part of the Bering Sea into two basins, Komandorski (to the west) and Aleutian (to the east); and Bowers Ridge, which extends $300\,\mathrm{km}$ north from the Aleutian Island arc (Fig. F1). The Aleutian Basin is a vast plain $3800{-}3900\,\mathrm{m}$ deep with occasional gradually sloping depressions as deep as $4151\;\mathrm{m}$ (Hood, 1983).  

Three major rivers flow into the Bering Sea: the Kuskokwim and Yukon rivers drain central Alaska and the Anadyr River drains eastern Siberia (Fig. F1). The Yukon is the longest of the three rivers and supplies the largest discharge into the Bering Sea. Its discharge peaks in August because of meltwater and is about equal to that of the Mississippi. It has a mean annual flow of $5\times10^{3}\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s}_{.}$ , which is about two-thirds the annual flow of the Columbia River (Hood, 1983).  

Today, a substantial amount of water is transported in and out of the Bering Sea across the Aleutian Island arc and the Bering Strait through passes (Figs. F1, F2, F3). Water mass exchange with the Pacific through the Aleutian Islands, such as through the Kamchatka Strait, is significant, linking Bering Sea conditions to the Pacific climate. The Alaskan Stream, an extension of the Alaskan Current, flows westward along the Aleutian Islands and enters the Bering Sea mainly through the Amchitka Strait and to some extent through the Near Strait west of Attu Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands (Fig. F1). A part of the Subarctic Current also joins the Alaskan Stream, resulting in a combined volume transport of 11 Sv (Ohtani, 1965).  

Bottom and intermediate depth water in the Bering Sea originates from the North Pacific. After flowing into the Bering Sea it is slightly modified by the mixing of relatively fresh, warm water with very small amounts of bottom water formed within the Bering Sea today (Warner and Roden, 1995). Nutrient concentrations of North Pacific origin are high compared to all other regions in the global oceans; this explains the very low oxygen concentrations in the Bering Sea today (Fig. F4). The oxygen and nutrient composition of these waters is further modified by denitrification (Lehmann et al., 2005) and respiration of organic matter in the water column (Nedashkovskiy and Sapozhnikov, 1999). Respiration and the development of an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is particularly intense at water depths of ${\sim}1000\;\mathrm{m}$ (Fig. F4).  

Much of the Pacific water entering the Bering Sea is matched by outflow through the Aleutian Islands. The most significant outflow is through the Kamchatka Strait, which has a maximum depth of $4420\;\mathrm{m}$ (Stabeno et al., 1999) (Figs. F1, F3). If some component of North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW) or deep water formed in the Bering Sea in past times, particularly when sea level was lower, it would have flowed out through the Kamchatka Strait or a secondary outlet near the Commander–Near Strait at $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ (Fig. F1).  

The unidirectional northward transport of water mass $(0.8~\mathrm{{Sv})}$ from the Bering Sea through the Bering Strait to the Arctic Ocean contributes to the salinity and biogeochemical contrast between the Pacific and the Atlantic. The Bering Strait region is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world $(324{\mathrm{~g~}}\mathrm{C}/{\mathrm{m}^{2}}/{\mathrm{y}}$ over a wide area $[2.12\times10^{4}~\mathrm{km}^{2}]$ ) (Sambrotto et al., 1984). Much of this biologically produced organic matter and the associated nutrients flow into the Arctic Ocean because of the northward current direction. This may profoundly influence the present dominance of carbonate production in the Atlantic versus opal production in the Pacific, as described by models of basin-to-basin fractionation (Berger, 1970) and “carbonate ocean vs. silica ocean” (Honjo, 1990). Flow through the Bering Strait, which is ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ deep today (fig. 5 in Takahashi, 2005), was certainly different at times of lower sea level or enhanced perennial sea ice cover. The closing of this gateway and the accompanying changes in ocean and river flow through time could have caused changes in global patterns of circulation or in nutrient and salinity distributions.  

# Relationship to previous drilling in the Bering Sea, the subarctic North Pacific, and the Arctic Ocean  

During DSDP Leg 19 in 1971, six sites were drilled in the Bering Sea and four were drilled just south of the Aleutian Islands in order to generally characterize the sedimentary units and tectonic and structural evolution of the Bering Sea (Scholl and Creager, 1973). Although much of the sediment section was washed away and not cored, DSDP Leg 19 provided basic information on the types and ages of sediments in two of the regions (Umnak Plateau and Bowers Ridge) that were targeted by Expedition 323. Expedition 323 marks the first deployment of advanced piston corer (APC) technology in the region and thus the first collection of continuous high-resolution records of the past 5 m.y. from the Bering Sea. Specifically, drilling of DSDP Sites 184 and 185 on Umnak Plateau revealed a Pleistocene to upper Miocene clay-rich diatomaceous ooze (Unit A) above clayey siltstone with sparse fossils (Unit B). At DSDP Site 188 on Bowers Ridge, sedimentary units similar in lithology and age to those found at the Umnak Plateau sites were found. Although Sites 190 and 191 were drilled close to Shirshov Ridge and the Kamchatka Strait, they were located in the deep basins around Shirshov Ridge (water deeper than $3800\mathrm{~m}$ ) and sediments recovered were mainly turbidite sequences with reworked microfossils, making paleoceanographic interpretations difficult. Expedition 323 to the Bering Sea did not include drilling in the deep basins; rather, it targeted topographic highs above the basin floors where deposition of reworked sediments was expected to be minimal.  

In 1992, several important sites adjacent to the Bering Sea were explored during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 145: Sites 881, 882, 883, and 884 (Rea et al., 1995; Rea, Basov, Janecek, Palmer-Julson, et al., 1993; Rea, Basov, Scholl, and Allen, 1995). Maslin et al. (1996) observed a dramatic increase in ice-rafted debris (IRD), a decrease in sea-surface temperature $(>\!7.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and opal mass accumulation rates (MARs) (fivefold decrease), and a decrease in both total organic carbon (TOC) and $C a C O_{3}$ MARs at Site 882 $^{\left(50^{\circ}22^{\prime}\mathrm{N}\right)}$ , $167^{\circ}36^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; $3244\mathrm{~m})$ ) at $2.75\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , which is coeval with the IRD change found in the Norwegian Sea and suggests that the Arctic and northeast Asia were significantly glaciated from $2.75\;\mathrm{Ma}$ onward. Furthermore, they suggested that the onset of Eurasian Arctic and northeast Asia glaciation occurred ${\sim}100~\mathrm{k.y.}$ . before the Alaskan glaciation and 200 k.y. before the glaciation of Greenland and the northeast American continent. Both McKelvey et al. (1995) and Krissek (1995) suggest that the provenance of IRD in the northwest Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Alaska is the Bering Sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula and southeastern Alaska, respectively. By studying the Bering Sea in relation to other regions we can uncover details of the inception of glaciation in the Arctic and North Pacific regions at ${\sim}2.75\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Furthermore, the reasons for differences in the timing of glaciation can be investigated in detail using the sections from the Bering Sea, which are much higher resolution than those available in the open ocean pelagic realm.  

IODP Expedition 302 (Arctic Coring Expedition [ACEX]) to Lomonosov Ridge in the central Arctic Ocean took place in 2004, and the scientific community anticipated the acquisition of new information regarding the age and effects of the Bering Strait gateway to the Arctic. However, despite the expedition’s success in acquiring sediments spanning the Holocene to the Cretaceous (Backman, Moran, McInroy, Mayer, et al., 2006; Moran et al., 2006), it has been difficult to advance understanding of the significance of flow changes through the Bering Strait gateway on global or regional climate change without being able to compare these new Arctic records to those on the Pacific side of the Bering Strait. Thus, the cores recovered during Expedition 323 in the Bering Sea are essential to deciphering the history of the Bering Strait gateway and its potential impact on global and regional climatic and oceanic processes. The role of the exchange of heat and chemical constituents through the Bering Strait on Arctic and North Pacific environments as well as the influence of changes in this exchange on Northern Hemisphere glaciation (NHG) and higher frequency climate oscillations can only be assessed by comparing results from Bering Sea drilling with the results from Expedition 302.  

# Millennial-scale climate changes  

The Bering Sea contains sediments with high accumulation rates appropriate for the reconstruction of surface and deep water conditions and for the validation of climate/ ocean hypotheses that call on these regions as a variable source of open Pacific intermediate and deep water. In addition, climate change in the Bering Basin tends to be extremely sensitive to high-frequency changes due to the semi-isolated nature of the marginal sea. Sea level drop, for example, may produce a profound effect on water mass circulation, sea ice formation, salinity, and biological productivity in the basin (e.g., Takahashi, 1999). The pelagic signals of the open Pacific do not adequately provide the high-frequency climatic history of the northwest Pacific Rim.  

Changes in ventilation of subsurface water in the North Pacific may also influence climate downstream and be tied to North Atlantic climate changes on millennial timescales. Interestingly, millennial cycles in climate proxy records are apparently correlative across the North Pacific, for example in the Bering Sea (Cook et al., 2005), the Sea of Okhotsk (Sakamoto et al., 2005; Ono et al., 2005), the California margin (e.g., Behl and Kennett, 1996), and the Sea of Japan (e.g., Tada et al., 1999). Although the mechanisms for strong teleconnections between different sides of the North Pacific are not known, it has been proposed that changes in the Okhotsk (Ono et al., 2005) or Bering seas’ source(s) of NPIW could reach the California margin and influence the depth or strength of the OMZ (Cannariato and Kennett, 1999; Zheng et al., 2000), thereby connecting climate/ocean changes across the Pacific Ocean. The fact that millennial-scale records from the Pacific margins also appear to correlate to changes in North Atlantic climate (e.g., Behl and Kennett, 1996; Tada et al., 1999) indicates that processes that link Atlantic and Pacific climate could play an important role in global climate change.  

A number of possible theories explain paleoceanographic data from North Pacific marginal seas by implicating changes in NPIW formation due to changes in flow through the Bering Strait (Hasumi, 2002; De Boer and Nof, 2004; Shaffer and Bendtsen, 1994) and teleconnections from the tropics (Niebauer and Day, 1989; Alexander et al., 2002; Niebauer, 1998; Zhao et al., 2004; Gloersen, 1995). Our capacity to test these theories will benefit from documentation of surface and deep water conditions in the Bering Sea. Drilling has allowed us to obtain long sequences of sediments for the reconstruction of the climate cycles and for the evaluation of whether the patterns observed in the last glacial cycle are characteristic of all glacial–interglacial cycles. Long records will also be used to compare millennial climate oscillations in the Bering Sea in the Pleistocene, when there were large Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, to those in the Pliocene warm period, when there were only small Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, thereby shedding light onto whether the generation of these oscillations is related to NPIW ventilation, ice sheet size and dynamics, ocean circulation, and/or rapid reorganization of atmospheric circulation.  

# Glacial–Interglacial climate change  

In the last glacial cycle, enhanced dense water formed, probably from the Okhotsk and Bering seas (e.g., Zahn et al., 1991; Gorbarenko, 1996). In fact, the degree of ventilation of deep and intermediate Pacific waters appears to have fluctuated during the cold and warm periods, implying changes in the configuration of Pacific Ocean circulation (Keigwin, 1995; Matsumoto et al., 2002). However, the use of different nutrient proxies ( $\mathrm{\Delta^{813}C}$ vs. Cd/Ca in benthic foraminifers) provides some contradictory results. Furthermore, the limited spatial coverage of sites in the open Pacific prevents detailed identification of the exact source of intermediate and deep water as well as the exact circulation path of subsurface water masses. Observations of glacial records from the Bering Sea and just outside the Bering Sea on the Detroit Seamount in the North Pacific suggest a source of ventilated intermediate water coming from the Bering Sea and/or the Detroit Seamount region (Gorbarenko, 1996).  

Two examples of the prospective reconstructions of Bering Sea paleoceanography by Bering Sea drilling are reported in recent studies performed on the piston cores collected during the 1999 Hakuhou-Maru site survey cruise (Takahashi et al., 2005). Sea ice distribution during the glacial period was modulated by surface water circulation partially governed by the topography that resulted from the sea level drop. Note that the distribution of sea ice and water masses is significantly different in the two basins west and east of Bowers Ridge because of the pattern of surface ocean circulation (Katsuki and Takahashi, 2005). Past sources of NPIW formation during the four different time slices have been inferred from the intermediate water–dwelling radiolarian species Cycladophora davisiana (Tanaka and Takahashi, 2005). The degree of ventilation of intermediate and deep water will be fully scrutinized with more detailed information from Expedition 323.  

Despite evidence that Pacific circulation was different in the last glacial cycle, little is known about what caused circulation to change or what role the Pacific played in determining extreme climate conditions. Extensive studies of the North Atlantic clearly show that ice-sheet dynamics and changes in meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic can readily influence climate, yet no widely accepted paradigm explains how the North Pacific participates in and possibly impacts global climate change. Construction of long records of glacial–interglacial changes by drilling, especially under a range of boundary conditions over the Pliocene–Pleistocene, will contribute critical information needed to formulate a new North Pacific climate change paradigm.  

# Pliocene–Pleistocene trends  

Compelling evidence shows that North Pacific mid-depth water ${\sim}2500\;\mathrm{m})$ ) had much lower nutrient concentrations in the warm Pliocene ( $_{\cdot\sim4.5}$ to $3.0\,\mathrm{Mal}$ ) than today, indicating that it was more strongly ventilated (Kwiek and Ravelo, 1999; Ravelo and Andreasen, 2000). Although increased subsurface ventilation in the cold LGM and the warm Pliocene could be interpreted in a number of different ways and is likely not explained by the same processes, only data that directly reflect conditions in the Bering Sea (and the Sea of Okhotsk) can help constrain interpretations.  

The end of the early Pliocene warm period is characterized by the development of modern density stratification in the surface and deep North Pacific. IRD recovered at DSDP and ODP sites indicates that increased water mass stratification coincided with more extensive glaciation (Haug et al., 1999; Kwiek and Ravelo, 1999; Ravelo and Andreasen, 2000; Rea and Schrader, 1985). Furthermore, more IRD is found along the Aleutian Islands (DSDP Site 192) than farther north in the Bering Sea (Sites 186 and 191) due to more extensive ice cover in the north compared to more seasonal ice cover at the Aleutian site (McKelvey et al., 1995; Krissek, 1995). The fact that this North Pacific climate reorganization occurred synchronously with the onset of significant NHG as recorded in the Atlantic Ocean highlights the importance of studying North Pacific climate evolution as part of a comprehensive investigation of the regional expression of global climate trends.  

The emergence of the Bering Land Bridge (Beringia) prior to the Neogene is not well understood. However, Pliocene climate change—and perhaps the onset of NHG, specifically—could have been affected by changes in the marine gateway connection through the Bering Strait region. The connection may have developed in the late Miocene or the early Pliocene based on the occurrences of Atlantic-type mollusks in Hokkaido, Kamchatka, and the Alaska Peninsula in the late Miocene and early Pliocene. The oldest ages for these occurrences range from 6.3–5.1 to $2.2\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (e.g., Uozumi et al., 1986), but a recent study documented that the age of first occurrence was 5.5–5.4 Ma (Gladenkov, 2006). One of the aims of drilling was to recover better records of oceanographic evolution related to the Miocene/Pliocene gateway history. The oldest sediment recovered was ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , and long-term trends in Pliocene circulation will be documented to assess the possible influence of the tectonic opening of the Bering Sea if it happened as late as the Pliocene.  

Flow through the Bering Strait is likely controlled mainly by sea level change and changes in the amount of perennial sea ice. Pacific to Arctic flow through the Bering Strait $(\sim\!0.8\,\mathsf{S v})$ (Coachman and Aagaard, 1981) significantly influences the Pacific–Atlantic partitioning of physical and nutrient properties in the modern ocean and was possibly quite sensitive to past changes in sea level change due to its shallow sill of ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ (see Takahashi, 2005, for an illustration of the cross section). During glacial intervals, Atlantic Ocean biogenic sedimentation and preservation became more Pacific-like, and vice versa, and there were major changes in nutrient distributions. Drilling near the Bering Strait will help resolve whether major changes in Pacific–Atlantic partitioning of oceanographic properties were related to changes in flow through the Bering Sea. Neodenticula seminae, a dominant extant subarctic Pacific diatom, was found recently in Atlantic waters, possibly because recent warming and melting sea ice in the Arctic Ocean provided a passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic (Berard-Therriault et al., 2002; Corbyn, 2007). This species has been extinct in the Atlantic since $0.8\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Baldauf, 1987), and thus its recent reemergence in the Atlantic appears to be a significant indication that climate change in the Arctic influenced the distribution of this species.  

# Scientific objectives  

The objectives of Expedition 323 are as follows:  

1. To elucidate a detailed evolutionary history of climate and surface ocean conditions since the earliest Pliocene in the Bering Sea, where amplified high-resolution changes of climatic signals are recorded;   
2. To shed light on temporal changes in the origin and intensity of NPIW and possibly deeper water mass formation in the Bering Sea;   
3. To characterize the history of continental glaciation, river discharges, and sea ice formation in order to investigate the link between continental and oceanic conditions of the Bering Sea and adjacent land areas;   
4. To investigate linkages through comparison to pelagic records between ocean/ climate processes that occur in the more sensitive marginal sea environment and processes that occur in the North Pacific and/or globally. This objective includes evaluating how the ocean/climate history of the Bering Strait gateway region may have affected North Pacific and global conditions; and   
5. To constrain global models of subseafloor biomass and microbial respiration by quantifying subseafloor cell abundance and pore water chemistry in an ex  

tremely high productivity region of the ocean. We also aim to determine how subseafloor community composition is influenced by high productivity in the overlying water column.  

# Summary of expedition results  

# Overview of ages and sedimentation rates  

Expedition 323 in the Bering Sea focused on analyzing long-term ocean and climate trends and the evolution of higher frequency glacial–interglacial to millennial-scale oscillations through the Pliocene and Pleistocene. As such, our primary drilling objective was to obtain sediments whose components could be used to elucidate the detailed evolutionary history of climate, surface ocean, and intermediate water conditions since the earliest Pliocene in the Bering Sea, where amplified high-resolution changes of climatic signals are recorded. In addition, we sought to explore subseafloor microbial activity in the Bering Sea because of its extremely high surface productivity.  

Our objectives, in terms of acquiring the sediment core samples as well as conducting shipboard research, have been adequately met because our targeted drill sites had extremely high sedimentation rates (Fig. F5) containing abundant microfossils and other paleoceanographic proxies.  

Among the three drill sites explored in the Bowers Ridge region, both of the deepest holes drilled, Holes U1340A ( $605\mathrm{~m~}$ uncompressed core depth below seafloor [CSF]) and U1341B $\left(600\mathrm{~m~CSF}\right)$ ), represent the time spans between the Holocene to ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in the Pliocene (Fig. F5). The expedition’s initial goal of penetrating to ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ was adequately accomplished at both sites despite the failure of the extended core barrel (XCB) cutting shoe spacing sub in Hole U1340A, whose target depth of penetration was $700\textrm{m}$ . In the gateway region sites (at the Bering slope), two deep holes were drilled: Holes U1343E $744\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ ) and U1344A ( $745\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ ). Hole U1343E reached ${\sim}2.1\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , whereas Hole U1344A reached ${\sim}1.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Fig. F5). At other drill sites, the bottom ages or the sedimentary sequences based on biomagnetostratigraphy are as follows: Site U1339 (Umnak Plateau: $0.74\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ), Site U1342 (Bowers Ridge: $1.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ [with the exception of the middle Miocene sediments just above the basement]), and Site U1345 (gateway: $0.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ).  

The sediments recovered from Bowers Ridge display high sedimentation $({\sim}12\,\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . at Sites U1340 and U1341) without apparent hiatuses and are generally appropriate for high-resolution Pliocene–Pleistocene paleoceanography with adequate calcareous benthic foraminiferal preservation in the Pleistocene but lower preservation in the Pliocene. On the other hand, sediments at these sites are generally barren of planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils except in the section between ${\sim}2.5$ and $\sim\!3\mathrm{~Ma}$ . The abundance of all siliceous microfossils is generally high, enabling good biostratigraphy and paleoceanographic reconstruction. Furthermore, the upper part of Site U1340 ${\sim}20–150\ \mathrm{m}$ uncompressed core composite depth [CCSF-A]) had obvious soft-sediment deformation due to mass movement possibly caused by local seismic activity. Although such deformation hinders the continuous reconstruction of late Pleistocene high-resolution paleoceanography at this site, information from other drill sites can readily fill the gap.  

In the region of the Arctic gateway sites proximal to the Bering slope, the observed sedimentation rates were overwhelmingly high: Hole U1343E had sedimentation rates of $21{-}58\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ and Hole U1344A had rates of $29{-}50\ \mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . Sedimentation rates were so high, in fact, that drilling reached ages of only 2.1 and $1.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively, despite penetration to $745~\mathrm{m}~\mathrm{CSF}$ at each site. Such high sedimentation rates stem from the deposition of silt and clays transported by the Yukon and other rivers as well as the terrigenous sediments once deposited on the shelf. In spite of the high percentage of terrigenous materials, pertinent biotic proxies including benthic foraminifers and siliceous microfossils are adequately preserved, enabling future studies. Therefore, the overall coverage of excellent cores to ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ in the Bowers Ridge region and $\sim\!2\mathrm{~Ma}$ in the gateway region makes detailed, continuous high-resolution paleoceanographic studies relevant to global climate change possible.  

# Lithostratigraphic summary  

The seven sites drilled during Expedition 323 provide a continuous high-resolution record of the evolution of marine sedimentation in the marginal Bering Sea (Fig. F6). Onboard, lithologic, and sedimentologic analysis of the core sediments was carried out with a combination of visual core description, smear slide analysis, and, only for selected samples, X-ray diffractometry. Overall, the sediments recovered in the Bering Sea are a mixture of three components: biogenic (mainly diatom frustules with varying proportions of calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, silicoflagellates, and radiolarians), siliciclastic (mainly silt and, secondarily, sand and isolated IRD clasts of pebble to cobble size), and volcaniclastic (mainly fine ash). Other accessory lithologies identified include authigenic carbonates (dolomite and aragonite) and sulfides. The most prominent sedimentary features observed were decimeter- to meter-scale bedded alternations of sediment color and texture reflecting alternations in lithology. The sediments were generally highly bioturbated. However, fine-scale lamination preserving alternations between millimeter-scale laminae of biogenic and terrigenous material was also present in several of the drilled sites (Fig. F6).  

The distributions of the sedimentary components and sedimentary structures and their variability both within and between the Expedition 323 sites account for changes of the biogenic, glaciomarine, terrigenous, and volcanogenic sediment sources and the environmental conditions present during sediment deposition. The scales of these lithologic variations indicate that sedimentation in the Bering Sea has recorded long-term trends that include the critical period of reorganization of Earth’s climate from the warm early Pliocene and the transition into the ice ages. Milankovitch-scale (bedding) and sub-Milankovitch-scale (lamination) variability is also recorded. The physiographic setting of the different sites, their depths, and their location relative to the sediment source areas (continents, ice sheets, volcanoes, and upwelling centers) account for the marked regional differences in sediment composition, especially between the Pleistocene sections of the Bowers Ridge and Bering slope sites.  

The preliminary results of Expedition 323 suggest that the history of sedimentation in the Bering Sea is broadly characterized by three main sedimentary phases that occurred between ${\sim}5$ and ${\sim}2.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , $\sim\!2.7$ and ${\sim}1.74\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , and ${\sim}1.74\;\mathrm{Ma}$ to recent (Fig. F6).  

The oldest portion of the sedimentary record (between ${\sim}5$ and ${\sim}2.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ) was retrieved only at Bowers Ridge Sites U1340 and U1341. Sedimentation during the early middle Pliocene was relatively high (Fig. F5) and characterized by biogenic diatom ooze with minor amounts of diatom silt, sponge spicules, and vitric ash. Although the Pliocene sediment is commonly bioturbated, distinct intervals characterized by extensive lamination also occur. The oldest laminated intervals $(<3.8\mathrm{\Ma})$ were observed at Site U1341. Stratigraphic intervals where laminations are concentrated are indicative of the depth of the OMZ. Isolated IRD pebbles were observed in sediments older than $3.8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ only at Site U1340. Limited dropstone occurrence prior to $2.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ was also reported at two sites drilled in the northern Pacific during Leg 145 (ODP Sites 881 and 883) and in the Yakataga Formation in Alaska (Lagoe et al., 1993), which suggests the development of ice sheets prior to the onset of NHG (Krissek, 1995).  

The middle section of Sites U1340 and U1341 (between $\sim\!2.7$ and $1.74\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) is characterized by beds of diatom ooze with minor amounts of calcareous nannofossils and foraminifer ooze alternating with diatom silt beds. The latter are composed of subequal proportions of siliciclastic (silt-sized quartz, feldspar, and rock fragments and/ or clay) and biogenic (mainly diatom and, secondarily, calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, silicoflagellates, and sponge spicules) components and minor volcaniclastic components. Dropstone occurrence is common—indicating a peak in siliciclastic deposition that has also been observed at Leg 145 sites—and coincides with the beginning of NHG. However, the dramatic drop in paleoproductivity recorded at Site 882 (Haug et al., 1999) is not present at the Bowers Ridge sites where, conversely, the biogenic component is high throughout the late Pliocene and Pleistocene.  

All sites drilled during Expedition 323 preserve a record of sedimentation ranging from the late Pliocene through the Holocene (between $1.74\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and recent). Lithologies and sedimentation rates vary between the different sites, as indicated by a basinwide comparison of the evolution of sedimentation in the Bering Sea during this period (Fig. F6). The slowest sedimentation rates (only $4.5\,\mathrm{cm/k.y.})$ ) were observed at Site U1342, where laminated foraminifer-rich diatom ooze beds alternate with silty clay beds at scales ranging in the Milankovitch band. The same temporal interval corresponds to a much thicker section at Sites U1340 and U1341, where the bedding alternations are less distinct and the abundance of IRD is higher. Although lamination is common at Sites U1342 and U1340, laminae are virtually absent at the deeper Site U1341, suggesting a shallowing of the depth of the OMZ during most of the Pleistocene. At the Bering Sea slope site, sedimentation rates are about three times higher than at the Bowers Ridge sites. At Sites U1339, U1343, and U1344, siliciclastic-rich beds (mostly diatom-rich silt clay) and mixed siliciclastic-biogenic beds (clay, silt, and diatom ooze with varying abundance of foraminifers, nannofossils, and sponge spicules) alternate rhythmically. The sections are pervasively bioturbated and laminated intervals are rare. Overall, sedimentation on the Bering slope is characterized by higher influence of both siliciclastic material delivered by ice sheets as well as terrigenous sedimentation derived from the continental shelf and slope, which are indented by some of the largest submarine canyons in the world. However, because of their proximity to the continents, it is not clear whether the sediments characterized by high siliciclastic content are recording periods of ice sheet expansion (stadials) or increased runoff (interstadials). IRD is a common feature at all sites during this time period and increases significantly around $^{1\mathrm{~Ma~}}$ , as is also observed in coeval sediments from the North Pacific based on the results of Leg 145 (Krissek, 1995).  

# Cyclical siliciclastic deposition and its relationship to climate change  

Expedition 323 in the Bering Sea is the first expedition to recover deep continuous sections of sediment, providing an opportunity to study sediment distributions in time and space in the Bering Sea. The plethora of climatic and sedimentary structure information in the cores will allow us to develop an understanding of the influence of climate changes on sedimentation. Clearly, siliciclastics are a dominant component of all Bering slope sites and are less dominant at the Bowers Ridge sites. At all sites, because the sediments are primarily comprised of mixtures of siliciclastics and diatom frustules, the physical magnetic properties and natural gamma ray (NGR) measurements made on the tracks and with the logging tools generally provide information on the relative proportions of clays/silts versus diatoms (although ash is a significant component of the sediment at Site U1339). The NGR records (Fig. F6) indicate clear cyclicity; the amplitude and wavelength change markedly with depth at the Bering slope site but not at the Bowers Ridge sites. Specifically, at the Bering slope sites (Sites U1339, U1343, U1344, and U1345) in sediment younger than $\sim\!1\,\mathrm{\,Ma}$ the NGR record appears to vary with lower amplitude and across a wide range of frequencies higher than $1/40\;\mathrm{k.y.}$ ., than it does in sediment older than $1\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Fig. F6; see NGR records of Sites U1343 and U1344). Because Sites U1339 and U1345 are short records younger than $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , longer term trends in the character of the variability can only be evaluated in the longer NGR records of Sites U1343 and U1344; however, the relatively high frequency variability of the NGR data from the younger sediment is evident at all four sites.  

This change in the character of the variability is also apparent in the logging data from Sites U1343 and U1344 (Fig. F7). The downhole logging data provide our only opportunity to derive continuous records of lithologic variability in the deeper sections where only one hole was drilled and where continuous composites of data generated on the cores cannot be spliced together as they are in the sections with multiple drill holes. The potassium concentrations $(\mathrm{K\%})$ measured by the logging tool are generally related to the terrigenous clay concentrations, although variations in mineralogy of the terrigenous fraction could have a secondary influence. In this sedimentary environment, it appears that NGR represents the amount of terrigenous material relative to biogenic material in the sediment. Although much more research is needed, the shipboard data indicate that high siliciclastic relative to biogenic deposition probably occurred during colder periods or possibly during deglaciations.  

Applying the shipboard age model to the $K\%$ record at Site U1343 and performing spectral analyses on the record (not shown) indicate that variability in $K\%$ dominantly occurs with 40 k.y. periodicity in periods older than $\sim\!1\mathrm{~Ma}$ . In the portion of the record younger than $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , the variance is dispersed among many frequencies; 40 k.y. periodicity does not dominate the spectrum. Benthic $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005) indicate that variability of ice volume and therefore of eustatic sea level occurs primarily with $40\ \mathrm{k.y.}$ . periodicity prior to ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ (referred to as the $^{\prime}40\,\mathrm{~K~}$ world”). As such, it appears that sea level may control the timing of pulses of sedimentation at the Bering slope sites. Sea level highstands in warm periods may be times when deposition of sediments on shelves occurred at the expense of sediment deposition on the slope. As ice volume increased, sea level fell, the coastline moved seaward, and the flux of terrigenous material to the slope may have increased. This simple explanation of how sea level controlled long-lived pulses of sediment at Sites U1343 and U1344 may explain how global climate change indirectly controlled the timing of sediment deposition at the slope sites during the $40\,\mathrm{K}$ world. After $1\,\mathrm{Ma}$ the variability of the sediment composition changed, as reflected by logging $K\%$ . NGR core measurements do not appear to be simply related to sea level change, which occurred dominantly with ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{k.y}$ . variability; rather, the pulses of sedimentation appear to occur with much higher frequency. It is unclear why this happened, but the increase in sea ice diatom and sea ice dinoflagellate forms (discussed in the next section) at $\sim\!1\mathrm{~Ma}$ may indicate that high-frequency variability in siliciclastic deposition related to sea ice processes may be an important process—perhaps more important than global ice volume and concomitant sea level changes, which occur with lower frequency.  

A close look at magnetic (Fig. F8) and density (not shown) data provides additional details about processes that may dictate terrigenous deposition. At first glance the record of relative magnetic paleointensity of the sediment at Sites U1343 and U1344 agrees with the $K\%$ records and indicates a change in depositional style and cyclicity at $\sim\!1\,\mathrm{\,Ma}$ (Fig. F8), with lower frequency and higher amplitude changes prior to $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at the Bering slope sites. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM)/Chi is an index that attempts to normalize intensity by the concentration of magnetic grains. However, changes in grain size distributions may also impact this ratio; low NRM/Chi values indicate that magnetic grains are coarser than those in sediment with higher NRM/ Chi values. Grain-size differences can be related to a variety of climatically controlled factors as well as to diagenetic dissolution of the smallest clay-sized grains. The fact that NRM and Chi each show distinct variability with the same length scale representing 40 k.y. cycles suggests that the primary factor controlling the magnetic susceptibility and paleointensity records is related to the relative amount of terrigenous material. This also indicates that diagenetic overprints may alter but not obliterate the primary signal. The fact that the amplitude of changes in the paleointensity record (Fig. F9) downcore are even more extreme than those seen in the NGR and $K\%$ data suggests that, if anything, diagenetic overprints may amplify the contrast between sediments with varying amounts of siliciclastics grains.  

After $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , during the time period of large $100\;\mathrm{k.y.}$ . ice volume cycles, gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density records vary across a spectrum of frequencies. However, they more clearly show long-period variance characteristic of the 100 k.y. ice age cycles than they do other physical parameter properties. For example, after 1 Ma paleointensity (Fig. F8) and NGR (Fig. F6) variability have power distributed across low (orbital) and suborbital frequencies. This indicates that terrigenous deposition at the Bering slope sites in the late Pleistocene was likely a combination of many processes such as bottom water current deposition of fine-grained material (drift), IRD from sea ice and icebergs, and mass sediment transfer from the shelf to the lower slope and abyss. Superimposed on this are possibly independent or nonlinearly related changes in biogenic fluxes and postdepositional processes such as diagenesis and precipitation of authigenic minerals. The periodic and stochastic forces that drive each of these processes could be different, resulting in rich records of lithologic variability in the latest Pleistocene.  

On Bowers Ridge at Sites U1340, U1341, and U1342, the trends and variability in siliciclastics appear to be notably different than at the Bering slope sites, as indicated by the NGR (Fig. F6), $K\%$ (Fig. F7), and NRM/Chi (Fig. F8) records. Unlike the Bering slope sites, there are some marked long-term trends in the Bowers Ridge records. A notable change in Site U1341 logging $K\%$ data occurs at ${\sim}425\mathrm{~m~}$ depth (Fig. F7) along with an increase in the observed silt content and dropstones in the sediment in smear slides (Fig. F6). This level in the section is equivalent in time to $\sim\!3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and may signify that the Bering Sea regional expression of NHG includes an increase in clays and silts delivered via sea ice or icebergs to Bowers Ridge. The fact that $K\%$ decreases above this level in the section even while the ice ages persisted is difficult to explain. One possibility is that the warmer climate of the Pliocene facilitated the formation of K-rich clays on land that were shed into the Bering Sea once the ice ages began. K-rich clay formation could have then decreased when the climate cooled. The NGR, magnetic susceptibility, and sedimentological smear slide and descriptive data indicate increasing amounts of terrigenous material upsection with a pronounced increase at $\sim\!1\,\mathrm{\,Ma}$ , probably due to a greater supply of ice-rafted siliciclastics to Bowers Ridge once large 100 k.y. glaciations occurred.  

As at the Bering slope sites, the variability of physical properties in sediments younger than $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at Bowers Ridge appears to include higher frequency variability than the $100\,\mathrm{\textbf{k}}.\mathrm{\textbf{y}}$ . ice volume cycles. Again, higher frequency climate variability, including changes in the distribution of sea ice and icebergs delivering sediment to Bowers Ridge, may dominate the mode of sediment deposition in the Bering Sea after $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . However, unlike at the Bering slope sites the variability of all lithologic parameters studied—NGR, magnetic susceptibility, and GRA bulk density—in sediment older than 1 Ma at Bowers Ridge is not dominantly paced by 40 k.y. ice volume cycles. One explanation is that even in the $40~\mathrm{K}$ world sediment delivery to Bowers Ridge was paced at least in part by processes other than sea level change. Spectral analyses of $K\%$ data from Site U1341 at Bowers Ridge indicate that variability occurs across a spectrum of frequencies, with notable concentrations of variance at $40\,\mathrm{k.y.}$ . and $23\,\mathrm{k}$ .y. periodicities. During the $40\,\mathrm{K}$ world, cycles and episodes of deposition of IRD on Bowers Ridge were possibly impacted by regional climate changes responding to both obliquity $(40\;\mathrm{k.y.})$ and precession $(23\mathrm{~k.y.})$ solar radiation changes. In contrast, at the Bering slope, sea level variations that occur dominantly with 40 k.y. periodicity were the main factor controlling the transport of sediment from the continent/shelf to the slope. The observation that high-latitude climate was responding to precession forcing during the $40~\mathrm{K}$ world has important implications, not only for theories that explain ice volume changes, but ultimately for our understanding of ice sheet dynamics and our ability to predict ice sheet response to radiative forcing.  

# History of sea ice development  

The investigation of the evolutionary history of climate and surface ocean conditions is primarily approached by studying microfossils, sedimentology, and physical properties of sediments. This is particularly true for the influence of sea ice formation and the flow of the relatively warm oligotrophic Pacific surface waters into the Bering Sea.  

One of the most striking findings of Expedition 323 is the general sea ice distribution history of the Bering Sea for the past 5 m.y. As described in “Overview of ages and sedimentation rates,” the first sign of sea ice is the presence of pebbles, which are thought to be transported as IRD starting at ${>}3.8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ at Site U1340 (Fig. F6), indicating the formation of sea ice or iceberg transportation to the Bowers Ridge region. The bulk of the evolution of sea ice distribution has been interpreted from shipboard analyses of sea ice diatoms and sea ice–related dinoflagellate taxa and to a lesser extent by other diatom taxa and intermediate water–dwelling radiolarians (see below for details).  

The details of sea ice evolution are derived from changes in the relative abundance of sea ice diatom taxa, which are represented mainly by Thalassiosira antarctica spores (Abelmann, 1992a) and sea ice dinoflagellates (Fig. F9). The first signs of sea ice diatoms and dinoflagellates are subtle increases in their abundance at Bowers Ridge at Site U1340, starting at ${\sim}3.4~\mathrm{Ma}$ for dinoflagellates and ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ for diatoms, coincident with NHG (Maslin et al., 1996). After $\sim\!2\mathrm{~Ma}$ the sea ice assemblage signals become progressively stronger into the present, up to values of ${\sim}10\%{-}20\%$ . In contrast to the Bowers Ridge sites, sea ice cover at the Bering slope sites is markedly severe, indicated by sea ice assemblage percentages significantly higher than the values observed at Bowers Ridge. Sea ice diatom values range from ${\sim}10\%$ to $50\%$ during the latest Pliocene and increase from ${\sim}30\%$ to $70\%$ during the Pleistocene. The abundance of sea ice dinoflagellates also increases but not to the same extent as sea ice diatoms. Notably, sea ice diatom and sea ice dinoflagellate assemblages clearly show a significant increase in both abundance and amplitudes of variability at around the mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) (Fig. F9). Analogous to sea ice–associated diatom and dinoflagellate taxa, a clear increasing trend in abundance of intermediate water– dwelling radiolarian taxa at the MPT is also observed at Sites U1343 and U1344. This is consistent with the interpretation that the surface water became gradually more affected by the formation of sea ice as climate progressively cooled; in the presence of sea ice, surface-dwelling radiolarians disappeared, and, as a consequence, the relative percentages of intermediate water dwellers such as Cycladophora davisiana were higher (Abelmann, 1992b; Okazaki et al., 2003).  

At Sites U1343 and U1344, which are located closer than the Bowers Ridge sites to the southern boundary of today’s seasonal sea ice maximum extent, a dramatic change in the dominance of dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from autotrophic to heterotrophic taxa is evident at ${\sim}1.2–1.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . This suggests that sea ice formation occurred well before the time when the abundance of sea ice taxa significantly increased at $\sim\!1\mathrm{~Ma}$ . Heterotrophic dinoflagellates feed mainly on diatoms (Jacobson and Anderson, 1986) and their abundance is most likely the result of food availability; hence, they can persist in ice-laden environments. On the other hand, the low production of their autotrophic counterparts, which dwell mainly in open waters without sea ice, could be related to these taxa being out-competed in the presence of blooming diatom populations in regions of seasonal sea ice cover. Furthermore, heterotrophic dinoflagellate cysts dominate the assemblages in polar areas where sea ice occurs up to 12 months per year (e.g., Rochon et al., 1999). The sea ice–associated species Islandinium minutum, known to be very abundant or dominant in the Arctic Ocean and subarctic regions with pronounced sea ice cover (Head et al., 2001; Hamel et al., 2002), appeared to increase at $\sim\!1\mathrm{~Ma}$ at both Sites U1343 and U1344 (Fig. F9). Along with significant increases of both sea ice dinoflagellates and sea ice diatoms (e.g., Thalassiosira antarctica spores) at $\sim\!1\mathrm{~Ma}$ at both sites, a rather significant drop in the abundance of Neodenticula seminae, a typical pelagic diatom, is also seen. All of these biotic events are within the time interval of the MPT, which spans from $\sim\!1.2$ to $0.8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and marks the transition from 41 k.y. obliquity ice volume cycles to larger ice age cycles that vary at ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{k.y}$ .  

As noted above, the Bowers Ridge and Bering slope regions show distinct differences in the extent of sea ice cover throughout the last ${\sim}2.1\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ , the time period covered by the sedimentary records of both regions. The extent of sea ice cover of the latter is substantially greater than that of the former because of the distal locations of the three Bering slope sites, which are most prone to perennial sea ice cover in the Bering Sea. The spatial differences in sea ice cover today are mainly attributed to the surface water circulation pattern (Fig. F2); this spatial difference appears to have persisted since at least $2.1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , implying that the surface water circulation patterns have also persisted (see below for details with N. seminae and other taxa). This is further supported by the fact that at Site U1339 on Umnak Plateau, the site closest to an entry point of Alaskan Stream subarctic Pacific water, the sea ice taxa suggest lower levels of sea ice cover compared to the Bering slope sites farther north, which are not as heavily impacted by Alaskan Stream water. Furthermore, Katsuki and Takahashi (2005) illustrated that during the low sea level stand of the Last Glacial Maximum, the relatively warm subarctic Alaskan Stream water entered into the Bering Sea through the western Aleutian passes rather than the eastern passes because of their shallow water depth. After entry it turns eastward, flowing counter-clockwise around Bowers Ridge, and consequently reaches the southeast corner of the Bering Sea, close to Site U1339 on Umnak Plateau, before turning northwest. It is surprising that the spatial pattern of sea ice and surface water circulation observed in the last glacial period, including the stronger influence of warm Alaskan Stream water at Umnak Plateau compared to at the northern Bering slope, persists over long timescales.  

# Changes in biological productivity and the influence of subarctic Pacific surface water mass flowing into the Bering Sea  

Based on the spatial distributions of long-term temporal changes of three diatom taxa (Coscinodiscus marginatus, Neodenticula, and Actinocyclus curvatulus), it is clear that the influence of subarctic Pacific waters, which are relatively warm and less eutrophic than Bering Sea waters, has typically been strongest at the Bowers Ridge sites, followed by the Umnak site; the weakest influence of this warm water mass has occurred at the Bering slope sites (Fig. F10). This is the same pattern found by Katsuki and Takahashi’s (2005) study of past water mass circulation patterns, which they inferred from sea ice distributions from the last glacial period. The longer records from Expedition 323 indicate that as climate cooled through the Pleistocene, pelagic water influence at all the sites progressively weakened. Furthermore, the sites closest to straits through which pelagic water flows into the Bering Sea have consistently higher abundances of subarctic diatom species than those downstream in the counter-clockwise circulation pattern of the surface water masses.  

From the bottom of the holes upward in the Bowers Ridge sites, a marked drop in Coscinodiscus marginatus was seen at $\sim\!3\mathrm{~Ma}$ at Site U1341 and at ${\sim}2.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at Site U1340 (Fig. F10). This can be interpreted as resulting from a sharp reduction in supply of nutrients due to the development of upper layer stratification. It is apparent that the diatom taxon C. marginatus requires a relatively high nutrient supply and tolerates low light intensity. This is substantiated by the fact that (1) today this diatom taxon dwells in the lower euphotic zone off Spain (Nogueira et al., 2000; Nogueira and Figueiras, 2005), and (2) it occurs during early winter (\~November–January) in the subarctic Pacific and the Bering Sea based on time-series sediment trapping (Takahashi, 1986; Takahashi et al., 1989; Onodera and Takahashi, 2009). Thus, high demand of nutrient supply and low demand of light intensity is apparent for this taxon. This timing of $3{-}2.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ coincides approximately with the so-called end of “opal dump” observed in the subarctic Pacific at ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ , which is coincidental with the onset of NHG (Maslin et al., 1996). Although the reduction in C. marginatus around the time of NHG persisted, an overwhelmingly continuous presence of diatom ooze and interbedded diatom ooze and silt sediments accumulated throughout the Pliocene–Pleistocene in the Bering Sea. This clearly suggests that a high amount of opal sedimentation continued after the onset of NHG well into the Pleistocene.  

The 5 m.y. long-term trend of Neodenticula (N. kamtschatica, N. koizumii, N. seminae, and Neodenticula sp.) in the Bowers Ridge region shows the following two patterns.  

Generally higher percent values are observed from the hole bottoms up until \~2.9–2.7 Ma, depending on the hole, than are observed for the sections above. From there onward there seems to be a decline in Neodenticula with sizable fluctuations that indicate surface water stratification progressively developed as the climate cooled from the Pliocene into the Pleistocene. The general antiphase relationship of this taxon versus Actinocyclus spp. (Fig. F10) suggests subtle and perhaps periodic changes in stratification/water mass circulation as the colder climate developed. This is generally true for Sites U1340 and U1341 at Bowers Ridge and Site U1343 off the Bering slope. The data from Site U1344, however, provide a more complicated picture than this and do not show a clear antiphase relationship trend, probably because of the overwhelmingly high abundance of sea ice–associated diatoms such as Thalassiosira antarctica spores (Abelmann, 1992a) ( ${\sim}25\%$ during $4{-}0.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ; ${\sim}40\%$ during $0.9–0\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ) (Fig. F10). Furthermore, an even more clearly visible antiphase relationship of Actinocyclus spp. versus $N$ . seminae is seen during ${\sim}1.9~\mathrm{Ma}$ and $1.1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at Site U1343. Their percentages increased at ${\sim}1.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Marked declines are seen for both taxa at slightly different times (Actinocyclus spp. at ${\sim}1.1\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and $N.$ . seminae at $0.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ), both of which are around the MPT (Fig. F10). The upheaval of both taxa during this time interval is identical. During intervals of high eutrophic levels suggested by high Actinocyclus spp., cooler, low trophic subarctic Pacific waters, indicated by N. seminae, were introduced into the Bering Sea. This is based on the geographic and seasonal distributions of Actinocyclus curvatulus, which appears to be ecologically similar to Thalassiosira trifulta and, to a lesser extent, N. seminae (Sancetta, 1982; Takahashi, 1986; Takahashi et al., 1989). As surface waters became increasingly stratified, especially after ${\sim}0.9\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ with Milankovitchscale 100 k.y. climatic cyclic regimes, N. seminae declined with the emerging sea ice diatoms.  

# Changes in bottom and intermediate water conditions  

Much of the Pacific water entering the Bering Sea is matched by outflow through the Aleutian Islands. The most significant outflow is through the Kamchatka Strait, which has a maximum water depth of $4420\;\mathrm{m}$ . If some component of North Pacific Intermediate or deep water formed in the Bering Sea in the past, particularly when sea level was lower, it would have flowed out through the Kamchatka Strait or a secondary outlet near the Commander–Near Strait at $2000\,\mathrm{m}$ . One of the scientific objectives of Expedition 323 was to elucidate the history, temporal variability, and intensity of NPIW and deep water formation in the Bering Sea and its links to surface water processes. This objective was partially fulfilled during the expedition but would have been more adequately addressed had we obtained permission to drill two important sites located in Russian territorial waters, Shirshov Ridge Site SHR-3B at $2232\:\mathrm{m}$ water depth and Site KST-1B inside the Kamchatka Strait at $3435\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth. The main objective at these sites was to monitor deep water masses flowing out of the Bering Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, seven sites were successfully cored and complete records of environmental variability of intermediate and deep water sites spanning the Pleistocene to the Pliocene were recovered during Expedition 323. The sites ranged from 818 to $3174\mathrm{~m~}$ and allow for the characterization of past vertical water mass distribution and for the reconstruction of the history and distribution of the OMZ in the region (Fig. F4).  

Previous observations made in glacial records from the Bering Sea and just outside the Bering Sea on the Detroit Seamount in the North Pacific suggest a source of ventilated intermediate water coming from the Bering Sea and/or the Detroit Seamount region (Gorbarenko, 1996). Furthermore, other paleoceanographic reconstructions of the Bering Sea, made possible by the R/V Hakuhou-Maru piston coring survey cruise in 1999, show past NPIW formation during four different time slices, reconstructed based on the high oxygen indicator and intermediate water–dwelling radiolarian species Cycladophora davisiana. According to these studies, the role of the Bering Sea in NPIW formation is apparently visible during the cold intervals.  

Shipboard analyses of sediment samples recovered during Expedition 323 show continuous recovery of Pliocene to Holocene deep sea benthic foraminifers and midwater radiolarians at all sites (Figs. F11, F12), although calcareous benthic foraminifers appear to be rare in the middle and early Pliocene. The benthic foraminifer faunal composition displays large assemblage changes and shifts in species dominance. These changes are likely related to variability in local oxygen concentration in the bottom waters associated with surface water productivity and/or deepwater ventilation on Milankovitch timescales. For example, Bulimina aff. exilis, a common species in the Bering Sea samples, is generally regarded as a low oxygen/deep infaunal species and has been found in samples associated with high productivity and low sea ice (e.g., Bubenshchikova et al., 2008; Kaiho, 1994).  

Bering Sea benthic foraminifers show affinities to assemblages found within or near the OMZ in the Sea of Okhotsk and also to more common deep Pacific Ocean assemblages. The faunal similarity between the two marginal seas and the deep Pacific Ocean will allow for the reconstruction of the physico-chemical characteristics of deep and intermediate water masses as a result of changes in surface productivity, deepwater ventilation, sea ice coverage, and continental glaciation.  

Previous piston core studies showed a large increase in the intensity of the OMZ during the last deglacial at Umnak Plateau (Okazaki et al., 2005), suggesting a relationship between productivity and terrestrial nutrient supply from melting. However, there is no information regarding the longer timescale relationship through the Pleistocene. Analysis of faunas from the newly drilled Bering Sea sites will be particularly important in extending this record through the entire Pliocene (at Bowers ridge) and Pleistocene (at Bowers ridge and the Bering slope) and will allow us to decipher the onset and evolution of the OMZ and provide further insight into NPIW production at the marginal sea. Furthermore, Site U1344 at ${\sim}3200\mathrm{~m~}$ is presently located below the OMZ and also has the potential to monitor past deepwater changes.  

A striking finding of the expedition was the relatively low oxygen content of intermediate water mass conditions at most sites during the last $5\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ ., as indicated by the presence of episodic laminated sediment intervals throughout the entire sections. However, the benthic foraminiferal faunas recovered from deep cored Sites U1340 and U1341 suggest that in general the Bering Sea intermediate and deep waters were better oxygenated in the early Pliocene, as suggested by the presence of the agglutinated foraminifer Martinottiella communis (Fig. F12), and less oxygenated during the last ${\sim}2\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ , as suggested by the increase in deep infaunal benthic foraminifers (Fig. F11). This assemblage is composed of abundant calcareous benthic genera (e.g., Bulimina, Globobulimina, Islandiella, Nonionella, and Valvulineria) that are typically indicative of reduced oxygen conditions (Bubenshchikova et al., 2008).  

High sediment accumulation rate Sites U1339 and U1345, located within the OMZ today (Fig. F4), reveal high-amplitude variability in the relative abundance of the deep infaunal assemblage since $0.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . This appears to be associated with interglacial–deglacial cyclicity, showing higher abundance of deep infaunal species (reflecting the lowest bottom water oxygen conditions) during interglacials, in particular strong interglacials marine isotope Stages (MIS) 1, 5, and 11. Higher bottom water oxygen conditions appear to correlate with glacials. Furthermore, Sites U1340, U1343, and U1344 contain well-preserved foraminifers over the last 2 m.y. with increasing absolute abundances of benthic and planktonic taxa across the MPT $({\sim}0.8{-}1.1\ \mathrm{Ma})$ in association with an increase in abundance of the polar planktonic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral. This cooling trend was also observed as an increase in the abundance of sea ice dinoflagellates and diatoms and intermediate water–dwelling radiolarians (e.g., C. davisiana). Cooling of the surface waters would have enhanced ventilation of the intermediate waters during glacials and increased density stratification during interglacials, contributing to the drop in oxygen content in the intermediate and bottom waters at these times, which is suggested by the increase in deep infaunal benthic foraminifer taxa.  

# Microbiology in high surface productivity environments  

The microbiological objectives of Expedition 323 were to constrain global models of subseafloor biomass and microbial respiration by quantifying subseafloor cell abundance and pore water chemistry in an extremely high productivity region of the ocean. We also sought to determine how subseafloor community composition is influenced by high productivity in the overlying water column.  

To meet these objectives, high-resolution sampling for microbiological analyses and pore water chemistry took place at five sites throughout the Bering Sea. Each site was selected based upon its distance from land and its levels of marine productivity determined by annual chlorophyll-a concentrations in the water column.  

Four cores were drilled using the APC system to ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF at each microbiology-dedicated hole. Contamination tests using perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT) and fluorescent beads (Smith et al., 2000) were performed in each hole, showing that contamination from the drill fluid was insignificant.  

Sediment samples were taken for determination of cell abundance measurements (a proxy for microbial biomass) and diversity and structure of the microbial community. In general, these samples were taken every $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ for Sections 1H-1 to 2H-3 (or 2H-6), and every $75~\mathrm{cm}$ for Core 3H. Below Core 3H, the sampling resolution was one per core. Interstitial water whole-rounds were taken with the same resolution adjacent to microbiology whole-rounds. In addition, $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole-rounds were taken for interstitial water and microbiological analyses at an interval of one per core until APC refusal. Interstitial water sampling continued at this resolution in XCB cores, and microbiology samples for cell abundance, diversity, and community structure were collected at $\mathord{\sim}400$ and ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. PFT analyses showed no drill-fluid contamination at these depths.  

Interstitial water samples were squeezed immediately on board and aliquots were fixed for both shore-based and shipboard analysis. The shipboard aliquots were used to determine concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), alkalinity, sulfate, sulfide, ammonium, phosphate, major ions (e.g., Ca, Na, and K), and minor ions (e.g., Fe and Mn). These data along with formation factor data allow for a quantitative determination of microbial respiration rates (D’Hondt et al., 2002).  

The geochemical data obtained during the expedition show that the microbial activity along the slope sites (i.e., Sites U1339, U1343, U1344, and U1345) is substantially higher and more diverse in terms of respiration pathways than at Site U1342 at Bowers Ridge. At the slope sites, the concentrations of microbial respiration products such as DIC, ammonium, and phosphate are approximately an order of magnitude higher than at Bowers Ridge (Fig. F13). A shallow sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ) $({\sim}6{-}11\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF})$ is also present (Fig. F13), indicating that both methanogenesis and sulfate reduction based on methane oxidation occur in these sediments. Interstitial water data further suggest the presence of microbial-mediated Fe and Mn reduction. Interestingly, the geochemical profiles even suggest significant microbial activity as deep as $700\textrm{m}$ CSF. In contrast, at Bowers Ridge sulfate penetrates to the basement and is almost unaltered with depth, suggesting only very low rates of microbial-mediated sulfate reduction. Methane is below the detection limit. The difference in microbial activity at these sites might be caused by different rates of water column productivity and sedimentation.  

We expect that the differences in the geochemical parameters between the slope and ridge sites will be reflected in microbial abundance and diversity. A larger and more diverse microbial community at the slope sites is likely. Specifically, we expect elevated cell abundance and a consortium of bacteria and archaea at the SMTZ. At the slope sites, geochemical profiles suggest that methanogens, iron reducers, manganese reducers, and sulfate reducers exist throughout the sediment column. At Bowers Ridge, geochemical profiles indicate that only sulfate reducers and nitrate reducers are present.  

# Principal site results  

# Site U1339  

Background and objectives  

The primary objective of drilling at Site U1339 (prospectus Site UMK-4D) was to study high-resolution paleoceanography in the easternmost part of the Bering Sea, a marginal sea expected to exhibit large variations during times of global climate change. Umnak Plateau (Fig. F14) is located off Bristol Bay and is well situated for the study of past changes in surface water conditions, sea ice extent, and associated biological productivity. Today, parts of the relatively warm Alaskan Stream surface water flow into the Bering Sea through Unimak and Amukta passes and hence sea ice is not formed in this region. However, substantial sea ice coverage has been noted during the LGM, when sea level was ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ lower than today, indicating that the influence of relatively warm water from the distal end of the Alaskan Stream was reduced. This may have been because water entering the Bering Sea from the Pacific Ocean through Unimak and Amukta passes was at least partially restricted when sea level dropped; the warm Pacific water could have more easily passed through the deeper passes located in the central and western Aleutians, such as Amchitka Strait (Katsuki and Takahashi, 2005). Thus, monitoring past environmental conditions at Umnak Plateau can provide an understanding of the impact of changes in water exchange between the Pacific and Bering Sea waters. Since these eastern passes are fairly shallow ( ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ and $430\mathrm{~m}$ ), little intermediate or deep water flows out to the Pacific in this region. As such, records from Umnak Plateau should provide us with different information than the western sites, which are closer to deep passes where surface water flow may not have been strongly inhibited by sea level changes and where dense water exchange with the Pacific Ocean is more likely to occur (Tanaka and Takahashi, 2005). To make this west–east comparison, records from the drill site on Umnak Plateau (Site U1339) can be compared to those of Site U1341 (water depth $=2177\;\mathrm{m}$ ) at Bowers Ridge.  

The drill site at Umnak Plateau (Site U1339) is situated on the northwest flank of a section of the plateau that is separated from the main shelf by a canyon (Fig. F15). This location was selected with the assumption that much of the siliciclastic material from the shelf would have been transported into the canyon during sea level lowstands. As such, this site location would have received more pelagic biogenics relative to terrigenous sediments than a site located on the main shelf. There is clear evidence of continuous horizontal reflectors on the seismic profiles (Fig. F16).  

The drill site at Umnak Plateau can also be used to study the impact of subseafloor microbes on biogeochemical fluxes in the highest surface ocean productivity areas of the drill sites in the Bering Sea. Organic-fueled subseafloor respiration and its impact on biogeochemistry in such a highly productive region has not previously been quantified. To do this, drilled sediments from Umnak Plateau were used to determine subseafloor  cell  abundance  and  to  investigate  the  link  between  the  mass  and characteristics of subseafloor microbes and the extent of export productivity from the surface ocean.  

Scholl and Creager (1973) found Pleistocene diatomaceous sediments with ash layers in the uppermost $120\;\mathrm{m}$ at DSDP Sites 184 and 185, both drilled at Umnak Plateau, followed by Pliocene diatomaceous sediments below. They recorded sedimentation rates of ${\sim}67\;\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ . and indicated that the diatomaceous sediments have neritic components, which were likely influenced from the Bristol Bay region. A piston core study from the same general region provided a sedimentation rate of $262\ \mathrm{m/m.y.}$ . (Takahashi, 2005). Thus, prior to drilling the predicted age for the bottom of Site U1339 at $\mathord{\sim}200$ meters below seafloor (mbsf) ranged from the mid-Pleistocene to the Pliocene.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sediments recovered at Site U1339 are a mixture of three components: biogenic, volcaniclastic, and siliciclastic. Other accessory lithologies identified include authigenic dolomite and pyrite. In general, the color of the sediments reflects their lithologic characteristics. Sediment composed of mixed lithologies of diatom silt or diatom ashy silt is dark greenish gray, whereas diatom ooze is olive-gray to olive. Most of the volcaniclastic ash layers are black. Only one lithologic unit spanning the Pleistocene was defined and it was divided into four subunits (Fig. F17). The largest-scale sedimentary features are decimeter- to meter-scale bedded alternations of sediment color and texture reflecting alternations in lithology. Well-preserved lamination caused by alternating millimeter-scale dark and light laminae was mainly observed in five distinct intervals, each ranging from 10 to $40\,\mathrm{cm}$ in thickness. Distinct volcaniclastic layers ranging from a few millimeters to $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ in thickness occur throughout the unit. Some black volcaniclastic layers are normally graded, indicating either time-transgressive fining of grains or redeposition by gravity flows.  

The major sediment component is biogenic and predominantly composed of diatoms with generally good preservation. Diatom frustules hosting pyrite framboids are also observed. Both benthic and planktonic foraminifers are observed, although their abundance levels were low. Thin laminae dominated by foraminifer tests are observed with dominance of benthic foraminifer Bulimina sp., which is characteristic of low oxygen content. Calcareous nannofossils, radiolarians, and sponge spicules are rare. Terrigenous grains, which are common sediment components, are composed of silt-sized quartz and feldspar, clay, mica, and rock fragments. Gravel- to pebble-sized, rounded to angular clasts are interpreted as dropstones delivered by melting sea ice or icebergs. Some pebbles are composed of pumice or obsidian, suggesting a volcanic source. Authigenic dolomite was found in five distinctive intervals, mostly in the upper and lower part of the sedimentary record. It occurs either as dolomite rhombohedra scattered in the sediment or as (semi-) lithified layers $5{-}10\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick. Because of the presence of authigenic carbonates at this site, carbonate-stable isotope measurements are potentially contaminated by the isotopic signature of the overgrowths. However, the presence of authigenic carbonates can be detected and screened out of the isotopic records. Depth variations of the color reflectance (CR) parameters $a^{\star}$ and $\mathfrak{b}^{\star}$ , GRA porosity, and magnetic susceptibility were compared to the lithologic variations. Overall, these four parameters show distinct short-term variability and longer term trends that can be correlated to lithologic variations at both short- and long-term scales. The depth variations of CR parameter $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{b^{\star}}}$ , which reflects the yellowness of the sediment, show a remarkably negative correlation with the GRA data, with lower $\mathbf{b}^{\star}$ values corresponding to denser, more siliciclastic-rich sediments. CR value $a^{\star}$ is tentatively correlated to the concentration of diatom ooze. Changes of magnetic susceptibility with depth mainly reflect volcaniclastic content, and a very good correlation exists between the thickest volcanic ash layers and the highest magnetic susceptibility excursions.  

# Micropaleontology  

In contrast to their calcareous counterparts, siliceous microfossil groups had constant presence and relatively high abundance throughout all sections at this site. All age determinations were achieved with the siliceous microfossil groups (Table T3; Figs. F17, F18). Diatoms provided two important last occurrence (LO) datums of Thalassiosira jouseae $(0.31\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and Proboscia curvirostris $(0.28\;\mathrm{Ma})$ in the middle section of the four holes studied. The most important datums were derived by studying silicoflagellates, despite the fact that their abundances were generally “trace” to “few” with rare instances of “common.” These are the first occurrence (FO) of Distephanus octangulatus $(0.741\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and the LO of Dictyocha subarctios $(0.736\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , respectively. These two datums are considered to occur above the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary $(0.781\,\mathrm{\,Ma})$ . However, without definite paleomagnetic datums of the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary (see “Paleomagnetism” section for detail), the silicoflagellate datums are the only reliable datums at this time. The LO of Distephanus octonarius $(0.244\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , another silicoflagellate datum, provided harmonious age information in concordance with diatoms and radiolarians. Despite their relatively low abundances due to massive occurrences of diatoms in the bulk of samples, radiolarians provided five pertinent datums that span from near the top through the middle part of the drilled sections. These include Lychnocanoma nipponica sakaii $(50\,\mathrm{ka})$ , Amphimelissa setosa $(80{-}100\,\mathrm{ka})$ ,  

Spongodiscus sp. in Ling (1973) (0.28–0.32 Ma), Axoprunum acquilonium (0.25–0.43 Ma), and Stylatractus universus (0.41–51 Ma).  

Because of this site’s proximity to the Bering shelf, particularly during the glacial lowstands, coastal water diatoms including Chaetoceros spores and freshwater diatoms were observed. Furthermore, the relative abundances of the ubiquitous Neodenticula seminae, an indicator species of the Alaskan Stream, fluctuated throughout the sections, indicating change in the Pacific water entry into the Bering Sea. The extent of sea ice–associated diatoms also fluctuated throughout the sections.  

Calcareous nannofossils were either barren or sparse throughout the sections. Reworked specimens of calcareous nannofossils were found in the upper section, indicating transport by IRD or other processes. Planktonic foraminifers were present in all but a few samples. Both planktonic and benthic foraminifers were abundant enough to proceed with more detailed studies such as oxygen and carbon isotopic analyses. Abundant benthic calcareous foraminifers with generally low diversity showed close affinities to those recorded in recent sediments within or near the OMZ in the Sea of Okhotsk. The exceptionally high productivity in surface waters greatly expanded the OMZ.  

Dinoflagellate assemblages were moderate to abundant with relatively low species diversity. They showed heterotrophic protoperidinial dinoflagellates feeding on diatoms. Such assemblages are related to extremely high diatom production. In the upper section, a taxon indicative of the North Water Polynia condition was noted, implying significant sea ice formation.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic analyses indicate that all sediments are likely from the Brunhes Chron (0–780,000 y before present [BP]). However, anomalous NRM intensities along with low or negative inclinations in the same intervals may be due to authigenic growth of greigite related to sulfate reduction or methanogenesis. As such, it is possible that the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary was reached at $\mathord{\sim}180$ mbsf but that the reversal in polar intensity was obscured by the presence of greigite. At this time, it is difficult to say which hypothesis is more likely.  

# Stratigraphic Correlation  

Three holes dedicated to paleoceanographic studies were drilled at this site. Cores were drilled at offset depths in order to obtain a continuous sedimentary section. By comparing fast track GRA density and magnetic susceptibility variations, the cores from different holes can be placed into a continuous stratigraphic framework. An affine table indicating offsets for each core in each hole was constructed (Table T4). A continuous record mainly using Holes U1339C and U1339D was constructed by splicing together the GRA and magnetic susceptibility records; this splice (Table T5) will guide the postcruise sampling strategy designed to generate continuous paleoceanographic records. The splice at Site U1339 is continuous from the mudline to ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF (Fig. F17).  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water samples taken from Hole U1339A at low resolution from 0 to $200\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF and at high resolution from Hole U1339B were analyzed for chlorinity, salinity, alkalinity, DIC, pH, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, ammonium, phosphate, silica, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Mn, B, and Sr. In addition, ethane and methane were analyzed. Methane is detectable throughout, and at ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ , where sulfate is depleted, methane concentrations increase dramatically (Fig. F18). The analyses show that the SMTZ at present is relatively shallow at $8{-}10\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Notably, alkalinity and DIC increase from 3 to 30 mM in the uppermost $10~\mathrm{m}$ , reaching a maximum at ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF (Fig. F18). Solidphase analyses show that calcium carbonate content ranges from 0 to $13.3\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=2.1\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and total organic carbon is 0.47 to $1.83\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=0.98~\mathrm{wt\%}$ .  

# Physical properties  

Whole-round measurements of magnetic susceptibility and GRA bulk density (using the fast track) and magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity (PWV) (using the whole-round multisensor logger [WRMSL] slow track) were made on each core recovered at Site U1339. One thermal conductivity (Tcon) measurement per core was also analyzed. Discrete samples of cores from Holes U1339A and U1339B were taken to analyze moisture, density, porosity, water content, and grain density. Magnetic susceptibility varied downcore, with the highest peaks likely related to volcanic ash layers and cyclical variations likely due to varying amounts of siliciclastics versus diatoms. Such variations in lithology likely contributed to the variations in GRA bulk density and discrete bulk density measurements, which indicate cyclical variations from 1.6 to $1.3\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Porosity, water content, and grain density measurements exhibit an oscillating cyclicity similar to the wet bulk density record and are likely tracking variations in the concentration of biogenic debris—in particular, highly porous diatom frustules—with respect to lower porosity terrigenous sediment with higher grain density. Discrete bulk density measurements increase gradually with depth at a rate of ${\sim}0.1\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}/100\ \mathrm{m}.$ , most likely because of sediment compaction. Compaction likely explains the decrease in porosity downhole from a near-surface value of ${\sim}85\%$ to ${\sim}65\%$ at a depth near $200\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF.  

NGR counts/s varied rhythmically from highs of 25 to 40 counts/s to a low of ${\sim}10$ counts/s, evidently tracking clay mineral–bearing sediment in contrast to sediments with more biogenics. Because the PWV measurements were seriously degraded by expansion of hydrate-released methane gas, the $P$ -wave logger was turned off for all core sections deeper than $\sim\!33\textrm{m}$ CSF. Tcon values ranged widely from a low of ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{W/}$ $(\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{K})$ to $>\!1\,\mathrm{\:W/(m\cdotK)}$ , with lower values presumably reflecting water-rich diatomaceous sections and higher values reflecting abundant terrigenous debris.  

Electrical conductivity to determine formation factor was measured every $10~\mathrm{cm}$ in the working half of the first core of Hole U1339A, then every $20~\mathrm{cm}$ in Cores 323- U1339A-2H and 3H. Sediment conductivity ranges from 1.37 to $3.70~\upmu\mathrm{S/cm}$ . The highest values were recorded in ash layers and formation factor generally increased downhole.  

# Downhole measurements  

By employing the deployed triple combination (triple combo) and the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string combinations, data were recorded below the bottom of the pipe depth. They indicate good hole conditions and only minor excursions from the nominal size of the drill bit. The comparison of the gamma ray and density logs with the NGR and GRA track measurements on cores recovered and with moisture and density (MAD) measurements shows good agreement, which should allow for reliable core-log integration. All logs were referenced to the seafloor depth of $1875\;\mathrm{m}$ wireline log depth below rig floor (WRF) identified during the last pass of the FMS-sonic tool string. Comparison of the gamma ray logs measured during the main pass of the two runs shows an excellent repeatability between the two runs. The resistivity values measured by the electrode spherically focused resistivity (SFLU) measurement were lower than those recorded by induction measurements, probably because of current loss at the electrodes. The higher induction resistivities are closer to values typically measured in deep-sea sediments.  

The display of the high coherence in sonic waveforms used to derive the compressional velocity suggests that despite the closeness of the formation velocity to the sound velocity in the borehole fluid $({\sim}1500\;\mathrm{m/h})$ , the Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) was able to capture compressional wave arrivals and measure a reliable ${\cal{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}$ profile over the entire open interval logged. Additional postcruise processing will, however, be necessary to derive $V_{\mathsf{S}}$ logs from the recorded dipole waveforms.  

The downhole log measurements of bulk density, porosity, and electrical resistivity correlate very well. Variations in sediment composition result in variations of porosity that affect bulk density and resistivity in a similar manner. The measurements also correlate significantly with the gamma ray logs as a result of the overall uniform mineral matrix of the sediments in the interval logged. In particular, the parallel decrease with depth in gamma ray, density, and resistivity from 86 to $102\,\textrm{m}$ wireline log matched depth (below seafloor) (WMSF) is typical of a retrograding fining-upward sequence.  

The downhole variations of gamma ray radioactivity are controlled by the sediment content of naturally occurring radioactive elements (K, U, and Th). The computed gamma ray, or gamma ray without uranium, is a more accurate measure of the clay content than is the total gamma ray, which can be influenced by such factors as organic matter or detrital minerals. The most significant feature in the gamma ray logs is the increase at ${\sim}142\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF, which is associated with an increase in the three radioactive components and a peak in uranium. This increase coincides with the transition from lithologic Subunits ID to IE (diatom ooze and diatom fine ash to diatom ooze). The peak in uranium can be related to the occurrence of dolostones observed in the cores in this interval.  

The downhole third-generation advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) measurements show a range of $3.65^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $23.0\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) to $12.83^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $158.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. These closely fit a linear geothermal gradient of $68.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/$ km. The temperature at the seafloor was $2.1^{\circ}C$ based on the average of the measurements at the mudline during all the APCT-3 deployments. The obtained heat flow— the product of the geothermal gradient by the average thermal conductivity (0.80 W/ $[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ —gives a value of $54.4\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , which is within the range of previous measurement in the area.  

# Sedimentation rates  

The age model for Site U1339 was constructed using biostratigraphic datums (Fig. F19). The datums that were selected to constrain the sedimentation rates were the ones judged to be best resolved (Table T6). The calculations indicate some variability in rates, which range from 22 to $50\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ (Fig. F19).  

# Site U1340  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective of drilling at Site U1340 (prospectus Site BOW-12B) was to study high-resolution Pliocene and Pleistocene paleoceanography in the southernmost part of the Bering Sea at a topographic high on Bowers Ridge (Fig. F20), where relatively good calcium carbonate preservation is expected. Bowers Ridge is well situated to allow study of the past extent of water mass exchange with the Pacific Ocean through the adjacent Aleutian passes such as the Amukta, Amchitka, and Buldir passes. In particular, its location allows examination of the influence of the warm Alaskan Stream water mass entry into this region, which influenced the distribution of past sea ice coverage (Katsuki and Takahashi, 2005). Although productivity in the Bering Sea in general is very high with respect to other parts of the global oceans, the expected productivity at this site was lower than at Site U1339, which has substantially greater influence from the nearby Bering shelf and which was exposed during glacial lowstands. We selected this site at relatively shallow water depth to study physical and chemical changes in upper water mass conditions such as the low dissolved oxygen concentration conditions that caused the formation of laminated sediments at a site on the Bering slope at similar water depths (Cook et al., 2005). The vertical structure of past water masses can be determined by comparing results at this site with those at the other drilling sites on Bowers Ridge (Site U1341, water depth $=2177\mathrm{~m}.$ ; Site U1342, water depth $=837\mathrm{~m~}$ ) (Fig. F20).  

Site U1340 at Bowers Ridge can also be used to study the impact of subseafloor microbes on biogeochemical fluxes in the highest surface ocean productivity areas of the drill sites in the Bering Sea. Samples used to study organic-fueled subseafloor respiration and its impact on biogeochemistry at the highly productive region of the previous Site U1339 were compared to analyses at the Bowers Ridge sites, including Site U1340, although the high-resolution sampling that occurred at Site U1339 was not performed at Site U1340. The Bowers Ridge sediments were used to determine subseafloor cell abundance and to investigate the link between the mass and characteristics of subseafloor microbes and the extent of export productivity from the surface ocean.  

Site U1340 is located on the eastern flank of the southern part of Bowers Ridge (Fig. F20) in a basin ${\sim}10~\mathrm{km}$ east of the ridge crest (Fig. F21). Close-ups of the seismic images in the basin (Figs. F22, F23, F24) indicate that strata dip to the east (Fig. F23). Some shallow sections do not have continuous parallel strata, but most of the rest of the section appears to have continuous features in the seismic images (Figs. F23, F24).  

The basement age and the age of the deeper sediments are unknown, but at DSDP Site 188 on the western flank of Bowers Ridge (Scholl and Creager, 1973) sediments as old as upper Miocene were found. Specifically, Scholl and Creager (1973) found recent to upper Miocene diatom ooze interbedded with silt-rich diatom ooze and diatomaceous silt. They also found calcareous nannofossils in the upper $120\textrm{m}$ and planktonic foraminifers in the upper $300{-}400\,\mathrm{m}$ . In the interval between 580 and 638 mbsf they encountered mudstone. They reported sedimentation rates of ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m/m.}\mathrm{\Omega}$ y. A piston core study from the same general region provided sedimentation rates of $80\;\mathrm{m}/$ m.y. (Takahashi, 2005). Thus, prior to drilling sections ranging from the entire Pleistocene to the Pliocene and possibly Miocene were expected.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sediments recovered at Site U1340 are a mix of biogenic, volcaniclastic, and siliciclastic sediments. Authigenic dolomite also occurred as an accessory sediment type. In general, the color of the sediments reflects their lithologic characteristics. Sediment composed of siliciclastic sediment or mixed lithologies tends to be very dark greenish gray to dark gray, whereas diatom ooze tends to be olive-gray to olive or dark gray. Volcaniclastic ash layers are dark gray to black or shades of light gray to white and, rarely, weak red. Intervals showing soft-sediment deformation were observed between Core 323-U1340A-3H and Section 8H-2.  

Three lithologic units were defined at Site U1340 (Fig. F25). Unit I is composed of alternating beds of diatom ooze and diatom silt with minor amounts of mixed and volcaniclastic sediment from the Pleistocene. The most prominent sedimentary structure in Unit I is soft-sediment deformation of laminated and bedded diatom ooze and diatom silt. Intervals with soft-sediment deformation were observed from Core 323- U1340A-3H to Section 8H-2 and in Cores 11H, 12H, 14H, and 15H; from Cores 323- U1340B-3H to 6H; in Cores 323-U1340C-2H and 3H; and in all cores from Hole U1340D. Folded and tilted bed boundaries are clearly visible in these cores, suggesting the occurrence of synsedimentary slumps as a potential mechanism for the deformation. Distinct volcaniclastic layers ranging in thickness between a few millimeters and 3 cm occur throughout the unit. Volcanic ash is a common secondary or trace lithologic component. A major component of the sediment in Unit I is biogenic and predominantly composed of diatoms with generally good preservation. Diatom frustules hosting pyrite framboids were observed. Terrigenous particles are also a major component in Unit I. The most abundant terrigenous grain types are silt-sized feldspar, quartz, clay, mica, and rock fragments. Some pebbles are composed of basalt and pumice or scoria, indicating a volcanic source. Bioturbation varies from slight to strong throughout all holes and is typically characterized by a mottling defined by color changes. The main lithologies are olive to dark gray diatom ooze and dark gray to dark greenish gray diatom silt with variable amounts of dispersed vitric ash, isolated pebbles, and distinct ash layers as well as bioturbated ash/diatom ooze layers and laminated intervals. The light-colored sediments (olive) tend to contain predominantly biogenic components, whereas the dark-colored sediments (gray) tend to contain subequal proportions of siliciclastic and biogenic components. The volcanic ash layers are typically black, light gray, and, rarely, weak red. Unit II comprises diatom ooze with minor amounts of diatom silt and mixed and volcaniclastic sediment from the Pliocene. Unit II differs from Unit I in having significantly more diatom ooze, less interbedded diatom silt, and fewer laminated intervals. A layer of gravel was recovered at $380\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF from Hole U1340A. This is directly below an interval of frequent deposition of gravel-sized clasts at ${\sim}220{-}360\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. This gravel-rich interval overlaps the base of Unit I and the top of Unit II. Unit III, which is further divided into Subunits IIIA and IIIB, comprises diatom-bearing, sponge-spicule-rich ashy sand; spongespicule-rich diatom ooze; diatom ooze; and minor amounts of volcaniclastic and siliciclastic sediment from the Pliocene in age. Core disturbance was observed in all sections collected in Unit III. The sediment was described as a slurry with water-rich areas at the core surface and along the liners.  

Mixed and siliciclastic lithologies in Unit I correlate well with magnetic susceptibility changes. The increase occurred at ${\sim}260\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CSF},$ dated to around $2.6\;\mathrm{Ma}_{}$ , and may reflect an increase in sea ice- or glacial ice-rafted debris delivered to the site after the onset of large glacial–interglacial cycles. The rounded shape of many of the gravel-sized grains suggests that their source was a coastal environment and therefore favors the hypothesis that they were deposited as a consequence of sea ice rafting. Relatively large clasts interpreted as dropstones were observed most frequently between 360 and $220\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF $({\sim}3.6{-}1.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , and their occurrence overlaps with the onset of increased siliciclastic components, coeval with a subtle increase in GRA. This may reflect the onset of NHG after $3.6\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Mudelsee and Raymo, 2005). The occurrence of extensive intervals with soft-sediment deformation related to slumping is somewhat unexpected because the slope of Bowers Ridge is only slightly inclined at the drill sites. An alternative explanation for the triggering of sediment mass movements could be the seismogenic activity of Bowers Ridge, which is representing a buried subduction zone and is relatively close to the volcanic Aleutian arc. Another possibility could be water loss during mineral phase changes in deeper sediments, which may result in less cohesive sediment packages prone to deformation. The primarily biogenic components of Unit II and Subunit IIIB may reflect warmer, highly productive Pliocene conditions or a higher sea level.  

# Micropaleontology  

Core catcher (CC) samples from Site U1340 are dominated by diatom microfossil assemblages with high diversity. Seventeen datums have been identified in Hole U1340A (Table T7; Fig. F26). Sections 323-U1340A-1H-CC to approximately 34H-CC exhibit a broadly linear sedimentation rate. Thereafter, the sedimentation rate appears to increase drastically, with the last three datums all giving the same age of $3.8-$ $4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Siliceous microfossils show consistent occurrences throughout the section and are mainly composed of high-latitude pelagic species, indicating changes to surface water productivity. Calcareous microfossils are mostly confined to the top of the section above Section 323-U1340A-23H-CC for nannofossils and 31H-CC for foraminifers. Reworked calcareous nannofossil specimens, mostly of Miocene and Paleogene age, were found in some samples. The planktonic foraminifer fauna does not change radically throughout the Pleistocene (above $200\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF}$ ), and it is dominated by the subpolar–polar species Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) together with the subpolar species Globigerina bulloides, Globigerina umbilicata, and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (dextral). Benthic foraminifers are largely characteristic of those found within or near the OMZ in high-latitude regions. Dinoflagellates consistently occur throughout the section, indicating changes to the productivity and ice cover of the surface waters.  

Over 40 species of benthic foraminifers recovered in 83 samples resemble species from oxygen-depleted zones on Umnak Plateau and elsewhere. Abundance and diversity fell markedly below $282.17\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF in Hole U1340A, with samples either barren or consisting of a monospecific agglutinated assemblage. Core catcher samples were checked for ostracodes, but no specimens were found.  

Diatoms are the dominant microfossil in all holes and they show good preservation throughout. The LOs of Proboscia curvirostris, Thalassiosira jouseae, and Proboscia barboi were identified at $37.60\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF for all three species, giving a composite estimated age of $0.3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ based on the result from a piston core from Site ES on the northern Emperor Seamount. The age of $0.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ was assigned at $161.24\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF by the last common occurrence (LCO) of Actinocyclus oculatus, which is followed by the first common occurrence (FCO) of Proboscia curvirostris at $1.8\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . The LCO of Neodenticula koizumii was determined at Section 323-U1340A-25H-CC, giving an age of 2.1 Ma. Neodenticula koizumii and Neodenticula kamtschatica occur jointly between Sections 323-U1340A-46X  

CC and 57X-CC, corresponding to North Pacific Diatom (NPD) Zone 8 $(2.7–3.9\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . The FO of Neodenticula koizumii and the dominance of Neodenticula kamtschatica above Section 323-U1240A-56X-CC defines this zone as NPD Zone 7Bb $(3.9\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . Diatom assemblages are mainly composed of pelagic species throughout the Pleistocene and upper Pliocene. Several significant abundance peaks of a high-productivity indicator occur throughout the upper and lower Pliocene. In general, few coastal water diatoms, including Chaetoceros spores, or freshwater diatoms were observed below the upper Pleistocene, which may be explained by the distant location of this site to continental influence.  

Despite the low abundances of silicoflagellates and ebridians, two LOs were obtained. The LO of Dc. subarctios $(0.74\;\mathrm{Ma})$ fits conformably with those of other siliceous microfossils as well as that of paleomagnetism. The LO of Ebriopsis antiqua antiqua (2.47– $2.48\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) is placed at $305.47\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF.  

Consistently abundant to common radiolarians with good to moderate preservation occurred in the upper interval (above ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{m}$ ), whereas radiolarians with few abundances and moderate to poor preservation occurred in the lower interval (below $\mathord{\sim}200$ m). The radiolarian stratigraphy spans from the Botryostrobus aquilonaris Zone (upper Quaternary) to the Dictyophimus bullatus Zone (middle Pliocene). A missing Stylatractus universus Zone (between 0.4 and $0.9\mathrm{~Ma}$ ) is due to the absence of S. universus. Eleven radiolarian datums derived in the subarctic Pacific were identified at this site.  

All samples contain poorly to well-preserved palynomorphs. The concentration of terrestrial palynomorphs is low to moderate in most samples. Freshwater palynomorphs (Pediastrum, Botryococcus, and tintinides) occur only in the upper part of the sequence from 42 to $186\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Reworked palynomorphs are generally accompanied by a high number of wood microfragments. Very abundant dinoflagellate cysts occur only in the uppermost $200\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF and lower abundance occurs below. The LO of Filisphaera filifera $\mathrm{|1.7\,Ma}\rangle$ ) was determined at $216\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. The Gonyaulacale Operculodinium centrocarpum co-dominates the assemblage together with Brigantedinium spp. in the core catcher samples from the uppermost cores. O. centrocarpum is closely related to seasonal sea ice cover. All accompanying taxa except extinct species (Filisphaera filifera and Batiacasphaera minuta) are known to be abundant in polar and circumpolar regions.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The inclinations measured in Site U1340 sediments average almost $70^{\circ}$ over the entire depth range of the cores. The site axial dipole inclination is $\sim\!72^{\circ}$ . Several distinct intervals of reversed inclinations are interpreted to be polarity epochs. The declinations, after correction with the FlexIt tool to orient the declination data with North, suggest that there are multiple polarity intervals in the uppermost 17 cores from Hole U1340A; however, the FlexIt corrections are too poor to be of much detailed use in assigning polarity boundaries. The inclinations provide an initial guide to polarity zonation in Hole U1340A; we could discern the Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, and Gauss normal polarity chrons (Fig. F25). Polarity boundaries and paleontological age estimates are generally in agreement (Fig. F26).  

The NRM intensities largely remain at the same level throughout most of Hole U1340A. The NRM and Chi intensities vary over more than an order of magnitude on a meter scale. We interpret this to stem mostly from variable flux of detrital sediment versus biogenic sediment flux (mostly diatoms at this site). The large changes in NRM intensity also appear to be associated with notable detrital (and presumably magnetic) grain size changes. Both of these variations make the relative paleointensity estimates, determined by normalizing the cleaned NRM $(20~\mathrm{~mT)}$ by magnetic susceptibility, questionable in interpretation. The relative paleointensity variability is quite large, but most of it is strongly correlated with NRM and magnetic susceptibility variability and is probably not due mostly to geomagnetic field variability. As at our last site, we see no notable evidence for the presence of magnetic field excursions in any of the cores.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

The composite depth scale and splice at Site U1340 is complete from 0.0 to $47.7\textrm{m}$ CCSF-A (Tables T8, T9). This splice is tentative because of some evidence for soft-sediment deformation in some of the cores based on observed sedimentary structures, data features that do not appear to correlate between holes, and in some cases sections that appear repeat within a single hole. An interval that contains a distinctive pink ash appears to be present three times in Hole U1340C: twice in Core 323-U1340C-2H and once in Core 3H. This appearance of the same sedimentary interval at different subseafloor depths as well as the replication of a section within a single hole is consistent with visual evidence for tilted beds and nonconformable surfaces. We suggest that sediment deformation has produced thickened and noncorrelative intervals in the depth interval from $\mathord{\sim}20$ to ${\sim}45\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A in Holes U1340B and U1340C and perhaps also in Holes U1340A and U1340D. We are not confident that the full sedimentary sequence is represented in the composite splice. We tentatively splice Core 323- U1340B-4H as the bottom interval of the splice, which includes the least disturbed intervals through the interval of inferred slumping. Affine growth factors in the spliced interval have values of 1.14 in Hole U1340A and 1.18 in Hole U1340B, which are within the normal range typical of many drill sites. The remaining cores at Site U1340 are not tied to the splice but are appended to the bottom of the splice with a constant affine value of 7.31.  

# Geochemistry  

In Hole U1340B, nine interstitial water samples ranging from 2.9 to $53.3\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF were retrieved by the whole-round squeezing technique. Interstitial water chloride concentrations varied between 528 and $570\;\mathrm{mM}$ , but downhole salinity remained constant at 36. Alkalinity increased from 2.9 to $18~\mathrm{m}$ CSF, whereas only a subtle increase was seen below. DIC showed a similar trend as alkalinity with a maximum concentration at $42.3\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. pH remained unchanged throughout, averaging 7.7. The dissolved sulfate concentrations slightly decreased. Hydrogen sulfide was detected at low concentrations, averaging $4.4\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . Ammonium concentrations increased as depth increased. Phosphate concentrations gradually increased throughout the uppermost ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{m}$ , followed by a gradual decrease to $53\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF.  

Methane was the only hydrocarbon gas detected in Holes U1340A and U1340B. Concentrations of methane in Holes U1340A and U1340B ranged from 0 to 3.1 ppmv and from 2.2 to 6.6 ppmv, respectively. Ethane and other volatile hydrocarbons were not detected. Fourteen core catchers from Hole U1340A were used for the preliminary analysis of solid-phase total inorganic carbon (TIC), TOC, total nitrogen, and total sulfur. Calcium carbonate contents in Hole U1340A ranged from 0 to $3.6\:\mathrm{wt\%}$ . A part of increased $C a C O_{3}$ contents between 300 and $400\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF corresponds to the intervals where authigenic dolomite and calcite were observed in sediments. Because of the presence of authigenic carbonates at this site, carbonate-stable isotope measurements are potentially contaminated by the isotopic signature of the overgrowths. However, the presence of authigenic carbonates can be detected and screened out of the isotopic records. TOC and total nitrogen contents range from 0.25 to $1.19\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ and from 0.02 to $0.09\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively. TOC decreased below $400\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Total sulfur contents ranged from 0.09 to $0.42~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Undetectable methane, deep $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ penetration, and low values of DIC, alkalinity, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}+$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ suggest extremely low microbial activity compared to Site U1339 despite similar TOC content.  

# Microbiology  

Samples for abundance of prokaryotes were collected adjacent to interstitial water whole-rounds at the same resolution. Samples were fixed for further shore-based analyses.  

# Physical properties  

Cores from all holes were placed on the fast or Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) track and scanned for magnetic susceptibility and GRA bulk density and on the WRMSL for GRA, magnetic susceptibility, and $P_{\cdot}$ -wave scanning. Because of noisy data, noncontact resistivity values were not recorded. $P$ -wave velocity and sediment shear strength measurements were not determined on working section halves. Magnetic susceptibility values spike irregularly, with values ranging from 500 to 1300 SI units in the uppermost $250\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ , but values were relatively low and invariant below ${\sim}250\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF until $525\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ , when they increased sharply to above 1000 SI units, registering a thick tephra unit. Bulk density determinations reveal high excursions and an apparent rhythmic pattern of higher values alternating with lower ones. The average reading in the tephra-bearing diatom silt of Unit I (surface to ${\sim}360\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF}$ ) is ${\sim}1.4$ $\mathrm{{g}/\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}}$ . Within Unit I, bulk density decreases with depth to $\sim\!1.38\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at ${\sim}360\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Below ${\sim}384\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF and a shift to XCB coring, values lowered additionally to ${\sim}1.32\,\mathrm{g}/$ $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . In Hole U1340A, NGR counts/s, which principally reflect clay mineral abundance, decrease with depth from near-surface readings averaging $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s to ${\sim}10$ counts/s at ${\sim}380\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF and below. Presumably the downhole decrease in NGR counts reflects increasing relative abundance of siliceous biogenic tests and debris of lithologic Unit II.  

The $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocity profile for Hole U1340A is variable but generally increases from a near-surface velocity of ${\sim}1.52$ to ${\sim}1.55\,\mathrm{km/s}$ at ${\sim}280\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF. This section corresponds to lithologic Unit I. In the underlying Unit $\mathrm{II}_{.}$ , and in particular below the transition from APC to XCB coring at ${\sim}384\mathrm{~m~CSF},$ , average $P_{\cdot}$ -wave readings exhibit only a subtle continuation of a downsection increase in velocity of ${\sim}10~\mathrm{m/s}$ (from ${\sim}1.55$ to ${\sim}1.56$ ${\mathrm{km}}/s)$ at the bottom of Hole U1340A $\mathrm{~\sim~}604\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ ), possibly because the diatomaceous ooze section of Unit II that included tephra beds is mechanically stronger and less yielding to compaction than the overlying diatomaceous silt beds of lithologic Unit I.  

The depth distribution of MAD wet bulk density is similar to that traced by the WRMSL GRA sensor. The MAD profile documents a slight downhole trend of decreasing density from ${\sim}1.42\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ near the seafloor to ${\sim}1.40\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at ${\sim}360\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. Below this depth, which marks a switch to XCB drilling and a ${\sim}25\mathrm{~m~}$ thick section of poor core recovery $[\sim\!360$ to $384\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ ), a low average density of ${\sim}1.32\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ is recorded. However, bulk density increases farther downhole to ${\sim}1.4\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the bottom of Hole U1340A at ${\sim}604\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. Perhaps a water-rich and partially load-bearing section signaled by the recovery of gravelly and sandy beds in the upper part of lithologic Unit II separates the upper decreasing and lower increasing trends in bulk density.  

Porosity and water content profiles in Hole U1340A are similar and exhibit three contrasting trends. For porosity, the upper trend from seafloor to $\sim\!350\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}$ displays an average value near $74\%$ that remains virtually constant with depth. The middle trend, which begins below the transition from APC to XCB drilling at ${\sim}384\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF and the zone of poor recovery from $\mathord{\sim}360$ to $384\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}_{\l}$ , documents a shift to a higher average porosity value near $80\%$ , below which the average decreases progressively to ${\sim}66\%$ at ${\sim}550\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Porosity measurements decrease to ${\sim}75\%$ at the base of Hole U1340A at ${\sim}604\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF (Fig. F22). Hydraulically, the middle porosity sections appear to be separated from the upper ones by a permeability barrier in the zone of poor core recovery between $\sim\!360$ and $384\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}.$ This inferred barrier occurs at the level of a gravel-bearing sequence within the diatom ooze section of lithologic Unit II. Isolation of the middle trend from the basal one is coincident with lithologic Unit III, a coarse ashy layer overlying the diatom ooze of Unit IV.  

The average grain density decreases downsection from near-surface values of ${\sim}2.61\;\mathrm{g}/$ $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to ${\sim}2.5~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the bottom of Hole U1340A at ${\sim}604\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. Wide excursions, some of which are so low $(<\!1.5{\mathrm{~g/cm}}^{3})$ or high $(>\!2.9\mathrm{~g/cm}^{3})$ that measuring error is suspected, occur about the mean, which is ${\sim}2.45~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The downsection decreasing values appear to reflect an increase in biogenic silica (chiefly diatom frustules) with respect to terrigenous mineral debris and tephra.  

# Downhole measurements  

The measured temperatures ranged from $5.67^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $70.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF to $9.79^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $165.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and they closely fit a linear geothermal gradient of $43.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . The temperature at the seafloor was $2.8^{\circ}C$ based on the average of the measurements at the mudline during all the APCT-3 deployments. A simple estimate of the heat flow can be obtained from the product of the geothermal gradient by the average thermal conductivity $(0.851\ \mathrm{W/[m\cdotK]})$ , which gives a value of $36.9\,\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , within the range of previous measurement in the area. Alternatively, if the thermal regime is purely conductive, then the resulting linear fit of the temperature gives a slightly higher heat flow value of $37.8\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

# Sedimentation rates  

Sedimentation rates in the upper Pleistocene section appear to be $13{-}17\ \mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . (Fig. F26; Table T10). However, below ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF there is evidence of soft-sediment deformation, which could have caused postdepositional thickening of the section. From $\sim\!150\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}$ to ${\sim}330\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF},$ sedimentary structures indicative of deformation were almost completely absent and the sedimentation rate was $15{-}24\ \mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . Below $330\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF to ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF the sedimentation rate was as high as $32\,\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . From ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF to the bottom of the hole the sedimentation rates appeared to be quite low $({\sim}4~\mathrm{cm}/$ k.y.)  

# Site U1341  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective of drilling at Site U1341 (prospectus Site BOW-14B) was to study high-resolution Pliocene–Pleistocene paleoceanography in the southern part of the Bering Sea at a western flank location of Bowers Ridge. Previous DSDP coring (Site 188) and other piston core studies in the region documented relatively high sedimentation rates of $100{-}138\ \mathrm{m/m.y.}$ , respectively, and the presence of appropriate microfossils for paleoceanographic studies. Bowers Ridge is well situated to allow study of the past extent of water mass exchange with the Pacific Ocean through the adjacent Aleutian passes such as Amukta, Amchitka, and Buldir passes. In particular, its location allows for examination of the influence of the warm Alaskan Stream water mass entry into this region and presumable impact the distribution of past sea ice coverage. Although the productivity in the Bering Sea in general is very high with respect to other parts of the global oceans (Takahashi et al., 2002), the expected productivity at this site is lower than at Site U1339, which experienced substantially greater influence from the adjacent Bering shelf, which was subaerially exposed during the glacial low sea level stands. Drilling at this site—located at a relatively deep water depth of 2177 m—provides us with past intermediate water conditions, including chemical compositions. For example, this site is located just below the modern dissolved OMZ, which causes the formation of laminated sediments. Slight fluctuations in the intensity or depth of the OMZ should be captured by proxy records of past oxygenation measured at this site and compared to other, shallower sites. This site and the shallower drill sites at Bowers Ridge (Site U1340, water depth $=1295\mathrm{~m~}$ ; Site U1342, water depth $=$ $819\;\mathrm{m})$ ) will be used to compare the vertical extent of water mass conditions.  

This drill site at Bowers Ridge also allowed for study of the impact of subseafloor microbes on biogeochemical fluxes in the highest surface ocean productivity areas of the drill sites in the Bering Sea. Organic-fueled subseafloor respiration and its impact on biogeochemistry in such a highly productive region has not previously been quantified. To do this, sediments drilled at Bowers Ridge were used to determine subseafloor cell abundances and then subjected to intensive geochemical analysis to investigate the link between the mass and characteristics of subseafloor microbes and the extent of export productivity from the surface ocean.  

Site U1341 is located on the western flank of the central part of Bowers Ridge (Fig. F20) in a depression (Fig. F27) ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the ridge crest. Close-ups of the seismic images in the basin (Figs. F27, F28, F29, F30) indicate that strata dip gently to the west (Figs. F27, F29). Some shallow sections do not have continuous parallel strata, but most of the rest of the section appears to have continuous features in the seismic images (Figs. F29, F30). The basement age and the age of the deeper sediments are unknown, but at DSDP Site 188 on the western flank of Bowers Ridge (Scholl and Creager, 1973) sediments as old as upper Miocene were found. Specifically, Scholl and Creager (1973) found recent to upper Miocene diatomaceous silt as well as diatom ooze interbedded with silt-rich diatom ooze. They also found calcareous nannofossils in the uppermost $120\;\mathrm{m}$ and planktonic foraminifers in the uppermost $300{-}400~\mathrm{m}$ . In the interval between 580 and $638\mathrm{~m~}$ they encountered mudstone. They reported sedimentation rates of ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ . A piston core study from the same general region provided a sedimentation rate of $138\;\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ (Takahashi, 2005), permitting the study of high-resolution paleoceanography. Thus, prior to drilling, recovery of Pleistocene to Pliocene sections was expected.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Three holes were drilled at Site U1341; the deepest, Hole U1341B, reached $604.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. The sediments recovered are a mix of biogenic and siliciclastic sediments, whereas volcaniclastic material was of minor importance, perhaps reflecting the more distal location of Site U1341 to the Aleutian arc. The most abundant terrigenous grain types are silt-sized feldspar, quartz, clay, mica, and rock fragments. Some pebbles are composed of basalt, pumice, or scoria, indicating a volcanic source. Dolostones and micrometer-scale crystals of dolomite occur in high concentrations at various depths but particularly at the bottom of Hole U1341B. Authigenic carbonate patches, nodules, and layers are light olive-gray and olive-gray and often characterized by a granular texture and a stronger induration than the surrounding sediments. Because of the presence of authigenic carbonates, carbonate-stable isotope measurements in sediments from this and other sites where authigenic carbonates occur are potentially contaminated by the isotopic signature of the overgrowths. However, the presence of authigenic carbonates can be detected and screened out of the isotopic records. Sediment composed of siliciclastic sediment or mixed lithologies tends to be very dark greenish gray to dark gray, whereas diatom ooze tends to be dark gray to olive-gray to light olive. Boundaries between different sediment colors and/or lithologies are dominantly gradational and bioturbated, but occasional sharp contacts occur as well. Sharp contacts are occasionally coeval with distinct changes in magnetic susceptibility, with higher values corresponding to mixed biogenic-siliciclastic sediments and lower values corresponding to diatom ooze. Intervals with thin, distinct parallel laminations were relatively rare and confined to the upper part of the record $_{\mathrm{~0-20~m~}}$ CSF). At lower depths, thickly laminated to thinly bedded material with wavy boundaries occurred more frequently. Site U1341 sediments are indicative of low oxygen conditions, as implied by the decrease in the benthic foraminifer diversity index below $200\;\mathrm{m}$ and by the occurrence of laminated intervals throughout the cores. Also, today an OMZ impinges on parts of the western Bowers Ridge.  

Two lithologic units were defined at Site U1341 by a change from alternating diatom silt, diatom clay, and diatom ooze to solely diatom ooze (Fig. F31). The boundary between the two units, dated at $1.6\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , is paralleled by a significant change in the intensity of the magnetic susceptibility record ( $208\,\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ in Hole U1341B), in the abundances of calcareous tests, and in interstitial water pH and Ca values. The two units are further divided into Subunits IA to ID and Subunits IIA to IIE, respectively.  

Whole-round density (GRA) (Fig. F31) correlates well with the abundance of diatoms recorded in smear slide data, with a high percentage of diatoms correlating with low GRA values and low siliciclastic components. Diatom ooze may reflect interglacial conditions, whereas mixed diatom-siliciclastic lithologies may reflect glacial conditions. This is consistent with the pattern of biogenic opal MARs observed in piston cores from the Bering Sea. Interestingly, sediment intervals rich in nannofossils were observed at this site.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Core catcher samples from Site U1341 are dominated by highly diverse diatoms together with radiolarian, calcareous nannofossil, foraminiferal, and organic-walled microfossils with medium to high diversity and preservation ranging from moderate to very good. Biostratigraphic datums are derived from diatom, radiolarian, dinoflagellate, ebridian, silicoflagellate, and calcareous nannofossil bioevents and show that Site U1341 contains early Pliocene to Pleistocene sediments (Table T11; Fig. F31). However, the presence of early Pliocene species indicates that some reworking has occurred within the uppermost $\sim\!20\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

Cores from Holes U1341A and U1341B exhibit a broadly linear sedimentation rate. Siliceous microfossils show consistent occurrences throughout the section and are mainly composed of high-latitude pelagic species, indicating changes to surface water productivity. Calcareous microfossils are mostly confined to the top of sections from cores at ${\sim}250\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A for nannofossils and $280\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A for planktonic foraminifers. Thereafter, only sporadic occurrences of calcareous fossils and calcareous cemented agglutinated foraminifers are detected, which may be linked to changes in preservation. Benthic foraminifers are largely characteristic of those found within or near the OMZ in high-latitude regions. Dinoflagellates consistently occur throughout the section, indicating changes to the productivity and ice cover of the surface waters.  

Calcareous foraminifers and nannofossils show greatest preservation in the upper part of the section from ${\sim}240\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A. This broadly coincides with the greatest abundances of sea ice diatoms and radiolarians living in cold and oxygen-rich intermediate water masses. As the preservation of carbonate in deep-sea sediments is hindered by high productivity and associated low oxygen in the bottom waters, productivity may have been reduced by a direct seasonal sea ice coverage and an enhanced stratification. Sea ice diatoms, intermediate water–dwelling radiolarians, and calcite preservation all increase markedly again at ${\sim}110\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A.  

The first occurrence datum of Emiliania huxleyi at $0.29\;\mathrm{Ma}$ provided the zonal assignment of calcareous nannofossil Zone NN21 in the upper section of this site. Calcareous nannofossil Zone NN20 and the top of calcareous nannofossil Zone NN19 can only be well constrained in Hole U1341C, establishing an age older than $0.44\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The late Pleistocene fauna at Site U1341 is dominated by Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) and reflects late Pleistocene cooling. Additional fauna are the subpolar  species  Globigerina  bulloides,  Globigerina  umbilicata,  and  Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (dextral), which appear in low numbers. Around 2.5 Ma only the subpolar species are present. Around 60 species of benthic foraminifers were recovered in 140 samples from three holes at this site. Assemblages in the top of the section from Sample 323-U1341B-11H-CC are of relatively high diversity and abundance and show affinities to assemblages within or near the OMZ in the Sea of Okhotsk and also more common deepwater Pacific Ocean species. In the remainder of the holes foraminifers become less abundant and the agglutinated species Eggerella bradyi and Martinottiella communis become more important components of the assemblages.  

Cores above $41.2\textrm{m}$ CSF in Hole U1341A are assigned to the Neodenticula seminae Zone ( $.0.3\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and younger). This datum was closely matched in Hole U1341B at 37.7 m CSF. The following age of $0.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ in Hole U1341A is defined by the LCO of Actinocyclus oculatus at $79.6\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}.$ The top of the A. oculatus Zone is constrained by the LCO of Neodenticula koizumii $[1.7\pm0.1\ \mathrm{Ma}]$ ). The LCO of Neodenticula kamtschatica at 366.2 m CSF in Hole U1341B defines the base of the next biostratigraphic zone at $2.7\pm0.1$ Ma. The age of $3.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ is assigned between 458.3 and $458.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF by the FO of $N.$ . koizumii.  

The LO of silicoflagellate Dictyocha subarctios was found between 50.95 and $60.41\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF in Hole U1341A. The LO of ebridian Ammodochium rectangulare, with the age of $1.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , was assigned to 233.21–241.4 m CSF in Hole U1341A and $228.52–238.11\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF in Hole U1341B. The LO of ebridian Ebriopsis antiqua antiqua was found between 328.09 and $332.81\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF in Hole U1341A and between 325.83 and $335.28\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF in Hole U1341B. The LO of silicoflagellate Distephanus jimlingii lies between 332.71 and $342.26\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF in Hole U1341A and between 335.18 and $345.78\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF in Hole U1341B. Silicoflagellate assemblages were mainly composed of Distephanus speculum, Distephanus medianoctisol, and Distephanus octonarius in most core catcher samples in both holes.  

The radiolarian stratigraphy at Site U1341 spans from the Botryostrobus aquilonaris Zone (upper Quaternary) to the Dictyophimus bullatus Zone (middle Pliocene) in the subarctic Pacific. At the bottom of Hole U1341B, the LO of Dictyophimus bullatus (3.8– $4.0\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) is identified by the occurrence of several specimens of the species. Changes in abundances of Cycladophora davisiana intermediate water–dwelling species showed antiphase patterns with abundances of calcareous microfossils (calcareous nannoplanktons and planktonic foraminifers) in each hole of Site U1341. This suggests the relationship between intermediate water formation in the subarctic Pacific and carbonate preservation. Cycladophora sakaii is thought to be an ancestor species of Cycladophora davisiana. Occurrences of Cycladophora sakaii were very low at Site U1340 (water depth $=\sim\!1300\mathrm{~m}$ ). On the other hand, Cycladophora sakaii was consistently found below the $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ interval at Site U1341 (water depth $=\sim\!2200\mathrm{~m~}$ ), implying Cycladophora sakaii dwelled mainly in deep water below $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth.  

The polar and subpolar dinoflagellate taxa Islandinium minutum, Operculodinium centrocarpum (arctic morphotype), and Impagidinium pallidum—which are known to be abundant in regions where sea ice cover occurs up to 12 months per year and winter sea-surface temperature is $-0^{\circ}C.$ —occur only in the upper part of the sequence starting at ${\sim}371\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Below $300\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF the diversity decreases and the assemblages are dominated by the Protoperidinial Brigantedinium spp. and Trinovantedinium variabile or by the extinct species Filisphaera filifera. T. variabile appears below $300\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A and dominates the assemblage of Sample 323-U1341A-60X-CC.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Archive halves of all APC cores recovered at Site U1341 were measured on the threeaxis cryogenic magnetometer at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals. NRM was measured before (NRM step) and/or after stepwise alternating-field (AF) demagnetization (demagnetization step) in peak fields of up to $20\;\mathrm{mT}.$ Cores 323-U1341A-1H through 12H and Sections 323-U1341C-5H-3 through 11H-5 were measured at NRM step and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step; other cores from Site U1341 were measured only at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step to maintain core flow. The obtained inclinations average nearly $70^{\circ}$ over the entire depth range of the cores, whereas the site axial dipole inclination is $\sim\!72^{\circ}$ . The inclinations show several distinct intervals of reversed inclinations that we interpret to be polarity epochs (Table T11; Fig. F31). The declinations, after correction with the FlexIt tool to orient the declination data with North, suggest that there are multiple polarity intervals in the uppermost 17 cores in Holes U1341A and U1341B. The FlexIt tool appears to show the declination change of $\mathord{\sim}180^{\circ}$ at the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary in Hole U1341A but it does not seem to identify older polarity changes (Jaramillo onset or termination) or the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary in Hole U1341B. Within the Matuyama reversed polarity interval, approximately a dozen previously identified excursions are discernible. Relative paleointensity variations (Chi or INT/Ms) show good correlation with benthic foraminifer diversity related to dissolved oxygen contents of the bottom waters. This indicates that extensive reducing conditions near the sediment/water interface, especially in the lower half of the hole, were responsible for the degradation of paleointensity.  

# Geochemistry  

Undetectable methane, deep $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ penetration, and low values of DIC, alkalinity, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ suggest low present-day microbial activity compared to Site U1339 despite similar TOC contents (Fig. F32). Preliminary model estimates based on the measured DIC profiles suggest that microbial respiration at Site U1341 in the uppermost $30\,\mathrm{m}$ is $\sim\!20\%$ of the activity estimated for Site U1339. This difference may partly be attributed to differences in sedimentation rates. The major metabolic pathway in the sections studied is organoclastic sulfate reduction, and according to the DIC, alkalinity, and sulfate profiles this process is mainly confined to the upper $30\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The most striking feature of Site U1341 is the unusual shape of the DIC, alkalinity, and phosphate profiles as well the pattern of the $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ profile (Fig. F32). DIC, phosphate, and alkalinity profiles indicate either nonsteady state caused by recent changes in microbial activity or unusually high net consumption of DIC and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ in strata below $50\;\mathrm{m}$ . The $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ profile suggests a curiously high net consumption in the $300-$ $400\,\mathrm{m}$ depth interval despite the lack of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and the presence of a presumable, rather refractory, organic carbon pool. It is possible that the interstitial water chemistry still to a large extent shows the overprint by past events such as sulfate removal by extreme high rates of organic matter mineralization during high productivity periods. The present-state interstitial water chemistry thus reflects the transition toward a new steady state.  

# Microbiology  

Seventy-three microbiological samples were collected adjacent to interstitial water whole-rounds for postcruise analyses for abundance of prokaryotes.  

# Physical properties  

The uppermost ${\sim}210\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF of the sediment section at Site U1341 exhibits rapid single-point excursions to readings ${>}200{-}400\ \mathrm{SI}$ units of whole-core magnetic susceptibility measurements. Below this depth magnetic susceptibility readings are subdued and rapid deflections to values ${>}100$ SI units are uncommon except at ${\sim}575\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF, where a broad band of high susceptibility occurs between 565 and $575\mathrm{~m}$ CSF. The upper section of rapidly varying and high values is coincident with lithologic Unit I. Although ash layers occur in this unit, they are equally abundant in the underlying Unit II, which displays only background variations in readings. The contrast in the profiles of magnetic susceptibility readings between Units I and II is thought to reflect the occurrence in the diatom silt of Unit I of presently unidentified alteration products having magnetic susceptibility properties.  

The GRA sensor records a trend of slightly decreasing average values of wet bulk density from a near-surface reading of ${\sim}1.35~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to ${\sim}1.32\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the base of Hole U1341B at ${\sim}605\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF (Fig. F31). At ${\sim}220\mathrm{~m~CSF},$ , which is below the transition from Unit I to Unit II, a discernible but small shift to lower density near ${\sim}125~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ is evident. The entire vertical profile of bulk density undulates broadly from average values of ${\sim}1.30\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to ${\sim}1.45\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The wavelength of fluctuations narrows downhole. Measurement of $P$ -wave velocity by the slow track WRMSL documents a downhole trend of increasing velocity. The gradient of average $P\cdot$ -wave velocity values ranges from ${\sim}1.51\,\mathrm{km/s}$ for near-surface sediment to ${\sim}1.56\,\mathrm{km/s}$ at the base of the hole at 605 m CSF. A slight shift to lower readings $(0.02\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s})$ appears to occur across the transition from lithologic Unit I to Unit II. The low overall gradient in downhole velocity, which is estimated at only $0.08\ \mathrm{km/s/km}$ , demonstrates the ability of diatomaceous sediment to resist compaction.  

Downhole NGR readings show spiking to high values ${>}40$ counts/s above an undulatory and generally decreasing trend of values from near-surface averages of ${\sim}15$ counts/s to less than ${\sim}5$ counts/s at the base of Hole U1341B (Fig. F31). A shift to slightly lower values is just perceptible near the boundary between Units I and II. The implication of the overall decreasing trend and broad superimposed oscillations is that the clay mineral content decreases irregularly downhole, an interpretation that is consistent with the decreasing terrigenous content of the drilled section from the diatom silt of Unit I to the dominantly siliceous ooze of Unit II.  

The MAD downhole trend clearly reveals the contrasting density characteristics of the diatom silt of lithologic Unit I and the siliceous microfossil ooze of Unit II. The sediment in Unit I shows a higher fluctuation in values ranging from 1.62 to $1.2~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ superimposed on a perceptible but slight increase with depth to the unit’s boundary with underlying Unit II. The lower overall bulk density of Unit II appears to reflect a higher concentration of low-density siliceous microfossils than that found in the diatom silt of overlying Unit I. Just beneath the surface, porosity values average ${\sim}80\%$ and the corresponding water content is ${\sim}60\%$ . At the bottom of Hole U1341B water content decreases only slightly to ${\sim}58\%$ and, correspondingly, porosity decreases to ${\sim}75\%$ . Similar to the depth profiles of most other physical properties, the downhole distribution of sediment porosity exhibits undulations or excursions to higher and lower values. The downhole variation in grain density is prominently offset, from an average density of $\sim\!2.39\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to $2.23\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the boundary between Units I and II. The average density also decreases with depth from a near-surface value of ${\sim}2.50~\mathrm{g/}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to as low as $2.10\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the base of Hole U1341B. These trends are interpreted as tracking the downhole increase in relative abundance of low-density diatoms. The depth distribution of thermal conductivity decreases overall from a near-surface value of $0.85\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{K}})$ to $0.80\:\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ at the base of Hole U1341B. This profile thus parallels the downhole decreasing values of most other physical properties measured on cores recovered in Hole U1341B.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

The composite depth scale and splice at Site U1341 is constructed from 0.0 to 374.40 m CCSF-A (Tables T12, T13). The splice consists of one continuous splice from the mudline to $141.30\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A and two appended “floating” splices, the first from 141.3 to $326.43\:\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A and the second from 326.44 to 374.40 m CCSF-A. The continuous splice ranges from the top of Core 323-U1341A-1H to Section 323-U1341B14H-7, $88\;\mathrm{cm}$ . The first floating splice ranges from Section 323-U1341B-15H-1, $0\,\mathrm{cm}$ , to Section 323-U1341A-34H-7, $64\;\mathrm{cm}$ . The second floating splice ranges from Section 323-U1341A-35H-1, $\boldsymbol{0}\,\mathrm{cm}$ , to the base of Section 323-U1341B-39H-7. These appended intervals are supported by wireline logging data compared to core logging of natural gamma radiation. Additional cores below the splice are included in the composite depth framework by appending them with a constant affine value specific to each hole.  

The cumulative offset between CSF and CCSF-D depth scales is approximately linear. The affine growth factor (a measure of the fractional stretching of the composite section relative to the drilled interval) at Site U1341 is 1.06 between 0 and $374.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Cores deeper than the spliced interval, that is, Cores 323-U1341A-41H and 323- U1341B-40H through 71X, are not tied to the splice but are appended with a constant affine value of 19.95. MARs in this interval should not be divided by the affine growth factor because their depths are a linear transformation of drilling depths.  

# Downhole measurements  

Two downhole logging tool strings were deployed in Hole U1341B to the total depth of $600\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF ( $2750\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below rig floor [DRF]): the triple combo and the FMS-sonic combination. Overall, the caliper of the density sonde on the triple combo tool string indicated an enlarged and irregular borehole with many intervals with hole diameter ${>}20$ inches. During the runs, the tool encountered significant drag in many places above $260\,\mathrm{m}$ wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF), producing a stickslip motion that was detrimental to the quality of the data. As a result, the logging speed was increased from 900 ft/h to $1200\ \mathrm{ft/h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , and the tools were reconfigured to prevent any impact on the vertical resolution of the data.  

The readings of the two orthogonal FMS calipers suggest that the borehole section was far from circular, probably elliptical. One caliper read ${<}10$ inches over most of the lower half of the interval logged, while the other one kept close to $\mathord{\sim}14$ inches, near the limit of its range. The fact that the curves display variability over most of the hole suggests that both sets of arms were making some kind of contact with the formation, possibly with one pad only in some places. The larger Hostile Environment LithoDensity Sonde (HLDS) caliper readings show that this single-arm caliper was likely following the longest axis of the hole and that the stronger and skinnier arm was actually pushing inside the formation.  

The large hole size had an effect mostly on measurements that require good contact with the formation, namely density and porosity. The very high neutron porosity values above ${\sim}275\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF indicate that porosity readings are erroneous above this depth. Similarly, the anomalously low density values between 180 and $210\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ also indicate poor tool contact and are also erroneous. Even if the FMS arms seem to have been in contact with the formation over most of the interval logged, this contact was likely only partial in places, resulting in blurry or featureless images in many intervals. It is still possible to identify many fine layers, mostly in the deeper part of the hole.  

Logging Unit 1 (80–220 m WMSF) is characterized mainly by decreasing trends with depth in gamma radiation and resistivity, accompanied with several high peaks in these measurements (Fig. F33). It coincides mostly with lithologic Unit I, which consists of diatom ooze and diatom silt. Most of the peaks in gamma radiation are related to high uranium content. The coincidence of these higher uranium values with higher resistivity, and to some extent with higher density, is an indication that they are due to authigenic carbonate, which was observed at many of these depths. Logging Unit 2 $220{-}350\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WMSF}$ ) is defined by increasing trends with depth in gamma radiation and density measurements, whereas resistivity mostly decreases. Several peaks in gamma radiation can be observed in this unit as well, again generally due to higher uranium content and often associated with authigenic carbonate observed in the core. The top of logging Unit 3 $(350{-}425\mathrm{~m~WMSF})$ ) is defined by a sharp drop in density at ${\sim}350\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF and by similar changes in gamma radiation and density. Because velocity does not display any significant change at this depth, the change in density is likely responsible for the strong reflector that can be observed in seismic Line Stk5-1 at $3340~\mathrm{ms}$ two-way traveltime. The top of logging Unit 4 $425{-}600\ \mathrm{m}$ WMSF) is defined by a drop in resistivity, which decreases with depth over the entire unit. It coincides also with an inflection in the overall increase with depth of shear velocity and, to a lesser extent, of compressional velocity.  

Formation temperature measurements were successfully made with the APCT-3 tool at three depths in Hole U1341A. The measured temperatures ranged from $4.68^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $41.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF to $11.12^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $136.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and closely fit a linear geothermal gradient of $67.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km}$ . The temperature at the seafloor was $1.95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ based on the average of the measurements at the mudline during all the APCT-3 deployments. A simple estimate of the heat flow can be obtained from the product of the geothermal gradient by the average thermal conductivity $(0.825\mathrm{~W}/[\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}}])$ , which gives a value of $55.9\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2},$ , within the range of previous measurement in the area.  

# Age model and sedimentation rates  

Only two relatively deep holes in Expedition 323 reached the bulk of the Pliocene age: Holes U1340A (cored to $604.6\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ and U1341B (cored to $600.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF). Stratigraphic efforts using diatoms, silicoflagellates, ebridians, radiolarians, and paleomagnetism were employed to determine a correct age model; however, this method proved difficult. Among the many parameters examined on board the R/V JOIDES Resolution, the percentage counts of three species of abundant diatoms—Neodenticula kamtschatica, Neodenticula koizumii, and Neodenticula seminae—were very useful in constructing tie points between the two holes in question.  

The total percentage of each of these species exceeds $50\%$ during the Pliocene (Fig. F34). Because of their high abundances, higher reliability on the tie points was given to their rapid increase (RI) or rapid decrease (RD) than was given to the LO or FO of taxa with only a single or few specimen counts (Fig. F35). These taxa were interpreted to have occurred to a similar extent at about the same times because Holes U1340A and U1341B are not too far apart in the Bowers Ridge region. Detailed compilation of all the pertinent biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic datums clearly suggests that the tie points are more or less in agreement, with the exception of Ebriopsis antiqua antiqua, whose abundance is very rare (Fig. F35). Especially note that the agreed paleomagnetic datums are in line with the tie points illustrated. Six reliable tie points were assigned from the Pliocene and Pleistocene section: the FO of N. koizumii, the top of the Gauss, the RI of N. seminae, the bottom of the Jaramillo, the top of the Jaramillo, and the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary (Fig. F35).  

Sedimentation rates in the upper Pleistocene section appear to be $10{-}11\ \mathrm{cm/k.y}.$ . (Fig. F36; Table T14). During the Jaramillo the sedimentation rate is very high, $46\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ , but more work is needed to refine the depth of the polarity reversals at the top and bottom of the Jaramillo. Below ${\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A sedimentation rates are at $15\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . until the top of the Gauss at $368\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. Below that depth the sedimentation rate is $9~\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . These age model and sedimentation rate estimates may be altered with postcruise research.  

# Site U1342  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective of drilling at Site U1342 (prospectus Site BOW-15A) was to study high-resolution Pliocene–Pleistocene paleoceanography at a relatively shallow water depth on Bowers Ridge, where relatively low sedimentation rates were observed in an earlier site survey piston core study (Takahashi, 2005). Bowers Ridge is well situated for study of the past extent of water mass exchange with the Pacific Ocean through adjacent Aleutian passes such as Amukta, Amchitka, and Buldir passes (Figs. F37, F38, F39, F40). As with the other Bowers Ridge sites, the record of changes in the flow of the warm Alaskan Stream water mass into the Bering Sea and its impact on the distribution of past sea ice coverage is of particular interest.  

A previous site survey piston core study found more open water conditions during the LGM at Site BOW-8A, which is practically the same location as Site U1342, than at Site BOW-12A near the ridge crest at the location of Site U1340. Although productivity in the Bering Sea in general is very high with respect to other parts of the global oceans, the expected productivity at this site, along with the other Bowers Ridge sites, is lower than at Site U1339 on Umnak Plateau, which experiences substantially greater influence from the adjacent Bering Sea shelf. Site U1342, with its relatively shallow water depth of $818\mathrm{~m~}$ , serves as the shallow end site in comparison to the other Bowers Ridge sites (Site U1340, water depth $=1295\mathrm{~m~}$ ; Site U1341, water depth $=2140\ \mathrm{m}$ ); therefore, Site U1342 provides an important constraint on the intensity and depth of the water column OMZ. A previous site survey piston core study reported sedimentation rates of ${\sim}32\;\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ , and Pliocene-age sediments at the bottom of the sedimentary section are expected.  

This drill site at Bowers Ridge can also be used to study the impact of subseafloor microbes on biogeochemical fluxes. Organic-fueled subseafloor respiration and its impact on biogeochemistry in such a highly productive region has not previously been quantified. To do this, sediments drilled at Bowers Ridge will be used to determine subseafloor cell abundances and to investigate the link between the mass and characteristics of subseafloor microbes and the extent of export productivity from the surface ocean (Takahashi et al., 2000, 2002). Compared to the other Expedition 323 drill sites where detailed microbiological studies have occurred, Site U1342 is expected to have lower (but still high) surface ocean productivity. As such, because of its more open ocean location farthest away from the high-productivity zone of the shelf, Site U1342 serves as the low-productivity end-member of the expedition’s microbiological study.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sediments recovered at Site U1342 are a mix of biogenic, volcaniclastic, and siliciclastic sediments. In general, the color of the sediments reflects their lithologic characteristics: sediment composed of siliciclastic sediment or mixed lithologies tends to be very dark greenish gray to dark gray, whereas biogenic sediment is olive-gray to olive. Volcaniclastic ash layers are dark gray to black or shades of light gray to white. The sedimentary sequence can be divided into three lithologic units: Unit I, consisting of silt and laminated ooze; Unit II, consisting of sponge spicule–bearing, diatombearing sand; and Unit III, consisting of volcanic rock and volcaniclastic sedimentary rock.  

The occurrence of well-preserved laminations in Unit I indicates the absence of bioturbating fauna and thus suggests low oxygen conditions in the bottom waters and the sediment pore water. Burrows or mottles at the gradational tops of laminated sediment intervals indicate an increase in oxygenation of bottom waters after the deposition of the laminated sediments. In contrast, the sharp bottom boundaries suggest either a sudden increase in sedimentation rate at the onset of laminated intervals or a hiatus between the laminated sediments and underlying siliciclastic sediments. The winnowing of sediment by bottom currents may have caused the apparent low average sedimentation rate $(3\,\mathrm{cm/k.y.})$ , and the sedimentary record might inherit strongly variable sedimentation rates or even phases of nondeposition or erosion. The total number of well-correlated laminated intervals is roughly equal to the total number of interglacial cycles that occurred during the last $1.1\;\mathrm{m.y}$ . The occurrence of laminated ooze reflects the interglacial times, which is consistent with the preliminary paleomagnetic age model.  

Moderately to well-rounded and mixed volcaniclastic and metamorphic mineral or rock fragments in the sand encountered in Unit II indicate a terrestrial source. Although the base of Unit I is dated to only $1.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , several Miocene diatom species were observed in Unit II. This suggests the following possible processes: extremely low sedimentation, a hiatus, or reworking by sediment gravity flows.  

The basement volcanic rock (basalt) was most likely deposited as lava, as indicated by the flow alignment of the plagioclase laths and the vesicular texture. The volcaniclastic rocks beneath have a mafic volcanic source and contain both lava fragments and tephra fragments (scoria).  

# Biostratigraphy  

Eighteen biostratigraphic datum events indicating an upper to middle Quaternary sequence were identified based on radiolarians, diatoms, silicoflagellates, and calcareous nannofossils. The sedimentation rate at Site U1342 is relatively low $(3\ {\mathrm{cm/k.y.}})$ , as implied by the estimated age of $1.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ for the bottom of Unit I based on biostratigraphic markers. Calcareous microfossils reflect a high-latitude environment, indicating variations of sea-surface temperatures. The benthic foraminifers generally reflect environments within or near the OMZ in high-latitude regions. The preserved siliceous microfossils are mainly composed of high-latitude pelagic species, which indicates changes to surface water productivity. Dinoflagellates consistently occur throughout the record with poor preservation in the lower part. The dinoflagellate assemblages show changes between low and high primary productivity together with general low sea-surface temperatures and low seasonal sea ice coverage.  

Both dinocyst assemblages and sea ice diatoms suggest low seasonal sea ice coverage. In general, dinocysts suggest high primary productivity, low sea-surface temperature, and seasonal sea ice coverage. However, the co-dominance of the autotrophic Operculodinium centrocarpum and the heterotrophic Brigantedinium spp. at $20.96\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF in Hole U1342A could be associated with relatively low primary productivity and/or an incursion  of  oceanic/oligotrophic  waters.  Planktonic  foraminifers  are  present throughout the section from ${\sim}36\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{CSF},$ , showing polar–subpolar conditions. Benthic foraminifers generally exhibit high abundances, and variation in species dominance is probably related to changes in oxygen levels and/or organic fluxes.  

The uppermost one or two cores, depending on the hole, are assigned to calcareous nannoplankton Zone NN21 ( $0.29~\mathrm{Ma}$ to the present) (Martini, 1971; Lourens et al., 2004), characterized by Emiliania huxleyi. Sample 323-U1342A-3H-CC contains Pseudoemiliana lacunosa and is therefore assigned to calcareous nannofossil Zone NN19 $(>\!0.44\mathrm{~Ma})$ . Planktonic foraminifers are present only in the uppermost four cores of each hole except Hole U1342D, where they also occur in Core 323-U1342D-5H. The fauna is dominated by Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) in all samples. More than 20 species of benthic foraminifers were recovered from this site. Occasionally dominant species are Cassidulina sp. and Uvigerina peregrina. Persistently occurring species include Brizalina pygmaea, Brizalina spathulata, Bulimina aff. exilis, Globobulimina pacifica, and Valvulineria spp. This assemblage shows similarities to those in the uppermost ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF of Sites U1339, U1340, and U1341 and also to those within or near the OMZ in the Sea of Okhotsk (Bubenshchikova et al., 2008). This assemblage does not appear to reflect shallow-water (shelfal) deposition.  

The LO of Proboscia curvirostris $(0.3\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is observed at the base of Cores 323-U1342A3H and 323-U1342C-3H, which is consistent with Sites U1340 and U1341, also located on Bowers Ridge. Because of poor diatom preservation below Core 5H in each hole, the biostratigraphic zonation was constrained by one species, P. curvirostris, which places the N. seminae Zone 12 at $0{-}11.41\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF in Hole U1342A and 0–17.04 m CSF in Hole U1342C, respectively. Based on the observed silicoflagellate species the age of the uppermost four cores in Holes U1342A and U1342D is probably Pleistocene. Cores 323-U1342A-5H and below may possibly be older than $2.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ given the occurrence of Ebriopsis antiqua antiqua, assuming it is not reworked.  

Six radiolarian datums derived in the subarctic Pacific were identified at this site. These datums showed relatively low sedimentation rates $({\sim}5\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.})$ in the uppermost $20\;\mathrm{m}$ of each hole compared to the other Bowers Ridge sites (Sites U1340 and U1341). Although radiolarian datums are scarce in the lower intervals, the LO of $E$ . matuyamai $(0.9–1.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) was found at the base of Core 323-U1342B-4H. This datum provides a constraint for the age estimation for the lower intervals and an average sedimentation rate in Hole U1342B of $2{-}4\ \mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ .  

Poor preservation of organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts in the lower part of the sequence and particularly in the sandy layer suggests significant oxygen concentrations in the bottom water. The dinoflagellate assemblage composition is modern, suggesting Pleistocene age for all analyzed samples.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The average inclination value is nearly $70^{\circ}$ over all normal polarity intervals, which is close to the site axial dipole inclination of $\sim\!72^{\circ}$ (Table T15). This indicates that we can effectively remove overprint magnetization caused by drill pipes and/or core barrels from the NRM records. We defined a polarity zonation from the inclination record  and  correlated  the  zonation  to  the  polarity  timescale  based  on micropaleontology datums (Fig. F41). The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary and the base of the Jaramillo Subchron are clearly identified through Holes U1342A, U1342C, and U1342D. The top of the Jaramillo Subchron and both the top and base of the Cobb Mountain Subchron are identified in Holes U1342C and U1342D but not in Hole U1342A. We also tentatively note the existence of three excursions visible in all three holes: the Kamikatsura, Santa Rosa, and Punaruu excursions.  

It is possible to see a correlatable pattern of relative paleointensity at the present site and at Site U1341, as indicated by the relative numbering scheme within the Brunhes Chron (the last 780,000 y). Note, however, that the relative paleointensity estimates are both significantly influenced by lithologic variability and should not be considered high-resolution estimates of true geomagnetic field intensity variations. We estimate that fine-grained hemipelagic marine sediments were deposited over the last 1 m.y. with essentially a constant sediment accumulation rate. Note the discrete intervals where both magnetic parameters undergo more than order-of-magnitude decreases. These indicate the intervals of significant magnetic mineral dissolution. They appear to be closely related to the laminated sediment intervals, and both are probably related to enhanced rates of reduction diagenesis during those selected time intervals. Our chronostratigraphic estimates suggest that these dissolved intervals (and the associated laminations) occur in the interglacial sediments. Note that a few narrow intervals have significantly stronger remanence because of authigenic greigite. They are interpreted to always occur within the glacial-stage sediments with lower porosity.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

The composite depth scale and splice at Site U1342 is complete and continuous from 0.0 to $46.71\textrm{m}$ CCSF-A (Tables T16, T17). Sediment cores below the splice are included in the composite depth framework by appending them with a constant affine value of $2.783\mathrm{~m~}$ . Color reflectance data were examined: the $\mathbf{b}^{\star}$ parameter is considered useful for correlation, but $\mathrm{L}^{\star}$ and $a^{\star}$ do not appear to correlate between holes. Within the splice the composite CCSF-A depth scale is defined as the CCSF-D depth scale. Note that CCSF-D rigorously applies only to the spliced interval. Intervals outside the splice, although available with CCSF-A composite depth assignments, should not be expected to correlate precisely with fine-scale details within the splice or with other holes because of normal variation in the relative spacing of features in different holes. Such apparent depth differences may reflect coring artifacts or fine-scale variations in sediment accumulation and preservation at and below the seafloor. The cumulative offset between CSF and CCSF-D depth scales is approximately linear. The affine growth factor at Site U1342 is 1.06 between 0 and $44.0~\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Calculation of MARs based on the CCSF-A or CCSF-D scales should account for this affine growth factor by dividing apparent depth intervals by the appropriate growth factor. After dividing by the growth factor this scaled depth scale should be referred to as CCSF-B.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water sulfate, DIC, $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ , and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}+$ profiles indicate that sediments at Site U1342 are characterized by low rates of anaerobic carbon mineralization predominantly driven by organoclastic sulfate reduction (Fig. F42). Additionally, small increases in Mn concentration might indicate microbial Mn reduction as a further mineralization pathway. It is more likely, however, that dissolved Mn is released during reaction of hydrogen sulfide with Fe/Mn (oxyhydr)oxides. Comparison with Site U1341, also located on Bowers Ridge, reveals that the present site has one order of magnitude lower $\mathrm{NH}_{4}+$ concentrations and ${\sim}50\%$ lower phosphate concentrations. This highlights the extremely low mineralization rates at Site U1342 despite its shallower depth and the similar TOC at both sites. The low extent of anaerobic carbon mineralization at the present site can be attributed to the extremely low sedimentation rates. Very low sedimentation rates probably prolong the time that organic matter is degraded via oxic respiration and nitrate reduction in the oxic/suboxic sediment zone. This leaves rather refractory organic material, which is only inefficiently degraded during anaerobic carbon mineralization (Hulthe et al., 1998).  

Solid-phase data, however, suggest that the present-day geochemistry might only give a limited picture of past conditions. High TOC concentrations that correlate strongly with high total sulfur concentrations in several laminated intervals discovered throughout the sediment column indicate events of high organic carbon input that probably resulted in high sulfate reduction rates during these periods and hence elevated hydrogen sulfide production, which is reflected in high pyrite (total sulfur) concentrations. However, the contents of $C a C O_{3}$ are not always high in the laminated layers.  

Another interesting feature of Site U1342 is the inverse relationship of the (almost linear) calcium and magnesium profiles, which indicates the influence of signals linked to the alteration of the underlying basalt on the interstitial water calcium and magnesium concentrations. Most likely, both profiles are the result of diffusion between the seawater and the relatively shallow basaltic basement. Low-temperature interactions of seawater with the basaltic basement (e.g., the dissolution of basaltic glass, calcic plagioclase, and olivine) result in the liberation of calcium, whereas the precipitation of smectite leads to the consumption of magnesium (see, for example, Gieskes, 1981; Staudigel and Hart, 1983; Thompson, 1983; Lyons et al., 2000).  

# Microbiology  

Samples for abundance of prokaryotes were collected adjacent to interstitial water whole-rounds in sections drilled using the APC. High-resolution sampling took place in the microbiology-dedicated cores and in additional samples taken once per core to APC refusal in Hole U1342A. These additional samples were taken to evaluate cell abundance and community structure in the deepest portion of Site U1342. PFT analyses performed on these cores showed no contamination from the drill fluid. Samples from all cores were fixed. These analyses assist the understanding of global distribution and abundance of subseafloor life in a highly productive oceanic regime. Special focus will be directed toward the function of Archaea in the sulfate reduction zone, the SMTZ, and the methanogenesis zone.  

# Physical properties  

The downhole-decreasing trend of magnetic susceptibility ranges from a near-surface value of ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{SI}$ units to about half this value at ${\sim}35\ \mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ which is the base of lithologic Unit I. Below this depth magnetic susceptibility readings in Unit II increase in steps to as high as 400 SI units at $40\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF}.$ The higher values in Unit II likely track the downward-increasing abundance of sandy material derived from the underlying volcanic basement, which was wave-based leveled sometime in the early late Miocene. Magnetic susceptibility values are much higher in Hole U1342D at ${\sim}73{-}74\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF $29{-}30\;\mathrm{m}$ below the sediment/basement contact), averaging \~1500 SI units, and decrease deeper in the section to ${\sim}750~\mathrm{SI}$ units at ${\sim}116{-}117\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF ( ${\sim}72{-}73\mathrm{~m~}$ into basement).  

A prominent downhole profile of increasing average wet bulk density is noted. The higher gradient of the lower trend is within the sandy sediment of Unit II, which is presumably granular material derived during the wave-beveling final stage of destruction of a stratavolcano that formerly rose above Ulm Plateau. $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocity increases downhole from near-surface readings of just over $1.45~\mathrm{km/s}$ to ${\sim}1.55\ \mathrm{km/s}$ in Unit II near the contact with basement rock at ${\sim}45\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF (Fig. F39). In the sandy sediment of Unit II in Hole U1342D, $P$ -wave velocity increased to ${\sim}1.65\ \mathrm{km/s}$ and somewhat higher.  

NGR readings increase irregularly downhole from a near-surface average of ${\sim}18$ counts/s to $\sim\!\!24$ counts/s at the base of Unit I. The gradient of increasing counts/s steepens within the sandy beds of Unit II to reach ${\sim}33$ counts/s just above basement contact at ${\sim}44~\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Presumably, the elevated NGR readings record a downhole increase in clay minerals and, at least within Unit II, clay minerals derived from the underlying bedrock of arc lava and volcaniclastic deposits. Rock clasts recovered in core sections exhibit evidence of oxidation. Clay minerals that account for the higher readings in the basal sediment of Unit II presumably reflect subaerial weathering of the stratavolcano that formerly towered above Ulm Plateau prior to its early late Miocene destruction.  

In general, MAD values of discrete samples track those of gamma ray attenuation but with a much greater spacing of measurements. The contrast between Unit I and denser Unit II sediments is nonetheless well shown by MAD data. The near-surface porosity is ${\sim}80\%$ but decreases to ${\sim}55\%$ in the sandy sediment of Unit II and just above basement at $44\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. The downhole trend of overall decreasing porosity and water content presumably reflects compaction of the section, with notable excursions to higher values in the basal $10{-}12\,\mathrm{m}$ of Unit I that may identify a higher relative content of siliceous microfossils. The relatively elevated grain density in Unit I in comparison to the upper beds of Site U1341 on the deeper flank of Bowers Ridge can be attributed to the availability of nearby bedrock sources for Site U1342 deposits.  

# Downhole measurements  

The temperatures measured with the APCT-3 tool in Hole U1342C were $4.46^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 26.2 m DSF and $5.32^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $35.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. From these two measurements the geothermal gradient should be $97.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . The estimated heat flow is $96.9\mathrm{~m~W}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , which is significantly higher than existing measurements in the area. Alternately, considering the variations in thermal conductivity with depth, a more accurate measure of the heat flow in a conductive regime can be given by a Bullard plot, which gives a heat flow value of $80.9\mathrm{~m~W}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , which is closer to other measurements in the Bowers Ridge area.  

# Sedimentation rates  

The apparent sedimentation rate in the uppermost section between the mudline and $3.6\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A (marked by the LO of Amphimelissa setosa) was $5\;\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . with relatively high water contents and hence may not be significantly different from those below it (Fig. F43; Table T18). Sedimentation rates stayed at fairly constant values of $2{-}3\ \mathrm{cm}/$ k.y. between $3.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A and the magnetic Kamikatsura Excursion at $\sim\!29\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSFA. This is followed by an increasing trend up to 9 cm/k.y. down to the bottom of magnetic Cobb Mountain at ${\sim}43\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A. The presence of Miocene diatoms in lithologic Unit II warrants further refinement of the age model.  

# Site U1343  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective of drilling at Site U1343 (prospectus Site GAT-4C) was to study high-resolution Pliocene–Pleistocene paleoceanography at a location proximal to the gateway to the Arctic Ocean. Additionally, this site is closer to the current seasonal sea ice limit and because of its $2~\mathrm{km}$ water depth it provides information regarding the history of mid-depth water in the Aleutian Basin. This site is located at a topographic high clearly separated from the Bering shelf (Figs. F44, F45, F46, F47, F48). Hence, it was anticipated to have received fewer reworked terrigenous sediments from the shelf during the interglacials or the subaerially exposed land during the glacials than a location directly downslope of the Bering shelf.  

Site U1343 is in the area of high biological productivity called the Green Belt. The Green Belt is formed by the Bering Slope Current (BSC), which originates from the Alaskan Stream water that flows into the Bering Sea through the western Aleutian Islands. The water that enters the Bering Sea moves eastward along the Aleutian Islands and consequently encounters the Bering shelf. The base of the BSC is at ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth and its flow is forced to turn to the northwest once it meets the slope and shelf; eddies and instabilities in its flow cause upwelling along the shelf break. Moreover, tidal mixing causes further vertical mixing of the water masses along the BSC, enhancing biological productivity within the Green Belt, which is adjacent to the northwest-trending shelf break where high primary productivity in the surface waters and high organic carbon accumulation at the seafloor take place. Because of the expected high organic carbon supply to the seafloor, especially during the interglacial sea level highstands, it is possible the OMZ previously expanded down to the depth of this site. In order to compare the vertical extent of water mass conditions across the basin and relate the OMZ to paleoproductivity, the records from the shallower drill sites on Bowers Ridge (Site U1340, water depth $=1295\mathrm{~m~}$ ; Site U1342, water depth $=818\mathrm{~m}$ ) as well as the other slope sites will be used. This site is also located close to the maximum extent of the present-day seasonal sea ice cover. Thus, this site was expected to have been covered by seasonal or perennial sea ice during the glacial sea level lowstands.  

This drill site in the gateway region to the Arctic Ocean can also be used to study the impact of subseafloor microbes on biogeochemical fluxes in the highest surface ocean productivity areas of the Bering Sea drill sites. Organic-fueled subseafloor respiration and its impact on biogeochemistry in such a highly productive region has not previously been quantified. To do so, the drilled sediments in the gateway region were used to determine subseafloor cell abundance and to investigate the link between the mass and characteristics of subseafloor microbes and the extent of export productivity from the surface ocean.  

Sedimentation rates at this site were not previously known because of a lack of piston cores. However, rates of ${\sim}180\,\mathrm{m/m.}\$ y. were observed at Site U1344 (proposed Site GAT3A) in an earlier site survey piston core study (Takahashi, 2005). Thus, prior to drilling, recovery of Pleistocene to Pliocene sections was expected at this site.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Sediments at Site U1343 are primarily composed of silt with varying amounts of clay and diatoms and minor amounts of sand, ash, foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, and sponge spicules. The sediment is predominantly dark/very dark greenish gray to dark/very dark gray. One lithologic unit spanning the early Pleistocene to the Holocene is defined at this site. Six laminated intervals are observed and can be correlated between the holes based on lithologic, reflectance, and magnetic susceptibility data. Unit I encompasses a time period comparable to Unit I defined at Bowers Ridge Sites U1340 and U1341. However, Site U1343 is distinct in having a higher proportion of siliciclastic grains and a higher occurrence of sand-sized grains. This is probably related to the location of this site on the continental slope and the relative proximity to the source of terrigenous sediments. During glacial sea level lowstands, and in particular during early stages of deglaciations, significant amounts of coarser grained detrital material might have been mobilized from the exposed Bering Sea shelf and redeposited farther down the continental slope. Unlike Site U1339, drilled on the slope at Umnak Plateau, volcaniclastic material is only a minor component of sediment at Site U1343 because it is more distant from the Aleutian arc. There is a shallow SMTZ and abundant methane in the sediment column at Site U1343, like at the other slope sites. Benthic and planktonic foraminifers encrusted with yellow minerals are common, and they often coincide with samples in which authigenic carbonates are found. Association of authigenic carbonates and apparent overgrowths implies that authigenic carbonates nucleated on the foraminifer tests. In this case the stable isotope records from this site are potentially contaminated by the isotopic signature of the overgrowths; however, pristine foraminifer shells were also observed, and the generation of uncontaminated isotope stratigraphies should be possible after careful screening for authigenic carbonates.  

# Biostratigraphy  

The composite age model derived from all five holes shows that the sediment record recovered at Site U1343 spans the last $2.0{-}2.4\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ , yielding a broadly linear trend in sedimentation rates, with values around $26\ \mathrm{cm/k.y}.$ . in the uppermost $400\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A that increase to ${\sim}56~\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . in the bottom $350\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. Siliceous, calcareous, and organic fossils show the greatest abundances in the uppermost $300{-}250\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A relative to the section below. In the upper section all microfossil groups show distinct large and frequent oscillations, indicating fluctuations in the sea ice cover and productivity in the upper water column and in the deepwater environment. All major microfossil groups show distinct changes, occurring gradually or abruptly between 200 and $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A (0.8 to $1.1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ), in their general trend of abundances and/or assemblage composition. These changes are thus linked to the MPT. Benthic foraminifers indicate high-frequency changes in bottom water oxygen content over the entire sequence, probably related primarily to surface water productivity, but possibly also to bottom water ventilation changes and methane seeps. The cooling trend observed after the MPT is reflected in the increase of abundances of sea ice dinoflagellate and diatom taxa and in the decrease of the predominance of pelagic/open water conditions evidenced in the decline of subpolar planktonic foraminifers and the diatom species Neodenticula seminae.  

The occurrence of calcareous nannofossil Emiliania huxleyi at the base of Core 323- U1343A-3H assigns an age for this core to calcareous nannofossil Zone NN21, which is defined by the FO datum of E. huxleyi $(0.29\,\mathrm{Ma})$ to the present. However, the occurrence of a barren interval below this level made it impossible to constrain the FO of E. huxleyi and the boundary with Zone NN20. The LO datum of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa $\left(0.44\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ in Sample 323-U1343A-12H-7, $46\,\mathrm{cm}$ , which defines the upper limit of calcareous nannofossil Zone NN19, is well constrained because it takes place within an interval rich in calcareous nannofossils. Although the trace amount of planktonic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina atlantica (sinistral) with the LO $(2.4{-}2.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is present, the age derived by this taxon appears too old when compared to other datums. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages have a similar species composition to the assemblages found at Site U1339 and are within or near the OMZ in the Sea of Okhotsk.  

High-frequency variation in oxygenation is apparent throughout the section, but initial results show generally higher oxygen indicators such as Elphidium cf. batialis and Islandiella norcrossi are dominant in and below Core 323-U1343E-24H.  

The LO datum of diatom Proboscia curvirostris $(0.3\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and the LO datum of Thalassiosira jouseae $(0.3\,\mathrm{Ma})$ were observed at ${\sim}70{-}77\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CS}$ F in three holes at Site U1343. This is consistent with results from Site U1339 at Umnak Plateau. The cored interval above the LO of $P.$ curvirostris $(0.3\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is assigned to Neodenticula seminae Zone NPD12. The interval between the LCO datum of Actinocyclus oculatus observed at $296.4\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}$ and the LO datum of $P.$ curvirostris at $69.4\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ in Hole U1343E is assigned to $P.$ curvirostris Zone NPD11. The interval below this datum above the FO of Neodenticula koizumii is $A$ . oculatus Zone NPD10. The FO of $P.$ curvirostris ( $1.85\pm0.1\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) was defined in Sample 323-U1343E-50X-CC and assigned to the age in the $A$ . oculatus Zone. The LO of $P_{\zeta}$ yxidicula horridus $1.9{-}2.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) was estimated in Core 323-U1343E-61X. The LCO of $N_{\cdot}$ . koizumii $(2.1\,\mathrm{\Omega}\,\mathrm{Ma})$ was observed in Sample 323-U1342E-77X-CC. The interval between this datum and the bottom of Hole U1343E is assigned to N. koizumii Zone NPD9. The LO of silicoflagellate Distephanus octonarius $(0.2–0.3\,\mathrm{Ma})$ is estimated to be between 64.0 and $74.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. The LO of Dictyocha subarctios $(0.6–0.8\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is estimated to be between 196.2 and $205.35\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF (Hole U1343C) and between 196.1 and $205.45\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF (Hole U1343E). The bottom age in Hole U1343E is younger than $2.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ because of the absence of ebridian Ebriopsis antiqua antiqua. In Sample 323- U1343E-27H-CC relatively warm water taxa belonging to Dictyocha spp. are observed in high numbers $(30\%)$ , indicating a possible increase of subarctic Pacific water entry into the Bering Sea. Six radiolarian datums common in the subarctic Pacific were identified at this site. The LO and FO datums of $E$ . matuyamai $(0.9{-}1.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and $1.7-$ $1.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively) were identified in samples from Hole U1343E. In the uppermost $250\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}$ changes in dinoflagellate assemblages are observed, indicating surface water conditions that vary from high productivity and upwelling to conditions with pronounced sea ice cover. Such a high variability above $250\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF is also observed in pollen and spore abundances, suggesting changing vegetation in adjacent land masses as well.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary is clearly identified in Holes U1343A, U1343C, and U1343E between 180 and $185\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ and both the termination and onset of the Jaramillo Subchron were identified below this (Table T19). Deeper in the section, whereas inclination tends to cluster around normal polarity values making it difficult to identify polarity zonation, the top boundary of the normal polarity zone at $\sim\!\!292$ m CSF has been tentatively identified as the termination of the Cobb Mountain Subchron (Fig. F49). The paleointensity variation has quite a large amplitude and obviously shows a coherent change with the magnetic susceptibility, suggesting that NRM intensity has been largely influenced by environmental changes.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ , DIC, $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ , and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ concentration profiles indicate that the sediments at Site U1343 are characterized by high rates of carbon turnover compared to sites at Bowers Ridge (Fig. F50). Values are, in general, at least one order of magnitude higher than at Site U1342 on Bowers Ridge. Profiles of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ suggest that sulfate reduction is largely driven by the diffusion of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ into the sulfate zone. The $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ profile is nearly linear in the uppermost $8\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF},$ , indicating no significant consumption there. The $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ flux into the $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ zone, as calculated from the concentration gradient between 8 and $11\mathrm{~m~}\mathrm{CSF},$ , is ${\sim}50\%{-}60\%$ of the $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ flux into the SMTZ. Hydrogen sulfide is also at a maximum in the SMTZ. The ratio between autotrophic and organoclastic sulfate reduction is higher at Site U1343 than at the Bowers Ridge or Umnak Plateau sites. A relatively high flux of $C a^{2+}$ into the SMTZ further stresses the importance of anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM), which commonly leads to the formation of $C a C O_{3}$ . The $C a^{2+}$ flux into the SMTZ is ${\sim}35\%$ of the methane flux, indicating that an equivalent fraction of the DIC produced through AOM is deposited as $C a C O_{3}$ .  

The curvature of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ profile suggests $\mathrm{NH}_{4}+$ production from organic matter degradation throughout the sediment column. This is confirmed through preliminary modeling exercises and suggests organic matter degradation and hence microbial activity even at depths below $400\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Organic matter degradation also leads to the accumulation of DIC and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ in the interstitial water. The accumulation of these species, however, is much lower than predicted by the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{}^{+}$ profile assuming steady state and a constant ratio between C, N, and $\mathrm{P}$ of remineralized organic matter. This suggests both production and consumption of DIC and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ in the sediment. Consumption of these species is most likely due to formation of apatite and calcium carbonates (e.g., dolomite). The pore water profiles suggest that rates of net consumption of $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ are highest between 180 and $200\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF and net DIC consumption is highest between 300 and $350\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF.  

The decrease in salinity and pore water chloride concentrations indicate freshening of the pore fluids with depth. A possible explanation for this trend is the dissociation of gas hydrates during core recovery, which releases fresh water and causes depletions in dissolved ion concentrations. Alternatively, decreases in pore water salinity and chloride concentrations can result from meteoric water input, clay membrane ion filtration, and clay mineral dehydration.  

# Microbiology  

Samples for abundance of prokaryotes were collected adjacent to interstitial water whole-rounds in sections cored using the APC. High-resolution sampling took place in the microbiology-dedicated cores from Hole U1343B as well as in samples taken in each core to APC refusal in Hole U1343A. Additional samples were taken from XCB Cores 323-U1343E-78X to 80X to evaluate cell abundance and community structure in the deepest portion of Hole U1343E. PFT analyses performed on all cores from Hole U1343B and in the deeper cores from Hole U1343E show no contamination from the drill fluid. Samples from all cores were fixed. These analyses will assist with understanding the global distribution and abundance of subseafloor life in a highly productive oceanic regime. A special focus will be directed toward the function of Archaea in the sulfate reduction zone, the SMTZ, and the methanogenesis zone.  

# Physical properties  

Downhole from the uppermost ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF, wet bulk density increases slightly from an average of ${\sim}1.60\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to ${\sim}1.65\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. The average value below this depth, although oscillatory, does not seem to change until ${\sim}360\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ , the calculated depth $\left(\sim\!360\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ of the bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), where a shift to a lower average of ${\sim}1.60~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ occurs. This shift coincides with the change from APC to XCB coring and the consequent recovery of drilling-disturbed core sections. Magnetic susceptibility exhibits cyclicity from lower values averaging ${\sim}20{-}25\ \mathrm{SI}$ units to higher readings of ${\sim}250\,\mathrm{SI}$ units. Peak readings, which are roughly separated by $30{-}50\;\mathrm{m}$ , are prominent to ${\sim}360\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Below this depth the wavelength increases and average values decrease.  

Sonic velocities, ${\cal{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{S}},$ recorded by the downhole FMS-sonic logging tool increase with depth from a near-surface value of ${\sim}1550\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ to ${\sim}1840\,\mathrm{m/s}$ at the bottom of Hole U1343E at ${\sim}744\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. Three gradients of increasing ${\cal{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}$ can be recognized: the first gradient extends to ${\sim}360\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ increasing at ${\sim}110\;\mathrm{m/s/km}_{}$ ; the second extends from 360 to $520\mathrm{~m~CSF},$ increasing at ${\sim}550~\mathrm{m/s/km}_{}$ ; and the third gradient extends from 530 to ${\sim}744\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF, increasing at ${\sim}890~\mathrm{m/s/km}$ . NGR counts generally track abundance of clay minerals and their absorbed radioactive nuclei. Evidently, in Hole U1343E higher bulk density sediment is also richer in clay and other siliciclastic minerals. Siliceous microfossils that resist compaction and sediment consolidation are not the dominant component constructing the stratigraphic section. Perhaps because of this circumstance, NGR readings appear to track compaction-driven densification of clay-rich beds, an observation consistent with the progressive downhole increase in logging-tool-measured $V_{\mathsf{P}}.$  

In general, cores collected above the BSR at ${\sim}360\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF exhibit higher variability of thermal conductivity values, and these are also the most gas-disrupted sections measured. In cores collected below the transition at ${\sim}520\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF to higher carbonate bearing, $V_{\mathsf{P}}$ and bulk density display the highest range of thermal conductivity values. Average values of discrete sample density increase downhole in Hole U1343A from a near-surface measurement of ${\sim}1.50~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to near $1.70~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. Below this subsurface level the average MAD bulk density changes little. Similar profiles of water (moisture) content and sediment porosity are recorded in Holes U1343A and U1343E. Near-surface porosity is ${\sim}70\%$ , noticeably lower than that measured at Sites U1339 $(\sim\!80\%)$ , U1340 $(\sim\!75\%)$ , U1341 $(\sim\!78\%)$ , and U1342 $(\sim\!80\%)$ . This difference is ascribed to the lower overall content of siliceous microfossils constructing the sedimentary section. Porosity and water content decrease sharply downhole to ${\sim}60\%$ at ${\sim}80\ \mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ , below which porosity only gradually decreases to ${\sim}56\%$ at ${\sim}744\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSFD. Average grain density seems to show three density-fluctuating groupings: an upper group from the seafloor to ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF with an average density of $\sim\!2.68\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}.$ ; a middle group between $\mathord{\sim}100$ and $540\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CSF}$ with an average density $\sim\!2.65\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}.$ ; and a basal group that shifts to a lower density of ${\sim}2.55~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at ${\sim}540~\mathrm{m}$ CSF but that increases to $2.70\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at $744~\mathrm{m}$ CSF.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

The composite depth scale and splice at Site U1343 is constructed from 0 to $779.18\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A (Tables T20, T21). The splice consists of one complete and continuous interval from the mudline to $270.47\:\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. The continuous splice ranges from the top of Core 323-U1343C-1H to Section 323-U1343E-29H-7, $79\,\mathrm{cm}$ , and below this are appended cores ranging from Sections 323-U1343E-29H-1, $_{0\mathrm{~cm~}}$ , to 83X-7, $31\,\mathrm{\cm}$ , ( $779.18\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A), with a constant affine value of $35.62\mathrm{~m~}$ . Within the splice the CCSF-A depth scale is defined as the CCSF-D depth scale. CCSF-D rigorously applies only to the spliced interval. The cumulative offset between CSF and CCSF-D depth scales is nonlinear. The affine growth factor at Site U1343 between 0 and $36.4\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ is 1.03. At greater depths all cores have an affine growth factor of 1.15. Calculation of MARs based on the CCSF-A or CCSF-D scales should account for the affine growth factor by dividing apparent depth intervals by the appropriate growth factor for the depth interval. After dividing by the growth factor (accounting for the different depth intervals) this scaled depth scale should be referred to as CCSF-B. MARs calculated for the interval of appended cores deeper than the spliced interval should not be divided by the affine growth factor because their depths are a linear transformation of drilling depths.  

# Downhole measurements  

Two tool strings were deployed in Hole U1343E: the triple combo and the FMS-sonic combination. Although both runs indicated an irregular hole, particularly above 430 $\mathbf{m}\ \mathbf{W}\mathbf{S}\mathbf{F},$ , all of the calipers showed that the tools were making contact with the formation over most of the interval logged, suggesting that the overall quality of the data is good. Although the HLDS caliper suggested that the tools made good contact between 300 and $360\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ and that the hole was even smaller than the nominal bit size in part of this interval, the density and neutron porosity data in this interval seem questionable. The anomalously low density readings between 307 and $322\textrm{m}$ WSF and the very high neutron porosity values between 300 and $360\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ suggest that the tool was not properly measuring formation properties. Comparison with the density measurements made with the GRA track sensor on cores recovered from Hole U1343E and with the MAD measurements made on samples from Site U1343 shows generally good agreement except in this interval, where logging data are significantly lower than core measurements.  

Logging Unit 1 (100–330 m WMSF) is characterized mainly by a steady increase with depth in velocity, whereas the other log data remain mostly uniform despite some variability, such as in gamma radiation. The velocity increase at the bottom of logging Unit 1 is likely responsible for the strong reflector observed at $2860\,\mathrm{ms}$ two-way traveltime in the seismic data. A synthetic seismogram was produced using a wavelet extracted from the seafloor reflection in traces adjacent to Shotpoint 350 and Site U1343 in Line Stk-1. Although we speculated this reflector might be a BSR, indicating the existence of gas hydrate overlying free gas, no conclusive indication from the logs supported the occurrence of gas hydrate. However, slightly higher velocity and resistivity trends and lower dipole waveform amplitudes above the reflector, as well as low chlorinity values measured on several interstitial water samples, suggest that some amount of gas hydrate might be present. Logging Unit 2 ( $330{-}510\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ is defined by slightly decreasing trends with depth in resistivity and by gamma ray values slightly higher than the shallower and deeper units. The top of logging Unit 3 (510– $745\,\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ ) is defined by a drop in gamma radiation, an increase in $V_{\mathsf{P}_{\!r}}$ and a change in the trends of all the logs. The gamma ray, potassium, thorium, density, resistivity, $V_{\mathsf{P}_{\!r}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{S}}$ logs all display higher amplitude and lower frequency variability than in the upper units, suggesting a significant change in the deposition history and rates. A dolostone recovered in this unit can be recognized in the FMS images.  

The APCT-3 tool was successfully deployed three times in Hole U1343A. The measured temperatures ranged from $4.34^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $43.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF to $8.53^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $129.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and closely fit a linear geothermal gradient of $49.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . A simple estimate of the heat flow can be obtained from the product of the geothermal gradient and the average thermal conductivity $(0.985\mathrm{~W}/[\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}}])$ , which gives a value of $48.2\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2},$ , within the range of previous measurement in the area.  

# Sedimentation rates  

Very high sedimentation rates were observed throughout the drilled depths at Site U1343 (Fig. F51; Table T22). From the seafloor to the top of the Jaramillo Subchron $(0.998\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ; $267.6\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A) sedimentation rates were relatively constant within the range of $25{-}29\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . An increase in the rate to $46\,\mathrm{cm}$ /k.y. was observed between the top and the bottom of the Jaramillo Subchron ( $1.072\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ; $302.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A). Farther down at $407.7\:\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A, or $1.55\,\mathrm{Ma}$ as indicated by the LO of dinoflagellate F. filifera, sedimentation rates are ${\sim}21{-}25\ \mathrm{cm/k.}\mathrm{y}$ y. Sedimentation rates increase to $54{-}58\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ between 408 and $716\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. The age at this depth is estimated at $2.1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ by the LCO of diatom Neodenticula koizumii.  

# Site U1344  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective of drilling at Site U1344 (prospectus Site GAT-3C) was to study high-resolution Pliocene–Pleistocene paleoceanography at a proximal gateway location to the Arctic Ocean at the deepest water depth of Expedition 323. The site is located ${\sim}3200\mathrm{~m~}$ along the small summit of a canyon interfluve ${\sim}10–15~\mathrm{km}$ southeast of Pervenets Canyon, a large submarine canyon that deeply and widely incises the Beringian continental slope (Figs. F1, F52, F53, F54, F55) (Normark and Carlson, 2003). Pervenets Canyon, along with companion Zhemchug Canyon adjacent to Site U1343, was discovered in the early 1960s by the Soviet fishing industry and named after one of the discovering trawlers. At times of glacially lowered sea level the head of Pervenets Canyon is commonly presumed to have been one of the outfall locations for the Anadyr River, which presently drains the Russian northeast and enters the Bering Sea at the Gulf of Anadyr. It is anticipated to have received a supply of terrigenous sediments from the shelf during both the interglacials and the glacials.  

This is also the area of high biological productivity called the Green Belt. The Green Belt is formed by the BSC, which originates from the Alaskan Stream water that flows into the Bering Sea through the western Aleutian Islands. The water that enters the Bering Sea moves eastward along the Aleutian Islands and consequently encounters the shallow blocking Bering shelf. The bottom depth of the BSC is at ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , and its flow is forced to turn to the northwest once it meets the slope and shelf; eddies and instabilities in its flow cause upwelling along the shelf break. Moreover, tidal mixing causes further vertical mixing of the water masses along the BSC, enhancing biological productivity within the Green Belt (Taniguchi, 1984; Springer et al., 1996), a zone adjacent to the northwest-trending shelf break where high primary productivity in the surface waters and high organic carbon accumulation at the seafloor take place (Springer et al., 1996). However, we anticipated finding a lower organic carbon supply to the seafloor than at the other gateway sites or at Site U1339 because of the deeper water depth of Site U1344. Thus, expectation of the impingement by the dissolved OMZ in the past is relatively small at this site. Nevertheless, it is important to compare the vertical extent of water mass conditions on a basin-wide scale that includes this site. Hence, the records from the shallower drill sites on Bowers Ridge as well as the other gateway sites can be fully employed for the comparison.  

This site is also located close to the maximum extent of the present-day seasonal sea ice cover. Thus, this site was expected to have been covered by seasonal or perennial sea ice during the glacial low sea level stands. Since it is adjacent to the Bering shelf, a high amount of terrigenous sediment supply was expected, especially during the glacial lowstands.  

This relatively deep drill site in the gateway region to the Arctic Ocean can also be used to study the impact of subseafloor microbes on biogeochemical fluxes in the highest surface ocean productivity areas of the drill sites in the Bering Sea. Organicfueled subseafloor respiration and its impact on biogeochemistry in such a highly productive region has not previously been quantified. To do this, the drilled sediments in the gateway region were used to determine subseafloor cell abundances and to investigate the link between the mass and characteristics of subseafloor microbes and the extent of export productivity from the surface ocean.  

Sedimentation rates at this site have been estimated at $170{-}180\;\mathrm{m/m.y}$ . based on earlier site survey piston core studies (Takahashi, 2005; T. Sakamoto et al., unpubl. data). Neither of the piston cores taken in these studies recovered the Holocene section, possibly indicating erosion during the recent past. Prior to drilling, recovery of sections from the Pleistocene to Pliocene were expected.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

One lithologic unit spanning the early Pleistocene to the Holocene was defined at this site. Unit I at Site U1344 encompasses a time period comparable to Unit I defined at Bowers Ridge Sites U1340 and U1341, and it is in general very similar to Unit I at the other Bering Sea margin Sites U1339 and U1343. However, Site U1344 is distinct in that it has an even higher proportion of siliciclastic components and a higher occurrence of sand-sized grains than Site U1343. This is probably related to the location of this site on the continental slope and its relative proximity to sources of terrigenous sediments from the continental margin. Sandy lithologies are concentrated in three relatively distinct intervals at Site U1344. These can be correlated not only between the holes at Site U1344 but also to Site U1343, where three distinctly sandy intervals occur. Whereas lithologies dominated by diatoms are associated with changes in color reflectance and are analogous to those at other sites, the lithology changes here are more subtle because of overall higher abundances of siliciclastic detritus. Higher abundances of diatoms may reflect high diatom flux during interglacials, as previously observed in the Bering Sea (Okazaki et al., 2005).  

Only one diatom-rich laminated interval was observed. All other laminations are defined by faint color changes with gradational boundaries with the surrounding lithologies. It appears that well-oxygenated bottom water conditions probably prevailed throughout most of the Pleistocene, preventing preservation of laminations. Almost all dropstones are well rounded, indicating a period of reworking prior to incorporation in the ice. The rounding therefore favors a coastal provenance and sea ice rafting rather than icebergs (Lisitzin, 2003). Unlike most other sites (though similar to Site U1343) volcaniclastic material is only a minor component of the sediment at Site U1344 because it is more distant from the Aleutian arc. Authigenic carbonate occurs throughout the sediment and is not constrained to deeper parts of the sequence as it was at Site U1343. The shallowest appearance in Hole U1344A is at $63\textrm{m}$ CSF. The presence of gas in the sediments caused several types of coring disturbance—mostly cracks as wide as several centimeters. In some cases, this affected the stratigraphic integrity of the sediment sequence, similar to Sites U1339 and U1343.  

# Biostratigraphy  

The water depth of Site U1344 is ${\sim}3200\mathrm{~m~}$ and has a potential to reconstruct past deepwater changes because it is presently located below the OMZ. Benthic foraminiferal fauna indicate high-frequency changes in the bottom water oxygen content over the entire section, probably related primarily to surface water productivity but possibly to bottom water ventilation changes and methane seeps as well. There is a general increase in abundance and bottom water oxygen variability from ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF to the top of the section. The low-oxygen indicator Bulimina aff. exilis is more abundant at both Sites U1343 and U1344 after ${\sim}0.8\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , as is benthic foraminifer abundance maxima. Both high-abundance and low-oxygen benthic fauna were found to be common during the last deglacial at Bowers Ridge (Okazaki et al., 2005), and the increase in such characteristics from $0.8\mathrm{~Ma~}$ may mark the onset of more intense deglacials, greater nutrient availability, and higher surface water productivity. Similarly to Site U1343, the increases of planktonic foraminifers also coincide with the highest numbers of sea ice diatoms and sea ice dinoflagellate cysts after $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The change from low to high abundances of planktonic foraminifers coincides with the increased abundances of dinoflagellate cysts, calcareous nannofossils, benthic foraminifers, and the number of low-oxygen benthic foraminifers, analogous to the data shown by Okazaki et al. (2005) for the $C a C O_{3}$ preservation peaks during the last deglaciation in the Bering Sea.  

This site is characterized by very low abundance of calcareous nannofossils. Only samples from the uppermost cores to the base of Core 323-U1344D-4H can be assigned to calcareous nannofossil Zone NN21 with an estimated age of ${<}0.29\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The planktonic foraminifer faunal assemblage found during the late Pleistocene is dominated by Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) throughout. Below $260~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A, N. pachyderma (sinistral) is reduced or absent from the assemblage and the fauna is replaced by subpolar assemblage dominated by G. bulloides. The occurrence of this species is mainly ruled by sea-surface temperature (Asahi and Takahashi, 2007), indicating that the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene was warmer than the late Pleistocene at this site.  

The drilled interval above the LO of diatom $P.$ curvirostris (ranging from 107.2 to 122.3 m CSF, depending on the hole) is assigned to Neodenticula seminae Zone NPD12. Because of the absence of Actinocyclus oculatus in Holes U1344D and U1344E, the bottom of each hole is assigned to Zone NPD 11. The FO datum of $P.$ curvirostris was defined in Sample 323-U1344A-56X-CC and assigned the age of $1.85\pm0.1\;\mathrm{M}z$ a in the  

A. oculatus Zone. The LO of $P\}$ xidicula horridus $(1.9{-}2.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) was estimated at the base of Core 323-U1344A-63X. The LO of silicoflagellate Dictyocha subarctios was assigned to Cores 323-U1344A-30H $(270.25{-}280.31\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CSF})$ and 323-U1344D-26H (224.41– $234.09\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF). The LO of ebridian Ammodochium rectangulare appears to be located in Core 323-U1344A-78X (733.13–739.75 m CSF). The radiolarian ages at Site U1344 span from the Botryostrobus aquilonaris Zone (upper Quaternary) to the Eucyrtidium matuyamai Zone (middle Quaternary) in the subarctic Pacific. Five radiolarian datums derived from the subarctic Pacific were identified at this site. Estimated sedimentation rates in the uppermost $150~\mathrm{m}$ in Holes U1344A, U1344D, and U1344E are ${>}30~\mathrm{cm}/$ k.y., which is slightly higher than at neighboring Site U1343 $({\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm/k.y.})$ . The LO of E. matuyamai $(0.9–1.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ was identified in samples from Hole U1344A. The occurrence of dinoflagellate Filisphaera filifera at the base of Core 323-U1244A-50X (473.4 m CSF) suggests an age of $1.41–1.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , according to its LO datum in the North Pacific and North Atlantic. This species dominates the assemblages in a few samples above this depth, quite similarly to Site U1343. The occasional occurrence of the autotrophic species Operculudinium centrocarpum may be related to oceanic conditions with relatively low productivity.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The Brunhes/Matuyama boundary is clearly identified at ${\sim}280\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF. The Jaramillo, Cobb Mountain, and Olduvai Subchrons might be correlatable with the extracted normal polarity zones placed at $\mathord{\sim}380$ , 420, and $680\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF, respectively (Fig. F56; Table T23). The paleointensity variation has large amplitude and obviously shows a coherent change with magnetic susceptibility, suggesting that NRM intensity has been largely influenced by environmental changes. The relative paleointensity pattern seen at this site is consistent with those observed at Sites U1340, U1341, U1342, and U1343. Based on the correlations, MIS 1–19 have been assigned to ${\sim}280\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF. The dramatic changes in NRM indicate notable effects of early sediment diagenesis. Significant magnetic mineral dissolution starts within $10\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF due to AOM–sulfate reduction processes, which are also evident at Sites U1343 and U1339.  

# Geochemistry  

The rate of carbon turnover in the sediment at Site U1344 is similar to or slightly higher than at Site U1343, as evidenced by similar $S O_{4}{}^{2-},$ , DIC, $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-},$ , and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{}^{+}$ concentration profiles (Fig. F57). Similar to Site U1343, profiles of $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ and $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ at Site U1344 suggest that sulfate reduction is largely driven by $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ diffusion into the sulfate zone. The $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ flux into the $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ zone, as calculated from the concentration gradient between 8 and $13\mathrm{~m~CSF},$ is ${\sim}70\%{-}80\%$ of the $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ flux into the SMTZ. The importance of AOM for overall carbon turnover is also stressed by the curvature in the DIC profile. The steepest concentration gradient in the uppermost $10~\mathrm{m}$ CSF is observed directly above the SMTZ, suggesting that the highest DIC flux occurs from this zone. Preliminary modeling of the DIC profile suggests that net DIC production in the SMTZ accounts for $80\%$ of the DIC production in the uppermost $30\mathrm{~m~CSF}$ of sediment. Hydrogen sulfide is also at a maximum in the SMTZ, most likely because sulfate reduction rates are the highest and the content of oxidized iron is the lowest in this zone. Magnetic susceptibility data obtained during fast scan of the cores confirm a low content of oxidized iron in the SMTZ.  

AOM is well known to favor the deposition of carbonates in the SMTZ. At Site U1344 a relatively high flux of $C a^{2+}$ into the SMTZ is observed, which indicates the formation of calcium carbonate. There were also indications for $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ flux into the SMTZ, which may suggest dolomite formation. The curvature of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}{}^{+}$ profile suggests production from organic matter degradation throughout the sediment column. Microbialmediated degradation is either conducted via a respiratory or fermentative pathway. According to the classical reduction scheme in sediments, only fermentation and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis occur below the SMTZ; however, at this site the Fe profile suggests that Fe reduction occurs below the SMTZ. Organic matter degradation also leads to the accumulation of DIC and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ in the interstitial water. The accumulation of these species, however, is much lower than that predicted by the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}+$ profile, assuming steady state and a constant ratio between $\mathrm{{C,\,N,}}$ , and $\mathrm{P}$ of remineralized organic matter. This suggests both production and consumption of DIC and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ in the sediment. Consumption of these species is most likely due to formation of apatite and calcium carbonates (e.g., dolomite). The interstitial water profiles suggest that rates of net consumption of $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ and DIC are the highest between 300 and $350\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. $C a^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ concentration profiles likewise indicate net consumption of these species between 300 and $350\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF.  

# Microbiology  

Samples for abundance of prokaryotes were collected adjacent to interstitial water whole-rounds in sections drilled using the APC. High-resolution sampling took place in the microbiology-dedicated cores as well as in additional samples taken once per core to APC refusal in Hole U1344A. Additional samples were taken from XCB Cores 323-U1344A-78X to 80X to evaluate cell abundance and community structure in the deepest portion of Hole U1344A. PFT analyses performed on these cores show no contamination from the drill fluid. Samples from all cores were fixed.  

It is of interest to examine the relationship between microbial productivity and diversity in the uppermost $25\,\mathrm{m}$ of the sediment column. Special attention will be directed toward the function of Archaea in the sulfate reduction zone, the SMTZ, and the methanogenesis zone. The sulfate-methane transition is a hot spot for microbial activity and abundance within deep-sea sediments (D’Hondt, Jørgensen, Miller, et al., 2003), and we will expect an increase in the abundance and activity of microbial life, while the remainder of the core should see a significant decrease with depth in both active and benign microbial life.  

# Physical properties  

The downhole profile of density for Hole U1344A is remarkably similar to that of Hole U1343E. The overall downhole increase in bulk density is interpreted to record compactive dewatering in a generally lithologically uniform sequence of fine-grained sediment. Magnetic susceptibility, as measured by the WRMSL, exhibits little change in average value and character with depth. Based on what was learned at previous sites, the rhythmic oscillations are presumed to be a function of lithologic composition and patterns of in situ sediment alteration.  

Except for the uppermost three cores in Hole U1344A, $P$ -wave velocity readings for the sedimentary section penetrated at this hole were only collected by the FMS-sonic downhole logging tool. Sonic $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocity data reveal a profile similar to that recorded in Hole U1343E in that the average velocity increases downsection in steplike sectors. Except for the uppermost ${\sim}80{-}100\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF, across which NGR readings increase from a near-surface measurement of \~25 count/s to ${\sim}34$ counts/s, NGR values at deeper depths oscillate around this average to the base of the Hole U1344A at 745 m CSF. Presumably, variations in counts per second reflect downhole changes in content of clay and siliciclastic minerals.  

Thermal conductivity measurements can be grouped into an upper and lower sequence. The upper vertical sequence displays an estimated average reading of ${\sim}0.905$ $\mathsf{W}/(\mathsf{m}\cdot\mathsf{K})$ and extends downhole from the near surface to $\sim\!260\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CSF},$ below which APC refusal caused a change to XCB coring and $V_{\mathsf{P}}$ shifts abruptly to higher readings. In Hole U1344A porosity decreases most rapidly in the upper part of the drilled section, falling to an average value of ${\sim}60\%$ at $80{-}100\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF. Below this depth, other than oscillating readings, there are no notable shifts in average value or changes in trend. The overall downhole decrease in porosity tracked by MAD and logging data is presumably a manifestation of compaction dewatering.  

The upper group of dry grain density, extending from the surface to ${\sim}160\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CSF},$ is ${\sim}2.70\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The middle sequence, from $\mathord{\sim}160$ to $620\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ , exhibits an average density of $2.65\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and the underlying basal group has a lower density of ${\sim}2.62\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . It appears that an overall uphole increase in deposition of denser siliciclastic mineral debris is recorded.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

The complete and continuous composite depth scale and splice at Site U1344 is constructed from 0.0 to $332.02\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A (Tables T24, T25). The continuous splice ranges from the top of Core 323-U1344A-1H to Section 323-U1344A-31X-5, $50\;\mathrm{cm}$ . The appended cores range from Cores 323-U1344A-32X to 79X ( $790.37\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A), with a constant affine value of $43.78\mathrm{~m~}$ . All splice points in the interval of $0{-}50\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A are clear and convincing based on multiple data types. The splice tie point between Sections 323-U1344A-5H-7, $4.44\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{~cm~}}$ , and 323-U1344D-6H-3, $79.88\ \mathrm{~cm~}$ ( $51.99\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A), is uncertain and could be moved ${\sim}2.4~\mathrm{m}$ shallower in Core 323-U1344D-6H with equal uncertainty. This is a point to be resolved with postcruise data. The splice tie points between Sections 323-U1344E-6H-6, $112.47~\mathrm{cm}$ , and 323-U1344A-6H-4, $122.06~\mathrm{cm}$ ( $60.40\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A), between Sections 323-U1344E-14H-1, $10.92~\mathrm{cm}$ , and 323-U1344D-14H-2, $136.02\;\mathrm{cm}$ ( $140.43\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A), and Sections 323-U1334A-16H7, $1.04~\mathrm{cm}$ , and 323-U1334D-17H-4, $1.34~\mathrm{cm}$ ( $175.52\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A), are uncertain because of low signal amplitude in magnetic susceptibility.  

# Downhole measurements  

Two tool strings were deployed in Hole U1344A: the triple combo and the FMS-sonic combination. Overall, the caliper of the density sonde shows an irregular borehole with a particularly large-diameter interval between 170 and $260\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{WSF}$ but with very good conditions in the lower section. Deeper in the borehole, small enlargements regularly spaced every ${\sim}9.5\mathrm{~m~}$ indicate where the bit was sitting whenever a core was recovered. However, all the calipers show that the tools made at least partial contact with the formation over most of the interval logged, suggesting that the overall quality of the data is good. Irregular hole size has an effect on measurements that require good contact with the formation, namely density and porosity. The anomalously low density values between 230 and $250\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WSF}$ within the $100\,\mathrm{m}$ interval with the largest hole size are probably erroneous, as are most neutron porosity measurements in this entire interval. The quality of the logs can also be assessed by comparison with the NGR and GRA track data and with the MAD measurements made on cores recovered from Hole U1344A. Except for two short intervals with lower density logging data (230–250 and $420–430\mathrm{\;m\;WSF}$ ), all density data sets are in good agreement, confirming overall good data quality despite the enlarged hole. Comparison of the gamma ray logs measured during the main pass of the two runs shows excellent repeatability.  

Logging Unit 1 $100–330\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WMSF})$ is characterized mainly by a steady increase with depth in ${\cal{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}$ and $V_{\mathsf{S}},$ whereas the other log data remain mostly uniform despite some variability such as in gamma radiation. The bottom of this unit is defined by a noticeable drop in $V_{\mathsf{P}},\ V_{\mathsf{S}},$ gamma radiation, density, and resistivity immediately above a sharp peak in these measurements, particularly in $V_{\mathsf{S}}$ and resistivity, indicating a fine, stiff layer. This sequence corresponds to a core with poor recovery. Logging Unit 2 $(330{-}460\mathrm{~m~WMSF})$ ) is almost uniquely defined by the ${\cal{V}}_{\mathsf{P}}$ and $V_{5}$ logs, both of which increase steadily through the unit. Gamma radiation and density also increase with depth in this unit in a more subdued manner. The top of logging Unit 3 $460{-}620\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF) is defined by an inflection in the velocity profiles, which, combined with a decreasing trend in density, generates the strong reflector at 4.83 s two-way traveltime. The variability with depth in gamma radiation and in most logs displays a cyclicity more clearly defined than in the upper units. Finally, the top of logging Unit 4 $(620{-}745\mathrm{~m~WMSF})$ ) is defined by a sharp increase in $V_{\mathsf{P}},\ V_{\mathsf{S}},$ gamma radiation, and density, as well as by a significant change in the trends of all the logs. As in the deepest unit of Site U1343, the gamma ray, potassium, thorium, density, resistivity, $V_{\mathsf{P}},$ and $V_{\mathsf{S}}$ logs all display a variability with depth of wider amplitude and lower frequency than in the upper units, suggesting a significant change in deposition history and rates.  

The APCT-3 tool was successfully deployed three times in Hole U1344A. The measured temperatures ranged from $4.51^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $47.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF to $9.57^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $142.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and closely fit a linear geothermal gradient of $53.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . The temperature at the seafloor was $1.65\mathrm{^\circC}$ based on the average of the measurements at the mudline during all the APCT-3 deployments. A simple estimate of the heat flow can be obtained from the product of the geothermal gradient and the average thermal conductivity (0.911 W/ $[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ , which gives a value of $48.5\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ , within the range of previous measurement in the area  

# Sedimentation rates  

Sedimentation rates observed at Site U1344 are mostly similar to values within a narrow range of $29{-}50\ \mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . throughout Holes U1344A, U1344D, and U1344E (Table T26). One exception is the interval between the top and the bottom of the Cobb Mountain Subchron (459.0–469.6 m CCSF-A), which resulted in $89\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ . Based on sedimentation rates, the bottom age of Hole U1344A was determined to be ${\sim}1.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Fig. F58).  

# Site U1345  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective of drilling at Site U1345 (prospectus Site NAV-1B) was to study high-resolution Holocene–late Pleistocene paleoceanography at a proximal gateway location to the Arctic Ocean at a water depth of ${\sim}1008\mathrm{~m~}$ . The drill site is located on an interfluve ridge near the large, broad head of Navarin submarine channel off the Bering Sea shelf (Figs. F1, F59, F60, F61, F62) (Normark and Carlson, 2003). We anticipated that this site received an ample supply of terrigenous sediments from the shelf during the glacials. This is also in the area of high biological productivity called the Green Belt. The Green Belt is formed by the BSC, which originates in the incoming Alaskan Stream water that flows through the western Aleutians into the Bering Sea (Taniguchi, 1984; Springer et al., 1996). Farther northwest, higher primary productivity and organic carbon is observed at the seafloor (Springer et al., 1996). Thus, past impingement by the dissolved OMZ was highly expected at this site. Because the expected sedimentation rates were high with intermittently laminated sediment of millimeter to submillimeter thickness (see below), we expected to be able to reconstruct detailed climate change of submillennial timescales. Therefore, we anticipated comparing data from this site with those of other pertinent high-resolution records from such places as the Santa Barbara Basin, the Cariaco Basin, and GISP2. It is also important to compare the vertical extent of water mass conditions on a basin-wide scale that includes the Bowers Ridge, gateway, and Umnak sites.  

Furthermore, this site is located close to the maximum extent of the present-day seasonal sea ice cover. Thus, we expected this site to have been extensively covered by seasonal or perennial sea ice during the glacial low sea level stands. Due to its proximity to the location of sea ice formation, where cold and dense brine is expelled when sea ice is formed, this site, as well as Site U1344, provides crucial information regarding the formation of the North Pacific Intermediate Water.  

This relatively shallow drill site in the gateway region to the Arctic Ocean can also be used to study the impact of subseafloor microbes on biogeochemical fluxes in the highest surface ocean productivity areas of the drill sites in the Bering Sea. Organicfueled subseafloor respiration and its impact on biogeochemistry in such a highly productive region has not previously been quantified. To do this, the drilled sediments in the gateway region were used to determine subseafloor cell abundance and to investigate the link between the mass and characteristics of subseafloor microbes and the extent of export productivity from the surface ocean (Takahashi et al., 2000).  

Reports of sedimentation rates at this site location vary significantly, ranging from 14 cm/k.y. during the Holocene and $91\ \mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . during the LGM to as much as $242\;\mathrm{cm}/$ k.y. during the deglaciation (Cook et al., 2005). Prior to drilling, recovery of sections from the Holocene to late Pleistocene were expected at this site.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Only one lithologic unit was recognized at Site U1345. Unit I comprises the same time period as Unit I at the other sites: the middle Pleistocene to the Holocene. Site U1345 is distinct among the near-shelf sites due to the abundance and generally coarser texture of the siliciclastic component in the sediments as well as the higher frequency of laminated intervals. Intervals characterized by ${>}25\%$ sand and by thin sandy layers occur at all depths in all the holes drilled at this site. The laminations and thin-bedded sediments are numerous and well correlated between holes.  

Site U1345 is located in the central portion of the modern OMZ. The sediments deposited at this site can provide important information concerning Pleistocene to Holocene variability of bottom water oxygen concentrations. The preservation of laminated and thinly bedded sediments (beds ${<}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ thick) could be interpreted as the result of a reduction of the activity of benthic macrofauna due to low oxygen concentrations in the bottom waters and surface sediments. Laminations do not have a clear signature in the physical property or reflectance data as observed at Site U1342.  

The laminated intervals can be divided into two categories based on the abundance of biogenic grains: (1) couplets or triplets of diatom oozes, mixed siliciclastic/biogenic sediments, and siliciclastic sediments, or (2) couplets of siliciclastic sediments of alternating textures that may include minor $(<\!40\%)$ amounts of diatoms. Laminated sediments of the first category are similar to laminated intervals at other sites, which are typically biogenic rich, olive-green, dark olive-gray, and very dark greenish gray. This category of lamination seems to occur mainly during interglacials. This relationship supports previous observations of higher flux of diatoms during interglacial compared to glacial periods (Okazaki et al., 2005). The second category of laminated sediments is mainly siliciclastic and unique to Site U1345. This type of lamination occurs in sediments that are tentatively identified as deposited during glacial conditions. Since these sediments are not biogenic rich, changes in intermediate water ventilation may have been the controlling parameter for bottom water oxygen concentrations during these periods.  

We observed intermittent finely disseminated authigenic carbonates deeper than ${\sim}30$ m CSF in all holes at this site. The SMTZ is at ${\sim}6.5\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF},$ , the shallowest observed during Expedition 323. Calcium and magnesium concentrations in the pore water decrease toward the SMTZ, suggesting active authigenic carbonate precipitation at and below this depth today.  

Few ash layers were observed at Site U1345. The ashes that do appear are light colored, suggesting that their source is explosive rhyolitic volcanism. This site is distant from the nearest likely source of volcaniclastic grains, the Aleutian arc, so the transport mechanism must have been one capable of widespread dissemination.  

The lithologies at Site U1345 are sandier than at any other site from Expedition 323. Lithologies with ${>}25\%$ sand and thin sandy layers occur throughout all holes. The presence of this coarse material is probably related to the position of Site U1345 at the crest of an interfluve at the mouth of Navarin Canyon. The siliciclastic grain sizes at Site U1345 contrast even more strongly with Site U1339, located on a submarine plateau isolated from the continental shelf. At the latter site virtually no sand-sized grains were recorded. This may be due either to decreased transport of terrigenous material to the site or to a high biogenic flux to Site U1339 sediments.  

# Biostratigraphy  

High-frequency variations can be seen in the abundance and composition of all microfossil groups. The decrease in sea ice diatoms, the increase in dinoflagellates, planktonic foraminifers, and calcareous nannofossils, and the percent of open ocean diatoms Neodenticula and Actinocyclus and the high-productivity dinoflagellate Islandinium minutum, which are associated with increases in the low-oxygen benthic foraminifer Bulimina aff. exilis, indicate the approximate depth intervals of distinct interglacials (at ${\sim}5$ , 40, 130, and $145\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A). These intervals also coincide with low GRA bulk density and are consistent with the age model.  

Overall, the distribution of calcareous nannofossils at Site U1345 seems to follow glacial–interglacial cyclicity with higher numbers during interglacials. Changes in their abundances generally reflect changes in environmental factors such as temperature and nutrients. Calcareous nannofossils do not become dominant components of the biota in areas of sea ice coverage. Elevated content of subpolar planktonic foraminifer species with G. bulloides appear at ${\sim}5$ , 40, 90, 130, and $145\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A, largely coinciding with the inferred interglacials. This shows increased sea-surface temperatures during these intervals. G. bulloides is controlled by temperature rather than food availability in the Bering Sea (Reynolds and Thunell, 1985; Asahi and Takahashi, 2007). These periods of elevated sea-surface temperatures probably reflect interglacial conditions.  

As at the previous Bering Sea sites, the benthic foraminifer assemblage faunal composition shows large changes in species dominance. These changes are interpreted as shifts in local oxygen concentrations associated with surface productivity and/or deepwater ventilation on Milankovitch timescales. Bulimina aff. exilis is generally regarded as a low-oxygen/deep infaunal species (Bubenshchikova et al., 2008; Kaiho, 1994) and occurs in samples associated with high productivity and low sea ice. This suggests that higher productivity during some interglacials may have caused an expansion and intensification of the OMZ.  

The LO of Proboscia curvirostris and the LO of Thalassiosira jouseae were observed from 71.1 to $73.3\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}_{}$ , depending on the hole, giving an age of $0.3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . In general, diversity is lower for this site than at the other gateway sites. The diatom assemblage for this zone (NPD11) is dominated by Thalassiosira antarctica spores, Fragilariopsis spp., Paralia sol, P. sulcata, Thalassiothrix longissima, Thalassionema nitzschioides, $T\!\!\!\phantom{\,\!}\!\!\!\cdot$ latimarginta s.l., and to a lesser extent Neodenticula seminae, Bacteriosira fragilis, and Actinocyclus curvatulus. The core interval above the LO of $P.$ curvirostris to the recent is assigned to Neodenticula seminae Zone NPD12. This zone is dominated by $T\cdot$ antarctica spores, T. latimarginta s.l., P. sulcata, T. hyalina, B. fragilis, and the minor presence of $N.$ . seminae and A. curvatulus. In general, this site reveals a higher proportion of coastal neritic diatoms, together with freshwater species, than the other gateway sites (Sites U1343 and U1344). Low proportions of sea ice diatoms and high proportions of open water diatoms correspond well with the interglacial horizons. The last occurrence of silicoflagellate Distephanus octonarius $[0.2–0.3\ \mathrm{Ma})$ was observed in Core 323-U1345A-9H (71.01–80.64 m CSF).  

Radiolarian zones at Site U1345 could not be established due to the absence of Stylatractus universus. Four radiolarian datums derived in the subarctic Pacific were identified at this site. The LO of Lychnocanoma nipponica sakaii $(50\;\mathrm{ka})$ and Spongodiscus sp. $280{-}320\ \mathrm{ka})$ were determined. The LOs of Amphimelissa setosa $(70-90\ \mathrm{ka})$ and Axoprunum aquilonium $(250{-}410\,\mathrm{ka})$ ) were supported only by seldom occurrences, indicating uncertain top positions of the stratigraphic age. Estimated sedimentation rates between the LO of $L$ . nipponica sakaii and Spongodiscus sp. are ${\sim}25~\mathrm{cm/k.y}.$ . in each hole. Among all radiolarian species, C. davisiana shows high fluctuations in abundance, possibly relating to ventilation changes with glacial–interglacial cycles. The Sphaeropyle langii/robusta group, which are commonly found at Sites U1343 and U1344, show very low abundances. Because abundances of Sphaeropyle langii/robusta group at the shallower Sites U1339, U1340, and U1342 were also very low, their dwelling depth might be in deep water below $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The dinoflagellate species Brigantedinium spp. is one of the most ubiquitous taxa among protoperidinials, and its distribution in modern sediments is closely related to primary productivity in temperate regions and also to polar and subpolar regions of the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans with seasonal sea ice coverage (Rochon et al., 1999). Islandinium minutum is one of the principal, if not the dominant, component of assemblages in the modern Arctic Ocean (Rochon et al., 1999; Head et al., 2001). The overall abundance of dinocysts and particularly the above-mentioned species suggests high productivity and upwelling during prominent interglacials. Extremely high abundances of dinocysts, especially at the mudline in Hole U1345B and Sections 323-U1345A-5H-CC (44.4 m CCSF-A) and 13A-CC (130.6 m CCSF-A) suggest interglacial periods. This coincides with relatively low pollen and spore concentrations.  

# Paleomagnetism  

No polarity reversal boundary was observed in the cores at Site U1345; therefore, the whole sequence is assigned to the Brunhes normal polarity zone (Fig. F63; Table T27). The relative paleointensity pattern is consistent with that seen at all other sites. Based on the correlations, MIS 1–12 were assigned. The significant changes in NRM indicate notable effects of early sediment diagenesis, as this has also been seen at the previous sites. Significant magnetic mineral dissolution starts within $5\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}$ due to processes related to AOM and sulfate reduction. This is also evident at Sites U1344, U1343, and U1339. The active zone of dissolution appears to be limited to the top $10~\mathrm{m}$ so that magnetization does not change significantly at deeper depths.  

# Geochemistry  

Of all the sites investigated, Site U1345 shows the shallowest SMTZ at ${\sim}6.25\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF (Fig. F64). Likewise, this site is characterized by the steepest flux of methane into this zone and the highest interstitial water hydrogen sulfide concentrations. Similar to the other shelf sites (Sites U1343 and U1344), the almost linear sulfate and methane profiles suggest that AOM coupled with sulfate reduction accounts for most of the sulfate consumption in the sediment. Preliminary modeling of the DIC profile suggests that net DIC production in the SMTZ accounts for $70\%$ of the DIC production in the top sediment layers. The organic matter degradation products phosphate and ammonium show accumulation in the pore water, with the distinct minimum in phosphate concentration between 22.25 and $27.25\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. However, this also indicates that the consumption of this species is most likely due to the formation of phosphate-bearing minerals such as apatite.  

The occurrence of high concentrations of interstitial water hydrogen sulfide in the SMTZ can be attributed to very high sulfate reduction rates at this depth and probably also to a lack of a sufficient pool of reactive Fe mineral phases (e.g., Fe [oxhydr]oxides) that can react with hydrogen sulfide on short timescales. Distinct peaks in dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations immediately below the SMTZ are the result of microbial dissimilatory Fe reduction. Calcium and magnesium profiles show depletion at the depth of the present SMTZ, suggesting the formation of authigenic Mg-rich carbonate (e.g., dolomite) driven by the production of DIC during AOM and an increase in pH leading to oversaturation of the pore water with respect to carbonate. Interestingly, the dissolved calcium profile shows a further decrease with depth and a minimum concentration at ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. This depth corresponds to a dolostone layer found at $40.27\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF. Sites U1343, U1344, and U1345 furthermore show high concentrations of dissolved Ba in the pore water and indicate a sink of this ion just above the SMTZ. The distribution of Ba at these sites can be attributed to diagenetic remobilization of Ba deposited as biogenic barite into the sulfate-depleted pore water (von Breymann et al., 1992). The upper end of the SMTZ where the sulfate and dissolved Ba profiles overlap marks the present front of authigenic barite formation.  

# Microbiology  

Samples for abundance of prokaryotes were collected adjacent to interstitial water whole-rounds. High-resolution sampling took place in the microbiology-dedicated cores as well as in additional samples taken once per core to APC refusal. It is of interest to examine the relationship between microbial productivity and diversity in the uppermost $25\textrm{m}$ of sediment dedicated for microbial ecology. A special focus will be directed toward the function of Archaea in the sulfate reduction zone, the SMTZ, and the methanogenesis zone. The sulfate–methane transition is a hot spot for microbial activity and abundance within deep-sea sediments (D’Hondt, Jørgensen, Miller, et al., 2003), and we will thus expect an increase in the abundance and activity of microbial life; the remainder of the core should see a significant decrease with depth in both active and benign microbial life. To obtain an estimate of active subseafloor life, samples were also taken in low resolution for catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) at all aforementioned zones and at depth.  

We will rely on estimates generated by shipboard participants (cell counts and geochemical profiles) and shore-based participants (amino acid and amino sugar composition) as indicators of productivity. We will examine overall bacterial and archaeal diversity by a combination of conventional 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) clone libraries and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and/or a new quantitative community fingerprinting method involving automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) (Ramette, 2009).  

# Physical properties  

Wet bulk densities in Hole U1345A appear to be higher by $0.1–0.2\mathrm{~g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ than those measured in Hole U1344A in the uppermost $150~\mathrm{m}$ of the sedimentary section; the higher densities of sediment in Hole U1345A probably reflect their higher sand content.  

Similar to stratigraphic sections drilled at Beringian margin sites (Sites U1343 and U1344), GRA density values in Hole U1345A also document rhythmic fluctuations. Magnetic susceptibility measurements seem to have realistically recorded the downhole contour of changing values that are functions of many factors. An explanation for the higher counts for the Hole U1345A section is its coarser and higher content of siliciclastic mineral debris. In the downhole profile the contour of NGR readings is broadly similar to that of GRA bulk density. The downhole distribution of thermal conductivity readings displays an overall trend of increasing conductivity. Downsection profiles of MAD-measured porosity and water content record a progressive decrease in average values. The downhole distribution of water content and porosity is rhythmic. Little change is seen in average grain density with depth. The higher average grain density $(2.75\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ of Unit I in Hole U1345A is interpreted to be a consequence of its greater abundance of coarse siliciclastic grains.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

The composite depth scale and splice at Site U1345 is complete and continuous from 0.0 to $167.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A (Tables T28, T29). The splice ranges from the top of Core 323- U1345A-1H to Section 323-U1345D-16H-7, $146.6~\mathrm{cm}$ . There are no appended intervals. Most of the splice points are clear and convincing based on the multiple copies of the section recovered in five holes. The splice tie point between Sections 323- U1345A-10H-4, $50.0\ \mathrm{cm}$ , and 323-U1345C-10H-1, 100.18 cm (9 $13.02\textrm{m}$ CCSF-A), is uncertain because Core 323-U1345A-10H contains disturbed flow-in starting approximately in the middle of Section 10H-4 and extending through the bottom of Section 10H-7. The disturbed section is not included in the splice. The splice tie point between Sections 323-U1345D-10H-7, $58.4\;\;\mathrm{cm}_{\cdot}$ , and 323-U1345A-11H-3, $115.4\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{~cm~}}$ (103.284 m CCSF-A), and between Sections 323-U1345D-13H-6, $138.4~\mathrm{cm}$ , and 323- U1345A-14H3, $94.7~\mathrm{cm}$ (133.637 m CCSF-A), are tentative because of low signal amplitudes in MS477. The cumulative offset between CSF and CCSF-D depth scales is roughly linear. The affine growth factor at Site U1345 is 1.11.  

# Downhole measurements  

The only downhole measurements made at Site U1345 were three deployments of the APCT-3 tool in Hole U1345A. The measured temperatures ranged from $4.92^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 42.4 m DSF to $8.15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $108.9\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF, indicating a local geothermal gradient of $48.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km}$ . A simple estimate of the heat flow can be obtained from the product of the geothermal gradient and the average thermal conductivity, which gives a value of $51.6\;\mathrm{mW}/$ $\mathbf{m}^{2}$ , in agreement with existing measurements in the area.  

# Sedimentation rates  

Based on the four holes studied, the following two mean radiolarian biostratigraphic datums were employed for the determination of sedimentation rates: the LO of Lychnocanoma nipponica sakaii and the LO of Spongodiscus sp. (Ling, 1973). Only one sedimentation rate of $28\,\mathrm{cm/k}$ .y. appears to be applicable to this site (Fig. F65; Table T30). This sedimentation rate is lower than that of the adjacent, deeper Site U1344 $({\sim}39\,\mathrm{cm}/$ k.y.).  

# Operations  

# Site U1339  

We arrived at Site U1339 early on 16 July 2009 after a 6.5 day, 1782 nmi transit from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and operations officially began.  

Four holes were drilled at Site U1339 (Table T2) employing the APC at a water depth of $1867~\mathrm{m}$ on Umnak Plateau, with the deepest Hole U1339D reaching a maximum depth of $200\,\textrm{m}$ DSF. One relatively shallow and three relatively deep holes were drilled and cored as follows: Hole U1339A, cored to $34\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF; Hole U1339B, cored to $196~\mathrm{m}$ DSF; Hole U1339C, cored to $195\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF; and Hole U1339D, cored to $200\textrm{m}$  

DSF. The first four cores of Hole U1339B (Cores 323-U1339B-1H to 4H) were primarily used for subseafloor microbial study with both PFTs and whirlpacks deployed. The remainder of the cores were used for paleoceanographic studies. Most of the cores had nearly $100\%$ or greater recovery because of gas expansion except for two short cores (Cores 323-U1339B-13H, $2\textrm{m}$ , and 323-U1339C-16H, $4.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ) that were recovered when the APC fired into an unknown object, most likely a glacial dropstone.  

# Hole U1339A  

Hole U1339A was spudded at $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 July 2009. The first core was shot with the bit at $1873\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF and recovered the mudline and $4.94\mathrm{~m~}$ of core. The hole was terminated after Core 323-U1339A-4H with a suspected bottom-hole assembly (BHA)/ coring system problem resulting in almost 100,000 lb of overpull on the last core. The drill string was tripped out of the hole, the coring system components were inspected, and several parts were changed. No conclusive evidence of the encountered mechanical problem was found. The BHA was run and the coring system was tested successfully in the water column.  

# Hole U1339B  

The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ , the rest of the string was tripped to the seafloor, and Hole U1339B was spudded at $2315\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 17 July 2009. The first four cores (Cores 323- U1339B-1H to 4H) were dedicated to microbiology with both PFTs and whirlpacks deployed. The remainder of Hole U1339B recovered the sedimentary sequence from the total depth of Hole U1339A down to $196\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, with one short core (Core 323- U1339B-13H) recovered when the APC fired into an unknown object, most likely a glacial dropstone. The nonmagnetic core barrel was switched to a steel core barrel when the resistance became exceedingly high with Core 323-U1339B-19H. Hole U1339B was cored to $196\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and coring ended at $2010\;\mathrm{h}$ on 18 July 2009 when the bit cleared the seafloor.  

# Hole U1339C  

The vessel was offset $28\;\mathrm{m}$ and Hole U1339C was spudded at $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 July 2009. The first core was more than $9.5\textrm{m}$ long but contained the mudline at its top. Core advance was a continuous $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ except for Core 323-U1339C-16H, which contacted an apparent dropstone at $4.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . The nonmagnetic core barrel was used through Core 323-U1339C-17H, and APC coring proceeded with a steel core barrel through Core 21H to $195.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The drill string cleared the seafloor at $1610~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 July 2009, officially ending Hole U1339C.  

# Hole U1339D  

The vessel was offset $28.3\textrm{m}$ and Hole U1339D was spudded at $1724\mathrm{~h~}$ on 19 July 2009. Core 323-U1339D-1H was $6.6\;\mathrm{m}$ long. All cores taken below the first one were $9.5\textrm{m}$ long with the exception of one short core resulting from premature firing of the APC. The nonmagnetic core barrel was used through Core 323-U1339D-17H, and APC coring proceeded with a steel core barrel through Core 22H to $200.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Rigup for wireline logging in Hole U1339D started at $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 July 2009. The triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings were deployed; both obtained good data. The drill string was pulled and secured for transit. Transit to the next site, Site U1340 (BOW12B), began at $0745\mathrm{~h~}$ on 21 July 2009. In all, APC coring for Site U1339 totaled 69 cores, $642.2\;\mathrm{m}$ penetrated, and $643.67\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered, for $103.1\%$ recovery.  

# Site U1340  

We arrived at Site U1340 at $2300~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 July 2009 after a 1.5 day, $344\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1339. Hole U1340A was spudded at $0520\,\mathrm{h}$ . A total of four holes, one relatively deep and three shallow, were drilled and cored employing the APC and XCB at a water depth of $1306\;\mathrm{m}$ on Bowers Ridge (Table T2). A complete set of site-specific tide tables was provided by the science party for Site U1340 and were used to make adjustments relative to initial mudline core and for each successive core in each hole. The APCT-3 temperature tool was deployed four times, and three out of four of the data points fell on a linear curve describing a temperature gradient of $+4.34^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ per 100 m of depth. Overall recovery for Site U1340 using the APC and XCB coring systems was $91.0\%$ .  

# Hole U1340A  

Hole U1340A was spudded at $0520~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 July 2009. Hole U1340A was cored to $603.6~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, employing both the APC and XCB. APC recovery was $100\%$ , whereas XCB recovery averaged $61\%$ . APC coring continued through Core 323-U1340A-17H to 1461.9 DRF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies with the FlexIt orientation tool installed. The standard steel coring assemblies were used from Cores 323-U1340A18H through 42H. APC coring was terminated after Core 323-U1340A-42H after two successive short, incomplete strokes of the core barrel. The XCB coring system was then deployed at Core 323-U1340A-43X and coring continued with the XCB system until Core 62X. After three straight zero-recovery runs, the APC coring system was redeployed. Coring with the APC system through Core 323-U1340A-67H was successful in recovering $\sim\!25\:\mathrm{m}$ of very sandy sediment. The XCB system was redeployed and the hole was terminated after Core 323-U1340A-71X when the XCB cutting shoe spacer sub failed, leaving a portion of the sub and the XCB cutting shoe at the bottom of the hole. The drill string was pulled back to the seafloor at $2103~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 July 2009, officially ending the hole. Shear pressures were consistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. Recovery for Hole U1340A using the APC coring system was $105.0\%$ with $398.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered. Recovery for Hole U1340A using the XCB coring system was $61.0\%$ with $136.7\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered. Combined recovery for Hole U1340A using both the APC and XCB coring systems was $88.7\%$ .  

# Hole U1340B  

Hole U1340B officially began when the bit cleared the seafloor at $2103~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 July 2009, ending Hole U1340A. The vessel was offset $350\,\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1340A. The top drive was picked up and the drill string was spaced out, placing the bit at $1305.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF or $5\textrm{m}$ above the “corrected” precision depth recorder (PDR) depth of $1310.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF. The first APC barrel was pressured up and fired, the barrel recovered $6.4~\mathrm{m}$ of core, and an official seafloor depth was established at $1308.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF. Hole U1340B was spudded at $2340\ \mathrm{h}$ on 25 July 2009. Nonmagnetic coring assemblies and the FlexIt core orientation system were used through Core 323-U1340B-6H. Hole U1340B ended at $0400~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 July 2009 when the bit cleared the seafloor. Shear pressures were consistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. Average core recovery for the APC was $103.0\%$ . Total depth of Hole U1340B was $1362.4\:\mathrm{m}$ DRF or $53.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF.  

# Hole U1340C  

Hole U1340C officially began when the drill string cleared the seafloor at $0400\ h\ 26$ July 2009. The ship was offset $300\,\mathrm{m}$ south from Hole U1340A. A new PDR depth was established and the bit was placed at $1313\,\mathrm{m}$ DRF to optimize the core breaks between Holes U1340A and U1340B. The APC was deployed and Hole U1340C was spudded at $0620\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 July 2009. Unfortunately, a mistake in the corrected PDR depth resulted in the first core being taken well below mudline. The $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered with the APC (Core 323-U1340C-1H) failed to establish the seafloor depth. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1340C-3H to $1341.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF using the FlexIt core orientation system and nonmagnetic coring assemblies. With the exception of the first core, shear pressures were consistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. Overall core recovery for the APC was $105.3\%$ . The drill string was pulled clear of the seafloor at $0835\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 July, officially ending Hole U1340C.  

# Hole U1340D  

Hole U1340D officially began when the drill string cleared the seafloor at 0835 h 26 July. The ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ from Hole U1340C at $180^{\circ}$ . This hole was spudded at $0905\;\mathrm{h}$ on 26 July, and the $7.3~\mathrm{m}$ recovered with Core 323-U1339D-1H established a seafloor depth of $1304.7\:\mathrm{m}$ DRF. Three APC cores were shot to $26.3\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF. APC coring through Core 323-U1340D-3H used the nonmagnetic coring assemblies with FlexIt orientation. Shear pressures were consistent throughout the coring process at 2800 psi. APC core recovery was $103.5\%$ . The drill string was then pulled clear of the seafloor and secured for transit. Once the drill collars were racked back and the rig floor was secured for transit, control was transferred from dynamic positioning (DP) to the bridge. The ship was placed in cruise mode at $1534~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 July for the scheduled 6 h $\mathrm{1\,\,(65\nmi)}$ transit to Site U1341 (BOW-14B). Official APC coring totals for Site U1340 included 83 total cores, $712.3\;\mathrm{m}$ penetrated, and $648.1\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered, for $91.0\%$ recovery.  

# Site U1341  

A positioning beacon was deployed at 2311 h on 26 July after our arrival at Site U1341. Three holes were drilled at this site (Table T2). A complete set of site-specific tide tables was provided by the science party for Site U1341, and these were used to make adjustments relative to initial mudline core and for each successive core on each hole. A new continuous APC coring depth record was established when Hole U1341B reached $458.4\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. APC coring totals for Site U1341 included 148 total cores, $1189.4\:\mathrm{m}$ penetrated, and $1201.54\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered, for $101\%$ recovery. The time spent at Site U1341 was $170.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 7.1 days.  

# Hole U1341A  

Hole U1341A was spudded at $0510\;\mathrm{h}$ on 27 July. The first APC barrel recovered 3.04 m of core and an official seafloor depth was established at $2150.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1341A-20H to $2334.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies and with the FlexIt orientation tool installed. The nonmagnetic coring equipment was changed to the standard APC coring system and coring continued. Coring with the APC system was suspended at Core 323-U1341A-41H after two successive short, incomplete strokes of the core barrel. Overall recovery for Hole U1341A using the APC coring system was $101\%$ with $364.94\:\mathrm{m}$ recovered.  

# Hole U1341B  

The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1341A. Hole U1341B was spudded at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 July. The first APC barrel recovered $8.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of core and an official seafloor depth was established at $2150.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1341B18H to $166.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies and with the FlexIt orientation tool installed. Coring with the APC system was suspended at Core 323- U1341B-56H after three successive short, incomplete short strokes of the core barrel. A new continuous APC coring record was established with continuous piston cores from the mudline to $458.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF or CSF. The XCB coring system was then deployed from Cores 323-U1341B-57X through 71X. The hole was terminated after Core 323- U1341A-71X when the total depth of the hole reached $600.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. APC core recovery for Hole U1341B was $102\%$ with $467.64\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered. XCB core recovery for Hole U1341B was $88.2\%$ with $126.9\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered. Total core recovery was $98.7\%$ with 594.5 m recovered. The coring tools were secured and the hole was swept clean and then displaced with $200~\mathrm{bbl}$ of high-viscosity logging mud. No fill was identified at total depth. The top drive was set back and the drill pipe was tripped to $80\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF while monitoring the hole for problems. The end-of-pipe (EOP) was placed at ${\sim}80.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Rig-up for wireline logging began at $1930\;\mathrm{h}$ on 31 July. Two logging strings were deployed. The triple combo tool string reached a total hole depth of $600\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ and good quality logs were obtained. The FMS-sonic tool string also reached total depth of $600\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ and also obtained good data on both passes. Wireline logging in Hole U1341B was successfully concluded and all logging equipment was rigged down by $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 August.  

# Hole U1341C  

Operations in Hole U1341C commenced at $1555\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 1 August. The vessel was moved $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1341B. Hole U1341C was spudded at $1810\,\mathrm{h}$ . The first APC barrel recovered $5.5\:\mathrm{m}$ of core and an official seafloor depth was established at 2150.9 m DRF. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1341C-17H to $147~\mathrm{m}$ DSF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies and with the FlexIt orientation tool installed. Standard steel core barrels were then installed and coring continued through Core 323- U1341C-27H ( $230\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF). Overall core recovery for the APC was $242.06\:\mathrm{m}$ $\left.106.2\%\right)$ .  

# Site U1342  

Four holes were drilled at this site. The first was cored using the APC system to refusal. When refusal was met early, the XCB system was deployed to confirm formation material. The XCB recovered $0.5\textrm{m}$ of basalt, effectively ending Hole U1342A. The second hole, U1342B, was dedicated to microbiology. Hole U1342C was cored with the APC system to $45.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The last hole, U1342D, was APC cored to $44.0~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. At that point, a center bit was dropped and the hole was drilled ahead for $18.6\;\mathrm{m}$ to determine if the basalt was continuous or not. At a drilling break, the XCB system was deployed and used to take 13 cores of hard rock to the total hole depth of $127.4\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. A complete set of site-specific tide tables was provided by the science party for Site U1342. The tide tables were used to make adjustments relative to initial mudline core and for each successive core in each hole. APC coring totals included $182\,\mathrm{m}$ penetrated with $194.11\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered (a recovery of $106.7\%$ ). XCB coring totals for Site U1342 included $66.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration with $41.54\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered ( $62.8\%$ recovery). The total cored interval was $248.1\;\mathrm{m}$ with $235.65\mathrm{~m~}$ of core recovered for a $95\%$ total recovery. The time spent at Site U1342 was $33.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 1.4 days.  

# Hole U1342A  

Hole U1342A was spudded at $1320\;\mathrm{h}$ on 3 August, recovering $1.8~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment in the first APC barrel and establishing an official seafloor depth of $829.7\textrm{m}$ DRF. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1342A-8H to $49.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Coring with the APC system was suspended after two successive short, incomplete strokes of the core barrel and apparent refusal. Three meters were then drilled with the APC/XCB bit and the XCB system was deployed; a short core $\left(1\textrm{m}\right)$ was drilled to identify the material at APC refusal. Basalt was recovered and Hole U1342A was terminated. Overall recovery for Hole U1342A using the APC coring system was $115.5\%$ with $56.93\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered. Recovery for the XCB core was $0.46\;\mathrm{m}$ or $46\%$ recovery.  

# Hole U1342B  

The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1342A. Hole U1342B was spudded at $2315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 August. The barrel recovered $5.33~\mathrm{m}$ of core, and an official seafloor depth was established at $830.4\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1342B-5H to $43.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

# Hole U1342C  

The vessel was moved $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1342B. The first APC barrel recovered 7.2 m of core and an official seafloor depth was established at $830.3\,\mathrm{m}$ DRF. Hole U1342C was spudded at $0235\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 4 August. APC coring continued through Core 323- U1342C-6H to refusal. Overall recovery for Hole U1342C using the APC coring system was $103.7\%$ with $47.06\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered.  

# Hole U1342D  

The vessel was moved $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1342C. The first APC barrel recovered 6.0 m of core and an official seafloor depth was established at $829.7\,\mathrm{m}$ DRF. Hole U1342D was spudded at $0830\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 4 August. APC coring continued through Core 323- U1342D-5H to $873.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF. On reaching refusal, the center bit was dropped and the hole was drilled $18.6~\mathrm{m}$ to see if there were sediments under the layer of hard rock (basalt). After a drilling break was observed, the XCB coring system was deployed and used successfully to core an additional $65.10\;\mathrm{m}$ into the formation. Overall recovery for Hole U1342A using the APC coring system was $102.9\%$ with $45.29\textrm{m}$ recovered. Recovery with the XCB core was $41.08\;\mathrm{m}$ or $63.1\%$ recovery.  

# Site U1343  

Five holes were cored at Site U1343. Hole U1343A was cored with the APC system and drilled to $201.5\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Hole U1343B was dedicated to microbiology and cored to 35.5 m DSF. Hole U1343C was cored with the APC system to $234.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Only a single mudline core was taken in Hole U1343D and a decision was made to attempt another mudline core for stratigraphic correlation. Hole U1343E was cored with the APC and XCB systems to $744.3\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The XCB system was used for Cores 323-U1343E-42X through 45X, where we encountered dry sediment and retrieved a destroyed core liner (42X), and for the deepest cores (Cores 323-U1343-50X through 83X). The shallower interval cored with the XCB system coincided with a BSR. Generally, coring was routine except for biogenic methane encountered in the cores, which complicated the curation of all cores at this site. APC coring totals for Site U1343 included 98 cores, $860.4\;\mathrm{m}$ penetrated, and $859.8\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered for $99.9\%$ recovery. XCB coring totals for Site U1343 included 37 cores, $360.6\:\mathrm{m}$ penetrated, and $318.14\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered for $62.8\%$ recovery. The total cored interval for Site U1343 was $1221.0\ \mathrm{m}$ , with $1178.23\mathrm{~m~}$ of core recovered for a $96.5\%$ total recovery. The time spent at Site U1343 was 6.7 days.  

# Hole U1343A  

Hole U1343A was spudded at $0305\mathrm{~h~}$ on 7 August. The first mudline core recovered $5.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and the seafloor was calculated at $1962.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1343A-22H to $201.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies. Temperature measurements were taken on Cores 323-U1343A-5H, 9H, and 14H with the APCT-3 temperature tool. Core orientation was taken on all cores with the FlexIt orientation tool, but the data were lost when the computer running the download software was accidentally switched off during the FlexIt operations, causing the program to lose its synchronization with the tool. Overall recovery for Hole U1343A using the APC system was $101.2\%$ with $203.86\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered.  

# Hole U1343B  

The vessel was offset $30\;\mathrm{m}$ north and Hole U1343B was spudded at $2240\;\mathrm{h}$ on 7 August. The first mudline core recovered $6.85\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and the seafloor was calculated at $1962.4\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF. Both PFT and microsphere contamination testing methods were deployed. A total of four APC cores were recovered for microbiological sampling to $35.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Average APC core recovery for Hole U1343B was $97.4\%$ with $34.56\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered.  

# Hole U1343C  

The ship was offset $30\,\mathrm{m}$ west from the proposed site position. The APC was deployed and Hole U1343C was spudded at $0305\;\mathrm{h}$ on 8 August. The first mudline core recovered $7.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and the seafloor was calculated at $1964.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1343C-26H to $234.2\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies. Overall recovery for Hole U1343C using the APC coring system was $98.7\%$ with $231.04\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered.  

# Hole U1343D  

Hole U1343D was spudded $30\,\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1343C at $0135\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 August. Based on the stratigraphic correlation of the first and only core, Hole U1343D was terminated at $0135\,\mathrm{h}$ . Overall recovery for Hole U1343D using the APC coring system was $100.0\%$ with $8.5\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered.  

# Hole U1343E  

There was no offset from Hole U1343D. Hole U1343E was spudded at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 August. The first core barrel recovered $8.2~\mathrm{m}$ of core and an official seafloor depth was established at $1967.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1343E-15H using standard steel core barrels. At Core 323-U1343E-16H, the nonmagnetic barrels were put in service and used for the rest of the hole. Coring with the APC system was suspended after Core 323-U1343E-41H was pulled with a ruptured core liner. Core 41H had to be hydraulically pressed out of the core barrel. This coincided with a BSR observed in the seismic data. The core was also noticeably drier and harder at this depth. The XCB coring system was then deployed from Cores 323-U1343E-42X through 45X with good recovery. The APC coring system was then put back in service for Cores 323-U1343E-46H to 49H. At that time we began to get partial strokes of the piston and were having to drill over every core. The XCB system was redeployed and coring continued through Core 323-U1343E-83X to $744.3\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The coring tools were secured and the hole was swept clean and then displaced with 200 barrels of prepared high-viscosity logging mud. No fill was identified at total depth. Two logging strings were deployed. The triple combo tool string reached total depth of $745\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and good quality logs were obtained. The second logging string consisted of the FMSsonic tool, which reached total depth of $745\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and also obtained good data on both passes. Wireline logging in Hole U1343E was successfully concluded and all logging equipment was rigged down by $0745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 August. APC core recovery for Hole U1343E was $100.3\%$ with $381.86\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered. XCB core recovery for Hole U1343E was $88.3\%$ with $318.41\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered. Total core recovery for Hole U1343E was $94.47\%$ with $700.27\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered.  

# Site U1344  

Five holes were cored at Site U1344. The first hole was cored with the APC/XCB systems to $745.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Hole U1344A was then successfully logged with the triple combo and FMS-sonic logging tool strings. The second hole, planned as a dedicated microbiology hole, was cut short due to contamination when the core liner split during mudline coring. Therefore, the third hole was assigned to microbiology. Hole U1344D was cored with the APC system to $286.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The last hole, Hole U1344E, was cored with the APC system to $202.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. A complete set of site-specific tide tables provided by the science party was used to make adjustments relative to initial mudline core and for each successive core in each hole. Coring in general was routine except for biogenic methane encountered in the cores, which complicated the curation of all cores at this site. APC coring totals for Site U1344 included 87 cores, 781.8 m penetrated, and $791.1\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered for $101.2\%$ recovery. XCB coring totals for Site U1344 included 52 cores, $489.9\;\mathrm{m}$ penetrated, and 384.1 recovered for $78.4\%$ recovery. The total cored interval for Site U1344 was $1271.7\;\mathrm{m}$ with $1175.19\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered for a $92.4\%$ total recovery. The time spent at Site U1344 was 8.5 days.  

# Hole U1344A  

The first APC barrel recovered $9.1\textrm{m}$ of core and an official seafloor depth was established at $3183.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF. Hole U1344A was spudded at $0932\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 August. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1344A-26H to $245.6\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies. The XCB system was deployed and coring continued through Core 323-U1344A-79X to $745.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF. The coring tools were secured and the hole was swept clean and then displaced with 200 barrels of prepared high-viscosity logging mud. No fill was identified at total depth. The EOP was placed at ${\sim}100.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Two logging strings were deployed. The triple combo tool string reached total hole depth of $745\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF and good quality logs were obtained. The second logging string consisted of the FMS-sonic tool. This tool string also reached total depth of $745\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF on the first pass but reached only $725\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF on the second pass as hole conditions began to deteriorate. Good data were obtained on both passes. APC core recovery for Hole U1344A was $103.5\%$ with $264~\mathrm{m}$ recovered. XCB core recovery for Hole U1344A was $78.4\%$ with $384.1\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered. Total core recovery for Hole U1344A was $87\%$ with $648.1\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered.  

# Hole U1344B  

The vessel was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1344A. Hole U1344B was spudded with the APC at $1335\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 August. One APC core was recovered. Unfortunately, Core 323- U1344B-1H came to the surface with a split/damaged core liner and was unfit for microbiological studies.

APC coring continued through Core 323-U1344C-25H to $224.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF using nonmagnetic coring assemblies. The nonmagnetic coring equipment was changed to the standard APC coring system and coring continued. Coring with the APC system was suspended after Core 323-U1344D-32H at $286.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Only two cores, Cores 323-U1344D-30H and 32H, required drill over. Overall recovery for Hole U1344D using the APC coring system was $99.9\%$ with $286.1\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered.  

# Hole U1344E  

The ship was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ north from Hole U1344D. The first APC barrel recovered 5.3 m of core and an official seafloor depth was established at $3185.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF. Hole U1344E was spudded at $0750~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August. APC coring continued through Core 323-U1344E-23H using nonmagnetic coring assemblies. Coring was uneventful and continuous except for a $3\;\mathrm{m}$ section at $3276.5\:\mathrm{m}$ DRF, which was drilled at the request of the stratigraphic correlator. APC core recovery for Hole U1344E was $101.4\%$ with $202.7\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered.  

# Site U1345  

Five holes were cored at this site. With the exception of Hole U1345B, which was cored to $36.7~\mathrm{m}$ DSF for microbiological sampling, four holes were cored to ${\sim}150~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. A complete set of site-specific tide tables was provided by the science party for making coring adjustments relative to the initial mudline core and for each successive core in each hole. Coring in general was routine except for biogenic methane encountered in the cores, which complicated the curation of all cores at this site. Two complete splices were obtained at Site U1345 to ${\sim}150\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF. APC coring totals for Site U1345 included 68 cores, $632.1\;\mathrm{m}$ penetrated, and $648.35\:\mathrm{m}$ recovered for $102.6\%$ recovery. The time spent at Site U1345 was 2.2 days.
