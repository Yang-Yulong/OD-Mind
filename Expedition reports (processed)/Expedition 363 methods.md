# Introduction  

This section documents the procedures and methods employed in the shipboard laboratories on the R/V JOIDES Resolution during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 363. This information applies only to the shipboard work described in the Expedition Reports section of the Expedition 363 Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of Expedition 363 data and samples will be described in separate, individual publications. This introductory section provides an overview of operations, curatorial conventions, depth scale terminology, and general core handling and analyses.  

# Site locations  

GPS coordinates from precruise site surveys were used to position the vessel at all Expedition 363 sites. A SyQuest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloor depth on the approach to each site to reconfirm the depth profiles from precruise surveys. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters were lowered, and a positioning beacon was dropped to the seafloor. The dynamic positioning control of the vessel used navigational input from the GPS system and triangulation to the seafloor beacon, weighted by the estimated positional accuracy. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over a portion of the time the hole was occupied.  

# Coring and drilling operations  

Three standard coring systems, the advanced piston corer (APC), the half-length advanced piston corer (HLAPC), and the extended core barrel (XCB) were used during Expedition 363. The coring strategy typically consisted of APC coring to the depth limit of the system, referred to as APC refusal, in two or three holes (typically A, B, and C) at each site. Multiple holes were cored at each site to build a composite depth scale and a stratigraphic splice for continuous subsampling after the expedition (see Curatorial procedures  and  sample  depth  calculations  and  Stratigraphic correlation). At some sites, APC refusal was followed by HLAPC coring to refusal. We also utilized the XCB coring system once we reached HLAPC refusal at Sites U1482, U1489, and U1490.  

The APC was used in the upper portion of each hole to obtain high-quality cores. The APC cuts soft-sediment cores with minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems. After th e APC core barrel is lowered through the drill pipe and lands near th e bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until the two shear pins that hol d the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barre l then advances into the formation and cuts the core (Figure F1). Th e driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke,” from the pressur e gauge on the rig floor.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in two ways: (1) the pisto n fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from the pum p pressure reading) because the formation is too hard or (2) excessiv e force $^{>60,000}$ lb; ${\sim}267\,\mathrm{kN}$ ) is required to pull the core barrel out o f the formation. When a full stroke could not be achieved, additiona l attempts were typically made, and after each attempt the bit was advanced by the length of recovered core. The number of additiona l attempts is generally dictated by the length of recovery of the partia l stroke core and the time available to advance the hole by piston coring. Note that this process results in a nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ based on the assumption that the barrel penetrates the formation b y the equivalent of the length of core recovered. When a full or partia l stroke is achieved but excessive force cannot retrieve the barrel, th e core barrel is sometimes “drilled over,” meaning that after the inne r core barrel is successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit is advanced to total depth to free the APC barrel.  

The standard (full) APC system contains a $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, whereas the HLAPC system uses a $4.8\textrm{m}$ core barrel. In mos t cases, the HLAPC is deployed after the full APC reaches refusal. During the use of the HLAPC, we applied the same criteria for refusal as with the full APC system. Use of this technology allowed fo r deeper continuous piston coring than would have otherwise bee n possible with the standard APC.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used during all APC coring to  a pull force of ${\sim}40{,}000$ lb. Steel core barrels were used for the XC B system. In addition, full-length APC cores recovered during Expedition 363 were oriented using the Icefield MI-5 or FlexIT core orientation tools (see Paleomagnetism). We also used the advance d piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) to obtain in situ formatio n temperatures in the first deep hole at each site to determine the geothermal gradient and estimate heat flow (see Physical properties). At Site U1489, we collected a second set of APCT-3 formation temperature measurements in Hole U1489D because the data fro m Hole U1489B showed disturbances likely resulting from excessiv e ship motion.  

The XCB system was used to advance the hole when APC o r HLAPC refusal occurred before the target depth was reached o r when the formation became either too stiff for APC coring or har d substrate was encountered. The XCB is a rotary system with a smal l cutting shoe that extends below the large rotary APC/XCB bit. Th e smaller bit can cut a semi-indurated core with less torque and flui d circulation than the main bit, optimizing recovery. The XCB cuttin g shoe (bit) extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediment s but retracts into the main bit when hard formations are encountered (Figure F2).  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) constitutes the lowermos t part of the drill string. The configuration of the BHA is reported i n the operations section in each site chapter. A typical APC/XC B BHA consists of a drill bit (outer diameter $=11\%$ inches), a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub,  a modified head sub, a nonmagnetic drill collar (for APC/XCB),  a number of $8\%$ inch $({\sim}20.32~\mathrm{cm)}$ drill collars, a tapered drill collar, six joints (two stands) of $5\%$ inch $({\sim}13.97~\mathrm{cm})$ drill pipe, and on e crossover sub. A lockable float valve was used when downhole log

ging was planned so that downhole logs could be collected throug h the bit. In some cases, the drill string was drilled or “washed” ahea d without recovering sediments to advance the drill bit to a targe t depth to resume core recovery. Such intervals were typically drille d using a center bit installed within the APC/XCB bit.  

# IODP depth scales  

Primary depth scale types are based on the measurement of dril l string length deployed beneath the rig floor (drilling depth belo w rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]), the lengt h of core recovered (core depth below seafloor [CSF] and core composite depth below seafloor [CCSF]), and the length of the loggin g wireline deployed (wireline log depth below rig floor [WRF], wireline log depth below seafloor [WSF], and wireline log matche d depth below seafloor [WMSF]). All depth units are in meters. Th e relationship between scales is defined either by protocol, such as th e rules for computation of CSF from DSF, or by combinations o f protocols  with  user-defined  correlations  (e.g.,  CCSF).  Th e distinction in nomenclature should keep the user aware that  a nominal depth value at two different depth scales usually does no t refer to exactly the same stratigraphic interval (see Curatoria l procedures and sample depth calculations). For more information on depth scales, see “IODP Depth Scales Terminology” a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines.  To  more  easil y communicate shipboard results, CSF-A depths are reported in thi s volume as meters below seafloor (mbsf) unless otherwise noted.  

![](images/f830a7029afef89acfeae4dc08752b1c3e14c5bd96ecef3c7a77eb749250c7b2.jpg)  
Figure F2. Schematic of the XCB system used during Expedition 363.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF scale). The depth of the cored interval is referenced to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth at the time of th e first core from the DRF depth of the interval. During Expeditio n 363, the seafloor depth is the length of pipe deployed minus th e length of the mudline core recovered.  

Standard depths of cores on the CSF-A scale are determine d based on the assumptions that (1) the top depth of a recovered cor e corresponds to the top depth of its cored interval (DSF scale) an d (2) the recovered material is a contiguous section even if core segments are separated by voids when recovered. Voids in the core ar e closed by pushing core segments together, if possible, during cor e handling. This convention is also applied if a core has incomplet e recovery, in which case the true position of the core within th e cored interval is unknown and should be considered a sample dept h uncertainty, up to the length of the core barrel used, when analyzin g data associated with the core material. Standard depths of subsamples and associated measurements (CSF-A scale) are calculated b y adding the offset of the subsample or measurement from the top o f its section, as well as the lengths of all shallower sections in the core, to the top depth of the cored interval.  

A soft to semisoft sediment core from less than a few hundre d meters below seafloor expands upon recovery (typically a few percent to as much as $15\%$ ), so the length of the recovered core can exceed that of the cored interval. Therefore, a stratigraphic interval may not have the same nominal depth at the DSF and CSF scales i n the same hole. When core recovery (the ratio of recovered core t o cored interval) is ${>}100\%$ , the CSF depth of a sample taken from th e bottom of a core will be deeper than that of a sample from the top o f the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated with the two core intervals overlap on the CSF-A scale).  

CCSF depth scales are constructed for sites, whenever feasible , to mitigate the CSF-A core overlap problem, as well as the corin g gap problem and to create as continuous a stratigraphic record a s possible. Using shipboard core logger–based physical property data, verified with core photos, core depths in adjacent holes at a site ar e vertically shifted to correlate between cores recovered in adjacen t holes. This process produces the CCSF depth scale. The correlatio n process results in affine tables, indicating the vertical shift of core s on the CCSF scale relative to the CSF-A scale. Once the CCSF scal e is constructed, a splice can be defined that best represents the stratigraphy of a site by utilizing and splicing the best portions of individual sections and cores from each hole. Because of core expansion, the CCSF depths of stratigraphic intervals are typically $10\%{-15\%}$ deeper than their CSF-A depths. CCSF depth scale constructio n also reveals that coring gaps on the order of $1.0{-}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ typically occur between two subsequent cores, despite the apparent ${>}100\%$ recovery. For more details on construction of the CCSF depth scale, see Stratigraphic correlation.  

# Core handling and analysis  

Cores recovered during Expedition 363 were extracted from th e core barrel in $67~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter plastic liners. These liners were carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwal k outside the Core Laboratory, where they were split into ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections. Liner caps (blue $=$ top; colorless $=$ bottom; yellow $=$ wholeround sample taken) were glued with acetone onto liner sections o n the catwalk by the marine technicians. The length of each sectio n was entered into the database as “created length” using the Sampl e Master application. This number was used to calculate core recovery.  

As soon as cores arrived on deck, headspace samples were take n using a syringe for immediate hydrocarbon analysis as part of th e shipboard safety and pollution prevention program. Core catche r samples were taken for biostratigraphic analysis. Whole-roun d samples were taken from some core sections for shipboard an d postcruise interstitial water analyses.  

Whole-round core sections were immediately run through th e Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) when necessary fo r stratigraphic correlation after being cut on the catwalk. The STMS L measures gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density and magneti c susceptibility and is used to aid in real-time stratigraphic correlation. For Sites U1488 and U1490, low magnetic susceptibility mad e stratigraphic correlation difficult and so the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) was used as the “fast track” logging syste m to quickly measure $P$ -wave velocity (see Stratigraphic correlation and Physical properties). After measurement, these cores wer e placed on the core racks in the laboratory. Cores not run throug h the STMSL or WRMSL first were immediately placed in core rack s after being cut on the catwalk. When the cores reached equilibriu m with laboratory temperature (typically after ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{~h~}$ ), whole-roun d core sections were run through the WRMSL and the Natura l Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL). For Sites U1488 and U1490, th e STMSL was used to collect higher resolution magnetic susceptibility and GRA bulk density data when the WRMSL was employed a s the fast track. Additionally, we also ran some core sections throug h the NGRL prior to equilibration to speed up core flow through th e laboratory. Thermal conductivity measurements were typicall y taken at a rate of one per core (see Physical properties). The cor e sections were then split lengthwise from bottom to top into workin g and archive halves. Investigators should note that older materia l may have been transported upward on the split face of each sectio n during splitting.  

The working half of each sedimentary core was sampled fo r shipboard (biostratigraphy, physical properties, carbonate, paleomagnetism, and X-ray diffraction [XRD]) analyses. The archive hal f of all cores was scanned on the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL ) with a line scan camera at 20 pixels/mm and measured for colo r reflectance and magnetic susceptibility on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). At the same time, the archive halves wer e described visually and by means of smear slides and thin section s (see Core description). All observations were recorded in th e Laboratory  Information Management  System  (LIMS; http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/LORE/) database using the DESClogi k descriptive data capture application. After visual description, th e archive halves were run through the cryogenic magnetometer (se e Paleomagnetism). Finally, digital color close-up images were take n of particular features of the archive or working halves, as requeste d by individual scientists. All samples taken are recorded by the IOD P curator. Sampling for personal postcruise research was deferred until a postcruise sampling meeting; however, shipboard residues wer e made available for scientists to request for postcruise analyses t o guide personal sampling during the sampling meeting.  

In preparation for storage, soft-sediment section-half cores wer e wrapped in plastic wrap. Sites U1484 and U1485 contain high tota l organic carbon and low carbonate content. In order to preserve th e carbonate, the cores were shrink-wrapped with oxygen scrubbers. After wrapping, both halves of the core were put into labeled plasti c tubes that were sealed and transferred to cold storage space aboar d the ship. At the end of the expedition, the cores were transporte d from the ship to cold storage at the Gulf Coast Repository (GCR) a t Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. Shore-based sampling of the cores for postcruise research took place at the GCR ${\sim}6$ months after the end of the expedition. Following the samplin g meeting and completion of X-ray fluorescence core scanning, th e cores were shipped to permanent cold storage at the Kochi Cor e Center (KCC) at Kochi University in Kochi, Japan. The KCC house s cores collected from the western Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, an d Bering Sea.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed as a result of the drillin g process and contain extraneous material as a result of the corin g and core handling processes. In formations with loose sand layers, sand from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down by drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom of the hole, and be sampled with the next core. The uppermost $10{-}50\,\mathrm{cm}$ of each core mus t therefore be examined critically during description for potential “fall-in.” Common coring-induced deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Pisto n action may result in fluidization (flow-in) at the bottom of APC an d HLAPC cores. Retrieval from depth to the surface may result i n elastic rebound. Gas that is in solution at depth may become fre e and drive core segments within the liner apart. Both elastic reboun d and gas pressure can result in a total length for each core that is longer than the interval that was cored and thus a calculated recover y of ${>}100\%$ . If gas expansion or other coring disturbance results in  a void in any particular core section, the void can be closed by movin g material if very large, stabilized by a foam insert if moderately large, or left as is. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved fo r safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the liner, which forces some sediment, as well as gas, out of the liner. These disturbances are described i n the Core description sections in each site chapter and graphicall y indicated on the core summary graphic reports (visual core descriptions [VCDs]). In extreme instances, core material can be ejecte d from the core barrel, sometimes violently, onto the rig floor by hig h pressure in the core or other coring problems. This core material was replaced in the plastic core liner by hand and should not b e considered to be in stratigraphic order. Core sections so affected ar e marked by a yellow label marked “disturbed,” and the nature of th e disturbance is noted in the coring log.  

# Curatorial procedures and sample depth calculations  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples follows standar d IODP procedure (Figure F3). Drilling sites are numbered consecutively from the first site drilled by the D/V Glomar Challenger i n 1968. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 301 began using the prefix “U” to designate sites occupied by the United State s Implementing Organization (USIO) platform, the JOIDES Resolution. For all IODP drill sites, a letter suffix distinguishes each hol e drilled at the same site. The first hole drilled is assigned the sit e number modified by the suffix “A,” the second hole the site numbe r and the suffix ${}^{\infty}\mathrm{B},{}^{\prime\prime}$ and so on.  

![](images/0783570d1ca3a7856b14bf1a53779e8a50e683f1381004294d1f0036da834eae.jpg)  
Figure F3. IODP conventions used for naming sites, holes, cores, and sample s during Expedition 363.  

Cores taken from a hole are numbered sequentially from the to p of the hole downward. When an interval is drilled down, this interval is also numbered sequentially and the drill down designated by  a $^{\ast}1^{\ast}$ instead of a letter that designates the coring method used (e.g., 363-U1482B-191). Cores taken with the APC system are designate d with “H,” “F” designates HLAPC cores, and ${}^{\infty}\mathrm{X}^{\prime\prime}$ designates XC B cores. Core numbers and their associated cored intervals are uniqu e in a given hole. Generally, maximum recovery for a single core is 9. 5 m of sediment (APC) or $9.7\textrm{m}$ of sediment (XCB) contained in  a plastic liner $.6.6\;\mathrm{cm}$ internal diameter) plus an additional ${\sim}0.2~\mathrm{m}$ i n the core catcher, which is a device at the bottom of the core barre l that prevents the core from sliding out when the barrel is retrieve d from the hole. In certain situations, recovery may exceed the 9.5 o r $9.7~\mathrm{m}$ maximum. In soft sediments, this is normally caused by cor e expansion  resulting  from  depressurization.  High  heave,  tida l changes, and overdrilling can also result in an advance that differ s from the planned $9.5/9.7\mathrm{~m~}$ .  

Recovered cores are typically divided into $1.5\,\mathrm{m}$ sections that ar e numbered serially from the top downward, although occasionall y sections will be cut slightly longer or shorter than $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ . When ful l recovery is obtained, the sections are numbered 1–7, with the las t section usually being $_{<1.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ . Rarely, an unusually long core may require more than seven sections. When the recovered core is shorte r than the cored interval, by convention the top of the core is deeme d to be located at the top of the cored interval for the purpose of calculating (consistent) depths. In sedimentary cores, the core catche r (CC) section is treated as a separate section. When the only recovered material is in the core catcher, it is placed at the top of th e cored interval.  

A full curatorial sample identifier consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, and interval in centimeters measured from the top of the cor e section. For example, a sample identification of “363-U1482C-2H-5, $80{-}85~\mathrm{cm},^{\prime\prime}$ represents a sample taken from the interval between 8 0 and $85\;\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 5 of Core 2 (collected using th e APC system) of Hole C of Site U1482 during Expedition 363 (Figur e F3).

# Core description  

The descriptions of the sediment cores recovered during Expedition 363 are based on a combination of visual core descriptio n (VCD), smear slide and thin section examination under a petrographic microscope, XRD, digital color imaging, spectrophotometry, and visual color determination. The methods employed ar e adapted from those used during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Le g 199 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 320/321 (Expedition 320/321 Scientists, 2010; Mazzullo et al., 1988), and 323 (Expedition 323 Scientists, 2011).  

# Visual core description  

VCDs of the archive half of the split cores provide a summary o f the lithologic, age (based on biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy), and physical property data obtained during shipboar d analyses (Figure F4). IODP VCDs are equivalent to the “barrel sheets” used during the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and ODP. Lithologic data for VCDs are recorded digitally in real time usin g the  DESClogik  software  application  (version  16.1.0.7;  se e DESCWKB in Supplementary material). Prior to operations,  a spreadsheet template with five tabs was constructed in Tabular Dat a Capture and customized for Expedition 363. The tabs were used t o record the following information:  

• Drilling disturbance,   
• General (lithologic core description and bioturbation intensity), • Detail (higher level detail than general core description),   
• Core summary (written description of major lithologic findings by core, lithologic unit, and age), and   
• Hole summary (lithologic unit and age).  

To aid core description, core data are displayed graphically i n LIMSpeak, a separate browser-based application that displays cor e images alongside physical property and geochemical data. Visual core description was initially carried out on paper printouts o f VCDs. Reporting included notes and observations, drawings of sedimentary structures, Munsell colors, and the location of sample s collected for smear slides and XRD. The VCD form used was base d on Mazzullo et al. (1988; figure 7). The handwritten notes were the n transferred into Desklogic.  

The Strater software package was used to compile the VCDs fo r each core. Site, hole, and core number are given at the top of th e VCD together with a summary core description. The written description for each core contains a succinct overview of major an d minor lithologies, their Munsell colors, and notable features such a s sedimentary structures and major disturbances resulting from th e coring process (Figure F4). Core depth below seafloor (mbsf), cor e length (recorded in centimeters), section breaks, lithologic unit, an d age are indicated along the left side of the digital color image of th e core. The two columns between the color image and the graphi c lithology columns show the locations of shipboard samples an d tephra (ash) layers. Columns to the right of the graphic litholog y column show drilling disturbance, bioturbation intensity, lithologi c accessories, sedimentary structures, and physical property data collected by the WRMSL and SHMSL (see Physical properties) . These include natural gamma radiation (NGR), lightness $\left(\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\right)$ an d color $\mathbf{\ddot{a}}^{*}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) as determined by color reflectance, and magneti c susceptibility. Symbols used in the VCDs are given in Figure F5.

adjustable angles to the lens axis. Note that compression of linescanned images into compiled stacks (like the core image shown i n the VCDs) may result in visual artifacts (e.g., the false appearance o f lamination).  

The SHIL images the flat face of the archive half of the spli t cores using a line-scan camera. Sediment cores are split, and the archive half is scraped with the edge of a glass slide or stainless stee l rectangular plate to provide a “clean” surface for imaging. Th e cleaned, flat face of the archive section halves are imaged as soon a s possible after splitting and surface scraping to minimize colo r changes that may occur through oxidation and drying. Images ar e taken at an interval of 10 lines/mm. Camera height is preadjusted s o that image pixels are square. Light is provided by three pairs of Advanced Illumination high-current focused LED line lights with full y  

# Sediment classification  

Our approach for sediment classification consists of two parts:  a principal name (e.g., silt) and one or more prefixes (e.g., foraminifer-rich; foraminifer- and clay-rich). The principal name applied t o a sediment is determined by the component or group of components making up ${>}60\%$ of the sediment. For example, sedimen t composed of $70\%$ silt-sized siliciclastic material and $30\%$ foraminifers would be classified as a foraminifer-rich silt. The namin g scheme for sediments with subequal mixtures of biogenic and siliciclastic and/or volcanogenic material is described below (see Mixe d sediment). Visual percentage estimates of biogenic, nonbiogenic, and textural features (grain size) are made from smear slides following the visual estimate methods reported by Rothwell (1989) (Figur e F6) (see Smear slide description for more details). The principa l names are determined as follows.  

![](images/0c175568089b0544791c08d0517416b3da9c67c93c034201325c56939cedf930.jpg)  
Figure F5. Symbols used for VCD graphic reports, Expedition 363.  

# Siliciclastic sediment  

If total siliciclastic content is ${>}60\%$ , the principal name is determined by the texture of the siliciclastic grains (i.e., the relative proportions of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains when plotted on  a modified Shepard [1954] ternary classification diagram) (Figur e F7A). The siliciclastic principal names are clay, silt, sand, silty clay, sandy clay, clayey silt, sandy silt, clayey sand, and silty sand.  

# Biogenic sediment  

If total biogenic content is ${>}60\%$ (i.e., siliciclastic is $<\!40\%$ ), th e principal name applied is ooze, chalk, or chert depending on the degree of lithification and composition. Ooze refers to biogenic sediment that can be deformed with a finger. Chalk refers to a n indurated sediment mainly composed of calcareous microfossil s showing  different  degrees  of  preservation  that  can  be  easil y scratched with a fingernail. Chert is used for dominantly siliceou s lithologies which display conchoidal fracturing and semitransparent, glassy luster. Note that in some cases the complete recrystallization of the original biocalcareous or biosiliceous components ca n make identification of the original (prediagenesis) sediment difficul t or impossible. Moreover, nonbiogenic particles of amorphous silic a (e.g., volcanogenic glass) can also recrystallize during diagenesi s and produce indurated siliceous rocks that have characteristics similar to those composed of biogenic particles. The major modifie r consists of the name(s) of the major fossil group(s) composing a t least $40\%$ of the biogenic fraction. Biogenic components are not described in textural terms. Thus, the principal name of sedimen t containing $65\%$ sand-sized foraminifers and $35\%$ siliciclastic clay i s foraminifer ooze, not foraminifer sand.  

# Volcanogenic sediment  

Volcanogenic sediments are composed of more than $60\%$ volcanogenic grains. Volcanogenic sediments include volcanogenics (volcanogenic detritus that is produced by erosion of volcanogeni c rocks by wind, water, and ice), pyroclastic sediments including volcanogenic ash and tephra (fragments of rock that are produce d when magma or rock is explosively ejected), and hydroclastic sediments (the products of the granulation of volcanogenic glass b y steam explosions). The principal name applied to sediment containing ${>}60\%$ ash (i.e., siliciclastic and biogenic components total ${<}40\%$ ) is ash. Ash components, like biogenic components, are not described in textural terms.  

As mentioned in the previous section, the diagenesis of sediments dominated by ash can create siliceous rocks that have characteristics similar to the biogenic-derived ones and they have bee n identified as chert.  

# Mixed sediment  

Mixed sediment includes sediment in which no one type of sedimentary component (siliciclastic, biogenic, or volcanogenic) i s

![](images/9a161943c319f66f3206e09e19527de907bcb409bc2c4229d0483aa0d8caee91.jpg)  

dominant $(>\!60\%)$ . If siliciclastic grains compose $40\%{-}60\%$ of th e sediment, the principal name is determined by the texture of the siliciclastic grains. For example, the principal name of a sample containing $10\%$ ash, $40\%$ diatoms, and $50\%$ siliciclastic grains that ar e $>\!75\%$ silt sized is a diatom silt. If the abundances of diatoms and siliciclastic grains were reversed (i.e., $50\%$ diatoms and $40\%$ siliciclastic), the principal name is still diatom silt, as neither comprise s ${>}60\%$ of the sediment.  

If ash and biogenic components each comprise between $40\%$ and $60\%$ of the sediment, the principal name is ash. The major modifier consists of the name of the major fossil group. For example, th e principal name of a sample containing $5\%$ siliciclastics, $10\%$ foraminifers, $40\%$ nannofossils, and $45\%$ ash is nannofossil ash.  

# Prefixes  

If a sediment type composes $5\%{-}40\%$ of the sediment and thi s group is not included as part of the principal name, minor modifier s are used. When a microfossil group, a siliciclastic group, or as h composes $10\%{-}40\%$ of the sediment, a minor modifier consisting o f the component name hyphenated with the suffix “rich” (e.g., diatom-rich clay, silt-rich foraminifer ooze) is used. When a microfossi l group, siliciclastic group, or ash composes $5\%{-}10\%$ of the sediment, a minor modifier consisting of the component name hyphenate d with the word “bearing” (e.g., diatom-bearing clay, ash-bearin g clayey silt) is used. When two minor components are present, mi

nor modifiers are listed before the principal name in order of increasing abundance. For example, sediment with $15\%$ foraminifers, $30\%$ nannofossils, and $55\%$ clay is foraminifer-rich nannofossil-ric h clay; a sediment with $5\%$ diatoms, $15\%$ radiolarians, and $80\%$ clay i s diatom-bearing radiolarian-rich clay (Figure F7B).  

# Smear slide description  

One or more smear slide samples of the main lithologies wer e collected from the archive half of each core to define the lithologies. Additional samples were sometimes collected to characterize mino r lithologies and small-scale sedimentary structures such as laminations and ash layers. A small amount of sediment was taken b y toothpick from the cores and dispersed evenly in deionized wate r on a glass slide to create a very thin (less than ${\sim}50\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ uniform laye r of sediment grains for quantification. The dispersed sample wa s then dried on a hot plate. A drop of mounting medium (Norlan d optical adhesive 61) and a cover glass were added, and then the slid e was placed in an ultraviolet light box for $15\;\mathrm{min}$ to cure.  

Smear slides were examined and photographed with a Zeis s transmitted-light petrographic microscope (Axioskop USG90207 ) equipped with a standard eyepiece micrometer. Visual percentag e estimates of biogenic, nonbiogenic, and textural features were mad e from each slide using a $40\times$ objective. Biogenic and mineral component percentage abundances were visually estimated followin g Rothwell (1989) (Figure F6). Grain size distributions of clay $(<\!4\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , silt $(4{-}63\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and sand $(>\!63\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ were estimated using an eyepiec e micrometer, calibrated using an inscribed stage micrometer. Th e texture of siliciclastic grains (relative abundance of sand-, silt-, an d clay-sized grains) and the proportions and presence of biogenic an d mineral components were recorded on a smear slide sample shee t (Figure F8). Because sand-sized and larger grains are difficult to incorporate into a smear slide, analyses may underestimate thei r abundance. Clay minerals can also be difficult to identify, due t o their small size.

# Spectrophotometry, visual color determination, and point magnetic susceptibility  

Spectrophotometry and point magnetic susceptibility of the archive section halves were measured with the SHMSL. The SHMS L was set to take measurements every $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ , with the exception o f empty intervals, cracks, and intervals where the top surface was below the level of the core liner. This was done to avoid spurious measurements. Magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartingto n Instruments MS2E point sensor (high-resolution surface-scannin g sensor). Because the SHMSL demands flush contact between th e magnetic susceptibility point sensor and the split core, measurements were made on the archive halves of split cores that were covered with clear plastic wrap. Measurement resolution is 1.0 SI, an d each measurement integrated a volume of $10.5\ \mathrm{mm}\times\,3.8\ \mathrm{mm}\times\,4$ mm, where $10.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ is the length perpendicular to the core axis, 3. 8 mm is the width along the core axis, and $4\;\mathrm{mm}$ is the depth into th e core. Only one measurement was taken at each measurement position.  

Reflectance of visible light from the archive halves of sedimen t cores was measured using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer mounted on the automated SHMSL. Measurements wer e taken at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ spacing to provide a high-resolution stratigraphi c record of color variation for visible wavelengths. Each measuremen t was recorded in $2\,\mathrm{nm}$ wide spectral bands from 400 to $700\,\mathrm{nm}$ . Dat a are converted to $L^{\ast}$ , $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ , $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ and X, Y, Z color reflectance parameter s for efficient archival and display. Both zero and white calibration s were conducted before measurement on each core. Additional detailed information about measurement and interpretation of spectral data can be found in Physical properties, Balsam et al. (1997, 1998), and Balsam and Damuth (2000).  

In addition to the digital color image captured by the SHIL , VCDs include a description of sediment color and the corresponding hue, value, and chroma data as determined qualitatively usin g Munsell Soil Color Charts for each major and minor litholog y (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 1994).  

# Sedimentary structures  

Sedimentary structures formed by natural processes (i.e., not  a result of drilling disturbance) are represented on the VCD wit h symbols in the Sedimentary structures column (see Figure F5 fo r structure symbols). Structures formed by both biogenic and physical processes are included.  

An estimate of bioturbation intensity is indicated on the VCD . Bioturbation intensity is classified as  

• Absent: laminated sediment;   
• Slight: sediment with still-visible horizontal bedding;   
• Moderate: sediment with obvious burrows;   
• Heavy: sediment with a nearly uniform appearance and rare burrows; and   
• Complete: completely uniform (homogeneous) sediment with no obvious burrows or sedimentary layers.  

When identifiable, ichnofossils such as Zoophycos, Chondrites, Planolites, and Skolithos burrows were reported in the lithologic description. All contacts between lithologies are gradational unles s otherwise specified.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Sediment disturbance resulting from the coring process (e.g. , fall-in, flow-in, biscuits, and drilling breccia) is illustrated in th e Drilling disturbance column on the VCD. The depth interval an d the degree of disturbance are represented on the VCD using a grayscale color bar. Blank regions indicate an absence of drilling disturbance. Disturbance intensity is described using the followin g subjective scheme:  

• Slight to moderate: bedding contacts are slightly bent or bowed;   
• Moderate: bedding contacts strongly bent or bowed;   
• Moderate to high: bedding contacts are disturbed but are likely still in the correct stratigraphic sequence;   
• High: bedding contacts are present but are likely not in the correct stratigraphic sequence; and   
• Destroyed: sediment shows no traces of the original bedding or structure.  

Types of drilling disturbances observed in soft and firm sediment include the following:  

• Fall-in: out-of-place material at the top of a core that has fallen downhole onto the cored surface (this type of disturbance is considered high to destroyed);  

• Bowed: bedding contacts are slightly to moderately deformed but still subhorizontal and continuous (this type of disturbance is considered slight to moderate);   
• Upward-arching: material retains its coherency, with material closest to the core liner bent downward. This is most apparent when horizontal features are distorted (this type of disturbance is considered slight to moderate);   
• Void: empty space within the cored material (e.g., caused by gas expansion during core retrieval). Voids may also be related to partial strokes during the coring process (this type of disturbance is considered destroyed);   
• Flow-in, coring/drilling slurry, along-core gravel/sand contamination: soft-sediment stretching and/or compressional shearing structures are severe and are attributed to coring/drilling. The particular type of deformation may also be noted (e.g., flow-in, gas expansion, etc.) (this type of disturbance is considered high to destroyed);   
• Soupy or mousse-like: intervals are water saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding (this type of disturbance is considered high to destroyed);   
• Biscuit: sediment of intermediate stiffness shows vertical variations in the degree of disturbance. Softer intervals are washed and/or soupy, whereas firmer intervals are relatively undisturbed (this type of disturbance is considered moderate to high);   
• Cracked or fractured: firm sediment is broken during drilling but not displaced or rotated significantly (this type of disturbance is considered moderate); and   
• Fragmented or brecciated: firm sediment that is pervasively broken by drilling and may be displaced or rotated (this type of disturbance is considered moderate to destroyed).  

# Volcanogenic ash  

Volcanogenic ash layers $>\!1\ c\mathsf{m}$ thick are identified on the VC D to the left of the Graphic lithology column. Ash color and thicknes s are logged in DESClogik. In the site reports we also differentiate between tephra layers composed predominantly of glass shards, scoria, and pumice based on smear slide analysis, visual inspection o f the core, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging. Furthermore, at sites where ash layers occur regularly, bulk sampl e XRD analyses were performed on 3 or 4 representative ash layers.  

# Definition of lithologic units and subunits  

Each site drilled during Expedition 363 was divided into units t o highlight major lithologic changes downhole. These were established where a prominent change in sediment lithology matche d changes in other sediment characteristics including color reflectance, magnetic susceptibility, and other physical properties. Whe n more subtle yet significant changes were observed within a unit, th e unit was further divided into subunits. Units are numbered in orde r from the top of the stratigraphic succession using Roman numerals. Subunits are distinguished from the main lithologic units by addin g a letter to the unit number.  

# Shipboard sampling  

VCDs display the locations of sample material taken for shipboard analysis (whole-round and discrete samples taken to aid cor e description). Whole-round samples consist of material taken for interstitial water and paleontological analyses. Samples taken to ai d core description include toothpick samples for microscopic analyses using both transmitted light and scanning electron microscopy, as well as $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ samples for mineralogical XRD analysis; moisture and density (MAD); weight percent carbonate, carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen; and paleomagnetism. Typically, one smear slid e was prepared and examined per core; however, the number o f smear slides analyzed was adjusted depending on the degree o f lithologic variability in various parts of the core.  

# SEM and XRD analysis  

SEM imaging of the bulk sediment as well as lithologic accessories (i.e., concretions) was performed to confirm smear slide identification of major and trace lithologic components using a Hitach i Tabletop TM3000 scanning electron microscope. The sample wa s mounted on a stub and secured on an exchange rod inside a vacuu m chamber. If image quality was low, the sample was sputter coate d with an ultrathin coating of gold palladium. Sputter coating reduce s sample charging and improves secondary electron emission, whic h improves the signal-to-noise ratio. SEM images are available fro m the LIMS database.  

Bulk sample XRD analyses were performed to assess lithologi c components using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor X-ray diffractomete r with a Vantec detector using Ni-filtered CuKα radiation. The number of XRD analyses depended on the degree of lithologic complexity in various parts of the core. Generally, we analyzed ${\sim}5{-}10$ samples per site to assess the mineralogy of the bulk sediment an d lithologic accessories. Samples were freeze-dried, ground in a metal ball mill, and top-mounted onto a sample holder prior to analysis. Instrument settings were as follows:  

Voltage $=40\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
Goniometer sca $\mathrm{n}=2^{\circ}–70^{\circ}26$ (air-dried samples).   
Step $\mathrm{size}=0.01^{\circ}26$ .   
Scan speed $=1.2^{\circ}2\theta/\mathrm{min}$ .   
Count time $=0.5\:\mathrm{s}$ .  

Bulk sample diffractograms were interpreted using the EV A software package, which enabled mineral identification and basi c peak characterization (e.g., baseline removal and maximum pea k intensity). Digital files are available from the LIMS database.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthi c foraminifers were studied in core catcher samples at all sites. A t most sites, samples from split core sections were also examined fo r both calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers as tim e allowed to provide more refined age determinations or to investigate where significant changes in lithology occurred. Nannofossil s and planktonic foraminifers were used for biostratigraphy, and benthic foraminifers were used mainly to acquire estimates of paleobathymetry. Biostratigraphy focused mainly on the identification o f biostratigraphic horizons (biohorizons) in the cores, generally th e top (T) or base (B) of the stratigraphic range of a species, but als o including top common (Tc) and base common (Bc) occurrences. For nannofossils, the top acme (Ta), base acme (Ba), base paracm e (Bpa), and the crossover in abundance between two species (X ) were  also  used;  for  planktonic  foraminifers,  coiling  directio n changes in certain species were used.  

Identification of a sequence of biohorizons in stratigraphic order allowed the identification of biostratigraphic zones (biozones; often referred to simply as “zones”) and subbiozones (“subzones” ) using standard schemes. Biohorizons are assumed to result from biological events (bioevents) in the past, such as migrations, extinctions, and evolutionary transitions. These biohorizons have bee n assigned absolute ages based on calibrations from other areas, mainly referenced to the paleomagnetic reversal timescale. Thes e ages may or may not be accurate for the study sites because of diachrony and/or imprecise calibration. In some instances, we adopte d revised calibrations based on experience during the expedition; these are highlighted on the relevant data tables.  

The timescale used for Expedition 363 is that of Gradstein et al. (2012; GTS2012). Age assignments for bioevents are quoted on th e astronomically tuned Neogene timescale of Hilgen et al. (2012; ATNTS2012) as used in Gradstein et al. (2012) and using recent compilations of bioevents for both planktonic foraminifers (Wade et al., 2011) and calcareous nannofossils (Raffi et al., 2006; Backman et al., 2012).  

For division of the formal series of the timescales and their geochronologic equivalent epochs, we use informal subseries/subepoch terms such as “upper Pliocene” when referring to strata an d “late Pliocene” when referring to time. These have a lower cas e modifier to emphasize their informal status in accordance wit h long-established DSDP/ODP/IODP policy, including the curren t style guidelines, and in accordance with a recent (2016) vote held b y the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary subcommissions of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (Finney and Bown, 2017; Pearson et al., 2017). We have not routinely used formal stages/age s such as Piacenzian, although these are shown in Figures F9 and F10. A special problem arises in the Pleistocene series where the International Chronostratigraphic Chart current at the time of Expedito n 363 (version 2016/04; available at http://www.stratigraphy.org) indicates a formal Upper Pleistocene and Middle Pleistocene at th e rank of stage. These terms are temporary placeholders for geographic names that are currently under discussion and awaitin g formal ratification and definition (M. Head, Chair of the Subcommission for Quaternary Stratigraphy, pers. comm., 2016), whic h may be why they are given in italics on the chart. Therefore, w e avoid these terms, although we do refer to upper/late Pleistocen e and middle Pleistocene informally at the subseries rank with a lowercase modifier in a way that is consistent with our use of lowe r Pleistocene, upper Pliocene, and so on, as described above.  

All paleontological data gathered during shipboard investigations are available from the LIMS database in accordance wit h IODP policy. Data are in the form of taxonomic occurrence table s by sample studied for each hole and each taxonomic group (calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers). These data are provisional because taxonomic concept s evolved with experience during drilling, and time was insufficient t o cross-check, intercompare, and revalidate all recorded occurrence s and relative abundance estimates in the way that would be done in  a more mature laboratory-based investigation. In particular, the stud y time that could be allocated to each sample was necessarily mor e limited than it would be otherwise, for instance in the search fo r rare species. The tables are also incomplete because the focus i s mainly on biostratigraphic marker species close to their biohorizo n levels plus other occurrences that were deemed interesting or noteworthy at the time (e.g., rare or unexpected species), whereas common species of little stratigraphic value are generally omitted. Th e taxonomic occurrence tables are also used to record suspected reworked or otherwise out-of-place species (e.g., through downhol e contamination), although they are not distinguished as such. Th e provisional, incomplete, and systematically biased nature of the dat a makes them unsuitable for inclusion in meta-analytical studies tha t attempt to synthesize or compare patterns of species distribution s or diversity in time or space.  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Calcareous nannofossil assemblages were examined and described from standard smear slides made from core catcher sample s (at ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals) and from mudline samples in multiple holes a t each site. Additional toothpick samples were taken between cor e catcher samples from working half core sections when necessary t o refine the stratigraphic position of bioevents. Typically, this sampling was at a resolution of 3 samples per core taken from one hol e per site. Standard smear slides were made from bulk sediment. A t sites where volcanogenic ash particles are very abundant, the sediment was sieved to isolate the ${<}20\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction, which was the n centrifuged and smeared onto microscopic slides. Slides were fixe d with Norland optical adhesive Number 61 and cured under UV ligh t for immediate biostratigraphic examination using a Zeiss Axioscope. Samples were analyzed under plane-transmitted, cross-polarized, phase-contrast, and/or circular-polarized light using oil immersion at a magnification of $1000\times$ . All photomicrographs wer e taken using a SpotFlex camera with the IODP image capture software. Additional observations with a Hitachi TM3000 tableto p SEM were made to identify Emiliania huxleyi and verify the preservation state of calcareous nannofossils.  

Nannofossil taxonomy follows Perch-Nielsen (1985), Aubr y (1988, 1990), Young (1998), and Young and Bown (2014) as compiled  in  the  online  Nannotax  3  database  (http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3). The compilations of Aubry (2015) were use d as an additional taxonomic reference where necessary. The zonal scheme of Martini (1971) was used for calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy (Neogene alphanumeric shorthand NN code) (Figure s F9, F10; Table T1). This zonation represents a general framewor k for the biostratigraphic classification of middle- to low-latitud e nannofossil assemblages. The zonal scheme of Okada and Bukr y (1980; CN code), which provides a secondary framework that i s more detailed in some intervals, is also shown. Zone NN13‒NN1 4 is undifferentiated due to difficulties in placing the Bc occurrence o f Discoaster asymmetricus and the poor calibration of this event (se e discussion in Backman et al., 2012).  

Biohorizons and bioevents were compiled from a range o f sources, with assigned ages derived from the calibrations listed i n Table T1 updated to ATNTS2012. A full taxonomic list for the bioevents is given in Table T2.  

The following qualitative abundance codes were used in th e DESClogik data entry program and uploaded to the LIMS database.  

Total calcareous nannofossil abundance within the sedimen t was recorded as  

$\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $590\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of sediment particles).   
$C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $\langle>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $\!\!\:(1\%\!-\!10\%)$ of sediment particles).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none present).  

Abundance of individual calcareous nannofossil taxa is based o n specimens per field of view (FOV) at $1000\times$ magnification:  

$\mathrm{V}=$ very abundant $>\!100$ specimens per FOV) $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (10–100 specimens per FOV). $C=$ common (1–9 specimens per FOV). $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per 2–10 FOV).  

Figure F9. Biostratigraphic framework from 0 to 12 Ma, Expedition 363. For calcareous nannofossils, the zonal schemes of Martini (1971; NN code, as reference d in all site chapters) and Okada and Bukry (1980; CN code) are indicated for comparison. Ba $=$ base acme, Bc $=$ base common, Ta $=$ top acme, Tc $=$ top common. Note that Zones NN13 and NN14 are undifferentiated.

${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen per 11–100 FOV). $\mathbf{P}=$ present (1 specimen per ${>}100$ FOV).  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils was recorded as  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization, no alteration of primary morphological characteristics, and specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization; primary morphological characteristics unaltered or only slightly altered; specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (specimens exhibit some etching and/or recrystallization; primary morphological characteristics somewhat altered; however, most specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (specimens were severely etched or overgrown; primary morphological characteristics largely destroyed; fragmentation has occurred; specimens often could not be identified at the species and/or generic level).

Planktonic foraminifers  

Planktonic foraminifers were examined from core catcher samples and 3 additional samples per core from a minimum of one hol e at most sites except for the high-sedimentation Sites U1484 an d U1485, where only core catcher samples were examined. Planktoni c foraminifers were also examined from mudline samples from th e top of most holes as described in Benthic foraminifers.  

Sample volumes of 10 or $20~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ were washed over 150 and 6 3 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieves, and then the two separated size fractions were dried on  a hot plate at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Empty sieves were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath t o minimize cross-contamination between samples and then rinsed i n water dyed with methylene blue to stain any remaining foraminifer s and highlight any contaminants in subsequent samples. Dried residues $_{>150}$ and $63{-}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fractions) were transferred to labele d glass vials from which subsamples were examined on metal trays using binocular Zeiss Discovery V8 stereomicroscopes. Occasiona l specimens of special interest were removed for SEM study, but i n general planktonic foraminifers were not picked (partly because th e same residues were subsequently used to estimate planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratios).  

Most shipboard work focused on the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction fo r biostratigraphic purposes, but the $63{-}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction was also examined for marker species and to assess fragmentation and scan fo r the smaller species. Selected specimens were imaged using a Spo t RTS system with IODP image capture and commercial Spot software for photomicrographs. A Hitachi TM3000 tabletop SEM wa s used for higher magnification micrographs (primarily wall textur e examination) of selected specimens.  

The list of biohorizons and their age assignments and zona l schemes (Table T3) follows Wade et al. (2011; table 3) with tw o modifications:  

1. The list was edited to be relevant to the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean only. 2. The generic assignments of some species were updated according to Spezzaferri et al. (2015) and Pearson and Wade (2015).

Table T2. Taxonomic list for calcareous nannofossil bioevents, Expeditio n 363. Download table in CSV format.  

A full taxonomic list for the planktonic foraminifer bioevents i s given in Table T4.  

Alphanumeric shorthand is given for the zones and subzones i n Figures F9 and F10 and throughout the site chapters; the forma l names are as in Wade et al. (2011) except that Zone PL6 is now th e “Globigerinoidesella fistulosa Highest Occurrence Zone” because o f the generic redesignation of the marker species. This zone is retained as Zone PL6 (where PL is shorthand for Pliocene) despite th e fact that it now lies wholly within the Pleistocene series followin g the nontraditional (from the point of view of most deep-sea studies ) definition of the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary at $2.59\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Gibbard et al., 2010).  

The following planktonic foraminifer abundance categories relative to total sediment particles were estimated from visual examination of the dried sample in the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction as  

$\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant $530\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle10\%{-}30\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $5\%$ to ${<}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $1\%$ to $<\!5\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren.  

Abundances of planktonic foraminifer species in their respective size fractions were estimated using the following scheme:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $>\!20\%$ of the planktonic foraminifer assemblage).   
$C=$ common $S10\%{-}20\%$ of the planktonic foraminifer assemblage).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $\langle>\!5\%{-}10\%$ of the planktonic foraminifer assemblage).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $.1\%{-5\%}$ of the planktonic foraminifer assemblage).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present $(\!\!\!\!\!-1\%\!\!\!\!)$ of the planktonic foraminifer assemblage).  

Planktonic foraminifer preservation as viewed under the ligh t microscope was recorded as  

$\mathrm{E}=$ excellent, with most specimens having a “glassy” appearance indicating very little recrystallization and very little evidence of overgrowth or dissolution, and little abrasion.   
$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good, some show minor evidence of diagenetic overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion; recrystallization may or may not have occurred.   
${\mathrm{G}}={\mathrm{good}}_{}$ , with some specimens showing signs of significant overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion, and may show some infilling with cement or indurated sediment.   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate, with most specimens showing evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, and abrasion; tests generally infilled with cement or indurated sediment obscuring apertures.   
$\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ , with substantial diagenetic overgrowth, dissolution, and abrasion. Foraminifers can be fragmentary and difficult to identify because of major overgrowth and/or dissolution.  

In addition to this fast visual estimation, samples from selecte d burial depths (generally ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ apart plus a sample from near th e bottom of the hole) at each site were taken using the following protocol for more systematic evaluation of foraminifer preservation, primarily as a guide for future geochemical sampling:  

1. A low-power photomicrograph of the scattered $>\!50\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ residue was taken with the light microscope in reflected light using a Zeiss Discovery V8 microscope and camera to record the visual appearance including discoloration, fragmentation, and test transparency and to provide an indication of the frequency of foraminifers relative to other microfossil groups and grain types.   
2. Selected specimens of planktonic and benthic foraminifers (in this case usually 3 specimens each of Trilobatus trilobus and Planulina wuellerstorfi) were imaged by light microscope and SEM using a Hitachi TM3000 tabletop SEM after coating with conductive gold-palladium. Low-power and high-power images of the wall texture were taken at standard magnifications.   
3. Specimens were removed from the SEM and gently broken on the SEM pedestal using a clean glass slide, rearranged if necessary under a binocular microscope, recoated with gold-palladium, and returned to the SEM. Images of the broken wall cross section and inner surface were taken in standard views and magnification to facilitate the comparison of preservation states between samples and sites.  

All images are available from the LIMS database. Selected images were used to illustrate variations in preservation for each site.  

# Benthic foraminifers  

Benthic foraminifers were examined from all core catcher sample residues (see Planktonic foraminifers) from one hole at eac h site. A full taxonomic list of benthic foraminifer taxa is given in Table T5. The identification of benthic foraminifer taxa was generall y made on the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction, but the $63{-}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction was also examined for distinctive taxa and to help assess preservation. The ratio of planktonic to benthic foraminifers was calculated from the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction by counting at least 100 specimens. Taxonomic assignments mainly follow van Morkhoven et al. (1986), Jones (1994), and Holbourn et al. (2013).

# Shipboard age models  

For each site, tables of biohorizons (calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers) were constructed listing the samples above and below which each biohorizon was identified and the midpoint depth (mbsf) between those samples. Biohorizons were numbered on these tables to correspond with the precoring bioevent master lists presented in Tables T1 and T3. Not every bioevent proved useful during the expedition, and some were located in some sites only. In three instances (the planktonic foraminifer bioevents B Globorotalia truncatulinoides, T Dentoglobigerina altispira, and T Globorotalia margaritae), we found that the precoring age calibrations were not applicable to the study area because of diachrony (either between ocean basins or across latitudes), and an alternative published tropical Indo-Pacific calibration was preferred. To avoid circular reasoning, we did not alter the precoring bioevent lists;  

instead, we indicated the citation for the revised calibration on the biohorizon tables. In several other cases, we found that certain biohorizons plotted consistently off the expected trend throughout the expedition, suggesting that the precoring calibration requires revision. We did not attempt to recalibrate any event during the expedition because we expect more precise formal recalibration will follow during postcruise research based on the full combined stratigraphic information from Expedition 363 sites including, in most cases, cyclostratigraphy. We indicated in the text when such issues arose.  

The identified biohorizons were combined with the available magnetic  reversal  information  (using  reversal  midpoint  mbsf depths) on age-depth plots for each site, with biohorizons numbered consistently throughout the expedition according to the precoring  master  lists.  Levels  of  inferred  hiatuses  and  other disturbances were indicated on these plots. Biohorizons that were found to plot off the general trend were included and discussed in the accompanying text. In most cases, these plots were derived from a specific hole from which most of the biostratigraphic information was gathered; when data from multiple holes were combined, this is clearly indicated on the plots. The accompanying text highlights any major discrepancies or difficulties of interpretation that were encountered in establishing the preliminary shipboard age models.  

Approximate ages for depths at each site can be estimated visually from the trend of the age-depth plots. In most cases, we chose not to indicate a “best fit” or preferred line of correlation because not all biohorizons are equally reliable, and we expect that formal age models will be developed postcruise based on composite depth scales and cyclostratigraphic tuning.  

# Paleomagnetism  

# Software and instrumentation  

Paleomagnetic studies during Expedition 363 comprised routine measurements of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM ) of archive-half sections before and after alternating field (AF) demagnetization. Remanence measurements and AF demagnetizations were made using the section-half superconducting roc k magnetometer (SRM; 2-G Enterprises model 760-R). This instrument is equipped with direct-current superconducting quantu m interference devices (DC-SQUIDs) and has an inline AF demagnetizer capable of reaching peak fields of $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The spatial measurement resolution estimated by the full width at half-height of th e pickup coil response is ${<}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ for all three axes (although the ful l sensitivity range extends over a sample length up to ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{cm}\mathrm{,}$ ), yielding an assumed measured volume of $\sim\!100\ \mathrm{cm^{3}}$ . The noise level o f the SRM is reported as $2\,\times\,10^{-9}\ \mathrm{Am}^{2}$ based on tests during OD P Legs 186 and 200 (Richter et al., 2007). For measurement of a spli t core, the minimum measurable remanent intensities are $\sim\!2\times10^{-5}$ $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m},$ , with previous results suggesting intensities 2–5 times thi s value $({\sim}1\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m})$ are likely to yield accurate results (Richter e t al., 2007). We adopted the standard IODP magnetic coordinate system for archive halves ( $+x=$ vertical upward from the split surfac e of archive halves, $+y=$ left-hand split surface when looking upcore, and $+z=$ downcore) (Figure F11A, F11B). Data were stored usin g the standard IODP file format and automatically uploaded to th e LIMS database using the newly developed Integrated Measuremen t System (IMS) software for the SRM that was first used during IOD P Expedition 362 (McNeill et al., 2017).  

To cross-check the SRM data and to provide rock magnetic information on the carriers of the NRM, we took 1–3 discrete sample s from the working half of each core recovered, typically from Hole  A at each site. In some instances, coring was terminated in Hole A after a single core due to a missed mudline; in these cases, we too k discrete samples from cores from the subsequent hole. Sample s were taken using plastic “Japanese” Natsuhara-Giken samplin g cubes $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample volume) that were pushed into the working hal f of the core by hand with the ${}^{\prime}\mathrm{up}^{\prime\prime}$ arrow on the cube pointing upsection $^{-z}$ axis) in the core (Figure F11A). Selection of representative intervals for discrete sampling was guided by the WRMS L magnetic susceptibility data, generally fine-grained intervals fre e from tephra or other discrete deposits (unless otherwise stated) an d where drilling deformation was minimal or not visible. Discret e samples were measured on the JR-6A spinner magnetometer (sensitivity $=\sim2\times10^{-6}\;\mathrm{A/m})$ under Remasoft 3.0 AGICO software control. To make the NRM data from working-half discrete sample s directly comparable to the SRM data recovered from the archiv e half, we loaded the samples in the JR-6A spinner magnetometer following the cube coordinate system with the $+x$ away from the user, $+y$ upward to the right, and $-z$ upward to the left (Figure F11C). T o correct the cube coordinate system for the JR-6A magnetometer coordinate system, we applied an orientation correction (azimuth $=0^{\circ}$ , $\mathrm{{dip}=90^{\circ},}$ to each specimen in the Remasoft 3.0 AGICO software. Discrete paleomagnetic data were processed in Puffinplot softwar e (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012) to produce demagnetization curves, Zijderveld diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967), and stereoplots and to calculate  maximum  angular  deviation  values  from  the  principa l component analysis of successive demagnetization steps (generall y $15{-}40\;\mathrm{mT}$ ) following Kirschvink (1980). All discrete data were manually uploaded to the LIMS database.

During APC and HLAPC operations, full-length and half-lengt h nonmagnetic core barrels were used; full-length steel barrels wer e required for XCB coring (see Coring and drilling operations). Azimuthal  correction  of  declination  is  crucial  to  help  establis h magnetostratigraphy at low-latitude sites; therefore, the Icefield MI5 or FlexIT core orientation tool was deployed with all APC core s unless otherwise stated in the individual site chapters. These instruments use three orthogonally mounted fluxgate magnetometers t o record orientation of the double lines (working half) scribed on th e core liner with respect to magnetic north. Orientation tools recor d declination, inclination, and temperature to their internal memor y every 6 s. Prior to firing the APC, the core barrel is held stationar y for 5 min so that the best approximation of orientation can be mad e at the moment of APC penetration. Tools were switched every 8–1 2 h, well before the limits of both battery life and memory capacit y were reached. The orientation tools can only be deployed with fulllength APC cores. When sediment was recovered using th e HLAPC, we used, where possible, observations from the final AP C recovered core and observations across multiple holes to manuall y align declination to reflect expected periods of reversed or normal polarity, respectively. When sediment was recovered using the XCB, declination remains uncorrected. To obtain azimuthally correcte d declination (DTrue) for APC cores, we follow the method of Richte r et al. (2007):  

DObserved $=$ the measured declination output from the cryogenic magnetometer;   
${\mathrm{MTF}}=$ the magnetic tool face angle (the angle between magnetic north and the double-line orientation mark on the core liner measured in a clockwise manner when the APC fired); and   
MIGRF $=$ the site specific deviation of magnetic north from true north.  

At Site U1481 during IODP Expedition 362, a rotational erro r was reported in the corrected declination using both the Icefiel d MI-5 and the FlexIT core orientation tools that yielded reverse d directions (i.e., $180^{\circ}$ instead of $0^{\circ}$ ) during a period of normal polarit y (McNeill et al., 2017). Investigation and onboard testing reveale d that this error was not observed during shipboard laboratory testin g but only when mounted inside pressure casing on the sinker bars i n the BHA of the drill string. It was concluded during Expedition 36 2 that this simply amounted to incorrect alignment of the Icefield MI5 tool relative to the working-half reference and that a constant correction of $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ could be used during sample processing (McNeil l et al., 2017). During the port call prior to the beginning of Expedition 363, the Icefield MI-5 and FlexIT core orientation tools wer e both tested by the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator–Texa s A&M University technical staff. This test consisted of orienting th e tools with a compass to magnetic north followed by four $90^{\circ}$ clockwise rotations so that the magnetic tool face was pointing in th e north, east, south, west, and finally north directions, respectively. The resulting data (Figure F12) showed that the MTF of the Icefiel d MI-5 and FlexIT core orientation tools faithfully recorded the orientations the tools experienced during the test. The Icefield MI- 5 core orientation tool was also tested inside its pressure casing; thes e tests yielded the same results (Figure F12).  

Orientation during Expedition 363 drilling operations at Site s U1482–U1487 revealed that the issues that affected DTrue durin g Expedition 362 continued to affect orientation during Expeditio n 363, with declination generally clustering around $180^{\circ}$ $(0^{\circ})$ for periods of normal (reversed) polarity. An exception to this was in Hol e U1483C when this issue apparently self-corrected, with declinatio n clustered around $0^{\circ}$ $(180^{\circ})$ for normal (reversed) polarity intervals. Conversations with the operations superintendent revealed nothin g peculiar or different about coring operations in Hole U1483C compared to any other holes drilled during the expedition, and the specific tool used (Icefield tool $\#2007$ ) had previously exhibited th e $180^{\circ}$ offset during orientation of Hole U1482B. No obvious cause fo r the error or apparent self-correction could be determined, and th e cause of this offset remains unclear.  

Although absolute values of declination appear correct for Hol e U1483C, an additional declination error developed during azimuthal correction of Cores 363-U1483C-1H and 18H whereb y DTrue values of several cores were ${\sim}45^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ}$ shallower than expected. This issue appeared again during operations in Hol e U1485A, although this time it was accompanied by the persisten t $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ baseline offset. We concluded that this was likely a tool-specific issue (related to Icefield tool $\#2007$ ), and after operations a t Site U1485 we requested that Icefield tool $\#2007$ not be used durin g the remainder of Expedition 363. For Sites U1486–U1490, we exclusively used Icefield tools $\#2052$ and $\#2043$ . During azimuthal correction for Sites U1488–U1490, we again developed issues wit h declination shallowing superimposed on the $180^{\circ}$ baseline offset a s periods of normal polarity clustered between $90^{\circ}{-}180^{\circ}$ and reverse d  

Figure F12. Orientation data from the FlexIT and Icefield MI-5 core orientation tools and the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool within its pressure casing during Expedition 363 port call testing. In each test, the MTF wa s orientated to magnetic north using a handheld compass and then rotate d $90^{\circ}$ clockwise through the east, south, west, and finally north directions. Fo r the Icefield MI-5 pressure casing test, the tool was inverted while still facin g north after the four rotations. In each case, the tool recorded the expecte d declination direction within $15^{\circ}$ , which can be accounted for by operato r error and tool sensitivity.

polarity between $270^{\circ}{-}360^{\circ}$ . These offsets generally remained consistent during tool deployment, thus enabling interpretation of polarity; however, in an isolated incident we had to assume a $90^{\circ}$ MT F error to reconcile the declination data of Core 363-U1488B-6H wit h that measured in cores from Holes U1488A and U1488C over th e same interval. Although these absolute offsets varied from site t o site and often from hole to hole, relative shifts of $180^{\circ}$ relating t o changes in polarity were still observed and could be used for determination of magnetostratigraphy. Because of the varied, and ofte n hole-specific, nature of these offsets, we do not apply the $180^{\circ}$ correction detailed in McNeill et al. (2017) and leave the DTrue value s as calculated following Richter et al. (2007).  

# Measurements and data acquisition program  

At the beginning of every new hole and/or when deemed necessary we physically cleaned the sample boat with isopropyl alcohol and the tray runners with antistatic solution. The sample tray wa s then AF demagnetized using a peak field of $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ followed by a remanence measurement to maintain accurate tray correction value s that were applied to each measured section. The NRM of archiv e halves of all APC and HLAPC core sections was measured unles s precluded or made unreliable by coring-related disturbance. Cor e catchers were not routinely measured. Measurements were made a t intervals of $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ with leader and trailer lengths of $15\;\mathrm{cm}$ . Using  a track speed setting of $10\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s}$ , one measurement per interval, and  a delay between measurements of $25\,\mathrm{ms}$ , one three-axis AF demagnetization and subsequent section measurement at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ interval s took ${\sim}4.5$ min. Measurements without AF demagnetization took ${\sim}3$ min.

The magnetic susceptibility of whole-round core sections wa s measured on two separate core logging systems (Table T6). Wholeround core sections were measured on the STMSL at $5\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ interval s to rapidly acquire magnetic susceptibility data for stratigraphic correlation (see Stratigraphic correlation and Physical properties). After whole-round core sections equilibrated to room temperature, measurements were made at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals on the WRMSL (se e Physical properties). Additionally, point-source magnetic susceptibility measurements were made on the archive halves of split-cor e sections using the SHMSL at the same $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ spacing (see Core description and Physical properties).  

Discrete samples were first measured for NRM on the JR-6 A spinner magnetometer before being subjected to manual three-axi s AF demagnetization using the DTech AF demagnetizer (model D2000) in incrementally increasing peak AF fields of 5, 10, 15, 20, (25), 30, 40, (60), and (80) mT. NRM was remeasured following eac h AF demagnetization step; demagnetization steps in parenthese s were often dropped after Site U1482 to speed up measurement. I n addition to NRM measurements, we measured bulk magnetic susceptibility on the Kappabridge (KLY 4), acquired an anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) by demagnetizing the sample in  a peak AF of $100\,\mathrm{mT}$ in the presence of a $0.05\,\mathrm{mT}$ DC bias field on th e DTech AF demagnetizer, and acquired an isothermal remanen t magnetization (IRM) in a DC field of $300~\mathrm{mT}$ and a saturation IR M (SIRM) in a DC field of $1000~\mathrm{{mT}}$ using the IM-10 impulse magnetizer. All remanence measurements were made on the JR-6A spinner magnetometer. Sample masses were recorded to facilitate massnormalized estimations of magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ , ARM, an d IRM. ARM was corrected for the strength of the DC field to calculate susceptibility of ARM $({\tt X A R M})$ , and (inter)parametric ratio s (e.g., $\mathrm{IRM}_{300\mathrm{mT}}/\mathrm{IRM}_{1000\mathrm{mT}},$ , $\chi\mathrm{ARM/SIRM)}$ were generated to provid e estimates of magnetic grain size and magnetic mineralogy.  

To characterize both the NRM behavior and the pervasivenes s of the drill string overprint, we developed a four- to five-step demagnetization and measurement protocol for the first few SRMmeasured sections from the first core recovered from Hole A a t each site. This protocol involved measurement of the NRM befor e and after AF demagnetization in fields of 5, 10, 15, and sometime s $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ . We used these data in conjunction with the discrete sampl e data from Hole A that were demagnetized in peak AFs up to 40–8 0 mT to decide on the lowest peak field required to remove the dril l string overprint. Low peak AF demagnetizations of $10{-}15~\mathrm{mT}$ use d during Expedition 363 ensured that archive halves remain useful fo r shore-based higher resolution U-channel or cube studies of NRM.  

Subsequent cores from the same site were only demagnetized usin g this single AF step following NRM measurement to maintain cor e flow through the laboratory. In summary, the measurement interval, number of demagnetization steps, and peak field used reflecte d the quality and demagnetization characteristics of the recovere d sediments, the severity of the drill string magnetic overprint, th e desire to keep peak AFs low, and the need to maintain efficient cor e flow through the laboratories.  

# Data presentation and magnetostratigraphy  

Data presented for each hole includes the NRM intensity befor e and after peak AF demagnetization, inclination and declination (azimuthally corrected if available) after peak AF demagnetization, an d WRMSL magnetic susceptibility. We also show rock magneti c properties based on analysis of discrete samples (inclination an d declination of the same SRM peak AF field, and maximum angula r deviation values calculated from principal component analyses ove r several AF demagnetization steps) and interstitial water geochemistry and methane concentration if diagenesis was regarded as an important influence on the magnetic assemblage within the sediment. Although the leader and trailer data were saved within the data files, we trim these intervals and the first and last $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ from the SR M data set in the presented figures because they are affected by volumetric differences associated with the response function of th e SRM pickup coils. Disturbed intervals caused by coring or sedimentological variations (e.g., fall-in, suck-in, and/or unconsolidated material) or core sections that experienced strong flux jumps i n intensity on the DC-SQUID were also manually removed befor e presentation. We use the uncompressed core depth below seafloo r (CSF-A) depth scale (denoted as mbsf throughout the volume) t o show data from each hole. Where shipboard AF demagnetization o f core sections and discrete cubes appears to have removed the drill string overprint and isolated the characteristic remanent magnetization, we made an initial designation of magnetic polarity zones. The ATNTS2012 timescale (Hilgen et al., 2012) within the GTS201 2 (Gradstein et al., 2012) was used as a reference for the ages of correlative Cenozoic polarity chrons (Table T7). We used the namin g convention following that of correlative anomaly numbers preface d by the letter C (Tauxe et al., 1984). Normal polarity subchrons ar e referred to by adding suffixes (n1, n2, etc.) that increase with age. For the younger part of the timescale (Pliocene–Pleistocene), we us e the traditional names to refer to the various chrons and subchron s (e.g., Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, etc.; Laj and Channell, 2007). Normal polarity zones are denoted using black bars and reverse polarity zones with white bars in the classic “barcode diagram” presented in the figures. We determined the depth of a magneti c reversal to be the arithmetic midpoint between the last point of stable polarity and the first point of newly stable polarity. Because thi s can be a relatively subjective designation, we provide these depth s alongside the midpoint in table form when we determine a reversa l boundary.

# Physical properties  

High-resolution physical property measurements were mad e during Expedition 363 to provide information on the bulk physica l character and acoustic and elastic parameters of recovered sediment. Such data enhance our understanding of the physicochemica l context and history for oceanic deposits, augment lithologic characterization, and facilitate the correlation of downhole logging dat a with discrete core measurements and core descriptions. In contras t to isotopic ratios and grain size distributions, physical property dat a can be measured quickly and as such serve as important first-orde r proxies for determining changes in environmental conditions, geological processes, and/or depositional environments. Shipboar d physical property data play a key role in the following tasks:  

• Completion of hole-to-hole correlation for construction of composite stratigraphic sections;   
• Detection of discontinuities and inhomogeneities, either caused naturally or by the drilling process;   
• Identification of differences in the composition and texture of sediments;   
• Creation of time-series analysis for detection of orbital cycles and tuning to reference sections for stratigraphic purposes;   
• Calculation of sedimentation rates;   
• Completion of core-log-seismic integration; and   
• Identification of major seismic reflectors and construction of synthetic seismic profiles.  

A variety of techniques were used on whole-round sections , split-core sections, and discrete samples to characterize the physical properties of Expedition 363 cores. Before splitting, core section s were analyzed using three whole-round core logging systems: (1 ) the STMSL, (2) the WRMSL, and (3) the NGRL. In most instances, the STMSL was typically run for all holes requiring real-time stratigraphic  correlation  immediately  after  the  core  sections  wer e brought on board. STMSL measurements were generally not collected for the first deep hole at each site (typically Hole A) becaus e higher resolution WRMSL data were available for the first hole b y the time stratigraphic correlation to subsequent holes was required. All holes were run on the WRMSL after equilibration for ${\sim}4{-}5\,\mathrm{h}$ t o ambient laboratory temperature $(20^{\circ}{-}21^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Following WRMS L scanning, whole-round sections were logged on the NGRL, whic h generates spectral gamma ray data. However, because NGR is no t affected by temperature change, beginning with Site U1484, core s were measured on the NGRL immediately after being brought onboard to maximize the amount of time available for these measurements (see Natural gamma radiation for more details). Thermal conductivity was measured on one whole-round section per cor e (typically the third section) for soft-sediment cores and on a spli t core section once the sediment became too indurated. After wholeround measurements were completed, core sections were split longitudinally, with one half designated as the archive half and th e other as the working half for sampling and destructive analyses. Four in situ downhole temperature measurements were made wit h the APCT-3, typically in Hole A at each site. These temperatur e measurements can be combined with the thermal conductivit y measurements to calculate heat flow.  

Discrete $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity was measured on the working halves, typically at a frequency of once per section. $P$ -wave velocity measurements employed transducers oriented in the $x\cdot$ -, $y_{-}$ , and $z$ -axi s directions on the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG). $P_{-}$ - wave $y.$ -axis velocity measurements were discontinued after the firs t site due to time constraints. Archive halves were measured with th e SHMSL for color reflectance with an Ocean Optics sensor and magnetic susceptibility using a discrete point-source Bartington probe. Discrete samples were also typically collected from every other section of the working halves $\left.\sim\!3\right.$ per core), primarily from Hole A, t o measure wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density using MAD procedures. Subsequent holes wer e only sampled for MAD measurements if Hole A was cored to a shallower depth, there were extensive gaps in the Hole A sample series, unusual sediments were recovered in later holes with no equivalen t in Hole A, or an interval in Hole A required validation.  

An overview of the sampling strategy of physical property measurements is given in Table T6. A full discussion of all methodologies and calculations used in the Physical Properties laborator y aboard the JOIDES Resolution is available in Blum (1997).  

# Whole-round logger measurements (STMSL, WRMSL, and NGRL)  

During Expedition 363, whole-round core logging operation s recorded high-resolution GRA bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity (WRMSL; Figure F13), and NGR (NGRL; Figur e F14) data. The STMSL rapidly recorded medium-resolution GR A density and magnetic susceptibility data sets; this rapid data acquisition allowed for near-real-time stratigraphic correlation to previously drilled holes to inform drilling decisions that would ensur e that core gaps were at different stratigraphic depths among holes. The STMSL measurements were typically taken at $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolutio n in all holes requiring stratigraphic correlation (typically Hole B onward at a given site). Scanning time averaged 3 s per measuremen t point with a single measurement for both GRA and magnetic susceptibility, resulting in a scanning time of $4{-}5\ \mathrm{min}$ per $1.5\textrm{m}$ section.  

The WRMSL employs, in order, a GRA bulk densitometer,  a magnetic susceptibility loop sensor, and a compressional $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity logger. Cores recovered with the XCB coring system ar e slightly smaller in diameter than those cored with the APC system. As a result, sections cored with the XCB system typically have gap s between the liner and the core; therefore, $P.$ -wave velocity was no t measured with the WRMSL on those cores. In addition, when AP C core sections contained abundant cracks or gas in sediment that resulted in unreliable values, the $P$ -wave logger was also switched off . A $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ measurement resolution was chosen for the WRMSL t o avoid encumbering downstream core processing and sample collection and to ensure consistency with other high-resolution loggin g techniques (e.g., NGRL, color reflectance, line-scan images, an d NRM). Scanning time averaged ${\sim}8$ s per measurement point, including three repeat magnetic susceptibility measurements to enhance data quality, resulting in a scanning time of ${\sim}7\,\mathrm{min}$ per $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$

section. The quality of the STMSL and WRMSL data is highly dependent on the structural integrity of the sediment (cracks, voids, biscuiting, etc.) and whether any gaps between the sediment an d the core liner are present. The structural integrity and incomplet e filling of liners were recorded where necessary.  

At Sites U1488 and U1490, $P$ -wave velocity proved to be th e most useful correlation tool over parts of the records. Because th e STMSL did not include a $P$ -wave logger (PWL), we switched th e function of the STMSL and WRMSL while coring Holes U1488 C and U1490B. The core sections were immediately run on th e WRMSL at $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ spacing to rapidly collect GRA bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P$ -wave velocity data. After equilibration, the cores were then run at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ spacing on the STMSL to collec t higher resolution GRA bulk density and magnetic susceptibilit y data. Core sections were then run on the WRMSL PWL at $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ a s time allowed. The GRA bulk densitometer and magnetic susceptibility loop incorporated in the STMSL and WRMSL are effectivel y identical.  

For the NGRL, each section was initially scanned for $5~\mathrm{min}$ a t two positions, resulting in $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution data at a scanning tim e of ${\sim}11$ min per $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ section. This strategy was adapted throughou t the expedition to avoid encumbering the core flow (see Natura l gamma radiation for further details).  

# GRA bulk density  

Bulk density is a reflection of water-saturated porosity, grai n density (dominant mineralogy), grain packing, and coring disturbance. GRA density is an estimate of bulk density based on the attenuation of a gamma ray beam. To measure bulk density, the GR A densitometer uses a $10~\mathrm{mCi}$ $^{137}\!C s$ capsule as a gamma ray sourc e (principal energy peak at $0.662\,\mathrm{MeV})$ at a radiation level of $370\,\mathrm{Mbq}$ within a lead shield with a $5\,\mathrm{mm}$ collimator; the radiation is directe d through the whole-round core and has a spatial resolution of $<\!1\;\mathrm{cm}$ . The gamma ray detector on the opposite side of the core from th e source includes a scintillator and an integral photomultiplier tube t o record the gamma radiation that passes through the core. The narrow collimated peak is attenuated as it passes through the center o f the core. Incident photons are scattered by the electrons of the sediment through Compton scattering, in which gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation; the degree of scattering i s related to the material bulk density. Therefore, for a known sampl e diameter $(d)$ , the density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of th e attenuated gamma rays $\left(I_{0}\right)$ and can be expressed as  

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I/I_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

where $I$ is the measured intensity of the gamma rays passin g through the sample and $\upmu$ is the Compton attenuation coefficien t (Evans, 1965; Harms and Choquette, 1965). Because the attenuatio n coefficient for aluminum is similar to that of most common minerals, bulk density is obtained through direct calibration of th e densitometer using aluminum rods of different diameters mounte d in a core liner filled with distilled water.  

In general, STMSL and WRMSL GRA bulk density measurements are most accurate when taken on a completely filled cor e liner with minimal drilling disturbance; otherwise, measurement s tend to underestimate true values. By default, the instrument reports measurements using the internal diameter of the core line r $,66~\mathrm{mm})$ ) as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for most sediment cores obtained by the APC system; however, for sediment cored by the XCB system, core diameter is usually ${\sim}58$ mm or less. Following Jarrard and Kerneklian (2007), past IODP expeditions (e.g., Expedition 355) corrected the density measurements of XCB cores by multiplying the density values by $66/58\,=$ 1.138 to account for this bias. We initially applied this correction t o data obtained by XCB coring (notably Site U1482); however, th e corrected GRA data from XCB cores showed a large offset wit h MAD bulk density data. Because MAD bulk density is a more accurate measure of true bulk density, we chose not to apply the XC B correction to GRA data (see Physical properties in the Site U148 2 chapter [Rosenthal et al., 2018] for further details). Irregularly fille d core liners also influence GRA measurements and should be considered when interpreting the data.  

The gamma ray detector is calibrated with sealed calibratio n cores (one standard core liner filled with distilled water and aluminum cylinders of various diameters). To establish the calibratio n curves, gamma ray counts were taken through each aluminum cylinder for $60~{\mathsf{s}}.$ . Each aluminum cylinder has a density of $2.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and $^d$ is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The relationship between $l$ and $\upmu d$ is  

$$
\ln(I)=A(\upmu d)2+B(\upmu d)+C,
$$  

where $A,B$ , and $C$ are coefficients determined from the calibration. Recalibration was performed as needed when the deionized wate r QA/QC standard deviated significantly (e.g., more than a few percent) from $1\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility (loop)  

Magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measurement o f the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic field:  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field of strength $H.$ It provides information on the magnetic composition of the sediment that commonly can be related to mineralogical composition (e.g., terrigenous versus biogenic materials) an d diagenetic overprinting. Magnetite and a few other iron oxides wit h ferromagnetic characteristics have a specific magnetic susceptibilit y several orders of magnitude higher than clay, which has paramagnetic properties. Carbonate layers, opal, water, and plastic (cor e liner) have small negative values of magnetic susceptibility. Calcareous and biogenic deposits with very small amounts of clay and ironbearing mineral debris thus have values approaching the detectio n limit of magnetic susceptibility meters.  

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were made with the Bartington Instruments MS2C loop sensor. The WRMSL operates a t $565\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a $90\;\mathrm{mm}$ loop with a correction value of 1 (e.g., no correction). The STMSL operates at $452\;\mathrm{Hz}$ in a $90~\mathrm{mm}$ loop with a correction value of 1.174. The loop sensors have a spatial measuremen t resolution estimated by the full width at half maximum height of th e response function of $4.0{-}4.5~\mathrm{cm}$ and are accurate to within $5\%$ a s indicated in Bartington specifications (Blum, 1997). The loop i s zeroed in air before each measurement run in order to avoid influence from the logger. The output of the magnetic susceptibility sensors  can  be  set  to  centimeter-gram-second  (cgs)  units  o r dimensionless SI units. SI units $\left(\times10^{-5}\right)$ are used as the IODP standard and are reported as such in the database.  

# Compressional P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity varies with the material’s lithology, porosity, an d bulk density, as well as state of stress, temperature, and fabric or degree of fracturing. In sediment and rock, velocity is controlled b y the degree of consolidation, lithification, and fracturing, along wit h the occurrence and abundance of free gas and gas hydrate. Togethe r with bulk density, velocity data are used to calculate acoustic impedance and reflection coefficients to construct synthetic seismi c profiles and to estimate the depth of specific seismic horizons. $P_{-}$ - wave velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is defined by the time required for a compressional wave to travel a specific distance:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is th e traveltime through the core.  

The $P$ -wave velocity sensor measures the ultrasonic $P$ -wave velocity of the whole-round sample residing in the core liner. The $P$ - wave logger transmits a $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ $P$ -wave pulse across the core section at a specified repetition rate. Waves are transmitted to the cor e by plastic transducer contacts connected to linear actuators. Pressure was applied to the actuators to ensure coupling between th e transducers and the core liner. Traveltime is determined by signa l processing software that automatically detects the first arrival of th e $P_{\|}$ -wave signal to a precision of $50~\mathrm{ns}$ . The wave travels horizontall y across the whole core and core liner. Ultrasonic $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity i s calculated after correcting for system propagation delay, liner thickness, and liner material velocity. The total observed traveltime $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is composed of  

$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry,   
$t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure,   
$t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner, and   
$t_{\mathrm{core}}=$ traveltime through the sediment.  

The system is calibrated using a core liner filled with distille d water, which provides control for $t_{\mathrm{delay}},t_{\mathrm{pulse}},$ and $t_{\mathrm{liner}}$ . From these calibrations, $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ can be calculated for the whole-round specimens i n core liners as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{cl}}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{\mathrm{o}}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{cl}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner, $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness, and $t_{0}=$ measured total traveltime.  

The above equation assumes that the core completely fills th e core liner. The WRMSL $P$ -wave logger was turned off for XC B cores, which typically do not fill the core liner and therefore do no t give accurate measurements using the WRMSL $P$ -wave system.  

# Natural gamma radiation  

The NGRL was designed and built at the Texas A&M Universit y IODP facility and measures gamma radiation emitted from wholeround core sections (Vasiliev et al., 2011) (Figure F14). Gamma radiation detected by the logger arises primarily from the decay o f mineral-hosted 238-uranium $^{(238\mathrm{{U})}}$ , 232-thorium $(^{232}\mathrm{{Th})}$ , and 40- potassium $(^{40}\mathrm{K})$ isotopes. When $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotope s decay, they and their daughter isotopes emit gamma radiation a t specific energy levels unique to each isotope. NGR spectroscop y measures a wide energy spectrum that can be used to estimate th e abundance of each isotope based on the strength of the signal a t characteristic energies (Blum, 1997). Spectral data were collecte d but were not processed on board and can be used for postcruis e processing for U, Th, and K abundance (e.g., De Vleeschouwer et al., 2017). In general, high counts identify fine-grained deposits containing K-rich clay minerals and their absorbed U and Th atoms. NGR data reveal stratigraphic details that aid in core-to-core correlations.  

The main NGR detector unit consists of 8 sodium iodide (NaI ) scintillator detectors surrounding the lower half of the section,  7 shielding plastic scintillator detectors, 22 photomultipliers, and passive lead shielding (Figure F15). The NaI detectors are covered by a t least $8~\mathrm{{cm}}$ of lead shielding. In addition, lead separators ( $\cdot^{7}\,\mathrm{cm}$ o f low-background lead) are positioned between the NaI detectors. Half of the lead shielding closest to the NaI detectors is composed o f low-background lead, whereas the outer half is composed of common (virgin) lead. In addition to this passive lead shielding, th e overlying plastic scintillators detect incoming high-energy gamm a and muon cosmic radiation and remove this signal from the total counted by the NaI detectors.  

A measurement run consisted of one or two sample positions 1 0 cm apart, for a total of 8 measurements per $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ section per position. The quality of the energy spectrum measured in a core depends on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample but als o on the counting time, with higher times yielding better spectra. Further information may be found in Vasiliev et al. (2011) and Dunle a et al. (2013). Counting times for all holes were $5~\mathrm{min}$ per position, resulting in measurement times of ${\sim}11$ min per section/77 min pe r core for two positions to yield statistically significant energy spectra. However, because this was a high-recovery expedition, thes e scanning times significantly encumbered core flow. This delay wa s accommodated at Sites U1482 and U1483 due to the long transi t following completion of operations at these sites. We adopted a different NGRL strategy for the second half of the expedition whe n there was minimal transit time between sites. First, at the start o f coring at a new site, cores were run prior to equilibration to laboratory temperature, as temperature does not affect NGR. Care wa s taken to ensure that no water leaked from the sections while in th e NGRL. Hole A was measured at two positions for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ at each position ( $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution data), but subsequent holes were measure d at a single position (position 2) for $5~\mathrm{min}$ $20~\mathrm{cm}$ resolution data). Cores measured at a single position could be scanned in ${\sim}45\ \mathrm{min}$ per core, which significantly improved core flow. If time allowe d (e.g., coring in deeper water) or if subsequent holes were core d deeper than Hole A, subsequent holes or portions of subsequen t holes were measured at two positions for $5~\mathrm{min}$ each, primarily t o aid stratigraphic correlation. We opted not to reduce the count tim e at both positions even though we found that reducing the coun t time would not affect the quality of the data for correlation purposes, but the strength of the U peak was significantly reduced relative to a longer count time. Measuring at a single position wa s therefore preferred, as it ensured the quality of the spectra obtaine d at each position, although the $20\ \mathrm{cm}$ resolution NGR data wer e more difficult to use for stratigraphic correlation purposes.

# Thermal conductivity  

Thermal conductivity is an intrinsic material property for whic h the values depend on the chemical composition, porosity, density, structure, and fabric of the material. Thermal conductivity profile s are used along with in situ temperature measurements to determin e heat flow, which is an indicator of age of ocean crust and fluid circulation processes.  

After NGR measurements were completed, thermal conductivity was measured with the TK04 (Teka Berlin) system using the needle-probe method in full-space configuration for whole-roun d sediment cores (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959). The needle prob e contains a heater wire and calibrated thermistor. The probe was inserted into a $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ hole drilled through the liner along the splittin g line of the core section. To avoid interference from airflow in th e laboratory, a foam rubber insulating jacket was placed over the cor e section during measurement of thermal conductivity. We als o placed the core section inside a large plastic box outfitted with foa m to further reduce thermal disturbances. A heating power of 0.5 to  2 $\mathrm{W/m}$ was typically used. The solution to the heat conduction equation with a line source of heat was then fit to the temperature measurements to obtain the thermal conductivity. Because the probe i s much more conductive than sediment, the probe is assumed to be  a perfect conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of th e superconductive probe has a linear relationship with the natura l logarithm of the time after the initiation of the heat:  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

# where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\left(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (s), and $C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three  measuring  cycles/replicates  were  automatically  performed at each probe location (usually ${\sim}75~\mathrm{cm}$ offset from the to p of the section) to calculate average thermal conductivity in the cor e material. The instrument routinely performed a self-test, which included a drift measurement, at the beginning of each measuremen t cycle. Once the probe temperature stabilized, the heater circuit wa s closed and the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Therma l conductivity was calculated from the rate of temperature rise whil e the heater current was flowing. Temperatures measured during th e first 150 s of the heating cycle were fitted to an approximate solution of a constantly heated line source (for details, see Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Thermal conductivity measurements were routinely taken in the first hole at each site and in one section per cor e (typically Section 3), with measurements taking ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{min}$ . Once th e sediment became too hard to penetrate with the needle probe, a different method for measuring thermal conductivity using a puc k probe was applied. First, a piece of sediment (ideally $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ i n length) was removed from a split-core section. The flat surface of  a puck probe was placed on the surface of the sediment piece and secured with a rubber band. The sediment and puck were then place d in a water bath containing seawater, and thermal conductivity measurements were taken using TK04 with power supplied by interruptible power supply battery. Thermal conductivity was regularl y measured using the puck probe in XCB cores, particularly becaus e the sediment eventually becomes too indurated to insert the needl e probe successfully. Even in less indurated sediment, needle-prob e thermal conductivity measurements on XCB cores typically yiel d spurious results because frequent cracks in the cores induce d during XCB coring lead to inadequate coupling between the needl e probe and the sediment and additional fluid convection through th e sediment.  

# Section Half Measurement Gantry  

$P$ -wave velocity measurements on split-core sections wer e initially performed once or twice per section in Hole A and a s needed on subsequent holes, using the SHMG (Figure F16). Generally, the measurements were taken at ${\sim}100~\mathrm{cm}$ in the section; however, if necessary, measurements were taken at varying sectio n intervals to accommodate lithological variations and core quality. Discrete $z_{\cdot},y_{\cdot},$ , and $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis $P$ -wave measurements were ideally take n at the same section interval by first using the $z$ -axis bayonet, the n the $y$ -axis bayonet, and finally the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis caliper contact prob e transducers on the SHMG. Where the sediment surface was too disturbed by the $z\cdot$ - and $y$ -axis measurements, the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis measuremen t

We observed good reproducibility betwee n $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ -axis measurements by the SHMG and $P$ -wave velocity measurements using the WRMSL in Hole U1482A and stopped measurin g SHMG $y.$ -axis $P$ -wave velocity at all other sites during Expeditio n 363. The system uses Panametrics-NDT Microscan delay line transducers, which transmit at $0.5~\mathrm{MHz}$ . The signal received was recorded, and the peak ( $P_{\|}$ -wave arrival) was chosen with autopickin g software, which was adjusted manually to the first positive peak. The peak was always manually chosen to ensure a consistent firs t arrival time was selected. The distance between transducers wa s measured with a built-in linear voltage displacement transforme r (LDVT).  

Calibration was performed with a series of acrylic cylinders o f differing thicknesses and a known $P$ -wave velocity of $2750\pm20\,\mathrm{m/s}$ . The determined system time delay from calibration was subtracte d from the picked arrival time to give a traveltime of the $P$ -wav e through the sample. The thickness of the sample (calculated b y LDVT in meters) was divided by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P$ -wave velocity in meters per second.  

# Moisture and density  

Discrete samples were collected from the working halves afte r measurement on the SHMG to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, salt content, and porosity. In soft sediment, $\mathrm{{\sim}10\ c m^{3}}$ samples were collected with a $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter plasti c syringe that fits into a $12\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ glass vial so that the vial will be completely filled with sediment. To accommodate the large volume o f cored sediment and subsequent carbonate analysis, three MA D samples were taken and measured per core (usually at ${\sim}100~\mathrm{cm}$ i n Sections 1, 3, and 5). Additional MAD samples were taken wher e lithologies of interest were present.  

Samples were placed in prelabeled and preweighed $16~\mathrm{~mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment mass measurement. The volumes of the numbered Wheaton vials were calculated befor e the expedition by multiplying each vial’s weight by the average density of the vial glass. After wet sediment analysis, the samples wer e dried in a convective oven at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and allowe d to cool in a desiccator for at least $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ before taking the dry volum e measurements. The weights of wet and dry sample masses were determined to a precision of $0.005\mathrm{~g~}$ using two Mettler Toledo electronic balances, with one balance acting as a reference. A standar d weight of value similar to that of the sample was placed on the reference balance to increase accuracy. A computer averaging syste m was used to compensate for the ship’s motion. The default setting o f the balances is 300 measurements, taking ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{min}$ .  

Dry sample volume was determined using a hexapycnomete r system of a six-celled, custom-configured Micromeritics AccuPy c 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer (Figure F17). The precision of each cell is $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. Volume measurement was preceded by three purges of the sample chamber wit h helium warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run fo r each sample. A reference volume (calibration spheres) was sequentially placed in one of the six chambers to check for instrument drif t and systematic error.  

The procedures for the determination of these physical properties comply with the American Society for Testing and Material s (ASTM) designation (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). Th e fundamental relationships and assumptions for the calculations o f all physical property parameters are discussed by Blum (1997) an d summarized below.

# Mass and volume calculation  

Wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $\mathbf{\Gamma}(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)$ wer e measured in the laboratory. The ratio of mass (rm) is a computational constant of 0.965 (i.e., $0.965\mathrm{~g~}$ of freshwater per $1{\mathrm{~g~}}$ of seawater). Salt precipitated in sediment pores during the dryin g process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of th e evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $(M_{\mathrm{salt}})$ in the sample are given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}\;\mathrm{and}}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[s/(1-{\mathsf{s}})],}\end{array}
$$  

where s is the assumed saltwater salinity $(0.035\%)$ corresponding t o a pore water density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}}\right)$ of $1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $(\boldsymbol\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ o f $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of por e water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of sal t $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\left(V_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are, respectively,  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},\ }\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\rho_{\mathrm{pw}},\ }\\ {M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},\ }\\ {M_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),\ }\\ {V_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{solit}}/\rho_{\mathrm{solit}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

# Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as th e ratio of mass of interstitial water to wet sediment (total) mass:  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grai n density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio (VR) are calculated as  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{\Gamma}_{\mathrm{pwt}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Gamma}_{\mathrm{pdry}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Gamma}_{\mathrm{\Gamma}}}\\ &{\mathsf{\Gamma}_{\mathrm{{solid}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{VR}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.

MAD properties reported and plotted in the Physical propertie s sections of all site chapters were calculated with the MADMax shipboard program, set with the “method $C^{\dprime}$ calculation process (Blum, 1997).  

# Section-half logger measurements  

# Section Half Image Logger  

The surfaces of the archive halves of split cores were digitall y imaged using a 3CCD (charge-coupled device) line-scan camer a (JAI model CV107CL) with a macro lens (AF micro Nikkor $60\,\mathrm{mm}$ , 1:2.8). The camera is mounted on the Section Half Image Logge r (SHIL; Figure F18) and moves along the core section by a motorize d gantry. Prior to imaging, the core face was prepared by scrapin g across, rather than along, the core section using a stainless steel o r glass scraper. Scraping parallel to bedding with a freshly cleane d tool prevented cross-stratigraphic contamination. After splitting, the archive halves were imaged as soon as possible to capture th e core surface prior to drying and/or oxidation (see Core description). Images were scanned at an interval of 10 lines/mm, with camera height adjusted such that pixels are square. Light for imagin g was provided by three pairs of advanced illumination high-curren t focused LED line lights with fully adjustable angles to the lens axis. Compression of line-scanned images on VCDs or summary figure s may result in visual artifacts, primarily lamination that is not present in the actual sections. Along with the images, the variations i n the red, green, and blue (RGB) color channels were also recorded b y the SHIL and used as a primary tool for stratigraphic correlation.  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger  

# Spectrophotometry  

After imaging, spectrophotometry was measured on the archiv e halves with the SHMSL (Figure F19). Spurious measurements ma y occur from small cracks, drilling disturbance, plastic section dividers, or where the sensors did not make adequate contact with th e core surface, which results in leakage of ambient room light into th e spectrophotometer readings. The reflectance of visible light wa s measured using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotomete r mounted on the automated SHMSL. A halogen light source, covering a wavelength range through the visible spectrum and slightl y into the infrared domain, was used. Freshly split cores were covere d with clear plastic wrap and placed on the SHMSL. Measurement s were taken at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ spacing to provide a high-resolution stratigraphic record of color variation for visible wavelengths. Each measurement was recorded in $2\,\mathrm{nm}$ wide spectral bands from 380 to 90 0 nm. The approximate $_{3\textup{s}}$ data acquisition offset was applied for th e entire scan of the archive section half. The data are reported usin g the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color system, in which $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ is redness (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative) of the sediment. The color reflectanc e spectrophotometer calibrates on two spectra, pure white (refer

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

Point magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartingto n MS2 meter and an MS2K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diamete r round sensor with a field of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and an operatio n frequency of $930\,\mathrm{Hz}$ . The instrument averages three measurement s from the sensor for each offset, leading to an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . Th e horizontal spatial resolution of the point magnetic susceptibility instrument is ${\sim}3.8\;\mathrm{mm},$ , higher than that of the whole-round magneti c susceptibility loop. As with whole-round measurements, the poin t magnetic susceptibility sensor output is given in dimensionless S I units $\left(\times10^{-5}\right)$ . The probe is zeroed in air before each measuremen t run in order to avoid influence from the metal track. The poin t magnetic susceptibility meter was calibrated by the manufacture r before installation on the ship and is quality checked every ${\sim}6\;\mathrm{h},$ a t the same time as color reflectance sensor calibration.  

# In situ temperature measurements  

During Expedition 363, in situ temperature measurements wer e made with the APCT-3, typically in Hole A at each site, when th e APC was deployed. If Hole A was a short hole (because of a misse d mudline or other coring problems), the APCT-3 was deployed i n Hole B. The APCT-3 fits directly into the coring shoe of the AP C and consists of a battery pack, a data logger, and a platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over a temperature range fro m $0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Before entering the borehole, the tool is first stopped a t the mudline for $5~\mathrm{min}$ to thermally equilibrate with bottom water. However, the lowest temperature recorded during the run was occasionally used instead of the average temperature at the mudline a s an estimate of the bottom water temperature because (1) it wa s more repeatable and (2) the bottom water is expected to have th e lowest temperature in the profile. When the APC is plunged int o the formation, there is an instantaneous temperature rise from frictional heating. This heat gradually dissipates into the surroundin g sediment as the temperature at the APCT-3 equilibrates toward th e temperature of the sediment. After the APC penetrated the sediment, it was held in place for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ while the APCT-3 recorded th e temperature of the cutting shoe every second.  

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment was estimated b y applying a mathematical heat-conduction model to the temperatur e decay record (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The synthetic therma l decay curve for the APCT-3 is a function of the geometry and thermal properties of the probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Hora i and Von Herzen, 1985). Equilibrium temperature was estimated b y applying a fitting procedure (Pribnow et al., 2000). However, wher e the APC did not achieve a full stroke or where ship heave pulled th e APC up from full penetration, the temperature equilibration curv e is disturbed and temperature determination is less accurate. Th e nominal accuracy of the APCT-3 temperature measurements i s $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

APCT-3 temperature data were combined with measurement s of thermal conductivity (see Thermal conductivity) obtained fro m core sections to obtain heat flow values. Heat flow was calculate d according to the Bullard (1954) method, to be consistent with th e synthesis of ODP heat flow data by Pribnow et al. (2000).  

# Data preconditioning  

The data acquired using the shipboard logging systems wer e conditioned to remove outliers related to end caps, voids, an d cracks. A simple script written in MATLAB removed these dat a points for plotting and visualization purposes. NGR data wer e treated only by culling the first point of every core to eliminate cor e disturbance effects. WRMSL magnetic susceptibility and $P$ -wav e velocity data were treated by culling the first and last point of eac h section to eliminate end cap effects. The uppermost three points o f each core were also eliminated from WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data to avoid core disturbance. In addition, $P$ -wave velocitie s $>\!1750\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ were deemed unrealistic and were culled, except for Site s U1486, U1487, and U1490, where a $2050~\mathrm{m/s}$ threshold was use d because of the large volume of volcanogenic-rich material present, which was associated with peaks in magnetic susceptibility.  

As with WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data, the first and las t measurements of core sections were removed from all WRMS L GRA density data to correct for end cap effects. In addition, unrealistic GRA bulk density values of less than $1.2~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were remove d because they most likely relate to sediment cracks. Following th e initial treatment, a Hampel filter was applied to the WRMSL GR A density data to detect and remove noise. This filter computes a sliding median window with a user-defined window length and calculates the median absolute deviation of each data point about it s window median. If the data point differs from the median by mor e than a user-defined number of absolute deviations, the point i s culled. The size of the window and deviation limit was varied depending on data type and site (see Table T8 for site-specific procedures). In addition to the data preconditioning to remove unreliabl e data points, GRA density data were detrended by a linear regressio n to remove the linear compaction trend. All cleaned data are included as tables in each site chapter.

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Continuous sedimentary sections cannot be collected from  a single IODP borehole due to gaps that occur between successiv e cores, even when nominal recovery is $100\%$ or greater (Ruddiman e t al., 1987; Hagelberg et al., 1995). Consequently, to meet the scientific objectives of Expedition 363 we drilled more than one hole a t each site to ensure that a column of cored section as complete a s possible was assembled (“spliced”) from selected intervals of separate holes (see also OFFSPLICE in Supplementary material).  

Constructing a spliced section follows two similar but separat e activities. The first is to track the downward coring progress of eac h hole after the first hole is completed at a given site. The stratigraphic correlator identifies and links features to previously drille d cores at this site while the hole is being deepened and advises th e driller if adjustments are needed to avoid alignment of intercor e gaps between holes. To do this while the drill bit is advancing relie s on measurements obtained within a few minutes of the time core s reach the core laboratory and are curated; during Expedition 363 w e primarily used magnetic susceptibility and GRA bulk density measurements obtained on the STMSL. At Sites U1488 and U149 0 within intervals with very low magnetic susceptibility (notably below ${\sim}100$ mbsf at Site U1488 and between $\mathord{\sim}20$ and 175 mbsf at Sit e U1490), $P$ -wave velocity proved to be the most useful for rapid correlation. At these sites, we used the WRMSL to collect GRA density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity data at $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolutio n immediately after the cores were brought on deck. The STMSL wa s then used to collect higher resolution $(2.5\ \mathrm{cm})$ GRA density an d magnetic susceptibility data after the cores equilibrated to roo m temperature (see Physical properties).  

The second part of stratigraphic correlation is joining interval s of proven correlation between two or more holes to assemble a continuous spliced record. The goal is to construct a downhole “map ” that will guide samplers to the most continuous stratigraphic section available at that site. The stratigraphic correlator begins b y identifying a tie point in each core of every hole that places it i n stratigraphic position most in agreement with cores in neighborin g holes. This step is referred to as “compositing.” To do this, the correlator uses several types of information to identify features common to cores from multiple holes. Although not used during thi s expedition, downhole log measurements can also be incorporate d to establish the proper stratigraphic position of core data that ma y be unclear due to incomplete core recovery. During Expedition 363, we used WRMSL measurements of magnetic susceptibility an d GRA density, similar to those obtained from the STMSL (only a t higher resolution, usually at $2.5\ \,\mathrm{cm}$ measurement intervals fo r WRMSL versus $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ from the STMSL) plus $P$ -wave velocity (fro m the WRMSL PWL), NGR, color reflectance, and color spectroscop y $\left(\mathbb{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}\right.$ and RGB), aided at times by core photographs. This procedure is intended to locate gaps in the sedimentary section of an y hole and then find where those gaps may be present in the recovered sediment of one or more adjacent holes at that site. Usually tw o complete holes and a third partial hole must be cored at a single sit e in order to be able to construct a complete section in the interva l cored with the APC system.  

When all cores at a site are composited, the stratigraphic correlator begins with the most reliable mudline core (the one that recovered the seafloor) and works downhole through the collection o f composited cores to construct an unbroken splice of the most favorable intervals. Many criteria are used in selecting which intervals, joined by tie points, offer the most complete stratigraphic succes

sion (see discussion in each site chapter). The product of this effor t is a spliced record. Additional holes can be cored to allow for th e construction of additional splices.  

Constructing composite and splice intervals during Expeditio n 363 followed the basic strategy first developed during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 138 (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995) and refine d during subsequent legs. This same approach is now common practice on all high-resolution paleoceanographic expeditions, althoug h the measurements on individual cores and the computer softwar e used to match events between holes and to construct the splice ar e not the same in all cases.  

The procedure for these activities involved consideration of several different depth scales (Figure F20). In this example, five core s were recovered from Holes A and B; Core B1 is intentionally shorte r than A1 to ensure that intercore gaps do not align between the tw o holes. Core B2 unintentionally had less than full recovery. The CSFA scale was established by adding the curated core length (brow n intervals) to the depth of each core top determined by the DSF scale. If recovery is ${>}100\%$ , this results in overlap between cores (red). Th e CCSF scale corrects for this and other inadequacies of the CSF- A scale.  

The CCSF scale is based on locating features common to core s in multiple holes at a given site and working from the top of the sit e downward to select tie points (red dashed lines) that correlate features in one hole to those in another. Because of core expansion an d the unavoidable absence of complete recovery at the tops and bottoms of cores, Holes A and B on the CCSF scale are longer than the y are on the CSF-A scale. The primary splice on the CCSF scale at th e far right is constructed by combining selected intervals between ti e points so that coring gaps and disturbed sections are excluded, ideally resulting in a complete stratigraphic sequence. This procedur e assumes identical sediment thickness between tie points joinin g two holes, which may not be the case due to differences in accumulation rate and/or compaction and expansion due to the coring process. Consequently, the CCSF depth of a sedimentary horizon in th e splice is not necessarily equivalent to the CCSF depth for the sam e horizon not included in the splice, as illustrated by the green dashe d lines joining the green horizon in Cores A3 and B3. The dept h scales used during Expedition 363 followed IODP conventio n (http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines) and are describe d below.  

# Core depth below seafloor scale  

We began the process of building a composite section by assigning a depth to the top of each core, based initially on the DSF. DSF i s a drill string measurement, determined as the difference betwee n (1) the length of the drill string between the rig floor and the top o f the cored interval and (2) the length of the drill string between th e rig floor and the mudline (assumed to be the seafloor). DSF erro r includes phenomena such as pipe and BHA stretch and compression, tides, and uncompensated heave. Tidal influence on this dept h measurement can be significant (Hagelberg et al., 1995), and th e prediction of tides is generally useful for guiding drilling to avoi d gap alignment (Mix, Tiedemann, Blum, et al., 2003). The full tida l range at some Expedition 363 sites was slightly more than $4\;\mathrm{m}$ an d appeared to contribute to slow diurnal changes in the size of intercore gaps. This was especially prevalent at Site U1482.  

The depth to a given position within any core was then determined relative to the DSF core top depth. The CSF-A depth scal e therefore combined the DSF core-top depth with the curated lengt h of the core after retrieval. The CSF-A depth scale is equivalent t o the historical Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP), ODP, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program mbsf scale and is specific to eac h hole. For the Expedition 363 Proceedings volume site chapters, w e use mbsf instead of CSF-A for simplicity. It is important to note tha t the “within-core” position of any given sedimentary feature ma y change after recovery due to the relief of overburden, gas-induce d expansion, or water loss. Thus, error in the CSF-A scale include s both drilling effects and core expansion effects. For example, th e CSF-A scale permits stratigraphically impossible overlaps betwee n successive cores caused by gas-induced expansion. In principle, th e composite depth scale, described below, eliminates such artifacts.  

# Core composite depth below seafloor scale  

The construction of a common, composite depth scale for  a given IODP site involves identification of coeval, laterally continuous features in all drilled holes (which will generally occur at different depths on the CSF-A depth scales for each hole). Onc e correlative features were identified during Expedition 363, th e depth of individual cores was offset relative to the CSF-A dept h scale in that hole such that the features aligned on a commo n (CCSF) depth scale. This depth scale is equivalent to the historica l ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program meters composit e depth (mcd) scale. In constructing the CCSF scale, the depths of individual cores were offset by a constant amount (without stretchin g or squeezing within individual cores). This composite depth scal e provided good estimates of the length of coring gaps and formed th e basis for developing the spliced record (on the CCSF scale). The vertical depth offset of every core in every hole was tabulated in an affine table, one of the principal “deliverables” of the stratigraphi c correlator.  

The CCSF scale was built by correlating features downhole fro m the mudline. The mudline established the top of the stratigraphi c section, anchoring the entire composite depth scale for all core s from all holes at a single site. Compositing proceeded sequentiall y by establishing specific tie points among the various holes, workin g from the mudline (anchor) core to the bottom of the drilled section. The CCSF scale very rarely (if ever) resulted in alignment of all coeval features because of the contrasting effects of coring-induce d stretching and squeezing among cores, as well as stratigraphic differences between holes.  

In principle, if core gaps never come into alignment between al l holes at a site, and if recovery is sufficiently high, then it should b e possible to correlate each successive core in one hole to a core fro m an adjacent hole, all the way to the bottom of a drilled section. However, aligned coring gaps across all holes at a site are often difficul t to avoid. In the case of aligned core gaps between holes, cores belo w the gap are no longer tied to the anchor core. They can, however, still be tied to one another to produce correlated sections that ar e “floating” on the CCSF scale. Such floating ties were denoted in th e affine table as “APPENDED” or “SET,” depending on whether th e offset to the top of that section was estimated by inheriting the absolute offset of the core above (APPEND) or by assuming a constan t growth rate of the difference between mbsf and CCSF (SET). Th e second method (SET) is preferable because it produces a more realistic estimate of the core gap, based on estimates of the expansion o f overlying cores from the same hole.  

During the process of constructing the composite section, th e CCSF depth becomes systematically larger than that of the CSF- A depth for equivalent horizons. This expansion, which during Expedition 363 was as much as $25\%$ , has four main causes (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2001):  

1. Decompression of the sediment as it is brought to atmospheric pressure;   
2. Pore-space gases coming out of solution, warming, and expanding;   
3. Stretching that occurs as part of the coring process; and   
4. Recovering borehole wall sediment that fell downhole and was cored.  

# Splice  

Once the CCSF scale was developed and the between-core gap s identified, a complete stratigraphic section (splice) was constructe d by combining selected intervals between the previously establishe d tie points. In the case of core gaps aligned across all holes, an y spliced sections below the gap were appended to those above an d designated as floating splice sections. In some cases, the amount o f missing section between anchored and floating sections can be determined using downhole logs. However, we logged only one sit e (U1482) during Expedition 363, so the amount of missing section i n aligned core gaps could only be estimated at that site. Wher e needed at other sites, the length of the missing section in the splic e was estimated based on the percent expansion observed where w e had a continuous splice.  

# Intervals outside of the splice  

Once the splice was constructed, we mapped into the splic e those intervals not included in the splice itself by treating the splic e as a downhole log. The methodology is based on identifying correlative tie points at the highest possible resolution, with linear adjustments of depths between ties. This scale was also designated as th e CCSF scale because it is roughly equivalent to the splice depth. I n reality, these depth scales are only equivalent to the extent that th e correlations are accurate. At core boundaries, where evidence o f stretching and compression were most prevalent, these detaile d depth maps are considered less accurate. Thus, the CCSF scale i s not precisely the same at all holes within a site except exactly wher e the splice tie points are made. Additional details and guidance ar e found in the individual site chapters.  

# Measurements and methods for correlation  

For the majority of sites, initial development of composite sections (CCSF scale) was based on the stratigraphic correlation o f magnetic susceptibility data sets acquired from the WRMSL an d the STMSL as soon as possible after core retrieval. In many cases, this method allowed stratigraphic correlation to take place in nea r real time so that bit depth could be adjusted as necessary to avoi d alignment of core gaps between holes. However, no single variabl e proved to be universally powerful at all sites for stratigraphic correlation or splice construction. At all sites, therefore, correlatio n proceeded through a combination of WRMSL, STMSL, NGR, an d digitized color reflectance (RGB and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) data. Color reflectanc e data were extracted from core images acquired from the Sectio n Half Imaging Logger (SHIL; RGB data) and the SHMSL $\left(\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{b}^{\ast}\right.$ data). Magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, and $L^{\ast}$ (or $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ an d $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) were measured at 2.5 or $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals, whereas RGB value s were calculated at $0.5~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals in the form of $0.5~\mathrm{cm}$ average s measured continuously along a $1.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ wide strip centered on digita l color SHIL images. Details on instrument calibrations, settings, an d measurement intervals for Expedition 363 are given in Physica l properties (Table T6).  

Compositing and splicing were accomplished using Correlato r software (version 2.1). This procedure generated standard affine tables (listings of the vertical offset in meters added to each core t o generate the CCSF scale) and splice interval tables (listings of th e specific core intervals used to construct the splice). These table s were uploaded into the LIMS database, which then linked the appropriate depth scale to any associated data set.  

# Geochemistry  

The shipboard geochemistry program characterized the gases, interstitial water, and sediment composition of the cores recovere d during Expedition 363. Headspace samples were analyzed for routine shipboard safety and pollution prevention purposes. Interstitia l water chemistry, sedimentary carbonate $\left(\boldsymbol{\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}}\right)$ ), and total organi c carbon (TOC) content were analyzed to understand the depositional history of each site and guide shore-based sampling and research.  Selected  sites  were  also  targeted  for  high-resolutio n interstitial water sampling to reconstruct the vertical water mas s structure (e.g., McDuff, 1985; Adkins et al., 2002; Insua et al., 2014 ) across a range of sampled water depths $(\mathord{\sim}880\mathrm{-}3420\;\mathrm{m})$ in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum,  a key scientific objective of Expedition 363.  

# Sedimentary gas geochemistry  

Routine analysis of hydrocarbon gases in sediment cores is  a part of standard IODP shipboard monitoring to ensure that the sediment being drilled does not contain more than the level of hydrocarbons that is safe for drilling operations. The most commo n method of hydrocarbon monitoring used is the analysis of gas samples obtained from sediment samples (headspace analysis). Sediment gas composition was typically determined once per cor e (usually at the top of Section 7) over the total stratigraphic interval cored at a given site. For this analysis, a $3\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ bulk sediment sampl e was collected immediately after core retrieval from the freshly exposed top end of a core section using a brass boring tool or plasti c syringe. The sediment plug was placed in a glass vial and sealed wit h an aluminum crimp cap with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/silicone septa. The vial was then heated to $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for ${\sim}30~\mathrm{min}$ to evolv e hydrocarbon gases from the sediment plug before analysis. Whe n consolidated or lithified samples were encountered, chips of material were placed in the vial and sealed. For analysis, a $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ volum e of headspace gas was extracted from the sealed sample vial using  a gas-tight $5~\mathrm{mL}$ PTFE Luer lock glass syringe and analyzed by ga s chromatography.  

Headspace samples were injected into the Agilent/Hewlet t Packard 6890 Series II gas chromatograph (GC3) fitted with a flam e ionization detector (FID) or the natural gas analyzer (NGA). Th e NGA was run for the analysis of Site U1482 samples. The GC3 i s equipped with an 8 ft $(2.4\;\mathrm{m})$ ( $2.00\;\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter [ID]; $\%$ inc h outer diameter [OD]) stainless steel column packed with 80/10 0 mesh HayeSep (Restek) and an FID set at $250^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The GC3 ove n temperature was programmed to hold a temperature of $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ fo r $8.25\ \mathrm{min}$ , ramp at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ to $150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , hold that temperature for  5 min, and return to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ postrun, for a total run time of $15~\mathrm{min}$ . Helium was used as the carrier gas. The GC3 system determine s concentrations of methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propan e $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ . For hydrocarbon analysis, the NGA is outfitted with an Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a n Agilent DB-1 dimethylpolysiloxane capillary column $\left(60\mathrm{~m~}\times0.320\right.$ mm diameter $\times\,1.50\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ film thickness) fitted with an FID and usin g He as carrier gas (constant flow of $21\,\mathrm{mL/min})$ . The NGA oven temperature was programmed to hold a temperature of $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $2\,\mathrm{{min}}$ , ramp at a rate of $8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ to $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , and then ramp at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ t o $200^{\circ}C$ , with a final holding time of $5.1\ \mathrm{min}$ . The FID temperatur e was $250^{\circ}C$ . Data were collected and evaluated with an Agilen t ChemStation data-handling program. The chromatographic response was calibrated to different gas standards with variable quantities of low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Gas components ar e reported as parts per million by volume (ppmv) of the injected sample.  

# Sediment geochemistry  

For shipboard sediment geochemistry, the $10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of oven-drie d sediment $105^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ ) used for physical property measurement s of MAD (see Physical properties) was crushed to a fine powder using an agate pestle and mortar and sampled to analyze inorgani c carbon, total carbon (TC), and total nitrogen (TN). Because one o f the expedition objectives was to document Neogene variations i n $C a C O_{3}$ accumulation rates, the MAD and sediment sampling resolution was increased from the standard one sample per core to  a minimum of three samples per core. At the final site (U1490), separate samples were taken for geochemistry so that analyses could b e finished before the end of the expedition. These samples wer e freeze-dried for ${\sim}24\,\mathrm{h}$ before processing.  

# Elemental analysis  

TC and total TN contents of the sediment samples were determined with a ThermoElectron FlashEA 1112 carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur  (CHNS)  elemental  analyzer  equipped  with   a ThermoElectron packed column CHNS/NCS gas chromatograp h and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Approximately 10–1 5 mg of dried, ground sediment was weighed into a tin capsule, an d the sample was combusted at $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in a stream of oxygen. The reaction gases were passed through a reduction chamber to reduce nitrogen  oxides  to $\Nu_{2}$ and  were  then  separated  by  the  ga s chromatograph before detection by the TCD. For samples with hig h carbon content $(>4\mathrm{\wt\%})$ ), measurements were calibrated with th e La Luna shale $(11.52\%C)$ and Buffalo River sediment $(3.35\%C)$ reference materials. For samples with low carbon content $(<\!4\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ , th e Thermo Soil Reference Material 33840025, which was run approximately every 10 samples, was used for verification. Repeated $\left(n=7\right)$ ) analyses of the standards yielded a precision of better than $0.08\%$ fo r TC.  

# Inorganic and organic carbon content  

Total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentration was determined using a UIC 5011 $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Between 10 and $12~\mathrm{mg}$ of dried, ground sediment was weighed and reacted with 2 M HCl. The liberated $C O_{2}$ was titrated, and the end-point was determined by  a photodetector. Calcium carbonate $\left(\mathbf{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ content, expressed a s weight percent, was calculated from the TIC content, assuming tha t all evolved $C O_{2}$ was derived from the dissolution of $C a C O_{3}$ by th e following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\times8.33\;(w t\%).}
$$  

No correction was made for the presence of other carbonat e minerals. Precision during individual batches of analyses was determined by running a pure $C a C O_{3}$ standard approximately every 1 0 samples. Typical precision assessed from 36 replicate analyses of  a carbonate sample was $1\%$ . The detection limit for $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ define d here as three times the standard deviation of the blank $(2\mathrm{~M~HCl})$ , was $0.1\%$ for $100~\mathrm{mg}$ of pelagic clay. TOC content was calculated a s the difference between total carbon (TC; measured on the elemental analyzer) and TIC (measured by coulometry):  

$$
\mathrm{TOC}=\mathrm{TC}-\mathrm{TIC}.
$$  

For selected samples with very low organic carbon the “acidification method” of TOC analysis was also applied to improve analytical precision. Approximately $30~\mathrm{mg}$ of dried sample was weighe d into a silver capsule and treated with small aliquots of $2\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HCl}$ a t room temperature to remove $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3};$ samples were treated with repeated aliquots until no further reaction was visible and then drie d on a hot plate at $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . TOC concentration was determined using  a Thermo Electron Flash EA 1112 element analyzer for total carbon, calibrated using the Thermo Reference Material 33840025 $\mathrm{TOC}=$ $2.26\%)$ ). The acidification method resulted in errors with TN measurements and so was not employed after Site U1482.  

# Interstitial water geochemistry  

# Interstitial water collection  

For interstitial water analyses, $5{-}10\;\mathrm{cm}$ long whole rounds wer e cut on the catwalk immediately after core retrieval, capped, an d taken to the laboratory for processing. For Sites U1482, U1483, U1484, U1487, and U1490, we sampled two whole rounds per cor e in the upper 30 mbsf of Hole A, typically from the bottom of Sections 3 and 6. Deeper than $30~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , one whole round per core wa s taken, typically from the bottom of Section 6, or from every othe r core when using the HLAPC system, from the second to last sectio n of the core. Whole-round thickness was increased to a maximum o f $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ when $5\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ long whole rounds no longer yielded enough water for shipboard and shore-based analyses.  

At Sites U1485, U1486, U1488, and U1489, $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ long wholeround samples were taken from each section (every $1.5\;\mathrm{m})$ ) for highresolution interstitial water sampling, typically from Hole A unles s Hole A was terminated early due to a missed mudline, in which cas e Hole B was sampled. High-resolution sampling was conducted to 5 4 mbsf at Site U1485, 82 mbsf at Site U1489, and 150 mbsf at Site s U1486 and U1488. Shipboard analyses of interstitial water wer e conducted on two whole rounds per core (typically from the botto m of Sections 3 and 6) over high-resolution sampling intervals and o n one whole round per core (typically from the bottom of Section 6 ) below the high-resolution intervals. The remainder of the sample s were split, fixed, and archived for shore-based analyses. For section s where both shipboard and shore-based analyses were performed, whole-round thickness was increased to $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ to ensure sufficien t water volume was recovered for all analyses. At each site, a ${\sim}50~\mathrm{mL}$ sample was taken from the mudline of the first core recovered fo r comparison between bottom water and interstitial water. Wholeround samples that could not be immediately processed were store d under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glove bag.  

After extrusion from the core liner, the outer surface of eac h whole-round sample was carefully scraped with a spatula to remov e potential contamination from seawater and sediment smearing i n the borehole. In APC cores, ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{cm}$ of material from the outer diameter was removed, as well as from the top and bottom surfaces. The remaining sediment $({\sim}150{-}300~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ was placed into a titanium squeezer modified after the stainless steel squeezer of Manheim and Sayles (1974). Gauge forces up to a maximum of 35,000 l b were applied using a laboratory hydraulic press to extract interstitial water.  

Squeezed interstitial water was filtered through a prewashe d Whatman No. 1 filter placed in the squeezers above a titaniu m screen. The first ${\sim}0.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of squeezed water was discarded to avoi d contamination. The squeezed interstitial water was filtered into  a precleaned plastic syringe attached to the squeezing assembly an d then through a $0.45\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ polysulfone disc filter.  

# Shipboard interstitial water analyses  

Interstitial water samples were analyzed on board the ship following the protocols in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Alkalinity and pH were measured immediately after squeezin g following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinity was estimated using a Fisher temperature-compensated handheld refractometer. A few drops of interstitial water were applied to th e daylight plate assembly with an eyedropper, and the measuremen t was read through the eyepiece. Typical measurement precisio n based on repeated measurements of International Association fo r the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) seawater was $^{\pm1}$ . T o monitor for contamination, $18.2\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ nanopure water blanks wer e analyzed at the start and finish of each round of measurements.  

The pH was measured with a combined glass electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with an autotitrato r (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) using 0.1 M HCl at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The $\mathsf{p H}$ dat a are reported on the NBS scale. Prior to running, the electrode wa s calibrated using a series of NBS buffers with a $\mathsf{p H}$ of 4, 7, and 10. Three milliliters of interstitial water was titrated with 0.1 M HCl a t $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Standard ratios were calculated by running a series of standard solutions of different concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (5, 20, 40, 50, and $100\ \mathrm{mM}$ ) and IAPSO seawater, with the standard correctio n factor specified before each analysis depending on alkalinity ranges. For calibration, IAPSO standard seawater was analyzed every 8–1 0 samples or after a period of nonuse to check instrument accuracy. An in-house seawater standard (surface seawater collected at Sit e U1482) was also analyzed at this frequency as an additional contro l on precision and accuracy. Repeated analyses of standards yielded  a 1σ precision better than $3\%$ .  

# Ion chromatography  

Major cations $(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+},\mathbf{N}\mathbf{a}^{2+},\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+},$ and $\!\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ) and anions (Cl–, ${\mathrm{SO}}_{4}^{\ 2-}$ , and $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ ) were measured using a Metrohm 850 professional io n chromatograph (IC) with an 858 professional sample processor. Interstitial water was diluted at a 1:100 ratio with $18.2\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ nanopur e water in preparation for ion chromatography analysis. The IAPS O seawater standard was diluted at a range of 1:20 to 1:500 to create  a five-point calibration curve. The relative standard deviation fo r each calibration curve varied from $0.2\%$ to $5.2\%$ but was typicall y better than $3\%$ .  

Instrument accuracy was checked by running a 1:150 dilution o f IAPSO standard seawater every ${\sim}10$ samples, and a new calibratio n curve was run if measured concentrations deviated from expecte d values. Precision (1σ) was determined from the repeated analyses o f the standards and was better than $2\%$ for each cation and anion concentration (Table T9). Results are presented as concentrations i n millimolars or micromolars, and valence states are left off of cation s and anions for consistency with results from samples run on the inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICPAES).  

# Chlorinity  

In addition to the IC analysis, Cl concentration was acquired using a Metrohm 785 DMP autotitrator and silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ solution calibrated against repeated titrations of an IAPSO standard. A $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of interstitial water was diluted with $30~\mathrm{mL}$ of $0.32\ N\ H N O_{3}$ then titrated with $0.09866~\mathrm{M~AgNO_{3}}.$ Repeate d analyses of the IAPSO standard and an in-house seawater consistency standard yielded a 1σ precision ${\sim}0.65\%$ , which is identical t o precision for Cl run on the IC. The titration data are reported in th e LIMS database; however, in the summary figures we only repor t [Cl] data obtained by IC.  

# Spectrophotometry  

Dissolved ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$ ) and phosphate $\mathrm{(PO_{4}^{\ 3-})}$ concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry using an Agilen t Technologies Cary Series 100 UV-visible spectrophotometer wit h an Agilent Technologies SPS3 autosampler following the protocol i n Gieskes et al. (1991). Samples were diluted prior to color development so that the highest $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ concentration was ${<}1000\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ and th e highest $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ concentration was ${<}3000~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ with $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ dilution s guided by $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ peaks from the IC results. $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ was measured using the ammonium molybdate method described in Gieskes et al. (1991) with appropriate dilutions. Standards were prepared wit h each run to create 11-point (for $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\ 3-}$ ) and 14-point (for $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ ) calibration curves to convert absorbance to concentration. A standar d was run independent of the calibration curve to check for accuracy, and sample replicates were run to check for precision. Precisio n (1σ) was better than $5\%$ on $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ concentration measurements an d better than $10\%$ on $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ concentration measurements.

Inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy  

The following suite of minor and trace elements was analyzed b y ICP-AES with a Teledyne Prodigy high-dispersion ICP spectrometer: boron (B), barium (Ba), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), silicon (Si), and strontium (Sr). The general method for shipboard ICP-AE S analysis of samples is described in Murray et al. (2000) and the use r manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

Samples and standards were diluted at a 1:20 ratio using $2\%$ ultrapure $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and spiked with $10\,\mathrm{ppm}$ yttrium (Y). Batches of $^{30-}$ 50 samples were run with an 11-point calibration curve created using synthetic seawater spiked with minor and trace elements $(1\%,$ $2.5\%$ , $5\%_{:}$ , $10\%$ , $25\%$ , $50\%$ , $75\%$ , $100\%$ , $200\%$ , $500\%$ , and $1000\%$ ; value s are percent of the primary standards) and used to convert background-corrected intensities to concentrations. A drift solution wa s run every ${\sim}12$ samples, and blanks were run with every batch t o check for contamination and allow for blank subtractions. Concentrations of Ba, Fe, Mn, and Si in IAPSO standard seawater commonly fall below detection limit, so an aliquot of IAPSO seawate r was spiked with minor elements and three to five samples were ru n as unknowns on each run. Up to three replicates of the $50\%$ synthetic seawater standard were also run as checks on precision. Th e standard deviation of these analyses indicated the 1σ precision o f each run was better than $6.5\%$ for most wavelengths (Table T10).  

Multiple wavelengths were measured for each element, and reported wavelengths were selected based on possible interferences, linearity of calibration curves, and the precision and accuracy o f IAPSO seawater measurements:  

$\mathrm{Li}=670.784\,\mathrm{nm}$ (except for Site U1483, for which $\mathrm{Li}=610.364$ nm).  

$\mathrm{B}=249.772\,\mathrm{nm}$ .   
$\mathrm{Si}=288.158\;\mathrm{nm}$ .   
$\mathrm{Mn}=257.610\;\mathrm{nm}$ $\mathrm{Fe}=259.940\,\mathrm{nm}$ .   
$\mathrm{Sr}=421.552\;\mathrm{nm}.$ .   
$\mathrm{Ba}=493.409\,\mathrm{nm}$ .  

Detection limits for the trace/minor elements, defined here a s three times the standard deviation of the blank intensities converte d to concentrations, are given for each run in Table T11. These value s are multiplied by 20 to account for sample dilution.  

The high concentration of salt in the interstitial water samples a t the 1:20 dilution requires matrix-matching of standards and samples, so standards were prepared with a $\mathrm{NaCl}$ matrix solution t o have an ionic strength similar to $20\times$ diluted seawater. A stock standard solution was gravimetrically prepared from ultrapure primar y standards (SPC Science PlasmaCAL) diluted in $1\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . Thi s solution was diluted, along with the NaCl matrix, to have minor element concentrations bracketing the samples. Analytical precisio n was estimated by repeated analyses of the spiked IAPSO seawate r (Table T10). Results from the ICP-AES are reported as elemental (rather than ionic) concentrations in millimolars or micromolar s due to the insensitivity of ICP-AES to valence state or protonation. However, consideration of typical interstitial water chemistry suggests that [B] can reasonably be assumed to be the sum of $\mathrm{[B(OH)_{3}]}$ and $\mathrm{\left[B(OH)_{4}^{\ -}\right]}$ , $\left[\mathbf{Ba}\right]$ to be $[\mathbf{B}\mathbf{a}^{2+}]_{:}$ , [Fe] to be $\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right]_{:}$ , [Li] to be $\left[\mathrm{Li^{+}}\right]_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $[\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Mn}}]$ to be $[\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}]$ , [Si] to be $\mathrm{[H_{2}S i O_{3}]}$ , and [Sr] to be $[S\mathbf{r}^{2+}]$ .

# Downhole measurements  

Downhole logs determine various in situ physical, chemical, an d structural properties of the formation penetrated by a borehole. Th e data are collected when all coring operations at a given hole are finished and are most often monitored in real time as the downhol e tool is raised up through the borehole. The data are available for incorporating into science operations shortly after all logging is completed at that site. Where core recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log data may provide the only reliable characterization of the formation. Where core recovery is good, certain log measurements provide a direct tie to core data and lead to highly reliable integrate d interpretations.  

Downhole logs measure formation properties at scales betwee n those obtained from laboratory measurements on core sample s (centimeter scale) and those from conventional geophysical survey s (meter scale). They are useful in calibrating the interpretation o f seismic survey data (e.g., through the use of synthetic seismograms ) and provide a necessary link for the integrated understanding o f physical and chemical properties on different scales.  

During Expedition 363, downhole logging measurements wer e conducted in Hole U1482C only.  

# Wireline logging  

Logs were recorded during Expedition 363 with standar d Schlumberger tools lowered into the hole when coring was finished. Two tool strings were used in separate log deployments. Bot h strings contained a telemetry cartridge for communicating via wireline to the Schlumberger data acquisition system (MultiAcquisitio n and Imaging System or “MAXIS” unit) on the drillship.  

The first logging tool string (Figure F21; Tables T13, T14), informally called the “triple combo,” recorded natural gamma radiation (NGR; using the Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ra y Sonde [HNGS]), porosity (using the Accelerator Porosity Sond e [APS]), formation density (using the Litho-Density Sonde [HLDS]), and electrical resistivity (using the High-Resolution Laterolog Arra y [HRLA]/Phasor Dual Induction-Spherically Focused Resistivit y Tool). We also recorded magnetic susceptibility using a nonstandard wireline tool designed by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observator y (LDEO) (magnetic susceptibility sonde [MSS]). In addition, a caliper tool measured borehole diameter to provide information abou t borehole integrity and log data quality.  

The second logging deployment used the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string (Figure F21; Tables T13, T14) t o provide an oriented resistivity image of the borehole wall plus $P_{-}$ - and S-wave acoustic velocity of the formation using the Dipol e Shear Sonic Imager (DSI). Magnetometry was measured with  a fluxgate magnetometer in the General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT) that simultaneously measured any borehole deviation fro m vertical. The HNGS was included to record NGR to depth-matc h features between the logging runs, and a caliper again measure d borehole diameter to indicate hole and data quality.  

To prepare for logging of Hole U1482C, the hole was cleared o f drilling cuttings with a mud sweep followed by flushing with seawater. The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was set at $74.7~\mathrm{m}$ drillin g depth below seafloor (DSF) to cover the most unstable upper part o f the hole; therefore, an attenuated NGR signal is the only availabl e logging data for the upper $\sim\!75\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hole. Both tool strings wer e lowered downhole on a seven-conductor wireline cable to the total depth before being pulled up at constant speed, typically ${\sim}550\;\mathrm{m/h}$ for the triple combo and $500{-}550~\mathrm{m/h}$ for the FMS-sonic.  

Each tool string deployment is termed a logging “run.” Durin g each run, tool strings were lowered and pulled up in the hole several times to check repeatability and to increase coverage of the FM S borehole images. Each lowering or hauling-up of the tool strin g while collecting data constitutes a “pass.” Incoming data were recorded and monitored in real time on the Modular Configuratio n MAXIS (MCM) logging computer. Ship heave was minimal durin g logging at Hole U1482C, so the wireline heave compensator (WHC ) was not used.  

# Logged sediment properties and tool measurement principles  

Logged properties and the principles used in the tools tha t measure them are briefly described below. The main logs collecte d during this expedition are listed in Table T13. More detaile d information on individual tools and their geological application s may be found in Serra (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989, 1994), Rider (1996), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), and Elli s and Singer (2007). A complete online list of acronyms for th e Schlumberger  tools  and  measurement  curves  is  a t http://iodp.tamu.edu/tools/logging/index.html.  

# Natural gamma radiation  

The HNGS was used on both the triple combo and FMS-soni c tool strings to measure NGR in the formation. The HNGS uses tw o bismuth germanate scintillation detectors and five-window spectroscopy to determine concentrations of potassium (in weight per

cent), thorium (in parts per million), and uranium (in parts pe r million) from the characteristic gamma ray energies of isotopes i n the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series, which dominate th e natural radiation spectrum. The computation of elemental abundances uses a least-squares method of extracting U, Th, and K elemental concentrations from the spectral measurements. The HNG S filters out gamma ray energies below $500\;\mathrm{keV},$ , eliminating sensitivit y to bentonite or KCl in the drilling mud and improving measuremen t accuracy. The HNGS also provides a measure of the total gamm a ray emission (HSGR) and uranium-free or computed gamma ra y emission (HCGR) in American Petroleum Institute units (gAPI). The HNGS response is influenced by the borehole diameter, an d therefore the HNGS data are corrected for borehole diameter variations during acquisition.  

An additional NGR sensor was housed in the Enhanced Digita l Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC), which was used primarily to communicate data to the surface. This sensor includes a sodium iodid e scintillation detector that also measures the total NGR emission o f the formation. It is not a spectral tool (i.e., it does not provide U, Th, and K concentrations), but it provides total gamma radiation fo r each pass.  

Including the HNGS in both tool strings enabled us to use th e gamma ray data for precise depth match processing between logging strings and provided a reliable means of core-log integration.  

# Density and photoelectric factor  

Formation density was measured with the HLDS. The sond e contains a radioactive cesium $\left({}^{137}\mathrm{Cs}\right)$ gamma ray source $(622\mathrm{~keV})$ and both far and near gamma ray detectors mounted on a shielde d skid, which is pressed against the borehole wall by a hydraulicall y activated decentralizing arm. Gamma rays emitted by the sourc e undergo Compton scattering, in which gamma rays are scattered b y electrons in the formation. The number of scattered gamma ray s that reach the detectors is proportional to the density of electrons i n the formation, which is in turn related to bulk density. Porosity ma y also be derived from this bulk density if the matrix (grain) density i s known.  

The HLDS also measures the photoelectric effect (PEF), a measure of the photoelectric absorption of low-energy gamma radiation.  Photoelectric  absorption  occurs  when  gamma  radiatio n energy falls below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of being repeatedly scattere d by electrons in the formation. The PEF is determined by comparin g the counts from the far detector in the high-energy region, wher e only Compton scattering occurs, with those in the low-energy region, where count rates depend on both reactions. Because PEF depends on the atomic number of the elements in the formatio n (heavier elements have higher PEF), it also varies according to th e chemical composition of the minerals present and can be used fo r the identification of the overall mineral make-up of the formation. For example, the PEF of calcite is $5.08\,\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ , illite is $3.03\,\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ , quart z is $1.81~\mathrm{b/e^{-}}$ , and hematite is $21~\mathrm{{b/e^{-}}}$ (Serra, 1984; Schlumberger, 1989). Good contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential for good HLDS logs; poor contact results in underestimation o f density values. Both the density correction and caliper measurement of the hole are used to check the contact quality. The PEF lo g should be used with caution when multiple mud sweeps are used t o stabilize the borehole and especially in washouts, because barium i n the logging mud swamps the signal, regardless of attempts to correct for the mud effect.  

# Porosity  

Formation porosity was measured with the APS. The sonde includes a minitron neutron generator that produces fast $(14.4\;\mathrm{MeV})$ neutrons, along with five neutron detectors (four epithermal an d one thermal) positioned at different distances from the minitron. The tool’s detectors count neutrons that arrive at the detectors afte r being scattered and slowed by collisions with atomic nuclei in th e formation.  

The highest energy loss occurs when neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei, which have practically the same mass as the neutron s (the neutrons bounce off heavier elements without losing much energy). If the hydrogen (i.e., water) concentration is low, as in lowporosity formations, neutrons can travel farther before being captured and the count rates increase at the detector. The opposite effect occurs in high-porosity formations where the water content i s high. However, because hydrogen that is bound to minerals such a s clays or that forms part of hydrocarbon molecules also contributes to the measurement, the raw porosity value is often overestimated and, when possible, should be checked against laboratory-derived values from the core.

Upon reaching thermal energies $(0.025\ \mathrm{eV})$ , neutrons are captured by the nuclei of Cl, Si, B, and other elements, resulting in a gamma ray emission. This neutron capture cross section (Σf) is also measured by the tool.  

# Electrical resistivity  

The HRLA tool provides six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation throughout the logged interval (including the borehole mud resistivity and five measurements o f formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation). The tool sends a focused current into the formation and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constant drop in voltag e across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurements. The array has one central (source) electrode and six electrode s above and below it, which serve alternatively as focusing and returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role of thes e electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool is designed to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the same time and to reduce th e sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects when crossing sharply define d beds that are thinner than the electrode spacing. The design of th e HRLA, which eliminates the need for a surface reference electrode, improves formation resistivity evaluation compared to traditiona l dual induction resistivity methods and allows the full range of resistivity to be measured, from low (e.g., in high-porosity sediment) t o high (e.g., in basalt). The HRLA tool needs to be run centralized i n the borehole for optimal results, so bowspring centralizers wer e used to keep the HRLA in the center of the borehole. Knuckle joint s above the HRLA allowed the density tool to be eccentralized t o maintain good contact with the borehole wall (Figure F21).  

Calcite,  silica,  and  hydrocarbons  are  electrical  insulators, whereas ionic solutions like interstitial water are conductors. Electrical resistivity, therefore, can be used to evaluate porosity for  a given salinity and resistivity of the interstitial water (Schlumberger, 1989). Clay surface conduction also contributes to the resistivit y values, but at high porosities this is a relatively minor effect.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

The MSS is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by LDEO. I t measures the ease with which formations are magnetized when subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetization is ultimatel y related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magnetic minerals (principally magnetite) in the formation. These measurements provide one of the best methods fo r investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy and lithology because the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructiv e and because different lithologies often have strongly contrastin g susceptibilities.  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution measurements with ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ horizontal penetration. The MSS was run as th e lowermost tool in the triple combo tool string, using a specially developed data translation cartridge to enable the MSS to be run i n combination with the Schlumberger tools. The MSS also has an optional single-coil sensor to provide high-resolution measurement s $({\sim}10~\mathrm{cm})$ , but this was not used during Expedition 363 because i t requires a large bowspring to achieve adequate contact with th e borehole wall. This would mean that the MSS would have to be ru n higher up in the tool string so it could be eccentralized and ultimately would have required an additional log run.  

Magnetic susceptibility data from the deep-reading sensor ar e plotted as uncalibrated units. The MSS reading responses are affected by temperature and borehole size (higher temperatures lea d to higher susceptibility measurements). No apparent temperatur e drift was seen in the data, and therefore no corrections were mad e offshore. When the magnetic susceptibility signal in sediment i s very low, the detection limits of the tool may be reached. For qualit y control and environmental correction, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $z$ -axis acceleration, and low-resolutio n borehole conductivity.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The DSI measures the transit times between sonic transmitter s and an array of eight receivers. It combines replicate measurements, thus providing a direct measure of sound velocity through formations that is relatively free from the effects of formation damage an d an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989). Along with the monopole transmitters found on most sonic tools, it also has two crosseddipole transmitters that allow measurement of shear wave velocit y in addition to compressional wave velocity. Dipole measurement s are necessary to measure shear wave velocities in slow formation s where shear wave velocity is less than the velocity of sound in th e borehole fluid. Such slow formations are often encountered in deepocean drilling.  

# Formation MicroScanner  

The FMS provides high-resolution electrical resistivity–base d images of borehole walls. The tool has four orthogonal arms an d pads, each containing 16 button electrodes that are pressed agains t the borehole wall during logging (Figure F21). The electrodes ar e arranged in two diagonally offset rows of eight electrodes each.  A focused current is emitted from the button electrodes into the formation, with a return electrode near the top of the tool. Resistivit y of the formation at the button electrodes is derived from the intensity of current passing through the button electrodes.  

Processing transforms the resistivity measurements into oriented high-resolution images that reveal geologic structures of th e borehole wall. Features such as bedding, stratification, fracturing, slump folding, and bioturbation can be resolved (Luthi, 1990; Salimullah and Stow, 1992; Lovell et al., 1998). Because the images are oriented to magnetic north, further analysis can provide measuremen t of the dip and direction (azimuth) of planar features in the formation. In addition, when the corresponding planar features can b e identified in the recovered core samples, individual core pieces ca n be reoriented with respect to true north.  

Approximately $30\%$ of a borehole with a diameter of $25~\mathrm{cm}$ (9. 8 inches) is imaged during a single pass. Standard procedure is t o make two full uphole passes with the FMS to maximize the chanc e of getting nearly full borehole coverage with the pads. The maximum extension of the caliper arms is $40.6~\mathrm{{cm}}$ (16 inches). In hole s with a diameter greater than this maximum, the pad contact at th e end of the caliper arms will be inconsistent, and the FMS image s may appear out of focus and too conductive. Irregular (rough) borehole walls will also adversely affect the images if contact with th e wall is poor.  

# Acceleration and inclinometry  

Three-component acceleration and magnetic field measurements were made with the GPIT. The primary purpose of this tool, which incorporates a three-component accelerometer and a threecomponent magnetometer, is to determine the acceleration and orientation of the FMS-sonic tool string during logging. This information allows the FMS images to be corrected for irregular tool motion and the dip and direction (azimuth) of features in the images to be determined. The GPIT is run with other tools on th e FMS-sonic tool string that can carry remanent or induced magnetization; therefore, its magnetic measurements can be affected by th e other tools, the rocks and/or sediment in the borehole wall, an d magnetization of the casing and/or drill pipe. On the FMS-soni c tool string, however, the GPIT has greater nonmagnetic insulatio n from the other tools, which greatly reduces the effects on its magnetic measurements.  

# Log data quality  

The main influence on log data quality is the condition of th e borehole wall. Where the borehole diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts (wide borehole) of softer material o r ledges of harder material, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehole wall (i.e., FMS, density, and porosity) may b e degraded. Deep investigation measurements, such as NGR, resistivity, and sonic velocity, which do not require contact with the borehole wall, are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions. “Bridged” sections, where borehole diameter is much lower than th e bit size, will also cause irregular log results. The quality of the borehole is improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling flui d while drilling, flushing the borehole to remove debris, and loggin g the borehole as soon as possible after drilling and conditioning ar e completed.  

The quality of the wireline depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determine d from the length of the cable payed out from the winch on the ship. The seafloor is identified on the NGR log by the abrupt reduction i n gamma ray count at the water/sediment interface (mudline). Discrepancies between the drilling depth and the wireline log dept h may occur. In the case of drilling depth, discrepancies are caused b y core expansion, incomplete core recovery, or incomplete heav e compensation. In the case of log depth, discrepancies between successive runs occur because of incomplete heave compensation, incomplete correction for cable stretch, and cable slip. Tidal change s in sea level and unaccounted-for changes in trim of the drillship affect both drilling and logging depths.  

# Logging data flow and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real tim e and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. Initia l logging data were referenced to the rig floor (WRF). After loggin g was completed, data were shifted to a seafloor reference (WSF ) based on the step in logged gamma radiation at the sediment/wate r interface.  

Data were transferred to LDEO, where standardized data processing took place. A main part of this was depth matching to remove depth offsets between logs from different logging runs. Thi s resulted in a new depth scale: wireline log matched depth belo w seafloor (WMSF). Also, corrections were made to certain tools an d logs (e.g., FMS imagery was corrected for tool acceleration, including “stick and slip” motion), documentation for the logs (with assessment of log quality) was prepared, and data were converted t o ASCII for conventional logs and to GIF for FMS images. Schlumberger Geo-Quest’s GeoFrame software was used for most of th e processing of the collected wireline logging data. The data wer e transferred back to the ship within a few days after logging, and th e processed data sets were made available to the science party.
