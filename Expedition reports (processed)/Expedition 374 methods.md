# Introduction  

This chapter documents the procedures and methods employed during drilling operations and in the shipboard laboratories on the R/V JOIDES Resolution during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 374. This information applies only to the shipboard work described in the Expedition Reports section of the Expedition 374 Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of Expedition 374 data and samples will be described in separate individual publications. This introductory section provides an overview of drilling and coring operations, core handling, curatorial conventions, depth scale terminology, and the sequence of shipboard analyses. Subsequent sections of this chapter describe specific laboratory procedures and instruments in more detail.  

The nomenclature of many geographic features on the Antarctic continent is aligned to the geographic coordinate system (e.g., the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets), in which $0^{\circ}$ of longitude represents grid north on a universal polar stereographic projection. However, in the Ross Sea, true direction is generally opposite to the geographic coordinates: the eastern Ross Sea is the area located between $160^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ and $180^{\circ}$ longitude (see Figure F2 in the Expedition 374 summary chapter [McKay et al., $2019\mathbf{a}]$ ), and the western Ross Sea is the area between $160^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ and $180^{\circ}$ of longitude (see Figure F2 in the Expedition 374 summary [McKay et al., 2019a]). In this volume, descriptors of directional orientation (e.g., west versus east) are based on true directions within the Ross Sea and not the geographical coordinate system.  

# Site locations  

GPS coordinates from precruise site surveys were used to position the vessel at all Expedition 374 sites. A SyQuest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloor depth on the approach to each site to reconfirm the depth profiles from precruise surveys. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters were lowered and a positioning beacon was dropped to the seafloor at most sites. The dynamic positioning control of the vessel used navigational input from the GPS system and triangulation to the seafloor beacon weighted by the estimated positional accuracy. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over a portion of the time the hole was occupied. When coring multiple holes at a site, the hole locations are typically offset from each other by ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ in a grid pattern. The second  

hole is offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of the first hole, the third hole is offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south of the second hole, the fourth hole is offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west of the third hole, and so on.  

# Coring and drilling operations  

All four standard coring systems, the advanced piston corer (APC), the half-length APC (HLAPC), the extended core barrel (XCB), and the rotary core barrel (RCB), were used during Expedition 374. We employed several different coring strategies during the expedition. For continental shelf Sites U1521 and U1522, we cored a single RCB hole to total depth. RCB coring was necessary on the continental shelf because of the presence of overconsolidated glaciomarine and subglacial diamictite, as well as large cobbles and boulders in surficial sediment. Although coring unconsolidated diamict is difficult and resulted in poor recovery, coring lithified glacia l sediment with an indurated mud matrix resulted in much bette r core recovery. At Site U1523, located on the outermost continenta l shelf, we employed a different strategy that included piston corin g with both the APC and HLAPC systems and using the XCB syste m to penetrate more indurated layers and unconsolidated gravel. B y coring multiple holes at this site, we were able to use coring result s from previous holes and drilling parameters (e.g., weight on bit an d rate of penetration) to determine the location of unconsolidate d gravel or indurated layers and then collect targeted HLAPC core s between these layers. In addition, we cored a single RCB hole primarily for downhole logging. At continental rise and slope Site s U1524 and U1525, our coring strategy consisted of APC coring t o refusal followed by HLAPC coring to refusal and then deepenin g the hole with the XCB system. This strategy worked well at Sit e U1524; however, at Site U1525, an indurated layer at ${\sim}50$ meter s drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) resulted in HLAPC refusal at  a very shallow depth. Based on our experience at Site U1523, we employed the XCB system to core through the hard layer and then resumed APC/HLAPC coring to refusal followed by additional XC B coring. At Site U1524, we also used the RCB system to core a dee p hole.  

# JOIDES Resolution standard coring systems  

The APC and HLAPC coring systems cut soft-sediment core s with minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems. These coring systems are typically used in the upper portion s of a hole where sediment is unconsolidated to obtain high-qualit y core. After the APC core barrel is lowered through the drill pipe an d lands near the bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until the two shea r pins holding the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. Th e inner barrel then advances into the formation and cuts a core with  a diameter of $66~\mathrm{mm}$ (Figure F1). The driller can detect a successfu l cut, or “full stroke,” from the pressure gauge on the rig floor.  

The depth limit of the APC, referred to as APC refusal, is conventionally defined in two ways: (1) the piston fails to achieve  a complete stroke (as determined from the pump pressure reading ) because the formation is too hard or (2) excessive force $^{\prime}{>}60{,}000$ lb; ${\sim}267~\mathrm{kN})$ is required to pull the core barrel out of the formation. When a full stroke cannot be achieved, additional attempts are typically made. With a partial stroke, the assumption is that the cor e barrel penetrated the formation by the length of core recovere d (nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ ), and the bit is advanced by that lengt h before cutting the next core. The number of additional attempts i s generally dictated by the length of recovery of the partial stroke cor e and the time available to advance the hole by piston coring. When  a full or partial stroke is achieved but excessive force cannot retriev e the barrel, the core barrel is “drilled over,” meaning after the inne r core barrel is successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit is advanced to free the APC barrel.  

The standard (full) APC system contains a $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, whereas the HLAPC system uses a $4.8\textrm{m}$ core barrel. In mos t cases, the HLAPC system is deployed after the standard APC system reaches refusal. While using the HLAPC system, we applied th e same criteria for refusal as with the standard APC system. Thi s technology allowed for deeper continuous piston coring than woul d have been possible with the standard APC system. We also used th e HLAPC system at Site U1523 to target piston cores between indurated layers and gravel beds that could not have been cored with th e standard APC system.

Figure F1. APC system used during Expedition 374. ID $=$ inner diameter.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used during all APC an d HLAPC coring to a pull force of ${\sim}40\mathrm{,}000\;\mathrm{lb}$ . In addition, most fulllength APC cores recovered at Sites U1523–U1525 were oriente d using the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool (see Paleomagnetism) . We also used the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3 ) to obtain in situ formation temperatures at Site U1524 to determin e the geothermal gradient and estimate heat flow (see Downhol e measurements).  

The XCB system was used to advance the hole when APC o r HLAPC refusal occurred before the target depth was reached o r when the formation became either too stiff for APC coring or har d substrate was encountered. The XCB is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe that extends below the large rotary APC/XCB bit. Th e smaller bit can cut a semi-indurated core with less torque and flui d circulation than the main bit, optimizing recovery. The XCB cuttin g shoe (bit) extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediment s but retracts into the main bit when hard formations are encountered (Figure F2). XCB cores have a nominal diameter of $58~\mathrm{mm}$ , which is less than the diameter of APC/HLAPC cores $66\ \mathrm{mm}$ . Steel core barrels are used for all XCB coring. XCB cores are ofte n broken into “biscuits,” which are pieces of core that are a few to several centimeters in length with fluidized sediment and drillin g slurry injected between them. This slurry can also fill the spaces between the cut core and the core liner, giving the impression tha t XCB cores have the same diameter as APC cores. Because the AP C and XCB systems use the same bottom-hole assembly (BHA), it i s possible to switch between them without having to trip the drill bi t back to the vessel.

Figure F2. XCB system used during Expedition 374.  

The BHA is the lowermost part of the drill string. A typica l APC/XCB BHA consists of a drill bit (outer diameter $=11\,\%$ inch), a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified to p sub, a modified head sub, a nonmagnetic drill collar, a number of $8\%$ inch $\left\langle{\sim}20.32\ \mathrm{cm}\right\rangle$ drill collars, a tapered drill collar, six joints (tw o stands) of $5\%$ inch $({\sim}13.97~\mathrm{cm})$ drill pipe, and one crossover sub.  A lockable float valve was used in Hole U1523A so that downhole log s could be collected through the bit, but that hole was abandoned before logging took place. In some cases, the drill string was drilled o r “washed” ahead without recovering sediment to advance the dril l bit to a target depth and resume core recovery. Such intervals wer e typically drilled using a center bit installed on an XCB core barre l that was then latched into the APC/XCB bit.  

The RCB system is typically used to core holes deeper than XC B refusal or to core hard rock. During Expedition 374, we used th e RCB system to core continental shelf Sites U1521 and U1522 because of the presence of overconsolidated diamictite and large boulders. The RCB system was also deployed at Sites U1523 and U152 4 to core deeper holes for downhole logging. The RCB system is th e most conventional rotary coring system, and like the XCB system, i t cuts a core with a nominal diameter of $58~\mathrm{mm}$ (Figure F3). Unlik e the XCB system, nonmagnetic core barrels can be used with th e RCB coring system. The RCB system requires a dedicated RC B BHA and a dedicated RCB drilling bit. A typical RCB BHA include s a $9\%$ inch RCB drill bit, a mechanical bit release (to drop the bi t prior to downhole logging), a modified head sub, an outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, 7–10 control-lengt h drill collars, a tapered drill collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe, and a crossover sub to the 5 inch drill pipe. Most intervals core d with the RCB system were ${\sim}9.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long, which is the length of  a standard rotary core and approximately the length of a joint of drill pipe. In some cases, half cores $\left(\sim\!4.8\mathrm{~m}\right)$ were cut to improve cor e recovery when hard rocks (such as ice-rafted debris) clogged th e drill bit throat. In some cases, the drill string was drilled o r “washed” ahead with a center bit installed to advance the drill bi t without coring to a target depth to resume core recovery.

# Core disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed by the drilling process an d contain extraneous material as a result of the coring and core handling processes. In formations with loose sand or gravel layers, san d and gravel from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down b y drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom of the hole, and b e sampled with the next core. The uppermost $10{-}50\;\mathrm{cm}$ of each cor e must therefore be examined critically during description for potential fall-in. Common coring-induced deformation includes the concave appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Piston action ma y result in fluidization (flow-in) at the bottom of or within APC an d HLAPC cores. Retrieval of cores containing unconsolidated sediment from depth to the surface may result in elastic rebound. Ga s that is in solution at depth may become free and drive core segments in the liner apart. Both elastic rebound and gas pressure ca n result in a total length for each core that is longer than the interva l that was cored and thus a calculated recovery of ${>}100\%$ . If gas expansion or other coring disturbance results in a void in any particular core section, the void can be closed by moving material if ver y large, stabilized by a foam insert if moderately large, or left as is. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. Holes are drilled int o the liner, which forces out some sediment, as well as gas. In extrem e instances, core material can be ejected from the core barrel, sometimes violently, onto the rig floor by high pressure in the core o r other coring problems. This core material is placed in the plasti c core liners by hand and should not be considered to be in stratigraphic order; these core sections are denoted by a yellow labe l marked “disturbed,” and the nature of the disturbance is noted in th e coring log. In more consolidated material, common coring disturbances include biscuiting, where fractured material (biscuits) rotates within the core barrel. Drilling slurry is often injected betwee n the biscuits. This type of disturbance is particularly common wit h XCB coring but can also be seen in RCB cores. Fracturing, fragmentation, and brecciation as a result of the drilling process is commo n in indurated sediment and rock. Finally, some core liners can b e broken or shattered, resulting in significant disturbance when extracted from the core barrel. This was particularly common wit h XCB coring during Expedition 374; 14 out of $22\ X C B$ core liner s shattered $(64\%)$ . In some cases, broken liners could be patched; however, in many instances, material in shattered liners was place d by hand into new liners and should not be considered to be in stratigraphic order. These core sections were also indicated by a yello w label marked “disturbed.”  

These disturbances are described in the Lithostratigraphy section in each site chapter and are graphically indicated on the cor e summary graphic reports (visual core descriptions [VCDs]).  

# Curatorial procedures and core handling  

Cores recovered during Expedition 374 were extracted from th e core barrel in $67~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter plastic liners. These liners were carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwal k outside the Core Laboratory, where they were split into ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections. Liner caps (blue $=$ top; colorless $=$ bottom; yellow $=$ wholeround sample taken) were glued with acetone onto liner sections o n the catwalk by the Marine Technicians. The length of each sectio n was entered into the database as “created length” using the Sampl e Master application. This number was used to calculate core recovery.  

# Sample naming and identifiers  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples follows standar d IODP procedure (Figure F4). Drilling sites are numbered consecutively from the first site drilled by the D/V Glomar Challenger i n 1968. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 301 began using the prefix “U” to designate sites occupied by the United State s  

![](images/ddfd0a2affb4b86933ada94d5915f471b34164cdcea6162085947a5b6d085667.jpg)  
Figure F4. IODP conventions for naming sites, holes, cores, and samples.  

Implementing Organization (USIO) platform, the JOIDES Resolution. For all IODP drill sites, a letter suffix distinguishes each hol e drilled at the same site. The first hole drilled is assigned the sit e number modified by the suffix “A,” the second hole is assigned th e site number and the suffix “B,” and so on.  

Cores taken from a hole are numbered sequentially from the to p of the hole downward. When an interval is drilled down withou t coring, this interval is also numbered sequentially, and the drill down is designated by a $^{\ast}1^{\prime\prime}$ instead of a letter that designates th e coring method used (e.g., 374-U1523B-21). Cores taken with th e APC system are designated with $\ ^{\ast}\mathrm{H},^{\dprime}$ “F” designates HLAPC cores, ${}^{\ast}\mathrm{X}^{\prime\prime}$ designates XCB cores, and ${}^{\ast}\mathbf{R}^{\ast}$ designates RCB cores. Cor e numbers and their associated cored intervals are unique in a give n hole. Generally, maximum recovery for a single core is $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment (APC) or $9.7\textrm{m}$ of sediment/rock (XCB and RCB) containe d in a plastic liner ( $.6.6\;\mathrm{cm}$ internal diameter) plus an additional $\mathord{\sim}0.2$ m in the core catcher, which is a device at the bottom of the cor e barrel that prevents the core from sliding out when the barrel is retrieved from the hole. In certain situations, recovery may exceed th e 9.5 or $9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ maximum. In soft sediment, this is normally caused b y core expansion resulting from depressurization. High heave, tidal changes, and overdrilling can also result in an advance that differ s from the planned 9.5 or $9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Recovered cores are divided into ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections that are numbered serially from the top downward. When full recovery is obtained, the sections are numbered 1–7, and the last section i s usually $_{<1.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ . Rarely, an unusually long core may require mor e than seven sections. When the recovered core is shorter than th e cored interval, by convention the top of the core is deemed to b e located at the top of the cored interval for the purpose of calculatin g (consistent) depths. In sedimentary cores, the core catcher sectio n is treated as a separate section $(^{\iota}\mathrm{CC}^{\upsilon})$ . When the only recovere d material is in the core catcher, it is placed at the top of the core d interval.  

A full curatorial sample identifier consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, and interval in centimeters measured from the top of the cor e section. For example, a sample identification of “374-U1524A-2H-5, $80{-}85~\mathrm{cm},^{\prime\prime}$ represents a sample taken from the interval between 8 0 and $85\;\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 5 of Core 2 (collected using th e APC system) of Hole A of Site U1524 during Expedition 374 (Figur e F4).  

# Depth scales  

Primary depth scale types are based on the measurement of dril l string length deployed beneath the rig floor (drilling depth belo w rig floor [DRF]) or seafloor (DSF), the length of core recovered (cor e depth below seafloor [CSF]), and the length of the logging wirelin e deployed (wireline log depth below rig floor [WRF], wireline lo g depth below seafloor [WSF], and wireline log matched depth belo w seafloor [WMSF]). All depths are in meters. The relationship between scales is defined either by protocol, such as the rules for computation of CSF from DSF, or by combinations of protocols wit h user-defined correlations. The distinction in nomenclature shoul d keep the user aware that a nominal depth value at two differen t depth scales usually does not refer to exactly the same stratigraphi c interval. For more information on depth scales, see “IODP Dept h Scales Terminology” at http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF scale). The depth of the cored interval is referenced to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth at the time of th e first core from the DRF depth of the interval. Seafloor depth wa s calculated in several different ways during Expedition 374. For Site s U1521 and U1522, the seafloor depth was based on tagging the seafloor with the drill string when starting the hole. At Site U1523, w e deployed the subsea camera for a seafloor survey and visually observed the seafloor tag to determine seafloor depth. For Sites U152 4 and U1525, the seafloor depth is the length of pipe deployed minu s the length of the mudline core recovered.  

Standard depths of cores on the CSF, Method A (CSF-A), scal e are determined based on the assumptions that (1) the top depth of  a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of its cored interva l (DSF scale) and (2) the recovered material is a contiguous sectio n even if core segments are separated by voids when recovered. If possible, voids in the core are closed by pushing core segments togethe r during core handling. This convention is also applied if a core ha s incomplete recovery, in which case the true position of the cor e within the cored interval is unknown and should be considered  a sample depth uncertainty up to the length of the core barrel use d when analyzing data associated with the core material. Standar d depths of subsamples and associated measurements (CSF-A scale ) are calculated by adding the offset of the subsample or measurement from the top of its section and the lengths of all higher sections in the core to the top depth of the cored interval.  

A soft-sediment core from less than a few hundred meters below seafloor expands upon recovery (typically a few percent to a s much as $15\%$ ), so the length of the recovered core can exceed tha t of the cored interval. Therefore, a stratigraphic interval may no t have the same nominal depth at the DSF and CSF-A scales in th e same hole. When core recovery (the ratio of recovered core t o cored interval) is ${>}100\%$ , the CSF-A depth of a sample taken fro m the bottom of a core will be deeper than that of a sample from th e top of the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated with the tw o core intervals overlap on the CSF-A scale). The core depth belo w seafloor, Method B (CSF-B), depth scale is a solution to the overla p problem. This method scales the recovered core length back int o the interval cored, from ${>}100\%$ to exactly $100\%$ recovery. If core s have ${<}100\%$ recovery to begin with, they are not scaled. Whe n downloading data using the JOIDES Resolution Science Operato r (JRSO)  Laboratory  Information  Management  System  (LIMS ) (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/LORE/), depths for samples and measurements are presented on both the CSF-A and CSF-B scales b y default. The CSF-B depth scale is primarily useful for data analysi s and presentations in single-hole situations.  

Wireline logging data are collected on the WRF scale, fro m which a seafloor measurement is subtracted to create a WSF scale. WSF depths were only used for preliminary data usage on the ship. Immediately after data collection was completed, the wireline logging data were transferred to the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) Borehole Research Group, where multiple passes an d runs were depth-matched using the natural gamma radiatio n (NGR) logs. The data were returned to the ship on the WMSF scale, which is the final logging depth scale type for investigators.  

# Shipboard core analysis  

For sedimentary sections, as soon as cores arrived on deck , headspace samples were taken using a syringe or pieces of sedimen t were chipped off (for indurated samples) for immediate hydrocarbon analysis as part of the shipboard safety and pollution prevention program. Core catcher samples were taken for biostratigraphi c analysis. Whole-round samples were taken from some core section s for shipboard and postcruise interstitial water analyses and shorebased microbiological studies.  

After being cut on the catwalk, cores were brought into the cor e laboratory and placed on racks. After ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{h}$ of equilibration to laboratory temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , whole-round core sections were ru n through the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL; measuring $P_{-}$ -wave velocity, gamma ray attenuation [GRA] bulk density, an d magnetic susceptibility) and the Natural Gamma Radiation Logge r (NGRL). Thermal conductivity measurements were typically take n at a rate of one per core (see Physical properties) for soft-sedimen t cores. The core sections were then split lengthwise from bottom t o top into working and archive halves. Soft-sediment cores were spli t using a piano wire, whereas indurated cores were split with a sa w blade. Investigators should note that older material may have bee n transported upward on the split face of each core section durin g splitting.  

The working half of each sediment core was sampled fo r shipboard analyses (biostratigraphy, physical properties, paleomagnetism, X-ray diffraction [XRD], and bulk sediment geochemical parameters). The archive halves of all cores were scanned o n the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) with a line scan camera a t 20 pixels/mm and measured for color reflectance and point magnetic  susceptibility  on  the  Section  Half  Multisensor  Logge r (SHMSL). At the same time, the archive halves were described visually and by means of smear slides and thin sections. In som e cases, sedimentary description was aided by XRD analyses an d handheld portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyses. All observations were recorded in the LIMS database using the DESClogi k descriptive data capture application. After visual description, th e archive halves were run through the cryogenic magnetometer. Finally, digital color close-up images were taken of particular feature s of the archive or working halves, as requested by individual scientists. Records of all samples taken are kept by the IODP curator. Sampling for personal postcruise research was deferred until  a postcruise sampling meeting; however, shipboard residues wer e made available for scientists to request for postcruise analyses t o guide personal sampling during the sampling meeting.  

In preparation for storage, soft-sediment section-half cores wer e wrapped in plastic wrap. After wrapping, both halves of the cor e were put into labeled plastic tubes that were sealed and transferre d to cold storage space aboard the ship. At the end of the expedition, the cores were transported from the ship to cold storage at the Gul f Coast Repository (GCR) at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas (USA). Shore-based sampling of the cores for postcruis e research took place while the cores were stored at the GCR. Th e GCR houses cores collected from the Pacific Ocean, Souther n Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico.

# Lithostratigraphy  

Sediments and rocks recovered during Expedition 374 were described macroscopically from archive-half sections and microscopically  from  smear  slides  and  thin  sections.  In  some  cases, sedimentary description was aided by XRD and pXRF analyses. Observations were recorded in separate macroscopic and microscopic DESClogik templates (version x.16.1.0.19; see the DESClogi k user guide at http://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation). Colo r spectrophotometry and point source magnetic susceptibility dat a acquired by the lithostratigraphy group during core description ar e described in detail in Physical properties. Descriptive data wer e uploaded to the LIMS database and were used to produce VC D standard graphic reports.  

# Core preparation  

The technique used for splitting cores into working and archiv e halves (using either a piano wire or a saw and splitting from the bottom to the top; see Curatorial procedures and core handling) affects  the  appearance  of  the  split-core  surface.  Prior  to  cor e description and high-resolution digital color imaging, the quality o f the split-core surface of the archive half of each core was assessed, and when necessary (e.g., the surface was irregular or smeared), th e split-core surface was scraped lightly with a glass microscope slid e or stainless steel plate. Cleaned sections were then imaged on th e SHIL, measured on the SHMSL (see Physical properties), and described visually.  

# Section-half images  

After cleaning the core surface, the archive half was imaged wit h the SHIL as soon as possible to avoid sediment color change s caused by oxidation and drying. In cases of watery or soupy sediment, the surface was dried sufficiently to avoid light reflectio n prior to scanning. The SHIL uses three pairs of advanced illumination, high-current focused LED line lights to illuminate the feature s of the core. Each of the LED pairs has a color temperature of $6{,}500\,\mathrm{K}$ and emits 200,000 lux at 3 inches. Digital images were taken by a JA I line-scan camera at an interval of 10 lines/mm to create a high-resolution TIFF file. The camera height was set so that each pixel imaged a $0.1\,\;\mathrm{mm^{2}}$ section of the core surface; however, actual cor e width per pixel can vary because of slight differences in the sectionhalf surface height. A high-resolution JPEG with grayscale and  a depth ruler and a low-resolution cropped JPEG showing only th e core section surface were created from the high-resolution TIF F files.  

# Visual core description  

Macroscopic descriptions of each section (nominally $0{-}150~\mathrm{cm}$ long) were recorded manually on core description (barrel) sheets. All handwritten sheets were digitally preserved as PDF files and ar e included in HANDBARREL in Supplementary material. Standar d sedimentological observations of lithology, contacts/boundaries, primary and secondary (e.g., syn- and postsedimentary deformation) sedimentary structures, color (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2010), bioturbation, and lithologic accessories were recorded wit h notes made on specific features. The Lithologic accessories colum n includes documentation of macroscopic biogenic remains (e.g., shells, worm tubes, bryozoa, mud clasts, and isolated lithic clasts $_{>1}$ cm). When possible, clast lithology was noted. Consideration o f physical property data (including whole-round core measurement s of magnetic susceptibility, color reflectance, and NGR and splitcore point magnetic susceptibility; see Physical properties) supported the identification and interpretation of distinct sedimentar y features or intervals within the cores (e.g., reduced magnetic susceptibility and lower density often indicate the occurrence of diatom ooze/diatomite).  

# DESClogik data capture software  

Data from core description sheets were compiled and entere d into the LIMS database using the DESClogik software. A macroscopic spreadsheet template with five tabs was constructed and customized for Expedition 374:  

• Drilling disturbance (type and intensity),   
• General (major lithology, sedimentary structures, color, bioturbation intensity, clast abundance, diagenetic constituents/composition, biogenic material, lithologic accessories, etc.),   
• Clasts (number of clasts),   
• Core summary (written description of major lithologic findings by core), and   
• Hole summary (lithostratigraphic unit and age).  

A microscopic template with two tabs to capture texture and relative abundance of biogenic/mineralogic components was configured and used to record smear slide and thin section data, respectively. Data entered into DESClogik were then uploaded t o the LIMS database and used to produce VCD standard graphical reports.  

# Standard graphical report  

A one-page VCD of each core was generated using the Strater software package (Golden Software) (Figure F5). Hole, core, and interval are included at the top of each VCD, along with a summary core description. VCDs display the core depth below seafloor (m CSF-A), core length (in centimeters), sections, lithostratigraphic unit, location of shipboard samples, age, and SHIL digital color image to the left of the Graphic lithology column. Columns to the right of graphic lithology include type and intensity of drilling disturbance, bioturbation intensity, sedimentary structures, lithologic accessories (e.g., biogenic material, clasts, and diagenetic constituents), clast abundance (when appropriate for a given site), and physical property data (magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, and NGR) collected by the WRMSL and SHMSL (see Physical properties) (Figure F5). Graphic lithologies, sedimentary structures, and other visual observations shown on the VCDs by graphic patterns and symbols are explained in Figure F6.  

# Lithologic classification scheme  

Lithologic descriptions were based on the classification schemes used during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 178 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999), the Cape Roberts Project (Hambrey et al., 1997), the Antarctic Geological Drilling Project (ANDRILL; Naish et al., 2006), and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 318 (Expedition 318 Scientists, 2011) and 341 (Jaeger et al., 2014).  

# Principal names and modifiers  

The principal lithologic name was assigned based on the relative abundances of siliciclastic and biogenic grains (Figure F7). We note that it can be difficult to identify clast relative abundance based on visual description alone and that postcruise computed tomography (CT) scan and grain size analysis results may refine primary lithologies and clast abundance. The principal name is purely descriptive and does not include interpretive classifications relating to fragmentation, transport, deposition, or alteration processes. For each

Moderately bioturbated dark gray lightly to interbedded diatom-bearing clast-poor sandy diamictite with diatom-bearing mudstone. Pyrite filled burrows, tilted parallel mudstone laminae, shell fragments, and basalt clasts are present throughout. Section 4 contains an interbedded sequence of clast-poor sandy diamictite overlain by bioturbated mudstone, diamictite, sandstone, and clast-poor sandy diamictite. A sharp contact between bioturbated diatom-rich mudstone and diamictite occurs at $17\,\mathsf{c m}$ in Section 1.

principal name, both a consolidated (i.e., semilithified to lithified ) and a nonconsolidated term exist and are mutually exclusive.  

The principal name of a sediment/rock with ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ siliciclasti c grains is based on an estimate of the grain sizes present (Figur e F7A). The Wentworth (1922) scale was used to define size classes o f clay, silt, sand, and gravel. If the sediment cannot be easily deforme d with a finger, the suffix “-stone” is added to the grain size identifie r (e.g., sandstone).  

If no gravel is present, the principal sediment/rock name wa s determined based on the relative abundances of sand, silt, and cla y (e.g., silt, sandy silt, silty sand, etc.; Naish et al., 2006, after Mazzull o et al., 1988, and Shepard, 1954; Figure F7B). For example, if any on e of these components exceeds $80\%$ , the lithology is defined by th e primary grain size class (e.g., sand[stone]). The term “mud(stone) ” is used to define sediments containing a mixture of silt and cla y (these are difficult to separate using visual macroscopic inspection ) in which neither component exceeds $80\%$ . Sandy mud(stone) t o muddy sand(stone) describes sediment composed of a mixture of a t least $20\%$ each of sand, silt, and clay (Figure F7B). The prefix wa s determined by the percentage $>\!20\%$ of sand versus mud in the matrix (Figure F7B).  

If the sediment/rock contains siliciclastic gravel, then the principal name was determined from the relative abundance of gravel $^{(>2}$ mm) and sand/mud ratio of the clastic matrix, following the textural classifications of Moncrieff (1989), with gravel percent estimate d using the comparison chart of Terry and Chilingar (1955) (Figur e F8). The term “diamict” is used as a nongenetic term for unsorted t o poorly sorted terrigenous sediment that contains a wide range o f particle sizes. Accordingly, a clast-poor muddy diamict include s $1\%{-5\%}$ gravel $\left(>2\mathrm{\mm}\right)$ and $25\%{-}50\%$ sand in matrix, whereas  a clast-rich muddy diamict includes $5\%{-}30\%$ gravel and $25\%{-}50\%$ sand in matrix. A clast-poor sandy diamict has $1\%{-}5\%$ gravel an d $50\%-75\%$ sand in matrix. For a clast-rich sandy diamict, gravel content is $5\%{-}30\%$ , sand content is $50-75\%$ , and the remainder is mud. The term “conglomerate” is used when the matrix includes ${>}30\%$ gravel (Figure F8).  

The principal name of nonlithified sediment with ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ biogeni c grains is “ooze,” modified by the most abundant specific biogeni c grain type (Figure F9). For example, if diatoms exceed $50\%$ , then th e sediment is called “diatom ooze.” However, if the sediment is composed of $40\%$ diatoms and $15\%$ sponge spicules, then the sediment i s termed “biosiliceous ooze.” The same principle applies to calcareou s

microfossils. For example, if foraminifers exceed $50\%$ , then the sediment is called a “foraminifer ooze,” whereas a mixture of $40\%$ foraminifers and $15\%$ calcareous nannofossils is termed a “calcareou s ooze.” “Diatomite” is used for indurated diatom ooze. The ter m “chert” is used to describe biosiliceous rocks recovered from belo w the opal-CT transition, where the main biogenic component is no t identifiable.  

For all lithologies, major and minor modifiers were applied t o the principal sediment/rock names following a modified scheme o f Expedition 318 (Expedition 318 Scientists, 2011) (Figure F9):  

• Major biogenic modifiers are those components that comprise $25\%{-}50\%$ of the grains and are indicated by the suffix “-rich” (e.g., diatom-rich).   
• Minor biogenic modifiers are those components with abundances of $10\%{-}25\%$ and are indicated by the suffix “-bearing” (e.g., diatom-bearing).   
• Siliciclastic modifiers in biogenic oozes are those components with abundances of $10\%{-}50\%$ and are indicated by the suffix “-y” (e.g., silty, muddy, or sandy).  

# Lithostratigraphic units  

At each site, units were assigned to highlight major lithologi c changes downhole. Units were established where a prominen t change in sediment lithology matched changes in other sedimen t characteristics (e.g., color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility). Units are numbered from the top of the stratigraphic succession using Roman numerals. When more subtle significant changes wer e observed, units were divided into subunits. Subunits are distinguished from the main lithologic units by adding a letter to the uni t number (e.g., IA would indicate Unit I, Subunit A).  

# Sedimentary structures  

The locations and types of sedimentary structures visible on th e prepared surfaces of the archive-half sections were entered in th e Sedimentary structures column of the General tab in the macroscopic DESClogik template. Boundaries between different lithologies are classified as sharp, gradational, inclined, contorted, undulating/wavy, or chaotic. Bedding and lamination were define d by thickness following Mazzullo et al. (1988):  

• Thinly laminated $\leq3\:\mathrm{mm}$ ), • Laminated $3\,\mathrm{mm}$ to $1\,\mathrm{cm}$ ), • Very thinly bedded $(1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm})$ , • Thinly bedded $(3{-}10\,\mathrm{cm})$ ), • Medium bedded $(10{-}30\,\mathrm{cm})$ ), • Thickly bedded $(30{-}100\;\mathrm{cm})$ , and • Very thickly bedded $(>\!100\;\mathrm{cm})$ ).  

For units in which two lithologies are interbedded (individua l beds are ${<}15\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick and alternate between one lithology and another), the term “interbedded” is added before the lithology name s and the lithology is considered primary  (e.g., interbedded sand an d mud, interbedded silt and mud, and interbedded mud and diamict). This terminology is for ease of data entry and graphic log displa y purposes  for  VCDs  (Figure  F6).  When  beds  are  distribute d throughout a different lithology (e.g., centimeter- to decimeterthick sand beds within a mud bed), they are logged individually, an d the associated bed thickness and grain size ranges are described. The presence of graded beds is also noted. “Normal grading” corresponds to layers with an upward decrease in grain size, whereas “reverse grading” corresponds to layers with an upward increase i n grain size.  

Deformation of the core identified as unrelated to drilling is als o recorded in the Sedimentary structures column using the symbol s shown in Figure F6. Symbols include both synsedimentary deformation structures (e.g., flame structures), and postdepositional features (e.g., faults). When possible, direction of displacement (e.g., reverse or normal) is recorded in the comments section. Interval thickness is recorded from the uppermost to the lowermost exten t of the described feature, as well as in the comments column of th e core description sheet.  

Where sediments are diagenetically altered (e.g., mottling o r staining with manganese or pyrite, concretions, cement), the diagenetic constituent was entered in the Diagenetic constituent composition column of the General tab in the macroscopic DESClogi k template. We define mottles (millimeter to centimeter scale) a s spots or smears where material has a different color than the surrounding sediment.  

# Bioturbation  

Ichnofabric description included the extent of bioturbation an d notation of distinctive biogenic structures. To assess the degree o f bioturbation semiquantitatively, the Droser and Bottjer (1986) ichnofabric index (0–4), modified by Savrda et al. (2001), was use d (Figure F10):

Figure F9. Classification scheme for sediments that contain mixtures o f pelagic biogenic and siliciclastic components, Expedition 374.  

• $0=\mathtt{n o}$ apparent bioturbation $(\leq\!10\%)$ .   
• $1=$ slight bioturbation $(>\!10\%-30\%)$ .   
• $2=$ moderate bioturbation $(>\!30\%{-}60\%)$ .   
• $3=$ heavy bioturbation $(>\!60\%{-90\%})$ .   
• $4=$ complete bioturbation $(>\!90\%)$ ).  

We note that massive muds may be deposited rapidly in glacia l environments and record no evidence of bioturbation; they were assigned a value of 0. However, mud may also lack sedimentary structures due to complete bioturbation (e.g., 4 on the ichnofabric index), which may be accompanied by color mottling. This scenario is mor e likely for deeper water Sites U1523–U1525 than for shallower wate r continental shelf Sites U1521 and U1522. The ichnofabric index i s graphed using the numerical scale in the Bioturbation intensity column of the VCD. When identifiable, ichnofacies (Ekdale et al., 1984 ) were noted and logged in the General tab of the macroscopic DESClogik template.  

# Lithologic accessories  

Lithologic, paleontologic, and diagenetic features other tha n those delineated above were entered in the Lithologic accessorie s column and depicted as symbols in the VCDs (Figure F6). Accessories include macroscopic biogenic remains (e.g., shells, sponge spicules, and bryozoa) and clasts. When possible, clasts and concretion s were described by composition.  

# Clast abundance  

Clast abundance was determined on a site-specific basis b y counting the clasts visible on the surface of the archive half. Wher e only holes or depressions caused by lithic or diamict clasts were observed, the working half was also examined to estimate clast abundance. Clasts larger than $2~\mathrm{mm}$ were counted in $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals o f core. If between one and nine individual clasts were counted per 1 0 cm, the number of clasts per interval was entered into DESClogik. I f 10 or more clasts were present in a $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ interval, the number 1 0 was entered into DESClogik. In these intervals, the modifiers “wit h dispersed” ( $(\!\!\!\!-1\%\!\!\!)$ clasts; i.e., grains $>\!2\;\mathrm{mm}$ ), “clast-poor”/“with common” $(1\%-5\%$ gravel), and “clast-rich”/“with abundant” $(5\%{-}30\%$ gravel) were used to denote clast abundance following the Moncrieff (1989) classification (Figure F8). Details on lithology, size, shape, rounding, and surface texture (e.g., striae or faceted faces) ar e provided in the core description sheets and/or the General interval comments column in DESClogik. Clast counts were ambiguous fo r the unlithified sediment at Sites U1523 and U1524 and in Core s 374-U1525A-11F through 33X because clasts were sometime s pushed into the subsurface of the core during core splitting o r cleaning of the split-core surface; therefore, clast counts for thes e sites and cores were not recorded.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Core disturbance from the drilling process may alter the core s slightly (e.g., bent/bowed bedding contacts) or greatly (e.g., complete disruption of the stratigraphic sequence) (see Jutzeler et al., 2014, for examples). The style of drilling disturbance is describe d using the following terms:  

• Fall-in: out-of-place material at the top of a core has fallen downhole onto the cored surface.   
• Bowed: bedding contacts are slightly to moderately deformed but still subhorizontal and continuous.   
• Flowage: severe soft-sediment stretching and/or compressional shearing attributed to coring/drilling. The particular type of deformation may also be noted (e.g., flow-in).   
• Soupy: intervals are water saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
• Gas expansion: part of the core is partitioned into pieces and voids due to expansion of interstitial gas. The particular type of deformation may also be noted (e.g., mousse-like).   
• Biscuited: sediments of intermediate stiffness show vertical variations in the degree of disturbance. Softer intervals are washed and/or soupy, whereas firmer intervals are relatively undisturbed.   
• Fractured: firm sediments are broken but not displaced or significantly rotated (including cracks).   
• Fragmented: firm sediments are broken into pieces and rotated, and their stratigraphic position may not be preserved.   
• Brecciated: firm sediments are pervasively broken into small and angular pieces with original orientation and stratigraphic position lost, often completely mixed with drilling slurry.   
• Washed gravel: fine material was probably lost during drilling, with only washed coarse material, commonly pebbles or cobbles, remaining. Washed gravel often results when coring coarse-grained unconsolidated sediment (e.g., diamict).  

The intensity of drilling disturbance (e.g., slight, moderate, high, extreme, or destroyed) was also described in the Drilling disturbance tab of DESClogik and displayed graphically on the VCDs.  

Intensity of drilling disturbance of unconsolidated sediment s was classified into four categories:  

• Slightly disturbed: bedding contacts are slightly bent or bowed in a concave-downward appearance.   
• Moderately disturbed: bedding contacts are moderately bent or bowed in a concave-downward appearance but are still visible.   
• Highly disturbed: bedding contacts are bent or bowed in a concave-downward appearance but are still visible.   
• Extremely disturbed: bedding is completely deformed and may show diapiric or minor flow structures.  

Intensity of drilling disturbance of harder sediments (i.e., lithified by compaction or cementation) was classified into four categories:  

• Slightly fractured: core pieces are in place and have very little drilling slurry or brecciation.   
• Moderately fractured or biscuited: core pieces are from the cored interval and are probably in correct stratigraphic sequence (although the entire section may not be represented); intact core pieces are broken into rotated discs (or “biscuits”) as a result of the drilling process, and drilling mud has possibly flowed in.   
• Highly fractured or brecciated: pieces are from the cored interval and are probably in the correct stratigraphic sequence (although the entire section may not be represented), but the original orientation is still visible and drilling mud has flowed in.   
• Extremely fractured or brecciated: pieces are from the cored interval and are probably in the correct stratigraphic sequence (although the entire section may not be represented), but the original orientation is totally lost and drilling mud has flowed in.  

In addition to drilling-related artifacts, disturbance also occurred during core handling. If a core liner shattered during coring, the pieces were brought onto the catwalk and transferred to a ne w core liner for curation. This process may result in pieces of core being out of stratigraphic order or inverted relative to their origina l position. These cores should be considered extremely/highly disturbed. Additionally, the split-core surface of lithologies with relatively high porosity was occasionally disturbed because of exces s pressure applied by the point magnetic susceptibility instrument.

Microscopic descriptions  

# Smear slides  

To aid in lithologic classification, the size, composition, an d abundance of sediment constituents were estimated microscopically using smear slides (Figure F11). Toothpick samples were take n mostly from the primary lithologies, ideally at a frequency of at leas t one sample per core. For each smear slide, a small amount of sediment was removed from the section half using a wooden toothpic k and put on a $22\:\mathrm{mm}\times30\:\mathrm{mm}$ glass cover glass. A drop of deionize d water was added, and the sediment was homogenized and evenl y spread across the cover glass. The dispersed sample was dried on  a hot plate at a low setting $(50^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . A drop of Norland optical adhesiv e Number 61 was added to a glass microscope slide that was the n carefully placed on the dried sample to prevent air bubbles from being trapped in the adhesive. The smear slide was then placed in  a UV light box for 5 min to cure the adhesive.  

Smear slides were examined with a transmitted-light petrographic microscope equipped with a standard eyepiece micrometer.

Biogenic and mineral components were identified following standard petrographic techniques as stated in Rothwell (1989) and Marsaglia et al. (2013, 2015). Several fields of view were examined a t $100\times$ , $200\times$ , $400\times$ , and $500\times$ to assess the abundance of detrital, biogenic, and authigenic components. The relative abundance percentages of the sedimentary constituents were visually estimated usin g the techniques of Rothwell (1989). The texture of siliciclastic lithologies (e.g., relative abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains ) and the proportions and presence of biogenic and mineral components were recorded in the smear slide worksheet of the microscopic DESClogik template.  

Components observed in smear slides were categorized as follows:  

• $\mathrm{{TR}}=\mathrm{{}}$ trace $(\le\!1\%)$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(>\!1\%{-}10\%)$ .   
• $C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}25\%)$ ).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!25\%{-}50\%)$ .   
• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $(>\!50\%)$ ).  

Smear slides provide only a rough estimate of the relative abundance of sediment constituents. Occasionally, the lithologic nam e assigned based on smear slide observation does not match the nam e in the macroscopic lithology description because a small sampl e may not represent the macroscopic description of a much large r sediment interval. Additionally, very fine and coarse grains are difficult to observe in smear slides, and their relative proportions in th e sediment can be affected during slide preparation. Therefore, intervals dominated by sand and larger sized constituents were examined by macroscopic comparison to grain size reference charts. Photomicrographs of some smear slides were taken and uploaded t o the LIMS database.  

# Thin sections  

Description of indurated sediments and hard rocks were complemented with thin section analysis. Standard and large-sized thi n section billets were cut from selected intervals or features a s needed, and thin sections prepared on board were examined with  a transmitted-light petrographic microscope equipped with a standard eyepiece micrometer. Data were entered into the Thin sectio n tab of the DESClogik microscopic template.  

# Spectrophotometry and colorimetry  

The SHMSL employs multiple sensors to measure bulk physica l properties in a motorized and computer-controlled section-hal f logging instrument. The sensors included in the SHMSL are  a spectrophotometer, a point magnetic susceptibility sensor, and a laser surface analyzer. The resolution used for the SHMSL during Expedition 374 was $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ . Both the magnetic susceptibility senso r and the spectrophotometer require flush contact with the split-cor e surface, so the archive halves were covered with clear plastic wra p prior to measurement. A built-in laser surface analyzer aids in th e recognition of irregularities in the split-core surface (e.g., cracks an d voids), and data from this tool were recorded to provide an independent check on SHMSL measurement fidelity. Magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartington Instruments MS2 meter and  a MS2K contact probe. Instrument details are given in Physica l properties. Reflectance spectroscopy (spectrophotometry) wa s carried out using an Ocean Optics QE Pro detector, which measure s the reflectance spectra of the split core from the ultraviolet to nearinfrared range. Each measurement was recorded in $2~\mathrm{nm}$ spectra l bands from 390 to $732~\mathrm{nm}$ . The data were converted to the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color space system, which expresses color as a function of lightnes s $\mathrm{{[}}\%$ ; grayscale) and color values $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ , where $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ reflects the balance between red (positive $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ ) and green (negative $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ ) and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ reflects the balance between yellow (positive $\mathfrak{b}^{\ast}$ ) and blue (negativ e $\mathfrak{b}^{\ast}$ ).  

# X-ray fluorescence analysis  

An Olympus Vanta $^{\ast}\mathrm{M}^{\prime\prime}$ series pXRF was used on split-core sections to measure elemental composition with a $10{-}50~\mathrm{kV}$ (10–5 0 $\upmu\mathrm{A})$ Rh X-ray tube and a high–count rate detector. Measuremen t time was set at $_{30\,\mathrm{s}}$ . The instrument data-correction packages solv e a series of nonlinear equations for each analyzed element. The measurement strategy for each site was based on lithologic variability. As a general rule, 2–4 measurements per core were taken in conjunction with carbonate samples (see Geochemistry and microbiology). The “Geochem” and “Soil” methods were used to examin e the relative abundance of light and trace elements, respectively. Both methods were run for each measurement. pXRF measurements of standards were performed once per day to track instrument drift. In some cases, other analyses were coordinated with th e pXRF measurements. At Sites U1521–U1523, XRD (see below )  

samples were taken at the same location as pXRF measurements. A t Sites U1524 and U1525, pXRF measurements were not made because of instrument failure. The pXRF measurements acquired b y the lithostratigraphy group during core description are described i n detail in the Geochemistry and Microbiology sections in the sit e chapters.  

# XRD analysis  

Samples for XRD analysis were selected from the working-hal f sections, generally at the same depth as sampling for solid-phas e geochemistry and pXRF. In general, one $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sample was taken pe r representative lithology for Sites U1521–U1523. Additional sample s were occasionally taken and analyzed based on visual core observations (e.g., color variability, visual changes in lithology and texture, etc.) and smear slides. Prior to analysis, unlithified samples wer e freeze-dried or ground by hand, and lithified samples were groun d in an agate ball mill. Prepared samples were top-mounted onto  a sample holder and analyzed using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor X-ray diffractometer mounted with a Vantec-1 detector, using nickel-filtere d CuKα radiation. The standard locked coupled scan was as follows:  

• Voltage $=37\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
• Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
• Goniometer $\mathsf{i c a n}=4^{\circ}{-}70^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
• Step si $\mathbf{ze}=0.016599^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
• Scan speed $=1$ s/step.   
• Divergence slit $=0.3\;\mathrm{mm}$ .  

Shipboard results yielded only qualitative results of the presenc e and relative abundances of the most common mineralogical components.  

Bulk sample diffractograms were evaluated with the aid of th e EVA software package, which allowed for mineral identification an d basic peak characterization (e.g., baseline removal and maximu m peak intensity identification). Files contain d-spacing values, diffraction angles, and peak intensities with and without the background removed. These files were scanned by the EVA software t o find d-spacing values characteristic of a limited range of mineral s using aluminum oxide as an external standard (Expedition 317 Scientists, 2011). Muscovite/illite and kaolinite/chlorite have simila r diffraction patterns and were not distinguished on board. Digital files with the diffraction patterns are available from the LIMS database.  

# Biostratigraphy and paleontology  

Fossil marine diatoms, radiolarians, planktonic and benthic foraminifers,  organic-walled  dinoflagellate  cysts  (dinocysts),  an d calcareous nannofossils provided preliminary shipboard biostratigraphic  and  paleoenvironmental  information.  All  microfossi l groups aided in characterizing paleoenvironmental condition s such as proximity to glacial influence, changes in water masses, relative water depth, and sea ice presence or absence and in identifying intervals reflecting sedimentation from open-marine biogeni c productivity or intervals reflecting “glacial” influence with lo w microfossil abundance, poor preservation, fragmentation due t o pervasive reworking (e.g., a mixture of ages), and other preservational impacts from bottom currents or dissolution. Shipboard biostratigraphic  age  assignments  were  based  on  analysis  o f microfossils from all mudline and core catcher sediment samples, which were shared among the micropaleontology groups. Wher e necessary, additional toothpick (and/or plug) samples from splitcore sections were analyzed to refine biostratigraphic boundaries, examine critical intervals and distinct lithologies, or investigate th e material above and below significant changes in lithology. At site s where two or more holes recovered the same stratigraphic interval, all core catcher samples were examined from all holes.  

Biostratigraphic zonations for microfossil groups are presente d individually in the representative sections below and integrated int o Figure F12. Diatoms and radiolarians provided the most biostratigraphic control for all intervals cored during Expedition 374 (Miocene to recent; ${\sim}19$ to $_{0\,\mathrm{Ma}}$ ). Ages assigned to datum levels for thes e two groups were guided by the composite ordering of events an d model age output from constrained optimization (CONOP) analyses of Southern Hemisphere data sets (Cody et al., 2008), ANDRIL L Core AND-1B (Cody et al., 2012), and ODP Site 744 (Florindo et al., 2013). The CONOP analysis presented in Florindo et al. (2013) benefitted from the inclusion of radiolarian biostratigraphic data in th e Southern Ocean database managed by GNS Science (Wellington, New Zealand), which continues to add and integrate diatom, radiolarian, calcareous nannofossil, and foraminifer biostratigraphi c events toward a digital composite sequence for the Neogene an d late Paleogene. Elements of the diatom biostratigraphic zonation s for the Southern Ocean (Harwood and Maruyama, 1992; Censare k and Gersonde, 2002, among others) and Antarctic continental shel f (Olney et al., 2007; Winter et al., 2012) are integrated in Figure F12. The radiolarian biostratigraphic zones are a combination of th e middle Miocene to Pleistocene zonation defined and refined b y Lazarus (1990, 1992) and supplemented by the early to middle Miocene zonation developed by Abelmann (1992) (Figure F12). Biostratigraphic zones of austral temperate planktonic foraminifers ar e based on Jenkins (1993) with datum ages derived from the Ne w Zealand Geological Timescale and correlated with New Zealand Series and Stages from Crundwell et al. (2016). Correlation with th e tropical–subtropical zonation and the Gradstein et al. (2012) geomagnetic polarity timescale (GTS2012) (Wade et al., 2011) is provided  in  Figure  F12.  Neogene  dinocyst  biostratigraphy  i s developing, and tentative placement of biostratigraphic datums fo r selected Southern and Northern Hemisphere high latitudes an d Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes is taken from Bijl et al. (2015 ) (Figure F12). Calcareous nannofossils are rare in Neogene souther n high-latitude sections, with few biostratigraphic events. Consequently, the standard biostratigraphic zonations of Martini (1971 ) and Okada and Bukry (1980) are of limited usefulness. Instead, individual events correlated with the GTS2012 geomagnetic polarit y timescale were applied when possible. Biostratigraphic events an d zonal boundaries for these groups were compiled in reference to th e GTS2012 and are presented in Figure F12.  

Data for each microfossil group are presented in the form of taxonomic distribution charts that record occurrences by samples examined in each hole. Relative abundance and preservation dat a were entered through the DESClogik application into the LIMS da

tabase for all identified microfossil taxa and all paleontological dat a gathered during shipboard investigations. These data are availabl e from the LIMS database. Taxonomic occurrence charts also recor d suspected upsection reworking or otherwise out-of-place species. The first figure in the Biostratigraphy and paleontology section o f each site chapter presents a summary of biostratigraphical an d paleoenvironmental  information  provided  by  each  microfossi l group. An age-depth figure based on selected biostratigraphic datum levels identified in an accompanying table is also included, an d it identifies the location and approximate duration of unconformities.  

Distribution charts for microfossil groups presented in each sit e chapter are based on shipboard study only. Shipboard biostratigraphic studies focused primarily on identifying biostratigraphi c horizons (biohorizons) in the cores and are biased toward the reporting of age-diagnostic species and identifying intervals and age s of reworking. Reported events include the last appearance datu m (LAD) or first appearance datum (FAD) of a taxon’s stratigraphi c range, in some cases with modification to identify the last commo n occurrence or first common occurrence to in turn identify an abundance change within a taxon’s range if it is more reliable for correlation. Identification of a sequence of biohorizons in stratigraphi c order allowed recognition of biostratigraphic zones and subzone s using standard schemes. Tables in each site chapter present th e depth and age of important bioevents for use in constructing agedepth plots in which biostratigraphic information is integrated wit h the magnetic polarity stratigraphy, if available, to produce an ag e model for each site. These age models are based on preliminar y shipboard data and will be updated with postcruise research.  

# Diatoms  

# Diatom taxonomy  

Taxonomic concepts for Neogene Antarctic diatoms, many o f which are endemic to the southern high latitudes, have develope d largely through the last $45\ \mathrm{y}$ of stratigraphic drilling by Deep Se a Drilling Project (DSDP) and ODP in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic shelf (McCollum, 1975; Schrader, 1976; Gombos, 1976; Ciesielski, 1983; Gersonde and Burckle, 1990; Gersonde, 1990, 1991; Fenner, 1991; Baldauf and Barron, 1991; Harwood and Maruyama, 1992; Mahood and Barron, 1996; Gersonde and Barcena, 1998; Iwa i and Winter, 2002; Censarek and Gersonde, 2002; Zielinski and Gersonde, 2002; Arney et al., 2003; Bohaty et al., 2003; Whitehead an d Bohaty, 2003). In parallel to the above efforts, ice platform drillin g on the Antarctic margin recovered neritic diatom flora that serve a s useful taxonomic references on the Antarctic shelf (Harwood 1986, 1989; Winter and Harwood, 1997; Harwood et al., 1998; Bohaty e t al., 1998; Scherer et al., 2000; Olney et al., 2007, 2009; Winter et al., 2012; Sjunneskog et al., 2012). Other useful taxonomic reference s for Neogene and modern Antarctic marine diatoms include Fenne r et al. (1976), Akiba (1982), Harwood et al. (1989), Yanagisawa an d Akiba (1990), Medlin and Priddle (1990), Cremer et al. (2003), an d Scott and Thomas (2005).  

# Methods for diatom study  

Upon receipt of a core catcher sample, ${\sim}1~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of sediment wa s placed in a disposable $15~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube with a screw cap, an d the tube was filled to $\sim\!13\ \mathrm{mL}$ with deionized water. Sediment an d water in the centrifuge tube was mixed thoroughly with a pointe d metal spatula and shaken repeatedly to aid disaggregation. This suspension of “raw” sediment from the core catcher samples was use d as a “stock” suspension from which future preparation steps coul d be made. Slides made from this material represent an equivalent o f smear slides but allow for a more uniform and random distributio n of the sediment on the cover glass. Fossil marine diatoms were analyzed initially from strewn slides prepared by removing a rando m aliquot of suspended sediment from the thoroughly mixed stoc k suspension with a disposable pipette. One drop of suspended ra w sediment from core catcher samples was dropped into a “bead” o f water and ethanol (mixed at a 5:1 ratio) with a meniscus “dome” o f water ${\sim}2\;\mathrm{mm}$ high that had been warming on a cover glass $30\;\mathrm{mm}$ $\times\ 20\ \mathrm{mm})$ ). The temperature difference between the drop of sediment suspension (room temperature) and water-alcohol solutio n warming on the cover glass, as well as interaction between the suspended sediment and alcohol solution, led to rapid motion of particles on the cover glass and an even and random distribution o f particles, which were allowed to dry completely on the cover glas s on the hot plate. The cover glass was then mounted on a labele d glass slide with Norland optical adhesive Number 61 (refractive in${\mathrm{dex}}=1.56)$ and cured under a UV lamp until solid.  

For samples in which siliceous microfossils are very rare o r highly fragmented, which is common in glaciomarine shelf environments (e.g., Harwood et al., 1989; Sjunneskog and Scherer, 2005 ) and was the situation with most core catcher samples examine d during Expedition 374, a process involving sieving the sedimen t suspension through a $20~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ sieve helped concentrate the diatom s and recover whole or nearly whole diatom valves that could be identified. Suspended sediment samples disaggregated during $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ an d borax treatment for radiolarian and foraminifer study (see Radiolarians and Foraminifers) were provided for diatom study of thei r residual ${<}63\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction. By making strewn slides in a simila r fashion to that described above, examination of the $^{<63}$ to ${>}20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction for diatoms allowed for the recovery of identifiable diatom specimens in most samples. However, this concentration effect, which is essential for providing a sufficient number of identifiabl e specimens to allow rapid age interpretations of core catcher samples, likely increased the presence of large, heavily silicified, and reworked  species  and  removed  or  reduced  the  number  o f biostratigraphically important smaller diatoms from these slides.  

To separate and concentrate these smaller diatoms from th e abundant clay-sized suspension of clay, fine silt, and abundant smal l diatom fragments, a method of timed gravity settling was employe d to concentrate more complete small diatoms. In this process, muc h of the clay-sized component remained in suspension and diatom s were concentrated by settling to the bottom of a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifug e tube. This process involved extracting ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{~mL~}$ of suspended ra w sample from the thoroughly mixed suspension in the stock $15~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube with a disposable pipette. After thorough shaking t o mix the suspension, it was allowed to stand vertically for $_{30\;s}$ to allow coarse particles to settle to the bottom. Bubbles were then injected by pipette into the suspension at ${\sim}2\;\mathrm{cm}$ from the base of th e tube to mix and randomize the suspension above that level. The  2 mL aliquot was introduced gently into the uppermost $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ of a 1 5 mL centrifuge tube filled with $12\,\mathrm{mL}$ of deionized water. The pipett e end was moved in a gentle circular motion in the top of the waterfilled tube as the $2~\mathrm{mL}$ sample was slowly inserted into the uppe r water column. The resulting diluted suspension was allowed to settle undisturbed for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ . During this time, diatom valves of all sizes, including small diatoms, and sediment particles settled to o r near the bottom. After $30\ \mathrm{min}$ of undisturbed settling, all material that settled to the bottom of the tube, as well as the lowest $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ o f the water column, was extracted by a pipette and placed into a vial for storage. If additional diatom concentration and clay removal wa s required, the material extracted from the base of the tube was injected into another water-filled centrifuge tube to repeat this process of separating clay-sized suspension from settled diatoms. Strewn slides were made of the resuspended settled material wit h the strewn-slide approach described above. If necessary, the “bubble method” of Harwood (1986) was employed to further separat e siliciclastic sediment grains and sediment particles from the hydrodynamically lighter diatoms in the ${>}20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction sample vial before extracting suspended material for preparation of strew n slides. In some cases, an additional concentration step was taken t o remove clay and concentrate diatoms by allowing suspended sediment to settle for 15 to $30~\mathrm{s}$ within the vertically held transfer pipette before adding the initial drops of sediment-laden suspensio n into the bead of water warming on the cover glass. Diatoms are preferentially concentrated in the lower portion of the suspended wate r column in the transfer pipette.  

Samples were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop.A1 transmittedlight microscope. Photomicrographs were taken using a SPOT Fle x $64\,\mathrm{Mp}$ digital camera and uploaded to the LIMS database. A Hitach i TM3000 tabletop scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used fo r higher magnification micrographs of selected specimens. Qualitative siliceous microfossil group abundances were determined fro m strewn slides using $630\times$ magnification. Care was taken to ensur e strewn slides were prepared with similar amounts of sediment. Fo r each sample, the diatom abundance was qualitatively estimated b y light-microscopic observations at $630\times$ magnification with the examination of five random fields of view (FOVs) as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( $^{>5}$ complete valves per FOV).   
• $C=$ common (2 to 5 complete valves per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ frequent (1 complete valve in 1 to 5 FOVs).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 complete valve in 6 to 30 FOVs).   
• $\mathrm{Tr=}$ trace (very rare valves or diatom fragments).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no diatom valves or fragments observed).  

Relative abundances of individual taxa were categorized in reference to their occurrence in FOVs or in reference to one travers e across a $30\;\mathrm{mm}$ wide cover glass ( $\left[{\sim}55\right.$ FOVs) as follows:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( $_{>10}$ valves per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $^{>5}$ and $^{<10}$ valves FOV).   
• $C=$ common (1–5 valves per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ frequent (1 valve in every 10 FOVs).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $_{<5}$ valves per traverse).   
• ${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ trace ( $_{<1}$ valve per traverse or fragments noted).  

Shipboard observations of diatom assemblages logged in DESClogik focused on the presence of age-diagnostic species, so the distribution data do not represent the full diatom assemblage. All diatom semiquantitative abundance data produced onboard wer e logged in DESClogik.  

Preservation of individual siliceous microfossil groups was determined qualitatively and reported in the following terms of fragmentation and/or dissolution:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ preservation (little or no evidence of dissolution/recrystallization or fragmentation; primary morphological characteristics were only slightly altered; specimens were identifiable to the species level).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate preservation (specimens exhibit some etching/recrystallization and/or fragmentation; primary morphological characteristics were somewhat altered; most specimens were identifiable to the species level).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ preservation (specimens were severely dissolved/replaced and/or fragmented; primary morphological characteristics were largely destroyed; specimens were identified at the genus level, but species identification was often difficult).  

# Age assignment  

Initial shipboard age assignment of individual Neogene sample s was based on diatom biostratigraphy by applying the biostratigraphic zonation for Southern Ocean sites of Harwood an d  

Maruyama (1992) (Oligocene to recent) and Censarek and Gersonde (2002) and for Antarctic continental shelf sites by applyin g the zonations of Winter et al. (2012) (Plio–Pleistocene) and Olney e t al. (2007) (Oligocene to early Miocene). A wealth of biostratigraphi c information is available from core-based studies listed in Diato m taxonomy and the integrated biochronological syntheses in the associated volumes for each leg/expedition (e.g., Gersonde et al., 1990; Barron et al., 1991; Harwood et al., 1992). Ages applied to specific diatom events and zonal boundaries were guided by successiv e iterations of the diatom biochronology afforded by CONOP analysis (Cody et al., 2008, 2012; Florindo et al., 2013) and are in general agreement with ages of appearance and extinction of Souther n Ocean endemic planktonic diatoms presented in Barron (2003). Age assignments for diatom datum levels are presented in Figur e F12 and Table T1.  

Radiolarians Radiolarian taxonomy and zonal schemes The main taxonomic concepts for the Neogene radiolarian s studied here are from Petrushevskaya (1975), Caulet (1991), Nigrin i and Lombari (1984), Lombari and Lazarus (1988), Lazarus (1990, 1992), Abelmann (1992), Nigrini and Sanfilippo (2001), and Vigou r and Lazarus (2002). All radiolarian semiquantitative abundanc e data produced on board were logged in DESClogik and are availabl e in downloadable large-format tables for each site.

The Southern Ocean radiolarian zones introduced by Lazaru s (1990, 1992) and Abelmann (1992) were collated and applied here, and the composite zonation is shown in Figure F12. Lazarus (1992 ) refined the middle Miocene to Pleistocene zonation previously established by Lazarus (1990) based on material recovered durin g ODP Legs 119 and 120. The early to middle Miocene is represente d by the zonation developed by Abelmann (1992) based on Leg 12 0 material.  

The original age estimates for Neogene radiolarian datums ar e based on their calibration to magnetostratigraphy according t o Hays and Opdyke (1967), Gersonde et al. (1990), Barron et al. (1991), Caulet (1991), Abelmann (1992), Lazarus (1992), Harwoo d et al. (1992), Shackleton et al. (1995), and Kamikuri et al. (2004). T o directly integrate radiolarian and diatom biostratigraphic results, we adopted the CONOP estimates for the ages of radiolarian event s presented in Table T2 (Hybrid model column; for details see Florindo et al., 2013). The age estimates for the few radiolarian datum s not included in Florindo et al. (2013) have been recalibrated to th e  

GTS2012 using the Neptune Sandbox database (http://www.nsbmfn-berlin.de) and are shown in the rightmost column in Table T2.  

# Methods for radiolarian study  

A ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ sediment sample was disaggregated in a beaker containing ${\sim}50~\mathrm{mL}$ of water by adding a $10\%$ solution of hydrogen peroxide together with an arbitrary amount of dilute borax and gentl y warming it on a hot plate. After effervescence subsided (typically after $30\,\mathrm{\min}$ to $1\mathrm{~h~}$ ), the suspension was washed through a $63~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ sieve. Two strewn slides per sample were prepared by pipetting th e ${>}63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ residue onto a $22\:\mathrm{mm}\times50\:\mathrm{mm}$ microscope cover glass tha t was dried on a hot plate. Twelve drops of Norland optical adhesiv e Number 61 mounting medium was applied to the $25\ \mathrm{mm}\times75\ \mathrm{mm}$ glass slide. The cover glass with dried sediment was then inverte d and placed gently on the slide. The mounting medium was fixed b y placing the slide under an ultraviolet lamp for approximately 1 5 min. Species were identified, and their abundances were estimate d using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with bright-field illumination a t $100\times$ and $200\times$ magnification. Photomicrographs were taken usin g a SPOT Flex 64 Mp digital camera and uploaded to the LIMS database. A Hitachi TM3000 tabletop SEM was used for higher magnification micrographs of selected specimens.

For each sample, the total abundance of radiolarians was estimated qualitatively by light-microscopic observations at $100\times$ magnification along one horizontal traverse of the cover glass an d recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $>\!100$ specimens/traverse).   
• $C=$ common (51–100 specimens/traverse).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ frequent (11–50 specimens/traverse).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1–10 specimens/traverse).   
• $\mathrm{Tr}=$ trace (1–10 specimens/slide).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (absent).  

Shipboard observations of radiolarian assemblages logged i n DESClogik focused on the presence of age-diagnostic species, s o the distribution data do not represent the full radiolarian assemblage.  

Qualitative estimates of individual species abundances were als o recorded by scanning through both slides at $100\times$ magnification, according to the following scheme:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $^{\geq2}$ specimens/FOV).   
• $C=$ common (1 specimen/FOV).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ frequent (1 specimen/2–5 FOVs).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen/5–30 FOVs).   
• ${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ present (≤1 specimen/traverse).  

Preservation of the radiolarian assemblages was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (most specimens complete; fine structures preserved). • $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (minor dissolution and/or breakage). • $\mathbf{P}=$ poor (common dissolution, recrystallization, and/or breakage).  

# Foraminifers  

# Planktonic foraminifer taxonomy and zonal schemes  

Neogene planktonic foraminifer taxonomic concepts follo w those of Jenkins (1971), Kennett (1973), Kennett and Vella (1975), Jenkins (1978), Hornibrook (1982), Kennett and Srinivasan (1983), Leckie and Webb (1985), Cifelli and Scott (1986), Hornibrook et al. (1989), Scott et al. (1990), Berggren (1992), and Majewski (2010), a s well as those compiled in the online pforams@mikrotax databas e (http://www.mikrotax.org/pforams).  

For sediment intervals deposited under the influence of tropical–subtropical water, the Cenozoic zonal scheme of Wade et al. (2011) with datum ages from Gradstein et al. (2012) are most appropriate. Given our southern high-latitude location, the Subantarcti c zonal scheme of Berggren (1992; Leg 120, Kerguelen Plateau) an d austral temperate zonal scheme of Jenkins (1993) were utilized wit h ages updated to the GTS2012, as well as datums used by GNS Science for planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy (Crundwell et al., 2016). In addition, biostratigraphically important species used t o define the base of New Zealand series and stages were also use d (Raine et al., 2015) (Figure F12). Note that a magnetostratigraphically calibrated mid-latitude planktonic foraminifer zonal schem e for New Zealand and the Southwest Pacific region is currently lacking. Ages for planktonic foraminifer events used here are shown i n Figure F12 and Table T3.

# Foraminifer-based paleoenvironmental analysis  

Planktonic foraminifers are rare on the Ross Sea continenta l shelf but become increasingly abundant in deeper water settings o f the slope and rise. The distribution of planktonic foraminifer s around Antarctica is strongly zonal (e.g., Bé, 1969) and is controlle d by the distribution of surface water masses and dynamic oceanographic fronts, including the Antarctic Polar Front and Subantarcti c Front (e.g., Nelson and Cooke, 2001; Sokolov and Rintoul, 2002). Incursions of subantarctic or temperate water taxa into the Ross Se a may be associated with changes in sea ice cover and productivity o r times of extreme warmth, including superinterglacials of the lat e Neogene and Quaternary. Degree of test encrustation and ratio o f left-coiling Neogloboquadrina pachyderma to right-coiling Neogloboquadrina incompta are also useful proxies of surface water mas s properties (e.g., Asioli and Langone, 1997; Bergami et al., 2009).  

The carbonate compensation depth (CCD) is much shallower i n the Ross Sea today than in the open ocean (e.g., ${\sim}400{-}650\ \mathrm{m};$ ; Kennett, 1966; also see Echols, 1971; Igarashi et al., 2001). The calcareous to agglutinated benthic foraminifer ratio was estimated to trac k changes in the CCD or water mass corrosiveness through time.  

Quaternary benthic foraminifers have been found to track ic e proximal, ice distal, and open-marine hemipelagic and pelagic lithofacies in the Ross Sea (e.g., Osterman and Kellogg, 1979; Ward et al., 1987; Melis and Salvi, 2009; Majewski et al., 2018). Benthic foraminiferal diversity, abundance, preservation, fragmentation, and reworking are additional proxies of paleoenvironmental conditions a t the seafloor.  

To assess benthic foraminiferal paleoecology, taxa were allocated into morphogroups following Corliss (1985, 1991), Jones an d Charnock (1985), and Corliss and Chen (1988). Benthic foraminifers with planoconvex, biconvex, rounded trochospiral, tubular, coiled flattened, milioline, and palmate tests are inferred to hav e had an epifaunal mode of life (living at the sediment surface or i n the upper centimeter of the sediment). Infaunal foraminifers livin g in the deeper layers of sediment have cylindrical or flattened tapered, spherical, rounded planispiral, flattened ovoid, globular unilocular, or elongate multilocular tests. The comparison betwee n fossil and recent foraminifers is not straightforward, and for man y taxa the close relationship between test morphology and microhabitat has not been observed but instead is extrapolated from dat a on other taxa (e.g., Jorissen, 1999), so the relationship between morphology and microhabitat may not always be certain (Buzas et al., 1993). Morphogroup analysis is used as a proxy for combined oxygenation and food availability in the deep ocean (Jorissen et al., 2007).  

The comparison of fossil and recent assemblages and the occurrence and abundance of depth-related species and their upper dept h limits (e.g., Hayward, 1986; van Morkhoven et al., 1986; Hayward e t al., 2013) allowed us to infer a paleobathymetry for sediment intervals at each site. Antarctic margin species depth information i s based on Kennett (1968), Echols (1971, for agglutinated taxa), Fillo n (1974), Anderson (1975), Osterman and Kellogg (1979), and Patterson and Ishman (2012). Paleodepth zones follow van Morkhoven e t al. (1986) using the following categories:  

• Neritic $=-200$ meters below sea level (mbsl).   
• Bathyal $=200{-}2000\;\mathrm{mbsl}.$ . • Upper bathya $=200{-}600\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ . • Middle bathyal $=600–1000$ mbsl. • Lower bathyal $=1000{-}2000\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ .   
• Abyssal $=>\!2000$ mbsl.  

# Methods for foraminifer study  

Sediment was soaked in a solution of $10\%$ hydrogen peroxid e and borax (\~5 tablespoons/L) for at least $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$ and then heated o n a hot plate for $15{-}20\ \mathrm{min}$ . The sediment was then washed with ta p water over a $63\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ wire mesh sieve. The ${<}63\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction was captured in a beaker for diatom strewn-slide and sieved preparations. Stiffer or semilithified sediments were chopped into smaller particles using a sharp-edged tool or crushed into pea-sized pieces usin g a hammer. All samples were dried on filter paper on a low-temperature hot plate with careful attention paid to not burn the sample.  

Each dried ${>}63~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sample residue was sprinkled on a blackgridded picking tray and examined under a Zeiss Discovery V8 binocular light microscope for benthic and planktonic foraminifers. Photomicrographs were taken using a SPOT idea digital camera an d uploaded to the LIMS database. Individual specimens were picke d from the sample using a very fine brush and mounted on a gridde d cardboard slide coated with a thin layer of water-soluble paste mad e from gum tragacanth powder. For samples that required further siz e separation, the ${>}63~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ residue was dry-sieved through a series o f sieves with 710, 250, and $125\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ wire mesh. Species identification s were generally made on the 250 to $710\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ and 125 to $250~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ siz e fractions; time permitting, the 63 to $125\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction wa s scanned for small or rare species.  

The preservation state of planktonic and benthic foraminifer s was estimated as follows:  

• $\mathrm{E}=$ excellent (totally glassy specimens with no to very little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (some minor evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (common but minor calcite overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbf{poor}$ (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, or fragmentation).  

The planktonic to benthic foraminifer ratio (P/B) was visuall y estimated as a first approximation of carbonate dissolution.  

The following foraminifer group abundance categories relativ e to total sediment particles were estimated from visual examinatio n of the dried sample in the ${>}63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( $550\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!25\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $C=$ common $?510\%{-}25\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $_{>1\%-5\%}$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present ( $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren.  

For a given sample, the percentage of key planktonic and benthi c foraminifer species in the ${>}63~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction were categorized as follows:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $530\%$ of species on the tray).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!10\%-30\%$ of species on the tray).   
• $C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}25\%$ of species on the tray).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ of species on the tray).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(>\!1\%-5\%$ of species on the tray).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $(<\!1\%$ of species on the tray).  

# Palynology  

# Dinocyst taxonomy and zonation scheme  

Dinocyst taxonomy follows Williams et al. (2017), Clowes et al. (2016), and Bijl et al. (2018a). The most recent update of a globall y integrated,  magnetostratigraphically  calibrated  dinocyst  stratigraphy for the Neogene is presented in Bijl et al. (2015). No complete integrated stratigraphic dinocyst framework exists currentl y for the Neogene of the Southwest Pacific. Biomagnetostratigraphi c information for dinocysts from the Oligocene and early to middl e Miocene are available from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 318 Hole U1356A (Bijl et al., 2018a). Palynological record s from DSDP Leg 28 (Kemp, 1975), ODP Leg 188 Site 1165 (Hannah, 2006), Cape Roberts Project drilling (Hannah et al., 2000; Clowes e t al., 2016), and ODP Leg 178 (Harland and Pudsey, 2002) also serv e as reference schemes. Here, we report the FADs and LADs for Neogene dinocyst taxa found in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes,  Northern  Hemisphere  mid-latitudes,  and  Norther n Hemisphere high latitudes, all calibrated to the GTS2012 (Table T4 ) as reported in Bijl et al. (2015) and references therein. The dinocys t event data shown in Figure F12 are a selection based on species encountered during Expedition 318 of those reported in Table T4.  

# Methods for palynology study  

Approximately $20\ \mathrm{g}$ of sediment was processed according t o standard palynological laboratory protocols (e.g., Brinkhuis et al., 2003). Samples were digested with $30\%$ HCl and cold $40\%$ HF to dissolve carbonate and silicate materials, respectively, followed by $10\%$ HCl leaching to remove silicate gels, with centrifuging and decanting after each step. Residues were sieved with nylon 250 and $10\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieves, put through an ultrasonic bath, and subsequently mounte d on glass microscope slides using glycerine jelly. Species identification and data collection were carried out with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using bright-field illumination at $400\times$ , $630\times$ (oil), an d $1000\times$ (oil) magnification. Photomicrography was conducted usin g a SPOT Flex $64\,\mathrm{Mp}$ digital camera, and images were uploaded to th e LIMS database.  

# Palynomorph abundance and preservation  

Palynofacies were grouped into the following broad categories:  

• In situ marine organic-walled dinocysts, • Reworked marine organic-walled dinocysts, • Foraminifer test linings,   
• Prasinophytes,   
• Acritarchs,   
• In situ sporomorphs (pollen and spores), • Reworked sporomorphs (pollen and spores), • Black phytoclasts,   
• Brown phytoclasts,   
• Fungal spores, and   
• Amorphous organic matter.  

For semiquantitative estimates of the abundance of these palynofacies groups, the following scale was used:  

• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant $590\%$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $\mathrm{[\%-10\%}$ of palynomorphs).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare ${<}1\%$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathbf{BR}=\mathbf{\partial}$ barren to rare (few specimens identified in two slides).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (not present).

Dinocysts in each sample were identified at genus or specie s level. The following qualitative indication of their occurrence i s given in the tables of each site chapter:  

• ${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ present.   
• ${\mathrm{XX}}=$ common to abundant.  

For biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental purposes, shipboard analysis of palynomorphs focused primarily on determinin g the presence of age-diagnostic dinocyst taxa and characterizing th e palynological assemblage in terms of paleoenvironment. When possible, given dinocyst yields and time, dinocyst counts were carrie d out per sample. For each sample, at least two slides were scanned o r counted.  

Terrestrial sporomorphs identified during these counts wer e also quantitatively registered, attributing them to the following fou r broad categories:  

• Saccate pollen, • Nothofagus pollen, • Other pollen, and • Spores.  

Palynomorph preservation was qualitatively classified as one o f the following levels:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of degradation or oxidation).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (some evidence of degradation or oxidation).   
• $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{poor}$ (major degradation or oxidation has occurred).  

# Palynology-based paleoenvironmental analysis  

The use of palynomorphs, in particular dinocysts, as paleoenvironmental indicators derives from information on the present-da y global dinocyst distribution published in Zonneveld et al. (2013). Esper and Zonneveld (2007) and Prebble et al. (2013) provided detailed ecological indications for dinocysts in the Southern Ocea n and the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, respectively. These indications can be used for paleoenvironmental reconstructions o f Neogene and Quaternary sediments because many species are stil l extant. Previous investigations of circum-Antarctic Oligocene an d Neogene sedimentary sequences (Hannah et al., 2000; Hannah, 2006; Warny et al., 2009; Houben et al., 2013; Clowes et al., 2016 ) yielded predominantly protoperidinioid dinocysts (the likely cyst o f heterotrophic dinoflagellates), which are generally associated with  a high-productivity, sea ice environment. More recent studies of Oligocene and Miocene sediments from Expedition 318 also reveale d the presence of abundant phototrophic dinocysts (Bijl et al., 2018b; Sangiorgi et al., 2018). Based on this framework, the differential occurrence of taxa is used to reconstruct environmental parameter s such as surface water productivity, surface water temperature, an d the presence of sea ice.  

Other aquatic palynomorphs, in particular acritarchs and prasinophytes, were used to obtain information on meltwater input/water stratification.  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

# Taxonomy and zonal framework  

Calcareous nannofossils are very rare to absent in Neogene t o recent sediments around Antarctica, and their presence in Neogen e sediments is often associated with intervals of extreme warmth, such as superinterglacials. As a result, nannofossils are less usefu l for biostratigraphy in Neogene sediments from the southern hig h latitudes but can be used as paleoenvironmental indicators. Taxonomic concepts for calcareous nannofossils follow those given i n Perch-Nielsen (1985) and Bown (1998). Calibrated ages for biostratigraphic events are from Gradstein et al. (2012).  

# Methods for calcareous nannofossil study  

Smear slides prepared by the diatom and sedimentology shipboard scientists were examined for calcareous nannofossils on  a semiregular basis. In intervals of coarser grained sediments, strew n slides were prepared by suspending a small amount of sediment i n water, shaking to homogenize, and then allowing the coarse particles to settle out of the suspension for ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{min}$ . The suspension wa s then pipetted onto a cover glass on a hot plate. After the water evaporated, the cover glass was affixed to a glass microscope slide usin g Norland optical adhesive Number 61 and then cured under U V light. Strewn slides were sometimes prepared using the ${<}20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction from the diatom preparations or the ${<}63\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction retained after sieving for foraminifers. Slides were examined on  a Zeiss Axiophot or Axioskop.A1 microscope equipped with oil immersion objectives under cross-polarized and plane-transmitte d light at $400\times$ to $1600\times$ magnification. Photomicrographs were take n using a SPOT Flex 64 Mp digital camera and uploaded to the LIM S database.  

Total calcareous nannofossil abundance within the sedimen t was visually estimated at $630\times$ magnification and reported using th e following abundance categories:  

• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 or more specimens/traverse of a $30\;\mathrm{mm}$ cover glass).   
• ${\mathrm{VR}}=$ very rare ( $_{<1}$ specimen/traverse).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no nannofossils present in two or more traverses).  

The relative abundance of individual calcareous nannofossi l species or taxa groups was estimated at $1000\times$ magnification as follows:  

• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 or more specimens/traverse of a $30\;\mathrm{mm}$ cover glass).   
• ${\mathrm{VR}}=$ very rare ( $_{<1}$ specimen/traverse).   
• $^{*}=$ reworked (presence of species interpreted as reworked).   
• $?=$ questionable (questionable specimen of that taxon).  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils was categorized as follows:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little dissolution and/or overgrowth was observed, with no or only slightly altered primary morphological features). • $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (dissolution and/or overgrowth was evident and primary morphological features were somewhat altered, but most specimens were identifiable to the species level). • $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{poor}$ (severe dissolution, fragmentation, and/or overgrowth was observed; primary morphological features have largely been destroyed; and most specimens cannot be identified at the species and/or generic level).  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations during Expedition 374 mainly focused on measuring the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) o f archive-half core sections before and after alternating field (AF) demagnetization. The paleomagnetic and rock magnetic properties o f the core, as well as the magnetic fabric, were further assessed o n discrete samples ( $^{\cdot\sim7}$ or $8~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ ) taken from working-half core sections.  

# Samples and measurements  

NRM measurements were made using a 2G Enterprises Model760R-4K superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) equippe d with direct-current superconducting quantum interference device s (DC-SQUIDs) and an inline, automated AF demagnetizer capabl e of reaching a peak field of $80~\mathrm{mT}$ . The spatial resolution is determined from the integrated response function (following Acton e t al., 2017), with effective lengths of $7.30~\mathrm{cm}$ for the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis, $7.30~\mathrm{cm}$ for the $y$ -axis, and $9.00\,\mathrm{cm}$ for the $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axis. The practical noise level o f the SRM is $\sim\!2\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{Am}^{2}$ and is primarily controlled by the magnetization of the core liner and the background magnetization of th e measurement tray.  

At the beginning of every working shift (approximately every 1 2 h), we physically cleaned the sample tray with window cleaner o r isopropyl alcohol and wiped the tray with antistatic solution. Th e sample tray was then AF demagnetized with a peak field of $30\;\mathrm{mT}$ , and its remanence was measured to ensure accurate tray correctio n values.  

NRM measurements of the archive-half core sections wer e made at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals with a $15~\mathrm{cm}$ trailer and leader interval t o monitor the background magnetic moment. Typically, we measure d the initial NRM and the NRM after AF demagnetization with pea k fields of 10 and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ . When time permitted, we also measured th e NRM after 5 and/or $15\;\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization. The availabl e time for measurements was primarily limited by core flow throug h the laboratory, equal to roughly $1\mathrm{-}3\,\mathrm{h}$ per core.  

During Expedition 374, low-field magnetic susceptibility wa s measured at $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution on whole-round core sections usin g the WRMSL and on archive-half core sections using the SHMS L (see Physical properties). In figures, we use the instrument units o f the WRMSL and label them as $10^{-5}$ SI volume units, which is  a rough conversion factor. The Bartington user manual gives the conversion to SI units for a $66\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter core measured with the 9 0 mm Bartington susceptibility loop as $1.36\,\times\,10^{-5}$ . Cores collecte d with the RCB and XCB coring systems have a nominal diameter o f $58~\mathrm{mm}$ and sometimes less, depending on the nature of the sediment. Therefore, the conversion factor for these cores is lower an d likely between ${\sim}1\times10^{-5}$ and $1.36\times10^{-5}$ .  

We typically collected one oriented discrete sample per one o r two sections from most working-half core sections of each hole, depending on site-specific characteristics such as lithologic change s or to refine the magnetostratigraphy. These discrete samples wer e used for measurements of mean bulk magnetic susceptibility, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), and NRM after stepwise A F demagnetization. We collected discrete samples from Hole A a t each site, from the lower part of the stratigraphic section of any subsequent holes that cored deeper than Hole A, and from any intervals that were not recovered in previous holes. Discrete sample s were collected by pushing plastic Natsuhara-Giken (“Japanese” ) cubes $\mathrm{2~cm}$ external edge length and internal volume of ${\sim}7~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ ) into working-half core sections with the arrow marker on the cub e pointing upcore. The sample $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis is toward the double lines on th e working-half core sections, and the up arrow marks the negative $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ - axis (toward core top) (Figure F13A, F13C). When the sedimen t was more indurated, an extruder was pushed into the working hal f and the sample was placed into the plastic cubes. Alternatively, depending on the sediment firmness, the sediment was extruded ont o a clean cutting board and the cube was placed on top. Additional care was taken to separate these two methods of sampling with th e extruder because they yield different orientation schemes (see Coordinates). When the sediment (or hard rock) was too lithified t o use the extruder, oriented cubes $({\sim}8\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ were cut and trimmed using a dual-blade saw.  

We measured the AMS and mean (bulk) magnetic susceptibilit y of the discrete samples on a KLY 4S Kappabridge. To ensure accurate susceptibility values, we calibrated the KLY 4S prior to each sit e using the standard provided by AGICO. The Kappabridge SUFA R software measures AMS by rotating the sample along three axes, stacking the data, and estimating the best-fit second-order tensor. The mean (bulk) magnetic susceptibility is calculated as the averag e of the magnetic susceptibilities in all three orientations, and we referred to this as mean magnetic susceptibility throughout Expedition 374. We only use the directions and (relative) amplitudes of th e three principal axes, $k_{\mathrm{max}}$ (maximum susceptibility axis), $k_{\mathrm{int}}$ (intermediate axis), and $k_{\mathrm{min}}$ (minimum axis), of the susceptibility tenso r to approximate magnetic fabric (i.e., grain shape and orientation; Figure F14). When sediments are deposited in an undisturbed condition, sedimentary fabrics are oblate and the vertical axis has mini

mum susceptibility (e.g., Figure F14B). Disturbance by slumping o r other deformation often yields triaxial fabrics (e.g., Figure F14D) . Hence, we use the AMS as an indicator of disturbance.  

At each site, a selected group of discrete samples were used fo r NRM measurements. We used the SRM with inline AF demagnetizer to measure the NRM of discrete samples before and after A F demagnetization. Discrete samples were placed on a discrete sample tray with each sample separated from the adjacent ones by 2 0 cm to avoid convolution effects of the SRM sensor responses. Samples were measured with their orientation arrows facing upwar d and pointing out of the magnetometer (“top-away”), which equate s to the $-z$ -axis of the magnetometer (e.g., Figure F13B). After measuring the initial NRM, the discrete samples were subjected to progressive AF demagnetization and measured at $2~\mathrm{mT}$ steps to a pea k field of $20\;\mathrm{mT},$ , in $5\;\mathrm{mT}$ steps to $60\;\mathrm{mT},$ , and then at 70 and $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ t o determine  whether  a  characteristic  remanent  magnetizatio n (ChRM) could be resolved and, if so, what level of demagnetizatio n was required to resolve it.  

To process the shipboard paleomagnetic measurement data, w e exported formatted data files from the LIMS database. We used  a combination of a modified version of the UPmag program (Xua n and Channell, 2009) and PmagPy software (Tauxe et al., 2010) t o process all shipboard paleomagnetic data.  

# Coordinates  

All magnetic data are reported relative to IODP orientation conventions: $+x$ points into the face of the working half, $+y$ points toward the left side of the working half when looking downcore, an d $+z$ is downcore (Figure F13A). The relationship between the SR M coordinates $(X,Y,$ and $Z,$ ) and the sample coordinates $(x,y,$ , and $z$ ) i s $+X=+x,+Y=+y,$ , and $+Z=-z$ for archive halves and $+X=-x,+Y=$ $-y,$ and $+Z=-z$ for working halves (Figure F13). Note that the orientation of the SRM axes forms a left-handed coordinate syste m that is converted to a right-handed system within the SRM softwar e by multiplying the calibration constant for the $y.$ -axis by $^{-1}$ .  

The orientation of discrete samples depends on how the sampl e is collected. For samples collected by pushing the Japanese cube int o the working half, the arrow on the sample points upcore along the $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ - axis and is along the face of the working half as in Figure F13A an d F13C. For samples that are extruded into the plastic cube, we plac e a prominent red arrow on the lid that supersedes the embedded arrow that is in the base of all Japanese cubes. The orientation o f sawed cubes and cubes placed on top of extruded sediment follow s the orientation of the Japanese cubes.  

# Core collection and orientation (APC)  

Cores were collected using nonmagnetic core barrels for th e APC, HLAPC, and RCB coring systems. These nonmagnetic cor e barrels are more brittle and cannot be used in conjunction with th e XCB system (see Coring and drilling operations). The BHA included a Monel (nonmagnetic) drill collar that was used for all AP C and RCB cores. This collar is required when the Icefield MI-5 cor e orientation tool is used, but it was used for all (HL)APC/RCB core s during Expedition 374 (regardless of orientation tool use) because i t can potentially reduce the magnetic field near where the core is cu t and within the core barrel.  

The Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool can only be used wit h APC core barrels. It uses three orthogonally mounted fluxgate magnetometers to record the orientation of the double lines scribed o n the core liner with respect to magnetic north. The tool declination, inclination, total magnetic field, and temperature are recorded internally at a regular interval until the tool’s memory capacity i s filled. For the measurement interval of $10\;\mathrm{s}$ used during Expeditio n 374, the tool can typically be run for more than a day, although w e aimed to switch tools more frequently than that. Prior to firing th e APC, the core barrel is held stationary (along with the pipe an d  

BHA) for several minutes. During this time, data are recorded t o constrain the core orientation. When the APC fires, the core barre l is assumed to maintain the same orientation. An antispiral ke y keeps the core barrel from rotating as it is fired. However, the cor e may rotate and/or the core liner can twist as it penetrates the sediments.  

The Icefield MI-5 core orientation data collected during Expedition 374 are given in Table T5 along with the observed core mea n paleomagnetic directions. The mean direction of each core is computed using Fisher statistics from the archive-half core section measurements. All directions with positive inclinations were inverted t o their antipodal position by multiplying the inclination by $^{-1}$ an d adding $180^{\circ}$ to the declination. We then computed the mean by using all directions with inclinations between $-40^{\circ}$ and $-90^{\circ}$ . We repeated this process after culling any directions that were more tha n four times the $95\%$ confidence limits from the initial mean direction. This arbitrary cutoff was used to attempt to remove any outliers with declinations farthest from the majority of the data.  

The orientation correction that converts the observed declination $\left(D_{\mathrm{obs}}\right)$ to a true declination $(D_{\mathrm{true}})$ is given by  

$$
D_{\mathrm{true}}=D_{\mathrm{obs}}+\mathrm{MTF}+D_{\mathrm{amb}},
$$  

where MTF is the magnetic tool face angle from the Icefield MI- 5 orientation tool and $D_{\mathrm{amb}}$ is the ambient geomagnetic field declination obtained from geomagnetic field models. The World Magneti c Model 2015 gives a value of $\mathord{\sim}105^{\circ}$ for the drill sites. Given that th e Antarctic plate has not moved significantly over the past $20~\mathrm{My}$ (Torsvik et al., 2012), the expected true declination is roughly $0^{\circ}$ .  

Neither the core mean directions nor the Icefield observation s are ideal for use in core orientation. The steepness of the paleomagnetic field (with an inclination generally ${\sqrt{70^{\circ}}}$ ) and the present-da y  

Table T5. Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool data, Expedition 374. Corrected mean declination (Dec. culled $+\,{\mathsf{M T F}}+{\cal D}_{\mathrm{amb}})$ should be ${\sim}0^{\circ}\pm$ the typical error in th e Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool if the tool is functioning properly. The typical error in the geomagnetic field estimated by the Icefield MI-5 core orientatio n tool for IODP cores is not well documented, but it is suspected to be $\pm20^{\circ}$ or more. At high latitudes where the paleomagnetic vector is steep, even small error s in the geomagnetic field measured by the Icefield MI-5 can result in large corrected mean declination values rather than the expected $0^{\circ}.$ . Thus, the Icefield MI5 orientations may be accurate, but they are too imprecise to be used to orient cores at high latitudes like those for Expedition 374. The mean direction of eac h core is computed using Fisher Statistics. All directions with positive inclinations were inverted to their antipodal position by multiplying the inclination by – 1 and adding $180^{\circ}$ to the declination. MTF $=$ magnetic tool face. $N=$ number of directions averaged. Inc. all, Dec. all $=$ mean inclination and declination computed from all directions from a core with inclinations less than $-40^{\circ}$ or ${>}40^{\circ}$ . Fisher Statistics: $R=$ resultant vector length, $K\!=$ precision parameter, ${\tt G95}=95\%$ confidence interval. Inc. culled, Dec. culled $=$ mean inclination and declination computed from all directions from a core with inclinations less than $-40^{\circ}$ or ${>}40^{\circ}$ and that fall within an angular distance that is $4\times{\mathsf{a}}95$ of the mean Inc. all, Dec. all direction. Geomagnetic orientation angle $=$ angle needed to rotate th e culled core mean declination to $0^{\circ}$ . $D_{\mathsf{a m b}}=$ current magnetic inclination, which is $104.5^{\circ}$ using the WMM2015 model for a mean site position of $75^{\circ}\mathsf{S},$ , $175^{\circ}\mathbb{W}.$ .

geomagnetic field (inclination $\approx80^{\circ}$ ) result in the horizontal component (declination) being only a very small part of the total vecto r field. For example, when the inclination is $80^{\circ}.$ , a measurement erro r of only $20^{\circ}$ in angular distance of the geomagnetic field can yield  a declination of $0^{\circ}$ versus $180^{\circ}$ .  

Indeed, the corrected declinations do not cluster around the expected value of $0^{\circ}$ but instead are virtually random (Table T5; Figur e F15). For that reason, we did not use the correction during Expedition 374. In summary, the orientation tool clearly does not have th e precision necessary to orient cores at such high latitudes.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Magnetic polarity zones were predominantly assigned based o n changes in inclination after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization an d distinct $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ alternations in declination that occur in undisturbe d (HL)APC cores. Sediment disturbance caused by coring or geological processes (slumping, faulting, etc.) often leads to distorted an d unreliable paleomagnetic directional records and largely altere d sediment fabric. We examined the core face of each core section an d the high-resolution shipboard core photographs (see Lithostratigraphy) to mark disturbed intervals and avoided using paleomagnetic data from those intervals.  

Once a magnetostratigraphy was established for a given hole, w e correlated the pattern to the GTS2012, summarized in Table T6 an d illustrated in Figure F12, in close collaboration with the shipboar d biostratigraphy team. The GTS2012 includes orbitally tuned reversals between Chron C1n and the base of Subchron C5r.2n (0–11.65 7 Ma) and between the base of Chron C5ABn and Subchron C5Bn.1 n (13.608–15.215 Ma). The intervals between Subchron C5r.2n an d Chron C5ABn and between Chrons C5Bn and C6Cn (11.657– 13.608 and 15.215–23.030 Ma, respectively) are calibrated by splin e fitting of marine magnetic anomaly profiles following Lourens et al. (2004) and Hilgen et al. (2012). We follow the chron terminology o f Gradstein et al. (2012) and list several rarely observed polarit y changes that were not formally classified as subchrons in th e GTS2012 (remarks column in Table T6).

# Measurement interference from flux jumps  

Throughout the first half of Expedition 374, we noted a high occurrence of flux jumps in various circumstances. Flux jumps ma y occur due to a rapid change in magnetization in the sample, suc h that the SQUIDs cannot keep track of the number of counts. W e determined that slowing the track speed is the best way to reduc e the occurrence of this kind of flux jump.  

Flux jumps also occurred when there was no sample inside th e SRM, suggesting an external source. Acton et al. (2017) noted tha t mobile phones attempting to connect to a mobile network cause interference with the SQUIDs, yielding a large number of flux jumps. A large number of flux jumps on the $y$ -axis was especially noticeabl e during measurements of sediments with higher water content, especially when the section was located between the SQUID senso r region and the AF coils. We hypothesize that this effect is similar t o the antennae effect observed during previous expeditions (e.g., Expedition 342; Norris et al., 2014). We found this could be fixed b y shielding the region near where the SQUID cables enter th e magnetometer with aluminum foil.  

Smaller numbers of flux jumps on all axes continued to occu r even when no sample was in the magnetometer. These flux jump s occurred at intermittent moments of the day and could not b e traced to any actively transmitting mobile phone. The jumps als o occurred during background measurements (e.g., when the [empty ] tray was outside the SRM SQUID region, thereby excluding a relation to measurements of samples and/or the tray). When thes e types of flux jumps occurred, they caused SRM downtime rangin g from a few minutes to a few hours.  

After thorough investigation, we found that devices that connect to WiFi and/or Bluetooth (e.g., wireless headphones, smartwatches, mobile phones, notebooks, etc.) have the potential t o cause flux jumps when close to the entrance of the magnetometer. After disabling all such devices, we still noted one or two flux jump s that occurred with an apparent rhythmicity of ${\sim}65\mathrm{~s~}$ . These jump s were caused by a laptop ${\sim}3.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ away from the entrance to th e magnetometer connected to a temporary handheld pXRF device. The laptop uploaded its data to the LIMS database via a WiFi connection. As soon as this laptop was hardwired onto the network an d its WiFi connection disabled, these regular flux jumps disappeared.

In summary, mobile phones are a source of flux jumps, but WiF i and Bluetooth devices can also interfere with the SRM system. W e recommend that future expeditions remain vigilant of the occurrence of flux jumps and recognize that the SQUIDs are sensitive t o radio frequency interference, most notably when in close proximit y to devices that use Bluetooth, WiFi, and mobile reception.  

# Physical properties  

During Expedition 374, high-resolution physical property measurements were made on recovered core material. Physical propert y data aided lithostratigraphic characterization and were used to lin k core observations with downhole measurements and seismic-reflection profiles. In particular, physical property data played a majo r role in the detection of lithologic discontinuities and heterogeneities, identification of changes in sediment composition and texture, and identification of major seismic reflectors. In addition, the thermal properties of the recovered material were measured and wer e used in conjunction with downhole temperature measurements t o infer heat flow. A variety of techniques and methods were used o n whole-round core sections, section halves, and discrete samples t o characterize the physical properties of Expedition 374 cores.  

# General sampling and measurement sequence  

A typical IODP core is $9.5{-}9.7\ \mathrm{m}$ long and cut into $1.5\mathrm{~m~sec-}$ tions (see Coring and drilling operations and Curatorial procedures and core handling). Therefore, a core with ${\sim}100\%$ recover y yields six sections plus a shorter seventh section. Physical propert y measurement intervals for Expedition 374 were selected to ensur e that a full core could be analyzed without significantly impactin g core flow through the laboratory. Prior to splitting, whole-roun d core sections were analyzed using two whole-round core loggin g systems: the WRMSL and the NGRL. We did not use the Specia l Task Multisensor Logger (STML) because we did not conduct realtime stratigraphic correlation at any site. Whole-round core sections from all holes were run on the WRMSL (Figure F16) at $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution after equilibration for ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{h}$ to ambient room temperatur e $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and pressure. The WRMSL measures GRA bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and compressional wave velocity on the $P_{-}$ - wave logger (PWL). The PWL requires good contact between th e sediment and core liner, which is usually the case for cores collecte d using the APC or HLAPC system. Cores recovered with the XCB o r RCB system have a slightly smaller nominal diameter $\langle58\;\mathrm{mm}\rangle$ ) tha n those cored with the APC or HLAPC system $\left(66\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ ). As a result, sections cored with the XCB or RCB system typically have gaps between the liner and the core, and in these cases, $P$ -wave velocit y measurements with the WRMSL often fail or are outside the accepted velocity range $(1000{-}4500\ \mathrm{m/s})$ ). Therefore, the PWL wa s switched off for cores recovered using the XCB and RCB coring systems. Core sections were subsequently measured with the NGR L (Figure F17), which generates spectral gamma ray data. In one hol e at each site, thermal conductivity measurement was attempted o n one or two sections per core, and then repeat measurements wer e taken in subsequent holes as needed (Figure F18). For soft sediments, measurements were conducted with a needle probe inserte d

into the section through a small hole drilled through the plastic cor e liner close to the middle of the section. For lithified sediments,  a contact probe method in a half-space configuration was used o n split-core section halves for thermal conductivity measurements. After completion of whole-round measurements, the cores wer e split longitudinally, with one half designated as the archive sectio n and one half as the working section (see Curatorial procedure s and core handling) for sampling and additional analysis.  

Archive halves were measured with the SHMSL at $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution for magnetic susceptibility using a discrete point-source Bartington probe and for color reflectance and colorimetry with a n Ocean Optics spectrophotometer (Figure F19). For soft-sedimen t cores, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity and shear strength measurements were performed on the section halves (generally every section or every othe r section). $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements used the $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}^{\prime}$ -axis caliper contact probe transducer on the Section Half Measurement Gantr y (SHMG), typically with one analysis per section (Figure F20). Discrete samples ( $\left.\sim\!3\right.$ per core) for moisture and density (MAD) analysis were collected from the working halves, usually in Sections 1, 3, 5, and 7. These samples were then used to measure wet and dr y mass and dry volume to calculate wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density using MAD procedure s (Figure F21).  

An overview of the sampling strategy for physical property measurements is given in Table T7. A full discussion of methodologie s and calculations used on board the JOIDES Resolution in the physical properties laboratory is available in Blum (1997) and the shipboard  user  guides.  Details  and  procedures  for  each  physica l property measurement are described below.  

measurements. For the WRMSL, the sampling interval was $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ with an integration time of $3\,{\mathsf s}$ for each measurement. After measuring a core, calibration verification measurements were made b y passing a single core liner filled with deionized water through th e WRMSL.  

# GRA bulk density  

GRA bulk density is a reflection of porosity, grain size, grai n density (mineralogy), grain packing, and coring disturbance. Thes e properties can be used to estimate the pore volume in sediment an d evaluate the consolidation state. GRA density is an estimate of bul k density based on the attenuation of a gamma ray beam. The beam i s produced by a $^{137}\!C s$ gamma ray source at a radiation level of ${\sim}370$ MBq within a lead shield with a $5\ \mathrm{mm}$ collimator and directe d through the whole-round core (Figure F16). The gamma ray detector on the opposite side of the core from the source includes a scintillator and integral photomultiplier tube to record the gamm a radiation that passes through the core. The attenuation of gamm a rays occurs primarily by Compton scattering, in which gamma ray s are scattered by electrons in the formation; the degree of scatterin g is related to the material bulk density. Therefore, for a known thickness of sample, the density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of th e attenuated gamma rays and can be expressed as  

# WRMSL measurements  

During Expedition 374, GRA bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P$ -wave velocity were measured nondestructively on th e WRMSL (Figure F16). To optimize the measurement process, sampling intervals and measurement times were the same for all sensor s on each instrument. These sampling intervals are common denominators of the distances between the sensors installed on th e WRMSL $^{(30-50\ \mathrm{cm})}$ , which allows sequential and simultaneou s

disturbance; otherwise, measurements tend to underestimate tru e values. By default, the instrument reports measurements using th e internal diameter of the core liner $\left(66\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ as the assumed sampl e diameter. This assumption is suitable for most sediment cores obtained by the APC and HLAPC systems; however, for sedimen t and/or hard rock cored by the XCB or RCB systems, core diamete r is usually ${\sim}58\,\mathrm{~mm}$ or less. The spatial resolution of the GR A densitometer is less than $\pm1\;\mathrm{cm}$ . Calibration details can be found i n Blum (1997).  

# Magnetic susceptibility (pass-through loop)  

Magnetic susceptibility is measured on whole-round core sections using a pass-through loop on the WRMSL (Figure F16). Magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree t o which a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic field:  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an externa l field of strength $H.$ . Magnetic susceptibility is primarily sensitive t o the concentration of ferromagnetic minerals (e.g., magnetite, pyrite, and a few other iron oxides). It is also sensitive to magnetic mineralogy and can be related to the origin of the materials in the core an d their subsequent diagenesis. Paramagnetic minerals such as clay s have a specific magnetic susceptibility several orders of magnitud e lower than ferromagnetic minerals. Diamagnetic minerals such a s calcite/aragonite and opal, as well as water and plastic (core liner), have small to negative values of magnetic susceptibility. Thus, calcareous and siliceous biogenic deposits with very small amounts o f clay and iron-bearing minerals have values approaching the detection limit of the magnetic susceptibility meters.  

Magnetic susceptibility measurements were made using a Bartington Instruments MS2C loop sensor with a $90\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter. A n oscillator circuit in the sensor operates at a frequency of $565\,\mathrm{Hz}$ fo r the WRMSL (correction factor $=1.174\$ ) to avoid interference between the instruments. An ${\sim}140~\mathrm{A/m}$ alternating field produces  a low-intensity, nonsaturating alternating magnetic field. Sedimen t core sections going through the influence of this field cause  a change in oscillator frequency. Frequency information returned i n pulse form to the susceptometer is converted into magnetic susceptibility. The loop sensors have a spatial resolution of $20\;\mathrm{mm}$ and ar e accurate to within $5\%$ , as indicated in Bartington specification s (Blum, 1997). The output of the magnetic susceptibility sensors ca n be set to centimeter-gram-second (cgs) units or dimensionless S I units. Approximate SI units $\left(\times\,10^{-5}\right)$ are used as the IODP standar d and are reported as such in the LIMS database. See Paleomagnetism for a full discussion of the correction factor for conversion t o SI units.  

# Compressional $\pmb{P}.$ -wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity varies with the material’s lithology, porosity, an d bulk density, as well as state of stress, temperature, and fabric or degree of fracturing. In sediment and rock, velocity is controlled b y the degree of consolidation, lithification, and fracturing, along wit h the occurrence and abundance of free gas and gas hydrate. $P.$ -wav e velocity data can be used to assist in the correlation between th e cores  and  seismic-reflection  profiles,  the  correlation  betwee n downhole logging and core data, and the evaluation of porosity an d cementation. $P$ -wave (compressional) velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is defined by th e time required for a compressional wave to travel a specific distance:  

# $V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},$  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is th e traveltime through the core. $P$ -wave velocity was measured o n whole-round core sections using the PWL on the WRMSL (Figur e F16).  

The PWL measures the traveltime of $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasonic wave s horizontally across the core while it resides in the core liner. Wave s are transmitted to the core by transducer contacts connected to linear actuators. Pressure is applied to the actuators to ensure couplin g between the transducers and the core liner, and the space betwee n the core liner and transducers was kept wet to ensure good coupling. $P$ -wave velocity transducers measure total traveltime of th e compressional wave between transducers. The calibration of th e PWL accounts for errors in the total distance $(d_{\mathrm{total}})$ and the tota l traveltime $\left(t_{\mathrm{total}}\right)$ . Errors on $d_{\mathrm{total}}$ are assumed to come from the laserdistance measuring system. The core is surrounded by a core line r of assumed thickness $(L)$ , and the traveltime $\left(t_{\mathrm{liner}}\right)$ is determined b y measuring the traveltime through the core liner filled with distille d water of known velocity (corrected for the influence of temperature). A correction ( $\mathrm{\Delta}t_{\mathrm{delay}};$ system delay) is measured using the traveltime through a standard block of aluminum with a known velocit y $(6295~\mathrm{m/s})$ and a known thickness. Arrival times are made on th e second lobe of the waveform, giving a correction $\mathrm{(}t_{\mathrm{pulse}}\mathrm{)}$ from th e first arrival. During Expedition 374, $t_{\mathrm{pulse}}$ was included within $t_{\mathrm{delay}}.$ Consequently, the velocity of the core is  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{total}}-2L)/(t_{\mathrm{total}}-t_{\mathrm{liner}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}),
$$  

where  

$V_{\mathrm{p}}=$ velocity of the core,   
$d_{\mathrm{total}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner,   
$L=$ liner wall thickness,   
$t_{\mathrm{total}}=$ total measured traveltime for pulse to travel through core and liner,   
$t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ traveltime through liner, and   
$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry.  

# NGRL measurements  

The NGRL measures NGR emitted from the decay of long-period isotopes uranium $^{(238}\mathrm{U})$ , thorium $(^{232}\mathrm{Th})$ , and potassium $(^{40}\mathrm{K})$ on whole-round cores using a system designed and built at Texa s A&M University (USA) (Vasiliev et al., 2011; Dunlea et al., 2013). When $^{238}\mathrm{U}_{:}$ , $\ensuremath{^{232}}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotopes decay, they and thei r daughter products emit gamma radiation at specific energy level s unique to each isotope. NGR spectroscopy measures a wide energ y spectrum that can be used to estimate the abundance of each isotope based on the strength of the signal at characteristic energie s (Blum, 1997; Gilmore, 2008). In sediments and sedimentary rocks, Th and K are usually associated with particular clay minerals, whereas U is often encountered in either clay minerals or organicrich material. Because minor changes in the abundance of clay minerals produces a relatively large variation in gamma radiation, th e NGR data are useful as a lithologic indicator, aiding in core and/o r downhole data set correlation in single or multiple holes.  

The NGRL system consists of eight sodium iodide (NaI) detectors arranged along the core measurement axis at $20~\mathrm{cm}$ interval s surrounding the lower half of the section (Vasiliev, et al., 2011) (Figure F22). The detector array has passive (layers of lead) and activ e (plastic scintillators) shielding to reduce the background environmental and cosmic radiation. The overlying plastic scintillators detect incoming high-energy gamma and muon cosmic radiation an d cancel this signal from the total counted by the NaI detectors.  

The quality of the energy spectrum measured in a core depend s on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample but also on th e counting time, with greater times yielding better spectra. Therefore, a measurement run consisted of two sample positions located $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ apart. Measurements were conducted on each core section for $300\,{\sf s}$ at Position 1. After $300\;{\bf s}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the section was offset by $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ (Positio n 2) and measured again for $300\,{\sf s}$ . This yielded a total of 16 measurements $\left.10\;\mathrm{cm}\right.$ apart) per $150~\mathrm{cm}$ section. Measurement times wer e 5 min per measurement cycle, or ${\sim}10$ min per core section. Thes e settings yielded statistically significant total counts.  

# Thermal conductivity  

Thermal conductivity depends on the chemical composition , porosity, density, structure, and fabric of the material (e.g., Jumikis, 1966). Thermal conductivity is the measure of a material’s ability t o transmit heat by molecular conduction. In marine geophysics, thermal conductivity profiles of sediment and rock sections are use d along with in situ temperature measurements to determine hea t flow (see Downhole measurements). Heat flow is not only characteristic of the material but is also an indicator of the type and age o f ocean crust and the fluid circulation processes at both shallow an d deep depths (Blum, 1997).  

Thermal conductivity was measured on one or two sections pe r core (usually Sections 2 and 5) with the TK04 (Teka) system using  a needle probe method in full-space configuration on whole-roun d cores for soft sediments (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959). A contact probe method in half-space configuration was conducted o n section-half cores for lithified sediments and rocks. Some core s yielded no results for thermal conductivity because cracks cause d bad coupling of the probe to the sediment. The probes contain  a heater wire and calibrated thermistor. For soft sediment, the needl e probe was inserted into a $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ hole drilled through the liner alon g one of the lines that later guided core splitting. To avoid interferenc e from airflow in the laboratory, the core was placed in an enclose d box outfitted with foam (Figure F18). For lithified sediment cores, the section half was put in the enclosed box, and the contact prob e was put on the cut face of the sample. The contact probe was embedded in the surface of an epoxy block with a low thermal conductivity (Vacquier, 1985).

The quality of thermal conductivity measurements was checke d by evaluating two parameters: (1) the number of solutions acquire d and (2) the shape of the curve formed on the temperature versu s time plot of these points. A valid measurement must have a sufficient number of solutions to form an exponential curve. All measurements with a low number of solutions and/or a bad repartitio n of these values on the temperature versus time plot (i.e., formin g two curves or no curve) were deleted.  

The calibrated heat source of the probe was turned on, and th e increase in temperature was recorded over $^{80\ s}$ for measurement s with the needle probe and $60~\mathrm{s}$ for measurements with the contac t probe. A heating power of $2.5\:\mathrm{W/m}$ was typically used for soft sediment, and $0.5{-}2.5\ \mathrm{W/m}$ was typically used for lithified sediments. The solution to the heat conduction equation with a line source o f heat was then fit to the temperature measurements to obtain th e thermal conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductiv e than sediment, the probe is assumed to be a perfect conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of the superconductive prob e has a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of the time afte r the initiation of heat:  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\left(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of heat (s), and   
$C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three automatic measuring cycles were used to calculate average conductivity. A self-test, which included a drift study, was conducted at the beginning of each measurement cycle. Once the prob e temperature stabilized, the heater circuit was closed and the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity wa s calculated from the rate of temperature rise while the heater curren t was flowing. Temperatures measured during the first $60{\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{~s~}}}$ of th e heating cycles for the contact probe and $^{80\mathrm{~s~}}$ of the heating cycle s for the needle probe were fit to an approximate solution of a constantly heated line source (Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Measurement errors were $5\%{-}10\%$ .  

# SHMSL measurements  

Color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility were measured o n archive section halves using the SHMSL. Because both sensors require flush contact with the split-core face, sections were covere d with clear plastic and water was applied to the surface of the cor e prior to measurement. Foam inserts were also removed from th e section-half cores before measurement, so the measured values represent those of the core material only. The archive half of the spli t core was placed on the core track, above which an electronic platform moves along a track and records the height of the split-cor e surface with a laser sensor. The laser establishes the surface topography of the section, and then the platform reverses the direction o f movement, moving from the core section top (higher in the borehole) to bottom (lower in the borehole), making measurements o f point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance. During Expedition 374, point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance dat a were collected at $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals for each core.  

# Spectrophotometry  

The color reflectance spectrometer uses an Ocean Optics Q E Pro detector integrating sphere and associated light sources covering wavelengths from UV through visible to near infrared. Eac h measurement was recorded in $2~\mathrm{nm}$ wide spectral bands from 39 0 to $732\;\mathrm{nm}$ . The approximate 3 s data acquisition offset was applie d for the entire scan of the archive section half. Data are reported using the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color system, in which $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is rednes s (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative) of the sediment and rock. The colo r reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure white (reference) and pure black (dark). Color calibration was conducted approximately once every $^{6\mathrm{~h~}}$ (twice per shift). Additional detail s regarding measurement and interpretation of spectral data can b e found in Balsam et al. (1997), Balsam and Damuth (2000), and Giosan et al. (2002).  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

Point magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartingto n MS2 meter and an MS2K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diamete r round sensor with a field of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and an operatio n frequency of $930\,\mathrm{Hz}$ . The instrument averages three measurement s from the sensor for each offset with an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . The spatial resolution of the point magnetic susceptibility instrument is ${\sim}3.8$ mm. As with whole-round magnetic susceptibility loop measurements, the output displayed by the point magnetic susceptibilit y sensor is reported in instrument units (IU) and can be converted t o approximate dimensionless SI units by multiplying by $10^{-5}$ (see Paleomagnetism for a full discussion of the correction factor). Th e probe is zeroed in air before each measurement to avoid influenc e from the metal track. The point magnetic susceptibility meter wa s calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on the ship and i s quality checked every ${\sim}6\mathrm{~h~}$ at the same time as color reflectanc e sensor calibration.  

# SHMG measurements  

# P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity measurements on split-core sections were typically performed once per section using the SHMG (Figure F20) . Measurements were taken at varying section intervals to accommodate lithologic variations, drilling disturbance, fractures, and general core quality. The system uses Panametrics-NDT Microsca n delay line transducers, which transmit at $0.5~\mathrm{MHz}$ . The signal received was recorded, and the peak ( $P.$ -wave arrival) was chosen wit h autopicking software. In some cases, the peak was manually chose n to ensure that a consistent first arrival time was selected. For sections with highly variable core quality, different intervals within  a section were tested to help choose an appropriate position to mak e the measurement. The distance between transducers was measure d with a built-in linear voltage displacement transformer (LDVT).  

Calibration was performed with a series of acrylic cylinders o f differing thicknesses and a known $P$ -wave velocity of $2750\pm20\,\mathrm{m/s}$ . The determined system time delay from calibration was subtracte d from the picked arrival time to give a traveltime of the $P.$ -wav e through the sample. The thickness of the sample (calculated b y LDVT in meters) was divided by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P$ -wave velocity in meters per second.  

# Shear strength  

Shear strength is the resistance to failure of a material unde r shear. Shear stress in unconsolidated materials is resisted only b y the network of solid particles. Shear strength $\left(\uptau_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ can be expresse d as a function of the effective normal stress at failure $(\sigma^{\prime})$ , the effective cohesion $\left(c^{\prime}\right)$ , and friction angle $\left(\varphi^{\prime}\right)$ :  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{\bar{r}}_{\mathrm{f}}=c^{\prime}+\sigma^{\prime}\tan\!\varphi^{\prime},}\end{array}
$$  

where $c^{\prime}$ and $\boldsymbol\upvarphi^{\prime}$ are the shear strength parameters that define a linear relationship between $\tau_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $\boldsymbol\upvarphi^{\prime}$ , according to the Mohr-Coulom b failure criterion.  

Shear strength parameters can be determined by means of multiple laboratory tests. The $c^{\prime}$ and $\boldsymbol\upvarphi^{\prime}$ are relevant for situations i n which field drainage conditions correspond to test conditions. Th e shear strength of a soil under undrained conditions (interstitial water drainage does not occur during failure) is different from that under  drained  conditions  (interstitial  water  drainage  occurs). Undrained shear strength $\left(S_{\mathrm{u}}\right)$ can be expressed in terms of tota l stress in the case of fully saturated materials of low permeabilit y (e.g., clays). The most common strength tests in shipboard laboratories are the vane shear and penetrometer tests, which provide measurements of undrained shear strength (Blum, 1997).  

During Expedition 374, $S_{\mathrm{u}}$ was measured in undisturbed finegrained sediment using the handheld Torvane shear device in working-half cores. Undrained shear strength was determined by inserting a four-bladed vane into the split core and putting it under shea r stress, resulting in shearing of a cylindrical surface by the vane. Thi s procedure provides a measurement of the peak shear strength expressed in kPa units. Measurements were made with the vane rotation axis perpendicular to the split surface. Shear strength wa s measured once in each core when sediments were within the instrument range. Measurements were stopped when they began to caus e excessive disturbance. Shear strength measurements were not conducted for continental shelf Sites U1521 and U1522.  

# MAD measurements  

Discrete samples were collected from the working halves to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, an d porosity. In soft sediment, ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ samples were collected with  a plastic or metal syringe. Generally, three samples were taken in eac h core from the first hole, and sampling continued in deeper interval s of successive holes. In shorter cores, only one or two samples wer e taken. When possible, the samples were taken from Sections 1, 3, 5, and, if present, 7. In lithified sediments, samples were taken adjacent to the cube samples sawed for paleomagnetism measurements.  

Sediment samples were placed in numbered, preweighed ${\sim}16$ mL Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment weighing and drying and dry volume measurements. After wet sample analysis, samples were dried in a convection oven for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Dried samples were then cooled in a desiccator for at least $60\ \mathrm{min}$ before dry mass and volume were measured. The weights of wet an d dry sample masses were determined to a precision of $0.005\ \mathrm{g}$ usin g two Mettler Toledo electronic balances (Figure F21A), with one acting as a reference. A standard weight of similar value to the sampl e was placed on the reference balance to increase accuracy. A computer averaging system was used to compensate for the ship’s motion. The default setting of the balances is 300 measurements ove r ${\sim}1\;\mathrm{min}$ .  

Dry sample volume was determined using a six-celled customconfigured Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacemen t pycnometer (hexapycnometer) (Figure F21B). The precision o f each cell is $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. Volume measurement wa s preceded by three purges of the sample chamber with heliu m warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run for eac h sample. A reference volume (set of two calibration spheres) wa s placed sequentially in one of the chambers to check for instrumen t drift and systematic error. The volumes occupied by the numbere d Wheaton vials were calculated before the expedition by multiplyin g each vial’s weight against the average density of the vial glass. Procedures for determining these physical properties comply with th e American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) designatio n (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). The fundamental relatio n and assumptions for the calculations of all physical property parameters are discussed in Blum (1997). MAD properties reported an d plotted in the Physical properties sections of all site chapters wer e calculated with the MADMax shipboard program.  

# Mass and volume calculation  

Wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ wer e measured in the laboratory. The mass ratio $\left(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ is a computational constant of 0.965 (i.e., $0.965\,\mathrm{g}$ of freshwater per $1\,\mathrm{g}$ of seawater). Sal t precipitated in sediment pores during the drying process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporated wate r $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ in the sample are given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}\;\mathrm{and}}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[s/(1{-}\mathrm{s})],}\end{array}
$$  

where s is the assumed saltwater salinity (0.035) corresponding to  a pore water density $(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ of $1.024\:\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ (from experimental and empirical relations between salinity and density at laboratory conditions; Blum 1997) and a salt density $(\boldsymbol\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ of $2.22\,\mathrm{~g/cm^{3}}$ . Th e corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of pore water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}}),$ mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , mass of salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ , volume o f salt $\left(V_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ , wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , and volume of solids excluding sal t $(V_{\mathrm{solid}})$ are, respectively,  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{r_{m}},\ \ \ }\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\rho_{\mathrm{pw}},\ \ \ }\\ {M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},\ \ \ }\\ {M_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),}\\ {V_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{solit}}/\rho_{\mathrm{solit}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Wet (or total) volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{t}}\right)$ , dry mass $\mathbf{\Gamma}(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volum e $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ were measured in the laboratory. Total mass, including freshwater in the pores, is calculated using a water density of $1\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ by  

$$
M_{\mathrm{t}}=M_{\mathrm{dry}}+\left(V_{\mathrm{t}}-V_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)\times\uprho_{\mathrm{w}}.
$$  

Assuming a pore water density of $1.024\:\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ , the volume of th e pore water is calculated as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=(V_{\mathrm{t}}-V_{\mathrm{dry}})/\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Finally, the mass of the pore water is  

$$
M_{\mathrm{pw}}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}\times\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

# Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as th e ratio of the mass of pore water to the wet sediment (total) mass as  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grai n density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio (VR) are calculated from  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{pdry}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{solid}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\mathrm{VR}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.
$$  

# Geochemistry and microbiology  

The shipboard geochemistry program for Expedition 374 included measurements of headspace gas content (hydrocarbons), interstitial  water  composition,  and  bulk  sediment  geochemica l parameters. Samples for microbiology were collected and fixed fo r shore-based analyses of metagenomics, cell counts, metabolomics, and cultures.  

# Headspace gas geochemistry  

Routine analysis of hydrocarbon gases in sediment cores is par t of the standard IODP shipboard monitoring to ensure safe drillin g operations. The most common method of hydrocarbon monitorin g is headspace analysis (gas obtained from sediment/rock samples). One sediment plug $({\sim}5~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ was collected from each core fro m Hole A at each site for headspace gas analyses immediately after retrieval on deck. Additional samples were collected from other hole s when depths exceeded those previously drilled. Headspace sample s were collected from the top of a section from the middle of the cor e immediately adjacent to the interstitial water sample when possibl e (Figure F23). For soft sediments, plug samples were collected usin g a graduated syringe and extruded into a $21.5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass serum vial with a crimped-seal metal cap and polytetrafluoroethylene septum. For consolidated or lithified samples, chips of material were place d in the vial and sealed. The vial was labeled with the core, section, and interval from which the sample was taken and then placed in a n oven at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ .  

Headspace gas $(5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ was extracted through the septum with  a gas-tight glass syringe and then injected into an Agilent 6890 ga s chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) a t $250^{\circ}C$ to quantify concentrations of methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethylene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propylene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ . A $2.4\mathrm{~m~}\times\,2.0\mathrm{~mm}$ stainless steel column packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep ${}^{\iota}\mathbf{R}^{\prime\prime}$ is installed in the oven. The injector consists of a $^1\!/\!_{16}$ inch Valco unio n with a $7\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ screen connected to a Valco-to-Luer lock syringe adaptor. This injector connects to a 10-port Valco valve that wa s switched pneumatically by a digital valve interface. The injecto r temperature was set at $120^{\circ}C$ . Samples were introduced into the ga s chromatograph through a $0.25~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample loop connected to th e Valco valve. The valve can be switched automatically to back flus h the column. The oven temperature was programmed to start a t $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8.25~\mathrm{min}$ and then increase to $150^{\circ}C$ for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ at a rate o f $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ . Helium was used as the carrier gas. Initial helium flow i n the column was $30~\mathrm{mL/min}$ . Flow was then ramped to $60~\mathrm{mL/min}$ after $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ to accelerate elution of $C_{3}$ and ${C}_{3=}$ . The run time wa s $15\,\mathrm{\min}$ . The gas chromatograph was also equipped with an electronic pressure-control module to control the overall flow into th e gas chromatograph. Data were collected and evaluated using th e Agilent Chemstation software (2001–2006). The chromatographi c response was calibrated against different preanalyzed gas standard s with variable quantities of low–molecular weight hydrocarbon s provided by Scott Specialty Gases (Air Liquide). Concentrations o f hydrocarbon gases are reported in parts per million by volum e (ppmv).  

# Interstitial water chemistry  

Interstitial water samples for shipboard determination of salinity, alkalinity, $\mathsf{p H}$ , anions and cations, and major and trace elements, as well as for shore-based hydrogen sulfide, water isotope $(\delta^{18}\mathrm{O},$ $\delta^{17}\mathrm{O}_{:}$ , and $\delta^{2}\mathrm{H},$ ), and carbon isotope $(\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{DIC}})$ analyses, were obtained by squeezing 5 or $10\ \mathrm{cm}$ whole-round sections cut fro m cores immediately after core retrieval (Figure F23). Whole-roun d samples were typically collected at a frequency of 1 sample per cor e $^{\prime}{<}100\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}\rangle$ ) or every third core $\mathrm{(>}100\mathrm{~m~CSF-A)}$ to the botto m of the hole or until extraction produced $<\!6\;\mathrm{mL}$ of interstitial wate r after $1.5~\mathrm{h}$ of squeezing. Sampling frequency was reduced by hal f when using the HLAPC system or when cutting half cores with rotary coring systems. The exterior of the whole-round sample wa s carefully cleaned with a spatula to remove potential contaminatio n from drilling fluid. For XCB and RCB cores, the intruded drillin g mud between biscuits was also removed to eliminate contaminatio n from drilling fluid. The cleaned sediment was transferred into an  8 cm inner diameter titanium squeezer that was then placed in  a Carver hydraulic press (Manheim and Sayles, 1974) and squeeze d with slowly increasing pressure up to 30,000 force pounds $\left(1.335\right.\times\left.\right.$ $10^{6}~\mathrm{N},$ ). After discarding the initial drops to avoid contamination, the squeezed interstitial water was collected into a $60~\mathrm{mL}$ waterwashed $(18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm})$ high-density polyethylene syringe attached t o the squeezing assembly. If sample volume permitted, the interstitia l water samples were split as outlined in the analytical workflow below. If interstitial water volume was limited (i.e., ${<}20\,\mathrm{~mL~}$ but ${>}6$ mL), it was decided to either omit shore-based samples or shipboard alkalinity/inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses on a case-by-case basis.

The priority list for shipboard analyses and shore-based sample s from interstitial water (from high to low priority) was as follows:  

• Salinity $({\sim}100~\upmu\mathrm{L})$ : determined by optical refractometry immediately after squeezing.   
• Anions and cations $(\sim\!100\,\upmu\mathrm{L};\,\mathrm{Na}^{+},\,\mathrm{K}^{+},\,\mathrm{Ca}^{2+},\,\mathrm{Mg}^{2+},\,\mathrm{Cl}^{-},\,\mathrm{Br}^{-},$ , $S O_{4}{}^{2-})$ : determined by ion chromatography.   
• Silica $(\sim\!400\,\upmu\mathrm{L})$ and ammonia $({\sim}200~\upmu\mathrm{L})$ : determined by spectrophotometry.   
• Major and trace element analyses ( $\mathrm{\sim}2\,\mathrm{mL}$ ; B, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, S, Si, and Sr): determined by ICP-OES; addition of $30\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ concentrated trace metal–clean $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ .   
• Shore-based sample for $\mathrm{\delta^{18}O,\delta^{2}H,\delta^{17}O\left(2\ m L\right.}$ ): no headspace in amber-colored glass crimp-top vial and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ .   
• Shore-based sample for $\delta^{13}C$ and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) $\mathrm{(2\mL)}$ ): no headspace in amber-colored glass crimp-top vial; addition of $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ saturated $\mathrm{HgCl}$ solution (prepoisoned).   
• $\mathsf{p H}$ and alkalinity $\left(\sim\!3\\,\mathrm{mL}\right)$ ): titrated/determined immediately after squeezing.   
• Shore-based hydrogen sulfide $\mathrm{(\sim4~mL)}$ ): addition of $800\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ of zinc acetate.   
• Duplicate (or triplicate) $2~\mathrm{mL}$ samples for shore-based analysis (in case of excess interstitial water) of • $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ , $\delta^{2}\mathrm{H},$ and $\delta^{17}\mathrm{O}$ and • $\delta^{13}C$ and DIC.  

For all above analyses, interstitial water was filtered through a 0.4 5 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ polysulfone disposable filter (Whatman). All shipboard analyse s were carried out in batches.  

# Shipboard analysis  

Interstitial water samples were analyzed on board following th e protocols in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and th e IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

# Alkalinity, pH, and salinity  

Alkalinity and pH were measured using a Metrohm autotitrato r (Model 794 Basic Titrino) equipped with a $\mathsf{p H}$ glass electrode and  a stirrer (Model 728). The pH was obtained from the LabVIEW alkalinity program directly, and alkalinity was measured by titratin g $3\;\mathrm{mL}$ of sample with $0.1\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HCl}$ to reach an endpoint of $\mathsf{p H}=4.2$ . Standardization for both measurements was achieved using the International Association of Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO ) seawater standard, which was analyzed repeatedly during the expedition and reproduced within $1\%$ . Salinity was analyzed using  a Fisher Model S66366 refractometer calibrated using $18~\mathrm{M}\Omega$ millipore water. The known salinity of the IAPSO seawater standard wa s used for data quality control.  

Ion chromatography  

Aliquots of interstitial water were diluted at 1:100 with deionized water for analysis of $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ , $\!\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ , $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ , and $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ using a Metrohm 85 Professional ion chromatograph. The IAPS O seawater standard was used for standardization of measurements. Typical reproducibility was $<\!5\%$ for each ion.  

# Spectrophotometry  

Aliquots of interstitial water samples were diluted with $18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega$ millipore water for analysis of ammonium and dissolved silica usin g an Agilent Cary 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Ammonium analyses were conducted by phenol diazotization and subsequent oxidization by sodium hypochlorite to yield a blue color measure d spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of $640\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\nm}}$ . Ammoniu m chloride $\left(\mathrm{NH_{4}C l}\right)$ was used for calibration and standardization. Reproducibility of ammonium standards was typically better tha n $20\%$ . Dissolved silica concentration was measured by reacting samples with ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate solution acidifie d with hydrochloric acid to form molybdosilicic acid. The comple x was then reduced by ascorbic acid to form molybdenum blue, whic h was measured at a wavelength of $812\;\mathrm{nm}$ . Solutions of sodium silicofluoride $\left(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{SiF}_{6}\right)$ at 360 and $480\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ concentrations were used a s standards with a reproducibility of better than $3\%$ .  

Inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy  

Dissolved major (Ca, K, Mg, and Na) and minor (B, Ba, Fe, Li , Mn, S, Si, and Sr) element concentrations were determined by a n Agilent 5110 ICP-OES instrument with a SPS4 autosampler. Interstitial water samples were diluted 1:10 in $2\%\,\mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ and spiked wit h an internal standard to correct for atomic and ionic interferences. I n detail, $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of spike solution containing 100 ppm Be, In, and S c and $200\ \mathrm{ppm\Sb}$ was added to $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of interstitial water sampl e and $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . For calibration, serial dilutions of th e IAPSO seawater standard $(0\%$ , $1\%$ , $5\%$ , $10\%$ , $25\%$ , $50\%$ , $75\%$ , an d $100\%$ ) were prepared to cover interstitial water concentration s smaller than or equal to normal seawater. Additional calibratio n solutions for major and minor element concentrations exceedin g that of seawater were prepared with $3.5\%\,\mathrm{NaCl}$ as a matrix. Calibration solutions for B, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, P, Si, and $\operatorname{Sr}$ wer e spiked in the same way as interstitial water samples and run as serial dilutions of $0\%$ , $1\%_{:}$ , $5\%$ , $10\%$ , $25\%$ , $50\%$ , $75\%$ , $100\%$ , and $200\%$ .  

During each ICP-OES batch run, a complete set of in-house an d IAPSO standard dilutions were analyzed at the beginning. Furthermore, known solutions of the IAPSO standard were run every 6– 8 samples to monitor instrumental drift and accuracy. The elemental concentrations reported for each sample were average values fro m three replicate integrations for each sample. Reproducibility wa s typically better than $5\%$ for all elements and mostly around $1\%{-3\%}$ .  

All data produced on the Agilent 5110 ICP-OES was collected i n atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) mode and is referred to a s ICP-AES in the LIMS/LORE database. “ICP-OES” is used to refer t o these data in the Expedition 374 Proceedings volume.  

# Comparative analysis of analytical methodologies for interstitial water  

IODP standard shipboard analytical protocols produce multipl e data sets for a number of elements. For example, B, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, S, Si, and Sr were measured by ICP-OES using two o r more wavelengths. Results for each wavelength were analyzed b y evaluating shape and size of intensity peaks as well as interferences. Final chosen wavelengths are given in Table T8.

solved silica was measured by spectrophotometry. Generally, thes e data are in good agreement with the ICP-OES results. Reproducibility between ion chromatography and ICP-OES analyses for K an d Na is typically better than $10\%$ and better than $15\%$ for $\mathrm{Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}$ . Total S (ICP-OES) and $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ (ion chromatography) in the interstitial water samples for all sites were also in very good agreement; reproducibility between the two techniques is typically better tha n $10\%$ . At Sites U1521–U1523, silica and silicon concentrations in interstitial water were measured by spectrophotometry and ICP-OES, respectively. There was good agreement between the two techniques for the majority of analyzed samples (differences are $<\!5\%$ ), with consistently higher silica concentrations in the spectrophotometry analyses. The spectrophotometry method for silica was no t conducted on interstitial water samples from Sites U1524 an d U1525.  

# Sedimentary geochemistry  

Typically, two $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ samples were taken from the workin g halves of split cores following identification of major lithologies i n discussion with sedimentologists for on board bulk sediment analyses. The entire $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample was freeze-dried for ${\sim}12\ \mathrm{h}$ , crushe d using an agate pestle and mortar, and aliquoted for the individua l analyses. Bulk carbon, nitrogen, and calcium carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ content were determined on all samples.  

# Sedimentary inorganic and organic carbon, nitrogen, and carbonate content  

Total carbon and total nitrogen content of sediment sample s were determined with a ThermoElectron Corporation FlashE A 1112 CHNS elemental analyzer equipped with a ThermoElectro n packed column CHNS/NCS gas chromatograph and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Approximately $10{-}15\,\mathrm{~mg}$ of sedimen t was weighed into a tin cup and then combusted at $950^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in a strea m of oxygen. The reaction gases were passed through a reductio n chamber to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and  then separate d by the gas chromatograph before detection by the TCD. All measurements were calibrated to the NIST 2704 Buffalo River Sedimen t standard (soil reference material), which was run every 10 samples.  

Peak areas from the TCD were calculated to determine the total carbon and total nitrogen of the samples.  

Total inorganic carbon (TIC) was determined using a Coulometrics $5015\ \mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Approximately $10~\mathrm{mg}$ of sedimen t was weighed into a glass vial and acidified with $2\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HCl}.$ . The liberated $C O_{2}$ was titrated, and the corresponding change in light transmittance  in  the  coulometric  cell  was  monitored  using   a photodetection cell. The weight percent of $C a C O_{3}$ was calculate d from the inorganic carbon content using the following equation:  

# $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\left(w t\%\right)\times100/12.}$  

Standard $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ $(>99.9\%\;\mathrm{CaCO_{3}};$ Fisher Scientific) was used t o confirm accuracy, and instrument performance was monitored b y repeat analysis of the standard before, during, and after each ru n (target reproducibility is better than $2\%$ ).  

Total organic carbon (TOC) content was calculated by subtracting inorganic carbon derived by coulometry from the total carbo n derived by the CHNS elemental analyzer:  

$$
\mathrm{TOC\left(wt^{0}\!\!\right)=t o t a l\;c a r b o n-T I C\left(w t^{0}\!\!\right)}.
$$  

# Major and minor elemental analysis by ICP-OES  

Major (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, and Ti) and selected mino r (Ba, Sr, and Zr) elements were determined by an Agilent 5110 ICPOES instrument with a SPS4 autosampler. Shipboard ICP-OES instrument analyses of samples followed methods described in principle by Murray et al. (2000). Because this specific instrument had no t been used previously for sediment measurements, a range of reference standards were run first (BCR-2, BHVO-2, G-2, GSP-2, SO-1, LKSD-1, SDO-1, NBS-88b, STSD-2, PACS-3, MESS-4, and HISS-1 ) and compared in combusted and uncombusted form. Results for Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Si, Sr, Ti, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ revealed a loss on ignitio n (LOI) between $0\%$ and $46\%$ . In detail, average LOI values for all listed elements for basalt BCR-2 and BHVO-2 and granodiorit e GSP-2 were ${<}1\%$ . Values for the sediment standards STSTD-2, MESS-4, and PACS-3 and soil standard SO-1 were between $9\%$ an d $15\%$ , and lake sediment standard LKSD-1 and shale standard SDO1 had $30\%{-31\%}$ LOI. The highest reference material LOI $(46\%)$ wa s for the carbonate standard NBS-88b. No combustion was performed on standards G-2 and HISS-1. Results corrected for LO I agreed within $3\%$ for all but one standard (SDO-1; ${\sim}7\%$ ). No combustion was performed on actual samples from Site U1521 (the onl y site for which sediment ICP-OES analyses were performed).  

Approximately $100~\mathrm{mg}$ of ground and homogenized sedimen t sample (or reference material) was weighed $[100\,\pm\,0.5~\mathrm{mg}]$ ) on th e Cahn C-31 microbalance and placed in a vial containing $400~\mathrm{mg}$ o f preweighed lithium metaborate $\mathrm{(LiBO_{2})}$ to achieve a sample flux ratio of 1:4. After homogenization of sample and flux powders, th e mixture was poured into a Pt-Au crucible and $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $0.172\,\mathrm{M}$ LiB r was added to prevent the cooled bead from sticking to the crucible. Samples were fused individually at $1050^{\circ}C$ for $\sim\!\!12$ min in an internal-rotating induction furnace (Bead Sampler NT-2100) and subsequently cooled to form a bead. After cooling, the bead was dissolve d in $50~\mathrm{mL}$ trace metal–grade $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ (dilution factor 1:500) i n acid-washed high-density polypropylene (HDPE) Nalgene widemouth bottles. Solutions were subsequently agitated on a Burrell wrist-action bottle shaker for $1.5\,\mathrm{h}$ . Aliquots $(500\,\upmu\mathrm{L})$ of the filtere d solutions were mixed with $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a spik e solution containing 100 ppm Be, In, and Sc and $200\,\mathrm{ppm}\,\mathrm{Sb}$ .  

# Microbiology  

Microbiology sampling was carried out for shore-based analyse s of metagenomics, cell counting, and metabolomics, as well as fo r fungal and anaerobic microbial culturing work. To support microbiology work, a headspace methane sample was taken in the sam e manner and adjacent to the routine headspace samples for methan e for onshore stable and clumped isotope analysis of methane an d higher hydrocarbons. Sediment for methane isotope work was extruded into $20~\mathrm{mL}$ glass vials prepoisoned with $\mathrm{8~mL~1~M~NaOH}$ solution, immediately crimp-sealed, agitated, and stored upsid e down at $4^{\circ}C$ .  

Two sampling methods were employed for all other microbiological work. Dedicated holes for microbiology and interstitial water sampling were cored at Sites U1523 (Hole U1523B) and U152 4 (Hole U1524B) (see Geochemistry and microbiology in the Sit e U1523 chapter and Geochemistry and microbiology in the Sit e U1524 chapter [McKay et al., 2019d, 2019e]). Sampling consisted o f $10{-}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole rounds taken on the catwalk and placed into steril e Whirl-Pak bags. Isopropanol was used to sterilize the core cutter, spatula, and gloves to minimize contamination. Approximately hal f of the whole rounds was immediately placed in storage at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ fo r onshore analyses of metabolomics and tag amplicon sequencing. The remainder of the whole-round samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ an d subsampled within 12 to $18\,\mathrm{h}$ , operations permitting. Subsamplin g was carried out in a cold room $({\sim}4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ in a laminar flow hood. T o minimize contamination, sterile gloves and spatulas were used t o remove the outer layer of whole-round samples. Four $10~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ syringes were used to extract $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ from one side of each wholeround sample and were preserved in four different ways:  

• One syringe was placed into a Whirl-Pak bag and stored at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for culturing work.   
• One syringe was transferred into a sterile centrifuge tube, covered with RNAlater to saturate sediment for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $4^{\circ}C$ for incubation, and then stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-based metagenomic analyses.   
• One syringe sample was placed in a sterile Whirl-Pak bag that was flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ and closed. The closed Whirl-Pak bag was placed in a silver wine bag with an oxygen scrubber that was flushed with $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ sealed, and then stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shorebased anaerobic microbial analyses.   
• One $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ syringe was extruded into a $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube. The extruded sediment was covered with glycerol to saturate for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $4^{\circ}C$ and then moved to $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-based culturing work.  

The remainder of the whole-round samples were stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ fo r shore-based high-resolution subsampling.  

The second sampling strategy was carried out on the catwalk b y injecting sterile syringes into both sides of freshly cut core section s separated with a sterile spatula (Figure F23). Isopropanol was use d to sterilize the core cutter, spatula, and gloves to minimize contamination. This sampling strategy was primarily used for low-resolution sampling (approximately every third core) during APC corin g at Sites U1523–U1525 and in the uppermost core of Sites U152 1 and U1522. Although RCB coring was performed at Sites U152 1 and U1522, an effort was made to “push” rather than drill in the firs t core to capture the mudline and obtain microbiology samples in thi s uppermost interval with minimal risk of seawater or drilling mu d contamination (see Operations in the Site U1521 chapter and $\mathbf{Op}.$ - erations in the Site U1522 chapter [McKay et al., 2019b, 2019c]). Samples $(15\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ of material were extracted using a $20\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ syring e below the fresh cut in the sediment core. Above the cut, one $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ syringe was filled to $6\,\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ and a second was filled to $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (Figur e F23). All syringes were covered in sterile foil on the catwalk and carried indoors for subsampling as described below. The $20~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ syringe was separated into three samples:  

• $5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was extruded into a sterile $50\,\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube and covered with RNAlater solution. This sample was agitated, inoculated for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $4^{\circ}C,$ and then transferred to $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ storage for shore-based analyses of metagenomics/DNA/polymerase chain reaction. • $5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was placed in a sterile Whirl-Pak bag. The bag was flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ and then placed inside a silver wine bag with an oxygen scrubber. The wine bag was flushed with $\Nu_{2}$ sealed, and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for onshore anaerobic culturing work. • $5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was placed in a Whirl-Pak bag, which was then sealed and stored at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for onshore fungal culturing work.  

The $10~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ syringe with $6~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of sediment was separated int o two samples. First, $1\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was extruded into a $50\,\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tub e and covered with a fixing solution of $2\%$ $(\mathrm{v/v})$ filter-sterilized (0. 2 $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ formaldehyde in $2\%$ (w/v) $\mathtt{N a C l}$ and then stored at $4^{\circ}C$ fo r shore-based cell counting. The remaining $5~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ sample was extruded into a sterile Whirl-Pak bag that was then sealed and store d at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-based metabolomics analyses. Finally, the $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ syringe with $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was placed into a sterile Whirl-Pa k bag that was then sealed and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-based tagamplicon sequencing.  

Throughout the expedition, seawater and drilling mud wer e sampled for contamination quality control.  

# Downhole measurements  

Downhole logs are used to determine physical, chemical, an d structural properties of the formation penetrated by a borehole. Th e data are rapidly collected, continuous with depth, and measured i n situ, and they can be interpreted in terms of the stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, and geochemical composition of the penetrate d formation. Where core recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log dat a may provide the only way to characterize the borehole section.  

Where core recovery is good, log and core data complement on e another and may be interpreted jointly. Downhole logs measure formation properties on a scale intermediate between those obtaine d from laboratory measurements on core samples and geophysical surveys. They are useful in calibrating the interpretation of geophysical survey data (e.g., downhole velocity values) and provide  a necessary link for the integrated understanding of physical properties at all scales. In addition, formation temperature as a function o f depth can be measured using the APCT-3, which allows heat flux t o be estimated. Such estimations are important for assessing the viability of models governing tectonic subsidence regionally.  

# Wireline logging  

During wireline logging operations, logs are recorded with a variety of Schlumberger logging tools combined into several tool strings (Figure F24; Tables T9, T10) that are lowered into the hol e after completion of coring operations. Four tool strings were use d

The FMS gathers resistivity images of the borehole wall and the DS I collects sonic velocities.  

The VSI tool string (for seismic “check shots”) (Table T9) includes the VSI and EDTC-B tools.  

Each tool string contains a telemetry cartridge for communicating through the wireline to the Schlumberger data acquisition system (MAXIS unit) on the drillship. Total gamma radiation is als o measured with each tool string to depth-match between loggin g runs. During Expedition 374, downhole logs were collected at Site s U1521–U1523. All three standard tool strings were run at Sit e U1521. The triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings were reconfigured for logging at Sites U1522 and U1523 because of unstabl e borehole conditions. The radioactive source was left out of th e HLDS, which was run solely for measuring borehole diameter usin g the caliper. The APS, which also includes a radioactive source, wa s not run because of the suboptimal conditions of the borehole tha t might have compromised recovery of the radioactive source. We included the DSI tool on the triple combo (referred to as the modifie d triple combo; Figure F24) because collection of downhole velocit y data was a high priority. After successfully running the modified triple combo at both sites, we completed two additional logging run s at Site U1522 (VSI and FMS without sonic) and one additional logging run at Site U1523 (FMS without sonic) (Figure F24).  

In preparation for logging, the boreholes were flushed of debri s by circulating viscous drilling fluid and then filled with a seawaterbased logging gel (sepiolite mud mixed with seawater and weighte d with barite; approximate density $=10.5\;\mathrm{lb/gal})$ to help stabilize th e borehole walls. The BHA was pulled up to ${\sim}70{-}75\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF to cove r the unstable upper part of the hole; this depth varied by site. Th e tool strings were then lowered downhole on a seven-conducto r wireline cable before being pulled up at constant speed, typicall y $250{-}550\ \mathrm{~m/h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , to provide continuous measurements of severa l properties simultaneously. A wireline heave compensator (WHC ) was used when necessary to minimize the effect of ship’s heave o n the tool position in the borehole (see below). During each loggin g run, incoming data were recorded and monitored in real time on th e MCM MAXIS logging computer. At each site, the drill string wa s raised ${\sim}15\mathrm{~m~}$ as the tool string approached the end of pipe to increase log coverage of the upper portions of the borehole wall.  

# Logged sediment properties and tool measurement principles  

The logged properties and the principles used in the tools t o measure them are briefly described below. More detailed information on individual tools and their geological applications may b e found in Serra (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989, 1994), Ride r (1996), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), and Ellis and Singe r (2007). A complete online list of acronyms for the Schlumberge r tools and measurement curves is at http://www.apps.slb.com/cmd (Table T10).  

# Natural gamma radiation  

The HNGS was used to measure NGR in the formation. Th e HNGS uses two bismuth germanate scintillation detectors and fivewindow spectroscopy to determine concentrations of K (in weigh t percent), Th, and U (both in parts per million) from the characteristic gamma ray energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series, which dominate the natural radiation spectrum. The computation of the elemental abundances uses a least-square s method of extracting U, Th, and K elemental concentrations fro m the spectral measurements. The HNGS filters out gamma ray energies below $500\,\mathrm{keV},$ , eliminating sensitivity to bentonite or KCl in th e drilling mud and improving measurement accuracy. The HNG S also provides a measure of the total gamma ray emission (HSGR ) and uranium-free or computed gamma ray (HCGR), which are bot h measured in American Petroleum Institute units (gAPI). Th e HNGS response is influenced by the borehole diameter; therefore, the HNGS data are corrected for borehole diameter variation s during acquisition.  

An additional gamma ray sensor was housed in the EDTC , which was used primarily to communicate data to the surface. Th e sensor includes a NaI scintillation detector that measures the total natural gamma ray emissions of the formation. It is not a spectral tool (i.e., does not provide U, Th, and K concentrations) but provides total gamma radiation for each pass. The inclusion of th e EDTC in every tool string allowed us to use the gamma ray data fo r precise depth-match processing between logging strings and passe s and for core-log integration.  

# Density and photoelectric factor  

When borehole conditions were suitable, formation density wa s measured with the HLDS. The HLDS contains a cesium $\mathrm{(^{137}C s)}$ gamma ray source $(662\,\mathrm{keV})$ and far and near gamma ray detector s mounted on a shielded skid that is pressed against the borehole wall by a hydraulically activated decentralizing arm. Gamma radiatio n emitted by the source undergo Compton scattering, in whic h gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. The number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detectors is proportional to the density of electrons in the formation, which is in turn relate d to bulk density. Porosity may also be derived from this bulk densit y if the matrix (grain) density is known.  

The HLDS also computes the photoelectric effect (PEF), a measure of the photoelectric absorption of low-energy gamma radiation. Photoelectric absorption of gamma rays occurs when thei r energy falls below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of being repeatedly scattere d by electrons in the formation. PEF is determined by comparing th e counts from the far detector in the high-energy region, where onl y Compton scattering occurs, with those in the low-energy region, where count rates depend on both reactions. Because PEF depend s on the atomic number of the elements in the formation (heavier elements have higher PEF), it also varies according to the chemical composition of the minerals present; therefore, it can be used  t o identify the overall mineral make-up of the formation. For example, the PEF of calcite is $5.08\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , illite is $3.03\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}_{:}$ , quartz is 1.8 1 $\mathrm{\barn/e^{-}}$ , and hematite is $21\,\mathrm{\barn/e^{-}}$ (Serra, 1984; Schlumberger, 1989).  

Good contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential fo r good HLDS logs; poor contact results in underestimation of densit y values. To limit the possibility of losing an environmentally hazardous package during deployment, the HLDS was run without th e $^{137}\!C s$ gamma ray source in Holes U1522A and U1523D. Both th e density correction and caliper measurement of the hole are used t o check the contact quality. In the deeper parts of the hole, the PE F log data should be used with caution, especially in washouts, because Ba in the logging mud swamps the signal despite a correctio n for the influence of mud.  

# Electrical resistivity  

Resistivity is measured to aid in identifying poorly recovere d sections of the hole because different materials have different electrical conductivities. Calcite, silica, and hydrocarbons are electrical insulators, whereas ionic solutions like interstitial water are conductors. Electrical resistivity can therefore be used to evaluate porosit y for a given salinity and resistivity of interstitial water. Clay surfac e conduction also contributes to the resistivity values, but at high porosities this is a relatively minor effect.  

The HRLA tool provides six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation, including the borehole (mud) resistivity  and  five  measurements  of  formation  resistivity  wit h increasing penetration into the formation. The tool sends a focuse d current into the formation and measures the intensity necessary t o maintain a constant drop in voltage across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurements. The array has one centra l (source) electrode and six electrodes above and below it that serv e alternatively as focusing- and returning-current electrodes. By rapidly changing the roles of these electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool i s designed to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the sam e time and tool position to reduce the sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects when crossing sharp beds thinner than the electrode spacing. The design of the HRLA, which eliminates the need for a surfac e reference electrode, improves formation resistivity evaluation compared with traditional dual induction and allows the full range of resistivity to be measured from low (e.g., in high-porosity sediments ) to high (e.g., in basalt). The HRLA needs to be run centralized in th e borehole for optimal results, so knuckle joints were used to centralize the HRLA while allowing the density and porosity tools to maintain good contact with the borehole wall.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

The MSS is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by LDEO tha t measures the ease with which formations are magnetized when subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetization is ultimatel y related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magnetic minerals (principally magnetite) in the formation. These measurements provide one of the best methods fo r investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy and lithology because the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructiv e and because different lithologies often have strongly contrastin g susceptibilities.  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides measurements with ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{cm}$ vertical resolution and ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{cm}$ depth of horizontal investigation. The MSS was run as the lowermost tool in the triple combo an d modified triple combo tool strings and used a specially develope d data translation cartridge to enable the MSS to be run in combination with the Schlumberger tools. The MSS also has an optional single-coil sensor to provide high-resolution measurements $\left({\sim}10\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ , but it was not used during Expedition 374 because it has a larg e bowspring that  requires the MSS to be run higher in the tool strin g and because it is very sensitive to separation from the borehole wall.  

Magnetic susceptibility data are plotted as uncalibrated instrument units. The MSS reading responses are affected by temperatur e and borehole size (higher temperatures lead to higher susceptibilit y measurements). The magnetic susceptibility values were not full y corrected for temperature during Expedition 374; therefore, value s from deeper than several hundred meters were generally not interpretable. When the magnetic susceptibility signal in sediment i s very low, the detection limits of the tool may be reached. For qualit y control and environmental correction, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $z$ -axis acceleration, and low-resolutio n borehole conductivity.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The DSI measures the transit times between sonic transmitter s and an array of eight receivers. It combines replicate measurements, thus providing a direct measurement of sound velocity through formations that are relatively free from the effects of formation damag e and an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989). Along with th e monopole transmitters found on most sonic tools, the DSI also ha s two crossed-dipole transmitters that allow the measurement o f shear wave velocity in addition to compressional wave velocity. Dipole measurements are necessary to measure shear velocities i n slow formations with shear velocity less than the velocity of soun d in the borehole fluid. Such slow formations are typically encountered in deep-ocean drilling.  

# Resistivity images (FMS)  

The FMS provides high-resolution electrical resistivity–base d images of borehole walls. The tool has four orthogonal arms an d pads, each containing 16 button electrodes that are pressed agains t the borehole wall during logging. The electrodes are arranged i n two diagonally offset rows of eight electrodes each (inset image i n Figure F24). A focused current is emitted from the button electrodes into the formation,  and there is a return electrode near th e top of the tool. Resistivity of the formation at the button electrode s is derived from the intensity of current passing through the butto n electrodes.  

Processing of the resistivity measurements offshore at LDE O generates oriented high-resolution images that reveal geologi c structures of the borehole wall. Features such as bedding, stratification, fracturing, slump-related folding, and bioturbation can be resolved (Luthi, 1990; Salimullah and Stow, 1992; Lovell et al., 1998). Because the images are oriented to magnetic north, further analysi s can provide measurement of the dip and direction (azimuth) of planar features in the formation. In addition, when the correspondin g planar features can be identified in the recovered core samples, individual core pieces can be reoriented with respect to true north.  

The maximum extension of the caliper arms is $40.6\ \mathrm{cm}$ (1 6 inches). In holes or sections of holes with a diameter greater tha n this maximum, the pad contact at the end of the caliper arms will b e inconsistent, and the FMS images may appear out of focus and to o conductive. Irregular (rough) borehole walls will also adversely affect the images if contact with the wall is poor. Approximately $30\%$ of a borehole with a diameter of $25~\mathrm{cm}$ is imaged during a singl e pass. The standard procedure is to make two full uphole passes wit h the FMS to maximize the chance of getting full borehole coverag e with the pads.  

# Acceleration and inclinometer  

Three-component acceleration and magnetic field measurements were made with the GPIT during logging. The primary purpose  of  this  tool,  which  incorporates  a  three-componen t accelerometer and a three-component magnetometer, is to determine the acceleration and orientation of the FMS-sonic tool string. This information allows the FMS image to be corrected for irregula r tool motion and to determine the dip and direction (azimuth) o f features in the images. The GPIT has greater nonmagnetic insulation on the FMS-sonic tool string compared with other tool strings, which greatly reduces the effects on its magnetic measurements.  

# Vertical Seismic Imager  

In a vertical seismic profile (VSP) experiment, a borehole VSI i s anchored against the borehole wall at regularly spaced intervals t o record the full waveform of elastic waves generated by a seismi c source positioned just below the sea surface (Figure F25). Thes e check shot measurements relate depth in the hole to traveltime i n seismic-reflection profiles. The VSI used here contains a three-axi s geophone and was anchored against the borehole wall at approximately $20{-}50\ \mathrm{m}$ spacing between stations (depending on borehol e conditions), with 5–10 air gun shots typically taken at each station. The recorded waveforms were stacked, and a one-way traveltim e was determined from the median of the first breaks for each station.

Figure F25. Deployment of the Sercel G guns used with the VSI tool string for Sites U1521 and U1522.  

The seismic sources used were two 250 inch3 Sercel G guns in parallel clusters $^1\textrm{m}$ apart and fired at 2000 psi. The source was positioned on the port side of the JOIDES Resolution at $\mathord{\sim}7\mathrm{-}9$ mbsl wit h a horizontal borehole offset of ${\sim}47~\mathrm{m}$ .  

Precautions were taken to protect marine mammals and divin g birds following the restrictions placed on seismic surveys in Antarctic waters. If there were no such fauna in or approaching the safet y radius $^{940\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ for water depths $>\!1000\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and $1850\;\mathrm{m}$ for wate r depths between 100 and $1000\;\mathrm{m})$ , air gun operations commence d using a ramp-up or “soft start” procedure (gradually increasing th e operational pressure and air gun firing interval) to provide time fo r undetected fauna to respond to the sounds and vacate the area. Once the guns were at full power, the check shot survey proceeded. Observations for relevant wildlife continued during the check sho t survey, and the survey was suspended if marine mammals or divin g birds entered the safety radius.  

# Wireline heave compensator  

During wireline logging operations, the up and down motion o f the ship (heave) causes a similar motion of the downhole loggin g tools. If the amplitude of this motion is large, depth discrepancie s can be introduced into the logging data and the risk of damagin g downhole instruments is increased. A WHC system was designe d to compensate for the vertical motion of the ship and maintain  a steady motion of the logging tools to ensure high-quality loggin g data acquisition (Liu et al., 2013; Iturrino et al., 2013). The WH C uses a vertical accelerometer (motion reference unit [MRU]) positioned under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertical motion of the ship with respect to the seafloor. I t then adjusts the length of the wireline by varying the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes to minimize downhole tool motion. Real-time measurements of uphol e (surface) and downhole acceleration are made simultaneously b y the MRU and the EDTC, respectively. An LDEO-developed software package allows these data to be analyzed and compared in rea l time, displaying the actual motion of the logging tool string and enabling monitoring of the efficiency of the compensator.  

# Logging data flow, data quality, and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real tim e and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. Loggin g measurement depth is determined from the length of the cabl e payed out from the winch on the ship, and this depth scale is referred to as wireline depth below rig floor (WRF) (see “IODP Dept h Scales Terminology” at http://www.iodp.org/ policies-and-guidelines). The seafloor is identified on the HSGR (or EDTC) log by th e abrupt upward reduction in gamma ray count at the water/sedimen t interface (mudline), and the seafloor depth is subtracted to give th e wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF). Discrepancies betwee n DSF and WSF may occur. For drilling depth, discrepancies are primarily due to incomplete heave compensation. In the case of lo g depth, discrepancies between successive runs occur because of incomplete heave compensation, incomplete correction for cabl e stretch, and cable slip.  

Downhole log data were transferred onshore to LDEO for standardized data processing. The main part of the processing is dept h matching to remove depth offsets between different logging runs, which results in a new depth scale, wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF), which is the depth scale used for log dat a plots in the site chapters. Also, corrections are made to certain tool s and logs, documentation for the logs (with an assessment of lo g quality) are prepared, and the data are converted to ASCII forma t for the conventional logs and GIF for the FMS images. Schlumberger GeoQuest’s GeoFrame software package is used for most o f the processing. The data are transferred back to the ship within  a few days of logging and made available (in ASCII and DLIS formats ) to the science party.  

A number of factors can influence log data quality. The main influence is the condition of the borehole wall. Where the borehol e diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts of softe r material or ledges of harder material, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehole wall (i.e., density and porosity ) may be degraded. Deep investigation measurements such as gamm a radiation, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and sonic velocity that do not require contact with the borehole wall are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions. “Bridged” sections, where borehole diameter is significantly below the bit size, will also cause irregular lo g results. The quality of the borehole is improved by minimizing th e circulation of drilling fluid while drilling, flushing the borehole t o remove debris, and logging as soon as possible after drilling an d conditioning are completed.  

# Log-core-seismic integration  

A depth-traveltime relationship must be determined at each sit e to correlate log and core data that are acquired at depth with seismic-reflection profiles that are in two-way traveltime. A calibrate d depth-traveltime relationship allows for correlation of the borehol e stratigraphy with seismic-reflection features (e.g., assigning ages t o prominent seismic reflectors that can then be correlated away fro m the drill site).  

Wireline logging measurements of in situ $P$ -wave velocity (fro m the sonic log) and density usually start at ${\sim}70\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF because th e drill pipe is left in the top of the hole to prevent collapse. As a result, the uppermost ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{m}$ of the borehole lacks downhole data. If downhole logs were not acquired for a site, then core-based physica l properties are the only data that can be used to establish a tie to th e seismic-reflection data. Velocities required to convert core data t o seismic traveltime were determined using $P_{\|}$ -wave caliper data (se e Physical properties). These velocities are used to calculate a depthtraveltime relationship that can be used to display the core with th e seismic-reflection data in the Petrel software package. For site s where downhole sonic logs and VSI data were acquired, a direc t measurement of the depth-traveltime relationship is given by th e first arrival times in the zero-offset VSP (see above). These initia l depth-traveltime results are useful for a preliminary borehole-seismic tie and also serve as the foundation for postcruise analysis (e.g., generation of synthetic seismograms). Correlation of seismic an d core data for the two sites where downhole logging was not conducted is presented in Physical properties in the Site U1524 chapter and Physical properties in the Site U1525 chapter (McKay et al., 2019e, 2019f).  

# In situ temperature measurements  

In situ temperature measurements were made with the APCT- 3 (Heesemann et al., 2006) at two sites (U1524 and U1525; only on e measurement was made at Site U1525). The APCT-3 fits directl y into the coring shoe of the APC system and consists of a batter y pack, data logger, and platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over a $0^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ temperature range. Before entering the borehole, the tool is first stopped at the mudline for $5~\mathrm{min}$ to thermall y equilibrate with bottom water. When the APCT-3 is plunged int o the formation, frictional heating causes an instantaneous temperature rise. This heat gradually dissipates into the surrounding sediment as the temperature at the APCT-3 equilibrates toward th e temperature of the sediment. After the APC penetrates the sediment, it is held in place for ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{min}$ while the APCT-3 records th e temperature of the cutting shoe every $_{1\,s}$ .  

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment is estimated b y applying a heat-conduction model to the temperature decay recor d (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The synthetic thermal decay curv e for the APCT-3 is a function of the geometry and thermal properties of the probe and the sediment (Bullard, $1954;$ Horai and Vo n Herzen, 1985). Equilibrium temperature is estimated by applying  a fitting procedure (Pribnow et al., 2000). However, if the APC doe s not achieve a full stroke or if ship heave pulls the APC up from full penetration, the temperature equilibration curve is disturbed an d temperature determination is less accurate. The nominal accurac y of the APCT-3 temperature measurements is $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

APCT-3 temperature data can be combined with thermal conductivity measurements (see Physical properties) obtained fro m whole-round core sections to obtain heat flow values. Heat flow ca n be calculated according to the Bullard method to be consistent wit h the synthesis of ODP heat flow data by Pribnow et al. (2000).  

APCT-3 temperature measurements and heat flow calculation s for the two sites where downhole logging was not conducted ar e presented in Physical properties in the Site U1524 chapter an d Physical properties in the Site U1525 chapter (McKay et al., 2019e, 2019f).
