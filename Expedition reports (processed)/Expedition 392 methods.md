# 1. Introduction  

The procedures and tools employed in coring operations and in the various shipboard laboratorie s of the R/V JOIDES Resolution are documented here. This information applies only to shipboar d work described in the Expedition Reports section of the Expedition 392 Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods for shore-based analyses of Expedition 39 2 samples and data will be described in separate individual publications. This section describes procedures and equipment used for drilling, coring, core handling, sample registration, computatio n of depth for samples and measurements, and the sequence of shipboard analyses. Subsequent sections describe laboratory procedures and instruments in more detail.  

Unless otherwise noted, all depths in this volume refer to the core depth below seafloor, Method  A (CSF-A), scale, which is equivalent to meters below seafloor (mbsf).  

# 1.1. Operations  

# 1.1.1. Site location and holes  

GPS coordinates (WGS84 coordinate system) from precruise site surveys were used to positio n the vessel at each site. A Knudsen CHIRP 3260 subbottom profiler was used to monitor the seafloor depth on the approach to each site. Once the vessel was positioned at the site, the thruster s were lowered. Dynamic positioning control of the vessel used navigational input from the GPS, weighted by the estimated positional accuracy. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from GPS data collected over a significant portion of the time the hole was occupied.  

Drill sites are numbered according to the series that began with the first site drilled by Gloma r Challenger in 1968. Starting with Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 301, the prefi x “U” designates sites occupied by JOIDES Resolution.  

When multiple holes are drilled at a site, hole locations are typically offset from each other by ${\sim}20$ m unless otherwise noted. A letter suffix distinguishes each hole drilled at the same site. The firs t hole drilled is assigned the site number modified by the suffix “A,” the second hole takes the sit e number and the suffix “B,” and so forth. During Expedition 392, ten holes were drilled at four site s (U1579–U1582).  

# 1.1.2. Coring and drilling strategy  

The primary coring strategy for Expedition 392 was to core single or stratigraphically overlappin g holes through Paleogene and Cretaceous sedimentary sequences to achieve high-resolution paleoceanographic objectives and to core deeper single records with the goal of penetrating deepe r sedimentary and basement sequences. At four of the five primary sites, we planned to use th e advanced piston corer (APC) system and possibly the half-length APC (HLAPC) system in th e upper ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ , followed by the extended core barrel (XCB) system to ${\sim}600\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A or basement. The fifth site, Site U1582, called for a single rotary core barrel (RCB) hole to $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. However, the RCB system was used more than planned (and the APC/XCB system used less tha n planned) due to the consistency of the formation (Figure F1). Site U1579 is the only site with overlapping APC cores in offset holes. At Site U1580, several additional RCB cores were taken in Hol e U1580B to provide an additional copy of a critical interval. Logging was planned at four of the fiv e primary sites, including use of the Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI).  

# 1.1.3. JOIDES Resolution standard coring systems  

The APC and HLAPC coring systems cut soft-sediment cores with minimal coring disturbanc e relative to other International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) coring systems and are typicall y suitable for the upper portion of each hole. After the APC core barrel is lowered through the dril l pipe and lands near the bit, the inside of the drill pipe is pressured up until two shear pins that hol d the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formatio n at high speed and cuts a core with a diameter of $6.2~\mathrm{cm}$ (2.44 inches). The driller can detect  a successful cut, or “full stroke,” from the pressure gauge on the rig floor. The depth limit of the AP C system, often referred to as APC refusal, is indicated in two ways: (1) the piston fails to achieve  a complete stroke (as determined from the pump pressure reading) because the formation is to o hard or (2) excessive force $^{>60,000}$ lb; ${\sim}267\,\mathrm{kN})$ ) is required to pull the core barrel out of the formation. When a full stroke is not achieved, additional attempts are typically made. The assumption is that the barrel penetrated the formation by the length of core recovered (nominal recover y of ${\sim}100\%$ ), so the bit is advanced by that length before cutting the next core. When a full or partia l stroke is achieved but excessive force cannot retrieve the barrel, the core barrel is drilled over, meaning that after the inner core barrel is successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit i s advanced by the length of the APC barrel $(\sim\!9.6\mathrm{~m)}$ . Typically, nonmagnetic core barrels are use d and a downhole orientation tool is deployed, except when refusal appears imminent. Formatio n temperature measurements can be taken with the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3 ) tool, embedded in the APC coring shoe, at specified intervals. These measurements can be used t o obtain temperature gradients and heat flow estimates. Temperature measurements were collecte d using the APCT-3 tool at Sites U1579 and U1581.  

The XCB system is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe that extends below the large rotar y APC/XCB bit. The XCB shoe is able to cut a semi-indurated core with less torque and fluid circulation than the larger main bit, optimizing recovery. The XCB cutting shoe (bit) extends ${\sim}21.65$ cm ahead of the main bit in soft sediment but retracts into the main bit when hard formations ar e encountered. The resulting cores have a nominal diameter of $5.87~\mathrm{cm}$ (2.312 inches), slightly les s than the $6.2\,\mathrm{cm}$ diameter of APC cores. XCB cores are often broken (torqued) into biscuits, whic h are disc-shaped pieces a few to several centimeters long with remolded sediment (including som e drilling slurry) interlayering the discs in a horizontal direction and packing the space between th e discs and the core liner in a vertical direction. This type of drilling disturbance may give th e impression that XCB cores have the same thickness $(6.2\;\mathrm{cm})$ as APC cores. As with XCB coring, RCB coring generally leads to drilling disturbance in similar sedimentary material. Switching fro m coring a hole with the APC/XCB bottom-hole assembly (BHA) to coring a parallel hole with a n RCB BHA requires a pipe trip and adds significant time to the coring operations on site.  

The RCB system is a conventional rotary coring system suitable for lithified rock material. Like th e XCB system, the RCB system cuts a core with a nominal diameter of $5.87~\mathsf{c m}$ . RCB coring wa s performed with the same core liners used routinely with the APC/XCB soft-sediment systems. The BHA is the lowermost part of the drill string and is typically ${\sim}130{-}170\;\mathrm{m}$ long, depending o n the coring system used and total drill string length. A typical APC/XCB BHA consists of a drill bi t (outside diameter $=11\%$ inches), a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modifie d top sub, a modified head sub, a nonmagnetic drill collar (for APC/XCB), a number of $8\%$ inc h $({\sim}20.96~\mathrm{cm)}$ drill collars, a tapered drill collar, 6 joints (two stands) of $5\%$ inch $({\sim}13.97~\mathrm{cm})$ dril l pipe, and a crossover sub to the regular 5 inch drill pipe. A typical RCB BHA consists of a drill bit, a bit sub or mechanical bit release (for logging), a modified head sub, an outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a second modified head sub, a number of $8\%$ inch drill collars, a tapered drill collar,  2 stands of standard $5\%$ inch drill pipe, and a crossover sub.  

Cored intervals may not be contiguous if separated by intervals drilled but not cored. Durin g Expedition 392, with both the APC/XCB and RCB systems, drilling ahead was applied to accelerate penetration because an interval had already been cored in an adjacent hole (Hole $\mathrm{U}1579\mathrm{C}=$ $93.5\;\mathrm{m}$ ; Hole $\mathrm{U1579D}=130.0\:\mathrm{m};$ Hole $\mathrm{U1580B}=40.0\:\mathrm{m};$ Hole $\mathrm{U1581B}=289.0\:\mathrm{m};$ Hole $\mathrm{U}1582\mathrm{B}=$ $36.3\mathrm{~m})$ ). Holes therefore consist of a sequence of cored and drilled intervals, or advancements, which are numbered sequentially from the top of the hole downward. Numbers assigned to physical cores correspond to advancements and may not be consecutive.

# 1.1.4. Drilling disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed by the drilling process and can contain extraneous materia l as a result of the coring and core handling process. In formations with loose granular layers (sand, ash, foraminiferal ooze, chert fragments, shell hash, etc.), drilling activity may allow granula r material from intervals higher in the hole to settle and accumulate in the bottom of the hole. Suc h material could be sampled by the next core; thus, the uppermost $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ of each core must b e assessed for potential fall-in.  

Common coring-induced deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originall y horizontal bedding. Piston action may result in fluidization (flow-in) at the bottom of, or sometimes within, APC cores. Retrieval of unconsolidated (APC) cores from depth to the surface typically results to some degree in elastic rebound, and gas that is in solution at depth may becom e free and drive core segments in the liner apart. When gas content is high, pressure must b e relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. Holes are drilled into the liner, which forces some sediment and gas out of the liner. As noted above, XCB coring typically result s in biscuits mixed with drilling slurry. RCB coring typically homogenizes unlithified core materia l and often fractures lithified core material.  

Drilling disturbances are described in the Lithostratigraphy section of each site chapter and ar e indicated on graphic core summary reports, also referred to as visual core descriptions (VCDs ) (see Core descriptions).  

# 1.1.5. Seawater sampling  

During Expedition 392, samples for phytoplankton and seawater analysis were collected at eac h drill site and during transits outside of the South African Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to asses s coccolithophorid species assemblage composition. Seawater samples $(\sim\!20\,\mathrm{~L~})$ were collecte d approximately every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ at ${\sim}0000$ , 0600, 1200, and $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are provided in local ship time: $\mathrm{UTC}+2\,\mathrm{h})$ using a plastic bucket with a nylon rope over the side of the starboard main deck. Th e sampling depth approximately represents a mixed upper $10\textrm{m}$ of surface water. Upon retrieval, temperature and salinity were measured using a thermometer and a reflectometer, respectively, and then the sample was transferred to a $20\,\mathrm{L}$ plastic carboy. Latitude and longitude coordinate s and the time and date of each collection were recorded (see 392_Plankton_Sampling_Shipboard_- Data.xlsx in SAMPLING in Supplementary material).  

A $3~\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of each seawater sample was initially filtered through an Acrodisc syringe nylo n filter (diameter $=\,25\,\mathrm{\mm}_{\mathrm{_}}$ ; pore size $=\,0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{{m})}$ and then transferred to a $14~\mathrm{mL}$ polypropylen e round-bottom tube with a cap (Falcon). This aliquot was used for routine shipboard analysis o f alkalinity and ${\mathsf{p H}}.$ . An additional $15{-}30~\mathrm{mL}$ split of the seawater sample was sealed in a $60~\mathrm{mL}$ polypropylene round-bottom tube with a cap (Falcon) and stored in a $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer for postcruis e analysis of major anions (sulfate, chloride, and bromide) and nutrients (phosphate, nitrate, an d dissolved silica).  

For each sampling station, 1 or $2\,\mathrm{~L~}$ of seawater was filtered onto two types of microfilter discs: Whatman cellulose nitrate filters (diameter $=47~\mathrm{mm}$ ; pore size $=0.4~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}\rangle$ ) and Whatman Nucleopore polycarbonate track-etched filters (diameter $=47~\mathrm{mm}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ; pore size $=0.4~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}\rangle$ ). A low-pressur e vacuum pump was used for filtration to avoid mechanical breakage of the coccosphere specimens. Salt was removed by washing the filters with ${\sim}3\,\mathrm{mL}$ of deionized water buffered to a $\mathsf{p H}$ of 8.5 wit h ammonium hydroxide. After filtration, the filters were placed individually in $47\;\mathrm{mm}$ plastic Millipore petri dishes and oven-dried at $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Once dry, a portion of cellulosic filter was cut out and mounted on a glass microscope slide usin g Norland optical adhesive Number 61 (refractive index $=1.56)$ ). Preliminary examination of th e sample was performed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with cross-polarized illumination an d phase contrast light at $1000\times$ magnification.  

The shipboard Hitachi TM3000 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used for preliminar y coccosphere identifications and to identify smaller species that could not be identified using ligh t microscopy. For SEM preparation, a portion of each polycarbonate filter was cut out and mounte d onto twelve $10\,\textrm{m m}$ aluminum stubs using double-sided adhesive tape. The stubs were the n sputter-coated with gold-palladium for 1–2 min using a Leitz EM ACE2000 sputter coater.  

# 1.2. Core and section handling  

# 1.2.1. Whole core handling  

All APC, XCB, and RCB cores recovered during Expedition 392 were extracted from the core barrel in plastic liners. In the case of shattered liners, the cores were initially curated into split liner s on the catwalk and then closed using the other half of the liner and taped. All cores were then cu t into ${\le}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections. The exact section length was noted and entered into the database as “create d length” using the Sample Master application. This number was used to calculate recovery. Subsequent processing differed for soft-sediment, lithified, and basement material.  

# 1.2.2. Sediment section handling  

Headspace samples were taken from selected section ends (typically one per core) using a syring e for immediate hydrocarbon analysis as part of the shipboard safety and pollution prevention program. Whole-round samples for interstitial water (IW) analysis also were taken immediately afte r the core was sectioned. Whole-round subsamples of the lowermost part of each core catche r (paleontology [PAL] samples) were taken for biostratigraphic analysis. When catwalk samplin g was complete, liner caps (blue $=$ top, colorless/white $=$ bottom, and yellow $=$ base of a section afte r a whole-round sample was removed) were glued with acetone onto liner sections, and section s were placed in core racks for analysis.  

For sediment cores, the curated length was set equal to the created length and was updated on rar e occasions (e.g., in cases of errors or when section length kept expanding by more than ${\sim}1{-}2\ \mathrm{cm})$ ). Depth in hole calculations are based on the curated section length (see Depth calculations).  

After completion of whole-round section analyses, the sections were split lengthwise from botto m to top into working and archive halves. The softer cores were split with a wire, and harder core s were split with a diamond saw. It is important to be aware that stratigraphically older material ca n be displaced upward on the split face of a section during splitting.  

# 1.2.3. Rock piece handling  

At Sites U1579, U1580, and U1582, we performed hard rock curation, in which individual piece s were separated with dividers and logged separately. Rock pieces were washed and arranged in section half liners. Plastic dividers made from core liner caps were inserted between core pieces t o keep them in place for curation, which typically led to curated section lengths that exceeded created section lengths. As a result, curated core lengths, defined by the sum of curated sectio n lengths, can exceed the length of the cored interval, resulting in recovery rates ${>}100\%$ . Adjacen t core pieces that could be fitted together along fractures were curated as single pieces. These piece s are further labeled with letters to indicate the order within the bin; however, the subpieces are no t recorded in the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database. Core pieces tha t appeared susceptible to crumbling were encased in shrink wrap.  

A splitting line was marked on each piece with a wax pencil so the piece could be split into representative working and archive halves, ideally maximizing the expression of structures on the cu t face of the core in addition to maintaining representative features in both archive and workin g halves. To ensure a consistent protocol for whole-core imaging, the splitting line was drawn so tha t the working half was on the right side of the line with the core upright. The working half of eac h piece was marked with a “W” to the right of the splitting line (Figure F2).  

Once the split line was drawn, the plastic spacers were secured with acetone, creating bins tha t constrained movement of pieces during core transport. Spacers were mounted into the liners wit h the angle brace facing upcore, ensuring that the top of each piece had the same depth as the top o f the curated interval for each bin. The top and bottom offsets of each bin were uploaded to th e LIMS database. Based on the calculated bin lengths, the cumulative length of all bins, includin g spacers, was computed as the curated length of the section. The empty split liner with spacer s glued in was then placed over the split liner containing the pieces, and the two halves were tape d together in a few places for temporary storage until core pieces were dry and equilibrated to laboratory conditions (usually $<\!1\,\mathrm{h}$ after arrival from the catwalk).  

# 1.3. Sample naming  

Sample naming in this volume follows standard IODP procedure. A full sample identifier consist s of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, section half, and offset in centimeters measured from the top of the core section. For example, a sample identification of “392-U1579A-1H-2W, $10{-}12\,\mathrm{cm}$ ,” represents a sample taken from the interva l between 10 and $12\,\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of the working half of Section 2 of Core 1 ${}^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^{\prime\prime}$ designates tha t this core was taken using the APC system) of Hole U1579A during Expedition 392.  

When working with data downloaded from the LIMS database or physical samples that wer e labeled on the ship, three additional sample naming concepts may be encountered: text ID, labe l ID, and printed labels.  

# 1.3.1. Text ID  

Samples taken on JOIDES Resolution are uniquely identified for use by software applications usin g the text ID, which combines two elements, sample type designation (e.g., SHLF for section half ) and a unique sequential number for any sample and sample type, added to the sample type cod e (e.g., SHLF30495837). The text ID is not particularly helpful to most users but is critical fo r machine reading and troubleshooting.  

# 1.3.2. Label ID  

The label ID is used throughout the JOIDES Resolution workflows as a convenient, humanreadable sample identity. However, a label ID is not necessarily unique. The label ID is made up o f two parts: primary sample identifier and sample name.  

# 1.3.2.1. Primary sample identifier  

The primary sample identifier is very similar to the editorial sample name described above, wit h two notable exceptions:  

• Section halves always carry the appropriate identifier (392-U1579B-25X-2-A versus 392- U1579B-25X-2-W for archive and working half, respectively).  

![](images/0c341383246e8df7cbe829d2a48a0c0a5a483c80a1d79ae8940a6bec4080b3f1.jpg)  
Figure F2. Core reference frame.  

• Sample top and bottom offsets, relative to the parent section, are indicated as $^{\prime}35/37^{\prime\prime}$ rather than $^{\ast}35{-}37\;\mathrm{cm}$ .”  

Specific rules were set for printing the offsets at the end of the primary sample identifier:  

• For samples taken out of the hole, core, or section before splitting, top offset/bottom offset is not added to the label ID. This has implications for the common process of taking samples out of the core catcher (CC), which technically is a section (relevant primarily for microbiology and PAL samples).   
• The top offset/bottom offset is always added to the label ID for samples taken out of the section half. The rule is triggered when an update to the sample name, offset, or length occurs.   
• The offsets are always rounded to the nearest centimeter before insertion into the label ID (even though the database stores higher precision positions with offsets reported to millimeter precision).  

# 1.3.2.2. Sample name  

The sample name is a free text parameter for subsamples taken from a primary sample or fro m subsamples thereof. It is always added to the primary sample identifier following a hyphe n (-NAME) and populated from one of the following prioritized user entries in the Sample Maste r application:  

1. Entering a sample type (-TYPE) is mandatory (same sample type code used as part of the text ID). By default, -NAME $=$ -TYPE (examples include SHLF, CUBE, CYL, PWDR, and so on).   
2. If the user selects a test code (-TEST), the test code replaces the sample type and -NAME $=$ -TEST. The test code indicates the purpose of taking the sample but does not guarantee that the test was actually completed on the sample (examples include PAL, TSB, ICP, PMAG, MAD, and so on).   
3. If the user selects a requester code (-REQ), it replaces -TYPE or -TEST and $\begin{array}{r}{-\mathrm{NAME}=-\mathrm{REQ}.}\end{array}$ . The requester code represents the name of the requester of the sample who will conduct postcruise analysis.   
4. If the user types any kind of value (-VALUE) in the -NAME field, perhaps to add critical sample information for postcruise handling, the value replaces -TYPE, -TEST, or -REQ and -NAME $=$ -VALUE (examples include SYL-80deg, DAL-40mT, and so on).  

In summary, and given the examples above, the same subsample may have the following label IDs:  

• 392-U1579B-25X-2-W 35/37-CYL • 392-U1579B-25X-2-W 35/37-PMAG • 392-U1579B-25X-2-W 35/37-DAL • 392-U1579B-25X-2-W 35/37-DAL-40mT  

When subsamples are taken out of subsamples, the -NAME of the first subsample becomes part o f the parent sample ID, and another -NAME is added to that parent sample label ID:  

• Primary_sample_ID-NAME • Primary_sample_ID-NAME-NAME  

For example, a thin section billet (sample type $\ R={\mathrm{TSB}}$ ) taken from the working half at $40{-}42~\mathrm{cm}$ offset from the section top might result in a label ID of 392-U1579B-25X-4-W 40/42-TSB. Afte r the thin section was prepared $[\sim48\mathrm{~h~}$ later), a subsample of the billet might receive an additiona l designation of TS05, which would be the fifth thin section made during the expedition. A resultin g thin section label ID might therefore be 392-U1579B-25X-4-W 40/42-TSB-TS_5.  

# 1.4. Depth calculations  

Sample and measurement depth calculations were based on the methods described in IOD P Depth Scales Terminology v.2 at https://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines/142-iodpdepth-scales-terminology-april-2011/file (Table T1). Due to the definition of multiple dept h scale types and their distinction in nomenclature, a nominal depth value at two different dept h scale types (and even two different depth scales of the same type) generally does not refer t o exactly the same stratigraphic interval in a hole (Figure F3). The SI unit for all depth scales i s meters.  

Depths of cored intervals were measured from the drill floor based on the length of drill pip e deployed beneath the rig floor and referred to as drilling depth below rig floor (DRF); this is traditionally referred to with custom units of meters below rig floor (mbrf). The depth of each core d interval, measured on the DRF scale, can be referenced to the seafloor by subtracting the seafloo r depth measurement (on the DRF scale) from the cored interval (on the DRF scale). This seafloorreferenced depth of the cored interval is referred to as the drilling depth below seafloor (DSF ) depth scale, and traditionally uses a custom unit designation of mbsf. In the case of APC coring, the seafloor depth was the length of pipe deployed minus the length of the mudline core recovered. In the case of RCB coring, the seafloor depth was adopted from a previous hole drilled at th e site or by tagging the seafloor.  

Depths of samples and measurements in each core were computed based on a set of rules tha t result in a depth scale type referred to as CSF-A. The two fundamental rules are that (1) the to p depth of a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of its cored interval (top $\mathrm{DSF}=\mathrm{top}\,\mathrm{CSF-A})$ regardless of type of material recovered or drilling disturbance observed and (2) the recovere d material is a contiguous stratigraphic representation even when core segments are separated b y voids when recovered, the core is shorter than the cored interval, or it is unknown how muc h material is missing between core pieces. When voids were present in the core on the catwalk, the y were closed by pushing core segments together whenever possible. The length of missing cor e should be considered a depth uncertainty when analyzing data associated with core material.

DRF $=$ drilling depth below rig floor, $\mathsf{D S F=}$ drilling depth below seafloor, $\mathsf{C S F=}$ core depth below seafloor (Method A or B), $\mathsf{C C S F=}$ core composite depth below seafloor, WRF $=$ wireline lo g depth below rig floor, $\mathsf{W S F=}$ wireline log depth below seafloor, ${\mathsf{W S S F}}=$ wireline log speed-corrected depth below seafloor, WMSF $=$ wireline log matched depth below seafloor.  

When core sections were given their curated lengths, they were also given a top and a botto m depth based on the core top depth and the section length. Depths of samples and measurement s on the CSF-A scale were calculated by adding the offset of the sample (or measurement from th e top of its section) to the top depth of the section.  

Per IODP policy established after the introduction of the IODP Depth Scales Terminology v.2, sample and measurement depths on the CSF-A depth scale type can be referred to with the custom unit mbsf, just like depths on the DSF scale type. In this volume, we use the CSF-A depth scal e type. For example, a soft-sediment core from less than a few hundred meters below seafloor ofte n expands upon recovery (typically by a few percent to as much as $15\%$ ), and the length of the recovered core exceeds that of the cored interval. Therefore, a stratigraphic interval in a particular hol e may not have the same depth on the DSF and CSF-A scales. When recovery in a core exceed s $100\%$ , the CSF-A depth of a sample taken from the bottom of the core will be deeper than that of  a sample from the top of the subsequent core (i.e., some data associated with the two cores overla p on the CSF-A scale). To overcome the overlap problem, core intervals can be placed on the cor e depth below seafloor, Method B (CSF-B), depth scale. The Method B approach scales the recovered core length back into the interval cored, from ${>}100\%$ to exactly $100\%$ recovery. If cores ha d ${<}100\%$ recovery to begin with, they are not scaled. When downloading data using the JOIDE S Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) LIMS Reports pages (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/LORE), depths for samples and measurements are by default presented on both CSF-A and CSF-B scales. The CSF-B depth scale can be useful for data analysis and presentations at sites with a single hole.  

A core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) scale can be constructed to mitigate inadequacie s of the CSF-A scale for scientific analysis and data presentation. The most common application i s the construction of a CCSF scale from multiple holes drilled at a site using depth shifting of correlative features across holes. This method not only eliminates the CSF-A core overlap problem bu t also allows splicing of core intervals such that gaps in core recovery, which are inevitable in corin g a single hole, are essentially eliminated and a continuous stratigraphic representation is established. This depth scale type was used at Sites U1579 and U1580 during Expedition 392.  

A CCSF scale and stratigraphic splice are accomplished by downloading correlation data from th e expedition (LIMS) database using the Correlation Downloader application, correlating stratigraphic features across holes using Correlator or any other application, depth-shifting cores t o create an affine table with an offset for each core relative to the CSF-A scale, and creating a splic e interval table that defines which core intervals from the participating holes make up the stratigraphic splice. Affine and splice interval tables can be uploaded to the LIMS database, where internal computations create a CCSF depth scale. The CCSF depth can then be added to all subsequen t data downloads from the LIMS database, and data can be downloaded for a splice.  

# 1.5. Shipboard core analysis  

Whole-round core sections were immediately run through the Natural Gamma Radiation Logge r (NGRL). For some holes, whole-round core sections were scanned using the X-ray Multisenso r Logger (XMSL). After thermally equilibrating for at least $4\;\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , core sections were run through th e Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL), which measures $P$ -wave velocity, density, and magnetic susceptibility (MS). For unconsolidated cores, thermal conductivity measurements were als o taken before the cores were split lengthwise into working and archive halves. The working half o f each core was sampled for shipboard analysis (routinely for paleomagnetism and physical properties and more irregularly for geochemistry and biostratigraphy). $P$ -wave velocity was also measured on working halves and cubic samples using the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG). The archive half of each core was passed through the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL ) for measurement of point MS (MSP) and color reflectance, and a puck probe was used to measur e thermal conductivity of consolidated sediments. The archive halves were described macroscopically and microscopically in smear slides. Finally, the archive halves were run through the cryogenic magnetometer. Both halves of the core sections were then put into labeled plastic tubes tha t were sealed and transferred to cold storage space aboard the ship.  

A total of 4167 samples (which includes PAL and IW splits) were taken for shipboard analysis. A t the end of Expedition 392, all core sections and thin sections were shipped to the Gulf Coas t Repository for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning in June–August 2022, followed by a shorebased sampling party in August 2022. The sections and samples will then be transferred to an d permanently stored in the Kochi Core Center.

# 2. Lithostratigraphy  

The lithology of material recovered during Expedition 392 was primarily determined using macroscopic core descriptions of split cores and observations from smear slides and thin sections. Descriptions were based primarily on examination of the archive halves of each core, supplemented by the working halves where appropriate. When necessary, digital core imaging, colo r reflectance spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF ) spectrometry, physical properties (see Physical properties), and MS analyses were used to provide complementary description criteria. Percent $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ data (see Geochemistry) were also use d to refine sediment descriptions. The methods employed during this expedition were modifie d from those used during IODP Expeditions 369 (Huber et al., 2019a) and 371 (Sutherland et al., 2019). The DESClogik application was used to record and upload descriptive data into the LIM S database. Spreadsheet templates were set up in DESClogik and customized for Expedition 39 2 before the first core was recovered. These templates were used to generate VCDs and recor d microscopic data from smear slides and thin sections. These additional data sets were used t o describe the textures and relative abundances of biogenic and nonbiogenic components. The sampling positions of each smear slide and thin section were recorded using Sample Master softwar e and are indicated on the VCDs.  

The general workflow for description of Expedition 392 cores was as follows: (1) cores were spli t and the archive halves were prepared for sediment description (e.g., excess moisture removed an d the split-core surface smoothed using a clean glass slide), (2) section halves were imaged and “barrel sheet” templates were generated, (3) smear slides were prepared using toothpick samples o r scrapings from the split-core surface, (4) each section half was described (macroscopic) and th e information handwritten onto the barrel sheet, (5) barrel sheet data were transcribed int o DESClogik, and (6) electronic VCDs were generated.  

The standard method of splitting cores into working and archive halves using a piano wire or a sa w can disturb the split-core surface and obscure fine details of the lithology and sedimentary structures. Where necessary, core archive halves were scraped and smoothed with a glass or metal slid e parallel to bedding for improved results during digital imaging and to prevent cross-stratigraphi c contamination during sedimentological analyses. Imaging lithified clay-rich intervals is commonl y distorted by moisture along cracks and bedding planes, which can take a great deal of time to dr y in ambient laboratory conditions. To obtain high-quality images, the cores were air dried using  a Super Quality Imager of Section Halves (SQUISH), which consists of a series of fans positione d along the track of the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL). Prepared section halves were scanne d using the SHIL and the SHMSL (see Physical properties). Sediment/rock color was determine d qualitatively for each core using a Munsell soil color chart and quantitatively for the entire sectio n using the SHMSL (reflectance) and SHIL (red-green-blue color space [RGB]) to track downcor e changes in lithology. A general characterization of color was also noted for each section. Becaus e sediment color may change during drying and subsequent oxidization during storage, color wa s described shortly after the cores were split.  

# 2.1. Section-half images  

The SHIL uses three pairs of advanced illumination high-current-focused LED line lights to illuminate features of the core. A linescan camera made by JAI was used to image the split-core surface at a resolution of 20 lines/mm to create a high-resolution TIFF file, and two low-resolutio n JPEG files (cropped and uncropped) were subsequently created. The full-size TIFF images are 50 8 ppi (dpi). The camera height was adjusted so that the size of each pixel was $50\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . However, th e actual core width per pixel varied because of differences in surface height of each section half. Uncropped SHIL images include a grayscale and ruler. Foam placeholders were positioned withi n the cores to mark the locations of samples removed from the core before imaging (e.g., IW an d paleontology) and to mark the positions of voids. Section-half depths were automatically include d with images and stored in the LIMS database.  

# 2.2. Macroscopic core descriptions  

Macroscopic core descriptions were first made on handwritten description forms (barrel sheets ) for each section and then entered into the Macroscopic template core description tabs in DESClogik. Standard sedimentological observations of lithology, sedimentary structures, color, bioturbation, and accessories were documented, as well as specific comments, when necessary. Al l handwritten sheets were digitally preserved as PDF files (see HAND_DESC in Supplementar y material).  

# 2.3. Visual core descriptions  

VCDs are simplified graphical representations for each core within sediments/sedimentary roc k intervals (Figure F4) and for each section within igneous and basement rock intervals (see Igneous petrology). VCDs were generated after core descriptions were entered into the DESClogi k software and uploaded to the LIMS database. For stratigraphic intervals where both sedimentar y and igneous rocks were encountered, two VCDs were produced to optimize the descriptive outpu t (Figures F4, F5).  

# 2.3.1. Core summary  

Graphic lithology is displayed on each VCD with physical descriptions for each core, whic h include information on grain size, Munsell color, sedimentary structures, lithologic accessories, bioturbation intensity, and type and intensity of drilling disturbances. Depth and length of cor e sections are indicated along the left margin in the CSF-A, depth scale. Graphic patterns and symbols used in the VCDs are shown in Figure F4. In addition, VCDs display a preliminary subepoc h age estimate, the types and locations of shipboard samples taken, and relevant physical propertie s data for that site (natural gamma radiation [NGR], color reflectance $[\mathbf{L}^{*},\mathbf{a}^{*},\mathbf{b}^{*}]$ , and MS).  

# 2.3.2. Graphic lithology  

Lithologies of the recovered core intervals are represented on the VCDs by graphic patterns in th e Graphic lithology column using the patterns illustrated in Figure F4. All sedimentary beds thicke r than $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ are represented in the Graphic lithology column on each VCD. Major modifiers (prefixes) of a principal lithology are shown by an adjoining pattern on the left side of the graphic lithology column, and minor modifiers (suffixes) are shown on the right side of the column. Relative abundances of lithologic constituents reported in this way are useful for general characterization of the sediment but do not constitute precise quantitative observations.

# 2.3.3. Sedimentary structures  

The locations and types of stratification and sedimentary structures visible on the prepared surfaces of the split cores are shown in the Sedimentary structures and lithologic accessories colum n of the VCD. Symbols in this column indicate lithologic accessories such as shell fragments an d pyrite nodules, as well as other sedimentary features such as laminations (Figure F4). Terminolog y outlined in Stow (2005) was used to categorize stratification thickness (Table T2). Descriptiv e terms for bed boundaries, such as sharp, erosive, gradational, and bioturbated, were noted i n  

![](images/12cfc15019c64039fca830cd0c816a4b2e97561ed328d4c25c562a69228609f8.jpg)

DESClogik. Soft-sediment deformation was noted by a symbol on the VCD and specific types o f soft-sediment deformation and microfaulting were noted in core summaries on the top of th e VCD (e.g., convolute bedding, load casts, scours, and flame structures).  

# 2.3.4. Deformation structures  

Deformation of the core clearly identified as not related to drilling disturbance was recorded an d included in the Sedimentary structures and lithologic accessories column using the symbols i n Figure F4. These structures include synsedimentary deformation, such as dewatering structures, slump folds, or faults, and postdepositional features, such as fractures, faults, and folds. Althoug h rarely resolvable, sense of deformation (e.g., reverse or normal; dextral versus sinistral strike-sli p displacement) was recorded in the comment section of DESClogik. Interval thickness wa s recorded from the uppermost to the lowermost extension of the described feature on the archiv e section half.  

The descriptive terminology used for deformation structures in hard and soft rocks follows Ramsay and Huber (1987), and terminology used for sediments follows Maltman (1994). For microstructures, we applied the terminology of Passchier and Trouw (1996).  

Deformation structures were oriented in the core reference frame used for paleomagnetic analyses, but they were not oriented with respect to geographic ordinates (Figure F2). Formatio n MicroScanner (FMS) data collected during downhole logging in Hole U1580A are available fo r core reorientation.  

# 2.3.5. Drilling disturbance  

Cores can be significantly disturbed by the drilling process and contain extraneous material as  a result of coring and core handling processes. In formations with loose granular layers (sand, ash, foraminiferal ooze, chert, shell fragments, etc.), granular material from intervals higher in the hol e may settle and accumulate in the bottom of the hole as a result of drilling activity and be sample d with the next core. Therefore, the uppermost $10{-}50\;\mathrm{cm}$ of each core were examined critically fo r potential fall-in material.  

Common piston coring-induced deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal bedding (uparching). Piston action may also result in fluidization (flow-in) at th e bottom of APC cores. Retrieval of unconsolidated (APC) cores from depth to the surface typicall y results to some degree in elastic rebound, and gas that is in solution at depth may become free an d drive core segments in the liner apart. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved fo r safety reasons before the cores are cut into sections. Holes are drilled into the liner, which force s some sediment and gas out of the liner. XCB coring typically results in core material broke n (torqued) into biscuits, which are disc-shaped pieces a few to several centimeters long surrounde d by fluidized sediment mixed with drilling slurry. RCB coring typically homogenizes unlithifie d core material and often fractures lithified core material.  

Drilling disturbance type and intensity was recorded in the Disturbance column of the VCD usin g the symbols shown in Figure F4. The type of drilling disturbance was described for soft and fir m sediments using the terms described in Table T3. The intensity of drilling disturbance (slight, moderate, severe, and destroyed) is described using a color scale, and the criteria for these parameters are listed in Table T4.

# 2.3.8. Lithostratigraphic unit and age  

Lithostratigraphic units were defined at each site where successions of conformable units wit h similar sedimentary characteristics or phases were recognized. These successions were given consecutive downhole Roman numbers (Lithostratigraphic Units I, II, etc.) and are shown in th e Lithostratigraphic unit column of the VCD (Figure F4). Where necessary, lithostratigraphic subunits were also defined (Lithostratigraphic Subunits Ia, Ib, etc.). Sediment age was based on th e shipboard biostratigraphy (see Micropaleontology) and magnetostratigraphy (see Paleomagnetism) and is listed in the Age column to subepoch level.  

# 2.3.9. Shipboard samples  

Positions of shipboard samples used for microscopic descriptions (i.e., smear slides and thin sections; SED), mineralogical analyses (XRD), shipboard chemical analyses (IW, HS, ICP, and CARB; see Geochemistry), micropaleontological (PAL, NANNO, FORAM, PALY, and DIAT; see Micropaleontology), paleomagnetic (see Paleomagnetism) and physical properties analyses (MAD; se e Physical properties) are indicated with an annotation adjacent to the graphic lithology column o n each VCD (Figure F4).  

# 2.4. Sediment classification  

Recovered sediments are primarily composed of biogenic, siliciclastic, and volcaniclastic components and were described using a classification scheme derived from IODP Expeditions 36 9 (Huber et al., 2019a), 371 (Sutherland et al., 2019), and 349 (Li et al., 2015), Deep Sea Drillin g Project (DSDP) Leg 26 (Luyendyk and Davies, 1974), Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 18 2 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2000), and the classification of Stow (2005). The biogenic componen t includes open-marine calcareous and siliceous microfossils (e.g., foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils, diatoms, radiolarians, and sponge spicules) and macrofossils (e.g., shell and coral fragments). The siliciclastic component consists of mineral and rock fragments derived from physica l weathering of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. The relative proportion of these tw o components are used to define the major classes of sediment in this scheme (Figure F6). For th e purposes of classification, diagenetic metal oxides and silica minerals are included in the siliciclastic component.  

![](images/9ad63981b1acc21fc99099ecd89659bbcd204223a086997e9d29b75be231ac01.jpg)  
Figure F6. Sediment and sedimentary rock naming scheme used during Expedition 392. Adapted from Expedition 369.  

Lithologic naming conventions used during Expedition 392 follow the general guidelines of th e ODP sediment classification scheme (Mazzullo et al., 1988), but a separate “mixed sediment” category was not distinguished. As a result, biogenic sediments are those that contain ${>}50\%$ biogeni c grains and ${<}50\%$ siliciclastic grains, whereas siliciclastic sediments are those that contain ${>}50\%$ siliciclastic grains and $c50\%$ biogenic grains (Figure F6). We follow the naming schemes of Shepard (1954), Pettijohn and Siever (1987), Folk (1962), Dunham (1962), and Stow (2005) for th e detailed classification of sediments and sedimentary rocks. Sediment grain size divisions for bot h biogenic and siliciclastic components are based on the major textural categories of Wentwort h (1922) (Figure F7). These categories are defined using the relative proportions of sand-, silt-, an d clay-sized particles (Figure F8, modified after Shepard, 1954), which can be difficult (e.g., silty cla y versus sandy clay) without quantitative grain size measurements. The term “clay” is only used t o describe particle size (not mineralogy) and is applied to both clay minerals and all other nonbiogenic grains ${<}4\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ .  

Lithologic names assigned to these sediments consist of a principal name with major (prefix) an d minor (suffix) modifiers that are based on composition and degree of lithification and/or textur e as determined from visual description of the cores and from smear slide observations (Figure F6).  

# 2.5. Naming of siliciclastic and biogenic sediments  

# 2.5.1. Principal names  

For sediments with ${>}90\%$ biogenic components, the name applied indicates the most commo n type of biogenic grains. For example, sediment composed of ${>}90\%$ calcareous nannofossils i s called nannofossil ooze/chalk, and sediment composed of $50\%$ foraminifera and $45\%$ calcareou s nannofossils is called nannofossil-rich foraminiferal ooze/chalk. For sediment with ${>}90\%$ siliciclastic grains, the principal name is based on the textural characteristics of all sediment particle s (both siliciclastic and biogenic).  

For a sediment sample that contains a significant mixture of siliciclastic and biogenic component s $(10\%{-}90\%$ of both siliciclastic and biogenic components), the principal name is determined by th e more abundant component (Figures F6, F8, F9). If the siliciclastic component is more abundan t (i.e., ${>}50\%$ siliciclastic components), the principal name is based on the textural characteristic s such as silty clay or sandy silt. If the biogenic component is more abundant (i.e., ${<}50\%$ siliciclasti c components), the principal name is based on the predominant biogenic component, such as calcareous ooze.

# 2.5.2. Major and minor modifiers  

If a biogenic (or siliciclastic/volcaniclastic) group makes up $10\%{-}50\%$ of the sediment and thi s group is not included as part of the principal name, major (prefix) and/or minor (suffix) modifier s are generally used. When a microfossil group (e.g., diatoms, nannofossils, or foraminifera) comprises $25\%{-}50\%$ of the sediment (corresponding to “abundant” in smear slide description), a majo r modifier consisting of the component name hyphenated with “-rich” (e.g., diatom-rich clay) i s used. The principal name is followed by a minor modifier (e.g., with diatoms), which is the mos t abundant component among those making up $10\%{-}20\%$ of the sediment (corresponding to “common” in smear slide description). If the minor component is biogenic, then the modifier describe s the group of biogenic grains that exceeds the $10\%$ abundance threshold (e.g., silty clay with radiolarians). If the minor component is siliciclastic, the minor modifier is based on the texture of th e siliciclastic fraction (e.g., diatom ooze with clay).

If the primary lithology for an interval of core has a major or minor modifier, that modifier is indicated in the Lithology column of the VCD by overlaying the pattern of the modifier on the lef t (major modifiers) or right (minor modifiers) of the Lithology column.  

# 2.5.3. Primary lithologies by lithification grades  

Each primary lithology indicates a composition and a degree of lithification (e.g., ooze versu s chalk). The following terms describe lithification that varies depending on the dominant composition, and the degree of lithification is specified on the VCD:  

• Sediment samples that are composed predominantly of calcareous, pelagic organisms (e.g., calcareous nannofossils and foraminifera): the lithification terms “ooze” and “chalk” reflect whether the sediment sample can be deformed with a finger (ooze) or scratched easily by a fingernail (chalk) or are too hard to be scratched easily by a fingernail (limestone).   
• Siliceous sediment that is too hard to be scratched with a glass slide: the term “silicified limestone” is used.   
• Sediment samples that are composed predominantly of siliciclastic material: if the sediment can be deformed easily with a finger, no lithification term is added and the sediment is named for the dominant grain size (i.e., sand, silt, or clay). For more consolidated material, the lithification suffix “-stone” is appended to the dominant size classification (e.g., claystone), except for gravel-sized sediment, when the terms “conglomerate” or “breccia” are used depending on whether the clasts are rounded or angular, respectively.  

# 2.5.4. Classification of limestones  

The principal names of well-lithified neritic carbonate sediments were assigned based on the classification by Dunham (1962) and Embry and Klovan (1971) (Figure F10). Following the terminology used for DSDP Site 258 (Luyendyk and Davies, 1974), the term “silicified limestone” was use d for samples characterized by fine-grained calcareous biogenic sediments that were partially o r fully cemented or replaced by silica. Silicified intervals and nodules with grains too fine to distinguish without magnification were described as chert.  

# 2.6. Microscopic description  

For unlithified sediments, at least one smear slide was made from the archive half of each core t o determine the lithology. For well-cemented sediments, thin sections were made following standard procedures. Additional samples were collected from intervals of interest (e.g., lamination s and sedimentary contacts). For smear slides, a small amount of sediment was taken with a woode n toothpick and put on a $2.5\:\mathrm{cm}\times7.5\:\mathrm{cm}$ glass slide. The sediment sample was homogenized with  a drop of deionized water and evenly spread across the slide to create a very thin (about $<50\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ uniform layer of sediment grains for qualitative estimation of relative abundance. The disperse d sample was dried on a hot plate. A drop of Norland optical adhesive No. 61 was added as a mounting medium to a coverslip, which was carefully placed on the dried sample to minimize air bubble s from being trapped in the adhesive. The optical adhesive was then cured in an ultraviolet light box.

Figure F10. Dunham limestone classification scheme.  

Smear slides were examined with a transmitted light petrographic microscope equipped wit h a standard eyepiece micrometer. The texture of siliciclastic grains (relative abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains) and the proportions and presence of biogenic and mineral component s were visually estimated and recorded in DESClogik. The mineralogy of clay-sized grains could no t be determined from smear slides. The abundance of all components was described using semiqualitative categories (Table T6) that correspond to the categories used in our sediment classification scheme. For example, $>\!50\%\;=$ “dominant” in smear slide abundance and determines th e principal lithology, and $10\%{-}25\%=$ “common” and is indicated by a minor modifier in our classification scheme. Note that smear slide analyses tend to underestimate the amount of sand-sized an d larger grains because these grains are difficult to incorporate into the preparation.  

# 2.7. X-ray diffraction analyses  

Samples were prepared for XRD analysis from selected intervals to identify the main minera l phases in bulk samples. For most of the samples, XRD analysis was performed on bulk sediment. In preparation for bulk mineralogy analysis, samples were freeze-dried and then ground using a n agate mortar and pestle. However, a few samples were also prepared for XRD analysis of the cla y mineral fraction. For these preparations, carbonate was removed by placing ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{g}$ of sample in a 5 0 mL centrifuge tube with $10\%$ acetic acid, mixing it, and then letting it sit overnight. Acidified samples were centrifuged for $15\;\mathrm{min}$ at $1500\;\mathrm{rpm}$ , and then the acetic acid was decanted. To wash th e samples, $25\;\mathrm{mL}$ of distilled water was added to the tube, the sample was centrifuged, and the wate r was decanted. This washing procedure was repeated four times to remove both the acid and salt s from the sample. After decanting the final wash, $25~\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\%$ borax solution was added to th e sample. The sample was then placed in a dismembrator to suspend the clays and then centrifuge d for $4\;\mathrm{min}$ at $750~\mathrm{rpm}$ to settle the ${>}2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ particles. The supernatant liquid containing clays in suspension ( $<\!2\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction) was transferred into a clean centrifuge tube and centrifuged for $15\,\mathrm{min}$ a t $1500\,\mathrm{rpm}$ to separate from the borax solution, which was then decanted. The sample was rinsed b y adding $25~\mathrm{mL}$ of distilled water, centrifuged, and then decanted. The washing procedure wa s repeated three times to remove all of the borax solution from the sample. The clays that remaine d in suspension were removed from the top ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ of the centrifuge tube and pipetted onto thre e amorphous quartz sample discs. The sample discs were then left to air dry in a desiccator for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . After drying, one disc was solvated with ethylene glycol for ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{h}$ at $65\mathrm{^\circC}$ and one was heated in  a furnace for $1\mathrm{-}2\ h$ at $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . All three discs were then analyzed to determine the presence o f expandable clays. Prepared samples were top-mounted onto a sample holder and analyzed using  a Bruker D4 Endeavor diffractometer mounted with a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtered $C\mathrm{uK}\alpha$ radiation. The standard locked coupled scan settings are described in Table T7.  

Shipboard bulk XRD results yielded only qualitative information for the presence of the mos t common mineral components. Diffractograms of bulk samples were processed (e.g., baselin e removal) with the software package DIFFRAC.EVA by Bruker, which allowed peak characterization and mineral identification. Detailed clay XRD, which is a semiquantitative analysis that provides percent abundances of major clay mineral groups, was based on maximum peak intensit y and area under the peak preferentially from the glycolated samples. Overall, the shipboard XR D results were interpreted qualitatively based on relative occurrences and abundances of the mos t common clay mineralogical components because the samples were not calibrated with a know n amount of mineral standard.

The results were then compared to expected dspacing values for minerals in the DIFFRAC.EVA software using aluminum oxide as a standard t o monitor data quality. Digital files with the diffraction patterns are available from the LIMS database.  

# 2.8. X-ray fluorescence analyses  

An Olympus Delta handheld pXRF spectrometer was used to conduct rapid reconnaissance (qualitative) analysis of element compositions on the split surfaces of the archive halves. We primaril y utilized the Geochemistry correction protocol in the Geochemistry and soil submenu, which analyzes for elements in three energy ranges $(\mathrm{low}=\mathrm{Al})$ , Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cr, P, S, and Mg; main $=$ Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Rb, Zr, Zn, and others; high $=\operatorname{Sr}$ , Rb, Zr, Ba, La, and Ce). In general, the highenergy elements did not provide reliable results, but the main and low-range groupings yielde d results that were sufficiently precise when concentrations were above instrument detection limits.  

# 3. Igneous petrology  

# 3.1. Physical characteristics of volcanic units  

The procedures for core description outlined here are essentially similar to those develope d during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 324 and 330 and the very recent IOD P Expedition 391 (Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 330 Scientists, 2012; Sager et al., 2023). Boundaries of lithologic units were defined by either visual identification of actual lithologic contacts or by inference of the position of such contacts using observed changes in volcani c characteristics and/or volcaniclastic features. This was followed by general description of th e lithology, lithologic variation, and characteristic igneous textures and vesicle distributions. Thes e macroscopic observations were combined with those from detailed petrographic microscopy o f the key igneous units. When possible and appropriate, these observations were complemented b y thin section examination and bulk rock chemical analyses of representative samples using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (see Geochemistry; see als o Geochemistry in the Site U1579 and Site U1580 chapters [Bohaty et al., 2023a, 2023b] for result s and data tables). For a preliminary assessment, the pXRF spectrometer was also used to measur e chemical elements on the split core surface of certain (fine-grained) intervals. These measurements, however, were only conducted qualitatively, and no external rock standard calibration s were performed (and thus no quantitative data are reported). All observations and data wer e recorded in the LIMS database.  

# 3.1.1. Background  

Effusive basaltic volcanism in both the subaerial and submarine environment produces a range o f common features associated with the development and inflation of flow lobes of varying sizes, pillow lavas, pahoehoe or rubbly flow surfaces, and, where lava interacts directly with seawater, hyaloclastites and breccias. Submarine eruptions are dominated by stacks of budding and anastomosing pahoehoe-like extrusions, which result in piles of rounded or tubular masses (Batiza an d White, 2000), the most readily recognized of which is the pillow basalt, often referred to as pillo w lava. However, large, massive inflation units several meters thick and more laterally extensiv e extrusions have also been observed resulting in sheet-like morphologies (e.g., Lonsdale and Spiess, 1980; Mitchell et al., 2008).  

# 3.1.2. Submarine volcanism and intrusions  

Submarine lavas are important because they represent the most abundant surficial igneous roc k on the surface of the Earth, forming by far the greater proportion of the ocean floors. Eruptiv e styles are largely controlled by effusion rate and are sensitive to local topography and slope ont o which the lava eruption takes place (e.g., Gregg and Fink, 1995; Mitchell et al., 2008, and reference s therein). Basaltic magma is typically erupted at relatively high temperatures and characteristicall y is fluid (low viscosity), allowing the relatively high gas content to be released effectively during lav a emplacement. These gases may leave traces as vesicle layers and pipes, which are often characteristic for submarine basaltic eruptions. However, due to increasing hydrostatic pressure wit h increasing depth of seafloor, the degree of vesiculation decreases in deeper water eruptions (Dixo n et al., 1995; Wallace, 1998).  

# 3.1.2.1. Pillow lavas  

Pillow lavas are subaqueous extrusions resulting from individual budding, inflation, and separation of lava “pods” from point sources along the advancing lava front. They can accumulate in  a variety of styles depending upon effusion rate, number of point sources, and internal plumbin g architectures within the growing volcanic edifice. However, pillow lavas typically consist of discrete subrounded units of relatively small size (diameter $={\sim}0.2$ to ${<}1.0\ \mathrm{m}\mathrm{,}$ , and characteristically, their exteriors are entirely bounded by glassy rinds as a result of rapid cooling; their interiors typically display internally radiating vesicle and joint patterns. In drill cores, pillow lavas therefore ca n be recognized by curved chilled margins oblique to the vertical axis of the pillow core, radial fractures that emanate from the massive core, or outer surfaces coated with glass. At water depth s deeper than $3\;\mathrm{km}$ , the hydrostatic pressure exceeds the critical pressure of water, effectively preventing steam explosions. Accordingly, pillow basalt formed in the upper $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ of the water column often consists of moderately to highly vesicular lava, whereas pillow basalts formed in muc h deeper water can usually be distinguished from shallower water examples by a significantly lowe r vesicularity $(5\%$ volume) and often by the presence of pelagic rather than siliciclastic marine sediment preserved between the pillows. A very close morphological similarity exists between pillo w lava formed under water and pahoehoe lava formed on land, although the latter typically lack o r else have only a relatively thin glassy rind (i.e., glassy surface selvage).  

# 3.1.2.2. Massive or sheet-like flows  

Massive or sheet-like flows are thick (as thick as several meters or more), laterally extensive unit s forming sheet-like, internally massive basalt flows (van Andel and Ballard, 1979). In dimensio n and internal features, they can resemble those of larger subaerially erupted flows. These types o f flows may be fed by lava tubes and develop by internal inflation and/or marginal budding. The y often have texturally uniform massive cores as thick as several meters with grain sizes increasin g toward the flow center. They are often characterized by sparse vesicle layering or vertical vesicl e pipes containing late-stage melt segregation material. Glassy margins are thin and usually not preserved during coring. Massive or sheet-like flows may be a response to particularly high effusio n rates and/or local slope and other controlling topographic conditions. These unit types have bee n termed “sheet flow” in previous IODP reports, although this term implies a significant degree o f lateral extension, which cannot be readily determined from core alone. Therefore, if recovere d units are significantly thicker than the normal dimensions expected for pillow lava or lobate flow s $({\sim}0.2–1\;\mathrm{m})$ , we employ the nongenetic term “massive lava unit.”  

# 3.1.2.3. Intrusive sheets  

Intrusive sheets include both dikes and sills. They are tabular bodies that are usually distinguishe d from lava flows by having relatively planar contacts and quenched margins on both their uppe r and lower contacts. Dikes are further distinguished by contacts that crosscut primary depositiona l layering. Intrusive sheets typically have fewer vesicles, are significantly coarser grained in thei r interiors than lavas, and may have granular or doleritic textures (subophitic to ophitic or hypidiomorphic granular textures, seriate grain size distribution). Intrusive units can interact with th e sediments they intrude into, “baking” the sediments near the contacts during high temperature– low pressure contact metamorphism. This can be a particularly distinguishing feature that whe n seen in sediments at the upper contact of igneous units is a likely indication of their intrusiv e nature. In practice, however, it can be difficult to distinguish intrusive sheets from massive lav a flows (see further discussion in Igneous petrology in the Site U1579 and Site U1580 chapter s [Bohaty et al., 2023a, 2023b]).  

# 3.1.3. Lava-sediment interaction and volcaniclastic deposits  

# 3.1.3.1. Lava-sediment interactions  

Lava-sediment interactions include features involving mixing or mingling of molten or plastic lav a with sediment and soft-sediment deformation features where lava injects or intrudes into a substrate. In some instances, there is a lack of bedding or lamination in sediments adjacent to pillo w lavas or the materials surrounding lava injections. A likely explanation is fluidization of the finegrained sediment, which is attributable to flash heating and vaporization of sediment pore wate r during emplacement of the pillow lava (Kokelaar, 1982). Such momentary fluidization causes sediment reconstitution, localized transport, and redistribution and, hence, the destruction of an y inherent bedding structures. The term “peperite” describes a volcanic-sediment facies that form s when submarine basaltic lava flows interact with unconsolidated sediment (Skilling et al., 2002). The mingling of basaltic lavas and wet sediments produces distinct volcanic textures (entrainment, baking, chilling, etc.) as well as physical and chemical fragmentation and alteration throug h steam-rock interaction during flash heating of the water. Common features include quenched lav a flow margins of basaltic clasts surrounded by sediment and basaltic clasts with a variety of fragment morphologies including fluidal (e.g., where fragments remained plastic enough to defor m after deposition) or jigsaw fit (e.g., where fragments crack apart in situ). Palagonite (devitrifie d glass) is a typical alteration product and is commonly associated with peperite volcanic facie s where small fragments of lava have reacted with steam. The occurrence of peperites is taken a s evidence that the sedimentation and the volcanism existed contemporaneously.  

# 3.1.3.2. Volcaniclastic deposits  

Volcaniclastic deposits include a range of materials from rubbly, in situ volcanic debris to resedimented materials such as volcanic sands or tuffs. Expedition 392 volcaniclastic sediments contai n aspects of sedimentology and igneous petrology but in most cases were composed of predominantly sedimentary volcaniclastic deposits. Where there were alternating igneous and volcaniclastic intervals, the igneous intervals are presented on the igneous VCDs with gaps where there wer e sedimentary volcaniclastics, and vice versa on the sedimentary VCDs, where igneous interval s were left out. It is often not possible to distinguish between pyroclastic and epiclastic deposits i n ancient volcaniclastic deposits retrieved by coring. During Expedition 392, however, no significan t intervals of volcaniclastic material were encountered. For a thin $\left(30\thinspace\mathrm{cm}\right)$ interval of coarse-graine d and poorly sorted volcaniclastic sediment recovered between pillow lavas in Hole U1582B, w e applied the term “hyaloclastic breccia” (angular clasts) and used lithologic or structural modifier s for further description. When ${>}50\%$ of the volcaniclastics were composed of glass or devitrifie d glass, the term “hyaloclastite” was used. This means “glass-fragment rock” and includes all glass y fragmental debris formed by eruptions in which water has been involved. Hyaloclastite productio n may include shallow-water phreatomagmatic eruptions and volcaniclastic materials associate d with the advancement of submarine lavas at greater water depths (Clague et al., 2009). Phreatomagmatic conditions can result in the fragmentation of gas bubbles inflated by steam, producin g thick layers of glass shards. In particular, pillow lavas may contain an extensive matrix of intrapillow hyaloclastite, and hyaloclastite pillow breccias may grade into pillow lava flows as the proportion of pillows increases. The glassy ash portion of hyaloclastite pillow breccias typically consist s  

# of flat glass shards spalled off expanding pillows with keystone-shaped fragments derived from th e pillow rims.  

In addition, the occurrence of palagonite is common in hyaloclastites given the ubiquity of glass i n these deposits. Palagonite is an alteration product of volcanic glass because it interacts with seawater and is commonly found either partially or fully replacing volcanic glass in hyaloclastites or i n the margins of pillow basalts. Palagonite often appears as yellow, orange, or red waxy rinds and ca n be highly angular.  

# 3.2. Definition of lithologic units and volcanic successions  

Our primary aim was to design an observational framework that permitted logging and recordin g of key data and that avoided nomenclature or terminologies that connote particular styles of basaltic volcanism. Most lava type classifications are based on field observations, which consider bot h the lateral and vertical variations of eruptive units and their stacking relationships. Such refine d classifications are neither realistic nor justifiable from core observation alone and can onl y become achievable through integration of multiple data streams alongside the recorded core lo g data (e.g., petrography, downhole logging data, geochemical and paleomagnetic results, etc.). Lithofacies associations provide one such avenue of nongenetic description and have been successfully applied to a range of large igneous province (LIP) types (e.g., Jerram and Widdowson, 2005; White et al., 2009; Greene et al., 2010). Accordingly, we have employed the term “lithostratigraphic unit” to describe successions of similar volcanic facies types such as pillow lava stacks, packages of sills or sheet flows, or hyaloclastic successions. Such overarching units may often b e petrogenetically or volcanically related within a single eruptive event. However, in the case o f basaltic successions, these types of volcanic and petrogenetic relationships often only becom e apparent later, through examination of additional petrographic, geochemical, or downhole loggin g data. In most instances, only smaller volcanic (cooling) unit divisions can be identified in cor e material, so these are necessarily the basic unit of description.  

Therefore, to aid efficient core description and enable the later collation of the observed volcani c elements into volcanically meaningful successions, we adopted a simple two-fold numerical hierarchy. We identified the smaller features, or igneous units, based on criteria that included the presence of lava contacts, chilled margins or identifiable flow tops, vesicle distributions, and th e occurrence of intercalated volcaniclastic or sedimentary horizons. The igneous units were identified during core description and given consecutive downhole Arabic numbering (Igneous Units 1, 2, 3, etc.) irrespective of whether they are pillow, massive flow types, or sills (a nongenetic cataloging system). A quick assessment of geochemical similarity and variation using pXRF (see below ) can further help to distinguish different lithologic units when their distinction is not apparent otherwise. In addition, igneous subunits were sometimes used when changes in texture in a singl e igneous unit were significant enough but did not represent a separate cooling unit. These subunit s (which may or may not recur within a single unit) were given lowercase letters preceded by th e main igneous unit number in which they were found (Igneous Subunits 1a, 1b, 1c, etc.).  

The term lithostratigraphic unit is then applied where successions of consecutive cooling or inflation of units of similar or shared evolutionary characteristics can be identified. In effect, thes e stratigraphic units combine similar types of eruptive products and provide a first step toward considering the volcanic stratigraphy in terms of packages of genetically related lithologic feature s and, ultimately, the evolving volcanism. These packages are given consecutive downhole Roma n numbering (Lithostratigraphic Units III, IV, V, etc.) and follow on consecutively from the overlyin g sedimentary units (e.g., Lithostratigraphic Units I and II). During Expedition 392, alternations o f igneous successions and sedimentary rocks were encountered in two holes (Holes U1579D an d U1580A), and in accordance with the practice of sedimentary unit division (see Lithostratigraphy), each of these transitions was considered as a new lithostratigraphic unit (and assigned a ne w Roman number). For minor sedimentary intervals associated with the pillow lavas stack in Hole s U1582A and U1582B (interpillow sediments), we have deviated from this rule.  

Within an entirely igneous succession, the term lithostratigraphic unit should not be considered a s synonymous with an individual eruptive event but rather as a method of dividing core int o elements or sections displaying broadly similar volcanic characteristics (which could still have  a common age/geochemical composition).  

The most unequivocal evidence for dividing core into smaller igneous units is the presence o f flow-to-flow contacts; unfortunately, these are rarely preserved in low-recovery sections. Alternatively, the presence of glassy material or finer grained chill zones can also provide a useful prox y for determining the presence, or estimating the position of, unit boundaries. However, the interpretation of grain size changes in core can be ambiguous. The changes in vesiculation that occu r through inflation or cooling units of all sizes are of particular use in sections of poor core recovery. To identify and estimate the position of lithologic unit boundaries using this method, we paid special attention to vesiculation characteristics by measuring, estimating, and otherwise recordin g (1) the percentage volume of vesicles, (2) the average size range, and (3) the sphericity. The volum e fraction of vesicles in the unit or section under consideration, together with modal sphericity o f the vesicle populations, were estimated using appropriate comparison charts similar to those use d by the sedimentology laboratory group and derived from the Wentworth (1922) classificatio n scheme. It proved impractical to measure the minimum size because these are often below th e limit of visual resolution.  

Lithologic descriptions followed accepted conventions. Porphyritic basaltic rocks were name d according to major phenocryst type, but only in those instances where the total abundance of phenocrysts was ${>}1\%$ ; aphyric rocks were not assigned any mineralogical modifier and instea d retained a textural description (e.g., aphyric basalt). The term “phenocryst” was used for any crystal that was significantly (typically $5\times$ ) larger than the average size of the groundmass crystals, larger than $1~\mathrm{mm}$ , and euhedral or subhedral in shape. The phenocryst abundance descriptor s were further modified by including the names of phenocryst phases in order of decreasin g abundance. For example, an olivine-plagioclase phyric basalt may contain $10\%$ olivine and $4\%$ plagioclase phenocrysts.  

# 3.3. Core and thin section descriptions  

The first step in describing the recovered core was identification of unit boundaries based o n lithology changes, color, grain size, the presence of volcaniclastic or sedimentary intercalations, volcanological features (e.g., presence of contacts and chilled margins), vesicle distribution patterns, changes in primary mineralogy (occurrence and abundance of plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, and oxide minerals), and alteration. Unit boundaries of volcanic rocks were chosen to reflec t different volcanic cooling or volcaniclastic units (see Definition of lithologic units and volcani c successions). In some cases, limited recovery required interpolation for positioning of uni t boundaries.  

# 3.4. Macroscopic visual core description  

We used IODP’s descriptive data capture application DESClogik to document each section o f igneous rock cores. To provide consistency in approach, the procedure and templates that w e designed closely follow the methods for core descriptions from previous volcanic basement expeditions including Expeditions 324 and 330 and the recent Expedition 391.  

VCDs were generated to summarize each section of the igneous rock cores (Figure F5). The VC D components, from left to right, include the depth in meters using the CSF-A depth scale; a scal e for core section length of $0{-}150\,\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , or as appropriate, the sample piece number; a scanned digita l image of the core archive half; an orientation column (with upward pointing arrow indicating th e occurrence of oriented pieces); the position of shipboard samples; the igneous unit number; symbolized structural information; a line chart displaying the recorded percent vesicularity; a stacke d line chart displaying phenocryst content percentage; a line chart displaying variation in the crysta l size of modal groundmass and the presence of glass (g) or altered glass (ag); a graphical patter n indicating alteration intensity; MS data; and color reflectance data.  

Additionally, the VCD contains written descriptions to accompany the schematic representatio n of each igneous unit for the specific core section. These include the following information:  

• Expedition; site and hole; core, type, and section number (e.g., 392-U1579D-62R Section 3); and the depth of the top of the core section measured using the CSF-A depth scale.   
• Igneous unit number and the piece number(s) belonging to this unit in this section.   
• Lithology: rock description and name. Rock descriptions were based on the examination of hand specimens using eye, hand lens, and binocular microscope observations.   
• Volcanic description: based on the type or part of unit (pillow lava, massive flow, etc.). Units were identified using, for example, the presence of glassy margins, groundmass grain size variations, and vesicle-rich bands.   
• Texture: whether the rock was aphyric $1\%$ phenocrysts), sparsely phyric $(1\%-5\%$ phenocrysts), moderately phyric $(5\%{-}10\%$ phenocrysts), or highly phyric $;{>}10\%$ phenocrysts).   
• Descriptive modal color based on dry rock surfaces.   
• Phenocryst type(s) and abundance in percent based on minerals identifiable by eye, hand lens, or binocular microscope.   
• Groundmass grain size categories: aphanitic (glassy to microcrystalline) $(<\!0.25\;\mathrm{mm})$ , fine grained $(0.25{-}0.5\;\mathrm{mm})$ ), medium grained $(0.5{-}1\;\mathrm{mm})$ , coarse grained $(1{-}2\;\mathrm{mm})$ , and very coarse grained $(>2\;\mathrm{mm})$ . The presence of fresh/altered glass is indicated by the letters $\mathbf{\ddot{g}}^{\prime\prime}/\mathbf{^{\prime}a g},$ .”   
• Vesicles: nonvesicular $(0\%{-}1\%)$ , sparsely vesicular $(<\!5\%)$ , moderately vesicular $(5\%{-}20\%)$ , and highly vesicular $(>\!20\%)$ . Any other defining characteristics (e.g., shape and sphericity, changes in vesicle sizes [i.e., fining- or coarsening upward], or other arrangement patterns) are noted as well.   
• Upper and lower unit contact relations and boundaries: based on the physical changes observed in the retrieved core material (i.e., presence of chilled margins, changes in vesicularity, alteration, and so on), and information regarding their position within the section. “Not recovered” is entered where there is no direct contact recovered (e.g., if igneous contact is otherwise inferred using proxy observations such as a chilled margin or changes in vesicularity).   
• Alteration: based on percent of alteration products by volume and categorized as follows: unaltered $(<\!2\%)$ , slight $(2\%{-}10\%)$ , moderate $(10\%{-}40\%)$ , high $(40\%{-}80\%)$ , and very high to complete $(80\%{-}100\%)$ alteration. Includes comments regarding degree and type of vesicle infilling.   
• Comment: included as appropriate  

# 3.5. Microscopic visual core description  

Thin section analyses of selected intervals sampled from the cores were used to complement an d refine macroscopic core observations. Typically, at least one thin section was examined and logge d per defined lithostratigraphic unit. Additional thin sections from individual igneous units wer e taken as needed. Thin section reports were created to summarize the most significant informatio n for each thin section, which was extracted with a program from the extensive observation workbooks in DESClogik and exported as a single-page PDF (Figure F11). JRSO personnel created th e report definition in the report builder custom tool, updated the definition with input from scientists during the expedition, and generated batches of PDF reports upon request using the repor t writer tool. As far as practically possible, the same terminology and nomenclature hierarch y employed for the visual core compositional descriptions was also used for the thin section descriptions. The textural terms used are those defined by MacKenzie et al. (1982). Phenocryst an d groundmass assemblages and their modal percentages, sizes and shapes, and vesicles/alteratio n phases were determined, and textural descriptions were identified.  

# 3.6. X-ray fluorescence analyses  

An Olympus Delta handheld pXRF was used to conduct rapid (qualitative) reconnaissance analysis of igneous rock compositions (on the archive-half split surfaces; see above). In addition, all roc k powders prepared for ICP-AES analysis were also measured using pXRF. All measurements wer e conducted with the instruments’ Geochemistry correction protocol in the Geochemistry mod e (see Geochemistry) and recorded in the LIMS database. Quantitative measurements, however, were conducted using ICP-AES, and the results are reported and displayed in the respective sit e chapters.

# 4. Micropaleontology  

Calcareous nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifera, marine diatoms, and organicwalled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) and miospores provided preliminary shipboard biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental information for the sediments recovered during Expedition 392. Biostratigraphic age assignments were primarily based on analyses of calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifera, diatoms, and dinocysts. Microfossil samples were collected from mos t core catcher sections, and additional samples were occasionally taken both from section ends o n the catwalk and split working-half sections to refine age estimates and to initially constrain critica l time intervals.  

Biostratigraphic zonation schemes for the microfossil groups analyzed in shipboard work are presented individually in the representative sections below and integrated in Figure F12. Age assignments are based on the 2020 Geologic Time Scale (GTS2020) of Gradstein et al. (2020) (Tables T8, T9, T10, T11). Biohorizons taken from other sources have been calibrated to GTS2020. Unles s otherwise noted, biohorizon depths reported in the site chapter datum tables are given as the midpoint between the two samples bounding the biohorizon.  

Data for each microfossil group are presented in the form of taxonomic distribution charts tha t record occurrences for samples examined from each hole. Relative abundance and preservatio n data were entered through the DESClogik application into the LIMS database for all identifie d microfossil taxa and paleontological data gathered during shipboard investigations. Shipboar d biostratigraphic studies focused primarily on identifying biohorizons in the cores and are biase d toward reporting age-diagnostic species. Reported events include the top (T; last appearanc e datum) or base (B; first appearance datum) of a taxon’s stratigraphic range, occasionally modifie d to identify the top common (Tc) or base common (Bc) occurrence within a taxon’s range if it i s more reliable for correlation and biostratigraphy. Additional biohorizons include crossovers i n abundance (X) and acme events for taxa (base acme [Ba], top acme [Ta]). Tables in each site chapter present the depth and age (with error/uncertainty for both, if available) of important biohorizons used to construct age-depth models. Biostratigraphic information is integrated with th e magnetic polarity stratigraphy, if available, to produce an age model for each site that is presente d in Chronostratigraphy. These age models are based on preliminary shipboard data and will b e updated with postcruise research.

# 4.1. Calcareous nannofossils  

# 4.1.1. Calcareous nannofossil taxonomy and biostratigraphy  

We primarily referred to the nannofossil taxonomy of Bown (1998, 2005) and Perch-Nielse n (1985a, 1985b) as compiled in the online Nannotax3 database (Young et al., 2022). The nannofossi l biohorizons used for biostratigraphic classification are given in Table T8, together with the zona l scheme of Martini (1971) (zonal code numbers NP and NN). Additional biohorizons from th e Paleogene and Neogene/Quaternary biozonation schemes of Agnini et al. (2014) (zonal code numbers CNP, CNE, and CNO) and Backman et al. (2012) (zonal code numbers CNM and CNPL) ar e also included, although they focus predominantly on mid- to low-latitude calcareous nannofossi l assemblages. The compilation of Raffi et al. (2006) was also partially used to provide additiona l information on the reliability, definition, and timing of Quaternary bioevents. For the Mesozoic, the zonation of Sissingh (1977) (CC code) was used, as modified by Perch-Nielsen (1985b). However, many marker taxa are either absent or have different first or last appearance datums in Uppe r Cretaceous sediments of the high southern latitudes; this is particularly true for the upper Campanian and Maastrichtian (e.g., Wise, 1988; Pospichal and Wise, 1990; Crux, 1991; Watkins, 1992; Huber et al., 2019b; Watkins and Guerra, 2020; Petrizzo et al., 2022). Thus, ages derived from low - and middle-latitude sections, such as those included in Gradstein et al. (2020), may not be valid. Watkins et al. (1996) and do Monte Guerra et al. (2016) built on earlier studies to develop zonations for the Late Cretaceous southern high latitudes, although due to a paucity of magnetostratigraphic records, the zones and datums are not well dated. Here, we report Gradstein et al. (2020 ) ages for Cretaceous events when possible with the caveat that they generally represent Tethya n ages. This composite zonation scheme provides a general framework for calcareous nannofossi l biostratigraphic classification (Figure F12).

Several biohorizons approximate critical events and chronostratigraphic boundaries as follows:  

• Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary $(2.588\;\mathrm{Ma})$ : recognized between biohorizon top Discoaster tamalis $(2.76\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and biohorizon top Discoaster surculus $(2.53\,\mathrm{Ma})$ . • Miocene/Pliocene boundary $\left(5.33\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ : identified between biohorizon base Ceratolithus acutus $\mathrm{^{5.36}\,M a)}$ and biohorizon top Orthorhabdus rugosus $\mathbf{\dot{\omega}}=\mathbf{\dot{\omega}}$ Triquetrorhabdulus rugosus; $5.23\,\mathrm{{Ma}}_{\mathrm{{}}}^{\mathrm{{}}}$ ). • Oligocene/Miocene boundary $(23.04\,\mathrm{Ma})$ : recognized between biohorizon top Sphenolithus delphix (23.11 Ma) and biohorizon base Sphenolithus belemnos $(22.90\,\mathrm{Ma})$ . • Eocene/Oligocene boundary $(33.90\,\mathrm{Ma})$ : falls between biohorizon top Discoaster saipanensis $(34.44\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and biohorizon base common Clausicoccus subdistichus $\left(33.88\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . • Paleocene/Eocene boundary $(56.00\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM): recognized between biohorizon top Fasciculithus richardii group (base of Zone CNE1; 56.00 Ma) and biohorizon base Rhomboaster spp. (including Rhomboaster bramlettei; 56.00 Ma).  

• Cretaceous/Paleogene $(\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{Pg})$ boundary $(66.04\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ): recognized by biohorizon top Cretaceous nannoflora (top of Zone NC23, base of Zone NP1) together with biohorizon base Biantholithus sparsus (base of Zone NP1) and acme of calcispheres.   
• Campanian/Maastrichtian boundary $(72.17\,\mathrm{Ma})$ : approximated by biohorizon top Monomarginatus quaternarius $(72.10\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .   
• Santonian/Campanian boundary $(83.65\;\mathrm{Ma})$ : approximated by biohorizon top Eprolithus floralis $(84.00\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .   
• Coniacian/Santonian boundary $(85.70\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ): approximated by biohorizon top Lithastrinus septenarius $(85.30\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .   
• Turonian/Coniacian boundary $(89.83\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ): recognized between biohorizon base Marthasterites furcatus $(89.86\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and biohorizon base Micula staurophora $(87.18\;\mathrm{Ma})$ .   
• Cenomanian/Turonian boundary $(93.90\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 2: recognized between biohorizon tops Axopodorhabdus biramiculatus $=$ Axopodorhabdus albianus; 93.98 Ma) and Helenea chiastia $(93.90\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and biohorizon bases Quadrum gartneri $(93.75\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and Eprolithus moratus (93.73 Ma).  

Members of Gephyrocapsa dominate Pleistocene assemblages; however, this group demonstrate s a large range of variation in size and morphology, causing problems in identification (e.g., Samtleben, 1980; Su, 1996; Bollmann, 1997). Early work by Samtleben (1980), Rio (1982), and Matsuok a and Okada (1990) established the utility of biometric variations in Gephyrocapsa for Pleistocen e biostratigraphy. Since then, many studies have confirmed biometric subdivisions of Gephyrocapsa as reliable biostratigraphic markers (e.g., Raffi et al., 1993, 2006; Young, 1998; Raffi, 2002; Maiorano and Marino, 2004; Lourens et al., 2005), and we have elected to use this biometric classification. We used the following divisions for shipboard identification of Gephyrocapsa:  

• Gephyrocapsa spp. ${<}4\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ (small): includes a number of different species (e.g., Gephyrocapsa ericsonii and Gephyrocapsa ornata, as well as small specimens of Gephyrocapsa oceanica and Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica).   
• Medium-sized Gephyrocapsa $(4-5.5\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ ): identified to species level based on the size and morphology of the central area: $G.$ . oceanica (large central area with bridge angle ${\bf<}90^{\circ}$ to the minor axis) and $G.$ . caribbeanica (small central area nearly filled by a bridge). Gephyrocapsa omega and Gephyrocapsa muellerae were included with $G.$ . oceanica.   
• Gephyrocapsa spp. ${>}5.5\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ (large): includes large specimens of both $G.$ . oceanica and $G$ . caribbeanica.  

Reticulofenestra evolved in the early Eocene and quickly dominated nannoplankton assemblage s throughout the world’s oceans for the remainder of the Paleogene and Neogene. Species withi n this genus are distinguished based on the size and shape of the coccolith as well as the size an d structure of the central area; however, these parameters show considerable variations within an d between “species,” which can make differentiation difficult (e.g., Backman, 1980; Su, 1996; Young, 1998). Although some species are easily distinguishable, elliptical forms are particularly problematic, especially because different names have been applied to similar morphologies from the Paleogene and the Neogene. Here we define the taxonomy we applied for members of this genus.  

Elliptical forms $<\!3\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with variable central opening size are defined as follows:  

• Reticulofenestra minuta.  

Elliptical forms $>\!3\:\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with open central area are defined as follows:  

• Reticulofenestra minutula: open central area $3{-}5\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.   
• Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus: used for Neogene sediments; divided into two size categories following the definition of Young (1998) for biostratigraphic utility: • $R$ . pseudoumbilicus $(5-7\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ . • $R$ . pseudoumbilicus $(>\!7\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ ; the top $(3.70\,\mathrm{Ma})$ of this form marks the Zone NN15/NN16 boundary.   
• Reticulofenestra dictyoda: used for Paleogene sediments; an open central area $5{-}14\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.  

• Reticulofenestra umbilicus: forms ${>}14\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with open central area. The base of this taxon marks the base of Zone NP16 and its top marks the base of Zone NP23 in low and middle latitudes. In the southern high latitudes, the top of $R$ . umbilicus is in Zone NP23.  

Elliptical forms $>\!3\:\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with closed central area are defined as follows:  

• Reticulofenestra producta: closed central area $3{-}5\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.   
• Reticulofenestra perplexa: closed central area $5{-}8\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.   
• Reticulofenestra scrippsae: closed central area $8{-}10\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length.   
• Reticulofenestra bisecta: closed central area ${>}10\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in length; The top of this taxon $(23.13\,\mathrm{Ma})$ is very close to the Oligocene/Miocene boundary.  

# 4.1.2. Methods of calcareous nannofossil study  

Most samples for examination of calcareous nannofossils were prepared as standard smear slide s (Bown and Young, 1998). For sandy or organic-rich sediments, strewn slides were prepared b y thoroughly mixing a few cubic millimeters of sediment in $5{-}25\;\mathrm{mL}$ of deionized water buffered t o a $\mathsf{p H}$ of ${\sim}8.5$ with ammonium hydroxide and Triton X to lower the surface tension. After mixing, the sample was allowed to sit for 30–60 s for larger particles to settle out. A pipette was used t o transfer the overlying suspension to a cover glass, which was dried on a low temperature on  a warming plate. Once dry, cover glasses were affixed to the microscope slide using Norland optica l adhesive Number 61 (refractive index $=1.56_{\cdot}$ ) and then cured under ultraviolet light. Samples wer e analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan, Axiophot, or AxioImager microscope with cross-polarized, plane-transmitted, and/or phase-contrast light at $630\times$ , $1000\times$ , or $1250\times$ magnification. Abundance estimates were made at $1000\times$ magnification. When necessary, additional toothpick samples were taken between core catcher samples from split core sections to refine the stratigraphi c position of biohorizons. All light microscope images were taken using a Spot RTS imaging syste m with the IODP Image Capture and Spot commercial software. Selected samples were observe d using a Hitachi TM3000 bench-top SEM to verify the preservation state of calcareous nannofossil s and confirm the presence of small forms such as Emiliania huxleyi, which are difficult to confidently identify using transmitted-light microscopy. All light microscope and SEM images wer e uploaded to the LIMS database.  

Total calcareous nannofossil group abundance in the sediment was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant ( ${\sqrt{\frac{}{}90\%}}$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of sediment particles).   
• $C=$ common $\langle>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $(1\%{-}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare ( ${<}1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no specimens).  

Individual calcareous nannofossil taxa abundance was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant $[>\!100$ specimens per field of view [FOV]).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $_{>10-100}$ specimens per FOV).   
• $C=$ common $(>\!1-\!10$ specimens per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{Fr=}$ frequent (1 specimen per 1–5 FOVs; used for Sites U1580–U1582).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few (1 specimen per $5{-}10\;\mathrm{FOVs};$ for Site U1579 defined as 1 specimen per 1–10 FOVs).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen per ${>}10\,\mathrm{FOVs},$ ).   
• ? $'=$ questionable occurrence.   
• rw $=$ reworked occurrence.  

Shipboard observations of calcareous nannofossil assemblages focused on the presence of agediagnostic species. Distribution data therefore do not represent the full nannofossil assemblage. All nannofossil semiquantitative abundance data produced on board JOIDES Resolution wer e entered into DESClogik and are available from the LIMS database.  

Calcareous nannofossil preservation was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathbf{G}=$ good (little or no evidence of dissolution or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics only slightly altered, and specimens identifiable to the species level). • $M=$ moderate (specimens exhibit some etching or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics somewhat altered, and most specimens identifiable at species level). • $\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{poor}$ (specimens were severely etched or overgrown, primary morphological characteristics largely destroyed, fragmentation has occurred, and specimens often could not be identified at the species or genus level).

# 4.2.1. Planktonic foraminiferal taxonomy and biostratigraphy  

We used the biostratigraphic zonation scheme of Wade et al. (2011) for the Cenozoic. For the Cretaceous, we followed the zonation in Gradstein et al. (2012), which is a composite from Huber e t al. (2008), Huber and Leckie (2011), and Petrizzo et al. (2011), updated to the GTS2020. Th e planktonic foraminifera zonal scheme used during Expedition 392 is illustrated in Figure F12, an d age estimates for foraminifera datums are listed in Table T9.

Planktonic foraminiferal taxonomy follows Huber (1991), Olsson et al. (1999), Pearson et al. (2006), and Wade et al. (2018). Biohorizons approximating critical events and chronostratigraphi c boundaries are as follows:  

• Eocene/Oligocene boundary $(33.90\,\mathrm{Ma})$ : falls at the base of Zone O1, defined by biohorizon tops Hantkenina alabamensis and Hantkenina spp. $(33.90\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .   
• PETM (Paleocene/Eocene boundary) $(56.00\,\mathrm{Ma})$ : coincides with the base of Zone E1 and biohorizon bases Acarinina sibaiyaensis and Globanomalina australiformis $(56.00\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .   
• $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary $(66.04\,\mathrm{Ma})$ : coincides with the Planohedbergella impensa interval as described in Huber et al. (2018, 2022).  

# 4.2.2. Benthic foraminiferal taxonomy  

Species identifications for benthic foraminifera were conducted on the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractio n examined under a Zeiss Discovery V8 stereomicroscope. Genera were assigned following Loeblic h and Tappan (1988), and the standard foraminifera literature was consulted for species identification. Taxonomic assignments mainly follow Van Morkhoven et al. (1986), Hornibrook et al. (1989), Jones and Brady (1994), and Kaminski and Gradstein (2005).  

# 4.2.3. Methods of study for foraminiferal assemblages  

All sediment samples were wet sieved over a series of 63 and $150~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ size wire mesh sieves. Fo r samples suspected to contain assemblages with very small foraminifera, for example, after a n extinction event such as in the PETM for benthic foraminifera (Schmidt et al., 2018) and planktonic foraminifera in the Maastrichtian (e.g., Abramovich and Keller, 2003), a 20 and/or $45\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ siz e wire mesh was added to the set of sieves. The samples were subsequently dried over filter paper i n a low-temperature $(<\!60^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ oven and analyzed using standard stereomicroscope techniques usin g a Zeiss Discovery V8. The sieves were ultrasonicated at regular intervals to avoid contamination o f samples. Lithified sediment samples that did not disaggregate after soaking in water alone wer e soaked in a $10\%$ hydrogen peroxide solution for $30{-}60\ \mathrm{min}$ before wet sieving. Disaggregation i n water with borax (or Calgon) and/or $10\%$ $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ was applied in strongly lithified samples whe n needed. After removal from the sediment and identification to the species level whenever possible, well-preserved specimens were photographed using a Hitachi TM3000 SEM. All images wer e uploaded to the LIMS database.  

The preservation status of planktonic and benthic foraminifera was estimated as follows:  

• $\mathrm{VG}=$ very good (no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{G}=$ good (little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $M=$ moderate (calcite overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion are common but minor).   
• $\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{poor}$ (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, or fragmentation).  

Planktonic foraminiferal abundance relative to total sediment in the 20–45, 45–63, 63–150, and/o r ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction was estimated from visual examination of the sieved residue as follows:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant ( $530\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!10\%{-}30\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(>\!1\%-5\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren.  

Benthic foraminiferal abundance relative to total sediment in the 20–45, 45–63, 63–150, and/o r ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction was estimated from visual examination of the sieved residue as follows:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant $[>\!30\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!10\%{-}30\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(>\!1\%-5\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren.  

Planktonic to benthic ratio $\left(\mathrm{P/{\left[P+B\right]}}\right)$ determinations were made for as many samples as possibl e to evaluate relative changes in paleobathymetry (Ingle, 1980). Notes were also made about significant presences of fish teeth, radiolarians, ostracods, and other sedimentary and biogenic particles. These observations were entered in DESClogik in the planktonic foraminifera template using th e same abundance codes.  

# 4.3. Siliceous microfossils  

# 4.3.1. Siliceous microfossils zonal scheme and taxonomy  

Diatoms and silicoflagellates were analyzed to assist in preliminary age and paleoenvironmenta l assessment. Diatoms were identified to the species level where possible. Additionally, the occurrence of radiolarians and sponge spicules were documented at the group level for those intereste d in postcruise analysis and shore-based studies.  

The initial shipboard diatom-based ages of Neogene, Paleogene, and Cretaceous samples wer e based on identification of primary and secondary datum events. Diatom zonal schemes and relevant papers for taxonomic studies for the Neogene/Quaternary, Paleogene, and Cretaceous ar e discussed separately in the sections below. The global zonation presented in Scherer et al. (2007 ) was used for general assessment, but detailed analysis/zonal schemes from the sections below provided a more robust framework that was used to build a biostratigraphic framework for Expedition 392. Where possible, biostratigraphic zones were also defined utilizing schemes derived fro m Southern Ocean and mid-latitude studies, primarily using the zonal scheme of Harwood an d Maruyama (1992). Biostratigraphically useful taxa and datum age calibrations are listed in Tabl e T10.  

# 4.3.1.1. Neogene and Quaternary  

For the Neogene, the Harwood and Maruyama (1992) zonal scheme was used with some update s from the northern belt of the Southern Ocean (Zielinski and Gersonde, 2002). Ages from all previously described Neogene and Quaternary zonal schemes were updated to the GTS2020 (Tabl e T10). Age calibrations of Cody et al. (2008) and Florindo et al. (2013) were used for Miocene–  

Pleistocene sediments, and we followed the taxonomic concepts of marker species specified comprehensively in appendices 1a and 1b of Cody et al. (2008).  

# 4.3.1.2. Paleogene and Cretaceous  

Recent advancements in biostratigraphy in the Atlantic extend calibrated records into the Paleogene for global distributions of both diatoms and silicoflagellates (Barron et al., 2015; Renaudie e t al., 2018). Ages of taxa from supplemental table 1 of Barron et al. (2015), updated to the GTS2020, were used for Eocene marker species from Southern Ocean and South Atlantic records. Additionally, for the Cretaceous–Paleogene transition, the compilation of diatom datums following Renaudie et al. (2018) was used. Cretaceous zonal schemes and diatom occurrence data from Souther n Hemisphere sites including Seymour Island (Santonian to Danian; Harwood et al., 1988), DSD P Site 275 (Santonian to Campanian; Hajós and Stradner, 1975), and ODP Hole 748B (Maastrichtian; Harwood and Nikolaev, unpubl. data) were used for Late Cretaceous diatom biostratigraphy. Because species-level identification was not possible for the Paleogene–Cretaceous pyritize d diatoms found in Site U1581 sediments, zonal schemes were not applied.

# 4.3.2. Methods of study for siliceous microfossils  

Diatoms (marine and freshwater), silicoflagellates, and sponge spicules were analyzed from smea r slides mounted with Norland optical adhesive No. 61 (refractive index $=1.56\AA$ ). Samples with rar e to common overall abundance of siliceous microfossils were either disaggregated in distilled wate r or processed with $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and/or $10\%{-}30\%$ HCl. Strewn slides were prepared from these samples, and, when necessary, the cleaned material was washed over a $15~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ sieve to improve viewing. Species identification was carried out with a Zeiss AxioImager microscope using brightfield illumination at $400\times$ , $630\times$ (oil), and $1000\times$ (oil) magnification. The counting method of Schrader an d Gersonde (1978) was utilized for all diatom specimens.  

Abundance of individual taxa was quantified by a count tallied over a $40\,\mathrm{mm}$ traverse of smear an d strewn slides using $630\times$ magnification. Photomicrographs were taken using a Spot FLEX imagin g system with IODP Image Capture and commercial Spot software and a Hitachi TM3000 SEM. All images were uploaded to the LIMS database. Qualitative siliceous microfossil group abundance s were also determined from smear and strewn slides using $630\times$ magnification. These observation s were entered into DESClogik using the diatom template. Radiolarian occurrences were also note d in this database for those interested in postcruise work on radiolarians. The relative abundance o f diatoms was qualitatively estimated at $630\times$ magnification using the following codes:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $_{>5}$ complete valves per FOV).   
• $C=$ common (2–5 complete valves per FOV).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few (1 complete valve in $1{-}5\;\mathrm{FOVs})$ ).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 complete valve in $6{-}30\,\mathrm{FOVs}$ ).   
• $\mathrm{Tr=}$ trace (very rare valves or diatom fragments).   
• $\mathbf{B}=$ barren (no diatom valves or fragments observed).  

Relative abundances of individual diatom taxa were estimated at $630\times$ magnification (one transec t $=40\;\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{}$ ) using the following codes:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant ( $_{>10}$ valves per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $^{>5}$ and $^{<10}$ valves per FOV).   
• $C=$ common (1–5 valves per FOV).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few (1 valve in every $10\,\mathrm{FOVs})$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $_{<5}$ valves per transect).   
• $?=$ questionable occurrence.   
• rw $=$ reworked occurrence.  

The degree of siliceous microfossil fragmentation often mirrors dissolution, but the two factor s are not always directly correlated. Diatoms with well-preserved fine structures can be highly fragmented. Dissolution is a wholly chemical process (Warnock and Scherer, 2015), but fragmentatio n can be dominantly or entirely due to mechanical processes such as compaction or subglacial processes (Scherer et al., 2004). Preservation of diatoms, therefore, was qualitatively assessed wit h regard to both the degree of dissolution and fragmentation. The degree of dissolution was qualitatively graded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{low}$ (slight to no apparent dissolution [fine structures generally preserved]). • $M=$ moderate (moderate dissolution [fine structures may be lost]). • $\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{high}$ (severe effects of dissolution, including widened areolae, fusion of neighboring areolae, relatively abundant margins and cingula compared with valves, and notably higher proportions of heavily silicified forms).  

The degree of fragmentation was graded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{low}$ $550\%$ of identifiable diatoms are intact).   
• $M=$ moderate $(>\!50\%$ of diatom valves are broken, but most are identifiable).   
• $\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{high}$ (valves highly fragmented and very few complete valves present, hampering identification).  

# 4.4. Palynology  

# 4.4.1. Taxonomy and zonation scheme  

Dinocyst taxonomy follows that presented in Williams et al. (2017), except for the subfamily Wetzelielloideae, for which we follow recommendations in Bijl et al. (2017). Diachroneity of dinocys t ranges is a commonly recognized issue (e.g., Williams et al., 2004). For dinocyst biostratigraphy, the DINOSTRAT database (Bijl, 2022) was used, which contains a comprehensive overview o f regionally calibrated first and last occurrence datums of dinocysts for the Mesozoic–Cenozoic. We used version 2.0 of DINOSTRAT (https://github.com/bijlpeter83/DINOSTRAT), whic h was updated to GTS2020 (Gradstein et al., 2020). Dinocyst ranges from DINOSTRAT that wer e calibrated at nearby sites (the Southern Ocean or equatorial Atlantic) were preferentially used, where available. For the Cenomanian–Maastrichtian, we used predominantly biohorizon age s from Kerguelen Plateau (ODP Site 748; Mao and Mohr, 1992), Ivory Coast (ODP Site 959; Masur e et al., 1998), Australia (Helby et al., 1987), and Norfolk, UK (Pearce, 2000; Pearce et al., 2020). Fo r the interval around the $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary, we used biohorizon ages of dinocysts from expanded successions such as those at El Kef, Tunisia (Brinkhuis et al., 1998), and New Zealand (Crouch et al., 2014). For the Paleocene, biohorizons from sections in New Zealand (Crouch et al., 2014), Tasmania (Bijl et al., 2013), and the North Sea (Powell, 1992) were used. Biohorizon ages are compiled i n Table T11, along with the calibrations to the independent age constraints (in fraction from th e base of the biostratigraphic zone, stage, or magnetochron they were calibrated to) and site and/o r section at which they were calibrated (following the approach as outlined in Bijl, 2022).  

For taxonomy of miospores, we relied on Atta-Peters and Salami (2004), Contreras et al. (2014), Helby et al. (1987), Masure et al. (1998), Morgan (1978), and references therein.  

# 4.4.2. Methods for palynology study of sediments  

Approximately $_{5-15\;\mathrm{g}}$ of sediment from core catcher samples were processed for shipboard palynology analysis. However, time limited the ability to process all core catchers. Hence, a selection o f core catcher samples was processed for palynology. The processing procedure depended on th e lithologic characteristics of the sample. Two basic approaches were used: one involving disaggregation of material without the use of hydrofluoric acid (HF), and one involving digestion of siliciclastic material using HF. At the start of both methods, where presence of calcium carbonate wa s expected, an overload $30\%$ HCl was added to decalcify the sample. The next step in the processin g depended on the outcome of that first step:  

• Samples that were sufficiently disaggregated in the decalcification procedure were subsequently sieved (see below for the sieving process).   
• If success of disaggregation of samples (through HCl digestion) was a priori deemed unlikely to be successful or when the abundance of detrital material started to prevent adequate sieving of the samples, HF treatment was applied to subsequent samples. In the HF procedure, samples were digested with cold $48\%$ HF to dissolve silicates, followed by $30\%$ HCl to remove silicate gels. Centrifuging and decanting were carried out after each step.  

The processing method applied to each sample was recorded in the results table as follows:  

• HCl: removal of calcium carbonate.   
• HF: digestion with HF.  

# 4.4.3. Sieving, slide preparation, and microscopy  

All samples were sieved through a $15~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh to remove small amorphous organic matter. A n ultrasonic bath was used to further disaggregate material left on the $15\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve. Further concentration of palynofacies and removal of leftover detrital material was done using a swirling method, which takes advantage of the lower specific density of palynofacies compared to detrital material. All samples were mounted on glass microscope slides using glycerin jelly as the mountin g medium. Species identification and data collection were carried out with a ZEISS AxioScop e microscope using brightfield illumination at $400\times$ , $630\times$ (oil), and $1000\times$ (oil) magnification. Photomicrography was conducted using a SPOT Flex 64 imaging system. All images were uploaded t o the LIMS database.  

# 4.4.4. Palynomorph abundance and preservation  

Palynofacies were grouped into the following broad categories as follows:  

• In situ marine organic-walled dinocysts.   
• Reworked marine organic-walled dinocysts.   
• Foraminiferal test linings.   
• Prasinophytes.   
• Acritarchs.   
• Miospores (pollen and spores). • Black phytoclasts.   
• Brown phytoclasts.   
• Fungal spores.   
• Amorphous organic matter.

For semiquantitative estimates of the abundance of these palynofacies groups, the following scal e was used:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant $[>\!90\%$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $C=$ common ( $>\!10\%{-50\%}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $(1\%{-}10\%$ of palynomorphs).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare ${}^{<1\%}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathbf{B}=$ barren (not present).  

Dinocysts in each sample were identified to the genus or species level, where possible. For biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental purposes, shipboard analysis of palynomorphs focused primarily  on  determining  the  presence  of  age-diagnostic  dinocyst  taxa  and  characterizing  th e palynological assemblage in terms of paleoenvironment.  

The following qualitative indication of their occurrence is used to present abundance of individua l species:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant ( ${\sqrt{\frac{}{290\%}}}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $C=$ common ( $>\!10\%{-50\%}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $(1\%{-}10\%$ of palynomorphs).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare ${}^{<1\%}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $?=$ questionable assignment.   
• rw $=$ reworked.  

Miospores identified during these counts followed the same abundance scheme as the dinocysts, and this provided a preliminary assessment of the yield. Where time constraints allowed, miospores were identified to genus and species level.  

Palynomorph preservation was qualitatively classified as follows:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (little or no evidence of degradation or oxidation).   
• $M=$ moderate (some evidence of degradation or oxidation).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ poor (major degradation or oxidation has occurred).  

# 4.4.5. Palynology-based paleoenvironmental analysis  

Three indicators were used to infer aspects of the depositional environment. The palynofacie s composition provides a general characterization of the composition of organic matter (terrestria l or marine), the level of oxidation of the sediment (Keil et al., 1994), and the level of maturity. Miospore assemblages provide qualitative information on hinterland climate conditions, mainly precipitation and seasonality. The abundance of insect-pollinated versus wind-pollinated miospore s provides information on proximity to shore and runoff intensity (e.g., Sánchez Goñi et al., 2018).  

The use of dinocysts as paleoenvironmental indicators derives from two broad lines of evidence:  

• Information on their present-day global distribution, including in southern high latitudes (Esper and Zonneveld, 2007; Prebble et al., 2013; Zonneveld et al., 2013). These studies showed dinoflagellate distribution in the modern ocean is strongly influenced by sea-surface temperature (SST), sea ice, surface productivity, and salinity. Other aquatic palynomorphs, in particular acritarchs and prasinophytes, were used to infer information on riverine input/water stratification. Miospore assemblages can provide quantitative and semiquantitative information about terrestrial conditions at the time the source vegetation grew (e.g., Contreras et al., 2014). • A second line involves empirical information on the paleoecological affinity of now-extinct dinocyst taxa (e.g., Sluijs et al., 2005; Frieling and Sluijs, 2018) through comparison with other indicators of paleoenvironmental conditions. This resulted in qualitative, and even steps toward quantitative, ecological affinities of so-called dinocyst ecogroups. Index species were identified for sea-surface stratification, upwelling, freshwater input, salinity, SST, nutrients, and sea level dynamics (Sluijs et al., 2005; Frieling and Sluijs, 2018, and references therein). Although these paleoecological affinities were mostly identified for Cenozoic taxa, many of these taxa have either stratigraphic ranges extending into the Late Cretaceous (Bijl, 2022) or have closely affiliated taxa with likely similar affinities as their Cenozoic ancestors (Fensome et al., 1993).  

Additional information about the depositional environment was derived from reworked palynomorphs (dinocysts and miospores) as in Bijl et al. (2018).  

# 5. Paleomagnetism  

Onboard paleomagnetic investigations during Expedition 392 focused mainly on determining th e orientation of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) vectors of core samples. This was don e by performing quasicontinuous measurements on the archive-half sections, integrated with measurements on discrete samples from the working-half sections. Rock magnetic experiments wer e also performed to further characterize the magnetic properties of the core material.  

# 5.1. Core orientation  

Core orientation information was obtained during collection for APC cores only. APC and RC B cores were collected using a nonmagnetic core barrel. APC cores were oriented using the FlexI T or Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool. HLAPC, XCB, and RCB cores were not oriented. All result s of oriented cores were reported in geographic coordinates derived using FlexIT/Icefield MI- 5 measurements and local International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF13) magnetic declination.  

# 5.1.1. Continuous measurements  

Remanence measurements of archive-half sections were performed using a 2G Enterprises superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) equipped with direct-current superconducting quantu m interference devices (DC-SQUIDs) and an in-line automated three-axes alternating field (AF ) demagnetizer (maximum AF step $=80\,\mathrm{mT}$ ). The coordinate systems used for archive halves, SRM, and AF demagnetizing coils are illustrated in Figure F13A. The background noise level (i.e., empt y holder) of the shipboard SRM during Expedition 392 on average is $x\mathrm{-}\mathrm{axis}\,=\,{\sim}1.5\,\times\,10^{-8}\;\mathrm{Am^{2}},\,y.$ - axis $={\sim}5.0\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{Am^{2}}_{:}$ , and $z{\mathrm{-axis}}={\sim}5.0\times10^{-9}\,{\mathrm{Am}}^{2}$ . Occasionally, the background noise level o f the SRM increases to $x{\mathrm{-axis}}={\sim}3.0\times10^{-8}\,{\mathrm{Am}}^{2},$ , $y_{\mathrm{-}\mathrm{axis}}=\mathrm{\sim}5.0\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{Am^{2}},$ , and $z\mathrm{-axis}=\mathrm{\sim}1.0\times10^{-8}$ $\mathrm{Am^{2}}$ . NRM was measured at 2.5 or $5~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals, and measurements were repeated after A F demagnetization with a variation of three to four of the following steps: 5, 10, 15, and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Intervals with clearly visible drilling-related disturbance were not measured. To avoid possible magnetic contamination, the sample track was cleaned a minimum of once per work shift $(\sim\!12\,\mathrm{h})$ . Th e magnetization of the sample tray was also measured once per work shift, and the obtained valu e (holder) was subtracted from archive-half measurements.  

Measurements of archive halves were conducted using the onboard Integrated Measurement System (IMS) (version 10.2) software. The measurement interval was 2.5 to $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ , and measuremen t speed was $1\:\mathrm{Hz}$ . The pick-up coil response functions of the DC-SQUID sensors have a full widt h of $7.2{-}9.1\;\mathrm{cm}$ at half height (Acton et al., 2017). Therefore, data collected within ${\sim}4.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ of piec e boundaries (or voids) are significantly affected by edge effects. Consequently, all data point s within $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ of piece boundaries (as documented in the curatorial record) were filtered out prior t o further processing. Edge effects may also occur in a continuous core piece if substantial heterogeneity (in intensity or direction) is present in the piece. It is more difficult to filter out such artifacts, but calculating the average direction (using Fisher statistics; Fisher, 1953) for each core piece coul d provide a means of identifying these problems (Koppers et al., 2013).  

# 5.1.2. Discrete measurements  

Normally, one to two discrete samples per core were collected from undeformed, finer graine d intervals, avoiding intervals clearly affected by drilling-induced disturbance. Discrete sample analysis helps to monitor the behavior of core samples during AF and thermal demagnetization experiments, determine the AF step necessary to remove the magnetic overprint in the archive-hal f section, and can additionally help characterize magnetic mineralogy. For soft-sediment intervals, discrete samples were collected from working halves using plastic Natsuhara-Giken samplin g cubes (volume $=7~{\mathsf{c m}}^{3},$ ). Cubes were pushed into the working halves by hand with the up arro w ( $-z\cdot$ -axis) on the cube pointing toward the top of the core section (Figure F13B). For more indurated intervals, an extruder was pushed into the sediment and the cut material was then placed i n a plastic box. For very hard lithified sediment and volcanic rock intervals, $8\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ cubic samples ( 2 $\mathrm{cm}\times2\:\mathrm{cm}\times2\:\mathrm{cm})$ were cut using a trim saw. The orientation of the cubes follows the right-han d rule (Figure F13B). For hard rock core samples, at least one oriented cube was analyzed per core.  

All discrete samples were measured for volume-normalized bulk susceptibility $(\upchi)$ , and a select fe w were measured for anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) with an AGICO Kappabridg e (model KLY 4). The Kappabridge measures AMS by rotating the sample along three axes, stackin g the data, and calculating the best-fit second-order tensor by using the AMSSpin freeware of Gee e t al. (2008). Tensor elements were converted to eigenparameters (eigenvectors $\mathrm{V}_{1},\,\mathrm{V}_{2},$ and $\mathrm{V}_{3}$ wit h corresponding eigenvalues τ1, $\boldsymbol{\uptau}2$ , and $\uptau3$ , where $\mathsf{T}1=$ maximum value and $\uptau3=$ minimum value ) (Tauxe, 2010). The average AMS tensor of each set of samples was estimated by using the bootstrap approach of Constable and Tauxe (1990), and the anisotropy degree $\left(P^{\prime}\right)$ and shape parameter (T) have been calculated as follows (Jelinek, 1981):  

and  

$$
P^{\prime}\,=\,e x p\sqrt{2\sum_{i\,=\,1}^{3}\left(\upeta_{i}-\upfrac{\upeta}{\upeta}\right)^{2}}
$$  

$$
T=\frac{2\,\mathsf{n}_{2}-\mathsf{n}_{1}-\mathsf{n}_{3}}{\mathsf{n}_{1}-\mathsf{n}_{3}}\,,
$$

$$  

A value of $P^{\prime}=1.0$ indicates the absence of magnetic fabric, and $\mathrm{T}>0$ $(\mathrm{T}<0)$ indicates an oblat e (prolate) ellipsoid. Normal sedimentary AMS fabrics are oblate with vertical axes correspondin g to minimum susceptibility. Sediment deformation or other disturbances (e.g., bottom current ) generally produce different AMS fabrics.  

Following susceptibility measurements, AF demagnetization of discrete samples was performe d using an ASC Scientific AF demagnetizer (model DTECH D-2000). After initial NRM measurement, discrete samples were progressively demagnetized along three axes in peak AF steps of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, and $70\:\mathrm{mT}$ For some samples, additional lower steps (e.g., 2, 4, 6, or $8\,\mathrm{mT}$ ) o r higher AF steps of 90, 120, or $150~\mathrm{mT}$ were used. A select few hard rock samples were also stepwise thermally demagnetized using an ASC Scientific Model TD-48 SC thermal specimen demagnetizer to temperatures up to $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The remanence before and after demagnetization for discret e samples was measured on an AGICO JR-6A dual-speed spinner magnetometer (Figure F13B). The background noise level of the shipboard JR-6A was mostly ${\sim}1.0\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ (volume $=8\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ ) during Expedition 392. Data were transformed from the JR-6A instrument coordinate system t o the core coordinate system. Principal component analysis (PCA) of characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) vectors (Kirschvink, 1980) was carried out using the PuffinPlot software package (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012). For best-fit lines with maximum angular deviation of ${>}20^{\circ}$ or fo r samples where the data clustered on vector endpoint plots and stopped trending, a Fisher (1953 ) mean was determined for at least three consecutive demagnetization steps that remained in th e same direction.  

After demagnetization experiments were completed on cube samples, isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) acquisition experiments were performed at 100, 1200, and a backfield of $300\;\mathrm{mT}$ (denoted as -300) using an ASC IM10 impulse magnetizer. IRM acquisition remanence measurements are indicative of the magnetic mineralogy, which depends on the detrital magnetic minera l supply and/or diagenetic dissolution and neoformation of ferrimagnetic minerals.  

Based on these remanence parameters, the saturation IRM (SIRM) was approximated by  

$$
\mathrm{SIRM}=\mathrm{IRM}\;1200\;\mathrm{mT},
$$  

and the hard IRM (HIRM) was approximated by  

$$
\mathrm{HIRM}=0.5\times\mathrm{(SIRM-IRM_{-}300\;m T)},
$$  

where IRM_-300 is indicative of a backfield $300\;\mathrm{mT}$ step, and the $S_{}$ -ratio was calculated by  

$$
S=0.5\times\left(1\mathrm{~-~}\mathrm{IRM}_{-}{\cdot}300\mathrm{~mT}/\mathrm{SIRM}\right).
$$  

Note that the IRM_-300 measurement was assigned a negative value in instances when the application of the $300~\mathrm{mT}$ backfield resulted in a polarity change from the SIRM step (e.g., inclinatio n values flipped from $90^{\circ}$ to $-90^{\circ}$ ).  

HIRM is a measure of the contribution of high-coercivity minerals (e.g., hematite) to the signal. The $S{\mathrm{.}}$ -ratio is a measure of the relative amounts of low coercivity (soft) versus high coercivit y (hard) and provides an estimate of the relative importance of ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g., magnetite) versus antiferromagnetic minerals (e.g., hematite). $S{\mathrm{.}}$ -ratios close to 1 indicate a mineralog y dominated by low-coercivity minerals and values $^{<1}$ indicate a mineralogy affected by highcoercivity minerals. For IRM experiments, magnetic intensities were measured using a JR-6 A spinner magnetometer.  

# 5.1.3. Magnetostratigraphy  

Chron assignment was performed for each site by correlating observed polarity sequences to th e current geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) $(\mathrm{Ogg},2020)$ with the aid of biostratigraphic observations. For this expedition, we used the GPTS from the GTS2020 (Gradstein et al., 2020) (Tabl e T12). At the latitude of the sites in this expedition $(\mathrm{\sim}40^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ , polarity can be determined using th e sign of paleomagnetic inclination alone. In general, reversals were marked at the halfway poin t between the lower (upper) reversed polarity sample and upper (lower) normal polarity sample.  

# 6. Stratigraphic correlation  

Sedimentary successions cannot be continuously cored at a single borehole even when core recovery in a hole exceeds $100\%$ (e.g., Ruddiman et al., 1987; Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2002). Core recovery exceeding $100\%$ is common with APC and XCB drilling because of core expansio n at the sea surface (red bands indicate added length in Figure F14). Gaps and disturbances occu r between successive cores, caused by ship heave, drilling, and tides. To recover a complete sediment succession, adjacent holes offset by tens of meters laterally and several meters vertically mus t be cored and then correlated.  

The main objective of stratigraphic correlation is to define a continuous lithologic record combining adjacent drilled holes at a given site. The composite record of multiple holes is called th e “splice.” It represents the most complete and undisturbed sedimentary sequence recovered at eac h site. Sampling for scientific analyses will primarily be done along the splice. Therefore, the qualit y of the composite record is critical for several key scientific objectives of Expedition 392. Interval s not included in the splice can be sampled; however, due to differential degrees of core expansion, compression, or local sedimentological differences among holes, small variations in the reporte d depth of correlative features in adjacent holes will occur.

Figure F14. Interrelationship between cored material and the depth scales used during Expedition 392. In this exampl e scenario, five cores were recovered from Hole A. The starting depth for coring Hole B was offset vertically by several meter s to cover gaps in the record of Hole A. Five cores were recovered from Hole $\mathsf{B},$ of which Core B2 had less than full recover y and Cores B3, B4, and B5 had more than $100\%$ recovery because of expansion of core material, resulting in increased lengt h (red segments). The CSF-A scale (example Hole B) is established by adding the curated core length (red and brown intervals) to the depth of each core top determined by the DSF measurement. If recovery is $>\!100\%$ , plotting recovery on th e CSF-A scale will result in overlap between cores of the same hole. The CCSF scale corrects for this and other inadequacies o f the CSF-A scale. It is based on locating features common to cores in multiple holes at a given site and is constructed b y working from the top of the site downward to select tie points (green dashed lines) that correlate features in one hole t o those in another. Because of core expansion, Holes A and B on the CCSF scale are longer than they are on the CSF-A scale. The splice on the CCSF scale at the far right is constructed by combining selected intervals between tie points so that corin g gaps and disturbed sections are excluded. This process ideally results in a complete stratigraphic sequence. The procedur e assumes identical sediment thickness between tie points joining two holes. However, because of differential squeezing an d stretching of each core during the coring process and lateral variations in sedimentation, features cored in parallel will no t align perfectly, as illustrated by the pink dashed lines joining the pink horizon in Cores A2 and B2.  

To ensure complete recovery if two or more holes were drilled, near-real-time monitoring of th e parallel hole was done by correlating features in newly recovered cores to features in previousl y drilled cores from the first hole. To allow for near-real-time correlation, thermally unequilibrate d cores from the parallel holes were measured immediately after recovery and processing on th e catwalk on the “fast-track” Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) (see Physical properties). During Expedition 392, MS and NGR were generally the most useful information to guide drillin g decisions, enabling identification of shared features among holes. If needed, the stratigraphic correlators advised the drillers when adjustments should be made in coring to ensure that core gaps i n previously drilled holes were covered. After completing coring at a given site, stratigraphic correlation among holes was refined using all available physical property data, biostratigraphic data, and digital images of the split core halves to identify intervals in each hole with the best recover y that could be joined to assemble a complete composite record.  

# 6.1. Composite record procedure  

Using multiple data types, stratigraphic correlators identify tie points in each core of each hol e that place it in a stratigraphic position most in agreement with cores in neighboring holes. Th e starting point is the longest first core that captures the mudline from among all holes at a site, which becomes the anchor in the composite record. In Figure F14, Core A1 captured the mudlin e and is selected as the anchor for the composite record. From this anchor, multiple data types ar e used to identify common features that can be correlated among holes downsection. For each core, a depth offset that best aligns the physical property variations to the equivalent cores in adjacen t holes is added to the CSF-A depth scale, generally resulting in a cumulative depth offset i n sequence down the holes (gray dashed lines indicate offsets in Figure F14). Depth offsets are ofte n chosen to optimize correlation of specific features that later define splice levels in cores from adjacent holes. Not all features in a single core may line up with a parallel core (pink intervals an d dashed line in Figure F14) because of differential disturbance or local variation in sedimentation.  

When all cores are correlated, a composite record can be defined, ideally along the tie point s already identified for the correlation (rightmost panel of Figure F14). The splice starts with th e core that captures the mudline or the highest core in the interval of overlap between holes if it i s some distance below the seafloor. Splicing continues downward by selection of the best recovere d intervals across holes that together capture the most continuous and complete record of th e drilled stratigraphy. The Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS) downhole lo g measurements of total spectral gamma ray (HSGR) were consulted to establish the stratigraphi c position of core data in case of incomplete core recovery.  

Construction of a splice using parallel drilled cores from different holes was only possible for Sit e U1579. It was based on the stratigraphic correlation of data from the WRMSL, SHMSL, NGRL, and SHIL. NGRL data were collected at $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals, WRMSL and SHMSL data were collecte d at $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals (see Physical properties), and the SHIL line scan interval is 20 lines/mm (5 0 $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ (see Lithostratigraphy). Raw data were imported into Correlator software (v4.0) and culle d as necessary to avoid incorporating anomalous data influenced by edge effects at section boundaries and by coring disturbance. Additionally, correlators employed the Code for Ocean Drillin g Data (CODD), an Igor Pro–based system designed to integrate ocean drilling data of all types wit h depth-scaled core images (https://www.codd-home.net).  

Constructing a splice entails a progression through a series of different depth scales from reporte d drilling depth to final composite depth (Figure F14). The naming conventions used for th e depth scales follow IODP convention (http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines) and ar e described below.  

# 6.2. Core depth below seafloor scale  

The process of building a composite section begins by assigning a depth to the top of each cor e initially using the DSF depth scale. The DSF scale is a drill string measurement based on the lengt h of drill string from the seafloor to the cored top of each core. It is calculated by subtracting th e length of the drill string from the rig floor to the top of the cored interval from the length of th e drill string between the rig floor and the mudline (the estimated level of the seafloor). Sources o f error in the DSF depth scale are numerous and include pipe and BHA stretch and compression, tidal variations, wind-induced differences in the height of the sea surface, currents and win d affecting the bend of the drill string, and uncompensated heave. The influence of tides on DS F measurements can be significant (Hagelberg et al., 1995), and the prediction of tides is generall y useful for guiding drilling to avoid initial gap alignment (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003b). Because of the small tidal range of $\pm50~\mathrm{cm}$ in the region of the sites, no adjustment was neede d during Expedition 392.  

The CSF-A depth scale is used to characterize the depth for a given position in any core. The CSFA depth scale combines the DSF core-top depth with the curated length of the core after retrieva l and allows overlap at core boundaries. The CSF-A scale is equivalent to the mbsf scale used durin g the DSDP, ODP, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. CSF-A values are specific to each hole, and the CSF-A scale is the depth scale used for most primary observations, including informatio n summarized on the VCDs and presented in the site chapters. Minor inaccuracies in the CSF- A scale are related to both drilling effects and core expansion effects; thus, the CSF-A scale permit s stratigraphically impossible overlaps between successive cores.  

To compensate for expansion, the CSF-B depth scale is calculated for all cores as well. Whe n recovery is ${\le}100\%$ , the CSF-A and CSF-B scales have the same value. When recovery is $>\!100\%$ , linear interpolation is applied to compress the recovered interval into the length drilled, eliminating apparent overlaps. Factors that lead to ${>}100\%$ recovery include elastic, thermal, and/or gasinduced core expansion; flow-in and/or recovery of downhole contaminants; and gaps due t o rotation and misalignment of breaks during sectioning. CSF-B values are available for all hole s drilled during Expedition 392 but were not used in any of the reports.  

# 6.3. Core composite depth below seafloor scale  

The construction of a composite depth scale for a given site starts from the mudline or from th e highest core in an interval of overlap. Compositing involves identification of coeval, laterally continuous features in parallel drilled holes, which may occur at different depths on the CSF-A scal e for each hole. Once correlative features are identified, the depths of individual cores are offset relative to the CSF-A depth scale by a single value for each core in that hole such that the features ar e optimally aligned. Offsets for every core in every hole were tabulated in an affine table from eac h site with multiple stratigraphically overlapping holes. The resulting new depths for all the shifte d cores are on the CCSF scale, which gives the distance from seafloor to target (e.g., core, sample ) within recovered cores using a scale of adjusted depths constructed to resolve depth inconsistencies and gaps in the core recovery. The CCSF scale is equivalent to the meters composite dept h (mcd) scale used during ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions.  

Compositing proceeds sequentially downcore through the establishment of specific tie point s among the various holes. Because of coring-induced stretching and squeezing and stratigraphi c differences between holes, the CCSF scale does not result in precise alignment of all coeval features among holes. Care should be taken when comparing results from samples collected fro m within the splice to those for the same CCSF interval in intervals not included in the splice.  

Although all care is taken to avoid overlapping core gaps among holes, in practice at least som e coring gaps exist at most sites. Downhole logging data can be used to estimate the length of th e gap, maintaining an observational connection to the anchor core. When there is an aligned cor e gap across all holes at a site without suitable downhole data, cores below the gap are no longer tie d to the anchor core. These cores can still be tied to one another, but the correlated sections ar e considered to be floating on the CCSF scale.  

Choosing a CCSF depth for floating sections is subjective. During Expedition 392, one of tw o methods was used to tie floating sections into the splice as noted in the affine table. When a cor e was APPENDED, the core being appended used the inherited absolute offset of the core above th e coring gap. When a core was SET, the stratigraphic correlator set a user-defined offset tha t resulted in the best qualitative alignment. In cases with large aligned core gaps within a splice, th e CCSF scale for the uppermost core below the gap was assigned the same value as the CSF-A offse t of that core. Alternative methods for defining a SET offset are available but were not used durin g Expedition 392.  

During the process of constructing the composite section, a CCSF depth may become expande d compared to that of the CSF-A depth for equivalent horizons. This expansion of the depth scal e may be an artifact of the selection of tie points or can be related to physical processes, includin g decompression of the sediment as it is brought to atmospheric pressure, pore space gases comin g out of solution, warming, stretching that occurs as part of the coring process, and recovery o f additional material, likely from borehole wall sediment that fell downhole and entered the cor e barrel (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2002). Expansion of depth scales during Expeditio n 392 was limited, and offsets did not generally exceed the depth of the bottom of the interva l drilled.  

# 6.4. The splice  

Once the CCSF scale is developed and the between-core gaps identified, a complete stratigraphi c section (splice) is constructed by combining selected intervals between the previously establishe d tie points. In case of core gaps aligned across all holes, any spliced sections below the gap are designated as floating splice sections and plotted against CCSF as described above.  

# 6.5. Measurements and methods for correlation  

Given that few long sections of overlap were cored at any site and the drilling technique used ofte n differed between holes during Expedition 392, we adjusted our approach to correlation based o n the specifics of the situation. Observations of features in the recovered core as seen through th e core liner, comparison of DSF/CSF-A measurements between holes, and MS measurement s acquired as soon as possible after core retrieval using the STMSL track were most useful for guiding drilling decisions in near real time. The success rate of these decisions in bridging coring gap s and areas of disturbed sediment was high. The initial correlation between holes used for guidin g drilling was refined as additional information became available from subsequent analyses, including biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic information, higher resolution physical propert y records measured on the WRMSL, sedimentological observations, photos, and color data. In addition, comparison between core measurements and downhole logs were used to test and refine correlations. NGR arguably gave the most consistently useful means of correlation between hole s beyond aligning drilling depths. In specific instances, however, other data (e.g., digitized colo r reflectance data [both RGB and $L^{\ast}$ , $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ , $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ measurements], MS, gamma ray attenuation [GRA] bul k density, lithologic observations, and paleomagnetic data) were all important. These data have different resolutions, and details on instrument calibrations, settings, and measurement intervals fo r Expedition 392 are given in Physical properties.  

Compositing and splicing were accomplished using Correlator software (v4.0). The software generated standard affine tables (listings of the vertical offset, in meters, added to each core to generate the CCSF scale) and splice interval tables (listings of the specific core intervals used t o construct the splice). These tables were uploaded into the LIMS database, which then linked th e appropriate depth scale to any associated data set.  

# 7. Chronostratigraphy  

Age models for the sedimentary sequences recovered during Expedition 392 were constructe d using biostratigraphic age constraints, including tops, bases, assemblages, evolutionary turnover s (see Micropaleontology) and, where possible, magnetostratigraphy (see Paleomagnetism). W e use the GTS2020 of Gradstein et al. (2020) for all ages of biostratigraphic datums (Tables T8, T9,  

T10, T11) and paleomagnetic chrons (Table T12). Age-depth tie points from bio- and magnetostratigraphy are combined into one age-depth model for each of the four sites drilled during Expedition 392. We place biohorizons by convention at the midpoint between constraining sample s and magnetic polarity reversals between measurement points with clear opposite polarity. As  a result, bio- and magnetostratigraphic tie points have depth uncertainty dictated by the spacing o f samples. Age uncertainty is plotted when given in the GTS2020 or when ages are derived from th e overlapping stratigraphic ranges of several age diagnostic species in one sample.  

The age-depth models were plotted using R, a free software environment for statistical computin g (R Core Team, 2018), with tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) packages. Average sedimentation rate s were interpreted by running a locally weighted smooth fit (locally estimated scatterplot smoothin g [LOESS]) through the tie points, with greater weighting of the magnetostratigraphic age constraints. This smoothing was modified where hiatuses are inferred. Where signs of rhythmicity i n sedimentary banding patterns or physical property data were observed, sedimentation rates wer e estimated based on a preliminary interpretation of the potential orbital driver and compared t o the biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic framework.

# 8. Geochemistry  

The geochemistry program for Expedition 392 combined headspace hydrocarbon analyses, I W analyses, inorganic bulk geochemistry of sediments and hard rocks, and organic sediment geochemistry of sediments. Sediment geochemistry included total inorganic carbon (TIC), total carbon (TC), calculated total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and on selected samples, total sulfur (TS) and bulk organic matter source and maturity analyses.  

These analyses closely followed shipboard safety and pollution prevention requirements. The primary goal of these analyses was to determine the diagenetic regime by IW analysis and provid e bulk sediment/hard rock geochemistry indicators for shipboard interpretation, providing a basi s for shore-based sampling.  

# 8.1. Whole-round samples for interstitial water sampling  

Routine IW was extracted from $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ long whole-round sediment sections that were cut an d capped immediately after core was curated into sections on the catwalk. In the upper $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of th e sedimentary sequence, samples were taken at a resolution of approximately three samples per 1 0 m. Below the upper $30\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , one sample per core was typically taken from the bottom of Section 1 o r from a section that was most optimal for pore fluid extraction upon visual inspection. However, the sampling resolution varied at each site due to core length and recovery. Samples from mor e than one hole were treated as constituting a single depth profile using the CSF-A depth scale as th e depth reference, if possible. No acetone was used to seal the end caps of the cut cores until after al l whole-round samples were removed from the catwalk.  

In the laboratory, whole-round sediment samples were removed from the core liner under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the outer outside surfaces $({\sim}0.5\;\mathrm{cm})$ of the sediment samples were carefull y scraped off with spatulas to minimize potential contamination by drilling fluids. Each scrape d whole-round sediment sample was placed into a Manheim titanium squeezer and compressed a t ambient temperature with a Carver hydraulic press (Manheim, 1966). IW samples discharge d from the squeezer were passed through $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ polyethersulfone membrane filters, collected i n acid-cleaned plastic syringes, and stored in plastic or glass sample bottles for shipboard or shorebased analyses.  

Samples saved for shore-based analyses were split into four separate aliquots for oxygen isotopes, carbon isotopes, Li and K isotopes, and rare earth elements (REE), trace metals, and Sr isotopes.  

Sample allocation was determined based on the obtained pore fluid volume and analytical priorities. Data produced using the Agilent 5110 inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was collected in atomic emission spectroscopy mode and is referred to a s ICP-AES in the LIMS database. In this volume, ICP-AES is used to refer to these data. Aliquots fo r shipboard analysis using ICP-AES were acidified by adding ${\sim}10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of trace metal–grade concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and placed in $2\,\mathrm{mL}$ cryovials. Aliquots for titration and ion chromatography analyse s were put in $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ glass vials.  

After IW extraction was complete, a sample was taken from the sediment squeeze cake fo r onboard bulk parameter analyses and the remainder was divided and kept for various shore-base d analyses by the shipboard science party. The remainder was returned to the repository.  

# 8.2. Shipboard analysis  

IW samples were analyzed on board the ship following protocols as described in Gieskes et al.   
(1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

# 8.2.1. Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and pH were measured immediately after squeezing, following the procedure s in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinity was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handhel d refractometer, pH was measured with a combination glass electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with an autotitrator (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) using 0.1 M HCl at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ .  

International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater wa s used for calibration and was analyzed at the beginning and end of a batch of samples for each sit e and after every 10 samples. Alkalinity titrations are estimated to have a precision better than $5\%$ based on repeated analysis of IAPSO standard seawater.  

# 8.2.2. Ion chromatography  

Sulfate, chloride, bromide, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium concentrations were analyzed using ion chromatography (Metrohm 850 Professional IC) using aliquots of $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ that wer e diluted 1:100 with deionized water $(18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm})$ . At the beginning and end of each run, differen t dilutions of IAPSO standard seawater were analyzed for quality control and to determine accurac y and precision. Analytical precision was generally better than $2\%$ for chloride, bromide, sulfate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium concentrations; however, refer to data tables in individual site chapters for reproducibility information.  

# 8.2.3. Ammonium  

Ammonium concentrations were determined using an Agilent Technologies Cary Series 100 UVVis spectrophotometer with a sipper sample introduction system, following the protocol i n Gieskes et al. (1991). Concentrations of ammonium were estimated based on alkalinity measurements to determine the appropriate dilutions for analysis. For ammonium measurements in samples with an alkalinity of ${<}20\;\mathrm{mM}$ , a $0.2\;\mathrm{mL}$ sample aliquot was diluted with $2~\mathrm{mL}$ nanopure water. To each diluted sample, $1~\mathrm{mL}$ phenol ethanol, $1~\mathrm{mL}$ sodium nitroprusside, and $2~\mathrm{mL}$ oxidizin g solution (trisodium citrate and sodium hydroxide) were added to a sample tube (Gieskes et al., 1991). The solution was kept at room temperature in the dark for ${\sim}6.5\,\mathrm{h}$ to develop color. Ammonium concentrations were determined at a spectral absorbance of $640\;\mathrm{nm}$ . Because of the low levels of ammonium measured during this expedition, precision and accuracy of the ammoniu m analyses are estimated to be ${<}50\%$ for Sites U1579 and U1580; however, for each site, the individua l site chapter data tables should be consulted for a more accurate assessment of the analytica l uncertainties.  

# 8.2.4. Major and minor elements in dissolved interstitial water samples using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy  

Dissolved major (sodium $\left[\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}\right]$ ; potassium $\left[K^{+}\right]$ ; calcium $\left[\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+}\right]$ ; sulfur, which is assumed to be sulfate $[\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}]$ ; and magnesium $\left[{\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}\right].$ ) and minor (lithium [Li], strontium [Sr], boron [B], silicon [Si], manganese [Mn], iron [Fe], phosphorus [P], and barium [Ba]) element concentrations were determined by ICP-AES with an SPS4 autosampler. Emission wavelengths for sample analysis are presented in Table T13. The shipboard ICP-AES analyses of IW samples followed an analytica l protocol originally developed at the Institute for Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment (ICBM; Germany). Each acidified IW sample was diluted 1:10 by adding $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ IW and 10 0 $\upmu\mathrm{L}$ spike solution containing $100~\mathrm{ppm}$ each of beryllium (Be), indium (In), and scandium (Sc ) internal standards and $200\,\mathrm{{ppm}}$ antimony (Sb) to 4.4 mL $2\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ in $18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm}$ deionized water. The multielement spike was used to cover both atomic and ionic interferences (B. Schnetger, pers. comm., 2017). For calibration, serial dilutions of IAPSO standard seawater ( $10\%$ , $30\%$ , $50\%$ , $70\%$ , $90\%$ , and $100\%$ ) were prepared to cover IW concentrations smaller than or equal to normal seawater. Additional calibration solutions for major and minor element concentrations exceeding seawater (Ca, B, Ba, Fe, Li, Mn, P, Si, and Sr) were prepared in $3.5\%\ \mathrm{NaCl}$ as a matrix. Calibratio n solutions were spiked in the same way as the IW samples. Calibration solutions were made fro m certified stock solutions for minor elements (B, Ba, Fe, Li, Mn, P, Si, and Sr).

During each ICP-AES run, a complete set of all in-house and IAPSO dilutions were analyzed at th e beginning and end of each batch. Furthermore, $100\%$ concentration solutions of in-house an d IAPSO standards were run every 8–10 samples to monitor instrumental drift. Elemental concentrations reported for each sample were average values from three replicate integrations of eac h sample measured consecutively by continuous flow, as set by instrumental parameters; the standard error in the average was also calculated by the instrument software.  

Following each ICP-AES run, measured concentrations were recalculated after setting background correction parameters and adjusting peak centers using the software that accompanies th e ICP-AES instrument. Replicate analyses of IAPSO standard seawater between every 10 IW samples were used to estimate the accuracy and precision of the measurements for all elements, whic h typically was lower than $5\%$ . Precision was determined by the instrument from threefold runs o f each sample; however, data tables for individual site chapters should be consulted for a more accurate assessment of the analytical uncertainties.  

# 8.2.5. Headspace hydrocarbon analyses  

The shipboard organic geochemistry monitoring program included determination of the composition and concentrations of volatile hydrocarbons $\left(C_{1}-C_{6}\right)$ in sediment to ensure that gas conten t did not exceed amounts safe for drilling operations.  

One headspace gas sample was routinely taken at the top of the lowermost $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ section of eac h core. The headspace gas sampling procedure involved placing ${\sim}5~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of sediment into a glas s serum vial immediately following core retrieval. The glass vial was then quickly sealed with  a polytetrafluoroethylene/silicone septum and aluminum crimp cap and heated at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ to allow for gas liberation from the sediment. Following the heating period, a $5~\mathrm{mL}$ volume o f headspace gas from the headspace in the vial was removed with a gas-tight glass syringe for analysis using gas chromatography.  

The headspace gas samples were analyzed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC ) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The GC was equipped with an electronic pressure control module to control the overall flow into the instrument. A stainless steel GC colum n $\phantom{-}2.4\mathrm{~m}\times3.2\mathrm{~mm}$ inner diameter) packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep R was used for separation. The oven program started at a temperature of $35\mathrm{^\circC}$ for $4\ \mathrm{min}$ before ramping at $25^{\circ}C/\mathrm{min}$ t o $200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , with a final hold time of $15.6\;\mathrm{min}$ . The total run time per gas sample was 15 min. Data wer e collected and evaluated with an Agilent Chemstation data handling program. Concentrations o f methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , propene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ , butanes $\left(C_{4}\right)$ , pentanes $\left(C_{5}\right)$ , and hexanes $\left(C_{6}\right)$ were recorded. The chromatographic response was calibrated against know n standards to determine concentrations in sediment. Gas standards were measured routinely onc e per day, or more frequently as required, to monitor instrument stability.  

# 8.3. Carbonate and organic sediment geochemistry  

# 8.3.1. Sediment nitrogen and inorganic and organic carbon content  

Sediment samples for carbonate, organic carbon, and nitrogen analysis were routinely collecte d from 1–2 horizons per core, and additional samples were taken from intervals of distinct lithologies. Prior to analysis for TC, TIC, and TN, samples were frozen, freeze-dried for ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the n homogenized using an isopropyl cleaned agate mortar and pestle or a ball mill for hard and consolidated sediments. TS was measured on samples of special lithology (e.g., organic carbon–ric h black shale).  

TC, TN, and TS of the sediment samples were determined with a ThermoElectron FlashEA 111 2 CHNS elemental analyzer equipped with a ThermoElectron packed column CHNS/NCS GC an d a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Approximately $10{-}15~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighed into  a tin cup and combusted at $950^{\circ}C$ under an oxygen stream. The reaction gases passed through  a reduction chamber to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and then were separated using gas chromatography before detection by TCD. All measurements were calibrated to a standard (Soil Reference Material [NIST2704]; sulfanilamide for sulfur), which was run every 10 samples. The pea k areas from the TCD were calculated to determine the TC, TN, and TS of the samples. Typica l precision was $5\%$ for replicate analyses of a carbonate sample; however, data tables in individua l site chapters should be consulted for further reproducibility information.  

TIC was determined using a UIC $5015\,\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Around $10~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighe d into a glass vial and acidified with 2 M HCl. The liberated $C O_{2}$ was titrated, and the correspondin g change in transmittance in the coulometric cell was monitored using a photodetection cell. Th e weight percent of calcium carbonate $\left(\mathbf{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ was calculated from the inorganic carbon content:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\left(w t\%\right)\times100/12.}
$$  

Standard $C a C O_{3}$ $:>\!99.9\%$ ; Fisher Scientific) was used to confirm accuracy. TOC content was calculated by subtraction of inorganic carbon from the TC:  

$$
\mathrm{wt}_{0}^{\circ}\,\mathrm{TOC}=(\mathrm{wt}_{0}^{\circ}\,\mathrm{TC})-(\mathrm{wt}_{0}^{\circ}\,\mathrm{TIC}).
$$  

# 8.3.2. Bulk organic matter source and thermal maturity  

The type and quantity of organic matter in sediments with $22\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ TOC were evaluated by pyrolysis assay using a source rock analyzer (SRA) from Weatherford Laboratories. Between 60 and 18 0 mg of freeze-dried, ground sediment was weighed into SRA crucibles. The sample was heated a t $340^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $3\,\mathrm{{min}}$ , releasing volatile hydrocarbon (HC) as the S1 peak $\left(\mathrm{mg}\,\mathrm{HC}/\mathrm{g}\,\mathrm{rock}\right)$ . The temperature was increased from $340^{\circ}$ to $640^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ , resulting in hydrocarbon release from th e pyrolysis of kerogen (S2 peak; mg $\mathrm{HC}/\mathrm{g}$ rock). The temperature of the maximum rate of hydrocarbon yield during the S2 analysis is $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ . The S3 peak constitutes $C O_{2}$ (as mg $C/\mathbf{g}$ rock) release d during pyrolysis between $340^{\circ}$ and $390^{\circ}C$ . $C O_{2}$ ( $\mathfrak{s}\,\mathbf{m}\mathbf{g}\,C/\mathbf{g}$ rock) produced by oxidizing the pyrolysis residue at $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ is the S4 peak, which is not reported. To validate the calculated TOC derive d from the elemental analyzer we calculated $\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}$ from S1, S2, and S4, assuming that S1 and S 2 are $83\%$ carbon:  

$$
\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}=[0.83\times(\mathrm{S1}+\mathrm{S2})+\mathrm{S4}]/10.
$$  

The carbon-normalized hydrogen index (HI) $(\mathrm{mg~HC}/\mathrm{g}$ TOC) and the oxygen index (OI) (m g $\mathrm{CO_{2}/g}$ TOC) were calculated from pyrolysis values:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathrm{HI}=\left(100\times\mathrm{S2}\right)/\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}},\,\mathrm{and}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{OI}=(100\times\mathrm{S3})/\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}.}}\end{array}
$$  

The production index (PI) as thermal maturity indicator was calculated as follows:  

$$
\mathrm{PI}=\mathrm{S}1/(\mathrm{S}1+\mathrm{S}2).
$$  

All SRA measurements were preceded by a blank and calibrated to a rock standard from Weatherford Laboratories (533; PN:810-141-B). The same standard was used for quality control every 1 0 samples.  

# 8.4. Inorganic sediment and hard rock geochemistry  

Sediment samples were analyzed for whole rock major and minor elements using ICP-AES at  a minimum resolution of $50\;\mathrm{m}$ and a higher resolution through intervals of interest. Besides petrographic core and thin section descriptions (see Igneous petrology), a representative set of igneou s rocks were also geochemically characterized using ICP-AES and XRF analysis. In general, ICPAES samples were taken from the same (or adjacent) intervals from which thin sections wer e produced. To receive rapid preliminary information on the selected samples, all sample powder s produced for ICP-AES analytics were measured with the pXRF instrument prior to digestion. T o help distinguish macroscopically similar but geochemically distinct igneous units (e.g., differen t lava flows for which contact boundaries are not preserved) during core description and as an additional guide for shipboard ICP-AES sampling, pXRF measurements were also conducted on th e split core surfaces on the archive halves.  

# 8.4.1. Sample preparation  

Sample preparation for sediment samples was carried out on $2{-}5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ splits of squeeze cakes. Splits were frozen in a $-80^{\circ}C$ freezer and then freeze-dried for at least $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ or until dry. Freezedried samples were powdered in a ball mill prior to weighing for digestion.  

Sample preparation for hard rock samples was carried out on $2{-}8~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of igneous rock, which wa s cut from the cores using a diamond-blade rock saw. To remove altered rinds as well as saw mark s and any drilling-related contamination on the exterior, the outer surfaces of the samples wer e ground off using a diamond-impregnated grinding wheel. Afterward, each rock sample wa s cleaned in a beaker with isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for $15\,\mathrm{\min}$ to remove dust. Afte r decanting the isopropanol, the samples were agitated twice in an ultrasonic bath in $18~\mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm}$ nanopure deionized water for $10\ \mathrm{min}$ . After drying the cleaned samples for $10{-}12\,\mathrm{h}$ at $110^{\circ}C$ t o remove water, the rock samples were crushed to $^{<1}$ cm between two Delrin plastic disks in  a hydraulic press.  

The crushed rock chips were ground to a fine powder using a tungsten carbide SPEX 8515 Shatterbox powdering system. Potential contamination from powdering in tungsten carbide mills wa s checked during ODP Leg 206 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003a) and appeared to be negligible fo r major elements and most of the trace elements measured on board the ship (Sc, V, Cr, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba). A systematic analysis of the shipboard powders from Integrated Ocean Drilling Progra m Expedition 304/305, however, indicated possible Co contamination during powder preparatio n (Godard et al., 2009). Before further processing the powder for ICP-AES and volatile analytics, pXRF measurements were conducted.  

# 8.4.2. Volatile measurements  

Volatile content of igneous rock samples was measured using the loss on ignition (LOI) method. On a Mettler Toledo balance, about $5000\;\mathrm{mg}$ of the sample powder was weighed into quartz crucibles, ignited for $4~\mathrm{h}$ at $950^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and weighed after cooling in a desiccator to determine LOI. Estimated relative uncertainties on LOI values for $5000\,\mathrm{mg}$ samples are ${\sim}0.2\%$ on the basis of duplicat e measurements.  

# 8.4.3. Rock and sediment inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy  

The standard shipboard procedure for digestion of rocks and sediments and the subsequent ICPAES analysis is described in detail in Murray et al. (2000) and the shipboard user guide for ICPAES, with modifications as indicated in the Expedition 369 methods chapter (Huber et al., 2019a). The following protocol is a synopsis of this procedure with minor changes and additions.  

On a Cahn C-31 microbalance, each sample and standard was weighed to $100.0\,\pm\,0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ . Th e weighing errors are estimated to be $\pm0.2~\mathrm{mg}$ under relatively smooth sea-surface conditions bu t can be larger in case of high swell and bad weather conditions. Aliquots of ignited whole-roc k powders or nonignited sediment powders were mixed with $800.0\,\pm\,0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ flux (preweighed on shore). To prevent the fused bead from sticking to the crucible during cooling, aqueous LiBr solution ( $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $0.172\,\mathrm{\mM}$ was added to the flux and rock powder mixture as  a nonwetting agent prior to sample fusion. Samples were fused individually in Pt-Au (95:5) crucible s for ${\sim}12\ \mathrm{min}$ at a maximum temperature of $1220^{\circ}C$ in an internally rotating induction furnac e (Bead Sampler NT-2100).  

The beads were then transferred into $50~\mathrm{mL}$ high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles and dissolved in a $50~\mathrm{mL}$ solution of $10\;\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ (prepared from Optima-grade concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3})$ ). The solution bottle was placed in a Burrell wrist-action shaker for $_{3-6\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ at $7^{\circ}C$ to aid dissolution, and then $0.5\,\mathrm{\mL}$ of the sample solution was pipetted into a polyethylene centrifuge tube an d diluted with $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ of internal standard solution containing Be (10 0 $\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g})$ , In $(100~\upmu\mathrm{g/g)}$ , and Sb $(200~\upmu\mathrm{g/g)}$ . This solution was analyzed for both major and trace elements.  

# 8.4.4. Analysis  

For the sediment analysis, major and trace element concentrations of standards and samples wer e determined using ICP-AES. The analyzed major elements include Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ca, Na, K, and P, and minor or trace elements include V, Zn, Sr, Zr, and Ba. Matrix-matched multielemen t solutions were made for instrument calibration by mixing $0.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of flux blank, $0.1\;\mathrm{mL}$ of interna l standard (detailed above), the appropriate volume of multielement solution, and $10\%$ trace meta l grade nitric acid to bring the solution to $5\,\mathrm{mL}$ . The calibration was checked with certified international reference standards (HISS-1 and MESS-4), and drift was monitored with three check standards run every 10 samples.  

For igneous rock analysis, major and trace element concentrations of standards and samples wer e also determined using ICP-AES. The analyzed major elements include Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ca, Na, K, and P, and trace elements include Sc, V, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, and Ba. Emission wavelengths for the analysis of samples are presented in Table T13. In a first run, matrix-matched multielement solutions were used for instrument calibration (see above). For a second run, certifie d international rock reference materials (BCR-2, BHVO-2, BIR-1, JA-1, JA-2, JA-3, JB-3, JGb-1, an d MRG-1) were used for calibration and drift monitoring. Chemical procedural blanks wer e included with the unknown samples for each sample run. Detection limits were calculated as thre e times the standard deviation of the mean for blank solution measurements.  

The ICP-AES plasma was ignited at least $20\;\mathrm{min}$ before each sample run to allow the instrumen t to warm up and stabilize. ICP-AES data were acquired using Agilent’s ICP Expert software. Th e intensity curve for each element is defined by 20 measurements within the designated wavelengt h window. The Expert software integrates the area delineated by the baseline and the intensit y curve. Each sample was analyzed three times from the same dilute solution in a given sample run. For several elements, measurements were made at two or more wavelengths in axial/radial mode. For each run, the wavelength yielding the best calibration line was identified and used to determine concentrations.  

A drift-correction sample (in-house standard of Be, In, and Sb mixed with equal amounts of al l samples to be $400\,\mathrm{mg}$ in total) was analyzed in every fifth sample position and at the beginning an d end of each run. Procedural blank solutions were run near the beginning and end of each run an d at every ${\sim}25$ sample positions. A $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ wash solution was run for 90 s between each sampl e analysis.  

# 8.4.5. Data reduction  

A drift correction was applied to each element based on linear interpolation between drift-monitoring solutions run every fourth or fifth analysis. After drift correction and subtraction of th e average procedural blank, a calibration line for each element was calculated using the results fo r the certified rock standards. Concentrations used for the calibrations were compiled values fro m the literature as detailed in Table T14; they were recalculated on a volatile-free basis for thos e samples with $\mathrm{LOI}\,>\,2\%$ . Total Fe oxide concentrations were reported as $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}^{\mathrm{~t~}}$ . The compile d values  were  from  Govindaraju  (1994)  and  the  GeoRem  website  (http://georem.mpchmainz.gwdg.de) (Jochum et al., 2005). Element concentrations in the samples were then calculated from the relevant calibration lines. Blank measurements were used to determine detectio n limits. Estimates of accuracy and precision of major and trace element analyses were based o n replicate analyses of international standards run as unknowns and were not used in the calibration. Results are presented in Table T15.  

# 8.4.6. Portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometry measurements  

pXRF spectrometry measurements, made using an Olympus DeltaX handheld instrument, provided rapid characterization of split core surfaces and powder samples for assessment of chemica l variations and how they may (or may not) tie to petrographic observables. For practical reasons, only qualitative measurements (ratios) were used during Expedition 392; thus, no external dat a calibrations against international rock standards were performed. However, internal calibratio n and data corrections of the instrument were tailored for geological applications and are based o n the Fundamental Parameters methodology. Accordingly, a series of nonlinear equations is solve d for each element analyzed. Parameters used in the equations comprise metrics for X-ray source, fluorescence intensities, absorption coefficients, and absorption edge effects for each wavelengt h analyzed, along with parameters for sample geometry and a Compton normalization scheme (e.g., Reynolds, 1963; van Sprang, 2000). All measurements during Expedition 392 were performe d using the Geochemistry program of the instrument with $30~\mathrm{s}$ counting time for each of the tw o beams, respectively. Measurements on split core surfaces were conducted using a shield sleev e analyzer mount. For these analyses, 3525 Ultralene $0.16\;\mathrm{mil}$ $(4~{\upmu\mathrm{m}})$ film was placed over the cor e interval to prevent contamination and/or damage to the $\mathrm{X}$ -ray analyzer (e.g., Johnston et al., 2018). In addition, powders prepared for ICP-AES analysis were measured using XRF powder moun t assemblies based on methods outlined in Reagan et al. (2015).

# 9. Physical properties  

High-resolution petrophysical measurements were made during Expedition 392 on cores in th e shipboard physical properties laboratory and using downhole (in situ) logging tools (see Downhole measurements). These data play a major role in hole-to-hole and site-to-site stratigraphi c correlation, detection of stratal discontinuities and inhomogeneities, obtaining information abou t differences in the composition and texture of sediments and underlying basement rocks, identification of major seismic reflectors, and construction of synthetic seismograms. A variety of techniques and methods were used to characterize the physical properties of Expedition 392 cores o n whole-round, section-half, and discrete samples. Core sections are typically $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ in length, suc h that a typical coring length (stroke) of $9.5\textrm{m}$ with full recovery yields six sections plus a shorte r seventh and core catcher section. Procedures for measuring sediment, lithified sediment, and har d rock (e.g., igneous rock) cores differ slightly.  

# 9.1. General physical properties sampling and measurement sequence  

# 9.1.1. Measurements of sediment core sections  

After recovery and curation of core sections, whole-round sections were initially run through th e NGRL (Figure F15). Selected core sections were then run through the X-Ray Imager (XRI) (Figur e F16). Following thermal equilibration at ambient room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and atmospheri c pressure for ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{h}$ , the core sections were run through the WRMSL to measure bulk density usin g the GRA method, MS, and compressional wave velocity on the $P$ -wave logger (PWL) (Figure F17).  

When an interval of stratigraphy was cored in multiple holes, core sections were run through th e STMSL immediately upon recovery, measuring just GRA bulk density and MS at a lower samplin g resolution $\left(5\thinspace\mathrm{cm}\right)$ prior to equilibration to help with rapid stratigraphic correlation to inform drilling decisions. Because some of the physical properties measurements are particularly sensitive t o temperature, all fast-tracked sections were remeasured using the WRMSL at a $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ samplin g resolution following the standard $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ thermal equilibration period.  

Thermal conductivity was measured on one whole-round section per every one or two sedimen t cores (typically Section 3) (Figure F18). For soft sediments these data were collected with a needl e probe inserted into a hole drilled through the plastic core liner near the middle of the whole-roun d section. The cores were then split longitudinally, with one half to be archived and the other half fo r sampling and analysis (working half). For more consolidated sediments, the puck probe was use d to measure the working-half section for thermal conductivity.  

Following splitting of the section, the archive half of the core was passed through the SHMSL fo r measurement of MSP and color reflectance at a nominal sample interval of $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ (Figure F19). Two-dimensional X-ray images were taken from the archive half of the core through select intervals of interest at each site (Figure F16).  

Discrete samples were collected from one to two sections of the working halves of the split sections of the core (typically Sections 2 and 4 or 5) to measure wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density using moisture and density (MAD) procedures (Figur e F20). Where possible, samples were taken as close to the middle of the core sections as core conditions permitted. However, in some cases, there was poor core recovery or the cores consisted o f numerous small fragments (biscuits); in such cases, the most suitable and representative discret e rock samples of these cores were selected. Such biscuiting is normally only an issue in XCB an d RCB cores across variable lithologies. At sites where multiple holes provided overlapping intervals, the cores from additional parallel holes were not sampled; only nondestructive analyses (e.g., WRMSL and SHMSL) were collected (see above). $P$ -wave velocity was also measured on workin g halves and cubic samples (in $x_{\mathrm{-}},y_{\mathrm{-}}$ , and $z$ -directions) using the SHMG, a contact acoustic velocit y logger using an acoustic transducer and first arrival traveltimes to estimate the $P$ -wave velocit y (Figure F21).

# 9.1.2. Measurements of hard rock core sections  

Hard rock cores, consisting of basalt, were recovered with the RCB coring method. These core s were run through the NGRL and the WRMSL, as described for the sedimentary cores (Figure s F15, F17). Hard rock core sections containing fragments were shaken onto liners in the core splitting room for examination by a petrologist, who decided where the pieces should be split betwee n working and archive halves (see Introduction for curatorial procedures). The archive half of th e core was passed through the SHMSL (Figure F19) for measurement of MSP and color reflectanc e at a nominal sample interval of $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ . The hard rock samples were saturated with seawater befor e measurements of thermal conductivity, $P$ -wave velocity, and MAD analysis. Thermal conductivit y was measured once per core using a contact puck probe on a piece of a section half (Figure F18). $P$ -wave velocity was measured on one to two sections per core using the SHMG for discrete har d rock samples (Figure F21). MAD measurements (Figure F20) were also taken on these samples o r from discrete samples or core fragments obtained from the same lithology from a position nea r where $P$ -wave caliper velocity was measured.

# 9.2. Whole-Round Multisensor Logger core measurements  

GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and MS of cores were measured nondestructively on th e WRMSL (Figure F17). To optimize the process, sampling intervals and measurement integratio n times were the same for all sensors. Sampling intervals were set at $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ with an integration tim e of 5 s for each measurement. These sampling intervals are common denominators of the distance s between the sensors installed on the WRMSL $(30{-}50~\mathrm{cm})$ , which allows for efficient sequentia l and simultaneous measurements. After every core was analyzed, the fidelity of the measurement s was monitored by passing a single core liner filled with deionized water through the WRMSL.  

# 9.2.1. Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

The GRA densitometer (Figure F17) provides an estimate of bulk density of core based on th e attenuation of a gamma ray beam. The beam is produced by a $^{137}\!C\!s$ gamma ray source at a radiation level of $370\;\mathrm{MBq}$ within a lead shield with a $5\;\mathrm{mm}$ collimator, which is directed through th e whole-round section. The gamma ray detector on the opposite side from the source includes  a scintillator and an integral photomultiplier tube to record the gamma radiation that passe s through the core. The attenuation of the gamma rays occurs primarily by Compton scattering, i n which the gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. The degree of scattering i s related to the material bulk density. The density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of the attenuated gamma rays and can be expressed as  

$$
\uprho=-\mathrm{ln}(I/I_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$I=$ the measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample, ${\cal I}_{0}={\cal\Omega}$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

The $\upmu,I_{0},$ and $^d$ are treated as constants, such that $\uprho$ can be calculated from I.  

In general, WRMSL GRA bulk density measurements are most accurate when taken on a completely filled core liner with minimal drilling disturbance; otherwise, measurements tend to underestimate true values. By default, the instrument reports measurements using the internal diamete r of the core liner $\left(66\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for mos t sediment cores obtained using the APC system. For sediment and/or hard rock cored using th e XCB or RCB systems, core diameter is usually ${\sim}58~\mathrm{mm}$ or less, resulting in an underestimate d density for these cores.

SHMG $x\cdot$ -axis caliper and $y-$ and $Z^{\cdot}$ -axis bayonets used to measure $P$ -wave velocity on split-core sections of sof t sediment and discrete samples of indurated sediment or igneous rock. A. $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocity measurement on an igneous roc k discrete sample using the $x\cdot$ -axis caliper.  

Beginning with GRA bulk density data from Hole U1581B, a density correction was applied t o account for the actual volume of the core sample. The laser sensor of the color reflectance spectrophotometer measures the sample’s height above core track with a resolution of $0.01\ \mathrm{cm}$ . Th e following equation was used to calculate the area of a circular segment $(a)$ :  

$$
a\,=\,R^{2}\Big(\frac{d}{R}\Big)-d\sqrt{R^{2}-d^{2}},
$$  

using the difference $(d)$ between the reference and measured elevation of the top surface of spli t half core section and the radius of the core liner $(R=\sim3.59\,\mathrm{cm})$ . The density correction $(\Delta\rho)$ ca n be calculated comparing the true measured segment area $(a)$ and the archive half area of the cor e liner’s cross section $\left(a_{0}\right)$ :  

$$
\Delta\uprho=\uprho_{\mathrm{GRA}}\frac{a_{0}-a}{a_{0}}\ ,
$$  

where $\mathsf{\rho_{G R A}}$ is the measured GRA bulk density. The corrected density values $(\uprho_{\mathrm{\GRA}}^{\prime})$ are obtained a s follows:  

$$
\mathrm{{\uprho^{\prime}}_{G R A}-\mathrm{{\uprho_{GRA}}+\Delta\mathrm{{\uprho}\cdot}}}
$$  

The reflectance spectroscopy expanded profile data were downloaded from LIMS database, smoothed using a median filter, and interpolated in the location of the GRA bulk density measurements.  

The spatial resolution of the GRA densitometer is less than $\pm1\ \mathrm{cm}$ . The gamma ray detector i s calibrated with sealed calibration cores (one standard core liner filled with distilled water and aluminum cylinders of various diameters). To establish the calibration curves, gamma ray count s were taken through each aluminum cylinder for $60\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ . Each aluminum cylinder has a density of 2. 7 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and $^d$ is from $1\,\mathrm{cm}$ to $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The relationship between $I$ and $\upmu d$ is as follows:  

$$
\ln(I)=\mathrm{A}(\upmu d)^{2}+\mathrm{B}(\upmu d)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where the coefficients A, B, and C are instrument constants determined from the calibration. Recalibration was performed as needed when the estimated deionized water density standar d deviated significantly (more than a few percent) from $1\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# 9.2.2. Magnetic susceptibility  

MS $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by a n external magnetic field:  

$$
\mathrm{{X}}=M/H,
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field of strength $H.$ . The bul k MS of a rock depends on its mineralogical composition and sometimes the size of the minera l grains. Ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g., magnetite and maghemite) have relatively high positive M S and produce a large bulk MS even when present at low concentrations in rocks. Antiferromagneti c (hematite and goethite) and paramagnetic (smectite, illite, and chlorite) minerals have lower positive MS and can produce weak bulk rock MS in the absence or near-absence of ferromagneti c minerals. Diamagnetic minerals (calcite, quartz, and kaolinite) have very low and negative MS an d produce null or slightly negative bulk rock MS in the absence of other magnetic minerals (e.g., i n chalk or a pure limestone). Igneous materials typically have MS two orders of magnitude greate r than their alteration products, such as clay minerals.  

WRMSL MS measurements were made on whole-round core sections using a Bartington MS2 C loop sensor (Figure F17). An oscillator circuit in the sensor operates at a frequency of $0.565\ \mathrm{kHz}$ and produces a low-intensity, nonsaturating alternating magnetic field of ${\sim}140\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ . Sediment o r hard rock core sections within the influence of this field cause a change in oscillator frequency. Frequency information returned in a pulse form to the susceptometer is converted into MS. Th e loop sensor is about $25\;\mathrm{mm}$ wide, and measurements had a spatial resolution of ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm}$ and precision to within $2\%$ . Note that higher spatial resolution MS data are also collected on section halve s by the SHMSL (see below), and bulk MS data are collected for discrete cubes during AMS analyse s (see Paleomagnetism).  

# 9.2.3. P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity data can be used to evaluate small-strain (linear elastic) moduli, to correlat e between downhole logging and core data, and to evaluate porosity and compaction in sedimentar y rocks. $P$ -wave (compressional) velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is determined by measuring the time required for  a compressional wave to travel a specific distance through the core:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is the traveltime.  

The PWL on the WRMSL (Figure F17) measures the first arrival traveltime of $500\,\mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasoni c waves traveling horizontally across the core while it remains in the core liner. Waves are transmitted to the core by plastic transducer contacts connected to linear actuators. Pressure is applied t o the actuators to ensure coupling between the transducers and the core liner. The seismic wave s radiate from the source across the whole core and core liner. The total traveltime $t_{0}$ is the sum o f the following:  

• $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry, • $t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure, • $t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner, and • $t_{\mathrm{core}}=$ traveltime through the core.  

The system is calibrated using a core liner filled with distilled water, which provides control fo r $t_{\mathrm{delay}},\,t_{\mathrm{pulse}},$ and $t_{\mathrm{liner}}$ . From these calibrations, $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ can be calculated for the whole-round sections i n core liners as follows:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{cl}}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{\mathrm{o}}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{cl}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner, and $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness.  

The above equation assumes that the core completely fills the core liner.  

# 9.3. Natural Gamma Radiation Logger core measurements  

Gamma radiation is emitted because of the spontaneous decay of radioactive elements 238- uranium $^{(238\mathrm{{U})}}$ , 232-thorium $(^{232}\mathrm{Th})$ , and 40-potassium $(^{40}\mathrm{K})$ contained in all rocks. The NGR L measures this natural emission on whole-round sections using a system designed and built at th e Integrated Ocean Drilling Program–US Implementing Organization (USIO) (Texas A&M University, USA) (Figure F15) (Vasiliev et al., 2011; Dunlea et al., 2013). When $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotopes decay, they and their daughter products emit gamma radiation at specific energy level s unique to each isotope. NGR spectroscopy measures a wide energy spectrum that can be used t o estimate the abundance of each isotope based on the strength of the signal at characteristic energies (Blum, 1997; Gilmore, 2008). In sedimentary rocks, Th and K are usually associated with particular clay minerals, and U is often encountered in either clay minerals or organic-rich material. Because minor changes in the abundance of clay minerals produce a relatively large variation i n gamma radiation, the NGR data are useful as a lithologic indicator, aiding in core-to-core correlation. The NGR spectral data were processed to estimate U, Th, and K contents with depth usin g the method and Matlab routines by de Vleeschouwer et al. (2017).  

The NGRL system was installed on the renovated research vessel JOIDES Resolution in 2009 an d has been used on every JOIDES Resolution expedition starting with Expedition 320. The NGR L system consists of 8 sodium iodide (NaI) detectors arranged at $20~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals under the lowe r half of the core section (Figure F15). The data were collected in two measurement cycles, each o f which produced NGRL measurements at 8 positions in the core section. During the first measurement cycle, the first detector was located $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ from the top of the core section, thus producing  8 measurements at positions that are odd multiples of $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ from the top of the core. The core wa s then advanced $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ , producing another 8 measurements at positions that are even multiples o f  

$10~\mathrm{cm}$ from the top of the core. The detector array has both passive (layers of lead) and activ e (plastic scintillators) shielding to reduce the background environmental and cosmic radiation. Th e plastic scintillators are positioned above the core section and detect incoming high-energy gamm a and muon cosmic radiation that is removed from the total counts of the NaI detectors. The passiv e (lead) layers separate the NaI detectors, isolating the portion of the core being measured. Th e quality of the energy spectrum measured in a core depends on the concentration of radionuclide s in the sample and on the measurement time, with longer duration measurements yielding bette r spectra. Measurement times were chosen to be 5 min per measurement cycle, or ${\sim}10$ min per cor e section. This yields statistically significant energy spectra for most lithologies (Vasiliev et al., 2011).  

# 9.4. Thermal conductivity core measurements  

Thermal conductivity was typically measured on one section per core (usually Section 3) with th e TK04 (Teka Bolin) system (Figure F18) using a needle probe method in full-space configuratio n for whole-round sediment cores for poorly consolidated sediments (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959) and contact probe method in half-space configuration on split cores using a puck senso r applied to most of sedimentary and hard rock samples. The probes contain a heater wire and calibrated thermistor.  

For hard rock cores, samples were selected from the working half and returned unaltered to th e core liner upon completion of the tests. Measurements were taken with a contact probe embedde d in the surface of an epoxy block with low thermal conductivity (Vacquier, 1985). The epoxy bloc k and the probe were placed in contact with the sample, and both were placed in a plastic containe r filled with seawater.  

To measure thermal conductivity, the probe heat source was turned on and the increase in temperature was recorded over $80\;{\mathsf s}$ . A heating power of about twice the tabulated average rock conductivity was typically used. The solution to the heat conduction equation with a line source o f heat was then fit to the temperature measurements to obtain the thermal conductivity. Becaus e the probe is much more conductive than sediments or basalts, the probe is assumed to be a perfec t conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of the probe has a linear relationship with th e natural logarithm of the time after heating is initiated:  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where  

$T=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\mathbf{(W/m)}$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity of the sample $\scriptstyle\left(\mathrm{W}/\left[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}\right]\right)$ , $t=$ time after the initiation of the heat source (s), and $C=$ instrument constant.  

Three measuring cycles were automatically performed, with the probe and sample allowed to reequilibrate for $10\;\mathrm{min}$ between each cycle. A test for instrument drift was conducted at the beginning of each measurement cycle. Once the probe temperature stabilized, the heater circuit wa s closed and the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity was calculate d from the rate of temperature rise while the heater current was flowing. Temperatures measure d during the first $80~\mathbf{s}$ of the heating cycle were fitted to an approximate solution of a constantl y heated line source (for details, see Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). The conductivity was taken t o be the average of the values from the three determined at each cycle. Measurement errors wer e $5\%{-}10\%$ .  

# 9.5. Section Half Multisensor Logger core measurements  

Color reflectance and MS were measured by the core description team on the archive sectio n halves using the SHMSL (Figure F19). The archive half of the split core was placed on the cor e track, above which an electronic platform moves along a track, recording the height of the splitcore surface with a laser sensor. The laser establishes the surface topography of the section, an d then the platform reverses the direction of movement, moving from the core section top (higher i n the borehole) to end (lower in the borehole) making measurements of MSP and color reflectance. Also, because the SHMSL requires a firm contact between the MS point sensor and the split cor e surface, measurements were made on the archive halves of split cores. MSP and color reflectanc e data were collected at a nominal interval of $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ for each core.  

# 9.5.1. Color reflectance spectrophotometry  

The color reflectance spectrometer uses an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer mounte d on the automated SHMSL. This uses both halogen and LED light sources, which cover wavelengths from ultraviolet through visible to near infrared. The measurements were taken from 38 0 to $900\ \mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths at $2~\mathrm{nm}$ intervals on the core sections. A 3 s data acquisition time wa s applied for the entire scan of the archive section half. The data are reported using the $\mathrm{L^{*}}\mathbf{a}^{*}\mathbf{b}^{*}$ colo r system, in which $L^{*}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is redness (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ is yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative) of the rock. The color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure white (reference) and pure black (dark). Color calibration wa s conducted approximately once every $^{6\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ (twice per shift), and plastic film was used to cover softsediment sections to prevent material from collecting on the detectors.  

# 9.5.2. Point magnetic susceptibility  

MSP measurements were taken with a Bartington Instruments MS2E point sensor and an MS2 K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter round sensor with a field of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and a n operation frequency of $930\;\mathrm{Hz}$ . The instrument averages three measurements from the sensor a t each position on the core, providing an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . The spatial resolution of the MSP instrument is ${\sim}3.8\;\mathrm{mm}$ , higher than the ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution of the MS loop on the WRMSL. The probe i s zeroed in air slightly above the core before each measurement to compensate for the influence o f the metal track. The MSP sensor was calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on th e ship and is quality checked every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ at the same time as the color reflectance sensor calibration.  

# 9.6. X-ray imaging  

JOIDES Resolution is equipped with an XRI consisting of a Teledyne ICM CP120B X-ray generato r and detector unit (Figure F16). The instrument measures density contrasts in core sections. During Expedition 392, the XRI was applied to selected whole-round sections and section halves. Given time and core workflow constraints, not all sections were imaged. Core sections were X-ra y imaged for the following reasons: (1) to document important lithologic or geological boundaries, (2) to assess the disturbance of poorly lithified sediments in APC core sections, (3) to detect possible occurrence of macrofossils or lithoclasts, or (4) to investigate sedimentary structures.  

The $\mathrm{X}.$ -ray generator works with a maximum voltage of ${\sim}120~\mathrm{kV}$ and a tube current of $^{\sim1}$ A an d has a $0.8\ \mathrm{mm}\times0.5\ \mathrm{mm}$ focal spot. The generator produces a directional cone at a beam angle o f $50^{\circ}\times50^{\circ}$ . The detector unit is located $65~\mathrm{cm}$ from the source and consists of a Go-Scan $1510~\mathrm{H}$ system composed of an array of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor s arranged to offer an active area of $102{\mathrm{~mm}}\times153{\mathrm{~mm}}$ and a resolution of $99~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ . Core section s were run through the imaging area at $12\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals, providing images of $15\,\mathrm{cm}$ onto the detecto r and allowing an overlap of $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ .  

The XRI settings were adjusted to compensate for the varying lithologies of the cores. The numbe r of images stacked was 20, taken at exposure times of $300\;{\bf s}.$ , and the current was kept at $0.7~\mathrm{mA}$ . The voltage ranged between 70 and $90\,\mathrm{kV}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ; higher voltages were used for denser lithologies.  

The raw XRI images were collected as 16-bit images and were processed using an IODP in-hous e processing utility in the IMS software (version 1.3). The software applies corrections for the detector (gain and offset corrections), compensates for core shape and thickness, and adjusts the imag e contrast. The Savitzky-Golay FIR filter was chosen to smooth images. The resulting processe d images include a masked background, the depth scale of the section, and the acquisition parameters. The software applies different processing to APC (or HLAPC) and RCB cores.  

# 9.7. Velocity, moisture, and density discrete core measurements  

Discrete samples were collected from the working halves of the core to determine wet and dry bul k density, grain density, water content, and porosity. Samples were typically taken from two section s per core, with additional samples taken as warranted by lithology changes. At sites where multipl e holes provided overlapping intervals, the duplicate cores were not sampled. In soft sediment, ${\sim}10$ $\mathbf{cm}^{3}$ samples were collected with a plastic syringe and placed in glass vials for measurements. Th e cores composed of strongly lithified sediments and hard rocks were analyzed by cutting a sampl e with a saw from the working halves. These samples often corresponded to the same intervals a s collected for discrete paleomagnetic analyses. Discrete $P.$ -wave velocity measurements (in $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}.$ -direction) were taken on intact core sections with the positions coinciding as much as possible with th e MAD sample locations. For cores that did not present intact sections, $P$ -wave velocity measurements were taken on either the MAD samples, or on larger pieces obtained from the same cor e section and with the same lithology, and as close as possible to the MAD sample location.  

# 9.7.1. Sample preparation  

Soft-sediment samples were placed in numbered, preweighed $\sim\!16\,\,\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for we t and dry sediment weighing, drying, and dry volume measurements. To determine the wet mass o f well-lithified samples (typically basalt), we placed the samples in individual plastic vials filled wit h seawater and used a vacuum chamber to force saturation of the pore space. The vacuum pum p removed the air from the chamber to a pressure of ${\sim}40{-}50\ \mathrm{kPa}$ below the atmospheric pressure. This, in theory, would force seawater into the pore space of the samples. These samples were kep t under saturation for at least $6~\mathrm{{h}_{:}}$ , with low pressure maintained in the chamber by turning th e pump on for $15\;\mathrm{min}$ every $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . After removal from the saturator, the cubes were patted dry with  a paper towel, and the wet mass was immediately determined using the dual balance system.  

# 9.7.2. $\bar{P}$ -wave velocity  

The $P$ -wave velocity acquisition system installed on the SHMG uses Panametrics-NDT Microsca n delay line transducers (Figure F21), which transmit seismic waves at $0.5\:\mathrm{MHz}$ . The signal receive d through a discrete sample was digitally recorded, and the first arrival time was picked automatically or manually. The distance between the transducers was measured with a built-in linear voltage displacement transformer. Calibration was performed with a series of acrylic cylinders wit h various thicknesses and a known $P_{-}$ -wave velocity of $2750\pm20\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . The system time delay, determined from the calibration, was subtracted from the picked arrival time to estimate the $P$ -wav e traveltime through the sample. The thickness of the sample (calculated by the linear voltage displacement transformer) was divided by the traveltime to calculate the $P.$ -wave velocity in meter s per second.  

# 9.7.3. Dual balance mass measurement  

The weights of wet and dry samples were determined to a precision of $0.005\mathrm{~g~}$ using two Mettle r Toledo electronic balances, with one acting as a reference. A standard weight of similar value t o the sample (within $\pm5\,\mathbf{g},$ ) was placed upon the reference balance to increase accuracy. A compute r averaging system was used to compensate for the ship's motion. The default setting of the balance s is 300 measurements (taking ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{min}$ ).  

# 9.7.4. Pycnometer volume measurement  

Dry sample volume was determined using a six-celled, custom-configured Micrometrics AccuPy c 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer (Figure F20). The precision of each cell is $1\%$ of th e full-scale volume. Volume measurement was preceded by three purges of the sample chambe r with helium warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run for each sample. A referenc e volume (two calibration spheres) was placed in one of the chambers during each set of measurements to check for instrument drift and systematic error (Figure F20). The reference volume wa s moved sequentially between chambers, such that each chamber was calibrated in turn every 5 set s of measurements. The volumes occupied by the Wheaton vials used for soft-sediment sample s were calculated before the cruise by dividing each vial’s weight by the average density of the via l glass. Dry mass and volume were measured after samples were heated in an oven at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ fo r $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ and allowed to cool in a desiccator for $3\textrm{h}$ . The procedures for the determination of thes e physical properties comply with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) designation (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). The fundamental relation and assumptions for the calculations of all physical properties parameters are discussed by Blum (1997) and summarize d below.  

# 9.7.5. Mass and volume calculation  

We measured wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)$ , and dry volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ . Salt precipitated in sediment pores during the drying process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $(M_{\mathrm{salt}})$ in the sample are given by the following:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}},\mathrm{and}}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[{\bf s}/(1-{\bf s})],}\end{array}
$$  

where s is the assumed seawater salinity $(3.5\%)$ corresponding to a pore water density $\left(\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}\right)$ o f $1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ of $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volum e of pore water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of salt $\left(V_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ , volume of solid s excluding salt $\left(V_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},}\\ &{\qquad\quad V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\rho_{\mathrm{pw}},}\\ &{\qquad M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),}\\ &{\qquad\quad V_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\rho_{\mathrm{salt}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}},
$$  

where $\mathrm{rm}=0.965$ is the ratio of mass between equal volumes of the fresh and seawater.  

# 9.7.6. Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as the ratio of mass of pore water to we t sediment (total) mass:  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $\left(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\rho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grain density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity $\left(\Phi\right)$ , and voi d ratio (VR) are calculated as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{\Pi}_{{\mathrm{wet}}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{{\mathrm{fry}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{{\mathrm{osolid}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{{\mathrm{obs}}}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},\mathsf{a n d}}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{{\mathrm{vR}}}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.}\end{array}
$$  

MAD properties reported in the Physical properties sections of all site chapters were calculate d with the MADMax shipboard program using the program’s predefined Method C. In Method C, the wet and dry bulk mass and dry bulk volume are measured, and the other physical propertie s are derived using the above equations.  

# 10. Downhole measurements  

Downhole measurements during Expedition 392 consisted of wireline logging runs and in situ formation temperature measurements at select holes.  

# 10.1. Wireline logging  

Downhole logs generate in situ measurements of physical, chemical, and structural properties o f the geologic formations penetrated by the borehole. Data are rapidly collected, continuously wit h depth, and measured in situ; data can be interpreted in terms of the stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, magnetic characteristics, and geochemical composition of the penetrated formations. Logging provides important data that characterize the borehole sections where core recovery i s incomplete or disturbed. Where core recovery is good, log and core data complement each othe r and may be interpreted jointly.  

Downhole logs provide measurements of physical properties of the formations on a scale that i s intermediate between those obtained from laboratory measurements on core samples and thos e from geophysical surveys. Downhole logs are useful in calibrating the interpretation of geophysical survey data (e.g., through the use of synthetic seismograms) and provide a necessary link fo r the integrated understanding of physical and chemical properties on different scales.  

Wireline logging during Expedition 392 was successfully performed at two of the four sites to ai d in core-log-seismic integration, fill in lithologic information across poorly recovered intervals, an d obtain oriented structural measurements. During wireline logging operations, the logs wer e recorded with Schlumberger logging tools combined into tool strings, which were lowered int o the hole after completion of coring operations. Several downhole logging methods and corresponding configurations of tool strings were used during Expedition 392 (Figure F22), includin g (1) the triple combination (triple combo) tool string, which measured NGR, density, and resistivit y along with porosity and MS; (2) the quadruple combination (quad combo) tool string, which measured seismic velocity along with the standard triple combo measurements minus porosity; (3) th e FMS-sonic tool string, which provided electrical resistivity images of the borehole wall and seismic velocities of the rock formation; and (4) the UBI and NGR combination tool string. Each too l string also contained an Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC) for communicatin g through the wireline to the Schlumberger multi-tasking acquisition and imaging system (MAXIS ) on the vessel. To help stabilize the borehole walls for logging, the boreholes were cleaned an d cleared using the drill bit (reamed), flushed of debris using drilling fluid, and unless a UBI run wa s scheduled, filled with seawater-based logging gel (sepiolite mud mixed with seawater an d weighted with barite; approximate density $=10.5\,\mathrm{lb/gal}$ or $1258\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{3})$ ). The BHA was pulled up t o ${\sim}70{-}150\ \mathrm{m}$ wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) to expose the deeper borehol e wall for wireline measurement and to stabilize the upper portion of the hole. The tool string wa s then lowered downhole on a seven-conductor wireline cable before being pulled up at constan t speed to provide continuous log measurements of several properties simultaneously.  

Each tool string deployment is termed a “logging run,” and data collection during each lowering o r hauling-up of the tool string constitutes a “pass”. The measurements during each run were performed using the following sequence of operations: (1) recording while the tool string was lowere d to the bottom of the hole (downpass), (2) high-resolution recording over selected depth interval s (where applicable), and (3) recording on the way up (main pass). Repeatable measurements help t o increase the accuracy and obtain better images using the FMS and UBI borehole images. The caliper log data can be acquired only on ascending (main) passes. Therefore, measurements tha t require information on the borehole diameter are less accurate for downpasses. Incoming dat a were recorded and monitored in real time on the Schlumberger Minimum Configuration MAXI S (MCM) logging computer. A wireline heave compensator (WHC) was used to minimize the effec t of the heave of the ship on the tool position in the borehole (see Wireline heave compensator).

found in Serra (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989, 1994), Rider (1996), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), and Ellis and Singer (2007). A complete online list of acronyms for the Schlumberger tools and measurement curves can be found at https://www.apps.slb.com/cmd.  

# 10.1.2. Downhole natural gamma radiation  

The HNGS measured borehole NGR during each logging run (Figure F22). The HNGS uses tw o bismuth germanate scintillation detectors and five-window spectroscopy to determine concentrations of potassium (in weight percent), thorium (in parts per million), and uranium (in parts pe r million) from the characteristic gamma ray energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $\ensuremath{^{232}}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series, which dominate the natural radiation spectrum. The computation of the elemental abundances uses a least-squares method of extracting U, Th, and K elemental concentration s from the spectral measurements. The HNGS filters out gamma ray energies below $500\;\mathrm{keV},$ eliminating sensitivity to bentonite or KCl in the drilling mud and improving measurement accuracy. The HNGS also provides a measure of the HSGR and uranium-free (or computed gamma ra y [HCGR]) that are measured in American Petroleum Institute gamma radiation units (gAPI). Th e HNGS response is influenced by the borehole diameter; therefore, the HNGS data are correcte d for borehole diameter variations during acquisition using caliper data.

An additional NGR sensor was housed in the EDTC at the top of each tool string (Figure F22). Th e EDTC is primarily used to communicate data to the vessel. The sensor includes a sodium iodid e scintillation detector that also measures the total NGR emission of the formation. It is not a spectral tool (it does not provide U, Th, or K concentrations), but it provides total intensity of gamm a radiation for each pass. The HNGS is normally included in the triple combo, quad combo, an d FMS-sonic tool strings to help precisely match depths between logging strings and passes and ca n additionally be used for core-log integration.  

# 10.1.3. Density and photoelectric effect  

Formation density was measured downhole using the Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sond e (HLDS). The HLDS contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source $(622\mathrm{~keV})$ and faroffset and near-offset gamma ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid that is pressed against th e borehole wall by a hydraulically activated decentralizing arm. Gamma rays emitted by the sourc e undergo Compton scattering, in which gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. The intensity of scattered gamma radiation is proportional to the electron density of the material, which is related to bulk density. Porosity may also be derived from this bulk density if the matri x (grain) density is known.  

The HLDS also measures the photoelectric effect (PEF), a measure of the photoelectric absorptio n of low-energy gamma radiation. PEF absorption is dependent on elemental composition/mineralogy and can be used as a lithology indicator. Photoelectric absorption occurs when the energy o f photons falls below $150\,\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of being repeatedly scattered by electrons in the formation. PEF is determined by comparing the counts from the far detector in the high-energy region, wher e only Compton scattering occurs, with those in the low-energy region, where count rates depen d on both reactions. Because PEF depends on the atomic number of the elements in the formatio n (heavier elements have higher PEF), the photoelectric absorption varies according to the chemica l composition of the minerals present and can be used for the identification of the mineral specie s in the formation. For example, the PEF of calcite is $5.08\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , illite is $3.03\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , quartz is 1.8 1 $\mathrm{\barn/e^{-}}$ , potassium feldspar is $2.86\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , and pure pyrite is 16.97 barn/e− (where barn $=10^{-24}$ $\mathbf{cm}^{2},$ ). A firm contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential for good quality HLDS log s because drilling mud entrained at the contact with borehole wall may result in underestimation o f density values. The density correction and the borehole size corrections should be applied for correct interpretation. In the deeper parts of the hole, the PEF log should be used with caution, especially in washouts, because barium (element with high atomic mass) contained in the logging mu d can bias the signal, even when the mud correction is applied. These data were recorded durin g wireline logging and are available at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) logging database (https://mlp.ldeo.columbia.edu/logdb/scientific_ocean_drilling) but are not discussed i n expedition site chapters.  

# 10.1.4. Porosity  

Formation porosity was measured downhole using the Accelerator Porosity Sonde (APS). Th e APS includes a minitron neutron generator, which produces fast $(14.4\mathrm{~MeV})$ neutrons, and fiv e neutron detectors (four for epithermal neutrons and one for slow thermal neutrons) positioned a t different distances from the minitron. The tool’s detectors count neutrons that arrive at the detectors after being scattered and slowed by collisions with atomic nuclei in the formation.  

The highest energy loss occurs when neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei, which have practicall y the same mass as the neutron (the neutrons bounce off heavier elements without losing muc h energy). If the hydrogen (or, equivalently, water molecule) concentration is low, as in low-porosit y formations, neutrons can travel farther before being captured and the count rates increase at th e detector. The opposite effect occurs in high-porosity formations where the water content is high. However, because hydrogen-containing minerals such as clays and hydrocarbons also contribut e to the measurement, the raw porosity value is often an overestimate.  

# 10.1.5. Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) tool provides six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation (including the borehole or mud resistivity and five measurements o f formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation). The tool sends a focuse d electrical current into the formation and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constan t drop in voltage across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurements. The array ha s one central (source) electrode and six electrodes above and below it, which serve alternatively a s focusing and returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role of these electrodes,  a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool is designe d so that all signals are measured simultaneously and the sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects i s reduced when crossing sharp beds thinner than the electrode spacing. The design of the HRLA, which eliminates the need for a surface reference electrode, improves formation resistivity evaluation compared to traditional dual induction and allows the full range of resistivity to be measured, from low (e.g., in high-porosity sediments) to high (e.g., in basalt). The HRLA needs to be ru n centralized in the borehole for optimal results, so knuckle joints were used to centralize the HRL A and allow the density and porosity tools to maintain good contact with the borehole wall.  

Calcite, silica, and hydrocarbons are electrical insulators, whereas ionic solutions like IW are conductors. Electrical resistivity, therefore, can be used to evaluate porosity for a given salinity an d resistivity of the IW. Clay-surface conduction also contributes to the resistivity values, but at hig h porosities this is a relatively minor effect.  

# 10.1.6. Seismic logging  

The Dipole Shear Sonic Imager (DSI) measures the transit times between sonic transmitters an d an array of eight receivers (Figure F22). It combines replicate measurements, thereby providing  a direct measurement of seismic velocity through formations that is relatively free from the effect s of formation damage and an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989). The DSI can also measur e seismic anisotropy when operating in anisotropic mode, which was used to obtain complementar y structural information at Site U1580.  

The DSI combines high-speed telemetry with simultaneous, 12-bit dynamic range digitization o f an eight-receiver array. The DSI incorporates both monopole and crossed-dipole transmitter s with an eight-station array of electronically configurable hydrophones for monopole and dipol e reception. Combining new dipole-based technology with the latest monopole developments int o one system provides the best method available today for obtaining borehole compressional an d shear wave slowness. The dipole source excites flexural, compressional, and shear head waves. Th e flexural waves are helpful to characterize shear velocity anisotropy and velocities in slow formations (with shear velocity less than in the borehole fluid) often encountered in deep-ocean drilling.  

The elastic anisotropy of formations can be characterized by shear wave splitting observations. I n a vertical borehole inside a transversely isotropic medium with a horizontal symmetry axis (e.g., because of vertical fractures), the shear wave splits into two waves propagating with differen t speeds. The polarization of the fast and slow shear wave components depends only on the fast an d slow direction of the formation and does not depend on the orientation of the source dipole. Fo r instance, the fast component aligns parallel to the plane of the fractures, whereas the slow wav e polarization is perpendicular to the plane of the fractures. The flexural wave also splits into fas t and slow components aligned with the formation anisotropy.  

Processing with the MAXIS wellsite unit displays full seismic waveforms and the component characteristics. The MAXIS high-speed array processor uses the slowness-time-coherence method t o determine compressional and shear wave slowness values.  

# 10.1.7. Formation MicroScanner  

The FMS provides high-resolution electrical resistivity–based images of borehole walls. The too l has four orthogonal arms and pads, each containing 16 button electrodes that are pressed agains t the borehole wall during logging. The electrodes are arranged in two diagonally offset rows o f eight electrodes each. A focused current is emitted from the button electrodes into the formation, and a return electrode is arranged near the top of the tool. Resistivity of the formation at the button electrodes is derived from the intensity of the current passing through the button electrodes.  

The processed FMS resistivity data are presented in the form of high-resolution images that revea l geologic structures of the borehole wall. Features such as bedding, stratification, fracturing, slum p folding, and bioturbation can be resolved (Luthi, 1990; Salimullah and Stow, 1992; Lovell et al., 1998). Because the images are oriented to magnetic north, further analysis can provide measurement of the dip and direction (azimuth) of planar features in the formation (e.g., Morris et al., 2009). In addition, when the corresponding dipping planar features can be identified in the recovered core samples, individual core pieces can be reoriented with respect to true north.  

The maximum extension of the caliper arms is $40.6~\mathrm{{cm}}$ (16 inches). In holes or sections of hole s with a diameter greater than this value, the pad contact at the end of the caliper arms will b e inconsistent and the FMS images may appear out of focus and too conductive. For example, irregular (rough) borehole walls adversely affect the images if contact with the wall is poor. Therefore, the standard procedure is to make two full main passes with the FMS to maximize the chance o f getting full borehole coverage using the pad sensor. This also helps to ensure that adequate dat a coverage is obtained because only ${\sim}30\%$ of a borehole with a diameter of $25\,\mathrm{cm}$ is imaged during  a single pass.  

# 10.1.8. Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde  

The Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde (MSS) is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by LDEO. I t measures the degree to which formations are magnetized when subjected to a magnetic field. Th e ease of magnetization is ultimately related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, an d mineralogy) of magnetic minerals in the formation, principally (titano)magnetite. These measurements provide one of the best methods for investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy an d lithology because the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructive and because differen t lithologies often have strongly contrasting susceptibilities. Additionally, the MSS can potentiall y be used to correlate logging data to cores because MS data are measured shipboard using th e WRMSL and SHMSL (see Physical properties) and in the paleomagnetism laboratory (see Paleomagnetism).  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}1$ inch resolution downhole susceptibility measurements. The MSS was run as the lowermost tool in the triple combo tool string, using a specially develope d data translation cartridge to enable the MSS to be run in combination with the Schlumberger tool s (Figure F22).  

MS data from both the high-resolution and deep-reading sensors are plotted as uncalibrate d instrument units (IU). The MSS reading responses are affected by temperature and borehole siz e (higher temperatures lead to higher susceptibility measurements). Preliminary processing wa s performed offshore to remove the temperature drift by calculating a least-squares polynomial fi t to the data and subtracting the calculated trend from the data set. When the MS signal in sedimen t is very low, the detection limits of the tool may be reached. For quality control and environmenta l correction, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $z_{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ -axis acceleration, and lowresolution borehole conductivity.  

# 10.1.9. Ultrasonic Borehole Imager  

The UBI features a high-resolution transducer that provides acoustic images of the borehole wall. The transducer emits ultrasonic pulses at a frequency of 250 or $500\;\mathrm{kHz}$ (low and high resolution, respectively) that are reflected at the borehole wall and then received by the same transducer. Th e amplitude and traveltime of the reflected signal are determined. Continuous rotation of the transducer and the upward motion of the tool produce a complete map of the borehole wall. The amplitude depends on the reflection coefficient of the borehole fluid/rock interface, the position of th e UBI tool in the borehole, the shape of the borehole, and the roughness of the borehole wall. Changes in the borehole wall roughness (e.g., at fractures intersecting the borehole) are responsible for the modulation of the reflected signal. Therefore, fractures or other variations in the character of the drilled rocks can be recognized in the amplitude image. The recorded traveltime imag e gives detailed information about the shape of the borehole, which allows calculation of one calipe r value of the borehole from each recorded traveltime. The amplitude and traveltime are recorde d together with a reference to magnetic north by means of a three-component magnetomete r included in the General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT), permitting the orientation of images.  

The orientation of the core with respect to the true north is possible by matching characteristi c lithologic and structural features observed both in the core and in the UBI images. The UBI oriented images can also be used to measure stress in the borehole through identification of borehol e breakouts and slip along fault surfaces penetrated by the borehole (Paillet and Kim, 1987). In a n isotropic, linearly elastic rock formation that is subjected to an anisotropic stress field, drilling  a subvertical borehole causes breakouts in the direction of the minimum principal horizontal stres s (Bell and Gough, 1983). Similarly, borehole breakouts may occur in elastically anisotropic (horizontal transverse isotropic [HTI]) rocks subjected to isotropic loading in the horizontal plane.  

# 10.1.10. Acceleration and inclinometry  

Three-component acceleration and magnetic field measurements were made with the GPI T during logging. The primary purpose of this tool, which incorporates a three-component accelerometer and a three-component magnetometer, is to determine the acceleration and orientation o f the UBI and FMS-sonic strings. This information allows the UBI and FMS images to be correcte d for irregular tool motion and to determine the dip and direction (azimuth) of features in th e images.  

# 10.2. Log data quality  

The main influences on log data quality are the condition of the borehole wall and the uncertaint y in the position of the logging tool along the borehole. The quality of wireline logging data, whic h require good contact with the borehole wall (i.e., FMS, density, and porosity), may be degraded i f the borehole diameter varies over short intervals with depth because of washouts, softer material, or ledges of harder material. The measurements with deep penetration into the rock formatio n (such as gamma radiation, resistivity, and sonic logging) do not require a tight contact with th e borehole wall and are generally less sensitive to the borehole conditions. “Bridged” sections, wher e the borehole diameter is much smaller than the bit size, may also bias the interpretation of downhole logging data. The data quality can be improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling flui d while drilling, flushing the borehole to remove debris, and logging as soon as possible after th e borehole is completed. During this expedition, the necessity of flushing dense basement rocks u p and out of the borehole required heavy fluid circulation.  

The borehole diameter, measured using the caliper tool, provides an indication of formatio n strength and its response to the artificial erosion associated with drilling operations. Additionally, caliper measurements can provide information on the present-day stress field inferred from th e borehole failure pattern induced by drilling. The method for estimating stress-field orientatio n uses the orthogonal borehole diameter measured with the calipers of the FMS-sonic tool strin g (called C1 and C2, respectively) and the caliper orientation provided by the GPIT (see Acceleration and inclinometry). Displaying this information along depth can provide evidence of breakouts or borehole ellipticity that can be interpreted in terms of maximum and minimum plan e stresses. A breakout signal typically shows an increase in diameter in one of the orthogonal calipers, whereas the other caliper remains close to the bit size. Theoretically, the greater diamete r highlights the minimum plane stress.  

The quality of the wireline depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determined from the length of the cable deployed from the winch on th e ship. The seafloor is identified on the NGR log by the abrupt reduction in gamma ray count at th e water/sediment interface (mudline). Discrepancies between the drilling depth and the wireline lo g depth may occur. Drilling depth discrepancies may be due to core expansion, incomplete cor e recovery, or incomplete heave compensation. Log depth discrepancies between successive run s occur because of incomplete heave compensation, incomplete correction for cable stretch, an d cable slip. Tidal changes in sea level affect both drilling and logging depths. These tidal range s were predicted to be less than $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$ on the Agulhas Plateau while logging Sites U1579 and U1580.  

# 10.2.1. Wireline heave compensator  

During wireline logging operations, the up-and-down motion of the ship (heave) causes a simila r motion of the downhole logging tools. If the amplitude of this motion is large, depth discrepancie s can be introduced into the logging data. The risk of damaging downhole instruments is als o increased. A WHC system was thus designed to compensate for the vertical motion of the ship an d maintain a steady motion of the logging tools to ensure high-quality logging data acquisition (Li u et al., 2013; Iturrino et al., 2013). The WHC uses a vertical accelerometer (motion reference uni t [MRU]) positioned under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertica l motion of the ship with respect to the seafloor. It then adjusts the length of the wireline by varyin g the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes to minimize downhol e tool motion. Real-time measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleration are mad e simultaneously by the MRU and the EDTC, respectively. An LDEO-developed software packag e allows these data to be analyzed and compared in real time, displaying the actual motion of th e logging tool string and enabling monitoring of the efficiency of the compensator and using thi s information for the interpretation of logging data.  

# 10.2.2. Logging data flow and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real time and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500. Initial logging data were referenced to the wireline log depth below rig floo r (WRF) depth scale. After logging was completed, the data were transferred onshore to the LDE O Borehole Research Group (LDEO-BRG), where standard data processing took place. The mai n part of the processing workflow was to identify the depth of the seafloor based on steps in NG R and to match the depths of each individual run and pass to obtain a consistent WMSF depth scale. Additional minor corrections were applied to individual tools and logs (e.g., FMS and UBI imager y was corrected for tool acceleration, including stick and slip). The documentation for the logs wit h an assessment of log quality was prepared, and the data were exported to ASCII format for th e conventional logs and GIF format for the FMS and UBI images. The Schlumberger Petrel/Techlo g software package is used for most of the processing of the collected wireline logging data. The dat a were transferred back to the ship within a few days of logging, and this processed data set wa s made available to the science party (in ASCII and DLIS formats) through the shipboard loggin g database and shipboard servers. Downhole data from three sites are available through the LDE O logging database.  

# 10.3. In situ temperature measurements  

In situ formation temperature measurements were collected during Expedition 392 using th e APCT-3 tool at Site U1579 on the Agulhas Plateau and Site U1581 in the Transkei Basin, where th e APC system was deployed. The APCT-3 fits directly into the coring shoe of the APC system an d consists of a battery pack, data logger, and a platinum resistance-temperature device calibrate d over a temperature range of $0^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The nominal accuracy of the APCT-3 temperature measurements is $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Before entering the borehole, the APCT-3 tool is first stopped at the mudline for $5~\mathrm{min}$ to thermally equilibrate with bottom water temperatures. Occasionally during Expedition 392, the lowes t temperature recorded during the run was used instead of the average temperature at the mudlin e as an estimate of the bottom water temperature because it was more repeatable and the botto m water is expected to have the lowest temperature in the profile. When the APC system advance s into the formation, there is an instantaneous temperature rise from frictional heating. This hea t gradually dissipates into the surrounding sediment as the temperature at the APCT-3 equilibrate s toward the temperature of the sediment. After the APC system penetrated the sediment, it wa s held in place for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ while the APCT-3 tool recorded the temperature of the cutting shoe ever y second.  

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment was estimated by applying a mathematical heatconduction model to the temperature decay record (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The syntheti c thermal decay curve for the APCT-3 tool is a function of the geometry and thermal properties o f the probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The equilibrium temperature was estimated by fitting a parameterized theoretical temperature decay curve to th e observed temperature time series (Pribnow et al., 2000). The data quality depends on the assumption that the temperature equilibration curve was not disturbed by other factors, such as shi p heave pulling the APC up from full penetration.  

The APCT-3 temperature data were combined with thermal conductivity measurements obtaine d from the whole-round and split-core sections to obtain heat flow values using the Bullard metho d (Bullard, 1954). Slopes and intercepts of temperature versus depth, thermal conductivity versu s depth, and temperature versus thermal resistance are computed with linear regression. Uncertainties are quantified as standard deviations.
