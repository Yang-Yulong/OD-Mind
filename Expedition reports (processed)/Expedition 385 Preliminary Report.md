# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 38 5 drilled organic-rich sediments with sill intrusions on the flankin g regions and in the northern axial graben in Guaymas Basin, a youn g marginal rift basin in the Gulf of California. Guaymas Basin is characterized by a widely distributed, intense heat flow and widesprea d off-axis magmatism expressed by a dense network of sill intrusion s across the flanking regions, which is in contrast to classical midocean ridge spreading centers. The numerous off-axis sills provid e multiple transient heat sources that mobilize buried sedimentar y carbon, in part as methane and other hydrocarbons, and drive hydrothermal circulation. The resulting thermal and geochemical gradients shape abundance, composition, and activity of the dee p subsurface biosphere of the basin.  

Drill sites extend over the flanking regions of Guaymas Basin, covering a distance of ${\sim}81\,\mathrm{km}$ from the from the northwest to th e southeast. Adjacent Sites U1545 and U1546 recovered the oldes t and thickest sediment successions (to $\mathord{\sim}540$ meters below seafloo r [mbsf]; equivalent to the core depth below seafloor, Method  A [CSF-A] scale), one with a thin sill (a few meters in thickness) nea r the drilled bottom (Site U1545), and one with a massive, deeply buried sill $(\sim\!356\!-\!430\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ that chemically and physically affects th e surrounding sediments (Site U1546). Sites U1547 and U1548, located in the central part of the northern Guaymas Basin segment, were drilled to investigate a $600\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wide circular mound (bathymetric high) and its periphery. The dome-like structure is outline d by a ring of active vent sites called Ringvent. It is underlain by a remarkably thick sill at shallow depth (Site U1547). Hydrotherma l gradients steepen at the Ringvent periphery (Holes U1548A– U1548C), which in turn shifts the zones of authigenic carbonat e precipitation and of highest microbial cell abundance toward shallower depths. The Ringvent sill was drilled several times and yielde d remarkably diverse igneous rock textures, sediment–sill interfaces, and hydrothermal alteration, reflected by various secondary minerals in veins and vesicles. Thus, the Ringvent sill became the target o f an integrated sampling and interdisciplinary research effort that included geological, geochemical, and microbiological specialties. The thermal, lithologic, geochemical, and microbiological contrast s between the two deep northwestern sites (U1545 and U1546) an d the Ringvent sites (U1547 and U1548) form the scientific centerpiece of the expedition. These observations are supplemented by results from sites that represent attenuated cold seepage conditions i n the central basin (Site U1549), complex and disturbed sediment s overlying sills in the northern axial trough (Site U1550), terrigenou s sedimentation events on the southeastern flanking regions (Sit e U1551), and hydrate occurrence in shallow sediments proximal t o the Sonora margin (Site U1552).  

The scientific outcomes of Expedition 385 will (1) revise longheld assumptions about the role of sill emplacement in subsurfac e carbon mobilization versus carbon retention, (2) comprehensivel y examine the subsurface biosphere of Guaymas Basin and its responses and adaptations to hydrothermal conditions, (3) redefin e hydrothermal controls of authigenic mineral formation in sediments, and (4) yield new insights into many geochemical and geophysical aspects of both architecture and sill–sediment interactio n in a nascent spreading center. The generally high quality and hig h degree of completeness of the shipboard datasets present opportunities for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaboration s during shore-based studies. In comparison to Deep Sea Drillin g Project Leg 64 to Guaymas Basin in 1979, sophisticated drillin g strategies (for example, the advanced piston corer [APC] and halflength APC systems) and numerous analytical innovations hav e greatly improved sample recovery and scientific yield, particularl y in the areas of organic geochemistry and microbiology. For example, microbial genomics did not exist 40 y ago. However, these technical refinements do not change the fact that Expedition 385 will i n many respects build on the foundations laid by $\mathrm{Leg\64}$ for understanding Guaymas Basin, regardless of whether adjustments are required in the near future.  

# Introduction  

Guaymas Basin is a young marginal rift basin characterized b y active seafloor spreading and rapid sediment deposition, includin g organic-rich sediments derived from biologically highly productiv e overlying waters and terrigenous sediments from nearby continental margins (van Andel, 1964) (Figure F1). The combination of active seafloor spreading and rapid sedimentation within a narro w basin results in a dynamic environment where linked physical, chemical, and biological processes regulate the cycling of sedimentary carbon (Figure F2). This continuum of interrelating processe s from magma to microbe motivated IODP Expedition 385 and is reflected in its title, “Guaymas Basin Tectonics and Biosphere.”  

Formation of new igneous crust in Guaymas Basin involves th e intrusion of sills into sedimentary sequences (Einsele et al., 1980; Saunders et al., 1982). Heat introduced by intruding sills release s $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4},$ low-molecular-weight organic acids, and petroleu m from organic-rich sediments and drives fluid advection through sillsediment sequences that can release these thermogenic product s toward the sediment/seawater interface (Von Damm et al., 1985; Whelan and Hunt, 1982; Kawka and Simoneit, 1987; Didyk an d Simoneit, 1989; Martens, 1990; Peter et al., 1991). Thermal an d chemical gradients linked to gas and fluid seepage create environments rich in chemical energy that supports microbial life at an d below the seafloor (Teske et al., 2014). These microbes in turn participate in chemical transformations that influence the stability an d transport of carbon in subsurface biospheres. Collectively, thes e physical, chemical, and biologic processes have implications for th e exchange of heat and mass between the lithosphere and overlyin g seawater column and may determine the long-term fate of carbo n accumulation in organic-rich sediments in new ocean basins.  

# Background  

# Geological and microbiological roles in carbon cycling  

The Gulf of California is a narrow sea that formed through continental rifting between the Baja California Peninsula and the western margin of mainland Mexico (Figure F1, inset), starting when th e Baja Peninsula began to separate from North America at ${\sim}12{-}15$ Ma (Stock and Lee, 1994). At present, the gulf is made up of a number of narrow spreading segments separated by transform fault s that together represent the northern extent of the East Pacific Ris e plate boundary (Figure F1, inset). Most of these segments hav e rifted  to  completion,  including  the  northern  Guaymas  Basi n spreading segment, where seismic observations indicate that continental rupture was complete by $\sim\!7\mathrm{~Ma}$ and that new igneous crus t formation has been accommodating Pacific/North American plat e motion since that time (Lizarralde et al., 2007; Miller and Lizarralde, 2013).  

The combination of distinct sedimentation patterns as well a s active tectonics and magmatism in the Gulf of California creates  a rich environment for scientific discovery. Sedimentation and sediment thickness in the basins of the Gulf of California vary substantially from the very thick $(\mathsf{>}4\,\,\mathsf{k m})$ sediments blanketing Wagner, Tiburón, and Delfin Basins in the northernmost part of the gul f (e.g., Persaud et al., 2003; González-Fernández et al., 2005) t o Alarcón Basin in the southern part of the gulf, where the spreadin g center is only thinly sedimented (e.g., Sutherland et al., 2012). Th e northern Guaymas Basin segment, the primary focus of Expeditio n 385, lies between these extremes, and both sediment deposition an d sediment type vary significantly within the segment. Sedimentatio n in the northwestern half of the segment is dominantly biogenic an d driven by highly productive waters with minor terrigenous inpu t from the arid Baja California Peninsula. In contrast, sedimentatio n in the southeastern portion of the basin is dominated by terrigenou s input from the Yaqui River delta system of the Sonora margin, an d the ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ deep graben that defines the plate boundary in this segment tends to confine the turbidites from the Yaqui system to th e southeastern horst region.  

Scientific Drilling in Guaymas Basin has a profound history. Sites drilled in Guaymas Basin during Deep Sea Drilling Projec t (DSDP) Leg 64 were motivated by both accessing the sediment s themselves and by investigating the interaction of these sediment s with magmatic processes. DSDP Sites 479 and 480 on the Sonor a margin “focused on the paleoceanography of laminated, homogeneous, diatom-rich, anoxic sediments within the zone of low oxygen” typical of this setting (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982). Site s 477, 478, and 481 within the spreading segments were drilled to investigate “the nature of young ocean crust in the Guaymas Basin, where high accumulation rates are common and variable high hea t flow indicates active rifting and hydrothermal activity” (Kelts et al., 1982; Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982). The scientific results fro m Leg 64 contributed substantially to our understanding of the hydrothermal and geochemical processes that accompany igneous intrusions into sediments (Curray et al., 1979, 1982; Einsele et al., 1980; Gieskes et al. 1982). Leg 64 results documented important change s in the sediments due to sill intrusion, including the expulsion o f pore fluids and decreased porosity (Einsele, 1982), the breakdow n and creation of organic compounds (Galimov and Simoneit, 1982; Simoneit and Bode, 1982), and the dissolution of primary minera l phases and the formation of secondary ones (Kastner, 1982), demonstrating that both temperature and vigor of fluid flo w through the alteration zone are important factors in alteration processes.  

At the time of Leg 64, it was believed that active magmatic emplacement was confined to the spreading centers (Einsele et al., 1980), and most of the subsequent work studying high-temperatur e biogeochemical processes in Guaymas Basin has been focused o n the axial troughs. There is now strong evidence that magmatic intrusion into sediments occurs broadly throughout the basin, t o more than $40\;\mathrm{km}$ off axis (Lizarralde et al., 2011) (Figure F3). Magmatism that is not confined to the spreading axis but instead is distributed throughout Guaymas Basin challenges models for th e natural sequestration of carbon in sediments, the formation of oceanic crust at the earliest evolutionary stages of a spreading center, and life in the subsurface in marginal rift basins. Broadly distribute d magmatism expands the fraction of organic-rich sediments tha t may be subject to thermal alteration and associated carbon release, potentially limiting the role of rift basin sedimentation in the longterm removal of atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ (Figure F2). Differences in subsurface hydrology and thermal gradients in off-axis environment s relative to the fault-bounded spreading center expand the range o f environments that may support hydrocarbon generation and microbial populations in the subsurface.  

The impact of sill-driven thermogenic sediment alteration o n carbon cycling extends to regions of large igneous province (LIP ) formation. It has been postulated that the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was driven by widespread carbon releas e caused by sill intrusion into existing sedimentary basins during th e formation of the North Atlantic Igneous Province (Svensen et al., $2004;$ ; Higgins and Schrag, 2006). Sill–sediment processes have similarly been implicated in other global-scale environmental crises, fo r example by linking the Permian–Triassic and Early Jurassic extinctions to the Siberian Traps and the Karoo Traps LIP events (Svense n et al., 2004, 2007, 2009a, 2009b; Sell et al., 2015; Galerne and Hasenclever, 2019), respectively. In addition, Cretaceous ocean anoxi a have been linked to concurrent submarine magmatism such as i n the Caribbean (Turgeon and Creaser, 2008; Bralower, 2008). Guaymas Basin provides a modern analog to many aspects of thes e events.  

The fate of carbon deposited in Guaymas Basin and in simila r marginal basins across the world during punctuated episodes of regional magmatism depends on the relative efficiencies of interactin g physical, chemical, and microbial processes, some working to sequester carbon and others working to release carbon back to th e ocean and the atmosphere (Figure F2). The physical and chemical processes immediately driven by a sill intrusion event include thermal heating of sediments by the intruding sill, thermal cracking o f organic compounds within sediments, mineral dehydration and dissolution, pore space desiccation, contact metamorphism and potentially partial melting of the host sediment, and hydrothermal flui d convection (Simoneit et al., 1978, 1981; Simoneit and Lonsdale, 1982; Saxby and Stephenson, 1987; Kastner, 1982; Fisher and Narasimhan, 1991; Aarnes et al., 2010, 2011, 2015; Iyer et al. 2013, 2017; Galerne and Hasenclever, 2019). The dominant thermogenic alteration products resulting from sills intruding into organic-rich sediments are methane and $C O_{2}$ (Galimov and Simoneit, 1982; Seewal d et al., 1990). For the Jurassic Karoo LIP event, quantitative modelin g recently estimated a total degassing of ${\sim}22.3\ 10^{3}$ Gt of thermogeni c methane during the 500,000 y of Karoo magmatism, showing tha t degassing rates peaking above $100\ \mathrm{Mt/y}$ could be sustained over  a period of 5,000–60,000 y (Galerne and Hasenclever, 2019).  

The extent and function of the deep subsurface biosphere i n these settings has not been probed since Leg 64 demonstrated microbial methanogenesis in Guaymas Basin subsurface sediments; this was the first time that microbiological studies were performe d during a deep-sea drilling expedition (Oremland et al., 1982; Galimov and Simoneit, 1982; Whelan et al., 1988). Because the presen t project has a strong microbiological research component, we briefl y summarize how studies of pure cultures and natural enrichment s from near-surface hydrothermal sediments of Guaymas Basin, usually obtained by submersibles, have outlined the thermal boundaries for microbial processes in Guaymas Basin sediments. At th e hyperthermophilic end of the spectrum, the $\mathrm{{H_{2}/C O_{2}}}$ -dependen t methanogen Methanopyrus kandleri survives at $110^{\circ}C$ under atmospheric pressure (Kurr et al., 1991) and at $122^{\circ}C$ under deep-se a pressure (Takai et al., 2008). Sulfur‐reducing Thermococcales thriv e near $100^{\circ}C$ (Teske et al., 2009; Edgcomb et al., 2007), and microbial sulfate reducers are active near $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Elsgaard et al., 1994; Jørgense n et al., 1990; Weber and Jørgensen, 2002) and potentially near $120^{\circ}C$ (Jørgensen et al., 1992). These hyperthermophiles all depend on hydrogen as an electron donor, which leads to selective hydrogen depletion in the hydrothermal subsurface (Wankel et al., 2011). Recently, anaerobic methane‐oxidizing archaea that are active a t temperatures as high as $75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ were identified in Guaymas Basin an d other vent sites (Holler et al., 2011; Biddle et al., 2012; Merkel et al., 2012; McKay et al., 2016). At cooler, off‐axis locations and in the upper sediment column, less extreme microbiota gain a foothold, increasing overall microbial biomass and activity and broadening th e chemical spectrum of microbially catalyzed reactions. For example, alkane‐degrading syntrophic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteri a degrading with a temperature preference of $50^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ thrive i n Guaymas Basin sediments (Rüter et al., 1994; Kniemeyer et al., 2007; Laso-Pérez et al., 2016; Krukenberg et al., 2016) and are detectabl e with gene assays for anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation (Callagha n et al., 2010). Finally, surface sediments harbor microbial mats of sulfide-oxidizing filamentous bacteria (Gundersen et al., 1992; McKa y et al., 2012) and mesophilic aromatics degraders (Goetz and Jannasch, 1993; Gutierrez et al., 2015). In general, microbial communities  in  surficial  sediments  of  Guaymas  Basin  overla p compositionally with those in seeps and cold subsurface sediment s (Teske et al., 2002; Teske, 2006). Collectively, these diversified microbial communities of Guaymas Basin are capable of assimilatin g fossil organic carbon into microbial biomass (Pearson et al., 2005). The habitat preference, biogeography, and activity patterns of thes e Guaymas Basin microorganisms remain to be investigated in th e subsurface. We should also remain open to the possibility of findin g new organisms that currently have no precedent.  

# Site surveys and seismic studies  

Expedition 385 is supported by site survey data acquired on fiv e ships during cruises led by chief scientists from three countrie s (USA, Germany, and Mexico). The three seismic datasets were acquired during R/V Maurice Ewing Cruise EW0210 (2002), R/ V Sonne Cruise SO-241 (2015), and R/V Alpha Helix Cruise AH160 5 (2016). The Cruise EW0210 seismic data, acquired with a $6~\mathrm{km}$ streamer (led by Chief Scientist Daniel Lizarralde, Woods Hol e Oceanographic Institution, USA), provided seismic-velocity contro l for time-to-depth estimations at all Expedition 385 sites. Ultimately, five of eight sites drilled during Expedition 385 were propose d based on features observed in the migrated stack of the transec t (Figure F3). The seismic feature observed at Site U1548 motivate d the hypothesis that active magmatism occurs at substantial distances from the plate boundary. From this, it follows that active, methane-hosted seafloor communities are expected to be presen t throughout Guaymas Basin, a hypothesis that was tested through  a deep-tow multibeam survey conducted during R/V Atlantis Cruis e AT15-54 in 2009. By means of deep-tow backscatter and compressed high-intensity radar pulse (CHIRP) subbottom images, seafloor  photography,  and  water  chemistry  samples,  this  cruis e identified multiple methane-hosted seafloor communities at offaxis locations (Lizarralde et al., 2011). The observations fro m Cruise AT15-54 motivated several drill sites for which no seismi c data were available. The second seismic survey was performe d during Cruise SO-241 in 2015 (led by Chief Scientist Christian Berndt, GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany). The transect of these very high quality data crossed som e but not all of the proposed drill sites. The third seismic survey (le d by Chief Scientist Antonio González-Fernández, Centro de Investigación Científica y de Educación Superior de Ensenada [CICESE], Mexico) acquired seismic crossing lines through all of the propose d drill sites during Cruise AH-1605.  

Sites initially selected based on the Cruise EW0210 multichannel seismic profiles (Lizarralde et al., 2007) and the observation s from Cruise AT15-54 (Lizarralde et al., 2011) were adjusted base d on results from the new seismic lines and two additional site surve y cruises by the R/V El Puma (7–27 October 2014) and Atlantis (9–2 7 December 2016). The 2014 El Puma cruise (led by Chief Scientis t Carlos  Mortera,  Universidad  Nacional  Autónoma  de  Méxic o [UNAM], Mexico) performed a detailed bathymetric survey of th e central portion of the northern Guaymas Basin spreading segmen t and collected sediment gravity cores $3{-}5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ in length from th e northwestern side of the northern spreading segment, the Sonor a margin, and the circular seep structure called Ringvent. These core s provided shallow subsurface sediments near several proposed Expedition 385 drill sites and enabled a preliminary geochemical an d microbial characterization of the proposed off-axis drill sites. Numerous shallow sediment cores and seafloor grab samples were als o collected during Sonne Cruise 241 (Núñez-Useche et al., 2018; Geilert et al., 2018). A major discovery from that cruise was a large, active hydrothermal vent field located on the southeastern edge o f the northern Guaymas Basin graben (Berndt et al., 2016). The las t site survey cruise on Atlantis studied the Ringvent sites (U1547 an d U1548) with HOV Alvin Dives 4864 and 4865 and AUV Sentry Dives 410 and 411 (led by Chief Scientist Andreas Teske, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA) providing faunal observations, microbial analyses, thermal gradient measurements i n surficial sediments, and mineralogic and pore water chemistry analyses that demonstrated this site is hydrothermally active (Teske e t al., 2019). These results were used to further characterize the proposed Ringvent drill sites and to adjust their locations.  

# Site summaries Site U1545  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1545 (proposed Site GUAYM-01B) is located ${\sim}52\ \mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben of the northern Guaymas Basi n spreading segment (Figure F1). The primary objective for this site i s shared with Site U1546, located just $1.1~\mathrm{km}$ away (Figure F4). Th e objective is to compare the sediments at two sites that are very clos e to each other but that, as seismic data suggest, have had very different degrees of alteration from intruding sills. Precruise seismic survey data indicate an undisturbed sedimentary succession at Sit e U1545 from the seafloor to ${\sim}2.8$ s two-way traveltime (TWT ) $\cdot{\sim}540$ meters below seafloor [mbsf]), where an interpreted sill wa s observed. In contrast, seismic data show the same stratigraphic sequence at Site U1546 to be substantially disturbed between an apparent unconformity at ${\sim}2.3\mathrm{~s~}$ TWT and a bright reflector at ${\sim}2.6\;{\ s}$ TWT $({\sim}350\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ , which was interpreted to be a sill intrusion. Sill s deeper than 2.6 s TWT were also interpreted at Site U1546. Thus, the main objective of Site U1545 is to provide a reference sedimentary succession for comparison with Site U1546, enabling the quantification of thermal and hydrothermal alteration driven by sill intrusion at Site U1546.

We cored three holes at Site U1545. Hole U1545A is located a t $27^{\circ}38.2325^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $111^{\circ}53.3406^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1593.5\:\mathrm{m}$ . In Hol e U1545A, we used the advanced piston corer (APC), half-lengt h APC (HLAPC), and extended core barrel (XCB) systems to advanc e from the seafloor to a final depth of 503.3 mbsf with a recovery o f $389.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(77\%)$ . We made formation temperature measurements a t several depths using the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT3) tool and the Sediment Temperature 2 (SET2) tool. We terminate d coring based on the safety monitoring protocol for hydrocarbo n gases after measuring a low methane/ethane $(C_{1}/C_{2})$ value. We the n conducted downhole measurements in Hole U1545A: (1) recover y of borehole fluid with the Kuster Flow Through Sampler (Kuste r FTS) and (2) downhole logging with the triple combination (tripl e combo) and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic logging too l strings. In Hole U1545B, located at $27^{\circ}38.2301\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}53.3295^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ i n a water depth of $1594.2\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , we deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XC B systems. Cores penetrated from the seafloor to a final depth o f 387.3 mbsf and recovered $340.1\;\mathrm{m}$ $(88\%)$ . Formation temperatur e measurements were carried out at several depths with the APCT- 3 and  SET2  tools.  In  Hole  U1545C,  located  at $27^{\circ}38.2420^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $111^{\circ}53.3290^{\prime}\mathrm{{W}}$ in a water depth of $1595.0\;\mathrm{m},$ we deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems to advance from the seafloor to a fina l depth of 329.0 mbsf with a recovery of $324.6\;\mathrm{m}$ $(99\%)$ . Hole s U1545B and U1545C were dedicated to extensive microbial an d biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) downhole on all cores to monitor drillin g fluid (seawater) contamination (House et al., 2003; Lever et al., 2006). During the first two days of coring in Hole U1545B, the pac e of coring was adjusted to accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducted on the core receiving platform. A total o f $232.1\,\mathrm{h},$ , or 9.7 days, were spent at Site U1545. Cores, penetratio n depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Sit e U1545 are listed in Table T1.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The deepest record of sediments and igneous rocks was recovered in Hole U1545A from a curated depth of 507.27 mbsf, wherea s recovery reached 387.23 and 328.88 mbsf in Holes U1545B an d U1545C, respectively. Site U1545 is composed of late to middl e Pleistocene sediments that are primarily a mixture of laminated diatom ooze and clay minerals (Figure F5). Minor components encompass nannofossils and silt-sized siliciclastic particles and authigeni c minerals. The latter include pyrite and clay- to silt-sized carbonat e (micrite) particles (mainly dolomite) that occur both scattered i n the sediment as well as concentrated in discrete nodules/concretions with different degrees of lithification. Downhole changes i n lithology are not significant enough to require a division of the sit e into more than one lithostratigraphic unit (Unit I). However, th e presence of minor yet significant downhole lithologic change s and/or changes in sediment induration and physical propertie s prompt the division of Unit I into four subunits (Subunits IA, IB, IC, and ID). These differences arise mainly from different degrees an d types of diagenetic processes and overprinting that have resulted i n the formation of authigenic minerals (e.g., micrite in Subunit IB ) and/or the selective dissolution of sedimentary particles (e.g., dissolution of diatoms in Subunits IC and ID). The transitions betwee n the subunits are gradual, occur over more than one core, and ma y be locally obscured in low-recovery zones. The mixed biogenic an d siliciclastic nature of the sediments and the abundance of fine lamination in the sedimentary record suggest that the depositional environment at Site U1545 has remained essentially hemipelagic an d suboxic to anoxic throughout the middle to late Pleistocene. Igneous rocks of subvolcanic texture and basaltic composition were encountered as an intrusive sheet in the sedimentary section near th e bottom of Hole U1545A.  

# Igneous petrology and alteration  

In Hole U1545A, we cored a basalt layer below siliceous claystone and recovered a total core length of $^{81}\,{\mathrm{cm}}$ from a top depth o f 482.17 mbsf. The mafic sill intrusion is identified as part of Subuni t ID. It is dominantly composed of aphyric basalt. A ${\sim}3\,\mathrm{\cm}$ thic k baked layer of carbonate metasedimentary rock lies above the uppe r margin of the sill, defining the sediment/sill contact. The dark gra y aphyric basalt has an aphanitic texture with a micro- to cryptocrystalline inequigranular igneous mineral assemblage consisting o f plagioclase, pyroxene, and accessory Fe-Ti oxides. Moderate t o sparse vesicularity decreases overall with depth. Plagioclase phenocrysts are rarely present $(<\!1\;\mathrm{vol}\%)$ ). The entire length of the core d basalt is texturally and mineralogically homogeneous except for a  1 cm thick, carbonate-rich vesicular basalt in the middle of the section. The vesicular basalt has an overall coarser grain size and n o microphenocrysts. The entire recovered section shows moderat e alteration that is consistent with hydrothermal fluid–rock interaction. Plagioclase grains are slightly altered to sericite, whereas pyroxenes remain as pseudomorphs that are totally replaced b y secondary magnetite and clay minerals. Vesicles are mostly fille d with secondary minerals. These precipitates are dominantly carbonates (e.g., calcite and dolomite) and clay minerals (e.g., smectite ) with minor magnetite and pyrite. Observed veins are predominantly filled with carbonates, pyrite, and zeolites, giving them  a white color with black and golden patches.  

# Structural geology  

Tilted sedimentary beds and deformation structures are foun d in some depth intervals in lithostratigraphic Subunits IA–ID. Th e folds and tilted beds observed in two depth intervals abov e 109 mbsf are attributed to two slump events that caused soft-sediment deformation. At greater depth, some preexisting brittle fractures are found. Some of the layers in Subunit IC exhibit fracture s with apparent dips of $60^{\circ}$ relative to the core axis. The mafic sill (Subunit ID) has mineralized fractures that are subvertical in orientation.  

# Biostratigraphy  

At  Site  U1545,  preservation  of  calcareous  nannofossils  i s good/moderate to poor throughout the entire sedimentary sequence. In general, preservation is good/moderate in samples wit h abundant or common nannofossils and poor in those with frequen t or rare nannofossils. Preservation is better in samples taken fro m intervals above the core catcher than in core catcher samples. Overall, marine diatoms were observed to be dominant/abundant wit h good/moderate preservation down to $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf and barren to th e bottom of Holes U1545A and U1545B as a result of silica diagenesis. One biostratigraphic datum was recognized, and two additional, stratigraphically underlying datums were estimated based on th e absence of the zonal markers in the generally continuous successio n from the late to middle Pleistocene. The lowermost occurrence (i.e., first occurrence datum) of Emiliania huxleyi dates the upper part o f the sediment sequence to Holocene–middle Pleistocene (0–0.2 9 Ma; Hole $\mathrm{U}1545\mathrm{A}=0{-}248.6$ mbsf; Hole $\mathrm{U1545B}=0{-}249.6~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ), whereas the absence of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa (calcareou s nannofossil) and Fragilariopsis reinholdii (marine diatom) in samples examined from the underlying interval indicates a middle Pleistocene age (younger than $0.44\mathrm{\Ma}_{.}$ ) for the bottom of both holes. Hole U1545C was not sampled. The estimated average sedimentation rate is 863 m/My $(86.3\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

Alternating field (AF) demagnetization up to $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ was conducted with the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) on al l archive-half sections from Hole U1545A. The drilling-induce d overprint was successfully removed from APC and HLAPC core s (from the seafloor to ${\sim}280~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) upon demagnetization. Inclination values after demagnetization at $20\,\mathrm{~mT~}$ cluster around $46^{\circ}.$ , which is similar to the expected geocentric axial dipole (GAD) inclination at the latitude of the site $\left(46.3^{\circ}\right)$ . This is supported by a detailed analysis of the remanence of discrete samples. The drillinginduced overprint is removed by $10~\mathrm{mT},$ and the characteristic remanent magnetization is consistent with the SRM measurements. Unfortunately, XCB cores were overprinted and too disturbed t o yield reliable paleomagnetic data, and no discrete samples could b e collected. Cores 385-U1545A-1H through 50F (down to ${\sim}280\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) were assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younger tha n $0.78\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archivehalf sections decreases from ${\sim}50$ to 80 mbsf in a depth interval tha t corresponds to the sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ). Th e magnetic mineral assemblage becomes coarser, and low-coercivit y minerals, likely (titano)magnetite, are dominant. In addition, AF demagnetization up to $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ was carried out on archive-half section s from Hole U1545B (Cores 385-U1545B-46F through 60F) to increase the depth interval of paleomagnetic measurements o n HLAPC cores. This allowed us to make a tentative correlation between Holes U1545A and U1545B based on the NRM and poin t magnetic susceptibility that gives a possible offset of about $3\;\mathrm{m}$ between holes. No paleomagnetic measurements were carried out i n Hole U1545C.  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 80 interstitial water (IW) samples were collected i n Holes U1545A–U1545C. Sulfate concentration decreases to almos t zero and methane concentration sharply increases at around 5 0 mbsf. The depth interval over which these changes are observed i s referred to as the SMTZ. Biogeochemical processes from the seafloor down to 50 mbsf, including organoclastic sulfate reductio n and anaerobic oxidation of methane, led to the accumulation of byproducts such as sulfide, ammonium, and phosphate; a corresponding sharp increase in alkalinity; and a continuous increase in bromide. The significant decrease in calcium concentration toward th e top of Subunit IB may correspond to the precipitation of authigeni c carbonates. Chloride, silica, strontium, lithium, boron, and bariu m contents also continuously increase as a result of the dissolution o f minerals such as silicates. The drop in alkalinity and magnesium a t $\mathord{\sim}70\mathrm{-}80$ mbsf could correspond to the precipitation of authigeni c dolomite, whereas the increase in calcium concentration could reflect the dissolution of carbonate phases other than dolomite. Ammonium, calcium, silica, strontium, lithium, boron, and bariu m concentrations continuously increase between 220 and 320 mbsf. The maximum concentrations of silica and ammonium are seen a t \~290 mbsf, below which depth the profiles start to reverse. Aroun d the same depth, bromide, lithium, boron, strontium, barium, an d sodium sharply increase and potassium sharply decreases. Belo w ${\sim}320$ mbsf, a number of significant variations (increase or decrease ) are observed for many dissolved elements ( $\mathrm{K}^{+}.$ , B, $\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , etc.) an d are possibly related to a combination of diagenetic processes (silic a diagenesis, smectite to illite transformation, or the dissolution/precipitation of other minerals) as well as thermally driven fluid migration through this interval (vertical and/or horizontal influences o f nearby sills). Alternatively, the variable data excursions may reflec t less reliability due to erratic contamination of sediment derive d from drilling-induced generation of core fragments that mix wit h drilling mud.  

# Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1545, we performed analyses of gas and solid-phas e samples. For Hole U1545A, one headspace gas sample was analyze d per $9.5\textrm{m}$ of core for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring. Th e carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur content of particulate sediment wa s characterized, and source rock analysis was performed on remaining residues. For Hole U1545B, hydrocarbons were analyzed fo r both headspace gas and void gas; the amount of void space wa s quantified; $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents were measured; the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of sediment were characterized; and a comprehensive suite of gas and sediment samples was taken fo r postcruise analyses. The SMTZ is at approximately 40–50 mbsf i n the three holes, and $C_{2}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons are detectable below 10 0 mbsf. In Hole U1545A, low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values necessitated the termination of drilling. From elemental and source rock analysis, we infe r that the primary source of organic matter is marine in origin and th e thermal maturity of organic matter varies based on the proximity o f the sill. In Holes U1545B and U1545C, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO are present in lo w concentrations, which suggests that biological cycling is the dominant control on these gases.  

# Microbiology  

Sediment cores from below 480 mbsf in Hole U1545A an d throughout Holes U1545B and U1545C span the complete or nearcomplete temperature range (from the cold seafloor to the ho t $[{\sim}89^{\circ}\mathrm{C}]$ subsurface formation) that is potentially populated by psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic microorganisms, successively. Thus, these cores were extensively sampled for microbiolog y and biogeochemistry, and those samples captured the entire spatial and thermal gradient in the penetrated sediment column from Sit e U1545. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, an d RNA analyses were taken on the core receiving platform, preserve d or frozen, and stored for further analyses. Whole-round (WR) cor e samples were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily store d in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processed further for shore-based analyses. WR sample processing was conducted either inside a Coy Laboratory Products anaerobic chamber or on the bench with  a KOACH open clean zone system to maintain conditions that wer e as sterile as possible. Samples for PFT measurements were taken b y syringe at 11 distinct sediment horizons on the core receiving platform. Shipboard cell counts showed that abundance gradually decreases with depth until it drops below the detection limit of th e protocol that we used for the shipboard cell counting program.  

# Petrophysics  

Physical properties of WR and split cores were measured in th e laboratory, and in situ measurements were made with downhol e logging tools. Measurements on WR and working-half section s from Holes U1545A–U1545C were compared with each other an d with downhole measurements from Hole U1545A for lithostratigraphic characterization and integration of core description, borehole data, and seismic profiles. These measurements included W R bulk density estimated from gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bul k density, magnetic susceptibility (MS), natural gamma radiatio n (NGR; sensitive to the abundance of minerals containing radioisotopes of K, U, and Th), $P$ -wave velocity, and discrete measurement s of moisture and density (MAD; to estimate porosity), thermal conductivity, three-component $P$ -wave velocity, and rheological properties (shear and compressional strength). Two types of change s were observed in the GRA bulk density. The first type is observed i n the uppermost $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment and the second type to $\mathord{\sim}280$ mbsf. Density generally increases by $0.11~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ every $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ .  A steeper increase in density $(0.14\mathrm{~g/cm^{3}}$ every $100\ \mathrm{m}$ ) was observe d from $\mathord{\sim}280$ mbsf to the final curated depth of Hole U1545A at 507. 7 mbsf. This density increase is particularly well correlated with NG R values and corresponds to a change in lithology from diatom clay t o siliceous claystone. MS values show peaks at 60, 170, and 482–48 3 mbsf that are also seen in the bulk density and NGR data. Tw o downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1545A: the tripl e combo (NGR, porosity, and density, including MS, resistivity, caliper, and logging head temperature) and FMS-sonic (resistivity images, caliper, acoustic velocity, and NGR) tool strings. Because of  a malfunctioning caliper on the upward pass, only one pass was possible with the triple combo. In general, downhole measurements ar e consistent with results obtained from the WR and working-hal f cores. In addition to the logging tools, nine in situ formation temperature measurements were conducted with the APCT-3 an d SET2 tools, indicating that temperature increases with depth alon g a linear geothermal gradient of $225^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ that corresponds to a calculated heat flow of $161\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

# Site U1546  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1546 (proposed Site GUAYM-02B) is located just $1.1\,\mathrm{km}$ away from Site U1545 and ${\sim}51~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben o f the northern Guaymas Basin spreading segment (Figures F1, F4) . The primary objective was to compare these two adjacent sites tha t have shared sedimentation history but very different degrees of alteration resulting from intruding sills. Precruise seismic survey dat a at Site U1546 revealed a bright reflector at ${\sim}2.6\;{\ s}$ TWT that was interpreted to be the contact with a sill intrusion. Disruption of th e sedimentary strata above the interpreted sill (at ${\sim}2.3{-}2.6\ \mathrm{s}$ TWT ) was supposed to have formed as a response to the sill emplacement. This feature abruptly terminates laterally toward Site U1545, coincident with the termination of the underlying sill. This same sedimentary sequence appears undisrupted at Site U1545 to ${\sim}2.8~{\ s}$ TWT, where another sill was observed in the seismic data. The shared objective for Sites U1545 and U1546 was to compare the composition, physical properties, geochemical gradients, and microbial communities at these sites. Thus, the major objective for Site U1546 was t o provide a post-intrusion sedimentary succession for compariso n with the reference Site U1545, and this comparison will provide direct measurements of changes in response to sill intrusion.  

# Operations  

We cored four holes at Site U1546. Hole U1546A is located a t $27^{\circ}37.8851\,\mathrm{N}$ , $111^{\circ}52.7939^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1586.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hol e U1546A, we used the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems to advanc e from the seafloor to a final depth of 361.2 mbsf with a recovery o f $365.7\:\mathrm{m}\:(101\%)$ . We made formation temperature measurements a t several depths using the APCT-3 and SET2 tools. In Hole U1546B, located  at $27^{\circ}37.8840^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , $111^{\circ}52.7809^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in  a  water  depth  o f $1585.6\;\mathrm{m},$ , we deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems. Core s penetrated from the seafloor to a final depth of 333.8 mbsf and recovered $351.2\;\mathrm{m}$ $(105\%)$ ). In Hole U1546C, located at $27^{\circ}37.8724^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $111^{\circ}52.7568^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in a water depth of $1596.6\;\mathrm{m};$ , we first drilled withou t core recovery from the seafloor to 308.2 mbsf. Then, the rotary cor e barrel (RCB) system was deployed to advance from 308.2 mbsf to  a final depth of 540.2 mbsf with a recovery of $139.7\;\mathrm{m}$ $(60\%)$ . Corin g was terminated when the safety monitoring for hydrocarbon gase s obtained an anomalously low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ value. We then conducte d downhole wireline logging in Hole U1546C with the triple comb o and FMS-sonic logging tool strings. In Hole U1546D, located a t $27^{\circ}37.8943^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , $111^{\circ}52.7812^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1585.9\;\mathrm{m}$ , we deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems to advance from th e seafloor to a final depth of 300.1 mbsf with a recovery of $314.7~\mathrm{m}$ $(105\%)$ . Holes U1546B and U1546D were dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deploymen t of PFTs downhole on all cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater ) contamination. The pace of coring in Holes U1546B and U1546 D was at times adjusted to accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducted on the core receiving platform. A total o f $270.7\,\mathrm{h},$ , or 11.3 days, were spent at Site U1546. Cores, penetratio n depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Sit e U1546 are listed in Table T1.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Of the four holes cored at Site U1546, the most complete an d deepest record of sedimentary and igneous rocks is represented b y the combination of results from Holes U1546A and U1546C. Th e sediments recovered are middle to late Pleistocene in age, mostl y laminated to homogenous diatom ooze to diatom clay forming  a single lithostratigraphic unit (Unit I) (Figure F6). Subordinate lithologic components include nannofossils, silt-sized siliciclastic particles, and authigenic minerals such as pyrite and clay- to silt-size d carbonate (micrite). The latter is mainly dolomitic in compositio n and occurs as scattered crystals in the sediment. Carbonate also occurs as discrete concretions and ultimately as indurated limestone/dolomite intervals at depth. The distribution of authigeni c carbonates as well as silica diagenesis produce subtle yet distinc t lithologic changes supporting the division of Unit I into four subunits (IA, IB, IC, and ID). The transitions between the subunits ar e generally gradual, occurring over more than $10\,\mathrm{m}$ thick intervals, and can be difficult to define in low recovery or heavily sample d zones. The clay-rich diatom ooze of Subunit IA becomes more micritic in Subunit IB, which in turn is underlain by the less calcareous, largely micrite-free Subunit IC. Siliceous claystone represent s Subunit ID. Although the subunit divisions are similar to those a t Site U1545, Subunit IB is thicker and shallower at Site U1546. Ther e are also distinct zones of altered sediment above and below th e thick mafic sill interval in Subunit ID that was fully penetrated i n Hole U1546C. The mixed biogenic and siliciclastic sediments an d their characteristic lamination are consistent with a middle to lat e Pleistocene, hemipelagic and suboxic to anoxic depositional environment.  

# Igneous petrology and alteration  

Mafic sill material was encountered in Holes U1546A an d U1546C at 354.6 and 348.2 mbsf, respectively. In Hole U1546A, th e hypabyssal sill was penetrated over an interval of $6.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wherea s Hole U1546C was cored through the lower sill/sediment contact, resulting in a total sill thickness of $82.2~\mathrm{m}$ based on core recover y and ${\sim}74\;\mathrm{m}$ based on downhole logging data. The sill is made up o f highly altered basaltic rock at the top followed by doleritic and gabbroic intervals. A doleritic texture resumes below the gabbroic interval and is followed by a short basaltic interval at the botto m contact. The upper- and lowermost basaltic intervals have chille d margin contacts with the adjacent sediments. Highly altered and vesicular basalts show rounded to subrounded calcite amygdules. Th e cryptocrystalline groundmass hosts plagioclase phenocrysts. Th e doleritic intervals close to the basaltic layers are sparsely vesicula r and gradually turn into nonvesicular doleritic rock toward the center of the sill. A ${\sim}12~\mathrm{m}$ thick gabbroic interval is intercalated between the doleritic layers. The contacts between gabbroic an d doleritic lithologies are both sharp and gradational. Plagioclas e phenocrysts are present throughout the doleritic intervals, wherea s pyroxene pseudomorphs occur as a minor phenocryst phase in th e bottom doleritic layer, below the gabbroic interval. No pyroxen e phenocrysts were observed in the upper doleritic part of the sill intrusion.  

# Structural geology  

A few intervals of tilted beds were seen in the sedimentary section of Lithostratigraphic Unit I. Hole U1546A has tilted bedding i n the uppermost two Subunits IA and IB from 98 to 117 mbsf. Also, tilted bedding occurs in Subunit IB from 115 to 124 mbsf in Hol e U1546B and from 112 to 120 mbsf and 145 to 156 mbsf in Hol e U1546D. Brittle fractures and faults were found in sedimentar y cores below 200 mbsf in Hole U1546D and below 166 mbsf in Hol e U1546B. They have intermediate apparent dips $(30^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ})$ . Wher e displacements could be measured, they were $\le\!5\ \mathrm{cm}$ . Six vertica l veins were measured in sedimentary rocks at 433 mbsf in Hol e U1546C. In the recovered igneous rocks, fractures and veins wer e measured for true dip from WR cores before they were split. A tota l of 49 such structures were identified in Hole U1546C. No vein s were seen in the igneous rocks at the bottom of Hole U1546A.  

# Biostratigraphy  

At  Site  U1546,  preservation  of  calcareous  nannofossils  i s good/moderate to poor throughout the entire sedimentary sequence. In general, nannofossils are abundant and well preserved i n the upper ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sequence. Below ${\sim}100$ mbsf, intervals wit h barren/few and common/abundant nannofossils alternate. Preservation  is  good/moderate  in  samples  with  common/abundan t nannofossils and poor in those with few/rare abundances. In general, marine diatoms are dominant/abundant with good/moderat e preservation down to ${\sim}312$ mbsf and barren to the bottom of Hole s U1546A and U1546C. The lowermost appearance (first appearanc e datum) of the calcareous nannofossil $E$ . huxleyi dates the upper par t of the sediment sequence to Holocene–middle Pleistocene (0–0.2 9 Ma; 0–249.28 mbsf in Hole U1546A). In contrast, the absence o f calcareous nannofossil $P\!\!\!\!/$ lacunosa and marine diatom $E$ reinholdii in the underlying interval indicates a middle Pleistocene age $\left(0.29-\right.$ $0.44\mathrm{\Ma})$ ) for the lower part of Hole U1546A. $P_{\star}$ lacunosa was observed in the basal core catcher sample from Hole U1546C (539.8 4 mbsf), suggesting an age older than the uppermost appearance (las t appearance datum [LAD]) of $P\!\!\!\!/$ lacunosa at $0.44\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . The estimate d average sedimentation rate is $1020\;\mathrm{m/My}$ $\mathrm{{}^{102}\,c m/k y)}$ at this site.  

# Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization was implemented with the SRM on archive-half sections up to $20\:\mathrm{mT}$ on all cores from Holes U1546A an d U1546C. The drilling-induced overprint was successfully remove d from all APC and HLAPC cores (from the seafloor to ${\sim}270~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) upon demagnetization. In Hole U1546A, inclination values after demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $43^{\circ}$ , which is similar to th e expected GAD inclination at the latitude of the site (46.3°). A detailed analysis of the remanence of discrete samples from Hol e U1546A showed that the drilling-induced overprint is removed b y  

$10~\mathrm{mT}$ and the characteristic remanent magnetization agrees wit h the SRM measurements. Unfortunately, the XCB and RCB core s were irreversibly overprinted. The NRM of archive-half sections decreases at ${\sim}80{-}100$ mbsf (Hole U1546A), a depth interval that corresponds to the SMTZ zone. The magnetic mineral assemblag e becomes coarser, and low-coercivity minerals such as (titano)magnetite are dominant. The AF demagnetization protocol was not appropriate for the igneous rock sections of Hole U1546C. Therefore, we focused on thermal demagnetization of discrete samples. Tw o groups of samples distributed in the sill intrusion were identified:  a first group in the upper $18~\mathrm{m}$ of the sill contains fine-grained magnetite, and a second group is dominated by coarse-grained titanomagnetite  in  the  bottom $57~\mathrm{~m~}$ .  Anisotropy  of  magneti c susceptibility (AMS) shows a mixture of prolate and oblate behavio r above the sill and a dominant prolate behavior below it. All cores i n Holes U1546A and U1546C were assigned to the normal Brunhe s Chron C1n (younger than $0.78\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ). No paleomagnetic measurements were conducted in Holes U1546B and U1546D.  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 94 IW samples were collected at Site U1546 (Hole s U1546A–U1546D). Based on the sulfate and methane profiles, th e SMTZ is estimated to be at ${\sim}110$ mbsf. Around this depth, sulfide, alkalinity, and phosphate reach their maximum values and bariu m concentration starts to increase. However, the depth of maximu m concentrations of alkalinity and phosphate is slightly offset from th e SMTZ. Ammonium gradually increases downhole until an alteration zone above the sediment/sill contact records a drop betwee n 300 and 330 mbsf. Biogeochemical processes observed from th e seafloor to 120 mbsf are mainly related to anaerobic degradation o f organic matter and sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane. Just above and below the sill, a number of significant variation s were observed for many IW dissolved elements (such as $\mathbf{K}_{:}^{+}$ , B, ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ , $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , and $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ ), which could be related to changes in mineralogi c composition derived from sill-induced alteration. Between th e SMTZ and the sill intrusion, the IW chemical properties are likel y to be influenced by combined biogeochemical processes and sediment–water interaction associated with the sill intrusion and b y precipitation/dissolution processes, including diatom dissolutio n and authigenic carbonate precipitation.  

# Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1546, we sampled and analyzed gas and solid-phas e samples. In Holes U1546A–U1546D, one headspace gas sample wa s analyzed per $9.5\textrm{m}$ advance for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring. The carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of particulate sediment were characterized, and source rock analysis was performe d on selected solid-phase samples. For the sediments recovered i n Holes U1546B and U1546C, both headspace and void gas were analyzed for their hydrocarbon contents; the amount of void space wa s quantified; $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents were measured; and the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of sediment were characterized. Durin g igneous rock recovery in Hole U1546C, WR core pieces of roc k were incubated in sealed trilaminated foil barrier bags to examin e degassing of hydrocarbons. In general, methane increases wit h depth in each hole with 1–2 local maxima. $C_{2}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons ar e detectable below ${\sim}90~\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{~}}}$ , and they all increase with depth. I n Hole U1546C, low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values eventually necessitated the termination of coring. From elemental and source rock analysis we infe r that the primary source of organic matter is marine in origin and th e thermal maturity of organic matter varies based on the proximity o f the sill. In Holes U1546B and U1546C, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO are present in n M concentrations.  

# Microbiology  

Sediment cores for microbiological studies were obtained fro m APC, HLAPC, and XCB cores from Holes U1546B and U1546D. After drilling to 308 mbsf without core recovery, Hole U1546C wa s also sampled along its deeper, hydrothermally heated sediment column above and below the penetrated sill. These Hole U1546C samples  represent  important  horizons  that  will  further  ou r understanding of the impact sill emplacement has on geochemistr y and extant microbial communities within the hyperthermophili c zone. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, an d RNA analyses were taken on the catwalk, fixed or frozen, and store d for further analyses. WR core samples were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a cold room (temperature range between $4^{\circ}C$ and $8^{\circ}C$ ) and then processed for shore-based analyses. WR core sample processing was conducted either inside a Coy Laboratory Products anaerobic chamber or on the bench with  a KOACH open clean zone system to maintain highly sterile conditions. Samples for PFT measurements were taken on the core receiving platform by syringe at 17 horizons. Cell abundance fo r selected samples was determined by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cell abundance in seafloor sediment wa s roughly 1000 times higher than the bottom seawater and graduall y decreased downhole. In deeper intervals, cell abundance droppe d below the detection limit of the protocol used for the shipboard cel l counting program.  

# Petrophysics  

Physical properties of the recovered cores were measured o n WR and working-half sections. Downhole wireline logging wa s used to measure host formation physical properties. Measurement s on WR and working-half sections from Holes U1546A–U1546 D were compared with each other and with downhole measurement s obtained from Hole U1546C for lithostratigraphic characterizatio n and correlation between core description, logging data, and precruise seismic survey profiles. Our analysis identified the same tw o large-scale major petrophysical variations found at Site U1545 and  a transition at $\mathord{\sim}280$ mbsf. All physical properties highlight the presence of a ${\sim}74\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sill at ${\sim}355$ mbsf. Twelve in situ formatio n temperature measurements were conducted using the APCT-3 an d SET2 tools. Measured values, together with the seafloor temperature of $3.96^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , indicate that temperatures increase with depth alon g a linear geothermal gradient of $221^{\circ}{\mathrm{C}}/{\mathrm{km}}$ that corresponds to a calculated heat flow of $160~\mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ . Thermal conductivity varies between ${\sim}0.66$ and ${\sim}1.00\,\mathrm{\W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ in the first ${\sim}345\$ mbsf, whic h marks the upper sill/sediment contact. Sixteen hard-rock therma l conductivity measurements were made on sill samples from $\sim\!348$ t o ${\sim}432$ mbsf, yielding a mean thermal conductivity of $1.72\,\pm\,0.14$ $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ . Downhole logging caliper measurements clearly identif y the sill–sediment transitions. Bulk density for sediments generall y ranges from ${\sim}1.2$ to ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ and shows variations in trends a t ${\sim}270$ and ${\sim}310$ mbsf. The average sill density of ${\sim}2.8\ \mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ is typica l for doleritic rock. Porosity shows a linear decrease from $90\%$ at th e seafloor to $73\%{-}82\%$ at $\mathord{\sim}309$ mbsf. A significant decrease in sediment porosity was observed at the top and bottom contacts with th e sill. Porosity inside the sill is relatively low $(\sim\!3\%)$ with some hig h values in the upper part of the sill. Compressive strength increase s by $1.1\;\mathrm{kPa}/\mathrm{m},$ , and shear strength increases by a value of $0.6\;\mathrm{kPa/m}$ . NGR values increase from ${\sim}10$ to 25 counts/s down to 270 mbsf i n the host sediments; these values then drop inside the sill. Downhol e NGR measurements inside the sill are consistent with WR core laboratory measurements. Resistivity measurements reveal large relative variations of 0.4 to ${\sim}200\ \Omega\mathrm{m}$ that typically correlate wit h variations in density and porosity. Core-based MS values are mainl y constant to ${\sim}355$ mbsf. $P$ -wave velocity generally increases wit h depth and shows typical higher values for the sill.  

# Sites U1547 and U1548  

# Background and objectives  

Sites U1547 and U1548 (proposed Sites GUAYM-12A an d GUAYM-03B, respectively) are located ${\sim}27\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben of the northern Guaymas Basin (Figure F1). Site U154 7 lies within a circular, bowl-shaped hydrothermal mound calle d Ringvent that rises ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ above the seafloor and has a maximu m diameter of ${\sim}800\mathrm{~m~}$ . Three holes of Site U1548 (U1548A–U1548C ) lie at the periphery of Ringvent’s southeastern edge, and two hole s (U1548D and U1548E) are situated ${\sim}600\;\mathrm{m}$ west-northwest o f Ringvent (Figure F7). Seismic profiles across Ringvent show  a prominent subseafloor mound feature at ${\sim}0.06\;s$ TWT that is characterized by brightly reflective strata within the central bowlshaped region. A bright reflector underlying the base of the bowl (a t ${\sim}0.18\;s$ TWT) is interpreted to be a sill intrusion. It is hypothesize d that this and previous similar intrusions provided the heat tha t formed Ringvent and keep it active today. Ringvent is the best-characterized active, sill-associated hydrothermal system at an off-axi s site in Guaymas Basin, and the temperature of its vent fluids varie s between $20^{\circ}$ and $75^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Teske et al., 2019). Site survey data sugges t that the central portion of Ringvent may thus function as a hydrothermal recharge zone. Therefore, Sites U1547 and U1548 were intended  to  core  sediments  and  sills  to  explore  patterns  o f hydrothermal circulation at Ringvent, which were suspected to b e different within (Site U1547) and outside (Holes U1548A–U1548C ) of the ring structure. The comparatively hot sill at Ringvent represents a shallow-emplacement end-member. The primary objectives for Sites U1547 and U1548 were thus to characterize th e physical, chemical, and biological processes driven and affected b y this end-member type of sill–sediment system, with a particular focus on the response of microbial communities to the expected stee p temperature gradients at these sites. Moreover, two additional hole s in an area near Ringvent were added to Site U1548 during the expedition (Holes U1548D and U1548E), with the joint objective of characterizing the geochemical signature of the abrupt lateral change i n seismic character observed in sediment strata between ${\sim}2.39$ an d 2.42 s TWT, which may be related to a diagenetic change caused b y the proximity to the igneous intrusions at Ringvent.  

# Operations  

Sites U1547 and U1548 established a total of ten holes within o r adjacent to the Ringvent structure to characterize this hydrothermal mound and its immediate surroundings.  

We cored five holes at Site U1547. Hole U1547A is located a t $27^{\circ}30.4561\,\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $111^{\circ}40.6980^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1733.7\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hol e U1547A, we used the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems to advanc e from the seafloor to a final depth of 141.3 mbsf with a recovery o f $145.3\textrm{m}(103\%)$ . We made formation temperature measurements a t several depths using the APCT-3 and SET2 tools. In Hole U1547B, located  at $27^{\circ}30.4128\,\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , $111^{\circ}40.7341^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in  a  water  depth  o f $1732.2\;\mathrm{m},$ , we deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems. Core s penetrated from the seafloor to a final depth of 209.8 mbsf and recovered $161.3\;\mathrm{m}\;(77\%)$ . Formation temperature measurements wer e made at several depths using the APCT-3 and SET2 tools. Next, w e deployed the Kuster FTS to successfully recover two borehole flui d samples, one each from 109.7 and 135.7 mbsf. We then conducte d downhole wireline logging in Hole U1547B with the triple comb o and  FMS-sonic  tool  strings.  In  Hole  U1547C,  located  a t $27^{\circ}30.4455^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $111^{\circ}40.7064^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1732.2\;\mathrm{m},$ we firs t drilled without core recovery from the seafloor to 81.3 mbsf. W e then used the RCB system to advance from 81.3 mbsf to a fina l depth of 159.2 mbsf with a recovery of $9.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(12\%)$ . In Hol e U1547D, located at $27^{\circ}30.3947\,\mathrm{N},$ , $111^{\circ}40.7483^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in a water dept h of $1732.2\;\mathrm{m},$ we first drilled without core recovery from the seafloo r to 81.3 mbsf. We then used the RCB system to advance fro m 81.3 mbsf to a final depth of 193.0 mbsf with a recovery of $34.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(31\%)$ . The Elevated Temperature Borehole Sensor (ETBS) was deployed to make a temperature measurement at the bottom of th e hole. In Hole U1547E, located at $27^{\circ}30.3598\,\mathrm{N}$ , $111^{\circ}40.7756^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in  a water depth of $1732.1\;\mathrm{m}$ , we first drilled without core recovery fro m the seafloor to 61.8 mbsf. We then used the RCB system to advanc e from 61.8 mbsf to a final depth of 191.2 mbsf with a recovery o f $44.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(35\%)$ . Holes U1547B–U1547D were dedicated to extensiv e microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole for all cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. A total of $235.0\,\mathrm{h},$ or 9.8 days, were spent a t Site U1547. Table T1 displays cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Site U1547.  

Five holes were cored at Site U1548. Hole U1548A is located a t $27^{\circ}30.2466^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $111^{\circ}40.8665^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1739.9\,\mathrm{m}$ . In Hol e U1548A, we deployed the APC and XCB systems. Cores advance d from the seafloor to a final depth of 103.4 mbsf and recovere d $114.0\:\mathrm{m}\;(110\%)$ . We made formation temperature measurements a t several depths using the APCT-3 tool.

We mad e formation temperature measurements at several depths with th e APCT-3 and SET2 tools. We then deployed the Kuster FTS to successfully recover a borehole fluid sample from $70.0\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . In Hol e U1548C, located at $27^{\circ}30.2698\,\mathrm{N},$ , $111^{\circ}40.8476^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water dept h of $1737.0\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , we deployed the APC and XCB systems to advanc e from the seafloor to a final depth of 69.8 mbsf with a recovery o f $71.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(102\%)$ . We made formation temperature measurements a t several depths with the APCT-3 and SET2 tools. In Hole U1548D, located  at $27^{\circ}30.5316\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}41.3855^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in  a  water  depth  o f $1729.3\;\mathrm{m},$ , we deployed the APC and HLAPC systems.

W e conducted formation temperature measurements at several depth s using the APCT-3 tool. Holes U1548B and U1548C were dedicate d to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that require d the deployment of PFTs downhole for all cores to monitor drillin g fluid (seawater) contamination. A total of $94.6\,\mathrm{h},$ or 3.9 days, wer e spent at Site U1548. Table T1 displays cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Site U1548.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

This lithostratigraphic summary characterizes both Site U154 7 and Site U1548, which are located only a few hundred meters fro m each other (maximum distance between holes $=\mathrm{~\sim~}800\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Sit e U1547 and Holes U1548A–U1548C were drilled inside or adjacen t to the Ringvent structure, and Holes U1548D and U1548E wer e drilled ${\sim}600\mathrm{~m~}$ west-northwest of Ringvent. The sediments recovered at Sites U1547 and U1548 are middle to late Pleistocene in ag e and mostly biogenic (mainly diatom ooze), although the proportio n of siliciclastic components is more significant compared to Site s U1545 and U1546 in northwest Guaymas Basin (Figures F8, F9, F10). The sequence recovered at Sites U1547 and U1548 show s downhole changes in the lithologic characteristics of the sedimen t that are related to changes in (1) the abundance ratio between diatom ooze and clay minerals, (2) the abundance of carbonate precipitates, and (3) to a lesser extent, the diagenetic changes of biogeni c silica. Downhole changes in lithology at Sites U1547 and U1548 ar e not significant enough to require division into more than one lithostratigraphic unit but are sufficient to warrant the division of Unit  I into four subunits at Site U1547 and three subunits at Site U154 8 (Figures F8, F9, F10). The uppermost subunit, Subunit IA, is mad e up of a similar lithology at both sites, mainly consisting of more o r less laminated diatom ooze mixed with different amounts of cla y minerals. The boundary between Subunits IA and IB is located a t ${\sim}40$ mbsf in holes at both sites except in Hole U1548C, where it occurs at ${\sim}27$ mbsf. Subunit IB is mainly composed of varying proportions of diatoms and clay, with the addition of significant $(>\!5\%)$ micrite (euhedral to subhedral, micrometer-sized, authigenic carbonate particles). Gray silty beds, often showing erosional botto m contacts, are also frequent, and some of these beds attain thicknesses of up to $1.2\;\mathrm{m}$ . The top of Subunit IC (only observed in Hol e U1548C) is very thin and coincides with a significant drop in micrite content in the sediment, although limestone/dolostone intervals still persist. The main lithologies are diatom clay and clay-ric h diatom ooze. Sandy and silty intervals are also common, and som e intervals display evidence of syndepositional deformation. Subuni t ID was only recovered at Site U1547, where it is a dusky yellowis h brown siliceous claystone. Basalt occurs at shallow depths at Site s U1547 (130.5–150 mbsf) and U1548 (90–100 mbsf). However, poo r recovery provides only limited observations of contact zones wit h the adjacent sediment.  

# Igneous petrology and alteration  

Mafic rocks from sill intrusions underlying the Ringvent structure were recovered in Holes U1547A–U1547E (inside Ringvent ) and U1548A–U1548C (outside of Ringvent at its periphery). The sill bodies were encountered at different depths and were recovered a t varying rates. Sills recovered at Site U1547 are mostly composed o f aphyric to clinopyroxene-plagioclase phyric basalt. A ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ thic k doleritic section was recovered from the bottom part of Hol e U1547E (down to 191 mbsf) and includes plagioclase and pyroxen e phenocrysts $2{-}5\,\mathrm{\mm}$ in size. The basaltic material is slightly t o moderately vesicular, whereas doleritic intervals are nonvesicular t o slightly vesicular. The subangular to subrounded vesicles rang e from 1 to $25\,\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter. Some vesicles are empty, and some ar e partially/fully filled with carbonate that is often associated with pyrite $^{'}{<}0.5\;\mathrm{mm}$ ). Empty vesicles are often coated with secondary bluish gray silicate material. The recovered basalts show variabl e degrees of alteration. Monomineralic carbonate veins are often surrounded by thin halos of pyrite. Occasionally, the latter also occur s as subordinate vein-filling material. In terms of modal composition, basalts recovered at Site U1548 resemble those from Site U1547, bu t they are darker in color and usually nonvesicular. Other commo n features observed in igneous rock cores from Holes U1547A– U1547E and U1548A–U1548C are injected sedimentary veins, contacts between sedimentary breccia and basalt, sediment-magm a mingling (peperite facies), and glassy chilled margins. The presenc e of glassy chilled margins suggests direct contact of the magma wit h very wet sediment.  

# Structural geology  

We made structural observations in all ten holes within (Sit e U1547) or near (Site U1548) the Ringvent structure. Structural information was sought from sedimentary units in four of the fiv e holes at Site U1547 and all five holes at Site U1548. Hole U1547 A was lithologically the most complete hole for examining the sedimentary succession. Bedding and lamination in sediments show n o significant folds and few brittle fractures and faults, although i n some cases fractures are seen much more easily in the X-ray image s than on the cut surfaces of the cores. Additional structural information came from the basaltic rocks in Subunit ID, which were core d in eight of the holes. Holes U1547B, U1547D, and U1547E recovered the most basalt. Structural features observed in the basalts include pre-existing fractures and faults, mineralized veins, glass y margins, sediment-filled veins, and fragments of columnar joints. Where possible, these features were measured for true dip an d await possible reorientation using shore-based paleomagnetic results. Networks of veins with irregular branching patterns were no t measured as planar features. No macroscopic shortening or foldin g of the veins was evident.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils are abundant to common above 43.5 1 mbsf at Site U1547 and in Holes U1548A–U1548C. This interval i s followed by an alternation between intervals with few or barren occurrences of nannofossils and intervals with abundant/commo n populations from 43.73 to 151.93 mbsf at both sites. Nannofossi l preservation varies from good to poor throughout the entire sedimentary sequence and is generally good and moderate in sample s with abundant and common abundances and poor in those with fe w and barren abundances. In general, marine diatoms are dominan t and abundant with good to moderate preservation above 131.2 1 mbsf in Hole U1547A, above 101.15 mbsf in Hole U1547B, abov e 81.6 mbsf in Hole U1547C, and above 91.25 mbsf in Hole U1547D. The barren intervals at the bottom of Site U1547 and in Hole s U1548A–U1548C might be due to diagenetic alteration. In Hol e U1548A, marine diatoms are mostly abundant with moderate preservation above 84.1 mbsf, whereas they are abundant to few an d poorly preserved in the bottom interval (90.9–99.0 mbsf). In Hole s U1548D and U1548E, calcareous nannofossils are common t o abundant with moderate and poor preservation in most samples examined, except for those from three sampled depths (31, 92.29, an d $101.58~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) in Hole U1548D. Marine diatoms are dominant an d abundant with good and moderate preservation throughout Hole s U1548D and U1548E. The occurrence of calcareous nannofossi l species $E_{i}$ . huxleyi downhole to the bottom of all holes dates the entire sediment sequence to Holocene–middle Pleistocene, or 0–0.2 9 Ma (Hole U1547A $=0{-}137$ mbsf, Hole $\mathrm{U1547B}\,=\,0{\mathrm{-}}151.93~\mathrm{mbsf},$ ,  

Hole $\mathrm{U}1547\mathrm{C}\,=\,0{-}121.13$ mbsf, Hole $\mathrm{U}1547\mathrm{D}\,=\,0{-}101.33$ mbsf, Hole $\mathsf{U}1548\mathsf{A}\,=\,0{-}99$ mbsf, Hole $\mathrm{U1548D~=~0{-}110.24~m b s}$ f, an d Hole $\mathrm{U1548E}\,=\,0{-}91.81\$ mbsf). This age assignment is consisten t with the absence of calcareous nannofossil species $P_{\star}$ lacunosa (LA D $=0.44\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and $E$ reinholdii $\mathrm{(LAD=0.62\Ma)}$ ) in all examined samples. The estimated average sedimentation rate is ${>}524\;\mathrm{~m/My}$ $(>52.4\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization of up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was conducted with th e SRM  on  all  sediment  archive-half  core  sections  from  Hole s U1547A, U1548A, and U1548C–U1548E (APC, HLAPC, and XC B cores). The drilling-induced overprint was successfully remove d from all cores upon demagnetization. Mean inclination values afte r demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $46^{\circ}$ at Site U1547 (Hol e U1547A) and vary between ${\sim}40^{\circ}$ and $47^{\circ}$ at Site U1548, values tha t are comparable to the expected GAD inclination at the latitude o f the sites $(46.2^{\circ})$ . A detailed analysis of the remanence of discret e samples from Sites U1547 and U1548 shows that the drilling-induced overprint is removed by $10~\mathrm{mT}$ and the characteristic remanent magnetization is in accordance with the SRM measurements. The NRM of archive-half sections decreases at ${\sim}30{-}35\$ mbsf i n Holes U1547A and U1548A and at ${\sim}65{-}70$ mbsf in Holes U1548 D and U1548E. The magnetic mineral assemblage becomes coarser, and low-coercivity minerals, likely (titano)magnetite, are dominant. The igneous rock archive-half core sections of Holes U1547B– U1547E, U1548A, and U1548C were measured for their NRM onl y because the AF demagnetization protocol was not appropriate fo r the igneous sections. All cores at Sites U1547 and U1548 were assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younger than $0.78\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ).  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 32 IW samples were collected from Holes U1547A an d U1547B, and 68 were collected from Holes U1548A–U1548E. In addition, 27 IW samples from Hole U1547A and 20 from Hol e U1548A were collected using Rhizon samplers. The holes at Site s U1547 and U1548 are divided into three groups: holes insid e (U1547A–U1547E), peripheral to (U1548A–U1548C), and nearb y (U1548D and U1548E) Ringvent. Above the encountered sills a t Ringvent, the IW profiles show similar trends in all Site U1547 hole s and in Holes U1548A–U1548C, with slight differences mainly i n sulfate, alkalinity, phosphate, and sulfide concentrations. Abrup t changes were observed for many elements in the contact interval with the sill: sulfate sharply decreases over a few meters, coinciden t with increases in $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , $\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ , B, $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , and $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ , and decreases i n $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , and $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ . Similar excursions were observed at Site s U1545 and U1546 above the sills. The IW chemical properties ar e likely influenced by combined biogeochemical processes, by sediment–fluid interaction associated with the sill intrusion, and b y precipitation/dissolution processes associated with sediment diagenesis, including diatom dissolution. Northwest of Ringvent, th e IW profiles in Holes U1548D and U1548E show quite different behavior from the holes located inside Ringvent. The SMTZ is well defined around 75 mbsf by a concave downward decrease in sulfat e and a concomitant increase in alkalinity, $\mathrm{HS^{-}}$ , $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ . I n general, concentrations of alkalinity, $\mathrm{H}S^{-}$ , $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ produced by organic matter mineralization are higher in Holes U1548 D and U1548E than in Ringvent Holes U1548A–U1548C. Compare d to the Ringvent holes, the lower concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ in Holes U1548D and U1548E may reflect the lower alteration stat e of silicate minerals or diatom tests due to the lower thermal gradient in Holes U1548D and U1548E.  

# Organic geochemistry  

At Sites U1547 and U1548, organic geochemists sampled an d analyzed gas and solid-phase samples. For all holes, one headspac e gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of advancement for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring. Void spaces were measured on th e core receiving platform, and void gases were characterized for thei r hydrocarbon content. The carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents o f particulate sediment were characterized, and source rock analysi s was performed on solid-phase samples. When sampling was focused on microbiology and biogeochemistry objectives, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and C O contents were measured and gas and solid-phase materials wer e sampled for shore-based analyses. During igneous rock recovery, pieces of rock from WR cores were incubated in sealed trilaminate d foil barrier bags to examine degassing of hydrocarbons. Methan e and higher hydrocarbons were found throughout Sites U1547 an d U1548. Elemental analysis revealed that organic matter at these site s originates primarily from marine sources, although some interval s may be influenced by terrestrial inputs. Source rock analysis indicated that thermal maturity of organic matter varies based on sil l proximity. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO are present in nanomolar concentrations an d exhibit varying trends with depth.  

# Microbiology  

Sediment cores for microbiological studies were obtained fro m Holes U1547B, U1548B, and U1548C using the APC and XCB systems. In addition, samples of igneous rock with indications of fluid– rock interaction, such as veins, sediment injections, and vesicularit y with amygdules, were taken for microbiological studies from Hole s U1547C–U1547E, U1548A, and U1548B. Syringe samples for cel l counts, 3-D structural imaging, and RNA analyses were taken o n the core receiving platform, preserved or frozen, and stored for further analyses. WR core samples were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processe d further for shore-based analyses. WR core sample processing wa s conducted either inside a Coy Laboratory Products anaerobi c chamber or on the bench with a KOACH open clean zone system t o maintain conditions that were as sterile as possible. Samples fo r PFT measurements were taken on the core receiving platform by syringe from eight Hole U1547B cores and four Hole U1548B cores. Cell abundance was $1.0\times10^{9}$ cells $\mathrm{{}_{c m^{3}}}$ in seafloor sediment withi n the perimeter of Ringvent (Hole U1547B) and $5.4\,\times\,10^{8}$ cells $\iota_{\mathrm{Cm}^{3}}$ outside of Ringvent (Hole U1548B). Cell abundance gradually decreased downhole at both Site U1547 and Site U1548.  

# Petrophysics  

Physical properties measured on WR and split core section s from Holes U1547A–U1547E and U1548A–U1548E were compared with each other and with downhole logging measurement s from Hole U1547B for lithostratigraphic characterization and correlation between core description, logging data, and precruise seismic survey profiles. At Sites U1547 and U1548, a total of 31 in sit u formation temperature measurements were taken with the APCT- 3 and SET2 tools. The resulting geothermal gradient of ${\sim}650^{\circ}$ to almost $1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ as well as thermal conductivity measurements wer e used to calculate a heat flow that varies between ${\sim}520$ and ${\sim}930$ $\mathrm{{mW/m^{2}}}$ , depending on the vicinity to the Ringvent mound. Conductivity measurements at Site U1548 show values in the sedimen t layers that are similar to those at Site U1547. Sites U1548 and U154 7 show similar profiles for density, porosity, strength, NGR, MS, an d $P$ -wave velocity in the upper $90\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. Petrophysical variations highlight well the main lithostratigraphic changes at Sit e  

U1548 through correlated variations in density and NGR values. Mafic sill material recovered from Site U1547 shows thick continuous intrusion sheets, and no bottom contact was encountered.  

# Site U1549  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1549 (proposed Site GUAYM-16A) is located ${\sim}9.5~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the northern axial graben of Guaymas Basin (Figur e F1) and ${\sim}780\,\mathrm{m}$ northwest of a mound-shaped seafloor feature (Figure F11) where active cold-seep communities have been documented by precruise site surveys. In addition, seismic data at thi s location were interpreted to show an underlying sill at ${\sim}450$ mbs f and indicate gas movement along and around a pipe structure (Figure F11). This association of a relatively deep sill, active gas venting, and seafloor communities connects multiple components of th e carbon budget of a sill-driven vent/seep system. The sedimentar y setting at Site U1549 is intermediate between the biogenic-dominated sedimentation observed at Sites U1545 and U1546 and th e dominantly terrigenous deposition documented southeast of th e northern axial graben (Sites U1550 and U1551). The primary objectives for Site U1549 are thus to characterize the physical, chemical, and microbial properties of this sedimentologically intermediat e setting and to assess the influence of the underlying sill and associated altered sediments on carbon cycling in the subseafloor.  

# Operations  

Two holes were cored at Site U1549. Hole U1549A is located a t $27^{\circ}28.3317^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , 111°28.7844ʹW in a water depth of $1840.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hol e U1549A, we used the APC system to advance from the seafloor to  a final depth of 168.0 mbsf with a recovery of $166.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(99\%)$ . W e made formation temperature measurements at several depths usin g the APCT-3  tool.  In  Hole  U1549B,  located  at $27^{\circ}28.3383\,\mathrm{N},$ $111^{\circ}28.7927^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1841.2\;\mathrm{m},$ , we deployed the AP C system. Cores penetrated from the seafloor to a final depth o f 166.9 mbsf and recovered $164.4\mathrm{\,m~}(99\%)$ . Hole U1549B was dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole for all cores to monito r drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. The pace of coring in Hol e U1549B was adjusted to accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducted on the core receiving platform. A total o f $51.1\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , or 2.1 days, were spent at Site U1549. An overview of cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for Sit e U1549 is given in Table T1.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sediments recovered at Site U1549 are late to middle Pleistocene in age and are mostly biogenic (mainly diatom ooze) with  a significant $(\mathrm{\sim}10\%)$ proportion of sand- to silt-sized siliciclastic components that occur either mixed with the biogenic component o r concentrated in discrete laminae and beds (Figure F12). No majo r diagenetic changes were observed, probably because of the relatively shallow subseafloor depth reached at this site, leading to th e characterization of a single lithostratigraphic unit (Unit I). Th e most common lithology observed is olive gray, clay- to silt-rich diatom ooze. Unlike what was observed at the northwestern (Site s U1545/U1546) and Ringvent (Sites U1547/U1548) sites, the diato m ooze is primarily nonlaminated. The terrigenous-dominated, depositional layers that are intercalated with diatom ooze range from  a few centimeters to a meter in thickness with sharp bases that ar e locally marked by a coarser basal lamina of silt- to sand-sized bioclasts (foraminifers and small bivalves). The thickest beds occasionally have a base of laminated, bioclastic sand with a few coars e siliciclastic particles. Other coarse siliciclastic (silt- to sand-sized ) depositional layers were also recognized, and they range from laminae of a few millimeters in thickness to beds as thick as $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{m}$ . Th e thickest of these beds are normally graded and associated with basa l sand to silty sand that shows scouring at the base. Four exceptionally thick, normally graded terrigenous depositional layers wer e noted in the lithologic succession. Three of these beds were clearl y correlated between Holes U1549A and U1549B and show a characteristic increase in NGR, MS, and color parameter $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ . The depositional layers composed of homogenous biogenic and siliciclasti c components are interpreted to be the products of slope instabilit y and mass-gravity deposition, including hybrid flows.  

# Structural geology  

Structural information was obtained from sedimentary sequences at Site U1549. None of the samples were sufficiently lithified to be measured independently as WR pieces. Tilted lamina e seen in Cores 385-U1549A-2H and 3H suggest small-scale slum p folds, but the rest of Holes U1549A and U1549B mostly have laminae that are roughly perpendicular to the axis of the hole. One chevron fold with a horizontal fold axis was found in interval 385- U1549A-3H-1, $42{-}47\,\mathrm{cm}$ (from $\mathord{\sim}16.4$ to $16.5\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ ). Tilted beddin g was noted starting in Section 385-U1549A-16H-1 (at $139.5~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and continues to deeper levels in Cores 385-U1549A-17H and 18 H with values typically from $10^{\circ}$ to $15^{\circ}$ . A few brittle faults were seen a t different depths in the section, but overall there is much less faulting in this sedimentary section than at Ringvent Sites U1547 an d U1548, northern Guaymas rift Site U1550, and northwestern Guaymas Basin Sites U1545/U1546.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous  nannofossils  are  abundant  to  common  wit h good/moderate preservation throughout the entire sampled sequence at Site U1549, and the barren interval seen at Sites U1545– U1548 is not present at this site. Reworked nannofossils include  a significant component of Miocene taxa with a greatly reduced contribution of reworked Cretaceous specimens. In general, marine diatoms are dominant to abundant with good/moderate preservatio n throughout Hole U1549A, except at 63.62 and 71.23 mbsf, where diatoms have a common abundance. Freshwater diatoms in Hol e U1549A are much more frequent than at the northwestern an d Ringvent sites, particularly at similar depths. This suggests stron g influence of terrestrial input. No evidence of diagenetic alteration o f diatoms is present in Hole U1549A. The occurrence of $E$ . huxleyi from the top to the bottom of the hole dates the entire sediment sequence to Holocene–middle Pleistocene, or 0–0.29 Ma (Hol e $\mathrm{U1549A}=0{-}168.35~\mathrm{mbsf})$ . This age assignment is consistent wit h the absence of $P\!\!\!\!/$ lacunosa $\mathrm{(LAD=0.44\;Ma)}$ and $\boldsymbol{F}$ reinholdii (LA D $\mathbf{\mu=\,0.62\,Ma})$ ) in all examined samples. The estimated average sedimentation rate is $>\!580\;\mathrm{m},$ /My $(>58.0\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization of up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was performed on archivehalf sections with the SRM on all APC sediment cores from Hol e U1549A. The drilling-induced overprint was successfully remove d from all cores (from the seafloor to ${\sim}168~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) upon demagnetization. Inclination values after demagnetization at $20\,\mathrm{~mT~}$ cluste r around $46^{\circ}$ , which corresponds to the expected GAD inclination a t the latitude of the site (46.1°). A detailed analysis of the remanenc e of discrete samples from Hole U1549A shows that the drilling-induced overprint is removed by $10~\mathrm{mT}$ and the characteristic remanent magnetization is in accordance with the SRM measurements. The NRM of archive-half sections is higher at ${\sim}16{-}19$ , ${\sim}69.5{-}70,$ , and 79.5–80 mbsf. These intervals correspond to sandy layers tha t contain more detrital material. Hole U1549A cores were assigned t o the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younger than $0.78\;\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{,}}^{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ ). No paleomagnetic measurements were carried out in Hole U1549B.  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 65 IW samples were collected by hydraulic pressin g (35 from the seafloor to $160~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and Rhizons (30 from the seafloor to 30 mbsf in Hole U1549A). Based on the sulfate profile, th e SMTZ is estimated at 30 mbsf in Hole U1549A and 25 mbsf in Hol e U1549B. Below the SMTZ, alkalinity reaches a high maximum valu e of $85~\mathrm{mM}$ . $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ has a higher concentration than seawater (53. 5 mM), and its maximum value reaches $65~\mathrm{mM}$ below the SMTZ. I n addition, downhole concentration profiles of $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , B, and $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ generally display an increasing trend with higher values than those o f seawater. The IW chemical signatures at Site U1549 may be predominantly influenced by organic matter degradation related to microbial processes and by sediment–water interactions associate d with silicate weathering and mineral precipitation/dissolution processes.  

# Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1549, organic geochemists performed sampling an d analysis of gas and solid-phase samples. In Hole U1549A, one headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\:\mathrm{m}$ advance for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring; void gases were quantified and sample d for hydrocarbon content; and the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of particulate sediment were characterized. In Hole U1549B, hydrocarbon analyses were performed on headspace gas; $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ an d CO contents were measured; sediment carbon, nitrogen, and sulfu r contents were characterized; and a comprehensive suite of gas an d sediment samples was taken for postcruise analyses. Methane appears below ${\sim}25$ mbsf, and $C_{2}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons are all detectable a t depths below 60 mbsf. No anomalous $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values were observed. From elemental analysis, we inferred that the primary source of organic matter is marine in origin. In Hole U1549B, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO ar e present in low concentrations, which suggests that biological cycling is the dominant control on these gases.  

# Microbiology  

Hole U1549B samples represent horizons that inform our understanding of the cycle of carbon driven by fluid flow in the Guaymas Basin subseafloor. In contrast to the other Expedition 385 sites, Site U1549 is effectively a cold-seep site characterized by massgravity flows. Thus, the site has a relatively high proportion of terrigenous material and an attenuated thermal gradient that indicate s very moderate hydrothermal warming. As such, it provides an opportunity for microbiologists to examine the influence of thes e gravity flows on in situ microbial diversity and on activities within  a hydrothermal setting distal to the immediate influences of emplaced sills and/or extremely hot hydrothermal fluids. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, and RNA analyses wer e taken on the core receiving platform, preserved or frozen, an d stored for further analyses. WR core samples were either stored in  a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processed further for shore-based analyses. WR sample processing wa s conducted either inside a Coy Laboratory Products anaerobi c chamber or on the bench with a KOACH open clean zone system t o maintain conditions that were as sterile as possible. Samples fo r PFT measurements were taken on the core receiving platform usin g a syringe at six distinct horizons. Cell abundance for selected samples was determined by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cell abundance was $0.94~\times~10^{6}$ cells $^\prime\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in botto m seawater and $6.3\,\times\,10^{8}\;\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in seafloor sediments. Below th e seafloor, cell abundance gradually decreased to below the detectio n limit of the protocol used for shipboard measurements.  

# Petrophysics  

Physical properties measured on WR and working-half core sections from Holes U1549A and U1549B were compared for lithostratigraphic  characterization  and  correlation  of  visual  cor e description with physical properties. Four in situ formation temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 and SET 2 tools to calculate the geothermal gradient $(194^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ and heat flo w $(144\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ . Conductivity measurements show a similar tren d with depth in Holes U1549A and U1549B. We have identified on e main interval that correlates with Lithostratigraphic Unit I. However, NGR and MS peaks at ${\sim}70$ to 100 mbsf correlate with fou r depositional subunits. These physical properties along with densit y and $P$ -wave velocity values have a negative correlation with porosit y values. Thus, porosity values derived from moisture and densit y measurements show a general decrease with depth. In contrast, shear strength measurements show a linear increase due to th e presence of indurated sediments at depth.  

# Site U1550  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1550 (proposed Site GUAYM-06B) is located within th e axial graben of the northern Guaymas Basin spreading segmen t (Figures F1, F13). This site was established very close to DSDP Sit e 481 to take advantage of the known presence, depth, and characteristics of sills and indurated sediments at Site 481, and to clarify it s stratigraphy by redrilling it with improved coring tools and sampling approaches. Substantially improved recovery was expecte d relative to Site 481, leading to increased sampling resolution o f downhole changes and enabling the use of modern microbiologica l approaches. The fault-bounded setting of Site U1550 provides th e potential for high-flux fluid circulation in response to sill intrusion, leading to rapid cooling and potentially enhanced alteration due t o the rapid removal of dissolved phases and gases. The primary objectives for Site U1550 are to characterize the physical, chemical, an d microbial responses to sill intrusion into sediments at a high-flu x end-member location.  

# Operations  

We cored two holes at Site U1550 (proposed Site GUAYM-06B). Hole U1550A is located at $27^{\circ}15.1602\mathrm{N}$ , $111^{\circ}30.4163^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in a wate r depth of $2000.8\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1550A, we used the APC, HLAPC, an d XCB systems to advance from the seafloor to a final depth o f 207.0 mbsf with a recovery of $190.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(92\%)$ . We made formatio n temperature measurements at several depths with the APCT-3 an d SET2  tools.  In  Hole  U1550B,  located  at $27^{\circ}15.1704^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $111^{\circ}30.4451^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in a water depth of $2001.2\;\mathrm{m},$ we deployed the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems. Cores penetrated from the seafloor to  a final depth of 174.2 mbsf and recovered $160.8\;\mathrm{m}$ $(92\%)$ . Hol e U1550B was dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemica l sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole on al l cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. The pac e of coring in Hole U1550B was adjusted to accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducted on the core receivin g platform. A total of $72.0\;\mathrm{h},$ or 3.0 days, were spent at Site U1550. Table T1 provides an overview of cores, penetration depths, cor e recovery, and operations schedule for Site U1550.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

At Site U1550, a succession of sediments, sedimentary rocks , and igneous rocks was recovered (Figure F14). The sediments recovered can mainly be ascribed to two lithologic types: (1) a biogenic-dominated type, in which more or less laminated olive gra y diatom clays occur mixed with various proportions of nannofossil s and silt-sized siliciclastic particles, or (2) a siliciclastic-dominate d type in which coarse-grained siliciclastic components (sand an d silt), clay minerals, and subordinate diatoms occur either mixed i n homogenous layers or segregated in depositional layers often characterized by graded beds and scoured bases. Most of the thickes t graded terrigenous layers identified are traced between holes. Vertical changes in the character of the dominant lithology, the style o f bedding  and/or  deformation,  and  the  diagenetic  boundarie s prompted the subdivision of Unit I into three subunits. Subunit I A includes three thick terrigenous beds and displays evidence of softsediment deformation. The lower part of the subunit in both hole s is marked by a lithologically complex but correlative interval tha t includes a large concentration of silt- to granule-sized fragments o f scoria. Subunit IB is mainly composed of varying proportions of diatoms, clay, and silt, with sand occurring as a minor component. The upper part of the subunit contains a very distinctive, ${\sim}18\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, homogenous interval composed of olive green diatom clay. There are pronounced differences in Subunit IC between holes. I n Hole U1550A, the top of this subunit corresponds to the first appearance of carbonates (micrite/nodules). The latter occur scattered in diatom clay or as cementing crystals in coarser graine d (sand to silt) lithologies. Folding and tilting are common as well a s the presence of coarser grained beds, including a fourth thick terrigenous bed (Figure F14). Low diatom abundance and preservatio n suggest onset of silica diagenesis. In Hole U1550B, Subunit IC wa s identified in only three cores that are mainly composed of organicrich, yellowish-brown homogenous diatom clay with evidence o f soft-sediment deformation. The sediments recovered at Site U155 0 display a variety of sedimentary features, including graded bed s with scoured bases ranging from a few centimeters to several meters in thickness, tilted and/or folded beds or laminae, and chaoti c fabric. Taken together, these features are direct evidence that deposition at this site occurred mainly by means of mass-gravity flo w events.  

# Igneous petrology and alteration  

The dominant hypabyssal igneous lithology recovered from th e bottom of both Hole U1550A (upper contact at ${\sim}204$ mbsf wit h ${\sim}1.2~\mathrm{m}$ recovered) and Hole U1550B (upper contact at ${\sim}170$ mbs f with ${\sim}1.6\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered) is mafic rock with a doleritic texture. However, minor basaltic intervals with a sparsely to highly plagioclasephyric texture occasionally occur. Notably, there is a gradational change in grain size transitioning from basaltic to doleritic textur e within a distance of a few centimeters, indicating slower magma solidification. Nevertheless, there are also angular fragments of doleritic material entrapped in basalt intervals in Hole U1550B. Th e slightly to moderately altered igneous rocks are nonvesicular t o sparsely vesicular and contain multiple, slightly dipping calcite vein s running parallel to each other.  

# Structural geology  

Both Holes U1550A and U1550B exhibit folding and tilted bedding starting at 15 mbsf and continuing intermittently below. Thes e displacements are attributed to soft-sediment deformation an d slumping because they are variable on a small spatial scale. Significant faults are seen in both holes at about $130{-}140\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ where set s of parallel faults with apparent dips of about $60^{\circ}$ displace the sediment. These faults have a spacing of $0.2–1\textrm{m}$ in the cores, but th e amount and direction of displacement is unknown. The faults indicate an episode of deformation that occurred prior to the time o f deposition of sediments that are now found at about 130 mbsf.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils are abundant and common downhol e to 123.08 mbsf, rare/barren from 131.06 to 135.6 mbsf, and resum e abundant and common occurrences from 142.02 to 187.66 mbsf. Nannofossil preservation is good/moderate throughout the entir e sedimentary sequence. Marine diatoms are dominant to abundan t with good/moderate preservation in the upper interval of Hol e U1550A (0–72.51 mbsf). They alternate between abundant, common, and few with moderate to poor preservation at an intermediate depth range (81.02–123.08 mbsf), and range from few to rar e and barren with poor preservation in the lowermost interva l (131.06–200.55 mbsf). Apparent diagenetic alteration of diatoms i s present in samples with rare diatoms at the bottom of Hol e U1550A. The diatom assemblages are obviously different from Site s U1545, U1546, U1547, and U1548, possibly suggesting strong disturbance of sedimentation sequences by underwater mass-flo w events. The occurrence of calcareous nannofossil $E$ . huxleyi fro m the top to the bottom of both holes dates the entire sediment sequence to Holocene–middle Pleistocene, or 0–0.29 Ma (Hol e $\mathrm{U1550A}=0{-}200.55\mathrm{~mbsf})$ ). This age assignment is consistent wit h the absence of $P\!\!\!\!/$ lacunosa $\left(\mathrm{LAD}=0.44\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and $\boldsymbol{F}$ reinholdii (LA D $\mathbf{\mu=\,0.62\Ma)}$ in all samples examined. The estimated average sedimentation rate is >692 m/My $(>69.2\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ ).  

# Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization of up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was carried out with th e SRM on archive-half sections on all sediment cores from Hol e U1550A (Cores 385-U1550A-1H through 29X). The drilling-induced overprint was successfully removed from APC and HLAP C cores (from the seafloor to ${\sim}130~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) upon demagnetization. Inclination values after demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $46^{\circ}$ , which is comparable to the expected GAD inclination at the latitud e of the site $(45.9^{\circ})$ . A detailed analysis of the remanence of discret e samples from Hole U1550A shows that the drilling-induced overprint was removed by $10\;\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and the characteristic remanent magnetization agrees with the SRM measurements. Unfortunately, XC B cores were overprinted and too disturbed to yield reliable paleomagnetic data. Nevertheless, three discrete samples were collecte d in XCB cores and their inclination values are consistent with what i s expected. Thus, Hole U1550A cores were assigned to the norma l Brunhes Chron C1n (younger than $0.78\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ). Sedimentary discret e samples taken in Hole U1550A predominantly show prolate behavior through the hole with the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{max}}$ principal axis of AMS distribute d in the horizontal plane. The archive-half sections containing igneous rocks (Cores 385-U1550A-30X through 32X and Cores 385-  

U1550B-22X through 23X) were only measured for their NRM because AF demagnetization treatment was not effective.  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 42 IW samples were collected at Site U1550. Th e SMTZ at this site is located at ${\sim}10$ mbsf. The IW chemical properties show spatial and vertical heterogeneities, exhibiting a slight difference between Holes U1550A and U1550B (e.g., alkalinity, ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , and B) and changing significantly between the upper and lowe r parts of the sediment succession throughout both holes. In the upper part of Site U1550 $(0{-}40\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), alkalinity reaches very high values of up to $90~\mathrm{mM_{\mathrm{{)}}}}$ , and ${\mathrm{M}}\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ accumulates to values higher tha n seawater concentration, whereas $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ shows a decreasing trend du e to authigenic carbonate precipitation. Below 100 mbsf, alkalinit y and Mg decrease with depth, and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}.$ , and $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ concentrations increase with depth. These elements show remarkable excursions above the sill. Thus, the IW chemical properties in thi s interval are likely to be influenced by the sill, as previously evidenced at Site 481 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1982).  

# Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1550, organic geochemists performed sampling an d analysis of gas and solid-phase samples. In Hole U1550A, one headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of advance for routine hydrocarbon safety monitoring; void gases were quantified an d sampled for hydrocarbon, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents; and the carbon, nitrogen and sulfur contents of particulate sediment were characterized. In Hole U1550B, hydrocarbon, $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ and CO analyses wer e performed on headspace and void gas samples. Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of sediment were characterized, and a comprehensive suite of gas and sediment samples for post-cruise analyse s were taken. Methane and $C_{2}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons are detectable a t depths below ${\sim}7$ mbsf. Low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values that displayed an anomalous relationship with temperature were observed in both Hole s U1550A and U1550B. The lowest ratios occurred between ${\sim}100$ an d $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf, but the concentrations of higher hydrocarbon were lo w and $C_{1}/C_{2}$ values returned to normal further downhole. From elemental analysis, we infer that the primary source of organic matte r is marine in origin, although some samples indicate terrestrial organic matter input, and others are ambiguous because of the influence of mineral-associated nitrogen. In Hole U1550B, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and C O are present at nanomolar concentrations.  

# Microbiology  

Hole U1550B is located in the northern axial graben, ${\sim}51\,\mathrm{~m~}$ southeast of Site 481 where past studies included enrichments fo r hydrogenotrophic methanogens and detected living methanogen s in shallow cores. Because of its cool temperatures, this site present s an opportunity for microbiologists to examine the microbial abundance and community structure in sediments with a lower temperature gradient compared to the other sites of Expedition 385. Syring e samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, and RNA analyse s were taken on the core receiving platform, preserved or frozen, an d stored for further analyses. WR core samples were either stored in  a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a cold room of $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ an d processed further for shore-based analyses. WR core sample processing was conducted either inside a Coy Laboratory Products anaerobic chamber or on the bench with a KOACH open clean zon e system to maintain conditions that were as sterile as possible. Samples for PFT measurements were taken on the core receiving platform by syringe at nine distinct horizons. Cell abundance fo r selected samples was determined by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cell abundance was $3.1\times10^{6}$ cells $^{\prime}\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ i n bottom seawater, whereas seafloor sediments showed $1.1~\times~10^{9}$ $\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Below the seafloor, cell abundance gradually decreased t o below the detection limit of the protocol used for shipboard measurements.  

# Petrophysics  

Measurements of physical properties made on WR and working-half core sections were compared between Holes U1550A an d U1550B for lithostratigraphic characterization and correlation of visual core description with physical properties. Four in situ formation temperature measurements were conducted using the APCT- 3 and SET2 tools to calculate the geothermal gradient $(135^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ and heat flow $\mathrm{110\,mW/m^{2}})$ . Conductivity measurements betwee n Holes U1550A and U1550B show a similar increasing trend wit h depth. Three main depth intervals are characterized by notabl e petrophysical strength variations between the seafloor and 43 mbsf, from 43 to $86.5~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and below $96.5\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , showing significant increases in either shear strength or both shear and compressiona l strength. These features are embedded in a rheology trend of generally increasing shear and compressive strength downhole wherea s porosity strongly decreases because of the presence of a sill at th e bottom of both holes. Strength and porosity measurements correlate positively with three lithologic subunits (Subunits IA, IB, an d IC) and negatively with the rest of the physical properties (e.g., bul k density). Physical properties in Holes U1550A and U1550B sho w good correlation with depth except at ${\sim}80{-}90$ mbsf where the peak s of NGR, MS, and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity show an offset of $10~\mathrm{m}$ betwee n the two holes (at ${\sim}80$ mbsf in Hole U1550A and ${\sim}90$ mbsf in Hol e U1550B). Also, these physical properties reveal the presence of a sil l in both holes (at 204 mbsf in Hole U1550A and 170 mbsf in Hol e U1550B).  

# Site U1551  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1551 (proposed Site GUAYM-15A) is located ${\sim}29\ \mathrm{km}$ southeast of the axial graben of the northern Guaymas Basi n spreading segment (Figures F1, F15). The type of sediment, th e depositional environment, and the type, size, and, presumably, ag e of sill intrusions were all proposed to differ in the southeastern sid e of the spreading segment relative to the northwestern side. The sediment at Site U1551 was predicted to be predominately terrigenou s and deposited as gravity flows ranging from landslides to turbidites, with the underlying sills appearing to be larger and more saucershaped than those in the northwest. It was hypothesized that th e physical and chemical properties of sediments may impact alteration in response to sill intrusion, and this may have consequence s for carbon cycling. Moreover, the physical properties of the sediments may influence the size and shape of the sills beneath Sit e U1551. This in turn may impact permeability evolution with enhanced induration, ultimately affecting the efficiency of alteration. The greater presence of terrestrial organic carbon and metals predicted in these sediments relative to the northwestern part of th e basin may also affect sediment alteration and its products. The primary scientific objective at Site U1551 was to constrain the influence of sediment type, an important factor controlling alteratio n and carbon cycling, on sill morphology by studying the response o f predominantly terrigenous sediments to sill intrusion.  

# Operations  

Two holes were cored at Site U1551 (proposed Site GUAYM15A). Hole U1551A is located at $27^{\circ}12.3887\,\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , 111°13.1943ʹW in  a water depth of $1844.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1551A, we used the APC an d HLAPC systems to advance from the seafloor to a final depth o f 120.3 mbsf with a recovery of $122.1\;\mathrm{m}\;(102\%)$ . We made formatio n temperature measurements at several depths using the APCT- 3 tool. Coring was terminated because unconsolidated sand layer s prevented us from reaching the deeper drilling objectives. In Hol e U1551B, located at $27^{\circ}12.3832\,\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , 111°13.1841ʹW in a water depth o f $1843.9\;\mathrm{m},$ we deployed the APC system. Cores penetrated from th e seafloor to a final depth of 48.5 mbsf and recovered $50.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ . Hole U1551B was dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole on all cores to monitor drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. The pace of coring in Hole U1551B was at times adjusted to accommodate the complex microbial sampling program conducted on th e core receiving platform. A total of $34.3\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 1.4 days, were spent a t Site U1551. Its cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and operations schedule are displayed in Table T1.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sediments recovered at Site U1551 are assigned to Lithostratigraphic Unit I. They represent a combination of biogenic (diatom ooze to diatom clay) and terrigenous (sand/silt/clay grade ) components with the highest overall proportion of silty to sandy intervals $(\sim\!60\%)$ cored during Expedition 385 (Figure F16). Macroscopic core description and microscopic smear slide analysis sho w that two main types of lithologic components are clustered in fou r different stratigraphic intervals. These lithologic patterns are reflected in the NGR, MS, and color reflectance data, forming the basis of the division of Unit I into four subunits, with Subunits IA an d IC dominated by biogenic sedimentation and Subunits IB and I D appearing more siliciclastic in character. Lithologies in which th e content of diatoms is very high $(>\!85\%)$ are mainly found in Subuni t IA. The underlying Subunit IB includes authigenic carbonates tha t occur in small patches of micrite, partly cemented sandstone intervals, or carbonate concretions. This subunit also contains thic k sand beds, and overall, it is dominated by coarser grained siliciclastic sediments that correspond to higher MS and NGR values. Subunit IC is composed of silt-rich diatom clay and clay-rich, mainl y homogenous, diatom ooze alternating with beds of gray sand an d silty sand. Subunit ID is mainly composed of medium-grained sand, which is partially interpreted to represent coring-induced flow-i n rather than in situ deposition. Although Site U1551 and Site U154 9 share many lithostratigraphic similarities, the former contain s larger proportions of siliciclastic material. The predominance of siliciclastic components over biogenic ones and the presence o f coarse-grained mass-gravity deposits suggest that the deposition a t this site was more influenced by terrigenous sources than at th e other sites drilled in Guaymas Basin during Expedition 385. Thi s may be related to the more proximal location of Site U1551 to th e Yaqui River delta.  

# Structural geology  

At Site U1551, Holes U1551A and U1551B penetrated Lithostratigraphic Unit I, recovering a sedimentary sequence of diato m ooze, diatom clay, sand, and silt. Bedding and lamination in the sedimentary succession are similar to those described for Sites U1545– U1550. However, Site U1551 has intervals of massive sand in whic h the lack of stratification prevented any deformation structures fro m being identified. Folds are seen in Subunit IB in both holes, wher e contortion and soft-sediment deformation produced steep to overturned bedding below ${\sim}15$ mbsf. The folded strata are cut by a single set of faults with subparallel orientations and apparent dips o f $45^{\circ}{-}70^{\circ}$ . Faults were found in some deeper intervals. The differences in depths characterizing the folded strata in Holes U1551 A and U1551B may have been partly caused by faulting prior to th e deposition of Subunit IA. No faulting is inferred in Subunit IA a t Site U1551, based on the stratigraphic similarity between the tw o drill holes.  

# Biostratigraphy  

In Hole U1551A, calcareous nannofossils are abundant to rar e down to 96.8 mbsf with two barren intervals around 24.8 and 25. 1 mbsf. Downhole, nannofossils are barren in the interval $102.14-$ 116.19 mbsf and abundant in the bottom sample from 119.01 mbsf. Nannofossil preservation is good and moderate throughout the entire sedimentary sequence except for two samples with poor preservation at 22.0 and 25.8 mbsf. The barren intervals correspond t o recovered sections of predominantly sandy lithology. Marine diatoms are abundant with good preservation only in the uppermos t part of Site U1551. Then, they decrease in abundance with moderate to poor preservation from the seafloor to 36.9 mbsf, followed b y an interval without diatoms from 36.9 to 61.22 mbsf. Diatoms var y from common to rare with moderate to poor preservation from 7 1 to $108.28\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and they are barren at the bottom of Hole U1551A. Diatoms are abundant but poorly preserved in a spot sample fro m 119.0 mbsf at the bottom of Hole U1551A. The occurrence of $E$ . huxleyi from the seafloor downhole to the bottom of Hole U1551 A dates the entire sediment sequence to Holocene–middle Pleistocene, or $0{-}0.29\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Hole $\mathrm{U}1551\mathrm{A}=0{-}119.01$ mbsf). This age assignment is consistent with the absence of $P_{\star}$ lacunosa $\mathrm{(LAD=0.44}$ Ma) and $\boldsymbol{E}$ reinholdii $\mathrm{(LAD=0.62\,Ma)}$ ) in all examined samples. Th e estimated  average sedimentation rate is ${>}410.4\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My}$ $(>\!41.04\!\$ $\mathrm{{cm/ky})}$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization of up to $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ was carried out with th e SRM on all sediment archive-half core sections from Hole U1551 A (Cores 385-U1551A-1H through 19F). The drilling-induced overprint was successfully removed from APC and HLAPC cores (fro m the seafloor to ${\sim}120~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) upon demagnetization. Inclination values after demagnetization at $20\,\mathrm{\mT}$ cluster around $47^{\circ}$ , which i s comparable to the expected GAD inclination at the latitude of th e site $(45.8^{\circ})$ . A detailed analysis of the remanence of discrete sample s from Hole U1551A shows that the drilling-induced overprint is removed by $10\;\mathrm{mT},$ and the characteristic remanent magnetization i s in accordance with the SRM measurements. Thus, Hole U1551 A cores were assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younge r than $0.78\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ). Sedimentary discrete samples taken in Hole U1551 A predominantly show prolate behavior throughout the hole, with th e $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{max}}$ principal axis of AMS distributed in the horizontal plane. N o paleomagnetic measurements were implemented in Hole U1551B.  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

In Holes U1551A and U1551B, a total of $18~\mathrm{IW}$ samples wer e taken from all lithologies except for unconsolidated sands. It ha s been challenging to decipher the IW properties because of the limited number of collected IW samples as a consequence of the abundance of sand. However, as demonstrated by the nearly complet e sulfate depletion that coincides with a concentration peak for dissolved sulfide, the SMTZ is located at ${\sim}25$ mbsf. Authigenic carbonate precipitation was also observed visually, and the precipitatio n depth coincides with a sharp decrease in $C\mathrm{a}^{2+}$ concentrations.  

# Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1551, organic geochemists sampled and analyzed ga s and solid-phase samples. In Hole U1551A, one headspace gas sample was analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of advancement for routine hydrocarbo n safety monitoring, and the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents o f particulate sediment were characterized. In Hole U1551B, hydrocarbon analyses on headspace gas were performed at high resolution (two per $9.5\textrm{m}$ of core), $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents were measured, and carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents of sediment were characterized. Hydrocarbon gases are detectable below $\mathord{\sim}30$ mbsf and ar e primarily composed of methane and ethane. $C_{3}{\mathrm{-}}C_{6}$ hydrocarbon s were detected in only a few intervals at very low concentrations. Gas concentration with depth is strongly influenced by the presenc e of sand. From elemental analysis, we infer that the primary source o f organic matter in organic-rich intervals is marine in origin. Th e presence of mineral nitrogen in the organic-poor levels prevents interpreting the C/N values in terms of organic source. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO ar e present at nanomolar concentration levels and exhibit no trend wit h depth.  

# Microbiology  

Site U1551 is located on the southeastern flanking region o f Guaymas Basin in an area of low heat flow and is influenced b y terrigenous sedimentation derived from the Yaqui River, whic h drains the Sierra Madre Occidental and coastal Sonora. Consequently, this site presents an opportunity for microbiologists to examine microbial abundance and community structure in terrestrial organic carbon–enriched sediments with more moderate temperature gradients compared to the other sites drilled during Expeditio n 385. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, an d RNA analyses were taken on the core receiving platform, preserve d or frozen, and stored for further analyses. WR core samples wer e either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processed further for shore-based analyses. WR cor e sample processing was conducted either inside a Coy Laborator y Products anaerobic chamber or on the bench with a KOACH ope n clean zone system to maintain conditions that were as sterile as possible. Samples for PFT measurements were taken on the core receiving platform by syringe at five distinct horizons. Cell abundance fo r selected samples was determined by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cell abundance was $1.1\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ i n bottom seawater and $0.9\times10^{9}\;\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in seafloor sediments. Below the seafloor, cell abundance gradually decreased, but it staye d above the detection limit of the protocol that we used for shipboar d measurements at the deepest sample obtained from Hole U1551B.  

# Petrophysics  

Physical properties at Site U1551 were measured on WR an d working-half core sections. Two holes were cored: Hole U1551A t o ${\sim}120$ mbsf and Hole U1551B to ${\sim}49$ mbsf. The acquired data wer e compared between holes for lithostratigraphic characterization an d correlation of core description information with the physical properties data. Four in situ formation temperature measurements wer e made with the APCT-3 tool to calculate geothermal gradien t $({\sim}100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ and heat flow $({\sim}108\;\mathrm{mW/m^{2}})$ ). Thermal conductivit y measurements from Hole U1551A show an increase with depth according to the composition of the sediment. Four distinct depth intervals  with  characteristic  patterns  were  identified  in  al l petrophysical parameters, mainly coinciding with maximum pea k values: from the seafloor to 15 mbsf, between ${\sim}15$ and $\mathord{\sim}65$ mbsf, from ${\sim}67\$ to 92 mbsf, and below 92 mbsf. Shear strength consistently increases with depth, coinciding with higher values in compressive  strength.  Porosity  and  density  values  derived  fro m moisture and density measurements show a strong negative correlation at all depths. The other measured physical properties (density, NGR, MS, and $P$ -wave velocity) show a positive correlation wit h depth that is in accordance with the corresponding presence of diatom ooze, clay, and sand beds.  

# Site U1552  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1552 (proposed Site GUAYM-10B) is located ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{km}$ northwest of the northern axial graben in Guaymas Basin (Figur e F17), proximal to the Sonora margin (Figure F1). The site is adjacent to a mostly buried mound that sits atop a pipe-like, acousticall y blanked zone that was observed in Seismic Line SO-112 (Figur e F17), extending toward the edge of an interpreted sill intrusion a t ${\sim}700$ mbsf. Cold-seep seafloor communities are known to exist i n the area above the edges of the interpreted deep sill. The moun d structure is similar to the surficial mound near Site U1549, wher e gas hydrate is present at the seafloor, and it was thus expected tha t massive gas hydrate would be sampled in Hole U1552A, which i s situated directly adjacent to the mostly buried mound. Like Sit e U1549, the association of a relatively deep sill, gas hydrates, an d nearby seafloor communities connects multiple components of th e carbon budget in a sediment deposition system influenced by  a deep sill. Therefore, the primary objectives for Site U1552 were t o characterize the physical, chemical, and microbial properties of thi s environment and to assess (1) the influence of the deep sill on I W chemistry and gas hydrate stability, (2) the role of gas hydrate as  a carbon-storage buffer, (3) the utilization of permeable pathways between the sill and the seafloor for the transport of deep thermogeni c gas, and (4) the impact of lateral gradients away from the pipe structure on microbial life.  

# Operations  

We cored three holes at Site U1552 (proposed Site GUAYM10B). Hole U1552A is located at $27^{\circ}33.2906\mathrm{\,N}$ , $111^{\circ}32.9665^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in  a water depth of $1841.6\:\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1552A, we used the APC syste m to advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 107.5 mbsf with  a recovery of $73.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(69\%)$ ). We made formation temperature measurements at several depths with the APCT-3 tool. In Hole U1552B, located  at $27^{\circ}33.2885\mathrm{N},$ , $111^{\circ}32.9640^{\prime}\mathbb{W}$ in  a  water  depth  o f $1841.1\;\mathrm{m},$ , APC coring penetrated from the seafloor to a final dept h of 55.0 mbsf and recovered $40.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(73\%)$ . Hole U1552B was dedicated to extensive microbial and biogeochemical sampling that required the deployment of PFTs downhole on all cores to monito r drilling fluid (seawater) contamination. Few cores from Hole s U1552A and U1552B recovered gas hydrates. In Hole U1552C, located at $27^{\circ}33.2181\,\mathrm{N}$ , $111^{\circ}32.8557^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ in a water depth of $1844.3\;\mathrm{m},$ , we deployed the APC system. Cores penetrated from the seafloor t o a final depth of 99.3 mbsf and recovered $78.3~\mathrm{m}$ $(79\%)$ . A total o f $32.6\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , or 1.4 days, were spent at Site U1552. Cores, penetratio n depths, core recovery, and operations schedule for all holes of Sit e U1552 are provided in Table T1.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The deepest hole (Hole U1552A) recovered a $105.2\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of sediments constituting Lithostratigraphic Unit I (Figur e F18). The lithologies at this site are mainly diatom clay, silty clay, and sandy silt, alternating at vertical scales of meters. The alternations occur throughout the recovered section without any specifi c trend or clustering of one lithology with respect to the others. Hence,  only  one  lithostratigraphic  unit  was  identified.  Hole s U1552A and U1552C have a high level of correlation observed a t the scale of a single bed. The most traceable of these beds are dominated by coarse-grained siliciclastic deposits (sand and silt). Th e thickest beds $(\sim\!5\,\textrm{m})$ exhibit scoured bases and normally grade d sand that fines upward into clayey silt to silty clay. The main biogenic components in the sediment are siliceous diatoms with rar e radiolarians and silicoflagellates. The silt to sand fraction mainl y consists of feldspar and lithic fragments with lesser quartz, micaceous, and dense minerals. Foraminifers also are a significant component  in  several  beds.  Overall,  calcareous  nannofossils  an d foraminifers are present throughout the recovered sediments, alon g with organic matter and plant debris. Authigenic carbonates occu r only in the upper part of the site as disseminated micrite (micrometer-sized authigenic carbonate particles) or as cements in small, sandy concretions. Fossil bivalves, belonging to the Lucinidae family, were observed at the uppermost part of all three holes. Hole s U1552A and U1552B recovered gas hydrates from ${\sim}25$ mbsf tha t decomposed quickly after the cores arrived on deck. As a consequence of hydrate dissociation and gas expansion, the sediment s were often disturbed. Thus, most cores displayed gas expansio n cracks and voids. Complex structures were observed in Hol e U1552C, including laminated diatom clay intervals that are crosscu t by gray clayey silt at high angle contacts, and which locally exten d down the core for as much as $1\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Structural geology  

Coring at Site U1552 was intended to constrain differences i n seismic reflection stratigraphy that were seen on either side of a seafloor mound. In the three holes cored, the sequence has beds tha t are generally horizontal, with no significant tilt domains or folde d strata. However, gas hydrates that disturbed the sediments wer e found at ${\sim}25$ mbsf in Holes U1552A and U1552B. Overall, Hol e U1552C revealed much more deformation than the other two holes, showing evidence for considerable injection and mobilization o f sand along a high-angle conduit or clastic dike that continue s through two sections of core. In some places, the clastic dike occupies a pre-existing fault plane. The remobilization of sand indicate s that a substantial volume of sediment may have been lost from below. Other oblique faults and fractures were found in Hole U1552 C at depths below the clastic dike, and we attribute these to mechanical instability caused by the presence of gas hydrates.  

# Biostratigraphy  

At Site U1552, calcareous nannofossils are well preserved wit h abundant to common occurrence throughout the entire sedimentary sequence, and marine diatoms are dominant/abundant to common with good/moderate preservation. No biostratigraphic datu m was defined in the generally continuous succession from the Holocene to the middle Pleistocene. The occurrence of calcareou s nannofossil $E_{i}$ . huxleyi at the bottom of both holes dates the entir e sediment sequence to Holocene–middle Pleistocene, or $0{-}0.29\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . This age assignment is consistent with the absence of $P_{\star}$ lacunosa $\mathrm{(LAD=0.44\;Ma)}$ ) and $\boldsymbol{F}$ reinholdii $\mathrm{(LAD=0.62\,Ma)}$ ) in all examine d samples. The estimated average sedimentation rate is $>\!362.6\;\mathrm{m/My}$ $(>\!36.26\,\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .  

# Paleomagnetism  

AF demagnetization of up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ was conducted with th e SRM on all sediment archive-half core sections from Hole U1552 A (Cores 385-U1552A-1H through 12H) and Hole U1552C (Core s 385-U1552C-1H through 11H). A small drilling-induced overprin t was successfully removed following demagnetization. Inclinatio n values after demagnetization at $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ cluster around $40^{\circ}$ and $43^{\circ}$ fo r Holes U1552A and U1552C, respectively, which is slightly lowe r than the expected GAD inclination at the latitude of the sit e $(\sim\!46.2^{\circ})$ . Only the NRM of archive-half sections in Hole U1552 B (Cores 385-U1552B-1H through 6H) was measured. A detaile d analysis of the remanence of discrete samples from Holes U1552 A and U1552C shows that the drilling-induced overprint was remove d by $5\;\mathrm{mT}$ and the characteristic remanent magnetization is in accordance with the SRM measurements. Thus, all Site U1552 cores wer e assigned to the normal Brunhes Chron C1n (younger than $0.78\,\mathrm{Ma}_{}^{}$ ).  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

A total of 31 IW samples were collected at Site U1552. Based o n the sulfate profile and a slight increase of methane, the SMTZ is estimated at 10 mbsf. Salinity and $C1^{-}$ concentrations were measure d on gas hydrate–bound water from Hole U1552C. Salinity values of  2 $\mathrm{mM}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ values of $10.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ are both depleted compared to seawater (salinity $=35~\mathrm{mM}$ ; $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}=559\ \mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}^{}$ ). Thus, the dissociation o f gas hydrate could cause anomalies in the retrieved IW as observe d in the ${\sim}500\mathrm{~mM~Cl^{-}}$ concentration at 25 mbsf from Hole U1552C. Below the SMTZ, many cation concentrations $(\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , etc. ) increased, except the $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ concentration. Alkalinity reached values o f as high as $175~\mathrm{mM}$ , which was the highest value recorded at any o f the Expedition 385 sites.  

# Organic geochemistry  

At Site U1552, organic geochemists sampled and analyzed ga s samples. In Hole U1552A, one to two headspace gas samples wer e analyzed per $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of advancement for routine hydrocarbon safet y monitoring, and void gases were quantified and sampled for hydrocarbon content. In Hole U1552B, hydrocarbon analyses on headspace gas were performed; $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO contents in headspace vial s were measured; and void gases were quantified and sampled for hydrocarbons, $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ and CO contents. In Hole U1552C, hydrocarbo n analyses on headspace gas were performed and void gases wer e quantified and sampled for hydrocarbon, $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ and CO contents a s well as for shore-based analyses. Because time was running out a t the conclusion of Expedition 385, no Site U1552 sediment sample s were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur contents. Site U155 2 featured the presence of gas hydrates in the sediment between 9 an d 27 mbsf. Maximum methane concentrations in headspace gas wer e detected in this depth interval. $C_{2}-C_{6}$ hydrocarbons were detectabl e at depths below ${\sim}25$ mbsf without a clear trend downhole. Th e abundance of dissolved gas in the sediment was marked by an abundance of voids in the cores, which could represent more than $100\%$ of the sediment recovery. Methane was dominant in these voids. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO were detected in the void gases, but showed no clear tren d downhole.  

# Microbiology  

Site U1552 provided access to hydrate-rich sediments overlyin g cooler, deep sills on the northern flank of Guaymas Basin near th e transition to the Sonora margin. This site presented an opportunit y for microbiologists to examine microbial abundance and community structure changes throughout the gas hydrate stability zone i n the sediment. Syringe samples for cell counts, 3-D structural imaging, and RNA analyses were taken on the core receiving platform, preserved or frozen, and stored for further analyses. WR core samples were either stored in a $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer or temporarily stored in  a $4^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ cold room and processed further for shore-based analyses. WR core sample processing was conducted either inside a Coy Laboratory Products anaerobic chamber or on the bench with  a KOACH open clean zone system to maintain conditions that wer e as sterile as possible. Cell abundance for selected samples was determined by direct counting with an epifluorescence microscope. Cell abundance was $6.6\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in bottom seawater and $1.2\times10^{9}$ cells/ $\scriptstyle\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in seafloor sediments. Below the seafloor, cell abundanc e gradually decreased but stayed above the detection limit of the protocol that we used for shipboard measurements at the deepest sample obtained from Hole U1552B.  

# Petrophysics  

Physical properties were measured on WR and split-core sections. The acquired data were compared between Holes U1552 A and U1552C for lithostratigraphic characterization and correlatio n of core description information with physical properties data. Seve n in situ formation temperature measurements were taken with th e APCT-3 tool to calculate the geothermal gradient $(262^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km})$ an d heat flow $(222\,\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ ). Two different intervals were identified i n all petrophysical parameters. From the seafloor to ${\sim}12$ mbsf and a t 18–87 mbsf, density, NGR, and MS are mainly constant. Peaks observed at ${\sim}18\$ , ${\sim}58$ , and ${\sim}93$ mbsf show increases in density, NGR, and MS values and decreases in porosity and strength values. Porosity measured on discrete moisture and density samples generall y outlines a trend that mirrors the bulk density measurements. Th e shear and compressive strengths increase with depth. For $P$ -wav e velocity, values from 12 mbsf to the bottom of both Holes U1552 A and U1552C predominately show an erratic pattern typically relate d to voids and cracks in the cores.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

# Fundamental design of Expedition 385  

Expedition 385 drilled sequences of marine sediments an d mafic sills in Guaymas Basin to explore how carbon cycling within  a young sedimentary rift basin is influenced by the interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes that accompany sill intrusio n into organic-rich sediments. Magmatic emplacement in Guayma s Basin is not limited to the spreading center, as at most mature midocean ridge systems, but it extends tens of kilometers away from th e divergent plate boundary, providing a diversity of sedimentary settings influenced by sill intrusion. Our drill sites followed a northwest–southeast transect across Guaymas Basin designed to captur e some of this diversity, including contrasting sediment depositional regimes, sediment type, sill intrusion depth, and sill intrusion age. Sites U1545 and U1546 targeted a cool but relatively young sill emplaced well off axis in virtually purely pelagic sediments. Site s U1547 and U1548 targeted a shallow, “warm,” active, and off-axis sill system within predominantly pelagic sediments. Sites U1549 an d U1552 were aimed at cold-seep systems apparently driven by conduits inherited from older sills, now deeply buried by hemipelagi c sediments. Site U1550 targeted sills emplaced within the axial graben that are subjected to a complex interaction of tectonics and sedimentation. The southernmost Site U1551 intended to drill ver y large, bowl-shaped sills intruded into primarily terrigenous massgravity flow sediment deposits.  

The drilling program at each site was designed to accommodat e multidisciplinary drilling objectives by generally combining Hole A, which was dedicated to comprehensive core description, sedimentology, thermal measurements, and initial geochemistry, with Hol e B, which was subjected to extensive microbiological and (bio)geochemical sampling. Whenever possible, APC or HLAPC coring wa s used, and we transitioned to XCB coring only when necessary t o penetrate harder sediment formations and the sediment/sill contac t zones. The RCB system was used for the sill intrusions to remarkable effect, providing a comparatively high core recovery throug h these igneous sections.  

# Site overview  

# Sites U1545 and U1546  

The first sites drilled were Sites U1545 and U1546, ${\sim}52\ \mathrm{km}$ northwest of the axial graben of the northern trough. These tw o sites were high priority because their comparison provides an idea l opportunity to quantitatively assess the influence of sill intrusion o n sediments. The two sites are separated by only ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{km}$ and thus contain nearly identical sedimentary strata, but they differ in that th e upper ${\sim}450~\mathrm{m}$ of these sediments at Site U1545 are undisturbed b y sill intrusion, whereas at Site U1546, the same sedimentary sequence has been intruded by a large sill $(\sim\!360{-}430~\mathrm{mbsf})$ . The paleosurface marking the intrusion event provides a reliable age o f ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{ka}$ , making the sill young enough to not have been affected b y post-emplacement tectonic processes but old enough to have completely cooled to the point where hydrothermalism is no longe r present. These sites are also ideal for developing an age model an d sedimentological framework for Guaymas Basin, owing to the nearcontinuous record of pelagic sediment accumulation to the tota l drilled depths $(>\!500\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ and to the lack of significant unconformities associated with tectonic or mass-wasting processes. Therefore, we drilled multiple holes at both sites and cored the complet e sediment and sill sequence with high recovery using mainly APC o r HLAPC coring within sediments and RCB coring within sills. W e obtained high-quality cores well suited for (bio)geochemistry an d microbiology sampling, including our best sediment record below  a major sill recovered from Site U1546. We also made multiple temperature measurements at each site, enabling a very precise calculation of the thermal gradients. We reached the upper temperatur e limit of the available measurement tools $(\sim\!80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ at each site, demonstrating that geothermal gradients are high to a great distance from the plate boundary.  

# Sites U1547 and U1548  

Sites U1547 and U1548 are situated inside and peripheral to th e circular hydrothermal mound structure of Ringvent, respectively. The original intent was to recover sediments overlying a hydrothermally active, shallow sill and thereby explore the dynamics of hydrothermal  circulation  and  the  associated  imprint  on  sedimen t diagenesis and microbiology. This plan was implemented but soo n took a backseat to drilling into the underlying sill. The Ringvent sil l developed into a defining target of this expedition. Its unexpecte d dimensions and texturally highly variable, fascinating basaltic lithology—with abundant vesicles, several generations of mineralize d veins seemingly related to multiple intrusive events, and brecciatio n associated with sediment contacts—contrasts with the simpler an d rather uniform structure of the singular massive basaltic-doleriticgabbroic sill of Site U1546. The microbiology and organic geochemistry laboratories adapted their sediment-focused research programs and sampled the Ringvent sill for gas and solid-phas e analyses, microbial cultivations, and gene and biomarker studies, whereas the petrophysics group examined the Ringvent sills’ unusual morphologies and thermal properties. As a result, Ringven t Sites U1547 and U1548 catalyzed an integrated sediment-sill research program that pulled together science party members from all the disciplines.  

# Sites U1549 and U1552  

Site U1549 originally targeted a well-studied, active, sill-associated methane seep site associated with an underlying sill. To avoi d drilling into shallow gas accumulations surrounding the seep area, the site was moved, and it subsequently served as a deep-basin offaxis reference site proximal to the Sonora margin that is unaffecte d by advective flux driven by a deeper sill. Site U1549 provides an instructive comparison to alternate Site U1552. Site U1552 is locate d proximal to the base of the Sonora margin and targeted the vicinit y of a hydrate-rich methane seep situated directly above a seismicall y imaged conduit extending upward from a deep sill that has an intrusion age likely much older than the sill at Site U1546. Both Site s U1549 and U1552 recovered a similar sedimentary sequence consisting of both marine sediments and sandy mass gravity-flow layers. Comparison of these sites provides several notable features. Massive gas hydrate was recovered in Site U1552 cores but not i n Site U1549 cores, though disseminated hydrate may be present a t Site U1549. Interestingly, the thermal gradient at Site U1552 is substantially steeper than at Site U1549. The IW chemistry differs between the two sites, including notably higher Mg content in the I W of the Site U1552 cores, which showed concentrations substantiall y greater than seawater. These observations suggest deeply burie d sills can promote advective flux of heat and chemical compound s that are relevant to carbon cycling long after sill emplacement.  

# Site U1550  

Site U1550, located in the northern axial trough of Guaymas Basin, was intended to be the “hydrothermal” representative along th e transect, based on the unspoken assumption that an axial sit e should experience higher heat flow and higher in situ temperature s than off-axis sites. Site U1550 was drilled in the immediate vicinit y of Site 481 from DSDP Leg 64, and it recovered short sill section s with veined structures and fractured morphology that resemble sill cores obtained at this location during Leg 64. Site 481 was also th e only site where thermal measurements were available (Shipboar d Scientific Party, 1982). However, because all Expedition 385 site s had larger thermal gradients than expected, this site turned out t o be the coldest, demonstrating that an axial location is by no mean s an accurate predictor of hydrothermal heat flow. The recovere d sedimentary column was dominated by event beds that demonstrate the influence of sediment slumping and mass-gravity flows o n sedimentation within the axial trough.  

# Site U1551  

Site U1551, located ${\sim}29~\mathrm{km}$ southeast of the axial trough, targeted large, deeply buried, bowl-shaped sills intruded into dominantly terrigenous sediments deposited as mass-gravity flows. This is end-member sill–sediment system is important because i t is representative of the sill systems emplaced during large igneou s events and implicated in global scale catastrophes. It is also important because metals, which are more dominant in terrigenou s sediments, are believed to facilitate pyrolysis and thus impact al l aspects of carbon cycling driven by sill intrusion. However, encountered thick layers of loose sands of these mass-flow sediment s destabilized the holes and the site had to be abandoned after establishing two relatively shallow holes. Although the deep sills coul d not be reached, Site U1551, the first scientific drilling site in southeastern Guaymas Basin, yielded new insights into sediment flo w and event-bed formation and highlighted the strong contrasts i n sedimentary environments between northwestern and southeastern Guaymas Basin.  

# Summary  

To summarize, the scientific focus of this expedition will be th e comparison of massively sedimented Sites U1545 and U1546 on th e northwestern end of Guaymas Basin, both successfully drilled an d recovered to depths exceeding $500\,\mathrm{\,m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , with Ringvent Sites U154 7 and U1548, where drilling penetrated a massive sill of previousl y unseen proportions (potentially with distinct subunits) and its shallow cover of biogenic and hemipelagic sediment with authigeni c mineral precipitates. In addition, sites closer to the Sonora margi n (Sites U1549 and U1552), in the northern axial trough (Site U1550), and on the southeastern flanking region (Site U1551) explored th e influence of terrigenous sedimentation, gas hydrate occurrence, an d cooler formation temperatures in different combinations.  

# Comparison of DSDP Leg 64 and Expedition 385  

The scientific objectives of Expedition 385 were similar to thos e of Leg 64, although in the final analysis, the overlap in scientific outcomes turned out to be less than expected. Both expeditions focused on the interaction of sills with sediments and the geochemica l consequences of sill emplacement, with actual overlap at axial Site s 481 and U1550. However, the contexts of the two expeditions wer e very different, and the overlap in site selection and scientific outcomes is actually limited. A key science objective of Leg 64 was understanding  mid-ocean  ridge  magmatism  in  the  presence  o f sediments. Leg 64 produced remarkable scientific results describin g the influence of sill intrusion on sediments and organic compound s within the high-permeability axial trough environment. At tha t time, and until very recently, it was believed that all mid-ocean ridg e magmatism was focused at the plate boundary, so there was no reason to imagine that a large variety of sill–sediment systems could b e present in the off-axis environment of Guaymas Basin, much less t o explore how carbon cycling may vary among those settings. Whereas Leg 64 focused exclusively on axial trough sill–sediment s systems, Expedition 385 expanded across the basin and provide d excellent records of the sedimented slopes and rift basin floor. It explored the contrasts between different settings, including: buried, cool sills in thermal equilibrium with surrounding sediments (Sit e U1546); shallow, hot sills that still function as a present-day hea t source for hydrothermal mineral precipitation and organic matte r alteration (Sites U1547 and U1548); and relic systems that still promote advective flow and support seafloor communities (Site s U1549 and U1552). Organic and inorganic geochemical profiles fo r Expedition 385 were generally more finely resolved, and once shorebased analyses are completed, they will include a wider spectrum o f ions and hydrocarbons. Today, the greater sensitivity and wide r range of stable ion analysis, coupled with high-powered analytica l chemistry, provides a versatile toolbox to constrain transformation s and origins of specific molecules. Leg 64 pioneered microbiologica l studies of the sedimentary subsurface with a cultivation survey o f methanogens using hydrogen and $C O_{2}$ as substrates. Cultivations, activity assays, metabolic rate measurements, DNA sequencing, genomics, and biomarker studies of the deep biosphere have take n over Expedition 385 to a large extent. Most of these techniques wer e not available or were in their infancy 40 y ago. However, these technical refinements do not change the fact that Leg 64 provided th e fundamental outlines for understanding the Guaymas Basin subsurface, regardless of whether some of these outlines require adjustments in the near future.  

# Scientific assessment  

Expedition results address research questions in several broa d categories that are described in the expedition’s Scientific Prospectus in the context of the major IODP scientific themes (Teske et al., 2018). At the risk of unduly simplifying that network of multidisciplinary research questions and hypotheses, we focus here on th e central motivating question of this expedition: to what extent do sill emplacement and associated hydrothermal activity retain or mobilize subsurface sedimentary carbon, and is this process modulate d by microbial activity? The framing of this basic question was shape d on the one hand by current hypotheses that posit dramatic thermogenic carbon release from sediments in response to sill intrusio n and, on the other hand, by the dominant influence of microbiall y mediated transformations on the fate of carbon within the uppe r ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ of marine sediments. Expedition 385 results shed new ligh t on aspects of both of these linked processes.  

A key question related to the purely thermal impacts of sill intrusion on sedimentary carbon follows: does sill emplacemen t within successions of organic-rich sediments transform and mobilize buried organic matter within a broad thermal alteration zon e surrounding the sill, with substantially reduced sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content near the sill and increased hydrocarbon concentrations above the sill? Based on shipboard datasets, th e answer to this question is “no” for the two types of sill/sediment settings studied at Sites U1546 and U1547. At those sites, decreasin g TOC and increasing hydrocarbon concentrations are limited to  a narrow contact interface, but dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) precipitation begins as solid carbonates at the sill contact zone and extends far into the overlying sediment where micrites are observed. Reduced sedimentary TOC concentrations were observed only i n very close proximity to the sill/sediment contact. The sill contac t was often marked by a solid layer of carbonates on top of the igneous sills, suggesting either remineralization and precipitation of local  sedimentary  organic  matter  upon  sill  emplacement  o r authigenic precipitation of pore water alkalinity. Methane concentrations increase substantially in very close proximity to a sill, bu t they do not form an extensive “hydrocarbon halo” that blurs into th e surrounding  sediment.  Rather  than  hydrocarbons,  small-scal e authigenic carbonate particles (micrite) are disseminated over wid e intervals in the sediment column. Sill intrusions could impact th e formation of carbonates in several ways. They may make methan e more available for microbially mediated increased alkalinity; the y may provide cations needed to form carbonate, in particular ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ , which may explain the observed abundance of dolomite; and the y create steeper thermal gradients that may accelerate the diageneti c and possibly microbially catalyzed reactions that contribute to micrite formation, pushing the micrite-forming zone upward in th e sediment column.  

Expedition 385 results of cored sediments adjacent to and surrounding sills tend to deflate the hypothesis that a combination o f hot sill and organic-rich sediments necessarily leads to substantial thermal alteration. However, cores of the sills themselves suggest a n entirely new and exciting hypothesis: sills are not only a passive medium for heat transfer; instead, the sill matrix itself plays a chemica l role as a precipitation zone and storage medium for carbon. Consistent observations of calcite precipitation in vesicles and veins i n host sills suggest that sills catalyze carbon precipitation and thu s carbon sequestration within the sill itself. The carbon source remains to be identified; it may be sedimentary IW or seawater entrapped during sill emplacement or circulating through the porou s sill, or perhaps it is of a more juvenile (magmatic) origin. Paralle l observations of large amounts of methane in porous sill host roc k indicate a major carbon reservoir and suggest that sills may act as  a methane capacitor, with limited diffusion into adjacent sediment. The sources of the pore space methane—microbial production fro m DIC and $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ methanogenic degradation of low molecular weigh t (LMW) organic compounds, or hydrothermal reactions without direct microbial participation—remain to be identified. Calcite an d methane represent the opposite redox extremes of carbon, but th e sill host rock also needs to be examined closely for chemically intermediate carbon forms, such as graphite, to complete the carbon inventory.  

Carbon sources and transformation pathways in the subseafloo r biosphere are often microbially mediated, which leads to specifi c microbiological research questions. How does the thermal impac t of emplaced sills influence microbial diagenetic reactions, for example by accelerating DIC-producing anaerobic reactions, such as sulfate reduction? Is there a connection between geothermal gradient, acceleration of anaerobic metabolism, and a shallowing of carbonate precipitation? Metabolic acceleration could be a direct therma l response or indirectly triggered when warmer temperatures help t o release LMW compounds from complex, buried organic matter. Interestingly, shipboard cell counts show that microbial cell number s in the sediments are strongly affected by the thermal gradient an d decrease rapidly toward greater depths, presumably due to hea t stress. Nevertheless, cell counts in the upper sediment column remain at least near or above cell counts for (nonhydrothermal) passive continental margins. Thus, the expedition results place th e relatively generic microbial questions that populated the proposa l (thermal and chemical limits of life, limits of specific metaboli c pathways, etc.) into a specific hypothesis-generating context tha t will stimulate and guide multidisciplinary postcruise research.  

The generally high quality and high degree of completeness o f the acquired datasets open up opportunities for interdisciplinar y and multidisciplinary collaborations on studies that will keep producing results and new insights far into the future. For example, i t will be possible for the first time in IODP history to systematicall y explore correlations of cell abundance, community composition, and activity with geothermal gradients within the relevant therma l range (as high as ${\sim}80^{\circ}{-}100^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and over a wide range of lithologi c and geochemical conditions using multiple sites and holes fro m the same region. Another area of highly promising data integration will be the combined lithology and geochemistry of the sediment–sill transition. Multiple examples were recovered durin g Expedition 385, where previously only a single transition (the to p of the major sill in Hole 481 at ${\sim}170~\mathrm{m}$ depth) was available in an y reasonable degree of completeness. The mineralogy, geochemistry, and microbiology of the massive sills themselves are no w within reach for individual studies as well as for collaborative ventures because the shipboard microbiology group readjusted thei r originally sediment-focused sampling program to cover the interior of sills as well. The hydrothermal influence on mineral dissolution,  authigenic  mineral precipitation,  and  minera l transformations can be assessed in multiple sediment column s where suitable thermal gradient information, high sediment recovery, and high-quality analysis of the sediment composition an d mineral phases coincide.  

# Outreach  

IODP Expedition 385 had one Onboard Outreach Officer:  a Mexican science journalist based in Washington, D.C. (USA). Th e officer communicated the scientific objectives of the expeditio n with audiences of all ages from all around the world through liv e video broadcasts, social media posts and videos, a podcast episode, and blog posts.  

Live ship-to-shore video connections to classrooms, museums , and academic institutions were broadcast using tablets with the videoconferencing software Zoom. A total of 36 video sessions wer e conducted reaching an estimated number of 1449 people in seve n countries (USA, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, an d South Korea) on four continents, plus another 6021 virtual viewer s through Facebook and YouTube. Communication took place in fou r different languages (English, Spanish, French, and Japanese). A typical session started with a brief background explanation of the location of Guaymas Basin and rationale for drilling there and the n defined spreading centers and sills and outlined the microbiolog y objectives. A tour of the ship followed and introduced the core receiving platform, core and microscope laboratories, as well a s chemistry and microbiology laboratories. A member of the scienc e party served as a host most of the time, and scientists and laboratory technicians working in the science laboratories participated i n each session, which enabled participants on shore to address questions directly to them. At the end of the expedition, almost half o f the science party (15 scientists) participated by hosting a broadcas t session. Survey responses from participants indicated that the y found the objectives of the expedition to be clearly explained an d that they learned a great deal about science content, process, an d careers. Over half of the respondents also indicated that the broadcasts exceeded their expectations. Ad hoc video broadcasts were accommodated for the Mexican Geophysical Union’s annual meeting, the Universum Science Museum, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and the Kochi Core Center Open Day.  

The Onboard Outreach Officer also created the expedition’ s website (https://joidesresolution.org/expedition/385) and maintained five social media channels over the duration of the expedition:  a  Facebook  page  (https://www.facebook.com/joides - resolution), a Twitter feed (https://twitter.com/TheJR), an Instagram  account  (https://www.instagram.com/joides_resolution) , the Instagram account of the American Geophysical Union (AGU ) (https://www.instagram.com/americangeophysicalunion) o n Thursdays and Fridays of each week on the occasion of its Centennial, and a blog (https://joidesresolution.org/blog). An overvie w of social media activity on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (bot h the JOIDES Resolution and AGU accounts) is provided in Table T2. The Onboard Outreach Officer created more than 85 Faceboo k posts, and the number of Facebook followers increased by $1.6\%$ ove r the 2 months of the expedition, reaching more than 10,000 followers. Also, two Facebook Live video streams were hosted, averagin g 574 viewers per stream. These live video sessions provided the general public with the unique ability to directly engage with the tea m on the ship and receive nearly instant responses to their questions. More than 140 Twitter posts were made, earning almost 3,700 engagements and growing our audience by $6\%$ through $\mathord{\sim}200$ ne w  

Twitter followers. More than 50 Instagram posts were launched o n the JOIDES Resolution account, including more than 150 photo s and videos, garnering 353 new followers—an increase of $22.2\%-$ and reaching almost 2,000 followers. The Onboard Outreach Officer produced and/or wrote more than 36 blog posts on the JOIDE S Resolution website, including frequent blog posts from one of th e Co-Chief Scientists and four guest blogs written by other scienc e party members. These blogs garnered 5,535 views. The expedition’ s website was viewed 3,446 times.  

In addition to the video broadcasts and social media, the Onboard Outreach Officer created his own focused products. Twice  a week, he took over AGU’s Instagram account, sharing three to fou r posts per day about different aspects of Expedition 385. In total, these amounted to more than 53 posts (searchable with #EXP385 ) that earned more than 7,500 engagements. Four social media video s were produced, drawing a lot of attention across all of the JOIDE S Resolution social media accounts and AGU’s Instagram account. H e also wrote six profiles of members of the science party. In addition, four infographics of microbes from Guaymas Basin were produced, assisted by the US Science Support Program shore-based outreac h management. A collaboration with Tumble, a science podcast fo r kids, provided advice, logistics, and recordings to produce an episode about research at sea (https://beta.prx.org/stories/297209) . All these products were shared either on JOIDES Resolution socia l media channels, the blog page, or the website.  

Thanks to a media campaign carried out by the Onboard Outreach Officer prior to the expedition, Expedition 385 had broad media coverage in Mexican newspapers and magazines as well as o n TV and websites. Other media outlets in the USA, Japan, and Turkey covered the expedition during port call, transit, and operations. At the time of the publication of this report, 15 media stories hav e been recorded in total, along with four institutional press releases. Updates can be continuously retrieved from https://joidesresolution.org/expedition/385.  

The Expedition 385 port call was the first on the US mainland i n more than a decade, so the time in port was accompanied by severa l outreach activities taking place both aboard the vessel and on shore. In the afternoon of 16 September, the “Expedition to Guaymas Basin” Science Symposium was held at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (University of California, San Diego; USA) in La Jolla, California, with $\mathord{\sim}160$ people in attendance, including science part y members of the pioneering DSDP Leg 64 that first drilled Guayma s Basin more than $40~\mathrm{y}$ ago. On board, numerous tours of the shi p were given to various audiences, such as US and Mexican studen t groups, Scripps Institution of Oceanography staff, local media, dignitaries from both Texas A&M University and the National Scienc e Foundation, and friends and families of IODP staff. In total, mor e than 180 visitors came to the JOIDES Resolution over 4 days (17–2 0 September 2019).
