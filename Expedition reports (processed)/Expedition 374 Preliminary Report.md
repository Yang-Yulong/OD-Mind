# Abstract  

The marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is currentl y retreating due to shifting wind-driven oceanic currents that transport warm waters toward the ice margin, resulting in ice shelf thinning and accelerated mass loss of the WAIS. Previous results fro m geologic drilling on Antarctica’s continental margins show significant variability in marine-based ice sheet extent during the lat e Neogene and Quaternary. Numerical models indicate a fundamental role for oceanic heat in controlling this variability over at leas t the past $20\;\mathrm{My}$ . Although evidence for past ice sheet variability ha s been collected in marginal settings, sedimentologic sequences fro m the outer continental shelf are required to evaluate the extent o f past ice sheet variability and the associated oceanic forcings an d feedbacks. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 37 4 drilled a latitudinal and depth transect of five drill sites from th e outer continental shelf to rise in the eastern Ross Sea to resolve th e relationship between climatic and oceanic change and WAIS evolution through the Neogene and Quaternary. This location was selected because numerical ice sheet models indicate that this secto r of Antarctica is highly sensitive to changes in ocean heat flux. Th e expedition was designed for optimal data-model integration an d will enable an improved understanding of the sensitivity of Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) mass balance during warmer-than-present climates (e.g., the Pleistocene “super interglacials,” the mid-Pliocene, and the late early to middle Miocene). The principal goals of Expedition 374 were to  

• Evaluate the contribution of West Antarctica to far-field ice volume and sea level estimates;   
• Reconstruct ice-proximal atmospheric and oceanic temperatures to identify past polar amplification and assess its forcings and feedbacks;   
• Assess the role of oceanic forcing (e.g., sea level and temperature) on AIS stability/instability;   
• Identify the sensitivity of the AIS to Earth’s orbital configuration under a variety of climate boundary conditions; and   
• Reconstruct eastern Ross Sea paleobathymetry to examine relationships between seafloor geometry, ice sheet stability/instability, and global climate.  

To achieve these objectives, we will  

• Use data and models to reconcile intervals of maximum Neogene and Quaternary Antarctic ice advance with far-field records of eustatic sea level change;   
• Reconstruct past changes in oceanic and atmospheric temperatures using a multiproxy approach;   
• Reconstruct Neogene and Quaternary sea ice margin fluctuations in datable marine continental slope and rise records and correlate these records to existing inner continental shelf records;   
• Examine relationships among WAIS stability/instability, Earth’s orbital configuration, oceanic temperature and circulation, and atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2};$ and   
• Constrain the timing of Ross Sea continental shelf overdeepening and assess its impact on Neogene and Quaternary ice dynamics.  

Expedition 374 was carried out from January to March 2018, departing from Lyttelton, New Zealand. We recovered $1292.70~\mathrm{m}$ o f high-quality cores from five sites spanning the early Miocene to lat e Quaternary. Three sites were cored on the continental shelf (Site s  

U1521, U1522, and U1523). At Site U1521, we cored a $650~\mathrm{m}$ thic k sequence of interbedded diamictite, mudstone, and diatomite, penetrating the Ross Sea seismic Unconformity RSU4. The depositional reconstructions of past glacial and open-marine conditions at thi s site will provide unprecedented insight into environmental chang e on the Antarctic continental shelf during the early and middle Miocene. At Site U1522, we cored a discontinuous upper Miocene t o Pleistocene sequence of glacial and glaciomarine strata from th e outer shelf, with the primary objective to penetrate and date seismi c Unconformity RSU3, which is interpreted to represent the first major continental shelf–wide expansion and coalescing of marinebased ice streams from both East and West Antarctica. At Sit e U1523, we cored a sediment drift located beneath the westerly flowing Antarctic Slope Current (ASC). Cores from this site will provid e a record of the changing vigor of the ASC through time. Such a reconstruction will enable testing of the hypothesis that changes i n the vigor of the ASC represent a key control on regulating heat flu x onto the continental shelf, resulting in the ASC playing a fundamental role in ice sheet mass balance.  

We also cored two sites on the continental slope and rise. At Sit e U1524, we cored a Plio–Pleistocene sedimentary sequence on th e continental rise on the levee of the Hillary Canyon, which is one o f the largest conduits of Antarctic Bottom Water delivery from th e Antarctic continental shelf into the abyssal ocean. Drilling at Sit e U1524 was intended to penetrate into middle Miocene and olde r strata but was initially interrupted by drifting sea ice that forced u s to abandon coring in Hole U1524A at $399.5~\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth belo w seafloor (DSF). We moved to a nearby alternate site on the continental slope (U1525) to core a single hole with a record complementary to the upper part of the section recovered at Site U1524. W e returned to Site U1524 3 days later, after the sea ice cleared. W e then cored Hole U1524C with the rotary core barrel with the intention of reaching the target depth of $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. However, we wer e forced to terminate Hole U1524C at $441.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF due to a mechanical failure with the vessel that resulted in termination of all drillin g operations and a return to Lyttelton 16 days earlier than scheduled. The loss of $39\%$ of our operational days significantly impacted ou r ability to achieve all Expedition 374 objectives as originally planned. In particular, we were not able to obtain the deeper time record o f the middle Miocene on the continental rise or abyssal sequence s that would have provided a continuous and contemporaneous archive to the high-quality (but discontinuous) record from Sit e U1521 on the continental shelf. The mechanical failure also mean t we could not recover sediment cores from proposed Site RSCR19A, which was targeted to obtain a high-fidelity, continuous recor d of upper Neogene and Quaternary pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation. Despite our failure to recover a shelf-to-rise transect for th e Miocene, a continental shelf-to-rise transect for the Pliocene t o Pleistocene interval is possible through comparison of the highquality records from Site U1522 with those from Site U1525 an d legacy cores from the Antarctic Geological Drilling Project (ANDRILL).  

# Introduction  

Drilling Ross Sea outer continental shelf-to-rise sedimentary sequences recovered a direct record of Neogene to Quaternary Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) evolution to improve understanding o f climate forcings/feedbacks relating to ice sheet variability. In combination with model sensitivity tests, tectonic considerations, an d the well-developed seismic stratigraphic framework of the Ross Sea, the cores will enable researchers to determine if estimates of larg e far-field Neogene sea level variability $(20{-}60\ \mathrm{m})$ (cf. Miller et al., 2005, 2012; Naish and Wilson, 2009) reflect changes in Antarctic ic e volume (Figures F1, F2, F3). The continental shelf-to-rise transec t in an area of demonstrated climate sensitivity (Figure F4) will allo w for improved understanding of ocean–ice sheet interactions on orbital to million year timescales.  

The onset of the Neogene $\mathbf{23\Ma}$ ; Oligocene/Miocene $[\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{M}]$ boundary) is characterized by an abrupt increase in Antarctic ic e volume attributed to changes in Earth’s orbital parameters (Zacho s et al., 1997; Naish et al., 2001) and declining atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Figure F1) (Pagani et al., 2005; Foster and Rohling, 2013). Following  a period of cooler climates in the early Miocene relative to the Oligocene, both near- and far-field proxy records indicate a period of sustained ( ${\sim}3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warmer than present; You et al., 2009) warmth an d carbon cycle reorganization (e.g., Vincent and Berger, 1985; Foste r et al., 2012) referred to as the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimu m (MMCO; ${\sim}17{-}15\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) (Flower and Kennett, 1994; Shevenell et al., 2004), and significant polar amplification of temperature is suggested (Shevenell et al., 2004, 2008; Lewis et al., 2008; Warny et al., 2009; Feakins et al., 2012; Sangiorgi et al., 2018). The MMCO wa s immediately followed by an interval of Antarctic ice growth an d cooling termed the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT; $14.2–13.8\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ), which can be observed in both far-field benthic foraminifer $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records and ice-proximal data (Figure F1B) (Kennett, 1977; Flower and Kennett, 1994; Zachos et al., 2001; Shevenell et al., 2004, 2008; Holbourn et al., 2007; Cramer et al., 2009; John et al., 2011; Sangiorgi et al., 2018). The MMCT may have resulted in th e extinction of the Antarctic tundra vegetation (Lewis et al., 2008). Although ice expansion has traditionally been inferred in East Antarctica, Ross Sea seismic evidence also suggests West Antarctic Ic e Sheet (WAIS) expansion during the MMCT (Bart, 2003). However, the timing of the Ross Sea event, WAIS development, and forcing s and feedbacks involved in the MMCT remain enigmatic, as does th e subsequent climate and ice sheet history of the sparsely sample d late Miocene (De Santis et al., 1995; Zachos et al. 2001). During th e mid-Pliocene, global sea levels were thought to be ${\sim}20\pm10\mathrm{\,m}$ abov e present-day levels, indicating a reduction/collapse of both th e Greenland Ice Sheet and the WAIS (Miller et al., 2012). Ice-proximal sedimentary facies indicate orbitally paced advances and retreats of the WAIS from the early Pliocene (Figures F4) that occu r until at least $1.0\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . However, equivocal evidence exists for WAI S collapse as recently as the last interglacial, and obtaining paleoclimate records of the late Pleistocene in the Ross Sea was a hig h priority for International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 374 (Scherer et al., 1998; Kopp et al., 2009; Naish et al., 2009; McKay et al., 2012b; Dahl-Jensen et al., 2013).  

# Background  

# Oceanographic setting  

Much of the abyssal ocean is presently filled with cold, dens e water produced in the large polynyas of the Weddell and Ross Sea s and mixed with ambient water. Thus, changes in temperatur e and/or meltwater input to the Ross Sea could disrupt global meridional overturning circulation (MOC) (Jacobs et al., 2002; Orsi an d Wiederwohl, 2009; Purkey and Johnson, 2010). Over the past $40\;\mathrm{y},$ Ross Sea–derived Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) has freshene d as a result of increased meltwater input to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas from melting ice shelves/glacial systems (Jacobs e t al., 2002, 2011).  

Unlike the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas, where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) impinges the continental shel f and cross-shelf bathymetry encourages the presence of relativel y warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) on the inner shelf, the eastern limb of the Ross Gyre brings cooler Modified Circumpola r Deep Water (MCDW) to the Ross Sea along the lower continental slope (Whitworth et al., 1995; Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009). Th e strong westward-flowing Antarctic Slope Current (ASC), which ha s a sharp subsurface front (Antarctic Slope Front), separates Antarctic Surface Water (AASW) on the shelf from MCDW on the lowe r continental slope (Figure F5). This front serves as a dynamic barrie r that limits the transfer of CDW and MCDW onto the Ross Sea continental shelf (Ainley and Jacobs, 1981). Thus, ASC vigor and th e formation of fresh AASW regulate the volume of MCDW on th e Ross Sea continental shelf.  

# Geological setting and previous drilling  

The breakup of Gondwana during the Middle Jurassic bega n with the initiation of the West Antarctic Rift, which led to the opening of the Ross Sea (Behrendt et al., 1991) and the development o f three sedimentary basins (Figures F2, F3) (Cooper et al., 1991). Th e westernmost Victoria Land Basin (VLB) was the focus of previou s regional  geological  drilling  (e.g.,  Dry  Valley  Drilling  Projec t [DVDP],  McMurdo  Sound  Sediments  and  Tectonics  Stud y [MSSTS-1], Cenozoic Investigations in the Western Ross Se a [CIROS-1 and CIROS-2], Cape Roberts Project [CRP], and the Antarctic Geological Drilling Project [ANDRILL]). Expedition 374 focused on the Eastern Basin, which encompasses the Gloma r Challenger Basin and contains as much as $6\;\mathrm{km}$ of Cenozoic sediment infill (Figure F3).  

The basement geology of the Ross Sea Central High adjacent t o the Eastern Basin was penetrated at Deep Sea Drilling Projec t (DSDP) Site 270 and consists of high-grade Paleozoic calcareou s metamorphic rocks (Ford and Barrett, 1975) that were mylonitize d during Late Cretaceous uplift (Siddoway et al., 2004). Upper Cretaceous mylonites were also recovered from the western part of th e Eastern Basin (Luyendyk et al., 2001). The lack of basement younge r than Devonian at CRP-3 and Site 270 suggests that younger Permian–Triassic Beacon Supergroup strata are likely absent in the western (and eastern) Ross Sea. This interpretation is supported b y paleogeographic maps from Barrett (1981), which suggest that th e western (and eastern) Ross Sea was likely an area of uplift and erosion through much of the Permian–Triassic, although these map s are poorly constrained. The Devonian (lower part) of the Beaco n Supergroup is dominated by coarse clastics (Barrett, 1981). The tectonic models for the formation of the Ross Sea, through the thinning  of  thickened $({\sim}40\ \ \mathrm{km})$ crust  that  covered  the  entir e Transantarctic Mountain (TAM)–Ross Sea–Marie Byrd Land region (Karner et al., 2005; Decesari et al., 2007), would also tend t o argue against the preservation of younger Beacon strata because uplift and erosion of large amounts of strata would be predicted durin g early rifting, and this rifting would likely include the removal of an y upper Beacon Supergroup strata even if they had been present. Consequently, this rifting would result in a very different provenance signature for glacial deposits transported from the wester n Ross Sea compared with the eastern Ross Sea.  

The Antarctic Offshore Stratigraphy (ANTOSTRAT) seismi c stratigraphic scheme defines eight seismic units (RSS-1 throug h RSS-8) in the sediment infill lying above the basement that ar e bounded by six major shelf-wide unconformities (RSU1 throug h RSU6) (Figures F3, F6; Table T1) (Brancolini et al., 1995; De Santi s et al., 1995), but their ages were only partially constrained by drilling (see synthesis by Bart and De Santis, 2012). In the eastern Ros s Sea, CIROS-1 and CRP-3 indicate marine-terminating glaciation i n the TAM by the earliest Oligocene (Barrett, 1989, 2007). In the central Ross Sea, seismic-based reconstructions suggest ice caps nucleated on the subaerially elevated basement highs in the central Ros s Sea during the Oligocene. The adjacent deep-water basins in th e outer Ross Sea appear to have remained free of grounded ice unti l the late Oligocene, although they were probably influenced by voluminous sediment-laden meltwater discharge under a more temperate style of glacial sedimentation, resulting in progressive shoalin g of the Eastern Basin as accommodation space was filled (Shipboar d Scientific Party, 1975a; De Santis et al., 1995). Expedition 374 seek s to constrain the ages of Unconformities RSU4 through RSU1 to understand how they relate to the evolution of the marine-base d WAIS.  

Strata (Unit RSS-1) underlying seismic Unconformity RSU6 ar e the oldest and deepest basin infill sedimentary packages in the central Ross Sea. Unit RSS-1 is divided into a lower and upper package. The lower part of Unit RSS-1 has not been drilled, whereas the upper part was drilled in the western Ross Sea (CRP and CIROS-1 ) and consists of upper Eocene to Oligocene high-energy fluvial, deltaic, and shallow-shelf rift-fill strata with a glacial influence in it s upper parts (Fielding et al., 2000; Galeotti et al., 2016). The litholog y and age of the lowermost strata under Unconformity RSU6 are uncertain because this interval has not been sampled, but it likely consists of coarse-grained fluvial facies deposited in the initial phases o f Late Cretaceous to Paleocene rifting in the central Ross Sea (Wilso n and Luyendyk, 2009).  

The units overlying Unconformity RSU6 have all been partiall y sampled by drilling, and the stratigraphic architecture in the Ros s Sea is relatively well constrained, although most drill holes are located in isolated basins in the VLB of the western Ross Sea (Figure s F2, F6), and thus basin-to-basin correlations remain uncertain. Direct correlation of Unconformity RSU6 from across the variou s Ross Sea basins is not possible because the unconformity onlaps th e basement flanks (Figures F3, F6). However, an inferred correlatio n can be made based on the distinctive acoustic character of the unconformity, which generally appears as a high-amplitude continuous reflector that is very distinct from the underlying seismic facies.  

Upper Oligocene $\left({\sim}28\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ to lower Miocene $\left({\sim}20\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ strata a t Site 270 consist of a $365~\mathrm{m}$ sequence of lithified glaciomarine mudstones with iceberg-rafted debris (IBRD) and common macro- an d microfossils (Hayes et al., 1975; Leckie and Webb, 1986), suggestin g a shallow continental shelf environment with periods of abundan t terrestrial runoff. Above 100 meters below seafloor (mbsf), many o f the units (originally classified as mudstone) are lower Miocen e diamictites (i.e., $>\!25\%$ sand) that were eroded and transported b y glacial ice (Barrett, 1975).  

Two ANDRILL sites drilled on the inner continental shelf of th e western Ross Sea ( $98\%$ recovery) contain an unprecedented recor d of marine-based ice sheet variability in the Ross Sea (Naish et al., 2009; Fielding et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2012; Patterson and Ishman, 2013; Levy et al., 2016) over the past 20 My, although both of thes e sites are heavily influenced by the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). Drilling at Site AND-2A recovered a ${\sim}20{-}14$ Ma sequence interpreted to reflect TAM tidewater outlet glaciers overriding and/o r calving near the site (Fielding et al., 2011; Passchier et al., 2011; Lev y et al., 2016). A diatomite (dated to $15.7\;\mathrm{Ma})$ with abundant diatoms, dinoflagellate cysts, foraminifers, pollen, and other biomarkers suggests a warmer-than-present ( ${\sim}11^{\circ}C$ mean surface temperature )  

and hydrologically active climate during the MMCO (Warny et al., 2009; Feakins et al., 2012). At 300 mbsf, a $300~\mathrm{ky}$ disconformity i s thought to be equivalent to Unconformity RSU4, suggesting a shelfwide advance of the marine-based ice sheet during the MMCT (Figures F6, F7) (De Santis et al., 1999; Passchier et al., 2011).  

The first unequivocal seismic evidence of a glacially carve d trough in the central Ross Sea (key target of Site U1521) occurs a t Unconformity RSU4 (mid-Miocene) and is interpreted as an expansion of a grounded marine-based ice stream originating from th e EAIS to the west (Figures F7, F8) (De Santis et al., 1995; Ten Brin k et al., 1995; Anderson, 1999). At DSDP Site 272, a ${\sim}400\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thic k middle–upper Miocene sequence of glaciomarine mudstone wa s recovered (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1975b) (Figure F6). Combined with the presence of numerous outwash channels above Unconformity RSU4, as much as $250\textrm{m}$ of till foreset and aggradin g bottomset strata suggest that glaciomarine sedimentation was dominated by the release of abundant erosive sediment-laden meltwate r during the middle Miocene ${\sim}14\mathrm{\Ma}$ ; Figure F8) (Anderson an d Bartek, 1992; Chow and Bart, 2003). This meltwater release wa s likely associated with extensive channel-levee systems above Unconformity RSU4 on the continental slope and rise (De Santis et al., 1995, 1999).  

The Miocene cooling that followed the MMCO caused multipl e erosional episodes of the shallow central Ross Sea, so the uppe r Miocene to Pliocene record is poorly preserved. Till foreset strat a that thicken toward the Central High within a thick tilted sectio n that dips gently seaward were drilled at Site 272, suggesting tha t middle Miocene glaciation records may be preserved on the easter n Ross Sea sector (cf. Figures F7, F8). Evidence for glacial erosion an d deposition in the southeasternmost sector of the Ross Sea is derive d from an ice cap already located on Marie Byrd Land in the Oligocene (Sorlien et al., 2007). However, in the mid- to late Miocene, th e eastern Ross Sea was still a wide embayment gently sloping seawar d surrounded by grounded ice on the shallow shelf that was deliverin g sediments to the slope from the Central High and from Marie Byr d Land.  

Unconformity RSU3 (key target of Site U1522) provides the firs t evidence for a major cross-shelf paleotrough eroded by an expanded WAIS, although the age of this event(s) was poorly constrained $_{\sqrt{\sim4-14\mathrm{~Ma}_{\cdot}}}$ ; Figures F6, F7) (De Santis et al., 1995, 1999; Bart, 2003). Large meltwater and outwash features are absent, an d laminated seismic facies are progressively thinner/less common i n strata younger than Unconformity RSU3, suggesting sediment starvation and a transition to a colder glacial regime. Site AND-1B sediments indicate that this transition may not have occurred until th e Pliocene (McKay et al., 2009), although evidence for meltwater outburst features is lacking in the TAM after 12.4 Ma (Lewis et al., 2006). High-velocity seismic units above Unconformities RSU3 an d RSU2 suggest overcompaction by ice loading during WAIS expansion (Böhm et al., 2009). Bathymetric reconstructions sugges t overdeepening with a transition to a landward-deepening continental shelf occurred by the Unconformity RSU2 event during the earl y Pliocene to early Pleistocene(?) (Figure F7) (De Santis et al., 1995, 1999). A trough-mouth fan on the upper slope and a sedimentstarved continental rise (typical of the Plio–Pleistocene Antarcti c margin) coincided with overdeepening (Bart et al., 1999; Coope r and O’Brien, 2004; Rebesco et al., 2006; Bart and Iwai, 2012).  

At Site AND-1B, ${\sim}58$ sedimentary cycles of ice sheet advanc e and retreat can be observed in the Ross Embayment over the past 1 3 My (McKay et al., 2009). Diatomites indicate frequent collapses o f the WAIS in the Pliocene $(2.6{-}5.3\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ), during which diatom assemblages and geochemical paleothermometry indicate ocean temperatures up to $4^{\circ}C$ warmer than present (McKay et al., 2012a; Naish e t al., 2009). However, sedimentary lithofacies indicate that meltwate r discharge was reduced during Pliocene interglacials compared wit h the late Miocene (5.3–11 Ma). By the mid-Pleistocene $\left(1.0\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ , th e Ross Ice Shelf persisted through most interglacials (McKay et al., 2009).  

Seismic facies above Unconformity RSU2 are indicative of til l sheets bound by erosional unconformities in an aggrading shel f margin caused by shelf-wide advances of the WAIS (Figure F7 ) (Alonso et al., 1992; Bart et al., 2011; Brancolini et al., 1995). Unlik e other sectors of the Antarctic, the eastern Ross Sea trough mout h contains thick $\left(\sim\!2000\textrm{m}\right)$ sedimentary sequences on the shelf an d upper continental slope that may contain a detailed WAIS history. Above Unconformity RSU1 $(0.7?\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , shelf-edge sediments are aggrading or backstepping (rather than prograding), indicating tha t most sediment delivered from land was sequestered on the oute r shelf or bypassed the continental shelf to pass directly into the dee p sea.  

# Site survey data  

Multichannel seismic (MCS) and single-channel seismic (SCS ) profiles have been collected in the Ross Sea by several nations sinc e 1980. MCS data are available through the Antarctic Seismic Dat a Library System, which works under the auspices of the Scientifi c Committee on Antarctic Research and the Antarctic Treaty (ATC M XVI-12). Prestack data are available only from the Italian cruise s (1988, 1989, 1991, 1994, and 2006) and recently also from th e BGR80 cruise.  

We selected sites based on maximum thickness of target sequence, better potential for dating sediments, and acoustic facie s and geometry, which usually can be seen much better on high-resolution profiles. In most cases, high-resolution profiles are singl e channel or, in the case of the TAN060_08 profile, they have a ver y short streamer $\left(200\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ compared with the water depth $\left(>\!1000\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ . In some cases, crossing lines are not available, and the remotenes s of Antarctic water and presence of sea ice prevent the easy collection of new site survey data. New MCS Profiles KSL14-02 an d KSL14-04 (Kim et al., 2018) were collected in February 2013 and i n 2015 by the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI) with the aim o f providing cross-lines for several proposed sites. Another SCS survey  cruise  was  conducted  in  2017  (EU/FP7  EUROFLEETS 2 ANTSSS project and Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide WHISPERS and ODYSSEA projects) with the aim to collect additional cross-lines of the proposed sites and identify alternate sites.  

SCS data, collected by National Science Foundation (NSF ) Cruises 1990 and 1994–1995, were made available by John Anderson (Rice University, Texas) in the format of digital SEGY dat a (Cruise PD90) and paper copies (Cruise NBP 94-95). We made th e conversion of the TIFF or JPG image to SEGY format to depth-convert the sections and load the data in the IHS Kingdom interpretation software with the other available data sets. The supporting sit e survey data for Expedition 374 are archived at the IODP Site Surve y Data Bank (https://ssdb.iodp.org/SSDBquery/SSDBquery.php; select P751 for proposal number).  

# Scientific objectives  

1. Evaluate the contribution of West Antarctica to far-field ice volume and sea level estimates.  

Far-field benthic foraminifer $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and sequence stratigraphi c records suggest that large global ice volume and sea level $(20{-}60\ \mathrm{m})$ variations occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene (Figures F1, F6) (Zachos et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2005, 2012; Cramer et al., 2009; Raymo et al., 2011). Miocene–Pliocene sea level reconstruction s could potentially be reconciled without invoking Northern Hemisphere contributions if Antarctica’s ice sheets expanded to the continental shelf edge ${\sim}14\mathrm{~m~}$ sea level equivalent [SLE]) (Figure F4) . The modeled difference between the glacial maxima states and los s of the marine-based WAIS (assuming present bathymetry) represents ${\sim}21\mathrm{~m~}$ SLE (with some minor loss of the EAIS), althoug h changes in Ross Sea bathymetry could increase this value (Figur e F4) (see Objective 5). Expedition 374 records will help constrain th e timing of the first WAIS advances to the shelf edge, and integratio n with ANDRILL records will allow assessment of the WAIS contribution to Neogene sea level estimates.  

Sedimentologic and micropaleontologic analyses at the continental shelf Sites U1521 and U1522, combined with seismic stratigraphic correlations, will identify deposition under grounded-ice, glaciomarine,  and  open-marine  conditions  following  ANDRILL/CRP methodology (Fielding et al., 2000, 2011; McKay et al., 2009; Passchier et al., 2011; Powell and Cooper, 2002). Magneto-, bio-, and tephrochronology will enable identification of orbitalscale ice sheet variations and have been employed in discontinuou s Antarctic margin sequences (Florindo et al., 2003, 2005; Tauxe et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2012) (Figure F4). Furthermore, new quantitative techniques have greatly enhanced the biostratigraphic framework of the Southern Ocean (Cody et al., 2008, 2012; Crampton e t al., 2016). Glacially reworked volcanic clasts (Wilson et al., 2012 ) and radiometrically datable felsic ashes from Marie Byrd Land ma y be used to provide maximum ages (Wilch et al., 1999). Climat e snapshots near magnetic reversals will be targeted (e.g., the M2 glacial in Figure F4) because these events can be traced to more continuous records from the continental rise (Site U1524) and global sea level records. Sediment provenance studies (clast/sand petrology, mineral thermochronology, and radiogenic isotope analysis) a t Sites U1521 and U1522 will enable understanding of the changes i n the origin of sediments (e.g., local ice caps versus ice sheet expansion and provenance from East versus West Antarctic sources) (Figure F7) (Licht et al., 2005, 2014; Talarico et al., 2012; Cook et al., 2013). As with all objectives, data integration with modeling studie s will be undertaken (cf. Figure F4) (Golledge et al., 2012; Wilson e t al., 2013; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Gasson et al., 2016).  

2. Reconstruct ice-proximal atmospheric and oceanic temperatures to identify past polar amplification and assess its forcings/feedbacks.  

Obtaining atmospheric and ocean temperatures from the Expedition 374 drill sites will enable the paleoclimate community to address the following key scientific questions:  

• Were polar temperatures sensitive to the low-amplitude variations in Neogene atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}{}^{\cdot}$ ?   
• Were Neogene ocean and atmospheric temperatures at the Antarctic margin amplified relative to the global mean, and if so, what were the forcings?   
• How did ocean temperatures evolve as Antarctica’s ice sheets expanded and contracted during major Neogene climate transitions and on orbital timescales?  

Although the ANDRILL records provide important archives o f high-latitude oceanic conditions, they only provide snapshots o f temperature and sea ice conditions through interglacials, whe n these sites were not covered by ice (Warny et al., 2009; McKay et al., $2012\mathbf{a}$ ; Levy et al., 2016). In contrast, Sites U1521 and U1522 provide intervals of more continuous sedimentation (albeit with som e periods of erosion during large glaciations) because they are in paleobathymetric  depressions that  provided the  accommodatio n space needed for preservation after ice expansion (De Santis et al., 1995). These sites are also farther out on the continental shelf, nea r the paleoshelf break (Figure F7), and are therefore less likely to b e frequently overridden by grounded ice (Pollard and DeConto, 2009; Bart et al., 2011). Near-continuous records of oceanographic chang e were recovered at Sites U1523–U1525, providing high-latitude information on Neogene and Quaternary ocean and atmospheri c temperatures, meltwater input, and bottom water production.  

Lithofacies analysis will be used to reconstruct glacial therma l regimes and glacial cyclicity (cf. Naish et al., 2009; McKay et al., 2009), whereas diatom and radiolarian census counts, marine an d terrestrial palynology, organic biomarkers (e.g., $\mathrm{TEX}_{86},$ branche d and isoprenoid tetraether [BIT] index, and methylation of branche d tetraether [MBT]/cyclization of branched tetraether [CBT] proxy; cf. McKay et al., $2012{\bf a}$ ; Levy et al., 2016; Sangiorgi et al., 2018), an d redox-sensitive metals (e.g., Mn, U, Re, and Mo) provide records fo r paleoproductivity, high-latitude marine and terrestrial climate, an d oceanography. Lithofacies analysis is also relevant to monitoring alteration of the biomarkers by methanogenesis and shifting redo x boundaries. Biogenic carbonate (e.g., calcareous nannofossils/foraminifers) is also present in Expedition 374 Neogene and uppe r Pleistocene interglacial sequences, as well as at other circum-Antarctic sites (e.g., Theissen et al., 2003; Scherer et al., 2008; Villa et al., 2008; Expedition 318 Scientists, 2011). In the lower to middle Miocene, biogenic carbonate is more common in the Southern Ocea n and Antarctic margins (Hayes et al., 1975; Kennett and Barker, 1990; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001; Shevenell et al., 2004; Expeditio n 318 Scientists, 2011; Fielding et al., 2011), making stable isotop e $\mathrm{\Delta\left[\delta^{18}O\right.}$ and $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\prime}$ , trace element (e.g., Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, U/Ca, Ba/Ca, and $\mathbf{B}/\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a},$ , and clumped isotope analyses possible. However, for al l of  the  proxies  discussed  above,  careful  consideration  o f strengths/weaknesses in a marginal marine setting should be made.  

3. Assess the role of oceanic forcing (e.g., sea level and temperature) on WAIS stability/instability.  

WAIS collapse events during past warmer-than-present climates may be the consequence of intensified ocean-cryosphere interactions  (Naish  et  al.,  2009;  Pollard  and  DeConto,  2009). Interactions between the wind-driven upwelling of warm CDW an d the ice shelves that buttress the WAIS appear to play a significan t role in modern ice mass loss in West Antarctica (Mercer, 1978; Joughin et al., 2012; Pritchard et al., 2012; Shepherd et al., 2012). Observations and numerical ice sheet models suggest that change s in ocean heat flux are a key factor influencing the stability/instability of the WAIS (Golledge et al., 2012; Pritchard et al., 2012; DeConto and Pollard, 2016). We postulate that changes in either th e formation of AASW and AABW or the vigor of the wind-drive n ASC control incursions of CDW onto the Ross Sea continental slope and shelf and the resultant retreat of the WAIS (Figure F5) . The records from Expedition 374 will allow us to test this hypothesis by assessing changes in these two variables (from grain size an d lithofacies analysis of sediment mounds on the continental shel f bank, slope, and rise; e.g., Sites U1523–U1525) and ice sheet exten t in the Ross Embayment (Sites U1521, U1522, DSDP Site 272, an d ANDRILL).  

The Ross Sea is also one of the three main sources of AAB W that feeds the abyssal ocean (to become Southern Component Water [SCW]). In the middle Miocene, benthic foraminifer $\delta^{13}C$ indicates  changes  in  the  relative  input  of  SCW  and  Norther n Component Water (NCW) into the global ocean (Woodruff an d Savin, 1985; Wright et al., 1991; Shevenell et al., 2004; Cramer et al., 2009). Newer proxies, such as Nd isotopes, are now used to furthe r refine the geographic source (e.g., van de Flierdt et al., $2004;$ ; Sche r and Martin, 2006; Newkirk and Martin, 2009; see also Huck et al., 2017). Thus, the records obtained during Expedition 374 and comparison with far-field records will provide insight into temporal changes in SCW production through the Neogene (Vincent an d Berger, 1985; Flower and Kennett, 1994; Hodell and Venz-Curtis, 2006).  

Paleocurrent strength associated with past ASC changes and th e history of AABW formation through the Hillary Canyon will be reconstructed by examining the sedimentologic (e.g., lithofacies analysis and grain size) and magnetic characteristics of Sites U1523– U1525 (e.g., Bianchi et al., 1999; Hall et al., 2001; Prins et al., 2002; Joseph et al., 2004). Micropaleontological, geochemical, and sedimentologic records from drill cores from all Expedition 374 site s will provide reconstructions of changing regional surface and seafloor conditions (e.g., sea ice, surface stratification, sea-surface temperatures [SSTs], polynya mixing, glacial meltwater discharge, nutrient uptake, and supercooling of dense waters by ice shelves ) proximal to the AISs (e.g., Shevenell et al., 2011; McKay et al., $2012\mathbf{a}_{!}$ ; Houben et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2016; Sangiorgi et al., 2018) and thu s AASW (and SCW) formation. Additionally, downslope currents resulting from the transfer of High-Salinity Shelf Water into the abyssal ocean can also be assessed (and distinguished from ASC flow) b y integrated lithofacies analysis, geochemistry, micropaleontology, and seismic profiles (e.g., Hepp et al., 2006; Lucchi and Rebesco, 2007; Caburlotto et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2018) at Sites U1523– U1525.  Carbonate-based  paleotemperature  and  carbonate  io n proxies (e.g., foraminiferal Mg/Ca, Li/Ca, U/Ca, and clumped isotopes) will also be applied where appropriate species are preserve d (see Objective 2).  

# 4. Identify the sensitivity of WAIS to Earth’s orbital configuration under a variety of climate boundary conditions.  

Fundamental questions remain about the orbital pacing of AI S development and variability. The Ross Sea Expedition 374 sequences will shed light on the absence of the $20\,\mathrm{ky}$ precession cycl e in benthic $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records (Figure F4) (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005; Huybers, 2006; Raymo et al., 2006) and the origin of transient shifts i n the sensitivity of Earth’s climate system to orbital forcing (e.g., $40-$ $100\,\mathrm{ky}$ dominated frequencies) in the middle Miocene (Shevenell e t al., 2004) and Plio–Pleistocene (Tzedakis et al., 2017).  

A recent hypothesis suggests that the last such shift in Earth history (the mid-Pleistocene transition) was initiated by an abrupt increase  in Antarctic ice volume (Elderfield et al., 2012). Thi s hypothesis may be tested by identifying and dating groundin g events on the outer Ross Sea continental shelf. If the dominant frequency of AIS advance and retreat shifted from 40 to $100\ \mathrm{ky}$ a t $0.8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , records from this sensitive region will likely record thi s transition.  

Recent evidence from ice-proximal drill sites indicates that Antarctic ice sheets did advance and retreat with 40 and $100\,\mathrm{ky}$ cyclicit y in the Neogene (Grützner et al., 2003; Williams and Handwerger, 2005; Naish et al., 2009; Patterson et al., 2014). We envision a mor e complete picture of the forcings and feedbacks involved with ice advance and retreat from our outer shelf to slope/rise transect. Sedimentologic analyses (complemented by downhole logs) will enabl e development of an orbital-scale continental shelf-to-rise sequenc e stratigraphy of glacial advance and retreat (all Expedition 374 sites; see Objective 1). Additional micropaleontologic data, inorganic an d organic geochemistry (e.g., $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}_{:}$ , $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ , $\delta^{30}\mathrm{Si}$ , $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ , and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Nd}})$ ), mino r and trace elements (X-ray fluorescence and discrete samples), an d organic biomarkers may be used to assess associated frequencies o f change in the continental slope and rise sites (U1523–U1525).  

5. Reconstruct eastern Ross Sea bathymetry to examine relationships between seafloor geometry, ice sheet stability/instability, and global climate.  

The transition from a terrestrial (or shallow marine) West Antarctica with a seaward-dipping shallow continental shelf to that o f the modern overdeepened (i.e., landward dipping) continental shel f would have a first order control on AIS volume and mass balanc e (Wilson et al., 2013; Gasson et al., 2016). The cooling threshold fo r the development of a terrestrial-based ice sheet is lower than that o f a marine-based ice sheet, which is highly sensitive to changes i n oceanic heat flux (Figure F4) (Pollard and DeConto, 2009; Golledg e et al., 2012). A terrestrial (or shallow marine) West Antarctica ma y have supported a larger ice sheet in warmer-than-present climates, whereas overdeepening of the continental shelves may have resulte d in a smaller ice sheet with less frequent ice sheet advances, as hypothesized for the Antarctic Peninsula (e.g., Bart and Iwai, 2012). Ice sheet models indicate that a largely terrestrial West Antarctic a could accommodate an extra ${\sim}13$ million ${\mathbf{k}}{\mathbf{m}}^{3}$ of grounded ice in th e warmer-than-present climate of the Eocene $\cdot^{\mathord{\sim}30}\,\mathrm{m}$ SLE; Figure F4 ) (Wilson  et  al.,  2013).  Therefore,  constraining  the  timing  o f overdeepening in the Ross Sea is critical to reconcile far-field records of eustatic sea level variance into the late Neogene and Quaternary (see Objective 1).  

The timing of Ross Sea shelf overdeepening is currently unconstrained. However, the Ross Sea has the most developed seismi c framework in Antarctica and the highest resolution history of WAI S variability currently available (ANDRILL), making this locatio n ideal for achieving this objective. Dating and providing informatio n about the depositional environment at the time of formation of Unconformities RSU3 and RSU2 (Figure F6) at Sites U1521 and U152 2 in the eastern Ross Sea (by methodologies in Objective 1) will constrain the timing of this overdeepening (Figure F7).  

# Site summaries  

Site U1521  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1521 (proposed Site EBOCS-01D) is located in the Pennel l Basin at $75^{\circ}41.0351^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}40.3108^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $562\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figur e F9). The site is on the mid- to outer continental shelf near a northeast–southwest-oriented Miocene paleotrough identified by mapping regional unconformities in seismic profiles. The primar y objective at Site U1521 was to sample and date strata above and below the Ross Sea Unconformity RSU4, which was previously identified  in  seismic  stratigraphic  studies  (Hinz  and  Block,  1984; Anderson and Bartek, 1992; Cooper et al., 1997) (Figure F10). Unconformity RSU4 has been mapped over most of the Ross Sea and i s interpreted to represent a cross-shelf expansion of the EAIS in th e central regions of the Ross Sea (Brancolini et al., 1995; De Santis e t al., 1995). Strata above Unconformity RSU4 are interpreted to be  a MMCO record $({\sim}17{-}15\,\mathrm{Ma})$ deposited on the Ross Sea continental shelf. Coring through Unconformity RSU4 should improve on th e broad age constraints provided for Unconformity RSU4 by DSD P Sites 272 and 273 (Bart, 2003).  

Records from this site will directly address all five primary Expedition 374 objectives. The record of ice advance and retreat fro m Site U1521, when integrated with seismic stratigraphy, provenanc e studies, and numerical modeling, will allow for a fuller assessmen t of Antarctic contributions to numerous inferred $\sim\!30\:\mathrm{m}$ amplitude ) variations in far-field Miocene sea level (Objective 1) (Miller et al., 2005; John et al., 2011). The magnitude of polar amplificatio n during the MMCO will be assessed through proxies for atmospheri c and marine temperatures derived from both the in situ marine organic matter and terrestrial organic matter transported off shore b y meltwater (e.g., micropaleontology and lipid biomarkers) (Objectiv e 2). Insights into the oceanic drivers for retreat of middle Miocen e marine-terminating ice sheets and subsequent readvances in th e late Miocene can be achieved by detailed lithofacies analysis to reconstruct physical changes in the paleoenvironment. This information can be paired with paleontological and geochemical proxies t o identify the magnitude of the oceanic change through these intervals, and to understand the effect of ocean heat flux on ice sheet stability/instability (Objective 3). Similarly, these methods will identif y the sensitivity of middle Miocene ice sheets to orbital variabilit y based on the presence of cyclicity in the open-marine, glaciomarine, and glacial proximal sediments when combined with downhole logging results to complete the stratigraphy (Objective 4). Finally,  a “backstripped” paleobathymetry through accurate dating and dept h estimates of the Unconformity RSU4 surface and other unconformities at Site U1521, in combination with previous drilling constraints from other locations in the Ross Sea, will allow for a fulle r assessment of bathymetric controls on AIS evolution.  

# Operations  

After a $2014\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Lyttelton, the vessel arrived at Sit e U1521 at $0954\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{[UTC+13\,h)}$ on 16 January 2018. The original operations plan for Site U1521 called for a single rotary core barrel (RCB) hole to $950\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) and downhole logging with the triple combination (triple combo), Formatio n MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic, and Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) tool strings. We ultimately cored Hole U1521A to $650.1\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF (Core s 374-U1521A-1R through 71R) (Table T2). Coring proceeded without incident to Core 37R $0{-}352.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF); however, after poor recovery in Cores 32R through 37R $(14.49\,\mathrm{m};25\%)$ ) caused by jammin g of the core barrel with clasts, we switched to cutting half-lengt h cores to improve core recovery. Cores 38R through 43R $(352.5-$ $381.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF) were collected using a $4.8~\mathrm{m}$ advance (instead of 9. 6 m), significantly improving recovery $(80\%)$ . We switched back to 9. 6 m advances after the formation became less indurated and continued to core with the RCB system from Core 44R through 71 R $381.3{-}650.1\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF). We terminated coring at that depth afte r meeting the primary scientific objectives. At the end of coring operations, we displaced the hole with heavy $(10.5\ \mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal})$ mud an d logged with all three tool strings, all of which reached to within ${\sim}1$ m of the bottom of the hole. Operations at Site U1521 concluded a t $2245\ \mathrm{h}$ on 21 January. A total of $132.75\,\mathrm{{h}}$ (5.5 days) were spent a t Site U1521. RCB coring in Hole U1521A penetrated to $650.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, recovering $411.50\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(63\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

The $648~\mathrm{m}$ succession of lower Miocene to recent sediment recovered at Site U1521 is divided into seven lithostratigraphic unit s (I–VII). Unit VI is further divided into Subunits VIA–VIC (Figur e F11). Contacts between lithostratigraphic units at Site U1521 rang e from sharp to gradational. Diatomite, mudstone, and diamictite account for ${\sim}90\%$ of the core recovered, whereas minor lithofacies include chert and conglomerate (Figure F11). The assemblage o f facies reflects open-marine to subglacial depositional environment s at this location in the central Ross Sea basin since at least the earl y Miocene.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I ( $\mathrm{2-7.4~m}$ core depth below seafloor, Method A [CSF-A]) consists of a sequence of unconsolidated oliv e to light olive gray diatom ooze, dark grayish brown diatom-ric h mud with dispersed clasts, and gray sandy mud. Unit II is ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and consists of dark gray massive clast-poor muddy diamictit e interbedded  with  heavily  bioturbated  diatomite  and  diatomrich/bearing mudstone with dispersed clasts. There are several intervals of physically intermixed diatomite/mudstone and diamictit e with microfaulting and soft-sediment deformation features. Unit II I ${\sim}124\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) consists of bioturbated olive gray to greenish gra y diatomite and diatom-rich/bearing mudstone. Some intervals ar e faintly laminated, and whole bivalve shells and shell fragments ar e present throughout. Unit IV consists of ${\sim}70\;\mathrm{m}$ of dark gray massiv e diatom-bearing clast-rich sandy diamictite with clasts of basalt an d granodiorite. Mudstone and diamictite are interbedded at the to p and bottom of the unit, and a conglomerate composed of elongate d mudstone intraclasts is observed at the base of the unit. Unit $\mathrm{V}$ is  a $40\textrm{m}$ interval of poorly recovered chert nodules interbedded wit h silica cemented mudstone. Unit VI ${\sim}245\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) is characterize d by interbedded mudstone and diamictite that is divided into thre e subunits based on the style of interbedding. Subunit VIA $\langle\sim\!56\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) consists of interbedded dark gray massive diamictite with silica-cemented intervals and mudstone, whereas Subunit VIB $\zeta_{\sim60\mathrm{\,m}}$ thick) consists of massive to stratified dark gray sandy diamictit e with three intervals of clast-supported conglomerate. Subunit VI C $\sim\!128\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) is a sequence of interbedded mudstone with dispersed clasts and sandy diamictite with carbonate concretions an d shell fragments. Unit VII consists of ${\sim}70\mathrm{~m~}$ of interbedded massiv e to stratified sandy diamictite.  

Micropaleontological investigation at Site U1521 included examination of core catcher samples and additional samples from spli t core sections for diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifers, calcareou s nannofossils, and palynomorphs (including dinoflagellate cysts, pollen, and spores) to obtain biostratigraphic ages and preliminar y paleoenvironmental information. The presence and abundances o f the microfossil groups vary significantly throughout the recovere d sediment column (Figure F11). Rich assemblages of diatoms, silicoflagellates, and ebridians are present in the upper ${\sim}280\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Below that depth, diatoms are altered to opal-CT or are poorly preserved and offer minimal biostratigraphic constraint. Radiolarian s are rare in the upper ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and their abundance decrease s significantly downhole. Foraminifers and palynomorphs are generally sparse throughout the hole, and calcareous nannofossils ar e only present in trace numbers deeper than ${\sim}525\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. All microfossil group assemblages represent a combination of in sit u and reworked taxa of different ages.  

Although all investigated microfossil groups provide valuabl e age and/or paleoenvironmental information, diatoms provide th e best age constraint, particularly in the upper ${\sim}280\mathrm{\m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ (Figur e F11). Shallower than $75\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , age assignment is difficult due t o reworking; however, diatom and radiolarian assemblages suggest  a Pliocene to Pleistocene/recent age for the uppermost $25~\mathrm{m}$ . An unconformity at ${\sim}25\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A separates Pliocene sediment from middle Miocene sediment. Age diagnostic diatoms are present betwee n $\mathord{\sim}75$ and $280~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and allow assignment of that interval to th e Actinocyclus ingens and Denticulopsis maccollumii Zones (middl e to early Miocene). Dinoflagellate cysts and other aquatic palynomorphs confirm this age. Between $\mathord{\sim}280$ and $380\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, siliceou s microfossils are altered to opal-CT. From $\sim\!380$ to $580\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , diatoms are present but preservation is poor, with valves occurring a s silicified casts. Despite this lithology, the presence of Thalassiosira sp. cf. Thalassiosira bukryi and absence of Thalassiosira praefraga indicate an early Miocene age. Dinocysts are present over this interval, but the assemblage contains a mix of in situ and reworked taxa. Siliceous microfossils are absent deeper than $580\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, wherea s dinocysts and calcareous nannofossils are present and could indicate an early Miocene age if not reworked.  

Foraminifers are generally sparse, and the assemblages are dominated by calcareous benthic species. The foraminifer assemblage s represent distinct biofacies that vary in parallel with the lithofacie s recovered at Site U1521. Well-preserved diatoms and dinocysts indicate a highly productive and seasonally stratified water colum n between $\mathord{\sim}75$ and $280\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ (early to early middle Miocene). All microfossils will greatly contribute to constraining paleoceanographic and paleoproductivity changes that occurred through th e early to middle Miocene in the Ross Sea.  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1521 focused on measurements of archive-half core sections and oriented discrete (cube ) samples. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) measurements o f archive-half core sections were conducted before and after progressive alternating field (AF) demagnetization, commonly in $5~\mathrm{mT}$ increments  up  to $20\ \mathrm{~mT~}$ peak  AF.  After $20\ \mathrm{~mT~}$ peak  A F demagnetization, NRM intensities usually range between $\mathrm{\sim}10^{-4}$ an d $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ and vary with lithology. Selected discrete samples wer e also used for initial NRM measurement, followed by NRM measurements after progressive AF demagnetization in $2{-}5~\mathrm{mT}$ increments up to a peak AF of $80\,\mathrm{\mT}$ . Principal component analysi s (PCA) of these measurements reveals a stable characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) component in most of the samples, yielding normal and reversed polarities based on inclination data. Steep upward or downward inclinations are also present in most intervals of archive-half core data and agree with directions from discrete samples, suggesting a stable and reliable magnetic carrier tha t can be used for magnetostratigraphic interpretation. The identifie d normal and reversed polarity zones can be correlated to the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) with the aid of biostratigraphi c datums.  

Discrete samples were also used to measure the anisotropy o f magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and mean bulk magnetic susceptibility. The AMS agrees well with variability in the lithostratigraphi c units. For instance, AMS shows an oblate fabric that reflects sedimentary compaction in the diatom-rich to diatom-bearing mudstone of lithostratigraphic Unit III.  

Physical property measurements were conducted on wholeround cores, split core sections, and discrete samples. In general, the whole-round core gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk densit y and magnetic susceptibility measurements show trends similar t o those from discrete moisture and density (MAD) samples and poin t measurements of magnetic susceptibility on the section halves (Figure F11). A downhole increase in $P$ -wave caliper (PWC) values generally coincides with an increase in bulk density and a decrease i n porosity. Downhole variations in natural gamma radiation (NGR ) also correlate well to changes in bulk density. Downhole changes i n physical property characteristics are in good overall agreement wit h the lithostratigraphic units, which are defined based on sedimentologic  characteristics.  In  general,  diatom  ooze,  diatom-ric h mud/mudstone, and mudstone lithofacies (lithostratigraphic Unit s I, III, and V) correspond with low magnetic susceptibility, NGR, thermal conductivity $({<}1\;\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{[m{\cdot}K]})$ , and bulk density and high porosity. The lowest grain density and highest porosity correspon d with diatom-rich/bearing mudstone that is the dominant facies i n lithostratigraphic Unit III (Figure F11). In contrast, intervals tha t are predominantly diamictite (Units II, IV, VI, and VII) are characterized by increased NGR; high bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, an d thermal conductivity; moderate to high magnetic susceptibility; an d low to moderate porosity. Variations in magnetic susceptibility fo r clast-poor diamictite (low to moderate) and clast-rich diamictit e (variable and generally high) suggest that magnetic susceptibility i s an indicator of the abundance of glacially transported clasts o r coarse sand in the sediment (Figure F11).  

Headspace gas analyses show low methane and ethane concentrations in the upper $40\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, increasing downhole to 67,00 0 ppmv for methane and 264 ppmv for ethane. Interstitial water analyses on 15 samples from the uppermost $360\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ show a typica l diagenetic profile with sulfate reduction and increasing ammoniu m concentration in the uppermost $75\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Alkalinity follows  a similar profile to ammonium, whereas iron and manganese concentrations in the interstitial water were below detection limit. A rang e of major and trace elements have smooth downhole profiles wit h changes that are generally well correlated with lithostratigraphi c units. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ content in Site U1521 sediments are generally lo w $(<\!1.2,\,0.1$ , and $<\!6\ \mathrm{wt\%},$ respectively) (Figure F11). TOC content i s slightly higher in the mudstone facies in the upper $300\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF- A and decreases in the diamictite between ${\sim}330$ and $640\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . TOC/TN ratios suggest mixed input of terrestrial- and marine-derived organic matter with no clear downhole trend. Elevated $C a C O_{3}$ content was only observed in the sandy diamictites of lithostratigraphic Unit IV, Subunit VIA, and Unit VII, which also have highe r magnetic susceptibility. Elemental ratios obtained by portabl e handheld X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) scans show good agreemen t with major lithostratigraphic units but also suggest some deviation s between chemical and lithologic boundaries.  

Downhole logging in Hole U1521A consisted of three separat e tool runs (triple combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI), all of which reache d the bottom of the hole and proceeded without issue due to favorabl e borehole conditions. The triple combo measured NGR, density, porosity, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and borehole diameter. The caliper data show that the borehole was in excellent condition, with only one washed out interval between 221 and $226~\mathrm{m}$ wirelin e matched depth below seafloor (WMSF). The NGR, bulk density, and porosity data match well with data from core measurements, whereas magnetic susceptibility data do not correlate as well, possibly as a result of temperature drift or other issues with the magneti c susceptibility sonde (MSS). The second logging run consisted of th e FMS-sonic tool string to measure resistivity borehole images an d acoustic velocity. The latter shows good correlation with the dat a measured with the PWC, especially shallower than ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . The FMS images are extremely well resolved and clearly show clast s in the diamictite intervals, as well as a poorly recovered layered interval of chert and mudstone in lithostratigraphic Unit V. The thir d logging run was with the VSI tool string (geophone) to conduct  a vertical seismic profile (VSP) experiment. Raw check shot data wer e used in preliminary velocity models for an initial seismic-core-lo g correlation.  

# Site U1522  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1522 (proposed Site EBOCS-03C) is located in the Glomar Challenger Basin at $76^{\circ}33.2262^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $174^{\circ}45.4652^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $558\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F12). During the middle Miocene, this site wa s located near the western edge of a wide embayment ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{km}$ southeast of the shelf break. Coring at this site was anticipated to recove r a sedimentary sequence that spans the middle Miocene to the Pleistocene (coinciding with seismic Unconformities RSU3–RSU1). Coring targeted laminated and massive acoustic facies interpreted to b e interlayered stratified diamictite/mudstone and diatomite (glaciomarine/open marine) and massive diamictite (till), respectively (Figure F13).  

The upper ${\sim}400\mathrm{~m~}$ (1.2 s two-way traveltime [TWT]) of sediment consists of tabular units that are interpreted to be aggradational subglacial till sheets deposited by a grounded ice sheet (i.e., compacted sediments) during the late Pleistocene (Alonso et al., 1992; De Santis et al, 1995). Underlying the till sheets is ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ o f acoustically laminated facies interbedded with lens-shaped layer s that are more transparent and interpreted to be glaciomarine o r hemipelagic sediments and ice-proximal deposits (Böhm et al., 2009) (Figure F13). This site will enable us to determine if ice sheet– overriding events observed at the ANDRILL AND-1B site beneat h the modern Ross Ice Shelf advanced to the shelf edge and will therefore help constrain the contribution of AISs to Pliocene sea level lowstands (Objective 1) (Naish et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2012). During periods of glaciomarine deposition, this site will provide a n opportunity to reconstruct the paleooceanographic and paleoecological conditions at the outermost Ross Sea continental shelf (Objective 2). These sequences, combined with downhole logging to fill in unrecovered sections, are anticipated to provide insights into th e orbital controls on marine-based ice sheet extent (Objective 4).  

# Operations  

After an $88\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1521 that averaged $10.7~\mathrm{kt},$ , the vessel arrived at Site U1522 at $0629\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 22 January 2018. The original operations plan consisted of a single RC B hole to $545\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF; however, after requesting and receiving approval from the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP) an d Texas A&M Safety Panel, we ultimately cored Hole U1522A to 701. 8 m DSF (Cores 374-U1522A-1R through 76R) (Table T2). Core recovery was very poor from 0 to $203.2\textrm{m}$ DSF, was moderate fro m 203.2 to $424.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and improved significantly below that depth. Hole cleaning became problematic near the end of coring operations, and off-bottom torque steadily increased despite multipl e heavy mud sweeps to clean the hole. At the end of coring operations, the hole was displaced with heavy mud $\mathrm{(10.5\\,lb/gal)}$ an d logged with three tool strings: a modified triple combo, the VSI, an d the FMS. The Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) was run on the tripl e combo instead of with the FMS, and the Hostile Environmen t Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS) was run without the source to measure borehole diameter with the caliper. Operations at Site U152 2 concluded at $1311\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 28 January. A total of $149.25\mathrm{~h~}$ (6.2 days ) were spent at Site U1522. RCB coring in Hole U1522A penetrated t o $701.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovered $279.57\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(40\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

The $695.74\mathrm{~m~}$ succession of upper Miocene to recent sedimen t cored at Site U1522 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units $(\operatorname{I}-$ IV). Unit III is further divided into Subunits IIIA–IIIC (Figure F14). Several intervals are characterized by very poor recovery that consists primarily of washed gravel and fall-in, which compromises ou r ability to identify the lithologic variations in some units but may indicate the presence of unrecovered sand- or gravel-rich beds. Th e dominant facies throughout the cores is massive diatom-bearin g diamictite, although some intervals have thin beds of laminate d mudstone,  carbonate-cemented  mudstone,  and  mud-rich  diatomite.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of ${\sim}200~\mathrm{m}$ of Pleistocene diatom-bearing sandy mud, muddy sand, and muddy diamict. The upper ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ of the unit consists of unconsolidated diatom-rich sand y mud to diatom-bearing sandy mud with dispersed clasts. Recover y is mostly poor between ${\sim}3$ and ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and consists primarily of washed cobble and gravel resulting from drilling disturbance. A few recovered intervals contain massive clast-rich diatom-bearing muddy diamict. The base of Unit I is defined by increased lithification of the diamict. Lithostratigraphic Unit II consists of ${\sim}195\;\mathrm{m}$ of Pliocene massive diatom-bearing sandy to muddy diamictite, with clast-rich and clast-poor intervals interbedded over 10s of meters. Diatom-bearing mudstone and deformed (physically intermixed during deposition) discontinuous laminae to centimeterscale beds are occasionally present in the muddy diamictite. Lithostratigraphic Unit III $^{\left(\sim\!250\ \mathrm{m}\right)}$ includes upper Miocene diatomit e and diatom-bearing/rich diamictite and is divided into three subunits based on the style of interbedding and presence of lithologi c accessories. Clasts occur throughout, but clast assemblage an d composition changes between subunits. Subunit IIIA consists o f massive bioturbated diatomite with glauconite and interbedde d massive diatom-rich sandy and muddy diamictite with predominantly small $\langle<\!1\;\mathrm{cm}\rangle$ mudstone clasts. Subunit IIIB consists of interbedded diatom-bearing sandy and muddy diamictite with commo n chert clasts. Subunit IIIC consists of diatom-bearing sandy diamictite. Some intervals contain stratification characterized by thin bed s of laminated mudstone and changes in matrix color, whereas massive diamictite beds are heavily bioturbated. Although the recovered succession contains diverse clast lithologies throughout, basal t clasts are only common in this interval, suggesting a switch in provenance at this time. The base of Subunit IIIC is defined by interbed s of stratified and massive diamictite and diatomite. Lithostratigraphic Unit IV consists of ${\sim}50\mathrm{~m~}$ of upper Miocene interbedde d diatom-bearing sandy diamictite, diatomite, and massive sandy diamictite.  

Micropaleontological investigations were performed on all cor e catcher samples and two additional samples from split core section s to obtain biostratigraphic ages and preliminary paleoenvironmenta l information through examination of diatom, radiolarian, foraminifer, and palynomorph assemblages. Abundance and preservation o f the different microfossil groups strongly varies throughout the sequence. In general, all microfossil groups are rare and comprise  a combination of in situ and reworked taxa in the upper ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF  

A. Diatoms and radiolarians are more abundant between $\mathord{\sim}200$ an d $400\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and dinoflagellates are common in the lower part o f that interval. Deeper than ${\sim}400~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, radiolarians are absent, and palynomorphs and foraminifers are sparse. The diatom assemblage between ${\sim}400$ and $480\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A is poorly preserved and primarily  reworked,  whereas  below ${\sim}480\mathrm{~\,~m~}$ CSF-A,  diato m assemblages are mixed, with a few intervals of well-preserved diverse assemblages interspersed with mostly fragmented sparse assemblages (Figure F14).  

The mudline sample contains a modern low-diversity radiolarian assemblage that is typical of the Antarctic continental shelf, including mainly Antarctissa spp. together with significant number s of Rhizoplegma boreale and the Phormacantha hystrix/Plectacantha oikiskos group. Below the mudline sample, the upper ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A is tentatively assigned a Pleistocene age; however, the combination of sparse microfossils and mix of in situ and reworked tax a hinders straightforward age assignment and environmental reconstructions (Figure F14). Calcareous benthic foraminifers are represented by few specimens of typical late Neogene Ross Sea shel f species, although many of the specimens are likely reworked. On e sample at ${\sim}135\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A contains a well-preserved assemblage tha t includes  the  planktonic  foraminifer  Neogloboquadrina  pachyderma.  

The interval between $\mathord{\sim}200$ and $400\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ is assigned a Pliocene age based on diatoms and radiolarians, which were critical fo r providing age constraints at this site (Figure F14). One sample fro m ${\sim}400\mathrm{\m\,CSF{-}A}$ contains well-preserved diatom, radiolarian, and dinocyst taxa that are indicative of high-productivity environmental conditions that were warmer than today. From ${\sim}400$ to $480\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA, microfossil assemblages are sparse and poorly preserved, and reworking makes age assignment and environmental reconstruction s difficult. Deeper than ${\sim}490\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, the absence of the diato m Thalassiosira torokina indicates a late Miocene age ${>}9$ Ma. Fro m ${\sim}490\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the base of the cored interval at $695.74\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, diatom and dinocyst assemblages suggest an expanded upper Miocene sequence. A few samples from this interval contain well-preserved, diverse dinocyst assemblages that include the late Miocen e species Selenopemphix bothrion (Harland and Pudsey, 2002). Thi s assemblage suggests high productivity, likely with reduced sea ic e relative to present day.  

Paleomagnetic investigations primarily focused on measurements of archive-half core sections to determine ChRM and construct a magnetostratigraphy. The NRM of most archive-half cor e sections was measured before and after progressive AF demagnetization, usually in $5~\mathrm{mT}$ increments to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . NRM intensity commonly  decreases  by  approximately  one  order  of  magnitud e throughout this demagnetization sequence and in general agree s with magnetic susceptibility measured with the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) and Section Half Multisensor Logge r (SHMSL). NRM inclinations are predominantly positive prior to demagnetization and reveal scattered clusters of normal and reverse d polarity after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization.  

Discrete samples were used to test the fidelity of the archive-hal f NRM measurements by progressive demagnetization in $2~\mathrm{mT}$ step s to $20\,\mathrm{mT}_{x}$ , $5\,\mathrm{mT}$ increments to $60\;\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and $10\,\mathrm{mT}$ steps to $80\,\mathrm{mT}$ . Th e NRM directions of a majority of these discrete samples quickly become erratic, but several samples contain a stable direction tha t matches the archive-half directions. The normal and reversed polarity zones identified in both archive halves and discrete sample s cannot yet be confidently correlated to the GPTS with the availabl e biostratigraphic age control; postcruise work to refine the biostratigraphy should improve the correlation. Discrete samples were als o used to measure the AMS to determine magnetic fabric characteristics.  

Physical property measurements were conducted on all core s collected. In general, the whole-round core bulk density and magnetic susceptibility measurements show trends similar to thos e from discrete MAD samples and point measurements of magneti c susceptibility on the section halves (Figure F14). Overall, downhol e trends in magnetic susceptibility, NGR, bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and porosity correspond well with the defined lithostratigraphi c units. In general, higher magnetic susceptibility corresponds t o higher NGR, bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity and lower porosit y and is likely related to the dominance of a mud-rich matrix in th e diamict/diamictite recovered at this site. NGR, density, and $P$ -wav e velocity are lower in lithostratigraphic Unit II (diatom-bearin g sandy and muddy diamictite) relative to Units III and IV, possibl y indicating a change in the clast or matrix composition. In Subunit s IIIB and IIIC and Unit IV, variations in physical properties are related to lithology (muddy diamictite versus sandy diamictite) an d the relative abundance of diatoms, mud clasts, carbonate nodules, and basalt clasts. In these units, higher magnetic susceptibility, NGR, density, and $P$ -wave velocity and lower porosity correspon d to higher proportions of basalt and/or metasedimentary clasts an d diatom-bearing lithologies. Lower magnetic susceptibility, NGR, density, and $P$ -wave velocity and higher porosity correspond t o higher proportions of mud clasts, carbonate nodules, and diatomrich lithologies.  

Headspace gases are low in the uppermost ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A bu t display variable methane and increasing ethane concentration s from ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to the bottom of the hole. Interstitial wate r analyses of the mudline and five whole-round samples indicate earl y diagenesis immediately below the sediment/water interface, wit h sulfate reduction in the upper $100\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A}$ and manganese reduction downhole to $215.4\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. TOC and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents ar e generally low $_{<0.6}$ and ${<}3.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively). Carbonate conten t increases slightly downhole, with values generally higher betwee n ${\sim}400$ and $630\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Figure F14). The slightly elevated carbonate content and decreasing TOC/TN ratio between ${\sim}400$ and $630\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A may suggest more open-marine conditions during deposition of the diamictite of lithostratigraphic Unit III compared wit h Units I and II. Systematic variations in pXRF data indicate the potential for detailed reconstruction of sediment provenance, particularly in Units II–IV.  

Downhole logging consisted of three tool strings: a modified triple combo with the sonic tool and without the source in the densit y tool, the VSI to conduct a VSP experiment, and the FMS. The tripl e combo tool string measured borehole diameter, NGR, resistivity, sonic velocity, and magnetic susceptibility. The triple combo too l string reached $650.3~\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline logging depth below seafloo r (WSF), or ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom of the hole. Caliper data sho w that the borehole size varied significantly, with numerous washe d out intervals and multiple ledges, which resulted in the VSI an d FMS tool strings reaching only to $297.5\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF.  

Despite lower quality borehole conditions than those at Sit e U1521, downhole data generally match well with results from cor e measurements. NGR data from downhole logging show good correspondence with NGR data from whole-round cores, whereas th e core-based $P$ -wave velocity consistently underestimates the velocit y relative to the downhole log data even though the general trends ar e similar. Alongside other downhole logging datasets, the FMS resistivity images appear to be of reasonable quality and should help assess lithologies in the poorly recovered upper part of the formation. Check shot data were successfully collected at eight depths with th e VSI tool (geophone). Raw check shot data were used in preliminar y velocity models for initial core-log-seismic integration.  

# Site U1523  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1523 (proposed Site RSCR-14A) is located on the southeastern flank of the Iselin Bank, ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest of Pennell Basin, at $74^{\circ}9.02^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}47.70^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $828\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figure F15). Th e site is on the outermost continental shelf edge and lies beneath th e modern-day ASC (Orsi and Wiederwohl, 2009). The targeted sediments are drift deposits characterized by stratified, parallel seismi c reflectors with high to medium amplitudes (Figure F16). Undulations in the seafloor and subseafloor reflectors occur toward the to p of the bank, $12~\mathrm{km}$ west of Site U1523, and are interpreted to b e from iceberg scouring. The scour marks crosscut into the younges t strata, and iceberg keels ploughing into this sediment may act to remobilize sediment deposited on the bank. Farther west $(\sim\!80~\mathrm{km})$ , seismic profiles show flat-topped ridges interpreted to represen t grounding-zone wedges. Ice sheet models suggest that during th e Last Glacial Maximum these likely formed as a consequence of eastward ice flow from an ice divide forming on the bathymetric high o f the Pennell Bank (Golledge et al., 2013). Consequently, sedimen t supply at this site could arise from a combination of sources, including the following:  

• Icebergs and suspended sediment from the east via the ACC,   
• Downslope delivery by glacial outwash and glaciogenic debris flows at the margin of an ice sheet grounded on northernmost Pennell Bank west of the site,   
• Downslope delivery by suspended sediment scoured by icebergs west of the site, and   
• Pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation.  

Bottom currents associated with the ACC in this region ar e modeled to be between ${\sim}10$ and $20~\mathrm{cm/s}$ (Padman and Fricker, 2005), and winnowing of fines is expected during periods of enhanced bottom-current flow. Jacobs et al. (1974) reported strong diurnal signals and average and maximum velocities of ${>}17$ and ${>}40$ $\mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s}$ , respectively, at $4\;\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor in $527{-}1201\ \mathrm{m}$ wate r depth in the Ross Sea.  

The primary objectives of Site U1523 were to reconstruct fluctuations in the ACC during the Neogene and Quaternary (Objectiv e 3) and to recover a high-resolution record that can be correlate d with inner and outer shelf records of ice sheet advance and retrea t (e.g., Site U1522 and ANDRILL AND-1B; Naish et al., 2009). Drilling at Site U1523 therefore aimed to sample the upper sedimentar y section above Unconformity RSU4 to achieve this objective. The record of deposition and winnowing beneath the ACC from Sit e U1523 will enable us to test the hypothesis that changes in th e strength of this wind-driven ocean current regulated the southwar d transport of warm CDW onto the Ross Sea continental shelf durin g past ice sheet retreat events. Another objective was the reconstruction of ice-proximal oceanic temperatures and surface water properties during periods of pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation. Thi s reconstruction will constrain the magnitude of polar amplificatio n during past warm periods of the Neogene and Quaternary (Objective 2). An additional objective was to identify processes that gover n sediment transfer between the outermost continental shelf and th e upper continental slope/rise.  

# Operations  

After a $147\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1522 that averaged $11.5~\mathrm{kt}$ , the vessel arrived at Site U1523 at $0158\,\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 29 January 2018. This site is an alternate that was occupied after coring a t Site U1522 demonstrated that core recovery would likely be poor i n the targeted upper interval of the original proposed primary Sit e EBOCS-04B. We planned to core two holes at Site U1523: one core d with the APC system to refusal, followed by an APC/XCB hole t o $450\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Instead, we ultimately cored five holes because difficul t coring conditions required additional holes to achieve the objectives (Table T2). Prior to starting coring, we conducted a seafloo r camera survey to ensure we could avoid large rocks. The survey included tagging the seafloor at four potential hole locations.  

Hole U1523A was cored with a combination of the APC an d HLAPC systems to $46.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, where we were unable to land th e HLAPC core barrel. The hole was terminated, and we pulled th e drill string above the seafloor to try to clean out the bottom-hol e assembly (BHA). After we were unable to reestablish circulatio n through the drill string, we had to pull the pipe back to the surfac e to clean the debris (rocks and sand/gravel) from the BHA. The debris was curated as a ghost core. The APC/XCB BHA was reassembled and run back to the seafloor, and Hole U1523B was cored to  a total depth of $164.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Toward the end of coring operations i n Hole U1523B, hole cleaning became a problem, and off-botto m torque steadily increased despite efforts to clean the hole. In addition, rotary coring with the XCB system yielded very poor recovery, so we terminated operations in Hole U1523B with the intention o f using the HLAPC system in Hole U1523C to target specific stratigraphic gaps not recovered in Holes U1523A and U1523B. Afte r pulling clear of the seafloor from Hole U1523B, it became apparen t that our ability to circulate through the bit jets was compromised. After attempting to clear the bit jets, we started Hole U1523C an d drilled without coring to $43.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. At that depth, we completel y lost circulation through the drill string and were forced to terminat e operations and pull the drill string back to the rig floor.  

We then decided to use the RCB system to core and log to a t least $300\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Hole U1523D was drilled without coring from th e seafloor to $135.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. RCB coring then penetrated from $135.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF to a total depth of $307.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. We opted not to deepen th e hole farther because of very poor recovery $(0.9\;\mathrm{m};-1\%)$ ). At the en d of coring operations, the hole was displaced with heavy mud (10. 5 $1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{gal})$ and logged with two tool strings: a modified triple comb o and the FMS. The DSI was run on the triple combo instead of wit h the FMS, and the HLDS was run without the source for borehol e diameter measurement with the caliper. After logging was completed, we used the APC and HLAPC systems to spot core in Hol e U1523E to cover stratigraphic gaps from Holes U1523A an d U1523B. Hole U1523E was successfully spot cored to $130.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. After coring was completed, the drill string was recovered, and th e rig floor was secured at $0547\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February, ending Hole U1523 E and Site U1523. A total of $147.5~\mathrm{h}$ (6.15 days) were spent at Sit e U1523.  

We collected a total of 64 cores at Site U1523. The APC corin g system was deployed five times, recovering $41.57\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t $(91\%)$ . The HLAPC coring system was used 33 times, collectin g $87.99\,\mathrm{m}\,(59\%)$ . The XCB coring system collected $3.16\:\mathrm{m}$ of core $(5\%)$ over eight cores. The RCB system was deployed 18 times over 172. 8 m, recovering $0.9\textrm{m}(0.5\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Principal results  

The upper ${\sim}155\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment recovered at Site U1523 is divided into three lithostratigraphic units (I–III) dated to the lat e Miocene–Pleistocene (Figure F17). Deeper than ${\sim}155\,\mathrm{~m~}\mathrm{{CSF-A}}$ , poor recovery in Hole U1523D precluded definition of lithostratigraphic units. Several intervals shallower than $155\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ar e characterized by poor recovery, fall-in, and washed gravel, whic h compromises our ability to identify lithologic variations and som e contacts between units but may indicate the presence of unrecovered sand- and/or gravel-rich beds. Where recovered, the contact s between units are mostly sharp. The major facies at Site U1523 ar e massive diamict, mud, diatomite to diatom-rich mudstone, diatombearing mudstone, and sand. The assemblage of facies reflect s open-water to ice-proximal depositional environments on the oute r Ross Sea continental shelf since the late Miocene.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of ${\sim}35\mathrm{~m~}$ of Pleistocene massive to laminated bioturbated greenish gray to grayish brown diatom-bearing  mud  interbedded  at  the  decimeter  scale  wit h foraminifer-bearing/rich sand with dispersed clasts and clast-ric h sandy to muddy diamict. Large rock clasts of diverse lithologies, mud clasts, and pyrite staining occur throughout, and a few shell fragments and lignite were observed in some intervals. The base o f Unit I is defined by a decrease in foraminifer abundance and an increase in diatom abundance. Unit $\mathrm{II}$ is an ${\sim}60\ \mathrm{m}$ thick sequence o f Pliocene to Pleistocene massive to laminated greenish gray diatombearing mud and olive brown to olive gray diatom-rich mud interbedded at the decimeter to meter scale with massive gray to greenish gray muddy sand, sand, and diamict. Bioturbation is commo n throughout Unit II and is defined by the presence of both diatomrich mud/diatom ooze and glauconite, which is most abundant i n sand beds. Pyrite staining, large rock clasts, and mud clasts were observed throughout, and shell fragments, bryozoans, and wor m tubes were observed in some intervals. The base of Unit II is define d by the deepest diatom-rich sandy mud. Unit III includes ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ o f upper Miocene massive to laminated pale green, grayish green, an d dark gray diatom-bearing mud interbedded at the decimeter scal e with greenish gray mud with dispersed clasts, sandy mud, and diamict. Unit III is similar to Unit II but is distinguished by a decreas e in diatoms and an increase in terrigenous components relative t o Unit II.  

Core catcher samples from Holes U1523A, U1523B, U1523D , and U1523E were examined for siliceous (diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, ebridians, and chrysophycean cysts), calcareous (foraminifers), and organic (dinoflagellate cysts and other aquati c palynomorphs, pollen, and spores) microfossils. Diatom remain s were encountered in all samples, and radiolarians are generally rare, but several intervals record higher abundance and better preservation that provide important biostratigraphic control, especially fo r the upper Miocene (Figure F17). A distinctive modern open-ocea n radiolarian assemblage is present in the mudline sample of this site, contrasting with the coastal assemblage present in the mudlin e sample from Site U1522. Organic and calcareous microfossils occu r sporadically throughout the entire recovered sequence. Dinocyst s are often rare, except in the upper Pliocene and upper Miocene intervals. Foraminifers are most abundant in the upper Pleistocene.  A unique monospecific assemblage of agglutinated benthic foraminifers was observed in the upper Miocene of Holes U1523B an d U1523E, and foraminifer assemblages could be correlated betwee n different holes.  

Diatoms, radiolarians, and dinocysts provide a sequence of biostratigraphic datums that allow for correlation across holes and development of a composite age model. Three broad stratigraphi c intervals separated by disconformities correspond generally t o lithostratigraphic units and represent deposition of the followin g intervals (Figure F17):  

• An upper Pleistocene interval composed largely of mixed and reworked sediments (corresponding to lithostratigraphic Unit I),   
• An upper Pliocene to lower Pleistocene interval (Unit II) with sediment accumulation rates approaching $23\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ of diatomrich mud and diatom ooze, and   
• An upper middle Miocene to upper Miocene interval (Unit III).  

Paleomagnetic analyses of Holes U1523A, U1523B, and U1523 E focused on constructing a magnetostratigraphy using ChRM directions. The NRM of archive-half core sections was measured befor e and after progressive AF demagnetization in $5~\mathrm{mT}$ steps to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . NRM intensities prior to demagnetization are mostly ${\sim}10^{-1}~\mathrm{A/m}$ and agree well with WRMSL, SHMSL, and Kappabridge magneti c susceptibility values. This agreement suggests that all of these parameters are approximately equally influenced by magnetic concentration, which seems to be relatively constant throughout all thre e lithostratigraphic units. NRM inclinations are predominantly positive prior to demagnetization but group in clusters of normal an d reversed polarity after AF demagnetization. Discrete samples wer e used to test the fidelity of the archive-half NRM measurements in  a $20~\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization sequence. At least three components are present with variable coercivities: a viscous remanen t magnetization, a drilling overprint, and a third component wit h higher coercivity that most likely carries the ChRM.  

The normal and reversed polarity zones identified in both archive halves and discrete samples are correlated to the GPTS usin g constraints from biostratigraphic datums. These tie points allow u s to tentatively identify the tops of Subchron C2An.1n and Chro n C4An. AMS measurements on discrete samples demonstrate tha t the magnetic fabric is often oblate. However, $k_{\mathrm{min}}$ inclinations ${<}60^{\circ}$ also occur and coincide with intervals of coarser grain sizes, suggesting a change in compaction in these intervals relative to finegrained intervals.  

Physical property measurements were conducted on cores fro m Holes U1523A, U1523B, and U1523E. In general, whole-round cor e bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P$ -wave velocity measurements are in good agreement with discrete MAD samples and poin t measurements of magnetic susceptibility and $P$ -wave velocity o n the section halves (Figure F17). Downhole changes in physica l properties are in good overall agreement with the defined lithostratigraphic units based on sedimentologic characteristics, an d changes in physical properties can provide insight into lithologi c variations in each unit. Magnetic susceptibility is highly variable i n lithostratigraphic Unit I and corresponds to alternating sandy an d muddy layers with abundant clasts and muddy diamict. Bulk densit y increases downhole and is anticorrelated with porosity, which decreases downhole in Unit I, suggesting compaction. Deeper tha n Unit I, bulk density and porosity show significant variation tha t likely reflects diatom content. For instance, low bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and NGR in the middle of Unit II $\langle{\sim}60{-}70\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) correspond to diatom-rich mud intervals. Relatively hig h and stable NGR measurements in Unit III indicate relatively hig h clay mineral content in the massive bioturbated to laminated diatom-bearing mud and sandy mud.  

Samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bul k sediment geochemistry were analyzed at Site U1523. Concentrations of methane and ethane are close to and below the detectio n limit, respectively. In addition to low-resolution interstitial wate r sampling $_{\sim1}$ sample per core or every other half-length core ) throughout Holes U1523A, U1523B, and U1523E, a high-resolutio n profile of interstitial water chemistry was obtained for the upper  8 m in Hole U1523B. Low-resolution downhole trends suggest manganese and sulfate reduction in the suboxic to anoxic transitio n zone ( ${\sim}130\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) (Figure F17). Rapid increases in silica an d manganese concentrations in the upper ${\sim}2\;\mathrm{m}$ probably reflect shallow diagenesis of silica. Bulk sediment TOC and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ are generally low $_{<0.6}$ and $<\!2.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively). TOC is generally slightl y lower in the diatom-bearing mud and diamict of Unit III. Highe r carbonate (up to ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{\wt\%}$ ) was observed in foraminifer-bearin g sandy mud in lithostratigraphic Units I and II. TOC/TN ratios d o not display a discernible trend and suggest mixed input of marin e and terrestrially derived organic matter. pXRF data indicate lowe r and more invariant $\mathrm{Ba}/\mathrm{Al}$ ratios compared with Sites U1521 an d U1522. In contrast, significant downhole variations can be observe d in ratios of refractory elements such as $\mathrm{Th/Ti}$ , which alongside ratios like $\mathrm{Fe/Ti,}$ may serve as a provenance proxy at this site (Figur e F17).  

Downhole logging in Hole U1523D consisted of two tool strings : a modified triple combo with the sonic tool and without the sourc e in the density tool and the FMS. The triple combo measured borehole diameter, NGR, resistivity, sonic velocity, and magnetic susceptibility. The triple combo tool string reached $292\textrm{m}$ WSF, ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the total borehole depth, and the FMS tool string reached 28 8 m WSF. Downhole logging data will be key for interpreting lithologic variation deeper than $155~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1523D, wher e overall core recovery was very poor $\left(0.5\%\right)$ , and in poorly recovere d intervals in the upper parts of the site. Although the caliper dat a identified a number of minor washouts, borehole conditions wer e reasonable, and the log data show good correspondence with th e core data over the ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of overlap. Interestingly, although th e trends and relative changes in magnitude of the NGR log data ar e similar to those from the cores, the core data are higher than thos e measured in situ. On the other hand, core-based $P_{-}$ -wave velocit y data are consistently lower than those from the downhole sonic log. The resistivity data show clear alternations of high and low resistivity throughout the borehole that may correspond to alternating layers of fine and coarse sediments. These alterations are also apparen t in the FMS resistivity images, together with localized high-resistivity spots that are interpreted to be clasts in diamictite.  

# Site U1524  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1524 (proposed Site RSCR-10A) is located on the continental rise at $74^{\circ}13.05^{\prime}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $173^{\circ}37.98^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $2394\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth on th e southeastern levee of the Hillary Canyon (Figure F18). The levee a t this site has a relief of ${\sim}500\mathrm{~m~}$ and is located ${\sim}120~\mathrm{km}$ north of th e Ross Sea continental shelf edge. The head of the Hillary Canyon system is located at the mouths of Pennell Basin and Glomar Challenger Basin. The Hillary Canyon is one of the largest conduits fo r newly formed Ross Sea Bottom Water (RSBW; a type of AABW), which is focused in this channel by dense water formed on the Ros s Sea continental shelf cascading through the troughs and down th e continental slope and rise. The site also lies beneath the modernday westward-flowing ASC (Figure F5). The targeted sediments ar e interpreted from seismic profiles to be channel-overspill and drif t deposits characterized by stratified, parallel seismic reflectors wit h high to medium amplitude (Figure F19).  

The primary objectives of Site U1524 were to obtain a near-continuous post–Unconformity RSU3 (upper Miocene to Pleistocene ) and pre–Unconformity RSU3 (middle to upper Miocene) sedimen t sequence to provide a high-resolution chronology and an ice-dista l record of glacial–interglacial cycles. The continental rise location o f Site U1524 should allow a more complete assessment of oceanic response to AIS variability. The record of deposition from Site U152 4 was anticipated to be primarily influenced by RSBW flowing dow n the Hillary Canyon, but also by an alongslope component caused b y the westerly flowing ASC. Consequently, this site will enable assessment of the oceanographic influence on ice sheet variability an d bottom water production (Objective 2). The direct record of AAB W flow down the Hillary Canyon obtained at Site U1524 could potentially be extrapolated to high-fidelity paleoceanographic record s farther afield in the abyssal Pacific Ocean to better constrain th e Antarctic influences on the global oceanic deep circulation. Th e Hillary Canyon is also a main route for glacial sediments bein g eroded and transported by ice streams from the innermost continental shelf to its edge, and provenance studies of the terrigenou s sediment may allow for identification of changing ice sheet drainag e pathways through the Neogene and Quaternary. Because Sit e U1524 is near the crest of the levee of the Hillary Canyon, it will als o provide a high-resolution record for documenting the deep-sea response to ice sheet change on the continental shelf, which is recorded in the Ross Sea inner (ANDRILL Site AND-1B; Naish et al., 2009) and outer (IODP Site U1522) continental shelf. IBRD could b e sourced by icebergs calving from the Ross Sea, as well as transported from the east through the ASC, providing a proxy for dynamic ice discharge from the Pacific coastline sector of the WAIS. Pelagic sediments deposited during periods of high productivity o r a lull in turbidity current overspill deposition will provide a recor d of surface water properties, including sea ice cover, SST, stratification, and salinity. These proxy records will enable us to assess th e magnitude of polar amplification during past warm climates (Objective 2), as well as the role of oceanic forcing of ice sheet retreat o r advance at these times (Objective 3). In addition, continuous deposition was anticipated at this site through much of the Neogene an d Quaternary to allow for assessment of the orbital response of th e WAIS and adjacent oceanic/biological system over a range of pas t climatic conditions (Objective 4).  

# Operations  

After a $52\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1523 that averaged 11.1 kt, th e vessel arrived at Site U1524 at $1027\,\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ on 4 Februar y 2018. This site is an alternate site for primary proposed Site RSCR02B. We decided to occupy the alternate site because the highes t priority target is shallower, the seismic facies show less evidence fo r transported sediment, and the sea ice edge was farther away. Th e original plan called for three holes, one cored to refusal with th e APC system followed by an APC/XCB hole to $350\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The thir d hole was to be cored to $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF with the RCB system and the n logged with three tool strings. We ultimately cored three holes (Table T2). Hole U1524A was cored with the APC/XCB system t o $299.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Hole U1524B consists of a single mudline core collected for high-resolution interstitial water and microbiology sampling. Hole U1524C is an RCB hole cored to $441.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

Hole U1524A was cored to APC refusal at $270.3\textrm{m}$ DSF, afte r which we deployed the HLAPC system; however, the first core advanced only $_{0.4\mathrm{~m~}}$ to $270.7\,\textrm{m}$ DSF, indicating HLAPC refusal.  

Downhole formation temperatures were taken on Cores 6H $\mathrm{51.5\,m}$ DSF), 9H ( $80.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF), 12H ( $108.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF), and 15H ( $137~\mathrm{m}$ DSF ) using the Advanced Piston Corer Temperature tool (APCT-3). Following HLAPC refusal, we deployed the XCB system and cored t o $299.5\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{DSF},$ but each XCB core returned with a shattered liner an d highly disturbed sediment. At that point, we terminated coring an d pulled out of the hole because of approaching sea ice. After pullin g out of the hole, enough time remained to collect a single mudlin e core (Hole U1524B) for high-resolution interstitial water and microbiological studies. After terminating coring in Hole U1524B, w e retrieved the drill string and departed Site U1524 at $2030~\mathrm{h}$ on  6 February. With sea ice estimated to remain over Site U1524 for a t least 2 days, we opted to occupy Site U1525 (proposed Site RSCR03A), located only $47\;\mathrm{nmi}$ away but in a position south of the sea ic e edge. After ice monitoring determined that the sea ice was movin g away from Site U1524, we ended operations at Site U1525 at $0535\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February to return to Site U1524. After arriving back at Sit e U1524 at $1006~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{{r}}}$ , we prepared for RCB coring operations in Hol e U1524C. While deploying the drill string, we lowered the subse a camera to retrieve the beacon, which had failed to release whe n abandoning the site. After retrieving the beacon, Hole U1524C wa s drilled without coring to $260.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and then RCB cored to 441. 9 m DSF, where we were forced to terminate operations because of  a mechanical breakdown of the port stern tube shaft and arrangement that ended Expedition 374 science operations. The rig floo r was secured for transit at $1835\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 February, ending Site U1524. Total time spent at Site U1524 was $117.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (4.9 days).  

We collected a total of 54 cores at Site U1524. The APC syste m was deployed 31 times, collecting $284.17\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(102\%)$ . Th e HLAPC system was deployed once, recovering $0.43\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of cor e $(108\%)$ . The XCB system collected $5.51\textrm{m}$ over three cores $(19\%)$ . The RCB system was used 19 times, collecting $19.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(11\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Principal results  

Site U1524 includes three holes, the deepest cored to $441.9\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The upper Miocene to Pleistocene sediment recovered is divided into three lithostratigraphic units (I–III). Unit I is divided int o three subunits (IA, IB, and IC) (Figure F20). Contacts between unit s and subunits are mostly gradational and are distinguished by gradual changes in biogenic content. The major facies at Site U1524 ar e diatom-bearing mud, diatom-rich mud, diatom ooze, sandy mud, and muddy diamict. The assemblage of facies reflects pelagic sedimentation with ice rafting and winnowing/redeposition by downslope, alongslope, and turbidity currents. The sediment recovered a t Site U1524 reveals reworking by these current systems superimposed on variations in terrigenous and marine sediment suppl y since the late Miocene on the upper continental rise of the Ross Sea. Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{m}$ of upper Pliocene t o Pleistocene unconsolidated massive to laminated diatom-bearing/rich mud interbedded with muddy diatom ooze. A gradual downhole increase in diatom content characterizes this unit an d was used to distinguish three subunits based on increasing percentage of biogenic material. Subunit IA consists of ${\sim}78\;\mathrm{m}$ of massive t o laminated light yellowish brown to brown diatom-bearing/rich mu d interbedded at the decimeter to meter scale with greenish gray diatom-bearing/rich mud to sandy mud with dispersed clasts. San d laminae and lenses are increasingly abundant toward the base of th e unit. A $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick volcanic ash layer is present in Subunit IA. Th e base of this subunit is marked by a transition from olive gray diatom-rich mud to greenish gray diatom-rich mud with sandy mu d  

interbeds. Subunit IB $\sim\!78\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) consists of meter-scale interbeds of olive gray and greenish gray diatom-rich mud/sandy mud t o muddy diatom ooze with dispersed clasts. The abundance of millimeter-scale silty to sandy laminations increases downhole in thi s subunit. The base of Subunit IB is defined by an increase in thickness and frequency of sandy mud beds with clasts. Subunit IC consists of ${\sim}45\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of interbedded olive gray diatom-rich mud an d muddy diatom ooze that is similar to Subunit IB but features an increase in the biogenic component with thinner greenish gray bed s and thicker beds of sandy mud with dispersed clasts. Pyrite stainin g is present throughout this subunit. The boundary between Units  I and II is marked by a sharp contact between diatom-rich mud an d muddy diatom ooze. Unit II consists of ${\sim}117\mathrm{~m~}$ of massive to laminated olive gray muddy diatom ooze interbedded with bioturbate d to laminated greenish gray diatom ooze and diatom-rich sand y mud. The olive gray muddy diatom ooze beds include pyrite staining and sand/silt laminations, and the greenish gray diatom ooz e beds contain more intense bioturbation. The contact between Unit s II and III is defined by the first downhole occurrence of massive diamict. Unit III $120\textrm{m}$ thick) consists of massive to laminated diatom-rich dark greenish gray mud interbedded with greenish gra y massive diatom-rich sand and sandy mud with dispersed clasts, muddy diamict, and muddy diatom ooze. The lower contacts o f sandy mud beds are usually gradational and bioturbated.  

A total of 47 core catcher samples from Holes U1524A an d U1524C were analyzed for siliceous (diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, ebridians, and chrysophycean cysts), calcareous (foraminifers),  and  organic  (dinoflagellate  cysts  and  other  aquati c palynomorphs, pollen, and spores) microfossils. The mudline an d core catcher samples from Core 374-U1524B-1H were also examined. The occurrence and abundance of the different microfossi l groups varies greatly throughout the Site U1524 sediment column. Rich assemblages of diatoms, silicoflagellates, and ebridians occu r throughout, whereas radiolarians are generally rare but common t o abundant in several samples, particularly in the lower Pliocene an d Miocene intervals where they provide valuable biostratigraphi c control (Figure F20). Foraminifers and palynomorphs are generall y sparse.  

Although all investigated microfossil groups supply valuable information, radiolarians and diatoms provide well-constrained agediagnostic taxa used to develop an age-depth model for the site (Figure F20). Reworking and mixing of diatom assemblages of multipl e ages limited the biostratigraphic utility of diatoms from the seafloo r to ${\sim}80\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The underlying stratigraphic sequence can be assigned  to  several  biostratigraphic  zones  that  are  sometime s bounded by unconformities that also correspond to the lithostratigraphic unit boundaries. The ${\sim}80{-}120\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A interval is dated t o the early Pleistocene. Deeper than $120\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ is an ${\sim}160\;\mathrm{m}$ thic k Pliocene interval rich in diatoms. A disconformity representing $>\!1.0$ My is interpreted between ${\sim}273$ and $283\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. An ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ thic k interval of lower Pliocene between ${\sim}283$ and $_{310\;\mathrm{m}}$ CSF-A overlie s another disconformity interpreted between ${\sim}310$ and $320\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ . Sediment deeper than this hiatus is dated to ${>}8.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (late Miocene), and the deepest sample from the site ${\sim}437\mathrm{~m}$ CSF-A) is dated t o ${<}10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Paleomagnetic investigations primarily focused on generating  a magnetostratigraphy to assist with establishing a chronostratigraphy. NRM measurements were generally conducted prior to and after AF demagnetization with peak fields of 10 and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . Initia l NRM intensities oscillate around $\mathord{\sim}10^{-1}$ to $10^{-3}\mathrm{~A/m}$ and decreas e after demagnetization to $\mathrm{\sim}10^{-2}$ to $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . These oscillations agre e well with variations in magnetic susceptibility, suggesting that magnetic particle concentration has a comparable effect on these parameters and potentially decreases downhole. After removal of th e drilling-induced, downward-directed overprint, inclinations cluste r in generally steep upward and downward directions. These cluster s represent normal and reversed polarity zones, respectively, that ca n be tied to the GPTS using independent biostratigraphic datums. W e identified all normal and reversed (sub)chrons between Chron C1 n (Brunhes; $0{-}0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and the top of Subchron C2An.2r (3.20 7 Ma). Magnetic fabric experiments were also conducted to check fo r subtle disturbances that may yield unreliable directions, as well a s for differential compaction in the different lithostratigraphic units. Generally, most samples have an undisturbed oblate fabric commo n in sedimentary settings, but the degree of anisotropy is variable between lithostratigraphic units and may relate to factors such as differences in sedimentation rate.  

Physical properties measurements were conducted on wholeround cores from Holes U1524A and U1524C, together with additional measurements on split-core sections and discrete samples. I n general, data from whole-round measurements show trends simila r to those from split-core measurements. A small deviation betwee n whole-round measurements of GRA bulk density and $P$ -wave velocity compared with discrete measurements deeper than ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1524A is likely due to core expansion generated b y degassing during the equilibration of the cores to room temperature. Downhole changes in physical properties are in good overall agreement with the defined lithostratigraphic units based on sedimentologic characteristics, and changes in physical properties i n each unit can provide insight into lithologic changes in each unit.  

Overall, there is a good correlation between magnetic susceptibility, NGR, and bulk density measurements (Figure F20). These parameters are inversely correlated with the sediment color $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ parameter and appear to relate to diatom content, with a general increase downhole over tens of meters, together with variabilit y caused by interbedded lithologies. Taken together, these results suggest that sedimentary deposition is governed by variations in biogenic and terrigenous inputs. Apparent cyclicity is observed i n these parameters. Overall, these parameters suggest a higher terrigenous content in lithostratigraphic Subunit IA, decreasing terrigenous content and increasing biogenic content throughout Subunit s IB and IC, and maximum biogenic content in Unit II, which is predominantly diatom ooze. Lithostratigraphic Unit III also has highe r terrigenous content corresponding to interbedded diatom-ric h mud. Downhole formation temperature measurements with the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) indicate a geothermal gradient of $58^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ , which when combined with thermal conductivity measured on sediment cores from Site U1524, indicates a heat flow of $53.7\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ .  

Samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bul k sediment geochemistry were analyzed at Site U1524. Concentrations of methane and ethane are close to or below the detectio n limit in the uppermost ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A but increase to higher concentrations at greater depths (to 42,000 ppmv at $180\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A fo r methane). Interstitial water sampling was conducted at low resolution ( $_{\sim1}$ sample per core in the upper $100\;\mathrm{m}$ and approximately every third core downhole from that depth, depending on cor e recovery) in Holes U1524A and U1524C. A high-resolution interstitial water profile was also obtained for the upper $7.56~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A i n Hole U1524B. Low- and high-resolution downhole trends sho w clear manganese and sulfate reduction in the suboxic to anoxic transition zone in the upper ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Figure F20). A rapid increase in silica concentration in the upper $2\,\mathrm{~m~CSF-A~}$ probabl y reflects shallow diagenesis of silica. Elevated barium concentratio n deeper than ${\sim}90\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A may indicate barite dissolution in an environment where interstitial water is undersaturated with respect t o barite. Bulk sediment TOC and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents are generally lo w throughout the site but reveal distinct variability in lithostratigraphic Unit I. Higher percentages of carbonate content were observed in Subunits IB and IC and in a carbonate-cemente d mudstone in Unit III. TN content in the bulk sediments is very low, and TOC/TN ratios display similar trends to total organic carbon.  

# Site U1525  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1525 (proposed Site RSCR-03A) is located on the continental slope at $75^{\circ}0.06^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $173^{\circ}55.20^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at $1776\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth on th e southeastern levee of the Hillary Canyon in a depositional settin g similar to that of Site U1524 $\langle{\sim}87~\mathrm{km}$ northeast) (Figure F21). Sit e U1525 is closer to the continental shelf edge, which lies ${\sim}60~\mathrm{km}$ south of the site, and the mouths of the Pennell and the Gloma r Challenger Basins. The levee shows asymmetric flanks: a stee p northeastern erosional flank with a relief of ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ and a less stee p southwestern flank with a relief of only $_{30\textrm{m}}$ . The northwest flan k sharply truncates parallel high-amplitude reflectors, outcropping a t the seafloor, and chaotic seismic facies suggest that slope failure features affect the mid- to lower units of the seismic profile (Figur e F22).  

The Hillary Canyon is one of the largest conduits for newl y formed RSBW, which is focused in this channel by cascading dens e water formed on the Ross Sea continental shelf passing down th e continental rise. The site also lies beneath the modern-day westward flowing ASC (Figure F5), which is thought to be stronger her e than at the deeper water Site U1524 (Whitworth et al. 1995; Ors i and Wiederwohl, 2009). Seismic profiles indicate that the targete d sediments at Site U1525 are dominated by channel-overspill an d drift deposits characterized by stratified, parallel seismic reflector s with high to medium amplitude (Figure F22). These strata in th e upper ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{m}$ of the site are likely glacial debris flows interlayere d with interglacial hemipelagic units of Pleistocene age that formed  a prograding shelf-margin trough mouth fan at the mouth of the Glomar Challenger Basin since the late Miocene (Unconformity RSU3).  

The continental slope location of Site U1525 should allow for  a more complete assessment of oceanic forcing of (and response to ) AIS variability. The record of deposition from Site U1525 was anticipated to be primarily influenced by RSBW flowing down the Hillary  Canyon,  but  this  signal  is  modified  by  an  alongslop e component associated with the westerly flowing ASC. Consequently, this site will enable assessment of ocean forcing for ic e sheet variability and drivers of bottom water production (Objectiv e 2). The direct record of RSBW flow down Hillary Canyon obtaine d at Site U1525 could potentially be extrapolated to high-fidelity paleoceanographic records farther afield in the abyssal Pacific Ocean t o better constrain the Antarctic influences on the global oceanic dee p circulation. Hillary Canyon is also a main route for glacial sediments being eroded and transported by ice streams from the innermost continental shelf to its edge. Provenance studies of th e terrigenous sediment may allow identification of changing ice shee t drainage pathways through the Neogene and Quaternary.  

IBRD could be sourced by icebergs from the Ross Sea, as well a s those transported from the east by the ASC, providing a proxy fo r dynamic ice discharge from the Pacific Ocean coastline sector of th e WAIS. Pelagic deposits are from periods of high productivity or  a lull in turbidity current–overspill deposition and will provide prox y records of surface water properties, including sea ice cover, SST, stratification, and salinity. These proxy records will enable an assessment of the magnitude of polar amplification during past war m climates (Objective 2), as well as the role of oceanic forcing of ic e sheet fluctuations during those times (Objective 3). In addition, continuous deposition was anticipated through much of the lat e Neogene and Quaternary at this site, which would allow assessmen t of the orbital response of the WAIS and adjacent oceanic/biological systems over a range of past climatic conditions (Objective 4). Th e late Quaternary record in the uppermost $50\;\mathrm{m}$ of glacial strata ca n also shed light on recent ice sheet advances.  

# Operations  

After a $50\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1524 averaging $8.9\,\mathrm{kt},$ , the vessel arrived at Site U1525 at ${0200}\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 7 February 2018. This alternate site was added to the schedule when we were force d to temporarily leave Site U1524 because of encroaching sea ice. Th e operational plan for Site U1525 consisted of APC/XCB coring in  a single hole until ice moved away from Site U1524. Hole U1525A wa s cored to a total depth of $213.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF using a combination of APC, HLAPC, and XCB coring (Table T2). The XCB system was deployed in the upper part of the hole ( $43.0{-}55.7\mathrm{~m~l~}$ DSF) to core pas t an indurated interval. We then switched back to piston coring an d continued to core using both the APC and HLAPC systems to 131. 2 m DSF. We continued coring with the XCB system to $213.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DS F and terminated the hole at that depth after receiving confirmatio n that the sea ice was expected to clear from Site U1524 by the nex t day. The rig floor was secured for transit at $0535\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February t o return to Site U1524. A total of $51.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.1 days) was spent in Hol e U1525.  

We collected 33 cores at Site U1525. The APC system was deployed 8 times, collecting $63.23\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(103\%)$ ). The HLAPC system was deployed 14 times, recovering $52.64\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(92\%)$ . Th e XCB system was used 11 times and collected $42.83\;\mathrm{m}$ $(45\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

Site U1525 cored a single hole to $208.28\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF-A}}$ . The $158.70\:\mathrm{m}$ of Pleistocene sediment recovered is divided into three lithostratigraphic units (I–III). Unit II is divided into Subunits IIA and II B (Figure F23). A few intervals (typically $<\!15\;\mathrm{m}$ in length) are characterized by poor recovery, compromising our ability to identify lithologic variations. The major facies at Site U1525 are massive t o stratified diamict, sand, mud, diatom-bearing mud, and diatom-ric h mud to diatom ooze. The assemblage of facies reflects an interpla y between distal downslope, alongslope (e.g., winnowing), hemipelagic, and pelagic processes in a relatively ice distal glaciomarine setting. Both thin laminations (millimeter to centimeter scale) an d thick beds (meter scale) are recognized in all units and may b e linked to glacial dynamics and ocean circulation variations durin g the Pleistocene.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I consists of ${\sim}51\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of unconsolidate d massive bioturbated gray diatom-bearing/rich mud to sandy mu d with dispersed clasts interbedded on a meter scale with gray to ligh t yellowish brown clast-poor to clast-rich muddy diamict. Unit I bedding contacts are sharp to gradational. The muddy diamict is overcompacted in some intervals and contains randomly distribute d clasts of igneous and metamorphic composition. The base of Unit  I is in an interval of poor recovery; however, it is defined by a shar p contact between the overlying diamict and diatom-rich mud. Unit I I consists of ${\sim}68\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of massive to laminated greenish gray diatombearing/rich mud and diatom ooze with dispersed clasts interbedded at the decimeter to meter scale with sandy mud and diamict. Unit II is divided into two subunits based on diatom abundance an d the structure and texture of laminations. Subunit IIA contains welldefined millimeter-scale fine sand, silt, and biosiliceous lamination s with sharp lower boundaries and internal normal grading. Clasts, soft-sediment deformation features, and microfaulting can be observed in the laminated sequences. Subunit IIA also contains intervals of bioturbated foraminifer-bearing sand with sharp upper an d lower contacts in the massive diatom-bearing/rich mud beds. Th e boundary between Subunits IIA and IIB is distinguished by the onset of very thinly laminated silt and mud with better preservatio n and higher percentages of intact diatom frustules. Subunit IIB contains fine-grained sand and silt laminae in coarser grained sand y mud and diamict beds. Clasts, pyrite staining, and sand pods, lenses, and stringers can be observed throughout the subunit. Th e base of Unit II is defined by a sharp contact between the laminate d mud of Unit II and the underlying clast-rich sandy diamict. Unit II I consists of ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{m}$ of massive to laminated greenish gray diatom-ric h mud to muddy diatom ooze with dispersed to common clasts interbedded with massive bioturbated greenish gray diatom-rich sand y mud with dispersed clasts and diamict. Clasts, pyrite staining, an d coarse sand pods/lenses and stringers occur throughout.  

Core catcher samples from Site U1525 were analyzed for siliceous (diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, and ebridians), calcareous (foraminifers and nannofossils), and organic (dinoflagellat e cysts and other aquatic palynomorphs, pollen, and spores) microfossils. Samples in the upper ${\sim}107\,\mathrm{~m~}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ of the section ar e mostly devoid of microfossils, contain only trace numbers, or include a “residual” assemblage of resistant forms that have likel y been engaged in multiple phases of transport and reworking by ic e and/or bottom currents (Figure F23). Diatom taxa found in this interval are eroded and were transported from discrete source beds o f Miocene to early Pliocene age. One age-diagnostic radiolarian even t found in this interval indicates an age $>\!0.65$ Ma at ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Several discrete intervals of foraminifer-bearing/rich sand are present near the base of this interval, and a sparse, moderately well-preserved Neogene assemblage of calcareous nannofossils was found i n one of these beds.  

Deeper than ${\sim}107\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, siliceous microfossils are mor e abundant and well preserved, and several age diagnostic radiolarians and diatoms were encountered (Figure F23). Although a smal l background presence of reworked diatoms continues in this interval, the sequence can confidently be assigned an early Pleistocen e age. Planktonic and benthic foraminifers are also most abundan t and diverse in this lower Pleistocene section, and the presence o f the temperate planktonic species Globoconella inflata at ${\sim}89\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and Globigerina bulloides and Globigerina falconensis a t ${\sim}125\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A indicates the presence of warmer-than-present water. Dinocysts are sparse in this interval, and only one sample fro m the lower Pleistocene ( ${\sim}155\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) contains abundant specimens, comprising species so far only known from upper Quaternary sediments of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, sout h of the Polar Front.  

We developed an age model for Site U1525 using a combinatio n of radiolarian and diatom biostratigraphic events. A hiatus is detected by biostratigraphic (diatom) marker species between ${\sim}111$ and $117~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A that constrains the age of sediments deeper tha n this interval to ${>}2.35$ Ma and shallower sediments to ${<}1.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Th e lowermost ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ of the Site U1525 sequence represents a n expanded lower Pleistocene section (Figure F23) with a sustaine d high sediment accumulation rate of $>\!60\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . Above the disconformity, significant amounts of reworked microfossils in the uppe r ${\sim}107\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A preclude definitive age assignment for the interval.  

Paleomagnetic investigations were primarily focused on determining the ChRM to construct a magnetostratigraphy. The initial NRM was measured at $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals on most archive-half core sections, followed by NRM measurements after AF demagnetization o f 10 and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ to remove a potential drilling overprint. NRM intensity of cores shallower than ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A decreases up to an orde r of magnitude after $10~\mathrm{mT},$ whereas NRM intensity of cores deepe r than ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A decreases by $30\%{-}50\%$ after demagnetization. Initial NRM inclination is generally steep and downward directed, but AF demagnetization removes this overprint to reveal clusters o f steep upward- and downward-directed inclinations. We interpre t these clusters to be normal and reversed polarity zones. To test th e fidelity of these polarity zones, we also subjected a selected group o f oriented discrete samples to a 20-step demagnetization protocol and used PCA to determine the ChRM direction. The discrete an d archive-half measurements agree well, so we can correlate the normal and reversed polarity zones to the GPTS aided by the independent biostratigraphic age control. We identify the Jaramillo (0.988– $1.072\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) and Cobb Mountain (1.173–1.185 Ma) Subchrons an d the Olduvai Chron (1.778–1.945 Ma). We correlate a zone of reversed polarity below the hiatus to Subchron C2r.2r (2.148–2.58 1 Ma) based on diatom constraints.  

Physical property measurements were conducted on all core s from Hole U1525A. In general, the whole-round core GRA bul k density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P$ -wave velocity measurement s are in good agreement with discrete MAD samples and point measurements of magnetic susceptibility and $P$ -wave velocity on th e section halves over the upper $131\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, which were primaril y cored with the APC and HLAPC systems (Figure F23). The switc h to XCB coring deeper than $131\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A had an effect on wholeround measurements, especially magnetic susceptibility, NGR, an d GRA bulk density, because the diameter of XCB cores does no t completely fill the core liner. The $P$ -wave logger was turned of f deeper than $131\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ .  

In lithostratigraphic Unit I, magnetic susceptibility, NGR, bul k density, $P.$ -wave velocity, and shear strength increase downhole an d porosity decreases (Figure F23). These changes reflect both compaction and slight changes in lithology in the diatom-bearing sand y mud interbedded with clast-poor muddy diamict. Peaks in magnetic susceptibility, NGR, bulk density, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, and shea r strength and a decrease in porosity occur in a short interval in Uni t I $({\sim}15{-}18\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ , reflecting increased clasts, clay, and compaction in this clast-rich diamict unit interpreted to be a debris flow. I n Unit II, decimeter-scale cyclicity is visible in magnetic susceptibilit y and NGR and is likely related to downhole changes in lithology. Shear strength in Unit II also demonstrates downhole cyclicity tha t may be related to lithologic changes or compaction. Generally lowe r magnetic susceptibility, NGR, density, and $P$ -wave velocity in Uni t III reflect increased diatom content.  

Samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bul k sediment geochemistry were analyzed at Site U1525. Headspace ga s (methane and ethane) concentration is low in the upper $124\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF}}.$ A and increases to 6640 and 7 ppmv, respectively, at $194\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Interstitial water analyses of the mudline and 12 whole-round samples indicate biogeochemical zonation with sulfate reduction in th e uppermost $100\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Downhole variations in silica concentration broadly correspond with lithologic changes (Figure F23) , whereas calcium concentration decreases from seawater-like value s in the uppermost $32\,\mathrm{~m~}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ to a minimum value around th e boundary between lithostratigraphic Subunit IIB and Unit III. Lithium concentration increases by a factor of three along a linear tren d deeper than ${\sim}60\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. TOC and carbonate contents are lo w $(<\!1\%$ and $5\%$ , respectively) throughout the site. The highest an d most variable carbonate content and TOC/TN ratios occur in th e uppermost ${\sim}35\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in lithostratigraphic Unit I.  

# Expedition synthesis and preliminary scientific assessment  

Operational considerations relating to the science objectives  

The overarching goal of Expedition 374 was to drill a transec t from the outer Ross Sea continental shelf to the continental ris e (Figure F24) to identify oceanic forcings and feedbacks relating t o past ice sheet variability from the Neogene to Quaternary. Unfortunately, this ambition was not fully realized because a mechanica l failure with the vessel resulted in termination of all drilling operations and a loss of 16 onsite operational days (from a total of 41). The loss of $39\%$ of our operational time restricted our ability t o achieve all objectives as originally envisioned. Although aspects o f all objectives can be met in part, this unforeseen change in the operations plan severely compromised the plan to recover continuou s records from the deep-water sites covering contemporaneous periods collected on the continental shelf. We also note that drilling operations in the Antarctic are inherently more challenging than othe r regions due to weather, ice, and lithologic considerations that hav e traditionally resulted in poor recovery on the Antarctic continenta l shelf. Expedition 374 was highly successful in this context. The discussion below provides a synthesis of these successes and highlight s the importance of a flexible operations plan and large numbers o f alternate sites to adapt to these Antarctic-specific considerations. We also document some of the challenges that remain despite ou r very targeted approach to drilling in this environment.  

In general, the operations plan successfully mitigated most risk s associated with weather, ice, and lithology. Recovery rates using th e RCB coring method at the continental shelf sites were higher tha n expected, particularly in the lithified Miocene strata at Site U152 1 with $63\%$ total recovery, which is the highest recovery rate for shipbased drilling on the Antarctic continental shelf. Total recovery a t Site U1522 on the outer continental shelf was $40\%$ but proved mor e difficult in the unlithified Plio–Pleistocene sediments shallowe r than $400\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A $21\%$ recovery). However, recovery was far mor e successful in the upper Miocene lithified diamictite intervals deepe r than $400\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A ( $64\%$ recovery), which were the primary target s of this site. Our original operations plan included coring at proposed Site EBOCS-04B after completing operations at Site U1522. Seismic correlations indicated that the targeted section at propose d Site EBOCS-04B is almost identical to the unlithified Plio–Pleistocene lithologies we encountered in the upper $400~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A at Sit e U1522. Given our experience of poor recovery in these lithologies a t Site U1522, we had low confidence in our ability to obtain a recovery rate at proposed Site EBOCS-04B suitable to meet our objectives. Consequently, we modified the operations plan to core  a different depositional setting at Site U1523, which targeted a Miocene to Pleistocene sediment drift on the outermost continenta l shelf. This depositional setting had never been sampled by dee p drilling in the Antarctic, although shallow piston and gravity core s indicate that the upper sediment at the site location consists of unconsolidated diatomaceous mud and sand with clasts. This site provided its own challenges, with soft diatom-rich and mud-ric h lithologies interbedded with unconsolidated gravels and indurate d strata. Consequently, we adopted a novel approach of targeted halflength piston coring, whereby the gravel-rich and indurated lithologies that were impossible to recover with any type of corin g method were identified in the first two holes (U1523A an d U1523B). After examination of drilling parameters (e.g., penetratio n rate and weight on bit), core catcher material, and assessment o f downhole logs from Hole U1523D, a final hole (U1523E) was advanced without coring through these difficult lithologies, an d HLAPC cores were successfully collected in the underlying softe r lithologies. This resulted in high recovery $(73\%)$ of the targeted ${\sim}95\$ m thick Plio–Pleistocene interval. XCB coring in Miocene strata below this depth was less successful, but sporadic intervals of high recovery will provide an important archive of this rarely sampled tim e period in Antarctica. An attempt was made to RCB core at Sit e U1523 but, as anticipated for these lithologies, recovery was ver y poor $(0.5\%)$ , and this hole was primarily intended to serve as  a “clean” hole for downhole logging purposes to complete the missin g stratigraphy of the APC/HLAPC- and XCB-cored intervals. Thus, despite the extremely poor recovery in Hole U1523D, this RCB hol e proved highly valuable because hole conditions were suitable to obtain downhole logs.  

Recovery rates with the APC coring methods were expected t o be very high on the continental rise sites, and this proved to be th e case, with Site U1524 obtaining $100\%$ recovery in the $270~\mathrm{m}$ thic k interval that was APC/HLAPC cored. Recovery was poor in th e XCB cored interval, and many XCB cores returned with shattere d core liners (14 out of 22; $64\%$ ). We speculated that this unexpecte d result was due to the very cold surface sea waters $(-1.5^{\circ}$ to $-2^{\circ}C)$ used as drilling fluid. This issue should be investigated for future expeditions that drill in extreme cold-water regions. At Site U1524, XCB coring was terminated due to poor recovery, and this decisio n coincided with a weather event that pushed sea ice toward the site. We mitigated for sea ice risk in our plan by identifying a large number of alternate sites. The shipboard ice observer indicated that th e sea ice would pass completely over Site U1524 in ${\sim}3$ days. Considering the short time window for operations elsewhere before we coul d return to Site U1524 to complete our primary objectives, we collected a single APC core in Hole U1524B for high-resolution microbiological and interstitial water sampling. We then temporaril y abandoned Site U1524 due to the encroaching sea ice and decide d to piston core a nearby $^\mathrm{{47}\ n m i)}$ upper continental rise site (U1525). This site required minimal transit time and provided a complementary record that overlaps with the upper part of Site U1524 but in  a more proximal setting to the continental shelf, thus providing a hybrid record of the depositional processes observed at Sites U152 3 and U1524 (e.g., ASC vigor and AABW formation, respectively). After being informed that the sea ice would drift off Site U1524 by th e next day, we terminated coring at $213.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A because the XC B coring at Site U1525 also proved problematic, with multiple shattered core liners. We returned to Site U1524 to core with the RC B system to a target depth of $1000\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , but the site was terminated at $442~\mathrm{m}$ DSF due to the mechanical failure and terminatio n of all drilling operations. Consequently, Site U1524 was terminate d before our stratigraphic target could fully be met, and we were unable to obtain the deeper sediment that was a primary objective o f that site. This deeper sediment would have contained a middle Miocene continental rise record of paleoenvironments from the sam e time period as the high-quality continental shelf record from Sit e  

U1521. Termination of operations also precluded us from coring  a final hole to APC refusal to recover a complete stratigraphy in th e upper part of the sequence. Despite these setbacks, many aspects o f the continental shelf-to-rise transect can be achieved for the Plio– Pleistocene interval through comparison with records from Site s U1522–U1525 and the ANDRILL program.  

The mechanical failure also meant we could not recover a record from proposed Site RSCR-19A, which was a late addition alternate site that was upgraded to a primary site during the early phas e of the expedition because we recognized it was the most suitabl e site at which to obtain a high-fidelity and continuous record of pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation in the Ross Sea. Despite the unforeseen mechanical issue compromising much of the science plan, the material recovered during Expedition 374 will still provide unprecedented insights into the coupled nature of past marine-base d ice sheets in West Antarctica and the adjacent water masses directl y offshore. Our operational plan and risk mitigation strategy wer e successful, and recovery of upper Miocene and older strata on th e Ross Sea continental shelf was successful using rotary coring methods, whereas APC coring methods also demonstrated that highquality, continuous drill core records can be obtained from the Antarctic continental slope and rise.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Our drilling plan identified a series of sites where a source-tosink sedimentary system could be mapped through the extensiv e network of seismic surveys that exist in the Ross Sea and targeted  a continental shelf-to-rise transect approach (Figure F24) that woul d allow for a detailed assessment of oceanic/ice sheet interaction s back to at least the middle Miocene (Figure F3). Critically, we located the drill sites on the outer Ross Sea continental shelf becaus e models indicate that this sector of the Antarctic is the most sensitive to oceanic heat flux during deglacial events and, conversely, i s one of the last areas of the continental shelf to become glaciate d during past glacial advance events (Figure F4). Thus, the record s from the sites provide an end-member scenario for identifying th e climatic thresholds required to achieve a fully glaciated state in Antarctica, as well as identifying oceanic triggers for glacial retrea t during past warming events. Sites U1521 and U1522 were drilled o n the outer Ross Sea continental shelf (Figure F2) and were explicitl y designed to directly identify the timing of past grounding and retreat events of marine-based ice sheets in the Ross Sea. Site U152 1 targeted a middle Miocene record to identify the processes that lea d to the expansion of large ice streams emanating from the EAI S across the western Ross Sea continental shelf and to recover a semicontinuous record of the MMCO in an ice-proximal location.  

We cored a $650\,\textrm{m}$ thick sequence of interbedded diamictite, mudstone, and diatomite strata at Site U1521 (Figure F11) with th e aim of sampling above and below seismic Unconformity RSU4. Th e depositional reconstructions obtained from these lithologies wil l provide unprecedented insight into environmental change at th e Antarctic margin during the middle Miocene. Site U1522 targeted  a Pleistocene to upper Miocene sequence from the outer shelf (Figur e F14) with the primary objective to penetrate and date Unconformity RSU3, which is interpreted to represent the first major continental shelf–wide expansion and coalescing of marine-based ic e streams from both East and West Antarctica. Recovery at Sit e U1522 was in line with expectations, and the primary objective o f dating Unconformity RSU3 was achieved. The lithology at Sit e U1522 is dominated by diamictite, and lithologic variations are subtler than at Site U1521. Lithologic variation was anticipated to b e higher at this site based on the interpretation of the seismic profiles, but thin diatom-rich mudstone and diatomite beds were recovere d in some intervals that will provide snapshot records of a deglaciate d outer shelf environment in the late Miocene. Finer grained (diatomite and mud) and unconsolidated diamict and gravel-rich bed s were possibly washed away in the coring process at both Site s U1521 and U1522. However, downhole logging operations wer e successful at both sites, allowing for a fuller assessment of lithologi c cyclicity. Outer continental shelf Site U1523 is a sediment drift located beneath the westward flowing ASC (Figure F15) and will provide a reconstruction of the changing vigor of this current throug h time. This reconstruction will enable testing of the hypothesis tha t changes in ASC vigor regulates heat flux onto the continental shelf, making the ASC a key control on ice sheet mass balance. At this site, we recovered a sequence of diatom ooze, foraminifer-rich sand, gravel, and diamict that will also provide a record of changing surface and intermediate water properties (e.g., SST, salinity, and nutrient  availability)  and  productivity  at  this  location  near  th e continental shelf break.  

At Site U1524, we cored a sedimentary sequence on the continental rise on the levee of the Hillary Canyon (Figure F18), one o f the largest conduits of AABW delivery from the Antarctic continental shelf into the abyssal ocean. We were mostly successful i n achieving our objectives at this site; it recovered a high-quality Plio– Pleistocene record (Figure F20) of turbidite activity relating t o transport of cascading water masses (e.g., AABW) down the Hillar y Canyon, providing a reconstruction of this critical component o f the global oceanic overturning circulation. These overspill turbidit e deposits are interbedded with periods of pelagic deposition that will enable proxy reconstructions of surface and bottom water properties. However, Site U1524 was intended to provide a record extending to the middle Miocene to overlap with the continental recor d obtained at Site U1521. This objective was not achieved as originally planned due to the mechanical failure that ended operations. Correlation of the Plio–Pleistocene AABW record collected at Sit e U1524 can be made to the ice sheet variability record at Site U1522, but recovery was poor in the Plio–Pleistocene interval of Sit e U1522, which makes such correlations challenging. However, previous drilling at ANDRILL Site AND-1B recovered an exceptional record of continental shelf ice sheet variance through this time (Nais h et al., 2009), and correlation to that site will allow for an unprecedented link between continental shelf processes and changin g AABW flux into the deep ocean through this time period. In addition, links to changing surface water properties and ASC vigor ca n be made through correlations to Site U1523.  

Operations at Site U1525 also cored a continental slope leve e system near the flank of the Hillary Canyon (Figure F21), but th e upper ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ was buried by the margin of a large trough-mouth fa n deposit west of the site. The site is closer to the continental shel f break and consequently is more influenced by the ASC than Sit e U1524. The lithofacies suggest an increased influence of tractio n currents relating to this current together with a higher IBRD content (Figure F23). Thus, this site may provide an important an d unique hybrid record of AABW formation, ASC current vigor, an d iceberg discharge relating to dynamic ice sheet processes on th e continental shelf. This core overlaps in time with the records obtained at Sites U1523 and U1524 and ANDRILL Site AND-1B.  

# Science objectives achieved during Expedition 374  

The discussion above provides an overview of the difficulties o f achieving all of the expedition objectives due to the mechanical failure of the vessel and early return to port. Critically, we lost the ability to develop stratigraphic ties between the continental shelf an d the deep ocean during the Miocene time period. This was a fundamental component of our science plan, which sought a continenta l shelf-to-rise transect to understand ocean–ice sheet interaction s during the warmer-than-present Neogene, with a particular focu s on the MMCO $({\sim}17{-}15\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . The successes relating to the scienc e objectives, noting this caveat and that key aspects of most objective s were not achieved as originally intended, are discussed below.  

# Evaluate the contribution of West Antarctica to farfield ice volume and sea level estimates  

Seismic Unconformities RSU4 and RSU3 were penetrated a t Sites U1521 and U1522, respectively, during Expedition 374, an d ages will be refined during postcruise analysis. The ages of these unconformities were previously very poorly constrained, and improved estimates of these ages (Figure F6) will constrain the timin g of the first expansion of the marine-based ice sheets sourced fro m the EAIS into the western and central Ross Sea (Unconformit y RSU4), as well as the first marine-based WAIS advances to the continental shelf edge (Unconformity RSU3). Models indicate tha t grounded ice sheets at these locations imply a maximum ice shee t extent on the Antarctic continent as a whole (Golledge et al 2013; Pollard and DeConto 2009). Therefore, integration with the ic e sheet retreat events from the ANDRILL records (Sites AND-1B an d AND-2A) will allow for assessment of the WAIS contribution t o Neogene sea level estimates. Lithofacies analyses at continenta l shelf Sites U1521 and U1522 combined with seismic stratigraphi c correlations will identify deposition during periods of grounded-ice, glaciomarine, and open-marine conditions. Sediment provenanc e studies at Sites U1521 and U1522 will enable understanding of th e changes in the source region of sediments and identify whether glacial transport and deposition is sourced from local ice caps or largescale ice sheet expansion (e.g., East versus West Antarctic source).  

# Reconstruct ice-proximal atmospheric and oceanic temperatures to identify past polar amplification and assess its forcings/feedbacks  

All of the records obtained during Expedition 374 are relevan t to addressing this objective, with most sites containing lithofacie s suitable for proxy-based reconstruction of past climatic and oceanographic conditions at the Antarctic margin during warmer-thanpresent climates. Diatom-rich mud and diatom ooze (diatomite) ar e present in discrete intervals at all sites, and initial microfossil analyses demonstrate the possibility for high-resolution diatom, radiolarian, and palynological studies (Figures F25, F26) to reconstruct pas t variations in SSTs, surface water stratification (related to meltwate r input and sea ice formation), and biological productivity. Calcareous foraminifers generally occur sporadically but are more abundant in some Pleistocene interglacial sequences at Sites U1523 an d U1525 (Figures F17, F23). Biogenic carbonate is more common i n middle Miocene sequences, and a diatom-rich mud and diatomit e interval at Site U1521 (Figure F11) contains abundant articulate d bivalves, providing opportunities for stable isotope, trace element, and clumped isotope analyses and the application of additional proxies for past temperature reconstructions. Biomarker proxies o f past SST change (e.g., $\mathrm{TEX}_{86},$ ) will be investigated at all sites. Pollenbased reconstructions, alongside terrestrial biomarker proxies (e.g., MBT/CBT), will allow us to determine the extent of atmospheri c polar amplification during these time periods and to track the resulting terrestrial runoff during the warmer climates of the Pliocen e and Miocene.  

# Assess the role of oceanic forcing on WAIS stability/instability  

ANDRILL Sites AND-1B and AND-2A provided compelling evidence of a smaller-than-present WAIS during the MMCO, th e warm Pliocene, and early Pleistocene climates, likely as a consequence of wind-driven upwelling of warm CDW onto the continental shelf (Naish et al., 2009; Pollard and DeConto, 2009; Levy et al., 2016). Expedition 374 aimed to test this hypothesis by obtainin g new records of ice sheet extent from outer continental shelf Site s U1521 and U1522 to complement and expand on the ANDRILL record, as well as provide a record of changing ocean current vigo r and water masses near the continental shelf break (e.g., Site U1523 ) and the uppermost continental rise (e.g., Sites U1524 and U1525). At the sites most proximal to the continental shelf break (Site s U1523 and U1525), paleocurrent strength associated with change s in the westerly flowing ASC will be reconstructed by examining th e sedimentologic (e.g., facies analysis and grain size) characteristic s and magnetic fabrics.  

Micropaleontological, geochemical, and sedimentologic studie s from these drill cores will provide reconstructions of changing regional surface conditions that are relevant to water mass exchang e between  the  Southern  Ocean  and  the  Ross  Sea  continental shelf/WAIS (e.g., sea ice, surface stratification, SSTs, polynya mixing, glacial meltwater discharge, nutrient uptake, and supercoolin g of dense water by ice shelves). Downslope currents resulting fro m the transfer of RSBW into the abyssal ocean (e.g., AABW formation) can also be assessed (and distinguished from ASC flow) by integrated facies analysis, geochemistry, and micropaleontology a t Sites U1523–U1525. Foraminifer-rich/bearing beds occur in several intervals at both Sites U1523 and U1525 and hold promise for stabl e isotope and trace element analysis to reconstruct past water mas s and temperature variations at these sites.  

# Identify the sensitivity of WAIS to Earth’s orbital configuration under a variety of climate boundary conditions  

Fundamental questions remain about the orbital pacing of AI S variability. In particular, records obtained from Expedition 37 4 should shed light on whether orbitally paced AIS variations respon d to local insolation forcing or were regulated by interhemispheri c teleconnections associated with low-latitude or high–northern latitude insolation forcings. Sedimentologic analyses (complemente d by downhole logs) will enable development of a direct record of orbital-scale ice sheet advance and retreat events across the continental shelf at Sites U1521 and U1522. The turbidite levee deposits a t continental rise and slope Sites U1524 and U1525 are believed to b e the consequence of water masses cascading down the Hillary Canyon (Figure F5). As such, these deposits are anticipated to provide  a record of changes in AABW production and delivery of sediment t o the continental shelf via ice sheet advance through time. These ca n then be directly related to changing ice sheet and sea ice extent o n the Ross Sea continental shelf and tied to far-field records. Superimposed on this AABW signal will be an orbital-scale IBRD record, together with ASC vigor, that will link these changes in AABW t o shifting ice dynamics along the Pacific Ocean margin of the WAIS.  

# Reconstruct eastern Ross Sea bathymetry to examine relationships between seafloor geometry, ice sheet stability/instability, and global climate  

The modern-day bathymetry of the Ross Sea is characterized b y an overdeepened continental shelf that makes the WAIS vulnerabl e to marine ice sheet instability. With this bathymetric configuration, once an ice sheet retreat event is triggered by a climatic warming, the grounding line retreats into increasingly deeper water, resultin g in increased flux of ice discharging into the ocean (and melting ) (Weertman, 1974; Thomas and Bentley, 1978). This increased flu x leads to a runaway retreat process, even if there is no further climat e forcing. Consequently, the transition from a terrestrial- or shallo w marine–based West Antarctica with a seaward-dipping shallo w continental shelf to that of the modern overdeepened (i.e., landwar d dipping) continental shelf has a first-order control on the sensitivit y of the AIS to external climate and oceanic boundary condition s (Wilson et al., 2013; Gasson et al., 2016). The timing of Ross Se a shelf overdeepening is poorly constrained, and the location of Expedition 374 sites was selected to help improve the age constraints o n the key unconformities relating to this event. The sites should als o provide important reconstructions of the depositional environmen t (e.g., water depth) relevant to the paleobathymetry at the time o f formation of seismic Unconformities RSU4, RSU3, and RSU2 (Figure F6) at Sites U1521 and U1522. These three unconformities document fundamental shifts in the eastern Ross Sea relating to erosio n by advancing ice streams across a relatively shallow continenta l shelf from East Antarctica (Unconformity RSU4), West Antarctic a (Unconformity RSU3), and the transition toward an overdeepene d continental shelf by Unconformity RSU2 time. All three of these unconformities were penetrated on the continental shelf during Expedition 374, greatly reducing the uncertainties regarding their ages.  

# Additional expedition highlights and contributions  

Numerous campaigns have been conducted to drill the Antarctic margin over the past five decades. Despite these efforts, the region still remains understudied with respect to the deep biospher e and the hydrological system. To address this shortcoming, dedicated mudline APC cores were collected at Sites U1523 and U152 4 for high-resolution microbiological and interstitial water sampling. Microbiology sampling allows the first characterization of the vertical distribution of microbial flora in the deep biosphere of the Ros s Sea. Additional metagenomics analyses of high-resolution subsamples provide information on the biodiversity of bacteria, methanogens,  and  fungi.  Furthermore,  biogeochemical  and  molecula r studies enable us to explore the metabolism and activities of deepbiosphere communities. Interstitial water and sediment profiles ca n elucidate biogeochemical cycling of elements and isotopes. Bein g able to do so at high resolution in the uppermost part of the sediment column is unprecedented on the Ross Sea shelf and slope an d provides unique insights into early diagenetic processes and redo x profiles.  

# Operations  

Expedition 374 began with the first line ashore at Berth 2 i n Lyttelton, New Zealand, at $0706\mathrm{~h~}$ (all times are local ship time; UTC $+\,13\,\mathrm{h}$ ) on 4 January 2018. After clearing immigration and customs, the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) technical staff, Co-Chief Scientists, and Expedition Project Manager boarde d the vessel. The Expedition 372 science party moved off the vessel, and after a $5\;\mathrm{{h}}$ crossover, the Expedition 372 JRSO technical staf f departed the vessel. After conducting a press conference, holdin g VIP and media tours, and loading IODP and Siem airfreight an d some critical ocean freight, the vessel shifted from Berth 2 to Bert h 7 to begin the remainder of port call operations. The following day, the Expedition 374 science party came on board, and the Siem Offshore crew change was completed. Local university faculty, staff, and students were given tours of the vessel. Most of the Schlumberger logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools were off-loaded, and bul k loading operations began. We also received 41 short tons of barit e and 135 short tons of sepiolite. On the third day of port call, the af t core line was removed in preparation for installing new coring line. Frozen food and dry stores were loaded, and the remaining Schlumberger LWD tools were off-loaded. After completing loading operations on 6 January, the vessel was shifted from Berth 7 to the Oil Berth for fueling. The last mooring line was released at $1735\,\mathrm{h},$ an d the first line ashore at the Oil Berth was secured at $1750~\mathrm{h}$ , endin g the very short passage.  

After loading 640 metric tons of fuel oil, fuel operations were secured. At 0812 h on 7 January, the last line was released for th e move back to Berth 7. The first line was secured at $0827\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , endin g the brief transit. Loading operations resumed, and during the day, fresh fruit and vegetables were loaded, the FMS tool was repaire d and tested, and Polar Code training for the science party and technicians was completed. On 8 January, the final day of our 4.4 day por t call, the vessel was inspected and issued a Polar Code certificate, all remaining trash was discharged, the last remaining items of freigh t were loaded or discharged, and immigration cleared the vessel fo r departure. After the vessel was secured for the sea passage to Antarctica, the harbor pilot came on board at $1552\,\mathrm{h}$ , and two port tug s arrived to assist with departure. The mooring lines were release d and pulled back on board, with the last line released at $1624\,\mathrm{h}$ . Th e vessel proceeded to the pilot station, and the pilot departed the vessel at $1648\,\mathrm{h}$ after a $2\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit. The vessel began its sea passage a t $1648\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 January.  

# Transit to Site U1521  

The R/V JOIDES Resolution met the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer at $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 January 2018. The Nathaniel B. Palmer acted as a n escort through the sea ice into the Ross Sea polynya. At $1220\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 15 January, the JOIDES Resolution cleared the southern edge of th e sea ice and the Nathaniel B. Palmer was released from escort duty a t $1300~\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel arrived at Site U1521 at $0954~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 Januar y after a $2014\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Lyttelton that averaged $10.8~\mathrm{kt}$ . Th e vessel switched to dynamic positioning at $0938\,\mathrm{h},$ , and the thruster s were lowered and secured. At $0957\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the drill floor was cleared fo r operations, beginning Hole U1521A. At $1019\,\mathrm{h}$ , an acoustic beaco n was deployed.  

# Site U1521  

Site U1521 consisted of Hole U1521A, which was cored to 650. 1 m DSF using the RCB coring system. Hole U1521A was logged wit h the triple combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI tool strings. Operations a t Site U1521 concluded at $2245~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 January. A total of $132.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (5.5 days) were spent at Site U1521. A total of 71 cores were recorded for the site. RCB coring in Hole U1521A penetrated to 650. 1 m DSF, recovering $411.50\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(63\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Hole U1521A  

Initial operations consisted of picking up and assembling th e RCB BHA and then deploying the drill string to $143.81\mathrm{~m~}$ drillin g depth below rig floor (DRF). During deployment, the drill pipe wa s drifted (checked to ensure that the interior was clear) and strappe d (measured). The nonmagnetic core barrels were spaced out after assembling the outer core barrel. The top drive was picked up an d spaced out, and a wiper pig was inserted into the drill string. Th e wiper pig was pumped through the drill string with 2 times the annular volume of the drill string to clean any loose rust or debris fro m the inside of the drill string. The calculated precision depth recorder (PDR) depth for the site was $573.4\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF. The core barrel s were dressed with liners, and a core barrel was deployed.  

The drill string was spaced out to spud and lowered slowly to ta g the seafloor. Hole U1521A was started at $1845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 January 2018. The mudline core recovered $4.28\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment, and the seafloo r tag was measured at $573.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF (562.2 meters below sea leve l [mbsl]). RCB coring continued through Core 374-U1521A-37 R $352.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF). Because of reduced recovery over the previou s cores, we proceeded to cut half cores ( $\leftrightharpoons.8\:\mathrm{m}\rightleftharpoons\left.1\rightleftharpoons\left.\!\!\mathrm{~m}$ advance instead of 9. 6 m advance) from Core 38R through 43R ( $352.5{-}381.3\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF) t o improve core recovery. Coring with full $9.6~\mathrm{m}$ advances continue d from Core 44R through 71R ( $381.3–650.1\mathrm{~m~i~}$ DSF), at which poin t coring was terminated when the science objectives were met. Highviscosity mud sweeps $(30\,\mathrm{{bbl})}$ were pumped every two to four core s from Core 13R through 68R ( $113.0{-}611.7\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{D}\mathrm{S}$ SF).  

To prepare for downhole logging after terminating coring i n Hole U1521A, the hole was cleaned with a 40 bbl high-viscosit y mud sweep. The rotary shifting tool (RST) was run in the hole o n the coring line, releasing the RCB C-4 coring bit at $1505~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 0 January. The RST was then run to reposition the bit shifting sleev e back to the circulating position in the mechanical bit release (MBR). After shifting the sleeve in the MBR, the RST was pulled back to th e surface, and the sinker bars were removed from the drill string. Th e hole was displaced with 217 bbl of $10.5~\mathrm{lb/gal}$ mud from $650.1\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF to the seafloor. The top drive was set back, and the drill strin g was pulled back to logging depth ( $54.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF). After positionin g the end of the pipe with knobbies through the guide horn, the circulating head was attached, and the hole was top-displaced to the seafloor with $20~\mathrm{bbl}$ of 10.5 lb/gal mud. The rig floor was then rigge d up for logging.  

A triple combo tool string was assembled with the MSS, HighResolution Laterolog Array (HRLA; to measure resistivity), HLD S (with source), Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sond e (HNGS), and the Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC). The tools were assembled and tested and then lowered into the hol e at $2325\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 20 January. The active heave compensator wa s switched on when the tools reached the open hole. A downlog wa s performed from just above the seafloor to the total hole depth o f  

$648~\mathrm{m}$ WSF. The hole was then logged up for a $126.5~\mathrm{m}$ calibratio n pass. The triple combo tool string was lowered back to bottom (64 8 m WSF), and the hole was logged up. Before reaching the end of th e drill pipe at $54.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, the drill pipe was raised to $38.2~\mathrm{m}$ DSF t o provide additional log coverage of the upper part of the borehol e before the caliper was closed and the tool string entered the pipe. The tools were pulled from the hole and were back at the surface a t $0330~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 January. By $0430\;\mathrm{h},$ , the triple combo tool string wa s rigged down.  

The FMS-sonic tool string was assembled with the FMS, DSI , HNGS, and EDTC. The FMS-sonic tool string was deployed at 062 0 h. The tool string was lowered into the drill pipe, and a downlo g with the FMS calipers closed began at $54.4\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{WSF}$ . NGR was logge d from above the seafloor to depth-match to the seafloor from th e first logging run with the triple combo tool string. The tool strin g reached the bottom of the hole at $648\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. The hole was logge d up from 648 to $103\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ with the FMS calipers open. The calipers were then closed, and the tool string was lowered back to 64 8 m WSF. A second uplog was performed, and as the tool string approached the end of the drill string, it was again raised to ${\sim}38\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF to gain log coverage over the upper part of the borehole. Th e FMS calipers were closed just prior to entering the drill pipe. Th e FMS-sonic tool string was rigged down by $1245\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The VSI tool string for a VSP experiment consisted of the VS I and EDTC. The VSI tool string was assembled, tested, and deploye d at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ . While lowering the tool string in the hole, the protecte d species watch was initiated, and the seismic source (two $250~\mathrm{inch^{3}}$ Sercel G guns in parallel cluster) was lowered into the water an d fired with increasing intensity per the guidelines for a “soft start. ” The VSI tool string was lowered to $648\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ for the first statio n test. The caliper was opened, and 17 stations were analyzed wit h good results. At $1755\,\mathrm{h}$ , the last station was completed, and the seismic source was secured. The logging tool string was at the rig floo r at $1835~\mathrm{h},$ and by $1930~\mathrm{h}$ all Schlumberger logging equipment wa s rigged down.  

The drilling crew then began to secure the drilling equipmen t for transit. After laying out the knobbies, the drill string was pulle d back to the rig floor, clearing the seafloor at $2020~\mathrm{h}$ . The acousti c beacon was released during the pipe trip and recovered on deck a t $2105~\mathrm{h}$ . The rest of the pipe was pulled to the rig floor, three drill collar stands were racked back in the derrick, and the outer cor e barrel was disassembled and inspected. The rig floor was secure d for transit at $2245\ \mathrm{h}$ on 21 January, ending Hole U1521A and Sit e U1521. A total of $132.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (5.5 days) were spent at Site U1521.  

# Transit to Site U1522  

The $88\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1522 was completed in $8.2\,\mathrm{h}$ averaging $10.7\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The vessel arrived at Site U1522 at $0629\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 Januar y 2018. The thrusters were lowered and secured at $0654~\mathrm{h}$ , clearin g the drill floor for operations. We deployed the acoustic positionin g beacon at $^{0720}\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Site U1522  

The original operations plan for Site U1522 consisted of a singl e RCB hole to $545\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF; however, after requesting and receiving approval from the EPSP and Texas A&M Safety Panel, we ultimatel y cored Hole U1522A to $701.8~\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF (Cores 374-U1522A-1 R through 76R). At the end of coring operations, the hole was logge d with three tool strings: a modified triple combo, the VSI, and th e FMS. Operations at Site U1522 concluded at $1311\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 Januar y 2018. A total of $149.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (6.2 days) were spent at Site U1522. RC B coring in Hole U1522A penetrated to $701.8~\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovere d $279.57\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(40\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Hole U1522A  

The RCB BHA was assembled and lowered toward the seafloo r to $143.82\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF before the top drive was picked up and spaced ou t and a RCB core barrel was deployed. The calculated PDR depth fo r the site was $567.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF; however, the final seafloor depth wa s measured at $568.5\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF $(557.6~\mathrm{mbsl})$ based on the seafloor ta g depth obtained while starting the hole. Hole U1522A was started a t $1115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 January 2018, and the mudline core (374-U1522A-1R ) recovered $2.89\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. RCB coring continued through Cor e 35R ( $337.6\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF). We then switched to cutting half-length core s ( $4.8~\mathrm{m}$ advance instead of $9.6~\mathrm{m}$ advance) in an attempt to improv e core recovery. After poor recovery in Core 36R $(9\%)$ , this strateg y worked for Cores 37R and 38R $70\%$ recovery). However, thes e cores were followed by almost no recovery in Cores 39R throug h 41R. We then switched back to full $9.6\textrm{m}$ advances for Core 42 R with negligible core recovery until Core 45R. Coring continued to  a total depth of $701.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF (Core 76R), where science objective s were met.  

While coring, 30 bbl of high-viscosity mud were pumped ever y two to four cores between 145.2 and $501.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Because of deteriorating hole conditions, 90 bbl of high-viscosity mud wer e pumped at $520.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Below $549.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, mud was circulated o n each core to try to improve hole cleaning and reduce the off-botto m torque. After terminating coring in Hole U1522A, the hole wa s cleaned with two 50 bbl high-viscosity mud sweeps followed by  a third high-viscosity sweep in an effort to improve hole condition s for downhole logging. The RST was lowered into the hole on th e coring line to release the RCB bit at $0645~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 January. Severa l slugs of heavy mud were pumped to offset the high pressure in th e annulus. The RST was then run again to reposition the bit shiftin g sleeve back to the circulating position in the MBR. After shifting th e sleeve, the RST was pulled back to the surface, and the sinker bar s were removed from the drill string. The end of the drill string wa s raised to $583.9\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF with the top drive installed because of th e poor hole conditions. After a decrease in torque, the hole was displaced with $190\,\mathrm{bbl}$ of $10.5\,\mathrm{lb}$ /gal mud from $583.9\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF to the seafloor. The top drive was set back, and the end of the drill string wa s pulled up to a logging depth of $91.3\textrm{m}$ DSF while monitoring fo r drag. After positioning the end of pipe, the circulating head was attached, and the hole was top-displaced to the seafloor with 20 bbl o f 10.5 lb/gal mud. The rig floor was then prepared for downhole logging.  

A modified triple combo tool string was assembled with th e MSS, HRLA, DSI, HLDS (without source), HNGS, and EDTC. Th e tools were tested and lowered into the drill string at $1630~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 7 January. The average heave was estimated to be $0.3\textrm{m}$ just prior t o logging. The wireline active heave compensator was turned on onc e the tools reached open hole. A downlog was performed from jus t above seafloor to $650.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the bottom of th e hole). The hole was then logged up with a $143~\mathrm{m}$ calibration pass, run back to bottom $\mathrm{{650.3\;m\;WSF)}}$ , and logged up to the end of th e drill pipe at $91.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Before reaching the end of pipe at $91.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, the drill string was raised $15~\mathrm{m}$ to $76.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF to increase lo g coverage of the borehole. The caliper was closed prior to the too l string being pulled into the end of the drill pipe. The tool string wa s back on the rig floor at $2035\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 January, and by $2200\,\mathrm{h}$ the triple combo tool string was disassembled.  

The VSI tool string was assembled with the VSI and EDTC. After the VSI tool string was tested, it was run into the pipe at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ and lowered to $194.5\mathrm{~m~WSF},$ where it was unable to pass a narro w area in the borehole. We retrieved the VSI tool string to the rig floo r at $0025\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 January and added a HNGS to the tool string to increase the weight. The VSI tool string was lowered into the drill string at $0055~\mathrm{h}$ and again encountered the bridge at $203.5\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ ; however, after working the tool string with the added weight up an d down for $30\,\mathrm{\min}$ , the tool string passed the bridge and reache d $297.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ before encountering another bridge that could not b e passed. Protected species observation began while lowering the tool string in the hole. The seismic source was then deployed, and a sof t start was initiated. Eight stations were selected and tested, eac h yielding good results. Several shutdowns occurred during the logging run when marine mammals (whales and seals) entered the exclusion zone during the VSP experiment. At $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 January, the last station was completed and the seismic source secured. Th e VSI tool string returned to the rig floor at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ and was secure d by $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The third logging tool string used in Hole U1522A was the FMS , which contained the FMS, HNGS, and EDTC. The FMS tool strin g was lowered into the hole at $0730~\mathrm{h}$ . NGR was logged from jus t above the seafloor while lowering the tool to depth-match the seafloor to the triple combo tool string run. The FMS tool strin g reached $193.5\mathrm{~m~WSF}_{}$ , and the first upward pass collected data wit h the FMS calipers open from 193.5 to $101.5~\mathrm{m}$ WSF. The tool strin g was lowered back to $193.5\mathrm{~m~WSF},$ and a second upward pass wa s collected. The end of the pipe was raised to $86.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF as the FM S tool approached to increase log coverage of the borehole. Afte r completing the uplog, the calipers were closed, and the tool strin g was returned to the rig floor. All logging equipment was disassembled by $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 January.  

We then retrieved the drill string back to the rig floor. Th e acoustic beacon was released while raising the drill string and wa s recovered to the deck at $1213\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . Three drill collar stands wer e racked in the derrick, and the outer core barrel was disassemble d and inspected. The rig floor was secured for transit at $1311\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 8 January, ending Hole U1522A and Site U1522.  

# Transit to Site U1523  

The $148\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1523 was completed in $12.9\,\mathrm{h}$ at a n average speed of $11.5\;\mathrm{kt}$ . The vessel arrived at Site U1523 at $0158\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 January 2018. The thrusters were lowered and secured at 021 8 h, clearing the drill floor for operations. The acoustic positionin g beacon was deployed at $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ after completing a seafloor survey.  

# Site U1523  

Site U1523 is an alternate site that was occupied after coring a t Site U1522 demonstrated that core recovery would likely be poor i n the targeted upper interval of the original proposed primary Sit e EBOCS-04B. We cored five holes at Site U1523 because difficul t coring conditions required additional holes to achieve the objectives. Prior to coring, we conducted a seafloor camera survey to ensure we could avoid large rocks on the seafloor. The survey include d tagging the seafloor at four potential hole locations. Hole U1523 A was cored with a combination of the APC and HLAPC coring systems to $46.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Hole U1523B was cored using the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems to a final depth of $164.4\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Hol e U1523C was intended to use the HLAPC to target specific stratigraphic gaps not recovered in Holes U1523A and U1523B; however, Hole U1523C was drilled without coring to $43.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, where w e had to abandon it due to loss of circulation. Hole U1523D wa s drilled without coring from the seafloor to $135.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF, and the n RCB coring penetrated to a final depth of $307.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Hol e U1523D was then logged with two tool strings: a modified tripl e combo and the FMS. Hole U1523E was spot cored to $130.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DS F using the APC and HLAPC systems to cover stratigraphic gaps fro m Holes U1523A and U1523B. A total of $147.5\,\mathrm{~h~}$ (6.15 days) wer e spent at Site U1523.  

We collected a total of 64 cores at Site U1523. The APC syste m was deployed 5 times, recovering $41.57\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment $(91\%)$ . Th e HLAPC system was used 33 times, collecting $87.99\mathrm{~m~}$ $(59\%)$ . Th e XCB system collected $3.16\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(5\%)$ over 8 cores. The RC B system was deployed 18 times over $172.8\;\mathrm{m},$ recovering $0.9\textnormal{m}(0.5\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Hole U1523A  

Operations  for  Hole  U1523A  began  with  assembling  a n APC/XCB BHA and then lowering the drill string toward the seafloor. Because of uncertain seafloor conditions, we decided to survey the seafloor prior to starting the first hole. After the drill strin g reached $599.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF, we pulled the upper guide horn to deploy th e subsea camera for the seafloor survey to look for large rocks in th e vicinity of the potential hole locations. While lowering the subse a camera, we also continued to lower the drill string. Because this sit e is in deeper water than the two previous sites (PDR depth of $837~\mathrm{m}$ DRF), some additional drill pipe had to be drifted and strapped as i t was deployed. We picked up the top drive and prepared a nonmagnetic APC core barrel before conducting the seafloor survey, whic h included tagging the seafloor at four potential hole positions. All ta g depths were $839\,\mathrm{m}$ DRF $^{828\;\mathrm{mbsl})}$ ). An acoustic positioning beaco n was deployed at $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ after completing the survey. The vessel wa s moved back to the first tag location, and we left the subsea camer a down to observe the core barrel being shot into the seafloor to star t Hole U1523A.  

After installing the sinker bars and orientation tool, the firs t APC core barrel was lowered into the drill string with the drill bit a t $838.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF ( $^{1\textrm{m}}$ above the seafloor tag depth). Hole U1523A wa s started at $1050~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 January 2018. The mudline core recovere d $8.51\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment. We continued to core with the APC syste m with nonmagnetic core barrels and orientation through Core 374- U1523A-3H $\!\!\,0\!-\!\!25.2\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF). Because Core 3H was a partial stroke, we switched to the HLAPC system and continued coring throug h Core 7F $^\mathrm{46.3~m}$ DSF). While drilling out the cored interval, backflow of sand/gravel/stones into the BHA blocked the drill string. Because we were unable to land a core barrel or circulate, w e abandoned Hole U1523A. We pulled the drill string out of the hol e and attempted to clear the BHA while it was above the seafloor. W e then dropped an XCB core barrel with a deplugger; this attempt t o clear the BHA also failed. After the XCB core barrel was retrieved, the drill string was pulled up to the rig floor, and the BHA was disassembled and cleaned of debris. The lockable float valve was damaged either by debris or the XCB core barrel. The bit cleared th e rotary table at $0450\ \mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1523A. Total time spent i n Hole U1523A was $26.5~\mathrm{h}$ (1.1 days).  

The APC system was deployed three times, recovering $23.22\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $27.5~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(84\%)$ . The HLAPC system was deployed four times, collecting $10.29\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $18.8~\mathrm{m}$ of corin g $(55\%)$ . Total core recovered for the hole was $33.51\;\mathrm{m}\;(72\%)$ .  

# Hole U1523B  

After clearing out the BHA, the outer core barrel was reassembled, and the drill string was lowered toward the seafloor. The vessel was positioned $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1523A. After picking up the to p drive, the drill bit was positioned at $838\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF ( $1\;\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor) to start Hole U1523B. A nonmagnetic APC core barrel wa s deployed, and Hole U1523B was started at $1100~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 Januar y 2018. Core 374-U1523B-1H recovered $8.49\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. We the n dropped an XCB center bit and advanced the hole without coring t o $46.7~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. A hard layer was observed at $45.9~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. After recovering the XCB center bit, we deployed a HLAPC core barrel. Corin g continued from Core 3F through Core 13F $46.7{-}93.8\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF). W e pumped 20 or 30 bbl mud sweeps every few cores to maintain goo d hole conditions. Core 13F was a partial stroke, so we switched to th e XCB coring system. Cores 14X through 16X penetrated from 93. 8 to $103.3\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF with almost no recovery. Because Core 16X onl y advanced $0.1\;\mathrm{m},$ we dropped a center bit and drilled ahead withou t coring for $5.0\ \mathrm{m}$ to try to advance past a very hard layer. We the n resumed XCB coring and cut Cores 18X and 19X ( $108.3–127.5\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF), again with minimal recovery $(3\%)$ . Because drilling parameters suggested we had successfully passed the hard layers, w e switched back to the HLAPC coring system for Cores 20F and 21 F $127.5{-}135.6\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF). We had to drill over Core 21F to release i t from the formation because of excessive overpull, so we switche d back to the XCB system. We cut Cores 22X through 24X (135.6– $164.4\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{DSF}$ ) with minimal recovery $(9\%)$ . We terminated coring a t $164.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF in Hole U1523B because of unstable hole condition s causing excessive torque. In addition, core liners used with the XC B system shattered at a high rate $(63\%)$ , causing significant core disturbance. We pumped a 30 bbl mud sweep and pulled the drill string clear of the seafloor, ending Hole U1523B at $2120\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 January. Total time spent in Hole U1523B was $37.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.5 days).  

A single APC core recovered $8.49\,\mathrm{~m~}$ over an $^{8.5\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ advanc e $(100\%)$ . The HLAPC system was deployed 13 times, recoverin g $33.48\mathrm{~m~}$ over $55.2~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(61\%)$ . The XCB was deployed eigh t times, collecting $3.16~\mathrm{m}$ over $57.5~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(5\%)$ . Total recover y for Hole U1523B was $45.13\;\mathrm{m}$ $(37\%)$ ).  

# Hole U1523C  

After clearing the seafloor, the vessel was repositioned $20\,\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1523B. Hole U1523C was planned to selectivel y core intervals of poor recovery with the HLAPC while avoidin g hard layers encountered in previous holes. We dropped a center bi t in preparation to start Hole U1523C and noticed high pump pressures that indicated clogged jets in the drill bit. After attempting t o clear the jets, we started Hole U1523C at $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 January 201 8 and drilled ahead without coring to $43.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, where we lost circulation through the drill string, forcing us to abandon Hol e U1523C. The bit cleared the seafloor at $2120~\mathrm{h}$ and was retrieve d back to the rig floor at $_{0130\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 1 February, ending Hole U1523C. Total time spent in Hole U1523C was $7.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (0.3 days).  

# Hole U1523D  

We then decided to switch to the RCB coring system to core an d log a deeper hole, with the intention of coring a final APC/HLAP C hole if time permitted after logging. The RCB BHA was assemble d and lowered toward the seafloor. After picking up the top drive, w e prepared a core barrel with a center bit. Hole U1523D was started a t $0725\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 February 2018. The hole was advanced to $135.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DS F without coring. We pumped a 30 bbl high-viscosity mud sweep an d retrieved the center bit. RCB coring continued from Core 374-  

U1523D-2R through 19R $135.0{-}307.8\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF) with very poor recovery $(0.90~\mathrm{\m};~0.5\%)$ . We pumped 30 bbl high-viscosity mu d sweeps every two to three cores to clear cuttings. We terminate d coring after reaching our minimum target depth of ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF an d prepared the hole for downhole logging by circulating two 50 bb l high-viscosity mud sweeps to improve hole conditions. The RS T was lowered on the coring line to release the RCB bit in the botto m of the hole at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February. After running the RST a secon d time to shift the sleeve in the MBR back to the circulating position, we displaced the hole with $94~\mathrm{bbl}$ of $10.5\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ mud from $307.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF to the seafloor. We then pulled the drill string to $258.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, set back the top drive, and continued to pull the drill string up to  a logging depth of $82.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. After displacing the upper part of th e hole with 20 bbl of $10.5\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ mud, the drill floor was prepared fo r downhole logging operations at $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February.  

The first logging run consisted of a modified triple combo too l string assembled with the MSS, DSI, HRLA, HLDS (withou t source), HNGS, and EDTC. The triple combo tool string was lowered into the drill string at $1320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February. The average heav e was estimated to be $_{0.3\textrm{m}}$ just prior to logging. The active heav e compensator was switched on when the tools reached open hole.  A downlog was performed from just above seafloor to $292\textrm{m}$ WSF, with the tool string reaching to within $15~\mathrm{m}$ of the bottom of th e hole. The hole was then logged up with a $136\mathrm{~m~}$ calibration pass. The tool string was lowered back to the bottom $\langle288\mathrm{~m~WSF}\rangle$ an d then logged up. When the tool string neared the end of the pipe, i t was raised to $67\,\textrm{m}$ DSF to provide additional log coverage of th e borehole. The tools were back at the surface at $1630~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February, and the triple combo tool string was disassembled by $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The second logging run was with the FMS tool string, which wa s assembled with the FMS, HNGS, and EDTC. The FMS tool strin g was lowered into the hole at $1820~\mathrm{h}$ . NGR was logged from abov e the seafloor as the tool string was lowered to depth-match results t o the first logging run. The FMS tool string reached a total depth o f $289.6\ \mathrm{m}$ WSF. Two upward passes were logged with the FMS too l string. During the second uplog, the end of the pipe was raised to 6 7 m DSF to provide additional coverage of the borehole. The FM S tool string was returned to the rig floor at $2130~\mathrm{h},$ and all loggin g equipment was disassembled by $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February. We then began to raise the drill string back toward the rig floor, clearing th e seafloor at $2315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February. After placing three stands of drill collars in the derrick, the outer core barrel was disassembled an d inspected. The end of the drill string cleared the rotary table at 024 0 h on 3 February, ending Hole U1523D. Total time spent in Hol e U1523D was $49.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.1 days), with $0.90\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered ove r $172.8\;\mathrm{m}$ of RCB coring $(0.5\%)$ .  

# Hole U1523E  

We switched back to the APC/XCB coring system to targe t poorly recovered intervals from Holes U1523A and U1523B. Th e drill string was lowered toward the seafloor, and the bit was set a t $830\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF for the first core. Hole U1523E was started at $0810\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 3 February 2018, and Core 374-U1523E-1H recovered a full barre l $\left(9.86\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ . We drilled ahead $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ without coring and then switche d to the HLAPC coring system and proceeded with spot coring. Ove r the upper ${\sim}90\ \mathrm{m},$ spot coring consisted of collecting one to thre e HLAPC cores followed by a $2.8{-}12.3\,\mathrm{m}$ drill-ahead interval. Depth s were chosen to avoid gravel encountered in Holes U1523A an d U1523B. Deeper than ${\sim}90\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , the coring plan included dropping  a center bit to drill through hard layers encountered between 93 an d 95, 104 and 108, and 116 and $117~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, with HLAPC cores collected in between. This technique proved particularly successful fo r the interval deeper than ${100}\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF, allowing us to fill in substantial gaps in the stratigraphy. The last core (25F) in Hole U1523E arrive d on deck at $2350\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 3 February. After pumping a 30 bbl mu d sweep, we left the top drive installed while pulling the drill strin g out of the hole because of unstable hole conditions causing excessive torque and overpull. After clearing the seafloor at $0150~\mathrm{h}$ on  4 February, the top drive was set back and the drill string was retrieved to the vessel. The acoustic beacon was released and recovered at $0450\ \mathrm{h},$ and the rig floor was secured at $0547\,\mathrm{~h},$ endin g operations in Hole U1523E and Site U1523.  

A single APC core collected $9.86\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of corin g $(104\%)$ . The HLAPC was deployed 16 times, recovering $44.22\;\mathrm{m}$ o f core over $75.2~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(59\%)$ . Total recovery for Hole U1523 E was $54.08\mathrm{~m~}(64\%)$ .  

# Transit to Site U1524  

The $52\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1524 was completed in $4.7~\mathrm{h}$ at a n average speed of $11.1\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The vessel arrived at Site U1524 at $1027\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 February 2018. The thrusters were lowered and secured a t $1044\,\mathrm{h}$ , clearing the drill floor for operations. The acoustic positioning beacon was deployed at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Site U1524  

Site U1524 is an alternate for proposed primary Site RSCR-02B . We decided to occupy the alternate site because the highest priorit y target is shallower, the seismic facies show less evidence for transported sediment, and the sea ice edge was farther away. We core d three holes at Site U1524. Hole U1524A was cored with th e APC/XCB system to $299.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Hole U1524B consisted of a single mudline core collected for high-resolution sampling. Afte r briefly abandoning the site because of encroaching sea ice, we returned and cored Hole U1524C with the RCB system to $441.9\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Total time spent at Site U1524 was $117.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (4.9 days).  

We collected a total of 54 cores at Site U1524. The APC syste m was deployed 31 times, collecting $284.17\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(102\%)$ . Th e HLAPC system was deployed once, recovering $0.43\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of cor e $(108\%)$ . The XCB system collected $5.51\textrm{m}$ over three cores $(19\%)$ . The RCB system was used 19 times, collecting $19.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(11\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Hole U1524A  

Operations in Hole U1524A began by picking up an APC/XC B BHA and lowering it toward the seafloor. Because this site is i n deeper water than the previous sites, some of the drill pipe wa s drifted and strapped while being deployed. After positioning th e drill string with the bit at $2400~\mathrm{m}$ DRF based on the PDR depth fo r the site, we installed the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool with th e sinker bars. We then deployed a nonmagnetic APC core barrel an d started Hole U1524A at $2025\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 4 February 2018. Core 374- U1524A-1H recovered $4.02\,\mathrm{m}$ of core, indicating a seafloor depth o f $2394\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ .  

Oriented APC coring continued through Core 30H $\,\!270.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF). Downhole formation temperatures were taken on Cores 6 H ( $51.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF}$ ), 9H ( $80.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF), 12H $108.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF}$ ), and 15H (13 7 m DSF) using the APCT-3. After Core 30H recorded a partial stroke, indicating piston core refusal, we removed the Icefield MI- 5 core orientation tool and switched to the HLAPC system to collec t Core 31F. This core also recorded a partial stroke and recovere d only $0.4\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. We then switched to the XCB coring syste m and cut Cores 32X through 34X to $299.5\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF; all XCB core liner s were shattered upon recovery, resulting in highly disturbed sediment. We suspect that the XCB liners were shattering at a high rat e due to extremely cold seawater $\left(-1.5^{\circ}\right)^{\left(\right.}$ to $-2.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ ) coupled with th e small gap between the core liner and core barrel that allows for vibration. After collecting Core $34\mathrm{X}$ , we had to terminate coring an d pull out of the hole because of approaching sea ice. After pulling th e bit up to $249.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, we set back the top drive and continued t o pull out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0950~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 Februar y and ending Hole U1524A. We attempted to retrieve the acoustic positioning beacon while pulling out of the hole, but the beacon woul d not release. Total time spent in Hole U1524A was $47.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.0 days).  

Overall recovery in Hole U1524A was $282.35\;\mathrm{m}$ $(94\%)$ . The AP C coring system was deployed 30 times, recovering $276.41\mathrm{~m~}$ of cor e over $270.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(102\%)$ . The HLAPC coring system was deployed once, recovering $0.43\:\mathrm{m}$ of core over a $0.4\,\mathrm{m}$ advance $(108\%)$ . The XCB coring system was deployed three times, recovering 5.5 1 m of core over $28.8~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(19\%)$ .  

# Hole U1524B  

With ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{h}$ of time left before the arrival of sea ice, we decide d to collect a single mudline core for high-resolution interstitial wate r and microbiological studies. We moved the vessel $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hol e U1524A and started Hole U1524B at $1155~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 February 2018. Core 374-U1524B-1H collected $7.76~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, establishing  a seafloor depth of $2394\mathrm{~m~}$ . We terminated Hole U1524B as the se a ice continued to approach and began to retrieve the drill string bac k to the ship. The dynamic positioning system was engaged at $1215\,\mathrm{h}$ to move away from the ice. The drill collar stands were secured i n the derrick, and the BHA components were disassembled and inspected. After the bit cleared the rig floor, the remaining rig floo r equipment was secured at $2030\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 6 February, ending Hol e U1524B. A total of $10.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (0.4 days) was spent in Hole U1524B.  

A single APC core collected $7.76\:\mathrm{m}$ of core over a $7.7\;\mathrm{m}$ advanc e $(101\%)$ .  

# Transit to Site U1525  

After abandoning Site U1524 because of encroaching sea ice, w e departed for Site U1525 at $2030\;\mathrm{h}$ on 6 February 2018. We decide d to go to this alternate site because it was close to Site U1524 (4 7 nmi) but outside the sea ice edge and the Ross Sea Unconformit y RSU3 (primary objective at Site U1524) is at a shallower depth. Th e $50\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1525 was completed in $5.6~\mathrm{h}$ at an averag e speed of $8.9\,\mathrm{kt}$ . A small deviation in course was required to navigat e around sea ice. The vessel arrived at Site U1525 at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 February. The thrusters were lowered and secured at $0215\;\mathrm{h},$ , clearin g the drill floor for operations. We did not deploy an acoustic positioning beacon at this site.  

# Site U1525  

Site U1525 was added to the schedule when we were forced t o temporarily leave Site U1524 because of encroaching sea ice. Th e operational plan for Site U1525 consisted of APC/XCB coring in  a single hole until ice moved away from Site U1524. Hole U1525A wa s cored to a total depth of $213.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF using a combination of APC, HLAPC, and XCB coring. A total of $51.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.1 days) was spent a t Site U1525.  

We collected 33 cores at Site U1525. The APC system was deployed eight times, collecting $63.23\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(103\%)$ . The HLAP C system was deployed 14 times, recovering $52.64\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(92\%)$ . The XCB system was used 11 times and collected $42.83\textrm{m}$ $(45\%)$ . (Table T2).  

# Hole U1525A  

Operations for Hole U1525A began by preparing the APC/XC B BHA and then lowering the drill string toward the seafloor. The calculated PDR depth for the site was $1790.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF. We picked up th e top drive and lowered the drill bit to tag the seafloor. Because th e tag indicated the seafloor was soft, we prepared a nonmagneti c APC core barrel and positioned the drill bit at $1786~\mathrm{m}$ DRF. Hol e U1525A was started at $1000\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 7 February 2018. Core 374- U1525A-1H recovered $8.62~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, establishing a seafloo r depth of 1776 mbsl. We continued to APC core with nonmagneti c core barrels through Core 4H $^{28.9\mathrm{~m~}}$ DSF), which was a partial stroke. We switched to the HLAPC coring system to collect Core s 5F through 8F ( $28.9–43.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF). Because Core 8F was a partial stroke with no recovery, we switched to the XCB system to cu t Cores 9X and 10X (43.0–55.7 m DSF) to get through an indurate d zone. We then switched back to the HLAPC system for Cores 11 F through 15F ( $55.7{-}79.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF). With continued successful pisto n coring, we switched back to full-length APC core barrels and collected Cores 16H through 19H, which penetrated to $111.8~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Because Core 19H recorded a partial stroke, we advanced $4.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ based on recovery and switched back to the HLAPC coring system, collecting Cores 20F through 24F ( $111.8–131.2\mathrm{~m}$ DSF). Core 24 F also recorded a partial stroke, indicating HLAPC refusal, so w e switched to the XCB coring system. The remainder of the hole wa s cored with the XCB system, cutting Cores 25X through 33X to a total depth of $213.2~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. We experienced multiple shattered cor e liners (6 out of 11; $55\%$ ) using the XCB system, which we suspec t resulted from a combination of very cold seawater $(-1.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ circulating through the drill string and the small space between the cor e liner and the core barrel, which allows vibration of the core liner. Because ice conditions at Site U1524 were forecast to improve ove r the next $24~\mathrm{h}$ , we opted to terminate coring after Core 33X. W e pulled the drill string out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $2150\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 February. After conducting routine rig maintenance (slip an d cut 115 ft of drill line), the remainder of the drill string was retrieved, and the rig floor was secured at $0535\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February, ending operations at Site U1525.  

Total recovery in Hole U1525A was $158.70\mathrm{~m~}$ over $213.2\textrm{m}$ o f coring $(74\%)$ . The APC coring system was deployed eight times, collecting $63.23\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $61.5~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(103\%)$ . The HLAP C was deployed 14 times, collecting $52.64\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $57.0\textrm{m}$ o f coring $(92\%)$ . The XCB was deployed 11 times, recovering $42.83\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $94.7~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(45\%)$ .  

# Return to Site U1524  

The transit back to Site U1524 covered $47\;\mathrm{nmi}$ in $4.4\,\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $10.7\,\mathrm{kt}$ . We arrived at Site U1524 at $1006\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February 2018, and the vessel was positioned over the acousti c positioning beacon that we had left there.  

# Hole U1524C  

We prepared a RCB BHA and lowered the drill string toward th e seafloor. After the drill bit reached $1766~\mathrm{m}$ DRF, we deployed th e subsea camera to recover the seafloor acoustic positioning beaco n because it had failed to release when we previously abandoned th e site because of approaching sea ice. We lowered the drill string t o near the seafloor, maneuvered the vessel to the beacon, and captured it with a grapple hanging from the camera frame. We recovered the subsea camera to the ship, with the beacon arriving o n deck at $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February 2018. After securing the subsea camera, we continued to prepare for drilling operations. We dropped  a  

RCB core barrel with center bit and started Hole U1524C at $2110\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 February. The hole was advanced by drilling without coring t o $260.5\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. A 30 bbl high-viscosity mud sweep was pumped at th e end of the drilled interval, and the RCB core barrel with the cente r bit was retrieved. We started RCB coring and cut Cores 374- U1524C-2R through 20R $?260.5–441.9\mathrm{~m}$ DSF). At $0915\mathrm{~h~}$ on 1 1 February, coring operations for the remainder of the expeditio n were terminated because of a mechanical breakdown of the por t stern tube and shaft arrangement. After recovering the last core, 5 0 bbl of high-viscosity mud was circulated to improve hole condition s for the trip out of the hole. The drill string was pulled out of th e hole, with the bit clearing the seafloor at $1150\,\mathrm{h}$ and arriving on th e rig floor at $1820~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 February. The rig floor was secured fo r transit at $1835~\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1524C and Expedition 374 scienc e operations. The time spent in Hole U1524C was $56.50\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.4 days). The RCB coring system was deployed 19 times, collecting 19.2 0 m of core over $181.4~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(11\%)$ (Table T2).  

# Transit to Lyttelton  

After abandoning operations at Site U1524, we headed north toward Lyttelton while attempting to resolve the mechanical problem. When it became clear that the problem could not be fixed withou t returning to port, we set a course for a waypoint $12\;\mathrm{nmi}$ from th e Lyttelton pilot station. The $1876\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit was completed in 173. 0 $\mathrm{~h~}(7.2\mathrm{~days})$ at an average speed of $10.8~\mathrm{kt}$ . We arrived at the waypoint at $0148~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 February 2018. The thrusters were lowered, and we switched to dynamic positioning control at $0230~\mathrm{h}$ . Ou r original plan was to take on supplies to fix the mechanical proble m at sea; however, with the approach of Cyclone Gita we asked an d received confirmation that we could move to a berth in Lyttelton fo r shelter. We raised the thrusters and proceeded to the pilot station. The pilot boarded the vessel at $1342~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 February, and the 3 0 nmi transit to Lyttelton ended with the first line ashore at Berth  2 West at $1512\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 February.  

# Tie-up in Lyttelton  

Upon arrival in Lyttelton, we loaded supplies to repair the vessel. Repairs were completed on 22 February 2018. A pilot boarded th e vessel at $0754\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 February, and we shifted to Berth 7 East, wit h the first line secure at $0902\,\mathrm{h}$ . After completing the expedition science reports and conducting our final science meeting, Expeditio n 374 scientists were free to disembark the vessel after $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 2 February. While tied up in Lyttelton, we began to load supplies fo r upcoming Expedition 375 and offload core and samples from Expedition 374. While at Berth 7 East, we loaded two refrigerated containers of catering supplies and three flats of drill pipe on 2 3 February. We also off-loaded an empty core liner box. At $0558\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 25 February, the harbor pilot arrived to shift the vessel to the Oi l Berth. Bunkering began at $0735\,\mathrm{h},$ , and 1100 metric tons of marin e gas oil were loaded by $2350\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 25 February. A harbor pilo t boarded the vessel at $1624\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 February and shifted the vessel t o Berth 2 West with the aid of two harbor tugs. We remained tied u p at this berth until $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 March. During this time, we loade d $10\%$ inch casing, $4\%$ inch casing, and pup joints to the riser hold. W e also loaded seven flats of equipment for Expedition 375, includin g four flats of CORK equipment, two 40 ft containers of equipmen t (one for IODP and one for Siem Offshore), and some of the IOD P airfreight. The Expedition 374 cores were off-loaded to a refrigerated container on 1 March, and 10 coolers of Expedition 374 samples packed in dry ice were off-loaded for shipment on 2 March.  A 20 ft container was also loaded with equipment for return to College Station, TX. Fresh food for Expedition 375 was loaded on  6 March. We met with the Expedition 375 Expedition Project Manager to finalize logistics for critical equipment to be transferred t o the ship, which occurred on 7 March.  

Because of a scheduled strike at the port of Lyttelton, we opte d to shift the vessel to Timaru, New Zealand, for the end of Expedition 374 to avoid the possibility of getting stuck in port because of  a labor shutdown. Prior to departing on 7 March, we gave a ship tou r to local government and business officials. The pilot boarded th e vessel at $1456\;\mathrm{h},$ and the last line was released at $1518~\mathrm{h}$ . The pilo t departed the vessel at $1536\;\mathrm{h},$ and we began our sea voyage to por t in Timaru.  

# Transit to Timaru  

The $138\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Timaru was completed in $17.5~\mathrm{h}$ at a n average speed of $7.6\;\mathrm{kt}$ . The pilot boarded the vessel at $0746~\mathrm{h}$ . Expedition 374 officially ended with the first line ashore at Berth  2 North at $0848\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 March 2018.

Long-term trend in deep-sea temperature through the Cenozoic based on removal of the ice volume component of the benthic $\delta^{18}0$ record using sequence stratigraphic records (black line with gray uncertainty band) and $\mathsf{M g}/\mathsf{C}\mathsf{a}$ estimates of deep-sea temperatures (Cramer et al., 2009) and scaled $\delta^{18}0$ for the past 10 My (Miller et al., 2011). D. Reconstruction of sea level lowstands (black lines) with minimum uncertainty ranges (gray shading) and smoothed highstand trend (black dotted line) using sequence stratigraphy for the New Jersey margin. Sea levels $>\!70\;\mathrm{m}$ imply a significant tectonic component to this record, particularly prior to the Oligocene (Kominz et al., 2008). Figure reproduced from McKay et al. (2016).

Expedition 374 sites are located in the most sensitive sector of the Antarctic for assessing ice sheet responses to (A) sea level and (B) ocean heat flux. $\mathsf{A}\mathsf{I}\mathsf{S}=$ Antarctic Ice Sheet, ANDRILL $=$ Antarctic Geological Drilling Project. C–F. A more terrestrial West Antarctica in the Oligocene could support a larger ice sheet than present, despite a warmer climate (Wilson et al., 2013). Thus, the timing of Ross Sea overdeepening has important implications for sea level budgets and for understanding mass balance controls. $\mathsf{E{-}O}=$ Eocene–Oligocene, Elev $=$ elevation. G. The integration of sedimentologic data with modeling was key to the success of ANDRILL (blue circle). Despite discontinuous sedimentation, targeting time intervals with short-duration magnetic reversals enabled orbitalscale West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) reconstructions. Models indicate that grounded ice sheets occur at Sites U1521 and U1522 (black circle) during periods of maximum Antarctic ice volume. These ice-proximal sites will enable the assessment of the Antarctic contributions to sea level lowstands, building significantly on the record of ANDRILL. Not all modeled glacial maxima are characterized by advance of ice to the continental shelf edge. $\mathsf{L G M=}$ Last Glacial Maximum.

Figure F7. Depth maps (in two-way traveltime [TWT]) for selected regional seismic ANTOSTRAT unconformities, with interpretations of ice sheet history (after Brancolini et al., 1995) and location of Expedition 374 sites. Maps of Ross Sea seismic Unconformities RSU4, RSU3, and RSU2 have now been extended into the continental slope and rise area (E. Olivo, unpubl. data; not shown) and into the western Ross Sea as part of the IPY Rossmap project. Gray shading in A shows the areas lying above sea level at the time of Unconformity RSU6 on the basis of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 270 stratigraphy. Site U1521 is located at (A) the ocean margin of one of these areas, which subsided in the early Miocene and (B) was cut by a large glacial valley by the early to mid-Miocene. Site U1521 will provide environmental information about paleo-ice stream and ocean current interplay during the middle Miocene. Site U1522 is located at the edge of a large embayment of the continental shelf in the eastern Ross Sea, where West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) streams have carved glacial valleys since Unconformity RSU3. Sites U1522–U1525 will provide evidence for testing this hypothesis from subglacial ice proximal (Site U1522) and ice distal (Site U1523) to very ice distal (Sites U1525 and U1524) Miocene to Pleistocene records.

Figure F8. Composite seismic cross section of Lines PD90-34, PD90-35, and PD90-36 (after Anderson and Bartek, 1992; De Santis et al., 1995) showing a transect across the central Ross Sea that includes Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Sites 272 and 273 and Site U1521. The seismic profile and age constraint from the sites document that this area was filled with glacial sediments (\~250 ms TWT thick) during the early Miocene, suggesting ice advance from the south or southwest. The green reflector on top of the glacial unit is interpreted to be the RSU4 unconformity carving a large southeast–northwest-oriented trough across the central Ross Sea (see Figure F7 for transect line). Site U1521 records sediment below and above Unconformity RSU4, providing information of ice-volume growth and retreat during the early Miocene cooling, the middle Miocene, and the Middle Miocene Climatic Transition. Seismic lines are single-channel reflection seismic profiles (air gun 2.6 l) collected by Rice University, TX (USA), in 1990 (Anderson and Bartek, 1992). ${\mathsf{S P}}=$ shotpoint.

Figure F22. A. Seismic profile Line IT94AR-127 across Site U1525 (see inset in Figure F21). Multichannel reflection seismic profile collected by Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS; Italy) under Programma Nazionale delle Ricerche in Antartide in 1994 (I. Finetti et al., unpubl. data). The seismic stack profile is available through the Antarctic Seismic Data Library System for scientific purposes. The source used was a $2\times20$ air gun (74.8 l), and data were acquired with a $1500\,\mathsf{m}$ streamer (120 channels, first offset $=164\,\mathsf{m}$ and last offset $=1664\;\mathrm{m}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ). Reprocessing of seismic Line IT94AR-127 for Expedition 374 was done by Riccardo Geletti (OGS). ${\mathsf{S P}}=$ shotpoint. B. Interpretation of key seismic reflectors in Line IT94AR-127.

Figure F24. Composite seismic cross section showing transect approach from the continental shelf to the slope and rise. The seismic data have different resolutions and penetration depths because they were collected by several nations with different parameters and targets. Line BGR80-007 (24–air gun array 23.45 l) was collected by Bundesanstalt für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (Germany) in 1980, Line ATC-208 (bolt-type air gun 35.58 l) was collected by the Institut Français du Pétrole (France) in 1982, and Lines IT94-127A $\scriptstyle(2\times20\cdot$ –air gun array 74.8 l) and IT17RS-303B (air gun 3.44 l) were collected by Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica Sperimentale (Italy) under Programma Nazionale delle Ricerche in Antartide in 1994 and 2017, respectively.
