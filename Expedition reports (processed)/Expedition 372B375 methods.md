# Introduction  

This section provides an overview of operations, depth conventions, core handling, curatorial procedures, and analyses performe d on the R/V JOIDES Resolution during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditions 372 and 375. This information wil l help the reader understand the basis of our shipboard observation s and preliminary interpretations. It will also enable interested investigators to identify data and select samples for further study. The information presented here concerns shipboard operations an d analyses described in the site chapters.  

# Site locations  

GPS coordinates from pre-expedition site surveys were used t o position the vessel at Expedition 372 and 375 drill sites. Result s from Expedition 372 were further used to define GPS locations for  a subset of the Expedition 375 sites. A SyQwest Bathy 2010 CHIR P subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloor depth on the approach to each site, but the depths provided were underestimated a t some sites because of the locally steep slope of the seafloor. Onc e the vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters were lowered and  a positioning beacon was dropped to the seafloor. Dynamic positioning control of the vessel uses navigational input from the GPS system and triangulation to the seafloor beacon weighted by th e estimated positional accuracy. The final reported hole position represents the mean position calculated from the GPS data collecte d over a significant portion of the time the hole was occupied.  

# Drilling operations  

During Expedition 372, we conducted logging-while-drillin g (LWD) operations (see LWD safety monitoring and Loggin g while  drilling).  The  typical  LWD/measurement-while-drillin g (MWD) bottom-hole assembly (BHA) used during Expedition 37 2 consisted of an $8\%$ inch tungsten carbide insert tricone bit, an $8\%$ inch near-bit stabilizer/bit sub, various LWD/MWD tools, an $8\%$ inch string stabilizer, a $6\%$ inch float sub, a crossover sub, twelve $6\%$ inch drill collars, a $6\%$ inch drilling jar, three $6\%$ inch drill collars, and a crossover to 5 inch drill pipe.  

During Expedition 375, we conducted coring, wireline logging , and observatory operations. For detailed observatory operations, see Observatory in the Site U1518 chapter and Observatory in th e Site U1519 chapter (Saffer et al., 2019; Barnes et al., 2019). The coring systems used included the advanced piston corer (APC), halflength APC (HLAPC), extended core barrel (XCB), and rotary cor e barrel (RCB) systems.  

The APC and HLAPC systems typically cut soft-sediment core s with less coring disturbance than other IODP rotary coring systems. After the APC/HLAPC core barrel is lowered through the drill pip e and lands above the bit, the drill pipe is pressurized until the tw o shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel is then driven into the formation and cuts the core. The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke,” by observin g the pressure gauge on the rig floor because the excess pressure accumulated prior to the stroke drops rapidly.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in one of two ways: (1) th e piston fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from th e pump pressure and recovery reading) because the formation is to o hard, or (2) excessive force $\left(>60,\!000\,\mathrm{{lb})}$ is required to pull the cor e barrel out of the formation. When a full stroke could not b e achieved, one or more additional attempts are typically made, an d after each incomplete stroke the bit is advanced by the full length o f the core barrel. Note that this results in a nominal recovery o f ${\sim}100\%$ based on the assumption that the barrel penetrated the formation by the length of core recovered. During Expedition 375,  a number of partial strokes returned nearly full core liners. In thes e cases, we did not define the partial strokes as refusal, and we attempted additional APC cores. When a full or partial stroke i s achieved but excessive force cannot retrieve the barrel, the core barrel is “drilled over,” meaning that after the inner core barrel was successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit is advanced to tota l depth to free the APC barrel.  

The standard APC system uses a $9.5\:\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, wherea s the HLAPC system uses a $4.7\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, the HLAPC is deployed after the standard APC system consistentl y has ${<}50\%$ recovery. During use of the HLAPC, the same criteria fo r refusal are applied as for the APC system. Use of the HLAPC allow s for greater APC coring depths to be attained, typically with les s drilling disturbance, than would have otherwise been possible.  

When the HLAPC system has insufficient recovery, the XC B system is typically used. In our case, however, the XCB system wa s not able to recover some of the sediments encountered at depth s where it would normally be used.  

The XCB system is used to advance the hole if HLAPC refusa l occurred before the target depth is reached or when drilling conditions require it. The XCB system is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe that extends below the large rotary APC/XCB bit. Th e smaller bit can cut indurated sediments with less torque and flui d circulation than the main drill bit, potentially improving recover y and core quality. The XCB cutting shoe extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead o f the main bit in soft sediments but retracts into the main bit whe n hard formations are encountered. XCB core barrels are $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long. The typical APC/XCB BHA used during Expedition 375 consiste d of an $11\%$ inch $({\sim}29.05\,\mathrm{cm})$ drill bit, a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, a nonmagnetic drill collar, five $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered drill collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch transition drill pipe, and  a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extended to the surface.  

The RCB system is a rotary system designed to recover har d sediments and igneous basement. The BHA, including the bit an d outer core barrel, is rotated with the drill string while bearings allo w the inner core barrel to remain nominally stationary. RCB core barrels are $9.5{-}9.6\;\mathrm{m}$ long. The typical RCB BHA consists of a $9\%$ inc h drill bit, a bit sub, an outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, a variable number of $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered drill collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe, and  a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extends to the surface.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used in APC, HLAPC, and RC B deployments. APC cores were oriented with the Icefield MI-5 cor e orientation tool when coring conditions allowed. Formation temperature measurements were taken during APC coring with the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3). Information o n recovered cores, drilled intervals, and tool deployments is provide d in the Operations section of each site chapter.  

# LWD safety monitoring  

The LWD BHA allows real-time monitoring of multiple sensor s for downhole conditions. In particular, the annular pressure whil e drilling (APWD) measurement can document flow-in or overpressured formations or the presence of free gas such as pressure decreases when seawater is replaced with less dense gas or pressur e increases during pipe connections if flow-in from the formation occurs. A summary of safety monitoring operations for each hole ca n be found in the Logging while drilling section of each site chapter.  

Additional LWD measurements that may help detect the presence of free gas are compressional ( $P$ -wave) velocity (decreases wit h free gas) and electrical resistivity (increases with gas hydrate or fre e gas abundance). The gamma ray log is also valuable for monitorin g because it provides constraints on lithology that may indicate th e ability of fluids to flow (lower gamma ray indicates coarser graine d formations). The caliper measurement can be used for monitorin g borehole integrity, which influences the quality of the logs and ma y explain some pressure changes. Using these logs, we employed  a system to evaluate potential risks (Table T1).  

For safe drilling, the borehole pressure must be monitored and  a threshold pressure anomaly must be defined. The primary measurement used for safety (gas and/or overpressure) monitoring wa s APWD. Simple calculations (e.g., static column or fixed mass of fre e gas per unit volume) at any depth can be used to predict the pressure drop for a given gas saturation in the borehole annulus. For example, a gas saturation of $\sim\!20\%$ in the annulus yields a pressur e drop of 50 psi $\left(0.34\;\mathrm{MPa}\right)$ at 200 meters below seafloor (mbsf) (A. Malinverno, unpubl. data). For a pressure increase, the threshold i s defined by the increase in pressure that can be balanced or suppressed by weighted mud without fracturing the formation assuming a static column. For example, a $10.5\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ mud provides 67 ps i $(0.46\,\mathrm{MPa})$ of overpressure (pressure in excess of hydrostatic) at 20 0 mbsf.  

Given these baseline calculations, dynamic effects, the measurement response time, and the time required to displace a borehol e (i.e., completely circulate the volume of the borehole), we employe d a safety protocol based on a pressure decrease or increase ${>}50$ ps i $\left(0.34\;\mathrm{MPa}\right)$ relative to the equivalent circulating density (ECD) reference (Figure F1). The ECD reference is influenced by the hydrostatic pressure, pumping rate, borehole diameter, and cuttings in th e annulus. We determined the ECD reference by careful and continuous monitoring of the annular pressure in relation to the hydrostati c pressure and the static column for $10.5\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ mud. We establishe d that if a ${}>\!50$ psi pressure decrease or increase was observed, drillin g advancement would cease and relevant personnel (Driller, Co-Chie f Scientists, Expedition Project Manager, Operations Superintendent, and Offshore Installation Manager) would be notified. Seawater would then be circulated in the borehole, and the APW D response would be monitored to obtain the baseline pressure. Th e duration of monitoring would depend on downhole conditions bu t typically would not be less than the time required to displace thre e borehole volumes. If the pressure was maintained within 75 psi o f the ECD reference, then drilling could advance at a reduced rate o f penetration (ROP). Weighted mud would be used as necessary t o maintain pressure within 75 psi of the ECD reference. The ability t o continue advancing the hole using weighted mud would depend o n mud availability. If pressure could not be controlled to within 75 ps i of the ECD reference, the hole would be plugged and abandone d (Figure F1). No pressure excursions exceeding the 50 psi threshol d were observed during Expedition 372. Detailed safety monitorin g information can be found in the Operations section of each sit e chapter.

In addition to safety monitoring, we also analyzed the APWD t o define whether annular conditions are below (negative APWD) o r above (positive APWD) hydrostatic pressure. For comparison t o driller’s mud weight and riserless drilling conditions, we relate th e APWD to the ECD relative to the seafloor $\mathrm{(ECD_{\mathrm{rsf}})}$ (in pounds pe r gallon or parts per gallon):  

$$
\mathrm{ECD}_{\mathrm{rsf}}=(P_{\mathrm{APVD}}-P_{\mathrm{wsf}})/[0.0519(D_{\mathrm{APVD}}-D_{\mathrm{w}}-\mathrm{RKB})],
$$  

# where  

$P_{\mathrm{APWD}}=\mathrm{APWD}$ sensor reading (in pounds per square inch), $P_{\mathrm{wsf}}=$ hydrostatic pressure at seafloor (in pounds per square inch),  

$D_{\mathrm{APWD}}=$ true vertical depth of the APWD sensor referenced to the rig floor (in feet),   
$D_{\mathrm{w}}=$ water depth (in feet),   
$\mathbf{RKB=}$ distance from the sea level to the rig floor (in feet), and   
$0.0519=$ conversion factor.  

Hydrostatic pressure at the seafloor $(P_{\mathrm{wsf}})$ can be calculated b y the ECD of seawater $\mathrm{(ECD_{sw})}$ ) and the water depth $(D_{\mathrm{w}})$ :  

$$
P_{\mathrm{wsf}}=0.0519\times\mathrm{ECD}_{\mathrm{sw}}\times D_{\mathrm{w}},
$$  

where we assume an $\mathrm{ECD}_{\mathrm{sw}}$ of $8.54\;\mathrm{lb/gal}$ based on an average seawater density of $1024\;\mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{3}$ .  

# IODP depth conventions  

The primary drilling and coring depth scales used during Expedition 375 were based on the length of the drill string deployed (e.g., drilling depth below rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]) and the length of core recovered (e.g., core depth belo w seafloor  [CSF])  (see  IODP  Depth  Scales  Terminology  a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines). The logging dept h scale used during Expedition 375 was based on the length of loggin g wireline deployed (e.g., wireline log depth below rig floor [WRF ] and wireline log depth below seafloor [WSF]). In cases where multiple logging passes are made, wireline log depths are mapped to on e reference pass, creating the wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) scale. During Expedition 372, LWD and MWD wer e measured on the LWD depth below seafloor (LSF) scale. LWD dat a are measured by time and are depth-corrected after data acquisition. All depths are in meters. The relationship between scales is defined either by protocol, such as the rules for computation of CS F from DSF, or by user-defined correlations, such as core-to-log correlation. The distinction in nomenclature should keep the reade r aware that a nominal depth value in different depth scales usuall y does not refer to the exact same stratigraphic interval.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF scale). The depth of the cored interval is referenced to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth of the hole fro m the DRF depth of that interval. Standard depths of cores in meter s below the seafloor (CSF-A scale) are determined based on the assumptions that (1) the top depth of a recovered core corresponds t o the top depth of its cored interval (DSF scale) and (2) the recovere d material is a contiguous section even if core segments are separate d by voids when recovered. Standard depths of samples and associated measurements on the CSF-A scale are calculated by adding th e offset of the sample or measurement from the top of its section an d the lengths of all higher sections in the core to the top depth of th e core.  

If a core has ${<}100\%$ recovery, for curation purposes all core d material is assumed to originate from the top of the drilled interva l as a continuous section. In addition, voids in the core are closed b y pushing core segments together, if possible, during core handling a t the core receiving area. Therefore, the true depth interval within th e cored interval is unknown and should be considered a sampling uncertainty (e.g., in age-depth analysis or in correlation of core dat a with downhole logging data).  

When core recovery is ${>}100\%$ (the length of the recovered cor e exceeds that of the cored interval), the depth of a sample or measurement taken from the bottom of a core will be deeper than tha t of a sample or measurement taken from the top of the subsequen t core (i.e., the data associated with the two core intervals overlap o n the CSF-A scale). This overlap can happen when a soft-sedimen t core expands upon recovery (e.g., due to release of gas or removal o f overburden pressure) (typically by a few percent to as much as $15\%$ ). The CSF-B depth scale is a solution to the overlap problem. Thi s method scales the recovered core length back into the interva l cored from ${>}100\%$ to exactly $100\%$ recovery.  

In this volume, unless otherwise noted, depths below rig floo r are reported as meters below rig floor (mbrf), core depths belo w seafloor are reported as meters below seafloor (mbsf) using th e CSF-B depth scale, and wireline logging and LWD depths belo w seafloor are also reported as meters below seafloor.  

# Curatorial procedures and sample depth calculations  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples followed standar d IODP procedure. A full curatorial identifier for a sample consists o f the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, cor e type, section number, section half, piece number (hard rock only), and interval in centimeters measured from the top of the core section. For example, a sample identification of “375-U1518E-2H-5W, $80{-}85~\mathrm{cm}^{\prime\prime}$ indicates a $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ sample removed from the interval between 80 and $85~\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 5 (“W” indicates th e working half) of Core 2 ( $\ ^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^{\prime\prime}$ designates that this core was take n with the APC system) of Hole E at Site U1518 during Expeditio n 375 (Figure F2). The $^{\ast}\mathrm{U}^{\prime\prime}$ preceding the hole number indicates th e hole was drilled by the United States platform, the JOIDES Resolution. The drilling system used to obtain a core is designated in th e sample identifiers as follows:  

• $\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{APC}$ . • $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{HLAPC}.$ • $\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}{C}\mathbb{B}$ . • $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{XCB}$ .  

Integers (instead of a letter) are used to denote the “core type” o f drilled intervals (e.g., the drilled interval at the top of Hole U1520 C is denoted as Core 11, and the first RCB core that follows it is denoted as Core 2R).  

# Core handling and analysis  

When the core barrel reached the rig floor, the core catche r from the bottom of the core was removed, and a short whole-roun d (WR) sample was typically extracted for paleontologic (PAL) analysis in sediment. Next, the core was extracted from the core barrel i n its plastic liner. The liner was carried from the rig floor to the cor e receiving area on the catwalk outside the core laboratory, where i t was curated.  

Typically, the core was cut into ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ segments. In some cases, the lengths of sections were adjusted so that WR samples could b e taken for interstitial water (IW) chemical analyses. At some site s where gas hydrate was anticipated, an infrared (IR) camera was use d to examine the core for cold spots that would indicate the local presence of hydrate for two reasons: (1) to avoid hydrate-bearing intervals for routine IW sampling and (2) to target these intervals fo r calibrating shipboard chemical analyses or for collecting personal hydrate samples for post-expedition analyses. Next, syringe sample s were taken for headspace gas analyses and personal microbiolog y samples, and occasionally vacuum tube samples were taken for additional gas analyses. Once all catwalk samples were collected, blu e (uphole direction) and clear (downhole direction) liner caps wer e glued onto the cut liner sections with acetone. Yellow caps wer e used instead of clear caps to denote missing intervals where W R samples were removed.

Core sections were then placed in a core rack in the laboratory . When core sections reached equilibrium with laboratory temperature (typically after $4\;\mathrm{h}$ ), they were run through the Whole-Roun d Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) for $P$ -wave velocity $P$ -wave logge r [PWL]), magnetic susceptibility (magnetic susceptibility logge r [MSL]), and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density (see Physical properties). PWL was typically not measured for RCB cores . Core sections were also run through the Natural Gamma Radiatio n Logger (NGRL), and thermal conductivity measurements wer e taken when the material was suitable. Once all WR measurement s were completed, additional WR personal samples were taken fo r post-expedition geotechnical, mechanical, and physical propertie s analyses.  

Core sections were split lengthwise from bottom to top int o working and archive halves. Investigators should note that deepe r sedimentary material can be transported upward on the split face o f each section during the splitting process. For hard rock, a diamondimpregnated saw was used to split sections.  

The working half of each core was described by the structura l geologists after discrete samples were taken for moisture and density (MAD) and personal biomarker analyses. Once description wa s complete, clustered samples were taken next to each WR sample fo r shipboard X-ray diffraction (XRD), carbonate (CARB) analyses, an d a few shore-based studies. Paleomagnetic samples were then take n from undisturbed portions of the core, followed by all other personal samples based on the sampling plan agreed upon by the science party and shipboard curator. Discrete thermal conductivit y and $P$ -wave samples were also taken for lithified sediment or har d rock. Sampling of certain critical intervals (such as the fault zone a t Site U1518) was delayed until all personal samples could be prioritized. Samples were not collected when the lithology was unsuitabl e or the core was severely deformed.  

The archive half of each core section was scanned on the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) and measured for point magneti c susceptibility (MSP) and reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetr y (RSC) on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). Labele d foam pieces were used to denote missing WR intervals in the SHI L images. The archive halves were then described visually and wit h smear slides for sedimentology. Finally, the magnetization of archive-half sections and working-half discrete pieces was measure d with the cryogenic magnetometer and spinner magnetometer, respectively.  

When all steps were completed, cores were wrapped, sealed i n plastic tubes, and transferred to cold storage space aboard the ship. At the end of the expedition, the cores were sent to cold storage a t the IODP Gulf Coast Repository in College Station, Texas (USA).  

# Drilling and handling core disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed and contain extraneou s material as a result of the coring and core handling process (Jutzele r et al., 2014). In formations with loose sand layers, sand from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down by drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom of the hole, and be sampled with the nex t core. The uppermost $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ of each core must therefore be examined critically during description for potential “fall-in.”  

Common coring-induced deformation in APC and HLAP C cores includes the concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Piston action can result in fluidization (flow-in) a t the bottom of the cores. Additionally, retrieval from depth to th e surface can result in elastic rebound. Gas that is in solution at dept h may become free and drive core segments apart in the liner. Whe n gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the liner, which forces some sediment, as well as gas, out of the liner. These disturbances are described in each site chapter and graphically indicated on the visual core descriptions (se e Core descriptions).

# Lithostratigraphy  

This section outlines the procedures used to document th e composition, texture, and sedimentary structures of the sediment s and sedimentary rocks recovered during Expedition 375. The strategy for description and interpretation of core disturbance, bot h drilling induced and tectonic, is discussed in Structural geology. The routine procedures for lithostratigraphy include visual core description, smear slide and thin section analysis of texture and composition, digital color imaging, color spectrophotometry, bul k powder XRD, and carbon/carbonate analysis. XRD samples wer e co-located in “clusters” with samples for carbon/carbonate (se e Geochemistry) and MAD analyses (see Physical properties). Clusters were immediately adjacent to most WR sample intervals, including those for IW.  

Archive halves were used for sedimentologic description an d petrographic observation. Sections dominated by unlithified sediment were split using a thin wire held in high tension. The split surface of each archive half was assessed for quality (e.g., smearing o r surface unevenness) and, if necessary, gently scraped with a glas s slide. Harder sedimentary rock was split with a diamond-impregnated saw. For cores with significant water pooling, we dried the archive half with paper towels prior to imaging. The archive half wa s imaged by the SHIL and then analyzed for color reflectance an d magnetic susceptibility using the SHMSL (see Physical properties).  

Following imaging, the archive halves were described macroscopically for lithologic attributes and sedimentary structures, aided by use of a $20\times$ wide-field hand lens and binocular microscope. We also enlarged digital images on a high-resolution monito r next to the description table. Visual inspection focused on textural variation, color, internal sedimentary structures (including soft-sediment deformation), and bed thickness. We also considered the severity of drilling/coring disturbance (see Structural geology fo r detailed assessment). Smear slide analysis, thin section petrography, and XRD were used to identify sedimentary constituents, includin g microfossils and minerals. For large clasts of igneous rocks, initial analysis focused on visual inspection of texture, grain size, color, contacts, and changes in primary and secondary mineralogy. All o f the descriptive data were entered into DESClogik. All description s and sample locations were recorded using curated depths and documented on visual core description (VCD) graphic reports (Figur e F3). We defined lithostratigraphic units and subunits using all forms of data. Units and unit boundaries were also correlated at th e facies scale with logging unit designations from LWD logs (see Logging while drilling).  

# Visual core descriptions  

# Classification of lithology  

We based each lithologic description on visual core description , supported by smear slide and thin section analysis of dominant an d minor lithologies and bulk analysis of carbonate content. The following classification scheme, modified from Mazzullo and Graha m (1988), emphasizes important descriptors that we recorded i n

DESClogik  (Sediment  tab  in  macroscopic  spreadsheets;  se e DESC_WKB in Supplementary material). The modifications wer e tailored to the actual lithologies encountered during Expedition 37 5 and our desire to simplify terminology as much as possible. Lithologic names consist of a principal term based on texture, the dominant composition, and the degree of lithification.  

The first discriminator (texture) follows the ternary scheme o f Shepard (1954) (Figure F4). Ranges and boundaries for all grain siz e categories follow the conventional Wentworth (1922) definitions a s used by Folk (1980), regardless of particle composition. The ter m “sand,” for example, refers to unconsolidated sediment with $>\!75\%$ sand-sized particles. Similarly, for cases in which silt-rich $(\mathrm{>}50\%)$ sediment contains ${>}25\%$ sand, the term “sandy silt” is used. Th e lithology designations for siliciclastic material are based on grai n size alone, although compositional modifiers can be added as desired (e.g., quartz-rich sand). Terminology for broader ranges o f particle size can be cumbersome, so we grouped common mixtures. We apply the term “mud,” for example, to encompass the span o f sizes from silty clay to clayey silt.  

Regardless of their particle size distributions, naturally occurring marine sediments usually contain mixtures of grain composition. Sediment with $>\!75\%$ biogenic debris is classified as pelagic, either biocalcareous or biosiliceous, based on the most abundan t biogenic component (Figure F5). If the sediment contains ${<}50\%$ biogenic debris (calcareous or siliceous), then it is classified as eithe r siliciclastic (implied terrigenous) or volcaniclastic based on th e dominant nonbiogenic component (Figure F6). The classificatio n for volcanic particles (Figure F7) is further guided by the scheme o f Fisher and Schmincke (1984). In the broadest sense, “volcaniclasts ” include the products of physical weathering and are commonly altered, heterogeneous assemblages of volcanic rock fragments, lav a fragments, tuff fragments, crystals, and compositionally divers e glass shards and pumice. “Pyroclasts” constitute a subset of volcani c clasts and are defined here as fresh or relatively unaltered, compositionally homogeneous, unconsolidated particles (e.g., glass shard s and pumice) that formed directly from magma fragmentatio n during explosive eruptions on land or effusive/explosive vents o n the seafloor. If the volcanic clast population is $>\!75\%$ pyroclast s (tephra), then the sediment is divided further based on particle size: ash $^{\prime}{<}2\ \mathrm{mm})$ , lapilli $(2{-}64\ \mathrm{mm})$ , bombs, or blocks (Fischer an d Schmincke, 1984). In practice, our designations are meant to b e purely descriptive, and it can be difficult to recognize each volcani c grain’s physical origin based on smear slide observations.  

The principal lithology name is typically preceded by majo r modifiers that refer to components making up $25\%{-}50\%$ of the sediment (e.g., calcareous or nannofossil-rich mud and volcaniclasti c silty clay). Terms for the minor components $10\%{-}25\%$ of the total ) follow the principal name (e.g., clayey silt with glauconite). As another example, an unconsolidated sediment containing $25\%$ volcaniclastic grains, $10\%$ nannofossils, $25\%$ silt, and $40\%$ clay would b e termed “volcaniclastic silty clay with nannofossils.” Unconsolidate d fine-grained pelagic sediment is classified as “ooze,” usually with  a major modifier added to identify the dominant allochem (e.g., biosiliceous ooze and calcareous ooze). We insert additional modifier s to characterize specific microfossil categories (e.g., nannofossil ooz e and foraminiferal ooze).  

Inclusion of these additional criteria yields four compositiona l classes (Figure F5); each class carries the possibility of grain size distributions shown in Figure F4:  

Figure F4. Classification of sediment based on grain size (Shepard, 1954).   
These categories apply regardless of particle composition or mineralogy.   
• Pyroclastic sediment (tephra) containing $>\!75\%$ volcanic particles of inferred primary eruptive origin,   
• Volcaniclastic sediment containing $>\!75\%$ volcanic particles of detrital and/or primary eruptive origin,   
• Siliciclastic sediment containing $>\!75\%$ terrigenous detritus, and   
• Pelagic sediment (biosiliceous or biocalcareous) containing $>\!75\%$ biogenic particles.

Figure F6. Continuum of compositional classes encountered during Expedition 375 core description. Siliciclastic end-member can be further divided b y grain size (Figure F4). Volcaniclastic end-member can be further divided b y grain size (Figure F7). Roughly equal mixtures of volcaniclastic silt (or sand ) and siliciclastic silt (or sand) are classified as mixed clastic silt (or sand). Nanno $=$ nannofossil. Note that the term “marl” encompasses the range o f lithified mud-rich calcareous ooze to lithified calcareous (nannofossil-rich ) mud.  

![](images/3bfa752845b26e681f3049f0e4e9c918accfffa474d204be3c3c6f34db565c82.jpg)  

End-member compositions are easy to recognize and classif y using this approach. Difficulties arise with admixtures that are clos e to a dividing line between two compositional categories. To mak e the terminology as succinct as possible, we refer to roughly equa l mixtures of siliciclastic silt (or sand) and volcaniclastic silt (or sand ) as “mixed clastic” silt or sand (Figure F6). Similarly, we call roughl y equal mixtures of fine-grained biocalcareous sediment and siliciclastic mud “muddy calcareous ooze” or “calcareous mud.”  

# Lithification  

Lithification state can be inconsistent and dynamic, changing a s a function of burial compaction, cementation, and localized tectonic consolidation. Perceptions of induration during core description can also be influenced by differential drying of the split cor e and differential coring disturbance between more cohesive and les s cohesive interbeds. To be as objective as possible, our designation s for all of the compositional and textural classes are based largely o n the type of coring system. We routinely consider cores obtaine d with the APC or HLAPC system to be unconsolidated (e.g., sand, silty clay, volcanic ash, and biocalcareous ooze), whereas more consolidated siliciclastic sediment recovered with the XCB and RC B systems is designated as “-stone,” as in claystone, silty claystone, volcaniclastic sandstone, and so on (Figure F5).  

For simplicity, we apply the general term “mudstone” to th e broader range of lithified silty clay to clayey silt. Following the sam e rationale, lithified volcanic ash is designated “tuff.” Lithified biocalcareous ooze is termed “chalk,” and lithified biosiliceous ooze i s called “chert” or “diatomite.” For lithified examples in which most o r all of the biocalcareous particles have been replaced or obscured b y small crystals of calcite, we use the term “limestone.” We assign th e term “marl” to the broader range of lithified muddy calcareous ooz e to lithified calcareous mud.

# Color  

Color was determined qualitatively during visual inspection using Munsell color charts. The archive halves were used to identif y compositional and textural elements of the sediment and sedimentary rock, including rock fragments, sedimentary structures, an d diagenetic features such as color mottling and the results of elemen t mobility in diagenesis (e.g., manganese oxide segregation). Color reflectance spectral data were also collected, as outlined in Physica l properties.  

# Sedimentary textures, structures, and fabric  

For relatively coarse material (fine sand and larger), designation s of grain size follow the Wentworth (1922) scale. Finer grained sediments require inspection at high magnification using smear slide s (see below). In addition, the classifications for sorting and roundin g follow the scheme of Folk (1980) (Figure F8).  

Sedimentary structures observed in the recovered cores (Figur e F3) include bedding geometry, size grading (normal and reverse), plane-parallel laminae, soft-sediment deformation, bioturbation, and diagenetic effects. We assign bed thickness terms for recognizable event beds according to Ingram (1954):  

• Very thick bedded $=>\!100\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Thick bedded $=>\!30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Medium bedded $=>\!10\!-\!30\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Thin bedded $=>\!3\!-\!10\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Very thin bedded $=1{-}3\,\mathsf{c m}$ .   
• Laminae $={<}1\;\mathrm{cm}$ .  

Such designations are typically obscured by bioturbation in finegrained sediments (see below) and distorted by drilling disturbanc e (e.g., biscuiting). In addition, picking the gradational tops of normally graded beds is usually subjective. Descriptions of the lowe r contacts of well-defined strata are based on geometry (irregular, planar, curviplanar, and wavy), shape or form (sharp and gradational), and orientation (subhorizontal, inclined, and horizontal). Sediment grading is described as nongraded, normally graded (fining upward), and reverse graded (coarsening upward). Contorte d intervals and fragmentation of cohesive mud(stone) often resul t from gravitational soft-sediment deformation. Examples of suc h mass transport deposits (MTDs) can be difficult to discriminat e with confidence from some types of coring disturbance and ductil e tectonic deformation. Our designations of disturbed intervals ar e meant to be as descriptive as possible.

Figure F8. Classification of sediment sorting and roundness using th e scheme of Folk (1980).  

# Bioturbation  

Bioturbation intensity was recorded on the VCDs using a semiquantitative ichnofabric index (Figure F3) as described by Drose r and Bottjer (1986, 1991), aided by visual comparative charts (Hear d et al., 2014). The four-category index refers to the degree of biogeni c disruption of primary depositional layering and grain fabric (e.g., laminae) by burrows, tracks, and trails, as summarized below:  

• Nonbioturbated $=$ no bioturbation recorded; all original sedimentary structures are preserved.   
• Slight bioturbation $=$ discrete, isolated trace fossils; as much as $10\%$ of original bedding is disturbed.   
• Moderate bioturbation $=$ approximately $10\%{-}60\%$ of original bedding is disturbed; burrows largely overlap and are commonly poorly defined.   
• Strong bioturbation $=$ bedding is completely disturbed, but burrows can still be discerned in places; the fabric is not mixed, although the bedding may be nearly or totally homogenized.  

# Smear slides and thin sections  

Smear slides are essential for identifying and reporting basi c sediment attributes like textural and compositional constituents, but the results are semiquantitative at best (cf. Marsaglia et al., 2013, 2015). Most of the specimens during Expedition 375 were easily dispersed using a toothpick into their constituent detrital and biogeni c particles for smear slide preparation. Some, but not all, of the lithified sediment designated as “-stone” disaggregated with more difficulty  using  a  spatula  but  still  sufficiently  for  smear  slid e examination. For highly indurated rocks, we used thin sections t o verify composition and observe grain fabrics and potential minera l segregation associated with internal sedimentary structures an d bioturbation.  

Smear slides and thin sections were examined in transmitte d polarized light using an Axioskop 40A polarizing microscope (Car l Zeiss) equipped with a Flex Spot digital camera. We estimated th e abundance of biogenic, volcanogenic, and siliciclastic constituent s using a visual comparison chart (Rothwell, 1989), with an emphasi s on major lithologies. Particular attention was paid to the recognition of ash layers and mineral-rich sands. The results are summarized in the smear slides tables (see the microscopic spreadsheets i n DESC_WKB in Supplementary material). We used reference images (Terry and Chilingar, 1955) to help guide visual estimates fo r normalized percentages of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains alon g with abundance for the individual grain types. The component categories are shown on the smear slide description sheet (Figure F9) . Smear slides sampled from volcaniclastic layers were described i n additional detail using a customized categorization of tephra components (Figure F10). Visual estimates of component abundance ar e reported as ranges of area percentage:  

• $\mathrm{T}=\mathrm{trace}\left(<\!0.1\%\right)$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(0.1\%{-}1\%)$ .   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $(1\%-5\%)$ .   
• $C=$ common $(5\%{-}20\%)$ .   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(20\%{-}50\%)$ .   
• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $(>\!50\%{-}80\%)$ .   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ major $(>\!80\%)$ ).  

Accurate estimates of area percentage can be difficult to make , especially in poorly sorted sediments. We validated the relativ e abundance of major to common components (quartz, feldspar, total clay, and calcite) by XRD (see below) and by the absolute weigh t percent of carbonate determined by coulometric analysis (see Geochemistry).  

# IODP use of DESClogik  

Data for the macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of recovered cores were entered into the IODP Laboratory Informatio n Management System (LIMS) database using the IODP data-entr y software DESClogik. DESClogik is core description software use d to store macroscopic and microscopic descriptions of cores. Cor e description data are available through the DESC LIMS Repor t (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/DESCReport). A single row in DESClogik defines one descriptive interval, which is commonly one be d but may also be used, for example, to designate marked color variation that may be of diagenetic origin or thin interbeds that are to o numerous or thin to subdivide. The same is true for disturbed intervals (possible MTDs). The minimum layer thickness for entry of  a discrete lithology onto a VCD is $10~\mathrm{cm}$ . For thin $^{\leftmoon}_{\leftmoon}{<}10\ \mathrm{cm}\right)$ , repetitious interbeds of two lithologies (e.g., sandy silt and siliciclasti c mud), the two individual graphics patterns are plotted side by sid e on the VCD (Figure F3). We recorded bed thickness for all volcaniclastic and siliciclastic event beds $^{>1}$ cm on a separate spreadshee t to draft plots of occurrence frequency and thickness versus dept h (see ash and silt layer spreadsheets in DESCRIPTION in Supplementary material). Those examples include intervals of alternatin g lithologies (e.g., thin interbeds of sandy silt and siliciclastic mud). I n addition, the position of each smear slide is shown in the VCDs wit h a sample code of “SED.”  

# X-ray diffraction  

Samples were selected from the working halves of core section s for analyses of bulk mineralogy by XRD. Sample depths are usuall y the same as for carbon/carbonate (see Geochemistry), MAD (se e Physical properties), and shore-based clay-sized XRD. Most suc h clusters were positioned immediately adjacent to WR sample intervals, including those extracted for IW geochemistry (see Geochemistry). The bulk samples were freeze-dried and homogenized b y grinding in a puck mill with tungsten carbide containers for $1\ \mathrm{min}$ to create fine powders. The randomly oriented powders were to p mounted onto sample holders and scanned using a Bruker D4 Endeavor diffractometer mounted with a VANTEC-1 detector an d nickel-filtered $C\mathrm{uK}\alpha$ radiation. The routine locked-coupled scanning parameters were set as follows:

The XRD results for Expedition 375 provide relative abundance s (in weight percent) of the most common mineral constituents spanning the range of lithologies: total clay minerals (smectite $^+$ illite $^+$ chlorite $^+$ kaolinite), quartz, feldspar (plagioclase $^+$ K-feldspar), an d calcite.  

The original plan for Expedition 375 was to process digital dat a on the JOIDES Resolution using the DIFFRAC.EVA software package; this software allows for baseline definition (set at enhanced, 1.000 curvature, and 1.000 threshold) and smoothing (set at smoot h default factor $=0.124\$ ). Diagnostic peak areas (in units of counts $^{\prime}\!s\times$ angle, measured above the baseline) for each mineral (or mineral group) can be determined using the “create area” function i n DIFFRAC.EVA; this function accommodates manual adjustment o f the upper and lower limits of the diagnostic peaks (Table T2). Failure of a circuit board on the diffractometer, however, necessitate d its replacement and replacement of the detector during the port call at the end of Expedition 375. As a consequence, we were not able t o process any of the XRD data during the expedition. Instead, all o f the scans were finished during a transit to the Philippines followin g IODP Expedition 376 (July 2018), and the data were processed o n shore using MacDiff software (version 4.2.5). We archived the dat a files for each analysis in the LIMS database (saved in RAW file format). The MacDiff software accommodates definition of the baseline, smoothing of counts, and small shifts in peak position t o correct for misalignment of the detector and/or shifts in the heigh t of the specimen surface relative to the X-ray beam. The units fo r peak intensity values are counts/step, and integrated peak areas ar e in units of total counts. Figure F11 shows a representative diffractogram generated by MacDiff, with identification of the diagnosti c peaks for minerals of interest.

Comparisons between MacDiff and DIFFRAC.EVA versions o f the diffractograms, and their sensitivities to different peak manipulation tools, are included in an assessment of error by M.B. Underwood and N. Lawler (unpubl. data). For quantitative analysis o f composition, we computed relative mineral abundance using equations derived from calibrations using standard mineral mixtures. Twenty mixtures of standard minerals with known weight percentages were analyzed twice, both before and after the Bruker detecto r was replaced. Average peak area values were used to solve for polynomial regressions of the relation between integrated peak area an d mineral abundance (Figure F12). Scans of nominally pure calcit e (Cyprus chalk), quartz (St. Peter sandstone), feldspar (plagioclas e mix), and smectite (Ca-montmorillonite $\mathrm{~+~}\mathrm{~Na}$ -montmorillonite ) were included in the regression analyses to anchor the curves a t high concentrations. The amounts of contamination in the nominally pure illite, smectite, and calcite standards were computed b y iteration, and their absolute weight percentages in the total mixtures were recalculated. The regression curves are nonlinear because of asymmetric peak geometries and complex responses o f peak intensity and peak broadening as concentrations of the individual minerals increase. Using the corrected values of weight percent  for  each  major  component  in  the  mixtures,  all  of  th e correlation coefficients are approximately $r=0.99$ (Figure F12).

In most cases, the computed weight percentages of the fou r common minerals (or mineral groups) add up to ${<}100\%$ , so the values were normalized to $100\%$ . Accuracy errors were assessed b y computing the difference between the measured weights of individual standard minerals in the freeze-dried powders and their normalized abundances calculated from the regression equation s (Figure F12). The average errors for the standards are $1.32\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ fo r

total clay minerals, $1.25~\mathrm{wt\%}$ for quartz, $0.93\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ for feldspar, an d $1.02\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ for calcite. We obtained an independent test of accurac y for calcite by comparing XRD-derived weight percent values wit h Ca carbonate values from shipboard coulometric analysis using th e full range of data from Site U1520 (Figure F13). The usual expectation is for the normalized relative percentage of calcite to exceed th e absolute value of $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ . This comparison, however, turned out t o be flawed because of a mismatch between the calcite standar d (nannofossil-rich Cyprus chalk) and variably recrystallized calcit e in the lithified marls and chalks from Site U1520. Peaks intensit y values for the recrystallized calcite are significantly higher tha n those generated by unaltered calcareous nannofossils. As a consequence, some of the computed weight percent values of calcit e (XRD) exceed $100\%$ of the bulk powder (Figure F13). Additiona l documentation of the standards, with representative diffractograms, is provided by M.B. Underwood and N. Lawler (unpubl. data). Their error analysis also includes intralaboratory comparisons between software and interlaboratory comparisons betwee n data generated by the Bruker D4 Endeavor diffractometer on th e JOIDES Resolution versus scans of the same standards using a Panalytical X’Pert Pro diffractometer at the New Mexico Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources.  

The main goal of the bulk powder XRD program during Expedition 375 was to provide reliable relative abundances of dominan t minerals for a large number of specimens over a broad range o f lithologies. Even though the error appears to be small for siliciclastic lithologies (Figure F12), the numerical results are only semiquantitative  and  should  be  interpreted  with  some  caution. Fundamentally, the calculated mineral abundances represent relative percentages in a four-component system of total clay minerals $^+$ quartz $^+$ feldspar $^+$ calcite normalized to $100\%$ . The closeness o f those estimates to absolute percentages in the total solids depend s largely on the abundance of dispersed amorphous solids (e.g., biogenic opal and volcanic glass) and the sum total of all other mineral s that might occur in minor or trace quantities (e.g., pyroxene, pyrite, cristobalite, zeolites, and halite precipitated from interstitial water).  

The mismatches between standards and natural specimens increase if their respective mineral mixtures differ significantly. Fo r example, if other phyllosilicates (e.g., metamorphic white mica an d coarse chlorite crystals) contribute to the peak area value for total clay minerals, especially in silt-rich sediments, their higher crystallinities will result in peak sharpening and skew results to larger estimates of total clay minerals. In addition, values of peak intensity an d peak area for one individual mineral will be influenced not only b y that mineral’s absolute abundance but also by the absolute abundances of all other minerals in the aggregate sample (Fisher and Underwood,  1995).  Another  factor  to  consider,  although  largel y accommodated by the use of standards to calibrate regression equa

tions, is the contrast in peak intensity response between peaks generated by small, poorly crystalline minerals at low diffraction angle s (e.g., clay minerals) and those of highly crystalline minerals a t higher diffraction angles (e.g., quartz and plagioclase).  

All things considered, our accuracy errors for the widespread siliciclastic lithologies cored during Expedition 375 are smaller tha n those documented during other drilling expeditions that attempte d “quantitative” XRD (e.g., Fisher and Underwood, 1995; Shipboar d Scientific Party, 2001; McNeill et al., 2017). Among all of the factor s to consider in the reduction of error, the most important is probabl y the accurate assessment of contaminants in the standards (e.g., percentage of quartz in illite standard) together with recalculation of all weight percentage values. For carbonate lithologies at Site U1520, we reduced the error shown in Figure F13 by substituting the valu e of $C a C O_{3}$ from coulometric analyses for XRD-calcite. We then multiplied the residual $(100\%\mathrm{~-~}\mathrm{CaCO_{3}})$ ) by the relative abundances o f total clay minerals, quartz, and feldspar from XRD. We also reduce d errors by extending the peak area limits for total clay minerals t o include the chlorite (003) reflection (Figure F11).

# Biostratigraphy  

The primary objectives of shipboard biostratigraphic analysi s were to provide age models and develop an integrated biostratigraphy for all drill sites. Secondary objectives were to identif y changes in paleowater depths and intervals of reworking to hel p elucidate the history of sedimentation and deformation along th e Hikurangi margin.  

Preliminary age assignments during Expedition 375 were base d on biostratigraphic analyses using calcareous nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and bolboformids from $5{-}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ long WR samples. Most samples were from core catchers, or th e bases of cores, but additional split-core samples were taken wher e appropriate to better define some datums and zonal boundaries. I n addition to the abundance and preservation of the major microfossi l groups, the presence of other microfossil groups, including shel l fragments, micromollusks, ostracods, otoliths, bryozoan fragments, echinoid spines and plates, fish teeth and remains, radiolarians, diatoms, and sponge spicules, was routinely monitored.  

The 2012 geologic timescale (GTS2012; Gradstein et al., 2012 ) was used during Expedition 375 in conjunction with the New Zealand geological timescale (Raine et al., 2015) to facilitate the integration of the Expedition 375 data with regional geological and seismi c data (Figures F14, F15, F16, F17).  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Calcareous nannofossil zones are based on the scheme of Martini (1971) (NN and NP) with ages calibrated to GTS2012 (Gradstein et al., 2012) (Table T3).  

Considerable variation in the size and morphological features o f species in the genus Gephyrocapsa, which are commonly used a s  

Pleistocene biostratigraphic markers, often causes problems i n identification (e.g., Samtleben, 1980; Su, 1996; Bollmann, 1997). W e utilized size-defined morphological groups of this genus as even t markers (Young, 1998; Maiorano and Marino, $2004;$ Lourens et al., $2004$ ; Raffi et al., 2006), including small Gephyrocapsa spp. $(<\!3.5$ $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , medium Gephyrocapsa spp. $(\ge4~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and large Gephyrocapsa spp. $(\geq\!5.5\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ .  

Differentiation in and between “species” of Reticulofenestra tha t are used as Cenozoic biostratigraphic markers is often problemati c (e.g., Backman, 1980; Su 1996; Young, 1998). We adopt the definition of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus by Young (1998) as havin g a maximum coccolith length $>\!7\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ , with smaller forms recorded a s R. pseudoumbilicus $5\mathrm{-}7\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ .  

Taxonomic concepts for other species follow those of PerchNielsen (1985), Bown (1998, 2005), Dunkley Jones et al. (2009), an d Shamrock and Watkins (2012), as compiled in the online Nannotax3 database (http://www.mikrotax.org/Nannotax3).  

# Methods  

Calcareous nannofossil smear slides were prepared from cor e catcher samples using standard techniques. In some instances, strewn slides were prepared by mixing a small amount of sedimen t in a buffered solution $.\mathrm{pH}=\sim8.5)$ , which was left for 10–15 s to allow larger particles to settle before the suspended sediment wa s transferred with a pipette to a coverslip and placed on a warmin g plate to dry. Once dry, the coverslip was affixed to a glass microscope slide using Norland optical adhesive Number 61 and cure d under ultraviolet light.  

Slides were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope at $400\times$ to $1250\times$ magnification in plane-transmitted light, cross-polarize d light, and phase-contrast light. All light microscope images wer e taken using a Spot RTS system with the IODP Image Capture an d Spot commercial software. Selected samples were observed using  a Hitachi TM3000 scanning electron microscope (SEM) to verify th e presence of small forms.  

Nannofossil preservation was noted as follows:  

• $G=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or overgrowth was observed, primary morphological features are slightly altered, and specimens were identifiable to the species level). • $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (specimens exhibit some dissolution and/or overgrowth, primary morphological features are somewhat altered, but most specimens were identifiable to the species level). • $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{poor}$ (severe dissolution, fragmentation, and/or overgrowth was observed, primary morphological features are largely destroyed, and most specimens could not be identified at the species and/or generic level).  

Intermediate categories (e.g., $\mathrm{G/M}$ or $\mathrm{M}/\mathbf{P}$ ) were used in some case s to better describe the state of preservation of calcareous nannofossil assemblages.  

Total nannofossil abundance in the sediment was visually estimated at $1000\times$ magnification and reported using the following categories:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $590\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of sediment particles).   
• $C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $\langle>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $\mathrm{[\%-10\%}$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no calcareous nannofossils).

Cenozoic and Late Cretaceous chronostratigraphic units $(0{-}101\,\,\mathsf{M a})$ ) and GPTS correlated with calcareous nannofossil zones, modified after Martin i (1971), New Zealand Stages (after Raine et al., 2015), southwest Pacific Neogene bolboformid zones (Crundwell and Nelson, 2007), and Paleogene bolboformi d zones (Spiegler and von Daniels, 1991) used during Expedition 375.

The relative abundance of individual calcareous nannofossi l species or taxa groups was estimated at $1000\times$ magnification an d noted as follows:  

• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant ( $>\!100$ specimens per field of view).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $_{>10-100}$ specimens per field of view).   
• $C=$ common $_{>1-10}$ specimens per field of view).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per 1–10 fields of view).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $_{<1}$ specimen per 10 fields of view).   
• $^{*}=$ reworked (presence of species interpreted to be reworked).   
• $?=$ questionable (questionable specimen of that taxon).  

# Foraminifers and bolboformids  

Locally calibrated ages were used for all Neogene and Quaternary planktonic foraminifer and bolboformid datums based o n Cooper (2004), Crundwell (2004), Crundwell et al. (2004) (Figur e F18), and Crundwell and Nelson (2007). The ages of other planktonic foraminifer datums are from Gradstein et al. (2012), and benthic foraminifer ages are emended after Cooper (2004) (Table T4). Foraminifer criteria for the adopted marine paleoenvironmenta l classification, modified after Hayward et al. (1999), are shown i n Figure F19.  

The taxonomy of Quaternary and Neogene planktonic foraminifers follows a modified version of the phylogenetic classification o f Kennett and Srinivasan (1983). Abbreviations for common gener a and species qualifiers are given in Table T5. Species concepts ar e primarily based on Hornibrook (1981, 1982), Hornibrook et al. (1989),  Scott  et  al.  (1990),  Hornibrook  and  Jenkins  (1994), Crundwell and Nelson (2007), Crundwell (2015a, 2015b), an d Schiebel and Hemleben (2017).  

The taxonomy and biostratigraphy of Paleogene planktonic foraminifers follows Hornibrook et al. (1989), Spezzaferri (1994), Olsson et al. (1999), Pearson et al. (2006), and Pearson and Wad e (2015). The taxonomy and biostratigraphy of Cretaceous planktoni c foraminifers is based primarily on recent taxonomic and biostratigraphic discussions by Petrizzo and Huber (2006), Huber an d Leckie (2011), Huber et al. (2017), and M.R. Petrizzo (pers. comm., 2017). The taxonomy and biostratigraphy of Cenozoic benthic foraminifers is based on Vella (1957), Hornibrook (1961), Hornibrook e t al. (1989), Hayward et al. (1999, 2010, 2013), and Cooper (2004). The taxonomy and biostratigraphy of Neogene bolboformids i s based on Spiegler and von Daniels (1991), Grützmacher (1993),

Spiegler (1999), Spiegler and Spezzaferri (2005), Crundwell et al.   
(2005), and Crundwell and Nelson (2007).  

Qualifiers for taxa identified in this study are as follows:  

• cf. $=$ confer (compare with).   
$\bullet$ aff. $=$ affinis (affinity with).   
• sp. $=$ unidentified species assigned to the genus.   
• spp. $=$ more than one unidentified species assigned to the genus.   
• $?=$ identification uncertain.  

# Methods  

Samples (typically $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ long whole rounds) were prepare d by manually breaking the core into small pieces and soaking them i n hot water with a few drops of detergent. After ${\sim}5{-}10~\mathrm{min}$ , sample s were disaggregated and sieved to $125~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ to remove mud and ver y fine sand. The washed residue retained on the sieve was dried a t $150^{\circ}C$ in an oven and divided with a microsplitter into equal aliquots for examination. As a precaution against cross-contamination,  sieves  were  cleaned  with  jetted  water  and  rinsed  wit h methylene blue solution between successive samples.  

The percentage of planktonic foraminifers relative to total foraminifers was determined quantitatively from random counts of 10 0 foraminifers in the $500{-}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grain size fractions of the washe d microfossil residues. This was done to determine oceanicity (qualitative measure of the extent to which the paleoenvironment recorded by the faunal assemblage represents open ocean condition s relative to a nearshore-influenced environment) and identify samples with reworked material (i.e., typically samples with planktoni c abundance $<\!90\%$ ). Age and depth markers were then picked fro m successive 500–300, 300–212, and $212{-}150\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ grain size fraction s and mounted on 60-division faunal slides coated with gum tragacanth. As time allowed, other species and microfossils were als o picked and mounted on the same slides. In most cases, the 500–21 2 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grain size fraction was examined, although in samples where ag e diagnostic species were difficult to find and from stratigraphic levels where bolboformids were likely to be present, the 212–150 an d $150{-}125\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions were also examined.  

During the examination of microfossil samples, the abundanc e of foraminifers, bolboformids, and other fossil groups in the $150-$ $500\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grain size fractions of washed samples was determined visually and categorized as follows:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant (foraminifers compose ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ of the washed sample).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (foraminifers compose $>\!20\%{-}50\%$ of the washed sample).   
• $C=$ common (foraminifers compose $>\!5\%{-}20\%$ of the washed sample).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (foraminifers compose $1\%{-}5\%$ of the washed sample).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (foraminifers compose ${<}1\%$ of the washed sample).   
• ${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ present (present in sample; abundance undetermined).  

In addition, the preservation of foraminifers and bolboformid s was categorized as follows:  

• $\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (specimens were mostly whole, ornamentation and surface ultrastructure were very well preserved, and no visible modification of the test wall).   
• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (specimens were often whole, ornamentation and surface ultrastructure were preserved but sometimes abraded or overgrown, and visible evidence of modification of the test wall).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (specimens were often etched or broken, ornamentation and surface ultrastructure were modified, and the majority of specimens were identifiable to species level).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (most specimens were crushed or broken, recrystallized, diagenetically overgrown, or infilled with crystalline calcite and most specimens were difficult to identify to species level).  

# Planktonic foraminifers  

Planktonic foraminifer dating was used in conjunction with calcareous nannofossil dating to determine biostratigraphic ages. Planktonic foraminifers were also used to identify changes in marine climate. To achieve this goal, globorotalid species and othe r planktonic foraminifers that are useful for biostratigraphic datin g and warm-water taxa denoting inflows of subtropical water wer e preferentially picked during the examination of samples. As time allowed, representatives of other planktonic species were also picked.  

# Benthic foraminifers  

Benthic foraminifers were the primary paleontological tool use d for estimating paleowater depths (Figure F19). In some instances, they were also used as secondary markers for biostratigraphic dating. Paleowater depths were estimated on the basis of the deepes t calibrated depth marker contained in each sample using the markers given in Figure F19. Displaced shallow-water species (e.g., Hayward et al., 1999) that had been reworked downslope were als o noted to identify redeposited sediment.  

# Bolboformids  

Bolboformids are an extinct group of calcareous microfossil s that are used to supplement calcareous nannofossil and planktoni c foraminifer zonations in mid- to high-latitude regions of Europ e and the Atlantic, southern Indian, and southwest Pacific Ocean s (Poag and Karowe, 1986; Spiegler and von Daniels, 1991; Spiegle r and Müller, 1992; Grützmacher 1993; Spiegler and Spezzaferri, 2005). Bolboformid occurrences of early late Miocene age (8.23– 11.67 Ma) from oceanic sites around New Zealand are unusual i n that they are generally associated with a single species, often in ver y large numbers, and most intervals are associated with a differen t morphologically distinct species (Crundwell et al., 2005; Crundwel l and Nelson, 2007). Bolboformid occurrences of Eocene and earl y

Oligocene age have also been reported on the Campbell Plateau an d in the southern Indian Ocean (Spiegler and Spezzaferri, 2005), bu t to date, no occurrence of this age has been found in New Zealand.

# Paleomagnetism  

The key aim of paleomagnetic analyses was to establish a preliminary magnetostratigraphy that could be combined with biostratigraphic datums to create a chronostratigraphic framework fo r the drill sites. In addition, the paleomagnetic data can be used t o reorient core material with respect to geographic coordinates for interpretation of structural observations. The principal measuremen t routine was as follows:  

1. With a few exceptions, natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archive halves was measured for all sections prior to and following alternating field (AF) demagnetization.   
2. A small number of discrete samples was extracted from sections of interest and subjected to anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements and more detailed thermal or AF demagnetization experiments.   
3. Selected samples were subjected to further rock magnetic analyses.  

# Archive halves  

Archive halves were measured using a triaxial superconductin g rock magnetometer (SRM; 2G Enterprises, model 760R-4K) couple d with a 2G sample degaussing system that allows automated AF demagnetization up to $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ (Figure F20). The system was designe d for continuous measurement of sections as long as $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ and has  a chamber with an $8.2\,\mathrm{cm}$ wide entrance. The response curves for eac h of the superconducting quantum interference device sensors have  a total width of ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{cm}$ (H. Oda and C. Xuan, unpubl. data). Automate d and continuous demagnetization is controlled using the in-hous e IMS-SRM v. 9.2 software (SRM User Guide v. 371 available on th e JOIDES Resolution). Prior to leaving port, a profile of the backgroun d field across the measurement chamber was constructed using a fluxgate magnetometer (Applied Physics, type 520), showing that th e field in the $x_{\cdot},y_{\cdot}$ , and $z\cdot$ -directions does not exceed $0.008\;\mathrm{nT}$ . To minimize noise caused by dirt trapped in the measurement chamber, th e sample tray was demagnetized twice per day using an AF of $40~\mathrm{{mT}}$ followed by measurement of the tray only. This background field usually yields magnetic moments between $4\times10^{-12}$ and $3\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . Core sections were measured at a spacing of $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ . On each end of  a section, an additional $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ was measured as a “header” and “trailer ” to allow for deconvolution during future analysis. All data reported i n the LIMS database are presented both in raw format and correcte d for background field and magnetic drift of the sensors.  

NRM measurements usually yield anomalous components o f magnetization along core due to a viscous remanent magnetizatio n acquired during the drilling process. All cores were thus subjecte d to stepwise AF demagnetization using 4–5 steps up to a peak field o f $40~\mathrm{{mT}}$ or less, and NRM was measured following each demagnetization step. Calculated inclination, declination, and intensity wer e visually inspected using the IMS-SRM v. 9.2 software and, wher e necessary, carefully analyzed using vector component diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967) to verify whether the remanence directions and/o r magnetic polarities determined were of primary origin. Subsequently, variations in declination, inclination, and intensity record s and interpreted polarity sequences with respect to depth below seafloor were displayed using MATLAB.  

# Discrete samples  

Oriented discrete cubes $(7~\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ were extracted from selecte d working halves by pushing a “Natsuhara-Giken” (Japanese) plasti c container into the core with the $z$ -arrow facing upward (Figures F20,  

Figure F20. IODP coordinate systems for archive and working halves and SRM.   
Data uploaded to LIMS database are given in IODP coordinate convention.

F21). For more consolidated material or where the removal of th e cubes resulted in extensive core damage, we first extruded the material from the cores using a similar shaped extraction device prior t o moving them into the plastic containers while retaining the correc t orientation. For thermal demagnetization, samples from moderatel y consolidated sediments were extracted using a $2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2$ cm extruder, marked, and subsequently wrapped in parafilm to provide furthe r stability during NRM and AMS measurements.  

In well-consolidated or crystalline material, $2{\mathrm{~cm}}\times2$ cm cub e samples were cut from the relevant sections using a 2-bladed rin g saw. Discrete sample AMS was measured using an AGICO Kappabridge (model KLY 4) to investigate possible compaction-related inclination shallowing and to identify samples or sections that wer e disturbed during the drilling process. We display the orientations o f the principal axes of magnetic susceptibility $\mathrm{(\chi_{1},\,\chi_{2},\nonumber}$ and $\chi_{3})$ in equalarea stereoplots and calculate the anisotropy of foliation $\left(F\right)=\Upsilon_{2}/\Upsilon_{3}$ and the lineation $\begin{array}{r}{\left(L\right)=\mathrm{\chi_{1}}/\mathrm{\chi_{2}}}\end{array}$ where $\Upsilon_{1}$ corresponds to the axis tha t aligns with the highest degree of magnetic susceptibility and $\mathrm{X}_{1}>\mathrm{X}_{2}$ $>\mathrm{{X}}_{3}$ , using AGICO’s Anisoft software.  

Subsequently, each specimen’s NRM was measured using  a spinner magnetometer (AGICO model JR-6A; sensitivity: ${\sim}2\times10^{6}$ $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m})$ , followed by more detailed stepwise AF or thermal demagnetization up to $100~\mathrm{mT}$ or $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. Demagnetization increments were matched to the coercivity or blocking temperatur e distributions of each sample, and experiments were complete d when either a characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) direction could be clearly identified or when NRM intensity decreased below $10\%$ of its initial value.  

AF demagnetization was conducted along three axes using  a DTECH (model D-2000) AF demagnetizer. During early AF demagnetization experiments at Site U1518, many samples acquired a remanence that is aligned roughly perpendicular to the last directio n of the applied alternating current field (here: $\pm x$ -axis). We interpreted this behavior to be the acquisition of a gyroremanent magnetization (GRM) similar to that which has frequently been describe d in association with authigenic greigite $\mathrm{(Fe_{3}S_{4})}$ in marine or lacustrin e sediments (Dankers and Zijderveld, 1981; Hu et al., 2002; Pandey e t al., 2016; Snowball, 1997). To correct for the effects of GRM, a small number of specimens were demagnetized following Stephenso n (1993). For each demagnetization step, samples were first demagnetized along all three axes ending on $+x$ , measured, subsequently demagnetized along $-z,$ measured, and finally demagnetized along $+y$ and measured. The average was calculated for each $x,\,y_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and $z$ measurement, respectively, and the field vector was calculated.  

Thermal demagnetization was conducted using ASC Scientific’ s model TD-48SC thermal demagnetizer. Samples were heated and hel d at their respective temperature increments for $30\,\mathrm{\min}$ , cooled, an d subsequently measured. Bulk magnetic susceptibility was monitore d following each heating increment using the Kappabridge to identify alteration of the magnetic remanence caused by the heating procedure.  

Demagnetization data for all discrete specimens were displaye d in vector component diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967), and ChRM directions were calculated from the best-fitting component by principa l component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980) using PuffinPlot v. 1.0. 3 (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012).  

Following AF demagnetization and if time allowed, samples wer e further subjected to rock magnetic analysis with a focus on studyin g the distribution of populations of grains of different coercivity. W e subjected samples to an impulse field along the $+z$ -axis using an AS C impulse magnetizer (model IM-10), measured the $\mathrm{IRM}_{\mathrm{1T}},$ applied a n isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) at a $300\;\mathrm{mT}$ impulse fiel d along the $-z$ -axis $\mathrm{(IRM}_{-300\mathrm{mT}})$ , and calculated $S_{-300\mathrm{mT}}$ and $\mathrm{IRM}_{\mathrm{1T}}/\chi$ ratios. The ratio $S_{-300\mathrm{mT}}=[(\mathrm{IRM}_{-300\mathrm{mT}}/\mathrm{IRM}_{\mathrm{1T}})+1]/2$ helps to isolate contributions of grains with high coercivity (e.g., hematite, goethite, an d some iron sulfides), whereas the $\mathrm{IRM}_{\mathrm{1T}}/\chi$ ratio is sensitive to the presence of authigenic greigite (Kars and Kodama, 2015; Liu et al., 2012).  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Magnetic polarity transitions were determined primarily base d on inclination data. Assuming that the magnetic field resemble s that of a geocentric axial dipole (GAD) field, the expected inclination can be calculated using (Butler, 2004)  

$$
\tan(\mathrm{Inc})=2\mathrm{tan}(\mathrm{lat}),
$$  

where Inc is the inclination and lat is the site latitude. At $39^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ latitude, we expect an inclination of $-58^{\circ}$ in a normal polarity field. Identified magnetozones were integrated with biostratigraphic datums (see Biostratigraphy) and mapped to the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) of Gradstein et al. (2012) where possible (Tabl e T6). The GPTS of Gradstein et al. (2012) was chosen to be consistent with the calibration of the New Zealand geological timescal e (Raine et al., 2015) used for the determination and correlation o f New Zealand stratigraphic stages (de facto biozones).  

# Coordinate systems  

The magnetic data sets presented are displayed relative to th e standard IODP coordinate system (Figure F20) with $+z$ pointin g downcore and $+x$ pointing toward the double lines at the bottom o f the working half and thus away from the archive half. The SRM coordinate system is inverted with respect to IODP coordinate s $\left(+z_{\mathrm{IODP}}=-z_{\mathrm{SRM}}\right)$ . Conversion from SRM to IODP coordinates is thu s required prior to data display, which occurs prior to data upload int o the LIMS database. All paleomagnetic data (declination and inclination) discussed here refer to this convention. The coordinate syste m of the discrete specimens follows the convention of the workin g halves.  

# Core reorientation  

Two different tools (Icefield MI-5 multishot and FlexIT) allo w for direct orientation of APC cores with an estimated accuracy o f $20^{\circ}{-30^{\circ}}$ (McNeill et al., 2017). Unfortunately, the azimuthal data recovered during this expedition were inconclusive, thus requirin g the orientation of the recovered cores based on paleomagnetic dat a sets. Reorientation using paleomagnetic data sets relies on thre e major assumptions:  

• The reference paleomagnetic position of the drill site at the time of emplacement of the recovered sediment is known or the site has not experienced any vertical axis rotations since emplacement. • The record is long enough to average out secular variation, thus averaging to a GAD direction (e.g., see Merill et al., 1996). • The paleomagnetic records are not biased by incomplete core recovery or material disturbance caused during deposition and/or core recovery.  

For the reorientation of APC cores to geographic coordinates , we calculate a mean and cone of $95\%$ confidence $(\alpha_{95})$ followin g Fisher statistics (Fisher, 1953) for all measurements made at th e peak demagnetization step for each of the cores independently. In  a normal polarity field, dip directions that are provided in relation t o the double lines on the core liner ( $+x$ -axis) can be corrected by subtracting the mean declination value. The error in declinatio n (ΔDec) is calculated from the $95\%$ confidence cone using  

$$
\Delta\mathrm{Dec}=\upalpha_{95}/\mathrm{cos}(\mathrm{Inc}).
$$  

XCB and RCB cores were commonly dissected into a number o f $5{-}20\ \mathrm{~cm~}$ long subhorizontal biscuits. In this case, we measure d NRM directions with declinations that were systematically offse t across biscuit boundaries, coherent with the azimuthal rotation o f individual biscuits during drilling. For structural reorientation, w e “handpicked” a mean declination for each individual biscuit. Fo r samples from normal polarity intervals, we subtracted the mea n declination from each biscuit; for samples from reversed polarit y intervals, we subtracted the mean and added $180^{\circ}$ . Note that the incomplete sampling of secular variation and data smearing due to th e instrument response produces errors, probably in the range of $20^{\circ}-$ $40^{\circ}$ . Reorientations were carried out only when measurement s showed multiple consistent declinations.

# Structural geology  

Our principal objective was to record structures observed in the core and their orientations. These data will contribute to our aim of investigating the processes and in situ conditions of shallow subduction zone slow slip events. The structural data will also assist in interpretations of bedding and fracture orientations observed in Expedition 372 LWD data and integrating core, seismic, and downhole observations. These objectives were achieved by making detailed structural observations and measurements following methods used during previous expeditions, with modifications to more fully describe structures encountered during Expedition 375.  

The methods for documenting structural features in Expedition 375 cores largely follow those of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 334 and 344 and IODP Expeditions 352, 360, and 362 (Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012; Harris et al., 2013; Reagan et al.,  

2015; MacLeod et al., 2017; McNeill et al., 2017). Blenkinsop and Doyle (2010) also provide a discussion of measuring planar structures in core. Structures observed in the split cores were classified and quantified in terms of depth extent, orientation, and if possible, sense and magnitude of displacement. Each structure was recorded manually on a description table sheet at the core table (scans are available in VCD_HAND in STRUCTURE in Supplementary material). For planar structures, the dip, strike, and dip direction were computed from apparent orientation measurements using trigonometric transformations applied in an Excel spreadsheet (see CALCULATION in STRUCTURE in Supplementary material). The resulting orientations defined in a core reference frame were then logged via the DESClogik interface to the LIMS database, together with other descriptive information about each structure and the material the structure occurs in (see Visual core descriptions; Figure F3).  

# Structural data acquisition and orientation measurements  

The current basis for making quantitative measurements wa s defined during Expedition 334 (Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012 ) and further modified during Expeditions 344, 352, and 362 (Harri s et al., 2013; Reagan et al., 2015; McNeill et al., 2017).  

We used a plastic protractor for orientation measurements (Figure F22). This measurement process was performed on the workin g half because it provided greater flexibility in removing—and cutting, if necessary—pieces of the core for structural measurements. Orientations of planar and linear features in cores were determine d relative to the core axis, which represents the vertical axis in th e core reference frame, and to the split line marked on the workin g half of the split-core liner. The split line represents $000^{\circ}$ (and $360^{\circ}$ ) in the plane perpendicular to the core axis (Figure F23); $000^{\circ}$ wa s defined as perpendicular to the cut surface toward the working hal f of the core, and $180^{\circ}$ was then defined toward the archive half of th e core.  

To determine the orientation of a planar structural element, apparent dips were measured in two independent sections in the cor e reference frame. One apparent dip is represented by the intersection of the planar feature with the split face of the core and is quantified by measuring the plunge and trend of this line in the cor e reference frame (Figure F24). Such a measurement has a trend o f either $090^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ and ranges in plunge from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ $\lvert\alpha_{1}$ and $\upbeta_{1},$ respectively, Figure F24). A second apparent dip is represented b y the intersection of the planar feature and a cut or fractured surfac e at a high angle to the split face of the core. In most cases, this surface lies either parallel or perpendicular to the core axis. When parallel, the apparent dip trace trends $000^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$ and plunges from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ $\overline{{\alpha}}_{2}$ and $\upbeta_{2},$ respectively, Figure F24); when perpendicular, th e trend ranges from $000^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ and plunges $0^{\circ}$ . Linear features observed in cores are typically defined by a trend and plunge in th e core reference frame, as for the apparent dips described above. Where appropriate, lines may also be associated with planar structures (e.g., a striation on a fault plane) and their orientations determined by measuring the rake on the associated plane. As a n example, for a fault with striations, the apparent rake angle of th e striation $\left(\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ was measured on the fault surface from either the $090^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ direction of the split-core surface trace (Figure F25). Faul t orientation was calculated from the two apparent dips as describe d above.  

For planar structures, the two apparent dips were converted to  a plane in the core reference frame represented by a dip angle,  a strike, and a dip direction using an Excel spreadsheet (see CALCULATION in STRUCTURE in Supplementary material) (Figur e F26). A rake angle $(\Phi)$ relative to the strike line in the core referenc e frame was similarly calculated trigonometrically in this Exce l spreadsheet. Detailed methods for this are described by McNeill e t al. (2017). We also confirmed conversions from apparent dips an d rakes to orientations of planes and lines graphically using the Stereonet 9.8 software (Cardozo and Allmendinger, 2013) for selected examples.  

Registration of orientation data from the core reference frame t o a true geographic reference frame using paleomagnetic data wa s possible for some intervals (Figure F26). For these calculations, w e followed methods used during past IODP expeditions and detaile d by McNeill et al. (2017). Azimuthal core orientation was determined based on paleomagnetic declination measurements obtaine d

from the continuous magnetic remanence data collected for eac h core section, adjusted for geomagnetic polarity intervals (interpreted from correlations with the GPTS and biostratigraphic constraints) (see Paleomagnetism for details). Variability in bot h inclination and declination values introduces uncertainty in thos e orientation corrections. To be used for reorientations, declination s were required to be consistent (within ${\sim}30^{\circ}$ range) over ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals in unbiscuited intervals containing no polarity reversals. Th e application of this method was not possible in intervals with sever e core disturbance, including biscuiting on a centimeter scale or less,

upwarped bedding, or midcore flow. The presence of MTDs o r other zones of intense soft-sediment deformation also introduce d challenges for core reorientations. However, many of these zones o f sediment deformation occurred in coherent zones where relativ e rotations were minimal, in which case more reliable declinatio n data from the bracketing zones could be used to reorient the structures.  

Recognizing that it may be difficult to accurately measure orientations in cores, orientation measurements are accompanied by  a confidence level from 1 to 3. A Level 3 measurement is one fo r which it was easy to define and measure the structure, it is unlikel y to have been modified by drilling disturbance, and confidence i s high. A Level 1 measurement is one for which it was difficult to define and/or measure the feature accurately and it is uncertai n whether it has been modified by drilling disturbance. This confidence level also includes, where applicable, whether the sense of sli p is uniquely determined by the observations. For faults and shea r zones, the highest confidence is only assigned if offset marker horizons are visible in the core and/or if striations define slip directio n (e.g., dip-slip versus strike-slip).  

# Description and classification of structures  

We constructed a structural geology template for DESClogi k that aids in the description and classification of observed structures. We define the terminology used to describe deformation structures, both for clarity and as the basis for differentiating natural structure s from drilling-induced features. We adopt a descriptive hierarch y (see DESC_WKB in Supplementary material) for our structural classification in which we first define a structure type (e.g., fault, fracture, fold, deformation band, fabric, bedding, etc.) and then ad d a secondary descriptor to further classify the structure. Fracture s are described as open or closed, and displacement sense is noted fo r faults and shear bands: normal, reverse, strike slip, or indeterminate. An indeterminate fault is one in which the surface has slickenlines that suggest displacement but without sufficient markers t o define the sense of slip. We define deformation bands as continuou s features that can be divided into shear bands (which show evidenc e of shear displacement), compaction bands, dilation bands, and indeterminate deformation bands for which it was not possible to determine the type of strain accommodated. Faults are distinguishe d from shear bands because they contain at least one discrete discontinuity along which shear displacement has occurred. Both fault s and deformation bands, however, are tabular features and therefor e have a thickness that was determined when possible. The internal structure of both faults and deformation bands is noted with additional qualifiers (Riedel shears, S-C structures, planar fabrics, gouge, cataclasite, and breccia) and a grain size if determined. Fo r zones with a penetrative, spaced, or distributed fabric, a fabric typ e of planar, anastomosing, or stylolitic is recorded for that interval o f the core. Additional geometrical descriptors used to define th e morphology of the various features include planar, wavy, curved, o r anastomosing planar features, open and tight folds, and en echelo n and sigmoidal fractures.  

Veins are recorded as filled fractures, and additional qualifyin g observations include their mineralogy and internal structure. Additional information, such as relations between vein and wall rock, ar e included in the comments section of the vein description. Orientations of veins, clastic dikes, distributed fabrics, and other structural features are part of the routine structural description.  

Recognizing that uncertainty often occurs in objectively defining structures as either natural (sedimentary or tectonic) or drillin g induced, we assign an interpretation probability level to each observation both to minimize the potential for any conflict and to identify all observations in the database that remain equivocal; th e intent is to provide the means to include or exclude observations i n post-expedition analyses based on confidence thresholds. Th e probability scale is defined from 0 to 1, where 0 is no confidenc e that the observed structure is natural (i.e., a fault is drilling induce d with $100\%$ certainty) and 1 is perfect confidence in a tectonic o r synsedimentary origin (McNeill et al., 2017). In practice, probabilit y values range from 0.1 to 0.9 to maintain some possibility that an y individual structure may have a component of natural or drillinginduced deformation.  

# Fracture intensity assessment  

The cores contain an abundance of brittle deformation, including fractures (both open and filled), faults, and brecciated zones. Because these features commonly denote distinct deformational domains or damage zones, we carried out a systematic first-orde r assessment of the abundance of such brittle features, which we refe r to as fracture intensity. The assessment was conducted over $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals, and the abundance of brittle features in each interval wa s logged independently of their orientations.

• $1=-1$ fracture/m ${\tt>}1\;\mathrm{m}$ spacing).   
• $2=1–10$ fractures/m (1 dm to 1 m spacing).   
• $3=>\!10{-}100$ fractures $\prime_{\mathrm{m}}$ (1 cm to 1 dm spacing).

Thus, Fracture Intensity 1 records long unfractured sections o f core and Fracture Intensity 5 denotes intensely brecciated zones. T o define a continuous distribution of fracture intensities over longe r intervals, fracture intensity assessments were then averaged ove r core sections (i.e., as long as $1.5\:\mathrm{m}$ ). Fracture intensity is plotted as  a function of depth for Sites U1518 and U1520 where coring wa s more continuous and where abundant brittle deformation occurred.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Drilling disturbance was evident in many of the recovered core s and affected our ability to recognize and describe original sedimentary and tectonic structures. Drilling-induced folding and distortio n of beds occurred in APC cores, including upward-arching and mingled and distorted beds caused by suction of the materials into th e core barrel. XCB and RCB drilling led to induced faults, fractures, and breccias, as well as to biscuiting of cored intervals. Drilling-induced gouge is commonly formed between biscuits by relative rotation of drilling cuttings and injection of material. Other corin g disturbances, such as fall-in, soupy texture, gas expansion, core extension, and voids, also occurred. Generally, we followed previou s practice and terminology (e.g., Jutzeler et al., 2014; McNeill et al., 2017) in our description of drilling disturbance and categories o f drilling disturbance intensity (slight, moderate, severe, and destroyed). These observations were logged during core descriptio n (see DESC_WKB in Supplementary material). Table T7 lists th e criteria used.  

# DESClogik program  

DESClogik is a program used to store a visual (macroscopi c and/or microscopic) description of core structures at a given dept h and to upload them to the LIMS database. During Expedition 375, only the locations of structural features, calculated orientations i n the core reference frame, and restored orientations based on th e paleomagnetic data were input into DESClogik alongside descriptive details. Calculation of 3-D orientations in the core referenc e frame from measured apparent dips were made with a spreadshee t as described above and are available as supplementary tables (se e STRUCTURE in Supplementary material).  

# Geochemistry  

The concentration of dissolved species in pore water and thei r isotopic composition provide data to identify fluid sources and flo w pathways and to quantify fluid–rock reactions and the formation o f authigenic minerals. In addition, pore water chemical profiles ar e essential for characterizing biogeochemical cycling and the distribution and concentration of methane hydrate. The distribution o f pore water samples during Expedition 375 and the pore water analytical program are shown in Table T8.  

# Pore water collection  

In general, pore water sampling was conducted on WR sample s that were collected from recovered core at a resolution of six W R samples per core in the upper $20\;\mathrm{m}$ , three WR samples per core between 20 and 40 mbsf, and $1{-}2\;\mathrm{WR}$ samples per core from 40 mbs f to the bottom of the hole. WR length increased with depth fro m ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm}$ in the shallow cores to ${>}40~\mathrm{cm}$ in the deepest cores to account for the lower water content in more consolidated sediment a t depth. Pore water samples were analyzed shipboard for a range o f species and preserved for post-expedition research as detailed i n Table T8. Details for the sampling protocol at each site are given i n the corresponding site chapters.  

For headspace analyses of gas composition and concentrations , sediment plugs were routinely collected in two sections per core immediately adjacent to the pore water WR sample. In addition, voi d gas samples were collected for shipboard hydrocarbon analyse s when present. Starting at 30 mbsf, each core was scanned with an I R camera to identify the presence of methane hydrate, indicated b y anomalously cold sections resulting from endothermic methane hydrate dissociation during core recovery. These IR anomalies guide d the selection of pore water samples on the catwalk and ensured tha t we sampled sediments representing background conditions (no t impacted by methane hydrate dissociation during core recovery). I n addition, we collected a small number of WR samples for IW analysis where gas hydrates were inferred based on IR scans to quantif y methane hydrate concentrations. These pore water–based estimates are useful for verifying the methane hydrate saturation calculations from LWD resistivity data collected during Expedition 372.  

WR samples were cut on the catwalk, capped, and taken to th e laboratory for processing. During high-resolution sampling, whe n there were too many IW WRs to process immediately, capped WR s were stored under a nitrogen atmosphere at $4^{\circ}C$ until they wer e squeezed, which occurred no later than $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ after core retrieval. After extrusion from the core liner, the surface of each WR was carefully scraped with a spatula to remove potential contamination fro m seawater and sediment smearing in the borehole. For APC cores, ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{cm}$ of material from the outer diameter, top, and bottom face s were removed, whereas for XCB and RCB cores where contamination is more prevalent, as much as two-thirds of the sediment wa s removed from each WR. The remaining sediment $({\sim}50{-}300~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ ) was placed into a titanium squeezer modified after the stainles s steel squeezer of Manheim and Sayles (1974). Gauge forces to  a maximum of 30,000 lb were applied using a laboratory hydrauli c press to extract pore water. Pore water was passed through a prewashed Whatman Number 1 filter fitted above a titanium scree n and extruded into a precleaned $(10\%\,\mathrm{\HNO_{3}})$ plastic syringe attached to the bottom of the squeezer assembly. Pore water was the n dispensed from the syringe through a $0.2~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ Gelman polysulfon e disposable filter into shipboard and shore-based sample container s and preserved for various analyses.  

A few WR samples designated for He isotopic analysis were als o cut on the catwalk and capped. Samples were immediately transferred to a special processing and squeezing station set up in the refrigerated core storage repository located on the lowermost deck o f the JOIDES Resolution. This refrigerated repository is a He-free environment kept at $4^{\circ}C_{:}$ , whereas the shipboard chemistry laborator y uses He as a carrier gas for the gas chromatographs (GCs) and carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS) elemental analyzer. Th e samples were cleaned in a glove bag, squeezed, and transferred int o copper tubing that was previously flushed with ultrahigh-purity $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and crimped.  

# Shipboard pore water analyses  

We undertook key geochemical analyses on the ship and collected pore water samples for post-expedition studies. Sample allocation was determined based on the pore water volume recovere d and analytical priorities based on the expedition objectives (Tabl e T8). Pore water samples were analyzed on board following the protocols in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IOD P user manuals available on board.  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately afte r squeezing following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinit y was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handhel d refractometer, $\mathsf{p H}$ was measured with a combination glass electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with an autotitrator (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) using 0.1 M HCl. International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater and in-house 10, 20, and $40\;\mathrm{mM}\;\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ were use d as calibration standards for the alkalinity determinations; in addition, an IAPSO sample was analyzed at the beginning and end of  a set of samples for each site and after approximately every 10 samples. The average accuracy and precision of the alkalinity measurements based on repeat analysis of IAPSO standard seawater and th e $20\;\mathrm{mM}$ reference standard were $<\!2.5\%$ and $-2\%$ , respectively.  

# Chloride measured by titration with $\mathsf{\pmb A g N O_{3}}$  

High-precision chloride concentrations were measured with  a Metrohm 785 DMP autotitrator via silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ ) titratio n and were calibrated against repeated titrations of IAPSO standar d seawater. Each sample was analyzed twice by titration and averaged, and some samples were analyzed in triplicate. For each replicate,  a $0.1\,\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of sample was diluted with $4\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $2.2\,\mathrm{M}$ trace metal grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and titrated with a $0.1\ \mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{AgNO_{3}}$ solution. Repeate d analyses of the IAPSO standard yielded a precision better than $0.3\%$ .

# Chloride, bromide, and sulfate measured by ion chromatography  

Chloride $\left(C\mathrm{{l}-}\right)$ , bromide $\left(\mathbf{B}\mathbf{r}^{-}\right)$ , and sulfate $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ ) were analyze d by ion chromatograph (IC) on a Metrohm 850 Professional IC. Aliquots of $100\,\mathrm{\upmuL}$ were diluted 1:100 with ultrapure water (18. 2 ${\mathrm{M}}{\Omega}{\cdot}{\mathrm{cm}})$ , and eluent solutions of $3.2\,\mathrm{\mM}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $1.0\,\mathrm{\mM}$ $\mathrm{NaHCO_{3}}$ were used. Calibration standards had IAPSO dilution factors of 50, 67, 100, 150, 200, 350, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, and 8000. Samples were diluted 100 times. Calibration standard s with dilution factors of 50–500 were used to construct a calibratio n curve for samples with higher sulfate concentrations $(5{-}29\ \mathrm{mM})$ , and calibration standards with dilution factors between 750 an d 8000 were used for samples close to the sulfate–methane transitio n zone (SMTZ) and below, where in situ sulfate concentrations ar e low. Thus, we used two separate calibration curves for the sulfat e analyses but only used the higher concentration calibration curv e for the Cl and Br analyses. A drift standard was measured after fiv e samples for six cycles, after which three extra standards were analyzed as an accuracy check. For reproducibility, ${>}5$ sample replicate s were analyzed during each run. The accuracy of the Cl, Br, and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ analyses via IC was $<\!0.4\%$ , ${<}1\%$ , and ${<}1\%$ , respectively. The precision of the Cl, Br, and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ analyses was $<\!0.3\%$ , $<\!1\%$ , and ${<}1\%$ , respectively. We report Cl values from both IC and titration but plo t only the titration data, which yielded better precision. Likewise, w e report sulfate concentrations from both the IC and inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).  

Below the SMTZ, sulfate is depleted in the pore water and an y sulfate present in a sample is a result of contamination with surfac e seawater that was pumped downhole while drilling. Drilling flui d was sampled at every site and analyzed as part of the shipboard geochemical program. Based on the sulfate concentration of each I W sample below the SMTZ, we used the chemical composition of th e drilling water to correct each analysis for contamination using th e following equations:  

$$
f_{\mathrm{SW}}=[\mathrm{SO}_{4}]_{\mathrm{meas}}/[\mathrm{SO}_{4}]_{\mathrm{SW}},
$$  

$$
f_{\mathrm{PW}}=1-f_{\mathrm{SW}},
$$  

$$
[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{corr}}=[[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{meas}}-(f_{\mathrm{SW}}\times[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{SW}})]/f_{\mathrm{PW}},
$$  

where  

$f_{\mathrm{Sw}}=$ fraction of a pore fluid sample that is contaminated with drilling fluid, $f_{\mathrm{pw}}=$ fraction of uncontaminated pore water in a sample, $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{corr}}=$ corrected value of a solute (e.g., Cl, Ca, Sr, etc.), $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{meas}}=$ measured concentration of that solute, and $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{SW}}=$ concentration of the solute in the drilling fluid.  

# Ammonium, phosphate, and silica by colorimetry  

Ammonium, phosphate, and silica concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry using an Agilent Technologies Car y Series 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer with an autosampler. Ammonium concentrations were determined using the method describe d in Solórzano (1969), and orthophosphate was measured using th e ammonium molybdate method described in Gieskes et al. (1991). Dissolved silica was also measured spectrophotometrically usin g the method based on the production of a yellow silicomolybdat e complex. The complex is reduced by ascorbic acid to form molybdenum blue and measured at $812\ \mathrm{nm}$ . In-house calibration standards were prepared for each of the colorimetric analyses tha t bracket the concentration range expected in the pore water. For th e ammonium concentration analyses, standards ranged from 50 t o $1000~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ and the pore water samples were diluted into this range. Each batch of analyses also consisted of multiple check standard s and drift standards analyzed after every 5 samples. The accuracy o f the ammonium and silica analyses based on repeated analyses of th e standards was $<\!2.5\%$ and $<\!2\%$ , respectively. The precision of th e ammonium and silica analyses based on repeated analysis of drif t standards spanning the anticipated in situ concentration range wa s $<\!2.5\%$ and $-2\%$ , respectively.  

# Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium measured by ion chromatography  

IC analyses were conducted using the same 1:100 aliquot dilutions with ultrapure water as those used for anions. The eluent solutions used for cation measurements were $3.2\;\mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and 1. 7 mM PDCA (pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) supplied by Metroh m (CAS#499-83-2). Check standards were run throughout each batc h of analyses, and multiple drift standards bracketing the range of anticipated pore water concentrations were analyzed after every  5 samples. Standards were prepared by dilution of IAPSO standar d seawater with dilution factors of 50, 67, 100 (same as the samples), 150, 200, and 350. Analytical precision based on repeated analysis o f drift and check standards was $<\!2.5\%$ , $-2\%$ , ${<}1\%$ , and $<\!0.8\%$ for calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium, respectively. Accurac y of the analyses was $<\!2.5\%$ , $-2\%$ , $-2\%$ , and $<\!0.7\%$ for calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium, respectively.  

# Major and minor elements measured by ICP-AES  

Dissolved major (Na, K, Ca, Mg, and total S) and minor (Li, Sr , B, Si, Mn, Fe, Ba, and total P) element concentrations were determined by an Agilent 5110 ICP-AES with an SPS4 autosampler.  

For the shipboard ICP-AES analyses of IW samples, we modified the analytical procedures developed during IODP Expedition s 372 and 371. Each IW sample used for major element concentratio n analyses was diluted at 1:10 using $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and spiked with $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a 10 ppm Y, In, and Sc solution as an internal standard. For calibration, serial dilutions of IAPSO standard seawater $(1\%,\,5\%$ , $10\%$ , $25\%$ , $50\%$ , $75\%$ , $100\%$ , and $200\%$ ) were prepared to bracket the rang e of concentrations anticipated in cores. Calibration standards for th e minor element analyses were prepared from Spex Certiprep primary reference standards. Dilutions of the primary standard t o bracket the range in anticipated pore water concentrations wer e matrix matched to achieve $3.5\,\mathrm{g/L}$ NaCl in each standard.  

During each ICP-AES run, a complete set of all in-house an d IAPSO dilutions were analyzed at the beginning and end of eac h batch. Furthermore, several standards that span the range of anticipated pore water concentrations were analyzed every 8–10 sample s to monitor instrument drift and determine analytical precision an d accuracy. The elemental concentrations reported for each sampl e were average values from three replicate integrations from eac h sample measured consecutively via continuous flow, as set by instrumental parameters. Analytical precision was based on repea t analysis of standards that span the range of anticipated in situ concentrations and is as follows for each element: $\mathrm{Ca}<0.6\%$ , $\mathrm{Mg}<0.6\%$ $\mathrm{K}<0.5\%$ , $\mathrm{Na}<1\%$ , total $S<0.5\%$ , $\mathrm{Li}<0.7\%$ , $\mathrm{B}<2\%$ , $\mathrm{Sr}<0.5\%$ , $\mathtt{B a}<$ $0.4\%$ , Fe $<0.8\%$ , $\mathrm{Mn}<0.7\%$ , total $\mathrm{P}<1\%$ , and $\mathrm{Si}<0.7\%$ . Analytical accuracy for each element was based on repeat analysis of standard s that span the range of anticipated in situ concentrations and is a s follows: $C a<0.4\%$ , $\mathrm{Mg}<0.3\%_{\mathrm{{:}}}$ , $\mathrm{K}<0.8\%$ , $\mathrm{Na}<1.5\%$ , total $S<1\%$ , L i $<2.5\%$ , $B<1.3\%$ , $\mathrm{Sr}<1.5\%$ , $\mathrm{Ba}<1\%$ , $\mathrm{Fe}<0.5\%$ , $\mathrm{Mn}<0.5\%$ , total $\mathrm{P}<$ $1.2\%$ , and $\mathrm{Si}<0.5\%$ .  

# Organic geochemistry  

Expulsion of pore water and hydrocarbons produced by diagenetic and low-grade metamorphic reactions can provide usefu l tracers of fluid origin and subduction margin hydrogeologic processes (i.e., Kastner et al., 2014). Routine analysis of hydrocarbo n gas in sediment cores is also a key element of IODP standard shipboard safety monitoring.  

Analysis of gas samples obtained from sediment samples (headspace analysis) following the procedures described by Kvenvolde n and McDonald (1986) is the most common method used for hydrocarbon monitoring during IODP expeditions. When gas pocket s were detected, the free gas was sampled from the sediment void using a syringe attached to a hollow stainless steel tool used to puncture the core liner. The gas was then analyzed on a GC–flam e ionization detector (GC-FID). For headspace analyses, a $3\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sediment sample was collected from the freshly exposed top end of  a core section and next to the IW sample immediately after core retrieval using a plastic syringe or brass boring tool. The sedimen t plug was placed in a $20~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ headspace vial and capped and seale d with a septum and aluminum crimp seal. The vial was then heate d to $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{min}$ to evolve hydrocarbon gases from the sediment. When consolidated or lithified samples were encountered, chips of material were placed in the vial and sealed. For gas chromatographic analyses, a $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ volume of headspace gas was extracted from the capped sample using a standard gas syringe an d analyzed by gas chromatography.  

Headspace and void gas samples were injected directly into th e GC-FID or into the natural gas analyzer (NGA). The headspac e samples were analyzed using an Agilent/HP 6890 Series II gas chromatograph (GC3) equipped with an 8 ft, $2.00\:\mathrm{mm}$ inside diameter $\times$ $\%$ inch outside diameter stainless steel column packed with 80/10 0 mesh HayeSep R and an FID set at $250^{\circ}C$ . The GC3 oven was programmed to hold temperature at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8.25~\mathrm{{\min}}$ , ramp a t $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ to $150^{\circ}C$ , hold for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ , and return to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ postrun fo r a total of $15\;\mathrm{min}$ . Helium was used as the carrier gas. The GC3 system determines concentrations of methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethen e $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ .  

Data were collected using the Hewlett Packard 3365 Chemstation data processing program. Chromatographic response is calibrated to nine different gas standards with variable quantities of lo w molecular weight hydrocarbons. The gas concentrations for required safety analyses are expressed as component parts per millio n by volume (ppmv) in the analyzed gas.  

# Sediment geochemistry  

For the shipboard sediment geochemistry analyses, $3~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ o f sediment was freeze-dried for ${\sim}24\,\mathrm{h}$ , crushed to a fine powder usin g a pestle and agate mortar, and sampled to analyze inorganic carbon, total carbon (TC), and total nitrogen (TN) and for source rock analyses.  

# Elemental analysis  

The TC and TN of sediment samples were determined with  a ThermoElectron Corporation FlashEA 1112 CHNS elemental analyzer equipped with a ThermoElectron CHNS/nitrogen-carbonsulfur packed column and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).  

Approximately $10{-}15\,\mathrm{~mg}$ of freeze-dried, ground sediment wa s weighed in a tin cup, and the sample was combusted at $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in  a stream of oxygen. The reaction gases were passed through a reduction chamber to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and were the n separated by gas chromatography before detection by TCD. All measurements were calibrated to a standard sediment referenc e material (2704 Buffalo River Sediment; PWQR7837591) for TC an d TN detection, which was run every 10 samples. The detection limi t was $0.001\%$ for TN (instrument limit) and $0.002\%$ for TC (procedural blank; measured as an empty tin cup). Sample replicates $\left(N=\right.$ 10 for each of 5 samples) yielded precisions of ${<}10\%$ of measure d values for TN and $-7\%$ of measured values for TC.  

# Inorganic and organic carbon content  

Total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations were determine d using a UIC CM5015 coulometer. Between 10 and $15~\mathrm{mg}$ of freezedried, ground sediment was weighed and reacted with $2\ \mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{HCl}$ . The liberated $C O_{2}$ was titrated, and the end point was determine d by a photodetector. Calcium carbonate content expressed as weigh t percent was calculated from the TIC content assuming that all evolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was derived from dissolution of $C a C O_{3}$ , using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\times8.33\;(w t\%).}
$$  

No correction was made for the presence of other carbonat e minerals. Accuracy during individual batches of analyses was determined by running a carbonate standard $(100\;\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{CaCO}_{3})$ every 1 0 samples. Typical precision, assessed using replicate analyses of  a carbonate sample $\mathit{N}=10$ for each of 5 samples), was $2\%$ . The detection limit for $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ , defined here as $3\times$ the standard deviation o f the blank $\left(2\,\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{HCl}\right)$ , was $0.1\%$ . Total organic carbon (TOC) conten t was calculated as the difference between TC (measured on the elemental analyzer) and inorganic carbon (measured by coulometry):  

$$
\mathrm{TOC}=\mathrm{TC}-\mathrm{inorganic\;carbon}.
$$  

# Source rock analyses  

Source rock analyses were conducted to identify the type an d stage of maturation of organic matter, estimate TOC, and detect petroleum potential in sediments. Using source rock pyrolysis, fre e and adsorbed hydrocarbons released during programmed heatin g of a sample are recorded as the first peak in a pyrogram (S1) at lo w temperature. The second peak (S2) in the pyrogram represents hydrocarbons released by kerogen cracking. The temperature at th e maximum of the S2 peak is defined as $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ and is an indicator o f rock maturity. $C O_{2},$ shown as the third peak (S3) in the program, i s also generated by kerogen degradation. When these component s are normalized to the TOC content, the S2 peak becomes the hydrogen index $\mathrm{(HI\,=\,S2\,\times\,100/TOC)}$ and the S3 peak becomes th e oxygen index $(\mathrm{OI}=\mathrm{S3}\times100/\mathrm{TOC})$ (Tissot and Welte, 1984).  

Source rock pyrolysis and TOC were determined using a Weatheford source rock analyzer. A crucible sample containing no material was included as a calibration blank and was run as the firs t measurement in each sequence. After this calibration blank, 90–10 0 mg of standard material was used to calibrate the instrument signal s and allowed us to monitor instrument accuracy and precision. A pyrolysis program starting at $300^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with a heating rate of $25^{\circ}C/\mathrm{min}$ was used as a standard mode for the analysis of sediment with lo w maturity.  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements provide constraints on  a range of sediment and rock physical characteristics to facilitat e lithostratigraphic unit characterization and correlation of LWD, wireline logging, and seismic reflection data with core measurements and descriptions. After core recovery, whole-round core sections were thermally equilibrated to ambient room temperatur e $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ over a period of ${\sim}4~\mathrm{h}$ . Whole-round cores were then ru n through the WRMSL for GRA bulk density measurement, magneti c susceptibility measurement using a pass-through loop syste m (MSL), and $P$ -wave velocity measurement using a $P$ -wave logge r (PWL). Following the WRMSL track, whole-round cores were analyzed with the NGRL) when the length of an individual section wa s $>\!50\;\mathrm{cm}$ . Thermal conductivity (TCON) was measured on soft sediments before splitting using needle probes and on lithified sediments and rocks after splitting using a half-space probe. After th e cores were split, the archive half was passed through the SHIL an d then the SHMSL for RSC and MSP. Strength measurements (onl y for soft sediments) were made on the working half using the automated vane shear (AVS) and a pocket penetrometer. Discrete $P_{-}$ - wave velocity measurements were made on either working halve s for soft sediments or discrete cube samples for lithified material s using the $P$ -wave velocity gantry. MAD measurements were conducted on discrete samples (generally two per section and adjacen t to all WR samples). MAD discrete samples were taken from representative lithologies by using a syringe for soft sediments or by preparing oriented, discrete cube samples $\mathrm{1\;cm}\times\mathrm{1\;cm}\times\mathrm{2\;cm}$ and  2 $\mathrm{cm}\times2\:\mathrm{cm}\times2\:\mathrm{cm})$ for lithified sediments and rocks. The oriente d MAD cube samples and paleomagnetism (PMAG) cube samples ( 2 $\mathrm{cm}\times2\ \mathrm{cm}\times2\ \mathrm{cm})$ were used for $P$ -wave velocity measurement s when possible.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

The WRMSL was used to measure GRA density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity nondestructively. The sampling interval for WRMSL measurements was set at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ .  

# GRA bulk density  

GRA density is an estimate of bulk density based on the attenuation of a gamma ray beam. The beam is produced by a $^{137}\!\mathsf{C s}$ gamm a ray source at a radiation level of $370\;\mathrm{MBq}$ in a lead shield with a  5 mm collimator, which is directed through the whole-round core. The gamma ray detector on the opposite side of the core from th e source includes a scintillation detector and an integral photomultiplier tube to record the gamma radiation that passes through th e core. The attenuation of gamma rays occurs primarily by Compto n scattering, in which gamma rays are scattered by electrons in th e formation; the degree of scattering is related to the material bul k density. Bulk density (ρ) determined with this method can be expressed as  

$$
\rho=1/(\upmu d)\times\ln(I_{0}/I),
$$  

where  

$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient,   
$d=$ sample diameter,   
$I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity, and   
$I=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample.  

The attenuation coefficient and gamma ray source intensity ar e treated as constants such that $\uprho$ can be calculated from $I.$ Th e gamma ray detector was calibrated with a set of aluminum cylinder s of various diameters surrounded by distilled water in a sealed cor e liner that is the same as that used during coring operations. The relationship between $I$ and the product of $\upmu$ and $^d$ can be expressed as  

$$
\ln I=B(\upmu d)+C,
$$  

where $B$ and $C$ are coefficients determined during calibration. Gamma ray counts through each cylinder were determined for a period of $_{60\ s}$ , and the natural log of resulting intensity values wa s plotted as a function of $\upmu d$ . Here, the density of each aluminum cylinder is $2.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $^d$ is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or $6\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The WRMSL provided the values of $I$ and $\upmu,$ and $\uprho$ was calculated by the equatio n above. Recalibration was performed as needed if the deionized water standard run after every core deviated significantly (more than  a few percent) from $1.0~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The spatial resolution of the GR A densiometer is $<\!1\;\mathrm{cm}$ .  

GRA bulk density measured on WRMSL is dependent on cor e diameter. For some lithified RCB cores that do not completely fill the liner, corrections for core diameter are required to obtain meaningful bulk density values because GRA bulk density is calculate d based on the assumption that core diameter is $66\,\mathrm{mm}$ (i.e., the inne r diameter of the liner). We estimated the true core diameter fro m image analysis of photographs taken on archive halves. In the imag e analysis, the color image of core sections is first converted into  a three-tone image so that any pixel on the image is either black (0), transitional (1), or white (2). An algorithm is then prepared to detect the edges of the core and calculate the core diameter by pixel size. Using the actual core diameter values, the GRA bulk densit y values were corrected by multiplying by a ratio of the liner diamete r to the actual core diameter.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility $(K)$ is a dimensionless measure of th e degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic field:  

$$
K=M/H,
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material and $H$ is th e strength of an external field. Magnetic susceptibility varies in response to the type and concentration of magnetic grains and responds to variations in the magnetic composition of the sediment, which are both commonly related to variations in mineralogical composition (e.g., terrigenous versus biogenic materials) and diagenetic overprinting. Materials such as clay generally have a magnetic  susceptibility  several  orders  of  magnitude  lower  tha n magnetite and some other iron oxides that are common constituents of igneous and volcanogenic material. Water and plastics (suc h as the core liner) have a slightly negative magnetic susceptibility.  

The WRMSL measures volume magnetic susceptibility using  a Bartington  Instruments  MS2  meter  (Bartington  Instruments, 2011), coupled to an MS2C sensor coil $88\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter) and operates at an AF of $250\;\upmu\mathrm{T}$ and a frequency of $565\;\mathrm{Hz}$ . During Expedition 375, the instrument was set to record an average of  3 measurements over a 1 s period. No correction was applied for volume effects caused by differing APC, XCB, and RCB core diameters. The spatial resolution of the MS2C sensor is $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ (Bartington Instruments, 2011), and tests using synthetic cores suggested a ful l width at half maximum response of $4.0{-}4.4~\mathrm{cm}$ (Blum, 1997).  

# P-wave velocity  

For soft sediments, the $P$ -wave velocity sensor measures the ultrasonic $P$ -wave velocity of the WR sample residing in the core liner. The PWL transmits a $500\;\mathrm{kHz}\;P\cdot$ -wave pulse across the core sectio n at a repetition rate of $200\,\mathrm{Hz}$ . This signal is coupled to the sample b y the plastic contacts of the ultrasonic transducers clamped to th e sides of the core by a linear actuator. A small amount of water is applied to the contacts for each measurement to improve coupling between the transducers and the liner. The transmitting and receivin g ultrasonic transducers are aligned so that wave propagation is perpendicular to the long axis of the core section.  

Sonic velocity $(V)$ is defined as  

$$
V=d/t,
$$  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave through the core and $t$ is th e traveltime. In addition to the traveltime through the sample, the total traveltime between the transducers includes three additiona l components:  

• $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry, • $t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure, and • $t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner.  

For routine measurement on whole-round cores inside core liners, the corrected core velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{core}}\right)$ can be expressed by  

$$
V_{\mathrm{core}}=(d_{\mathrm{core}}^{\prime}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{0}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{core}}^{\prime}=$ measured diameter of core and liner, $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness, and $t_{0}=$ measured total traveltime.  

The system was calibrated using an aluminum block of know n $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity $(6295\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ and length $(76.2\,\mathrm{mm})$ , and measuremen t of water was used to verify the calibration and data quality durin g each section run.  

Traveltime was determined by a signal processing software tha t automatically detects the first arrival of the $P$ -wave signal. Becaus e high background noise makes it challenging for an automated routine to pick the first arrival of a potentially low amplitude signal, th e search method skips the first positive amplitude peak and detects  a second positive amplitude using a detection threshold limit typically set to $30\%$ of the maximum amplitude of the signal. The program then finds the preceding zero crossing and subtracts one wav e period to define the first arrival. To avoid false detection of arrival s in the case of extremely weak signals, a minimum signal strengt h (typically $0.02\mathrm{~V~}$ ) can be set and weaker signals are ignored. T o avoid signal interference at the beginning of the record from the receiver, a delay (typically $0.01~\mathrm{ms}$ ) can be set to force the amplitud e search to begin in the quiet interval preceding the first arrival. I n addition, a trigger (typically $4\mathrm{~V~}_{.}$ ) is selected to initiate the arriva l search process, and the number of waveforms to be stacked (typically 50–100) can also be set. A laser measures the separation of th e transducers to derive a signal path length (i.e., $d_{\mathrm{{core}}}^{\prime})$ . After corrections for system propagation delay, liner thickness, and liner material velocity, the ultrasonic $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity is calculated. Th e software removes any extremely unrealistic velocity values $(<\!900$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ or ${>}6000\,\mathrm{m/s})$ ).  

# Natural Gamma Radiation Logger  

The NGRL measures gamma radiation emitted from wholeround core sections arising primarily from the radioactive decay o f 238U, $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ isotopes. The main NGRL detector unit consist s of 8 sodium iodide (NaI) scintillator detectors that are covered by  8 cm of lead shielding. In addition, lead separators $\cdot^{\sim}\,\mathrm{cm}$ of lowbackground lead) are positioned between the NaI detectors. Half o f the lead shielding closest to the NaI detectors is composed of lowbackground lead, and the outer half is composed of regular (virgin ) lead. In addition to passive lead shielding, the NGRL employs plastic scintillators to suppress the high-energy gamma and muon components of cosmic radiation by producing a canceling signal whe n these charged particles pass through the plastic scintillators. Th e NGRL was calibrated using a source consisting of $^{137}\!C s$ and $^{60}{\bf C}_{0}$ an d identifying the peaks at 662 $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ and $1330\;\mathrm{keV}\;(^{60}\mathrm{Co})$ . The NGR L installed on the JOIDES Resolution was designed and built by th e Integrated Ocean Drilling Program-US Implementing Organizatio n at Texas A&M University (Vasiliev et al., 2011). Calibration materials are provided by Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products, Valencia, California (USA). Background measurements of an empty core line r counted for 40,000 s $(\sim\!10\mathrm{~h)}$ at each measurement position wer e made when we arrived at the first site (U1518). Over the 100–300 0 $\mathrm{keV}$ integration range, background levels averaged 4–5 counts/s.  

A measurement run consisted of 8 measurements made simultaneously at $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals for a normal $\langle150\;\mathrm{cm})$ section of cor e repeated with an offset of $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ to give a total of 16 measurement s at $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals for the section. Core liners were wiped dry prio r to natural gamma radiation (NGR) measurement. The count time i n each position was $5\;\mathrm{min}$ . For presentation purposes, the counts ar e summed over a range from 100 to $3000\ \mathrm{keV}.$ The quality of the energy spectrum measured in a core depends on the concentration o f radionuclides in the sample but also on the counting time, wit h higher times yielding better spectra. Total NGRL counts are converted to potassium (K), thorium (Th), and uranium (U) content s from the characteristic gamma ray energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series using the procedure given b y De Vleeschouwer et al. (2017).  

# Section Half Image Logger measurements  

The SHIL scans the surface of archive halves and creates a digital image. The linescan camera contains three charge-coupled devices (CCDs); each CCD has 1024 arrays. Light reflection from th e sample surface passes through the lens and is split into three path s (red, green, and blue) by a beam splitter inside the linescan camera. Each reflection was then detected by the corresponding CCD. Finally, the signals are combined and a digital image is produced. Optical distortion is avoided by precise movement of the camera. Spatial resolution is 100 pixels/cm.  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

The SHMSL measures magnetic susceptibility and spectral reflectance on archive halves. The archive half is placed on the system’s core track. An electronic platform moves along a track abov e the core section, recording the sample height with a laser sensor. The laser establishes the position of the cut face of the section, an d the platform reverses the direction of movement, moving from bottom to top and taking MSP and spectral reflectance measurement s at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals.  

# Reflectance spectrophotometry and colorimetry  

Reflectance of visible light from the archive halves of sedimen t cores was measured using an Ocean Optics spectrophotomete r mounted on the SHMSL. For sediment and sedimentary rock, freshly split cores were covered with clear plastic wrap. Spectra l data were reduced to the $\mathrm{L^{*}}\mathbf{a}^{*}\mathbf{b}^{*}$ color space for output and presentation. $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ is lightness, ranging between 0 (black) and 100 (white); $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ is the red–green value, ranging between $^{-60}$ (green) and 60 (red); and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ is the yellow–blue value, ranging between $^{-60}$ (blue) and 6 0 (yellow). The color reflectance spectrophotometer calibrates on tw o spectra, pure white (reference) and pure black (dark). Measurements were recorded every $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ in wide spectral bands from 380 t o $900\;\mathrm{nm}$ in $2\;\mathrm{nm}$ steps. Each measurement took ${\sim}5\;s$ .  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

MSP was measured on the SHMSL using a Bartington MS2 K point sensor (high-resolution surface-scanning sensor) operating a t an AF of $250\;\upmu\mathrm{T}$ and a frequency of $930\,\mathrm{Hz}$ , similar to the MSL Bartington sensor on the WRMSL. The sensor takes and averages thre e measurements at $_{1\,s}$ intervals to an accuracy of $5\%$ . Measurement s were made on archive halves covered with clear plastic wrap.  

# Discrete $P$ -wave velocity measurements  

Discrete $P$ -wave velocity measurements were obtained on softsediment cores at a typical frequency of one per section where conditions allowed using the $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity gantry. The frequency o f the transducers is $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ . Measurements along the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis (Figur e F23) were acquired with a caliper-type contact probe with on e transducer contact on the face of the working half and the othe r contact against the core liner. For the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis measurements, the distance between the transducers was measured by laser, and velocit y values were corrected for traveltime through the single liner thickness. Deionized water was applied to the sample and transduce r surfaces to improve contact with the transducers. Measurement s along the $y.$ - and $z$ -axes were acquired using two pairs of bayone t probes inserted perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the working half, respectively.  

For lithified and semilithified cores, the caliper-type contac t probe was used to measure $P$ -wave velocity on discrete MAD cub e samples $(1\,\mathrm{cm}\times1\,\mathrm{cm}\times2\,\mathrm{cm}$ or $2\;\mathrm{cm}\times2\;\mathrm{cm}\times2\;\mathrm{cm})$ and selecte d PMAG cube samples $(2\ \mathrm{cm}\times\ 2\ \mathrm{cm}\times\ 2\ \mathrm{cm})$ ) at a typical samplin g frequency of 1–2 per core. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity was measured across al l three axes of the oriented cubes $(x-,\;y-$ , and $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -directions; Figur e F23). Horizontal anisotropy $(\upalpha_{\mathrm{{I}}})$ and vertical anisotropy $(\upalpha_{\mathrm{T}})$ of $P$ - wave velocity were calculated for $2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2\,\mathrm{cm}$ cubic sample s as  

$$
\upalpha_{\mathrm{I}}=2[(V_{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{X}}}-V_{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{Y}}})/(V_{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{X}}}+V_{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{Y}}})],\,\mathrm{a}
$$  

$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{T}}=2[(V_{\mathrm{px}}+V_{\mathrm{py}})/2-V_{\mathrm{pz}}]/[(V_{\mathrm{px}}+V_{\mathrm{py}})/2+V_{\mathrm{pz}}],
$$  

where $V_{\mathrm{p_{x}}},\,V_{\mathrm{p_{y}}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{p_{z}}}$ are the $P$ -wave velocity in the $x_{\mathrm{~}},\,y_{\mathrm{~-~}}$ , and $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ - directions, respectively.  

The signal received through the sample is recorded by the computer connected to the system, and the first arrival is chosen wit h autopicking software, as described in $\pmb{P}$ -wave velocity above. In addition to the autopicked arrival, we manually picked the first arriva l during the measurement or from the waveform data after the measurement. The caliper-type contact probe was calibrated each da y with an aluminum block of known $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity. Deionized wate r was used to calibrate the bayonet probes.  

# Moisture and density measurements  

MAD measurements on discrete samples provide several basi c physical properties that can be used to characterize lithostratigraphic units and correlate cored material with logging data. Th e commonly used MAD properties are moisture content, bulk density, porosity, and void ratio. These properties are calculated base d on the measured wet mass, dry mass, and dry volume of samples. A s with most other expeditions, we used Method C of Blum (1997), described below.  

# Sampling procedure  

Two samples were taken from each working half adjacent t o each WR sample. The samples were collected using a plastic cylinder syringe $(5{-}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ in soft sediments, and for indurated sediments, cubes $\left(1\,{\mathrm{cm}}\times1\,{\mathrm{cm}}\times2\,{\mathrm{cl}}\right)$ m or $2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2\,\mathrm{cm})$ were cu t from the working halves with a saw. Each sample was placed in  a labeled glass vial of known mass and volume (measured prior to th e expedition). No vial was used for lithified cubes at Site U1526. Th e mass and volume of the samples were obtained by subtracting th e vial mass and volume from the total mass and volume, respectively.  

# Measurement of wet and dry mass  

The wet sample mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ was measured using a Mettler-Toledo XS204 electric dual-balance system designed to compensat e for ship heave. Both balances were initially “tared” or set to zero. The sample vial was then placed on the first (measuring) balance, and a reference with a mass within ${\sim}1\mathrm{~g~}$ of the sample vial wa s placed on the second (reference) balance. Once the mass was measured, the wet samples were dried in a convection oven for ${>}24\,\mathrm{h}$ a t $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The dry samples were then placed in a desiccator for a t least $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ for the samples to equilibrate to room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ before the dry mass and volume were measured. The dry mas s $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ was determined using the same process as for the wet mas s measurement.  

# Measurement of volume  

The volume of the room-temperature dry samples was measured with a Micromeritics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacemen t pycnometer, an IODP custom-built system composed of six cell units, electronics, and control programs. The six cells are mounte d in a chassis to protect the electronics and help provide temperatur e stability. The system measures dry sample volume using pressurize d He-filled chambers with a precision of $0.04\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . For each measurement run, five of the six cells contained a sample and one cell contained stainless steel calibration spheres (3 and $7~\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ ) with a total volume of $\sim\!10\,\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . Calibration spheres were cycled through the si x cells sequentially with each progressive run to identify any systematic error and/or instrument drift. If the volumes of the calibratio n spheres deviated by ${>}\pm1\%$ of their known volume, then the relevan t pycnometer cell was recalibrated. After we identified some uncertainty in dry volume measurements in certain cells for measurements on samples from Site U1518, we changed the method slightl y for other sites; all cells were calibrated at least once every $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . Fo r each measurement run, four of the six cells contained a sample an d two cells contained stainless steel calibration spheres. If the volumes of the calibration spheres deviated by more than $\pm0.5\%$ , the n the pycnometer cell was recalibrated. For Site U1518 MAD data, w e corrected the dry volume based on postmeasurement recalibratio n using standard spheres and calculated the associated MAD value s (see Physical properties in the Site U1518 chapter [Saffer et al., 2019]).  

# Calculation of index properties  

Saturated marine sediments are composed of fluid (water plu s dissolved salt) and solid grains. From the direct measurements o f $M_{\mathrm{wet}},M_{\mathrm{dry}},$ and dry volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ assuming known values for salinit y and water density, we can obtain the mass and volume of each component: pore water mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ , pore fluid mass $(M_{\mathrm{f}})$ , salt mas s $(M_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{s}})$ , pore water volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ , pore fluid volume $(V_{\mathrm{f}})$ , salt volume $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , and volume of solids excluding salt $\left(V_{s}\right)$ :  

$$
M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}
$$  

$$
M_{\mathrm{f}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}/(1-{\mathsf{s}}),
$$  

$$
M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{f}}-M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}\times{\mathsf{s}}/(1-{\mathsf{s}}),
$$  

$$
M_{s}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{f}}=M_{\mathrm{dry}}-M_{\mathrm{salt}}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{water}},
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{f}}=M_{\mathrm{f}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{f}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}/[(1-\mathbf{s})\times\uprho_{\mathrm{f}}],
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{s}}=V_{\mathrm{dry}}-\,V_{\mathrm{salt}}=V_{\mathrm{dry}}-M_{\mathrm{water}}\times\mathrm{s}/[(1-\mathrm{s})\times\mathrm{\mathrm{\rho}_{\mathrm{salt}}}],
$$  

where  

$\boldsymbol{M}_{\mathrm{wet}}=$ total mass of the wet sample, $M_{\mathrm{dry}}=$ mass of the dried sample, $\scriptstyle\mathbf{s}\;=$ salinity (0.035), $\uprho_{\mathrm{f}}=$ density of pore fluid $(1.024\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ), $\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}}=$ density of salt $(2.220\,\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ , and $\uprho_{\mathrm{water}}=$ density of water $(1.0\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ .  

Bulk density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ is calculated as  

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{b}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/(V_{\mathrm{dry}}+V_{\mathrm{f}}-V_{\mathrm{salt}}),
$$  

and grain density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{g}})$ is calculated as  

$$
\uprho_{\mathrm{g}}=M_{\mathrm{s}}/V_{\mathrm{s}}=M_{\mathrm{s}}/(V_{\mathrm{dry}}-V_{\mathrm{salt}}),
$$  

where $V_{\mathrm{wet}}$ is the bulk volume of the wet sample determined fro m the pycnometer measurements of dry volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)$ and the calculated volume of the pore fluid $\left(V_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ and salt $\mathrm{(}V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ . Porosity $(\Phi)$ an d void ratio $(e)$ are calculated as  

$$
\Phi=V_{\mathrm{f}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
e=V_{\mathrm{f}}/V_{\mathrm{s}}.
$$  

# Undrained shear strength  

The undrained shear strength of soft sediments was determine d using a Giesa AVS system. The unconfined compressive strength o f the sediments was determined using an ELE Soiltest CL-700 A pocket  penetrometer.  These  values  were  then  converted  t o undrained shear strength values using empirical relations. The measurements were made as close as possible to MAD samples and i n minimally disturbed and homogeneous sediments. All measurements were taken on working halves. Vane rotation axis and penetrometer axis were oriented in the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction (Figure F23).  

# Shear strength with AVS  

Vane shear strength was determined for soft sediments using  a Giesa AVS, which includes a four-bladed vane and the Giesa proprietary software GeoLAB. The vane has a blade height of $12.7\ \mathrm{mm}$ and blade width of $6.35\ \mathrm{mm}$ (Vane A) and was manually inserte d into the section half using a hand crank until the top of the vane wa s flush with the top of the section half. The vane was subsequentl y rotated at an angular velocity of $1.5^{\circ}/\mathbf{s}$ until a maximum torque wa s observed. This torque at failure ( $T;$ newton meters) and a vane constant $\mathrm{[K_{v};}$ cubic meters) can be used to estimate the vane shea r strength of the sediment $S;$ newtons per square meter) as  

$$
S=T\times\operatorname{K}_{\mathrm{v}}.
$$  

The vane constant corresponding to Vane A is $233.09\,\mathrm{~m^{-3}}$ . Torque was measured every $5^{\circ}$ via two spring-loaded analog sensor s using the rotation angle of the torsional springs. Vane shea r strength readings were most reliable only when the undrained shea r strength of the sample was $_{<150\;\mathrm{kPa}}$ . Above this value, the sampl e experienced excessive cracking and separation. Hence, in case s where the strength exceeds this value, the AVS data were discarded. Additionally, if the sediment was too hard for the AVS to penetrate, a brass bushing at the top of the crank popped out, and no AV S measurement was taken.  

# Compressive strength with pocket penetrometer  

The pocket penetrometer (model ELE Soiltest CL-700A) is  a spring-loaded device used to measure the unconfined compressiv e strength of sediments. The device consists of a $6.4~\mathrm{mm}$ diamete r probe and is pushed $6.4~\mathrm{mm}$ into a working half in the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction. The amount of deformation experienced by the spring in the penetrometer provides a direct measure of the compressive strength o f the sediments. The unconfined compressive strength (σ) is calculated by multiplying the reading value on the penetrometer by gravitational acceleration $(9.81\,\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2})$ . This value is then converted t o undrained shear strength (τ) by  

$$
\tau=\sigma/2.
$$  

The device with a standard foot ( $.6.4\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter) can measur e compressive strengths as high as ${\sim}440\ \mathrm{kPa}$ (or shear strengths a s high as ${\sim}220\ \mathrm{kPa})$ ). To obtain accurate measurements in very sof t sediments, a larger adaptor foot (25.4 or $12.7\;\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{}$ ) was attached t o the penetrometer base; likewise, for stiff sediments with a compressive strength greater than ${\sim}440\ \mathrm{kPa}$ , a smaller $\left(2.86\mathrm{~mm}\right)$ foot wa s used. In these cases, the measured values were then divided by are a ratios of 16, 4, or 0.2, respectively, before converting to unconfine d compressive strength or undrained shear strength.  

# Thermal conductivity  

At steady state, thermal conductivity $^{k;}$ watts per meter Kelvin ) is the coefficient of heat transfer that relates heat flow $(q)$ and thermal gradient $(\mathrm{d}T/\mathrm{d}z)$ by  

$$
q=-k(\mathrm{d}T/\mathrm{d}z).

Thermal conductivity is a material property that depends o n type of saturating fluid, composition, porosity, and structure, distribution, and alignment of mineral phases, as well as (to a lesser extent) temperature and pressure.  

The TK04 system measures thermal conductivity by transien t heating of the sample with a needle of known heating power an d geometry. The temperature of the superconductive needle prob e has a quasilinear relationship with the natural logarithm of the tim e after the initiation of heating (Blum, 1997). Changes in temperatur e with time during heating are recorded and used to calculate therma l conductivity. Variable heating power is used for soft and lithifie d sediments. The measurement time depends on the dimensions o f the probe (the larger the probe, the longer the required measurin g time). The default measuring time for standard laboratory probes i s $^{80\,\mathrm{s}}$ . The software controlling the TK04 device uses an approximation method to calculate thermal conductivity and assess the fit o f the heating curve. This method (Blum, 1997) fits discrete window s of the heating curve to a theoretical temperature (T) with time $\mathit{\Omega}(t)$ function for a constantly heated line source:  

$$
T(t)=A_{1}+A_{2}\ln(t)+A_{3}[\ln(t)/t]+(A_{4}/t),
$$  

where $A_{1}{-}A_{4}$ are constants calculated by linear regression over a series of different time windows. $A_{1}$ is the initial temperature. $A_{2},A_{3},$ and $A_{4}$ are related to the geometry of the probe and material properties surrounding the probe. These constants define a time-dependent apparent thermal conductivity $(k_{\mathrm{a}})$ given by  

$$
k_{\mathrm{a}}(t)=Q/4\uppi\{A_{2}+A_{3}[1-\ln(t)/t]-[A_{4}/t]\},
$$  

where $Q$ is the input heat flux. Each fit to the data provides a possible value of the true thermal conductivity $(k)$ given by a local maximum in the function $k_{\mathrm{a}}$ . The quality of each measurement i s evaluated using the standard deviation of each least-squares fit, th e number of valid solutions for $k,$ and the time at which the maximu m in $k_{\mathrm{a}}$ occurs $\left(t_{\mathrm{max}}\right)$ in each case. The value of $k$ output is that fo r which $t_{\mathrm{max}}$ is highest. The software also assesses contact resistanc e between the probe and the sample to ensure good thermal exchange.  

All measurements were made after cores equilibrated to ambient laboratory temperature. The instrument measures temperatur e drift in the sample and does not begin a heating run until sufficien t thermal stability is attained. The probe was checked every other da y using the MACOR ceramic standard with a reported thermal conductivity of 1.626 W/(m·K).  

For soft sediments, a full-space single-needle probe TeKa TK0 4 unit (Blum, 1997) is utilized to measure thermal conductivity o f whole cores. To insert this probe, a hole was made in the core line r at a position based on visual inspection of the core that avoided disturbed regions. In most cases, three repeat measurements wer e made at the same location; typically the sample was left to equilibrate for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ between measurements. However, to facilitate cor e flow, sometimes less than three measurements were made. Initially, the heating power $\mathbf{\rho}(\mathbf{W}/\mathbf{m})$ was set in a range recommended for sof t sediments, typically $3\;\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}$ .  

Thermal conductivity on samples too lithified for insertion o f the probe was measured on the working half with the thermal conductivity meter in half-space mode using a needle probe embedde d in the bottom of a Plexiglass block (Vacquier, 1985). Smooth and fla t samples were coated with joint compound for adequate contac t with the heating needle to ensure good heat transfer. The heatin g power was typically set to $1~\mathrm{W/m}$ . The TK04 documentation indicates that heat flow through the Plexiglass block itself is only significant for samples with thermal conductivity values ${<}1\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ .  

For lithified rock, core pieces from the working half were measured at irregular intervals depending on the availability of homogeneous and relatively crack-free pieces long enough to be measure d without edge effects (pieces ${>}7~\mathrm{cm}$ long; i.e., longer than the instrument needle). These pieces were first saturated in seawater under  a vacuum for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ prior to measurement. At least three measurement s were performed on each sample to verify the consistency of the results and define an average value.  

In addition to the TK04, thermal conductivity measurement s were also made in soft sediments in Hole U1518E using a thirdparty TPSYS02 system manufactured by Huskeflux Thermal Sensors and owned by Oregon State University (USA). The theory fo r this measurement is the same as for the TeKa system describe d above. Three repeat measurements were made at the same location; typically the sample was left to equilibrate for $10\;\mathrm{{min}}$ between measurements. Initially, the heating power was set in a range recommended for soft sediments, typically $3~\mathrm{W/m}$ . An advantage of thi s system is that the full time series of temperatures during the drif t and heating cycles are used to analyze the data. Each measuremen t was visually inspected, and thermal conductivity was estimated b y computing a linear fit to the natural log of time during the heatin g phase of the measurement.  

# Downhole measurements  

# Formation temperature measurements  

Downhole in situ temperature measurements were made usin g the APCT-3. The APCT-3 consists of three components: electronics, coring hardware, and computer software (Figure F27). Durin g Expedition 375, downhole temperature measurements were mad e approximately every second or third core during APC coring whe n time and operational constraints allowed. The temperature sensor s were calibrated for a working range of $0^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Prior to entering th e hole for each deployment, the tool was held at the mudline for ${\sim}5$ min to equilibrate with bottom water temperature. After botto m water temperature equilibration, the tool was lowered in the hole t o penetrate the formation.  

The penetration of each tool into the formation generates a ris e in temperature caused by frictional heating. Following the initial temperature rise, the temperature decreases along a decay curve t o near equilibrium. During this decay phase, it is important that th e temperature tool is not disturbed. A second rise in temperatur e marks the end of the measurement and is due to frictional heatin g as the tool is pulled out of the formation. Temperature data are sampled at $1\:\mathrm{Hz}$ and logged on a microprocessor in the APCT-3 corin g shoe. Data are retrieved when the tool is recovered. The formatio n temperature is estimated from the recorded data by fitting model curves that are specific to the sensor and the tool geometry (Heesemann et al., 2006). Formation temperatures are used to estimate th e geothermal gradient, which is combined with thermal conductivit y measurements made on core samples (see Physical properties) t o provide an estimate of the local vertical conductive heat flow.  

# Wireline logging  

Wireline logs are measurements of physical, chemical, an d structural properties of the formation around a borehole, made b y lowering sondes with an electrical wireline into the hole after completion of drilling. The data are acquired continuously with dept h (at vertical sampling intervals ranging from $2.5~\mathrm{mm}$ to $15~\mathrm{cm}$ ) an d are measured in situ.  

Logs can be interpreted in terms of stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, physical properties, and geochemical composition. The y also provide information on the status and size of the borehole an d on possible deformation induced by drilling or formation stresses. In intervals where core recovery is incomplete, logging provides th e continuous data needed to characterize the formation and can b e used to determine the actual thickness of individual units or lithologies when contacts are not recovered, to pinpoint the depth of features  in  cores  with  incomplete  recovery,  or  to  identify  an d characterize intervals that were not recovered. Where core recover y is good, log and core data complement one another and may be interpreted jointly.  

# Logging operations  

Logs are recorded with a variety of tools combined into strings. The measurements planned for Expedition 375 included gamm a ray, resistivity, and sonic velocity. Because of concerns with borehole stability and time constraints, only a limited set of data was recorded at Site U1520 (Figure F28; Tables T9, T10).  

Figure F27. APCT-3 deployment during APC operations, Expedition 375.  

![](images/1c2fcd2c6a62402f0e2192bb4cb8bd8ac0806530ccfdee8806451e56fa99ac84.jpg)  

After completion of coring at Site U1520, the bottom of the dril l string was set high enough above the bottom of the casing for th e longest tool string to fit inside the casing before entering the ope n hole. The main data were recorded in the open hole section. Th e gamma ray tool (see below) is the only tool that provides meaningful (mostly qualitative) data inside the drill pipe or casing. Such dat a are used primarily to identify the seafloor and casing shoe depth bu t can also be used for stratigraphic characterization. Each deployment of a tool string is a logging run, starting with the assembly o f the tools and the necessary calibrations. The tool string is then lowered to the bottom of the hole while recording a partial set of dat a and pulled back uphole at a constant speed, typically $250{-}500\;\mathrm{m/h},$ to record the primary data set used for interpretation and core-logseismic integration (CLSI). During the Site U1520 deployment, th e tool strings were lowered and pulled up three times to assess repeatability and improve the quality or coverage of the data. Each lowering or raising of the tool string while collecting data constitutes  a pass. During each pass, the data are monitored in real time and recorded on the surface.  

# Logged properties and tool measurement principles  

The main logs recorded during Expedition 375 are listed i n Table T9. More detailed information on individual tools an d their geological applications may be found in Ellis and Singe r (2007), Goldberg (1997), Rider (1996), Schlumberger (1989), and Serra (1984, 1986). A complete list of acronyms for th e Schlumberger tools and measurement curves is available at http://www.apps.slb.com/cmd/index.aspx.  

# Natural radioactivity  

The Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC; see Telemetry cartridges), which is used primarily to transmit data to the surface, includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector to measure th e total natural gamma ray emission. It is not a spectral tool but it provides high-resolution total gamma ray measurements for each pass.  

# Caliper  

The Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS) normally uses a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source to measure the formation density. Because of concerns about hole stability, the HLDS was run without the source in Hole U1520C, using its extended arm to provide a caliper log of the borehole size that can b e used to assess data quality and the reliability of measurements tha t could be affected by an enlarged or irregular borehole.  

# Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) provides six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation (including the borehole fluid or mud resistivity and five measurement s of formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation). The sonde sends a focused current beam into the formatio n and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constant drop i n voltage across a fixed interval, providing a direct resistivity measurement. The array has one central source electrode and six electrodes above and below it, which serve alternately as focusing an d returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role of thes e electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement is achieved a t six penetration depths (see Table T9).  

Typically, minerals found in sedimentary and crustal rocks ar e electrical insulators, whereas ionic solutions like pore water ar e conductors. In most rocks, electrical conduction occurs primaril y by ion transport through pore fluids and is strongly dependent o n the porosity, the type of pores and connectivity, the permeability, and the pore fluid composition.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The Dipole Shear Sonic Imager (DSI) generates acoustic pulse s from various sonic transmitters and records the waveforms with a n array of eight receivers. The waveforms are then used to calculat e sonic velocity in the formation. The omnidirectional monopol e transmitter emits high-frequency $(5{-}15\,\mathrm{kHz})$ pulses to measure th e compressional velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ of the formation, as well as the shear velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{{S}}}\right)$ when it is faster than the sound velocity in the borehol e fluid. The same transmitter can be fired in sequence at a lower frequency $(0.5{-}1\,\mathrm{kHz})$ to generate Stoneley waves that are sensitive t o fractures and variations in permeability. The DSI also has two dipole transmitters generating flexural waves along the borehole tha t allow the measurement of shear wave velocity in formations fo r which $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ is slower than the velocity in the borehole fluid.

The Schlumberger logging equipment head (or cablehead) measures tension at the top of the wireline tool string to diagnose difficulties in running the tool string up or down the borehole or whe n exiting or entering the drill string or casing.  

# Telemetry cartridges  

Telemetry cartridges are used in each tool string to transmit th e data in real time from the tools to the surface. The EDTC also includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector to measure the tota l natural gamma ray emission of the formation, which can be used t o help match depths between the different passes and runs.

# Joints and adapters  

Because the tool strings combine tools of different generation s and with various designs, they include several adapters and joints t o allow communication, provide isolation, avoid interferences (mechanical and acoustic), terminate wirings, or position the tool properly in the borehole. Centralized knuckle joints were used to allo w some of the tools, such as the HRLA, to remain centralized in th e borehole while the HLDS was pressed against the borehole wall.  

All of these components contribute to the total length an d weight of the tool strings in Figure F28.  

# Log data quality  

The principal factor in the quality of log data is the condition o f the borehole. If the borehole diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts or ledges, the logs from tools that require goo d contact with the borehole wall may be degraded. Deep investigatio n measurements such as gamma ray, resistivity, and sonic velocity, which do not require contact with the borehole wall, are generall y less sensitive to borehole conditions. Very narrow (“bridged”) sections will also cause irregular log results.  

The accuracy of the logging depth depends on several factors . The depth of the logging measurements is determined from th e length of the cable spooled out from the winch on the ship. Uncertainties in logging depth occur because of ship heave, cable stretch, cable slip, or even tidal changes. All of these factors generate som e depth discrepancy between individual logging runs and passes. Th e gamma ray log recorded during each logging pass is used to matc h the logging depths (see below) and provide depth consistency acros s all logging data.  

# Wireline heave compensator  

The wireline heave compensator (WHC) system is designed t o compensate for the vertical motion of the ship and maintain  a steady motion of the logging tools. It uses vertical acceleration measurements made by a motion reference unit located under the ri g floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertical motio n of the ship. It then adjusts the length of the wireline by varying th e distance between two sets of pulleys through which the wirelin e passes.  

# Logging data flow and processing  

Data from each logging run were monitored in real time and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. Shortly afte r logging, the data were transferred to the Lamont-Doherty Eart h Observatory (LDEO) for standardized processing, formatting fo r the online logging database, and archiving. The processed data wer e returned to the ship and made available to the shipboard scientist s within ${\sim}2$ days.  

The processing includes several stages. First, using the gamm a ray logs, a visually interactive program is used to match the depth s of recognizable features across all the passes to a reference curve; typically the gamma ray log of the longest upward pass serves as th e reference. After depth matching, all logging depths are shifted to th e seafloor based on the seafloor identified by a step in the gamma ra y profile. All of the processed data are made available in ASCII an d digital log information standard (DLIS) formats for most logs.  

# Logging while drilling  

LWD well log data were collected at Sites U1518–U1520 as par t of the gas safety monitoring protocol and to (1) facilitate lithologi c interpretation; (2) guide interpretation of faults, fractures, and sediment deformation structures; (3) help constrain elastic moduli fo r integration with seismic data; and (4) provide guidance for observatories installed during Expedition 375 (see Observatory in the Sit e U1518 chapter and Observatory in the Site U1519 chapter [Saffer e t al., 2019; Barnes et al., 2019]).  

LWD tools are instrumented drill collars in the BHA (see Introduction). LWD and MWD tools are attached behind the bit an d measure in situ formation properties. The MWD tool (TeleScope ) provides electrical power and transmits data from other tools up th e borehole. The TeleScope transmits limited LWD data channels, referred to as real-time data, using mud-pulse telemetry during drilling. The complete LWD data set is recorded in each tool an d downloaded from memory after the tool is recovered on the ri g floor, referred to as recorded-mode data. The term “LWD” is ofte n used to refer to both LWD- and MWD-type measurements, tools, and systems, and we use that convention here.  

LWD tools are powered by batteries or by pumping drilling flui d through a turbine. Each LWD tool has a memory chip to store recorded-mode data. The tools take measurements at regular time intervals. Drilling depth is measured using a geolograph, which is  a spooled wire depth encoder attached to the top drive. Followin g drilling and the return of the tools to the drill floor, the recordedmode data are downloaded and the data timestamps are synce d with the geolograph depth file to provide data depths.  

For Sites U1518–U1520, the six Schlumberger LWD tools assembled in order behind the $8\%$ inch drill bit from bottom to to p were the geoVISION (electrical imaging), NeoScope (propagatio n resistivity and neutron porosity), StethoScope (formation pressur e and fluid mobility), TeleScope (MWD), SonicScope (compressional and shear velocity), and proVISION Plus (nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR]) (Figure F29; Table T11). All tools were $6\%$ inch $[{\sim}17$ cm) drill collars in the Schlumberger 675 series.  

# LWD tools  

# geoVISION  

The geoVISION tool is a hybrid resistivity device that collects 1- D laterolog-type resistivity measurements, $360^{\circ}$ azimuthal resistivity images, and natural gamma ray images of the borehole wall. Th e geoVISION tool was placed directly behind the bit (Figure F29) an d is battery operated.  

The resistivity measurements are performed by two transmitte r electrodes that send signals to a series of receiver electrodes, providing three sets of information:  

• Bit resistivity is measured using the lower portion of the geoVISION tool and the drill bit as the measurement electrode. Alternating current flows through the lower transmitter, the collar, and the drill bit and down into the formation before returning to the drill collar. Resistivity is derived from the axial current passing through the formation at a given induced voltage. The vertical resolution of the bit resistivity measurements ranges from ${\sim}30$ to $60\,\mathrm{cm}$ with a depth of investigation of $\mathord{\sim}30$ cm (Table T11).   
• Ring resistivity is measured using the radial flow of current out of the collar. Current is approximately perpendicular to the tool, depending on the homogeneity of the formation. Resistivity is determined by measuring the current flowing out the tool at the $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick integral cylindrical electrode, located $90\,\mathrm{cm}$ from the bottom of the tool. Ring resistivity is a focused lateral resistivity measurement with a vertical resolution of ${\sim}5{-}8\ \mathrm{cm}$ and a depth of investigation of ${\sim}18\;\mathrm{cm}$ (Table T11).   
• Button resistivity is measured by three longitudinally spaced, azimuthally focused, $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick button electrodes stacked in the upper portion of the tool, which provide resistivity data at various depths of investigation. Measurements acquired during tool rotation in the borehole provide data for generating $360^{\circ}$ resistivity images of the borehole wall. The vertical resolution of the button resistivity measurements is ${\sim}5{-}8\ \mathrm{cm},$ , and the depth of investigation is of ${\sim}2.5,{\sim}7.5,$ and ${\sim}13\;\mathrm{cm}$ for shallow, medium, and deep resistivity measurements, respectively (Table T11).  

Gamma ray measurements are obtained with a scintillatio n gamma ray detector that has a vertical resolution of ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{cm}$ and records measurements in American Petroleum Institute gamma radiation units (gAPI; a standard for natural gamma ray measurement s in a borehole) (Table T11). Similar to button resistivity, azimuthal gamma measurements are recorded during tool rotation allowin g generation of a $360^{\circ}$ gamma ray image log.  

All geoVISION data were sampled every $5\ \mathbf{s}_{:}$ , resulting in dat a points every $0.042\mathrm{~m~}$ as long as the ROP remained below $30~\mathrm{m/h}$ (Table T12).  

# NeoScope  

The NeoScope tool (second LWD tool behind the bit) collect s measurements of azimuthal natural gamma ray, a suite of electromagnetic wave propagation resistivity, neutron porosity, neutrongamma bulk density, ultrasonic caliper, annular pressure, and annular temperature (Figure F29). Expedition 372 was the first time th e NeoScope tool was used on the JOIDES Resolution; however, simila r tools (EcoScope, adnVISION, and arcVISION) were used during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 308, 311, 314, 332, 334, 338, and 343 (Expedition 308 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 31 1 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 314 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 33 2 Scientists, 2011; Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012; Strasser et al., 2014; Expedition 343/343T Scientists, 2013).  

Electromagnetic waves are attenuated and phase shifted whe n they propagate through a formation of finite conductivity, and th e degree of attenuation and phase shift depends on the resistivity o f the formation (Bonner et al., 1995). Propagation resistivity measurements on the NeoScope tool include attenuation resistivity an d phase-shift resistivity at two frequencies ${2}\,\mathrm{MHz}$ and $400\;\mathrm{kHz}^{\mathrm{`}}$ ) an d five transmitter–receiver spacings (16, 22, 28, 34, and 40 inches). The vertical resolution of these measurements is $0.5{-}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ , whic h is significantly larger than most geoVISION resistivity measurements (Table T11). Phase-shift resistivity is more sensitive to vertical features (e.g., vertical fractures and borehole breakouts) and ha s a shallower depth of investigation $(\sim\!0.3–0.8\ \mathrm{m})$ , whereas attenuation resistivity is more sensitive to horizontal features (e.g., beddin g and shallow dipping fractures) and has a deeper depth of investigation $(\sim\!0.5\!-\!1.0\;\mathrm{m})$ .  

The NeoScope uses a high-energy, pulsed neutron generato r and a variety of receivers to determine neutron porosity. Neutro n porosity is determined by the amount of hydrogen in the formatio n (fluid and sediment), which is measured by accounting for th e amount of scattered and slowed neutrons. Sediments with porosit y ${>}30\%$ and high clay content usually lead to disproportionately hig h neutron porosity values, and readings of ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ should probably b e disregarded (Ellis and Singer, 2007).  

The secondary gamma rays produced in the formation from th e neutron flux produced by the NeoScope source provide a measurement of formation density. This measurement, known as sourceles s neutron-gamma density (as opposed to an active gamma ray source, which is usually used to measure bulk density) or RHON, is also degraded when the formation water content is high. Caution shoul d be used when using RHON as a bulk density measurement becaus e the accuracy of these measurements in high-porosity sediments i n near-seafloor environments has not been evaluated.  

The NeoScope also measures azimuthal gamma ray using  a scintillation gamma ray detector in the same manner as the geoVISION tool. Annular pressure is measured by a Wheatstone bridg e strain gauge in the tool that has an accuracy of $\pm25$ psi $(0.172\,\mathrm{{MPa})}$ . Annular temperature is measured by a platinum resistor in the too l that has an accuracy of $\pm1\mathrm{{}^{\circ}C}$ . Annular pressure and temperatur e data are used for safety monitoring during drilling and for environmental corrections.  

The NeoScope tool has a measurement rate of every 2 s for th e electromagnetic wave propagation resistivity measurements and $4\,s$ for all other measurements (Table T12), which resulted in a sampling every $0.0167\mathrm{~m~}$ for the propagation resistivity and every 0.03 3 m for all other measurements as long as the ROP did not exceed 3 0 $\mathrm{m/h}$ .

# StethoScope  

The StethoScope (third tool behind the bit) uses pressure drawdown and recovery data to constrain pore pressure and fluid mobility. The StethoScope tool has never been deployed during IODP; however, similar wireline measurements were made using the Modular Formation Dynamics Tester during Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Expedition 319 (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). Durin g Expedition 372, the StethoScope was deployed at Site U1518.  

Unlike the other LWD tools that sample at regular time intervals, StethoScope measurements are only made at discrete interval s when drilling is paused (though mud pumps may be on or off). Th e tool uses a setting piston to push the BHA against the borehole wall to ensure good contact between the tool and the borehole wall.  A probe is deployed opposite of the piston to create a seal with th e borehole wall, ideally in a mud cake. The probe then uses anothe r piston system to extract fluids by decreasing pressure. Once flui d extraction stops, the pressure recovers as it equilibrates with th e pore pressure, ultimately providing a measure of the pore pressure. An advanced quartz gauge provides pressure data with an accurac y of $\pm2.2$ psi $(\pm0.015\,\mathrm{MPa})$ . To acquire quality pore pressure data, th e probe must have a good seal against the borehole wall and the por e water mobility should be greater than $10\,\mathrm{mD/cP},$ corresponding to  a permeability of ${\sim}1\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . In addition to the discrete pore pressure measurements, the StethoScope also records APWD using  a strain gauge similar to that in the NeoScope.

# TeleScope  

The TeleScope tool (fourth LWD tool behind the bit) collect s MWD data and transmits selected data channels from LWD tools t o the ship. The TeleScope uses mud-pulse telemetry to transmit dat a uphole through the fluid in the drill pipe. A modulator in the too l generates a continuous pressure wave in the drilling fluid an d changes the phase of this signal to transmit various measurement s made by the MWD tool or by LWD tools in the BHA. The mudpulsed pressure wave is read at two locations along the standpipe, which allows real-time monitoring of borehole conditions and drilling parameters and facilitates preliminary geological interpretation.  

# SonicScope  

The SonicScope (fifth LWD tool behind the bit; Figure F29) is  a multipole source tool that measures compressional and shear velocity and records full waveforms. We present velocity results in meters per second. These measurements enable a more complet e characterization of the elastic moduli of the formation.  

The SonicScope can work in a monopole or quadrupole mode. The monopole source generates a dilatational wave that travels ou t from the tool. The quadrupole source generates simultaneous dilation and compression in directions $90^{\circ}$ apart. The transmitter has  a frequency from 1 to $20\,\mathrm{kHz}$ . The arrival times of the compressiona l and shear waves are measured at the receiver section. The receive r station includes 48 digital sensors distributed among four $1.12\textrm{m}$ long axial arrays that are each aligned with one of the transmitte r quadrants.  

The SonicScope has a vertical resolution of $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ (Table T11). The tool was configured to store waveform data at $^{10~s}$ intervals, resulting in measurements every $0.083\mathrm{~m~}$ as long as the ROP remained below $30~\mathrm{m/h}$ . Waveform data recorded from the SonicScope were sent to Schlumberger in Perth, Australia, during th e expedition for the Leaky $\mathbf{P}$ and Leaky $\mathrm{^Q}$ processing needed for th e low-velocity sediments.  

# proVISION Plus  

The proVISION Plus tool (sixth and last LWD tool behind th e bit) is a NMR tool that provides formation information based on th e relaxation time of the magnetically induced precession of polarize d protons (hydrogen nuclei) in the pore and bound fluids (Ellis an d Singer, 2007). Polarization of the nuclear spins in pore fluid i s achieved by permanent magnets in the tool that produce a toroida l static magnetic field that is approximately parallel to the borehol e wall and extends several tens of centimeters above and below th e zone of measurement. Coils in the central region of the tool produce a magnetic field that, when energized at the resonant frequency, tips the spins through $90^{\circ}$ and causes them to precess. Receiver antennae tuned to slightly different frequencies detect th e signal radiating from the tipped spins in concentric annular shells  a few millimeters thick in a sensitive zone ${\sim}76\,\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter aroun d the tool axis that extends for $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ vertically.  

A series of calibrated, very short magnetic pulses radiated fro m the tool antennae stimulate pore and bound fluids to generate  a train of as many as several thousand spin echoes of decreasing magnitude. The time taken for the transverse magnetization to deca y $[T_{2}$ relaxation time) corresponds to the size of the pore space i n which the fluid resides. When used in enhanced precision mode,  a series of short, medium, and long pulse trains are combined, enabling the tool to measure the fluids in large- and medium-size d pores and the fast-relaxing spins in water bound to but not include d in clay minerals. Thus, the total fluid-filled porosity and bound water content of the formation is measured, and the distribution of relaxation times provides an indication of the pore size distributio n and clay content or hydration state. Secondary porosity (e.g., fractures and vugs) appear in the $T_{2}$ distribution as very long relaxatio n times.  

If proton spins decay too quickly to lie in the measuremen t range of the tool, then this part of the signal will not be detected. This applies to protons in solids, such as those found in hydroxyl groups in clay minerals, that are detected by the neutron porosit y tool but not by NMR. proVISION measurements have a vertical resolution of 25–5 1 cm (depending on the ROP) and a depth of penetration of $7\,\mathrm{cm}$ (Table T11). proVISION measurements were collected every $_{30\,\mathsf{s}}$ for  a data sampling rate of $0.125\:\mathrm{m}$ at an ROP of $15\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{h}$ (Table T12). After the data were collected, postprocessing and quality contro l were conducted onshore by Schlumberger. This processing produced total NMR porosity, bound water volume, logarithmic mea n value of the relaxation time, and an estimate of permeability, although the latter is applicable only to sand and silt and typically requires laboratory calibration.  

# Tool activation  

The geoVISION and SonicScope tools are battery powered , whereas the NeoScope, Telescope, StethoScope, and proVISION ar e activated by achieving a pump rate that turns on the tools via a turbine (Table T11). Pump rates used in each borehole to collect measurements from the turbine-powered tools varied based on wate r depth, although the lowest rate of tool activation was ${\sim}360\,\mathrm{gal/min}$ . In several holes, a pump rate below tool activation was maintaine d from 0 to 50 mbsf to preserve hole size and to collect high-quality, battery-powered data in recorded mode. Detailed spud-in procedures for each borehole can be found in the Operations section o f each site chapter.  

# Analysis  

# Image analysis  

Shipboard processing of geoVISION (GVR) resistivity image s included orientation of the image log to magnetic north accountin g for the magnetic declination at each well site, and static and dynamic (window size of $2\;\mathrm{m}$ ) normalizations. Quality control assessment of the image logs was performed on acquisition parameter s including tool movement (revolutions per minute), stick and slide, tool orientation, magnetometer readings, and identification of image log artifacts where present.  

Each image log provided from the geoVISION tool was adjuste d for orientation and depth of investigation (electrical penetration ) parameters. Orientation for each image was set to north, and th e orientation value was set to $-3.21$ . This value is related to the fac t that the first of the 56 bins that compose the GVR image logs ar e centered on the reference direction, and thus the edge of the firs t sector needs to be oriented a half sector counterclockwise to th e reference direction $(-[360/35]/2=-3.21)$ .  

The geoVISION tool orients images using a magnetometer inside of the tool. The image is oriented by assigning one of the acquisition bins, Bin 21, to magnetic north and assigning Bin 0 as the Pa d 1 North (P1NO), which is $225^{\circ}$ from Bin 21. To correct for magneti c declination in vertical wells, the angle of declination must be adde d or subtracted (depending on global position) to the P1NO valu e (Figure F30). This correction is often already done by Schlumberge r and should be checked prior to any attempt to correct for declination. If the P1NO values read anything other than $225^{\circ}$ , it has already been adjusted. Schlumberger corrected the GVR image log s for magnetic declination at Sites U1518–U1520.

The final step to be able to accurately measure data on borehole features from GVR image logs is to assign the images with a value for the electrical penetration (referred to as depth of investigation in Schlumberger Techlog software). Each button (shallow, medium, and deep) has a fixed electrical penetration despite having different depths of investigation. The local response of the electrical signal is the part of the signal that is used to generate the resistivity images. This response is dependent on the size of the button and the standoff, which are similar for all three buttons on the geoVISION tool. The electrical penetration is 1.5 inches for the geoVISION tool, which corresponds to a percentage of the integrated geometrical radial response needed to resolve a resistivity contrast on the image. See Faivre and Catala (1995) for more detail.  

A brief, descriptive, feature classification for GVR image logs was chosen to allow multiple subsequent interpretations and analyses (Trice, 1999). Classification included lithologic, structural, and stress-induced features (Figure F31; Table T13). The geometric and morphological interpretation of observed natural and stress-induced image log features can provide information on the lithology, stratigraphy, structure, and in situ stress character (Conin et al., 2014; Zoback, 2007; Massiot et al., 2015; Heidbach, 2016). Additionally, because gas hydrates are resistive, image logs also aided the interpretation of hydrate-bearing sediments in terms of vertical hydrate distribution and morphology with respect to the host sediments (e.g., Cook et al., 2008; Riedel et al., 2009; Collett et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014).  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

LWD data were acquired during Expedition 372 at Sites U1518– U1520 across the continental margin and Hikurangi Trough (see Logging while drilling). Cores were collected from Sites U1518– U1520 and U1526 during Expedition 375. The cores and logs, together with high-quality regional seismic profiles, enabled CLSI during Expeditions 372 and 375.  

Site U1518 LWD data were acquired from 0 to 600 mbsf across a lower slope thrust fault (Pāpaku fault), and cores were acquired (with varying degrees of recovery) from 0 to 494.9 mbsf. LWD data were acquired at Site U1519 (on the upper slope of the Tuaheni Basin) from 0 to $650~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and cores were acquired in several discrete intervals from 0 to 640 mbsf. LWD data were acquired within the incoming sedimentary section at Site U1520 from 0 to $750~\mathrm{mbsf},$ and wireline logs were acquired from 642 to 947 mbsf. Coring at Site U1520 took place from 0 to 1054.1 mbsf with varying degrees of recovery and some intervals that were drilled through without coring. Expedition 375 cored Site U1526 from 0 to 83.6 mbsf with varying degrees of recovery.  

During Expedition 372, LWD data from Sites U1518–U1520 were tied to regional 2-D seismic profiles across the continental margin and Hikurangi Trough (e.g., Multiwave, unpubl. data; Barker et al., 2009; Bell et al., 2010; Pedley et al., 2010). This work was further advanced during Expedition 375 with integration of data from cores.  

# Expedition 372 LWD data, processing, and interpretation  

The LWD BHA used during Expedition 372 included (in order from the bit up) the geoVISION, NeoScope, StethoScope, TeleScope, SonicScope, and proVISION Plus tools (Figure F29). For further details regarding the full suite of LWD tools, data type s generated, techniques, and data processing, see Logging whil e drilling.  

During the course of Expedition 372, various LWD data wer e processed on shore by Schlumberger logging scientists and then returned to the shipboard logging scientists for analysis. On th e JOIDES Resolution, LWD data were loaded into the Techlog software (Schlumberger) for processing and interpretation. These dat a included a preliminary analysis of bedding, conductive and resistiv e fractures, and borehole breakouts identified in the GVR resistivit y images.  

All LWD data collected during Expedition 372 were interprete d on board and included in the site reports. These reports, their archived Techlog projects, and the results of real-time drilling safet y monitoring and LWD-seismic integration were made available t o the Expedition 375 scientists. In addition, a complete set of the fina l processed LWD data were compiled post-Expedition 372 in preparation for the Expedition 375 scientists.  

# Seismic reflection data and seismic stratigraphy  

Data acquisition along the Expedition 372 and 375 drillin g transect consisted of multiple cruises that collected 2-D seismic reflection data supporting Hikurangi subduction margin (HSM) Site s U1518–U1520 and U1526. The HSM sites are located on or close t o 2-D Seismic Line 05CM-04 acquired in 2005 by the New Zealan d government (Multiwave, unpubl. data; Barker et al., 2009, 2018). The 2005 data were acquired using a $4140~\mathrm{inch^{3}}$ (67.8 L) air gu n source array and a $12\,\mathrm{km}$ long streamer. The calculated source signature has a fairly flat amplitude spectrum across the range of $\mathord{\sim}6-$ $100\,\mathrm{Hz}$ . Shot intervals were at $37.5\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , with a recording length of 1 2 s. These data were prestack time migrated with a $12.5~\mathrm{m}$ commo n depth point (CDP) (Multiwave, unpubl. data; Barker et al., 2009; Bel l et al., 2010).  

The vertical resolution of Seismic Line 05CM-04 at Site s U1518–U1520, and U1526 can be determined as  

$$
\lambda/4=V_{\mathrm{p}}/f,
$$  

where  

$\uplambda=$ seismic wavelength, $V_{\mathrm{p}}=P.$ -wave velocity, and $f\mathrm{=}$ dominant frequency.  

Table T14 summarizes the vertical resolution for different depth intervals at each site using velocity information from the LWD logs.  

Recently published prestack depth migration (PSDM) section s of Seismic Line 05CM-04 (Barker et al., 2018) and a preliminary ful l waveform inversion (FWI) $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity model were made available to both Expedition 372 and 375 scientists for onboard horizo n depth estimates and CLSI. These data were made available by GN S Science, New Zealand (PSDM), and Imperial College Londo n (FWI).  

Seismic data from the 2005 05CM survey are supplemented by  a suite of low-fold (48-channel) seismic data collected between 199 3 and 2015 using $45{-}300~\mathrm{inch^{3}}$ generator-injector (GI) gun sources . These data include the 1993 GeodyNZ survey on the R/V L’Atalante (e.g., Collot et al., 1996, 2001; Lewis et al., 1998); various R/V Tangaroa surveys in 2004, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2015 (e.g., Pedley et al., 2010; Mountjoy and Barnes, 2011; National Institute of Water an d Atmospheric Research [NIWA] [New Zealand], unpubl. data), an d an R/V Roger Revelle survey in 2015 (Oregon State University, unpubl. data). In particular, the 2011 Survey TAN1114 undertaken b y NIWA and GNS Science acquired drill site–specific seismic dat a with a source comprising two Sodera GI guns $\mathrm{(300~inch^{3}}$ total volume) operated in true GI mode at $\mathord{\sim}2000$ psi pressure and recorde d on a GeoEel 48-channel seismic streamer ${\sim}825\;\mathrm{m}$ long). These dat a were binned into a $6.25{-}12.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CDP spacing, bandpass filtered t o 10, 35, 150, and $200\;\mathrm{Hz}$ , and poststack time migrated using a finit e difference migration.  

A seismic interpretation project developed at NIWA using IH S Kingdom Suite supported the predrilling interpretations of site geology and Expedition 372 and 375 drilling operations. The seismi c project was developed from an initial data pack made available fro m the New Zealand Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment, in which all data are displayed with reversed polarity. Interpretations of seismic data from this project were exported to Petrel (Schlumberger) on the JOIDES Resolution during Expedition 37 2 and were available in active projects for the Expedition 375 scientists.  

# Seismic velocity models  

Four sets of unpublished seismic $P$ -wave velocity models fo r Seismic Line 05CM-04 were available to the Expedition 372 and 37 5 scientists for work on the JOIDES Resolution. These models includ e a high-resolution analysis of stacking velocity values and two PSD M models provided by GNS Science (Barker et al., 2018) and data fro m a preliminary FWI $P$ -wave velocity model provided by Imperial College London. FWI is a technique that attempts to match the seismi c waveforms trace by trace and differs from conventional velocit y building techniques that use only arrival times (Warner et al., 2013). The Imperial College FWI velocity model uses a smoothed versio n of the GNS Science PSDM model as an initial velocity field, which i s iteratively updated to produce synthetic waveforms to best matc h the real seismic data. Depth-converted seismic data derived fro m each of these models were used to evaluate the range of inferre d depths to horizon and/or fault targets at each drilling site.  

# Integration of core and LWD data  

Cores were collected from Sites U1518–U1520 and U152 6 during Expedition 375 to characterize the age and lithologic, physical, thermal, geochemical, and structural properties of the sedimen t and rock sequences. Integrating these data with LWD data collecte d during Expedition 372 enabled calibration of the logging data, improved characterization of the sites, and refinement of LWD interpretations. Integration of core and log data sets was performed wit h the Techlog software and included the following:

• All LWD data sets were compared with lithostratigraphy as interpreted from retrieved cores, including high-resolution photographic images.   
• Core measurements and LWD data of NGR were compared for consistency and calibration purposes.   
• Porosity determined from MAD measurements on core samples was compared with LWD thermal neutron porosity and NMR porosity data.   
• MAD bulk density measurements were compared with density measurements derived from the NeoScope tool (sourceless neutron-gamma density).   
• $P$ -wave velocity data measured on discrete core samples were compared with SonicScope $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ data.   
• Structural and bedding dip observations in the cores were compared with those interpreted from LWD resistivity images.   
• Selected drilling parameters from different holes were evaluated to assist with correlations.  

To aid the correlation of LWD data with core-based lithology, physical properties, and structural measurements from differen t holes at the same site, we used both the meters below rig floor an d meters below seafloor depth scales.  

# Integration of core-log-seismic data: synthetic seismograms  

We used LWD and core measurements to produce syntheti c seismic traces at the drill site for comparison with observed trace s in the seismic data. Their generation involved three steps:  

1. Producing a reflection coefficient model from LWD and core velocity and density measurements.   
2. Calculating vertical reflection times from LWD and core measurements.   
3. Convoluting the reflection coefficient model with a suitable source wavelet.  

Generally, because of problems with logging data (e.g., washouts) and errors in seismic processing, a precise match betwee n synthetic seismograms and seismic traces is rarely achieved. Instead, a suite of synthetic seismograms using different sonic calibrations and wavelets is constructed to see which best fits the seismi c data and to provide a link between the core, geophysical logs, an d seismic profiles.  

Modeling of acoustic impedance and reflection coefficients wa s conducted using two different approaches with information fro m core, LWD, and wireline data. In the first approach, we calculate d acoustic impedance and reflection coefficients using the sourceles s neutron-gamma density log from the NeoScope tool, augmente d where necessary by MAD density values spliced to the LWD densit y logs to produce a complete log. We used the compressional velocit y log from the LWD SonicScope and from wireline data acquired i n the deeper portion of Site U1520. The log measurements with hig h sampling rates were then averaged into intervals corresponding t o the frequency range of seismic data. The second approach use d physical properties information and interpretations of core data t o build a log-lithologic model that highlighted major acoustic impedance changes at unit boundaries.  

Conversion from depth to time is required during synthetic seismogram construction to allow correlation of depth-based LWD an d wireline logs to traveltime-based seismic data. This conversion wa s performed using two different methods. First, LWD and wirelin e data were used to produce interval velocity logs that were used directly to convert depth data to time. However, poor log data qualit y (e.g., due to borehole washouts) result in poor time conversions. Secondly, lithostratigraphic units that could be confidently tied t o reflection events provided “tie points” to further calibrate the timedepth relationship derived from compressional velocity and seismi c velocity data.  

Source wavelets can be obtained statistically or deterministically. Statistical determination involved recovery of the shape of th e source wavelet from a horizontal area of the seafloor over a numbe r of traces to produce a noise-free average wavelet. Deterministi c source wavelet construction involved the calculation of a wavele t that produces the best fit between the synthetic trace and seismi c data. Both approaches were applied using Schlumberger Petrel software and compared.  

The wavelets were then convolved with a reflectivity series $(R)$ expressed as the following:  

$$
R=(V_{\mathrm{p}1}\mathsf{\rho}_{1}-V_{\mathrm{p}2}\mathsf{\rho}_{2})/(V_{\mathrm{p}1}\mathsf{\rho}_{1}+V_{\mathrm{p}2}\mathsf{\rho}_{2}),
$$  

where $V_{\mathrm{p1}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{p}_{2}}$ and ${\mathfrak{p}}_{1}$ and $\rho_{2}$ are the acoustic velocity and densit y in the upper layer and lower layers, respectively.  

Direct comparison was then made between all the availabl e LWD  and  multichannel  seismic  (MCS)  reflection  data  usin g Schlumberger’s Petrel software. This comparison enabled an overall assessment and integration of the unit boundaries and internal features determined during the analysis of each independent data set.
