# Introduction  

This chapter documents the procedures and methods used in the shipboard laboratories during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 369. This introductory section in particular provides a rationale for the site locations and an overview of IODP depth conventions, curatorial procedures, and general core handling/analyses during Expedition 369. Subsequent sections describe specific laboratory procedures and instruments in more detail. This information only applies to shipboard work described in the Proceedings volume; methods used in shore-based analyses of Expedition 369 samples and/or data will be described in various scientific contributions in the open peer-reviewed literature and the Expedition Research Results chapters of this Proceedings volume.  

# Site locations  

The five sites (U1512–U1516) drilled during Expedition 369 are situated in the Great Australian Bight (Site U1512) and off southwestern Western Australia in the Mentelle Basin (Sites U1513– U1516). These sites were targeted because coring the Cretaceous sequence at different paleodepths will allow recovery of material suitable for generating records that span the rise and collapse of the Cretaceous hot greenhouse (including Oceanic Anoxic Events [OAEs] 1d and 2), providing insight to resultant changes to deepand surface-water circulation that can be used to test predictions from Earth system models. The sites are also well positioned to monitor the mid-Eocene to early Oligocene opening of the Tasman  

Gateway and the Miocene to Pliocene restriction of the Indonesian Gateway; both passages have important effects on global oceanography and climate. Coring Early Cretaceous volcanic rocks and underlying Jurassic(?) sediments in different parts of the Mentelle Basin provides information on the timing of different stages of the Gondwana breakup and the nature of the various phases of volcanism that will lead to an improved understanding of the evolution of the Naturaliste Plateau and Mentelle Basin. Previous work by both academia and industry provided site data, including seismic data acquired in 1986, 2004, and 2009 by Geoscience Australia and limited physical material (e.g., Deep Sea Drilling Project [DSDP] Site 258 and dredge samples adjacent to Site U1512 and on the margins of the Naturaliste Plateau), that were used to guide the initial operations plan for each site.  

GPS coordinates from precruise site surveys were used to position the vessel at all Expedition 369 sites. A SyQuest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor the seafloor depth on the approach to each site to reconfirm the depth profiles from precruise surveys. Once the vessel was positioned at the site coordinates, the thrusters were lowered and an acoustic positioning beacon was dropped to the seafloor. The dynamic positioning control of the vessel used navigational input from the GPS and triangulation to the seafloor beacon, weighted by the estimated positional accuracy. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over a significant portion of the time the hole was occupied.  

# Coring and drilling operations  

All four standard coring systems, the advanced piston core r (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), extended core barrel (XCB), an d rotary core barrel (RCB), were used during Expedition 369 (see Operations in the individual site chapters).  

The APC system was generally used in the upper portion of  a hole to obtain high-quality core. The APC system cuts soft-sediment cores with minimal visual coring disturbance relative to othe r IODP coring systems. After the APC core barrel is lowered throug h the drill pipe and lands near the bit, the drill pipe is pressured u p until the shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the oute r barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation an d cuts the core. The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke, ” from the pressure gauge on the rig floor.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in two ways: (1) the pisto n fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from the pum p pressure reading) because the formation is too hard, or (2) excessiv e force $^{>60,000}$ lb; ${\sim}267\,\mathrm{kN})$ ) is required to pull the core barrel out o f the formation. When a full stroke cannot be achieved, additional attempts are typically made, and after each attempt the bit is advanced by the core recovery (in meters). The number of additiona l attempts is generally dictated by the length of recovery of the partia l stroke core and the time available to advance the hole by piston coring. Note that this process results in a nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ based on the assumption that the barrel penetrates the formation b y the equivalent of the length of core recovered. When a full or partia l stroke is achieved but excessive force cannot retrieve the barrel, th e core barrel is sometimes “drilled over,” meaning after the inner cor e barrel is successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit is advanced to the full stroke depth to free the APC barrel.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used during all APC coring to  a pull force of ${\sim}40{,}000$ lb. In all Expedition 369 APC holes, orientation was attempted with either the Icefield MI-5 or Minex FlexI T core orientation tool (see Paleomagnetism). Formation temperature measurements were taken in many of the second APC holes t o obtain temperature gradients and heat flow estimates (see Petrophysics).  

Once APC refusal was reached, the HLAPC system was used. The standard APC system contains a $9.5\,\textrm{m}$ long core barrel; th e HLAPC system uses a $4.7\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, th e HLAPC system was deployed after the APC system reached refusa l to extend the total piston coring depth or when a more indurate d interval was anticipated (e.g., silicified limestones/cherts at Sit e U1513). While using the HLAPC system, the same criteria as for th e APC system were applied in terms of refusal. The HLAPC syste m allowed us to reach greater piston sampling depths and recove r more indurated material in the upper sections than would hav e been possible with the APC or XCB systems.  

The XCB coring system was used to advance the hole when th e formation became too stiff for HLAPC coring (e.g., Site U1514) o r hard substrate was encountered in the upper sections of a hole (e.g., Site U1513). The XCB rotary system has a small cutting shoe (bit ) that extends below the large APC/XCB bit. The smaller bit can cut  a semi-indurated core with less torque and fluid circulation than th e main bit, thereby optimizing recovery. The XCB cutting shoe extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediment but retract s into the main bit when hard formations are encountered. Use of thi s system resulted in the greatest loss of core quality; the majority o f XCB cores collected during Expedition 369 were highly biscuited. However, the APC and XCB systems use the same bit, so it is possible to switch between the two coring systems in the same hole.  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is the lowermost part of th e drill string. A typical APC/XCB BHA consists of a drill bit (oute r diameter $=11\%$ inches; ${\sim}20.05~\mathrm{cm}$ ), a bit subassembly, a seal bor e drill collar, a landing saver subassembly, a modified top subassembly, a modified head subassembly, a nonmagnetic drill collar, a number of 8 inch $({\sim}20.32\,\mathrm{cm})$ drill collars, a tapered drill collar, six joint s (two stands) of $5\%$ inch $({\sim}13.97~\mathrm{cm})$ ) drill pipe, and one crossove r subassembly. A lockable float valve was used when downhole logging was planned so that downhole logs could be collected throug h the bit (e.g., Hole U1513A).  

The RCB system is generally deployed when XCB coring reache s refusal (generally when the time to cut a core is ${>}90\ \mathrm{min}]$ ), but it wa s also used during Expedition 369 as an alternative to the XCB syste m and to duplicate XCB-cored intervals to recover cores with reduce d disturbance (biscuiting). The RCB system was also the only corin g system used at two sites (U1512 and U1515).  

The RCB system is a conventional rotary drilling system. Th e RCB system requires a dedicated RCB BHA and a dedicated RC B drilling bit. The BHA used for RCB coring included a $9\%$ inc h $({\sim}20.08~\mathrm{cm)}$ RCB drill bit, a mechanical bit release (if logging wa s considered), a modified head subassembly, an outer core barrel,  a modified top subassembly, a modified head subassembly, and 7–1 0 control-length drill collars followed by a tapered drill collar to th e two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe. Most cored intervals were ${\sim}9.6~\mathrm{m}$ long, which is the length of a standard rotary core and approximately the length of a joint of drill pipe. In some cases, the drill string was drilled or “washed” ahead without recovering sedimen t to advance the drill bit to a target depth to resume core recovery. Such intervals were typically drilled using a center bit installe d within the RCB bit. When coring, half cores were occasionally collected with both the XCB and RCB systems (e.g., Site U1513) to improve recovery over critical intervals (e.g., Cenomanian/Turonia n boundary) and when rates of penetration decreased significantly.  

# Coring disturbance  

Core material has the potential to be disturbed and/or contai n extraneous material as a result of the drilling process, core handling, and analysis. In formations with loose granular layers (e.g., sand), material from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down b y drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom of the hole, and the n be sampled with the recovery of the next core. This is referred to a s “fall-in.” Expedition 369 cores showed evidence of fall-in, and whe n present it affects the upper ${\sim}10{-}40~\mathrm{cm}$ of the cores. Common coring deformation includes the concave appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Another disturbance type is “flow-in,” in which th e piston coring action results in fluidization at the bottom of the core; this disturbance was seen in several cores from Sites U1513 an d U1514. Retrieval of the core from depth to the surface may result i n elastic rebound. Gas that is in solution at depth may become fre e and drive core segments within the liner apart. Both elastic reboun d and gas pressure can result in a total length for each core that is longer than the interval that was cored and thus a calculated recover y of ${>}100\%$ . If gas expansion or other coring disturbance results in  a void in any particular core section, the void can be closed by movin g material if it is very large, stabilized by a foam insert if it is moderately large, or left as is. When gas content is high, pressure must b e relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. Drilling holes into the liner releases this gas but also results in som e sediment being extruded out of the liner. In more consolidated material, a common core disturbance is biscuiting, in which fracture d material (biscuits) spin within the core barrel. In many cases, drilling slurry is injected between them. Finally, fracturing, fragmentation, and brecciation as a result of the drilling process are als o common drilling-induced disturbance types.  

The occurrence of these disturbance types is reported in th e Lithostratigraphy sections of the site chapters and graphically represented on the visual core descriptions (VCDs).  

# Site, hole, core, and sample numbering  

Numbering of the sites, holes, cores, and samples followed standard IODP protocol. Drilling sites have been numbered consecutively from the first site drilled by the Glomar Challenger in 1968, and since Expedition 301 the prefix “U” has been used to designat e sites cored by the R/V JOIDES Resolution. At a site, multiple hole s are often drilled, and a letter suffix distinguishes the holes drilled a t one site. For example, the first hole would be given the suffix “A,” th e second “B,” and so on.  

Following the hole designation, each recovered core is numbered sequentially. A cored interval is generally ${\sim}9.5\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{{]}}}$ , the lengt h of a standard core barrel, with the exception of the $4.7\;\mathrm{m}$ core barre l of the HLAPC system. The specific coring system used to recover  a core is designated by a letter representing the core type and is a suffix to the core number. The coring system letters are $\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{APC}$ , $\mathrm{F}=$ HLAPC, $\begin{array}{r}{{\mathrm{X}}={\mathrm{XCB}},}\end{array}$ , and ${\mathrm{R}}={\mathrm{RCB}}$ .  

Each recovered core is cut into ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections. The number o f sections is determined by the core recovery, and sections are numbered sequentially starting with $^{\ast}1^{\prime\prime}$ at the top of the core. Each cor e is eventually split lengthwise into working- and archive-half sections (see below) designated by either the letter “W” or “A” succeeding the core number. For depth calculation purposes (see below), the top depth of the core is equated with the top depth of the core d interval (usually in meters drilling depth below seafloor [m DSF]) t o achieve consistency in handling analytical data derived from th e cores. Sample intervals are described in centimeters within a cor e section (typically between 0 and $150\;\mathrm{cm}^{\mathrm{1}}$ ) beginning from the top o f the core section.  

Thus, the full curatorial identifier of a sample consists of the following: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, section half, and interval in centimeters measured from the to p of the core section. For example, a sample identified as $^{\prime}369.$ - U1512A-24R-3W, $50{-}55~\mathrm{cm}^{\prime\prime}$ represents a $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ interval from th e third section (working half) of Core 24R (cored with the RCB system) from Hole A of Site U1512 during Expedition 369 (Figure F1).  

# Sample depth calculation  

During Expedition 369, the cored interval was measured in meters as determined by core depth below seafloor, method A (CSFA). This calculation is defined by protocol (see “IODP Depth Scale s Terminology” at http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines) . In general, the depth below seafloor is determined by subtractin g the initial drill pipe measurement to the seafloor from the total drill pipe measurement (DSF; Figure F1). The core depth interval begin s with the depth below seafloor where coring began and extends t o the depth that coring advanced. However, if a core has incomplet e recovery $(<\!100\%)$ , all material is assumed to originate from the to p of the cored interval as a continuous section for curation purposes; thus, the true depth interval within the cored interval is unknow n and represents a sampling uncertainty in age-depth analysis or correlation with downhole logging data. Three sites (U1513, U1514, and U1516) had sections that were correlated when multiple hole s were cored to produce a splice based on a core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) scale. The calculation of this depth scale is discussed in Stratigraphic correlation.

Figure F1. IODP conventions for naming sites, holes, cores, and samples, Expedition 369. CSF-A $=$ core depth below seafloor, Method A, $\mathsf{D S F=}$ drilling dept h below seafloor.  

Additionally, wireline log depths were calculated from the wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF). When multiple logging passe s were made (see Petrophysics), the wireline log depths are matche d to one reference pass, creating the wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF). These distinctions in nomenclature betwee n core (curated) and wireline log depth should be noted because th e same depth value from different scales does not necessarily refer t o the same stratigraphic interval. In several cases, however, core to lo g tie points were provided by the stratigraphic correlators (see Stratigraphic correlation in the Site U1512, Site U1513, Site U1514, Sit e U1515, and Site U1516 chapters (Huber et al., 2019a–2019e).  

# Core handling and analysis  

For sediment cores, core catcher samples were taken for biostratigraphic analyses immediately upon arriving on deck. Th e cores were then cut into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections, after which whole-roun d samples were taken for shipboard interstitial water and noted by th e use of a yellow end cap. Additional samples taken on the catwal k include syringe samples for routine hydrocarbon gas safety monitoring (see Geochemistry). At sites where piston coring occurre d (Sites U1513, U1514, and U1516), a separate, short hole was core d to obtain samples for postcruise optically stimulated luminescenc e analyses (see Operations in the Site U1513, Site U1514, and Sit e U1516 chapters [Huber et al., 2019b, 2019c, 2019e] and core summary tables therein). In this case, all of the recovered material wa s cut into $30\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole rounds on the catwalk and immediately place d into light-proof bags.  

Once the core sections were brought inside, they were immediately run through the Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) b y the stratigraphic correlators to aid in drilling guidance (see Stratigraphic correlation) before being placed in the core racks and allowed to thermally equilibrate.  

For hard rock cores on the catwalk, pieces were pushed to th e bottom of the sections and the total length was measured as “recovered length,” which was used to calculate recovery. The section s were then brought into the core splitting room, where, if possible, the pieces of core were oriented with respect to each other; thes e relationships were marked with a wax pencil. In several cases, pieces were too small to be oriented with certainty. Pieces in a section were placed into sample bins separated by plastic core spacers. The plastic spacers were also used to indicate areas of no recovery. Adjacent pieces that could be fitted back together were curated a s single pieces. Once completed, a designated scientist, usually th e petrologist, confirmed the piece matches and drew split lines indicating where/how the pieces should be cut into archive and workin g halves. The split lines ideally maximized the expression of dippin g surfaces on the cut face of the core while preserving representativ e features in the archive and working halves.  

Once the split lines were drawn, the spacers were secured i n place with acetone in both archive- and working-half core liner s with the angle brace facing uphole, ensuring that the curated interval for each bin matched the top of each piece. The length of eac h bin was entered into SampleMaster as “bin length,” and the sum o f bin lengths of a section was entered as the “curated length.” Additionally, the length of each piece was measured along the longes t vertical dimension and entered as “piece length” (Figure F2). Following this process, the empty core liner half was placed over th e full half and taped together in several places. The cores were allowed to dry and equilibrate.  

After all of the cores (sediment and hard rock) equilibrated t o laboratory temperature $(\sim\!4\;\mathrm{h})$ , they were run through the Whole

Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) for $P$ -wave velocity, magneti c susceptibility, and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density measurements and through the Natural Gamma Radiation Logge r (NGRL). Thermal conductivity measurements were also taken (se e Petrophysics).  

For sediments, core sections were split lengthwise into archive - and working-half sections. Oriented pieces of more indurated sediments were marked on the bottom with a red wax pencil. For har d rock, the pieces were halved on the saw following the split lines an d placed into the respective working- and archive-half bin.  

The working-half sections were used for taking discrete shipboard samples for paleomagnetic, physical property, geochemical, and thin section analyses (for details see the individual laborator y group methods in this chapter) and, in some limited cases, scienc e party personal samples for postcruise research. Sampling for postcruise research was based on the sampling plan agreed on by th e science party and the Sample Allocation Committee. The majorit y of samples for personal postcruise research were taken at a sampling party at the Gulf Coast Repository (College Station, Texas, USA) on 18–22 May 2018.  

The archive-half core sections were run through the Sectio n Half Imaging Logger (SHIL), as well as the Section Half Multisenso r Logger (SHMSL) for color reflectance and point magnetic susceptibility measurements. The archive halves were described by expedition scientists visually and by smear slide analyses. Finally, most o f the sections were measured with the cryogenic magnetometer (se e Paleomagnetism).  

All instrument data collected during Expedition 369 were uploaded to the IODP Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/LORE), an d core descriptions were entered using the DESClogik application, a program used to input visual (macroscopic and/or microscopic) core descriptions (see the DESClogik user guide a t http://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation).  

When all shipboard measurements were completed, data wer e uploaded, and samples were taken, the cores were wrapped in clea r plastic film, sealed in plastic D-tubes, and transferred to cold storage on the ship. For core sections containing OAEs, which are characterized by high–organic carbon black shales, special handling wa s required. These OAE core sections were flushed with argon gas, wrapped in special plastic, and heat sealed with oxygen scrubber s inside. At the end of the expedition, the cores were transported t o the Gulf Coast Repository until the sampling party, after which the y were transported to long term cold storage at the Kochi Core Center (Kochi, Japan).

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithology of material recovered during Expedition 369 wa s primarily determined using macroscopic core descriptions an d smear slide and thin section observations. Where necessary, digita l core imaging, color reflectance spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), handheld portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF), an d magnetic susceptibility analyses were used to provide complementary description criteria. The methods employed during this expedition were modified from those used during IODP Expeditions 34 9 (Li et al., 2015) and 355 (Pandey et al., 2016). The DESClogik application was used to record and upload descriptive data into the LIM S database. Spreadsheet templates were set up in DESClogik and customized for Expedition 369 before the first core was recovered. These templates were used to generate VCDs and incorporated microscopic data from smear slides and thin sections. These additional data sets were used to quantify the texture and relativ e abundance of biogenic and nonbiogenic components. The samplin g positions of each smear slide and thin section were recorded i n Sample Master. Descriptive data were uploaded to the LIMS database and were used to produce the VCDs.  

The standard method of splitting cores into working and archiv e halves, using a piano wire or a saw, can affect the appearance of th e split-core surface and obscure fine details of the lithology and sedimentary structure. When necessary, core archive halves wer e scraped with a stainless steel or glass slide parallel to bedding fo r improved results during digital imaging and to prevent cross-stratigraphic contamination during sedimentological analysis. Cleane d section halves were first scanned using the SHIL and SHMSL (se e Petrophysics). Sediment/rock color was determined qualitativel y using Munsell soil color charts and quantitatively using the SHMSL. Because sediment color may change during drying and subsequen t oxidization, color was described shortly after the cores were split. When necessary, dry and wet digital images were acquired for har d rocks to highlight fine details not visible using only one of the methods.  

# Visual core descriptions  

VCDs were generated after descriptions were uploaded to th e LIMS database with the DESClogik software. VCDs are simplifie d graphical representations of each core in the case of sediments/sedimentary rocks (Figure F3) and of each section for igneous an d basement rocks (Figure F4). Depending on the type of material recovered, one of two VCD outputs was produced in a given core: on e to describe sediments or sedimentary rocks and the other to describe igneous rocks. Where both rock types were encountered in  a given section, two VCDs were produced to optimize the descriptiv e output.  

A summarized lithologic description is provided at the top o f each VCD. Depth and length of core sections are indicated alon g the left margin in the CSF-A depth scale. The graphic lithology i s displayed with physical descriptions of the core that include grai n size, Munsell color, sedimentary structures and lithologic accessories, bioturbation intensity, and drilling disturbance (type and intensity). Graphic patterns and symbols used in the VCDs are shown in  Figures  F5  and  F6.  In  addition,  VCDs  display  micropaleontological data, shipboard sampling locations and type, an d physical property data (natural gamma radiation [NGR], bulk density, color reflectance $[\mathbf{L}^{*},\mathbf{a}^{*}]$ , and $\mathfrak{b}^{\ast}.$ ], and magnetic susceptibility).  

# Core summary  

A brief overview of major and minor lithologies present in th e core, including sedimentary structures, lithologic accessories, an d sediment/rock color, is presented in the core summary text field a t the top of the VCD report. A summary of drilling disturbance is als o given.  

# Section-half image  

The flat faces of the archive halves were scanned on the SHI L after splitting and scraping to avoid color changes caused by sediment oxidation and drying. The SHIL uses three pairs of advance d illumination high-current-focused LED line lights to illuminate th e features of the core. A line-scan camera made by JAI imaged 2 0 lines $\overline{{\bf m m}}$ to create a high-resolution TIFF file, high- and low-resolution JPEG files were subsequently created. The full-size image s are 508 ppi (dpi). The camera height was adjusted so that the size o f each pixel was $50~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ . However, actual core width per pixel varie d because of differences in surface height of each section half. All section-half image files include a grayscale and ruler. Section-hal f depths were automatically included with images and stored in th e LIMS database.  

# Graphic lithology  

Lithologies of the core intervals recovered are represented o n the VCD sheets by graphic patterns in the Graphic lithology colum n using the symbols illustrated in Figure F5. All sedimentary bed s thicker than $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ are represented in the Graphic lithology colum n on each VCD. The major modifier of a principal lithology is show n using a modified version of the principal lithology pattern. Lithologic abundances are rounded to the nearest $5\%$ ; minor lithologie s that constitute $-5\%$ of the core are generally not shown but ar e listed in the Core summary at the top of the VCDs. Relative abundances of lithologic constituents reported in this way are useful fo r general characterization of the sediment but do not constitute precise quantitative observations.

# Sedimentary structures  

The locations and types of stratification and sedimentary structures visible on the prepared surfaces of the split cores are shown i n the Sedimentary structures and lithologic accessories column of th e VCD.  Symbols  in  this  column  indicate  the  locations  o f interstratification, bedding structures, and any other sedimentar y features, such as mottled bedding and parallel lamination (Figur e

F6). Terminology outlined in Stow (2005) was used to describ e stratification  thickness  (Table  T1).  Descriptive  terms  for  be d boundaries, such as sharp, erosive, gradational, and bioturbated, were noted in DESClogik.  

# Lithologic accessories  

Lithologic, diagenetic, and paleontologic accessories, such a s nodules, alteration halos, shell fragments, and lithic clasts $>\!2\ \mathrm{mm}$ , are indicated in the Sedimentary structures and Lithologic accessories columns on the VCDs and are also noted in the General interval comments column in DESClogik. Lithologic accessory abundance s are outlined in Table T2. Descriptions are based on the archiv e halves, but if holes or depressions caused by clasts or core splittin g were present, the working half was also examined. The symbol s used to designate these features are shown in Figure F6.

# Bioturbation intensity  

Description and intensity of bioturbation were classified using the scheme of Stow (2005) and are denoted with a color scale in the Bioturbation intensity column (Table T3; Figure F6). Any identifiable ichnofossils were described in the core summary on the VCDs.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Drilling disturbance was recorded in the Disturbance type column of the VCD using the symbols shown in Figure F6. The type of drilling disturbance is described for soft and firm sediments using the terms described in Table T4. The intensity of drilling disturbances (slight, moderate, heavy, and completely destroyed) is also described on the VCD sheet using a color scale.  

# Lithostratigraphic unit and age  

Lithostratigraphic units are numbered sequentially starting from the top of the hole using Roman numerals and are shown in the Lithostratigraphic unit column of the VCD (Figure F3). Sediment age was based on the shipboard biostratigraphy (see Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology) and magnetostratigraphy (see Paleomagnetism) and is listed in the Age column. Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biozones and paleodepth estimates based on benthic foraminifers are also included in columns on the VCDs.  

# Shipboard samples  

Positions of shipboard samples used for microscopic descriptions (i.e., smear slides and thin sections; SED), mineralogical analyses (XRD), shipboard chemical analyses (IW, HS, and CARB; see Geochemistry), micropaleontological (PAL, NANNO, and FORAM; see Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology), paleomagnetic (PMAG; see Paleomagnetism) and physical property analyses (MAD; see Petrophysics) are recorded in the Shipboard samples column (refer to key in Figure F6).  

# Sediment classification  

Sediments recovered during Expedition 369 are composed of biogenic, siliciclastic, and volcaniclastic components and were described using a classification scheme derived from Expedition 349

(Li et al., 2015) and Stow (2005), DSDP Leg 26 in the Indian Ocean, which covered part of the Naturaliste Plateau, and ODP Leg 182 i n the Great Australian Bight. The biogenic component includes openmarine calcareous and siliceous microfossils (e.g., foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, diatoms, and radiolarians) and macrofossil s (e.g., shell fragments). The siliciclastic component consists of mineral and rock fragments derived from igneous, sedimentary, an d metamorphic rocks. The relative proportion of these two components are used to define the major classes of sediment in thi s scheme.  

Lithologic naming conventions used during Expedition 369 follow the general guidelines of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP ) sediment classification scheme (Mazzullo et al., 1988), but a separate “mixed sediment” category was not distinguished during Expedition 369. As a result, biogenic sediments are those that contai n ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ biogenic grains and ${<}50\%$ siliciclastic grains, whereas siliciclastic sediments are those that contain ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ siliciclastic grains an d ${<}50\%$ biogenic grains (Figures F7, F8). We follow the namin g schemes of Shepard (1954), Pettijohn et al. (1987), Folk (1962),

Dunham (1962), and Stow (2005) for the detailed classification o f sediments and sedimentary rocks (Table T5). Sediment grain siz e divisions for both biogenic and siliciclastic components are base d on the nine major textural categories of Wentworth (1922) (Figur e F9). These categories are defined using the relative proportions o f sand-, silt-, and clay-sized particles (Figure F10, modified afte r Shepard, 1954), which can be difficult (e.g., silty clay versus sand y clay) without quantitative grain size measurements. The term “clay ” is only used to describe particle size and is applied to both clay minerals and all other grains ${<}4\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in size.  

Lithologic names assigned to these sediments consist of a principal name with major and minor modifiers that are based on composition and degree of lithification and/or texture as determine d from visual description of the cores and from smear slide observations (Figure F8).  

# Naming of siliciclastic and biogenic sediments  

# Principal names  

For sediments with ${}>\!90\%$ biogenic components, the name applied indicates the most common type of biogenic grain. For example, sediment composed of ${>}90\%$ calcareous nannofossils is calle d nannofossil ooze/chalk, and sediment composed of $50\%$ foraminifers  and $45\%$ calcareous  nannofossils  is  called  calcareou s ooze/chalk. For sediment with ${>}90\%$ siliciclastic grains, the principal name is based on the textural characteristics (Figure F10) of all sediment particles (both siliciclastic and biogenic).  

For a sediment sample that contains a significant mixture of siliciclastic and biogenic components (between $10\%$ and $90\%$ of bot h siliciclastic and biogenic components), the principal name is determined by the more abundant component (Figures F7, F8). If the siliciclastic component is more abundant (i.e., ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ siliciclasti c component in Figure F7), the principal name is based on the textural characteristics such as silty clay or sandy silt (Figure F10). I f the biogenic component is more abundant (i.e., ${<}50\%$ siliciclasti c component in Figure F7), the principal name is based on the predominant biogenic component, such as calcareous ooze.  

# Major and minor modifiers  

If a biogenic (or siliciclastic/volcaniclastic) group makes up $5\%-$ $50\%$ of the sediment and this group is not included as part of th e principal name, major/minor modifiers are generally used. When  a microfossil group (e.g., diatoms, nannofossils, or foraminifers) comprises $20\%{-}50\%$ of the sediment, a major modifier consisting of th e component name hyphenated with the suffix “-rich” (e.g., diatomrich clay) is used. The principal name is followed by a minor modifier (e.g., with diatoms), which is the most abundant componen t among those making up $5\%{-}20\%$ of the sediment. If the minor component is biogenic, then the modifier describes the group of biogenic grains that exceeds the $5\%$ abundance threshold (e.g., silty cla y with radiolarians). If the minor component is siliciclastic, the mino r modifier is based on the texture of the siliciclastic fraction (e.g., diatom ooze with clay).  

If the primary lithology for an interval of core has a major modifier, then that major modifier is indicated in the Graphic litholog y column of the VCD sheets using a modified version of the lithologi c pattern for the primary lithology. The minor modifiers of sedimen t lithologies are not included in the Graphic lithology column.  

# Naming by different lithification grades  

The following terms describe lithification that varies dependin g on the dominant composition, and the degree of lithification i s specified on the VCD:  

• Sediment samples that are composed predominantly of calcareous, pelagic organisms (e.g., calcareous nannofossils and foraminifers): the lithification terms “ooze” and “chalk” reflect whether the sediment sample can be deformed with a finger (ooze) or scratched easily by a fingernail (chalk).

• Sediment samples that are composed predominantly of siliceous microfossils (diatoms, radiolarians, and siliceous sponge spicules): the lithification terms “ooze” and “radiolarite/diatomite” reflect whether the sediment can be deformed with a finger (ooze) or cannot be easily deformed manually (radiolarite/diatomite).   
• Sediment samples that are composed of a mixture of calcareous and siliceous microfossils: the lithification terms “ooze” and “indurated sediment” reflect whether the sediment can be deformed with a finger (ooze) or cannot be easily deformed manually (indurated sediment).   
• Sediment samples that are composed predominantly of siliciclastic material: if the sediment can be deformed easily with a finger, no lithification term is added and the sediment is named for the dominant grain size (i.e., sand, silt, or clay). For more consolidated material, the lithification suffix “-stone” is appended to the dominant size classification (e.g., claystone), except for gravel-sized sediment, when the terms “conglomerate” or “breccia” are used.  

# Classification of carbonate sediments  

The principal names of carbonate sediments were decide d based on the classification by Dunham (1962) and Embry an d  

Klovan (1971) (Figure F11). Consistent with the terminology use d for Site 258 (Luyendyk and Davies, 1974), the term “silicified limestone” was used for samples characterized by fine-grained calcareous biogenic sediments that were partially or fully replaced by silica.  

# Naming of volcaniclastic sediments  

The subclassification of volcaniclastic sediments followed her e differs from the standard ODP classification (Mazzullo et al., 1988 ) in that we adopted the same descriptive, nongenetic terminolog y based on particle size classification that was employed during Le g 26 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1974). Unless an unequivocally pyroclastic origin for volcanogenic particles could be determined,  

Figure F10. Lithologic textural name classification used during Expeditio n 369. A. Shepard ternary classification diagram (Shepard, 1954). B. Biogeni c classification.  

volcaniclastic sediments were described as siliciclastic sediment s (i.e., sand, silt, etc.).  

Where pyroclastic rocks were observed, we adopted the classification scheme of Fisher and Schmincke (1984). In this instance, w e used  the  grain  size  terms  “volcanic  breccia” $:564\mathrm{~\ensuremath~{~mm})}$ , “lapilli/lapillistone” $\left(2{-}64\ \mathrm{mm}\right)$ , and “ash/tuff” $\left(<2\ \mathrm{mm}\right)$ . The ter m “hyaloclastite” was used for vitroclastic (i.e., glassy) materials produced by the interaction of water and magma or lava (Fisher an d Schmincke, 1984).  

# Igneous rocks  

![](images/b2adedac6b0bb8b877a2e20072baa5639fb042f421c0a50e47a6c5a9b4a26fa2.jpg)  
Figure F11. Limestone classification based on depositional texture (after Dunham, 1962, with modifications by Embry and Klovan, 1971), Expedition 369.  

Systematic descriptions of the primary petrology of recovere d igneous rocks and their alteration were made on each archive half, except for those made on thin sections, which are derived from th e working halves. First, lithologic unit boundaries were defined by visual identification of lithologic contacts or by inference using observed  changes  in  mineralogical  and  textural  characteristics. Second, lithologic characteristics such as mineralogical assemblage, igneous textures, and vesicle distribution were described. Third, an y alterations, together with vein and vesicle infillings and alteratio n halos, were recorded. Finally, these macroscopic observations wer e combined with those from detailed thin section petrographic studies of key igneous units and alteration intervals. Macroscopic an d microscopic observations and descriptions were recorded in DESClogik and were noted on the VCDs (Figures F4, F6).  

# Descriptive features and nomenclature  

Phenocryst-based lithology names  

Porphyritic basalts were named according to phenocryst phases , but only where the total abundance of phenocrysts was $>\!1\%$ . Th e most abundant phenocryst type was named last. For example, olivine is the most abundant mineral in a plagioclase-olivine-phyric basalt. The term “phenocryst” was used for any crystal that wa s (1) significantly (typically five times) larger than the average size o f the groundmass crystals, $(2)>\!1\,\,\mathrm{mm},$ , and (3) euhedral or subhedral. The term “microphenocryst” was used for crystals larger than th e modal groundmass grain size but ${<}1\ \mathrm{mm}$ . When macroscopic observations were possible, these microphenocrysts were also described in the DESClogik “microscopic” section in the phenocrys t columns and were used to establish the primary lithology name.  A prefix was applied as a modifier to the primary lithology names t o indicate the abundance of phenocrysts in the hand samples (Tabl e T6).  

![](images/21b90735be24b75cbbbc1570b8c444e8fc0f135f87455c79b901fb32e846633c.jpg)

Aphyric rocks were not assigned any mineralogical modifier. Likewise, in coarse-grained rocks with seriate to equigranular textures, we did not use modifiers unless there was a clear distinctio n between phenocrysts and groundmass crystals.  

Groundmass Groundmass is characterized by its grain size with standard no  
tation (Table T7).  

# Igneous textures  

For volcanic rocks, the following terms were used to describ e textures when microlites (very small crystals in glassy matrix visibl e only in thin section) are present:  

• Variolitic (fanlike arrangement of divergent microlites),   
• Intergranular (olivine and pyroxene grains between plagioclase laths),   
• Intersertal (glass between plagioclase laths),   
• Subophitic (partial inclusion of plagioclase in clinopyroxene), and   
• Ophitic (total inclusion of plagioclase in clinopyroxene).  

The following terms were used to describe flow textures:  

• Trachytic (subparallel arrangement of plagioclase laths in the groundmass), • Pilotaxitic (aligned plagioclase microlites embedded in a matrix of granular and usually smaller clinopyroxene grains), and • Hyalopilitic (aligned plagioclase microlites with glassy matrix).  

# Vesicles  

An estimate of the percentage of vesicles, their shape, and thei r average size are included on the VCDs. The division, based on th e occurrence of vesicles, was made according to the descriptions recorded in Table T8.  

# Alteration  

Vesicle and vein fillings, as well as replacement of phenocryst s and groundmass by secondary minerals, were recorded on th e DESClogik microscopic description templates. Alteration mineral s were identified by color, crystal habit, shape, and association wit h primary minerals (if recognizable). Difficulties arise in the identification of alteration minerals because many are visually similar an d are often microcrystalline or amorphous. Thus, their identificatio n remains preliminary, pending detailed shore-based studies. The degree of the overall alteration was reported graphically on the VCDs. Different patterns are used to indicate the degree of alteration (Table T9): fresh, slight, moderate, highly, and complete.

# Lithostratigraphic units  

# Sediments and sedimentary rocks  

Lithostratigraphic units were defined at each site where successions of conformable units with similar sedimentary characteristic s or phases were recognized. These successions were given consecutive downhole Roman numbers (Units I, II, etc.). When necessary, lithostratigraphic subunits were also defined (Subunits Ia, Ib, etc.).  

# Igneous rocks  

The succession of igneous rocks and associated breccias was defined as one igneous lithostratigraphic unit and was assigned a successive Roman number following the sedimentary lithostratigraphi c units in the hole. Within the igneous lithostratigraphic unit, th e boundaries of volcanic rocks were generally defined to reflect different volcanic cooling or lithologic units and assigned an Arabic number (Units 1, 2, etc.). The definition of an igneous lithologic unit i s usually based on the presence of lava flow contacts, which are typically marked by chilled or glassy margins on the upper and lowe r boundaries, or the presence of intercalated volcaniclastic or sedimentary horizons. If no such boundaries were recovered, the lithologic unit boundaries were defined according to changes in primar y mineralogy (based on the abundance of visible phenocryst an d groundmass mineral phases), grain size, color, and structural or textural variations.  

# Microscopic description  

# Smear slide  

For unlithified sediments, at least one smear slide was mad e from the archive half of each core to determine the lithology. Additional samples were collected from intervals of interest (e.g., laminations and suspected ash layers). Specific sampling locations wer e noted on the VCDs. A small amount of sediment was taken with  a wooden toothpick and put on a $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}\times7.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ glass slide. The sediment sample was homogenized with a drop of deionized water an d evenly spread across the slide to create a very thin (about $<50~\upmu\mathrm{m})$  

uniform layer of sediment grains for qualitative estimation of relative abundance. The dispersed sample was dried on a hot plate.  A drop of Norland optical adhesive was added as a mounting mediu m to a coverslip, which was carefully placed on the dried sample t o prevent air bubbles from being trapped in the adhesive. The smea r slide was then fixed in an ultraviolet light box.  

Smear slides were examined with a transmitted light petrographic microscope equipped with a standard eyepiece micrometer. The texture of siliciclastic grains (relative abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains) and the proportions and presence of biogeni c and mineral components were visually estimated using Rothwel l (1989) and recorded in DESClogik. The mineralogy of clay-size d grains could not be determined from smear slides. Note that smea r slide analyses tend to underestimate the amount of sand-sized an d larger grains because these grains are difficult to incorporate ont o the slide.  

# Thin sections  

Thin section analyses were used to complement and refine macroscopic core observations for lithified sedimentary rocks and igneous rocks. At least one thin section was examined and logged pe r defined lithologic unit, except for volcaniclastic units with frequen t alternations of massive and brecciated units where additional thinsections were made to confirm the mineralogical composition an d lithology of samples. Terminology and nomenclature hierarchy fo r thin section descriptions followed Dunham (1962) (Figure F11). Fo r sedimentary rocks, the framework of grains (modal abundance o f sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains; grain sorting; and roundness) an d the proportions and presence of matrix were visually estimated an d recorded in DESClogik. The modal proportions of siliciclastic, calcareous, biosiliceous, or other components were also estimated i n both mineral grains and cementing material. The occurrence o f identified single mineral grains was also reported in DESClogik. Fo r igneous rocks, phenocryst assemblages (and their modal percentages and sizes), groundmass, textures, and alteration phases wer e determined. Downloaded tabular reports of all igneous and sedimentary thin section descriptions can be found in Core descriptions.  

# X-ray diffraction analyses  

Samples were prepared for XRD analysis to identify the mai n mineral phases in bulk samples. In general, one or two samples ${\sim}5\$ $\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ in volume) were taken from each core. Sampling locations ar e noted on the VCDs. In preparation for bulk mineralogy analysis, samples were freeze-dried and then ground in a shatter-box for $30\,\mathrm{s}$ . Prepared samples were top-mounted onto a sample holder and analyzed using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor diffractometer mounted with  a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtered CuKα radiation. The standard locked coupled scan was as follows:  

• Voltage $=40\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
• Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
• Goniometer $\mathrm{scan}=4^{\circ}{-}70^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
• Step siz $:=0.0087^{\circ}26$ .   
• Scan speed $=0.2\;\mathbf{s}/$ step.   
• Divergence slit $\mathit{\dot{\Theta}}=0.3\:\mathrm{mm}$ .  

Shipboard results yielded only qualitative information for th e presence of the most common mineral components. Diffractogram s of bulk samples were processed (e.g., baseline removal and maximum peak intensity) with the software package EVA, which allowe d peak characterization and mineral identification. Processed files include $d\sb{\cdot}$ -spacing values, diffraction angles, and peak intensities wit h background removed. $D$ -spacing results were compared to expected values of $^d$ -spacing for minerals in the EVA database usin g aluminum oxide as a standard to monitor data quality. Muscovite/illite/glauconite and kaolinite/chlorite have similar diffraction patterns and could not be distinguished with shipboard results. Digital files with the diffraction patterns are available from the LIMS database.  

# X-ray fluorescence analyses  

An Olympus Delta handheld pXRF spectrometer was used t o conduct rapid reconnaissance analysis of element compositions fo r both sediment and igneous rock samples (split surfaces of the archive halves or thin section billets) and rock powders prepared fo r XRD analysis. We primarily utilized the “geochemistry” correctio n protocol within the “geochemistry and soil” submenu, which analyzes for elements in three energy ranges $(\mathrm{low}\,=\,\mathrm{Al},$ Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cr, P, S, and $\mathrm{Mg};\,\mathrm{main}=\mathrm{Ca}_{:}$ , Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Rb, Zr, Zn, and others; and high $=S\mathbf{r}$ , Rb, Zr, Ba, La, and Ce). In general, th e high-energy elements did not provide reliable results, but the mai n and low-range groupings yielded results that were sufficiently precise when concentrations were above instrument detection limits.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthi c foraminifers were studied from core catcher samples at all sites. A t most sites, samples from split core sections were also examined fo r both calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers, as tim e allowed, to provide more-refined age determinations or to investigate where significant changes in lithology occurred. Nannofossil s and planktonic foraminifers were used for biostratigraphy, and benthic foraminifers were used mainly to acquire estimates of paleobathymetry.  Biostratigraphic  studies  focused  primarily  on  th e identification of biostratigraphic horizons (biohorizons) in th e cores, generally the top or base of the stratigraphic range of a species. Expedition 369 used the Gradstein et al. (2012) timescale wit h the modifications discussed below.  

Identification of a sequence of biohorizons in stratigraphic order allowed the recognition of biostratigraphic zones and subzone s using standard schemes. These zones have been assigned absolut e ages based on calibrations from other areas, mainly referenced t o the paleomagnetic reversal sequence.  

All paleontological data gathered during shipboard investigations are available from the LIMS database in accordance wit h IODP policy. Species distribution data are included for every sample studied for each hole and each taxonomic group (calcareou s nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers). Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer data are provisional and focus mainly on biostratigraphic marker species, wherea s common species of little stratigraphic value are generally omitted. The tables also record suspected reworking or otherwise out-ofplace species (e.g., through downhole contamination).  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Calcareous nannofossil assemblages were examined and described from smear slides made from core catcher samples (a t ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals). Additional toothpick samples were taken betwee n core catcher samples from split core sections when necessary to refine the stratigraphic position of bioevents. Slides were fixed wit h Norland optical adhesive and cured under UV light for examinatio n using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope at $1000\times$ magnification. All photomicrographs were taken using a SPOT RTS system with th e  

IODP Image Capture and commercial SPOT software. Additiona l observations with a Hitachi TM3000 tabletop scanning electron microscope (SEM) were made to verify the preservation state of calcareous nannofossils.  

Nannofossil taxonomy follows the online Nannotax 3 databas e (http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3). The zonal scheme of Okad a and Bukry (1980; CN–CP codes) was used for Cenozoic calcareou s nannofossil biostratigraphy (Figures F12, F13). For the Mesozoic, the zonal scheme of Perch-Nielsen (1985; CC code) was used (Figures F14, F15).  

The following qualitative abundance codes were used in th e DESClogik data entry program and uploaded to the LIMS database.  

Total calcareous nannofossil abundance in the sediment was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $550\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $C=$ common $\langle>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $1\%{-}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none present).  

Abundance of individual calcareous nannofossil taxa is based o n specimens per field of view (FOV) at $1000\times$ magnification:  

• $\mathrm{V}=$ very abundant $>\!100$ specimens per FOV) • $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (10–100 specimens per FOV).   
• $C=$ common (1–9 specimens per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per 2–10 FOV).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen per 11–100 FOV).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present (1 specimen per $>\!100\,\,\mathrm{FOV})$ .  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{E}=$ excellent (no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization, no alteration of primary morphological characteristics, and specimens identifiable to the species level).   
• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics unaltered or only slightly altered, and specimens identifiable to the species level).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (specimens exhibit some etching and/or recrystallization; primary morphological characteristics somewhat altered; most specimens, however, are identifiable to the species level).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (specimens are severely etched or overgrown, primary morphological characteristics are largely destroyed, fragmentation has occurred, and specimens often could not be identified at the species and/or generic level).  

Figure F12. Neogene timescale. Planktonic foraminifer and calcareous nannofossil events, datums, and age assignments mainly follow Gradstein et al. (2012 ) and include additional Cenozoic datums recognized by Wade et al. (2011). The zonal scheme of Okada and Bukry (1980; CN–CP codes) is used for Neogen e calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy. Planktonic foraminifer zonation follows the definition of the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary at $2.59\,\mathsf{M a}$ (Gibbard et al., 2010); Zone PL6 is retained and the zonation scheme was edited to be relevant to the subtropical Indo-Pacific. FCO $=$ first common occurrence.

Planktonic foraminifers  

Planktonic foraminifers were examined from core catcher samples, and additional samples per core were examined as necessary. Sample volumes of ${\sim}20~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were washed over $45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ sieves an d then dried on a hot plate. Empty sieves were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath to minimize cross-contamination between samples, rinsed in water dyed with methylene blue to stain any remainin g foraminifers still caught in the sieve mesh to avoid contaminatin g subsequent samples, and then rinsed again with water. Dried residues $(>\!45~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction) were transferred to labeled glass vials fro m which subsamples were examined on metal trays using binocula r Zeiss Discovery V8 stereomicroscopes. Specimens of special interest were transferred to stubs for SEM study.  

Most shipboard work focused on the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction fo r biostratigraphic purposes, but the $45{-}150\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction was also examined for marker species and to scan for smaller species. Selecte d specimens were imaged using a SPOT RTS system with IODP Image Capture and commercial SPOT software for photomicrographs. Selected specimens of planktonic foraminifers were imaged using  a Hitachi TM3000 tabletop SEM after coating with conductive goldpalladium. All images are available in the LIMS database.  

Figure F15. Early Cretaceous timescale. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossil events, datums, and age assignments predominantly follow Gradstein et al. (2012). The zonal scheme of Perch-Nielsen (1985; CC code) was used for calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy. For planktonic foraminifers, th e following modifications were included: (1) Parathalmanninella appenninica was changed to Thalmanninella appenninica, (2) Paraticinella eubejaouaensis wa s updated to Paraticinella rohri, (3) the Hedbergella infracretacea Zone was changed to the Hedbergella trocoidea Zone (Sigal, 1977), and (4) the Early Cretaceou s biostratigraphic scheme between the Leupoldina cabri Zone and the Favusella $(=$ Globuligerina) hoterivica Zone follows Coccioni et al. (2007).

The taxonomic concepts for planktonic foraminiferal gener a and species follow the original descriptions by the author (with an y amendments to original species descriptions noted) and/or th e Mikrotax online taxonomic atlas (http://www.mikrotax.org) o f planktonic foraminifers.  

The Cenozoic biohorizons, their age assignments, and thei r zonal scheme follow Gradstein et al. (2012) and include additiona l Cenozoic datums recognized by Wade et al. (2011) with two modifications: (1) Zone PL6 is retained despite the fact that it now fall s wholly within the Pleistocene series following the definition of th e Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary at $2.59\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Gibbard et al., 2010), and (2) the list was edited to be relevant to the subtropical IndoPacific (Figures F12, F13).  

The Cretaceous biohorizons, their age assignments, and thei r zonal scheme are according to Gradstein et al. (2012) with the following modifications (Figures F14, F15):  

• The generic assignment of the species Parathalmanninella appenninica was changed to Thalmanninella appenninica (see discussion in Petrizzo et al., 2015), and the species Paraticinella eubejaouaensis was updated to Paraticinella rohri according to Ando et al. (2013).   
• The Hedbergella infracretacea Zone was changed to the Hedbergella trocoidea Zone (Sigal, 1977).   
• The Lower Cretaceous biohorizons from the Leupoldina cabri Zone to the Favusella $\mathbf{\Psi}=\mathbf{\Psi}$ Globuligerina) hoterivica Zone are after Coccioni et al. (2007).  

The following planktonic foraminiferal abundance categorie s relative to total sediment particles were estimated from visual examination of the dried sample in the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $530\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathsf{C}}={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $10\%{-}30\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few ( $5\%$ to ${<}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(5\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none present).  

Abundances of planktonic foraminifer species were estimate d using the following scheme:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $>\!20\%$ of the planktonic foraminiferal assemblage).   
• $C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $>\!10\%{-}20\%$ of the planktonic foraminiferal assemblage).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ of the planktonic foraminiferal assemblage).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(1\%-5\%$ of the planktonic foraminiferal assemblage).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $(\!\!\!\!\!-1\%\!\!\!\!)$ of the planktonic foraminiferal assemblage).  

Planktonic foraminiferal preservation as viewed under the ligh t microscope was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{E}=$ excellent (most specimens have a “glassy” appearance indicating little recrystallization or evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or infilling and abrasion).   
• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (some specimens show minor evidence of diagenetic overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion; recrystallization may or may not have occurred).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (most specimens show evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, and abrasion; tests infilled with cement or indurated sediment obscuring apertures).   
• $\Gamma={\sf p o o r}$ (specimens with substantial diagenetic overgrowth (including infilling), dissolution, and abrasion; foraminifers can be fragmentary and difficult to identify because of major overgrowth and/or dissolution).  

# Benthic foraminifers  

For sampling, preparation, and imaging methods, refer t o Planktonic foraminifers. Taxonomic assignments predominantl y follow van Morkhoven et al. (1986), Jones (1994), Kaminski an d Gradstein (2005), Holbourn et al. (2013), and Hanagata and Nobuhara (2015). The generic classification of Loeblich and Tappa n (1988) was used and updated in some instances, in particular fo r uniserial taxa (Hayward, 2002). The identifications of benthic foraminiferal taxa were generally made on the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction. The $45{-}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions were searched for stratigraphicall y and/or paleoecologically important taxa.  

The following benthic foraminiferal abundance categories ar e relative to total estimated sediment particles:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( $>\!30\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!10\%{-}30\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $.5\%$ to ${<}10\%$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $>\!1\%$ to $<\!5\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $(<\!1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none present).  

Paleodepth range estimates from benthic foraminiferal tax a were based on van Morkhoven et al. (1986), Kaminski and Gradstein (2005), and Holbourn et al. (2013). Paleobathymetry was assigned using the following categories:  

• Neritic $=-200\;\mathrm{m}$ below sea level (mbsl).   
• Bathyal $=200{-}2000$ mbsl; where possible, upper (200–1000 mbsl) and lower (1000–2000 mbsl) bathyal intervals were determined.   
• Abyssal $=>\!2000$ mbsl.  

# Sediment accumulation history  

Biostratigraphic and additional age determinations (such a s paleomagnetic reversals) and sediment depth below seafloor (provided by the drillers) were used to estimate the history of sedimen t accumulation for each site. Tables of estimated age versus depth ar e included for each site, as well as a graphic representation of the sediment accumulation history, except for Site U1515, which contain s extensive reworking of assemblages.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations during Expedition 369 focuse d mainly on measuring the natural remanent magnetization of archive-half sections before and after alternating field (AF) demagnetization  for  magnetostratigraphic  dating.  In  addition,  discret e samples were collected from selected working-half sections for us e in AF demagnetization and rock magnetic experiments.  

# Coordinate systems  

All magnetic data are reported relative to IODP orientation conventions: $+x$ points into the face of the working-half section, $+y$ points toward the left side of the face of the working-half section, and $+z$ points downcore. The relationship between the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) coordinates $(X,\ Y,$ and $Z,$ ) and the data coordinates $(x,\,y,$ and $z_{.}$ ) is $x=X,y=-Y,$ and $z=Z$ fo r archive-half sections and $x=-X,\,y=\,Y,$ and $z=Z$ for working-hal f sections. The coordinate systems for the spinner magnetomete r (AGICO Model JR-6A) and Natsuhara-Giken sampling cubes ar e indicated in Figure F16.

# Core orientation  

APC core orientation was achieved with one of two core orientation tools (FlexIT and Icefield MI-5) mounted on the core barrel. These tools use three mutually perpendicular fluxgate magneti c sensors and three orthogonally mounted accelerometers to monito r the movement of the drill assembly and to help determine when th e most stable and thus useful core orientation data were gathered. The information from both sets of sensors allows the azimuth an d dip of the hole to be measured, as well as the azimuth of the AP C core orientation. The orientation information contributed to paleomagnetic polarity determinations and magnetostratigraphic interpretations.  

# Magnetic measurements  

Remanent magnetization was measured using the SRM (2G Enterprises Model 760R-4K) on the JOIDES Resolution equipped wit h direct-current  superconducting  quantum  interference  device s (SQUIDs) and an in-line, automated AF demagnetizer capable o f reaching a peak field of $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Ocean drilling cores generally carr y secondary remanence components (overprints), including natura l viscous remanence and a steep downward-pointing component attributed to the drill string (e.g., Richter et al., 2007). To separate th e overprints from the characteristic remanence (ChRM), stepwise demagnetization experiments were performed, as described below.  

# Archive-half sections  

Measurements of archive-half sections were conducted usin g the Integrated Measurement System (version IMS 9.2) softwar e with a nominal sample area parameter of $17.5~\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ . The measurement interval and speed were $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ and $5~\mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s},$ , respectively. Th e response functions of the pick-up coils of the SQUID sensors have  a full width of $7.2{-}9.1~\mathrm{cm}$ at half height (Acton et al., 2017). Therefore, data collected within ${\sim}4.5~\mathrm{cm}$ of piece boundaries (or voids ) are significantly affected by edge effects. Consequently, all dat a points within $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ of piece boundaries (as documented in the curatorial record) were filtered out prior to further processing. Edge effects may also occur in a contiguous core piece if substantial heterogeneity (in intensity or direction) is present in the piece. It i s more difficult to filter out such artifacts, but calculating the averag e direction (using Fisher statistics) for each core piece could provide  a means of identifying these problems (Expedition 330 Scientists, 2012).  

For most of the section halves, we performed demagnetizatio n steps of 0, 10, and $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ When time permitted, a higher AF demagnetization field of $30~\mathrm{mT}$ (RCB cores) or more detailed demagnetization steps of 0, 5, 10, 15, and $20\ \mathrm{~mT~}$ were used. The A F demagnetization results were plotted individually as vector plot s (Zijderveld, 1967) and as downhole variations with depth. We inspected the plots visually to judge whether the remanence after demagnetization at the highest AF step reflects the ChRM an d geomagnetic polarity sequence.  

# Discrete samples from working-half sections  

Oriented discrete samples representative of lithology were collected from selected working-half sections at a rate of one or tw o samples per core. In soft sediments, discrete samples were taken i n plastic “Japanese” Natsuhara-Giken sampling cubes (or J-cube; $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample volume). Cubes were pushed by hand into the working half of the core with the “up” arrow on the cube pointing upsection. For more indurated intervals, an extruder was pushed int o the sediment, and the sample was then placed into the plastic cubes. In lithified sediment and hard rock, oriented cubes $({\sim}8~\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ wer e cut and trimmed using a dual-blade saw. Measurements of discret e samples were conducted with a spinner magnetometer (AGIC O Model JR-6A) using the Rema (version 6.0) software or the SRM using the discrete measurement mode.  

For discrete samples, we performed successive AF demagnetization with the DTech AF demagnetizer (Model D-2000) for spinne r measurements up to $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ (majority of the samples) or the in-line, automated AF demagnetizer equipped with the SRM up to $80~\mathrm{mT}$ . We analyzed the stepwise demagnetization data of the discrete samples by principal component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980) to defin e the ChRM. Demagnetization data analysis was performed using th e PuffinPlot (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012) and Zplotit (http://paleomag.ucdavis.edu/software-Zplotit.html) software packages. Bot h the section-half data collected on the SRM and the discrete sampl e data acquired on the spinner magnetometer and the SRM were uploaded to the LIMS database.  

Low-field magnetic susceptibility of both whole rounds (se e Petrophysics) and split sections (see Lithostratigraphy) was routinely measured as a proxy for the concentration of magnetic minerals.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Magnetostratigraphic interpretations for each site were constructed by correlating observed polarity sequences with the geomagnetic  polarity  timescale  (GPTS)  (Ogg  et  al.,  2012)  i n combination with biostratigraphic observations where available an d age diagnostic. We used the GPTS of Gradstein et al. (2012) (Tabl e T10), in which boundary ages for Chrons C1n–C13n and ${\mathrm{C}}24{\mathrm{n}}.1{\mathrm{n}}-$ $C34\mathrm{n}$ are orbitally tuned but those for Chrons C13r–C23r are splin e fitted.  

Expedition 369 sites are located at ${\sim}34^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . For azimuthally unoriented samples of sedimentary rocks at these sites, the polarity o f sedimentary units can be constrained with paleomagnetic inclinations only. Despite the fact that paleomagnetic inclinations will exhibit some degree of dispersion of their mean inclination, it is stee p enough to allow the sign of the inclination to be used to indicat e geomagnetic polarity.

Whenever possible, we offer an interpretation of the magneti c polarity following the naming convention of correlative anomal y numbers prefaced by the letter C (Tauxe et al., 1984). For th e younger part of the timescale (Pliocene to Pleistocene), we also us e traditional names to refer to the various chrons and subchrons (e.g., Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, etc.). In general, polarity reversals occurring at core section ends have been treated with extreme caution.  

# Petrophysics  

During Expedition 369, high-resolution petrophysical measurements were made on the physical properties of cores in the shipboard laboratory and using downhole (in situ) logging tools. Thes e data play a major role in determining hole-to-hole and site-to-sit e stratigraphic correlation, detecting stratal discontinuities and inhomogeneities, obtaining information about differences in the composition and texture of sediment, identifying major seismic reflectors, and constructing synthetic seismograms. A variety of technique s and methods were used to characterize the physical properties o f whole-round, section-half, and discrete samples. Core sections ar e generally $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ in length, so a typical coring length (stroke) of $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ yields six sections plus a shorter seventh section. Procedures fo r measuring soft sediment, indurated sediment, and hard rock (e.g., igneous rock) cores differ slightly.  

When acquired, downhole logs are used to obtain in situ measurements of physical, chemical, and structural properties of th e formation penetrated by a borehole. The data are rapidly collecte d and continuous with depth and can be interpreted in terms of th e stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, magnetic characteristics, an d geochemical composition of the penetrated formation. Where cor e recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log data may provide the onl y way to characterize the borehole section. Where core recovery i s good, log and core data complement one another and may be interpreted jointly.  

Downhole logs measure formation properties on a scale intermediate between those obtained from laboratory measurements o n core samples and those from geophysical surveys. Downhole log s are also useful in calibrating the interpretation of geophysical survey data (e.g., through the use of synthetic seismograms) and provide a necessary link for the integrated understanding of physica l and chemical properties on different scales.  

# General physical properties sampling and measurement sequence  

# Measurements of sediment core sections  

Whole-round core sections were first allowed to equilibrate t o ambient room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and pressure for ${\sim}4~\mathrm{h}$ . Afte r thermally equilibrating, sections were run through the WRMSL t o measure GRA bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and compressional wave $P$ -wave) velocity with the $P$ -wave logger (PWL) (Figur e F17). WRMSL data were collected at a nominal measurement interval of $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ . Cores recovered with the XCB or RCB systems ar e slightly smaller in diameter than those cored with the APC o r HLAPC systems, resulting in gaps between the core liner and cor e that can produce erroneous velocity measurements. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocit y was therefore not always measured with the WRMSL on section s cored with the XCB or RCB systems.  

Following WRMSL measurements, core sections were measured with the spectral NGRL (Figure F18) at a nominal interval o f $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ and a gamma ray counting time of $5\,\mathrm{{min}}$ (i.e., $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ per cor e section; each analysis consists of two measurement cycles).  

Thermal conductivity was measured on approximately one section per core (typically Section 3) by a needle probe inserted int o the soft-sediment core through a small hole drilled in the plasti c core liner near the middle of the whole-round section or by the contact probe method in half-space configuration on split cores for indurated sediment cores. After completing measurements on wholeround sections, the cores were split longitudinally, with one half fo r archiving (the archive half) and the other half (the working half) fo r sampling and analysis. The archive half was passed through th e SHMSL to measure point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance at a nominal sample interval of $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ .  

![](images/bbbab080477e82229bf491ce73df712b2b643596d78529cd16f13135a636c12f.jpg)

![](images/aab1cb6bdee02d4ef497c6f7342aafba808648e573ffdc72a07ac370cfb83514.jpg)  

Discrete samples were collected from 1–3 sections of the working half (typically Sections 2, 4, and 6) to measure wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density usin g moisture and density (MAD) procedures. Where possible, sample s were taken as close to the middle of the core sections as cor e conditions permitted. However, because of poor core recovery o r cores consisting of numerous small biscuits, discrete samples wer e taken from what were deemed the most suitable and representativ e components of the cores. At sites where multiple holes provide d overlapping intervals, the duplicate cores were not sampled an d only nondestructive analyses (WRMSL, SHMSL, and/or downhol e logs) were collected to fill gaps at sites with poor core recovery i n earlier boreholes. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity was typically measured on 1– 3 sections per split core using the Section Half Measurement Gantr y (SHMG).  

# Measurements of hard rock core sections  

Hard rock (e.g., igneous) cores were run through the WRMS L and NGRL using the method described for sedimentary core s (Figures F17, F18). Hard rock core sections containing fragment s were loaded into sterile liners in the core splitting room for examination by a petrologist who decided where the pieces should b e split between working and archive halves (see Core handling an d analysis). The pieces were then put back into liners before measurement with the WRMSL and NGRL. $P$ -wave velocity was not measured with the WRMSL on hard rock samples because the space s between the liner and the core or rock pieces would have caused a n erroneous result. After physical property measurements on wholeround cores, the cores were split into working and archive halve s and all rock pieces were labeled. The archive half was passe d through the SHMSL to measure point magnetic susceptibility an d color reflectance at a nominal sample interval of $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ . Therma l conductivity was measured approximately once per core using  a contact probe on a piece of the section half. $P$ -wave velocity wa s measured on 1–3 sections per core using the SHMG for discret e hard rock samples and on XCB and RCB section halves. MAD measurements were also taken on these samples or on discrete sample s or core fragments from the same lithology at a position near the $P_{-}$ - wave velocity samples. In some cases, core recovery was poor or th e cores consisted of numerous small biscuits. In such cases, discret e samples were taken from the most suitable and representative components of these cores.  

A full discussion of all methodologies and calculations used o n board the JOIDES Resolution in the Physical Properties Laborator y is available in Blum (1997). Details and procedures for each physica l property measurement are described below.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and magnetic susceptibilit y were measured nondestructively with the WRMSL (Figure F17). T o optimize the process, sampling interval and measurement integration time $\operatorname{2.5}\mathtt{c m}$ and $5\;{\bf s},$ respectively) were the same for all sensors. These sampling intervals are common denominators of the distances between the sensors installed on the WRMSL $\left(30\thinspace\mathrm{cm}\right)$ , whic h allows for efficient sequential and simultaneous measurements. Such relatively high resolution measurements are a prerequisite t o ensure the potential detection of Milankovitch cycles. After measuring every core, the fidelity of the measurements was monitore d by passing a single core liner filled with deionized water through th e WRMSL. When required, the STMSL was operated for fast-tracke d measurement of the whole-round cores with $10~\mathrm{cm}$ spacing, measuring GRA bulk density and magnetic susceptibility before th e cores had thermally equilibrated. This allowed us to provide preliminary  information  on  the  cores  to  be  used  for  stratigraphi c correlation of overlapping holes at a given site (see Stratigraphi c correlation).  

# GRA bulk density  

GRA density provides an estimate of bulk density of the cor e based on attenuation of a gamma ray beam. The beam is produce d by a $^{137}\!C s$ gamma ray source at a radiation level of $370\,\mathrm{MBq}$ within  a lead shield with a $5\;\mathrm{mm}$ collimator and directed through the wholeround core. The gamma ray detector on the opposite side of th e core from the source includes a scintillator and an integral photomultiplier tube to record the gamma radiation that passes throug h the core. The attenuation of the gamma rays occurs primarily b y Compton scattering, in which the gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. The degree of scattering is related to the material bulk density. The density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity o f the attenuated gamma rays and can be expressed as  

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I/I_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$I=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

The $\upmu,I_{0},$ and $^d$ are treated as constants so that $\uprho$ can be calculate d from $I.$  

In general, WRMSL GRA density measurements are most accurate when taken on a completely filled core liner with minimal drilling disturbance; otherwise, measurements tend to underestimat e true values. By default, the instrument reports measurements usin g the internal diameter of the core liner $\left(66\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for most sediment core s obtained with the APC system. For sediment and/or hard roc k cored by the XCB or RCB systems, core diameter is usually ${\sim}58~\mathrm{mm}$ or less, resulting in an underestimated density for these cores. Th e spatial resolution of the GRA densitometer is less than $\pm1\;\mathrm{cm}$ . Th e gamma ray detector is calibrated with sealed calibration cores (on e standard core liner filled with distilled water and aluminum cylinders of various diameters). To establish the calibration curves, gamma ray counts were taken through each aluminum cylinder fo r $60\;\mathrm{s}$ . Each aluminum cylinder has a density of $2.7\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and $^d$ is 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The relationship between $I$ and $\upmu d$ is  

$$
\ln(I)=\mathrm{A}(\upmu d)^{2}+\mathrm{B}(\upmu d)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where the coefficients A, B, and C are instrument constants determined from the calibration. Recalibration was performed as neede d when the estimated deionized water standard deviated significantl y (more than a few percent) from $1\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magneti c field:  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field of strength $H$ . The bulk magnetic susceptibility depends on it s mineralogical composition, the magnetic susceptibility of the minerals, and sometimes the size of the particles. Ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g., magnetite and maghemite) have relatively high positiv e magnetic susceptibility and can produce large bulk magnetic susceptibility in a rock even when present at low concentrations. Antiferromagnetic (hematite and goethite) and paramagnetic (smectite, illite, and chlorite) minerals have lower positive magnetic susceptibility and can produce weak bulk rock magnetic susceptibility in th e absence or near absence of ferromagnetic minerals. Diamagneti c minerals (calcite, quartz, and kaolinite) have very low negative magnetic susceptibility and produce null or slightly negative bulk roc k magnetic susceptibility in the absence of other magnetic minerals. Igneous materials typically have a magnetic susceptibility that i s two orders of magnitude greater than their alteration products, such as clay minerals.  

Magnetic susceptibility core measurements on the WRMS L were made using a $9~\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter Bartington MS2C loop senso r (Figure F17). An oscillator circuit in the sensor, which operates at  a frequency of $0.565\ \mathrm{kHz}$ and an alternating field of ${\sim}140\ \mathrm{A/m},$ produces a low-intensity, nonsaturating alternating magnetic field. Sediment and hard rock core sections going through the influence o f this field cause a change in oscillator frequency. Frequency information returned in pulse form to the susceptometer is converted int o magnetic susceptibility. The loop sensor has a spatial resolution o f $23{-}27~\mathrm{mm}$ and is accurate to within $2\%$ . Converting from instrument units (IU) to dimensionless SI units for magnetic susceptibility requires standards with known magnetic susceptibility values. None were available on the ship, and magnetic susceptibility measurements are therefore reported in IU.  

# $\pmb{P}$ -wave velocity  

$P$ -wave (compressional) velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ data can be used to evaluate small-strain moduli, correlate between downhole logging an d core data, and evaluate porosity and cementation. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity i s determined by measuring the time required for a compressiona l wave to travel a specific distance through the core:  

# VP = d/tcore ,  

where $^d$ is the path length and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is the traveltime through th e core.  

The PWL measures the traveltime of $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasonic wave s traveling horizontally across the core while it remains in the cor e liner. Waves are transmitted to the core by plastic transducer contacts connected to linear actuators. Pressure is applied to the actuators to ensure coupling between the transducers and the core liner. The total traveltime, $t_{0},$ is the sum of  

$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry,   
$t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure,   
$t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner, and   
$t_{\mathrm{core}}=$ traveltime through the core.  

The system is calibrated using a core liner filled with distilled water, which provides control for $t_{\mathrm{delay}},\,t_{\mathrm{pulse}},$ and $t_{\mathrm{liner}}$ . From these calibrations, $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ can be calculated for the whole-round specimens in cor e liners as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{cl}}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{0}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{cl}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner and $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness.  

This equation assumes that the core completely fills the core liner. The WRMSL PWL was usually turned off for XCB and RCB cor e segments that did not fill the core liner.  

# Natural Gamma Radiation Logger measurements  

Gamma radiation is emitted from the decay of mineral-hoste d $^{238}\mathrm{U},$ $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ . The NGRL measures this natural emission o n whole-round cores using a system designed and built at Texas A& M University (USA) by the IODP JOIDES Resolution Science Operato r (Figure F18) (Vasiliev et al., 2011; Dunlea et al., 2013). When $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotopes decay, they and their daughter product s emit gamma radiation at specific energy levels unique to each isotope. NGR spectroscopy measures a wide energy spectrum that ca n be used to estimate the abundance of each isotope based on th e  

Figure F19. Main elements of the NGRL (Vasiliev et al., 2011).  

![](images/0fc4ef7459d703b88655d3980e9adfbf33a7cd29d1ea557afd24837cba68d9c6.jpg)  

strength  of the  signal  at  characteristic energies  (Blum,  1997; Gilmore, 2008). In sediments and sedimentary rocks, Th and K ar e usually associated with particular clay minerals, whereas U is ofte n encountered in either clay minerals or organic-rich material. Because minor changes in the abundance of clay minerals produce  a relatively large variation in gamma radiation, NGR data are useful a s a lithologic indicator, aiding in core-to-core correlation. Thes e spectral data were then processed to estimate U, Th, and K abundance (e.g., De Vleeschouwer et al., 2017).  

The NGRL system was installed on the renovated JOIDES Resolution in 2009 and has been used on every JOIDES Resolution expedition starting with Expedition 320. The NGRL system consists o f eight sodium iodide-thallium (NaI[Tl]) detectors arranged at $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals under the lower half of the core section (Figure F19). Dat a are collected in two measurement cycles, each of which produc e NGRL measurements at eight positions within the core section pe r $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ section. During the first measurement cycle, the first detector is located $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ from the top of the core section, thus producin g eight measurements at odd multiples of $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ from the top of th e core. The core is then advanced $10~\mathrm{cm}$ , producing another eigh t measurements at even multiples of $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ from the top of the core. The detector array has both passive (layers of lead) and active (plastic scintillators) shielding to reduce the background environmental and cosmic radiation. The plastic scintillators are positioned abov e the core section and detect incoming high-energy gamma an d muon cosmic radiation, which is removed from the total counted b y the $\mathrm{{NaI}(T l)}$ detectors. The passive (lead) layers separate the $\mathrm{{NaI}(T l)}$ detectors, isolating the portion of core being measured. The qualit y of the energy spectrum measured in a core depends on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample and on the measuremen t time, with longer duration measurements yielding better spectra. Measurement times were chosen to be $5\;\mathrm{min}$ per measurement cycle, or ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{min}$ per core section, or $60\,\mathrm{{min}}$ per core. This yields statistically significant energy spectra for most lithologies (Vasiliev e t al., 2011).  

# Thermal conductivity core measurements  

Thermal conductivity was measured on approximately one section per core (usually Section 3) with the TK04 (TeKa Berlin) system using the needle probe method in full-space configuration fo r whole-round soft-sediment cores (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959 ) or the contact probe method in half-space configuration on spli t cores for indurated sediment and hard rock. The probes contain  a heater wire and calibrated thermistor.  

Figure F20. Thermal conductivity TK04 (Teka Bolin) system largely showin g the insulated case where the thermal conductivity measurements wer e obtained.  

![](images/1abc88b71d798aa0f86047eac2f519958a653d116162408c154db7369fa9be31.jpg)  

For soft sediment, the needle probe was inserted into a $2~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter hole drilled through the liner along one of the lines marking where the core was later to be split into working and archiv e halves. For indurated sediment and hard rock cores, samples wer e selected from the working half and returned unaltered to the cor e liner upon completion of the tests. Measurements were taken with  a contact probe embedded in the surface of an epoxy block with a lo w thermal conductivity (Vacquier, 1985). To avoid interference fro m air flow in the laboratory during the thermal conductivity measurement, the core section was placed into an enclosed box insulate d with foam (Figure F20).  

To measure thermal conductivity, the probe heat source wa s turned on and the increase in temperature was recorded over $^{80\;s}$ . A heating power of $0.7{-}1.7\ \mathrm{W/m}$ was typically used in soft sediment, and $1.2{-}1.9\;\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}$ was used for indurated material. The solution to the heat conduction equation with a line source of heat wa s then fitted to the temperature measurements to obtain the therma l conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductive than sediment or hard rock, the probe is assumed to be a perfect conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of the probe has a linea r relationship with the natural logarithm of the time after heating wa s initiated:  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

# where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\left(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (s), and   
$C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three measuring cycles were automatically performed, and th e probe and sample were allowed to reequilibrate for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ betwee n each cycle. The conductivity was taken to be the average of the conductivity determined from each cycle. A self-test, which included  a drift study, was conducted at the beginning of each measuremen t cycle. Once the probe temperature stabilized, the heater circuit wa s closed and the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Therma l conductivity was calculated from the rate of temperature rise whil e the heater current was flowing. Temperatures measured during th e first $80\;\mathrm{s}$ of the heating cycle were fitted to an approximate solutio n of a constantly heated line source (for details, see Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Measurement errors were $5\%{-}10\%$ .

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

Color reflectance and point magnetic susceptibility were measured by the core description team on archive halves using th e SHMSL (Figure F21). The archive half of the split core was place d on the core track, above which an electronic platform moves along  a track, recording the height of the split-core surface with a laser sensor. The laser establishes the surface topography of the section, an d then the platform reverses the direction of movement, moving fro m the core section end (lower in the borehole) to top (higher in th e borehole) while making measurements of point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance. Also, because the SHMSL requires flus h contact between the magnetic susceptibility point sensor and th e split core, measurements were made on the archive halves of spli t cores, which were covered with clear plastic wrap. Any foam insert s were removed from the section-half cores before measurement, s o the measured range of values represents that of the core material only. During Expedition 369, point magnetic susceptibility an d color reflectance data were collected at a nominal interval of $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ for each core.  

# Color reflectance spectrophotometry  

The color reflectance spectrometer uses an Ocean Optics QEPro Peltier-cooled spectrophotometer mounted on the automate d SHMSL that uses both halogen and LED light sources, which cover s wavelengths from ultraviolet through visible to near infrared. Measurements were taken from 380 to $900\ \mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths at a $2~\mathrm{nm}$ interval every $3\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ along the archive-half section. The data are reported using the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{b}^{\ast}$ color system, in which $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ i s redness (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ is yellownes s (positive) versus blueness (negative). The color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure white (reference) and pur e black (dark). Color calibration was conducted approximately onc e every $^{6\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ (twice per shift). Clear plastic film was used to cover al l sections to keep the material from collecting on the detectors and t o avoid any discrepancies from the use of the plastic wrap.  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

Point measurements of magnetic susceptibility were taken wit h a Bartington Instruments MS2K contact probe with a flat $15~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter circular sensor, a $25~\mathrm{mm}$ field of influence, and an operational frequency of $930~\mathrm{Hz}$ . The instrument averages three measurements from the sensor at each position on the core, leading t o an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . The spatial resolution of the point magneti c susceptibility instrument is ${\sim}25.4\,\mathrm{~mm}$ diameter full-width-halfmaximum, which is higher than the $100\;\mathrm{mm}$ resolution of the MS2 C sensors on the WRMSL. The probe is zeroed in air slightly abov e the core before each measurement to compensate for the influenc e of the metal track. The point magnetic susceptibility meter was calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on the ship and i s quality checked every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ at the same time as color reflectance sensor calibration.  

# Section Half Measurement Gantry measurements of $P.$ -wave velocity  

For sediment and hard rock cores, $P$ -wave velocity was performed on the working halves using the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis caliper contact prob e transducer on the SHMG, with at least one analysis per core. $P$ -wav e velocity measurements were taken on intact core sections at positions coinciding as much as possible with the MAD sample locations (see Discrete sample measurements of moisture an d density). For cores that did not have intact sections, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocit y measurements were taken on either the MAD samples or on large r pieces obtained from the same core section with the same litholog y and as nearby a position in the core as possible. The $P.$ -wave velocit y system on the SHMG uses Panametrics-NDT Microscan delay lin e transducers (Figure F22) transmitting at $0.5~\mathrm{MHz}$ . The signal received through the section half or discrete sample was digitally recorded, and the first arrival was picked automatically. The distanc e between transducers was measured with a built-in linear voltag e displacement transformer. Calibration was performed with a serie s of acrylic cylinders of differing thicknesses and a known $P$ -wave velocity of $2750\pm20\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . The system time delay determined from calibration was subtracted from the picked arrival time to estimate th e $P_{\|}$ -wave traveltime through the sample. The thickness of the sampl e (calculated by the linear voltage displacement transformer) was divided by the traveltime to calculate $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity in meters pe r second.  

# Discrete sample measurements of moisture and density  

Discrete samples were collected from the working halves of th e core to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, wate r content, and porosity using MAD analysis techniques. Sample s were taken from 1–3 sections per core, and additional samples wer e

taken as warranted by lithology changes. At sites where multipl e holes provided overlapping intervals, the duplicate cores were no t sampled. In soft sediment, ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ samples were collected with  a plastic syringe and placed in glass vials for measurements. In indurated sediment and hard rock, samples were cut with a saw from th e working halves; more often than not, these samples correspon d with the same interval collected for discrete paleomagnetic analyses.  

# Sample preparation  

Soft-sediment samples were placed in numbered, preweighe d ${\sim}16~\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment weighing, drying, and dry volume measurements. To determine the wet mas s of well-indurated samples (typically basalt, cemented breccia, an d sandstone), we placed the samples in individual plastic vials fille d with seawater and used a vacuum chamber to force saturation in th e pore spaces. The vacuum pump removed the air from the chambe r to a pressure of ${\sim}40{-}50\,\mathrm{kPa}$ below atmospheric pressure, thereby, i n theory, forcing seawater into the samples. These samples were kep t under saturation for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ with the vacuum maintained in th e chamber by turning the pump on for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ every $^\textrm{\scriptsize5h}$ . After removal from the saturator, the cubes were patted dry with a pape r towel, and wet mass was immediately determined using the dual balance system. The samples were then dried and measured for dr y mass and the volume.  

# Dual balance mass measurement  

The weights of wet and dry samples were determined to a precision of $0.005\,\mathrm{g}$ using two Mettler-Toledo XS204 electronic balances, with one acting as a reference. A standard weight of similar value t o the sample was placed upon the reference balance to increase accuracy. A computer averaging system was used to compensate for th e ship’s motion. The default setting of the balances is 300 measurements (taking ${\sim}90\;\mathrm{s}$ ).

# Pycnometer volume measurement  

Dry sample volume was determined using a six-celled, customconfigured Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacemen t pycnometer (Figure F23). The precision of each cell is $1\%$ of the fullscale volume. Volume measurement was preceded by three purge s of the sample chamber with helium warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run for each sample. A reference volume (se t of two calibration spheres) was placed in one of the chamber s during each set of measurements to check for instrument drift an d systematic error. The reference volume was moved sequentially between chambers such that each chamber was calibrated in turn every five sets of measurements. The volumes occupied by th e Wheaton vials used for soft-sediment samples were calculated before the expedition by dividing each vial’s weight by the averag e density of the vial glass. Dry mass and volume were measured afte r samples were heated in an oven at $105^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and allowe d to cool in a desiccator. The procedures for the determination o f these physical properties comply with the American Society fo r Testing and Materials (ASTM) designation (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). The fundamental relation and assumptions for th e calculations of all physical property parameters are discussed b y Blum (1997) and summarized below.  

# Mass and volume calculation  

We measured wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volum e $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ . Salt precipitated in sediment pores during the drying proces s is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporate d water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ in the sample are given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}\;\mathrm{and}}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[s/(1-\mathrm{s})],}\end{array}
$$  

where s is the assumed saltwater salinity (0.035) corresponding to  a pore water density $(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ of $1.024~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ o f $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $\textstyle(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of por e water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of sal t $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\mathrm{[}V_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},}\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{pw}}},\qquad}\\ {M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},\qquad}\\ {M_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),}\\ {V_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{solit}}/\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{solit}}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}},
$$  

where rm is the ratio of mass between equal volumes of freshwate r and seawater (a computational constant of 0.965).  

# Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as th e ratio of mass of interstitial water to wet sediment (total) mass:  

$$
\mathbf{W}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grai n density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio (VR) are calculated as  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{\mathrm{{pdry}}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{psolid}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{exp}}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},\,\mathrm{and}}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{pR}}}=V_{\mathrm{per}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.}\end{array}
$$  

Moisture and density properties reported in the physical properties sections of all site chapters were calculated with the MADMax shipboard program using the program’s predefined “Metho d C.” In Method C, the wet and dry mass and dry volume are measured, and the other physical properties are derived using the abov e equations.  

# Downhole logging  

# Wireline logging  

During wireline logging operations, the logs were recorde d with Schlumberger logging tools combined into tool strings lowered into the hole after coring operations are completed. Differen t tool string configurations were used during Expedition 369. Thes e tool strings included the triple combination (triple combo) too l string, which measures NGR, porosity, density, and resistivity, an d the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string, which provides FMS resistivity images of the borehole wall and sonic velocities. An alternate configuration was selected for logging most hole s (Figure F24); this tool configuration is herein referred to as th e Quambo because it incorporates the sonic tool onto the traditiona l triple combo at the expense of the porosity tool, which was removed to stay below the maximum tool power consumption limit. The standard triple combo tool string (minus magnetic susceptibility) and FMS/porosity tools were also used to log segments of Hol e

U1513E. Additionally, the Vertical Seismic Imager (VSI) was use d to create a vertical seismic profile (VSP) in Hole U1513E.  

Each tool string contains a telemetry cartridge for communicating through the wireline to the Schlumberger data acquisitio n system (MAXIS unit) on the drillship. In preparation for logging, the boreholes were cleaned, flushed of debris using drilling fluid, and filled with seawater-based logging gel (sepiolite mud mixe d with seawater and weighted with barite; approximate density $=$  

$10.5\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal},$ ${\sim}1258\ \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{3})$ ) to help stabilize the borehole walls. Th e BHA was typically pulled up to $\sim\!70{-}150\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ to expose th e deeper borehole wall for wireline measurement while also stabilizing the upper portion of the hole. The tool strings were then lowered downhole on a seven-conductor wireline cable before bein g pulled up at constant speed to provide continuous log measurements of several properties simultaneously.  

Each tool string deployment is termed a logging “run.” Durin g each run, tool strings can be lowered and pulled up in the hole several times to check repeatability and to increase coverage of th e FMS borehole images. Each lowering or hauling-up of the too l string while collecting data constitutes a “pass.” Incoming data wer e recorded and monitored in real time on the MCM MAXIS loggin g computer. An active wireline heave compensator (WHC) was use d to minimize the effect of ship’s heave on the tool position in th e borehole (see below).  

# Wireline logged sediment properties and tool measurement principles  

The logged properties and the principles used in the tools tha t measure them are briefly described below. More detailed information on individual tools and their geological applications may b e found in Serra (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989, 1994), Ride r (1996), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), and Ellis and Singe r (2007). A complete online list of acronyms for the Schlumberge r tools and measurement curves is at http://www.apps.slb.com/cmd and http://iodp.tamu.edu/tools/logging/index.html.  

# Downhole natural gamma radiation  

The Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS ) measured the NGR of the borehole when the standard triple combo, modified Quambo, or FMS-sonic tool strings were deployed downhole (Figure F24). The HNGS uses two bismuth germanate scintillation  detectors  and  five-window  spectroscopy  to  determin e concentrations of K (in weight percent), Th (in parts per million), and U (in parts per million) from the characteristic gamma ray energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay serie s that dominate the natural radiation spectrum. The computation o f the elemental abundances uses a least-squares method of extractin g U, Th, and K elemental concentrations from the spectral measurements. The HNGS filters out gamma ray energies $<500\ \mathrm{keV},$ eliminating sensitivity to bentonite or KCl in the drilling mud an d improving measurement accuracy. The HNGS also provides a measure of the total gamma ray emission (HSGR) and uranium-free o r computed gamma ray emission (HCGR), which are measured i n American Petroleum Institute units (gAPI). The HNGS response i s influenced by the borehole diameter; therefore, the HNGS data ar e corrected for borehole diameter variations during acquisition.  

An additional NGR sensor was housed in the Enhanced Digita l Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC) at the top of each tool string (Figur e F24). The EDTC is primarily used to communicate data to the surface. The sensor includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector tha t also measures the total NGR emission of the formation. The EDT C is not a spectral tool (it does not provide U, Th, and K concentrations), but it provides total gamma radiation for each pass. The inclusion of the HNGS in the triple combo, Quambo, and FMS-soni c tool strings means that the gamma ray data can be used to matc h depths between logging strings and passes and for core-log integration.  

# Density and photoelectric factor  

Formation density was measured downhole with the Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS) (Figure F24). The sond e contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source $\mathrm{\left(622\keV\right)}$ and far and near gamma ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid, which is pressed against the borehole wall by a hydraulically activated decentralizing arm. Gamma rays emitted by the source undergo Compton scattering, in which gamma rays are scattered b y electrons in the formation. The number of scattered gamma ray s that reach the detectors is proportional to the density of electrons i n the formation, which is in turn related to bulk density. Porosity ma y also be derived from this bulk density if the matrix (grain) density i s known.  

The HLDS also measures the photoelectric effect factor (PEF),  a measure of the photoelectric absorption of low-energy gamma radiation. Photoelectric absorption occurs when the energy falls belo w $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of being repeatedly scattered by electrons in th e formation. PEF is determined by comparing the counts from the fa r detector in the high-energy region, where only Compton scatterin g occurs, with those in the low-energy region, where count rates depend on both reactions. Because PEF depends on the atomic number of the elements in the formation (heavier elements have highe r PEF), it also varies according to the chemical composition of th e minerals present and can be used to identify the overall mineral make-up of the formation. For example, the PEF of calcite i s $5.08\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , illite is $3.03\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , quartz is $1.81\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , K-feldspa r is $2.86\,\mathrm{\barn/e^{-}}$ , and pure pyrite is $16.97\,\mathrm{\barn/e^{-}}$ (where barn $=$ $10^{-24}\,{\mathsf{c m}}^{2},$ . Contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential for good-quality HLDS logs; poor contact results in underestimation of density values. Both the density correction and caliper measurement of the hole are used to check the contact quality. In th e deeper parts of the hole, the PEF log should be used with caution, especially in washouts, because barium in the logging mud swamp s the signal, despite correction for mud effect.  

# Porosity  

Formation porosity was measured downhole with the Accelerator Porosity Sonde (APS) (Figure F24). The APS was not part of th e Quambo tool string (it was only deployed at Site U1513E) becaus e of time constraints and borehole stability concerns and the potential for washed out intervals that interfere with the APS measurements. The sonde includes a minitron neutron generator that produces fas t $(14.4\mathrm{~MeV})$ neutrons and five neutron detectors (four epithermal and  one  thermal)  positioned  at  different  distances  from  th e minitron. The tool’s detectors count neutrons that arrive at the detectors after being scattered and slowed by collisions with atomi c nuclei in the formation.  

The highest energy loss occurs when neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei, which have practically the same mass as the neutro n (the neutrons bounce off of heavier elements without losing muc h energy). If the hydrogen (i.e., water) concentration is low, as in lowporosity formations, neutrons can travel farther before being captured and the count rates increase at the detector. The opposite effect occurs in high-porosity formations where the water content i s high. However, because hydrogen bound in minerals such as clay s or in hydrocarbons also contributes to the measurement, the ra w porosity value is often an overestimate.  

Upon reaching thermal energies $(0.025\ \mathrm{eV})$ , the neutrons ar e captured by the nuclei of chlorine, silicon, boron, and other elements, resulting in a gamma ray emission. This neutron-captur e cross section $(\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}})$ is also measured by the tool.  

# Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) tool provides si x resistivity measurements (including the borehole or mud resistivit y and five measurements of formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation) with different depths of investigatio n (Figure F24). The tool sends a focused current into the formatio n and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constant drop i n voltage across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurements. The array has one central (source) electrode and six electrodes above and below it that serve alternatively as focusing an d returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role of thes e electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool is designed to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the same time and tool position and t o reduce the sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects when crossing shar p beds thinner than the electrode spacing. The design of the HRLA, which eliminates the need for a surface reference electrode, improves formation resistivity evaluation compared to traditional dua l induction and allows the full range of resistivity to be measured, from low (e.g., in high-porosity sediments) to high (e.g., in basalt). The HRLA needs to be centralized in the borehole during the ru n for optimal results, so knuckle joints were used to centralize th e HRLA while allowing the density and porosity tools to maintai n good contact with the borehole wall.  

Calcite,  silica,  and  hydrocarbons  are  electrical  insulators, whereas ionic solutions like interstitial water are conductors. Electrical resistivity, therefore, can be used to evaluate porosity for  a given salinity and resistivity of the interstitial water. Clay surfac e conduction also contributes to the resistivity values, but at high porosities, this is a relatively minor effect.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) measures the transit times between sonic transmitters and an array of eight receivers and combines replicate measurements, thus providing a direct measuremen t of sound velocity through formations that is relatively free from th e effects of formation damage and an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989) (Figure F24). Along with the monopole transmitter s found on most sonic tools, the DSI also has two crossed-dipol e transmitters that allow the measurement of shear wave velocity i n addition to compressional wave velocity. Dipole measurements ar e necessary to measure shear velocities in slow formations with shea r velocity less than the velocity of sound in the borehole fluid. Suc h slow formations are typically encountered in deep-ocean drilling.  

# Formation MicroScanner  

The FMS provides oriented, high-resolution electrical resistivity–based images of borehole walls (Figure F24). The tool has fou r orthogonal arms and pads, each containing 16 button electrode s that are pressed against the borehole wall during logging. The electrodes are arranged in two diagonally offset rows of eight electrode s each. A focused current is emitted from the button electrodes int o the formation, and a return electrode is located near the top of th e tool. Resistivity of the formation at the button electrodes is derive d from the intensity of current passing through the button electrodes.  

Processing of the resistivity measurements offshore at LamontDoherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) generates oriented high-resolution images that reveal geologic structures of the borehole wall. Features such as bedding, stratification, fracturing, slump folding, and bioturbation can be resolved (Luthi, 1990; Salimullah and Stow, 1992; Lovell et al., 1998). Because the images are oriented to magnetic north, further analysis can provide measurement of the di p and direction (azimuth) of planar features in the formation. In addition, when the corresponding planar features can be identified i n the recovered core samples, individual core pieces can be reoriente d with respect to true north.  

The maximum extension of the caliper arms is $40.6~\mathrm{~cm}$ (16 inches). In holes or in sections of holes with a diameter greate r than this maximum, the pad contact at the end of the caliper arm s will be inconsistent, and the FMS images may appear out of focu s and too conductive. For example, irregular (rough) borehole wall s will also adversely affect the images if contact with the wall is poor. The standard procedure is therefore to make two full uphole passe s with the FMS to maximize the chance of getting full borehole coverage with the pads. This method also helps to ensure that adequat e data coverage is obtained because only $\sim\!30\%$ of a borehole with  a diameter of $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ is imaged during a single pass.  

# Magnetic susceptibility sonde  

The magnetic susceptibility sonde (MSS) is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by LDEO (Figure F24). It measures the ease wit h which formations are magnetized when subjected to a magneti c field. The ease of magnetization is ultimately related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magneti c minerals (principally magnetite) in the formation. These measurements provide one of the best methods for investigating stratigraphic  changes  in  mineralogy  and  lithology  because  th e measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructive and becaus e different lithologies often have strongly contrasting susceptibilities.  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution measurements with ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ depth of horizontal investigation. The MSS wa s run as the lowermost tool in the triple combo tool string in Hol e U1514C, using a specially developed data translation cartridge t o enable the MSS to be run in combination with the Schlumberge r tools. However, the MSS tool was not included in the Quambo tool string at all sites—particularly where there were concerns abou t ledges or partial borehole collapse and therefore too much risk o f damaging the MSS tool (Figure F24). The MSS also has an optional single-coil sensor to provide high-resolution measurements ( $[{\sim}10\$ cm), but it was not used during Expedition 369 because it has a larg e bowspring that would require the MSS to be run higher up in th e tool string and because it is very sensitive to separation from th e borehole wall.  

Magnetic susceptibility data from both the high-resolution an d deep-reading sensors are plotted as uncalibrated units. The MS S reading responses are affected by temperature and borehole siz e (higher temperatures lead to higher susceptibility measurements). Preliminary processing was performed offshore to remove the temperature drift by calculating a least-squares polynomial fit to th e data and subtracting the calculated trend from the data set. Whe n the magnetic susceptibility signal in sediment is very low, the detection limits of the tool may be reached. For quality control and environmental  correction,  the  MSS  also  measures  internal  tool temperature, $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axis acceleration, and low-resolution borehole conductivity.  

# Acceleration and inclinometry  

Three-component acceleration and magnetic field measurements were made with the General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT) during logging (Figure F24). The primary purpose of thi s tool, which incorporates a three-component accelerometer and  a three-component magnetometer, is to determine the acceleratio n and orientation of the FMS-sonic string. This information allow s the FMS image to be corrected for irregular tool motion to determine the dip and direction (azimuth) of features in the images. Th e GPIT was also run on the triple combo tool string to provide data t o optimize the WHC before logging began and to acquire the bes t possible downhole data. The GPIT is run with other tools on bot h the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings. These other tools ma y carry remnant or induced magnetization; therefore, the GPIT magnetic measurements can be affected. However, on the FMS-soni c tool string the GPIT has greater nonmagnetic insulation from th e other tools, which greatly reduces the effects on its magnetic measurements.  

# Vertical seismic profile  

In a VSP experiment, a borehole VSI tool is anchored against th e borehole wall at regularly spaced intervals and records the ful l waveform of elastic waves generated by a seismic source positione d just below the sea surface (Figure F24). These check shot measurements relate depth in the hole to traveltime in reflection seismi c profiles. The VSI used here contains a three-axis geophone. Durin g the VSP survey conducted in Hole U1513E, the VSI was anchore d against the borehole wall at approximately $25\,\mathrm{~m~}$ station interval s (where possible), and 5–10 air gun shots were typically taken at eac h station. The recorded waveforms were stacked, and a one-wa y traveltime was determined from the median of the first breaks fo r each station. The acoustic source used was a two 250 cubic inch Ggun cluster fired at 2000 psi. This source was positioned on the por t side of the JOIDES Resolution in ${\sim}7{-}9\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth with a horizontal borehole offset of ${\sim}47~\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F25).  

Precautions were taken to protect marine mammals, sea turtles, and diving birds per the restrictions placed on seismic surveys i n Australian waters that are enforced by the Australian Government. If there were no such fauna in or approaching the safety radiu s ${\mathfrak{g}}40\;\mathrm{m}$ for water depths ${>}1000\:\mathrm{m};1850\:\mathrm{m}$ for water depths betwee n $100~\mathrm{m}$ and $1000\;\mathrm{m})$ ), air gun operations commenced using a rampup or “soft start” procedure (gradually increasing the operationa l pressure and decreasing the air gun firing interval) to provide tim e for undetected fauna to respond to the sounds and vacate the area. Once the air guns were at full power, the check shot survey proceeded. Observations for relevant wildlife continued during the survey. If marine mammals, sea turtles, or diving birds had entered th e designated safety radius, the survey would have been suspended.  

# Log data quality  

The main influence on log data quality is the condition of th e borehole wall. Where the borehole diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts of softer material or ledges of harder material, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehol e wall (i.e., FMS, density, and porosity) may be degraded. Deep investigation measurements such as gamma radiation, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and sonic velocity, which do not require contac t with the borehole wall, are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions. “Bridged” sections, where borehole diameter is significantl y below the bit size, also cause irregular log results. The quality of th e borehole is improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling flui d while drilling, flushing the borehole to remove debris, and loggin g as soon as possible after drilling and conditioning are completed. During this expedition, the necessity of flushing dense hard rock s up and out of the borehole required heavy-fluid circulation.  

The quality of the wireline depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determine d from the length of the cable payed out from the winch on the ship. The seafloor is identified on the NGR log by the abrupt reduction i n gamma ray count at the water/sediment interface (mudline). Discrepancies between the drilling depth and the wireline log dept h may occur. In the case of drilling depth, discrepancies are due t o core expansion, incomplete core recovery, or incomplete heav e compensation. In the case of log depth, discrepancies between successive runs occur because of incomplete heave compensation, incomplete correction for cable stretch, and cable slip. Tidal change s in sea level affect both drilling and logging depths. They were predicted to be ${\sim}0.8~\mathrm{m}$ in the Great Australian Bight while logging Sit e U1512 and between 0.2 and $_{0.4\mathrm{~m~}}$ while logging Sites U1512, U1513, and U1514 in the Mentelle Basin and Naturaliste Plateau, based on nearby coastal tidal gauges (Australian Government, Bureau of Meteorology).

# Wireline heave compensator  

During wireline logging operations, the up-and-down motion o f the ship (heave) causes a similar motion of the downhole loggin g tools. If the amplitude of this motion is large, depth discrepancies ca n be introduced into the logging data. The risk of damaging downhol e instruments is also increased. A WHC system was thus designed t o compensate for the vertical motion of the ship and maintain a stead y motion of the logging tools to ensure high-quality logging data acquisition (Liu et al., 2013; Iturrino et al., 2013). The WHC uses a vertica l accelerometer (motion reference unit [MRU]) positioned under th e rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertical motion of the ship with respect to the seafloor. It then adjusts the lengt h of the wireline by varying the distance between two sets of pulley s through which the cable passes to minimize downhole tool motion.  

Real-time measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleration are made simultaneously by the MRU and the EDTC, respectively. A LDEO-developed software package allows these data to b e analyzed and compared in real time, displaying the actual motion o f the logging tool string and enabling monitoring of the efficiency o f the compensator.  

# Logging data flow and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real tim e and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. Initia l logging data were referenced to the rig floor (wireline log depth below rig floor [WRF]). After logging was completed, the data wer e shifted to a seafloor reference (WSF) based on the step in gamm a radiation at the sediment/water interface.  

Data were transferred onshore to LDEO, where standardize d data processing took place. The main part of the processing is dept h matching to remove depth offsets between logs from different logging runs, which results in a new depth scale: WMSF. Also, corrections are made to certain tools and logs (e.g., FMS imagery i s corrected for tool acceleration, including “stick and slip”), documentation for the logs (with an assessment of log quality) is prepared,  and the  data  are converted  to  ASCII format  for th e conventional logs and GIF for the FMS images. The data were transferred back to the ship within a few days, and this processed data se t was made available to the science party (in ASCII and DLIS formats) through the shipboard IODP logging database and shipboar d servers. The Schlumberger Petrel/Techlog software packages wer e used to visualize and interpret the collected wireline logging data.  

# In situ temperature measurements  

During Expedition 369, in situ temperature measurements wer e made with the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) i n Holes U1513B, U1514A, and U1516A in the Mentelle Basin an d Naturaliste Plateau, where the APC system was deployed. Th e APCT-3 fits directly into the APC coring shoe and consists of a battery pack, a data logger, and a platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over a temperature range from $0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Th e nominal accuracy of the APCT-3 temperature measurements i s $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Before entering the borehole, the tool is first stopped at th e mudline for 5 min to thermally equilibrate with bottom water. However, the lowest temperature recorded during the run was occasionally used as an estimate of the bottom water temperature instead o f the average temperature at the mudline because (1) the lowest temperature was more repeatable and (2) bottom water is expected t o have the lowest temperature in the profile. When the APC system i s plunged into the formation, the temperature instantaneously rise s from frictional heating. This heat gradually dissipates into the surrounding sediment as the temperature at the APCT-3 equilibrate s toward the temperature of the sediment. After the APC penetrate d the sediment, it was held in place for $5~\mathrm{min}$ while the APCT-3 recorded the temperature of the cutting shoe every second.  

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment was estimated b y applying a mathematical heat-conduction model to the temperatur e decay record (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The synthetic therma l decay curve for the APCT-3 is a function of the geometry and thermal properties of the probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Hora i and Von Herzen, 1985). Equilibrium temperature was estimated b y applying a fitting procedure (Pribnow et al., 2000). However, wher e the APC did not achieve a full stroke or where ship heave pulled th e APC up from full penetration, the temperature equilibration curv e is disturbed and temperature determination is less accurate.  

# Geochemistry  

The shipboard geochemistry program for Expedition 369 included the following measurements:  

• Headspace gas content;   
• Interstitial water composition;   
• Bulk geochemical parameters, including total inorganic carbon (TIC), total carbon, total nitrogen, and organic matter source rock analyses; and   
• Bulk elemental composition of igneous rocks.  

These analyses were carried out to satisfy routine shipboard safet y and pollution prevention requirements, characterize the diageneti c regime by interstitial water analysis, and provide bulk sediment geochemistry data for shipboard interpretation, providing a basis fo r sampling for shore-based research.  

# Interstitial water chemistry  

# Sample collection  

Routine interstitial water samples were obtained by squeezin g whole-round sections cut from cores immediately after core retrieval. Standard whole-round samples were $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ long, but as water content decreased downhole at each site, the size of the wholeround samples was increased to $15~\mathrm{cm}$ to enable extraction of th e ${\sim}40~\mathrm{mL}$ of water needed for shipboard and shore-based analyses. Whole-round samples were cut and capped as quickly as possibl e after the core arrived on deck and were immediately moved to th e chemistry laboratory for squeezing. Whole-round samples wer e typically collected at a frequency of one sample per core or one pe r every other half-core to basement, to the end of the hole, or until interstitial water extraction was no longer possible. The exterior o f the whole-round sample was carefully cleaned with a spatula to remove potential contamination from drilling fluid. For XCB and RC B cores, the intruded drilling mud between biscuits was also remove d to  eliminate  contamination  from  drilling  fluid.  The  cleane d sediment was transferred into an $^{8}\mathrm{\cm}$ inner diameter titaniu m squeezer that was placed in a Carver hydraulic press (Manheim an d Sayles, 1974) and squeezed with slowly increasing pressure t o 30,000 lb $({\sim}21\ \mathrm{MPa})$ to prevent the release of interlayer water fro m clay minerals during squeezing. For samples that remained “dry” after several hours of squeezing, the small squeezing device $\mathrm{{}^{4}\,c m}$ inner diameter pressure to $106\ \mathrm{MPa})$ was used. In these cases, onl y small volumes of interstitial water (usually $<\!2.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ ) were retrieved. After discarding the initial drops to prevent contamination, th e squeezed interstitial water was collected in a 60, 24, or $12\,\mathrm{mL}$ deionized water–washed $(18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm})$ high-density polyethylene syringe s attached to the squeezing assembly and subsequently filtere d through a $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ polyethersulfone membrane filter into variou s sample containers.  

Sample allocation was determined based on the obtained por e fluid volume and analytical priorities. Aliquots for shipboard analysis by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscop y (ICP-AES) were acidified by adding ${\sim}10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of trace metal–grad e concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and placed in $4\,\mathrm{\mL}$ cryovials. Aliquots fo r shore-based ICP-AES and high-resolution inductively couple d plasma–mass spectrometer (H-ICP-MS) analysis were stored i n precleaned $12\,\mathrm{\mL}$ screw-top polyethylene vials and acidified b y adding $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of trace metal–grade concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . Aliquot s for titration and ion chromatography analyses were put in $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ high-density polyethylene vials. Aliquots for shore-based dissolve d inorganic carbon (DIC) and $\delta^{13}C$ -DIC were treated with $5~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of  a saturated $\mathrm{{HgCl}_{2}}$ solution and placed in $4\,\mathrm{\mL}$ septum screw-to p glass vials. Aliquots for shore-based isotopic analysis of oxygen an d hydrogen were sealed in $2~\mathrm{mL}$ glass ampoules. Aliquots for shorebased $\delta^{34}\mathrm{S}$ and sulfate $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ were placed in $12~\mathrm{mL}$ septum screw-li d glass vials with $0.7~\mathrm{mL}$ of $5\%$ zinc acetate solution. All samples wer e stored at $4^{\circ}C$ after collection. For samples with low interstitial wate r yield, priority was given to ICP-AES and ion chromatography analyses.  

Alkalinity, $\mathsf{p H},$ , and salinity were analyzed immediately after interstitial water was obtained. Other shipboard analyses were carrie d out in batches. Dissolved sodium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bromide, and sulfate were analyzed by ion chromatography. Ammonium was analyzed by spectrophotometry. Major and minor element concentrations were analyzed by ICP-AES.  

After interstitial water extraction was complete, a sample wa s taken from the sediment squeeze cake for onboard bulk paramete r analyses, and the remainder was divided up and kept for variou s shore-based analyses by the shipboard science party.  

# Shipboard analysis  

Interstitial water samples were analyzed on board following protocols in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IOD P user manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately afte r squeezing, following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinit y was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handhel d refractometer, $\mathsf{p H}$ was measured with a combined glass electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with an autotitrato r (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) using 0.1 M HCl at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ . Internationa l Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater was used for calibration and was analyzed at the beginning and end of a batch of samples for each site and after ever y 10 samples. Alkalinity titrations had precision better than $2\%$ base d on repeated analysis of IAPSO standard seawater. For sampl e volumes of ${\leq}14~\mathrm{mL}$ , alkalinity and ${\mathsf{p H}}$ were not measured becaus e each alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ analysis required $3\,\mathrm{mL}$ of interstitial water.  

Sulfate, chloride, bromide, calcium, magnesium, and sodium  

Sulfate, chloride, bromide, calcium, magnesium, potassium, an d sodium concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatograph y (Metrohm 850 Professional IC) using aliquots of $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ that wer e diluted 1:100 with deionized water $(18~\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm})$ . At the beginnin g and end of each run, different dilutions of IAPSO standard seawate r were analyzed for quality control and to determine accuracy an d precision. Analytical precision was generally better than $3\%$ fo r chloride, bromide, sulfate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium concentrations. See Preference for multiple data sets for  a discussion on potassium data preference.  

# Ammonium  

Ammonium, phosphate, and silicon concentrations were determined using an Agilent Technologies Cary Series 100 UV-Vi s spectrophotometer with a sipper sample introduction system, following the protocol in Gieskes et al. (1991). Even though data fo r phosphate and silicon were generated, they were not used; thus, concentrations for these elements reported in this volume were derived only from the ICP-AES (see Preference for multiple dat a sets). For ammonium concentration analysis, a $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ sample aliquot was diluted with $1\,\mathrm{mL}$ reagent water to which $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ pheno l ethanol, $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ sodium nitroprusside, and $1~\mathrm{mL}$ oxidizing solutio n (trisodium citrate and sodium hydroxide) were added in a $5~\mathrm{mL}$ capped glass vial (Gieskes et al., 1991). The solution was kept a t room temperature for ${\sim}6.5\,\mathrm{h}$ to develop color. Ammonium concentrations were determined at an absorbance of $640\,\mathrm{nm}$ . Precision an d accuracy of the ammonium analyses were within $2.5\%$ and $3\%$ , respectively.  

# Major and minor elements  

Dissolved major $\left(\mathbf{Na}^{+}$ , $\!\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ , and ${\mathrm{Mg}}^{2+}$ ) and minor (Li, Sr, B, Si, Mn, Fe, P, and Ba) element concentrations were determine d by an Agilent 5110 ICP-AES with a SPS4 autosampler. This instrument was installed at the start of IODP Expedition 371 in July 2017. The shipboard ICP-AES analyses of interstitial water samples followed an analytical protocol originally developed at the Institute fo r Chemistry and Biology of the Marine Environment (ICBM; Oldenburg University, Germany). Each acidified interstitial water sampl e was diluted 1:10 by adding $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ interstitial water and $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ spik e solution containing $100~\mathrm{ppm}$ each of beryllium (Be), indium (In), and scandium (Sc) internal standards and 200 ppm antimony (Sb) t o $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ in $18\,\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ deionized water. The multielemen t spike was used to cover both atomic and ionic interferences (B. Schnetger, ICBM Oldenburg University, pers. comm., 2017). Fo r calibration, serial dilutions of IAPSO standard seawater $10\%$ , $30\%$ , $50\%$ , $70\%$ , $90\%$ , and $110\%$ ) were prepared to cover interstitial wate r concentrations smaller than or equal to normal seawater. Additional calibration solutions for major and minor element concentration s exceeding seawater (Ca, B, Ba, Fe, Li, Mn, P, Si, and Sr) were prepared with $3.5\%\,\mathrm{NaCl}$ as a matrix. Calibration solutions were spike d in the same way as the interstitial water samples. Calibration solutions were made up from certified stock solutions for minor elements (B, Ba, Fe, Li, Mn, P, Si, and Sr).  

During each ICP-AES run, a complete set of all in-house an d IAPSO dilutions were analyzed at the beginning and end of eac h batch. Furthermore, $100\%$ concentration solutions of in-house an d IAPSO standards were run every 8–10 samples to monitor instrumental drift. Elemental concentrations reported for each sampl e were average values from three replicate integrations of each sampl e measured consecutively by continuous flow, as set by instrumental parameters; the standard error in the average was also calculated b y the instrument software.  

Following each ICP-AES run, measured concentrations were recalculated after setting background correction parameters and adjusting peak centers using the software that accompanies the ICPAES instrument. Replicate analyses of IAPSO standard seawater between every 10 interstitial water samples were used to estimate th e accuracy of the measurements for all elements, which typically wa s lower than $5\%$ . Precision was determined by the instrument fro m threefold runs of each sample.  

# Preference for multiple data sets  

Often, more than one data set was produced for the concentration of a dissolved species. For example, Ca, Mg, K, Na, Sr, Si, B, Ba, Fe, P, and Mn were measured using two or more wavelengths b y ICP-AES. In addition, Ca, Mg, K, and Na were measured by io n chromatography, and Si and $\mathbf{P}$ were measured by spectrophotometry. Concentrations of $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ and $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ were analyzed by ion chromatography. Data generated from two different wavelengths on th e ICP-AES instrument were usually similar. For $\mathrm{Na}$ , data from io n chromatography were consistently slightly higher than those fro m ICP-AES. In general, ICP-AES values were preferred unless instrument errors were evident, which was the case for Na analyses fro m Sites U1515 and U1516, for which the sample inlet system led t o larger variability of Na data. In this case, ion chromatography dat a were chosen. For Ca, Mg, K, Si, and P, however, the data obtained b y ICP-AES using one of the wavelengths were adopted because of better accuracy and precision than the data from ion chromatography. The adoption of each wavelength was based on the availability o f data and on previous ICP-AES tests in other labs (Morishige an d Kimura, 2008; Rüdel et al., 2007; van de Wiel, 2003). For $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ and $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ , data from ion chromatography were used.  

# Headspace gas geochemistry  

One sediment sample $(5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ from each core, collected immediately after retrieval on deck, was placed in a $20~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ glass vial an d then sealed with a septum and crimped metal cap. When consolidated or lithified samples were encountered, chips of material wer e placed in the vial and sealed. If an interstitial water sample was obtained, the headspace sample was taken from the top of the sectio n immediately next to the interstitial water sample whenever possible. The vial was labeled with the core, section, and interval from whic h the sample was taken and then placed in an oven at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . A $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ volume of gas extracted through the septum was then injected with a gas-tight glass syringe into a gas chromatograph.  

The gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 equipped with a flam e ionization detector) was set at $250^{\circ}C$ and used to accurately an d rapidly measure the concentrations of methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethylene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propylene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ . A $2.4\:\mathrm{m}\times2.0\:\mathrm{mm}$ stainless steel column packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep R is installed in the oven. The injector consists of a ¹⁄16 inch Valco unio n with a $7\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ screen connected to a Valco-to-Luer lock syringe adaptor. This injector connects to a 10-port Valco valve that wa s switched pneumatically by a digital valve interface. The injecto r temperature was set at $120^{\circ}C$ . Samples were introduced into the ga s chromatograph through a $0.25~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample loop connected to th e Valco valve. The valve can be switched automatically to back flus h the column. The oven temperature was programmed to start a t $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8.25~\mathrm{min}$ and then increase to $150^{\circ}C$ for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ at a rate o f $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ . Helium was used as the carrier gas. Initial helium flow i n the column was $30~\mathrm{mL/min}$ . Flow was then ramped to $60\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ after $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ to accelerate elution of $C_{3}$ and ${C}_{3=}$ . The run time wa s $15\,\mathrm{\min}$ . The gas chromatograph was also equipped with an electronic pressure control module to control the overall flow into th e instrument.  

# Sediment geochemistry  

# Sedimentary inorganic and organic carbon content  

Sediment samples were collected from the interstitial wate r squeeze cakes, and additional samples were taken from intervals o f distinct lithology. Samples were freeze-dried for ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{h},$ crushed using an agate pestle and mortar, and then analyzed for total carbon, TIC, and total nitrogen.  

Total carbon and total nitrogen of the sediment samples wer e determined with a ThermoElectron Corporation FlashEA 111 2 CHNS elemental analyzer equipped with a ThermoElectron packe d column CHNS/NCS gas chromatograph and a thermal conductivit y detector (TCD). Approximately $10{-}15\;\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighe d into a tin cup and then combusted at $950^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ under a stream of oxygen. The reaction gases were passed through a reduction chambe r to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and then were separated b y the gas chromatograph before detection by the TCD. All measurements were calibrated to a standard (Soil Reference Materia l [NIST2704]), which was run every 10 samples. The peak areas fro m the TCD were calculated to determine the total carbon and total nitrogen of the samples.  

TIC was determined using a Coulometrics $5015\ \mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Approximately $10~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighed into a glas s vial and acidified with $2\,\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{HCl}$ . The liberated $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ was titrated, an d the corresponding change in light transmittance in the coulometri c cell was monitored using a photodetection cell. The weight percen t of calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ was calculated from the inorgani c carbon content using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\left(w t\%\right)\times100/12.}
$$  

Standard $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ $_{\left.>99.9\%\rightmoon}$ ; Fisher Scientific) was used to confir m accuracy. Total organic carbon (TOC) content was calculated b y subtraction of inorganic carbon from the total carbon.  

# Elemental analysis of igneous samples  

Major (Si, Ti, Al, Fe, M, Mg, Ca, Na, K, and P) and selected minor (Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, La, Nb, Ni, Rb, Sc, Sr, V, Y, Zn, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ ) elemen t concentrations were determined by an Agilent 5110 ICP-AES with  a SPS4 autosampler. The shipboard ICP-AES analyses of sample s closely followed the methods described by Murray et al. (2000). Each igneous rock and reference material sample was treated according to the IODP Hard Rock Preparation for ICP User Guide, made into a sample bead by lithium metaborate fusion, and the n dissolved in $50~\mathrm{mL}$ $10\%\ \mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ (dilution factor $=500_{.}$ ). From thes e digestions, $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of sample was mixed with $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ deionized water and $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a spike solution containing $100\,\mathrm{ppm}$ Be, In, and S c and $200\,\mathrm{ppm}\,\mathrm{Sb}$ (final sample dilution $=1{:}2500$ ; final spike concentrations in solution were 10 and $20\;\mathrm{ppm}$ , respectively). The AGV-1, BCR-2, BHVO-2, BIR-1, JA-3, JGB-1, JP-1, and JR-2 reference materials were used for establishing calibration curves. Elemental concentrations for reference materials are given in Imai et al. (1995) an d Jochum et al. (2015). Agilent software was used for establishin g calibration curves for the elements mentioned above. Sample results are reported as weight percent for major element oxides an d parts per million $(\mathrm{mg/kg})$ for trace elements. Additional referenc e materials were not analyzed. The wavelengths used for ICP-AE S analyses are reported in Table T11.  

# Organic matter characterization with pyrolysis  

The type and quantity of organic matter in sediment with ${\ge}0.8$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ TOC or in samples taken from intervals of specific interes t were evaluated by pyrolysis assay using a source rock analyzer (SRA; Weatherford Laboratories). Between 60 and $180~\mathrm{mg}$ of freeze-dried, ground sediment was weighed into SRA crucibles. The sample wa s heated at $340^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $3\ \mathrm{min}$ , releasing volatile hydrocarbon (HC) a s the S1 peak $(\mathrm{mg~HC}/\mathrm{g}$ rock). The temperature was increased fro m $340^{\circ}$ to $640^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ , leading to hydrocarbon release from th e pyrolysis of kerogen (S2 peak; mg $\mathrm{HC/g}$ rock). The nominal temperature of the maximum rate of hydrocarbon yield during the S 2 analysis is $T_{\mathrm{max}}.$ . The S3 peak constitutes $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ (a $\mathrm{~s~mg~C/g~}$ rock) released during pyrolysis between $340^{\circ}$ and $390^{\circ}C$ . $C O_{2}$ (as mg $C/\mathbf{g}$ rock) produced by oxidizing the pyrolysis residue at $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ is the S 4 peak, but this is not directly reported. $\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}$ (to distinguish SRAbased TOC from calculated TOC derived from the elemental analyzer) was calculated from S1, S2, and S4, assuming that S1 and S 2 are $83\%$ carbon:  

$$
\mathrm{wt}\%\mathrm{\TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}=(0.83\times\left[\mathrm{S1}+\mathrm{S2}\right]+\mathrm{S4})/10.

The carbon-normalized hydrogen index (HI) $(\mathrm{mg~HC}/\mathrm{g}$ TOC ) and the oxygen index (OI) (mg $\mathrm{CO_{2}/g}$ TOC) were calculated fro m pyrolysis values:  

$\mathrm{HI}=(100\times\mathrm{S2})/\mathrm{TOC_{\mathrm{SRA}}},$  

$$
\mathrm{OI}=(100\times\mathrm{S3})/\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}.
$$  

Production index (PI) was calculated with the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{PI}=\mathrm{S}1/(\mathrm{S}1+\mathrm{S}2).
$$  

All measurements were preceded by a blank and then calibrate d to a rock standard from Weatherford Laboratories (533; PN:810- 141-B). The same standard was used for quality control every 1 0 samples.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Complete records of drilled sedimentary sections cannot be collected from a single IODP borehole because gaps and disturbance s occur between successive cores even when nominal recovery i s $100\%$ or greater (Ruddiman, Kidd, Thomas, et al., 1987; Hagelber g et al., 1995). To bridge gaps and avoid disturbed intervals, we correlated at as fine a scale as possible between all holes drilled at an y site and assembled a composite section (the “splice”) for overlapping intervals. The goal in constructing a splice is to determine an d report which intervals in which cores represent the most complet e and continuous sedimentary sequence recovered at each site.  

Sampling in a well-constrained stratigraphic framework will b e critical to meeting the scientific objectives of Expedition 369. Th e spliced section represents our attempt to provide this framework i n intervals of overlap. Intervals not included in the splice interval ca n also be referenced to the depth scale for the splice, although differential degrees of core expansion, compression, or local sedimentological differences among holes can introduce variation in th e reported depth of correlative features in adjacent holes (see below).  

Maximizing the likelihood of recovering a complete record o f the drilled interval and constructing a spliced section follows tw o similar but separate activities. The first activity is tracking th e downward coring progress of each subsequent hole after the firs t hole is completed at a given site. While the hole is being deepened, the stratigraphic correlator identifies and links features in newly recovered cores to features in previously drilled cores from the sam e site. The stratigraphic correlator advises the driller if and when adjustments should be made in coring to reduce or eliminate th e alignment of intercore gaps among holes based on the position o f core breaks in previously drilled cores relative to the predicted position of upcoming core breaks for ongoing drilling. To do this well while the drill bit is advancing obviously requires measurements t o be obtained as quickly as possible at the time cores reach the Cor e Laboratory and are curated. During Expedition 369, we found tha t magnetic susceptibility obtained on the STMSL, notes of feature s visible through the core liner on the catwalk, and comparisons o f reported drilling depth below seafloor to core depth below seafloo r generally gave the most useful information to guide drilling decisions.  

The second activity involved in stratigraphic correlation is refining correlation tie points between holes and identifying intervals i n each hole with the best recovery that can be joined to assemble  a continuous, spliced record. The goal is to construct a downhol e “map” that will guide samplers to the most continuous stratigraphi c section available for the cores recovered at that site as estimate d from shipboard data.  

The process begins by identifying a tie point in each core of eac h hole that places that feature in a stratigraphic position most i n agreement with cores in neighboring holes. This step is referred t o as “compositing.” To composite, the correlator scans multiple dat a types and tries to identify features in common among cores fro m multiple holes that are useful for correlation. The hole in which tha t feature occurs at a deeper drilling depth is generally used as th e fixed end of the tie point, and the core being composited is shifte d downward to match that level. This practice avoids forcing overlap s in offsets in higher cores. Total offsets do not always increase downhole. During Expedition 369, we found relatively large offset s needed to align one core often decreased in subsequent cores, an d offsets in any one core did not generally exceed the depth of the bottom of the interval drilled as reported by the drillers.  

When all cores at a site are composited, the stratigraphic correlator begins to construct a splice section. The splice starts wit h the core that contains the most reliable level of the seafloor (th e “mudline” core) or the highest core in the interval of overlap between holes if it is some distance below the seafloor. Splicing continues downhole through the collection of composited cores wit h the goal of constructing an unbroken splice of the most favorabl e intervals. The “splice section” is complete at the deepest level wher e overlapping cores exists in different holes at the same site. Th e splice is one of the major products generated by the stratigraphi c correlators.  

Many criteria are used in selecting which intervals, when joine d by tie points, provide the most complete stratigraphic succession. In addition, downhole log measurements can be incorporated t o establish the proper stratigraphic position of core data that may b e impossible to place accurately due to incomplete core recovery. During Expedition 369, we found correlation to downhole logs t o be extremely useful in verifying that a splice across the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary interval at Site U1513 was reasonable,  a real concern given large coring gaps present between multiple core s in both holes in the splice interval. NGR was the most useful metri c in core-log integration, and NGR, color reflectance, core observations, and core photographs were most important in core-to-cor e correlation. Discussion of decisions made and criteria used are provided in the stratigraphic correlation section in each site chapter.  

Constructing composite and splice intervals during Expeditio n 369 followed the basic strategy first developed during ODP Leg 13 8 (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995) and refined during subsequent legs. This same approach is now common practice during all high-resolution paleoceanographic expeditions. Differences between expeditions and users are conceptually small and concern the specifics o f the measurements used as the basis for correlation and the computer software used to match and manipulate data.  

Constructing  a  spliced  section  entails  a  progressio n through a series of different depth scales from reported drilling depth to a final composite depth (Figure F26). The namin g conventions used for the depth scales followed IODP convention (http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines) and ar e described below.  

# Core depth below seafloor (CSF) scale  

The process of building a composite section begins by assignin g a depth to the top of each core initially using the DSF scale. DSF is  a drill string measurement based on the length of drill string from th e seafloor to the cored top of each core. It is calculated by subtractin g the length of the drill string between the rig floor and the mudlin e (the estimated level of the seafloor) from the length of the dril l string from the rig floor to the top of the cored interval. Sources o f error in DSF are numerous and include pipe and BHA stretch an d compression, tidal variations, wind induced differences in th e height of the sea surface, currents and wind affecting the bend o f the drill string, and uncompensated heave. Tidal influence on DS F measurement can be significant (Hagelberg et al., 1995), and th e prediction of tides may be useful for guiding drilling to avoid initia l gap alignment (Mix, Tiedemann, Blum, et al., 2003), but during Expedition 369 we did not try to adjust for this factor due to the smal l tidal range in the regions cored.  

A second depth scale, CSF-A, is used to characterize the dept h to a given position within any core. CSF-A combines the DSF coretop depth with the curated length of the core after retrieval. CSF- A is equivalent to the meters below seafloor (mbsf) scale used durin g DSDP, ODP, and the early phase of the Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program, but naming conventions were changed to increase precision and avoid confusion for IODP. CSF-A depths are specific t o each hole, and CSF-A is the depth scale used for presenting mos t primary observations, including information summarized on th e VCDs and presented in the site chapters. However, it is important t o note that the “within-core” position of any given sedimentary feature may change during and after recovery as a result of drilling disturbance, the relief of overburden, gas-induced expansion, or wate r loss. Thus, error in the CSF-A scale includes both drilling effect s and core aging effects. The CSF-A scale also permits stratigraphically impossible overlaps between successive cores, a situation that is relatively common due to core expansion resulting i n ${>}100\%$ recovery.  

Figure F26. Interrelationships between cored material and the depth scale s used during Expedition 369. In this example, five hypothetical cores (1–5 ) are recovered from each of two holes (A and B). Hypothetical Core B1 i s intentionally shorter than Core A1 to model an approach that would reduc e the likelihood that intercore gaps would align between the two holes. Cor e B2 shows a core that unintentionally had less than full recovery, illustratin g potential vagaries of drilling that can result in aligned core breaks despit e informed drilling decisions. The CSF-A scale is established by adding th e curated core length (brown intervals) to the depth of each core top determined by the DSF. If recovery is $>\!100\%$ , plotting recovery on the CSF-A scal e will result in overlap between cores (red). The CCSF scale corrects for thi s and other inadequacies of the CSF-A (mbsf) scale. It is based on locating features common to cores in multiple holes at a given site and is constructe d working from the top of the site downward to select tie points (red dashe d lines) that correlate features in one hole to those in another. Due to cor e expansion and lack of complete recovery at the tops and bottoms of cores, Holes A and B on the CCSF scale are longer than they are on the CSF-A scale. The primary splice on the CCSF scale at the far right is constructed by combining selected intervals between tie points so that coring gaps and disturbed sections are excluded. This process ideally results in a complet e stratigraphic sequence. The procedure assumes identical sediment thickness between tie points joining two holes, but this assumption is not alway s met, as illustrated by the green dashed lines joining the green horizon i n Cores A3 and B3.  

![](images/aedbb6e3a149aea3d5e5b8efc7df8224a4bb7acd5e33db815b181f912f511259.jpg)  

To address this problem, a third depth scale, CSF, Method  B (CSF-B), was also calculated for all cores. When recovery is ${\le}100\%$ (i.e., when the length of core recovered does not exceed the lengt h drilled), the CSF-A and CSF-B scales have the same value. However, when recovery is ${>}100\%$ , linear interpolation can be used to compress the recovered interval into the length drilled, thereby eliminating apparent overlaps. Factors that lead to ${>}100\%$ recover y include elastic, thermal, and gas-induced core expansion, as well a s flow in, recovery of downhole contaminants, and gaps caused by rotation and misalignment of breaks during sectioning. CSF-B value s are available for all holes drilled during Expedition 369 but were no t used in any of the reports for the expedition.  

The CCSF scale, described below, is the scale generated whe n compositing. Like the CSF-B scale, the CCSF scale should eliminat e artifacts such as overlap between cores within a hole, and it is th e scale on which the splice section is plotted. Composite depths ma y exceed the total depth drilled for the interval covered by the splice.  

# Core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) scale  

The construction of a common composite depth scale for  a given IODP site involves identification of coeval, laterally continuous features in all drilled holes. Despite being correlative, the features will commonly occur at different depths on the CSF-A dept h scale for each hole. Once correlative features are identified, th e depth of individual cores is offset relative to the CSF-A depth in tha t hole such that the features are aligned on a common depth scale, CCSF. The CCSF scale is equivalent to the meters composite dept h (mcd) scale used during ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions.  

In constructing the CCSF scale, the depths of all material in eac h individual core are offset from the CSF-A scale by a constan t amount (i.e., without stretching or squeezing within individua l cores). The size of the offset is determined by aligning the tie point s used in compositing. Plotting cores relative to composite depth provides good estimates of the length of coring gaps and forms the basis for developing the spliced record. In cores where expansion ha s occurred, the size of the offsets generally increases downcore, bu t this pattern was not prevalent in Expedition 369 cores. Offsets fo r every core in every hole at each site are tabulated in an affine table. The affine table and the splice (see below) are the primary product s generated by the stratigraphic correlators.  

The CCSF scale is built during compositing by correlating features downhole starting from the mudline or at the highest cor e within an interval of overlap. The top of the highest core or th e mudline establishes the top of the composited stratigraphic section, anchoring the composite depth scale for all cores from all holes a t each site. Compositing proceeds sequentially downcore through th e establishment of specific tie points among the various holes. Ti e points are often refined and updated as additional data becom e available as core is processed. The CCSF scale rarely (if ever) result s in precise alignment of all coeval features between holes because o f the contrasting effects of coring-induced stretching and squeezin g among cores and stratigraphic differences between holes. This variation means care should be taken when comparing results fro m samples collected from within the splice to those for the same CCS F interval in intervals not included in the splice.  

In principle, drilling could proceed such that there are n o aligned coring gaps among the holes at a given site. If so, and if recovery was sufficiently high, it should then be possible to correlat e each successive core in one hole to a core from an adjacent hole al l the way to the bottom of a drilled section. The result in this cas e would be a complete, anchored splice. In practice, at most sites a t least some coring gaps align. Downhole logging data can be used t o estimate the length of the gap, maintaining an observational connection to the anchor core. When there is an aligned core gap acros s all holes at a site without downhole data suitable to fill the gap, though, cores below the gap are no longer tied to the anchor core. These cores can still be tied to one another, but the correlated sections are considered “floating” on the CCSF scale.  

Choosing a CCSF depth for floating sections is subjective. During Expedition 369, either of two methods were used to ti e floating sections into the splice as noted in the affine table. When  a core is “APPENDED,” the core being appended uses the inherite d absolute offset of the core above the coring gap. When a core i s “SET,” the stratigraphic correlator sets a user-defined offset that results in the best qualitative alignment. In cases where large aligne d core gaps exist within a splice, the CCSF scale for the uppermos t core below the gap is assigned the same value as the CSF-A offset o f that core. Alternative methods for defining a SET offset are available, but these were not used during Expedition 369.  

During the process of constructing the composite section,  a CCSF depth may become greater than the CSF-A depth for equivalent horizons. This expansion of the depth scale may be an artifac t of the selection of tie points or can be related to physical processes, including decompression and expansion of the sediment as it i s brought to atmospheric pressure, pore-space gases coming out o f solution, warming, stretching that occurs as part of the coring process, and recovery of additional material, likely from borehole-wall sediment that fell downhole and entered the core barrel (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2001). Expansion of depth scale s during Expedition 369 was limited, and offsets did not generally exceed the depth of the bottom of the drilled interval.  

# The splice  

Once the CCSF scale is developed and the between-core gap s identified, a complete stratigraphic section (splice) is constructed b y combining selected intervals between the previously established ti e points. In the case of core gaps aligned across all holes, any splice d sections below the gap are designated as floating splice sections an d plotted against CCSF as described above.  

# Measurements and methods for correlation  

Given that during Expedition 369 few long sections of overla p were cored at any site and the drilling technique often differed between holes, we adjusted our approach to correlation based on th e specifics of the situation. Observations of features in the recovere d core seen through the core liner, comparison of DSF/CSF-A measurements between holes, and magnetic susceptibility measurements acquired as soon after core retrieval as possible using th e STMSL were most useful for guiding drilling decisions in near real time. The success rate of these decisions in bridging coring gaps an d areas of disturbed sediment was high.  

The initial correlation between holes used for guiding drillin g was refined as additional information became available from subsequent  analyses,  including  biostratigraphic  and  magnetostratigraphic information, higher resolution physical property record s measured on the WRMSL, sedimentological observations, photos, and color data. In addition, comparison between core measurements and downhole logs was used to test and refine correlations. NGR arguably gave the most consistently useful means of correlation between holes beyond aligning drilling depths. In specific instances, however, other data were important (e.g., digitized colo r data [both RGB and $\mathrm{~L~}^{\ast},\mathrm{~a~}^{\ast}$ , $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ measurements], magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, lithologic observations, and paleomagneti c data). These data have different resolutions, and details on instrument calibrations, settings, and measurement intervals for Expedition 369 are given in Petrophysics and Paleomagnetism.  

Compositing and splicing were accomplished using Correlato r software (version 2.1). The software generated standard affine tables (listings of the vertical offset in meters added to each core t o generate the CCSF scale) and splice interval tables (listings of th e specific core intervals used to construct the splice). These table s were uploaded to the LIMS database, which then linked the appropriate depth scale to any associated data set.
