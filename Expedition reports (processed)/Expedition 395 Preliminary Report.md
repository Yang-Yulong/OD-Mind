# Abstract  

The intersection between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Iceland hotspot provides a natural laboratory where the composition and dynamics of Earth’s upper mantle can be observed. Plume-ridg e interaction drives variations in the melting regime, which result in a range of crustal types, including a series of V-shaped ridges (VSRs) and V-shaped troughs (VSTs) located south of Iceland. Mantle upwelling beneath Iceland dynamically supports regional bathymetry and may lead t o changes in the height of oceanic gateways, which in turn control the flow of deep water on geologic timescales. This expedition recovered basaltic samples from crust that is blanketed by thic k sediments, that also contain climatic and oceanic records from modern to earliest Oligcene/lat e Eocene times. Major, trace, and isotope geochemistry of basalts from this expedition provid e insight into spatial and temporal variations in mantle melting processes. These samples will enabl e testing of the hypothesis that the Iceland plume thermally pulses on two timescales (5–10 and ${\sim}30$ Ma), leading to fundamental changes in crustal architecture. This idea will be tested against alternative hypotheses involving propagating rifts and buoyant mantle upwelling. Millennial-scal e paleoclimate records are contained in the rapidly accumulated sediments of contourite drift s cored during Expedition 395. The accumulation rate of these sediments is a proxy for curren t strength, which is moderated by dynamic support of oceanic gateways such as the GreenlandScotland Ridge. These sediments also provide constraints for climatic events including Miocen e and Pliocene warmth, the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, and abrupt Lat e Pleistocene climate change. The integrated approach of Expedition 395 allows the relationship s between deep Earth processes, ocean circulation, and climate to be explored. These objective s were addressed by recovering sediment and basement cores from four sites, plus an additional tw o sites which were completed during Expeditions 384 and 395C (U1555 and U1563). Two site s (U1554 and U1562) are located in Björn drift above a VSR/VST pair, and another site targeted th e Holocene–Eocene sequence of sediments at Eirik drift, located on the eastern Greenland margi n (U1602). The fourth site of Expedition 395 (U1564) is located on 32.4 My-old oceanic crust that i s devoid of V-shaped features, and was chosen because it intersects the Holocene to Oligo–Miocen e sedimentary sequence of Gardar drift. Considered together, the sediments, basalts and vast arra y of measurements collected during Expedition 395 will provide a major advance in our understanding of mantle dynamics and the linked nature of Earth’s interior, oceans, and climate.  

# Plain language summary  

In the North Atlantic Ocean, hot rocks are thought to rise up beneath Iceland from deep withi n Earth’s interior, called the mantle, forming a giant mantle plume. This plume likely plays a key rol e in shaping the ocean crust around Iceland, including a pattern of distinctive crustal V-shape d ridges (highs) and V-shaped troughs (lows) that extend hundreds of kilometers on the seabe d south of Iceland. Some think that these V-shaped ridges are generated by increases and decrease s in plume activity, but their precise origin is hotly debated. Plume activity variations may also hav e contributed to changes in the height of oceanic gateways—passages that link Greenland, Iceland, and Scotland, thus controlling the amount of cold, deep water that has been flowing from th e Norwegian Sea to the Atlantic Ocean over the past few million years. These deepwater current s deposit sediments on the seabed very quickly, recording the ambient ocean and climatic conditions along the way. As a result, the sediments contain a high-resolution record of the past, whic h we can measure in deep-sea cores. Expedition 395 cored through these sediments at four sites; a t one of which, coring continued for $170\;\mathrm{m}$ into the ocean crust. Core, fluid, and microbial samples, along with measurements of the physical properties of both the core and the interior of the boreholes, will enable scientists to decipher processes taking place in the mantle, ocean, and climat e over the past 32 million years.  

# 1. Introduction  

Scientific ocean drilling has transformed our understanding of Earth over the past five decades, from insights into past climates to the confirmation of plate tectonic theory. However, the convecting behavior of Earth’s mantle and its effects on surface processes such as ocean circulatio n and climate remains poorly understood. Basaltic rocks erupted at mid-ocean ridges (MORs) provide a window into mantle processes. When MORs are located near large upwellings called mantl e plumes, interactions between these two systems produce variations in mantle composition an d dynamics that are recorded at the ridges. Although mantle plumes (e.g., beneath Hawaii) are fairl y common, intersecting plume-ridge systems are unusual. One such intersecting system is locate d in the North Atlantic Ocean, where the Iceland mantle plume is strongly influenced by the MidAtlantic Ridge, which includes the Reykjanes Ridge southwest of Iceland. Basaltic rocks erupted a t the spreading axis record the geochemical signature of the underlying mantle and the melting an d extrusion processes, providing a record of the composition and dynamics of the mantle plume an d its interaction with the spreading system. The Reykjanes Ridge flanks host a series of V-shape d crustal ridges and troughs, whose origin has been long debated. One of the hypotheses to explai n the formation of these ridges is that the Iceland mantle plume has been pulsing at a frequency o f several millions of years, causing melt anomalies and driving transient uplift of the surroundin g North Atlantic region on geological timescales. Other hypotheses to explain these ridges do no t require pulsing of the Iceland plume.  

Basins around the Reykjanes Ridge are blanketed by rapidly accumulating sediments that recor d the oceanographic conditions on thousand-year timescales, providing some of the most detaile d climate records on Earth (Figure F1). Southward-flowing deepwater currents in the North Atlantic Ocean deposit fine-grained sediments called contourite drifts, which accumulate at rates o f hundreds of meters per million years. The Reykjanes Ridge flanks are the site of major contourit e drift deposits. Two of these, the Björn and Gardar drifts, are located on the eastern flank of th e ridge. In contrast, Eirik drift consists of an elongate, mounded contourite deposit that is plastere d along the East Greenland margin. Vertical motions caused by variations in the Iceland mantl e plume temperature could have altered the depth of the oceanic gateways connecting the Norwegian and Greenland Seas into the North Atlantic Ocean, with implications for deepwater circulation, sediment deposition, and climate. In addition, over time, basaltic crust spreads away from th e ridge, and interact with the overlying seawater and sediments, becoming progressively altere d because of hydrothermal circulation and chemical exchange. The unique juxtaposition of a mantl e plume, a spreading ridge, oceanic gateways, and rapidly accumulating sediment provide an idea l natural laboratory to test multidisciplinary ideas about the interactions between Earth’s deep an d surficial domains. Although the rich scientific potential in this region was demonstrated durin g Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 49 and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 162 (Luyendy k et al., 1979; Jansen and Raymo, 1996), comprehensive sampling of both the sediment and underlying basaltic crust is still lacking. A transect of holes has been drilled during Expeditions 384, 395 C and 395 to address three major objectives: (1) to test the control of the time-dependent behavior o f the Iceland mantle plume on crustal accretion at the Reykjanes Ridge; (2) to obtain high-resolutio n records of climate and ocean circulation near major North Atlantic oceanic gateways; and (3) t o track the accretion, aging, and hydrothermal exchange of oceanic crust over 32 My.

# 2. Background  

# 2.1. Geologic setting  

As new basaltic oceanic crust is formed, it draws material from the underlying mantle, so rock s recovered from MORs have long been used to measure the thermal and compositional propertie s of the mantle (e.g., Krause and Schilling, 1969; Hart et al., 1973; Schilling, 1973). Where MORs li e above mantle plumes, such as along Reykjanes and Kolbeinsey Ridges near Iceland, oceanic crusta l accretion is thought to be influenced by plume activity (e.g., White, 1997). Close agreemen t between models of dynamic topography and seismic tomography supports the idea that mantl e upwelling beneath Iceland influences the entire North Atlantic region today (Hartley et al., 2011; Rickers et al., 2013; Schoonman et al., 2017). A possible sign of time-dependent plume behavior i s the set of diachronous V-shaped ridges (VSRs) and V-shaped troughs (VSTs) that straddle th e Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland (Figure F2). Vogt (1971) first suggested that the VSRs reflec t variations in crustal thickness caused by pulses of hotter asthenosphere advecting horizontall y away from the Iceland plume that episodically increase the thickness of crust formed at the axis.  

Oceanic crustal accretion is sensitive to small mantle potential temperature perturbations, whic h can change the thickness of newly formed material by hundreds of meters to kilometers (White e t al., 1995). The ratios between incompatible trace elements, such as Nb/Y, are largely insensitive t o crustal processes such as fractional crystallization, and reflect the depth and degree of melting.  A southward decrease of $\mathrm{Nb/Y}$ on the Reykjanes Ridge correlates with deepening of the axis, with  a decrease in crustal thickness but also with decreasing source enrichment estimated by isotopi c indicators such as $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\mathrm{Sr}$ (Murton et al., 2002; Shorttle and Maclennan, 2011). Variations i n incompatible trace element ratios can be observed along axis, which correlate with patterns i n gravity anomaly, bathymetry and earthquake seismicity (Parnell-Turner et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2014). Compositional variations associated with VSRs cannot be explained by fractional crystallization alone because a corresponding variation in Mg number is absent. Because enrichment i n incompatible trace elements is inversely correlated with crustal thickness, mantle temperatur e variation is thought to play an important role in controlling crustal thickness, in addition t o changes in mantle source fusibility (Poore et al., 2011; Parnell-Turner et al., 2017).

Since Vogt’s early thermal pulsing hypothesis, the origin of the VSRs has been debated (Figure F3) (e.g., Parnell-Turner et al., 2014). One alternative idea is that the VSRs may be tectonic in origi n and have no requirement for melt anomalies originating from temperature variations in the mantle plume itself (Briais and Rabinowicz, 2002; Rabinowicz and Briais, 2002; Benediktsdóttir et al., 2012). In this hypothesis, a sequence of propagating rifts and southward migrating discontinuities, suggested by the observed asymmetric accretion at the ridge axis, explains the formation of VSR s and VSTs, which are thought to represent ridge segments and pseudofault scarps, respectivel y (Figure F3). A third hypothesis, in which shallow buoyant mantle upwelling instabilities propagat e along axis to form the observed crustal structure variations, has also been suggested; it avoids th e requirement for rapid mantle plume flow (Figure F3) (Martinez and Hey, 2017; Martinez et al., 2019).  

Crust on the Reykjanes Ridge was last drilled in 1978, during DSDP Leg 49 when basalts wer e recovered at three sites (Sites 407, 408 and 409), all located on VSRs. A total basalt thickness of 45 3 m was penetrated (Luyendyk et al., 1979), leading to a series of breakthroughs in our understanding of the nature and scale of mantle heterogeneity and crustal accretion under the influence of  a mantle plume (e.g., Wood et al., 1979; Dupré and Allègre, 1980; Fitton et al., 1997). The deepes t basement penetration was at Site 409 located $23\,\mathrm{km}$ from the ridge axis, where $240\;\mathrm{m}$ of vesicula r basalt was drilled in the 2.4 My old crust; however, the other Leg 49 sites are on older crust (36 an d $20\,\mathrm{Ma},$ ) and did not attempt to recover basalts from a VST. Hence, Leg 49 basalts alone are not abl e to unravel the origins of VSRs and VSTs, and do not provide detailed step-wise information abou t the aging of oceanic crust.  

The North Atlantic Ocean is separated from the colder, more dense waters of the Arctic Ocea n and Norwegian-Greenland Sea by the Greenland-Scotland Ridge (GSR), which represents a critical gateway affecting Cenozoic deepwater circulation patterns and climate. The GSR is generall y less than 500 meters below sea level (mbsl) and is only $\mathord{\sim}1000$ mbsl at its deepest point, making th e overflow flux sensitive to small variations in the ridge depth. Reconstructions of Neogene mantl e plume activity correlate with deepwater circulation patterns in the North Atlantic (Wright an d

Miller, 1996). Inferred times of high mantle plume activity are linked to low Northern Componen t Water productivity, increased current strength, and sedimentary deposition rates (Wright an d Miller, 1996; Poore et al., 2006; Parnell-Turner et al., 2015). Southward-flowing deepwater currents in the North Atlantic Ocean deposit fine-grained sediments called contourite drifts, whic h accumulate at rates of hundreds of meters per million years. Two contourite drifts, Gardar an d Björn, were successfully drilled during Leg 162 (Jansen and Raymo, 1996), providing a record o f drift sedimentation back to early Pleistocene and late Pliocene times $^{\cdot\sim2}$ and $3\;\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ). High sedimentation rate combined with near $100\%$ core recovery rates means that these sites contain som e of the highest resolution records of ocean circulation and climate to date (Kleiven et al., 2011; Thornalley et al., 2013). These records can be directly compared to atmospheric records from ic e cores and provide a unique, high-resolution insight into the Earth’s climatic past (Barker et al., 2019).  

# 2.2. Site survey data  

A detailed geophysical survey of Reykjanes Ridge and its flanks was conducted in June–July 201 0 during RRS James Cook Cruise JC50, collecting more than ${\sim}2400~\mathrm{km}$ of 2D multichannel reflection seismic data (Parnell-Turner et al., 2015, 2017). The survey consisted of two basin-spannin g regional seismic reflection profiles, oriented parallel to plate-spreading flowlines, and a series o f 19 shorter perpendicular crossing lines. These multichannel data are of sufficient quality to identify the sediment/basement interface, as well as potential drilling hazards such as faults, gas accumulations, and stratigraphic discontinuities. Primary and alternate sites were positioned on thic k sediment or in localized sedimentary basins that were imaged on seismic reflection profiles so tha t holes could easily be established. Sites were chosen as close to crossing seismic profiles as possibl e while avoiding sedimentary disturbances, faults, and basement discontinuities. Sediment thicknesses are estimated using interval sediment velocities from ODP Leg 162 where possible, an d stacking velocities are used for deeper levels.  

# 3. Scientific objectives  

# 3.1. Objective 1: crustal accretion and mantle plume behavior  

Expedition 395 aimed to use the composition of basaltic samples to understand crustal formatio n south of Iceland at two temporal scales. First, on ${\sim}5{-}10$ My timescales, we sought to test thre e alternative hypotheses for the formation of VSRs: (1) thermal pulsing, (2) propagating rifts, an d (3) buoyant mantle upwelling. Drilling allowed us to test these hypotheses, which predict differin g depths, temperatures, and degrees of melting between VSRs and VSTs recorded in basalt composition. Dredged samples are restricted to the ridge axis because deep-sea corals and sediment s cover off-axis areas (Murton et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2014). Hence, off-axis VSRs and VSTs ca n only be sampled by drilling. Second, we aimed to test the controls on crustal architecture ove r longer, ${\sim}30{-}40$ My timescales. Oceanic crust south of Iceland can be divided into two distinc t structural types—smooth and segmented—using gravity, magnetic and bathymetric data sets (e.g., White, 1997). Smooth oceanic crust contains VSRs and VSTs but also exhibits seafloor magneti c anomalies that are largely unbroken by fracture zone offsets, similar to those more typical at fastspreading ridges. Segmented oceanic crust exhibits traces of ridge axis discontinuities that ar e more typical of slow-spreading ridges; hence, the seafloor here represents a microcosm of globa l variability in crustal structure. The location of the boundary between smooth and segmente d crustal styles has shifted through time (Jones et al., 2002). This transition has been proposed t o reflect changes in melt supply to the ridge and may record expansion and contraction of the Iceland plume over ${\sim}35$ My. Segmented oceanic crust usually forms above cooler asthenosphere or a t slow-spreading ridges, whereas smooth crust usually forms above relatively hot asthenospher e close to plume heads or at intermediate- to fast-spreading ridges. Therefore, in the North Atlanti c Ocean, small changes in melt flux, temperature, and/or spreading behavior may drive regim e changes in crustal architecture. Our objective of understanding how crustal formation responds t o mantle temperature, degree of melting, and plume activity can be achieved by comparing the geochemistry of basalts from smooth and segmented crustal domains.  

# 3.1.1. Basalt geochemistry  

The accretion of oceanic crust is sensitive to small mantle potential temperature perturbations, which can change the thickness of newly formed material by hundreds of meters to kilometer s (White et al., 1995). Basalt trace element ratios, such as Nb/Y, can be largely insensitive to crusta l processes such as fractional crystallization and reflects the depth and degree of melting. A southward decrease of Nb/Y between $63^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ and $61\mathrm{{}^{\circ}N}$ on Reykjanes Ridge correlates with deepening o f the axis, a decrease in crustal thickness, and decreasing source enrichment estimated by isotopi c indicators such as $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\mathrm{Sr}$ and $\mathrm{^{143}N d/^{144}N d}$ (Murton et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2014).  

Leg 49 yielded major advances in understanding of mantle heterogeneity (e.g., Wood et al., 1979), plume structure (e.g., Fitton et al., 1997), and melting processes (e.g., Kempton et al., 2000). However, the location of these sites precludes their use to address the temporal and spatial variability o f plume dynamics. Expedition 395 sites, located along a spreading-parallel flowline, avoid the issu e of variable distance from the plume. Incompatible trace element concentrations and ratios (e.g., $\mathrm{Nb/Y}$ and $\mathrm{La}/\mathrm{Sm})$ will be used to constrain melting models, building upon previous work on th e axis. Major and trace element concentrations will be used to constrain differences in the composition, depth, and extent of melting between VSR/VST pairs and segmented crust unaffected b y VSRs. Indirect reconstruction of axial depth is possible using volatile elements such as carbon, water, and sulfur, which de-gas when erupted at the seafloor. For example, advances in understanding the $C O_{2}$ concentration in ridge basalts enable quantification of eruption pressure (L e Voyer et al., 2017). Recovery of basaltic glass during Expedition 395 will enable electron and ionprobe analyses to measure volatile elements and therefore estimate eruption pressures and test th e plume pulsing hypothesis.  

Objective 1 of the Expedition 395 project addresses 2050 Science Framework Strategic Objectiv e 2: Ocean Life Cycle of Tectonic Plates, which concerns the formation, aging and eventual destruction of oceanic plates. The coincidence of Reykjanes Ridge with the Iceland plume provides a n opportunity to observe the composition and behavior of Earth’s interior, as recorded by oceani c crust. Major, rare earth, and trace element concentrations of basalts recovered from Expeditio n 395 sites will be used to constrain mantle melting models to investigate how crust forms on slowspreading ridges.  

Crustal architecture south of Iceland is dominated by two main features: the diachronous VSR s that straddle Reykjanes Ridge and the transition from smooth to segmented oceanic crust tha t took place at ${\sim}35\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . These features may have been formed because of the interaction betwee n time-dependent mantle convection and plate spreading or a series of propagating rifts or patche s of buoyant mantle upwelling. By using similar basalt geochemistry and isotopic systematics, w e will investigate changes in mantle temperature and composition that coincide with the changes i n spreading style (Figure F4). In addition, the transect of sites are situated on crust of progressivel y increasing age and varying sedimentary cover. Basalts from Expedition 395 sites exhibit varyin g degrees of alteration along the transect, recording the progressive aging of the oceanic crust as i t interacts with seawater, sediment, and possibly microbial life over millions of years, as explaine d below as part of Objective 3.  

# 3.2. Objective 2: oceanic circulation, gateways, and sedimentation  

Cores and data from Expedition 395 sites allow us to quantify how oceanic circulation in th e North Atlantic Ocean has varied since Oligocene times. Deep water flow in the North Atlantic i s dominated by two oceanic gateways, the Iceland-Faroe Ridge and the Denmark Strait, that contro l the southward flow of water from the Norwegian Sea and exert a major influence on global ocea n circulation (Figure F5).  

The rate of accumulation of contourite drift sediments in the North Atlantic Ocean is primaril y controlled by deepwater flow along bathymetric rises; hence, the strength and pathways of deepwater currents are recorded by these drift sediments (e.g., Wright and Miller, 1996). These deposits provide an indirect proxy for temporal variations in deep water flow. Additionally, short-ter m climatic effects relating to the location of oceanic fronts during both glacial–interglacial an d (shorter) stadial–interstadial cycles may play a role in circulation patterns on shorter timescale s (thousands of years). It has been suggested that uplift and subsidence of the Iceland-Faroe Ridg e and Denmark Strait are influenced by mantle upwelling beneath Iceland and that there ma y therefore be an indirect connection between ocean circulation and mantle plume behavior (e.g., Parnell-Turner et al., 2015; Poore et al., 2011). Age-depth relationships at the six Expedition 39 5 sites will allow us to test the proposed correlation between mantle plume activity and ocean circulation by using sediment accumulation rates as a first-order proxy for deep water current strength. The oldest previously drilled sediments in the Iceland Basin are $\sim\!3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Jansen and Raymo, 1996), and Expedition 395 extends that record back to ${\sim}32\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , allowing us to investigate the relationships between mantle convection, oceanic gateway configuration, and climate.  

High sedimentation rates of contourite drift deposits in the North Atlantic Ocean $(12{-}16\;\mathrm{cm/ky})$ have led to paleomagnetic and isotopic records that are among the most detailed available (Channell et al., 2002). Existing boreholes provide high-resolution climate records back to $1.7\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Sit e 983), and this program extends the high-resolution climate record further into late Pliocene times. Coring the full depth of Gardar drift at Site U1564, Björn drift at Sites U1554 and U1562, and int o pre-drift Oligocene–Miocene sediments provides long-term constraints on sedimentation rate s and the potential for climate reconstructions across long timescales. Work on Leg 162 site s demonstrates the utility of sediments for millennial-scale reconstructions of surface and deepwater properties (Barker et al., 2015, 2019; Raymo et al., 1998). Planktonic foraminifer counts giv e a first-order constraint on sea-surface temperatures and the latitudinal migration of the pola r front, which fluctuates in line with millennial-scale temperature recorded by Greenland ice core s over the past ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{ky}$ (Bond et al., 1993). Similar relationships can be derived for intervals beyon d the reach of Greenland ice cores, documented by the similarity between climate and %Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (e.g., ODP Site 983). Ice-rafted debris (IRD) is a useful tracer for rafted ice, which can be associated with cold/freshening surface conditions that are proposed to affect ocea n circulation through changes in surface buoyancy (Menviel et al., 2014). Intensive ice rafting ha s occurred in the North Atlantic since northern hemisphere glaciation onset at around $2.7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Bailey et al., 2013), and its occurrence at Site 983 has been used to document millennial-scal e variability over the past 1.2 My. Sediments on the Björn and Gardar drifts experienced changes i n accumulation rate due to variations in deepwater overflow of proto-North Atlantic Deep Water. Variations in the vigor of these overflows are detected using the sortable silt proxy (McCave et al., 2017); this approach has been used at Sites 983 and 984 to track overflow changes on submillennial timescales (Kleiven et al., 2011; Thornalley et al., 2013). These proxies, in combination wit h foraminifer oxygen isotopes (for temperature/salinity) and carbon (deep ocean mixing) give th e potential to reconstruct submillennial variations in ocean properties throughout the interval o f drift deposition.

Expedition 395 addresses 2050 Scientific Framework Strategic Objective 3: Earth's Climate Syste m and Strategic Objective 4: Feedbacks in the Earth System. Subsidence and uplift of the Denmar k Strait and Iceland-Faroe Ridge may have controlled the deepwater exchange between the Arcti c Ocean, Nordic Seas, and Atlantic Ocean. Under this hypothesis, the tectonic evolution of thes e oceanic gateways and sills modifies large-scale ocean circulation, which is a component of multiple climate feedback loops. Thus, the histories of these gateways and their associated deepwate r flow are central to our understanding of Northern Hemisphere climate and its interaction wit h global thermohaline circulation. Sediments at Expedition 395 drilling sites were accumulated a t high rates and therefore provide a millennial-scale paleoclimate record since drift initiation. Thi s extended record spans the critical middle Pliocene intervals when global mean surface temperatures were $2^{\circ}{-}3^{\circ}C$ warmer than today. We will be able to test the sensitivity of ocean circulation t o changes in gateway conditions, which will inform boundary conditions for climate models targeting key future analogue warm climate states, such as the mid-Pliocene. Finally, the record o f crustal alteration across the five crustal sites will enable us to examine the styles and process o f crustal weathering that likely plays a role in modulating $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sequestration on long timescales.  

# 3.3. Objective 3: time-dependent hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust  

Sites cored during Expedition 395 address the nature, extent, timing and duration of hydrotherma l alteration of oceanic crust formed at the Reykjanes Ridge. Hydrothermal circulation along MOR s and across their flanks is responsible for one-third of the heat loss through the ocean crust (Sclate r et al., 1980; Bodine et al., 1981). It influences tectonic, magmatic, and microbial processes on  a global scale and is a fundamental component of global biogeochemical cycles (Coggon and Teagle, 2011). There is also growing evidence that the long-term carbon cycle is influenced by the reactio n of seawater with the oceanic crust in low-temperature, off-axis hydrothermal systems, perhap s representing an important mechanism for carbon drawdown (e.g., Gillis and Coogan, 2011). Th e relative contribution of this process remains controversial because we do not know how muc h low-temperature alteration takes place off axis. Although the nature of individual hydrotherma l fluid-rock reactions is generally understood, the magnitude and distribution of chemical exchang e remain poorly quantified, as does the partitioning between high- and low-temperature exchang e with crustal age. Consequently, the role of the production, hydrothermal alteration, and subsequent subduction of ocean crust in key global geochemical cycles remains uncertain. Drille d sections of hydrothermally altered crust from the Reykjanes Ridge flank provide time-integrate d records of geochemical exchange between crust and seawater along an age transect from 2.8 t o $32.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F6). The recovered cores, fluid samples, and wireline logging data will enable us t o quantify the timing and extent of hydrothermal fluid–rock exchange across the Reykjanes Ridg e flank and to assess the hydrothermal contributions of a rapidly sedimented slow-spreading ridg e flank to global geochemical budgets.

The ocean-basin–wide transect drilled during Expedition 395 spans crust from 2.8 to $32\ \mathrm{My}$ i n age, which has experienced a spectrum of different sedimentation, geochemical, and hydrogeologic processes. Expedition 395 project Sites U1555, U1563, U1554, U1562 and U1564 comprise  a west-to-east crustal flow line transect across the eastern flank of Reykjanes Ridge. The recovere d cores sample the uppermost $\mathord{\sim}130\mathrm{-}200\;\mathrm{m}$ of lavas produced 2.8, 5.2, 12.4, 14.2, and 32.4 My ago a t the Reykjanes Ridge, which provide a unique opportunity to quantify the timing and extent o f hydrothermal fluid–rock exchange in a slow-spreading ridge flank that experienced rapid sedimentation and variations in tectonic architecture. These sites address 2050 Science Framewor k Strategic Objective 2: Oceanic Life Cycle of Tectonic Plates.  

Expedition 395 project sites provide an exceptionally large variety of subseafloor environments i n which to study microbial communities, aiding in the understanding of the habitability of life o n Earth, 2050 Science Framework Strategic Objective 1. The comprehensive set of samples collecte d for microbiological analyses in cores from shallow to deep sedimentary sequences, sediment/ basement interface, and from deep within the basement will provide insights into the factors controlling the development of life. These analyses will benefit from the comprehensive record of th e corresponding geochemical environment provided by the interstitial fluid, sediment, basemen t rocks and their alteration products collected at all sites.

# 4.1. Site U1554  

# 4.1.1. Background and objectives  

Expedition 395 Site U1554 (proposed Site REYK-6A) is located in the North Atlantic Ocean alon g the Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland and on Björn drift (Figure F1). Site U1554 is located on Seismic Line JC50-1 (common midpoint [CMP] 41740), near the intersection with line JC50-C3 (CM P 1005), both obtained in 2010 during RRS James Cook Cruise JC50. Site U1554 is located in VST 2 b with an estimated basement age of $12.7\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Another target for Site U1554 is to obtain a continuous sedimentary record of the Björn drift, which is expected to offer millennial-scale climat e records. The sedimentation rate of this drift can serve as a proxy for deep water current strengt h and provide information for testing proposed on vertical oceanic gateway motions and thei r potential ties to pulsing behavior of the Iceland mantle plume.  

Cores and data from this site will address all three of the primary science objectives of Expeditio n 395: (1) crustal accretion and mantle behavior; (2) ocean circulation, gateways, and sedimentation; and (3) time-dependent hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust.  

# 4.1.2. Operations  

Site U1554 (proposed Site REYK-6A) $(60^{\circ}07.5060^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $26^{\circ}42.0960^{\prime}\mathrm{W}]$ ) consists of 8 holes drilled during Expeditions 384, 395C, and 395 (Table T1). Holes U1554A–U1554D were cored during Expedition 384 in July 2020. These holes range $23.5–76.0\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF). The recovered cores were used to create a stratigraphic splice of the section. Holes U1554E and U1554F were cored and logged during Expedition 395C in 2021. These holes extended to 647.7 and $779.9\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, respectively. Finally, Holes U1554G and U1554H were each cored to ${\sim}355\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF during Expedition 395.  

The sediments and basalts recovered on Expeditions 384 and 395C were sampled for select shipboard measurements during the cruises. Cores from these two expeditions were described postcruise at a core description party held at the Gulf Coast Repository in College Station, Texas, USA in May 2022.  

A total of 194 cores were recovered for Site U1554. Over a $1683.9\mathrm{~m~}$ cored interval, these cores collected $1611.82\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and basalt $(96\%)$ .  

The total time spent on Holes U1554A–U1554H was 22.48 days: 2.09 days during Expedition 384, 16.89 days during Expedition 395C, and 3.50 days during Expedition 395.  

Below we summarize operations and scientific results from all three expeditions.

The casing and drill string were run to 1552 mbsl and the subsea camera syste m was deployed to observe the casing operations. Hole U1554F was spudded at $1345\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and the casing was drilled into the hole to $602~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The drill string was pulled from the hole with the bi t clearing the seafloor at $1610\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 July 2021.  

The drill string was assembled with a rotary core barrel (RCB) BHA and Hole U1554F was reentered at $1057\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 July. The drill string advanced to the base of the casing. Hole U1554F was the n drilled without recovery to $620\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Two drilled intervals were recorded for the hole. Cores $3\mathrm{R}-$ 5R advanced from 620 to $649.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and $19.86\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered $(68\%)$ . Core 5R contained the sediment/basement interface at ${\sim}647\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Cores 6R–20R advanced from 649.1 t o $721.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and $45.91\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt was recovered $(63\%)$ .  

Following recovery of Core 395C-U1554F-20R, the drill string was pulled from the hole to chang e the drill bit. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1840~\mathrm{h}$ and rotary table at $2210\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 5 July 2021. Th e drill string reentered Hole U1554F at $0405~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 July. RCB coring resumed from 721.7–779.9  m DSF with the recovery of Cores 21R–32R.  

In total, 30 cores over an interval of $159.9\;\mathrm{m}$ were recovered from Hole U1554F. The core recover y for this hole was $100.15\mathrm{~m~}$ $(63\%)$ . The basement cores were advanced at an average rate of 1.7 6 $\mathrm{m/h}$ .  

Following coring operations, the hole was conditioned for downhole wireline logging. The dril l pipe was pulled out of the hole and the subsea camera deployed to observe operations. The drill bi t cleared the seafloor at $0643\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 July and the ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to the northeast. The bit wa s released at $0756\,\mathrm{h}$ and at $0955\,\mathrm{h}$ the pipe reentered Hole U1554F. The drill string was deployed t o $589.2~\mathrm{m}$ DSF inside the casing string. The triple combo logging tool string was made up and ru n for two passes of the borehole from the base of the casing string $(602\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF})$ ), to the bottom of th e hole at $779\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. At $2010\,\mathrm{h}$ , the triple combo tool string reached the drill floor and was broke n down. The FMS-sonic tool string was made up and run at $0410~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 July and completed tw o passes of the borehole. The Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI) tool string was then made up an d deployed to the bottom of the hole with two logging passes. The drill pipe was pulled up from 58 8 m DSF to $69\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF}$ in preparation of running the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) from the base o f the hole up through the casing string. However, foggy conditions throughout the afternoon an d evening inhibited visibility and prevented the start of the protected species observation (PSO ) protocols. At daybreak, visibility had worsened and conditions were not forecast to improve unti l evening. Because of the time already allocated to Site U1554, the decision was made to abando n the VSI logging run and begin operations at Site U1562. The drill pipe was pulled up and cleare d the seafloor at $0755\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 July, ending Hole U1554F.  

The vessel returned to Hole U1554F on 21 July 2021 to attempt to complete the VSI logging operations. The ship completed the $6.1\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit in DP mode from Site U1562 to Hole U1554F a t $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill string reentered Hole U1554F at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ and the pipe was run to $68.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF i n the casing string to prepare for downhole logging with the VSI tool. Fog had formed around th e vessel and after waiting until $1250\,\mathrm{h}$ , the VSI was deployed to the base of the casing string. Nearl y immediately whales were spotted in the exclusion zone, which delayed the start of the VSI operations. After $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of tracking whales in the vicinity of the vessel, foggy conditions reduced visibilit y prohibiting the continuation of PSO watch. With the fog forecast to worsen throughout the evening and into the next day, the planned VSI operations were canceled at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ in favor of corin g at the next site. The drill pipe was pulled out of the hole and the end of the pipe cleared the seafloor at $1840\,\mathrm{h}$ and the rig floor at $2210\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 21 July. The rig floor was secured for transit and th e thrusters were raised. The vessel began the $39\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1563 at $2236\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending operations at Hole U1554F and Site U1554 during Expedition 395C.  

# 4.1.2.3. Expedition 395  

# 4.1.2.3.1. Hole U1554G  

Following a $104\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1564, the ship arrived at Site U1554 at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 Jun e 2023. The thrusters were lowered, and the vessel switched to DP mode, beginning Hole U1554 G $\!\!\left(60^{\circ}7.5037^{\prime}\mathrm{N}\!\!\right)$ , $26^{\circ}42.1129^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; 1868.7 mbsl) at $1842\,\mathrm{{h}}.$ . Hole U1554G was spudded at $0340\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 8 June and recovered $5.43\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment. Cores 1H–31H were advanced to $288.4\textrm{m}$ DSF. Afte r reaching refusal of the APC system, the half-length APC (HLAPC) was deployed for Cores 32F– 34F (288.4–302.5 m DSF).  

XCB coring advanced the hole from 302.5 to $355.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF, recovering Cores 395-U1554G-35 X through 40X. The target depth of the hole was achieved, and the drill string was pulled out of th e hole with the bit clearing the seafloor at $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 June, marking the end of Hole U1554G.  A total of 40 cores were taken in Hole U1554G over the $355.0~\mathrm{m}$ cored interval. Core recovery wa s $102\%$ and $362.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was collected.  

# 4.1.2.3.2. Hole U1554H  

The ship was offset $^{20\textrm{m}}$ south of Hole U1554G. At $2135\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 29 June 2023, Hole U1554 H $(60^{\circ}07.49852^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , 26°42.1188′W; 1866.7 mbsl) was spudded with Core 1H, and $9.4\,\mathrm{m}$ was recovered. Cores 1H–30H advanced to $280.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

The decision was made to switch to the XCB system when the overpull on the core barrel s increased and Cores 395-U1554H-31X through 38X (280.1–354.9 m DSF) were collected. Afte r reaching the target depth, the drill string was pulled out of the hole. The drill bit cleared the seafloor at $0640\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 July, ending Hole U1554H and operations at Site U1564. The vessel began th e transit in DP mode to Site U1562. A total of 38 cores were recorded for Hole U1554H, with 370. 1 m of core recovered across a $354.9\;\mathrm{m}$ interval $(104\%)$ .  

# 4.1.3. Principal results  

# 4.1.3.1. Sedimentology  

The Holocene to middle Miocene sediments cored at Site U1554 are relatively homogeneous, primarily composed of silty clay with varying but minor amounts of siliceous and carbonate microfossils, as well as minor proportions of sand (Figure F7). Near the sediment/basement interface, the sediments transition to nannofossil chalk. Core recovery through the sedimentary sequence i s near-continuous in the upper $475\mathrm{~m~}$ . Based on the observations of sediment composition alon g with the attenuation pattern of natural gamma radiation (NGR), magnetic susceptibility (MS), an d calcium carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ weight percent, Site U1554 is divided into four lithostratigraphi c Units (I–IV). Units I, II, and IV include two subunits. The measured $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ varies from 0.26 t o $84.76~\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Features of note include glass layers, bands of variable color at unit or subunit boundaries, basaltic and metamorphic clasts, shell fragments, and halo/pyritized and silt-filled burrows.  

# 4.1.3.2. Igneous petrology  

The cores from Hole 395C-U1554F are dominated by slightly to moderately altered basalt (Figur e F7). An additional meter of basalt was also recovered in Hole 395C-U1554E. The contact betwee n the basalt and overlying sedimentary strata was partly recovered across Cores 395C-U1554F-4 R through 6R. In Hole 395C-U1554F, detailed core observations reveal a series of sheet flows an d pillow lavas. The sheet flows consist of hypocrystalline aphyric olivine basalt. Flow boundaries an d fractures generally show brown alteration halos, especially in the upper third of the hole, and vesicles are often filled. The pillow lavas are highly fragmented with glass rinds, chilled margins, an d vesicle bands. In the upper $40\;\mathrm{m}$ of the basement, thin sedimentary and volcanoclastic horizon s are common, consisting of calcareous mudstone conglomerate layers and peperites. The peperite s become increasingly baked and crystalline downhole. Thin section examination reveals finegrained aphyric or sparsely olivine phyric basalts with low to moderate alteration. They contai n abundant olivine microphenocrysts, as well as some large olivine phenocrysts with occasional spinel inclusions. The groundmass contains acicular and skeletal swallowtail plagioclase laths, rar e clinopyroxene microcrystals, opaque oxides, and altered glass. The inferred volcanic stratigraph y consists of a sequence of interbedded extrusive sheet flows and pillow lavas with minor evidenc e of sediment deposition.  

# 4.1.3.3. Alteration petrology  

Basalt at Site U1554 (Holes 395C-U1554E and U1554F) predominantly contains background-typ e alteration, although localized alteration in the form of halos around fractures is present to a lesse r degree. The alteration assemblage is chlorite $^+$ Fe-oxide/oxyhydroxides $^+$ clay with minor carbonate. In thin section, saponite and chlorite dominate the alteration assemblage and disseminated magnetite is observed. Vesicles are commonly filled with celadonite, and to a lesser extent chlorite, Feoxide/oxyhydroxides, carbonate, zeolite, and rare sulfides. Basalt fragments in peperite interval s are variably altered to palagonite material.  

Fracture density at Site U1554 is ${\sim}28$ fractures per meter and is uniform with depth. Fractur e mineral fill is dominantly Fe-oxide/oxyhydroxide $^+$ carbonate±chlorite with occasional clay an d celadonite. Some fractures are filled with carbonate sediment in intervals where interlayered sediment and peperites are common. Alteration halos are observed around some fractures with color s including gray, brown, and brown with a gray border.  

# 4.1.3.4. Micropaleontology  

At Site U1554, a $647~\mathrm{m}$ interval of upper Miocene to upper Pleistocene silty clay and nannofossi l chalk was recovered across multiple holes. Micropaleontological analyses were undertaken o n sediment samples to $647.7\:\mathrm{m}$ core depth below seafloor, Method A (CSF-A), in Hole 395C-U1554 E and to 354.97 m CSF-A in Hole 395-U1554G. Biohorizons used in the age model are based o n calcareous nannoplankton, planktonic foraminifers, and bolboforms. Calcareous nannofossils an d planktonic foraminifers are present with varying abundances, from barren or nearly barren samples to those with very high abundances. Bolboforms, when present, are always rare or few.

Figure F7. Lithostratigraphic summary, Site U1554. cps $=$ counts per second, Roman numerals $=$ sedimentary units, Arabi c numerals $=$ igneous units.  

A total of eleven calcareous nannofossil Pleistocene biohorizons are identified in the upper 234.9 6 m CSF-A of Hole U1554G, representing ages of 0.09 to 1.71 Ma. Four nannofossil biohorizons ar e identified through the upper Miocene to Pliocene, including the biohorizon Top Coccolithu s miopelagicus, which constrains the bottom of the hole to be older than $11.04\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . A total of fiv e Pleistocene, two Pliocene, and three Miocene planktonic foraminifer biohorizons where recognized, with an estimated age of the base of the sediment section to be between 10.54 and $11.76\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Four upper Miocene bolboform biohorizons are recognised with calibrated ages between 5.60 an d $10.20\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . In the interval $\mathord{\sim}530$ to $630\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, glauconite is abundant in foraminifer sampl e residues.  

# 4.1.3.5. Physical properties  

At Site U1554, bulk density shows an increase from 1.4 to ${\sim}1.8\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ from seafloor to $450\:\mathrm{m}$ CSFA with noticeable increases and decreases superimposed on this trend. Both MS and NGR sugges t similar oscillatory behavior to that observed in the bulk density. These variations become mor e pronounced below ${\sim}450\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Poor core recovery in Hole 395C-U1554E between $470{-}570\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A causes more detailed interpretations for physical properties to be challenging in this interval. The bottom ${\sim}80\;\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1554E (570–647 m CSF-A) is characterized by variations in bul k density, a trend also expressed by the MS, color records, and more variable lithology. The limestone in the bottom two cores (395C-U1554E-61X and 62X) shows higher bulk densities $(>\!1.8$ $\mathbf{g}/\mathbf{cm}^{3})$ ), lower MS, lower NGR, and lighter colors compared to the overlaying sediments.  

# 4.1.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

$\Lambda\sim\!0{-}70\,\mathrm{m}$ splice for Holes U1554A–U1554C was previously constructed during Expedition 384. In the full splice, the upper $^{80\textrm{m}}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) interval is ver y similar to that produced during Expedition 384, and includes Holes U1554A–U1554C. From Cor e 395C-U1554E-2H, tied to Core 384-U1554A-7H from the initial splice, through Core 395- U1554H-23H, a continuous splice was constructed using only Holes 395C-U1554E and 395- U1554H. Between 225 and $345\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF several gaps are unavoidable.  

# 4.1.3.7. Paleomagnetism  

Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) was measured for sedimentary cores recovered fro m Expedition 384 Holes U1554A–U1554C, Expedition 395C Holes U1554E and U1554F, and Expedition 395 Holes U1554G–U1554H. The cores were demagnetized with a stepwise alternatin g field cleaning protocol, with the exceptions of Hole U1554G and the upper part of Hole U1554H. The resolution of these measurements varies from 1 to $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The demagnetization step at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ from Hole U1554E was used to establish an age-depth trend for the upper $400~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Sit e U1554. Between $400\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and the bottom of Core 395C-U1554E-61X at $645\mathrm{\,m\,CSF-A}$ , apparent gaps in sediment deposition hampered interpretation of the magnetostratigraphy.  

NRM was measured for basalt cores recovered in Hole 395C-U1554F. The basalts in Hole U1554 F do not fully demagnetize at $25~\mathrm{mT}$ but the drilling overprint is removed. The demagnetizatio n reveals mostly normal polarities and one of two behaviors: (1) $80\%$ magnetization loss before 2 5 mT or (2) no significant loss of magnetization by $25~\mathrm{mT}$ . The variations in MS coincide with thos e in NRM intensity before and after demagnetization at $25~\mathrm{mT}$ .  

# 4.1.3.8. Geochemistry  

Cores taken during Expeditions 384 (Hole U1554A), 395C (Holes U1554E and U1554F), and 39 5 (Holes U1554G and U1554H) were analyzed for headspace gas, interstitial water (IW) chemistry, and bulk sediment geochemistry. Headspace gas analyses were conducted at Holes U1554A an d U1554E; methane concentrations are variable and range ${\sim}0{-}12{,}000$ ppmv (Figure F8). Ethane wa s absent in all holes. Holes U1554E and U1554G were analyzed for IW chemistry and bulk sedimen t geochemistry. Calcium ion $(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+})$ and magnesium ion $(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+})$ concentrations display similar trend s with depth. Sulfate ion $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ concentrations display a bimodal distribution with seawater-lik e values at the top and bottom of the sediment column. $C a C O_{3}$ weight percent generally decrease s downhole, trending from ${\sim}30~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at the top to ${\sim}17~\mathrm{wt\%}$ near the sediment/basement interface. Bulk sediment generally has low total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total sulfu r (TS) content. Dissolved oxygen measurements were conducted on whole-round cores from Hol e U1554G to ${\sim}347~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Core 40X).  

# 4.1.3.9. Downhole logging  

Logging operations were undertaken in Holes 395C-U1554E ${\sim}0{-}640\;\mathrm{m}$ wireline log depth belo w seafloor [WSF]) and 395C-U1554F ( ${\sim}604{-}770\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{WSI}$ F). Hole U1554E was logged with the tripl e combo and FMS-sonic tool strings, and Hole U1554F was logged with the triple combo, FMSsonic, and UBI tool strings. Logging responses at Site U1554 define five logging units, with subunits in Logging Units 1, 2, and 4. Logging Subunit 1a $_{\mathrm{0-75~m}}$ WSF) is defined by gamma lo g measurements collected through drill pipe, and Logging Subunit 1b ( $75{-}108\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF) is characterized by low density and low gamma log. Logging Unit 2 ( $108–440\mathrm{~m~WSF})$ ) is characterized b y cyclic, 1 to $10\;\mathrm{m}$ long fluctuations in gamma log, the peaks of which are dominated by high thorium counts. MS data shows a similar cyclic pattern in this logging unit. The cyclic gamma and M S logging responses occur at shorter wavelengths in Logging Subunit 2a (108–375 m WSF) than i n Logging Subunit 2b (375–440 m WSF). Logging Unit 3 $(440{-}495\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{wWSF})$ is marked by relativel y lower gamma log and longer wavelength fluctuations in MS, and the density $({\sim}1.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ an d porosity $(\sim\!0.6)$ in this unit are remarkably invariant. Logging Unit 4 (495–647 m WSF) is marke d by relatively high gamma log and can be divided into three subunits: Logging Subunit 4a (495–53 5 m WSF) shows invariant $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ values, Logging Subunit 4b ( $535–635\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF) shows relativel y high $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ (up to $\leq2615\ \mathrm{m/s}$ and $850\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , respectively), and Logging Subunit $4c$ ( $635{-}647\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF) contains the lowermost sediment and the top of the sediment–basement transition zone, the top of which is marked by an abrupt decrease in density and increase in porosity. FMS borehole images for the sedimentary section of Site U1554 show decimeter-scale, shallow dipping, alternating conductive and resistive layers. Logging Unit 5 denotes the basaltic basement of Sit e U1554, with an increase in resistivity and density. The FMS and UBI borehole images show clea r layering in the basalt basement, some of which contain numerous features that may represent fractures and basaltic pillow margins.  

# 4.1.3.10. Age model  

Age model tie points at Site U1554 are based upon paleomagnetic and paleontologic constraints. From the seafloor to the base of Matuyama Chron at 402.34 m CSF-A, the age model is based o n magnetostratigraphic reversals complemented by calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy. Below that level, a succession of magnetic polarity reversals is recorded, bu t their magnetostratigraphic interpretation is highly uncertain because of gaps in the record, so th e age model relies on biostratigraphy alone, which is based on calcareous nannofossils, planktoni c foraminifers, and bolboforms. The age at sediment/basement interface is extrapolated at ${\sim}12.15$ Ma.

# 4.2. Site U1562  

# 4.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1562 (proposed Site REYK-3B) is located in the North Atlantic Ocean, east of the Reykjane s Ridge and on Björn contourite drift south of Iceland (Figure F1). Site U1562 is located on Seismi c Line JC50-1 (CMP 39920), near the intersection with line JC50-C2 (CMP 685), both obtained i n 2010 during RRS James Cook Cruise JC50.  

Site U1562 is located on VSR 3, and has an estimated basement age of $13.86\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The sedimen t section at Site U1562 is marked by the Björn drift deposit, a thicker section of which was cored a t Site U1554.  

Cores and data from this site will address all three primary science objectives: (1) crustal accretio n and mantle behavior, (2) ocean circulation, gateways and sedimentation, and (3) time-dependen t hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust.  

# 4.2.2. Operations  

Site U1562 $60^{\circ}06.3006^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $26^{\circ}30.1044^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ consisted of three holes, Holes 395C-U1562A, 395CU1562B, and 395-U1562C, which range $300.4–561.5\mathrm{~m~l~}$ DSF (Table T1). A total of 144 cores wer e recovered for Site U1562. These cores collected $792.57\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment and basalt over a core d interval of $876.5\;\mathrm{m}$ $90\%$ recovery). Downhole wireline logging operations using four logging tool s took place at Hole U1562B. The total time spent at Site U1562 was 12.3 days.  

# 4.2.2.1. Expedition 395C  

# 4.2.2.1.1. Hole U1562A  

The vessel began the $6.1\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Hole 395C-U1554F to Site U1562 under DP mode o n 10 July 2021. At $1306\;\mathrm{h}$ on 10 July, the vessel arrived at Site U1562 and the APC/XCB BHA wa s made up.  

Hole 395C-U1562A $\left(60^{\circ}06.3030^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{:}\right.$ , $26^{\circ}30.1245^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; 2003 mbsl), located $21\;\mathrm{m}$ west of the site coordinates, was spudded at $2115~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 July. Cores 1H–21H advanced from 0 to $192.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF. Th e HLAPC core barrels were made up and coring continued with Cores 22F–57F $(192.0{-}361.2\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF) with $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ advances. The XCB was deployed and cut Cores 58X–64X $(361.2–429.1\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m\,DSF}}$ ). After recovering Core 64X, the XCB cutting shoe was severely damaged and slightly melted an d the base of the core catcher contained basalt. Another core barrel was deployed and Core 65X wa s advanced to ensure that the bit had reached basement. The bit advanced $0.7\textrm{m}$ over an hour an d Core 65X contained $0.68\:\mathrm{m}$ of basalt $97\%$ recovery), confirming a basement depth of $429.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The final depth of Hole U1562A was $429.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The drill string was pulled from the hole, wit h the bit reaching the seafloor at $1535~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 July. Hole U1562A ended when the bit reached th e rotary table at $1935\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# 4.2.2.1.2. Hole U1562B  

Following the end of Hole 395C-U1562A, an RCB BHA with a $_{\mathrm{C-4~RCB}}$ bit was made up and th e drill string lowered to the seafloor. The ship was offset $21\textrm{m}$ ESE of Hole U1562A, near the sit e coordinates, and Hole U1562B $\!\!\{60^{\circ}6.2993^{\prime}\mathrm{N}}\!\!,$ , $26^{\circ}30.1026^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; water depth $2003\;\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ) was spudde d at $0320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 July 2021 and advanced without coring to $408.1\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The center bit was recovered and an RCB core barrel was deployed. Cores 2R–19R advanced from 408.1 to $500.7\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The sediment/basement interface was recovered in Core 4R at $429.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF. While coring Cor e 19R, the penetration rate dropped to $1~\mathrm{m/h}$ and there was erratic torque on the bit. It was suspected that the drill bit was damaged and the rig floor crew began pulling the pipe out of the hole. A free-fall funnel was deployed at $0220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 July to allow for the reentry of Hole U1562B. Th e bit cleared the seafloor at $0312\,\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table at $0708\,\mathrm{h}$ . The bit was indeed damaged an d a new C-7 RCB coring bit was made up to the BHA and the crew assembled the drill string. Th e subsea camera, along with the Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) tool, was deployed a t $^{1130\,\mathrm{h}}$ to observe the reentry of Hole U1562B, which occurred at $1450\,\mathrm{h}$ . The subsea camera wa s retrieved and the drill string advanced to $500.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. After cleaning the hole with a highviscosity mud sweep, Cores 20R–28R advanced from 500.7 to $561.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Coring operation s concluded at Hole U1562B after coring $132.5\;\mathrm{m}$ into the basement section. The final depth of Hol e U1562B was $561.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF.  

Following coring, the rotary shifting tool was run to release the bit into the bottom of the hole. Th e drill string was pulled up and end of the pipe was set at $89\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The triple combo logging too l string was made up and deployed at $1755~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 July. After completing two successful passes o f the entire hole, the tools were retrieved and reached the rig floor at $2310\;\mathrm{h}.$ . The FMS-sonic too l was made up and deployed at $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 July. Following two passes that extended to the base o f the hole, the FMS-Sonic tool was pulled from the hole and reached the rig floor at $0645\,\mathrm{h}$ . The VS I was lowered to the base of the hole and a total of four depth stations (420.5, 426, 459.9, and 556. 6 m DSF) were completed, two in the basement section, one at the sediment/basement interface, and one in the lowermost sediment. The final logging run, using the UBI, began at $1445~\mathrm{h}$ . Th e UBI made two passes of the basement section, acquiring $360^{\circ}$ borehole images. The UBI wa s recovered at the rig floor at $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill string was pulled out of the hole to $\mathord{\sim}1489$ mbsl an d the ship began the transit in DP mode to Hole 395C-U1554F at $2355\ \mathrm{h}$ on 20 July, ending Sit e U1562.  

# 4.2.2.2. Expedition 395  

# 4.2.2.2.1. Hole U1562C  

The vessel returned to Site U1562 on 1 July 2023. Following a $6.1\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Hole 395- U1554H, the vessel was over the site coordinates at $1210\,\mathrm{h}_{1}$ marking the start of Hole 395-U1562 C $(60^{\circ}06.3015^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $26^{\circ}30.0754^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; $2002.7\,\mathrm{\mbsl}_{\cdot}$ ), which was spudded at $1500\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . Cores $1\mathrm{H-}16\mathrm{H}$ advanced the hole to $139.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Refusal of the APC system was reached at $139.3\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF and th e HLAPC was deployed for the remainder of the hole. Cores 17F–53F advanced the hole to $300.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Five short, drilled intervals $\left(1.5{-}2\mathrm{~m~}\right)$ long) were used to offset coring gaps between Hole s 395C-U1562A and 395-U1562C for stratigraphic correlation. After reaching the target depth o f $300\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, the drill pipe was pulled from the hole with the bit clearing the seafloor at $0405\,\mathrm{h}$ on  3 July. A total of 48 cores were collected at Hole U1562C, recovering $308.45\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over  a $293.4\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval ( $105\%$ recovery). The BHA was broken down and the rig secured for transit. At $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ the ship was switched from DP to cruise mode, ending operations at Site U1562.  

# 4.2.3. Principal results  

# 4.2.3.1. Sedimentology  

The sediments at this site include silty clay with variable amounts of carbonate (Lithostratigraphi c Units I–III) and nannofossil chalk (Unit IV) (Figure F9). Based on smear slide observations, carbonate microfossils are present in amounts ranging from a few to over $30\%$ . Siliceous microfossil s are present throughout but in minor amounts $(<\!10\%)$ . The terrigenous component is dominate d by quartz and feldspar, although glauconite and glass are also present. Glass abundance increase s from Unit I to Unit II. Immediately below the lithologic boundary between Units I and II there ar e several sharp contacts. Unit III is defined by the abundance of features consistent with soft sediment deformation, likely caused by a series of slumps. There is a sharp contact between Units II I and IV. Weight percent $C a C O_{3}$ is variable, but average values increase downhole until the chalk i n Unit IV. Small clasts of volcaniclastic material (pumice and scoria) and larger clasts of variabl e lithology are found throughout the sequence at Site U1562.  

# 4.2.3.2. Igneous petrology  

Hole 395C-U1562B was drilled $133~\mathrm{m}$ into basement with a recovery of $48\%$ . In addition, glass y lava fragments and the top of a weathered sheet flow were recovered from the base of Hole 395CU1562A. The sediment–basement contact is poorly defined. Cores from this site consist o f sparsely to moderately olivine phyric pillow lavas with a few massive sheet flow intervals up to 1 0 m thick (Figure F9). Fragmented cryptocrystalline pillow lavas are characterized by curved chille d margins, glassy rinds, and abundant vesicles. Sheet flows have chilled weathered tops and mediu m grained avesicular interiors. Intercalated peperites and mudstone are common. The peperiti c intervals display abundant evidence for lava–sediment mingling, including fragmented basal t clasts with quenched rims and fluidal margins. Thin sections from pillow lavas have abundan t groundmass olivines, sometimes with dendritic forms suggestive of rapid cooling during th e eruptive process. The abundance of sediment-rich material at this site suggests that significan t amounts of sediment accumulated between eruptions, with preliminary estimates of eruptio n hiatuses on the order of $\mathrm{\sim}10^{5}\,\mathrm{y}.$  

# 4.2.3.3. Alteration petrology  

The majority of basalt core recovered from Site U1562 is slightly to moderately altered. Intervals o f the basalt basement intermixed with carbonate sediment and peperite intervals are highly to completely altered. Alteration is dominantly pervasive, although localized alteration, mainly in th e form of fracture halos is also observed. The alteration assemblage is clay+Fe-oxide/oxyhydroxide s with minor chlorite and celadonite. Basalt clasts in peperite intervals are mostly altered to palagonite material. Vesicles are dominantly filled with celadonite, Fe-oxide/oxyhydroxides, and calcit e with some saponite and minor zeolite. Vesicle fills are commonly mineralogically zoned with multiple minerals in each. Fracture density in 395C-Hole U1562B is ${\sim}21$ fractures per meter and i s near constant with depth. Fractures are dominantly ${\leq}0.5\ \mathrm{mm}$ wide and occur either as isolated, nonconnected fractures or within anastomosing networks. Fracture mineral fills are dominantl y carbonate±Fe-oxide/oxyhydroxide with minor clay, chlorite, and celadonite. Peperite and altere d carbonate sediment intervals contain complex carbonate filled fracture networks. Fracture alteration halos are up to $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ wide from the fracture wall, and are either pale gray, brown, green-gra y or green-brown in color.

# 4.2.3.4. Micropaleontology  

At Site U1562 micropaleontological analyses were undertaken on samples from all three holes. Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers are generally present in moderate to hig h abundances, with occasional barren or nearly barren samples. Bolboforms, when present, are generally rare or few. Calcareous microfossil preservation is mostly excellent to very good, with occasional intervals of moderate preservation. The Pleistocene succession is well constrained b y biostratigraphy, with eight calcareous nannofossil biohorizons identified in Hole 395-U1562C an d five planktonic foraminifer biohorizons identified in both Holes 395C-U1562A and 395-U1562C. No upper Pliocene biohorizons were identified, but one calcareous nannofossil and two planktonic foraminifer biohorizons constrain the lower Pliocene succession. The basal upper Miocen e sedimentary succession is also constrained by one calcareous nannofossil and two planktonic foraminifer biohorizons, as well as three bolboform biohorizons. Based on calcareous microfossi l biostratigraphy, the bottom of the sedimentary succession is between 11.04 and 11.76 Ma. Durin g the rotary drilling of Hole 395C-U1562B into basement, a substantial interval of sediment $(\mathord{\sim}0.65$ m thick) was encountered $45\mathrm{~m~}$ into basalt and yielded a well-preserved foraminifer assemblag e that is significantly older than the lowermost sample examined from the sedimentary succession.  

# 4.2.3.5. Physical properties  

Holes 395C-U1562A and 395-U1562C recovered overlapping stratigraphic sections and, thus, display similar physical properties. Gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, MS, and NG R increase gradually downhole in the upper $130\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A with meter-scale oscillations superimposed on this trend (Figure F10). The latter two parameters sharply drop at $130\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A}$ . Belo w this depth, bulk density displays small variations around an average of $1.6\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and MS and NG R show a more variable pattern: large amplitude variations until ${\sim}350\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A after which cor e recovery is lower and both measures show lower values. The changes in color properties in th e sediments of Holes U1562A and U1562C can be divided in similar stratigraphic intervals as th e whole-round property profiles.  

![](images/3519a18b8c2c72027d61659573b055f351278babfef5a9476c91891ff9131e7c.jpg)  
Figure F10. Whole-round physical properties measurements, Hole U1562C. MS: black $=$ WRMSL, red $=$ SHMSL. $V_{\mathsf{P}}$ : black $=$ WRMSL, red diamonds $=$ calipers.  

In Hole 395C-U1562B, voids and gaps between the core and liners in the basalt sections make th e interpretation of their physical properties profile less straightforward. The sedimentary an d peperite units in Hole U1562B are apparent in color records, with higher red-green-blue (RGB) $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ values.  

Caliper measurements of $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ for the sediments from Hole 395C-U1562B are about $1700\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , an d vary between 4725 and $6053~\mathrm{m/s}$ for the basalt section. Sedimentary $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ values for Hole 395- U1562C average around $1500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Bulk density values in Hole 395C-U1562A range 1.370–1.67 3 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . Porosity is around $80~\mathrm{vol\%}$ and ranges to $65~\mathrm{vol\%}$ (average $=\,70\ {\mathrm{vol}}\%$ ). Grain densit y decreases downhole from 2.85 to $2.60~\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$ (average $=2.74~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ ). Thermal conductivity, $\mathrm{K},$ i s typically $0.75{-}1.20\ \mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ for the sediments in Holes 395C-U1562A and 395-U1562C, an d $1.40{-}1.80\,\mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ for Hole 395C-U1562B.  

# 4.2.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

Correlation was achieved without gaps from the seafloor through Cores 395C-U1562A-16H an d 395-U1562C-17F ( $155.125\mathrm{~m~}$ core composite depth below seafloor, Method A [CCSF-A]). Smal l coring gaps are present below this depth to ${\sim}280\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A, but cores can still be tied with som e confidence based on the broad cyclic patterns and the comparison with wireline logging MS dat a from Hole 395C-U1562B. Below Core 395C-U1562A-35F, correlation between holes becomes difficult, probably due to the presence of disrupted sequences (e.g., soft sediment deformation).  

# 4.2.3.7. Paleomagnetism  

The sedimentary rocks of Holes 395C-U1562A, 395C-U1562B, and 395-U1562C were demagnetized with a stepwise alternating field cleaning protocol (Figure F11). For sediments, an overprin t was removed by application of an alternating field of $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The primary characteristic remanen t magnetization (ChRM) was successfully isolated by $25\,\mathrm{mT}$ and used to create an age-depth plot fo r the hole. NRM and MS values both show a variable cyclicity between 160 and $350\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Fo r basalts in Hole U1562B, demagnetization revealed one of two behaviors: 1) $80\%$ magnetizatio n loss before $25~\mathrm{mT}$ or 2) no significant loss of magnetization by $25~\mathrm{mT}$ . The variations in MS coincide with those in NRM intensity and intensity after $25~\mathrm{mT}$ of demagnetization.  

# 4.2.3.8. Geochemistry  

Holes 395C-U1562A and 395C-U1562B were analyzed for headspace gas, IW chemistry, and bul k sediment geochemistry. Cores collected from Hole 395-U1562C were analyzed for bulk sedimen t geochemistry. Methane concentrations are low and range ${\sim}0{-}3$ ppmv (Figure F12). Ethane i s absent in all samples. IW calcium ion $(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+})$ concentrations display a bimodal distribution wit h highest values near the sediment/water and sediment/basement interfaces. Magnesium ion $(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+})$ concentrations display a generally decreasing trend with depth, with a small increase at th e sediment/basement interface. Sulfate ion $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ concentrations display a bimodal distributio n with seawater-like values at the top and bottom of the sediment column. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ weight percen t generally increases downcore, trending from ${\sim}0$ to $33\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ in the top $100\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to ${\sim}83~\mathrm{wt\%}$ near the sediment/basement interface. Bulk sediment generally exhibits low TOC, TN, and T S content.  

# 4.2.3.9. Downhole logging  

Logging operations were carried out at Hole 395C-U1562B. A full suite of downhole logs was collected with the triple combo (gamma log, spectral gamma ray, resistivity, density, porosity, MS), FMS-sonic, and VSI tool strings for the sediment and basement sections. In the basement section, the UBI was also deployed. Formation temperature measurements were acquired at Hole 395CU1562A.  

The sedimentary section shows three distinct logging units including multiple subunits. Loggin g Subunit 1a ( $0{-}85\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF) was collected through the drill pipe and only collected gamma log an d spectral gamma ray. Logging Subunit 1b (85–136 m WSF) shows an increase in the gamma log t o peaks up to ${\sim}25~\mathrm{gAPI}$ , which are dominated by Th counts. The density increases in this interva l from ${\sim}1.2$ to ${\sim}1.6~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ . Logging Unit 2 $136{-}350\mathrm{~m~W~}$ SF) is characterized by an overall highe r cyclic gamma signal (average $=20.5\pm2.8\mathrm{\gAPI}$ I). This cyclic logging response is also observed i n the MS, $V_{\mathrm{{S}}},$ and porosity measurements of this logging unit. Logging Subunits 2a ( $136{-}305\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF) and 2b ( $305{-}350\mathrm{\;m\;K\;}$ SF) are differentiated from each other based on the thickness of thes e logging response cycles. Logging Unit 3 $350{-}426\,\mathrm{~m~}\,\mathrm{WSF}$ ) shows clearly different loggin g responses with a sharp drop in gamma log and an increase in density with depth from 1.58 to 1.7 2 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . MS is very low (average $=7.9$ SI). The image logs of the sedimentary section show layerin g as well as mottling patterns; however, the frequent ledges and borehole breakouts are influencin g the data quality.  

Logging Unit 4 encompasses the entire basement section of the hole $(426\mathrm{-}560\mathrm{\,m\,V}$ WSF). The top o f Unit 4 is defined by marked changes in resistivity, density, porosity, $V_{\mathrm{p}},\,V_{\mathrm{S}},$ and MS, rather than th e gamma log. All logging responses show variability throughout the basement sequence, wit h increases in MS correlating to increases in $V_{\mathrm{p}},$ density and resistivity, and decreases in porosity, and vice versa. The image logs as well as the wireline data indicate the potential presence of sedimentary layers intercalated with the basaltic basement. Overall, both image logs are of excellen t quality in the basement section of the hole.

# 4.2.3.10. Age model  

Magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic age constraints for the sedimentary succession i n Holes 395C-U1562A and 395-U1562C are combined to create a site age model. Thirteen ag e datums were chosen to anchor the age-depth model. The succession appears relatively continuou s to ${\sim}22\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. From ${\sim}22$ to $28.83\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, the succession is evidently condensed and/or subject to hiatuses. The age model for the lower part of the succession in Hole U1562A is based on  a series of foraminifer, bolboform, and nannofossil biohorizons. These constraints are considered t o have a low reliability, for various reasons relating to taxonomic uncertainty, low or variable abundances, and/or age calibration issues. Linear extrapolation of the age model suggests an approximate age of $13.0\,\mathrm{Ma}$ for the oldest part of the sedimentary succession overlying basalt.  

# 4.3. Site U1602  

# 4.3.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1602 (proposed Site REYK-14B) is located on the eastern margin of Greenland in the Nort h Atlantic Ocean, coinciding with the elongate sedimentary body, Eirik drift (Figure F1). Site U160 2 is located on a VSR, tentatively identified in free-air gravity anomaly data, that is one of th e V-shaped structures that straddle the Reykjanes ridge flanks and whose origin in relation of th e Iceland hotspot is debated. The site sits on ocean crust with an age of $49.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , estimated fro m magnetic anomalies and plate reconstruction models.  

The Reykjanes Ridge flanks are the site of major contourite drift deposits, Björn and Gardar drift s on the eastern flank of the ridge. In contrast, Eirik drift consists of an elongate, mounde d contourite deposit that is plastered along the East Greenland margin. These rapidly accumulate d contourite drift sediments have the potential to record variations in past climate and ocea n circulation on millennial timescales. The sedimentation rate of the drifts can serve as a proxy fo r deep water current strength, providing information on oceanic gateways to the Norwegian Se a and their potential ties to Iceland mantle plume behavior. The sedimentary section at Site U160 2 on Eirik drift has the potential to preserve detailed records of the evolution of the Greenlan d and Iceland Ice Sheets and of variations in the Western Boundary Under Current. Site U1602 no t only complements the sites on the eastern side of the Reykjanes Ridge and the drilling of Björ n and Gardar contourite drifts and, paired with the pre-drift record of Site U1564, will recover olde r sediment, providing insights into the North Atlantic ocean circulation and sedimentatio n deep into the Cenozoic. Site U1602 is located on Seismic Line JC50-1, obtained in 2010 durin g RRS James Cook Cruise JC50. Sediment thickness at Site U1602 is ${\sim}1376\mathrm{~m~}$ based on seismi c imagery.  

The main target for Site U1602 was to obtain a continuous sedimentary record of Eirik drift.   
Another target was to obtain a sedimentary record throughout the middle Miocene warm period.

Figure F12. Composite gas analyses of methane concentrations and sulfate concentrations, Site U1562.  

A final target, time permitting, was to core into basement. This final objective was not achieve d because of time constraints. Cores and data from this site will address the primary science objectives related to mantle behavior, ocean circulation, gateways, and sedimentation.  

# 4.3.2. Operations  

Site U1602 ( $\mathrm{61^{\circ}11.7138^{\prime}N}$ , $38^{\circ}10.8186^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) consisted of five holes, which range $8.8–1365.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DS F (Table T1). A total of 230 cores were recorded for Site U1602. These cores collected $1444.65\;\mathrm{m}$ o f sediment over a $1903.8\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval ( $76\%$ recovery). Two drilled intervals were recorded ove r a $531.3\mathrm{~m~}$ interval. Downhole wireline logging operations were attempted at Hole U1602E an d were partially successful. The total time spent at Site U1602 was 19.5 days.  

# 4.3.2.1. Hole U1602A  

The ship completed the $350\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit, averaging $11.0\;\mathrm{kt}$ , from Site U1562 to Site U1602 at 170 1 h on 4 July 2023. The thrusters were lowered, and the ship was in DP mode at $1718\,\mathrm{h}$ , marking th e start of Site U1602. The bit was spaced out to initiate Hole U1602A ( $61^{\circ}11.7138^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $38^{\circ}10.8186^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ), which was spudded at $0425~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 July. Core 1H recovered $8.8~\mathrm{m}$ of core, establishing a seafloo r depth of 2708.6 mbsl. However, Core 1H also recovered part of the “pig,” a foam device with meta l bristles used to clean rust from the inside of the drill pipe, which disturbed the mudline interval. Hole U1602A was terminated to recover an undisturbed mudline. A total of $8.81\textrm{m}$ of core wa s recovered over an $8.8\;\mathrm{m}$ interval ( $100\%$ recovery).  

# 4.3.2.2. Hole U1602B  

Hole U1602B $\!\!\left(61^{\circ}11.7144^{\prime}\mathrm{N}\!\!\right)$ , $38^{\circ}10.8184^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; $2709.2\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was spudded at $0535~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 July fro m the same ship position and Core 1H recovered $5.15\;\mathrm{m}$ of core with a good mudline. Coring continued from Cores 2H–16H (5.2–147.7 m DSF). The HLAPC system was deployed for Cores 17F– 38F (147.7–251.1 m DSF). Piston coring refusal was reached at Core 38F, which required 80 klb o f overpull to free the barrel from the formation. The drill string was pulled from the hole, with th e bit clearing the seafloor at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 July, marking the end of Hole U1602B.  

A total of 38 cores were collected from Hole U1602B using the APC and HLAPC, with $262.37\,\mathrm{m}$ o f core recovered over a $251.1\,\textrm{m}$ interval $(104\%)$ . Temperature measurements using the thirdgeneration advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool were collected on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H.  

# 4.3.2.3. Hole U1602C  

Following Hole U1602B, the vessel was offset $20\textrm{m}$ to the north. Hole U1602C $(61^{\circ}11.7253^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $38^{\circ}10.8193^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) was spudded at $1920~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 July. Core 1H recovered $7.07\textrm{m}$ of core, placing th e seafloor at 2710.0 mbsl. Cores $1\mathrm{H-20H}$ ( $0{-}180.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF) were recovered. Within this cored interval, an interval of $2~\mathrm{m}$ was drilled without recovery ( $64.0{-}66.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF; Core 81) to offset corin g gaps for stratigraphic correlation. The HLAPC was deployed for Cores 21F–39F $180.0{-}269.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF). Piston coring refusal was reached at $269.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF and the hole was ended. The drill pipe wa s pulled out of the hole and the bit cleared the seafloor at $0525\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 July, ending Hole U1602C.  A total of 38 cores were recovered from Hole U1602C, with $272.63\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment recovered from  a $267.3\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval $102\%$ recovery).  

# 4.3.2.4. Hole U1602D  

The vessel was offset $20\ \mathrm{~m~}$ to the east of Hole U1602C. Hole U1602D $(61^{\circ}11.7259^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $38^{\circ}10.7967^{\prime}\mathrm{W};2709.1\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ was spudded at $0805~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 July. Cores 1H–19H advanced from 0 t o $175.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. APC refusal was reached at $175.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and the HLAPC was deployed for Core s 20F–37F and advanced to $260.4\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The XCB system was used to cut Cores 38X–66X (260.4– $540.7\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{DSF}$ ). The cutting of Core 66X was very slow compared to the other XCB cores. When th e core barrel was retrieved it was immediately noticed that the XCB cutting shoe was severely damaged, with large pieces missing. Coring could not continue because the location of the broke n metal from the cutting shoe was not known, and therefore Hole U1602D was terminated at 540. 7 m DSF. The drill string was pulled from the hole with the bit clearing the seafloor at $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 1 July. The vessel was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1602D and the drill pipe and BHA continued to b e pulled up to the rig. At $1645\,\mathrm{h}$ , the bit cleared the rig floor ending Hole U1602D. A total of 450.4 5 m of sediment was recovered from a $540.7\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval $(83\%)$ at Hole U1602D.  

# 4.3.2.5. Hole U1602E  

The drill string with an RCB BHA and C-4 drill bit was deployed to the seafloor and Hole U1602 E $(61^{\circ}11.7150^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $38^{\circ}10.7961^{\prime}\mathrm{W}_{J}$ ) was spudded at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 July. A seafloor depth of $2709.2\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ was used based upon the offset of Hole U1602B, which recovered the best-preserved mudlin e core. Hole U1602E was advanced without recovery to $529.3\textrm{m}$ DSF, the center bit was retrieved, and rotary coring began. Cores 2R–88R $(529.3{-}1365.2\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF})$ ) were recovered. Because of expedition time constraints, coring at Hole U1602E was terminated following the recovery of Core 88 R and the rig floor began to prepare for downhole wireline logging operations.  

The hole was cleaned with 40 bbl of high-viscosity mud. After releasing the RCB bit at the botto m of the hole, the drill pipe was pulled up to $77.8~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. At $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 July, the triple combo wa s deployed, and the tools run to a maximum depth of $1270\mathrm{~m~WSF},$ at which point the tool strin g was unable to descend farther into the hole. The calipers were opened for the first pass up the hol e and the tool string immediately became stuck. The calipers were closed but the tool remaine d trapped in the hole. The Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS) on the triple comb o contains a $^{137}\!\!\subset\!\!\mathbf{S}$ radioactive source, making it necessary to recover the tool string.  

After attempting to free the tool for over an hour, the wireline cable was cut at the surface an d connected to the core winch line to pull on the line with more force. The tool string was briefl y freed and ascended $160\;\mathrm{m}$ before getting stuck again. The decision was made to run the drill pip e back down the hole and to move the drill pipe over and around the stuck tool string. After som e complications, at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ the end of the pipe reached the triple combo tool string at $1079\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The drill pipe was maneuvered around the tool sting, which was then pulled into the pipe. Th e tools arrived at the rig floor at $1645\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill string was pulled from the hole with the end of th e pipe clearing the seafloor at $2135\,\mathrm{h}$ . At $0345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 July, the end of the pipe cleared the rig floor. The drill floor was secured for transit and the vessel was put into cruise mode at $0409\,\mathrm{h}$ , markin g the end of Site U1602.  

A total of 87 RCB cores collected $450.39\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment from an $835.9\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval $(54\%)$ a t Hole U1602E. A $529.3\;\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval was recorded for the hole.  

# 4.3.3. Principal results  

# 4.3.3.1. Sedimentology  

The Holocene to upper Eocene/lower Oligocene sediments cored at Site U1602 are primaril y composed of silty clay, silty clay/claystone with nannofossils, nannofossil silty clay/claystone, nannofossil chalk, and sandstone (Figure F13). Based on the observations of sediment compositio n along with attenuation patterns of NGR, MS, and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content, Site U1602 is divided into thre e major lithostratigraphic units (I–III). Unit III consists of two subunits (IIIA and IIIB). The site i s dominated by terrigenous components, mainly quartz, feldspar, glass, opaque grains, pyrite, an d glauconite with smaller amounts of chlorite and Fe/Mn oxides (Figure F14). Biogenic component s are dominated by nannofossils, which generally increase downhole. Foraminifers and biosilica ar e common to rare in Unit I and trace to absent in Units II and III. Sediments at the site contain  a wide variety of sedimentary structures such as laminations, graded bedding, alternating grading, crossbedding, flaser bedding, mud drapes, and sand injections. Fractures with slickensides are als o present in Units II and III. Bioturbation is generally sparse to moderate in Units I and II. In Uni t III, however, bioturbation is generally abundant in the chalk, but absent to sparse in the sandston e intervals.  

# 4.3.3.2. Micropaleontology  

At Site U1602, a $1357.99\mathrm{~m~}$ interval of upper Eocene to lower Oligocene to upper Pleistocen e material was recovered across multiple holes. Micropaleontological analyses were undertaken o n sediment samples from Holes U1602B $\left(0{-}251.43\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ CSF-A), U1602C (255.43–264.9 m CSF-A), U1602D (250.31–532.36 m CSF-A), and U1602E (537.07–1357.99 m CSF-A). Biohorizons used i n the age model are based on calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and one bolbofor m species.  

Calcareous nannofossils are present in most samples and have variable preservation, which generally worsens with depth below seafloor. A distinct interval where barren samples are more frequent occurs in the Pliocene to early Pleistocene. Seven biohorizons spanning the Pleistocen e were identified in Hole U1602B, covering an interval between 0.09 to $1.71\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . The top of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus, found in Hole U1602D, was the only recorded Pliocene biohorizon . The Miocene was well resolved in Hole U1602E, with fourteen biohorizons covering the interva l between 5.53 and $22.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Finally, the top of Reticulofenestra umbilicus, found in the deepes t recovered core catcher sample from Hole U1602E, indicates an early Oligocene $\mathbf{\Psi}(>32\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ age fo r the base of this hole.  

Planktonic foraminifers also demonstrate variable preservation (Figure F15) that worsens wit h depth, as well as highly variable abundance. Sample processing became more difficult as sediments became progressively lithified with depth (below ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). Despite the difficultie s in sample preparation, relatively good biostratigraphic control was achieved across the studie d interval. A total of three Pleistocene, four Miocene, and one late Eocene planktonic foraminife r biohorizons were identified across the studied holes. Finally, bolboforms were rare and mostl y moderately-to-poorly  preserved.  Despite  that  shortcoming,  one  Miocene  biohorizon  wa s recorded in Hole U1602E, using the Top occurrence of Bolboforma metzmacheri.

# 4.3.3.3. Physical properties  

Physical property measurements for Site U1602 consist of whole-round and half-round measurements on cores from Holes U1602A–U1602E, including X-ray scan imagery of section halves (Figure F16). Discrete physical property measurements were measured from Holes U1602B, U1602D, and U1602E. Density increases with depth and has marked increases at ${\sim}350$ and ${\sim}1050\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.

Density values measured on discrete samples are consistently higher than whole-round densit y values below ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, a discrepancy due to the diameter of the core being smaller than tha t of the liner. Porosity shows the inverse trend of density, with values decreasing with depth an d marked decreases occurring at ${\sim}350$ and ${\sim}1050\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Whole- and half-round MS measurements covary, showing meter to decameter-scale fluctuations from the top of the section unti l ${\sim}1050\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A where more variability is observed. $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ increases sharply from 350 to $650\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA and increase at a more gentle rate to $950\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , after which their measurements show  a wider range of values. NGR measurements show an increase from 300 to $400\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and fluctuate downhole to ${\sim}950~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, followed by an overall decrease and reduced range in values. Red, Green, Blue, $L^{\ast}$ , and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ show meter to decameter-scale variations between 0 and $1050\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF}}.$ - A. Thermal conductivity of the measured sediments at Site U1602 increases slightly with depth.  

# 4.3.3.4. Stratigraphic correlation  

A continuous stratigraphic splice was created from the seafloor to $169.45\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A. The continuous splice for the upper $169.45\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A includes cores from Holes U1602B and U1602D. Below this depth to ${\sim}270\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A, there are three small $(<\!1\!-\!2\,\,\mathrm m)$ gaps in the stratigraphi c record. At these intervals, cores were appended to the base of the overlying core.  

# 4.3.3.5. Paleomagnetism  

NRM was measured for all sedimentary cores recovered from Site U1602, at a resolution of $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ . The cores were then demagnetized with a stepwise alternating field cleaning protocol. A set o f $\mathord{\sim}260$ discrete samples were collected to confirm the semicontinuous measurements. The inclination measured at the maximum demagnetization step (20, 25, and $30~\mathrm{{mT}}$ from Holes U1602B, U1602D, and U1602E, respectively) was used to interpret a downcore sequence of normal an d reversed polarities. Magnetic polarities from Holes U1602D and U1602E were correlated with th e geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) chrons to establish an age-depth trend for Site U1602. Between about $1060~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and the bottom of the hole, the NRM intensity and MS decrease, and the paleomagnetic inclinations were not suitable for an univocal magnetostratigraphic interpretation.  

# 4.3.3.6. Geochemistry  

Cores taken from Holes U1602B, U1602C, U1602D, and U1602E were analyzed for headspace gas, IW chemistry, and bulk sediment geochemistry. Headspace methane concentrations range 0–32 8 ppmv $'n=143)$ ); low ethane concentrations $_{<4.6}$ ppmv) were detected in a subset of the headspac e samples $(n=21$ ). The $\mathsf{p H}$ and alkalinity of IW display an inverse relationship with depth. Alkalinit y is near seawater values $(3.68\;\mathrm{mM})$ in the uppermost IW sample (395-U1602A-1H-1, 141–151 cm ) and increases to $6.1\,\mathrm{\mM}$ at ${\sim}103\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Sample 395-U1602A-12H-2, 146–151cm) befor e decreasing to low values $(<\!1.0\,\mathrm{mM})$ below ${\sim}320\;\mathrm{m}$ (Sample 395-U1602D-44X-2, $123–130\,\mathrm{cm}$ ). p H is generally constant in the upper ${\sim}340\mathrm{~m~}$ $?.9\,\pm\,0.1)$ and increases downhole to 8.9 at ${\sim}786\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Sample 395-U1602E-28R-3, $119{-}131\ \mathrm{cm})$ ), below which limited IW extracted from th e sediment prevented additional $\mathsf{p H}$ measurements. IW calcium ion $(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+})$ concentrations displa y an increasing trend with depth; the highest $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ concentrations occur at ${\sim}871\mathrm{~m~}$ (395-U1602E37R-2, $103{-}108~\mathrm{cm}$ ). Magnesium ion $\left(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+}\right)$ concentrations display a general decreasing tren d with depth; highest $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ concentrations $(51.6\ \mathrm{mM})$ occur at top of the sediment column ( $\mathrm{^{1.4}~m}$ CSF-A; Sample 395-U1602B-1H-1, 141–151cm). Sulfate ion $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ concentrations display  a decreasing trend downhole and reach the minimum value ${\sim}240~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Sample 395-U1602B35F-2, $145{-}150\;\mathrm{cm}$ ). ${\mathrm{SO}}_{4}^{\ 2-}$ concentrations increase below ${\sim}600\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ to between 5 and $9\,\mathrm{mM}$ . Downhole trends in other dissolved elements including barium (Ba), lithium (Li), potassium (K), and silicon (Si) indicate a change in concentrations at around $388\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ weight percent generally increases downhole, from ${\sim}0$ to $30\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the top $100\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to as high as ${\sim}80$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ near the bottom of Hole U1602E (Sample 395-U1602E-60R-1, $3{-}4\,\mathsf{c m}$ ). Bulk sediment generally exhibits low TOC $({<}0.7\mathrm{\wt}\%)$ , TN $(<\!0.2\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ , and TS $(\lesssim1.0~\mathrm{wt\%})$ ). Bulk sediment major an d minor element concentrations were also analyzed using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on select samples. Downhole variations in major oxides (e.g., $\mathrm{SiO}_{2},$ $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ $\mathrm{{K}_{2}\mathrm{{O}_{:}}}$ $\mathrm{MgO}_{\cdot}$ , and ${\mathrm{CaO}}_{\prime}$ ) and trace elements (e.g., S and Sr) show variable concentration s that likely reflect changing lithologies.

# 4.3.3.7. Downhole logging  

After coring operations at Hole U1602E concluded, the hole was prepared for the logging operations. The triple combo tool string became stuck during its first decent downhole and operation s to recover the tool were successful, but all further logging operations at Site U1602 were canceled. Therefore, downhole logging data from Hole U1602E consists of a single downhole logging pas s that includes measurements of gamma log and spectral gamma ray, formation resistivity, and MS.  

Seven logging units are defined for Hole U1602E, the divisions of which are primarily defined b y notable changes in the gamma log, and in some instances from other logging responses. Loggin g Unit 1 (L1) $(32{-}162\mathrm{~m~WSF})$ ) is characterized by gamma log measurements of ${\sim}27.7$ gAPI, whic h fluctuate with depth. Increases in the gamma radiation positively correlates with increases in th e thorium and negatively correlates with uranium spectral gamma counts. Logging Unit 2 (L2 ) $'162–340\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ ) is defined by a step increase in gamma log to ${\sim}35$ gAPI. MS in Unit L2 has a n average measurement of 259 SI and contains meter scale fluctuations. The bottom of Unit L2, to p of Unit L3, is defined by an increase in formation resistivity. Logging Unit 3 (L3) (340–588 m WSF ) displays an average gamma log of ${\sim}47\ \mathrm{gAPI}$ and shows meter to decameter-scale fluctuation s throughout. Several distinct intervals present very low gamma radiation measurements whic h correspond to increases in MS. Logging Unit 4 (L4) ( $588{-}630\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF) is defined by a large ${\sim}42~\mathrm{m}$ long fluctuation in gamma log and MS measurements. Logging Unit 5 (L5) $(630{-}1039\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF})$ ) i s defined by an initial decrease in gamma log and an increase in MS and shows fluctuations i n gamma log at meter, decameter, and hectometer scales. Logging Unit 6 (L6) $(1039{-}1162\mathrm{~m~W~S~}$ F ) is characterized by variable logging responses separated into five subunits. Logging Unit 7 (1162– $1280\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ ) shows meter-scale, fluctuating, cyclical gamma log and MS responses. Below ${\sim}1250$ $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{~m~WSF}}$ , the values of MS increase; however, this could be a measurement artefact caused by deteriorating hole conditions and not a response to geological variation.  

Four downhole temperature measurements were acquired in Hole U1602B (between 33.7 and 11 6 m DSF). Formation temperature increases from $3.22^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $10.43^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ across this interval. These measurements, along with thermal conductivity, were used to calculate heat flow for the site.  

# 4.3.3.8. Age model  

The age model for Site U1602 is based on a combination of paleomagnetic and biostratigraphi c age determinations. Some of the biostratigraphic data are only upper or lower depth constraint s because rarity and/or variable preservation makes them difficult to locate precisely. There is goo d agreement between the paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic data sources to the base of Gilber t  

Chron C3r. Below that level, the paleomagnetic record continues to follow the expected reversa l sequence to the interpreted Base of Subchron C5n.2n (11.06 Ma). However, some of the biostratigraphic data appear to depart from this trend, most likely due to the poor calibration of thes e events in the high latitudes. The combined biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic record of Sit e U1602 in this interval will be critical in improving these calibrations in future. The age model i s based largely on calcareous nannofossils below this depth and assumes that Oligocene–Miocen e global age calibrations are accurate at this location. Planktonic foraminifers suggest that Hol e U1602E terminated in the upper Eocene $(>34.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , but that is based on a very poorly preserve d assemblage from just one sample near the bottom of the hole.  

# 4.4. Site U1564  

# 4.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1564 (proposed Site REYK-2A) is located in the North Atlantic Ocean on the eastern flan k of the Reykjanes Ridge, south of Iceland (Figure F1). Expeditions 384, 395C, and 395 sites comprise a crustal flow line transect across the eastern flank of Reykjanes Ridge. Four sites, U1554, U1555, U1562 and U1563 sampled two pairs of VSRs and VSTs that straddle the flanks of Reykjanes Ridge. Site U1564 is located on the same flow line, on crust with a segmented pattern tha t does not show evidence for VSRs or VSTs. The estimated basement age at Site U1564 is $32.4\;M{\bf a}$ based on magnetic anomalies and plate reconstructions. Basalt samples from this site will provid e a record with which to compare samples from VST/VSR pairs, which will provide constraints o n the formation of these crustal structures and on hydrothermal alteration of the crust with time.  

Site U1564 is also located on Gardar drift, one of the major contourite drifts in the North Atlantic, which has the potential to provide high-resolution, millennial-scale records for paleoceanographi c research. The sedimentation rate of this drift can serve as a proxy for deep water current strength, providing information on oceanic gateways and their potential ties to mantle plume pulses. OD P Site 983 was cored on Gardar drift, obtaining a sedimentary sequence back to ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (early Pleistocene). Cores at Site U1564 extend this record back to the Oligocene epoch.  

One main target for Site U1564 was to obtain basalt core from crust not showing traces o f VST/VSR structures. Another main target was to obtain a continuous sedimentary record of th e Gardar drift. Cores and data from this site will address all three of the primary science objectives: (1) crustal accretion and mantle behavior; (2) ocean circulation, gateways, and sedimentation; an d (3) time-dependent hydrothermal alteration of oceanic crust.  

The operational objectives for this site were to core the sedimentary section using the APC, XCB, and RCB systems, install a reentry system with casing to $600\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, use the RCB to core ${\sim}130\;\mathrm{m}$ into the basement, and use downhole wireline tools to log the borehole.  

# 4.4.2. Operations  

# 4.4.2.1. Expeditions 395C and 395  

# 4.4.2.1.1. Site U1564  

Site U1564 (proposed Site REYK-2A) $(59^{\circ}51.0366^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $23^{\circ}15.9858^{\prime}\mathrm{W}]$ ) consisted of six holes drille d during Expeditions 395C and 395. These holes range $8.8–1169.7\;\mathrm{m}\;]$ DSF (Table T1). A total of 25 5 cores were recorded for Site U1564. These cores collected $1881.5\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment and $114.2~\mathrm{m}$ o f basalt over a $2155.1\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval $93\%$ recovery).  

The APC system was used to collect 65 cores over a $609.0~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $636.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $104\%$ core recovery). The HLAPC was deployed for 24 cores and recovered $117.76\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment from a $112.8\;\mathrm{m}$ interval $(104\%)$ . The XCB system was deployed over a $861.6\;\mathrm{m}$ long interval. The 51 XCB cores recovered $807.67\mathrm{~m}$ of sediment $(94\%)$ . The RCB system was deployed for 7 5 cores and recovered $434.15\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and basalt across a $571.7~\mathrm{m}$ interval $(76\%)$ . Downhol e wireline logging operations using the triple combo tool string, FMS-sonic, and UBI took place a t Holes U1564C and U1564F.  

The total time spent at Site U1564 was 21.69 days across Expeditions 395C and 395.  

# 4.4.2.2. Expedition 395C  

# 4.4.2.2.1. Hole U1564A  

The vessel arrived at Site U1564 at $1748\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 July 2021. The thrusters were lowered, the shi p entered DP mode, and the drill string was made up with an APC/XCB BHA. The drill string wa s run to $2220.0\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ to spud Hole U1564A $\langle59^{\circ}51.0377^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $23^{\circ}16.0071^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ), ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ west of the sit e coordinates. The exact site coordinates were to be reserved for future reentry system and casin g installation during Expedition 395. Hole U1564A was initiated at $0245~\mathrm{h}$ on 31 July and Core 1 H recovered a full core $\left(9.89\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , prohibiting the establishment of the seafloor depth.  

# 4.4.2.2.2. Hole U1564B  

The ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to the east—unintentionally locating the ship directly over the site coordinates—and Hole U1564B $\mathrm{^{59^{\circ}51.0372^{\prime}N}}$ , $23^{\circ}15.9868^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) was spudded at $0342\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 July. Cor e 1H recovered $7.22~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, placing the seafloor at 2207.9 mbsl. Coring continued throug h Core 3H when the error in the ship’s offset was noted and operations at Hole U1564B were terminated. The bit cleared the seafloor at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1564B. A total of $26.81\;\mathrm{m}$ of core wa s collected over a $26.2\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval ( $102\%$ recovery).  

# 4.4.2.2.3. Hole U1564C  

The ship was offset $20\ \mathrm{~m~}$ west, over the Hole U1564A coordinates, and Hole U1564 C $(59^{\circ}51.0374^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , $23^{\circ}16.0087^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) was spudded at $0707~\mathrm{h}$ on 31 July. The seafloor depth was calculated at $2208.1~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , based on the recovery of Core 1H $(7.02\textrm{m})$ . Coring continued with th e APC system recovering Cores 2H–17H $?.0{-}159.0\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF). APC refusal was reached and Core s 18F–35F advanced from 159.0 to $243.6\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Cores 36X–75X were collected to $628.9\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF. Following Core 75X, the crew began pulling up the drill string in preparation for downhole loggin g operations using the triple combo tool.  

The drill pipe was raised until the bit was at $80.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The triple combo logging tool string wa s made up and at $0250~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 August the tool string was deployed. The triple combo made tw o passes of the borehole, was recovered at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ , and broken down. The FMS-sonic tool string wa s made up, deployed to the base of the hole, and made a single pass imaging the borehole wall. Th e downhole logging equipment was put away and the logging tools moved to the helideck. The ri g floor crew began pulling up the pipe, with the bit clearing the seafloor at $1845~\mathrm{h}$ . At $0106\,\mathrm{h}$ on  5 August the ship switched from DP mode to Bridge control, ending Site U1564. The ship began th e $293{\mathrm{~nmi}}$ transit to Reykjavík, Iceland. In all, $618.71\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered from Hole U1564 C $(98.4\%)$ .  

# 4.4.2.3. Expedition 395  

# 4.4.2.3.1. Hole U1564D  

Following a 1349.5 nmi voyage from Ponta Delgada, Portugal, at an average speed of 11.2 knots, the vessel arrived on site at $1424~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 June 2023. The thrusters were lowered and secured a t $1456~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 June and the ship was fully in DP mode at $1502~\mathrm{h}$ . Hole U1564D $(59^{\circ}51.0483^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $23^{\circ}16.0080^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; 2208.2 mbsl) was spudded at $0500\,\mathrm{h}\,22$ June with the first core on deck at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Piston coring using the APC advanced from Core 395-U1564D-1H through 22H (0–209.0 m DSF), with $218.87\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered $(105\%)$ . APC refusal was reached at Core $22\mathrm{H}$ , which was drille d over with the drill bit to recover the core barrel. The HLAPC system was deployed for Cores $23\mathrm{F-}$ 29F $(209.0{-}239.2\mathrm{~m~}]$ DSF). The stratigraphic correlators requested a $2~\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval (26-1), from 223.2 to $225.2\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, to offset coring gaps to assist with stratigraphic correlation. The XC B using a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit and cutting shoe was deployed. Coring wit h the XCB system continued with Cores 30X–74X ( $239.2–657.3\mathrm{~m}$ DSF). The rate of penetratio n slowed and recovery in the final three cores (72X–74X) was lower than the rest of the hole $(33\%)$ due to the water jets in the cutting shoe getting clogged with sediment. The hole was terminated a t a final depth of $657.3\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. A total of 73 cores were collected in Hole U1564D over a $655.3\mathrm{~m~}$ interval and recovered $632.42\;\mathrm{m}$ of core $(97\%)$ .  

The drill pipe was pulled out of the hole, with the bit clearing the seafloor at $2015~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 Jun e 2023, ending Hole U1564D. In all, $632.42\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered from Hole U1564D $(97\%)$ .  

# 4.4.2.3.2. Hole U1564E  

The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east and Hole U1564E $(59^{\circ}51.0485^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $23^{\circ}15.9876^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ was spudded a t $2306\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 June. Core 1H recovered a $5.8\,\mathrm{m}$ mudline core, establishing a seafloor depth of 2207. 3 mbsl. Coring continued from 5.8 to $205.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF with Cores 1H–22H. Cores 23X–28X extende d the hole to $263.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Following Core $28\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , the decision was made to end the hole. A total o f $273.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was recovered from the $263.5\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval at Hole U1564E $(104\%)$ .  

At $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 June, the drill bit cleared the seafloor and at $0545\,\mathrm{h}$ the bit cleared the rig floor. A t $0640\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the ship was secured for transit. The thrusters were raised and the transit to Site U155 4 began at $0700~\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1564E. In all, $273.7\textrm{m}$ of core was recovered from Hole U1564 E $(104\%)$ .  

# 4.4.2.3.3. Hole U1564F  

The vessel completed the $448\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1602 to Site U1564 at $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 July. Th e thrusters were lowered and the ship was put into DP mode at $2106\,\mathrm{h}$ , resuming operations at Sit e U1564.  

The rig crew made up the hydraulic release tool casing running stand. The weather was forecast t o deteriorate throughout the day with ${\sim}5\textrm{m}$ heave, preventing the assembly of the casing and reentry system. The vessel began waiting on weather at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 July.  

At $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 July the Icelandic Coast Guard offshore patrol vessel, Þór (Thor), arrived to delive r the Schlumberger severing devices and other supplies. After waiting nearly $2~\mathrm{{h}}$ , the transfer wa s postponed due to weather. Thor returned the next day at $0823\,\mathrm{h}$ for the transfer of severing tools, supplies, and fresh produce. Thor pulled alongside the vessel and the portside aft crane was use d to transfer six pallets onto the helideck starting at $0902\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . By $0919\,\mathrm{h}$ , the transfer was complete, and Thor departed at $0925\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The rig crew began preparing for the casing installation operations on 27 July immediately following the departure of Thor. The casing and reentry system was assembled. At $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 July, th e moonpool doors were opened and the reentry system was lowered below the ship. The rig cre w began making up the drill string to $2180\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ . The subsea camera system, along with Niskin wate r samplers and the CTD tool, were deployed at $1730~\mathrm{h}$ . The top drive was picked up and the bi t spaced out to initiate Hole U1564F at $2125\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 July. The casing string was drilled to $550\,\mathrm{m}$ DS F and the bit advanced to $553.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The go-devil was pumped down the pipe to release the casing stinger from the reentry system. The VIT camera system was retrieved, and the drill string wa s pulled to surface. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1440\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 July and the rig floor at $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

After breaking down the reentry equipment, the RCB BHA was made up with a C-4 drill bit. Th e drill pipe was run to $1598.7\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ . The VIT camera system, with the CTD recorder and two Niski n bottles attached, were deployed through the moonpool at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 July. The drill string continued to be lowered to several meters above the seafloor. The reentry cone for Hole U1564F wa s found and the bit reentered the hole at $1052\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 July. The subsea camera was recovered whil e the drill string was lowered to the base of the hole and the top drive was picked up. The center bi t was deployed, and the hole was conditioned with $20~\mathrm{bbl}$ of high-viscosity mud. The hole wa s advanced without recovery from 553.4 to $598.0~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The center bit was retrieved and an RC B core barrel deployed.  

Cores 395-U1564F-2R through 43R (598.0–995.8 m DSF) were recovered and Core 4R had n o recovery.  

The basaltic basement was reached at ${\sim}997.2\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF in Core 395-U1564F-44R. This core recovered $7.03\:\mathrm{m}$ of material $(74\%)$ , including $1.43\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and the remainder basalt. Coring continued with Cores 45R–49R (1005.3–1039.2 m DSF). Beginning with Core 46R, all cores were hal f advances (4.7 or $5.0\;\mathrm{m}$ ), except for Core 48R.  

Following Core 395-U1564F-49R, the drill bit had reached 59.7 rotating hours and the drill strin g was pulled out of the hole to change the bit. At $1640\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 August the bit cleared the seafloor, an d the vessel was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1564F. At $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ the bit cleared the rig floor. The drill pip e and BHA were run from the ship to near the seafloor for reentry into Hole U1564F. At 0315 h on  5  

August the VIT camera was deployed to guide the hole reentry. The bit was spaced out and, afte r nearly $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of searching for the reentry cone, the bit entered Hole U1564F at $0725\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill pip e was run in the hole and the subsea camera retrieved. At $1115\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{m}}$ , coring resumed.  

Cores 395-U1564F-50R through 76R (1039.2–1169.7 m DSF) were retrieved. Hole U1564F wa s terminated at a final depth of $1169.7\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. A total of $434.15\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered from a 571. 7 m interval $(76\%)$ from Hole U1564F. The recovery in the basement section was high $(66\%)$ wit h $114.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of core recovered over $172.4\;\mathrm{m}$ . Two drilled intervals, totaling $598.0\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , were recorded.  

Following the completion of coring operations, the hole was cleaned with a mud sweep. The dril l pipe was pulled out of the hole. At $0215\ \mathrm{h}$ on 9 August, the subsea camera was deployed an d descended to near the seafloor. The bit cleared the seafloor at $0325\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the vessel was offset 2 0 m from Hole U1564F. The mechanical bit release sleeve was activated, and the drill bit fell to th e seafloor. The end of the drill pipe reentered Hole U1564F at $0625\,\mathrm{h}$ . The end of the pipe was positioned at $59.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF in the casing string for logging operations.  

The triple combo tool string was rigged up and deployed to the base of the hole (1169.7 m DSF). On the upwards pass, the Accelerator Porosity Sonde (APS) malfunctioned and porosity measurements were not collected. Following a complete pass of the hole, the triple combo was pulled to th e rig floor and broken down. The FMS-sonic was made up and deployed in the hole. On the downward pass, the Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) malfunctioned and was not used. Two passes of th e borehole were successfully made with the FMS-sonic tool string. The UBI was run to $1164.7\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, $5\;\mathrm{m}$ above the base of the hole. The basement section was first logged at high resolution t o test the image quality and because there was enough time in the program. The UBI was then lowered back to $1164.7\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WSF}$ and the entire hole was logged at a lower resolution scan. The rig cre w pulled the drill pipe out of the hole, with the bit clearing the seafloor at $1525\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 August. Th e BHA was broken down and the end of the pipe reached the rig floor at $2130~\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel wa s secured for transit and at $2206~\mathrm{h}$ the vessel was switched from DP to cruise mode, ending Sit e U1564. The thrusters were raised the vessel began the $293\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Reykjavík at $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 0 August.  

# 4.4.2.3.4. Transit and end of Expedition 395  

Following a $293\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit, the vessel reached the pilot station and the pilot boarded at $0705\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 12 August. JOIDES Resolution came into Skarfabakki Harbour in Reykjavík, Iceland. The first lin e ashore at Vatnagardsbakki Berth was at $0812\,\mathrm{h}$ , marking the end of Expedition 395.  

# 4.4.3. Principal results  

# 4.4.3.1. Sedimentology  

The Holocene to lower Oligocene sediments cored at Site U1564 are primarily composed of silt y clay, silty clay/claystone with nannofossils, nannofossil silty clay/claystone and nannofossil chal k with silty clay (Figure F17). Based primarily on lithologic observations and sediment composition, alongside NGR and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ measurements, Site U1564 is divided into two major lithostratigraphic, Units I and II. Each Unit is further divided into three subunits.  

In Unit I, Subunit IA is dominated by gray silty clay, with a variable but generally minor biogeni c component. The biogenic component is dominated by nannofossils, and foraminifers and siliceous microfossils are also observed. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ weight percent is variable in this subunit. Severa l prominent glass layers are present, dark green banding is observed throughout, and some shar p contacts are observed intermittently. Subunit IB is similarly dominated by gray silty clay and silt y clay with biogenics. In addition to thin glass layers and intermittent sharp contacts, pyritization o f burrows and halos around burrows are observed. Subunit IC is dominated by dark gray silty clay; this subunit contains the least biogenic carbonate of all units in Site U1564 (supported by smea r slide analysis and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ weight percent).  

Unit II is marked by an increase in carbonate content and a transition to nannofossil chalk wit h silty clay. In this unit glass layers, sharp contacts and dark banding continue to be present. Fractures with slickensides and/or calcite veins, and soft sediment deformation features are als o observed (Figure F18). Subunit IIA is dominated by dark gray silty clay with nannofossils interbedded with nannofossil chalk. There is a significant increase in the variability of both biogeni c carbonate and $C a C O_{3}$ weight percent, coinciding with cyclical color grading of sediment beds. Subunit IIB is dominated by greenish gray nannofossil chalk and dark gray silty nannofossil chalk. Subunit IIC is dominated by gray nannofossil chalk with silty clay, with some intervals of silt y nannofossil chalk. Near the base of the sedimentary sequence, red and pink nannofossil chalk s become interbedded. Evidence for hydrothermal mineralization is observed.  

# 4.4.3.2. Igneous petrology  

Site U1564 recovered the oldest oceanic crust drilled during this expedition ${\bf\left\langle{\sim}32.3\ M a\right\rangle}$ . Sit e U1564 is located in faulted abyssal hill topography that formed when the ridge axis was segmente d by a series of transform offsets. The sediment/basement interface was encountered at 997 mbsf. Basement was drilled to $1170\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ at Hole U1564F, penetrating $172.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt, of whic h $114.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered $(66\%)$ . The bulk of this core consists of continuous sheet flows tha t are moderately to highly altered, with sparsely plagioclase phyric basalt and occasional clinopyroxene microphenocrysts. The fine- to medium-grained groundmass consists of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and opaque minerals. A $4\;\mathrm{m}$ thick dusky red sediment layer was encountered at ${\sim}1050\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. In the bottom ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of the cored section, pillow lavas become more abundant, wit h chilled margins and occasional glassy rinds. Filled fractures and complex anastomosing veins ar e common throughout the hole.

# 4.4.3.3. Alteration petrology  

The majority of basalt core recovered from Site U1564 is completely or highly altered. Alteration i s dominantly pervasive though localized alteration mainly in the form of fracture halos occur s throughout the basalts. Alteration intensity is observed to be slightly higher in sheet flows than i n pillow lavas. The basalt alteration assemblage is Fe-oxide/oxyhydroxides $^+$ celadonite $^+$ clay wit h minor, localized chlorite (Figure F19). Vesicles are dominantly filled with celadonite, calcite, Feoxide/oxyhydroxides, some saponite and minor zeolite. Vesicle fills are commonly mineralogicall y zoned with multiple minerals in each. Fracture density in Hole U1564F is ${\sim}23$ fractures per mete r and increases gradually with depth. Fractures are dominantly ${<}1\,\;\mathrm{mm}$ wide and occur mostl y within complex crosscutting networks. Fractures up to $3.4~\mathrm{{cm}}$ wide are more common in th e upper intervals of basalt. Fracture mineral fills are dominantly carbonate $\pm$ Fe-oxide/oxyhydroxid e $\pm$ celadonite with minor clay. Chlorite fracture fill occurs in specific intervals and quartz is sporadically observed as a late fill in some mineralogically layered fractures. Fracture alteration halos ca n be $>\!15\;\mathrm{cm}$ wide, and are red, brown, green-gray, to green-brown in color.

# 4.4.3.4. Micropaleontology  

At Site U1564, a $997.23\;\mathrm{m}$ long interval of lower Oligocene to upper Pleistocene sediments wer e recovered across multiple holes. Planktonic foraminifers are common to dominant in most samples examined except where quartz grains and rock fragments predominate and their preservatio n is very good to excellent to ${\sim}530~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Below that level the sediment becomes progressivel y more lithified and the foraminifers are mostly infilled by calcite, although they continue havin g moderate to good preservation up to ${\sim}800\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . Seven early Pliocene to Pleistocene biohorizons, three Miocene biohorizons, and two Oligocene biohorizons were recorded. The last sampl e of the regular succession above basement has an assemblage that indicates an early Oligocene ag e $(32.2–27.29\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , and the assemblage in the sedimentary layer recovered between the basemen t succession points to an age between 33.8 and $32.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Similar to the planktonic foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils are present in almost all sample s observed, ranging from few to dominant in abundance and with very good to poor preservation. Preservation worsens with depth in the succession. Ten Pleistocene biohorizons were identified, only one Pliocene biohorizon, and eleven Miocene biohorizons spanning the interval between 5.5 3 and $17.65\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Oligocene assemblages are present below ${\sim}920\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, characterized by th e presence of Cyclicargolithus abisectus, with the lower Oligocene biohorizon Top $R$ . umbilicus a t ${\sim}987\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A constraining the base of the sedimentary succession to be older than $32.02\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# 4.4.3.5. Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements for Site U1564 consist of whole-round and half-round measurements on cores from Holes U1564B through U1564F. Discrete physical property measurements were measured from Holes U1564D, U1564E and U1564F. Whole-round densit y measurements show an increase with depth with marked increases at ${\sim}550$ , ${\sim}700\;\mathrm{m}$ and ${\sim}1000\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (the sediment/basement interface). Density measured on discrete samples is consistentl y higher than those measured on whole-round sections, below ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Whole-round an d point MS measurements covary, showing meter to decameter-scale fluctuations throughout th e sedimentary section. Below $700\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, MS drops dramatically to values below 10 IU. $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ fro m whole-round measurements increases between 450 and $650\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , below which the measurements were constrained to caliper measurements due to the diameter of the RCB core not fillin g the core liner. Below $650\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in the sediment interval, velocities increase from 2200 to 300 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ . Caliper-derived velocities in the basalts were measured on the orthogonal direction using th e paleomagnetic cubes; these velocities vary between 3600 and $6000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . NGR measurements sho w an increase between 600 and $700~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and then fluctuates between 700 to ${\sim}1000\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. NGR is generally lower in the basaltic record. RGB $L^{*}$ , and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ show meter to decameter scale variations with depth between 0 and $450\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, below which the data display higher amplitud e variability. RGB measurements have lower values in the basaltic records, averaging around $50.\,\mathrm{L^{*}}$ shows lower values in the basalts, averaging around 40, and $L^{*}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ display a similar range o f values to the sediment intervals.  

# 4.4.3.6. Stratigraphic correlation  

The stratigraphic splice for Site U1564 contains two long uninterrupted intervals that are complete, with a ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long interval in between that has several gaps. In Cores 395-U1564E-1 H through 23X, a continuous splice was constructed using only Holes 395-U1564D and 395-U1564 E to $239\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ . The lowermost, continuous part of the Site U1564 shipboard splice was constructed using material from Holes 395C-U1564C and 395-U1564D to 674.71 m CCSF-A. Between these intervals, several gaps are unavoidable and cores from Holes 395C-U1564C, 395- U1564D and 395-U1564E were positioned to our best judgement, with additional guidance fro m the downhole wireline MS logging profile from Hole 395C-U1564C.  

# 4.4.3.7. Paleomagnetism  

NRM was measured for sedimentary cores recovered from Holes U1564A, U1564B, U1564C, U1564D, U1564E and U1564F. The cores from Holes U1564B, U1564C, and U1564E were the n demagnetized with a stepwise alternating field cleaning protocol with a resolution of $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ , an d Holes U1564A, U1564D, and U1564F with a resolution of $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ . A set of about 150 discret e samples were collected to confirm the semicontinuous measurements. The inclinations measure d at the demagnetization step of $20~\mathrm{mT}$ from Holes U1564D and U1564F were used to interpret  a downcore sequence of normal and reversed polarities. Cores 395-U1564F-10R through 30R of th e half-core measurements and for all the discrete samples we used in the principal componen t analysis for interpreting the paleomagnetic signal. The change in lithology below about $750\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A corresponds to a decrease of the NRM intensity and the magnetic susceptibly, togethe r with the deterioration quality of the paleomagnetic signal. Below $997\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, the sediment/roc k interface between Sections 395-U1564F-44R-1A and 44R-2A, marks a three-fold increase in th e intensity of the NRM, of the MS but the alteration of the basement rocks causes a deterioration o f the paleomagnetic signal. Hence, between about $760\textrm{m}$ CSF-A and the bottom of the hole th e paleomagnetic inclinations were not suitable for an univocal magnetostratigraphic interpretation. Magnetic polarities from Holes U1564D and U1564F were correlated with the GPTS chrons t o establish an age-depth trend for Site U1564.  

# 4.4.3.8. Geochemistry  

Cores collected from Site U1564 were analyzed for headspace gas, IW chemistry, and bulk sediment geochemistry. Headspace gas analyses were conducted at Holes U1564A, U1564B, U1564C, U1564D, and U1564F; methane concentrations are variable and range ${\sim}0{-}1260$ ppmv. Ethane, a t concentrations lower than 94.6 ppmv, was present in Holes U1564C, U1564D, and U1564F belo w $510.31\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

Material from Holes U1564D, U1564E, and U1564F was analyzed for IW chemistry and bul k sediment geochemistry. Calcium ion $(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+})$ concentrations generally increase, and magnesiu m ion $(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+})$ concentrations decrease with depth. Sulfate ion $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ concentrations decrease fro m seawater-like values at the top of the sediment column ${<}1\ \mathrm{mM}$ at $173.87\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, with a smal l increase in concentration below $607.12\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. $C a C O_{3}$ weight percent generally increase s downcore, trending from an average of $13.3\pm9.6\%$ through Sample 395-U1564D-52X-2, 141–15 1 cm (442.31 m CSF-A), to an average of $35.4\,\pm\,20.6\%$ for the remaining sediment samples to th e sediment/basement interface. Bulk sediment generally had low TOC, TN, and TS content.  

# 4.4.3.9. Downhole logging  

After coring operations concluded at Holes 395C-U1564C and 395-U1564F, the holes wer e cleaned with a mud sweep and the drilling mud displaced with seawater before logging operation s started. Hole 395C-U1564C was logged with the triple combo and the FMS-sonic tool string s from the seafloor to ${\sim}630\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. Hole 395-U1564F was logged from ${\sim}550$ to $1160\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ t o allow for some data overlap with Hole 395C-U1564C. For Site U1564, six logging units have bee n identified from first order variations in the wireline measurements, predominantly using observable changes in the gamma ray log, and in places using other logs such as resistivity, MS, and density. Logging Subunit 1a encompasses data collected through the drill pipe, and Logging Subuni t 1b records the open hole logging responses of Logging Unit 1. Logging Unit 1 is defined by gamm a log measurements of $19\pm3$ gAPI and densities ranging $1.2{-}1.6\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Logging Unit 2 (L2) (108– $318\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ ) is defined by an increase in gamma log to an average value around $21\pm3$ gAPI, spectral gamma ray that shows several large district peaks in thorium counts, and an increase in M S (average $=117\pm45\ \mathrm{SI}$ I), the latter of which increasingly fluctuates with depth. Logging Unit 3 i s marked by a decrease in gamma radiation, and gradually increasing $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ . This unit is divide d into two subunits based on changes in the frequency of fluctuations observed in the magnetic susceptibly. A large distinct peak in uranium radiation at ${\sim}529\mathrm{\;m\;WSF}$ is observed in Logging Subuni t 3b. Logging Unit 4 (L4) (560–957 m WSF) is marked by an increase gamma radiation, resistivity, MS, and density. This logging unit contains three subunits defined by variations in gamma radiation. Logging Unit 5 is marked by a large spike in gamma log as well as an increase in resistivity an d density. Logging Unit 6 marks the transition from sediment to basaltic basement which sees  a decrease in gamma log and thorium counts in the spectral gamma ray log, and large increases i n resistivity and density. FMS image logging of Hole U1564C is of good quality and alternating conductive and resistive bedding features can be observed. FMS and UBI image logging in the sediment and basement lithologies of Hole U1564F are also of good quality and show multipl e sedimentary and structural geology features.  

# 4.4.3.10. Age model  

The age model is based mainly on a combination of paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic age determinations from Holes U1564D and U1564F, with additional biostratigraphic constraints fro m  

Hole U1564C. Fourteen tie points were selected that divide the stratigraphy into a series of intervals characterized by significantly different estimated sedimentation. The age of the sediment i n the lowermost part of the regular succession above igneous basement is lower Oligocene (betwee n 32.02 and $32.20\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ). This finding is in good agreement with the age of basement anticipated fro m regional magnetic surveys at $32.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# 5. Preliminary scientific assessment  

The broad objective of Expedition 395 was to deliver the samples and data required to test a rang e of interdisciplinary scientific hypotheses about topics that include mantle convection and crusta l accretion, paleoclimate, ocean circulation, and the deep limits of life. The expedition focused on  a unique part of the North Atlantic Ocean where the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is strongly influenced b y the Iceland mantle plume and where rapidly accumulated drift sediments record changes in deepwater circulation currents and climate on millennial timescales. Considered together, Expedition s 384, 395C and 395 were designed to target six primary sites with a combination of crustal an d sedimentary sequences that were chosen to build on scientific breakthroughs from previous scientific drilling in the region, notably during DSDP Leg 49 and ODP Legs 105, 152, and 162.  

Expedition 395 was the third of the three expeditions in the overall project, following Expeditio n 384 in 2020 (Blum et al., 2020), and Expedition 395C in 2021 (Parnell-Turner et al., 2022). Expedition 395 had three initial operational goals. First, to recover a complete sedimentary sequence fo r Gardar drift, followed by coring through $130\mathrm{~m~}$ of the underlying 32 My old basaltic crust (Sit e U1564). Second, to complete coring and sampling of the sedimentary succession of Björn drift a t Sites U1554 and U1562, which were initially drilled during Expedition 395C, but without collecting a full stratigraphic splice and without a full set of ephemeral properties measurements. Third, time permitting, Expedition 395 aimed to recover a significant portion of the sedimentary sectio n of Eirik drift on the eastern margin of Greenland (Site U1602), with a tentative objective of reaching late Miocene sediments near $7.8\mathrm{~Ma}$ . As detailed below, all of these objectives were attaine d during Expedition 395, with the additional achievement of sampling extensive Paleogene and Neogene pre-drift sedimentary succession at Eirik drift (Site U1602) (Figure F20).

# 5.1. Operational achievements of Expedition 395  

Each of the initial operational objectives of Expedition 395 were met, and in many cases exceeded. Initially planned to recover ${\sim}3500\;\mathrm{m}$ of core, Expedition 395 achieved a total penetration of 442 9 m, recovering $3734.6~\mathrm{m}$ of core with an overall recovery rate of $84\%$ (Figure F21; Table T1). Thi s total includes $66\%$ recovery in the basalt section of Site U1564. The ephemeral properties measurements and microbiological sampling programs were remarkably successful during Expeditio n 395, collecting a total of 243 interstitial fluid samples to depths of up to $1050\;\mathrm{m}$ (achieved in Hol e U1564F). The 33 microbiological samples collected from the basement section of Site U1564, at  a spacing of ${\sim}5\;\mathrm{m}$ , represent one of the most complete records of their kind to date. The full planne d suite of wireline logging data was collected at Site U1564, and although a stuck tool ended loggin g operations early, a partial wireline logging data set was still collected at Site U1602.

# 5.1.1. Objective 1: crustal accretion and V-shaped ridge origins  

Basalt was drilled across the full planned interval at all five sites during Expeditions 384, 395C, an d 395, fully satisfying the needs for crustal sampling of Objective 1. Material from segmented crus t at Site U1564, potentially representing North Atlantic end-member crust not influenced by th e Iceland plume, was cored during Expedition 395, and the other four sites, representing VSRs an d VSTs, were drilled during Expeditions 384 and 395C. Expedition 395 succeeded in recovering 11 9 m of basaltic cores from the segmented, 32 My old oceanic crust which lies beneath Gardar drift a t Site U1564. Combined with the basement material successfully recovered at VSR/VST pair s during Expeditions 384 and 395C, these basalts will enable the hypotheses for the origin of VSRs, and the dynamic behavior of the Iceland mantle plume to be tested. The large amount of basemen t material recovered from the five sites reveal variability in lava morphology (e.g., pillows versu s sheet flows) between the sites, and preliminary shipboard geochemical analyses indicate differences in degrees of melting and/or variability in source composition. Postcruise geochemical measurements, lithologic analysis, and modeling will provide the foundations for evaluating existin g hypotheses, in addition to furthering the exploration of crustal accretion processes along the plat e spreading transect.  

The high basement recovery rate helped meet the objective to sample a representative number o f flow units from each site, minimizing possible sampling biases. Favorable weather and timin g enabled deeper basalt penetration than originally planned at Sites U1555 and U1564. This additional recovery was particularly valuable at Site U1564, where a significant amount of glassy material was recovered toward the base of the hole, deeper than the initially planned $130\;\mathrm{m}$ basemen t penetration target. In the otherwise highly altered basaltic section at Site U1564, this glass will b e invaluable for future geochemical analyses and will play a critical role in constraining mantl e source composition and melting processes at the Reykjanes Ridge 32 My ago. The paired basement sections recovered in Holes 384-U1555G and 395C-U1555I represent a petrological splic e through the basaltic basement, which leads to a rare opportunity to study both the spatial- an d depth-dependent properties of the oceanic crust. The core recovery is paired with extensiv e downhole logging data sets, including FMS-sonic logs and UBI data, which provide a $360^{\circ}$ view o f the borehole. These images are of exceptional quality, providing insight into the eruptive units, structural features, and alteration character of the basalt sequence.  

# 5.1.2. Objective 2: paleoclimate and deepwater circulation  

To satisfy the needs of the paleoclimate and ocean circulation objectives, the first order operational aim of Expedition 395 was to collect near-complete splices through key sedimentary intervals of Gardar, Björn, and Eirik drifts. Enabled by the excellent work of the shipboard drilling an d technical staff, complete splices throughout the APC-cored sections of each of these drifts wer e achieved. These splices include key climatic intervals such as the intensification of Norther n Hemisphere Glaciation at $2.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and the onset of contourite drift sedimentation. The shipboar d data already reveal new insights into changes in sedimentation, climate and ocean circulatio n during these important intervals. Enabled by the high-sedimentation rate material recovered, postcruise analysis of Expedition 395 cores and data will be able to address detailed question s about climatic and oceanographic history of the North Atlantic region.  

An important goal of Expedition 395 was to obtain high resolution records of sedimentation rat e in contourite drift sediments across a North Atlantic transect at the key $60^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ latitude. Expeditio n 395 sites were chosen to maximize the chance of success for this objective, located in undisturbed, rapidly deposited stratigraphy of Björn, Gardar and Eirik drifts. Continuous core recovery wit h near-continuous splices, well-resolved magnetostratigraphic records, and excellent microfossi l preservation and biohorizons, means that the age models generated by Expedition 395 are exceptional in quality. These well-constrained models considerably extend previous reference model s from ODP Sites 982 and 983, reaching from modern to Miocene (Björn drift), Oligocene (Garda r drift), and Eocene times (Eirik drift), and are important reference sections for the geologic histor y of the North Atlantic region. Importantly, Expedition 395 sites cored through the onset of sedimentation at major drifts in the North Atlantic Ocean, demonstrating the value of drilling site s with multiple holes across a transect.  

Favorable weather and operational efficiencies meant that additional, initially unplanned AP C coring was able to be carried out at Hole U1562C during Expedition 395. This site, located on th e eastern fringe of Björn drift, contains a remarkably well preserved late Miocene record, owing t o its relatively shallow burial depth. The additional APC hole enabled a continuous splice to b e obtained through this key interval and is likely to yield important insights into this important climatic interval.  

Operations during Expeditions 384 and 395C allowed the addition of Site U1602 to Expeditio n 395 (Parnell-Turner et al., 2023). Site U1602 recovered a unique record of sedimentation of Eiri k drift back to the late Eocene, with implications for the stability of Greenland ice sheet and th e evolution of the early North Atlantic Ocean by providing sedimentary records with standar d pelagic microplankton groups preserved through large intervals, as well as the potential for biomarker proxy data generation. This record from Eirik drift is particularly valuable given ODP Sit e 646 only recovered a partial record of the drift and termination of the drilling program in 2024, which means that further drilling at Eirik drift likely will not be realized for decades to come.  

Considered together, the excellent recovery and high-resolution magnetic recording potential o f sediments across the transect of six sites will lead to a significant contribution to our understanding of Earth’s magnetostratigraphic history. Although nearby ODP Sites 982 and 983 are referenc e sites for the fine-scale geomagnetic intensity timescale (GITS), the new material recovered fro m Expedition 395 will extend their records well beyond Quaternary times and beyond the Matuyam a polarity chron. Comparison between the multiple high-resolution magnetostratigraphic record s contained across Expedition 395 sites is likely to address existing uncertainty in the GITS, previously caused by reliance upon single sites.  

The transect of Expedition 395 sites, spanning the central North Atlantic and proximal to th e Greenland ice sheet, also is positioned to capture a continuous record of Pleistocene ice shee t dynamics. Combining the continuous recovery with novel shipboard X-ray images collecte d during Expedition 395 means that a detailed analysis of the pacing of IRD older than $1.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ i s likely possible. The recovery of laminated silt horizons on the Greenland margin at Site U1602 als o opens the unexpected possibility to track ice sheet behavior through the record of meltwate r pulses and grain provenance.  

# 5.1.3. Objective 3: crustal aging and hydrothermal alteration  

Altered basalt drilled at four sites up to $12.3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ in age during Expeditions 384 and 395C partiall y satisfied the needs for crustal sampling of Objective 3. However, the oldest crustal material, at Sit e U1564, was necessary to complete the 32 My transect as originally planned. The $119\;\mathrm{m}$ of basal t recovered during Expedition 395 at Site U1564 contains a rich variety of alteration fabrics, mineralogy, and structural features, that will enable the aims of Objective 3 to be satisfied. The successful acquisition of high-resolution $360^{\circ}$ borehole images at all five basement sites, means that a ful l evaluation of the structural evolution of the basaltic crust will be feasible postcruise. Finally, th e large number of microbiological samples collected across all sites will allow feedbacks betwee n crustal alteration, fluid flow, and microbial life to be investigated in unprecedented detail.  

The transect of sites east of the Reykjanes Ridge comprehensively sample the different controls a t play in determining the extent and timing of crustal alteration. The unexpected deep sedimen t recovery from Site U1602, which comprises lithified sediment containing fractures with variou s mineral fill, allows new questions about the connectivity between crust, sediment, and ocean to b e addressed.  

The IW and microbial samples collected in both sediment and basalt during Expedition 395 for m one of the most comprehensive collections of their kind ever obtained. Paired with a history o f alteration recorded by exceptionally high recovery rates, the combined results of the six-site Expedition 395 project transect opens up new opportunities to explore the links between petrology, chemical exchange, alteration mineralogy, and microbial life within and between the basement, sediment and ocean.  

The remarkable success of Expedition 395 was partly enabled by favorable weather conditions. More importantly, however, it was enabled by the well-established drilling and laboratory procedures aboard JOIDES Resolution, which have been refined and perfected over decades of operation. Our success also relied upon the dedication and expertise of the shipboard drilling an d technical staff, who bring with them decades of experience and knowledge. These technical, operational, and personnel resources will almost certainly be lost once JOIDES Resolution ceases t o operate, at great cost to future generations of scientists.  

# 6. Outreach  

Expedition 395 had one onboard Outreach Officer, a secondary science teacher from Massachusetts, USA. The shipboard outreach program included posting to social media platforms, including X (formerly known as Twitter), Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube; creating blog posts; an d communicating the science objectives during ship-to-shore broadcasts and for media inquiries. Finally, a classroom lesson focusing on biostratigraphy and glacial/interglacial periods was create d with the help of one of the paleontologists and will be made available to the public.  

# 6.1. Social media  

Three main social media platforms were used to disseminate of the science objectives as well a s information on the drilling process. 91 posts were made to Facebook. These garnered 231 Impressions, 3900 reactions with 149 comments, and 342 shares. While using the Facebook page, user s clicked content links 570 times. Sixty-eight new followers were obtained on this platform. On Instagram, a mixture of reels and stories were posted for a total of 117 posts. These posts receive d 115,000 impressions, 93 comments/replies, and 5600 likes/reactions. There were 188 new followers added to the Instagram account during this time. 290 X (formerly known as Twitter) post s were recorded with 632,000 impressions, 181 comments, 8900 reactions, and 1500 shares. Ther e were also 666 content link clicks on this platform. A total of 452 new X (formerly known as Twitter) followers were added to the $@$ TheJR profile during this time.  

A total of 13 blog posts were created, with topics including life on the JR, biostratigraphy, cor e curation, and drilling technology.  

# 6.2. Ship-to-shore events  

Twenty-five ship-to-shore events were held during Expedition 395. The Expedition 395 scientist s assisted with these tours and on four occasions hosted the tours in their native languages. In addition to these events, there were two virtual Open Houses held. All of these events combine d reached over 400,830 individuals from more than 15 different countries.  

The events were primarily for college and graduate students, but all audiences were reached. On e event was part of a lecture series for the PaleoPERCs program. Another event was part of a lunc h session for a UK-IODP meeting. Summer camps and summer enrichment programs for middl e school to high school students also attended these tours.  

# 6.3. Media  

One live broadcast interview was given by the Expedition Project Manager on Nebraska T V (NTV). The Outreach Officer aided in the creation of a media article for Marine Technolog y magazine and provided a Zoom tour for the journalist. Two articles for the monthly UK IOD P magazine were written and published (July and August 2023 editions).
