# Abstract  

The tectonic and paleoceanographic setting of the Great Australian Bight (GAB) and the Mentelle Basin (MB; adjacent to Naturaliste Plateau) offered an outstanding opportunity to investigat e Cretaceous and Cenozoic climate change and ocean dynamic s during the last phase of breakup among remnant Gondwana continents. Sediment recovered from sites in both regions during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 369 will provide  a new perspective on Earth’s temperature variation at sub-polar latitudes $(60^{\circ}{-}62^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ across the extremes of the mid-Cretaceous ho t greenhouse climate and the cooling that followed. The primar y goals of the expedition were to  

• Investigate the timing and causes for the rise and collapse of the Cretaceous hot greenhouse climate and how this climate mode affected the climate-ocean system and oceanic biota;   
• Determine the relative roles of productivity, ocean temperature, and ocean circulation at high southern latitudes during Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs);   
• Identify the main source regions for deep-water and intermediate-water masses in the southeast Indian Ocean and how these changed during Gondwana breakup;   
• Characterize how oceanographic conditions at the MB changed during the Cenozoic opening of the Tasman Passage and restriction of the Indonesian Gateway;   
• Resolve questions on the volcanic and sedimentary origins of the Australo-Antarctic Gulf and Mentelle Basin and provide stratigraphic control on the age and nature of the prebreakup successions.  

Hole U1512A in the GAB recovered a $691\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence o f black claystone ranging from the early Turonian to the early Campanian. Age control is primarily based on calcareous nannofossils, but the presence of other microfossil groups provided consisten t but low-resolution control. Despite the lithologic uniformity, long - and short-term variations in natural gamma ray and magnetic susceptibility intensities show cyclic alternations that suggest an orbita l control of sediment deposition that will be useful for developing a n astrochronology for the sequence.  

Sites U1513–U1516 were drilled between 850 and $3900\;\mathrm{m}$ wate r depth in the MB and penetrated 774, 517, 517, and 542 meters below seafloor (mbsf), respectively. Under a thin layer of Pleistocene– upper Miocene sediment, Site U1513 cored a succession of Cretaceous units from the Campanian to the Valanginian. Site U151 4 sampled an expanded Pleistocene–Eocene sequence and terminated in the upper Albian. The Cenomanian–Turonian interval a t Site U1514 recovered deformed sedimentary rocks that probabl y represent a detachment zone. Site U1515 is located on the wes t Australian margin at $850\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth and was the most challenging site to core because much of the upper $350\,\mathrm{m}$ was either chert o r poorly consolidated sand. However, the prebreakup Jurassic(?) sediments interpreted from the seismic profiles were successfully recovered. Site U1516 cored an expanded Pleistocene, Neogene, an d Paleogene section and recovered a complete Cenomanian/Turonia n boundary interval containing five layers with high total organic carbon content.  

Recovery of well-preserved calcareous microfossil assemblage s from  different  paleodepths  will  enable  generation  of  paleotemperature and biotic records that span the rise and collapse of th e Cretaceous hot greenhouse (including OAEs 1d and 2), providin g insight to resultant changes in deep-water and surface water circulation that can be used to test predictions from earth system models. Paleotemperature proxies and other data will reveal the timing, magnitude, and duration of peak hothouse temperatures and an y cold snaps that could have allowed growth of a polar ice sheet. Th e sites will also record the mid-Eocene–early Oligocene opening o f the Tasman Gateway and the Miocene–Pliocene restriction of th e Indonesian Gateway; both passages have important effects o n global oceanography and climate. Understanding the paleoceanographic changes in a regional context provides a global test on models of Cenomanian–Turonian oceanographic and climatic evolutio n related both to extreme Turonian warmth and the evolution of OA E 2.  

The Early Cretaceous volcanic rocks and underlying Jurassic(? ) sediments cored in different parts of the MB provide informatio n on the timing of different stages of the Gondwana breakup. The recovered cores provide sufficient new age constraints to underpin  a reevaluation of the basin-wide seismic stratigraphy and tectoni c models for the region.  

# Introduction  

Understanding the mechanisms, feedbacks, and temporal relationships that link climate dynamics between the polar regions an d the tropics is of fundamental importance for reconstructing rapi d climate change in the past and hence improving predictions in th e future. High-resolution stratigraphic records from strategic locations around the globe, especially from the high-latitude oceans, ar e essential to achieve this broader goal. Within this context, past periods of extreme warmth such as the Cretaceous hot greenhouse an d the initial Eocene thermal maximum have attracted increasing research interest over recent years, resulting in often spectacular an d sometimes contradictory insights into the mechanisms of natural short-term changes in climate, biogeochemical cycling, and ocea n oxygenation. IODP Expedition 369 targeted these fundamental objectives with specific goals of providing high-latitude Souther n Ocean sites with expanded late Mesozoic and Cenozoic section s and improving constraints on the tectonic history of the region.  

Expedition 369 recovered sediments from the Great Australia n Bight (GAB) and Mentelle Basin (MB) that will provide new insight s to the evolution of Southern Hemisphere, high-latitude Cretaceou s climates. The high paleolatitude $(60^{\circ}{-}62^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ location of the site s (Figure F1) is especially important for global climatic studies because of the enhanced sensitivity to changes in ocean temperature. Study of the recovered sections will enable generation of high-resolution stratigraphic records across the rise and collapse of the Cretaceous hot greenhouse climate and concomitant changes in Earth’ s latitudinal thermal gradients and deep ocean circulation that continued through the Cenozoic. The well-resolved age framework o f the pelagic carbonate sequences will enable more precise correlation between global climatic shifts and tectonic history, especiall y major volcanic episodes in the region. These aspects are crucial t o improve our understanding of Earth’s climate system and to infor m the scientific modeling community on high-latitude Souther n Hemisphere Cretaceous (and possibly older) records in a currentl y underexplored region.  

# Background Geological setting  

Following the collision of Gondwana with Laurasia at 330–32 0 Ma, which formed the supercontinent of Pangaea, the breakup o f eastern Gondwana commenced during the Jurassic (Veevers, 2006). At this time, the Naturaliste Plateau (NP) was located near the tripl e junction of the Australian, Antarctic, and Greater India plates (Figure F1) at $60^{\circ}{-}62^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . The first stage of breakup occurred as Indi a separated from Australia. Later, in the early Eocene, Australia separated from Antarctica.  

# The Mentelle Basin and rifting of Greater India  

The MB separates the NP from western Australia and is part of  a sequence of basins along the western margin of Australia tha t formed during the breakup with India (Bradshaw et al., 2003). Th e rifting episode initiated in northwestern Australia in what is no w the Argo Abyssal Plain and then propagated southward in a series o f en echelon basins with the MB being the furthest south (Maloney e t al., 2011). The MB is separated from the Perth Basin by the basement high of the Leeuwin Block and the Yallingup Shelf (Figure F2). Despite its water depth $(2000{-}4000\,\mathrm{m})$ ), the basement under the M B is believed to be continental. The MB is believed to contain Jurassi c and possibly older sediments that were deposited in syn- and postrift basins. During the breakup with Greater India, the NP is classe d as part of a volcanic margin as evidenced by the onshore Bunbur y basalt, which recent dating has given an age of 137–130 Ma. Thi s date is contemporaneous with the final stages of rifting but olde r than the basalt found on the Kerguelen Plateau, even though th e geochemistry is similar (Olierook et al., 2016). Basalt is widel y dredged around the NP and, as has been documented on volcani c margins elsewhere (Planke et al., 1999), is the cause of the stron g seismic reflection echo seen on seismic profiles that cross the M B and denote the top of the Valaginian. Younger sediments were deposited in a thermally subsiding basin and margin. Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 258 previously drilled this post-rift sectio n on the western margin of the MB but stopped short of the interpreted basalt horizon.  

Seismic data acquired in 2004 and 2009 by Geoscience Australi a (tied to Site 258) provided a regional survey to appraise the stratigraphic, structural, and depositional history of the MB (Maloney e t al., 2011; Borissova et al., 2010). Relatively young Neogene carbonate oozes unconformably overlie Paleogene deep marine chalk. Occasional bright reflection events in this sequence are likely cause d by thin chert bands. This Paleogene chalk unconformably overlie s Cretaceous coccolith-rich chalk that is underlain by Albian/Aptia n claystones that pinch out against a glauconitic sandstone. The unconformity at the base of the ooze and the top of the glauconiti c sandstone can be identified and interpreted from the seismic data; the other boundaries do not create distinct reflections. The glauconitic sandstone sequence is floored by a high-amplitude reflectio n (not sampled at Site 258) that is interpreted to be caused by Valanginian volcanics. Hence, this horizon coincides with the onset o f breakup and separation of Greater India from Australia and a serie s of subsequent volcanic episodes related to the continuing breaku p on the northern and western margins of the NP. Prior rifting of th e area is recorded by Early Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Permian/Triassi c sequences, although the interpretation is somewhat speculative because the sequences lacked borehole control.  

# Opening of the Australo-Antarctic Gulf  

The breakup on the southern margin of Australia is thought t o have started in the Cenomanian–Turonian (Direen et al., 2011) an d proceeded at a very slow rate. Contrary to the rifting of Greater India, this margin is believed to be nonvolcanic, but plate tectonic reconstructions corresponding to these early stages of rifting ar e poorly constrained and controversial (White et al., 2013). The ${\sim}15$ km thick post-Middle Jurassic sedimentary sequence that accumulated in the GAB contains the largest continental margin deltaic sequence  deposited  during  the  Late  Cretaceous  greenhouse. Accelerated subsidence commencing in the late Albian and continuing through the Cenomanian–Santonian led to the depositio n of a thick sequence of marine shales (Totterdell et al., 2000). Durin g the Cretaceous, the GAB was situated at the eastern tip of a partial seaway, the Australo-Antarctic Gulf (AAG), with the NP in the ope n ocean at the western gateway that connected the AAG with th e southern Indian Ocean.  

An overall transgressive phase of sedimentation in the earl y Paleogene was followed by the establishment of open marine carbonate shelf conditions from the early Eocene onward. The AA G eventually widened to create the Southern Ocean with a switch t o rapid spreading after $45\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (White et al., 2013). An industry well, Jerboa-1, in the Eyre subbasin on the continental shelf provided  a stratigraphic tie along seismic profile AGSO Survey 65 Line 0 6 (Bradshaw et al., 2003).  

# Opening of the Indian Ocean and Tasman Gateway and closure of the Indonesian Gateway  

After initial rifting, India drifted in a north-northwest directio n with strike-slip motion along the Wallaby-Zenith Fracture Zone. This juxtaposed their continental shelves until ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , isolatin g the nascent Indian Ocean from global deep-water circulation (Gibbons et al., 2013). Subsequently, the northward drift of Australi a through the Cenozoic affected changes in two important ocea n gateways to the Indian Ocean: the opening of the Tasman Gatewa y between Australia and Antarctica in the middle Eocene–early Oligocene and the restriction of the Indonesian Gateway between Australia and Southeast Asia in the Miocene–Pliocene. Both passage s have important effects on global oceanography and climate, and th e NP/MB region is well situated to monitor their opening history an d resultant effects on ocean circulation (Figure F3).  

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in the Souther n Ocean is central to the present-day overturning circulation and surface heat redistribution (Lumpkin and Speer, 2007). Although ther e is no significant restriction on the ACC in the modern Tasman Passage, the Tasman and Drake Passages both opened during the middle Eocene–Oligocene, and the restriction to flow at the Tasma n Passage would have been significant for ocean circulation, especially in the late Eocene–early Oligocene. During the Paleocene– Eocene, southern Australia would have been influenced more b y subpolar (rather than the modern subtropical) gyres as a consequence of the closed or restricted Tasman Passage and more southerly position of Australia (e.g., Huber et al., 2004). During the Earl y Eocene Climatic Optimum, however, temperatures in the southwes t Pacific Ocean near Australia seem to have been warmer than climate models predict (Hollis et al., 2012). Cooling of the Antarcti c margin relative to the Australian margin near Tasmania occurre d early in the opening of the Tasman Passage, which is dated at 49–5 0 Ma (Bijl et al., 2013), and differentiation of deepwater produced i n the Southern Ocean relative to the North Atlantic began in the lat e middle Eocene (Cramer et al., 2009; Borrelli et al., 2014). However, plate tectonic reconstructions (Müller et al., 2000) indicate that separation of Australia and Antarctica near Tasmania occurred late r $(\sim\!43\,\mathrm{Ma})$ . Recovering material spanning this time interval thus provides an important opportunity to reconcile these tectonic an d paleoceanographic interpretations.  

The restricted surface flow through the Indonesian Gateway i s essential to the surface heat flux in the Pacific and Indian Ocean s and has been linked to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics and the global ocean overturning circulation (Gordon, 1986; Godfrey, 1996; Lee et al., 2002). The gradual restriction of the Indonesian Passage from deep-water throughflow in the late Oligocene– early Miocene to variable shallow flow in the Pliocene–Pleistocen e is thought to have strongly affected surface heat distribution wit h potential links to the late Neogene cooling and Northern Hemisphere glaciation (Cane and Molnar, 2001; Kuhnt et al., 2004; Kara s et al., 2009).  

# Objectives  

1. Investigate the timing and causes for the rise and collapse of the Cretaceous hot greenhouse and how this climate mode affected the climate-ocean system and oceanic biota.  

Compilations of deep-sea benthic foraminiferal and bulk carbonate $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ data reveal that the world ocean experienced long-ter m warming from the late Aptian through middle Cenomanian, maintained extremely warm temperatures from the late Cenomania n through Santonian with peak warmth during the Turonian $(>\!20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at midbathyal depths), and gradually returned to cooler value s $({\sim}6^{\circ}{-}8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at midbathyal depths) during the Maastrichtian (Huber e t al., 1995, 2002, 2011; Clarke and Jenkyns, 1999; Friedrich et al., 2012; O’Brien et al., 2017). Recent benthic and planktonic $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ values obtained from the Turonian at Site 258 support extreme highlatitude Turonian warmth (Huber et al., submitted). Still, these $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ values are problematically low and seem to defy straightforward explanations (Bice et al., 2003). These new analyses compared to existing stable isotope data (Huber et al., 1995, 2002) showed larg e changes at times of known climatic shifts. Relative to low-latitud e sites, high-latitude sites are both undersampled and respond mor e strongly to climate change.  

Although the Cretaceous has long been characterized as to o warm to sustain continental ice sheets (e.g., Barron, 1983; Frakes e t al., 1992; Huber et al., 2002; Hay, 2008), coincidences between se a level variations (deduced from sequence stratigraphy) and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records have been proposed by some authors as evidence for the occasional existence of polar ice (e.g., Barrera et al., 1997; Miller et al., 1999, 2005; Stoll and Schrag, 2000; Gale et al., 2002; Bornemann e t al., 2008) and winter sea ice (Bowman et al., 2012). The “greenhous e glaciers” hypothesis has been countered by evidence for diageneti c influence on bulk carbonate oxygen isotope records and stable tropical planktonic and benthic foraminiferal δ18O data across severa l of the proposed cooling intervals (Huber et al., 2002; Moriya et al., 2007; Ando et al., 2009; MacLeod et al., 2013), Furthermore, TEX8 6 values from DSDP Site 511 suggest sea-surface temperatures durin g the Hauterivian–Aptian interval of $25^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Jenkyns et al., 2012; O’Brien et al., 2017).  

High-resolution isotopic studies of samples from Expeditio n 369 sites should advance our understanding and improve geographic documentation of major global climatic warming and cooling transitions during the Cretaceous. Recovery of more complet e sections will lead to biostratigraphic refinements and improved regional to global correlations.  

2. Determine the relative roles of productivity, ocean temperature, and ocean circulation at high southern latitudes during Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs).  

OAEs are defined as short-lived $^{<1}$ My) episodes of enhance d deposition of organic carbon in a wide range of marine environments (Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976) and are associated with prominent carbon isotope excursions in marine and terrestrial sequence s (Jenkyns, 1980, 2010; Arthur et al., 1988; Gröcke et al., 1999; Jahre n et al., 2001; Ando et al., 2002; Jarvis et al., 2006). Generation o f OAEs has been attributed to a rapid influx of volcanogenic and/o r methanogenic $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sources leading to abrupt temperature rise an d an accelerated hydrological cycle, increased continental weatherin g and nutrient discharge to oceans and lakes, intensified upwelling, and an increase in organic productivity. Globally expressed Cretaceous OAEs occurred during the early Aptian (OAE 1a; ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{Ma}_{}^{}$ ) and at the Cenomanian/Turonian (C/T) boundary (OAE 2; ${\sim}94\$ Ma), whereas regionally recognized events occurred during th e early Albian (OAE 1b; ${\sim}111\mathrm{\Ma}$ ) and late Albian (OAE 1d; ${\sim}100$ Ma).  

Cretaceous OAEs are best known from the Atlantic/Tethyan basins and surrounding continents, whereas Indian Ocean records ar e limited. The presence of black shales with as much as $6.9\%$ total organic carbon (TOC) in the GAB (Totterdell et al., 2008), $11\%$ at Sit e U1513 and up to $14\%$ at Site U1516, suggest water may even hav e been euxinic in the region during deposition of OAE 2. OAE deposits should have been present at Kerguelen (Ocean Drilling Progra m [ODP] Site 1138) and Exmouth Plateaus and adjacent basinal area s (primarily ODP Site 763), but drilling strategies and poor recover y resulted in all of the cores missing the OAE record.  

Recovery of a continuous record of the C/T boundary OAE  2 was anticipated at GAB Site U1512, western MB Site U1513, an d northern MB Site U1514, although the actual recovery at Expedition 369 sites was different (see Principal results). At all sites, th e anticipated OAE 2 interval is at a shallow burial depth $({\sim}260{-}460$ meters below seafloor [mbsf]) where sediments are thermally immature and biogenic preservation is good to excellent. Observation s and data will compare the Expedition 369 sites and other high-latitude OAE 2 sites to establish (1) whether significant changes i n ocean circulation were coincident with OAE 2, (2) over what dept h ranges (Zheng et al., 2013), and (3) whether OAE 2 in the high-latitude Southern Hemisphere was coincident with major changes i n sea-surface temperatures (Jarvis et al., 2006). We were particularl y interested in establishing whether the C/T succession contained evidence for the “Plenus cold event,” an important cooling ( ${\sim}4$ t o $>\!5^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ event within OAE 2 known from the Northern Hemisphere. This event is associated with changes in surface water circulatio n (e.g., Zheng et al., 2013) and reoxygenation of bottom water, but i t remains unclear whether the Plenus cold event was a global or regional phenomenon. Data from the high southern latitudes are currently lacking (Jenkyns et al., 2012) and would address this critical gap in our model for OAE 2.  

3. Identify the main source regions for deep- and intermediate water masses in the southeast Indian Ocean and how these changed during the Gondwana breakup.  

Over the past few years, study of Cretaceous intermediate an d deep-water circulation patterns has been galvanized by an increas e in published neodymium (Nd) isotopic data (e.g., Jiménez Berrocoso et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2010; MacLeod et al., 2011; Marti n et al., 2012; Murphy and Thomas, 2012; Jung et al., 2013; Moiroud e t al., 2013; Voigt et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2013). Nd isotopic value s (expressed as εNd) have emerged as a promising proxy for reconstructing past circulation and are applicable across a wide range o f water depths, including abyssal samples deposited below the carbonate compensation depth.  

Typically measured on either phosphatic fossils (fish teeth, bones, and scales) or oxides leached from bulk samples, εNd value s record a depositional to early diagenetic bottom water signatur e generally resistant to later diagenetic overprinting (Martin an d Scher, 2004). The bottom water signature, in turn, reflects the εN d value of the source region of that water mass because Nd enters th e ocean largely as riverine or eolian input, has a residence tim e shorter than the mixing time of the oceans, and has semiconservative behavior. Because εNd values in likely source regions vary b y 10–15 units compared to an analytical precision of ${\sim}0.3$ units, stratigraphic trends in εNd can be used to infer changes in circulation and mixing patterns through time. However, εNd values o f samples are also influenced by local and global volcanic inputs, an d the bottom water εNd signature of a water mass can be modifie d during circulation due to a high particle flux or boundary exchange, especially near detrital sources.  

Cretaceous εNd data have been used to test, refine, and revis e earlier circulation hypotheses that were based largely on carbon an d oxygen isotopes. They have also documented correlation betwee n εNd shifts and both long-term climate trends and shorter bioevent s (e.g., OAE 2) and demonstrated a degree of complexity within an d among sites not predicted by early studies. The latter is particularl y true for the Southern Ocean, where circulation changes, water column stratification changes, volcanic inputs, and establishment of  a widespread source of Southern Component Water have all been invoked to explain observed patterns (e.g., Robinson and Vance, 2012; Murphy and Thomas, 2012; Jung et al., 2013; Voigt et al., 2013). Neodymium studies of samples from sites representing a range o f depths within the MB/NP, when combined with parallel paleotemperature estimates from $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{TEX}_{86}$ and documentation o f calcareous microfossil assemblages, should help reduce uncertaint y in interpretation of previous studies.  

4. Characterize how oceanographic conditions changed at the MB during the Cenozoic opening of the Tasman Passage and restriction of the Indonesian Gateway.  

The MB sites are well positioned to monitor paleoceanographi c variations in the Leeuwin Current/Undercurrent system. The surface Leeuwin Current is unique in flowing poleward along the eastern boundary of the Indian Ocean (Figure F3). It is caused by th e north–south gradient between cooler waters to the south and war m surface waters along the northwestern Australian coast. Thes e warmer waters are derived from the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF ) that overrides the prevailing wind stress and results in the polewar d flow (Pattiaratchi, 2006; Godfrey, 1996; Domingues et al., 2007; Waite et al., 2007). The strength of the Leeuwin Current varies seasonally with the ITF strength and interannually with ENSO dynamics, strengthening in winter and under La Niña conditions. Th e intermediate Leeuwin Undercurrent is derived from an eddy syste m associated with the Flinders Current near the NP (Middleton an d Cirano, 2002; Waite et al., 2007; Meuleners et al., 2007; Divakara n and Brassington, 2011). The Flinders Current and Leeuwin Undercurrent are conduits of the Tasman leakage, a pathway for retur n flow to the North Atlantic Ocean of deepwater upwelled in the Pacific and a component of the Southern Hemisphere super-gyre tha t links the subtropical gyres of the Atlantic, Pacific, and India n Oceans (Speich et al., 2002, 2007; Ridgway and Dunn, 2007; van Sebille et al., 2012). The Tasman leakage allows interconnection o f Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) in the Pacific, Atlantic, an d Indian Oceans, and the Flinders Current–Leeuwin Undercurren t system seems to play a role in the conversion of Subantarctic Mod e Water to AAIW (Ridgway and Dunn, 2007). Deepwater in the MB i s derived from Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and lower Circumpolar Deep Water that enter the Perth Basin between the MB an d Broken Ridge, with substantial upwelling of AABW in the souther n portion of the Perth Basin (Sloyan, 2006; McCartney and Donohue, 2007).  

Coring in the MB complements previous drilling around Australia, especially off northwest and western Australia (DSDP Leg 27, ODP Legs 122 and 123, and International Ocean Discovery Program [IODP] Expedition 356) and southern Australia and Tasmani a (ODP Legs 182 and 189). Coring recovered Paleocene–Eocene an d upper Miocene–recent sequences at deep-water and intermediat e water locations. Recovered material from this expedition will contribute to investigations of (1) the early Paleogene greenhouse climate at a high-latitude $(\mathrm{\sim}60^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ site, (2) oceanographic changes i n the early stages of the opening of the Tasman Passage, and (3 ) oceanographic changes during the late stages of restriction of th e Indonesian Passage.  

5. Resolve questions about the volcanic and sedimentary origins of the basin and provide stratigraphic control on the age and nature of the prebreakup succession.  

The interlinked aspects of the geology and evolution of the N P and MB suggest that recovering the volcanic rocks at the Valanginian/late Hauterivian unconformity will further our understanding o f this region. Drilling the unconformity provides information on  

1. The timing and position of the breakup (both on the western and southern margin, using paleomagnetic studies and $^{40}\mathrm{{Ar/^{39}}\mathrm{{Ar}}}$ dating of lavas),   
2. The nature of the various phases of volcanism (core description, petrophysics, and geochemical and isotopic study),   
3. Geographic and environmental reconstructions, and   
4. The depositional history of the basin.  

The principal cause of high-amplitude discontinuous reflector s overlying the Valanginian breakup unconformity corresponds to extrusive volcanics that flowed into the MB at the time of the breaku p with Greater India. Drilling into the Valanginian volcanics and preValanginian sediments (Sites U1513 and U1515) will provide stratigraphic control on the age and nature of the prebreakup successio n and early rifting in the MB. Dating and analysis of the post-breaku p sediments will provide needed information as to the developmen t of the MB and particularly the influence of the later rifting wit h Antarctica. The results from this expedition will address a numbe r of key tectonics questions for the region.  

# Principal results Site U1512  

# Site background and objectives  

The  objective  for  coring  Site  U1512 $(34^{\circ}1.6407^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $127^{\circ}57.7604\,^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ ) was to obtain a continuous Upper Cretaceous record of marine black shales in the GAB across OAE 2, which straddles the $C/\mathrm{T}$ boundary. Our plan was to compare the Site U151 2 sediment record with coeval Expedition 369 sequences cored in th e MB to characterize the geochemical and biological responses to extreme global carbon cycle perturbations in different paleoceanographic settings at high southern latitudes. Site U1512 lies in th e GAB in ${\sim}3000\;\mathrm{m}$ of water on the continental slope. During the Cretaceous, the GAB was situated at the eastern tip of a partial seawa y (the AAG), with the MB and NP in the open ocean at the wester n gateway that connected the AAG with the southern Indian Ocean. Studies of the recovered sequence of early Turonian–late Santonia n marine claystone will provide new insight into the evolution of Lat e Cretaceous climate and oceanography in the region of the AAG.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sedimentary sequence of Hole U1512A is divided into tw o main lithostratigraphic units (Figure F4). Unit I is a $10.06\mathrm{~m~}$ thic k sequence of Pleistocene pinkish to white calcareous ooze wit h sponge spicules. The unit extends from the beginning of the hole t o $10.06\;\mathrm{m}$ core depth below seafloor (CSF-A) (Sections 369-U1512A1R-1 through 2R-1; $0{-}10.2\ \mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ). The unit consists of mediu m and thick beds with no distinctive sedimentary structures, exhibit s no bioturbation, and is massive and structureless. In this unit, biogenic grains are the major constituent and comprise dominant calcareous nannofossils, abundant foraminifers, and common spong e spicules. Unit II is a $690.32\:\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of silty clay that gradationally transitions into silty claystone (Sections 2R-1 through 73RCC at the bottom of the hole; $10.2–701.4\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). This unit i s black to dark gray mottled silty claystone composed of quartz, cla y minerals, pyrite, siderite, and dolomite with varying degrees of bioturbation. Micropaleontological analysis indicates a Late Cretaceous (Santonian to Turonian) age for this unit. Lithostratigraphi c Unit II is further divided into Subunits IIa (silty clay) and IIb (silt y claystone) based on the degree of sediment lithification. Subunit II a is $75.10~\mathrm{m}$ thick and composed of very dark greenish gray to blac k unlithified silty clay. This subunit is characterized by the presence o f pyrite both as nodules and in a disseminated form within the silt y clay. Zeolite, foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, and spong e spicules are present in trace amounts throughout the subunit. Inoceramid bivalve fragments and alteration halos occur frequentl y throughout the subunit. Subunit IIb is $615.22\mathrm{~m~}$ thick and is composed of lithified black silty claystone. Included in this subunit ar e 23 thin to medium beds of glauconitic and sideritic sandstone tha t are no thicker than $32\,\mathrm{cm}$ and mostly massive with normal grading. Bioclast traces present in this subunit include foraminifers, calcareous nannofossils, radiolarians, sponge spicules, and organic matter.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Samples from all Hole U1512A core catchers were analyzed fo r calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers. In addition, calcareous nannofossil assemblages were evaluated from split core sections. Observations of other distinctive an d potentially age or environmentally diagnostic microfossil groups, such as organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), radiolarians, fish debris, and inoceramid prisms, were also made in all cor e catcher samples. Calcareous nannofossil datums form the chronologic framework for Hole U1512A because they are most consistently present. In contrast, planktonic foraminifers are rare but, where present, have ages consistent with those from calcareou s nannofossils. Similarly, rare dinocyst taxa from Cores 369-U1512A47R through 70R (\~440–672 m CSF-A) and radiolarians from Core s  

5R through 35R ( ${\sim}38{-}333\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) provide valuable additional age confirmation of Late Cretaceous sediments.  

Core 1R is in calcareous nannofossil Zone CN15 and planktoni c foraminiferal Subzone Pt1b and is upper Pleistocene/Holocene. Cores 2R through 4R are barren of calcareous nannofossils but contain rare planktonic foraminifers of both Cenozoic and Cretaceou s species, which together with mixed radiolarian assemblage ages indicate downhole contamination during coring. Cores 5R and 6R ar e upper Santonian and lowermost Campanian calcareous nannofossil Zone CC17. Cores 7R through 11R $^{\prime}{\sim}57{-}104\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) are assigned  to  latest  Coniacian–Campanian  calcareous  nannofossil Zones CC16 and CC17. Cores 12R through 16R ( $^{\sim105-154\mathrm{\,m}}$ CSFA) are in Zone CC15, spanning the uppermost Coniacian and lowermost Santonian. Cores 17R through 20R $({\sim}154{-}192\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ) are Zone CC14 of Coniacian age. Cores 21R through 30R are mostl y barren of all age diagnostic carbonate microfossils but likely spa n the C/T boundary. Cores 31R through 73R (to the base of the hole a t $701.38\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) are Turonian based on calcareous nannofossils i n Cores 31R through 48R spanning Zone CC12, Cores 49R throug h 73R in Zone CC11, and Cores 65R through 73R in Zone CC10c.  

Tubular agglutinated forms dominate benthic foraminiferal assemblages at Site U1512 and indicate either a lower to midbathyal environment or a marginal/restricted environment throughout th e Late Cretaceous.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of all archive-hal f core sections and 21 discrete samples collected from the workin g halves of Hole U1512A were measured. The archive halves wer e stepwise treated with up to $30\;\mathrm{mT}$ alternating field (AF) demagnetization and measured with the pass-through superconducting roc k magnetometer (SRM) at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals. The NRM intensity of th e section is relatively weak and varies from $1.5~\times~10^{-5}$ to $7.8~\times$ $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ with a mean of $5.5\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . The drilling-induced magnetic overprints can generally be removed by AF demagnetizatio n at $10{-}20\,\mathrm{mT}\$ . Inclinations of the characteristic remanent magnetizations (ChRMs) are predominantly negative, ranging from aroun d $-70^{\circ}$ to $-20^{\circ}$ , indicating predominantly normal polarity. The uppermost ${\sim}80\mathrm{~m~}$ display a very noisy signal because of the significan t coring disturbance (biscuiting) introduced by the rotary coring process. Positive inclination values occur between 0 and 75, 175 an d 190, and 256 and $259\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The intervals from ${\sim}0$ to 75 and 17 5 to $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A also exhibit sporadic or consecutive negativ e ChRM inclinations mixed with dominantly positive inclinations, making it impossible to assign magnetic polarity. The interval between 256 and $259~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A exhibits consistent downward-pointing paleomagnetic inclinations, defining a zone of reversed polarit y that is probably associated with a short geomagnetic excursion.  

Shipboard micropaleontological studies suggest that Core 5 R (38.4–47.4 m CSF-A) is Santonian and the base of Core 73R is earl y Turonian. Therefore, the majority of the sedimentary cores fro m 38.4 to $700\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A document the uppermost segment of th e 41.5 My Cretaceous normal Superchron $C34\mathrm{n}$ .  

# Petrophysics  

Physical property data were obtained with the Whole-Roun d Multisensor Logger (WRMSL), Natural Gamma Radiation Logge r (NGRL), $P$ -wave velocity caliper (PWC), Section Half Multisenso r Logger (SHMSL), and discrete samples. WRMSL $P_{\|}$ -wave measurements were discontinued deeper than Core 11R because of poo r contact between the core sections, their liners, and the caliper. NG R values (Figure F4) average 32.8 counts/s, and bulk density estimate s from gamma ray attenuation (GRA) average $1.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . GRA bul k density values in siltstone/claystone do not exceed $2.2\;\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , whereas in siderite nodules and glauconitic sandstones they increase to $3.28\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . WRMSL magnetic susceptibility values average 9.35 instrument units (IU), do not exceed 16 IU in claystone an d siltstone, but increase to 253.58 IU in glauconitic sandstone an d siderite; point measurements from the SHMSL agree with th e trends. At scales longer than $10\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the NGR and magnetic susceptibility records do not correlate over silty/clayey intervals from Core s 3R through 15R, possibly because of the high abundance of pyrit e differentially influencing the magnetic susceptibility values. Th e NGR and GRA records display parallel trends in this interval. Fro m Core 16R to 62R, pyrite abundance markedly decreases, and al l three data types (magnetic susceptibility, NGR, and GRA density ) display similar trends. From Core 63R to 73R, both NGR and magnetic susceptibility decrease, but GRA density remains stable. A t shorter scales $\left(<\!10\,\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ , magnetic susceptibility, GRA density, an d NGR show high-amplitude cycles of $3{-}5\;\mathrm{m}$ thickness in Cores 10 R through 19R, 34R through 43R, and 62R through 73R. The range o f $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities in the silty claystone range from 1670 to $2346\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , although faster velocities $(3397\!-\!5774\mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{s})$ were obtained for th e discrete layers of sideritic sandstone. High-resolution $\left(2\thinspace\mathrm{cm}\right)$ reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry data from archive-half cor e sections display high-amplitude variability.  

On average, three discrete moisture and density (MAD) sample s were taken from each core. Overall, the MAD results show that bul k density increases and grain density and porosity decrease. Bulk density for the dark silty claystone is $1.54{-}2.37\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and the density o f the sideritic sandstone intervals ranges from 3.21 to $3.49\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Porosities in the silty claystone are $28\%{-}65\%$ , with most measurements between $40\%$ and $48\%$ .  The  porosity  of  the  sideriti c sandstone ranges from $5\%$ to $13\%$ .  

Potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium $\mathrm{Th})$ content were deconvolved from the NGR data. U/Th ratios are $_{<0.2}$ throughout th e entire hole, indicating oxic conditions during deposition. K/Th ratios sharply decrease in the uppermost $100\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , possibly caused b y the presence of salt in this interval, which may increase the K content.  

One downhole logging run measured NGR, density, sonic velocity, and resistivity values of the borehole wall using the triple combination (triple combo) tool string with the Dipole Shear Soni c Imager (modified triple combo tool string hereafter). Excellen t borehole stability and favorable low-heave weather conditions permitted logging of the entire open borehole. Inclinometer reading s progressively increase from roughly $0^{\circ}$ shallower than $210~\mathrm{m}$ wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) to $27^{\circ}$ near the bas e of the hole, indicating that the borehole orientation deviated fro m vertical during coring. Background trends in density, NGR, and resistivity logs are relatively stable in the upper $300\;\mathrm{m}$ of the borehole. Below that interval, each of those three logs records minimum values near $325\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF}$ and then increases downhole to plateaus approaching maxima for the hole. Additionally, the density an d resistivity logs preserve thin spikes in values that likely correspon d to the thin sideritic and glauconitic sandstone beds commonly observed (see Lithostratigraphy). In general, downhole measurements record trends that are similar to those observed in th e physical properties measured from the cores, such as meter-scal e cyclicity in NGR (Figure F4), and provide a continuous petrophysical stratigraphy to span occasional gaps in core recovery.  

# Geochemistry  

The geochemistry program was designed to characterize th e composition of interstitial water and bulk sediments and to asses s the potential presence of volatile hydrocarbons for routine safet y monitoring. A total of 73 headspace gas samples were taken, and hydrocarbons were detected in 69 samples, although Cores 1 R through 9R were broadly free of interstitial gas. Methane was th e dominant gas detected (as high as $104,000\mathrm{\ppmv})$ ), with very mino r ethane and occasional propane (up to 653 and 148 ppmv, respectively). Methane:ethane ratios suggest a transition from biogeni c production above ${\sim}473\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to possible thermogenic source s below that depth.  

For interstitial water analyses, 46 samples were recovered fro m whole-round squeezing of sediment intervals. As a result of sediment lithology, interstitial water yield was low for the majority o f the cores deeper than Core 12R $_{\sim115\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}}$ ). The final interstitial water sample was taken from Core 59R ( ${\sim}560~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). Th e salinity of interstitial water samples generally decreases with dept h due to decreases in sulfate $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ , magnesium $\left(\mathrm{Mg}\right)$ , and potassiu m (K) concentrations and general decreases in sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}\right)$ , bromid e $\left(\mathbf{B}\mathbf{r}^{-}\right)$ , and chloride (Cl−), possibly caused by low-salinity water present at greater depths. The dissolved Mg, K, and boron (B) concentration profiles reflect alteration of volcanic material and cla y mineral formation. Sulfate is readily depleted within the upper ${\sim}93$ m (Core 10R) of the sedimentary column (Figure F4) due to intens e bacterial $\mathrm{{SO}_{4}^{2-}}$ reduction, which is accompanied by synchronous increases in ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{\;\;+}\right)$ , alkalinity, and lithium (Li), alon g with high barium (Ba) values when $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ is exhausted. Alkalinit y ranges from 4.4 to $16.52\ \mathrm{mM}$ with a maximum at $93.55\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , and $\mathsf{p H}$ ranges from 7.76 to 7.97 with a slight decrease downhole; both measurements are limited to the uppermost ${\sim}130~\mathrm{m}$ becaus e of the small interstitial water volumes obtained from deeper samples. The dissolved calcium (Ca) and, to a lesser degree, strontiu m (Sr) concentration profiles show increasing concentrations towar d $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A that are more than likely due to carbonate diagenesis. Decreasing Ca and Sr concentrations deeper than $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A indicate that carbonate dissolution/recrystallization may prevail a t depth. Dissolved silicon (Si) shows a short positive excursion between 310.68 and 329.27 m CSF-A (Figure F4), reflecting the presence of biogenic opal-A in the sediment; lower values deeper tha n Core 35R may be due to opal-A/cristobalite and tridymite (CT ) transformation. Elevated manganese (Mn) concentrations demonstrate the reducing character of the entire sedimentary sequence.  

$C a C O_{3}$ content from Cores 1R through 73R varies from 0.06 t o $6.66~\mathrm{wt\%}$ with the exception of Core 1R, which is composed of calcareous ooze with $90.97\%\,{\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ . The low carbonate percentages i n Cores 2R through 73R reflect the very low contribution of calcareous nannofossil and foraminiferal components to the sediment. TOC, which is predominantly terrestrially derived, ranges from 0.2 0 to $1.31\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ , and total nitrogen (TN) ranges from $_{<0.01}$ to $0.10\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC/TN ratios generally decrease with depth, ranging from 6.30 t o 31.19. This trend is likely caused by decomposition of nitrogen-containing terrestrial organic matter that released carbon as methan e but retained the produced $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ in clays. Eight freeze-dried bul k sediment samples with $\mathrm{TOC}>1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ were analyzed on the sourc e rock analyzer. The results show very low hydrogen index values, an d the kerogen in the samples was classified as Type III, suggesting  a predominantly terrestrial origin for the organic carbon.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Only one hole was drilled at Site U1512 with the rotary core barrel (RCB) system. Recovery was excellent, exceeding $100\%$ in 24 o f the 73 cores recovered, and total recovery was $90\%$ . Distinctive features for correlation included large-scale $^{(>10\mathrm{~\,~m~})}$ trends an d changes of variable amplitude on shorter length scales $\left(1{-}5\ \mathrm{m}\right)$ i n NGR and magnetic susceptibility data, as well as distinct peaks corresponding to sandstone layers. Despite being unable to correlat e cored intervals, recognition of matching features in NGR record s from the Hole U1512A cores and wireline logs permitted a correlation of core depth scales from the CSF-A scale to the WMSF scale.  

# Age-depth model and sedimentation rates  

Sediment accumulation rates are $36\;\mathrm{m/My}$ for Santonian Zone s CC17 and CC16 and $19\ \mathrm{m/My}$ for Zone CC15 (Figure F4). The interval from the uppermost Coniacian to middle Turonian, encompassing  Zones  CC14  and  CC13,  has  an  average  sedimen t accumulation rate of $63\;\mathrm{m/My}$ . Sediment accumulation rates accelerate markedly in the lower to middle Turonian Zone CC12 to a rat e of $272\;\mathrm{m/My}$ . This estimate does not correct for the hole deviatio n from vertical (see Petrophysics and Operations).  

# Site U1513  

# Background and objectives  

The objectives for coring Site U1513 on the western margin o f the MB were to (1) obtain a continuous Late Cretaceous sedimen t record to better document the rise and fall of the Cretaceous ho t greenhouse climate at southern high latitudes $\mathrm{-}60^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ paleolatitude), (2) characterize how oceanographic conditions changed during th e Cenozoic opening of the Tasman Passage and the restriction of th e Indonesian Gateway, and (3) obtain basalt from the base of the sedimentary sequence to provide stratigraphic control on the age an d nature of the pre-Gondwana breakup succession. A particularly important goal was to obtain a complete OAE 2 sequence across th e C/T boundary in order to characterize associated biotic, oceanographic, and climatic changes. The Site U1513 sequence will b e compared with coeval Expedition 369 sections cored elsewhere o n the MB and other ocean drilling (e.g., Site 258) and industry dat a from the western Australia margin and in the GAB to identify an y regional differences in the geochemical biological responses to th e OAEs and Cretaceous and Neogene ocean circulation history.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The Site U1513 cored section is divided into six lithostratigraphic units, five sedimentary and one igneous, based on a combination of data from Holes U1513A, U1513B, U1513D, and U1513E. Lithostratigraphic units and boundaries are defined by changes i n lithology as identified by macroscopic core description, microscopic examination of smear slides and thin sections, and X-ray diffraction  (XRD)  and  X-ray  fluorescence  (XRF)  analyses. Lithostratigraphic Unit I is a $64.93\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of light gray t o pale yellow calcareous ooze and nannofossil ooze with sponge spicules that is Pleistocene–late Miocene in age. Unit II is a $182.93\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of Campanian–Cenomanian white to greenish gra y calcareous and nannofossil ooze/chalk and clayey nannofossil chal k with intervals of silicified limestone. Unit III is a $21.87\textrm{m}$ thick sequence of alternating greenish gray, light gray, and black nannofossil-rich claystone that is Cenomanian in age. Unit IV is a 187.1 2 m thick sequence of black claystone and nannofossil-rich clayston e that is Cenomanian–Albian in age. Unit V, described only in Hol e U1513D, is a $234.25\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of sandstone with siltston e and silty claystone that are Aptian to Valanginian in age. Unit VI i s an $82.2~\mathrm{m}$ thick alternation of extrusive basalt flows and breccia intruded by a diabase dike. A sharp boundary is present betwee n Units V and VI. The top of Unit VI is defined by a flow-top brecci a with an altered matrix that grades downsection into a massive plagioclase-phyric basalt flow. The unit is composed of five extrusiv e sequences intercalated with four volcaniclastic breccia beds tha t show graded structures and are defined as lithologic Units 1–7. Each extrusive sequence is generally bounded by chilled margin s but also by faults or textural and color changes. Most discrete flow s appear to be massive, thin sheets of olivine $\pm$ pyroxene- or plagioclase-phyric (some megacrystic) basalt. The least-altered portions of the lowermost sequence (Unit 7) show a higher degree o f vesicularity and highly angular vesicles that may indicate subaerial to very shallow eruption depths. A xenolith-bearing diabase dike intrudes the flow sequences. The contact between the xenolith-bearing diabase dike and the extrusives are defined by either faulted o r chilled margins with alteration halos. These flows show a lesser degree of alteration in Hole U1513E than in Hole U1513D, and preliminary megascopic and thin section analyses reveal the original porphyritic, microcrystalline, or vesicular textures, with some of th e bottom flows showing interesting crosscutting lineation feature s and absence of minor intrusion intervals.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Samples from all core catchers from Holes U1513A and U1513 D and selected samples from Hole U1513B were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers. In addition, samples from split core sections were also evaluated fo r calcareous nannofossils and/or planktonic foraminiferal assemblages as necessary. Observations of other distinctive and potentially age or environmentally diagnostic microfossil groups, such a s organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), radiolarians, ostracods, fish debris, bryozoans, small corals, and inoceramid prism s were also made in all core catcher samples. Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminiferal datums form the chronologic framework for Site U1513 shallower than $450\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Core 369-U1513A-1H is in calcareous nannofossil Zone CN1 5 (upper Pleistocene/Holocene), whereas planktonic foraminifers indicate lower Pleistocene Subzone Pt1a. Samples 2H-CC and 3H-C C are assigned to middle Pleistocene Subzone CN14a, whereas Sample 4H-CC is assigned to upper Pliocene Subzone CN12a. Cores 5 H through 6H contain mixed assemblages of Neogene and Paleogen e species, but the main component of the nannoflora indicates lowe r Pliocene Zone CN10. The base of Core 7H also contains a mixe d assemblage but is dominated by species that indicate a late Miocen e age. Sample 8H-CC is calcareous ooze mixed with fragmented M n oxide nodules and phosphatized limestone that contains a mixe d assemblage with species derived from the Upper Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene; thus, it cannot be assigned confidently to a calcareous nannofossil zone. Cores 9H through 15F are assigned to th e lowermost Campanian Zone CC17. Upper Santonian Subzon e CC16b is found in Core 16X and lower Santonian Subzone CC16a i s found in Core 17X. The interval between Cores 18X and 23X is assigned to upper Coniacian Zone CC15. Cores 24X through 28X ar e assigned to middle to lower Coniacian Zone CC14. The Turonian t o lower Albian succession is described exclusively from Hole U1513D. Sample 369-U1513D-10R-CC is assigned to upper Turonian Zon e CC13. The middle to upper Turonian Zone CC12 ranges from Cor e 11R to Core 14R, whereas Sample 15R-CC is assigned to lower Turonian Zone CC11. Cores 16R through 20R contain a successio n that spans the C/T boundary. Cores 20R through 21R are correlate d with Subzones CC9c through CC10a of middle to late Cenomania n age. The lower Cenomanian Subzone $C C9c$ is placed between Core s 23R and 27R. Sample 28R-CC indicates upper Albian Subzone s CC9a through CC9b. The Core 29R through 31R interval is place d in Subzone CC8d of late Albian age. The middle Albian, comprisin g combined Subzones CC8b and CC8c, is found in Cores 32R throug h 36R. Cores 37R through 39R are assigned to Subzone CC8a of earl y Albian age. Sediments sampled deeper than Core 39R ( ${\sim}440\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) were barren of calcareous nannofossils.  

# Planktonic foraminifers  

Planktonic foraminiferal communities span the Pleistocen e through late Miocene and unconformably overlay a lower Campanian through Albian sequence. Pliocene planktonic foraminifera l Zones PL5 to PL2 were identified based on the presence of indicative taxa between Samples 369-U1513A-3H-CC and 6H-CC. Th e interval between Samples 6H-5, $146{-}150\ \mathrm{cm},$ and 8F-CC, immediately above the unconformity, is assigned to Miocene Zones M14– M11. Beneath the hardground is a lowermost Campanian throug h Albian sequence. Samples 9H-CC to 10H-CC are unzoned, wherea s Samples 11F-CC to 18X-CC; Samples 369-U1513B-13F-2, 89–9 1 cm, to 14F-CC; and Samples 369-U1513D-5R-CC to 7R-CC (79.8– 144.97 m CSF-A) are assigned the Santonian Planoheterohelix papula Zone. Samples 369-U1513A-19X-CC to 27X-CC and Sample s 369-U1513D-8R-2, $73{-}75~\mathrm{cm}_{:}$ , to 11R-CC are of Coniacian age an d represent the interval between the base of the $P_{\star}$ papula Zone an d the top of the Falsotruncana maslakovae Zone. The $\boldsymbol{F}$ maslakovae Zone spans Samples 369-U1513A-28X-CC through 32X-CC an d 369-U1513D-12R through 15R-CC. Samples between Sample 369- U1513A-33X-CC and 46X-CC and between Samples 369-U1513D16R-CC and 25R-CC are frequently barren of planktonic foraminifers or have rare, poorly preserved individuals. A middle Cenomanian to late Albian age is inferred from Sample 369-U1513A-46X-C C to the bottom of the hole $\left(284.69\;\mathrm{m}\right.$ CSF-A). Hole U1513D extend s beyond the base of Hole U1513A and can be divided into the uppe r Albian Thalmanninella appenninica, Pseudothalmanninella ticinensis, and Biticinella breggiensis Zones. Deeper than Sample 369- U1513D-33R-CC, samples are predominantly barren of planktoni c foraminifers.  

# Benthic foraminifers  

The Cenozoic benthic foraminiferal assemblages recorded i n Cores 369-U1513A-1H through 8F are characterized by abundan t calcareous-walled taxa. The species present indicate a bathyal wate r depth. Two distinctively different benthic foraminiferal assemblage s were recorded from the Cretaceous strata. In Cores 9H throug h 36X, a bathyal benthic assemblage dominated by calcareous-walle d forms was recorded. The percentage of planktonic foraminifers relative to benthic forms in this interval fluctuates between $80\%$ an d $99\%$ . In the Turonian strata, there is a decrease in the number o f planktonic individuals, and the percentage of planktonic foraminifers drops to $40\%$ (Cores 28X through 42X). Agglutinated foraminifers dominate from Samples 34X-CC through 50X-1, 126–127 cm, and 369-U1513D-22R-CC through 40R-CC. Glomospira spp. is th e most common taxon within this interval, suggesting a bathyal wate r depth.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The NRM of all archive-half core sections and 98 discrete samples collected from the working halves of Holes U1513A, U1513B, U1513D, and U1513E was measured. The archive halves were stepwise treated with up to 20 or $30~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization and measured with the pass-through SRM at $5\ \mathrm{cm}$ intervals. Discret e samples were progressively demagnetized up to 60 or $80~\mathrm{mT}$ an d measured with the spinner magnetometer or the SRM. The NR M intensity of the recovered cores is in the order of $10^{-5}$ to $1\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ an d broadly covaries with lithology. The calcareous ooze/chalk in th e upper part and the basalt in the basal part of Hole U1513D displa y the weakest and the strongest NRM intensity, respectively. Despit e the weak NRM of the calcareous ooze/chalk, the demagnetizatio n results after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ showed inclination zones of dominant positiv e and negative values, defining a magnetic polarity sequence fro m Chrons C1n to C2An.3n for the uppermost ${\sim}65\;\mathrm{m}$ . The inclination s of the $\mathord{\sim}65$ to $455\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A interval are mostly scattered, and dominant negative values from 200 to $450\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A indicate a normal polarity, which is assigned to Chron $C34\mathrm{n}$ based on shipboard biostratigraphy. The inclinations deeper than $455\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ exhibit  a distinct pattern of zones of either positive or negative values, establishing a well-defined magnetic polarity sequence. The polarity sequence between 455 and ${\sim}690\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ is tentatively correlate d with Chrons $\mathsf{M0r-M10n}$ , indicating the absence of most of the Aptian strata and increasing sedimentation rates between ${\sim}530$ an d ${\sim}690\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The well-defined reversed and normal polaritie s deeper than ${\sim}690~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A occur in the basalt unit and cannot b e correlated with the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) withou t constraints of ages from the basalt.  

# Petrophysics  

Physical property data were obtained with the WRMSL, NGRL , PWC, SHMSL, and discrete samples. The uppermost $35\,\mathrm{~m~}$ preserves cyclicity in NGR ( $_{\sim15}$ counts/s amplitude; $\sim\!5\textrm{m}$ thickness ) and was deconvolved into U, Th, and K concentrations. The C/ T boundary interval shows a distinct plateau of ${\sim}40$ counts/s in NG R values at ${\sim}240{-}245\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Additionally, NGR values preserve  a broad trend to higher counts through a mudstone interval spannin g from 230 to $455\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with a trough near $320\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Figur e F5). Below a contact with underlying volcaniclastic sandstones a t $455\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, NGR values decrease by nearly an order of magnitude from 75 to 10 counts/s and magnetic susceptibility values increased by two orders of magnitude from ${\sim}10$ to ${\sim}1000$ counts/s. Similarly, both grain and bulk density step to higher values acros s this transition. NGR values, more specifically U content, spik e across an interval near $675\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , possibly signifying abundan t terrestrial organic matter. The indurated breccia and crystallin e rocks of lithostratigraphic Unit VI show spikes in magnetic susceptibility and density, along with nearly undetectable counts of NGR. In the overlying sedimentary sequence (Units I–V), trends in porosity and PWC measurements demonstrate a gradual but occasionall y punctuated change to lower and higher values, respectively.  

Downhole logging was conducted in Holes U1513A, U1513D , and U1513E using several downhole tool configurations, includin g the modified triple combo tool string, which measures NGR, density, sonic velocity, and resistivity; the traditional triple combo; th e Formation MicroScanner (FMS) with the porosity tool; and the Versatile Seismic Imager for some intervals in Hole U1513E. NGR, density, and resistivity measurements from each hole yielded simila r results for the overlapping depth intervals across Holes U1513A, U1513D, and U1513E. The most continuous downhole logging ru n using the triple combo occurred in Hole U1513E and spanned fro m a bridge at ${\sim}615\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF to the bottom of the drill pipe at ${\sim}119\,\mathrm{m}$ WMSF. The wireline logging data provided continuous coverag e and filled several coring gaps. The most striking features include  a strong positive response in resistivity, density, and sonic velocit y values through intervals of silicified limestone (96–123 and 152– $180\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF; lithostratigraphic Unit II) and a shift from low t o high NGR across the $C/\mathrm{T}$ boundary interval $(\sim\!240{-}245\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF})$ . NGR increases downhole from this horizon through the Cenomanian–Albian claystones, displaying similar trends to the core-base d NGR. In situ temperature measurements were attempted in Hol e U1513B, but this experiment returned only one reliable measurement of $4.55\mathrm{^\circC}$ from Core 369-U1513B-5H.  

# Geochemistry  

The Site U1513 geochemistry program was designed to characterize interstitial water and bulk sediment composition and to assess the potential presence of volatile hydrocarbons for routin e safety monitoring. Samples were taken from Holes U1513A an d U1513D. All 90 headspace gas samples showed only low concentrations of methane $\mathrm{\left\{{\le}60\ p p m v\right)}}$ and trace levels of ethane and propane.  

For interstitial water analyses, 60 samples were recovered fro m squeezing $10~\mathrm{cm}$ whole rounds, covering 0–366.4 and 471.8–687. 3 m CSF-A. Sample salinity was generally constant, with the exception of distinctly fresher interstitial water between 281.8 and 303. 0 m CSF-A; this exception is also seen in the $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ profiles an d may reflect a low-salinity water source in this interval. The dissolved Mg, K, and Na concentration profiles reflect alteration o f volcanic material found in lithostratigraphic Units IV and V. No evidence for significant sulfate reduction was detected; sulfate is present throughout, and Ba concentrations are correspondingly low. The dissolved Ca (Figure F5) and $\operatorname{Sr}$ concentration profiles primarily reflect the release of these elements during the alteration reactions of volcanic material. Li appears to have been released in Uni t IV and then is incorporated into alteration products in Unit V. Dissolved Si reflects the presence of biogenic opal-A in Units I and II; lower concentrations in Units III and V may reflect the opal-A/C T and CT to quartz transition, respectively. Elevated Mn concentrations demonstrate the reducing character of the sedimentary sequence below Unit I.  

In addition, 129 bulk sediment samples were collected downhole to ${\sim}690\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Core 369-U1513D-65R), the contact wit h igneous material. Additional samples were measured at a highe r resolution through the putative OAE 2 and 1d intervals. $C a C O_{3}$ content varies from 0 to $93\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ , reflecting variations in lithology. TOC was broadly ${<}1\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ except in the OAE 2 interval, where TO C reaches $10.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TN is generally below the detection limit. A tota l of 57 samples with $\mathrm{TOC}\ge0.8~\mathrm{wt}\%$ from the OAE 2 and 1d interval s were analyzed with the source rock analyzer. Samples with highe r concentrations of TOC $(>3\mathrm{\wt\%})$ were found to be predominantl y marine in source, whereas the lower TOC samples were generall y inconclusive.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Four holes were cored at Site U1513. Recovery in any one hol e ranged from poor to excellent, but when combined, overall recover y was excellent for most of the interval that penetrated and spanne d the Valanginian through the present day. Splices were constructe d for the $0{-}95\;\mathrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) intervals (Holes U1513A and U1513B) and from 220 to $295\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCS F (Holes U1513A and U1513D) (Figure F5). These splices cover th e late Miocene through recent and the middle Cenomanian throug h the middle Turonian, respectively, as estimated from bio- an d magnetostratigraphy. Portions of both splices were formed by appending subsequent cores from the same hole because of aligne d core breaks or poor recovery in the other hole (i.e., there was n o bridge across core breaks in these intervals). However, correlatio n to downhole logging data minimized the uncertainty introduced b y this approach. The $95{-}220\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A interval was recovered i n Holes U1513A and U1513D. Despite this, no splice was attempte d because recovery was too low to meaningfully correlate at the mete r scale in this interval, but pooled data suggest recovery should b e sufficient to generate good records with 1 My resolution. The interval from 295 to $757.4\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A was only cored in Hole U1513D, bu t recovery was generally very good to excellent, averaging $82\%$ acros s ${\sim}70\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt and basaltic breccia (lithostratigraphic Unit VI) an d $75\%$ over the $395\;\mathrm{m}$ of overlying sandstones and claystones (Unit V ) between the basalt and the lower splice. The oldest biostratigraphi c date for these overlying sediments is middle Albian, althoug h magnetostratigraphy suggests portions could be older.  

# Age-depth model and sedimentation rates  

Sediment accumulation rates are presented in Figure F5 for th e Albian through Campanian portion of Site U1513. Sediment accumulation rates averaged ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{m}/$ My from the Albian through Coniacian but dropped appreciably during the Santonian and lowe r Campanian to only $8\ \mathrm{m/My},$ , with an apparent rate of only $3\mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{My}$ in the Santonian. Alternatively, part of the Santonian may be missing due to a hiatus in sediment accumulation. Sediment accumulation rates deeper than $450\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A are based on the paleomagneti c record. Sediment accumulation rates for the Barremian to uppe r Hauterivian (M0 to base Mr8) averaged approximately $10~\mathrm{m/My},$ whereas estimated rates for the lower Hauterivian and Valanginia n (M9 to M10) were ${\sim}132\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My}$ .  

# Site U1514  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1514 is the northernmost and deepest site targeted durin g Expedition 369. The greater paleodepth of the site relative to othe r sites cored in the MB provides the opportunity to characterize th e evolution of deep-water masses and deep ocean circulation durin g the final phase of breakup among the Gondwana continents. Because Site U1514 was located at a high paleolatitude $(\mathrm{\sim}60^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ , th e sediments preserve a paleoclimate record that serves as a highl y sensitive monitor of global climatic changes. The site was expecte d to sample a series of Cenozoic and possibly Late Cretaceous sedimentary drifts and erosional features that would enable greater insight into the early and later phases of the opening of the Tasma n Gateway and restriction of the Indonesian oceanic gateway. Th e current seabed is composed of Paleogene/Neogene/Quaternar y oozes that sit unconformably on the Cretaceous (Maloney et al., 2011).  

The primary objectives for coring Site U1514 were to (1) obtai n a continuous Cenozoic sediment record in the MB to characteriz e how oceanographic conditions changed during the Cenozoic opening of the Tasman Passage and the restriction of the Indonesia n Gateway; (2) reconstruct middle through Late Cretaceous paleotemperature changes to document initiation of the Cretaceous ho t greenhouse climate, the duration of extreme warmth, and when  a switch to a cooler climate occurred; and (3) obtain a complete an d well-preserved sediment record across mid-Cretaceous OAEs t o better understand their cause and accompanying changes in the climate-ocean system and the marine biota.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The Site U1514 cored section is divided into three main lithostratigraphic units based on data from Holes U1514A and U1514C, with Units I and III further divided into two subunits (Figure F6). Lithostratigraphic units and boundaries are defined by changes i n lithology as identified by macroscopic core description, microscopic examination of smear slides, and XRD and XRF analyses. Lithostratigraphic Unit I is a $81.20\textrm{m}$ thick sequence of very pal e brown to pale yellow nannofossil ooze, foraminiferal ooze, an d sponge spicule–rich nannofossil ooze that is Pleistocene–Eocene i n age. The unit is divided into Subunits Ia and Ib at $30.38\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ i n Hole U1514A. Subunit Ib spans the Miocene–Eocene and differ s from Subunit Ia in that it is characterized by an increased abundance of sponge spicules. Further, the color of Subunit Ib changes t o yellow-brown, which is distinctively darker than Subunit Ia. Unit I I is a $308.01\textrm{m}$ thick sequence of Eocene–Paleocene light greenis h gray clayey nannofossil ooze, sponge spicule–rich clay, and nannofossil-rich clay that gradationally transitions into clayey nannofossi l chalk and nannofossil-rich claystone. Unit III is a $126.43\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of greenish gray, brown, and black claystone that is Paleocene–Albian in age. Unit III is divided into Subunits IIIa and IIIb a t $454.33\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hole U1514C. Subunit IIIb was deposite d during the Cenomanian/Albian to Albian and is distinguished fro m overlying Subunit IIIa (Paleocene to Cenomanian/Albian) in that i t is characterized by darker greenish gray/black claystone. Soft-sediment deformation, possibly slumping, includes convoluted an d overturned bedding and is also present in Subunit IIIa (Cores 369- U1514C-25R through 29R; 411.2–455.31 m CSF-A).  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Samples from core catchers in Holes U1514A and U1514C wer e analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, an d benthic foraminifers. As necessary, additional samples from splitcore sections were evaluated for calcareous nannofossils and/o r planktonic foraminiferal assemblages. Observations of other distinctive and potentially age or environmentally diagnostic microfossil groups including calcispheres, diatoms, radiolarians, fis h debris, sponge spicules, and inoceramid prisms were also recorded.  

The Hole U1514A nannofossil biostratigraphy spans from Pliocene Subzone CN12a to lower Eocene Subzone CC9b, whereas Hol e U1514C spans middle Eocene Subzone CP13b to Subzones CC8b– CC8c of the early Albian. Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages recovered at Site U1514 are generally rare with poor to moderat e preservation, although discrete samples in the Pleistocene, Paleocene, Turonian, and Albian contain seemingly unrecrystallize d specimens. Planktonic foraminiferal communities in Hole U1514 A span Pleistocene Subzone Pt1a through lower Eocene Zone E4. Hole U1514C ranges from middle Eocene Zones E8–E9 to the T. appenninica/P. ticinensis Zones of the upper Albian. An apparentl y complete (at least to biozone level) though bioturbated Cretaceous/Paleogene $(\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{Pg})$ boundary section was recovered in Cor e 369-U1514C-23R. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by epifaunal, calcareous-walled taxa, indicating bathyal t o abyssal paleowater depths throughout the recovered interval.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The NRM of all archive-half core sections and 82 discrete samples collected from the working halves in Holes U1514A an d U1514C was determined as part of the paleomagnetism measurement program (Figure F6). The archive halves were stepwise treate d with up to 20 or $30\;\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization and measured with th e pass-through SRM at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals. Discrete samples were progressively demagnetized up to $60\;\mathrm{mT}$ and measured with the SRM. The NRM intensity of the recovered cores is in the order of $10^{-6}$ t o $1\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ and broadly covaries with lithology. Inclinations after th e $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step exhibit intervals dominated by positiv e and negative inclination values, defining an almost complete magnetic polarity sequence from Chron C1n (Brunhes) to Chron C34n, the long Cretaceous Normal Superchron, with 74 identified an d dated reversals. The magnetic data are of excellent quality in the advanced piston corer (APC) section ( $0{-}95\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) and exhibi t larger scatter caused by drilling disturbance in the extended cor e barrel (XCB) and RCB cores. The sequence is interrupted by fou r hiatuses at 11, 18, 30, and $41\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ identified by sharp lithologi c boundaries in conjunction with biostratigraphic constraints.  

# Petrophysics  

Magnetic susceptibility, GRA density, NGR, thermal conductivity, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, color reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetr y (RSC), and MAD were measured on whole-round sections, splitcore sections, and discrete samples from Site U1514. Several uniqu e features were identifiable using the physical property data, including distinct signals in the NGR (Figure F6), magnetic susceptibility, and GRA density near the $_{\mathrm{Cl9r}}$ event $\sim\!152\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), the Paleocene–Eocene interval $^{'}{\sim}275{-}280\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), the Cretaceous/Paleogene  boundary $382{-}415~\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A),  and  the  Cenomanian– Turonian interval (415–445 m CSF-A). However, the latter is withi n a zone of soft-sediment deformation possibly associated wit h slumping.  

Magnetic susceptibility values vary between 1.76 and 50.48 I U and consist of sections of high- and low-frequency variations downhole. Bulk density estimated from GRA ranges from 1.6 to 1. 9 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . NGR ranges from 0 to 105 counts/s with high-amplitude cyclic fluctuations downhole, which is coincident with changes in sediment RSC. The bulk density, grain density, and porosity of core d material were measured on discrete samples (MAD). These dat a show several deviations from the expected trend. In several sections, porosity increases with depth. This increase may reflect lithologic changes and/or is associated with soft-sediment deformatio n that may have led to several packages of material being more over - or undercompacted than the surrounding beds. $P$ -wave velocitie s range from ${\sim}1500~\mathrm{m/s}$ near the seafloor to ${\sim}2100~\mathrm{m/s}$ at ${\sim}290\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Velocity tends to decrease below this depth to 1800–190 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ at the bottom of the hole $515.7\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ), except for the 390– $470\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A interval, where velocities are scattered between 180 0 and $2300\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , which brackets the zone with soft-sediment deformation.  

Downhole logging was conducted in Hole U1514C using th e modified triple combo tool string. The measurements yielded similar results for the overlapping depth intervals when core recover y was good. The downhole tools provided continuous coverage of th e borehole and filled several coring gaps. The most striking feature s include several peaks in NGR at ${\sim}395$ , ${\sim}425$ , and ${\sim}445\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ and between 455 and $480\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WMSF}$ . Interestingly, the two peaks i n the NGR log at ${\sim}395$ and ${\sim}425\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF correspond to a decreas e in bulk density, sonic velocity, and resistivity, as well as more cla y rich lithofacies. There are also notable slower sonic velocities between 420 and $440\mathrm{\;m\;WMSF},$ , which could (at least partially) reflec t a thick zone of soft-sediment deformation associated with possibl e slumping. Magnetic susceptibility data were collected in Hol e U1514C, but the signal quality was poor. In addition, in situ temperature measurements were obtained in Hole U1514A and wer e combined with the thermal conductivity data to determine hea t flow $(45{-}49\mathrm{\;mW/m^{2}})$ ).  

# Geochemistry  

The Site U1514 geochemistry program was designed to characterize the composition of interstitial water and bulk sediments an d to assess the potential presence of volatile hydrocarbons for routin e safety monitoring. Samples were taken from Holes U1514A an d U1514C. A total of 56 headspace gas samples were taken, with onl y low concentrations of methane $(\le\!90\;\mathrm{ppmv})$ and trace levels of ethane detected.  

For interstitial water analyses, 54 samples were recovered fro m whole-round squeezing of sediment intervals from Holes U1514 A (0–247.7 m CSF-A) and U1514C (255.0–515.7 m CSF-A). Sampl e salinity is generally constant, with the exception of distinctly freshe r interstitial water in lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIa (Figure F6). Thi s low-salinity interval reflects decreased concentrations of many elemental profiles, particularly $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ and Cl−, and an input of fresher water. The dissolved Mg, K, Ca, Li, Sr, and Na concentration profile s reflect alteration of volcanic material from depths below the core d interval for Site U1514. Moderate sulfate reduction was detecte d because sulfate is present but decreases with depth, and Ba concentrations are correspondingly low. Dissolved Si reflects the presenc e of biogenic opal-A in lithostratigraphic Units I and II and the to p part of Subunit IIIa; lower concentrations at the bottom of Subuni t IIIa and in Subunit IIIb may reflect the opal-A/CT transition. Periodic elevated Mn and Fe concentrations demonstrate the reducin g character of the sedimentary sequence at certain intervals at thi s site.  

A total of 64 bulk sediment samples were collected downhole t o ${\sim}513\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Core 369-U1514C-35R). Additional samples wer e measured from the putative OAE 2 and 1d intervals. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ conten t varies from 0 to $90~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , reflecting variations in lithology (Figur e F6). TOC is generally less than $0.3\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , except in the OAE 1d interval where TOC reached $1.2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ . TN is generally below the detection limit. A total of 8 working-half samples from the potential OA E 2 and 1d intervals were analyzed on the source rock analyzer. Although the lower TOC content samples were generally inconclusive, kerogen in samples with higher concentrations of TO C $(>\!1\;\mathrm{wt\%})$ were found to be predominantly terrestrial in source.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Three holes were cored at Site U1514. Recovery in Hole U1514 A was excellent (near $100\%$ ), and the total recovery of Holes U1514 A and U1514C was $65\%$ . Target depths were recommended before an d during the coring of Hole U1514C, which aided the bridging of coring gaps in Hole U1514A. A splice was created for the overlappin g portion of the lower Eocene, spanning 195.6 to $266.1\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CCSF}$ i n Holes U1514A and U1514C. This splice was established by identifying similar trends in NGR and subsequent comparison of high-resolution physical property data. Recognition of sharp peaks in NG R enabled correlation of core data to wireline logging results and confirmed the accuracy of the splice.  

Together, Holes U1514A and U1514C span the end-Albian t o the present, with good coverage over much of the Paleogene an d Upper Cretaceous, including a seemingly complete record over th e $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary in Core 369-U1514C-23R. Downcore, a multicolored interval of deformed sediments spanning Cores 25R throug h 29R is consistent with the downslope motion of the upper portio n of the sequence at this site.  

# Age-depth model and sedimentation rates  

Sediment accumulation rates vary throughout the section, wit h the lowest values recorded in the Neogene and Cretaceous (3– 9 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{M}\mathbf{y})$ and the highest values ( $13{-}15\;\mathrm{m/My})$ recorded in the Eocen e and Paleocene (Figure F6). Major unconformities are present in th e lower Pleistocene, Pliocene, Miocene, and Oligocene. The sedimen t accumulation rate is quite low for the Oligocene and Miocene interval $({\sim}0.13\mathrm{~cm/ky})$ , moderate for the Eocene and Paleocene interval $({\sim}1.0\,\mathrm{~cm/ky})$ , and modest for most of the Cretaceous interval $({\sim}0.29\,\mathrm{cm/ky})$ .  

# Site U1515  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1515 is the westernmost and shallowest site targete d during Expedition 369 with the primary objective to provide evidence of the prebreakup rifting history in the region prior to the final separation of Greater India and Antarctica. The site locatio n was chosen based on seismic evidence of dipping strata below wha t is interpreted to be the eastward extension of the Valanginian unconformity cored at Site U1513 in the western MB. The extrusiv e basalts that cover this unconformity in the western MB are no t present at Site U1515.  

Structural interpretations suggest that depocenters in the eastern MB are older (Permian? to Jurassic) than those in the wester n MB (Jurassic?) (Borissova et al., 2002). Site U1515 is the first sampling of this eastern depocenter and will test the hypothesis of earl y Mesozoic rifting. Cores recovered from this site will enable the investigation of the tectonic and structural relationships with similarly aged rifts along the western margin of Australia, in particula r the adjacent Perth Basin (Bradshaw et al., 2003), and rift structure s in Antarctica (Maritati et al., 2016). Finally, the cored record will ascertain the provenance of these earlier (Jurassic?) sediments as possibly sourced from the Pinjarra orogen or Albany-Frazer province.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The cored section of Hole U1515A, the only hole at Site U1515 , is divided into two main lithostratigraphic units (I and II; Figur e F7), which are further divided into five subunits (Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, an d IIc). Lithostratigraphic units and boundaries are defined by change s in lithology as identified by macroscopic core description, microscopic examination of smear slides and thin sections, and XRD an d XRF analyses. Unit thicknesses are not given because of the overall low core recovery. Lithostratigraphic Unit I (Cores 1R through 15R ) is a sequence of calcareous ooze/chalk with sponge spicules, silicified limestone, bioclastic limestone, chert, sandy limestone, an d sandstone (arkose). Subunit Ia (Cores 1R through 8R) consists o f light greenish gray calcareous ooze with sponge spicules, wherea s Subunit Ib (Cores 9R through 15R) is generally more lithified an d consists largely of calcareous chalk and $10{-}40~\mathrm{cm}$ thick silicifie d limestone with frequent chert beds. Because of poor recovery i n this interval, the contact between Units I and II was not recovered. Unit II (Cores 24R through 55R) largely consists of gray to blac k silty sand and glauconitic sandstones/silty sandstones. Subunit II a (Cores 24R through 36R) is characterized by abundant glauconit e and consists of black to greenish gray silty sand and sandstone. Subunit IIb (Cores 37R through 41R) consists largely of fine- to coarsegrained sandstones with interbedded siltstone and claystone. Thi s subunit differs from Subunit IIa in that it contains less glauconit e and more abundant pyrite nodules. Subunit IIb gradually transitions to organic-rich silty sandstone and claystone with coal an d plant debris, which are characteristic components of Subunit II c (Cores 44R through 55R). The sediments recovered in Unit II ar e possibly terrestrial in origin.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Hole U1515A core catcher samples were analyzed for calcareou s nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers. Observations were recorded for other distinctive and potentiall y age or environmentally diagnostic microfossil groups, including calcispheres, radiolarians, pollen grains and spores, fish debris, spong e spicules, and inoceramid prisms.  

Microfossils occur in the upper part of the hole (Cores 1 R through 15R), whereas the lower part (Cores 16R through 49R; n o samples were taken deeper than Core 49R) is barren of all calcareous and siliceous microfossil groups. However, a spore found in  a smear slide of Sample 39R-1, $97~\mathrm{cm}$ , was identified as Contignisporites sp. (likely Contignisporites glebulentus), which could indicat e an age of Pliensbachian or younger. Most of the Neogene and Paleogene samples (Cores 1R through 14R) indicate reworking of Pliocene, Miocene, Oligocene, and Eocene species. The nannofossi l biostratigraphy of Hole U1515A spans from upper Pleistocene Subzone CN14b to upper Campanian Zone CC22. Planktonic foraminiferal assemblages are in good agreement with this stratigraphi c determination, spanning from the upper Pleistocene Subzone Ptl b through the late Campanian/late Santonian Globigerinelloides impensus Zone. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages indicate an oute r neritic to upper bathyal paleodepth throughout the analyzed interval (Figure F7).  

# Paleomagnetism  

The NRM of most of the archive-half core sections and 19 discrete samples collected from the working halves of Hole U1515 A was determined (Figure F7). The archive halves were stepwis e treated with up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization and measured wit h the pass-through SRM at $5\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals. Discrete samples were progressively demagnetized up to $60\;\mathrm{mT}$ and measured with the SRM. The NRM intensity of the recovered cores is in the order of $10^{-5}$ t o $1\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ and broadly covaries with lithology. Inclinations after th e $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step exhibit intervals dominated by positiv e and negative inclination values, defining a brief magnetic polarit y sequence from Chron C1n (Brunhes) to Subchron C1r.2r. Althoug h the magnetic record is noisy and the core recovery is poor, interval s of predominantly normal and reversed polarity can be discerned i n the remainder of the sections deeper than $20\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. However,  a correlation to the GPTS is not possible mainly because of the poo r core recovery and the lack of biostratigraphic control.  

# Petrophysics  

Site U1515 had overall low core recovery $(18\%)$ , so physica l property data is sparse and discontinuous, particularly betwee n $\mathord{\sim}130$ and ${\sim}270\mathrm{\m\,CSF{-}A}$ . Despite the quality of the record, the dat a show very broad trends from the top to the bottom of the hole, an d some comparisons can be made between physical property data an d lithology, including a general increase in $P$ -wave velocity and thermal conductivity, which corresponds to a change from unlithified t o weakly lithified glauconitic sand, sandstone and interbedded siltstone, and claystone (lithostratigraphic Subunits IIa and IIb) to silt y sandstone and claystone with coal and plant debris (Subunit IIc). This change in velocity also corresponds to a 364–373 m CSF-A unconformity identified in seismic images. Other broad trends includ e an overall increase in thermal conductivity, an increase in bulk an d grain densities, and an overall decrease in porosity. The color reflection and bulk density data are noisy, but they show some trends tha t can be correlated with lithostratigraphic units. Similarly, the NG R (Figure F7) and magnetic susceptibility data also show broad trend s and potentially highlight zones where changes in lithology occu r (e.g., the highest magnetic susceptibility values, high bulk density, and low NGR values at ${\sim}270\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A correspond to glauconiti c sandstone).  

# Geochemistry  

The Site U1515 geochemistry program was designed to characterize the composition of interstitial water and bulk sediments an d to assess the potential presence of volatile hydrocarbons for routin e safety monitoring. No gas was detected in the 38 headspace ga s samples that were taken.  

For interstitial water analyses, 17 samples were recovered fro m whole-round squeezing of sediment intervals at 2.9–77.1 an d $287.8–441.60\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Sampling was restricted due to low core recovery at Site U1515, which limits interstitial water interpretation. Sample salinity is generally constant, and alkalinity generally decreases downhole. The dissolved Mg, K, and Ca concentration profiles possibly reflect alteration of volcanic material from depth s below the cored interval for this site. Increasing Sr concentration s with depth in lithostratigraphic Unit I may indicate carbonate recrystallization. Low levels of sulfate reduction were detected; sulfat e is present but decreases with depth. Dissolved Si reflects the presence of biogenic opal-A in Unit I; lower concentrations in Unit I I indicate the interval falls below the opal-A/CT transition (Figur e F7). Elevated Mn and Fe concentrations in Unit II demonstrate th e reducing character of the sedimentary sequence in that interval.  

A total of 33 bulk sediment samples were collected downhole t o ${\sim}511\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Core 369-U1515A-55R). Within the intervals wit h carbon-rich layers, small chips were taken from the carbon-ric h parts for analysis. Carbonate content is very high $({\sim}80{-}90~\mathrm{wt\%})$ i n the upper part but drops to nearly $0\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ deeper than $160\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A (Figure F7). Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIa and shallower contain s $0{-}2.4~\mathrm{wt\%}$ TOC, whereas Subunits IIb and IIc contain as much a s $46.2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ TOC (likely coal fragments). TN is $<\!0.05\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in Subunit s Ia, Ib, and IIa but exceeds $0.3\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ at four horizons in Subunits II b and IIc, showing a pattern similar to that of TOC. In most sample s with higher TOC $(>\!1\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ , the kerogen was found to be predominantly terrestrial in origin, except for the ${\sim}430{-}460\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF}.$ A interval, where a more significant algal contribution is suggested.  

# Site U1516  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1516 is located in the south-central MB. Objectives fo r drilling at Site U1516 were to (1) obtain a continuous and expande d Cenozoic and Upper Cretaceous pelagic carbonate sediment recor d in the MB to reconstruct climatic shifts across the rise and fall of th e Turonian and early Eocene hot greenhouse climates, (2) determin e the relative roles of productivity, ocean temperature, and ocean circulation at high southern latitudes during Cretaceous anoxic event s and across the PETM, and (3) characterize how oceanographic conditions changed during the Cenozoic opening of the Tasman Passage and the restriction of the Indonesian Gateway. The Site U151 6 sequence will be compared with coeval Expedition 369 section s cored elsewhere on the MB and with other IODP and industry dat a from the southern and western Australia margins to correlate recovered lithologies with seismic lines across the MB and to identif y regional differences in the geochemical biological responses to th e OAEs, Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene ocean circulation history.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1516 is divided into four main lithostratigraphic units (I, II, III, and IV; Figure F8), with Unit I divided into three subunits (Ia, Ib, and Ic). Lithostratigraphic units and boundaries are defined b y changes in lithology as identified by macroscopic core description, microscopic examination of smear slides and thin sections, an d XRD and XRF analyses. Lithostratigraphic Unit I is a sequence o f calcareous/foraminiferal/nannofossil oozes and chalks with spong e spicules that is Pleistocene to Paleocene in age. Subunit Ia consist s of pinkish white, pinkish gray, and very pale orange sponge spicule– rich calcareous oozes that are Pleistocene to Miocene in age. Subunit Ib consists of sponge spicule–rich calcareous chalks and calcareous chalks with sponge spicules that span the Miocene to Eocene. The transition between Subunits Ia and Ib is defined by a shift t o higher NGR and bulk density values and a decrease in $L^{\ast}$ values. Subunit Ic, Paleocene in age and consisting of claystones, is likely t o be a condensed interval. An unconformity between the Paleocen e and the Turonian marks the boundary between Units I and II. Uni t II is calcareous chalk interbedded with chert that gradually transitions into light greenish gray and greenish gray nannofossil chal k with clay that is also interbedded with chert. The boundary betwee n Units II and III is placed at the C/T boundary and is marked by th e first occurrence of black laminated claystone at the top of Unit III. Unit III is an alternating sequence of black, greenish gray, and gra y claystone (sometimes with abundant nannofossils) and claye y nannofossil chalk with occasional parallel laminations. Unit I V ranges from the Cenomanian to the Albian and is a sequence o f black and dark greenish gray nannofossil-rich claystone and claystone with nannofossils with subtle alternations in color throughout.  

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Coring at Site U1516 recovered a succession of sediments fro m the Albian through the Pleistocene. Calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers occur throughout thi s succession, with preservation and abundance sufficient to provid e biostratigraphic and paleoecologic information for the entire section. Calcareous nannofossils are abundant to common throughou t the section, with barren samples only in the middle Albian and associated with the C/T boundary. Preservation is generally good t o moderate, with poor preservation associated only with a condense d Paleocene sequence. Reworking of Paleogene taxa into the Neogen e assemblages is common. Preservation of planktonic foraminifers i s generally good at Site U1516, with some samples in the upper Albian ranked as excellent. Abundance is more variable; the Neogene, Paleogene, and Turonian generally contain abundant planktoni c foraminifers, whereas the Albian contains only rare specimens. Benthic foraminiferal abundance and preservation are also variable. In general, examination of benthic foraminifers indicates a bathya l paleodepth during the Albian through Cenozoic.  

# Paleomagnetism  

We measured the NRM of all archive-half core sections fro m Holes U1516A, U1516C, and U1516D (Figure F8). The archiv e halves were stepwise treated with up to $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetizatio n and measured with the pass-through SRM at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals. Th e NRM intensity of the recovered sedimentary cores is in the order o f $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-1}\,\mathrm{\A/m},$ , and lithostratigraphic Unit I, which consists o f mainly calcareous oozes and chalk, generally displays weak magnetism. Despite the weak NRM of the calcareous oozes/chalk of Unit I, inclinations after $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization show zones of dominantl y positive and negative values, defining a magnetic polarity sequenc e from Chrons C1n (Brunhes) through C22r for the upper ${\sim}430\;\mathrm{m}$ interval, with a total of 84 identified and dated reversals. The magnetic polarity sequence is interrupted by a sedimentary hiatus a t ${\sim}270\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A  based  on  biostratigraphic  constraints.  Belo w ${\sim}430\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, inclinations of Units II–IV, which mainly consist o f claystones, exhibit predominantly negative values, indicating a normal polarity. The normal polarity zone spans from ${\sim}430$ to $525\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and is assigned to Chron $C34\mathrm{n}$ , the long Cretaceous Normal Superchron, based on shipboard biostratigraphic analysis.  

# Petrophysics  

Site U1516 physical property data were collected from Hole s U1516A, U1516C, and U1516D. Thermal conductivity shows a minor overall increase downhole, whereas porosity and $P$ -wave velocity show a minor overall decrease downhole. In comparison, there i s very little variation of bulk and grain density downhole. Exception s are within the interval between 380 and $460\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, which show s a pronounced excursion toward higher values in bulk density, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity; a minor excursion towar d higher values in grain density; and a strong excursion to lower values in porosity. This interval also corresponds to an interval of relatively high magnetic susceptibility and the top of an interval o f increasing NGR (Figure F8). Despite the strong correlation betwee n physical properties, this interval does not correlate to lithostratigraphic unit boundaries. NGR and magnetic susceptibility sho w similar overall trends throughout Site U1516, increasing when th e lithology becomes richer in detrital components. At the transitio n between lithostratigraphic Units II and III ( ${\sim}470\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), bot h NGR and magnetic susceptibility increase when approaching th e black shale interval related to OAE 2. Enrichment in U is notabl e after deconvolution of the NGR. In Unit IV, similar features hav e been found in the evolution of both proxies with Site U1513, allowing correlations between these two sites.  

# Geochemistry  

The Site U1516 geochemistry program was designed to characterize the composition of interstitial water and bulk sediments an d to assess the potential presence of volatile hydrocarbons for routin e safety monitoring. No gas was detected in the 57 headspace ga s samples that were taken.  

For interstitial water analyses, 52 samples were recovered fro m whole-round squeezing from Holes U1516A $0{-}223.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ) and U1516C (244.0–541.6 m CSF-A). Sample salinity is generall y constant, with the exception of distinctly fresher interstitial water i n lithostratigraphic Unit IV (Figure F8). This low-salinity interval reflects decreased concentrations in many elemental profiles, particularly $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ , and an input of fresher water. The dissolved Mg, K, and Ca concentration profiles possibly reflect alteration of volcani c material from depths below the cored interval for this site. The S r profile likely reflects carbonate diagenesis. Low levels of sulfate reduction were detected; sulfate is present but decreases with depth. Dissolved Si reflects the presence of biogenic opal-A in lithologi c Subunit Ia; decreasing concentrations deeper than Subunit Ib indicate the opal-A/CT transition. Elevated Mn (Figure F8) and Fe concentrations  in  parts  of  Subunits  Ia  and  Ib  and  Units  II–I V demonstrate the reducing character of the sedimentary sequence i n these intervals.  

A total of 43 bulk sediment samples were collected downhole t o ${\sim}540\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Additional samples were measured from the suggested OAE 2 interval. $C a C O_{3}$ content varies from 0 to $94\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ , reflecting variations in lithology. TOC is $0{-}1.2\,\mathrm{~wt}\%$ , except in th e OAE 2 interval where TOC reaches $14\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TN is generally belo w the detection limit.  

Eleven samples including one from the putative OAE 2 blac k shale were also analyzed using the source rock analyzer. The sampl e from the top of the $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick black interval indicates Type II kerogen, whereas samples with low $(<\!2\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ TOC from the OAE 2 interval and Unit IV are composed primarily of Type IV kerogen. $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ values indicate thermal immaturity.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Cores from Hole U1516A provide a $225\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, continuous record of middle Miocene to recent deposition, and the sequenc e seems to be biostratigraphically and magnetostratigraphically complete. In Hole U1516C, coring gaps limit knowledge of the lowe r Miocene, much of the Oligocene, and portions of the Eocene at thi s site, but both the Oligocene/Miocene boundary interval and a $30\;\mathrm{m}$ long interval of the upper Eocene were well recovered. In addition, much of the Upper Cretaceous, all of the Paleocene, and much o f the lower and middle Eocene are either missing or represented in  a $15\,\textrm{m}$ thick interval of condensed deposition and/or erosion an d nondeposition spanning from Section 369-U1516C-26R-4, $106\;\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , to the top of Core 25R. In contrast, an excellent record of the uppe r Albian to the middle Turonian was recovered between Hole s U1516C and U1516D, including a seemingly complete splice acros s the OAE 2 interval.  

# Age-depth model and sedimentation rates  

The Neogene has an average sediment accumulation rate of ${\sim}18$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{M}\mathbf{y}$ from the Pleistocene through the upper Miocene (Figure F8). Much of the middle and lower Miocene are missing at a disconformity with an estimated 8 My hiatus. The lowermost Miocene an d uppermost Oligocene are present at this site, separated from th e lower Oligocene by a disconformity with ${\sim}4$ My missing. The lowe r Oligocene through middle Eocene has an average accumulation rat e of ${\sim}8~\mathrm{m/My}$ . This sequence is separated from the Turonian by  a condensed interval containing several biostratigraphic units of th e middle Paleocene. The lower Paleocene through upper Turonian i s missing at a disconformity with a hiatus of at least 29 My. The middle Turonian through upper Albian has an average sediment accumulation rate of ${\sim}8\mathrm{~m/My}$ .  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 369 met the proposed science objectives and exceeded many during its investigation of the tectonic, paleoclimatic, and paleoceanographic history of the GAB and the MB. Sedimen t recovered from sites drilled in both regions will provide a new perspective on Earth’s temperature variation at subpolar latitudes $(60^{\circ}-$ $62^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ) during the rise and fall of the mid-Cretaceous and early Eocene hothouse climates and ensuing paleoceanographic and bioti c changes. The recovered sediment will also provide constraints o n the timing of rifting and basin subsidence during the last phase o f breakup among remnant Gondwana continents. The following is  a discussion of how the objectives and additional discoveries were attained for each of the primary goals:  

1. Investigate the timing and causes for the rise and collapse of the Cretaceous hot greenhouse and how this climate mode affected the climate-ocean system and oceanic biota.  

Recovery of Cretaceous sediments that yielded foraminifer s showing minimal diagenetic alteration was a major goal of Expedition 369 because these samples are essential for reliable Cretaceou s climate reconstructions. We achieved this objective at Sites U1512– U1514, and U1516 (Figures F9, F10, F11, F12). The sequence tha t will yield the most continuous Cretaceous climate record range s from the middle Albian through the early Campanian $({\sim}28~\mathrm{My})$ a t Site U1513, adjacent to where Site 258 was drilled with only $22\%$ Cretaceous sediment recovery (Luyendyk and Davies, 1974). Importantly, analysis of Cenomanian sediments yielding good microfossil preservation at Sites U1513, U1514, and U1516 will fill  a critical temporal gap in the climate record at southern high latitudes. Moreover, good core recovery and microfossil preservatio n in portions of the Santonian–Turonian at Site U1512, Coniacian– Turonian and late Albian at Sites U1513 and U1514, and most of th e Santonian–early Campanian at Site U1513 will significantly improve reconstructions of the climatic and oceanographic change s that occurred across the rise and fall of the hot Cretaceous greenhouse climate.  

2. Determine the relative roles of productivity, ocean temperature, and ocean circulation at high southern latitudes during Cretaceous OAEs.  

One of the most important goals of Expedition 369 was to obtain stratigraphically complete and well-preserved sediment records spanning OAE 2 ${\sim}93.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ; Meyers et al., 2012) and OAE 1 d $_{\left({\sim100.2\ M a}\right)}^{\left({}\right)}$ ; Erbacher and Thurow, 1997; Bréhéret, 1988, 1997; Leckie et al., 2002). These short-lived $({<}1\,\mathrm{My})$ episodes of enhance d deposition of organic carbon are associated with carbon isotope excursions and high rates of species turnover (Jenkyns, 1980, 2010; Arthur et al., 1988; Leckie et al., 2002; Jenkyns et al., 2012, 2017). The sediment records cored at Sites U1513, U1514, and U1516 exceeded our expectations for this objective. Complete and well-preserved microfossil assemblages were recovered from above, below, and within the OAE 2 and 1d intervals, together with laminate d black shale beds. Some authors have suggested that OAE 2, whic h spans the $C/\mathrm{T}$ boundary $(\sim\!94\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , was triggered by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ outgassin g during a widespread pulse of volcanism (Turgeon and Creaser, 2008; Du Vivier et al., 2014). The $97\%$ composite recovery acros s OAE 2 in Holes U1513A and U1513D and $100\%$ recovery in Hole s U1516A and U1516C provide a unique opportunity to study thi s event in greater detail than any OAE 2 sequence in the world because of the abundance and good preservation of calcareous microfossils and organic biomarkers across the interval. Cores fro m across this interval at both sites include multiple black shale intervals with high TOC content (Figure F11). Osmium isotope measurements through the cored sequence will determine the timing o f eruptions prior to, during, and after the event. Oxygen isotope analyses of well-preserved benthic and planktonic foraminifers shoul d determine for the first time whether oceanic warming was triggere d by a volcanic event and whether predicted cooling followed th e burial of organic carbon during the peak of the OAE (Jenkyns et al.,  

2017). Measurement of additional chemical proxies and study of th e microfossil assemblages for both OAEs will characterize changes i n carbon chemistry, nutrient flux, types and amount of organic carbon burial, and changes in microfossil assemblages. Results fro m study of the OAE intervals cored at Sites U1513–U1514 and U151 6 will provide a significant advance in our understanding of the caus e and effects of these global anoxic events. A final additional bonu s was the recovery of the relatively little studied mid-Cenomania n event at Sites U1513 and U1516.  

3. Identify the main source regions for deep-water and intermediate water masses in the southeast Indian Ocean and how these changed during Gondwana breakup.  

Several intervals cored during Expedition 369 will be investigated using εNd to trace sources and circulation patterns of deepwater masses (and thus changing connections between basins), a s well as local weathering inputs and potential global influences suc h as hydrothermal input from large igneous province volcanism. Fo r the Cenomanian in general and the OAE 2 interval in particular, εNd patterns obtained from sediments cored at Sites U1513 an d U1516 will provide a geographically distant test between competin g volcanic and circulation models developed for the North Atlantic. Integration of deep circulation among basins and the increasing importance of the Southern Ocean as a deep-water source can be temporally constrained by comparing εNd values and trends in the M B cores to values documented elsewhere. Finally, the timing and regional importance of the opening of the Tasman Gateway and th e evolution of Antarctic circulation patterns across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary can be determined from εNd values obtained fro m sediment cores at Site U1514 on the northern MB.  

4. Characterize how oceanographic conditions changed at the MB during the Cenozoic opening of the Tasman Passage and restriction of the Indonesian Gateway.  

The opening of the Tasman Passage and restriction of the Indonesian Passage were major factors that influenced the evolution o f global climate during the Cenozoic, and both oceanic gatewa y changes profoundly affected the climate of Australia and Antarctica. The Eocene opening of the Drake Passage and the Tasma n Gateway led to development of the cold ACC that isolated Antarctica from warm equatorial currents, resulting in the buildup of  a continental ice sheet in Antarctica (Bijl et al., 2013; Scher et al., 2006). Northward movement of Australia toward equatorial water s during the Miocene caused substantial reorganization of ocean current pathways in the Indian Ocean and major shifts in the climate o f Australia (Gallagher et al., 2017; Groeneveld et al., 2017). Continue d northward movement restricted current circulation across the Indonesian Gateway during the Pliocene, which then reduced the influence of the warm-water Indonesian Throughflow in the India n Ocean and initiated the arid climate that characterizes moder n western Australia (Christensen et al. 2017).  

Because of the mid-latitude location, Cenozoic sedimentation i n the MB has been particularly sensitive to northern and souther n movements of Antarctic waters and changes in oceanic gatewa y passages that connect the western equatorial Pacific Ocean with th e Indian Ocean. Study of Eocene deposits recovered at Sites U151 4 and U1516 will further our understanding of the oceanographic an d climatic consequences of the opening of the Tasman Passage. Highresolution studies of Miocene and Pliocene sediments recovere d from Sites U1513, U1415 and U1516 will establish the timing, magnitude, and rates of climate and ocean circulation changes that affected the Australian continent and the southeast Indian Ocea n region as the seaway between Australia and Antarctica widened an d deepened and the Indonesian Passage became more restricted.  

5. Resolve questions on the volcanic and sedimentary origins of the basin and provide vital stratigraphic control on the age and nature of the prebreakup succession.  

Sampling the prebreakup sediments was achieved at Site U1515 . The margin-wide unconformity was crossed at $364~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, an d coring sampled a series of carbon-rich claystones interspersed wit h poorly cemented sandstone in a fault-bounded segment of the eastern MB. These claystones are believed to be of Early Jurassic age deposited during the early stages of rifting within Gondwana, whic h was undergoing a period of thermal subsidence following an earlie r Permian rifting event (Bradshaw et al., 2003). Tilting of these sediments is indicative of a later stage of rifting and fault reactivation i n the mid- to Late Jurassic.  

Our deepest hole (U1513E) cored ${\sim}84\mathrm{~m~}$ of volcanic materia l and recovered ${\sim}54\;\mathrm{m}$ of material. Onboard analysis identified separate extrusive flow sequences intercalated with sedimentary brecci a beds that were later intruded by a younger diabase dike. The olde r extrusive volcanics appear to be a mix of subaerial and marin e flows, which suggests they were deposited close to sea level. Isotopic dating of the volcanics was not possible on board, althoug h stratigraphic relations mean that the extrusive flows are older tha n the overlaying mid-Valanginian sediments as dated by magnetostratigraphy. Volcanic activity, as evidenced from the intersectin g seismic profiles as either isolated bright reflectors that are interpreted as sills or as volcanic cones, appears to be present throug h lithostratigraphic Unit V, which is dated as Valanginian to Barremian. Although the basalt sequences are highly altered, we anticipate that enough material has been collected for $\mathrm{{Ar/Ar}}$ analysis to a t least date some of the flows and dike. Results will be compared wit h a recent compilation of basalt samples from both nearby dredge an d onland sampling of the Bunbury basalt (Direen et al., 2017; Olieroo k et al., 2016).  

All Expedition 369 sites contribute to significantly improvin g the stratigraphic control of the regional reflection seismic data. Sit e U1512 recalibrates the current seismic interpretation and hence th e role of the Wallaroo Fault System as an active fault synchronou s with the initial phase of seafloor spreading between Antarctica an d Australia. Sediments cored at sites around the MB enable dating o f key stratigraphic units that record the rifting of both India and Antarctica from Australia that can be correlated to the regional seismi c reflection data. Erosional hiatuses and faults in the sedimentar y succession can now be dated and linked with episodes of uplift, erosion, and subsidence, which in turn can be linked to the wider tectonic and thermal histories of this margin.  

# Operations  

# Port call and initial transit to Site U1512  

Expedition 369 officially began at $0754\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC~+~11~h)}$ on 2 6 September 2017 with the first line ashore at Macquarie Wharf, Berth 4, in Hobart, Australia. The ship cleared immigration an d customs, and Expedition 369 technical staff, the Expedition Projec t Manager, and the Co-Chief Scientists boarded the ship at $0930~\mathrm{h}$ . The remainder of the science party boarded the vessel on 27 September, and public relations activities were conducted on 28 and 2 9 September. During the port call, the loading of drilling equipment, expedition stores, and food was completed, and installation of  a spare wireline logging cable was concluded. The ship left Hobar t with the last line released at $0710~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 September and bega n making its way to Site U1512. The $1425\ \mathrm{nmi}$ sea voyage ended a t $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}+8\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 7 October.  

# Site U1512  

Site U1512 (Table T1) consisted of a single hole (U1512A) tha t was cored with the RCB system. The original plan was to advance t o $570~\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF); however, it became apparent during coring operations that the Late Cretaceous sedimentary section was very expanded. Following revisions to coring dept h estimates and Environmental Protection and Safety Panel approval, the hole was deepened to $700\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Coring operations and conditions were excellent although the hole deviated $\sim\!26^{\circ}$ from vertica l through what was fairly uniform lithology. After coring operation s were completed, one downhole logging run was completed alon g the entire open borehole with the modified triple combo tool string, which measured NGR, density, resistivity, and velocity. Logging operations and conditions were also excellent.  

Overall, 7.7 days (7–14 October 2017) were spent at Site U1512. A total of $73\;\mathrm{RCB}$ cores were recorded for the site, penetrating to  a total depth of $700.8\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and recovering $631.86\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(90\%$ recovery).  

# Site U1513  

Site U1513 (Table T1) consisted of coring and logging operations at five holes and was visited on two separate occasions. All o f the coring systems were used: both the APC and half-length AP C (HLAPC) systems in Holes U1513A–U1513C, the XCB system i n Hole U1513A, and the RCB system in Holes U1513D and U1513E. Coring extended to $292.5\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF in Hole U1513A and crossed on e of the critical boundaries for the expedition (C/T boundary). In sit u formation temperatures were attempted with the advanced pisto n corer temperature tool (APCT-3), but only one value was returne d for Core 369-U1513A-5H because the tool was damaged. Hol e U1513B was intended to fill in recovery gaps from the Neogene an d uppermost Cretaceous section from Hole U1513A and was cored t o $98.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF; all cores were oriented with either the Icefield MI- 5 core orientation tool or the FlexIT tool. Hole U1513C cores wer e sectioned on the catwalk into $30~\mathrm{\cm}$ whole rounds for postexpedition analyses. Hole U1513D penetrated to $757.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF an d accomplished the deep target of the expedition objectives by recovering basalt; Hole U1513E then extended the basalt penetration an d recovery to $774~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Downhole logging runs were attempted i n Holes U1513A, U1513D, and U1513E. After coring operations wer e completed in Hole U1513A, one downhole logging run was completed along the entire length of the open borehole (to $289.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF) with the modified triple combo tool string, and runs with i t were also attempted in Holes U1513D (to $346\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF) and U1513 E from 426 to $614~\mathrm{m}$ WSF. One run with the traditional triple comb o tool string was also performed from 119 to $610\,\textrm{m}$ WSF in Hol e U1513E. A seismic experiment and FMS runs were also conducte d in Hole U1513E from 426 to $637\textrm{m}$ WSF (VSI) and 426 to $611\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF (FMS).  

Overall, 15.5 days (18 October–2 November and 20–25 November 2017) were spent at Site U1513. A total of 18 APC, 13 HLAPC, $35\,\mathrm{XCB}$ , and 81 RCB cores were recorded for the site, penetrating t o a total depth of $774~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Of the $1137.8\mathrm{~m~}$ cored, we recovere d $777.07\;\mathrm{m}$ of material $\left(80.8\%\right)$ .  

# Site U1514  

Site U1514 (Table T1) consisted of coring and logging operations in three holes. All four of the coring systems were used. Th e piston coring (APC and HLAPC) and XCB systems were used i n Hole U1514A, Hole U1514B was cored with the APC system only, and the RCB system was used in Hole U1514C. Hole U1514A extended to $255.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, at which point the XCB was unable to penetrate deeper. All cores recovered with the APC system in Hol e U1514A were oriented with either the Icefield MI-5 core orientatio n tool or FlexIT tool. Cores recovered from Hole U1514B were completely sectioned on the catwalk into $30~\mathrm{{cm}}$ whole-round section s for postexpedition analyses. Hole U1514C penetrated to $516.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and was successfully logged with the modified triple comb o tool string.  

Overall, 7.4 days (2–9 November 2017) were spent at Sit e U1514. A total of 21 APC, 5 HLAPC, 7 XCB, and $34\,\mathrm{RCB}$ cores wer e recorded for the site, penetrating to a total depth of $516.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. O f the $591.9\;\mathrm{m}$ cored, $518.12\;\mathrm{m}$ of material was recovered $(87.5\%)$ .  

# Site U1515  

Operations at Site U1515 (Table T1) consisted of coring a singl e hole (U1515A) with the RCB system to $517.1\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. The original plan for this site included coring three holes and a full suite of wireline logging runs. However, hole conditions were generally poor, which precluded logging, and core recovery was low, thus shortening the time spent at this site.  

Overall, $55~\mathrm{RCB}$ cores were recovered with $93.62\textrm{m}$ recovere d from the $517.1~\mathrm{m}$ cored $(18.1\%)$ . The total time on Site U1515 wa s 3.6 days (10–13 November 2017).  

# Site U1516  

Four holes were cored at Site U1516. Hole U1516A was core d with the APC and HLAPC systems to $223.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. All cores recovered with the APC system in Hole U1516A (Cores 1H through 20H ) were oriented with the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool or FlexI T tool. Successful in situ formation temperature measurements wer e made with the APCT-3 in Cores 369-U1516-3H, 5H, 7H, and 17H. Hole U1516B was cored with the APC system to ${\sim}15~\mathrm{m};$ all of th e material was immediately sectioned on the catwalk in $30\;\mathrm{cm}$ whol e rounds for postexpedition analyses. Hole U1516C, which wa s drilled without coring to $196~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, was then cored with the RC B system to $541.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. Hole U1516D aimed to recover an additional copy of the $C/\mathrm{T}$ boundary. It was drilled without coring t o $458\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF and then cored with the RCB system to $477.6\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF, recovering four cores.  

In total, $476.99\mathrm{~m~}$ was recovered from $605.0\ \mathrm{m}$ cored $(78.8\%)$ . We recovered $206.57\;\mathrm{m}$ from $197.5\;\mathrm{m}$ cored $(104.6\%)$ with the AP C system and recovered $43.55\mathrm{~m~}$ from $42.3\textrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ ) and $226.87\textrm{m}$ from $365.2\:\mathrm{m}\:(62.1\%)$ cored with the RCB system. We spent 5.9 day s at Site U1516. After Site U1516 was completed, we returned to Sit e U1513.  

# Transit to Fremantle, Australia  

At $0525\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 November 2017, the ship was underway to Fremantle, Australia. Expedition 369 ended at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 November.  

# Education, outreach, and media  

Three education and outreach personnel participated in Expedition 369: a museum educator from the US, a videographer fro m Brazil, and a photojournalist from the United Kingdom.  

# Live broadcasts  

During this expedition, 3 museums, 23 schools, and 8 universities participated in live ship-to-shore broadcasts (Table T2). Overall, institutions from nine different countries participated (Brazil, China, France, Germany, Japan, Morocco, Republic of Korea, th e United Kingdom, and the US) and from nine different states in th e US (California, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Texas, and Washington, DC). We reached approximatel y 1514 people through the broadcasts.  

# Survey feedback  

As part of the feedback process, we sent a survey to every grou p that participated in a broadcast. Out of 44 broadcasts, 19 participating groups filled out a survey.  

According to the survey results,  

• The average rating for the participants’ experience was 4.71 out of 5,   
• $100\%$ of participants who completed the survey said they received the opportunity to ask questions,   
• $92\%$ of participants felt that the objectives of the expedition were clearly explained,   
• Participants gave an average score of 4.32 out of 5 in regard to whether they felt the information was presented at a level appropriate to the age of their group,   
• $85\%$ of participants felt that they learned more about science content,   
• $100\%$ of participants felt that they learned more about the science process,   
• $76\%$ of participants felt that they learned more about careers in science, and   
• The average score for participants who felt that the broadcast met their expectations was 4.24 out of 5.  

# Anecdotes from participants about broadcasts  

• “[These broadcasts are a] quick and easy way to explore science careers and real-life applications.”   
• “[These broadcasts are] very important for the young scientists and the international community.”   
• “Our students appreciated this opportunity very much.”   
• “Thank you very much for the broadcast. [The students] enjoyed it a lot, and the explanation of the scientists was clear and very interesting.”   
• “It was a very good and unique experience for everybody here to “be” on board a science ship off the coast of Australia!”   
• “We would like to participate more often.”   
• “I loved that the tour included the both the chemistry lab and core lab. Tours in the past have only focused on the core lab. The diversity was great, and better represented the vessel operations.”   
• “It was engaging for the students, showed them how scientists figured out the things we're learning in class, showed them that scientists are still figuring out new things, and that there are careers in geoscience (and science in general).”

# Media impact  

The education and outreach team worked with various medi a outlets in Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the US, and the expedition was covered by other media sources in several other countries.  

BBC Earth featured several photos of Expedition 369 on thei r Instagram account and Twitter account. We conducted two TV liv e interviews with BBC News and one with BBC Radio, as well as on e live radio interview with the Australia Broadcasting Corporation. I n Brazil, a $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ prerecorded story was produced by BAND Cidade s channel (https://youtu.be/L5WCA19KOqA).  

Additional media coverage included a Reddit Ask Me Anythin g (AMA) session where several of the scientists on board assisted i n fielding questions asked by the public. The questions and answer s can  be  viewed  at  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7b4g8u/science_ama_series_were_scientists_on_a_- ship_off/. There were ${>}1000$ views of the session, with 196 peopl e voting positively for the session $86\%$ of the vote). More than 3 3 questions were asked and answered.  

Smithsonian.com (https://www.smithsonianmag.com), whic h has a circulation of ${>}6$ million per month, commissioned three articles about the expedition for publication soon after the end of th e expedition.  

BBC Future, which has global circulation through BBC Worldwide, commissioned two short $(3{-}4\,\mathrm{min})$ films about the expeditio n that will likely come out in early 2018.

# Social media  

• $+281$ followers on Facebook (between 26 September and 23 November 2017) (Table T3)   
• $+157$ followers on Instagram (between 26 September and 23 November 2017)   
• $+124$ followers and $+195.0\mathrm{K}$ impressions on Twitter (between 26 September and 23 November 2017)  

The increase of organic (not attracted by paid ads) followers i s the most targeted and hardest to achieve by social media conten t producers. These followers are real people willing to engage wit h the brand/institution. Because Facebook and Instagram have algorithms to increase their gains with paid advertisements, they wil l first show the paid content to the users. The numbers shown abov e are very high because we achieved only organic users. This is a sig n that the content is attracting people, and they are important followers of the JOIDES Resolution community.
