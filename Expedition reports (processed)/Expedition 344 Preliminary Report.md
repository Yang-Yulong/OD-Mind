# Abstract  

The Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project (CRISP) is designed to elucidate the processes that control nucleation and seismic rupture of large earthquakes at erosional subduction zones. The CRISP study area is located offshore the Osa Peninsula where the incoming Cocos Ridge has lifted the seismogenic zone to within reach of scientific drilling. This area is characterized by low sediment supply, a fast convergence rate, abundant plate interface seismicity, and a change in subducting plate relief along strike. In addition to elucidating processes at erosional convergent margins, this project is complementary to other deep fault drilling projects (e.g., The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment and J-FAST).  

Expedition 344 is the second expedition of CRISP Program A (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Proposal 537A-Full5), a first step toward deep riser drilling through the seismogenic zone. The focus of CRISP Program A is on the shallow lithologic, hydrologic, stress, and thermal conditions that lead to unstable slip in the seismogenic zone. Together with Expedition 334, the first expedition of CRISP Program A, these data provide exciting insights into the nature of seismogenesis and erosive plate boundaries.  

# Background  

# Seismogenesis at convergent margins  

Convergent margins produce the world’s largest earthquakes and devastating tsunamis as most recently and tragically demonstrated by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. Studies of interplate seismicity have shown that large earthquakes generally initiate within specific depth limits, generally between ${\sim}10$ and $40\ \mathrm{km}$ (Byrne et al., 1988; Pacheco et al., 1993; Tichelaar and Ruff, 1993; Scholz, 2002), but the precise limits vary with temperature (Hyndman et al., 1997). This observation led to a conceptual model in which the subduction thrust can be divided into three zones (e.g., Scholz, 1988). In the shallowest zone, plate convergence is accommodated by stable (aseismic) slip. Here, fault material is fresh, unconsolidated, and characterized by velocity strengthening. The middle section where large earthquakes initiate is characterized by unstable (stick-slip) behavior and is termed the seismogenic zone (Scholz, 2002). Fault zone rocks in this region have transitioned from velocity strengthening to velocity weakening, and shear becomes localized. The onset of seismogenic behavior is correlated with the intersection of the $100^{\circ}–150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ isotherm and the subduction thrust (Hyndman et al., 1997; Oleskevich et al., 1999). With increasing depth down the subduction thrust, the frictional characteristics undergo a second frictional transition either due to the juxtaposition with the forearc mantle or because the rocks are heated to $350^{\circ}–450^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and can no longer store elastic stresses needed for rupture. These transitions are zones of conditional stability that can host rupture but are generally not thought to be regions where large earthquakes initiate.  

Although this three-zone two-dimensional view of the subduction thrust provides a reasonable framework, it is simplistic. Rupture models for large subduction earthquakes suggest significant fault plane heterogeneity in slip and moment release that in three dimensions is characterized as patchiness (Bilek and Lay, 2002). Additionally, we now know the transition zone from stable to unstable sliding is not simple but hosts a range of fault behaviors that includes creep events, strain transients, slow and silent earthquakes, and low-frequency earthquakes (Peng and Gomberg, 2010; Beroza and Ide, 2011; Ide, 2012).  

Fundamentally unknown are the processes that change fault behavior from stable sliding to stick-slip behavior. Understanding these processes is important for understanding earthquakes, the mechanics of slip, and rupture dynamics. For the fault to undergo unstable slip, fault rocks must have the ability to store elastic strain, be velocity weakening, and have sufficient stiffness. Hypotheses for mechanisms leading to the transition between stable and unstable slip invoke temperature, pressure, and strain-activated processes that lead to downdip changes in the mechanical properties of rock. These transitions are also sensitive to fault zone composition, lithology, and fabric.  

The composition of materials in the fault zone and their contrast with surrounding wall rock is a key influence on rock frictional behavior. The frictional state of incoming sediment progressively changes with increasing temperature and pressure as it travels downdip. Important lithological factors influencing friction are composition, fabric, texture, and cementation (Bernabé et al., 1992; Moore and Saffer, 2001; Beeler, 2007; Marone and Saffer, 2007; Collettini et al., 2009). For example, fault rocks with high phyllosilicate content are generally weaker than rocks with low phyllosilicate content (Ikari et al., 2011). Sediment properties including porosity, permeability, consolidation state, and alteration history also exert a strong influence on fault zone behavior. At erosive margins, where the plate boundary cuts up into the overriding plate, the composition and strength of the upper plate is also important (McCaffrey, 1993).  

Field observations and laboratory experiments indicate that a prerequisite for unstable sliding is that incoming sediment must be consolidated and lithified (Davis et al., 1983; Byrne et al., 1988; Marone and Scholz, 1988; Marone and Saffer, 2007; Fagereng and Sibson, 2010). This hypothesis posits that the updip limit of the seismogenic zone occurs near a threshold of consolidation and/or lithification in which fault zone behavior changes from distributed shear (stable sliding), where shear is accommodated by granular processes, to localized shear (unstable slide) along discrete surfaces. The processes of lithification and consolidation depend on fault slip rate, mineralogy, and heat flow.  

Pore pressure within the fault zone is a principal factor in controlling effective stress and strength along the plate interface (Sibson, 1981; Scholz, 1988). In this model, pore pressures in excess of hydrostatic decrease the effective normal stress, thereby limiting the shear stress, and, coupled with the low consolidation and lithification state of sediment in the updip aseismic portion of the fault, may explain the lack of seismicity. A downdip decrease in pore fluid pressure increases the normal stress, leading to greater instability in plate sliding (Scholz, 1988).  

Diagenetic and low-grade metamorphic reactions likely contribute to both lithification and consolidation processes as well as pore pressure (Moore and Saffer, 2001). These reactions lead to clay transformation, carbonate and zeolite cementation, the initiation of pressure solution, and quartz cementation. These processes lead to increasing lithification, a decrease in fluid production with depth that increases the effective stress, and strengthening of the overriding plate, increasing its ability to store elastic strain.  

Variation in subducting plate relief has also been invoked as causing a change in the effective stress, the mechanics of the plate boundary, and the frictional stability of the fault zone (e.g., Scholz and Small, 1997). Detailed bathymetric and seismic data collection in several subduction zones has led to correlations between large earthquake rupture patterns and subducting features such as seamounts and ridges (Bilek et al., 2003; Bilek, 2007). Subducting oceanic ridges and seamounts have been suggested to be both asperities that can be the loci of earthquake nucleation (e.g., Lay and Kanamori, 1981; Lay et al., 1982; Ruff, 1992) or barriers to along-strike earthquake rupture (Kodaira et al., 2000; Hirata et al., 2003; Wang and Bilek, 2011).  

In fact, all of these processes may act in concert to change the frictional properties of the fault zone. Pore fluid pressure, fault rock mineralogy, diagenesis, consolidation, lithification, and subducting plate relief may all play an important role.  

Chief among many reasons the seismogenic zone is poorly understood is that the active seismogenic zone has been inaccessible to geologic sampling. Testing these hypotheses requires obtaining samples of fault zone material in the updip aseismic zone, in the transition zone, and within the seismogenic zone. Advances in drilling technology and the capabilities of the Japanese drilling vessel Chikyu make drilling into the transition and seismogenic zones possible.  

# Erosive and accretionary convergent margins  

Fault behavior needs to be understood in the context of regional tectonics. Convergent margins may be divided into two end-member types that are termed erosive and accretionary plate boundaries (e.g., von Huene and Scholl, 1991; Clift and Vannucchi, 2005). One fundamental difference between these styles of subduction is the transfer of material between the overriding and downgoing plates. At accretionary margins, material above the décollement is transferred from the downgoing plate to the upper plate through either frontal accretion or underplating at the base of the forearc accretionary prism, leading to a net growth of the margin. Accretion rates vary between $\mathord{\sim}7$ and $29\;\mathrm{km}^{3}/\mathrm{m.y.}$ (Clift and Vannucchi, 2004). At erosive margins, all of the incoming sediment is subducted and the upper plate margin is eroded at its front and base such that the upper surface of the margin subsides and retreats (Lallemand et al., 1994). Basal erosion rates of $25{-}50\;\mathrm{km}^{3}/\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{y}$ . per kilometer of trench length are estimated for northeast Japan, northern Chile and Peru, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Alaska (Scholl et al., 1980; von Huene and Lallemand, 1990; von Huene and Scholl, 1991; Ranero and von Huene, 2000; Collot et al., 2004; Clift and Vannucchi, 2004). The process by which subduction erosion occurs is unclear.  

Catalogs of convergent margins (Clift and Vannucchi, 2004; Heuret et al., 2011) indicate subduction erosion is favored in regions where the incoming sediment thickness is $<\!1\;\mathrm{km}$ and convergence rates exceed $60\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}.$ . Conversely, subduction accretion is favored in areas where the incoming sediment thickness is ${>}1\ \mathrm{km}$ and convergence rates are ${<}60\mathrm{\mm/y}.$ . It is important to note that these are end-member models and in reality margins likely transition back and forth along strike and in time with phases of accretion, nonaccretion, and erosion.  

One reason it is important to understand erosive margins is that the style of seismicity associated with these margins may be different than that found at accretionary margins. Notwithstanding the short instrumental record, Bilek (2010) suggests tsunami earthquakes are more likely to be generated at erosive margins. Tsunami earthquakes are events that produce large tsunamis relative to their seismic moment and arise from slip in the shallowest portion of the subduction zone (Kanamori, 1972; Kanamori and Kikuchi, 1993; Satake and Tanioka, 1999; Polet and Kanamori, 2000; Abercrombie et al., 2001; Bilek and Lay, 2002; Ammon et al., 2006). These earthquakes generate large shallow slip on the subduction thrust that uplifts the seafloor, displacing the overlying water. In contrast, the largest events $(\mathbf{M}>9)$ are more likely to be generated at accretionary margins (Bilek, 2010), the 2011 Tohoku earthquake being an exception. This observation suggests the difference in seismic style between these margins may be systematically different.  

# The Cocos Ridge and subducting Cocos plate  

Offshore the western margin of Costa Rica, the oceanic Cocos plate subducts under the Caribbean plate, forming the southern end of the Middle America Trench (Fig. F1). Here, the Middle America Trench exhibits prominent variability that includes changes in the incoming plate age, convergence rate and obliquity, morphology, and slab dip. The age of the Cocos plate at the Middle America Trench decreases from $24\ \mathrm{Ma}$ offshore the Nicoya Peninsula to $14\;\mathrm{Ma}$ offshore the Osa Peninsula (Barckhausen et al., 2001). Subduction rates vary from $70\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ offshore Guatemala to $90\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ offshore southern Costa Rica (DeMets, 2001). Convergence obliquity across the trench varies from offshore Nicaragua, where it is as much as $25^{\circ}$ oblique, to nearly orthogonal southeast of the Nicoya Peninsula (DeMets, 2001; Turner et al., 2007). The variation in plate age, convergence rate, and slab dip influence the thermal structure of the margin (Harris et al., 2010b), and the variation in the convergent obliquity has implications for slip partitioning as indicated by focal mechanisms and GPS displacement data (Lundgren et al., 1999; McCaffrey, 2002; Norabuena et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2007; LaFemina et al., 2009).  

The bathymetry and morphology of the incoming Cocos plate varies substantially between the Nicoya and Osa Peninsulas (Fig. F1). This variation is a function of the plate’s origin and subsequent history. The Cocos plate was formed at two ridges, the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) and the slow-spreading Cocos-Nazca Spreading center (CNS). The boundary separating EPR from CNS crust is a combination of a triple junction trace and a fracture zone, collectively comprising a “plate suture”  

(Barckhausen et al., 2001) (Fig. F1). EPR-generated crust is north of the plate suture and has a generally smoother morphology. CNS-generated crust is south of the plate suture and has a generally rougher morphology.  

Subsequent to the plate’s formation it was intruded by Galapagos magmatism that generated the aseismic Cocos Ridge and many seamounts that together contribute to large variations in bathymetric relief. The Cocos Ridge is an overthickened welt of oceanic crust that stands ${\sim}2.5~\mathrm{km}$ higher than the surrounding seafloor and has a maximum thickness of ${\sim}25~\mathrm{km}$ , greater than three times normal oceanic crustal thickness (Walther, 2003). Northwest of the Cocos Ridge, seamounts $1{-}2\,\mathrm{km}$ high and $10{-}20\ \mathrm{km}$ in diameter cover ${\sim}40\%$ of the seafloor (von Huene et al., 1995, 2000). The subduction of the Cocos Ridge and seamounts have caused substantial subduction erosion of the outer forearc (Ranero and von Huene, 2000). Additionally, the overthickened Cocos Ridge is more buoyant than normal oceanic crust and has uplifted the Osa and Nicoya Peninsulas and the Quepos region (Gardner et al., 1992; Fisher et al., 1998; Gardner et al., 2001; Sak et al., 2004). Cocos Ridge subduction is also manifested in changes to the dip and depth of the Wadati-Benioff Zone. The seismically active slab dips ${\sim}65^{\circ}$ near the Nicaraguan border and shallows by a few degrees inboard of the Cocos Ridge. At depths below $60\;\mathrm{km}$ there is no seismically defined slab landward of the Cocos Ridge (Vergara Muñoz, 1988; Protti et al., 1994).  

# Upper plate and subaerial geology  

Active subduction erosion from Guatemala to Costa Rica is indicated by drilling, seismic, and bathymetric data (Ranero and von Huene, 2000; Ranero et al., 2000; Vannucchi et al., 2001, 2003, 2004). Disrupted bathymetry at the base of the margin slope indicates frontal erosion (Fig. F1). These embayments are thought to mark the location where seamounts or other elevated bathymetric features have tunneled into the margin and indicate a net loss of material. Offshore the Osa Peninsula, the margin has a broad concavity centered on the Cocos Ridge, testifying to the removal of material through ridge subduction.  

Basal erosion is demonstrated by shallow-water sedimentary rocks recovered at deepwater depths that lie unconformably on upper plate basement (Vannucchi et al., 2001). Drilling data offshore the Nicoya Peninsula suggest the margin has undergone basal erosion and subsidence since ${\sim}16\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Vannucchi et al., 2001). Benthic fauna preserved in the slope apron sediment coupled with changes in facies indicate that a slow background subsidence of ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m/m.y}$ . radically increased to ${\sim}600\,\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ starting at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary at $2.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Vannucchi et al., 2003). The short-term rate of removal of rock from the forearc is estimated to be $107{-}123\ \mathrm{km}^{3}/\mathrm{m.y.}$ per kilometer of trench. This acceleration in subsidence may be linked to the arrival of the Cocos Ridge at the subduction zone (Vannucchi et al., 2003).  

Seismic data along the margin show that the margin is composed of a thick slope sediment apron, a few hundred meters to $\sim\!2\;\mathrm{km}$ thick, unconformably overlying upper plate framework material (von Huene et al., 2000). In the Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project (CRISP) drilling area, the upper plate is underthrust by sediment and buttressed by a small frontal prism (Fig. F2). The frontal prism offshore the Osa Peninsula is $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{km}$ wide, a similar width to the frontal prism offshore the Nicoya Peninsula.  

Subaerially, the subduction of the Cocos Ridge is thought to have caused (1) the cessation of the arc volcanism and uplift of the Talamanca Cordillera; (2) the inversion of the middle Eocene–Pliocene forearc basin, now exposed along the Fila Costeña, a fold and thrust belt with peak elevations of $1000{-}1500\,\mathrm{m};$ and (3) the exhumation of the Late Cretaceous–early Eocene ophiolitic rocks cropping out along the Osa Peninsula Gulf and the middle Eocene–middle Miocene Osa Mélange. Geologic and GPS data reveal uplift and shortening is at a maximum directly inboard of the Cocos Ridge. Quaternary shortening exceeds $15~\mathrm{km}$ ( $\mathrm{10{-}40\ m m/y)}$ across the Fila Costeña fold and thrust belt (Fisher et al., 2004; Sitchler et al., 2007). The Talamanca Cordillera located between the Fila Costeña fold and thrust belt and the northern Panama deformation belt exposes plutonic rocks as young as 6 Ma (MacMillan et al., 2004), implying rapid uplift.  

Because of its influence on the upper plate, an outstanding issue for the tectonics of the region is the timing of the Cocos Ridge impinging on the Middle America Trench. Estimates range between $\sim\!1$ Ma (Hey, 1977; Lonsdale and Klitgord, 1978), ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ (Sutter, 1985) and ${\sim}20{-}22\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Lonsdale and Klitgord, 1978; van Andel et al., 1971). The $5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ age is based on the emplacement of adakitic arc rocks between 5.8 and $2.0\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Abratis and Wörner, 2001) and thermochronological information on the uplift of the Talamanca Cordillera (Gräfe et al., 2002). However, marine deposition and volcanic flows in the Pliocene Terraba forearc basin directly inboard of the Cocos Ridge (Kolarsky et al., 1995) raise concerns about this model.  

The lithology of the upper plate framework rock is not known. One hypothesis is that the upper plate basement is composed of a mélange of oceanic lithologies accreted to the overriding plate prior to the current phase of subduction erosion (Fig. F2). This hypothesis posits that the basement is the offshore extension of the Caribbean large igneous complex (CLIP), the Quepos and Osa terranes that crop out onshore (Ye et al., 1996; Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997; Vannucchi et al., 2001). The CLIP is composed of accreted oceanic islands and aseismic ridge terranes (Hauff et al., 1997, 2000; Sinton et al., 1997; Hoernle et al., 2002). The Quepos and Osa terranes are interpreted as representing rock accreted from subducted edifices generated by the Galapagos hotspot (Hauff et al., 1997; Vannucchi et al., 2006). On land and close to the CRISP transect, the seawardmost unit is the Osa Mélange, which is dominated by basalt, radiolarite, and limestone (Vannucchi et al., 2006).  

Alternatively, upper plate basement may be composed of paleoaccretionary prism material. This hypothesis is consistent with the relatively low seismic velocities $(3.5\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s})$ observed below the erosional unconformity (Fig. F2B).  

Within the upper plate basement, a major unknown is the nature of the high-amplitude landward-dipping reflectors cutting through the forearc (Fig. F2). These reflectors branch upward from the plate interface similar to “splay faults” (Park et al., 2002). These surfaces may represent old faults, related to a middle Eocene–middle Miocene accretionary event, now sealed by the slope apron sediment. A few of them have offsets at the top of the forearc basement into the slope apron, indicating reactivation as normal faults. Similar reactivated normal faults are observed offshore the Nicoya Peninsula and Quepos terrane (McIntosh et al., 1993; Ranero and von Huene, 2000). The presence of these discontinuities across the forearc basement can offer preexisting planes of weakness, which may play a role in focusing fluid flow drained from the deeper part of the margin as suggested by the high reflectivity and the high heat flux. The nature and magnitude of permeability along these discontinuities is unknown. Identifying the nature and age of the landward-dipping reflectors is fundamental to understanding the tectonic history of the margin offshore Osa Peninsula and the process of subduction erosion.  

# Seismogenic zone and earthquakes  

Costa Rica is a seismically active area with a history of $\mathrm{Mw}>7$ earthquakes and alongstrike changes in the seismogenic zone (Protti et al., 1995; Newman et al., 2002). Offshore the Osa Peninsula, the 20 August 1999, Mw 6.9 Quepos interplate thrust earthquake (Fig. F3) generated aftershocks recorded by a network of ocean-bottom seismometers (OBSs) and land seismometers deployed during the Costa Rica Seismogenic Zone Experiment (CRSEIZE) (DeShon et al., 2003). The 1999 Quepos earthquake is located at the downdip extension of the incoming Quepos Plateau at a depth of 21 $\pm\,4\,\mathrm{km}$ . This area coincides with the southern edge of the Costa Rica margin seamount province and bathymetrically elevated crust. These observations led Bilek et al. (2003) to suggest that this event represented rupture of topographic highs that act as asperities (Lay and Kanamori, 1980; Lay et al., 1982). Offshore the Osa Peninsula, earthquake hypocenters and aftershock clustering are located in regions of seismically imaged lower plate relief (Bilek et al., 2003; Husen et al., 2002; Protti et al., 1995).  

Aftershocks to the 1999 Quepos earthquake delineate a plate dipping at $19^{\circ}$ and are interpreted to mark the interface between the Cocos and Caribbean plates (DeShon et al., 2003). Most of the aftershocks occurred between 10 and $30\;\mathrm{km}$ depth and at a distance 30 to $95\ \mathrm{km}$ landward of the trench. DeShon et al. (2003) found that the sequence of aftershocks appeared to be influenced by the morphology of the downgoing plate, consistent with the suggestion of Bilek et al. (2003). The depth distribution of aftershocks yielded updip and downdip seismicity limits at depths of ${\sim}10$ and $30\;\mathrm{km}$ below sea level (DeShon et al., 2003).  

More recently, a 16 June 2002, Mw 6.4 event and its aftershocks were recorded by a temporary network of ocean-bottom hydrophones (OBHs) (Arroyo et al., 2011). This event nucleated $40\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the Osa Peninsula, and preliminary analysis shows that it is a shallow underthrusting event that likely occurred on the plate boundary.  

GPS measurements on land indicate interseismic strain accumulation on the plate interface and the important influence the subducting Cocos Ridge has on the tectonics of the area (Norabuena et al., 2004; LaFemina et al., 2009). Regional surface velocity data are consistent with the Cocos Ridge acting as a rigid indenter that leads to arcparallel forearc motion (LaFemina et al., 2009).  

# Heat flow data  

Values of surface heat flow vary greatly offshore Costa Rica and have important implications for the thermal state of the shallow subduction thrust and thermally mediated processes along the subduction thrust (Fig. F4). Regional heat flow measurements on the incoming Cocos plate reveal a large along-strike variation in heat flow (Von Herzen and Uyeda, 1963; Vacquier et al., 1967). EPR-generated crust of the Cocos plate has low heat flow relative to the global mean for crust of the same age. The mean value and standard deviation of regional heat flow data on EPR seafloor are $\mathord{\sim}30$ and $15\mathrm{\;mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2},$ , respectively. For seafloor of this age, conductive predictions are ${\sim}100–130\,\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ (Stein and Stein, 1992). In contrast, heat flow values on CNSgenerated seafloor are close to the conductive prediction but above the global mean for crust of this age. These values exhibit large variability indicative of fluid flow with a mean and standard deviation of 110 and $60\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2},$ , respectively.  

In 2000 and 2001, heat flow studies specifically designed to investigate the nature of the thermal transition between cold EPR and warm CNS crust were undertaken (Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2007, 2008). Closely spaced heat flow values collocated with seismic reflection lines show a sharp transition $(<\!5\;\mathrm{km})$ ) between warm and cool seafloor seaward of the trench that generally corresponds to the area of the plate suture (Fig. F4). The sharp transition indicates a shallow source consistent with fluid flow in the upper oceanic crust. The thermal boundary between warm and unusually cool values deviates from the plate suture and appears to be influenced by the proximity of basement highs that penetrate the otherwise ${\sim}300{-}400\ \mathrm{m}$ thick sediment cover. This exposed basement on EPR accreted crust focuses discharge and efficiently ventilates the oceanic crust.  

Probe measurements and bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) estimates of heat flow on the margin (Fig. F4) are analyzed by Harris et al. (2010a, 2010b). These profiles show strong variations along strike consistent with regional heat flow data on the incoming Cocos plate. Along the margin underthrust by EPR crust, heat flow is low (Langseth and Silver, 1996; Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2007), whereas along the margin underthrust by CNS crust, heat flow is generally high. The transition between the low and high heat flow correlates with the extension of the plate suture and appears relatively abrupt. High wave number variations in the heat flow data are interpreted as focused fluid flow through the margin near the deformation front (Harris et al., 2010a, 2010b).  

# Volatiles and fluids  

Fluid flow pathways through the Costa Rica margin include the upper plate basement and overlying sediment, the décollement, and the underlying oceanic crust (e.g., Silver et al., 2000; Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2007; Sahling et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2010b). Along the entire Costa Rica margin, active fluid venting is indicated by elevated methane concentrations in the bottom water (Kahn et al., 1996; McAdoo et al., 1996; Bohrmann et al., 2002; Sahling et al., 2008). Chemoautotrophic and methanotrophic communities mark cold vents at numerous localities, but higher concentrations have been found where subducted seamounts have triggered fractures, slides, and slumps that break a low-permeability, shallow sediment carapace, allowing ascending fluids to feed the communities. These communities are particularly concentrated along headwall scarps (Kahn et al., 1996; Bohrmann et al., 2002; Sahling et al., 2008). Mud volcanoes and mud diapirs have also been found, particularly across the middle slope, and are associated with a high density of chemosynthetic vents. The chemistry of the pore fluids sampled at these midslope features is indicative of clay dehydration reactions at depth (Shipley et al., 1992; Bohrmann et al., 2002; Grevemeyer et al., 2004; Hensen et al., 2004; Sahling et al., 2008).  

Along the décollement and the upper prism fault zone, coring and sampling during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 170 and 205 offshore the Nicoya Peninsula revealed freshened pore waters containing elevated Ca, Li, and $C_{3}{-}C_{6}$ hydrocarbon concentrations and low K concentrations (Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997; Silver et al., 2000; Chan and Kastner, 2000; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003; Kastner et al., 2006). These fluids contrast with pore fluids from below the décollement and between the décollement and upper fault zone that have near-seawater chemistry (Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al. 1997; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003). Downhole temperatures measured during Legs 170 and 205 are too low to support in situ mineral dehydration and thermogenic methane. Collectively, the geochemical data in the décollement offshore Nicoya Peninsula indicate an active fluid flow system with a fraction of the flow derived from depths within the subduction zone where temperatures are ${\sim}80^{\circ}{-}150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Chan and Kastner, 2000; Silver et al., 2000; Kastner et al., 2006; Solomon et al., 2009). The sharpness of the geochemical anomalies in the décollement and the estimated temperature of the fluid suggest updip flow from a source region ${\sim}38{-}55~\mathrm{km}$ landward of the trench at ${\sim}9{-}14~\mathrm{km}$ depth, near the updip limit of the seismogenic zone (Harris and Wang, 2002; Spinelli and Saffer, 2006; Kastner et al., 2006; Harris et al., 2010b).  

The magnitude of the hydrological activity in the subducting oceanic plate is just beginning to be appreciated (Silver et al., 2000; Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2008; Spinelli and Wang, 2008; Solomon et al., 2009; Harris et al., 2010a, 2010b). Low heat flow values averaging ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ exist in the EPR-generated crust offshore the Nicoya Peninsula (Langseth and Silver, 1996; Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2007, 2008). These values reflect ${<}30\%$ of the expected value from conductive lithospheric cooling models for $24\;\mathrm{Ma}$ crust (Stein and Stein, 1994) and indicate effective hydrothermal cooling of the upper oceanic crust. Seaward of the trench, recharge and discharge occur through exposed basement and seamounts (Fisher et al., 2003). This inference is corroborated by pore fluid chemical and isotopic profiles in basal sediment that show a return to approximate seawater values near the upper part of the igneous basement (Chan and Kastner, 2000; Silver et al., 2000; Morris, Villinger, Klaus, et al., 2003). In addition to the cooling effect, the vigorous lateral flow of seawater must also alter and hydrate the igneous crust, affecting chemical and isotopic mass balances as well as the transfer of volatiles through the subducting slab down to the depth of magma genesis.  

# Site survey data  

The Central America margin offshore Costa Rica is one of the best studied subduction zones, with a wide spectrum of data from seismicity, onland geology, volcanic petrology, geodesy, seismic imaging, submersible dives, and five deep-sea drilling and longterm monitoring cruises (Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 84, ODP Legs 170 and 205, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expeditions 301T and 334). This margin has been the focus of two major scientific projects: the German Collaborative Research Center (SFB) 574 “Volatiles and fluids in subduction zones” (sfb574.ifm-geomar.de/ home/) and the U.S. MARGINS National Science Foundation program (www.nsfmargins.org/SEIZE/CR-N/CostaRica.html). The supporting site survey data for Expedition 344 are archived at the IODP Site Survey Data Bank.  

More than $10,\mathrm{{000}\,\,k m}$ of bathymetric imaging has been acquired (swath bathymetry: Weinrebe and Ranero, in GeoMapApp and MARGINS Data Portal) (Fig. F5). The extensive multibeam bathymetric mapping shows variable seafloor morphology between the Nicoya and Osa Peninsulas (von Huene et al., 1995). The multibeam bathymetry is complemented by several deep-towed instrument traverses. The towed ocean bottom instrument (TOBI) sidescan sonar system of the Southampton Oceanography Centre was used during SO-163 in the spring of 2002 to detect active fluid flow at seafloor mounds and mass wasting offshore Costa Rica (Weinrebe and Ranero, 2003). Together with the results of the TOBI survey during the SO-144 cruise in 1999, much of the continental margin from Costa Rica to southeast Nicaragua was imaged with a resolution on the order of $10\;\mathrm{m}$ . Parts of that surveyed area were imaged with greater resolution using the FRG Research Center for Marine Geosciences (GEOMAR) DTS-1 deep-towed sidescan sonar system to map key areas with a resolution of better than $1\,\mathrm{m}$ (Klaucke et al., 2008; Petersen et al., 2009). Observations of the seafloor with a TV sled, gravity coring, and a TV-guided grab (Flüh et al., 2004) pinpointed areas of interest. Widespread mounds, some tens of meters high and a few hundred meters wide, have been monitored with current meters and hydrographic stations (Flüh et al., 2004). Outcropping carbonates on top and at the flanks indicate that these mounds are formed by chemotherm carbonates with abundant signs of fluid flow (Bohrmann et al., 2002; Hensen et al., 2004).  

A local network of stations on land has recorded seismicity in the area over the last two decades (Figs. F3, F5). Several marine seismological networks of OBSs and OBHs have been deployed offshore Costa Rica. CRSEIZE, run by University of California Santa Cruz, University of California San Diego, Observatorio Vulcanologico y Sismologico de Costa Rica, and University of Miami, established two seismic networks off the Osa and Nicoya Peninsulas. The first network was a 3 month (September–November 1999) onshore and offshore deployment between Quepos and the north shore of the Osa Peninsula, recording aftershocks from the 20 August 1999 Mw 6.9 underthrust earthquake. The second network operated onshore and offshore the Nicoya Peninsula from December 1999 to June 2000 (Newman et al., 2002; DeShon et al., 2006). CRSEIZE also included GPS campaigns across Costa Rica (Norabuena et al., 2004; LaFemina et al., 2009). German SFB 574 deployed OBS and land stations for ${>}9$ months (October 2002–August 2003) (Fig. F3) (Flüh et al., 2004).  

Geophysical data acquisition in the Osa drilling area is extensive. The CRISP drilling sites are positioned on an OBS/OBH seismic refraction transect across the entire onshore/offshore Costa Rica (Ye et al., 1996; Stavenhagen et al., 1998) (Fig. F5). These data were acquired in 1995/1996 during the Trans Isthmus Costa Rica Scientific Exploration of a Crustal Transect (TICOSECT) project. The TICOSECT transect is coincident with three multichannel seismic reflection surveys. The first was shot in 1978 (IG2903 vessel Ida Green), later reshot by Shell Oil (Kolarsky et al., 1995), and shot again in 1999 (BGR99 vessel Prof. Polshkov) with a long streamer and an industry acquisition system. The drilling sites have cross-lines of industry and academic heritage. Transducer and high-resolution sparker coverage is available. Conventional heat probe transects that calibrate BSR-derived heat flow from the seismic records were acquired regionally and along the primary transect (Ranero et al., 2008; Harris et al., 2010a). Magnetic and gravity data cover the area (Barckhausen et al., 1998, 2001). GPS geodesy has been studied for more than a decade, and results show a locked Osa Peninsula area (LaFemina et al., 2009).  

# Seismic reflection data  

Seismic reflection data offshore the Osa Peninsula are substantial (Fig. F6), mainly coming from $\mathrm{R}/\mathrm{V}$ Sonne Cruises SO-76, SO-81 (Hinz et al., 1996; von Huene et al., 2000; Ranero and von Huene, 2000; Ranero et al., 2007), and BGR99 (Ranero et al., 2008). This combination of data greatly expanded swath mapping, seismic reflection, and refraction coverage from the area off the Nicoya Peninsula for ${\sim}250\,\mathrm{km}$ southeast where the crest of Cocos Ridge is subducted. All seismic lines were collected with large tuned air gun arrays and multichannel streamers, as described in the original papers. Seismic data have been processed for signal enhancement including deconvolution and multiple attenuation, and were poststack time migrated. Selected sections are prestack depth migrated. All lines provide good imaging of the structure of the overriding plate, including the sediment cover strata, BSRs, and plate boundary reflections.  

The seismic reflection data from Cruise SO-81 (Hinz et al., 1996) complement those acquired during Cruise BGR99. Two Cruise BGR99 records are processed in depth and the remainder in time domains. The principal site survey line is flanked on either side by two lines at $1~\mathrm{km}$ spacing, then by lines at 2, 5, and $10\ \mathrm{km}$ spacing (Fig. F6). Although these are the most revealing seismic images, other industry and academic acquired records in the area are numerous. Seismic reflection images collected between the Osa Peninsula and the Cocos Ridge (Fig. F6) show more stratified forearc basement and lower velocity material (by ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ ) than in equivalent areas along the Nicoya transect.  

In April and May of 2011, a 3-D seismic reflection data volume was acquired offshore Costa Rica, northwest of the Osa Peninsula and northwest of the Expedition 334 transect, together with high-resolution backscatter and multibeam data (Fig. F6). The goal of the 3-D seismic survey is to image the crustal structure and the plate-boundary fault from the trench into the seismogenic zone. The 3-D survey covers a distance of $55~\mathrm{km}$ across the upper shelf, slope, and trench and extends $11\;\mathrm{km}$ along strike for a total survey area of $605~\mathrm{km}^{2}$ . These data were acquired with the R/V Langseth using a $3300\,\mathrm{in}^{3}$ source shot every $50\,\mathrm{m}$ . Data were recorded on four $6\;\mathrm{km}$ long, 468-channel streamers with $150~\mathrm{m}$ separation. When the Expedition 344 Scientific Prospectus was written (Harris et al., 2012), only preliminary results from processing 2-D seismic lines extracted from the 3-D volume and from initial 3-D volume processing were available (Bangs et al., 2011; Kluesner et al., 2011). Initial processing of the seismic data shows an upper plate structure with numerous faults, many extending down to the plate interface, and intense folding and faulting of the slope cover sequences (Bangs et al., 2011). Multibeam data across the shelf and slope correlate to faulting and folding sequences in the slope cover and deeper upper plate faulting seen in preliminary 2-D and 3-D seismic reflection images. The arcuate structure of the shelf edge and structural bulge seen in seismic data just landward of the shelf edge are consistent with a site of uplift over a subducting ridge (Kluesner et al., 2011).  

# Heat flow data  

Heat flow data along seismic Line BGR99-7 (Fig. F5) are measured with short marine probes and estimated from the depth of the BSR (Harris et al., 2010a). In general, probe and BSR values of heat flow agree (Fig. F7). Near the deformation front, high wavenumber variability indicative of fluid flow is observed. A simple analytical analysis suggests fluid flow rates of 7 to $15\mathrm{~mm}/\mathrm{y}.$ . The high wavenumber variability is superimposed on a trend of decreasing landward heat flow consistent with the downward advection of heat with the subducting plate. Two-dimensional finite element thermal models of subduction are used to understand the heat flow data (Harris et al., 2010b). This analysis indicates that models using a conductive geotherm based on a plate model of lithospheric cooling produce values systematically lower than the heat flow data. Instead, the data are most consistent with a thermal model incorporating fluid flow within the upper oceanic crust of the subducting plate. These models predict much lower temperatures along the subduction thrust than previously indicated by Ranero et al. (2008).  

# Preliminary results from Expedition 334 (CRISP-A1)  

The primary goal of Expedition 334 was to characterize the shallow upper plate at two sites along the BGR99-7 seismic reflection line (Fig. F2). Sites U1378 on the midslope and U1379 on the upper slope were characterized with logging-while-drilling (LWD) data and later cored, allowing samples of fluids and sediment to be collected. A third midslope location (Site U1380) was attempted but abandoned because of poor drilling conditions. In addition, the sediment and basement were cored on the incoming plate (Site U1381). These sites are briefly reviewed starting at the input site and continuing landward. Additional details are given in the Expedition 334 Proceedings volume (Vannucchi, Ujiie, Stroncik, Malinverno, and the Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012c).  

Site U1381 reveals the characteristics of the incoming sedimentary section and upper basement and serves as a reference site. This site is on the incoming Cocos plate $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{km}$ seaward of the trench on a local basement high. The primary objective at the site was to core basement material, but because of the lack of time, sediment was drilled using the rotary core barrel (RCB). Expedition 344 re-cored the sediment using the advanced piston corer (APC).  

Midslope Site U1380 is $14.5~\mathrm{km}$ landward of the trench (Fig. F2). Earthquake relocations (DeShon et al., 2003) and geodetic data (LaFemina et al., 2009) suggest this site is seaward of the locked portion of the plate interface. The site was cored between $\sim\!395$ and 480 meters below seafloor (mbsf) during Expedition 334 as a contingency to Site U1378, which was drilled to $\mathord{\sim}524$ mbsf (Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012). During Expedition 334, both Sites U1380 and U1378 (1 km seaward) were abandoned before science goals were achieved, and a fundamental reason for returning to Site U1380 was to attain the science goals.  

# Scientific objectives  

The CRISP program is designed to understand seismogenesis at erosional convergent margins. CRISP Program A is the first step toward deep riser drilling through the seismogenic zone. The principal objectives of CRISP Program A are on the shallow lithologic, hydrologic, stress, and thermal conditions that lead to unstable slip in the seismogenic zone. The focus of this expedition is on characterizing the upper plate, lithology, deformation, and fluid system and evaluating the subduction channel thickness, which is necessary to constrain the structural environment and crustal stress that will be documented during deep riser drilling. Expedition 344 is a continuation of Expedition 334; they are Stages 1 and 2, respectively, of CRISP Program A. The primary goals for Expedition 344 were as follows:  

# 1. Estimate the composition, texture, and physical properties of the décollement zone and upper plate material.  

At erosive margins, the upper plate material constitutes a primary input into the plate boundary. As the plate boundary migrates upward, upper plate material is incorporated into the subduction channel that feeds the seismogenic zone. The onset of seismogenic behavior along the subduction thrust is influenced by physical properties of the overriding plate material. Characterization of the décollement zone and upper plate basement will provide structural and mechanical constraints on the possible mechanical changes occurring at seismogenic depths. Sampling rocks of the upper plate basement beneath the upper slope is necessary to define drilling conditions for deep holes and to better understand this margin prior to CRISP Program B drilling.  

# 2. Assess rates of sediment accumulation and margin subsidence/uplift in slope sediment.  

Both the subduction of bathymetric features and basal erosion of the upper plate are expected to be reflected in forearc tectonic processes. Rapid changes in sediment accumulation rates and margin subsidence are one manifestation of these processes. Rates of sediment accumulation will be documented with biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic methods. Margin uplift or subsidence can be documented by facies changes and careful studies of benthic foraminifers. Subsidence can also be indicated by progressive seaward tilting of sedimentary beds. Other evidence includes the landward migration of the coastline and the arc magmatic front over time.  

# 3. Evaluate fluid/rock interaction, the hydrologic system, and the geochemical processes (indicated by composition and volume of fluids) active within the upper plate.  

We expect that subduction of the Cocos Ridge caused fracturing of the upper plate that modified the hydrological system and is manifested in flow paths and fluid velocities, heat flow, and mass transport. Landward-dipping reflectors cutting through the upper plate have been interpreted to extend to the plate boundary. Geochemistry can open a window directly to the seismogenic zone through the analysis of solutes that can be related to chemical reactions or mineral precipitation occurring at the depth of seismogenesis.  

Important feedbacks exist between fluid pressure, temperature, and the strength of rocks. Temperature and fluid pressure exert important controls on the state of stress and friction. In turn, stress and deformation processes influence porosity and permeability, which have a fundamental influence of fluid pressure. Measuring the thermal and hydrologic regime is critical. Fluid pressure and temperature may be measured in situ until a depth where the material is semiconsolidated. Laboratory analysis, as consolidation tests, can give indirect but realistic values of pore pressure.  

# 4. Measure the stress field across the updip limit of the seismogenic zone.  

The stress field may be inferred from borehole breakouts, anelastic strain recovery analysis (ASR), and sense of deformation. Borehole breakouts and ASR show a present stress state that can be compared with GPS crustal strain. The paleostress field from deposition to present is recorded in deformation of the rock. Changes of stress field with Cocos Ridge subduction will be evaluated using structural analysis.  

GPS data indicate high rates of strain in the vicinity of Osa Peninsula. Patterns of microearthquake epicenters suggest that relative plate motion in the seismogenic zone is accommodated by coseismic slip. CRISP Program A drilling will contribute to a better definition of the orientation of the horizontal compressive stress in the area. Downhole in situ heat flow measurements will improve our understanding of the thermal regime, allowing better temperature estimates associated with the onset of seismicity as well as allowing us to develop viscoelastic models of deformation.  

# 5. Study Cocos Ridge subduction and evolution of the Central American volcanic arc.  

CRISP Program A is also a standalone project providing data to solve long-standing problems related to tectonics of the region. These primary objectives include a better understanding of relationships between Cocos Ridge subduction to the tectonics of the upper plate and evolution of the Central American volcanic arc. These goals will be achieved through dating the impingement of the Cocos Ridge on the margin, recovery and dating of tephra layers, and identifying potential late products of Central American arc volcanism.

# Background and objectives  

Fundamental to sampling and quantifying the material comprising the seismogenic zone of a convergent margin is an understanding of the nature of the sediment and oceanic crust entering the seismogenic zone and the hydrologic and the thermal state of the igneous oceanic crust. Site U1381 serves as a reference site on the subducting aseismic Cocos Ridge.  

Site U1381 is ${\sim}4.5~\mathrm{km}$ seaward of the deformation front offshore Osa Peninsula and Caño Island, Costa Rica (Fig. F6). This site was chosen for multiple reasons. First, a clear seismic record of the plate stratigraphy and basement is present at this site (Fig. F8). The seismic section shows a $100\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sediment section resting on reflective basement interpreted as Cocos Ridge igneous crust. The sedimentary section is composed of pelagic and hemipelagic sediment (Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012d). Secondly, it is located on a local basement high. Basement relief often focuses fluid flow, so data from this site have a high likelihood of documenting the vigor of fluid flow in this area. Thirdly, Site U1381 is far enough away from the frontal thrust that it is expected to be reasonably free from the influence of downslope debris flows that might emanate from the convergent margin slope. Finally, Site U1381 is located on the same seismic line as Sites U1412, U1380, and U1379 (Fig. F2). Paleomagnetic data constrain the age of this portion of Cocos Ridge to $14\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Barckhausen et al., 2001).  

During CRISP Expedition 334 in 2011, Site U1381 was cored using the RCB because the primary objective was oceanic crust and time constraints precluded APC drilling through the sediment section (Vannucchi et al., 2012). However, a disadvantage of the RCB system is that soft sediment recovered with it is usually highly disturbed. Thus a primary goal for revisiting this site was to core the sediment section with the APC to obtain more pristine samples and better document the nature of the sediment entering the seismogenic zone.  

# Operations  

After a $403\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Panama, the vessel stabilized over Site U1381 at $0620\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 October 2012 (all times in this report are ship local time, which is UTC – 6). Hole U1381C was spudded at $2015\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 26 October $(8^{\circ}25.7027^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $84^{\circ}9.4800^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ $2064.6\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth; Table T1). Advancement for Hole U1381C was $103.8\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ with $103.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ cored with the APC and $0.3\textrm{m}$ cored with the extended core barrel (XCB). Recovery with the APC was $108.70\;\mathrm{m}\;(105\%)_{\cdot}$ , and recovery with the XCB was $0.33~\mathrm{m}$ $(110\%)$ . The advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) was deployed on Cores 344-U1381C-3H, 5H, $6\mathrm{H}$ , and 7H, and four good temperature curves were recorded. The FlexIt orientation tool was deployed on Cores 344-U1381C-1H through 9H with good results. After reaching basement, the APC was changed to the XCB and a single short core was cut to confirm and recover basement material. Hole U1381C ended at $1545\;\mathrm{h}$ on 27 October, and a total of $33.5\;\mathrm{h}$ was spent at Site U1381.  

# Principal results  

The cored interval in Hole U1381C comprises five units (Fig. F9). The top of the hole contains hemipelagic sediment that is typical of an incoming plate location near a terrigenous source. The Unit I/II boundary is present in Core 344-U1381C-7H (55.93 mbsf) and is characterized by a change from greenish grayish silty clay with some nannofossils and terrigenous minerals to brownish grayish nannofossil-dominated ooze with abundant to common foraminifers and sections of abundant sponge spicules. This boundary was identified in smear slide and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. The top of Unit II is also characterized by a high abundance of tephra layers that reach $42\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ in thickness. Core description and smear slide data indicate a lithologic change in  

Core 344-U1381C-11H to finer grained nannofossil-rich clay with only some glass and feldspar components that marks the Unit II/III boundary. The Unit III/IV boundary in Core 344-U1381C-12H again shows a drastic change in lithology to a pure clay/ claystone. XRD data indicate mixing of smectite (probably saponite), pyrite, and to a lesser extent plagioclase. Sphalerite, calcite, and anhydrite are present as minor phases. Unit V starts in Core 344-U1381C-13X and consists of brecciated basalt. Overall alteration of the basaltic groundmass is slight to moderate, with smectite replacing interstitial glass and partially corroding plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocrysts. Overall, this sediment reflects a sequence of hemipelagic siliceous ooze with terrigenous input, presumably remobilized from the slope sediment sequence, overlying sponge spicule–rich nannofossil calcareous ooze, pelagic calcareous ooze, and pelagic claystone.  

The biostratigraphic characterization of Hole U1381C was determined from calcareous nannofossils and radiolarians identified in core catcher samples from Cores 344- U1381C-1H through 11H. Biostratigraphic zones indicate that Unit I is of late Pliocene to Pleistocene age $({\sim}2\mathrm{\Ma})$ . Unit II represents the middle Miocene ${\sim}11{-}13\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . The hiatus between Units I and II is ${\sim}9{-}11\ \mathrm{m.y}$ .  

Benthic foraminifers are present throughout the core, ranging from $1\%$ to $5\%$ of the total $125~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ sample size. Preservation is good, with little evidence of dissolution or breakage. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from Unit I are substantially different than those in Unit II, indicating large paleoenvironmental changes related to organic carbon flux and bottom water ventilation. Of particular interest is the substantial presence of representatives of the Stilostomella extinction group in Section 344- U1381C-6H-CC. These assemblages provide an alternative biostratigraphic datum to the calcareous nannofossils.  

Thirty-five measurements of bedding were taken principally from tephra layers in Hole U1381C. Bedding is generally subhorizontal to gently dipping. In Unit III, near the bottom of the sedimentary succession, we observed a few deformation bands and mineral-filled extensional and shear fractures, which have a normal displacement component.  

We collected and processed 28 whole-round (WR) core samples for interstitial water analyses and an additional 3 WR samples for helium analyses. In all cases enough fluid was collected for shipboard and shore-based requests with $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ long WRs. Similar to Expedition 334 data from Hole U1381A, there is little variation in salinity, chloride, sodium, and potassium. Diagenesis of organic matter in the upper sediment is indicated by increases in alkalinity, ammonium, and phosphate and consumption of sulfate, which reaches a minimum value of $11\;\mathrm{mM}$ at ${\sim}40$ mbsf. A concomitant calcium decrease is indicative of carbonate precipitation driven by the alkalinity increase. The sulfate profile shows a reversal below ${\sim}40$ mbsf, with a steady increase in concentration with depth. This observation is similar to that previously reported for Hole U1381A and for the incoming sediment section offshore the Nicoya Peninsula. Overall, the concentration-depth profiles of Ca, $\mathrm{{SO}_{4}}$ , Li, Mn, and possibly Si indicate diffusional communication with an altered seawater fluid in the oceanic basement.  

We collected and analyzed 29 headspace samples for organic geochemistry analyses. Except for elevated values of hydrocarbons in the uppermost sample (at $1.5~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ), which has been attributed to drilling contamination, methane occurs only in trace amounts and no heavier hydrocarbons were detected. $C O_{2}$ concentrations in headspace samples range from 555.5 to 1846.3 ppmv and show no change with depth.  

Inorganic carbon distribution increases with depth in Hole U1381C, consistent with a change in lithology from the silty clay sediment of Unit I to the foraminiferal carbonate ooze of Unit II. The total carbon concentration also increases from $\sim\!3\%$ to ${<}7\%$ at that depth. The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration ranges from 0.97 to $2.08\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The total nitrogen (TN) concentration ranges between 0.05 and $0.20\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ .  

Physical property measurements show high porosities (Unit $\mathrm{I}=75\%$ , Unit $\mathrm{II}=78\%$ ) and low bulk densities (Unit $\mathrm{I}=1.4~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , Unit $\mathrm{II}=1.3~\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$ ), with little evidence for compaction. Magnetic susceptibility values stay fairly constant with depth but have intermittent peaks in Unit I $(>\!100\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI})$ ) and Unit II $(>\!25\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI})$ ) that correlate with tephra layers. Natural gamma radiation (NGR) gradually increases with depth and is highly variable around the Unit I/II boundary. Electrical conductivity values appear generally consistent with porosity trends. $P$ -wave velocity measurements indicate slightly higher values in Unit II $\left.1540\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ than in Unit I $(1520\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ , despite elevated porosities in Unit II, and are highest in Unit III $(1620~\mathrm{m/s})$ . Vane shear and penetrometer measurements show strength values generally increasing downhole throughout Units I and II. Thermal conductivity results are inversely correlated with porosity. Downhole temperature measurements are consistent with those obtained previously on Expedition 334 and suggest a thermal gradient of $231^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . The calculated heat flow of $185\mathrm{~mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ is higher than that predicted for $15\;\mathrm{Ma}$ crust, suggesting significant fluid flow in the underlying ocean crust.  

Downhole variations in the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensity for archive-half cores correlate well with lithology in Hole U1381C. Paleomagnetic measurements indicate that the silty clay of Unit I (0–55.93 mbsf) has a mean NRM intensity on the order of $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m},$ , whereas the foraminifer-rich ooze in Unit II has a lower NRM intensity of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . A number of higher NRM peaks appear in both Units I and II and can be tied directly to the presence of tephra layers. The measured NRM declinations of different cores are scattered, but upon correction with the FlexIt orientation data, declinations become close to magnetic north, indicating the remanence is of geomagnetic origin. Magnetic properties obtained from the archive section halves were confirmed by discrete sample measurements.  

Characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) declinations and inclinations from discrete measurements were used to define magnetic polarity sequences for the oriented core section in Hole U1381C. At a low-latitude area such as Site U1381, a near $180^{\circ}$ shift in declination in the cores is a more reliable sign of a polarity transition than a change in the magnetic inclination. For the upper part of Unit I, both pass-through and discrete sample measurements show signs of dominantly normal polarity of ChRM. An additional constraint is provided by an ash layer at ${\sim}25$ mbsf, which is inferred to be the Ar-Ar dated $(320\,\mathrm{ka})$ Tiribí Tuff ash layer. Thus, we interpret that the sediment from 0 to 49 mbsf was deposited within the Brunhes Chron $(<\!0.78\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . In Sections 344-U1381C-6H-5 through 6H-7, we see dominantly reversed polarity in the section-half measurements. Discrete samples from this interval also show negative inclinations, and corrected declinations show a $\mathord{\sim}180^{\circ}$ shift, consistent with the magnetization acquired in a reversed field. Thus, we tentatively conclude that the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary is at 49 mbsf in Section 344-U1381C-6H-3.  

# Site U1380 summary  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1380 is located on the middle slope of the Costa Rica margin along seismic Line BGR99-7 (Fig. F6). Interplate earthquakes and geodetic measurements indicate that this site is seaward of the updip extent of seismicity and that the plate interface is not locked (Fig. F3). At Site U1380 the margin consists of a $550\;\mathrm{m}$ thick section of slope sediment overlying upper plate framework rock (Fig. F10). Hole U1380A was drilled during Expedition 334 to ${\sim}480~\mathrm{mbsf}_{_\cdot}$ , but because of poor drilling conditions it was terminated prior to reaching the framework rock (Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012c). The primary goals for revisiting this site were to determine the nature, composition, and physical properties of the upper plate framework rock; to understand the nature of the landward-dipping seismic reflectors; and to estimate the state of stress. Seismic reflection Line BGR99-7 shows that this site is above the seaward edge of one of the high-amplitude reflectors.  

# Operations  

After an $11.4\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1381, the vessel stabilized over Site U1380 at $1715\,\textrm{h}$ on 27 October 2012. Hole U1380B was spudded at $0118\mathrm{~h~}$ on 28 October $\!\{8^{\circ}35.9952^{\prime}\!\mathrm{N}_{\!\!\!\perp}$ , $84^{\circ}4.3908^{\prime}\mathrm{V}$ , $502.7\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth; Table T1). The purpose of this hole was to conduct a jet-in test with a $14\%$ inch tricone bit to verify the length of 16 inch casing that could be jetted into the formation with a reentry cone.  

Hole U1380C was spudded at $1145\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 29 October $(8^{\circ}35.9879^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $84^{\circ}4.3918^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ $502.7\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth; Table T1). The operations plan for this hole included a reentry system with two strings of casing to an undetermined depth, followed by RCB coring to $800\;\mathrm{mbsf}.$ . The reentry cone and 16 inch casing string were installed to 48 mbsf. A $14\%$ inch bit was used to drill a hole to 438 mbsf. The initial plan was to run $10\%$ inch casing string to 430 mbsf. After drilling the $14\%$ inch hole, it became impossible to keep the hole open to run casing to 430 mbsf. A new casing length of $405\mathrm{~m~}$ was selected to try to bridge a problematic zone from 337 to 396 mbsf. The hole was reamed and cleaned repeatedly prior to running casing. Eventually, the problematic zone was cemented and redrilled. After several days of hole cleaning, the $405\;\mathrm{m}$ long $10\%$ inch casing string was run into the hole. With the end of the casing $18\,\mathrm{m}$ above the desired depth, we were unable to advance the casing any further and were forced to pull the casing back to the surface. To avoid disassembling the entire casing string, we secured the casing string to the moonpool doors and tripped back in the hole with a $9\%$ inch tricone bit with a $14\%$ inch underreamer. We then attempted to ream the hole back to bottom. During this process, $391\mathrm{~m~}$ of casing parted just below sea level and followed the drill string down into the hole. To determine the condition of the casing string inside the hole, we switched to a coring bottom-hole assembly (BHA) with an RCB bit and drilled down carefully from 336 to 438 mbsf. RCB coring commenced at $1745\mathrm{~h~}$ on 7 November and continued without interruption until $0400\;\mathrm{h}$ on $10\;\mathrm{No}.$ - vember to a total depth of 800 mbsf. Nonmagnetic RCB core barrels were used starting with Core 344-U1380C-11R. In an effort to improve recovery we started cutting half cores with Core 344-U1380C-25R. The total cored interval in Hole U1380C was $362.0\;\mathrm{m}$ , with $202.4\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered, for an overall recovery of $56\%$ .  

The hole was prepared for logging, the bit was dropped on the seafloor, and the triple combination (triple combo)–Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI) logging string was rigged up. During the first logging attempt, the logging tools were unable to advance past 398 mbsf, which coincided with the estimated depth of the casing shoe. The tools were pulled from the hole, and the drill pipe was advanced to 467 mbsf without difficulty. The drill pipe was pulled back to 394 mbsf, and a reconfigured triple combo string without the UBI was run into the hole at $2310~\mathrm{h}$ . This time the logging tools made it to 458 mbsf before encountering an obstruction. A review of the logs showed that the casing had slipped further down. After retrieving the logging tools, a BHA with a used RCB bit was deployed, the hole was washed down to 781 mbsf, the hole was conditioned for logging, and the bit was dropped in the bottom of the hole. The triple combo logging tool string was rigged up for the third time and run into the hole at $1310\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 November. However, the logging tools encountered a similar obstruction at 462 mbsf. After several attempts to get the tools to reenter the open hole, logging operations were terminated. The hole was plugged with a $10~\mathrm{bbl}$ cement plug, and the acoustic beacon was recovered. The drill string was pulled from the hole, clearing the rig floor at $0055\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November and ending Hole U1380C operations. A total of 17.3 days were spent on Site U1380.  

# Principal results  

Hole U1380C was cored to investigate the lithostratigraphy and structural geology of the lower portions of the middle slope sequence and the uppermost portions of the basement, as interpreted in multichannel seismic reflection data (Fig. F11). This hole deepens Site U1380, drilled during Expedition 334 (Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012c), and is a complementary hole to nearby Site U1378 where only the upper part (539.9 mbsf) of the slope sediment was drilled during Expedition 334.  

The majority of the sedimentary sequence consists of clayey siltstone $(\sim\!59\%)$ and silty claystone $(\sim\!25\%)$ with common interlayered centimeter- to decimeter-sized beds of fine- to medium-grained sandstone $(\sim\!15\%)$ . The siltstone sedimentary sequence is disrupted by coarse-grained shell-rich sandstones, two conglomerates $({\sim}1\%)$ , and 25 dispersed tuff layers $(<\!1\%)$ . Three lithostratigraphic units are distinguished based on lithological compositional changes.  

Unit I extends from 438 to 552.72 mbsf (Sections 344-U1380C-2R-1 to 13R-7, $55\;\mathrm{cm},$ ) and is characterized by massive dark greenish gray silty clay and three sandstone-rich horizons with centimeter- to decimeter-sized sandy layers. These sandy layers are cemented with calcite and increase in abundance, thickness, and grain size with depth. Matrix components comprise lithic fragments (sedimentary and magmatic), feldspar, glass shards, and amphiboles. Biogenic components include rare nannofossils, diatoms, and foraminifers.  

Unit II extends from 552.72 to 771.62 mbsf (Sections 344-U1380C-13R-7, $55~\mathrm{cm}$ , to 47R-3, $106\;\mathrm{cm})$ ) and is visually defined by a relatively sharp lithologic change into a greenish gray clayey siltstone with intercalated sandstone and conglomerate layers. Unit II is further divided into two subunits based on compositional and depositional variations. Subunit IIA is characterized by well-lithified siltstones and poorly to weakly lithified sand beds that contain abundant to common shell fragments. The matrix also contains abundant lithic fragments, feldspar, and zeolites, but the main mineralogical variation is an increase in the abundance of amphibole that is limited to this subunit. Low recovery hinders the precise measurement of the thickness of Subunit IIA $\left(\sim\!11.38\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ ), but we assume that the missing material is composed of the same poorly lithified sand as the recovered sections. The lithologic boundary between Subunits IIA and IIB ( $123.24\:\mathrm{m}$ thick) in Core 344-U1380C-15R (564.10 mbsf) was not recovered. Subunit IIB is very dark greenish gray clayey siltstone characterized by two fining-upward sequences of centimeter- to decimeter-thick, medium- to coarsegrained sandstones and fine conglomerates. Matrix and sandstone components are predominantly terrigenous lithic fragments (magmatic more common than sedimentary), feldspar, glass, and rare heavy minerals. Biogenic material is mostly absent, and none was observed toward the bottom of the unit. Highly altered tuff layers in the lower parts of Cores 344-U1380C-30R (688.04 mbsf) and 47R (770.56 mbsf) are characterized by color changes within the clayey siltstone to a reddish brown carbonaceous siltstone and by variations in the matrix mineralogy.  

Both subunits are characterized by normally graded sandstone beds that are often laminated, with abundant sapropel fragments that form several centimeter-thick conspicuous horizons between the laminae. The conglomerates are very thickly bedded and contain poorly sorted, pebble-sized, matrix-supported lithic fragments. Top contacts between fine- and coarse-grained sediment, when observed, are mostly gradational, whereas the bottom contacts are erosional and commonly contain rip-up clasts, load clasts, and sand lenses. In general, Unit II is more indurated and lithified than Unit I.  

Unit III (Cores 344-U1380C-47R through 52R) is a $29.44\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, fine-grained silty claystone with rare but thick (as thick as $1.20\;\mathrm{m}$ ) intercalated fine- to coarse-grained sandstone. The matrix contains mostly terrigenous material dominated by lithic fragments and feldspar but is nearly devoid of biogenic material.  

Unit I is a continuation of sediment cored in Hole U1380A during Expedition 334 (Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012c) and correlates well to Unit II from Hole U1378B (Expedition 334). The sedimentary succession recovered from Hole U1380C likely reflects an alternating terrestrially sourced, turbiditic upper slope (Unit I/III) to shelf (Unit II) sequence influenced by a deltaic system. The dynamic depositional environment is manifested by the varying grain sizes that range up to pebble-sized conglomerates, especially in Unit II, and the cyclic increasing abundances of the sandstone throughout the sedimentary sequence.  

Deformation structures increase gradually in Cores 344-U1380C-2R through 13R. Normal faults are present throughout the interval, with reverse faults increasing downhole. Deformation culminates in Cores 344-U1380C-11R through 13R with the development of pronounced foliation. Bedding is commonly steeply dipping. Deformation is moderate in Cores 344-U1380C-14R through 45R, and there is no foliation. Bedding remains steep until Core 344-U1380C-31R, and from Core 32R downhole it is subhorizontal to gently dipping. In the deeper cores there is an increase of discrete brittle shear zones.  

The biostratigraphy of Hole U1380C was determined by nannofossils because core catcher samples were barren of radiolarians. Four biostratigraphic zones were identified. The interval from Sample 344-U1380C-2R-CC to 4R-CC is assigned to nannofossil Zones NN19–NN21. The second interval, between Samples 344-U1380C-5R-CC and 8R-CC, is assigned to Zone NN19. The third zone, NN18, is defined by the first downhole occurrence of Discoaster brouweri, which appears in Sample 344-U1380C9R-CC. The fourth biostratigraphic zone encompasses Samples 344-U1380C-51R-CC through 52R-CC (791–797 mbsf) and is assigned to Zones NN15–NN17, based on the last occurrence (LO) of Discoaster pentaradiatus, the first occurrence (FO) of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa in Sample 51R-CC, and the FO of Discoaster asymmetricus in Sample 52R-CC. Therefore, the oldest sediment found at this hole is older than $2.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Benthic foraminifers were studied in 44 of the 52 core catcher samples collected. Benthic foraminifers vary from “few” (Samples 344-U1380-2R-CC through 9R-CC) to “present” (Samples 31R-CC through 52R-CC), and preservation ranges from moderate, where abundance is higher, to poor, where foraminifers are present or rare. Overall, benthic foraminifer assemblages are characterized by species generally associated with organic carbon–rich environments and low bottom water oxygenation such as Uvigerina peregrina, Epistominella smithi, Brizalina spp. and Hansenisca altiformis. Downhole changes in benthic foraminifer assemblages are relatively subtle.  

The most significant geochemical finding is the presence of fluid flow through a shear zone that extends from $\mathord{\sim}480$ to $550\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , at the boundary between lithologic Units I and II. The Cl, Li, and hydrocarbon data indicate that this fluid originated from a source depth where temperatures are ${\tt>}90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Below this horizon is a marked increase in $C_{1}/C_{2+}$ ratio toward a more biogenic signature of the gases, which is consistent with pore water data (Sr, Mg, Ca, and K) that indicate lower temperature volcanic tephra alteration reactions within the sediment of lithologic Unit II. Both the inorganic and organic carbon concentrations of the sediment are distinctly higher in lithologic Unit I than in the sediment underlying the 550 mbsf unconformity.  

Within Unit I, magnetic susceptibility is generally low, NGR increases with depth to values of 38 cps, and bulk density and porosity appear to follow a steady compaction trend that is consistent with that observed in shallower sediment from Site U1378, located $1\ \mathrm{km}$ from Site U1380. $P$ -wave velocity, thermal conductivity, and sediment compressive strength increase with depth.  

Most of the physical properties show sharp changes at the Unit I/II boundary, near the major seismic reflector at 550 mbsf. Below this boundary, magnetic susceptibility becomes more variable and NGR counts decrease. Between 550 and $555~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , bulk density increases from $\sim\!2.0$ to $2.1~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , porosity decreases from $43\%$ to $35\%$ , and thermal conductivity, $P$ -wave velocity, and sediment strength increase.  

The second major change in physical properties occurs at $\mathord{\sim}700$ mbsf and is identified by a strong positive spike in magnetic susceptibility, a positive spike in $P\cdot$ -wave velocity, and a slight negative excursion in NGR. In addition, bulk densities peak at $2.2\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and porosities reach their lowest values of $25\%$ to $26\%$ . This horizon could be correlated to a strong landward-dipping reflector at $\mathord{\sim}700$ mbsf. At the Unit II/III boundary, there is a notable change in magnetic susceptibility, $P$ -wave velocity, and thermal conductivity.  

We performed NRM measurements on all split-core archive-half cores and on 60 discrete samples taken from the working halves in Hole U1380C. We subjected archive-half cores to alternating field (AF) demagnetization up to $30~\mathrm{mT}$ and subjected discrete samples to stepwise thermal and AF demagnetization up to $475^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $120\;\mathrm{mT},$ respectively, in order to establish a reliable magnetostratigraphy at this site and to observe the magnetic properties of each lithology in the lithostratigraphic units recovered.  

Several relatively well defined polarity intervals have been identified in downhole magnetostratigraphic records in spite of the presence of some samples showing unstable and ambiguous magnetization. Based on biostratigraphic data, we were able to tentatively correlate certain parts of the magnetic polarity interval recorded in the sediment with the geomagnetic polarity timescale. The Matuyama/Gauss Chron boundary $(2.581\,\mathrm{~Ma})$ is tentatively placed at $\mathord{\sim}770$ mbsf, based on both discrete sample and pass-through results.  

# Site U1412 summary  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1412 (proposed Site CRIS-9A, located on seismic Line BGR99-7) targeted the frontal sedimentary prism at the base of the slope near the toe, the main subduction thrust, the underthrust sedimentary section beneath the subduction thrust, and the upper oceanic crust (Fig. F6). The scientific objectives were to (1) characterize the frontal sedimentary prism by documenting its lithology and age; (2) sample the dé- collement at a shallow depth to define the deformation style, stress, fault friction and behavior; (3) characterize any diagenetic processes, microstructures, and potential sealing/healing processes; (4) characterize the physical properties of the subducting incoming and frontal prism sediments that are thought to mix with eroded upper plate material; and (5) determine the chemistry of pore waters within the wedge, décollement, and underthrust sections and characterize the fluid pathways.  

# Operations  

After a $7.0\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1380, the vessel stabilized over Site U1412 at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November 2012. The original operations plan for Site U1412 called for two holes, an APC/XCB hole to $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbsf and an RCB hole to 980 mbsf. Eventually, four holes were cored at this site. Coring conditions at this site were extremely difficult with below average recovery, and all four cored holes were abandoned short of the targeted depths because of poor hole conditions. Hole U1412A $\mathrm{8^{\circ}29.3294^{\prime}N}$ , $84^{\circ}7.6686^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ $1921\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth; Table T1) was spudded at $1520\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November. This was an APC/XCB drilled hole to 200.3 mbsf. APCT-3 formation temperature measurements were taken with Cores 344-U1412A-3H, 5H, 7H, and 8H. The FlexIt orientation tool was deployed with Cores 344-U1412A-1H through 15H. Core 344-U1412A-25X reached 200.3 mbsf before the hole became too unstable to continue coring. The vessel was offset $350\;\mathrm{m}$ in a south-southwest direction in an attempt to find a more favorable coring location. Hole U1412B $(8^{\circ}29.1599^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $84^{\circ}7.7512^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ , $1965\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth; Table T1) was spudded at $2350\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 November. This hole was drilled without recovery to 149.1 mbsf, and Core U1412B-20X reached 304.3 mbsf before deteriorating hole conditions forced us to stop coring. Logging with the triple combo tool string was attempted on 20 November, but the tools could not exit the BHA and the drill string became stuck. After freeing the drill string, the logging tools were laid out and the hole was abandoned. Because this hole did not reach the depth objective, a third hole was attempted $50\,\textrm{m}$ to the northeast. Hole U1412C $(8^{\circ}29.1700^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $84^{\circ}7.7467^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , $1965\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth; Table T1) was spudded at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 November. This hole was drilled without recovery to 300 mbsf, and Core 344-U1412C-10R reached 387 mbsf. After several hours spent trying to clean the hole and getting stuck, the decision was made to abandon Hole U1412C and proceed to Site U1413. After coring objectives were completed at Site U1413, the vessel returned to Site U1412. Hole U1412D ( $8^{\circ}29.1402^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $84^{\circ}7.7793^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , $1973\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth; Table T1) was spudded at $0850\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 December. This hole was drilled without recovery to 350.4 mbsf. We were only able to recover Cores 344-U1412D-2R and 3R before the hole collapsed.  

A total of 55 cores were recovered at the site: 16 APC cores, 28 XCB cores, and 11 RCB cores. The APC cored interval was $114.9\;\mathrm{m}$ , with $115.5\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(101\%)$ , the XCB cored interval was $240.6\:\mathrm{m}$ , with $82.8\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(34\%)$ , and the RCB cored interval was 105.8, with $48.8\:\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(46\%)$ . The overall recovery for Site U1412 was $54\%$ . The total time spent on Site U1412 was $277.5\,\mathrm{~h~}$ or 11.56 days ( $60.25\,\mathrm{~h~}$ in Hole U1412A, $104.5\mathrm{~h~}$ in Hole U1412B, $71.25\,\mathrm{~h~}$ in Hole U1412C, and $41.5\,\mathrm{~h~}$ in Hole U1412D).  

# Principal results  

Site U1412 was drilled to investigate the lithostratigraphy and structural geology of the slope–toe sequence and the uppermost portions of the basement, as interpreted in multichannel seismic reflection data (Fig. F12). The primary goal of this site was to penetrate the décollement and investigate the fluid flow regime within the sediment as well as the oceanic crust.  

Three units were distinguished in the sedimentary rocks (Fig. F13). Unit I is predominantly dark greenish to greenish gray clay $(33\%)$ with small variations in grain size to silt $(16\%)$ and silty clay $(17\%)$ and contains seven tephra layers. This is terrigenousinfluenced sediment. Unit I shows strong indications for gas expansion and gas hydrate disassociation. Unit II is light to dark grayish brown calcareous nannofossil ooze with varying amounts of diatoms and sponge spicules. Primary sedimentary structures could not be observed because of very strong drilling disturbance. Unit III is a sequence of grayish green clayey siltstone with minor interlayered sandstone and contains two dark grayish tephra layers. The Unit III matrix composition is dominated by terrigenous clay and contains nannofossils as well as radiolarian and diatom fragments. Hole U1412D sediment is slightly more clayey, highly bioturbated, and shows a decrease in the biogenic components. The change in lithology at this site from terrigenous input to Miocene calcareous ooze to Pleistocene hemipelagic sediment likely reflects accretion of large slivers of the incoming plate.  

Nannofossil biostratigraphy indicates that the upper portion of Hole U1412A is Zone NN19 (0.4–1.89 Ma). A major change from Pleistocene to Miocene is recorded in Core 344-U1412B-8X, consistent with the lithostratigraphic boundary between Units II and III. In Hole U1412C, Samples 344-U1412C-2R-CC through 5R-CC are indicative of a middle Miocene age. A major age inversion is recorded between Cores 344-U1412B5R and 6R, with the reappearance of Pleistocene assemblages. Benthic foraminifers are common in the upper sections of Hole U1412A and include Uvigerina peregrina, Uvigerina auberiana, Cibicidoides pachyderma, Melonis affinis, and Cassidulina carinata. A substantial change in foraminiferal assemblages occurs starting with Core 344- U1412B-7X and is characterized by Globocassidulina subglobosa, Cibicidoides pachyderma var. bathyalis, Hansenisca altiformis, and Planulina renzi. The latter species last appeared in the middle Miocene, which agrees with the nannofossil and radiolarian biostratigraphy.  

Hole U1412A has subhorizontal to gently dipping bedding at the very top of the drilled section. Steeply dipping normal faults are common in the lower part of the section. Hole U1412C has steeply dipping bedding, normal and reverse faults, and intervals of brecciated sediment, in some cases with fragments where striated and polished surfaces are developed.  

The upper sections of sediment reflect changes associated with organic matter diagenesis. The sulfate–methane transition (SMT) occurs at 14.73 mbsf, and high-resolution headspace samples were collected below this depth for shore-based geomicrobiology studies. The decrease in calcium and magnesium concentrations at the SMT depth reflects precipitation of authigenic carbonates. The presence of gas hydrate in the sediment was inferred from discrete chloride anomalies and excursions to low $C_{1}/C_{2+}$ ratios between 60 and 85 mbsf, consistent with observations of mousselike texture in sediment. We observe decreasing concentrations in alkalinity, boron, and magnesium, whereas calcium, barium, strontium, and lithium concentrations increase with depth. There is, however, not enough resolution in the sample coverage from lithologic Units II and III to delineate in situ diagenetic reactions or fluid migration pathways. There is no significant change in the chloride values below the gas hydrate stability zone.  

In general, methane concentrations increase rapidly below 14.1 mbsf, consistent with the depth of the SMT at this site. The gas composition of the headspace and void gas is consistent with a biogenic methane source. However, the decrease in the $C_{1}/C_{2+}$ ratios of headspace and void gas samples to $\mathord{\sim}400$ and a few occurrences of propane in Unit III point to a mixture of biogenic gas and thermogenic hydrocarbons that migrated from depth.  

Physical properties measured indicate that bulk density values increase and porosity values decrease in the upper $30\;\mathrm{m}$ . Both properties remain stable to the base of Hole U1412A, with average bulk density and porosity values of $1.69\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $60\%$ , respectively. Bulk density and porosity values in Unit III show considerable variability but suggest slightly more compaction (higher bulk density and lower porosity) than at the base of Unit I. In Unit I, background magnetic susceptibility is low, with some high excursions within Unit I. NGR is relatively stable throughout Unit I and higher and more scattered within Unit III. Strength increases in the upper $30\,\mathrm{m}$ and then remains stable until Unit III, where it is higher and more scattered. Formation factor values vary between 1.5 and 4. Thermal conductivity and $P_{\cdot}$ -wave measurements were rare and scattered because of gas disturbance. Measured $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocities are low, varying between 1500 and $1600\,\mathrm{m/s}$ . Thermal conductivity ranges from 0.7 to $1.3\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ . A least-squares linear fit to the downhole temperature data yields a gradient of $114^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km}$ .  

We measured the NRM of archive section halves and demagnetized them in an alternating field up to $40\ \mathrm{mT}$ . There are more significant variations in NRM intensity within lithostratigraphic Unit I than in Units II and III. We demagnetized 61 discrete samples to verify the section data. We recognized seven magnetozones in Hole U1412A and interpreted them to include the Brunhes Chron and the Jaramillo, Cobb Mountain, and Olduvai Subchrons. Our magnetostratigraphic data suggest extremely high sedimentation accumulation rates for Hole U1412A, similar to those found in Hole U1379C during Expedition 334.  

# Site U1413 summary  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1413 (proposed Site CRIS-13B) targeted the upper slope of the Costa Rica margin (Fig. F6). This site is within the 3-D seismic data set along Inline 2466 and crossing Line 4882 $(8^{\circ}44.4557^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $84^{\circ}6.8027^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , $540~\mathrm{m}$ water depth; Table T1; Fig. F14). Interplate earthquake relocations (Fig. F3) and interpretation of geodetic measurements show that this site is located above the seismogenic zone (Bilek, 2003; LaFemina et al., 2009). The primary purpose of drilling Site U1413 was to determine the nature, composition, and physical properties of the slope sediment. This site is also designed as a “pilot hole” in preparation for proposed deeper CRISP Program B drilling at this location. Science objectives at Site U1413 included (1) documenting the lithology and physical properties, (2) determining the stress orientation of the margin above the seismogenic zone, and (3) constraining the fluid-flow regime and role of slope sediment in fluid flow. Documenting the periods of subsidence and uplift provides important information about the process of tectonic erosion that characterizes the Costa Rica margin. One technique for estimating the relative motion of the margin is through stratigraphic correlations of multiple sites.  

# Operations  

After a $15.0\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1412, the vessel stabilized over Site U1413 at 2330 h on 23 November 2012. The original operations plan for Site U1413 called for two holes: an APC/XCB hole to $\mathord{\sim}600$ mbsf and an RCB hole to 1430 mbsf. Eventually, three holes were cored at this site. Hole U1413A $\mathrm{8^{\circ}44.4593^{\prime}N}$ , $84^{\circ}6.8095^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , $540~\mathrm{m}$ water depth; Table T1) was spudded at $0635\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 November. This was an APC/XCB hole to 189.1 mbsf. APCT-3 formation temperature measurements were taken with Cores 344-U1413A-3H, 5H, 6H, 7H, and 8H. The FlexIt orientation tool was deployed with Cores 344-U1413A-1H through 18H. Hole U1413B ( $8^{\circ}44.4593^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $84^{\circ}6.7992^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ $540\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth) was spudded at $0055\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 November. This was a shallow hole to 25.6 mbsf drilled primarily for geochemical analyses. Hole U1413C $(8^{\circ}44.4482^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $84^{\circ}6.7993^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , $540\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth) was spudded at $0940\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 November. This hole was drilled without recovery to $178.0\,\mathrm{\mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , was cored with the RCB system to $582.2\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , and was terminated to allow time to complete other expedition objectives. Following coring, three logging runs were conducted on 30 November with the triple combo, UBI, and Formation MicroScanner (FMS) tool strings.  

A total of 71 cores were recovered at this site: 21 APC cores, 8 XCB cores, and 42 RCB cores. The APC cored interval was $166.2\;\mathrm{m}_{.}$ , with $171.2\:\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(103\%)$ . The XCB cored interval was $48.5\;\mathrm{m}$ , with $43.7\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(90\%)$ . The RCB cored interval was $404.2\:\mathrm{m}$ , with $313.9\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(78\%)$ . The overall recovery at Site U1413 was $85\%$ . The total time spent on Site U1413 was $170.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 7.1 days ( $[48.5\;\mathrm{h}$ in Hole U1413A, $5.75\;\mathrm{h}$ in Hole U1413B, and $116.0\,\mathrm{h}$ in Hole U1413C).  

# Principal results  

Site U1413 was drilled to investigate the lithostratigraphy and structural geology of the upper slope sequence as a preliminary study for future deep riser drilling.  

Three lithologic units (Fig. F15) can be distinguished in the sediment of Holes U1413A–U1413C, with an overall abundance of silty clay to clay $(32.1\%)$ , clayey silt to sandy silt $(53.3\%)$ , silty sand to sand $(14.4\%)$ , and tephra $(0.2\%)$ . The $44.6\;\mathrm{m}$ thick Unit I recovered in Holes U1413A and U1413B is dominated by dark greenish gray silty clay with multiple centimeter-sized turbidite sequences of fine-sand laminae. A slump/slide event was identified in the uppermost ${\sim}3.5\mathrm{~m~}$ of this unit. The lithology changes into a brownish green chaotic mixture of silty clay and dark gray sands in the lowermost part of Core 344-U1413A-5H. Ten tephra layers were also identified in Unit I. Lithologic Unit II, starting at $44.60\ \mathrm{mbsf}$ , is characterized by a well-consolidated light greenish gray calcareous clayey silt(stone) with occasional variations to silty clay, as well as minor sand(stone) layers. Unit II exhibits moderate variability in the amount and extent of calcareous cementation with depth. In addition, this unit contains several horizons of lithified and reworked rounded carbonate mud clasts. Fourteen tephra layers were identified in Unit II. Near the bottom of Hole U1413A (Section 344-U1413A-20X-1), a chaotic layer of intermixed sand and calcareous clayey silt, not associated with a lithologic change, most likely represents a mass transport deposit (MTD) interval. Unit II continues in Hole U1413C to 366.45 mbsf with the same lithology, but heavy minerals, shell fragments, and occasional sandstone layers with sapropel and leaf fragments become more abundant with depth. The boundary between Units II and III (Section 344-U1413C-21R-3, $117\ \mathrm{cm})$ ) is marked by the first appearance of an $18\textrm{m}$ thick package of alternating sandstones and siltstones with common to abundant organic matter (sapropel) and shell and gastropod fragments. The matrix of the siltstone and sandstone is characterized by abundant magmatic and sedimentary lithic fragments, common feldspar, and volcanic glass fragments. Foraminifers are the most abundant components of the biogenic material. After a relatively thin siltstone interval $\left(\sim\!42\textrm{m}\right)$ , the remainder of the hole (426.8–578.8 mbsf) consists of massive fine- to medium-grained sandstones that contain three tephra layers. The sandstones are normally graded and range from decimeter- to meter-thick layers with occasional internal laminations, particularly in the uppermost part of the section. Some cores in Unit III are particularly rich in gastropods and reworked, wellrounded carbonate clasts. These lithologic units can be correlated to some of the units found at Sites U1378 and U1379 during Expedition 334.  

Biostratigraphy at Site U1413 was mainly constrained by calcareous nannofossils. Radiolarians are present in the upper section of Hole U1413A, but few useful species were found. The upper section of Hole U1413A (Samples 344-U1413A-1H-CC through 14H-CC) is assigned to Zone NN21. In Samples 344-U1413A-15H-CC through 19XCC, the age is less well constrained and is assigned to Zones NN20–NN21 (1.89 Ma to present). The first appearance of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa, which defines the top of Zone NN19, is found in Sample 344-U1413A-20X-CC. The LO of Helicosphaera sellii is observed in Sample 344-U1413C-15R-CC and is assigned to 1.34 Ma.  

Benthic foraminifers were dominant and well preserved in Samples 340-U1413A-1H1W to 19X-CC, but they range from $^{\prime\prime}\mathrm{common^{\prime\prime}}$ to “few” in the lower section of Hole U1413A and throughout Hole U1413C, with most of the foraminiferal samples showing signs of mechanical breakage. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages show remarkable changes downhole. The uppermost $150\textrm{m}$ of sediment is characterized by an assemblage composed of Brizalina bicostata, Cassidulina tumida, and Cancris inflatus. These species are absent in the rest of the cored interval. From 160 mbsf (Sample 344- U1413A-20X-CC) to 478 mbsf (Sample 344-U1413C-32X-CC), there is a completely different assemblage composed of Brizalina spissa, Epistominella smithi, Uvigerina cf. excellens, and Hansenisca altiformis. The lower part of Hole U1413C (Samples 344- U1413C-36R-CC through 42R-CC) is characterized by the appearance of Brizalina cf. dilatata, which together with Uvigerina peregrina dominates the assemblages and constitutes as much as $80\%$ of all foraminifers.  

Faulting-related deformation starts to be present and abundant below 180 mbsf. Deformation is additionally localized along brecciated fault zones at 181, 230, 237–239, 365, 529–532, and 567 mbsf. Both normal and reverse faults were observed. Dip angles of these faults vary from subhorizontal to subvertical.  

We collected 106 interstitial water samples from Site U1413. Hole U1413B was dedicated to high-resolution studies of the biogeochemical processes just below the SMT, which at this site occurs at 16 mbsf. Pore fluid profiles of sulfate, alkalinity, and ammonium concentrations in the uppermost ${\sim}150~\mathrm{m}$ of Holes U1413A and U1413B reflect organic matter remineralization but are significantly impacted by sediment slumps at ${\sim}45$ and $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf. Calcium and magnesium concentrations decrease from seawater values at the seafloor to minima of 1.1 and $39.8\;\mathrm{mM}_{\sun}$ , respectively, at the lithologic Unit I/II boundary, reflecting precipitation of authigenic carbonates. Cl concentrations decrease with depth to $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbsf, but below this depth the Cl profile shows a trend of increasing concentrations of ${\sim}96\%$ of seawater value. The reason for the lower than modern seawater Cl value throughout the cored section but in particular in the upper ${\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ is as yet unclear. Methane increases below the SMT, and the ${C_{1}}/{C_{2}}$ ratio in the upper $50\,\mathrm{m}$ indicates a biogenic origin for the gas. Below this depth, the ${C_{1}}/{C_{2}}$ ratio decreases steadily with depth and shows a marked decrease to values ${<}100$ below 480 mbsf, indicating a thermogenic component from a deeper source.  

Site U1413 porosity values decrease (and bulk densities increase) rapidly from 0 to 180 mbsf and more gradually below 180 mbsf. Both trends have different slopes than that found in porosity data from Site U1379. Magnetic susceptibility excursions appear to coincide with sand-rich layers that contain detrital magnetite. $P$ -wave velocities average $1600\,\mathrm{m/s}$ above 20 mbsf. There are only a few scattered measurements between 20 and 200 mbsf because of core disturbance, and values average $1960~\mathrm{m/s}$ below 200 mbsf. Thermal conductivity increases from 0.9 to $1.25\:\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ from the seafloor to 200 mbsf and then gradually increases to $1.35\mathrm{~W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ at the bottom of Hole U1413C. Three temperature measurements yield a gradient of $49^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km}$ and a heat flow of $56\,\mathrm{\mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . Sediment strength generally increases from the seafloor to 140 mbsf. Below $140\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , values are scattered but show an overall gradual increase. Formation factor increases rapidly within the upper $20\;\mathrm{m}$ and more gradually below 20 mbsf.  

We performed split-core measurements of NRM and AF demagnetization of discrete samples to observe the magnetic properties of each lithostratigraphic unit recovered at Site U1413. Based on biostratigraphic data, we were able to tentatively correlate certain parts of the magnetic polarity interval recorded in the sediment with the geomagnetic polarity timescale. In particular, the polarity shift from reversed to normal at 485 mbsf in Section 344-U1413C-42R-4 may represent the beginning of the Olduvai normal polarity subchron $(1.778\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), implying a sediment accumulation rate of $270\ \mathrm{m/m.y.}$ .  

Downhole logging in Hole U1413C took place between 1045 and $2300\;\mathrm{h}$ on $30\;\mathrm{No-}$ vember 2012. Three tool strings were deployed: a slick triple combo (without the radioactive source because of poor hole conditions), a UBI (Ultrasonic Borehole  

Imager), and an FMS (Formation MicroScanner) tool string. The tool strings could not be lowered below 187 mbsf because of a borehole obstruction; the last two tool strings were chosen to focus on the ultrasonic and resistivity imaging of borehole breakouts. Three logging units can be distinguished. Logging Unit 1 (93–148 mbsf) contains clear borehole breakouts imaged by low reflection amplitudes and large traveltimes in the UBI ultrasonic log and by the orientation of the FMS pair of arms that measure the larger borehole radius. The orientation of the breakouts shows that the minimum principal horizontal stress is oriented approximately north–south. In contrast, the borehole is nearly circular and in gauge ( $\lceil\sim\rceil0$ inch diameter) in logging Unit 2 (148– $169~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , which also has a higher natural radioactivity and higher resistivity than Unit 1, suggesting a more consolidated formation. The borehole is washed out in all directions in logging Unit 3 (169–184 mbsf), and low values of natural radioactivity and resistivity are likely artifacts caused by hole enlargement.  

# Site U1414 summary  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective of Expedition 344 was to sample and quantify the material comprising the seismogenic zone of an erosive subduction margin. Fundamental to this objective is an understanding of the nature of the sediment and oceanic crust entering the seismogenic zone, the hydrologic system, and the thermal state of the igneous oceanic crust. Site U1414 (proposed Site CRIS-19A) serves as a secondary reference site on the flank of the subducting aseismic Cocos Ridge (Fig. F6).  

Site U1414 is located within the 3-D seismic volume (Fig. F6) and is $\sim\!1$ km seaward of the deformation front offshore the Osa Peninsula. Site U1414 is located along Inline 2497 and crossing Line 2562 $\!\!\left(8^{\circ}30.22794^{\prime}\mathrm{N},\!\!$ , $84^{\circ}13.52556^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ at $2457\,\mathrm{~m~}$ below sea level. This site was chosen for multiple reasons. First, a clear seismic record of the plate stratigraphy (Fig. F16) is present at this site. The seismic section shows a $400\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sediment section resting on reflective basement interpreted as Cocos Ridge igneous crust. Secondly, the sedimentary section is thought to be composed of pelagic and hemipelagic sediments that may contain the sediment missing at Site U1381 between 2 and 9 Ma as documented by a gap in the Costa Rica tephra record. Thirdly, a reflector of interest exists about two-thirds of the way through the sediment column. Finally, this site presents an opportunity to collect igneous basement.  

The primary science goals at Site U1414 included (1) documenting the presence or absence of the hiatus observed at Site U1381, (2) documenting the presence or absence of tephras in the $2{\-}9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ age range, and (3) documenting the composition and alteration state of basement. Finally, because of oblique convergence of subduction at the Middle America Trench, sediment at Site U1414 likely reflects the sediment now under seismic Line BGR99-7. Documenting the physical state and water content of this sediment is an important objective.  

# Operations  

After a $5.8\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1412, a positioning beacon was deployed at $0010\,\mathrm{h}$ and the vessel stabilized over Site U1414 at $0015\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 December 2012. Hole U1414A $\!\{8^{\circ}30.2304^{\prime}\mathrm{N}}_{\!}$ , $84^{\circ}13.5298^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ , $2459\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth; Table T1) was spudded at $0805\;\mathrm{h}$ . Cores 344-U1414A-1H through 22H were taken from 0 to 200.1 mbsf with the APC. APCT-3 formation temperature measurements were taken with Cores 344-U1414A3H, 5H, 7H, and 9H. The coring system was switched to the XCB after having to drill over Core 344-U1414A-22H. Cores 344-U1414A-23X through 35X were taken from 200.1 to 311.9 mbsf with the XCB, and XCB coring was terminated after penetration rates and recovery drastically decreased. The APC/XCB assembly was raised to just below seafloor, a free-fall funnel was deployed, and the remainder of the drill string was brought to the surface. An RCB BHA was then assembled with a new bit and lowered to just above the seafloor. Hole U1414A was reentered, and Cores 344-U1414A-36R through 63R were recovered with the RCB by $1205\;\mathrm{h}$ on 9 December, including $96\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. Coring was terminated so that logging could begin.  

In preparation for logging, the hole was swept clean with mud and the bit was released. The end of the drill string was set at 96 mbsf, and the logging tools were rigged up. The first logging run was with the triple combo–UBI tool string and reached a depth of 421 mbsf, where it encountered an obstruction. The second logging run was with the FMS-sonic tool string, and it reached the same depth. Logging activities were completed by $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on December 10. The remainder of the drill string was pulled to the surface while the JOIDES Resolution began a slow move toward land in dynamic positioning mode. The BHA cleared the rig floor at $1955\mathrm{~h~}$ on 10 December, ending Site U1414. The JOIDES Resolution picked up speed at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ and continued the $95\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Puntarenas, Costa Rica. First line ashore was at $0502\mathrm{~h~}$ on 11 December 2012, ending Expedition 344.

# Principal results  

The lithology of the upper part of Hole U1414A (Fig. F17) is characterized by a predominantly monotonous, terrigenous sequence of soft, light greenish gray hemipelagic silty clay to clay with some small sand layers in the uppermost part of Unit I (Subunit IA) and an increasing amount of calcareous nannofossils in the lower part (Subunit IB). Terrigenous material (lithic fragments, glass shards, and minerals) decreases with depth. The Unit I/II boundary at 145.34 mbsf separates greenish gray nannofossil-rich clay sediment from calcareous ooze. Unit II (145.3–309.4 mbsf) is a $164.03\mathrm{~m~}$ thick moderately consolidated interval that is characterized in the upper part by nannofossil calcareous ooze. In the lower part it is alternating calcareous nannofossil ooze and biosilica-rich calcareous ooze. Unit III $(309.4–375.3\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ is a $65.88\;\mathrm{m}$ thick interval that is characterized by a sequence of lithified, calcareous, and siliceous cemented silt- and sandstone that probably lost biogenic components as a result of diagenetic remobilization but still preserves the original sedimentary structures such as bedding and bioturbation. Tephra layers and pods are rare $(1\%)$ , but despite their dark brown to black macroscopic appearance, the glass shards are mainly transparent under the microscope, implying an evolved rather than a mafic volcanic origin.  

Igneous basement, encountered at 375.2 mbsf, comprises a ${\sim}65\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of massive basalt (Cores 344-U1414A-45R through 59R) overlying a $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ thick interval of intercalated sediment. Below the sediment is a second (at least ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) massive basaltic unit. We tentatively identify two units based on the presence of the intercalated sediment, which defines a clear boundary between these two units.  

Igneous Unit 1 is primarily massive and microcrystalline. Phenocryst abundance ranges from aphyric to highly plagioclase phyric. Olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts are also tentatively identified by hand-specimen observation. Increased phenocryst abundance and size are typically associated with increased grain size, ranging from nonvesicular to highly vesicular. Most vesicles $(\sim\!98\%)$ are filled with an unidentified green secondary mineral and occasionally carbonate, pyrite, and silicates. Highly vesicular intervals exhibit finer groundmass (micro- to cryptocrystalline). Two unusual cryptocrystalline “tubes” were observed within Cores 344-U1414A-51R and 57R, which we interpret as a possible pressure-induced intrusion. Groundmass alteration is slight to moderate with partial replacement of plagioclase and partial to complete replacement of olivine and clinopyroxene. Veins are composed of carbonate, sulfides, silicates, and unidentified green minerals that are evenly distributed throughout. Larger veins exhibit evidence of multiple filling episodes, with carbonate and silicates typically observed in the central portion of the veins. The presence of partially recrystallized sediment below Unit 1 could suggest that the basalt intruded into the sediment as a sill. However, the upper and lower contacts were not recovered.  

Igneous Unit 3 exhibits similar groundmass textures (i.e., phenocryst variation, vesicle distribution, and grain size) as Unit 1. The uppermost part of Unit 3 is composed of devitrified glass followed by a $70\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick interval of basalt clastic breccia with an unidentified dark gray/olive green mineral forming the matrix. Clasts are moderately to highly altered and exhibit a partially preserved jigsaw-puzzle morphology that indicates that the breccia formed in situ with no mass transport. Overall, groundmass alteration is slight to moderate with partial replacement of plagioclase and partial to complete replacement of olivine and clinopyroxene. Veins are composed of carbonate, sulfides, silicates, and unidentified green minerals that occur in the upper two-thirds of Unit 3. Larger veins exhibit evidence of multiple filling episodes, with carbonate and silicates typically observed in the central portion of the veins. In the lower portion of Unit 3 (Cores 344-U1414-59R and 63R), veins are predominantly composed of carbonate with minor silicates and pyrite. Narrow submillimeter veins with a dark mineral are present.  

Biostratigraphy in Hole U1414A is constrained by radiolarians and nannofossils. Nannofossils have “moderate” preservation overall, with evidence of recrystallization downhole. Radiolarians are well preserved overall, with intervals of poor preservation between Samples 344-U1414A-17H-CC and 21H-CC. The presence of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa and Collosphaera tuberosa indicates that the upper ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{m}$ was deposited in the Pleistocene. Radiolarian and nannofossil assemblages at the base of Hole U1414A constrain the age of the oldest sediment to the middle Miocene.  

Foraminiferal work was conducted on 34 core catcher samples. Generally, the abundance of benthic foraminifers varied from “common” to “few,” with a few particular intervals where benthic foraminifers were only “present.” Preservation was good to moderate except for some samples contained in lithologic Subunit IIB, where foraminiferal preservation was poor with tests showing signs of recrystallization.  

Overall, two main benthic foraminiferal assemblages can be distinguished in this hole. The upper assemblage (0–140 mbsf) includes “Globobulimina” group species Uvigerina auberiana and, as accessory species, Uvigerina cf. senticosa, Cassidulina carinata, and Melonis affinis. The lower assemblage (140–320 mbsf) is composed of species belonging to the “Cibicides” group, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Pullenia spp. and Uvigerina cf. senticosa. In Sample 344-U1414A-12H-CC we found the last appearance of the Stilostomella group species, which indicates an age older than $0.6\,\mathrm{Ma}$ for that group. The base of the hole (Samples 344-U1414A-30H-CC through 34H-CC) contains specimens of Planulina renzi. This species died out during the middle Miocene. This age is in agreement with the biostratigraphic constraints for that interval.  

Site U1414 has subhorizontal to gently dipping bedding. Few faults, generally normal, were observed in Units I and II. Unit III is characterized by strong foliation and veins. Unit III is slightly metamorphosed. Some shear zones are also recognized.  

We completed chemical analyses on 61 interstitial water samples collected from Site U1414. The pore fluid composition in the uppermost $80\;\mathrm{m}$ shows trends characteristic of organic matter remineralization. In addition, coincident minima in ammonium and sulfate concentrations at 37 mbsf suggest that there may be favorable conditions for sulfate-reducing ammonium oxidation. The feasibility of this metabolic pathway in marine sediment was recently documented for the first time in sediment from the Bay of Bengal, India.  

The sulfate concentration-depth profile at this site is also unusual in that it displays a second minimum at 330 mbsf, which corresponds to a sharp minimum in calcium and a maximum in barium concentrations. These data suggest lateral flow of a sulfatedepleted fluid, which originated from microbial oxidation of methane and/or other organic carbon sources landward of Site U1414 and migrated updip through the upper sediment of Unit III. The calcium minimum thus likely reflects a combination of in situ carbonate formation caused by the ongoing sulfate reduction and a contribution from the laterally migrating fluid having low calcium concentration. Similarly, the barium concentration, which mirrors the sulfate profile at depth, is controlled by the stability of the mineral barite $\mathrm{(BaSO_{4})}$ ; thus, the increase in barium may reflect both in situ marine barite dissolution at the sulfate minimum plus barium contribution from the laterally migrating low-sulfate fluid. Postcruise isotopic analyses of the carbon species, solid-phase barite and carbonate analyses, and numerical modeling will be required to determine the origin and history of the fluid flow at depth in this input sediment section.  

The incoming sediment also displays changes in composition driven by the nature of the lithology and associated diagenetic reactions. Both major and minor element profiles show a marked discontinuity at ${\sim}195~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , which corresponds to the lithologic Subunit IIA/IIB boundary. These strong discontinuities can only be maintained by a diagenetic diffusion barrier, which was not observed in the cores. However, it coincides with the change from APC to XCB cores triggered by APC refusal and a $4\,\mathrm{m}$ thick interval of sediment that was not recovered.  

Lithologic changes at this site are apparent in the silica profile, which is characterized by typical silicate mineral diagenesis. The gradual increase in the amount of biogenic opal in the sediment from the silty clay/sand–dominated Unit I through the nannofossil-rich clay in Subunit IB is apparent as a monotonic increase in dissolved silica. The change from the nannofossil-rich clay of Subunit IB to the nannofossil-rich calcareous ooze of Subunit IIA coincides with a sharp decrease in Si concentrations. Another marked increase in Si concentrations across the lithologic Subunit IIA/IIB boundary reflects a change in fluid-rock reactions in Subunit IIB that are dominated by the opal-A solubility at the in situ temperature of ${\sim}35^{\circ}{-}45^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Near the base of Subunit IIB there is a distinct decrease in Si concentrations, which coincides with a clear decrease in dissolved K concentrations, consistent with clinoptilolite formation, a K-Si-rich zeolite, which is also apparent in the XRD data.  

Bulk density and porosity data are complicated by the combination of lithologic changes and variations in diagenesis. Compaction is very slight in Unit I, with porosity values of $69\%$ at 145 mbsf. Below 145 mbsf, porosity values decrease to $54\%$ and then gradually increase to ${>}75\%$ near 225 mbsf before decreasing to the base of the hole. Background magnetic susceptibility values generally decrease with depth, reaching near-zero values below 350 mbsf. Excursions generally correspond to tephra layers. NGR values are generally stable in the upper $110~\mathrm{m}$ , rise to a peak at $130\ \mathrm{mbsf}_{1}$ , and then decrease with depth to the Unit II/III boundary. NGR values are scattered in Unit III, with a peak near 350 mbsf. $P\cdot$ -wave velocities from the split cores decrease in the upper $25~\mathrm{m}$ and then gradually increase with depth. Overall, $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocities in Unit I are low, averaging $1520\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . A local maximum at $\mathord{\sim}190$ mbsf corresponds to a bulk density maximum and porosity minimum. $P$ -wave velocities between 300 and 340 mbsf average $1850\ \mathrm{m/s}$ and then sharply increase to $3260~\mathrm{m/s}$ below 340 mbsf. Thermal conductivity shows variations consistent with bulk density. Strength values rise steadily in Unit I and Subunit IIA. Four downhole temperature measurements yield a thermal gradient of $168^{\circ}\mathrm{C/km}$ .  

We measured the NRM and performed AF demagnetization on all archive section halves and several discrete samples from Site U1414. In general, variations in NRM intensity follow changes in lithology, especially in the light green calcareous ooze of Hole U1414A. Several intervals of normal and reversed polarity are present but have not been correlated with the geomagnetic polarity timescale yet.  

The logging program in Hole U1414A included two runs with the triple combo–UBI and FMS-sonic tool strings. Logs were collected from 96 to ${\sim}410$ mbsf and include spectral gamma radiation, bulk density, electrical resistivity, $P.$ - and S-wave velocity, and ultrasonic and resistivity images of the borehole wall.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 344 was superlative, and with the exception of not reaching the décollement and the underthrust sediment at the toe site (U1412), exceeded expectations. We recovered material across the Costa Rica erosive convergent margin offshore the Osa Peninsula. Material was recovered from the incoming Cocos plate (Sites U1381 and U1414), the toe of the margin (Site U1412), the midslope region (Site U1380), and the upper slope region (Site U1413).  

Recovery was very good at the incoming plate sites, good at the midslope and upper slope sites, and poor at the toe site. At Sites U1381 and U1414 we collected 76 cores with a recovery of $86\%$ , at Sites U1380 and U1413 we collected 122 cores with a recovery of $75\%$ , and at Site U1412 we collected 55 cores with a recovery of $54\%$ (see “Expedition 344 principal results” for details).  

The overarching goal of Expedition 344 was a better understanding of seismogenesis at erosive convergent margins through shallow drilling. A second objective was to better understand erosive convergent margins. In this respect, Expedition 344 has given us an increased understanding of subduction erosion that has led to important new insights. Most of the science objectives were achieved. Below we assess these objectives and highlight major results.  

# 1. Estimate the composition, texture, and physical properties of the upper plate material.  

Slope sediment was recovered at Sites U1380 and U1413. Seismic reflection data over both sites show that the slope sediment unconformably overlies a lower unit. The lower unit at Site U1380 was identified as upper plate basement prior to drilling. Both of these slope sites are divided into three units. Unit I at Sites U1380 and U1413 consists of slope sediment and is characterized silty clay and fine sandstones. Unit II at both sites is characterized by clayey siltstone lithified to varying degrees with calcite cement. Sands are present in these units and tend to be less well lithified. At Site U1380, Unit III consists of silty claystone with intercalated massive coarse sandstones that are well lithified with calcite cement. At Site U1413, Unit III consists of fine- to medium-grained sandstone and siltstone. Units I and III of Site U1380 and all units of Site U1413 represent terrestrially sourced upper slope sequences. Unit II of Site U1380 represents a terrestrially sourced shelf sequence. High sedimentation rates throughout the depositional interval were observed at both sites. Observed organic debris and thin normally graded sands with sharp erosional bases indicate deposition within the distal facies of a clastic turbidite sequence. Carbonate cements are ubiquitous at these sites.  

The upper part of Hole U1380C (438–551 mbsf) is characterized by abundant faults and fractures and steeply dipping bedding planes, whereas the lower part of this hole (551–797 mbsf) is characterized by less steeply dipping beds. Two structural domains are also identified at Site U1413. The upper domain (0–180 mbsf) is characterized by subhorizontal to gently dipping bedding planes, and the lower domain (180– $582.2\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ is characterized by a downhole increase in bedding dips and an abundance of fault structures.  

Physical properties show a strong, sharp change at the boundary between upper slope sediment and upper plate basement. In the upper plate basement, magnetic susceptibility becomes more variable; NGR counts decrease; bulk density increases; porosity decreases; and thermal conductivity, $P$ -wave velocity, and sediment strength increase.  

A major result is that the upper plate material drilled at Site U1380 is not a mélange of oceanic material or the offshore extension of the Caribbean large igneous complex, but forearc basin material consisting of lithic sedimentary units.  

# 2. Assess rates of sediment accumulation and margin subsidence in slope sediment.  

Expedition 344 successfully recovered slope sediment at Sites U1380 and U1413. Preliminary biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic ages from Sites U1380 and U1413 indicate high sediment accumulation rates in the terrestrially sourced slope sequence. Estimates of slope accumulation rates at Site U1380 vary between $\sim\!\!290$ and $590\,\mathrm{m/m.y.}$ At Site U1413, mass transport deposits make accumulation rates more complicated, but rates vary between 380 and $432\;\mathrm{m/m.}\mathrm{}$ y. These accumulation rates are remarkably high and could be due to enhanced erosion rates caused by the subduction of the Cocos Ridge or alternatively by subducting bathymetry that may erode the margin, creating lows that are then filled. These rates are the same order of magnitude as those determined during Expedition 334 at Sites U1378 and U1379 (Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012a, 2012b) and an order of magnitude larger than those determined offshore the Nicoya Peninsula (Kimura, Silver, Blum, et al., 1997).  

Onshore research of sedimentary facies and benthic foraminifers in slope sediment at Sites U1380 and U1413 will be used to assess margin subsidence and evolution. Expedition 344 was successful at obtaining the material necessary for these onshore studies. An important preliminary implication of the high accumulation rates is that this margin has undergone high rates of vertical motion.  

# 3. Evaluate fluid/rock interaction, the hydrologic system, and geochemical processes as indicated by the composition and pore fluids within the upper plate.  

Fluids play a large role in subduction zone processes and dynamics. Thus, understanding their pathways as they enter and exit subduction zones is of fundamental importance and was an important goal of this expedition. The flow of fluids influences the thermal regime, as well as solute budgets and their transfer between the ocean, volcanic arc, and mantle. The distribution of fluid pressure within subduction zones influences flow velocities, effective stress, and fault strength. The chemistry of fluids advected toward the surface can be used to infer reactions occurring at depth and their potential role in seismogenesis.  

Solute concentrations indicative of fluid flow were observed in three different environments. These environments include the upper basement of the incoming Cocos plate at Site U1381, within high-permeability sediment above basement at Site U1414, and associated with a shear zone within the lower slope at Site U1380.  

At midslope Site U1380, the presence of fluid flow through a shear zone that extends from $\mathord{\sim}480$ to $550\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ , at the boundary between lithologic Units I and II, is indicated by anomalous values of Cl, Li, and hydrocarbon data. These tracers indicate that this fluid originated from a source depth where temperatures are ${\sim}80^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . At upper slope Site U1413, no unequivocal evidence for fluid flow was observed.  

At input Site U1381, concentration-depth profiles of Ca, ${\mathrm{SO}}_{4},$ , Li, $\mathbf{Mn}$ , and possibly Si solutes indicate the diffusion of fluids with seawater-like chemistry in the igneous basement. In fact, vigorous flow in the subducting oceanic basement is suggested by anomalously high heat flow measured at these sites. In contrast, at Site U1414, the cemented sandstone unit at the base of the sediment inhibits the diffusional signal of fluids within the subducting basement. Here, the lateral flow of fluids just above the basement is indicated by a sulfate and calcium minimum at ${\sim}330~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . This pattern reflects a lateral flow of sulfate-depleted fluids that likely originated from oxidation of methane and/or other organic carbon sources landward of Site U1414 and migrated updip through more permeable sediment. This flow overprints any potential diffusive signature of flow in the basement. High heat suggests the presence of advective fluid flow.  

At toe Site U1412, borehole stability was an issue that precluded crossing the décollement and recovering the underthrust sediment and igneous basement. The geochemistry  of  pore  fluids  largely  indicates  in  situ  diagenetic  reactions.  Lithium concentration values indicate diffusive communication with a fluid originating from a source depth where temperatures are ${\sim}80^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The direct lack of evidence for fluid flow, however, is likely due to the lack of recovered sediment.  

Pore fluids in the uppermost ${\sim}50\mathrm{~m~}$ at all margin sites drilled during Expedition 344 are dominated by reactions associated with the cycling of organic carbon. Within the uppermost $50\textrm{m}$ of the sites drilled on the slope, active sulfate reduction, biogenic methane production, and precipitation of authigenic carbonates was observed. The depth of the SMT varies from site to site, with the shallowest SMT occurring at a depth of $\mathord{\sim}14$ mbsf at Site U1412. At input Sites U1381 and U1414, there is no methane production and sulfate is controlled by organic matter catabolic reactions.  

# 4. Estimate the stress field along the CRISP transect.  

In the CRISP study area, paleostress is assessed through the structural analysis of faults, present-day in situ stress is estimated from borehole breakout data, and anelastic strain recovery measurements are estimated on recovered whole rounds.  

At Site U1380, kinematic fault analysis indicates a paleoextensional stress regime with maximum and minimum compressive stresses oriented to the vertical and northeast– southwest, respectively. Both normal and reverse faults were observed at Site U1413, indicating multiple generations of faulting.  

Preliminary analysis of borehole breakouts at Site U1413 revealed borehole breakouts between 148 and 169 mbsf, indicating a minimum compressive stress oriented north– south. This stress orientation corresponds to an upper slope extensional stress regime and is consistent with upper slope extension at Site U1379 found during Expedition 334.  

# 5. Better understand the impact of Cocos Ridge subduction, the evolution of the Central American volcanic arc, and the development of the volcanic gap inboard of the Cocos Ridge.  

A fundamental question is whether Central American volcanism ceased with the arrival of the Cocos Ridge and how volcanism evolved subsequent to the arrival of the ridge. Expeditions 334 and 344 drilled into the sediment and basalt of the Cocos Ridge for the first time. At Site U1381, $109~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and 81 tephras were recovered. At Site U1414, $375\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment and 36 tephras were recovered, as well as $96\;\mathrm{m}$ of basaltic crust. At Site U1414, a gap in the tephra record between mid- to late Pleistocene and middle Miocene has likely been recovered. Biostratigraphic analysis shows that sediment containing $\mathord{\sim}20$ felsic tephra layers during this time period was recovered. Analyses of these tephra will yield new insights into the evolution of Central American volcanism.  

# Education and outreach  

Education and outreach efforts during Expedition 344 focused on using social media sites, interviews, and animations to communicate scientific objectives to the public. Blogs and photos were added daily to joidesresolution.org/, Facebook, and Twitter. Approximately 30 videoconferences were conducted with students in schools and universities in the USA, France, and Japan (Table T2). Finally, a series of videos highlighting CRISP science were released during the expedition and will continue to be produced postcruise.

Figure F1. Topographic and bathymetric map of the Costa Rica area, showing location of Expedition 344 drilling area. Seafloor bathymetry is based on satellite gravimetry and swath mapping (Barckhausen et al., 2001; Fisher et al., 2003; von Huene et al., 2000). Note the collision of Cocos Ridge with the trench offshore the Osa Peninsula. This process brings the seismogenic zone within reach of IODP riser drilling capabilities. DSDP $=$ Deep Sea Drilling Project, $\mathrm{ODP}=$ Ocean Drilling Program. Inset shows tectonic setting of Central America, including the plates that interact in this region: North America (NA), Caribbean (CA), South America (SA), Nazca (NZ), Cocos (CO), and Pacific (PA). EPR $=$ East Pacific Rise, $\mathrm{CNS=}$ Cocos-Nazca spreading center.

Figure F3. Seismicity along the Costa Rica margin with Expedition 344 site locations. Small black circles show seismicity recorded by Sismologica Nacional in 1992–2007. Focal mechanisms correspond to large earthquakes $(\mathrm{Mw}>6.4)$ ) nucleated in the seismogenic zone over the past 25 y. Red circles show aftershocks from the 2002 Osa event, and beige circles show aftershocks from the 1999 Quepos event (modified from Arroyo et al., 2011). Triangles, squares, and diamonds show various seismic networks.

Figure F4. Heat flow data offshore Costa Rica. Color-coded circles indicate heat flow values (Von Herzen and Uyeda, 1963; Vacquier et al., 1967; Langseth and Silver, 1996; Fisher et al., 2003; Hutnak et al., 2007; Harris et al., 2010a). Stars show locations of Expedition 344 drill sites. Dashed red line indicates the position of the thermal transition between areas of relatively low and high heat flow. East Pacific Rise (EPR)-generated crust to the north of the triple junction and fracture zone traces has heat flow suppressed by roughly $70\%$ , whereas Cocos-Nazca spreading center (CNS)-generated crust to the south generally has heat flow that matches conductive lithospheric cooling models (Hutnak et al., 2007, 2008).
