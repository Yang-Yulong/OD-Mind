# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 368 is th e second of two consecutive cruises that form the South China Se a Rifted Margin program. Expeditions 367 and 368 share the common key objectives of testing scientific hypotheses of breakup of th e northern South China Sea (SCS) margin and comparing its riftin g style and history to other nonvolcanic or magma-poor rifted margins. Four primary sites were selected for the overall program: on e in the outer margin high (OMH) and three seaward of the OMH o n distinct, margin-parallel basement ridges. These three ridges are informally labeled A, B, and C. They are located within the continent– ocean transition (COT) zone ranging from the OMH to the interpreted steady-state oceanic crust (Ridge C) of the SCS. The mai n scientific objectives include  

1. Determining the nature of the basement within crustal units across the COT of the SCS that are critical to constrain style of rifting,   
2. Constraining the time interval from initial crustal extension and plate rupture to the initial generation of igneous ocean crust,   
3. Constraining vertical crustal movements during breakup, and   
4. Examining the nature of igneous activity from rifting to seafloor spreading.  

In addition, the sediment cores from the drill sites targeting primarily tectonic and basement objectives will provide informatio n on the Cenozoic regional environmental development of the Southeast Asia margin.  

Expedition 368 was planned to drill at two primary sites (U150 1 and U1503) at the OMH and Ridge C, respectively. However, base d on drilling results from Expedition 367, Expedition 368 chose to insert an alternate site on Ridge A (Site U1502). In total, the expedition completed operations at four sites (U1501, U1502, U1504, an d U1505). Site U1503, however, was not completed beyond casing t o $990\;\mathrm{m}$ because of mechanical problems with the drilling equipmen t that limited the expedition from 25 May 2017 to the end of the expedition to operate with a drill string not longer than $3400\;\mathrm{m}$ . Ne w alternate Site U1504 proposed during Expedition 367 met this condition. Site U1505 also met the operational constraints of the 340 0 m drill string (total) and was an alternate site for the already drille d Site U1501.  

At Site U1501, we cored to $697.1\mathrm{~m~}$ in 9.4 days, with $78.5\%$ recovery. We also drilled ahead for $433.5\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1501D and the n logged downhole data from 78.3 to $399.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . In 19.3 days at Sit e U1502, we penetrated $1679.0\;\mathrm{m}$ , set $723.7\mathrm{~m~}$ of casing and cored  a total of $576.3\mathrm{~m~}$ with $53.5\%$ recovery, and collected downhole lo g data from 785.3 to $875.3\;\mathrm{m}$ and seismic data through the $10\%$ inc h casing. At Site U1503, we penetrated $995.1\ \mathrm{m}_{:}$ , setting $991.5\mathrm{~m~}$ o f $10\%$ inch casing, but no cores were taken. At Site U1504, we took 4 0 rotary core barrel (RCB) cores over two holes. The cored interva l between both holes was $277.3\mathrm{~m~}$ with $26.8\%$ recovery. An $88.2\textrm{m}$ interval was drilled in Hole U1504B. At Site U1505, we cored 668. 0 m with $101.1\%$ recovery. Logging data was collected from 80.1 t o $341.2\mathrm{~m~}$ . Operations at this site covered 6.1 days. Except for Sit e U1505, we drilled to acoustic basement, which prior to the expedition, except for Site U1501, had been interpreted to be crystallin e basement. A total of 6.65 days were lost due to mechanical breakdown or waiting on spare supplies for repair of drilling equipment.  

At Site U1501 on the OMH, coring ${\sim}45\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into the acousti c basement sampled highly lithified sandstone to conglomerate o f presumed Mesozoic age overlain by siliciclastic Eocene pre- to synrift sediments of Oligocene age and topped by primarily carbonaceous postrift sediments of early Miocene to Pleistocene age. Sit e U1502 on Ridge A was cased to $723.7\mathrm{~m~}$ . At this site, we recovere d $180~\mathrm{~m~}$ of hydrothermally altered brecciated basalts comprisin g sheet and pillow lavas below deep-marine sediments of Oligocen e to late Miocene age. Coring was not performed within the uppe r $380\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (\~Pliocene–Pleistocene) at Site U1502. At Site U1503 o n Ridge C, $991.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of casing was installed in preparation for th e planned deep drilling to ${\sim}1800\,\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , but no coring was performed du e to mechanical failures, and the site was abandoned without furthe r activity. Coring at Site U1504 on the OMH ${\sim}45~\mathrm{km}$ east of Sit e U1501 recovered metamorphic schist to gneiss (greenschist facies ) below late Eocene (?) carbonate rocks (partly reef debris) and earl y Miocene to Pleistocene sediments. At Site U1505, we cored t o $480.15\,\mathrm{~m~}$ through Pleistocene to late Oligocene mainly carbonaceous ooze followed at depth by early Oligocene to late Eocene siliciclastic sediments.  

Efforts were made at every drill site to correlate the core wit h the seismic data and seismic stratigraphic unconformities interpreted within the Eocene to Plio–Pleistocene sedimentary sequenc e prior to drilling. The predrilling interpretation of ages of these unconformities was in general confirmed by drilling results.  

As a result of the constraints on the length of drill string tha t could be deployed during the later part of Expedition 368, the secondary expedition objectives addressing the environmental histor y of the SCS and Southeast Asia received more focus than planne d because these sites are located in shallower water depths and required less penetration depth. This forced change in emphasis, however, was without fatal consequences for the primary tectoni c objectives. The two expeditions together provided solid evidenc e for a process of breakup that included vigorous synrift magmatis m as opposed to the often-favored interpretation of the SCS margin a s a magma-starved margin.  

# Introduction  

The South China Sea (SCS) margin (Figure F1) is an accessibl e and well-imaged location where drilling of synrift sediment and underlying basement will provide key constraints on the processes o f rifting and eventual rupturing of the continental lithosphere durin g breakup at a highly extended rifted margin. Expeditions 367 an d 368 were based on International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP ) drilling Proposals 878-CPP, 878-Add, 878-Add2, and 878-Add3. This project was implemented as a single science program with 11 4 days of drilling operations spread across two IODP expeditions a s outlined in the Expedition 367/368 Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Two expeditions were required to drill four deep-penetration sites in a transect across the margin. Three sites targeted acoustic basement in the continent–ocean transition (COT), and one sit e targeted late prerift to synrift sequences on the landward side of th e transect. Although the primary focus of this drilling expedition is t o discriminate between possible models for rifting and plate rupture, the drilling, along with results from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP ) Leg 184 and IODP Expedition 349, addresses secondary objective s to improve our understanding of the Cenozoic environmental development of the southeast Asian area as recorded within the sediments of the SCS basin. The drilling strategy for Expeditions 36 7 and 368, however, primarily targeted the deep basement coring an d logging objectives.  

# Background Global questions regarding formation of rifted margins  

The Ocean Drilling Program (1985–2003) made a major effor t along the rifted margins of the North Atlantic to understand th e processes of continental breakup (ODP Legs 103, 104, 149, 152, 163, 173, and 210). This effort resulted in the recognition of two endmembers of rifted margins (see summary of observations in Sun e t al., 2016a, 2016b).  

The first recognized end-member is volcanic rifted margins, examples of which are characterized by massive igneous activity in  a relatively short period of time $_{\sim1-3}$ million years) during breaku p and initial seafloor spreading. The pair of conjugate margins o f Greenland and northwest Europe is a type example. In these locations, the asthenospheric mantle may have been anomalously ho t (e.g., mantle plumes), leading to thermal weakening of the continental lithosphere followed by rapid plate rupture.  

The second recognized end-member is magma-poor rifted margins, which are interpreted to endure hyperextension of the continental crust, with tectonic extension at the distal margin eventuall y exhuming the subcontinental mantle lithosphere and leading to serpentinization of the mantle. The Newfoundland and Iberia conjugate margin, where serpentinite occupies a broad zone within th e COT zone, is an example of this type of margin and is the only conjugate margin pair where this interpretation has been confirmed b y scientific drilling. The introduction of water to the subcontinenta l lithospheric mantle is interpreted to have taken place through deep, crust-cutting faults, causing serpentinization that profoundly weakens the mantle lithosphere and facilitates plate rupture. The subsequent  ultraslow  spreading  led  to  formation  of  additiona l serpentinite on the seafloor (e.g., Dick et al., 2003) until sufficien t magma production for normal oceanic crust to form was established.  

Other examples of highly extended rifted margins have bee n identified in seismic reflection data elsewhere (e.g., Brune et al., 2017; Doré and Lundin, 2015). However, it is not known if serpentinized mantle plays a critical role in all cases. Modeling by Huismans and Beaumont (2008, 2011) suggests several scenarios fo r the formation of rifted margins in the absence of anomalously ho t asthenospheric mantle. One scenario (Type I of Huismans an d Beaumont, 2011) is the Iberia-Newfoundland-type margin described above. In this case, lithospheric thinning initially occurs i n the (upper) crust, with extensional faults profoundly thinning th e continental crust (hyperextension) and eventually reaching th e mantle and causing serpentinization (Whitmarsh et al., 2001; PérezGussinyé and Reston, 2001; Pérez-Gussinyé et al., 2006; Reston, 2009; Sutra and Manatschal, 2012). The schematic model of thi s type of margin development, shown in Figure F2, guided the drillin g strategy of Expedition 367/368. Huismans and Beaumont (2008, 2011), however, also suggest that final plate rupture can occur without exhumation of the subcontinental mantle and be followe d rather quickly by igneous ocean crust formation, a scenario that ou r chosen drilling strategy will also test. The highly extended norther n margin of the SCS is therefore an excellent location to examin e through drilling whether this margin endured magmatism durin g breakup or its development is closer to the Iberia-type, amagmati c margin.  

# Geological setting  

The SCS is a modestly sized young ocean basin that forme d along the eastern boundary of the Eurasian plate during mid- to lat e Cenozoic time (Figure F1). Expeditions 367 and 368 cored an d logged a transect of drill sites across the COT in the northern SC S (Figure F2).  

The continental crust that was rifted to form the SCS was accreted to the Asian margin during the Mesozoic (Zhou and Li, 2000; Zhou et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b). Within ${\sim}80$ million years, this relatively young continental lithosphere underwent extensiv e rifting during the Paleogene, likely within the Eocene to early Oligocene (Figure F3). Seafloor spreading in the SCS started during th e Oligocene, with the oldest interpreted magnetic anomaly in the are a of the drilling transect interpreted to be Anomaly C11 $({\sim}29.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ or C12n ${\sim}31\,\mathrm{Ma})$ (Briais et al., 1993; Li et al., 2013, 2014; Franke e t al., 2013). A later expansion of seafloor spreading into the southwes t SCS took place from ${\sim}23\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Briais et al., 1993; Barckhausen an d Roeser, 2004; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b; Franke et al., 2013).  

The initial half-spreading rate was ${\sim}3.6~\mathrm{cm/y},$ later slowing t o $1.2\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{y}$ with seafloor spreading to eventually cease by ${\sim}15\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (L i et al., 2014). The initial spreading rate in the SCS basin is therefor e higher than the ultraslow spreading scenario of the Iberia-Newfoundland margin (Dick, 2003). Subduction of the eastern part o f the SCS basin started at or before ${\sim}15$ Ma along the Manila Trenc h (Li et al., 2013). For a more complete review of the regional settin g and tectonic development of the SCS, see Shi and Li (2012), Li et al. (2013), Sun et al. (2014), and Franke et al. (2013).  

The Expedition 367/368 drilling transect is located ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{km}$ wes t of IODP Site U1435 (Figures F1, F2, F4) (Li et al., 2015a, 2015b ) along the northern SCS margin. A transform fault defines a wester n boundary of a margin segment that exhibits a broad zone of crustal extension (Figure F4). This broad zone of extension (COT) may en d to the east somewhere between Sites U1432 and U1435. East of thi s position, continental crust seems to thin into ocean crust within  a much narrower COT.  

The segment of the SCS margin addressed by Expeditions 36 7 and 368 is therefore characterized by a broad COT $({\sim}150~\mathrm{km})$ o f crustal stretching and extension prior to breakup. A deep sag basi n (midslope basin [MSB]) of presumed Eocene to Oligocene age i s present within the midslope area (Figure F3) and is bounded seaward by an outer margin high (OMH) forming a quite persisten t structure along the margin. Three distinct ridges (A, B, and C in Figures F3, F4) are found seaward of the OMH within the more distal margin and on progressively thinner crust within the COT. We refe r to the continent/ocean boundary (COB) as the much narrower zon e in which the outermost, highly thinned continental lithosphere i s replaced seaward by new crust that formed within a narrow zone a t a spreading ridge in a steady-state fashion. The latter can includ e continuous tectonic exhumation of rising lithospheric mantle (e.g., Dick et al., 2003), accretion of normal igneous oceanic crust, or  a mixture of these two processes. The nature and precise location o f the COB at the SCS cannot with any confidence be interpreted fro m the seismic data without drilling control.  

The clear seismic reflections from the Mohorovicic seismic discontinuity (Moho) show distinct thinning of the continental crus t (Figure F3) across the COT with a thickness of ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}$ around th e seaward end of the COT. Separate layers hypothesized to be upper, middle, and lower crust are present within the landward part o f these seismic profiles. The lower crust is acoustically transparen t and may in places be as thin as ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}$ . Lower crust with a simila r thickness and seismic appearance is reported from the northeaster n SCS margin (McIntosh et al., 2013, 2014; Lester et al., 2013). Th e seaward continuation of this crustal layering into the COB zone is, however, ambiguous, and prevents us from interpreting the exac t location and the detailed nature of the COB.  

The upper crust shows numerous extensional, low-angle detachment faults soling out at midcrustal level. This fault system generated a number of deep half-grabens filled with synrift sediment s that were subsequently covered by postrift sediments. The boundary between synrift sediment and postrift sediments may follow th e seismic stratigraphic unconformity named T70 (Figure F3). Industry data from distant wells results suggest a breakup unconformit y age of ${\sim}34\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . However, the time of crustal extension is not necessarily synchronous across the margin and could be younger towar d the outer margin. A younger, widely distributed unconformity (T60 ) is also shown in Figure F3. The T60 unconformity corresponds to  a hiatus at ${\sim}23$ Ma found at ODP Site U1148 (Wang, Prell, Blum, e t al., 2000) and IODP Site U1435. T60 is approximately synchronou s with a southward jump of the SCS spreading axis (Briais et al., 1993).  

The OMH hosts a number of relatively shallow half-graben basins on top of this broad basement high. The stratigraphy of thes e smaller basins can be traced seismically into the deeper, central basin sag below the MSB (Figure F3). The normal faults boundin g these OMH basins are clearly imaged and, for the main part, di p landward. These small rift basins, therefore, offer an opportunity t o sample the stratigraphy covering the entire period of rifting an d postrift subsidence. The MSB itself is bounded landward by major, seaward-dipping normal fault(s) seemingly forming major detachments soling out at middle to lower crustal levels but not penetrating through the lower crust. If true, this suggests decouplin g between the upper and lower crust and, at least within this mor e landward part of the margin, faults never penetrated the lower curs t (remained ductile?).  

The lower crust within the COT may thicken seaward (lowe r crustal flow?), but this possibility is not well constrained (Figur e F3). Likewise, seismic imaging of the low-angle faults and detachments within the landward part of the COT cannot, with confidence, be traced into the distal margin regime. One possibility i s that the main detachment zone was located above what later became Ridge A, effectively implying that Ridge A is a core comple x consisting of lower continental crust or subcontinental mantle, depending on how deeply detachments exhumed the lithosphere i n the distal margin. Alternatively, if the main detachment underlie s Ridge A, this structure would represent upper plate material of upper crustal origin.  

Ridge A is for the most part dome-like, showing neither norma l faults nor clearly developed synrift half-grabens like the OMH. Excluding sediment, the crust below this outermost basement high i s only ${\sim}6{-}8\,\mathrm{km}$ thick using the ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) velocity constraints of Yan et al. (2001), Wang et al. (2006), and Wei e t al. (2011). Seaward of Ridge A, the crust has a fairly uniform thickness of $\sim\!6\,\mathrm{km}$ , which could be consistent with oceanic crust (Yan e t al., 2001). Note also that magnetic Anomaly C11 is projected to almost overlap the seaward part of Ridge A (Figures F3, F4).  

Both Ridges B and C consist of fault blocks rotated landwar d along seaward-dipping normal faults. Some of these faults may b e seismically traced to near the base of the crust. Ridge B shows seismic features along strike and within the uppermost crust that coul d be consistent with a volcanic origin. However, these features coul d also be consistent with a rotated fault block of upper continental crust (i.e., a distal extensional rider of upper plate origin), in whic h case the prerift deposits below the seismic unconformity definin g the top of acoustic basement at Ridge B should be present. The seismic layered structure of Ridge B makes it less likely to consist o f lower crust or serpentinized mantle. Ridge C in many ways is seismically similar to Ridge B. However, an apparent reversed magneti c anomaly strongly suggests that this ridge indeed represents close t o if not full igneous ocean crust.  

Sampling the basement at Ridges A, B, and C was therefore essential for Expeditions 367 and 368 to distinguish between differen t tectonic models for breakup along highly extended margins. Ridge s A and B help to constrain the style of rifting. In contrast, Ridge C i s assumed to represent the early igneous crust and will address another key objective of Expeditions 367 and 368 to constrain the nature of early oceanic crust formation, specifically to determine ho w quickly a robust igneous system was established, what mantl e source is involved (e.g., composition, temperature), what condition s of mantle melting (degree and depth of melting) are present, and, i f any, what continental crustal contamination of the igneous material derived from the asthenospheric mantle.  

# Expedition objectives  

The two-expedition drilling transect across the SCS margin se t out to understand the timing and process of rifting, eventual rupturing of the continental crust, and onset of igneous oceanic crust a t a highly extended rifted margin (Figure F2). Four primary and sixteen alternate drill sites across a ${\sim}150\,\mathrm{km}$ wide COT zone were defined within the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). The fou r primary sites were planned to target the four main tectonic feature s (the OMH and its small rift basins) and the nature of the thre e ridges within the distal margin (Ridges A, B, and C). At each of thes e sites, the nature of the acoustic basement and the record of synrif t and postrift deposits were key targets.  

The OMH site (U1501) in particular will address the entire rifting history and provide constraints on the degree of crustal exhumation, if any, within the OMH. Located off the distal margin and a t relatively thick crust, the subsidence history at this site can be compared with that of the more distal margin that suffered a muc h higher degree of crustal stretching. Sampling of late prerift to synrift sediments within the rotated fault block can constrain the timing of rifting and therefore support estimates of the rate o f extension. The site is also in a shallower water depth than the othe r three primary sites and above the present carbonate compensatio n depth (CCD) and therefore has the potential to yield a rich record o f carbonate sediments for detailed paleoclimate studies using stabl e isotope techniques.  

Ridge A in particular would be important for constrainin g whether this ridge, in effect, is a core complex representing lowe r plate material, upper plate extensional fault block, or igneous material related to breakup. Ridge B provides a second option to possibl y recover unroofed, lower plate material, a highly distal upper plat e extensional fault block (i.e., extensional rider), or early igneous material related to incipient seafloor spreading. Ridge C, as describe d above, targets sampling a time series of early ocean floor magmatism to establish a reference frame for understanding and modelin g the entire igneous development of the margin.  

Expedition 367 drilled two of the primary sites (U1499 an d U1500) on Ridges A and B (Figures F2, F3, F4, F5). Coring at Sit e  

U1499 on Ridge A recovered rift-related, syntectonic sediments below the acoustic basement. Because of borehole conditions, however, coring at the site did not penetrate deeply enough to reac h crystalline basement (Sun et al., 2017). Coring at Site U1500 successfully sampled $150\;\mathrm{m}$ of basaltic lavas, including pillow lavas, below the acoustic basement at Ridge B. Both sites recovered lat e Oligocene to Pleistocene postrift sedimentary records.  

Expedition 368 set out to drill the remaining two primary site s on Ridge C (U1503) and the OMH (Site U1501) (Figures F2, F3, F4, F5). However, the Expedition 367 findings of thick, basaltic an d submarine lavas at Site U1500 (Ridge B), along with coring at Sit e U1499 (Ridge A) that did not penetrate to crystalline basement, le d Expedition 368 to initially focus on coring the OMH (Site U1501 ) and pursue a second deep hole on Ridge A (Site U1502) with th e potential consequence of not being able to pursue deep drilling a t Ridge C (Site U1503). A successful drilling strategy (see below), however, allowed us to eventually pursue Site U1503, but after installation of casing, the hole had to be abandoned for drilling technical reasons. This left time for other, alternate sites with shallowe r drilling targets (see Operations).  

# Coring and logging strategy  

Drilling operations were designed to core and log through thic k sediment sections and, significantly, into underlying basement using casing within the upper and unstable part of the sedimentar y sections. Initially, the operational approach was to comprise tw o holes per site (Figure F6).  

The first hole at each site was to be cored with the advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel (XCB) systems to refusa l (or maximum casing depth) and then to be logged with the tripl e combination (triple combo) and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)- sonic tool strings. The APC/XCB hole was also to document borehole and formation conditions to help determine the length of casing to be drilled into the seafloor in a second hole (B). All full AP C cores were intended to be oriented, and formation temperatur e measurements would be made using the advanced piston core r temperature tool (APCT-3).  

The second hole at each site was designed to begin by drilling-i n a seafloor reentry system with casing extending to ${\sim}650\,\mathrm{~m~}$ or a n otherwise defined depth. Casing is drilled down through the reentr y cone using an extendable underreamer and mud motor technolog y (Figure F6). Following the installation of casing to the desired depth , coring using the RCB system could then extend from the base of th e casing through the sediment and into the underlying basement. Multiple pipe trips to replace hard rock RCB bits were to be made a s required by depth of target within basement. Upon completion o f the coring objectives, the RCB bit was to be dropped either in th e bottom of the hole or on the seafloor before downhole wireline logging data could be collected. For this deeper logging, we planned t o use the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings as well as the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) tool string to conduct check shots.  

During Expedition 368, we had to modify this general operational plan in response to borehole conditions and the need to focu s our operations time to achieve our highest priority basement objectives. The planned versus implemented operations are shown i n Figure F6.  

At Site U1501, the pilot hole (U1501C) consisted of APC/XC B coring until refusal. From the findings, we concluded that in this location the formation might be stable enough to continue with th e deeper RCB Hole U1501D to ${\sim}600\mathrm{~m~}$ without casing. Logging wa s therefore not done in Hole U1501C. Hole U1501D was drilled without coring to a slightly shallower depth than Hole U1501C and the n RCB cored to the bottom of the hole. Logging was then executed. This approach saved considerable operation time. We drilled i n Hole U1502A to $375\;\mathrm{m}$ without coring and then cored with the RC B system to identify a proper casing point. Casing was then drilled i n Hole U1502B to the desired depth, followed by RCB coring to target. Single-run logging (triple combo) was then executed in th e open hole below casing with VSI check shots within both open hol e and casing. At Site U1503, we initially drilled in Hole U1503A without coring to a planned casing depth $(990\;\mathrm{m})$ estimated on the basi s of drilling data from Site U1500 ( ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{km}$ away) and seismic correlation between the two sites. A free-fall reentry system was deployed, and casing was subsequently installed in the already establishe d Hole U1503A with the assistance of the underreamer and mud motor. This approach turned out to be very efficient and saved muc h time. Unfortunately, mechanical problems at the rig floor (see Operations) prevented us from further pursuing the site.  

With an operational limit of deploying a maximum of $3400\;\mathrm{m}$ o f drill string for the remainder of Expedition 368, no deep sites requiring casing could be pursued. Site U1504 had a primary basement target below only ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment cover. Hole U1504 A was RCB cored to $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ . Hole U1504B was drilled without corin g to ${\sim}90\;\mathrm{m}$ and continued with RCB coring to $200\;\mathrm{m}$ . No logging wa s pursued.  

Four holes were cored and/or drilled at Site U1505. Hol e U1505C was cored with the APC as deep as possible, further core d with the half-length advanced piston corer (HLAPC) system until refusal, extended by XCB coring until the maximum length of th e drill string was reached at $480\textrm{m}$ , and then logged. Hole U1505 D was cored with the APC to $180\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Site summaries Site U1501  

# Background and objectives  

Site  U1501  (proposed  Site  SCSII-41A; $18^{\circ}53.0923\,\mathrm{N},$ $115^{\circ}45.9455\mathrm{E})$ within the SCS northern margin (Figure F2) is located on a broad regional basement high (OMH). The OMH is th e most landward of four distinct highs within the COT and is followed seaward by Ridges A, B, and C (Figures F3, F4, F7). Sit e U1501 is located at $2846\;\mathrm{m}$ below sea level (mbsl). Small rift basin s of presumed Paleogene age are located on top of the OMH (Figur e F3). These basins can be traced landward into much deeper halfgraben basins that formed during the main phase of crustal extension. The rift basins located on the OMH therefore offer options t o recover the stratigraphy of these basins by moderately deep drilling, testing existing stratigraphic interpretations, and extrapolating th e findings margin wide. Recovering and characterizing these sequences were key objectives at Site U1501, with the specific goal t o constrain the timing and duration of crustal extension, the tectoni c vertical movements during rifting, and the subsequent postrift thermal subsidence. The crystalline basement at Site U1501 is mos t likely located far below the acoustic basement at ${\approx}600\mathrm{~m~}$ and wa s not an objective for this site.  

At 2846 mbsl, Site U1501 is one of the few ODP and IODP site s in the SCS above the modern CCD of the SCS. Sites U1504 an d U1505, also at the OMH, are situated at ${<}3000$ mbsl. The younge r stratigraphy is therefore also the focus of some secondary scientifi c objectives related to Neogene environmental development of th e SCS and adjacent landmasses of Southeast Asia. Among these secondary objectives are to (1) reconstruct the history of the east Asia n monsoon evolution and that of deepwater exchanges between th e SCS and Pacific Ocean and (2) explore the sedimentary responses t o the Cenozoic regional tectonic and environmental development o f the Southeast Asia margin.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in four holes at Site U1501. In Hole s U1501A and U1501B, Core 1H missed the sediment–water interface and retrieved full core barrels, indicating that the core was sho t from  below  the  seafloor.  Hole  U1501C $(18^{\circ}53.0919^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ $115^{\circ}45.9485^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $2846~\mathrm{{mbsl})}$ ) was APC cored from the seafloor t o $461.8\quad\mathrm{~m~}$ and  recovered $447.8\mathrm{~\,~m~}$ $(96.3\%)$ .  Hole  U1501 D $\langle18^{\circ}53.0929^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}45.9370^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $2846~\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was drilled without coring from the seafloor to $433.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and then RCB cored to $644.3~\mathrm{m}$ .  A total of $78.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered $(37.4\%)$ . Hole U1501D wa s logged with the triple combo tool string from 113 to $299.3\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1501 is composed of clay-rich nannofossil ooze, silty clay, clayey silt, sand, an d siltstone and sandstone with minor conglomerate and rare volcani c ash. The succession is divided into three major lithostratigraphi c units (I, II, and III) distinguished on the basis of sediment composition, particularly the relative abundance of the calcareous and siliciclastic fractions (Figure F8).  

Unit I is a $303\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick, Holocene–late Oligocene successio n dominated by clay-rich nannofossil ooze and nannofossil ooze wit h clay, with minor amounts of nannofossil-rich foraminifer sand o r silty sand. A felsic volcanic ash layer occurs in Section 368-U1501A1H-7, and an ash pod was observed in Section 368-U1501C-3H-1. Unit I is divided into six subunits: IA $\left(0{-}25.47\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , IB (25.47–66.1 7 m), IC $66.30{-}156.70\;\mathrm{m})$ ), ID $(156.80{-}191.99\;\mathrm{m})$ , IE (191.99–293.0 9 m), and IF $(293.90{-}303.01\,\mathrm{m})$ ), based on changes in lithology, particularly the clay to nannofossil ratio and the presence and abundanc e of foraminifers, and/or physical properties. The lower contact o f Unit I is erosional and marked by the emplacement of a poorl y sorted sandy layer. At the boundary, marked changes in $P$ -wave velocity, natural gamma radiation (NGR), magnetic susceptibility, porosity,  moisture  and  density,  color,  carbonate  content,  an d biostratigraphy indicate a small hiatus (Figure F8). Unit I was deposited in a deep-marine environment, and lithologic changes between subunits likely reflect the amount of terrigenous input into  a relatively open ocean setting. This input may be delivered as buoyant sediment plumes from shallower shelf environments and rarel y by weak (distal) turbidity currents. Soft-sediment deformation i n Subunit IB indicates slumping downslope of parts of the sequence.  

Unit II is $296~\mathrm{m}$ thick and late Oligocene to late Eocene in age. The unit consists of variable amounts of clay, silt, and sand with minor nannofossil-rich clay, nannofossil ooze, and silt with organi c matter. Gravel-size grains occur, including shell fragments an d glauconite, as well as carbonate and pyrite concretions. Unit II is divided into six subunits: IIA $(303.01\substack{-385.26\mathrm{~m}})$ ), IIB (388.80–448.2 4 m), IIC $^{\left(452.60-482.33\mathrm{~m}\right)}$ , IID $(491.00{-}519.80\ \mathrm{m})$ , IIE $\left(529.80-\right.$ $548.64\;\mathrm{m})$ , and IIF $(548.64\substack{-598.91\,\mathrm{m}})$ . The uppermost two subunit s define a fining-upward succession of glauconite-sand dominated t o siltstone and clay overlain by clay with nannofossils. Subunits II C and IE are dominated by sandstone with calcite and Subunit IID ha s more fine-grained, organic-rich lithologies, whereas Subunit IIF i s similar to Subunit IIB but has more coarse-grained sediment an d distinctive weak red and reddish gray intervals within the gree n glauconite-bearing sands. Coarse sand– to pebble-size shell fragments are common in Unit II, and coral fragments occasionall y were observed in the upper part of the unit. Glauconite and quart z minerals dominate the siliciclastic grain component. Diagenetic pyrite is common. Unit II most likely represents a gradual change upward from shallow (outer shelf or upper continental slope) t o deepwater (lower slope) depositional environments. The Unit II/II I boundary was not recovered but is marked by an abrupt change i n magnetic susceptibility, NGR, and $P$ -wave velocity. A change in th e apparent dip of strata from near horizontal in Unit II to ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ in Uni t III suggests that the contact is unconformable.  

Unit III $(598.91\;\mathrm{m}$ to the bottom of the hole) is well lithified an d composed of poorly sorted, feldspar-rich sandstone interbedde d with moderately to well-sorted, medium- to fine-grained sandston e and rarely siltstone and poorly sorted conglomerate. The age is unknown because no fossils were recognized. Unit III is divided int o two subunits: IIIA $(598.91\substack{-629.79\mathrm{~m}})$ ) and IIIB $(629.79\substack{-643.56\mathrm{~m}})$ ). Subunit IIIA is composed of coarse-grained heterolithic sandstone, sandstone with calcite clasts, and minor conglomerate and siltstone. Pebble- to cobble-size clasts include felsic intrusive and volcani c rocks, sedimentary rocks, metamorphic rocks, and rare gabbro. Subunit IIIB consists of sandstone and minor sandstone with organic matter. The subunit is finer grained than Subunit IIIA and ha s finely laminated intervals. We speculate that Unit III was formed i n continental to littoral environments with a provenance not far fro m the site.  

# Structural geology  

Unit I shows predominantly horizontal to subhorizontal bedding with local soft-sediment deformation structures such as slum p folds. Unit I is devoid of any structures related to tectonic deformation, apart from some rare normal faults with minor offsets.  

Unit II is characterized by subhorizontal to gently dipping bedding. Steep dips up to $40^{\circ}$ are locally observed in close relation t o parallel lamination and are therefore interpreted as cross-laminae. In contrast to Unit I, deformation structures were observed withi n Unit II, although their occurrence is rather heterogeneously distributed. Planar to irregular millimeter-scale normal faults and joint s were observed in Subunit IIA, typically with offsets ranging fro m 0.1 to $0.5~\mathrm{cm}$ and apparent dips of $10^{\circ}{-}40^{\circ}$ . Striations and slickensides were documented locally where the surfaces of such structure s are exposed. Deformation in the underlying Subunits IIC–IIF is essentially characterized by randomly distributed occurrence of singl e to branched uniform calcite and quartz veins. Recognition of deformational  structures  was  difficult  due  to  drilling  disturbanc e throughout this unit.  

The acoustic basement marks the top of Unit III. This uni t shows a weak tilting of stratified beds expressed in apparent dips o n split core surfaces up to ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ . Again, deformation structures remai n scarce and heterogeneously distributed in Unit III. The recognize d structures consist of veins, fractures, and local microfaults associated with cataclastic fault gouge.  

In conclusion, despite the various tilting of reflectors $(\sim\!5^{\circ})$ an d the vicinity of extensional structures observed on seismic profiles, only weak evidence of bedding tilting and/or deformation structures were observed at this site, possibly due to the nature of th e sediments.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples at Site U1501 were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, diatoms, and foraminifers, with select cor e catchers examined for ostracods. Additional samples were take n from the split working-half sections when necessary to refine th e ages between core catcher samples. Preservation of calcareou s microfossils varies from good in Unit I (Cores 368-U1501A-1H, 368-U1501B-1H, and 368-U1501C-1H through 44X) to poor i n Units II and III (Cores 368-U1501C-45X through 62X and 368- U1501D-2R through 5R). Planktonic foraminifers and calcareou s nannofossils are abundant in Unit I, common to rare in Unit II an d upper Unit III, and barren in the rest of Unit III (Cores 368- U1501D-6R though 27R). Diatoms are few with moderate preservation in Samples 368-U1501A-1H-CC, 368-U1501B-1H-CC, an d 368-U1501C-1H-CC and 2H-CC. The rest of the core catcher samples are barren of diatoms, with the exception of Samples 368- U1501C-3H-CC, 4H-CC, 33F-CC through 35F-CC, and 46X-CC, i n which diatoms are rare with poor preservation. Diatoms are common in burrows found in interval 368-U1501C-35F-1, 118–119 cm, with poor preservation.  

Twenty-eight  biostratigraphic  datums  were  identified  in   a mostly continuous succession from the middle Eocene to Holocen e with indications that Holes U1501C and U1501D penetrated int o strata older than the middle Eocene (Figure F8). The Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary $(\sim\!2.6\,\mathrm{\textbf{Ma}})$ is placed within Core 368- U1501C-7H, the Pliocene/Miocene boundary $({\sim}5.3\ \mathrm{\Ma})$ withi n Core 9H, the Miocene/Oligocene boundary $({\sim}23.0\,\mathrm{\:Ma})$ betwee n Cores 41X and 42X, and the Oligocene/Eocene boundary $(\sim\!33.9$ Ma) deeper than Core 45X. Sedimentation rates varied from ${\sim}11$ $\mathrm{mm/ky}$ in the Miocene to ${\sim}14\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{ky}$ in the Pliocene and $24\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{ky}$ in the Pleistocene. Low sediment accumulation rates $({\sim}3.6~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ during the late Eocene through the early Oligocene and in the lat e Miocene suggest the presence of hiatuses in the sedimentary recor d during these periods. In contrast, higher sediment accumulatio n rates $(35\mathrm{~mm/ky})$ ) existed during the late Oligocene and the earl y Miocene.  

Predominance of shallow-water benthic foraminifer and ostracod assemblages in Cores 368-U1501C-45X through 62X an d 368-U1501D-2R through 6R indicate an upper bathyal to continental shelf paleoenvironment during the Eocene to the early Oligocene. Predominantly abyssal benthic foraminifers and ostracod s shallower than Cores 368-U1501C-44X indicate that deepwate r conditions existed in this part of the SCS since the early Oligocene.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations combined measurement and inline alternating field (AF) demagnetization of archive-half section s on the 2G Enterprises superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM ) with the measurement of discrete samples demagnetized thermall y or with AF.  

The rock magnetic experiments on six representative sample s from Hole U1501C show $S_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{IRM}/_{ Ḋ }\mathrm{X} Ḍ$ ratios between 12.8 and 14. 6 $\mathbf{kA}/\mathbf{m},$ indicating the predominance of greigite in Unit I of Hol e U1501C, documented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) i n $2{-}10\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grains. Thermal demagnetization behaviors also show tha t greigite dominates the natural remanent magnetization (NRM), a t least downhole to $^{83\,{\textrm{m}}}$ . However, the magnetic remanence lef t above $575\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ further suggests contributions from additional phase s such as maghemite (Curie Temperature $\left[\mathrm{TC}\right]=\mathord{\sim}590^{\circ}\mathrm{-}675^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ or hematite $\mathrm{\left<TC=\sim675^{\circ}C\right>}$ ).  

Both AF and thermal treatments on discrete samples successfully removed the steep low-temperature/coercivity componen t that represents the drilling overprint. The mean inclination gathered from the high-temperature component is $37.3^{\circ}\,\pm\,6.6^{\circ}$ , corresponding  to  a  paleolatitude  of $20.8^{\circ}~\pm~3.3^{\circ}$ for  Unit  I  (se e Lithostratigraphy). Many of the AF-demagnetized discrete samples reveal trends showing reversed or normal polarity in the las t step of demagnetization $\left(50\;\mathrm{mT}\right)$ ) and are more difficult to interpret.  

The magnetostratigraphy in Holes U1501C and U1501D i s based on directions derived from the raw moments measured by th e SRM at $25~\mathrm{mT}$ and from the corroborative evidence from discret e samples. Magnetostratigraphy was correlated to the standard timescale and plotted along with the tie points from the microfossil age s from shipboard paleontologists. The paleomagnetic and paleontological age constraints match well over most of the section (Figure F8). A succession of eight normal and five reverse events wa s recognized in Hole U1501D. However, the lack of biostratigraphi c constraints throughout Hole U1501D prevented even a tentativ e correlation of these events with the standard timescale.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water samples were obtained from depths to $450\mathrm{~m~}$ (Subunit IIB). Within Unit I, variations are mainly the result of diagenetic and microbial processes, and measurements of alkalinity, phosphate, ammonia, and sulfate are within the typical ranges fo r the region $(3.5{-}5~\mathrm{mM}$ alkalinity, $250{-}510~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ phosphate, ${<}30~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ ammonia, and ${<}26~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ sulfate). However, more atypically (particularly when compared with Expedition 367 Site U1499), the mai n changes associated with microbial processes are notable only withi n the uppermost $25\,\mathrm{m}$ in Subunit IA and are typical of organic matte r degradation. Deeper than this within Unit I, changes in interstitial water chemistry appear inhibited until $300\mathrm{~m~}$ . These changes ma y be a consequence of the low organic carbon concentration and hig h carbonate content $(\sim\!50\%)$ of Unit I. Decreases in sulfate concentrations with depth are more pronounced in Unit II $\left(>\!300\,\textrm{m}\right)$ , an d within this zone there is heavy pyritization and total sulfur content s are high, suggesting sulfate reduction has taken place. Within th e uppermost part of Unit II $(300{-}370~\mathrm{m})$ , chloride, bromide, and sodium are notably lower (chloride $=500\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}$ , cf. $565\;\mathrm{mM};$ ; bromide $=$ $0.75\;\mathrm{mM}$ , cf. $0.9\,\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{3}}$ ; and sodium $=410\;\mathrm{mM}$ , cf. $480\;\mathrm{mM}$ ). This difference in interstitial water chemical composition is sharp an d could result from pressure-isolated units retaining a distinct formation water chemistry or from the migration of chloride-poor formation water.  

Headspace gas concentrations are below background laborator y levels in all samples collected from Site U1501 $1\%$ ppmv). Total organic carbon (TOC) content is typically $<\!0.5\%$ in Unit I, excep t from 0 to $50\textrm{m}$ (Subunit IA). Within this interval, a typical blac k marine mud has a TOC of ${\sim}1\%$ . TOC was also typically $<\!0.5\%$ i n Units II and III, except for a few carbonaceous lithologies: sandstones with plant phytoclasts associated with an ash-rich boghea d coal in Unit II (interval 368-U1501D-9R-1, $10{-}15~\mathrm{cm})$ ) and a bitumen-impregnated sandstone in Unit III (interval 27R-1, $12{-}16\,\mathrm{cm})$ ). Total sulfur content is low in Unit I: ${\sim}1\%$ in Subunit IA and belo w effective shipboard detection limits of $0.01\%$ for the rest of Unit I. Total sulfur content is higher in Unit II; the muddier uppermos t part of Unit II has values ${>}1\%$ , whereas the sandier deeper part averages ${\sim}0.5\%$ .  

Elemental compositions primarily reflect geological units an d changes in lithology. Within Unit I, carbonate contents are high an d exceed $50\%$ within foraminifer-rich intervals (compositionally  a limestone). Within Units II and III, carbonate is less common, an d the units are predominantly siliciclastic with a distinction betwee n units that are mud rich and feldspathic and sandier units toward th e base of the hole. Calcium, along with strontium, is associated wit h biogenic sediments in Unit I, but in deeper units they covary wit h aluminum. Within the base of Units II and III, sodium and potassium are both high, which is consistent with the dominant presenc e of feldspathic sediments. The higher aluminum proportion withi n the uppermost part of Unit II is consistent with the muddier, clayrich lithologies present here.  

# Physical properties  

Hole U150A is divided into four units based on the sedimen t and rock physical properties. Physical properties (PP) Unit 1 (0–30 0 m) experienced the most evident changes in sediment compaction, which is expressed by increasing bulk density (from 1.4 to 2. 0 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ and $P$ -wave velocities (from 1450 to $1930\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ ) and decreasing porosity (from $85\%$ to $45\%$ ) with depth. Because PP Unit 1 consists mostly of calcareous ooze, it has relatively low NGR (betwee n 20 and 40 counts/s) and magnetic susceptibility (between $10^{-6}$ an d $10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ ). The onset of PP Unit 2 $(300{-}450\ \mathrm{m})$ is marked by a rapi d increase in NGR and porosity values and a rapid decrease in bul k densities and $P$ -wave velocities, corresponding to a shift to a different lithologic unit with sand, silt, and clay-enriched sediments. Within the entire unit, NGR is persistently high (60–80 counts/s), whereas magnetic susceptibility values remain as low as $10\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI. $P$ -wave velocities and bulk densities continue to increase wit h core depth. Most physical properties of PP Unit 3 $^{\left(450-600\;\mathrm{m}\right)}$ hav e similar values as those of Unit 2, except that $P$ -wave velocities ar e extremely high, up to $4000{-}6000~\mathrm{m/s}$ at some interbeds, and bul k densities and porosities increase and decrease to $2.6\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $2\%-$ $3\%$ , respectively, at parallel depths. PP Unit 4 $(600{-}657\ \mathrm{m})$ is distinct from other units due to higher mean values of NGR (8 0 counts/s), bulk density $(2.6~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ , magnetic susceptibility $(500~\times$ $10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI})$ ), and $P$ -wave velocity $(4500~\mathrm{m/s})$ ). Throughout the hole $\left(0-\right.$ $657\ \mathrm{m})$ , thermal conductivities increase from 0.7 to $3.4~\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ , most likely as a result of increasing sediment compaction an d changes in sediment compositions. $L^{\ast}$ reflectance values are highl y relevant to percent carbonate in sediments, which exhibit relativel y high $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ values between 100 and 160 in the upper $300\,\mathrm{m}$ and thereafter remain as low as 90.  

# Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging was conducted in Hole U1501D using a modified triple combo tool string that included the Hostile Environmen t Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS), Hostile Environment LithoDensity Sonde (HLDS), High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA), and magnetic susceptibility sonde (MSS). The triple combo run collected good data between $115.1\;\mathrm{m}$ (base of the drill pipe) to $300\;\mathrm{m}$ , where it encountered an impenetrable obstruction. Four loggin g units are defined: logging Unit 1 (base of the drill pipe to $190\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline depth below seafloor [WSF]) is characterized by interval s of large hole diameter and relatively high variability in NGR an d magnetic susceptibility. Logging Unit 2 $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{190-260}}\,{\mathrm{m}}\,{\mathrm{WSF}}$ ) is characterized by a relatively constant hole diameter, relatively homogeneous logs, and submeter-scale layering. Logging Unit 3 (260–27 5 m WSF) again shows a relatively large hole diameter, as well hig h variability in NGR, density, and resistivity logs. Logging Unit  4 $(275{-}300\mathrm{~m~WSF})$ ) exhibits relatively large values of resistivity an d magnetic susceptibility. The upward log pass indicated a collapse d hole at ${\sim}156.3\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) on the calipe r curve, and for safety reasons no further attempts to descend deepe r than that undergauge spot were made. Because the interval of th e collapsed hole was located only ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ below the base of the pipe, the originally planned FMS-sonic tool string was not run. Four i n situ formation temperature measurements were made in Hol e U1501C, yielding a geothermal gradient of $81.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ and a calculated heat flow of $100.1\:\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . These values are comparable to th e relatively high values observed at some ODP and IODP sites in thi s part of the SCS.

Site U1502 (proposed Site SCSII-17A) within the SCS norther n margin (Figures F2, F9) is located at 3764 mbsl on a prominen t basement ridge (A) within the COT (Figure F3). Ridge A is one o f four distinct basement highs found across the COT. The OMH i s the most landward of these highs and is followed seaward by th e nearly parallel Ridges A, B, and C. A key objective of Expedition s 367 and 368 is to examine the nature of the crust within Ridge A. This ridge is considered to be a pivotal element in the transitio n from continental to oceanic crust. Hence, the main objective of Sit e U1502 was to drill through synrift deposits overlying an interprete d shallow-dipping $({\sim}20^{\circ})$ fault zone and into the crystalline basemen t below the fault. Information on the nature and age of the synrift deposits overlying the fault, as well as the nature and age of the overlying sediments and associated seismic unconformities, forme d another target with the objective of constraining basin subsidence.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1502. Hol e U1502A is located at $18^{\circ}27.8720^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $116^{\circ}13.8381^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , at $3763~\mathrm{mbsl}$ . Our operations in Hole U1502A were designed to provide information on formation characteristics and drilling conditions so that w e could decide the length of casing to drill into the seafloor in deeppenetration Hole U1502B. Given this purpose and the amount o f time to drill the second, deep hole, we did not core continuously i n Hole U1502A. Instead, we drilled without coring from the seafloo r to $375.0\ \mathrm{m}$ and cored with the RCB system from 375.0 to $758.2\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , recovering $176.81\:\mathrm{m}\left(46\%\right)$ . Hole U1502B is located at $18^{\circ}27.8798^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $116^{\circ}13.8409^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , at 3763.6 mbsl. In Hole U1502B, we drilled a reentr y funnel and $727.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing into the seafloor; cored wit h the RCB system through the sediment–basalt transition (727.7– $739.16\;\mathrm{m})$ and $180\;\mathrm{m}$ into the underlying basalt $739.16{-}920.95\ \mathrm{m})$ , recovering $128\mathrm{~m~}(70\%);$ ; and collected downhole log data with th e triple combo tool string and a check shot with the VSI tool string.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1502 extend s from the late Eocene to the late Miocene. The succession include s four sedimentary units (I and III–V) that are composed of mainl y clay, nannofossil-rich clay, biosiliceous-rich clay, limestone, an d clast-rich clay and two igneous units (II and VI) that are mainl y composed of basalt. The base of the sedimentary succession is a sequence of clay and metasediments (dolomite marble and dolomiti c limestone) possibly forming the contact with a unit of altered basal t (Unit VI) (Figure F10).  

Late Miocene to late Oligocene lithostratigraphic Unit I is divided into five subunits. Subunit IA (Hole U1502A: 375.00−486.8 2 m) is composed of dark gray, gray, dark greenish gray, and greenis h gray silty clay, clay with nannofossils, and nannofossil-rich clay intercalated with dark grayish brown, grayish brown, and brown cla y with nannofossils, with minor dark greenish gray sandy clay wit h calcite. Subunit IB (Hole U1502A: 490.20–599.57 m) is composed o f alternating intervals of brown and greenish gray clay, silty clay, an d clayey silt. Sandy intervals are rare. Recovery in Subunits IA and I B was very poor, which might be due to the occurrence of thick san d beds that were washed out. Subunit IC (Hole U1502A: 599.57– $602.39\ \mathrm{m})$ ) is composed of greenish gray and reddish gray foraminifer-rich clayey siltstone to sandstone with parallel lamination an d convolute bedding, with thin layers of pinkish gray foraminifera l chalk. Subunit ID (Hole U1502A: 602.39–724.03 m) is mainly composed of alternating greenish and brownish gray and grayish brow n clay, silty clay, clayey silt, and clay with silt (Cores 368-U1502A-25 R through 32R), but brown colors dominate from Core 33R throug h 38R. Nannofossils are abundant within the lowermost ${\sim}4~\mathrm{m}$ of thi s subunit. Subunit IE (Hole U1502A: 724.03–734.87 m; Hole U1502B: $727.79\mathrm{-}727.96\:\mathrm{m})$ is composed of brown nannofossil-rich clay wit h foraminifers and nannofossil-rich clay with pale green colors as haloes around fractures. The sediments of Unit I are interpreted a s having been deposited in a deep-marine environment. Fining-upward intervals in Subunits IA–IC are interpreted as turbidites.  

Unit II is a highly altered greenish gray basalt clast recovere d from Hole U1502B at $727.96{-}728.04\;\mathrm{~m~}$ . The primary minera l phases are replaced by an alteration-mineral assemblage.  

Unit  III  (Hole  U1502A: $739.10{-}739.16\ \mathrm{~m};$ ;  Hole  U1502B: $728.04{-}733.82\,\mathrm{~m})$ is composed of a brownish yellow, very hard, poorly sorted breccia. The granule- to pebble-size siliceous clast s consist of alteration minerals (Fe hydroxides) cemented by a matri x of annealed quartz in various grain sizes.  

Unit IV consists of biosiliceous-rich silty clay. Diatoms, spong e spicules, and radiolarians are abundant in the upper part, but th e abundance of both nannofossils and diatoms decreases rapidl y downhole from Section 368-U1502A-40R-1 to 40R-3. Pyrite occur s as centimeter-size patches and along cracks. The layering in Unit I V is inclined and may be slightly deformed.  

Unit V (Hole U1502A: 747.20–749.01 m; Hole U1502B: 733.82– $739.16\,\mathrm{~m~}$ is an interval of alternating metasediments (dolomit e marble, dolomitic limestone, and clast-rich clay). The dolomit e marble is dominated by very fine grained dolomite $(\sim\!95\%)$ with minor amounts of magnetite $(\sim\!3\%)$ and calcite $(\sim\!2\%)$ . The annealin g texture is equigranular and crossed by fine-grained dark gray bands. The presence of magnetite explains the extraordinarily high magnetic susceptibility of this unit. The gray, fine-grained dolomiti c limestone in Hole U1502B is intercalated with well-consolidated, very dark greenish gray clay with $10\%{-15\%}$ igneous clasts. The sediment is partially overprinted with alteration caused by secondar y high-temperature processes (e.g., hydrothermal fluid sediment interaction or contact metamorphism).  

Unit  VI  (Hole  U1502A: $749.01{-}750.67\ \ \mathrm{m};$ Hole  U1502B: $739.16{-}920.95\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{a}}^{\mathrm{i}}$ ) consists of highly altered basaltic breccia, brecciated basalt, pillow basalt, and sheet basalt. The unit is divided int o two subunits. Subunit VIA is composed of highly altered basalti c breccia and brecciated basalt with minor sheet basalt, chert, an d claystone and very minor pillow basalt. Subunit VIB is dominate d by pillow basalt and sheet flows and is less brecciated than Subuni t VIA.  

# Igneous petrology  

At Site U1502, we recovered two igneous lithologic units. Unit  1 (lithostratigraphic Unit II) is represented by just three small, aphanitic, fine-grained basalt fragments that contain rare plagioclas e phenocrysts (Figure F11). Alteration of Unit 1 is intense, with mos t of the groundmass replaced by green clay minerals, clinozoisite, zeolites, and Fe (hydr)oxides.  

Unit 2 (lithostratigraphic Unit VI) comprises a $182~\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of highly altered aphyric to highly plagioclase porphyriti c basalts, with minor chert (Figure F11). These basalts are divide d into two igneous subunits (2a and 2b) based on flow morpholog y and alteration style: an upper brecciated and fractured massive lav a flow sequence (Subunit 2a) and a lower sequence of interbedde d pillow flows with lobate and sheet lava flows in which the alteratio n style is characterized by intense veining (Subunit 2b). Subunit 2a i s characterized by highly altered breccia clasts of sparsely to moderately phyric basalt in a matrix of carbonates, epidote, chlorite, F e (hydr)oxides, quartz, zeolite minerals, and clay minerals. The clast s show an alteration assemblage similar to the matrix, with remnan t plagioclase and secondary pyrite. Subunit 2b consists of aphyric t o highly plagioclase phyric $(>\!30\%)$ basalts with abundant chlorite an d sulfides, as well as epidote, clay minerals, carbonates, zeolites, an d opaque minerals.  

All of Unit 2 has undergone some degree of hydrothermal alteration. This alteration varies from complete replacement of the rock, where the original composition and texture are difficult to determine, to replacement of mineral phases with little change to the texture. Glassy pillow rinds are completely replaced, and multipl e phases of veining and haloes are ubiquitous throughout the rocks. Three vein types were observed: (1) white to green to black silicaepidote veins (2) apple green pyrite-epidote veins, and (3) white silica and/or calcite veins. Sulfide mineralization (disseminated an d veined) is widespread throughout Unit 2 and is dominated by pyrite, with minor sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and covellite.  

Handheld X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyses show no significant differences in contents of alteration-resistant elements such a s $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and $Z\mathbf{r}$ within Unit 2, but Subunit 2a has lower $\mathrm{MgO}_{:}$ , FeO, an d MnO than Subunit 2b, which is consistent with the higher degree o f alteration. Subunit 2b is also strongly affected by secondary alteration, but areas of less intense alteration are indicated by highe r magnetic susceptibility and high $C\mathsf{a O}$ and $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ values. Unit 1 appears to be compositionally distinct from Unit 2, and has, for example, higher $\mathrm{Ti/Zr}$ ratios.  

# Structural geology  

Deformation structures are scarce in Unit I above Core 368- U1502A-37R, with only a local, convolutely bedded sequence i n Core 25R. Downhole from Core 37R at ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ , a gradual increas e in deformation structures was observed (Figure F11). Cores 37 R through 39R are characterized by microfaults, as evidenced b y downward-dip plunging striations and slickensides on expose d fracture surfaces, systematically associated with greenish halos. N o deformation structures were encountered in Unit II. Unit III consists of an extremely silicified breccia that was poorly recovered. The nature of this breccia, however, as sedimentary, tectonic, or hydrothermal remains unconstrained at the moment. In Unit IV,  a small-scale transition from distributed to localized shear in unlithified sediments was documented. No deformation structures wer e encountered in Unit V. Unit VI is essentially composed of basalt s that were heterogeneously affected by brecciation and veining associated with the circulation of hydrothermal fluids. Subunit VIA i s dominated by brecciated basalt/basaltic breccias, whereas Subuni t VIB comprises a rather coherent series of lava flows crosscut by  a multistage network of polymineralic veins.  

The uppermost part of Unit VI contains severely fractured an d fragmented basalt locally filled by fine-grained unconsolidate d greenish rock. Subunit VIA is characterized by diverse brecciatio n horizons associated with veins and microcracks. Depending on th e intensity of fragmentation and the clast/matrix ratio, the rocks ar e referred to as brecciated basalt or basaltic breccia. A typically observed feature is the jigsaw-puzzle structure, suggesting possible i n situ fragmentation. Macro- and microscopic observations show tha t the breccia-clasts consist mainly of sparsely to moderately plagioclase phyric basalts that were hydrothermally altered to variable degrees. Thus, formation of such breccias likely involved fluid-assiste d fracturing of basalt. In contrast, Subunit VIB is characterized by  a progressive decrease of breccia horizons and the development o f different vein types, almost always polymineralic. Notably, vei n composition and their orientation changes through Subunit VIB. Although numerous small-scale veins often related with major vein s were observed, three first-order vein types were categorized: (1 ) composite silica-rich veins, (2) composite epidote-rich veins, an d (3) composite carbonate- and/or silica-rich veins.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples from Hole U1502A and selected samples from Hole U1502B were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, diatoms, and ostracods. Additional samples wer e taken from intervals within the working-half cores when necessar y to refine the ages. The preservation of calcareous microfossils i s mostly good to moderate in the upper sections (Cores 368-U1502A2R through 13R) and moderate to poor in the lower sections (Core s 14R through 41R). Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils are abundant to common in Cores 2R through 10R, 25R, an d 37R through 39R and rare to barren in all other sections. Diatom s were only observed in Sections 368-U1502A-40R-1 through 40R-3. In Hole U1502B, foraminifers were observed only in Section 368- U1502B-3R-1 and are represented by well-preserved, agglutinate d deepwater taxa. Ostracods are extremely rare, and single occurrences were observed only in three samples in Hole U1502A (Samples 3R-CC, 4R-CC, and 5R-CC).  

Fourteen planktonic foraminifer and calcareous nannofossi l biostratigraphic events were used to provide an age-depth mode l for Site U1502 from the late Miocene to late Oligocene. The Pliocene/Miocene boundary is placed tentatively within Core 368- U1502A-2R, but it may be shallower than the cored section. Th e Miocene/Oligocene boundary was determined to lie between Samples 368-U1502A-39R-CC and 40R-1, $7~\mathrm{cm}$ . Sedimentation rate s vary from ${\sim}39\mathrm{\mm/ky}$ in the late Miocene to ${\sim}10\mathrm{\mm/ky}$ in th e middle and early Miocene. No planktonic microfossils were foun d in Hole U1502B, but a sample from a sandy interval in Core 368- U1502B-3R revealed abundant and diverse abyssal agglutinate d benthic foraminifers. The composition of this agglutinated benthi c foraminifer assemblage provides a possible age of late Eocene fo r this interval.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The magnetic behavior of sediments at Site U1502 correlate s with their color (greenish gray or reddish brown). Reddish brow n sediments show AF magnetization indicative of magnetite o r titanomagnetite and hematite (responsible for the color). In contrast, greenish gray sediments host magnetite or titanomagnetit e and pyrrhotite. The predominance of steep normal inclination s $\left(\sim\right)5^{\circ}.$ ; Figure F12) across all late Oligocene to late Miocene unit s $(375.00{-}750.67\;\mathrm{m})$ affects the SRM section measurements and prevents any reliable magnetostratigraphy to be established for bot h Holes U1502A and U1502B.  

The basalt has NRM intensities one order of magnitude highe r than sediment. The main magnetically remanent phase is titanomagnetite, but its alteration produces maghemite or hematite. Magnetic susceptibility (κ) shows a bimodal distribution with a media n at $327\,\times\,10^{-6}$ SI. κ does not show any strong correlation with an y chemical ( $\overset{\,/}R^{2}=0.343$ for $\mathrm{Fe^{2}O^{3}\,w t\%}$ . Intervals of high κ values migh t correspond to the bottoms of flows with a massive, less altere d structure. Altered basalts have higher Koenisberger ratios $^{\leftmoon}(Q=1-$ 10) than fresher basalts $\!\!\phantom{+}Q=0.001\!\!-\!\!1\!\!,$ ). The mean dip of magneti c foliation is $8^{\circ}$ . Cores 368-U1502B-9R and 10R show less-pervasiv e drilling overprint and two discrete samples show both a normal (soft) component and a reverse (hard) component, suggesting  a possible reversal.  

# Geochemistry  

Site U1502 contains very low high-hydrocarbon gas abundance s and TOC, nitrogen, and sulfur contents, likely reflecting the poo r preservation of organic matter. Instances of high carbonate conten t are associated with siderite, and on occasion this mineral comprise s ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ by mass of intervals of lithostratigraphic Subunit ID. The interstitial water at Site U1502 is enriched in Ca, Mg, and K; has notably high alkalinity; but is depleted in Na, Cl, and Br. The linea r decrease and increase of major anion and cation contents implie s upward movement of fluid from deeper sediments. The hemipelagic sediments within Unit I have some similarities to the geochemical characteristics of the hemipelagic and pelagic units a t Sites U1501 and U1505, but Site U1502 sediments are enriched i n Fe, K, and clay concentrations, likely as a result of regions of increased alteration. All of the analyzed igneous rocks from Units II– VI were heavily altered, although samples from igneous lithologi c Subunit 2b were altered to a lesser degree than those from Subuni t 2a.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property data acquired at Site U1502 include density , magnetic susceptibility, $P$ -wave velocity, NGR, color reflectance, and thermal conductivity (Figure F13). These data allow us to characterize four physical property units. PP Unit 1 $(375{-}740\;\mathrm{m})$ corresponds to the nannofossil-rich and biosiliceous-rich clay lithologie s and exhibits small variations in NGR between 50 and 70 counts/ s and uniformly increasing $P$ -wave velocities with depth that are o n average ${<}2500~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Unit 1 sediments show similar porosities t o those recorded at nearby Sites U1499 and U1500 in the same dept h interval, suggesting the same compaction history. A significant increase in bulk density (up to $2.7\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) in Core 368-U1502B-3R i s associated with strongly lithified limestone beds. Variations of hig h and low magnetic susceptibility values correspond to sedimen t color changes in Unit 1 and may be controlled by the amount of pyrrhotite within the sediments.  

PP Unit 2 $(740{-}750\,\mathrm{~m~})$ in Hole U1502A is characterized b y lower $P$ -wave velocities and bulk densities and higher NGR than th e strata above. Low densities and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities found in Unit  2 reflect the clast-rich claystone from lithostratigraphic Unit V.  

PP Units 3 and 4 represent the basaltic basement and are characterized by relatively low NGR values $_{<10}$ counts/s), high densities, and $P$ -wave velocities that vary over a broad range (3000–600 0 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ . The boundary between Units 3 and 4 is marked by an abrup t increase in density, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, and thermal conductivity an d coincides with the change from igneous lithologic Subunit 2a to 2b. Prominent magnetic susceptibility peaks (up to $4000\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}_{\rightmoon}$ ) i n Units 3 and 4 correspond to relatively less altered basalt. Thermal conductivity in Units 3 and 4 is variable but generally increases i n line with decreasing porosity with depth.  

# Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging was conducted in Hole U1502B using a modified triple combo tool string and the VSI tool string. The modifie d triple combo tool string included the HNGS, HLDS, and Dipol e Sonic Imager (DSI) for acoustic velocity. The triple combo run collected good data downhole from $875.3\;\mathrm{m}$ ( ${\sim}45~\mathrm{m}$ above the botto m of Hole U1502B) and allowed us to define eight logging units, whic h correlate in great part to the lithostratigraphic units and core physical properties. Logging Units 1–5 are defined by data collecte d through the casing and drill pipe. Unit 6 data was collected outsid e the casing but inside the drill pipe, whereas data in Units 7 and  8 were collected in the open hole. For measurements inside the casin g and/or drill pipe, only NGR and the associated K, Th, and U components provide meaningful data, although they are highly attenuate d by the casing and/or drill pipe. Open-borehole conditions from th e bottom of the casing at $723\;\mathrm{m}$ to $875.3\;\mathrm{m}$ were generally good, wit h measured diameters from 12 to 14.5 inches. Log and core data generally show good agreement, and downhole measurements provid e information in zones of poor core recovery in Hole U1502B. The lo g data exhibit increasing densities and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities with depth. The amplitude of NGR increases gradually with depth throughou t Units 1–3 (seafloor to ${\sim}630\ \mathrm{m})$ ), with an interval of relatively constant values between 150 and $350\,\mathrm{m}$ . NGR values are lowest in Unit s 4–8 $^{\prime}{\sim}630{-}850\;\mathrm{m})$ .  

The VSI tool string was run only inside casing because the too l could not pass through an obstruction encountered at the end of th e casing. Eight stations were attempted. The two deepest stations (a t 715.1 and $695.2\ \mathrm{m})$ ) are associated with large noise levels possibl y caused by poor mechanical coupling of the casing with the surrounding formation. The remaining upper six stations, located a t 290.2, 350.3, 450.3, 550.1, 590.3, and $630.3\;\mathrm{m}$ , recorded good qualit y waveforms.  

# Site U1503  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1503 (proposed Site SCSII-9B) is located at $3868~\mathrm{mbsl}$ near the top of the structural high named Ridge C (Figures F2, F14). Ridge $C$ is the most seaward ridge of the three margin-paralle l Ridges A, B, and C that characterize the lower continental slope underlain by thin $(5-7\ \mathrm{km})$ crust. Ridge C is believed to represent a t least partly, if not full, igneous crust and hence the completion o f continental breakup along this margin segment of the norther n SCS.  

A key operational objective of Site U1503 was to sample the lowermost ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediments on top of basement to constrain th e age and subsidence history of the crust at this location, the timing o f normal faulting, and the environment of the early half-graben fill.  A second and most important goal was to sample the igneous stratigraphy to at least $100\;\mathrm{m}$ below the basement. Because of a rig floo r equipment failure (drawworks), we abandoned the site after installing casing in Hole U1503A to $991.5\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Deep, representative sampling of the basaltic material at this sit e would have provided an important reference frame for the modeling of breakup. With an estimated sediment thickness of $1640\,\mathrm{~m~}$ overlying basement, obtaining basement samples and log data a t this site represented a challenging operation.  

# Operations  

To reach our objectives, we conducted operations in one hol e (U1503A; $18^{\circ}08.6300^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $116^{\circ}18.8456^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 3868 mbsl). We successfull y installed a reentry system and $991.5\mathrm{~m~}$ of $10\%$ inch casing in Hol e  

U1503A. However, we were unable to deepen the hole below th e casing because of repeated breakdowns of the low clutch diaphrag m in the drawworks and concerns that we did not have enough spare s to last the remainder of the expedition. Without the drawworks lo w clutch, we could not conduct drilling operations deeper than 340 0 m (water depth plus penetration depth). Because Site U1503 had  a planned depth of $5695\mathrm{~m~}$ (water depth plus penetration depth), w e abandoned Hole U1503A without addressing any scientific objectives. Hole U1503A remains cased and open for possible future occupation.  

# Site U1504  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1504 (alternate Site SCSII-27A) was proposed during Expedition 367 and approved by the Environmental Protection an d Safety Panel during Expedition 368 as an alternate site should ther e be time left following completion of the high-priority sites include d in the Scientific Prospectus. Expedition 368 decided to occupy Sit e U1504 following the inability to continue drilling below the $990~\mathrm{m}$ deep cased Hole U1503A. Most of our remaining approved site s were in water deeper than $3400\mathrm{~m~}$ and/or required deep penetration. One exception was Site U1504, located at $2823~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , ${\sim}45~\mathrm{km}$ east of Site U1501 on the OMH, and with a shallow coring targe t (Figures F2, F15).  

# Operations  

Two  holes  were  drilled  at  Site  U1504.  In  Hole  U1504 A $18^{\circ}50.9199^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , 116°14.5397ʹE; 2816.6 mbsl), we cored with the RC B system from the seafloor to metamorphic basement at $134.8\;\mathrm{m}$ an d then into basement to $165.5\ \mathrm{m},$ , recovering $52.77\textrm{m}$ $(32\%)$ . In Hol e U1504B ${\bf\omega}_{\sim200\mathrm{~\,~m~}}$ southeast  of  Hole  U1504A; $18^{\circ}50.8213^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $116^{\circ}14.5978^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 2843.0 mbsl), we drilled without recovery to $88.2~\mathrm{m}$ , cored with the RCB system to metamorphic basement at $107.9\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and then cored into basement to $200\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , recovering $21.48\;\mathrm{m}$ $(19\%)$ .  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The succession recovered at Site U1504 includes two sedimentary units (I and II) underlain by a metamorphic unit (III). Lithostratigraphic Unit I is dominated by nannofossil and foraminiferal ooze and minor nannofossil-rich clay and is divided into four subunits (IA–ID). Subunit IA (Hole U1504A: $17.50{-}46.59\ \mathrm{m})$ ) is composed of nannofossil-rich clay, nannofossil ooze, nannofossil ooz e with biogenic silica, and clay-rich nannofossil ooze. The color of th e ooze gradually changes downhole from dark greenish gray to greenish gray and gray. Distinct intervals contain more silt. Thin silt laminations are often disrupted by bioturbation. Layering is contorte d at the base of the subunit. Subunit IB (Hole U1504A: 46.59–59.7 3 m) is composed of light brown foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooz e and pale brown nannofossil ooze with foraminifers. Subunit I C (Hole U1504A: 65.80–104.99 m) is composed of light greenish gray, greenish gray, light brownish gray, pale brown, and light gra y nannofossil ooze with clay and greenish gray clay-rich nannofossil ooze, intercalated with light gray nannofossil-rich foraminiferal ooze with clay, light brownish gray foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze, and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze with clay. Subunit I D (Hole U1504A: 104.99–112.66 m; Hole U1504B: 88.20–92.31 m) i s composed of light brown to yellowish brown nannofossil ooze wit h foraminifers, intercalated with pink or brownish yellow foraminiferrich nannofossil ooze.  

Unit II (Hole U1504A: 114.72–134.80 m; Hole U1504B: 97.90– $107.91\,\mathrm{~m~})$ ) is clast supported, bioclast-rich limestone with large r benthic foraminifers (up to $15~\mathrm{mm}$ ). The contact between Units  I and II was not recovered.  

Unit  III  (Hole  U1504A:  136.40–163.70  m;  Hole  U1504B: $117.40{-}196.28\ \mathrm{m})$ ) is composed of fine- to coarse-grained epidotechlorite schist (Subunit IIIA) and calc-silicate schist (Subunit IIIB), with granofels clasts.  

# Metamorphic petrology  

We recovered $27\;\mathrm{m}$ (Hole U1504A) and $79\;\mathrm{m}$ (Hole U1504B) o f a variety of mylonitic epidote-chlorite to calc-silicate schists containing granofels clasts. Recovery was $<\!20\%$ in this unit. Lithologi c changes with depth and between the two holes were observed, an d the unit is divided based on a change in the predominant metamorphic lithology (Figure F16). Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIA was recovered in both Holes U1504A and U1504B and consists of greenis h gray, microcrystalline to coarse-grained epidote-chlorite schist wit h dark greenish gray granofels clasts $\left({<}10\ \mathrm{cm}\right)$ and epidote-chlorit e breccia. The schists show a strong mylonitic foliation, whereas th e clasts have generally isotropic textures showing local weakly developed foliation. Both the schist and the granofels clasts show, in general,  a  comparable  mineral  assemblage  consisting  of  epidote, chlorite, feldspar, and quartz $\pm$ other phyllosilicates and accessor y minerals and locally isolated subhedral dark minerals (pyroxene?). The granofels clasts are often crosscut by a network of quartz veins. Subunit IIIB contains an alternation of calc-silicate schist and epidote-chlorite schist with granofels clasts, epidote and/or chlorit e granofels, chlorite schist with epidote, epidote-chlorite gneiss, an d minor marble. The lithologies are fine- to coarse-grained wit h mostly an inequigranular texture and some bimodal or equigranula r textures, and the schistose sections show a strong mylonitic foliation. Several of the schists show a reddish brown alteration, and lat e calcite veins crosscut the foliation of the deepest schists recovere d (e.g., in Core 368-U1504-20R). Minerals observed are epidote, quartz, chlorite, calcite and feldspar. Metamorphic Subunit III B contains numerous clasts with variable lithologies: cryptocrystallin e granofels either with or without quartz and/or calcite veins, porphyritic rocks with tabular phenocrysts (possibly altered plagioclase), brecciated (epidote, calcite and/or quartz) veins, and foliate d granofels.  

Handheld pXRF analyses show an average mafic igneous composition for both the schist and the clasts but with a spread towar d ultramafic (in Hole U1504B Subunit IIIA) and more felsic compositions (in Subunit IIIB). A clear change in sulfur contents occurs between Subunits IIIA and IIIB, the latter of which is below th e detection limit. High Nb contents compared to mid-ocean-ridg e basalt (MORB) indicate a potentially enriched source for the protolith.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit III consists of mylonitic, greenschist facies metamorphic rocks, indicated by the presence of epidote an d chlorite. We infer that the protolith most likely was a breccia, base d on the different clast sizes and types and styles of deformation. Th e protolith likely had a mafic igneous composition. It is, however, unclear if this breccia with mafic clasts has a sedimentary origin (e.g., volcaniclastic) or represents a potentially hydrothermally altere d form of basalt, gabbro, or ultramafic protolith. At present, the metamorphic evolution of this unit and its connection with the openin g of the SCS is unknown.  

# Structural geology  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I shows subhorizontal bedding and locally some minor possible slump folds, as observed in Section 368-  

U1504A-5R-1. Unit II is devoid of any deformation structures. Th e metamorphic basement at Site U1504 is formed by greenschist facies mylonitic epidote-chlorite schists and calc-silicate schists (Uni t III). The rocks preserve distinct deformation structures resultin g from changes in the mode of deformation (brittle/ductile); th e modal amount of quartz $^+$ feldspar governing the (local) rheological behavior; the amount of accumulated strain; the occurrence of variably sized (up to decimeter scale), prekinematic, heterolithic clast s that mostly form rigid (i.e., internally undeformed) bodies withi n the ductile foliation; and/or superimposed multiple deformatio n phases. The steeply dipping (up to $75^{\circ}$ ) mylonitic foliation is characterized by distinct morphologies: (1) a widely spaced anastomosin g foliation associated with leucocratic bands; (2) a tight, closel y spaced, and often crenulated foliation associated with more melanocratic schist variations; and (3) a tight anastomosing foliation associated with calc-silicate schists enclosing angular to rounde d heterolithic granofels clasts. Locally, the sense of shear is indicate d by shear bands and sigma clasts. In Subunit IIIA (Figure F16), granofels clasts are consistently microcrystalline (chlorite $^+$ epidote ) and dismembered by a network of mostly parallel and perpendicular quartz veins cutting each other. Often they form apparentl y stretched, elongated bodies oriented parallel to the foliation. Subunit IIIB shows a wide range of prekinematic (mostly mafic) clast s enclosed by the foliation. Encountered varieties encompass highl y phyric to aphyric rocks, as well as fragmented former (epidote/calcite/quartz) vein fillings. In some cases, such clasts show ductile internal deformation. Clast boundaries can be either distinctly shar p or diffuse, the latter indicating mechanical and/or chemical interactions with the surrounding foliation. Deformation in Subunit IIIB i s presumably strongly controlled by an inherited (protolithic) brecciated structure.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples at Site U1504 were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, and diatoms. Additional sample s were taken from intervals within the working-half cores when necessary to refine the ages. Preservation of calcareous microfossils i s good to very good in Cores 368-U1504A-2R through 12R and 368- U1504B-2R and is poorly preserved deeper in the section due to recrystallization in the reefal limestone. Diatoms are poorly preserve d in Cores 368-U1504A-2R through 5R, and they are rare or barren i n other core catcher samples. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareou s nannofossils are abundant in Cores 368-U1504A-2R through 12 R and 368-U1504B-2R and barren in Cores 368-U1504A-13R throug h 15R. Twenty biostratigraphic datums were identified in a successio n from the late Pleistocene to the early Miocene.  

A hiatus between the early Pleistocene and late Miocene was determined within Core 368-U1504A-6R, with abrupt planktonic foraminiferal and nannofossil assemblage changes. Sedimentatio n rates at this site varied from ${\sim}22~\mathrm{mm/ky}$ during the Pleistocene t o ${\sim}6\mathrm{\mm/ky}$ in the early middle Miocene.  

Cores 368-U1504A-13R through 15R are mainly composed o f reefal limestone with abundant larger benthic foraminifers occurring in Cores 14R and 15R. Thin section examination of these carbonate rocks indicates the presence of abundant Nummulites, suggesting an Eocene age. The abundant larger benthic foraminifer s indicate deposition in a warm shallow-marine environment. In contrast, the abundant planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils in the carbonate ooze in the overlying sedimentary sectio n (Cores 2R through 12R) indicate a deepwater environment since th e early Miocene.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Most of the 14 discrete sedimentary samples show an initial sof t magnetic behavior attributed to titanomagnetite followed by a gyroremanent magnetization greater than $70\,\mathrm{mT}$ attributed to greigite,  a mineral already identified at Site U1501. Consistently steep norma l inclinations $(\sim\!60^{\circ})$ across all sedimentary units indicate a significan t drilling overprint that is removed by AF demagnetization up to 1 5 mT. A succession of nine normal and eight reversal polarities can b e defined, particularly in the upper part of the cores (Figure F17).  

Discrete samples show low κ values, a moderate degree of magnetic anisotropy, and a strongly oblate symmetry, probably of depositional origin. This subhorizontal planar fabric indicates depositio n in a calm, pelagic environment with moderate traction.  

NRM intensities of metamorphic rocks, measured on the SR M and on four discrete cubes, are relatively weak and indicate a complex magnetic assemblage composed of magnetite and hematite i n one specimen. The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility fabric s consistently dip steeply and show a moderate to high degree of magnetic anisotropy, oblate symmetries, and oblique magnetic lineations, possibly indicating an oblique motion within this high-strai n shear zone.  

# Geochemistry  

Hydrocarbon gases were not detected above background level s at Site U1504, and TOC, nitrogen, and sulfur contents were lo w $(<\!0.5\%)$ . Instances of high carbonate content were associated wit h bioclast-rich and clast-supported limestone. The upper part of th e sediment was not cored; therefore, present-day early diagenetic processes were not constrained. Interstitial water data are broadly comparable to other sites.  

# Physical properties  

Four petrophysical units are identified at Site U1504 accordin g to variations in the core physical properties. Core material in P P Units 1 and 2 consists of soft sediments. In general, with respect t o Unit 2, Unit 1 has a higher average NGR count $\left.\sim\!30\right.$ versus 2 0 counts/s), a weaker color reflectance (mean $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ of ${\sim}40$ versus 50), and a lower average RGB value (100 versus 150). These changes i n physical properties between Units 1 and 2 correspond to a switch o f sediment compositions from nannofossil-rich clay to nannofossi l ooze. A general increase in bulk (from ${\sim}1.4$ to $1.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and dr y (from ${\sim}0.7$ to $1.2\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ densities and a downhole decrease in porosities (from $75\%$ to $56\%$ ) in Units 1 and 2 mainly indicate sedimen t compaction with time. The boundary between Units 1 and 2 i s marked by a relatively rapid increase in $P$ -wave velocity and bul k density and a rapid decrease in porosity compared with the genera l trends mentioned above. This physical property boundary corresponds to an unconformity in the seismic profile and also to a hiatu s confirmed by the biostratigraphic data.  

$P$ -wave velocities and bulk densities increase from $\mathord{\sim}3800$ t o $5000~\mathrm{m/s}$ and from ${\sim}2.4$ to $2.9\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively, within Unit 3, which corresponds to a transition in lithology from coral-rich limestone to clast-supported limestone. Coral-rich limestone in the upper portion of Unit 3 is also associated with a moderately hig h porosity of $\sim\!23\%$ . Unit 4 is characterized by uniformly high velocities of ${\sim}5500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , high bulk densities of ${\sim}2.9\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and low porosities of ${\sim}3\%$ , which correspond to the epidote-chlorite schist.  A large increase in both velocities and densities at the boundaries between Units 2 and 3 and also Units 3 and 4, corresponds to stron g reflectors in the seismic data. The gradual downhole increase i n thermal conductivity values at shallow depths is likely due to progressive compaction of the sediments.  

# Site U1505  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1505 (proposed Site SCSII-3D) is located at 2916.6 mbs l on a broad regional basement high (Figure F18). This site was a n alternate to Site U1501, should time be left for drilling followin g completion of the high-priority sites included in the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2017). Site U1505 was included in Expedition 36 8 because it might complement findings at Site U1501 and it wa s within the operational limits of $3400~\mathrm{m}$ drill string imposed by th e failure of the drawworks (see Operations for details).  

Both Sites U1505 and U1501 are located on the same structura l high at similar water depths and are $10.5\,\mathrm{km}$ apart (Figure F2). Th e seismic section at Site U1505 generally shows a more horizontal orientation of the seismic reflectors and concordant relationship of th e strata than at Site U1501, indicating the sediment sequence her e should be more complete. The key objective at Site U1505 was t o sample the stratigraphic record above seismic unconformity T8 0 (inferred to be ${\sim}38\mathrm{\Ma}_{.}$ ), with specific goals to constrain both th e sediment responses to the tectonic events and basin evolution sinc e the Eocene and Neogene paleoceanographic and paleoclimatological changes along the northern SCS margin.  

The relatively shallow water depth of $2916.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ at Site U150 5 makes it one of the few ODP/IODP sites above the modern CCD o f the SCS. Its hemipelagic deposits, rich in calcareous microfossils, enable the application of stable isotopes, faunal analyses, and othe r multidisciplinary methods. Key objectives were to reconstruct th e east Asian monsoonal climate record in the SCS and upper- an d deep-water variations in the western Pacific. Site U1505 will, for th e first time, provide an almost continuous sequence of paleoceanographic studies at orbital and millennial timescales since the late Eocene in the SCS. We cored two holes at this site with the AP C system to obtain a continuous record for the Pliocene–Pleistocen e interval for high-resolution paleoceanographic studies.  

# Operations  

Four holes were cored with the APC/XCB systems at Sit e U1505. In Hole U1505A $\mathrm{[18^{\circ}55.0560^{\prime}N}$ , $115^{\circ}51.5369^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ;  2916. 6 mbsl), Core 1H misfired and recovered only $0.3\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1505 B $\mathrm{[}18^{\circ}55.0562^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $115^{\circ}51.5370^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $2918.6~\mathrm{mbsl}_{.}$ ), a $3.23~\mathrm{m}$ long mudlin e core was recovered for future education and outreach activities. Hole U1505C $18^{\circ}55.0570^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}51.5370^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 2917.4 mbsl) was AP C cored to $317~\mathrm{m}$ and then XCB cored to $480.2\;\mathrm{m}$ , recovering 480.1 5 $\mathrm{m}\left(100\%\right)$ . Hole U1505D $18^{\circ}55.0485^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}51.5501^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 2917.5 mbsl ) was APC cored to $184.5~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $191.43\;\mathrm{m}$ $(104\%)$ . Downhole logging with a modified triple combo tool string was conducted in Hole U1505C from $341.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ uphole. The maximu m drilling depth of $480.2\:\mathrm{m}$ was determined by the possible maximu m total length $(3400\;\mathrm{m})$ of drill string deployment.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sediment succession recovered at Site U1505 extends fro m the late Eocene to the Pleistocene. Two sedimentary units (I and II ) were observed (Figure F19). Lithostratigraphic Unit I is dominate d by nannofossil ooze with varying amounts of foraminifers and cla y as well as, in the upper interval of the hole, with biogenic silica. Uni t I is divided into three subunits (IA–IC). Subunit IA (Hole U1505C: $0.00{-}27.76\;\mathrm{m})$ ) is composed of dark greenish gray and greenish gra y biosiliceous-rich clay with nannofossils, nannofossil-rich clay wit h biogenic silica, and nannofossil-rich biosiliceous ooze with clay. Th e abundance of biogenic silica decreases downhole. A pinkish gray, ${\sim}6$ cm thick, slightly fining upward ash layer occurs at $20.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Hol e U1505C), and ash pods were observed at $20.3~\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1505D. Subunit IB $({\mathrm{Hole~U1505C}};27.76{-}273.39{\mathrm{~m}})$ is composed of gray t o brown nannofossil ooze with minor silty intervals. The color chang e reflects the varying abundance of foraminifers and clay. Subunit I C (Hole U1505C: $273.39{-}403.79\,\mathrm{~m})$ ) is composed of gray, greenis h gray, and light brownish gray clay-rich nannofossil ooze (with foraminifers) and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze with clay and mino r amounts of nannofossil-rich clay. Unit II (Hole U1505C: $403.50-$ $480.54\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ) is dominated by dark greenish gray, well-consolidate d silty clay and clayey silt (with nannofossils).  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples from Holes U1505A–U1505C were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and diatoms. Additional samples were taken from intervals within th e working-half sections when necessary to refine the ages. Hol e U1505D was not sampled continuously for biostratigraphic analyse s because of time constraints at the end of the expedition, but the sequence recovered spans from the late Miocene to the present (Figure F19). Preservation of calcareous microfossils is good in Core s 368-U1505C-1H through 48X and moderate to poor in Cores 49 X through 64X. Planktonic foraminifers are abundant or common i n Cores 1H through 56X and 59X through 62X and rare in Cores 57X, 58X, 63X, and 64X. Calcareous nannofossils are generally abundan t to common in most samples from Hole U1505C, except for thos e from the upper part of Core 57X.  

Forty-five biostratigraphic datums identified in Hole U1505 C suggest a continuous succession from the early Oligocene to th e Holocene (Figure F19). The Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary i s placed within Core 7H, the Pliocene/Miocene boundary is place d between Cores 11H and 13H, and the Miocene/Oligocene boundary is placed between Cores 54X and 55X. Sedimentation rates ar e ${\sim}7~\mathrm{mm/ky}$ in the Oligocene, ${\sim}15\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{ky}$ during the Miocene–Pliocene, and ${\sim}24\mathrm{\;mm/ky}$ during the Pleistocene.  

Relatively low abundances of planktonic foraminifers deepe r than Core 57X indicate bathyal depths during the early Oligocene, whereas much higher abundances of planktonic foraminifers shallower than Core 56X suggest a deeper water environment since th e late Oligocene.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Only NRM was measured with the SRM in Hole U1505C, excep t for Sections 368-U1505C-1H-1 through 3H-1, which were inline A F demagnetized in three steps. Most of the 55 AF demagnetized discrete samples show very soft magnetic behavior responsible for th e acquisition of a strong, vertical drilling overprint (average inclination $=\,{\sim}81^{\circ}$ ) that was removed by demagnetization to $10{-}15~\mathrm{mT}$ . This soft behavior shows that magnetic remanence is dominated b y multidomain to pseudosingle-domain titanomagnetite or magnetite. The drilling overprint appears to impact discrete samples fa r less than core sections (Figure F20). The lower part of the hol e (Cores 368-U1505C-48X through 64X) is characterized by sever e drilling disturbance, which causes a large scatter of NRM direction s and inclinations.  

Magnetostratigraphic data is based on polarities assigned to th e archive-half sections and corroborated by directions obtained fro m oriented discrete samples. The lower boundary of the Brunhe s (C1n) normal chron is at $37.4~\mathrm{m}$ (0.781 Ma). The lower boundar y $(57.4~\mathrm{m})$ of the reverse polarity r1 is the base of Subchron C1r.3 r with an age of $1.778\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Geochemistry  

Low but measurable hydrocarbon gases were detected only i n Cores 368-U1505C-53X through 60X $(371\!-\!438\;\mathrm{m})$ ). The base of th e hole has methane distributions similar to those at Site U1499, whereas the uppermost section is barren of methane, similar to Sit e U1501. Except for the shallowest $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, TOC, nitrogen, and sulfur contents are mostly low in lithostratigraphic Unit I, bu t sulfur and TOC are slightly higher in Unit II; however, in all case s they are typically ${<}1\%$ (Figure F21). Interstitial water chemistry ha s two important features. The upper part of the hole exhibits pattern s similar to those at Site U1501, with inhibited sulfate reduction, an d low chlorine, bromine, and salinity suggest the presence of freshwater at depth. Freshwater at ${>}400\ \mathrm{m}$ coincides with the presence o f low quantities of methane and the T60 regional seismic unconformity.  

# Physical properties and downhole measurements  

Physical property data were acquired from cores from Hole s U1505C $(0{-}480.5\,\textrm{m})$ and U1505D $(0{-}184\,\textrm{m})$ , including density, magnetic susceptibility, $P$ -wave velocity, NGR, color reflectance, and thermal conductivity. Physical property trends allow us to define two physical property units, PP Units 1 $\left(0{-}403\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and 2 $(403-$ $480\,\mathrm{\,m},$ ). The boundary between Units 1 and 2 displays a distinc t color change from greenish and light brownish gray to dark greenish gray. This boundary, which corresponds to seismic stratigraphi c unconformity T60, is associated with a sharp change in the physical properties. In Unit 1, sediments are composed of foraminifer-ric h nannofossil ooze with clay in the upper part that gradually change s to clay-rich nannofossil ooze in the lower part. This change is well reflected in the NGR, which increases with depth. The higher NG R values in Unit 2 are related to sediment that primarily consists o f silty clay. Magnetic susceptibilities overall gradually decrease wit h depth. The boundary between Units 1 and 2 shows that densitie s and $P$ -wave velocities drop sharply from ${\sim}2.2$ to ${\sim}1.8~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ an d from ${\sim}2250$ to $1750\ \mathrm{m/s},$ , respectively. Porosities abruptly increas e from ${\sim}35\%$ to $\sim\!50\%$ . Thermal conductivity also shows a shar p change at the boundary. Reflectance parameter $L^{\ast}$ and RGB data ar e well correlated with carbonate content.  

Wireline logging was conducted in Hole U1505C using the tripl e combo tool string, which included the HNGS, HLDS, DSI, an d MSS. This logging string collected good data from $341.2\:\mathrm{m}\:(139.1\:\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom of Hole U1505C), which allows the definition o f six logging units that mostly correlate with the lithostratigraphi c units and core physical property data. Logging Unit 1 extends fro m the seafloor to the base of the drill pipe at $78~\mathrm{m}$ . NGR is highly attenuated inside the drill pipe. Logging Unit 2 (base of the drill pip e to $96\;\mathrm{m}$ ) exhibits NGR values that are ${\sim}50\%$ lower than the underlying logging Unit 3. In Unit 3 $(96{-}136\,\mathrm{m})$ , NGR increases with depth. Logging Unit 4 $!136\!-\!220\;\mathrm{m})$ exhibits relatively constant $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ . In logging Unit 5 $(200{-}296\,\textrm{m})$ , resistivity increases with depth, whereas most of the other physical properties are relatively constant. Logging Unit 6 $(296{-}341.2\;\mathrm{m})$ ) has higher magnetic susceptibilities than logging Unit 5.  

Four downhole temperature measurements were conducted i n Hole U1505C using the APCT-3. The temperature values rang e from $4.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $36.7~\mathrm{m}$ to $11.7^{\circ}C$ at $122.8\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , giving a geothermal gradient of $84.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . A heat flow of $94.0\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ was obtained fro m the linear fit between temperature and thermal resistance. The geothermal gradient and heat flow at Site U1505 are comparable to th e relatively high values observed in a number of ODP and IODP site s in this part of the SCS.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

In this section, we assess the achievements of Expedition 36 8 within the SCS toward meeting the four specific objectives of Expeditions 367 and 368 as stated in the Scientific Prospectus. Based o n Expedition 367 results, Expedition 368 chose to follow a modifie d drilling plan from that described in the proposal (Sun et al., 2016b). Based on findings made during Expedition 368, new, alternate site s were proposed to further adjust drilling plans. However, because o f equipment failure, the drilling capability of the R/V JOIDES Resolution was limited to a maximum $3400\;\mathrm{m}$ drill string deployment, severely affecting our possible choice of targets from 25 May 2017 t o the end of the expedition on 11 June. Furthermore, expedition tim e spent from 14 to 25 May installing casing to $990\;\mathrm{m}$ for primary Sit e U1503 was de facto time wasted for the expedition but left an important drill site ready for coring in the future. The overall effect o f this operational constraint is that it directed efforts more towar d Objective 4 (below) than originally planned.  

1. To determine the nature of the basement within critical crustal units across the COT of the SCS rifted margin to discriminate between different competing models of breakup at magma-poor rifted margins. Specifically, to determine whether the subcontinental lithospheric mantle was exhumed during plate rupture.  

This objective was partly achieved during Expedition 368 wit h the potential for completion following postexpedition research.  

Following the partly successful attempt during Expedition 36 7 to identify the nature of the basement within the critical Ridge  A (Site U1499), we decided to pursue a second and alternate drill sit e (Site U1502) at this important ridge structure within the CO T during Expedition 368. To give this site priority over the planne d deep site (proposed Site SCSII-9B) on the distal Ridge C was a significant decision and deviation from the drilling plan in the Scientific Prospectus, which proposed Site SCSII-9B (Site U1503) as th e initial priority of Expedition 368.  

At Site U1502, we recovered ${\sim}180\mathrm{~m~}$ of basalt of possible lat e Eocene age overlain by late Eocene to Miocene deepwater sediments. The basalt shows pillow structures, confirming subaqueou s deposition, found in a seismic stratigraphic position where we expected synrift deposits to be present on the seaward flank of a continental fault block. Onboard preliminary inductively couple d plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy element analyses indicat e they are tholeiitic basalt and are comparable to samples from th e ocean crust within the SCS collected during Expedition 349 an d from Site U1500 of Expedition 367. The shipboard data suggest tha t the basalts may be slightly enriched, but this will need to be constrained by postexpedition work.  

The recovered ${\sim}180\,\mathrm{~m~}$ basalt section shows strong fracturin g and alteration by hydrothermal activity, including mineralizatio n (e.g., massive pyrite). One zone $(40\,\mathsf{c m})$ of potential fault gauge separates an upper and lower series and may suggest that syn- to postbasaltic tectonism was active. This high-temperature hydrotherma l alteration requires that a significant heat source capable of drivin g the hydrothermal system was present and that the deeper crus t might comprise plutonic bodies.  

Combining the findings at Site U1502 with the recovery at Sit e U1499 (Expedition 367; Ridge A) of rift-related syntectonic sediments of Oligocene age suggests that Ridge A is a complex structur e comprising both syntectonic sediments and syntectonic igneou s material. These findings do not constitute a complete understanding of the deep crustal nature of Ridge A, including the specifi c question of whether lower crust or subcontinental lithospheri c mantle is present at depth. Detailed examination of the recovere d basalts will help to constrain the specific nature of the deeper crust.  

We believe that to further advance our understanding of the detailed and deeper nature of Ridge A, future dedicated geophysical surveying and one or two more deep drill holes are required.  

The nature of the crust at the OMH was well addressed durin g Expedition 368. Operations at Site U1501 drilled ${\sim}45\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into th e basement below the Cenozoic sedimentary section and recovere d lithified, coarse-grained sedimentary rocks of presumed Mesozoi c age. This finding verified our predrilling interpretation of the OM H as comprising upper continental crustal material. The basement o f the most eastward extension of the OMH was also sampled at Sit e U1504. In this location, greenschist facies metamorphic rock wa s found within the uppermost part of the OMH basement, suggestin g that only a moderate amount $(\sim\!5\;\mathrm{km})$ of upper crust was remove d prior to deposition of the thin, mainly postbreakup sediments tha t overlie the basement. The timing of the removal of the uppermos t crust is constrained to be of at least pre-early Miocene to pre-lat e Eocene age and very likely much older (Mesozoic or older). If th e cored material allows, postexpedition work on age determinatio n and thermobarometry may suggest a plausible exhumation histor y and if this timing is indeed directly related to the Cenozoic rifting.  

Our inability to pursue deep drilling at Site U1503 obviousl y prevents us from characterizing the nature of the crust at Ridge  C based on in situ drilling data.  

2. To determine the time lag between plate rupture and asthenospheric upwelling that allowed decompression melting to generate igneous ocean crust.  

This objective was achieved during Expedition 368.  

The simple answer to Objective 2 is that there was no time la g between (final) plate rupture and asthenospheric upwelling supporting the generation of igneous material with a basaltic, MORBtype composition. The well-constrained pre-Oligocene age of th e basaltic basement rocks at Ridge A rules out any time lag. In fact,  a potential late Eocene age for the basalt may indicate that asthenospheric mantle melting slightly preceded final breakup. Postexpedition work on mantle melting history may detail the status o f lithospheric thinning at this point of breakup (i.e., thickness of residual subcontinental lithosphere). Age determination and detaile d geochemical work and modelling, however, will be challenging because of the highly altered nature of the basalts.  

Our findings also rule out that the margin in this location withi n the COT was overprinted by late-stage magmatism. The failure t o pursue Site U1503, located on the interpreted earliest full ocea n crust, did not very seriously affect the accomplishment of the specific objective of constraining a possible time lag. However, the failure  to  recover  basement  rocks  at  this  location  means  tha t establishing a well-defined reference frame for assessing mantl e composition and mantle melting conditions during steady-state accretion of igneous crust might be difficult. Likewise, the possibl e modelling based on basalt composition of the decreasing thicknes s of the lithosphere from incipient breakup to full spreading may b e hampered. Site U1500 basalt samples collected during Expeditio n 367 possibly can help in this regard. Reoccupation of Site U1503 is, however, highly recommended to provide a benchmark agains t which the earlier breakup magmatism can be compared. Similarly, i f in the future it would be possible to recover more fresh basaltic material from Ridge A, it would greatly benefit the study of the SC S margin in terms of age determination of the earliest basaltic magmatism and its detailed geochemical elemental and isotopic composition.  

3. To constrain the rate of extension and vertical crustal movements.  

This objective was achieved, but postexpedition work is neede d to further develop our findings.  

Important stratigraphic control on the synrift sediments relate d to breakup was achieved at Sites U1501, U1502, and U1505. At Sit e U1501, located on the OMH, the entire sequence of synrift sediments down to (presumed) Mesozoic basement was recovered. Th e sequence shows development from deltaic to shallow marine wit h terrigenous sedimentation (Eocene) through deepening water, ye t still predominantly clastic detrital sediments ( $\sim$ early Oligocene), t o deepwater marine calcareous sediments (\~late Oligocene to Miocene). Biostratigraphic constraints on the Eocene deposits are lacking below the late Eocene. An almost similar evolution wa s documented at Site U1505 for the late Eocene to Miocene interval. Site U1502, located seaward of the OMH within Ridge A of the distal margin, shows (minor) deepwater deposits of late Eocene age followed exclusively by deepwater deposits of Oligocene to Miocen e age. Site U1504, also at the OMH and slightly more elevated, penetrated a $^{120\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick postrift sedimentary sequence above crystalline  basement.  Deepwater  conditions  were  established  b y lowermost early Miocene time. The presence of a carbonate reef debris deposit (very shallow marine water) with an age of \~late Eocen e suggests that the $\sim\!3\,\mathrm{km}$ subsidence experienced by these sediment s was initiated post-late Eocene. The inability to pursue coring at Sit e U1503 prevented Expedition 368 from extending subsidence studies seaward of Ridge B (Site U1500). However, the most serious lac k of data needed for constraining rate of extension is the lack of biostratigraphic control within the deeper part of the Eocene section a t Site U1501. Similar deltaic to shallow-marine sediments of Eocen e age were found at Site U1435 (Expedition 349), and, although similarly barren of microfossils, detrital zircon was present in the sediment. If present in the Site U1501 samples, age determination on  a population of these might provide maximum ages. The amount o f extension will be determined through a detailed tectonic interpretation of the regional seismic data (courtesy of the Chinese Nationa l Offshore Oil Corporation [CNOOC]) that the entire Expeditio n 367/368 program is based on.  

4. To improve the understanding of the Cenozoic regional tectonic and environmental development of the Southeast Asia margin and SCS by combining Expedition 367/368 results with existing ODP/IODP sediment records and regional seismic data.  

This objective was achieved and was even more successful tha n originally planned, but intensive multidisciplinary postexpeditio n work is needed to maximize our findings.  

One of the most important achievements during Expedition 36 8 was recovering a relatively continuous sequence of the prerift, synrift, and postrift sediments since the Eocene at Site U1501. This sequence will greatly help us to understand the sedimentary processe s associated with tectonic events and paleoenvironmental development  at  the  SCS  northern  margin.  Together  with  micropaleontological evidence of late Eocene age deposits at Site U1502, Expedition 368 findings provide the possible tectonic links betwee n the SCS and the western Pacific in the aspects of the SCS formatio n history.  

Based on the coring/drilling results of Expedition 368, ne w time-depth constraints on some of the major seismic stratigraphi c unconformities that are mapped regionally throughout the basi n were done by integrating microfossil ages, petrophysics, and borehole logging data with the existing seismic reflection data. Amon g these seismic unconformities, the T60 unconformity is the mos t prominent. It is easily recognized basin-wide and is present at Site s U1501, U1502 and U1505. Exploring its nature (e.g., timing and duration, processes, and mechanisms) is very important for understanding the regional geological evolution, but this objective will need further postexpedition work.  

The high-quality postrift sediments cored during Expeditio n 368 will provide major contributions to our understanding of th e late Cenozoic tectonic and environmental history of the SCS. A n early to middle Miocene succession of red claystone was found a t Site U1502 and at Expedition 367 Sites U1499 and U1500, all located below $3500\;\mathrm{mbsl.}$ . The red claystone deposits near the acousti c basement (e.g., basalt or altered basalt or gravel) extending over all of these sites indicates that the SCS basin was deep and the sedimentation rate was extremely low at that time. These condition s may correlate to a basin-wide event related to deep circulation o f oxygenated water from the western Pacific prior to the closure o f the Luzon Strait.  

A late Miocene succession of hemipelagic and turbidite deposit s was observed at deeper Site U1502 and likely recorded the processes that delivered sediment from the shallow shelf or slope of th e northern SCS to the deeper parts of the basin. A high sedimentatio n rate at Site U1502 during the late Miocene and a nearly $10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ hiatu s from the middle Miocene to Pleistocene observed at Site U1504 indicate strong erosion from source areas and efficient transport t o the deep basin.  

The Pliocene–Pleistocene sequence was recovered by doubl e APC holes at Site U1505 that aimed to establish a continuous recor d at this site for high-resolution paleoceanographic and paleoclimati c studies. The hemipelagic deposits, rich in calcareous microfossils, at this site above the modern CCD of the SCS will enable us to reconstruct the east Asian monsoonal climate and paleoceanographi c changes in the SCS at orbital and millennial timescales.  

Postexpedition research using samples from Expeditions 36 7 and 368 together with seismic stratigraphic correlations will continue to improve the contributions to Objective 4. This researc h should be channeled into four general avenues:  

1. To reconstruct the early stage history of the SCS, including paleonvironmental changes from land to deep sea and new data (e.g., detrital zircon geochronology) to constrain the sedimentary provenance.   
2. To explore the paleoceanographic conditions favorable for early to middle Miocene pelagic red clay and late Miocene turbidite deposition through geochemical and geophysical techniques.   
3. To correlate the chronostratigraphic records between Sites U1501, U1502, and U1505; previous IODP Expedition 349 and 367 sites; and ODP Leg 184 sites in the SCS.   
4. To conduct high-resolution paleoceanographic study of Pliocene- and Pleistocene-related monsoonal climate changes and deepwater exchange between the SCS and the Pacific.  

# Integration of drilling results with seismic data  

The large regional set of high-quality seismic data provided b y the CNOOC formed an essential basis for the planning, scheduling, and implementation of Expeditions 367 and 368. The continue d availability of these data to the scientific party will be pivotal fo r postexpedition research on most of the scientific objectives discussed above.  

# Operations  

# Hong Kong port call  

Expedition 368 started at $0754~\mathrm{h}$ (all times in this report are i n ship local time [the same as in Hong Kong], or $\mathrm{UTC}\,+\,8\ \mathrm{h})$ on  9 April 2017 with the first line ashore at the China Merchants Whar f in Hong Kong. After the ship cleared immigration and customs, th e Expedition $368\;{\mathrm{Co}}$ -Chief Scientists, IODP staff, and a group of 1 1 scientists, each representing each ship laboratory, moved onto th e ship and started crossover with their Expedition 367 counterparts. Loading and offloading operations began after clearance was issued. Sixty tons of barite were loaded. The rig crew began breaking dow n 68 stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe and laying them out on the riser hol d hatch. All life rafts were offloaded for inspection to be returne d prior to sailing.  

The rest of the Expedition 368 scientists boarded the ship on th e morning of 10 April and got settled in their rooms. Later that morning they were introduced to life on board the JOIDES Resolution an d participated in an initial laboratory and ship safety tour. Loadin g and offloading operations continued with the loading of 40 shor t tons of sepiolite and the containerized science ocean freight alon g with fresh and refrigerated food products and 300 metric tons o f potable water. Expedition 366 and 367 cores were offloaded fro m the vessel and loaded into refrigerated containers for shipment t o the Kochi Core Center and Gulf Coast Repository, respectively. Ninety joints of $5\%$ inch drill pipe were offloaded to the pier, an d another 72 joints were broken down and stowed on the riser hol d hatch.  

On 11 April, major port call activities included loading 121 2 metric tons of marine gas oil and 40 short tons of sepiolite mud (total $=\sim\!80$ short tons). All dry food for Expedition 368 was loaded. The rest of the 204 joints of $5\%$ inch drill pipe were broken dow n and offloaded to the pier to be returned for inspection and refurbishment. The vessel continued to conduct annual class, radio, an d lifeboat surveys. Tours were conducted for members of the Hon g Kong Sea Cadet Corps and Hong Kong Baptist University.  

On 12 April, casing loading operations were initiated and tour s were conducted for students and faculty from the Southern University of Science and Technology. On 13 April, casing loading operations were completed. Mud motors, underreamers, and reentr y equipment were all loaded and stowed for transit. Annual life boa t inspections and all other certifications were completed. All equipment was secured for sailing.  

At $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 April, immigration authorities boarded the shi p and cleared the personnel and vessel for departure. The harbor pilo t arrived on board shortly after $0900\;\mathrm{h},$ , and with the assistance fro m two harbor tugs the JOIDES Resolution was underway, with the las t line released at $0912\,\mathrm{h}$ . We proceeded to the pilot station, and afte r a 6 nmi transit the pilot disembarked the ship at $0954~\mathrm{h}$ . The se a voyage continued for the next $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . During the transit, the Co-Chie f Scientists presented the scientific objectives for Site U1501 and th e Captain held the first fire and boat safety drill. Later that day, th e  

Co-Chief  Scientists,  key  JOIDES Resolution  Science Operato r (JRSO) staff, and the ship’s crew met to review the coring and logging plan for Site U1501. The scientists began their working shifts, and the noon-to-midnight shift resumed laboratory activities. Th e $255\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Hong Kong to Site U1501 was completed a t $0837\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 April at an average speed of $10.6\,\mathrm{kt}$ .  

# Site U1501  

We conducted operations in four holes at Site U1501. The original plan included two holes, the first to ${\sim}650\;\mathrm{m}$ with the APC/XC B system followed by downhole measurements with the triple comb o and FMS-sonic tool strings. The second hole was to have a reentr y system to ${\sim}640\mathrm{~m~}$ and coring to ${\sim}1063\mathrm{~m~}$ followed by logging wit h the triple combo, FMS-sonic, and VSI tool strings. Actual operations differed significantly from the original plan. Mudlines wer e missed in Holes U1501A and U1501B, with Core 1H for each hol e retrieving a full core barrel. Hole U1501C was cored from the seafloor to $461.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered 447.8 $(96.3\%)$ . Hole U1501D wa s drilled without coring from the seafloor to $433.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and then core d to $644.3\;\mathrm{m}$ . A total of $78.8~\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered $(37.4\%)$ . See Table T1 for the operations summary.  

# Holes U1501A–U1501C  

After arriving at Site U1501, we lowered the thrusters, deploye d a seafloor beacon, put together the APC/XCB bottom-hole assembly (BHA), and started lowering it to the seafloor (2857 mbsl) i n preparation for coring. The calculated precision depth recorde r (PDR) depth for the seafloor at Site U1501 was $2873.4~\mathrm{m}$ below ri g floor (mbrf), and we chose to place the bit at 2868 mbrf to take th e first core. An APC core barrel was lowered to the bit, and coring i n Hole U1501A started at $2345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 April 2017. The mudline cor e recovered $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, and seafloor was calculated to be 286 8 mbrf $(2857.1\ \mathrm{mbsl})$ ). Hole U1501A was terminated at $_{0025\mathrm{h}}$ on 1 6 April to attempt to core a better mudline at this site. The drill strin g was with the bit at 2863 mbrf. We started Hole U1501B at $0100\;\mathrm{h}_{!}$ , again recovering a full core barrel, indicating once again that th e APC system was fired at or below the seafloor, and Hole U1501 B was terminated. The vessel was offset $10~\mathrm{m}$ east of the site coordinates, and the bit was raised to 2843 mbrf in an attempt to star t Hole U1501C, but the core barrel was retrieved empty. We the n lowered the bit to 2848 mbrf for a second spud attempt at $0300\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , and another empty core barrel was retrieved. We lowered the bit t o $2856.4\;\mathrm{mbrf}$ , and Hole U1501C was successfully spudded at $0510\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , recovering $9.3~\mathrm{m}$ of core and establishing a seafloor depth at 2856. 7 mbrf $(2845.8\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ .  

Hole U1501C was cored to $156.8\mathrm{~m~}$ using the full-length AP C coring system. The HLAPC system was deployed to deepen the hol e to HLAPC refusal at $257\textrm{m}$ . We changed to the XCB system an d deepened the hole to a final depth of $469.1\mathrm{~m~}$ . Nonmagnetic cor e barrels were used on all cores. All full-length APC cores were oriented using the Icefield MI-5 tool. The APC recovered $156.5~\mathrm{m}$ o f core $\left(99.8\%\right)$ . Temperature measurements were taken on Cores 368- U1501C-5H $(47.3\;\mathrm{m})$ , 8H $(75.8\ \mathrm{m})$ , 11H $\left(104.3\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and 14H (132. 8 m). Partial strokes were recorded on Cores 16H and 17H (151.8 an d $156.8\;\mathrm{m},$ , respectively). The HLAPC system cored a $100.2\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $88.54\;\mathrm{m}$ of recovery $\left(88.4\%\right)$ . Partial strokes were recorded o n Cores 22F ( $180.3\ \mathrm{m})$ and 25F through 39F $^{(189.7-257\mathrm{~m})}$ . The bi t was advanced $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ after each core despite the partial strokes. Th e bit was advanced $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ after Core 39F.  

The XCB system was deployed to core to refusal, recoverin g $199.5\:\mathrm{m}\:(97.4\%)$ . A hard layer was met at $383.5\;\mathrm{m}$ (Core 53X), and  a small piece of sandstone was recovered in the cutting shoe after retrieving the core barrel. Core recovery after that consisted of mudstone. Three more hard layers were found at 447.1, 454, and $460\;\mathrm{m}$ . Refusal was reached after no advancement was accomplished fo r ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{min}$ at $469.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . There were no indications that casing would b e needed to core deeper using the RCB system at this site. The bit wa s then retrieved to the rig floor, clearing seafloor at $0935\,\mathrm{h}$ and clearing the rotary at $1420\,\mathrm{h}$ . Overall, 62 cores were taken over a $461.9\:\mathrm{m}$ interval with $444.8\;\mathrm{m}$ recovery $(96.3\%)$ . Time spent on Hole U1501 C was $84.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.5 days).  

# Hole U1501D  

The vessel was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1501D. The RCB oute r core barrel was set up in the rotary table, and the core barrels wer e spaced out to the outer core barrel. While making up the BHA,  a leak was detected in the low clutch diaphragm. The diaphragm wa s replaced and back on line by $0500\mathrm{~h~}$ on 20 April. Once the diaphragm was on line, the core barrels were prepped and spaced out, the remainder of the RCB BHA was made up, and the drill strin g was run in the hole to $2816~\mathrm{mbrf}$ . The top drive was picked up an d the bit spaced out to spud Hole U1501D.  

Hole U1501D was drilled to $433.5\ \mathrm{m},$ , and the center bit was retrieved. An RCB core barrel was dropped, and coring began fro m that depth. Coring continued to $644.3\mathrm{~m~}$ using the RCB, and th e hole was conditioned for logging. The rotary shifting tool was run i n to release the bit, and heavy mud was spotted at the bottom of th e hole. The top drive was set back, and the bit was raised to $113\;\mathrm{m}$ fo r logging.  

The rig floor was set up for logging. The average heave was estimated to be $<\!1\,\mathrm{m}$ just prior to logging. A modified triple combo too l string was made up and run into the open hole. The tool string hun g up at ${\sim}3030$ mbrf $\left(173.3\,\mathrm{~m}\right)$ ). After six attempts, the tool finall y passed through that depth with significant drag and then continue d downhole smoothly until it reached 3156 mbrf $(299.3\ \mathrm{m})$ ). At tha t depth, the full weight of the tool hung up and would no longer advance. The consensus among the wireline engineer, drilling department, and operations department was that the hole was collapse d and logging would have to be conducted from that point upward.  

There was a significant overpull at ${\sim}173.3\,\mathrm{m}$ . The caliper log indicated that the hole was collapsed to approximately the same diameter as the tool itself. It was deemed unsafe to attempt to go belo w that depth with any subsequent passes, and the rest of the loggin g program was terminated. The drill pipe was recovered to the ri g floor, clearing the seafloor at $1225\mathrm{h}$ on 24 April and the rotary a t $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 April.  

A total of 90 cores were recorded for the site. The APC syste m was deployed 19 times with the full APC core barrel. The HLAP C system was deployed 22 times, the XCB system was deployed 2 3 times, and the RCB system was deployed 26 times. The total drille d interval was $433.5\;\mathrm{m}$ without recovery. The APC cored interval wa s $175.8\mathrm{~m~}$ with a recovery of $176.6\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(100.1\%)$ . The HLAP C cored interval was $100.2\;\mathrm{m}$ with a recovery of $88.54\mathrm{~m~}(88.4\%)$ . Th e XCB cored interval was $204.9\;\mathrm{m}$ with a recovery of $199.53\;\mathrm{m}$ of cor e $(97.4\%)$ . The RCB cored $210.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $78.77\,\textrm{m}$ of cor e $(37.4\%)$ . Total core recovered at Site U1501 was $543.10\;\mathrm{m}$ . The overall recovery for Site U1501 was $78.5\%$ . Total time spent at Sit e U1501 was $224.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (9.4 days).  

# Site U1502  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1502 with th e objective of sampling the lowermost sediment and underlying basalt. At Site U1502, we successfully penetrated from the seafloor t o the sediment–basalt contact at $728\;\mathrm{m}$ and $180\,\mathrm{m}$ into the underlyin g basalt. The sedimentary section was not continuously cored, and recovery in the cored intervals was highly variable $(46\%)$ . In contrast, core recovery in the basalt was significantly better $(70\%)$ . Downhol e logging was conducted in Hole U1502B with the triple combo an d VSI tool strings.  

Our operations in Hole U1502A were designed to provide information on formation characteristics and drilling conditions so tha t we could decide the length of casing to drill into the seafloor a t deep-penetration Hole U1502B. Given this purpose and the amoun t of time to drill the second, deep hole, we did not core continuousl y in Hole U1502A. Instead, we drilled without coring from the seafloor to $375\;\mathrm{m}$ and cored with the RCB from 375 to $758.2\;\mathrm{m},$ recovering $176.81\;\mathrm{m}$ $(46\%)$ .  

In Hole U1502B, we drilled a reentry funnel and $727.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing into the seafloor, continuously cored a sediment sequence from 727.7 to $739.16\mathrm{~m~}$ ( $11.46\mathrm{~m~}$ cored; $3.55\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $30.9\%)$ ) with the RCB system, continuously cored $180\,\mathrm{m}$ into the underlying basalt from 739.16 to $920.95\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ( $128\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $70\%$ with the RCB system, and collected downhole log data with the triple combo and VSI tool strings.  

See Table T1 for the operations summary. A diagram of the reentry cone and casing in Hole U1502B is shown in Figure F22.  

# Hole U1502A  

After laying out the knobbies, the drill string was pulled out o f the hole, clearing the seafloor at $1225\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 24 April 2017. Th e acoustic beacon was recovered at $1511~\mathrm{h}$ . The recovery of the pip e continued, and at $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 April, the end of the mechanical bi t release (MBR) cleared the rig floor, ending Hole U1501D and Sit e U1501.  

The JOIDES Resolution made the $36.5\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ transit from Sit e U1501 to U1502 in $3.6\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , averaging 10.1 kt. The vessel arrived ove r the site coordinates at $2142~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 April. At $2240\ \mathrm{h},$ an acousti c beacon was deployed ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ west of the site coordinates. Upon arrival at Site U1502, a new $_{\mathrm{C-4~RCB}}$ bit with a MBR was assemble d onto the bottom of the BHA. The core barrel space out wa s checked, and the BHA was lowered to 161 mbsl. A PDR depth wa s taken on arrival, showing a calculated seafloor depth of $3768.4\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ . The bit was lowered to $3733~\mathrm{mbsl},$ stopping every 20 stands t o fill the pipe with water. The upper guide horn (UGH) was pulled, and the underwater camera system was deployed to the seafloor t o observe the seafloor tag. While the camera was being lowered, 11 5 ft of drill line was slipped and cut. Next, the bit was spaced out t o 3750.7 mbsl and slowly lowered until it tagged the seafloor. Seafloo r was determined to be at 3763.7 mbsl. The bit was again spaced ou t to $3750.7\ \mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and the top drive was picked up. The UGH wa s raised, and the underwater camera was recovered at $1215\,\mathrm{h}$ . A center bit was dropped and landed in the BHA, the bit was lowered, an d Hole U1502A was spudded at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 April. The hole was advanced without coring to $375\;\mathrm{m}$ in $18\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . The center bit was pulled, and an RCB bit was dropped to begin coring operations. One of th e main objectives in Hole U1502A was to core with the RCB system t o a depth in the formation that would provide a good and stable casing set point for the next hole.  

Cores 368-U1502A-2R through 7R were drilled very quickly an d had little recovery. This interval was interpreted as unconsolidate d sand. Penetration rates slowed for Cores 8R through 14R, with th e bit taking ${\sim}15{,}000$ lb of weight during coring operations. Recover y improved through this mudstone interval but dropped off in wha t was interpreted as another unconsolidated sand interval from 499. 5 to $585.9\mathrm{~m~}$ (Cores 15R through 23R). A second mudstone interva l was sampled, with very good recovery from Core 24R at $585.9\;\mathrm{m}$ t o Core 39R at $739.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . The last $2\,\mathrm{m}$ of the following core (40R) drille d very slowly, indicating a major change in formation. One more cor e was drilled to confirm the continuity of the formation change. A t that point, it was decided to terminate coring in Hole U1502A i n favor of continuing to core in a cased hole. The drill string wa s pulled to the surface, clearing the seafloor at $0330~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 April, ending Hole U1502A, and beginning Hole U1502B.  

Total time spent in Hole U1502A was $125.25\mathrm{~h~}$ (5.2 days). Th e RCB system was used exclusively for the hole. A total of 40 core s were taken over a $383.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interval with $176.81\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of recover y $(46.1\%)$ . There was one drilled interval from the mudline to $375.0\;\mathrm{m}$  

# Hole U1502B  

The RCB components of the BHA were laid out and secured, and the rig floor was cleared for reentry and casing operations. Th e vessel was offset to the coordinates provided from the science office, and the UGH was removed and laid out to the drill collar racks.  

The hydraulic release tool (HRT) was made up to a landin g stand and racked back in the derrick. The prepared mud skirt wa s moved onto the moonpool doors and centered underneath the rotary table. After rigging-up to run $10\%$ inch casing, 62 joints of $10\%$ inch casing $(723.7\;\mathrm{m})$ ) were run through the mud skirt. The landin g stand was picked up, and the casing was lowered to the moonpoo l and latched into the mud skirt. The adapter flange was unbolted, and the landing stand was pulled back to the rig floor and racke d back in the derrick.  

The bit, bit sub, underreamer, and mud motor were assembled, and a pump-in sub was connected to the top of the mud motor. Th e mud motor and underreamer were function-tested in the moonpoo l with good results. The remainder of the stinger was assembled. Th e landing joint was again picked up, and the mock hanger and HR T were attached to the top of the casing and mud skirt. The adapte r flange was again bolted up and torqued up with a torque wrench t o the recommended torque. The reentry funnel was picked up in th e moonpool and securely welded to the mock hanger.  

The drilling and casing assembly were lowered to the seafloor. Every 20 stands, the drill string was secured and filled water to prevent collapse from differential pressure. After running-in to $3744\;\mathrm{m},$ the subsea camera was lowered to the bottom of the pipe to observ e the drilling activity. While the camera descended, the top drive wa s picked up and the rig was serviced. The drill string was spaced out, and slow circulating rates were recorded. Hole U1502B was spudded at $3763.7\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ at $1255~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 May. The drilling and casing installation continued until the mud skirt landed on the seafloor. After successfully drilling the $723.7\,\textrm{m}$ long casing string into th e seafloor, the go-devil was inserted into the drill pipe and pumpe d down to release the casing at $2220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 May. The drill string wa s released from the casing assembly, and the bit and underreame r were pulled back through the casing to the rig floor. The bit cleare d the seafloor at 0115h on 3 May. The remainder of the drill strin g was pulled back to the rig floor, and the bit cleared the rotary tabl e at $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 May.  

After removing the tricone bit, the mud motor and underreame r were flushed with freshwater and laid out. The UGH was reinstalled, and the drill floor was reassembled. The RCB outer cor e barrel was set up in the rotary table, and the core barrels wer e spaced out to the outer core barrel. The remainder of the RCB BH A was made up, and the drill string was lowered to 3732 mbsl. Th e subsea camera system was deployed and run to near bottom i n preparation for reentering Hole U1502B and beginning coring operations. While the subsea camera was lowered to the seafloor, 115 f t of drill line was slipped and cut. After a $3.5\;\mathrm{h}$ search, we found th e Hole U1502B reentry cone and reentered the hole at $0400~\mathrm{h}$ on  4 May. The camera was pulled back to the surface and secured.  

The bit was lowered through the casing until encountering fill a t $715.3\;\mathrm{m},$ , $12.4\:\mathrm{m}$ above the total depth of the hole. The top drive wa s picked up, a core barrel was dropped, and the hole was washed an d reamed to bottom. A 20 bbl mud sweep was circulated to help clea n cuttings from the hole. Once the hole was clean, coring began i n Hole U1502B from $727.7\,\textrm{m}$ . Coring continued to Core 368- U1502B-21R at $846.8\;\mathrm{m}$ . While cutting Core 21R, the driller notice d some excessive torque while on bottom. With $48.8~\mathrm{h}$ on the bit, i t was decided to pull out of the hole for a bit change. The bit wa s found to be in relatively good condition.  

The drill string was pulled inside the casing before setting bac k the top drive. Overpull of 60,000 lb was noted between $740.3\;\mathrm{m}$ an d the casing shoe. The bit was then pulled to the mouth of the reentr y cone, and the vibration isolated television (VIT) camera was run t o the seafloor to verify the condition of the base and cone. The con e was visible but below the surface. Sea water was circulated in a successful attempt to clear the funnel of cuttings, and the VIT was retrieved to the moonpool. The bit was then pulled to surface, clearing the seafloor at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ and clearing the rotary at $1345\,\mathrm{h}$ on  8 May.  

A new $9\%$ inch $_{\mathrm{C-7~RCB}}$ bit and a MBR were installed in th e BHA, and the bit was run back to seafloor, followed by the subse a camera, for reentry. The cone was clearly visible, and Hole U1502 B was reentered at $0240\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 May. The camera was recovered, an d the bit was lowered to $728.3~\mathrm{m}$ , ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{m}$ below the casing shoe. Th e top drive was picked up, and a center bit was dropped. The hole wa s then washed to total depth with the fill holding 10,000 lb weight o n bit from 733.3 to $770.3\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

A mud sweep was circulated, and the center bit was retrieve d prior to resuming coring operations.  

Coring continued to $858.4\textrm{m}$ when the low clutch diaphrag m failed for a second time during the expedition at $0115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 May. The bit was pulled inside the casing and up to $715.3\;\mathrm{m}$ , and the drill pipe was hung off the elevators. The clutch diaphragm was replaced, and the drill string was lowered again by $0945\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 May.  

The driller noticed a spike in pressure while running in hole, an d a deplugger was dropped to clear any obstruction in the bit. The deplugger was retrieved, and a center bit was deployed so that the bi t could be worked to the bottom of the hole. A total of $3\;\mathrm{m}$ of fill wer e cleared before reaching the total depth of the hole. The center bi t was recovered, and coring resumed from $858.4~\mathrm{m}$ (Core 25R) to  a final depth of $920.8\;\mathrm{m}$ (Core 37R). Recovery was generally high ove r this interval $(82\%{-}101\%)$ , except for Cores 28R and 29R, which ha d only $33\%$ and $45\%$ recovery and a higher rate of penetration of 2.7 6 and $3.75\;\mathrm{m/h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , respectively. The hole was then prepared for loggin g operations by circulating a high-viscosity mud sweep and performing a wiper trip. The bit was then released in the bottom of the hole, and the end of pipe was raised to a logging depth of $747.3\;\mathrm{m}$ to ensure that the logging tools could bypass obstructions encountere d by the bit when reentering the hole below casing.  

# Downhole logging  

Two logging tool strings were deployed in Hole U1502B: a modified triple combo and the VSI. The triple combo tool string wa s rigged up, zeroed, presurvey calibrated, and deployed in the hol e with the DSI, HLDS (with source), HNGS, Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC), and Logging Equipment Head (LEHQT).  

The string made it into the open hole without any issue, but i t stopped at a maximum depth of $4639\,\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , roughly $45.5\;\mathrm{m}$ higher tha n the driller’s total depth. Based on an unexpected drop in NGR readings through casing, material at this depth was believed to be fil l from above that had slumped and fallen to the bottom of the hole.  

The repeat pass was taken from that depth up to the point wher e the logging head was just outside the pipe. The tool was then returned to maximum depth, which remained firmly at $4639\mathrm{~m~}$ . Th e main log was started there and continued up past the seafloor t o provide a continuous NGR log of the entire interval. The caliper wa s closed at $4549\mathrm{~m~}$ to facilitate pipe entry, which proceeded withou t any problems. The tools were pulled to surface with ease until th e final joint of pipe at the top.  

With the EDTC already sticking out of the top of the pump-i n sub during the process of pulling the tool up to remove the densit y source, a large overpull was observed, causing the tension alarms t o trip and disable winch function. Several attempts to free the too l were made, but they only resulted in it becoming too stuck to mov e up or down significantly. An alternate plan of disconnecting the firs t joint of drill pipe to permit access to the tool inside and then disassembling whichever portion was free to move worked, and the radioactive source along with the majority of the string was rigge d down. The portion remaining stuck in the top single consisted onl y of the LEHQT and EDTC, which were extracted relatively quickl y and easily from the bottom of that single using an air tugger.  

There was no sign of damage to the tool string itself nor any sig n of a problem in the affected joint of pipe, so the cause is believed t o have been a fragment of shear pin from coring or other item of smal l debris such as a pebble. The offending item was never located, bu t the string was safely rigged down with only about $0.5\,\mathrm{h}$ of additiona l time required. The wireline was extracted from the travelling block s to facilitate pulling the pipe up to $\mathord{\sim}69$ mbsl for the seismic run, an d wireline operations were paused for that action.  

The VSI tool string was rigged up, zeroed, presurvey calibrated, and lowered in Hole U1502B with the VSI tool, EDTC, and LEHQT.  

While pulling up the pipe, the drill crew observed that the hol e was beginning to flow and had to make an unplanned break in th e trip to pump down some seawater to stop the flow. Once that wa s done, the seismic string was rigged up and lowered inside the hol e without finishing the pull-out because the pipe was already at 402 3 mbsl $\left(259\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , which was sufficiently high to avoid any major complication with the seismic experiment, and it was getting too late t o raise the pipe any higher and still have sufficient time to finish th e survey before dark.  

The tool was rigged up as quickly as was safe to do so and run i n the hole at a somewhat accelerated rate to make as much use as possible of the remaining daylight. The depth was correlated and adjusted to be on-depth in real time using a distinct NGR peak at 441 3 mbrf (corrected depth based on field pick of sea bed; raw depth o f 4411.3 mbrf on main pass of first run). With the seismic tool ondepth, several attempts were made to get out of the casing an d down to the bottom of the hole so that the deepest requested stations for the survey could be recorded, but the tool appeared to b e hanging up on a ledge and was unable to pass into the open-hol e section.  

Having very little daylight remaining in which to complete th e rest of the survey, the decision was made to abandon the open-hol e stations and concentrate on getting as many of the cased-hole stations as time would permit. In all, eight stations were attempted, al l in casing, and of those, the deepest two did not produce any useful signal, but the upper six all resulted in good seismic arrivals. Th e seismic survey was concluded roughly at sunset, and the tool wa s pulled out of hole and rigged down in the usual manner. The heav e compensator was not required for any portion of the logging because the total heave was approximately $\pm2$ inches throughout th e entire operating time.  

The Schlumberger equipment was then rigged down, and th e crew began recovering the drill string. The bit cleared the seafloo r at $2235\ \mathrm{h}$ on 13 May. The beacon was recovered at $0015~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 4 May, and the vessel began moving toward Site U1503 in dynami c positioning mode. The bit cleared the rotary at 0445 h on 14 May, ending Hole U1502B and Site U1502.  

Total time spent in Hole U1502B was $337.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (14.1 days). Th e RCB system was used exclusively for the hole. Overall, 36 cores wer e taken over a $193.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interval with $126.94\mathrm{~m~}$ of recovery $(65.7\%)$ . There was one drilled interval from the mudline to $727.7\mathrm{~m~}$ wit h $10\%$ inch casing installed to $723.7\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Site U1503  

We conducted operations in one hole at Site U1503 with the objective of sampling the lowermost sediment and $150\;\mathrm{m}$ into the underlying basalt. In this hole, we installed a reentry system and 991. 5 m of casing ( $10\%$ inch), but we were unable to continue deepenin g the hole because of mechanical problems with the drawworks: (1 ) fourth clutch diaphragm failure, (2) failure of the aft shaft bearin g on one of the Elmagco brakes, and (3) inability of the ship drillin g equipment to operate deeper than $3400~\mathrm{m}$ without the low clutch. Therefore, Site U1503 was abandoned without achieving any scientific objectives. Despite this major setback to the expedition and th e South China Sea Rifted Margin program, Hole U1503A remains  a legacy hole for future occupation.  

# Hole U1503A  

The JOIDES Resolution began the transit from Site U1502 to Sit e U1503 in dynamic positioning mode while pipe was being tripped. The mud skirt and reentry cone to be used at Site U1503 was move d to the center of the moonpool and stationed on the moonpool doors. With this equipment secured, the thrusters were pulled an d the vessel was underway at full speed at $0806\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 May 2017.  

The vessel arrived on site at $0930~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 May to find the Chinese R/V Shiyan 2, operated by the South China Sea Institute o f Oceanology, conducting a seismic survey in the area. Because o f this, the JOIDES Resolution was unable to occupy the site until 113 0 h on 14 May. The vessel completed the $19.8\ \mathrm{nmi}$ voyage from Sit e U1502 in $8.6~\mathrm{h}$ $7.2~\mathrm{h}$ in dynamic positioning mode and $1.4~\mathrm{h}$ a t cruise speed).  

Once on site, a positioning beacon was deployed and the cre w made up the BHA with a $14\%$ inch bit to drill a hole without corin g to $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ for installation of $10\%$ inch casing. The bit was lowere d through the reentry cone and base that was assembled and placed i n the moonpool. A PDR depth was taken upon arrival, placing th e seafloor at 3873.1 mbsl. The bit was lowered to $3846~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the to p drive was picked up, and the bit was spaced out to spud Hol e U1503A. The hole was started at $2010~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 May and was advanced to a depth of $902.8\;\mathrm{m}$ at $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 May. At this time, th e rig mechanic noticed a leak in the low clutch diaphragm, which ha d already been replaced twice during the expedition. It was decided t o pull the bit to the surface before the diaphragm failed completely. The bit was pulled to $97.6\ \mathrm{m},$ , and the reentry cone assembly wa s free-fall deployed. The subsea camera was lowered to observe th e landing orientation of the cone (Figure F23A). Once the camera wa s near the sea bottom, the bit was pulled out of the hole, clearing th e seafloor at $0750\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 May. The bit tagged the internal aperture o f the cone to establish a seafloor depth of $3867.7\,\mathrm{m},5.4\,\mathrm{m}$ higher tha n previously thought. The hole depth was adjusted to $908.2\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The bit was then pulled to $3846\ \mathrm{m},$ , and 215 ft of drill line wa s slipped and cut. The bit was pulled to the surface, clearing the rotary at $1655\,\mathrm{h}$ . With no spare clutch diaphragms on board and delivery of spare diaphragms not until ${\sim}20\mathrm{\May};$ it was decided to mov e along with all possible operations without using the low drive on th e drawworks.  

The drill crew ran 85 joints $(989.3\ \mathrm{m})$ of $10\%$ inch casing an d crossed over to a 16 inch casing hanger. While attempting to engag e the DrilQuip running tools, it was noted that the seal diameter o n the casing hanger was too small. The crew modified the hanger t o enlarge the seal diameter and engaged the running tool. The casin g was then lowered into the moonpool and hung off the moonpoo l doors.  

The crew then picked up the mud motor and underreamer, lowered the drilling assembly into the moonpool, and tested them. Th e rest of the drilling assembly was made up and lowered through th e casing. The running tool was then reengaged into the casing hanger, and the entire casing string and drilling assembly was lowered as fa r as possible $(2379\mathrm{~m})$ without using the drawworks low clutch an d then hung off the traveling blocks. Our last operation was to mak e up three stands of knobbies and pump a pig through each stand t o clean any rust; these were then racked back in the derrick for us e when drilling-in the casing.  

The rig then went on downtime on Thursday 18 May at $0915\;\mathrm{h}$ until the replacement parts (low clutch diaphragms) were delivere d to the ship at $2310\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 May. The seagoing tug Taikoo arrived o n site with three spare low clutch diaphragms. The tug stationed itsel f on the port aft side of the JOIDES Resolution. Supplies were offloaded, and the tug departed by $2320\,\mathrm{h}$ . At the end of the week, th e crew began replacing the low clutch diaphragm.  

Repairs were complete by $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 May. The driller continued lowering the casing string from 2379 mbsl to the seafloor, fillin g the pipe with seawater every 25 stands. The subsea camera was deployed, and Hole U1503A was reentered at $1005~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 May wit h the $10\%$ inch casing string. The casing began taking weight at 34 2 m; thus, it was pulled back, the top drive was installed, and the mu d motor, bit, and underreamer were used to drill the casing to the bottom of the predrilled hole at $908.2~\mathrm{m}$ . We continued drilling-in th e last $86.9~\mathrm{m}$ of casing, reaching $991.5~\mathrm{m}$ . The casing was released a t $0915~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 May, and the camera and the drilling assembly wer e recovered. The mud motor and underreamer were flushed wit h freshwater and laid out. The casing running tool was detorqued an d laid out.  

The UGH was installed, and the drill crew began making up an d deploying an RCB BHA. The bit was lowered to $1232~\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , whe n the drill crew noticed a loud noise coming from the forward Elmagco brake. The aft bearing on the forward Elmagco brake ha d failed. The crew began working to replace the brake with a reconditioned unit that was loaded on board in Hong Kong. This job wa s scheduled for the maintenance period following Expedition 368. W e were lucky that the seas were calm, as this typically can’t be done a t sea.  

Repairs began at ${\sim}0530\ \mathrm{h}$ on 23 May. Because of the calm seas, the crew was able to make the heavy crane lifts required. The forward brake was disconnected and moved to the rig floor where th e hub could be removed for use on the replacement. The 28,000 l b (12.7 metric tons) nonfunctioning brake was then transferred to th e main deck, and the replacement was moved to the rig floor to hav e the hub fitted and be installed on the forward end of the drawworks. The brake was moved into place, the electrical and water connections were made, and the shaft was aligned by $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 May.  

Operations resumed, and the bit was lowered to $3819~\mathrm{{mbsl}}$ a t $1100~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 May, when it was noticed that the low clutch diaphragm was leaking again. The diaphragm was replaced for th e fourth time during this expedition (completed at $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 May). Because of the deep water depth along with the planned deep penetration at Site U1503, we would need to extensively use the lo w clutch. Because of the number of diaphragm failures so far and wit h only one more spare left on board, it was determined that the safes t action would be to terminate operations in Hole U1503A withou t reentering the cased hole. An optimistic delivery date for additional clutch diaphragm spares, if available, was estimated for 2 June. If w e were to reenter Hole U1503A and had an additional clutch failur e while coring below the casing, the remaining spare would b e enough only to get the drill string out of the hole, and any failed operations in the open hole could have prevented a future reentry operation. This was a very difficult decision to make, but with tw o more weeks left of the expedition the decision was made to switc h to operations at sites with shallower water depths and penetratio n that did not require the use of the low clutch while drilling or coring. Therefore, we decided to transit to Site U1504 and continue operations there.  

Before departing from Site U1503, the subsea camera was deployed to the seafloor to inspect the Hole U1503A reentry. Th e cone appeared to be $1\mathrm{-}2\:\mathrm{m}$ below the seafloor but was clearly visibl e and expected to be available for reentry at a later date (Figure F23B, F24). Consequently, the site can be considered a legacy site for future expeditions. The camera was retrieved, the bit was recovered, and the rig was secured for transit. The thrusters were up at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 May, and the vessel began the $42.5\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1504.  

# Site U1504  

We drilled two holes at Site U1504. In Hole U1504A, we core d with the RCB system from the seafloor to $165.5\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovere d $52.77\textrm{m}$ $(31.9\%)$ . In Hole U1504B, we drilled without recovery t o $88.2\;\mathrm{m}$ and then cored $111.8\;\mathrm{m}$ with the RCB system with $21.48\;\mathrm{m}$ o f recovery $(19.2\%)$ .  

# Transit to Site U1504  

The JOIDES Resolution began the transit from Site U1503 to Sit e U1504 at $0948~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 May 2017 and arrived on site at $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ th e same day. The thrusters were lowered, and we switched to dynami c positioning mode at $1432\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , beginning operational time at Sit e U1504. An RCB BHA was made up and deployed to 1720 mbsl before a failure of the pipe spinner on the iron roughneck. The spinne r was replaced, and the crew continued to lower the pipe to 277 6 mbsl. The underwater camera was deployed, and the bit was place d at $2813~\mathrm{mbsl}$ for a short seafloor survey to verify that no seafloo r cables were in the area. The seafloor was tagged after the survey, determining a water depth of $2816.6~\mathrm{m}$ . The camera was retrieved, and the top drive was picked up for starting Hole U1504A. Corin g in Hole U1504A started at $0215~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{m}}$ , and the bit reached the sediment/basement contact at $136.4~\mathrm{m}$ (at $1455~\mathrm{h}$ on $27\;\mathrm{May}$ ). Corin g continued to $165.5\ \mathrm{m},$ where erratic torque and overpull caused u s to terminate coring operations in this hole at $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 May. Th e bit was recovered to the surface, clearing the seafloor at $1220\,\mathrm{h}$ an d the rotary at $1740\,\mathrm{h}$ . The rig floor was secured for the $22\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transi t to Site U1505 by $1825\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 May, ending (temporarily) operation s at Site U1504.  

Total time spent in Hole U1504A was $50.5\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.1 days). The RC B coring system was used exclusively for the hole. Overall, 21 core s were taken over a $165.5\:\mathrm{m}$ interval with $52.77\,\mathrm{m}$ of recovery $(31.9\%)$ .  

# Return to Site U1504  

We returned to Site U1504 after completing Site U1505. Th e $22.2\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1505 to Site U1504 was completed a t $0048\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 June. The thrusters were lowered, and the heading wa s controlled at $0357\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , beginning operational time at Site U1504.  

An RCB BHA was made up, and core barrels were spaced out.  A center bit was installed, and the bit was deployed to $2776\mathrm{~m~}$ . Th e underwater camera was deployed to the bit, and the drill string wa s hung off the elevator stool. The low clutch was then dismantled, an d the low clutch diaphragm was replaced. The diaphragm had faile d during operations at Site U1505 but was not replaced then becaus e it was not necessary for operations at that site and the crew wante d to have a new diaphragm installed at seafloor in case it was necessary during operations in Hole U1504B. The replacement took 7.7 5 h. Once completed, the top drive was picked up and the bit was lowered to the seafloor.  

Seafloor was tagged at $2843.0\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ . The underwater camera wa s recovered to the moonpool, and Hole U1504B was spudded at 225 0 h on 4 June. The hole was advanced without coring to $88.2\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

The center bit was recovered using the core line, and an RC B core barrel was dropped to begin coring. Sediments were recovere d in Core 368-U1504B-2R. The following two cores, 3R and 4R, contained coral and reefal limestone fragments. Basement rubble wa s recovered from Core 4R downhole. RCB coring continued throug h Core 20R at $200.0\;\mathrm{m}$ . Torque was erratic throughout basement coring operations, and half cores were cut for all basement cores excep t Core 19R.  

Coring was terminated due to time after Core 20R, and the bi t was recovered to the surface, clearing the seafloor at $0455\,\mathrm{h}$ and th e rotary at $1040~\mathrm{h}$ on 7 June. The rig floor was secured and mad e ready for the $946\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Shanghai, China, by $1130~\mathrm{h}$ on  7 June. The vessel was underway at $1200\,\mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1504B an d Site U1504.  

Total time spent in Hole U1504B was $80.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.3 days). The RC B coring system was used exclusively for the hole. Overall, 19 core s were taken over a $111.8\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $21.48\;\mathrm{m}$ of recovery $(19.2\%)$ .  

# Site U1505  

Four holes were APC/XCB cored at Site U1505 with the objective of recovering a complete sedimentary succession from the earl y Miocene to Holocene that can supplement the interval sampled a t Site U1501 for postexpedition paleoceanographic and paleoclimatological studies. Core 368-U1505A-1H misfired (failed shear pins ) and recovered only $_{0.3\mathrm{~m~}}$ . Core 368-U1505B-1H penetrated $3\,\textrm{m}$ into the seafloor, recovering $3.23\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core $(107\%)$ . With a goo d mudline core, the hole was terminated. Hole U1505C was cored t o $480.2\ \mathrm{m},$ recovering $480.15\mathrm{~m~}$ $(100\%)$ ). Hole U1505D was cored t o $184.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , recovering $191.43\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(104\%)$ . Downhole logging with  a modified triple combo tool string was conducted in Hole U1505C.  

# Transit to Site U1505  

The JOIDES Resolution began the transit from Site U1504 to Sit e U1505 at $1854~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 May 2017 and arrived on site at $2112\,\mathrm{{h}}$ th e same day. The thrusters were lowered, and the heading was controlled at $2148\,\mathrm{h},$ , beginning operational time at Site U1505.  

# Holes U1505A and U1505B  

An APC/XCB BHA was made up, and a PDR depth was taken t o help determine seafloor. By $0000\ \mathrm{h},$ , the drill string was being lowered to the seafloor followed by the subsea camera system to observe the end of the pipe tag the seafloor and start APC coring i n Hole U1505A. At $0545\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{{i}}}$ , 29 May, a water depth of 2916.6 mbsl wa s established. Before retrieving the underwater camera, we conducted required routine rig servicing, which consisted of slippin g and cutting 115 ft of drilling line. The top drive was picked up whil e recovering the subsea camera, and the bit was spaced out to 2911. 2 m to spud Hole U1505A. There was an apparent misfire (faile d shear pins) of the APC, and the core barrel was recovered to surface. The barrel had $0.38\:\mathrm{m}$ of core, far less than anticipated, and the hol e was terminated at $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ in order to attempt a better mudline.  

The bit was spaced out to $2912.1~\mathrm{mbsl},$ and Hole U1505B wa s spudded at $1235\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 May. The core was recovered with $3.23~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. With a good mudline core, Hole U1505B was terminated at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Hole U1505C  

The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1505B, and the bit wa s spaced out to 2916.1 mbsl. The decision was made to core to XC B refusal or to the maximum drill string weight that could be lifte d using the high clutch (whichever came first) due to a leak in th e newly replaced low clutch diaphragm. Hole U1505C was started a t $1340\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 May. Seafloor was calculated at 2917.4 mbsl based o n recovery from Core 368-U1505C-1H. The full-length APC syste m was used to refusal at $207.1\;\mathrm{m}$ , with APCT-3 temperature measurements taken on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H. All four deployment s produced good temperature data. APC refusal was determined afte r partial strokes on five consecutive cores (19H through Core 23H). The HLAPC was then deployed and used to recover 24 cores, 24 F through 47F. All HLAPC cores were considered partial strokes, wit h the standpipe retaining pressure after each core. The residual pressure in the standpipe was bled off using the Cameron Orbit valve. HLAPC refusal was determined with recovery of 3.14 and $2.60\:\mathrm{m}$ i n Cores 46F and 47F, respectively. While bleeding pressure on Cor e 47F, the diaphragm on the pneumatic actuation for the Orbit valv e failed. The pressure was bled by manually opening the valve. Th e valve was taken out of service and repaired.  

The XCB system was then deployed and used to core to $480.2\;\mathrm{m}$ before drill string weight dictated the end of coring operations. Th e hole was displaced using heavy mud, and the bit was spaced out to  a depth of $80.1\;\mathrm{m}$ below the seafloor in preparation for logging.  

A modified triple combo tool string was rigged up and lowere d into the hole. The tool string was exceptionally long, consisting o f all tools typically run as part of the triple combo (MSS, HLRA, HLDS [with source], HNGS, EDTC, and LEHQT) with the additio n of the DSI for acoustic velocity. The DSI was added to the first ru n in anticipation of potential hole problems that might prevent subsequent runs based on experience at nearby sites with similar lithology. The tool string began collecting data a few meters above th e seafloor and recorded continuously to the deepest point the tool s could reach, which was a firm hole obstruction at $341.2\;\mathrm{m}$ . The tool string was unable to pass below that depth even after several attempts. Accordingly, the repeat pass was conducted from that dept h for a length of ${\sim}110\;\mathrm{m}$ , and the main pass was also conducted fro m that depth up to just above the seafloor. During the run, the tool string collected NGR, density (with caliper), acoustic velocity, neutron porosity, and magnetic susceptibility. The caliper indicate d that the hole diameter was too large ( $_{>14}$ inches) for effectively collecting useful data with the FMS-sonic and VSI tool strings. Therefore, the decision was made to end downhole logging operations in Hole U1505C. The tools were pulled to the surface after logging was completed. After rigging down the logging equipment, the bit was raised, clearing the seafloor at $1755~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 June and ending Hole U1505C.  

Total time spent in Hole U1505C was $103.0~\mathrm{h}$ (4.3 days). The APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems were deployed in the hole, coring a $480.2\:\mathrm{m}$ interval and recovering $480.15\:\mathrm{m}\:(100.0\%)$ .  

The APC system was used to cut 23 cores over a $207.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $99.9\%$ recovery. The HLAPC system was used to cut 24 cores over a $109.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interval, recovering $112.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(102.7\%)$ . The XCB system recovered $160.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $(98.3\%)$ over a $163.2\;\mathrm{m}$ interval.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used on all cores for the hole. All full-length APC cores were oriented. APCT-3 temperature measurements were taken on Cores 4H, 7H, $10\mathrm{H}$ , and 13H.  

# Hole U1505D  

The vessel was offset $_{20\textrm{m}}$ south of Hole U1505C, and the bit was spaced out to $2911.6~\mathrm{m}$ . Hole U1505D was spudded at $2200~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 June 2017. Seafloor was calculated at 2917.5 mbsl based on recovery from Core 368-U1505D-1H. The hole was then cored to a total depth of $184.5~\mathrm{m}$ using the APC system. Then the bit was recovered to surface, clearing the seafloor at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table at $2310\,\mathrm{h}$ . The beacon was recovered while raising pipe and was on deck at $1953\,\mathrm{h}$ . The thrusters were raised, and the rig floor was secured for transit. The vessel was underway to return to Site U1504 at $0048~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 June, ending Hole U1505D and Site U1505. The plan was to drill a second hole to basement at Site U1504 with the time remaining on the expedition.  

Overall, 20 APC cores were taken in Hole U1505D over a 184.5 m interval with $191.43\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered $(103.8\%)$ . Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all cores and all cores were oriented using the Icefield MI-5 tool.  

# Education and outreach  

Expedition 368 had a team of three Onboard Outreach Officers: one teacher from the United States and two journalists from China. The Officers communicated the goals of their jobs on the ship to all scientists at the beginning of the expedition. This presentation gave examples of how the Onboard Outreach team could be a resource for the scientists to share the process of science during the expedition to the general public. The three Onboard Outreach Officers had different approaches and targets for their products and in their responsibilities, as well as working together to support the webcast program and a collaborative music video project; this report includes a summary of their work.  

# Webcasts  

The Onboard Outreach Officers used a direct satellite link, iPad, and videoconferencing software (Zoom) to interact with K–12 classrooms, organizations, and universities around the world. The video connection schedule was prepared using a public Google calendar, direct contact with teachers to advertise the opportunity, and requests from scientists on board the JOIDES Resolution. Each webcast was led by the Officer who spoke in English or Mandarin depending  on  the  language  of  the  shore-based  attendees.  On occasions where the native language of the attendees was different, a scientist who was fluent in that language led the webcast (e.g., Italian or Dutch). The connections were used to reach students from primary schools to universities (both graduate and undergraduate levels), as well as with organizations who wished to learn more about the program. A typical session was approximately $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and was divided into the following parts:  

• Identification of the geographical location and presentation of the geological questions addressed by the expedition;   
• Brief review of plate tectonics and the rifting margin;   
• Tour of the ship with a close look at the derrick, the rig floor, and the catwalk;   
• Tour of the laboratories with questions to the scientists present (usually core describers, geophysicists, paleomagnetists, and paleontologists); and   
• Opportunity for the students to ask questions.  

A total of 53 events reached ${\sim}2500$ students in 8 different countries (USA, China, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, France, Japan, and Argentina). Before every video connection, the Onboard Outreach Officer interacted with the schools by sending the teachers some selected educational materials about the JOIDES Resolution, the seafloor drilling research, and the scientific topics related to Expedition 368. Before each week of webcasts, the Officer would communicate the schedule of broadcasts to the science party, Marine Computer Specialists, and Expedition Program Manager. Before the start of the broadcasts, the Officers would check in with scientists and IODP technicians to make sure that the broadcasts did not interrupt their workflow. After the video connection, a survey was sent to all of the teachers and participants (from Europe and USA).  

# Music video production  

The Onboard Outreach Officer team worked with the Science Party and IODP technicians to produce a short music video to be used for promotion of the IODP program. This video was filmed over the course of 1 day by the Chinese Officer/Videographer and edited by the US Officer. It was shown at the postexpedition celebration in Shanghai.  

# Social media  

The US Onboard Outreach Officer maintained four social media accounts during the expedition: the JOIDES Resolution’s blog at http://joidesresolution.org, Facebook page, Twitter feed, and Instagram account. Additionally, she produced 14 short videos that were posted on the JOIDES Resolution YouTube channel and received 1329 views during the course of the expedition. The total number of posts on the blog was 34, with 7044 read by the general public. The blog posts were divided into different areas: science as a process and highlights of areas of research, educational activities and reflections, scientist interview series, and ship life. Each post was crafted over the course of 1–2 days through interviews with scientists and observations and, when needed, were reviewed by scientists or technicians for accuracy before posting. The total number of Facebook posts was 57. The posts reached ${\sim}111{,}150$ people with 21,600 post clicks and 2455 reactions, shares, or comments. A total of 31 tweets on Twitter were made with 36,373 impressions and 808 engagements. A total of 17 posts on Instagram were made and received 951 likes.  

The US Onboard Outreach Officer also hosted a Reddit Science “Ask Me Anything” session, answering 15 questions from the public over the course of $2\,\mathrm{{h.}}$ Four members of the night shift science party participated in answering the questions. This session is permanently archived  at  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6dgfih/science_ama_series_scientists_are_on_board_the/.  

# Educational material  

The US Onboard Outreach Officer produced several scientist interview products discussing the process of science and careers in science. These scientists’ interviews are intended to be a product that educators can use to lead discussions about career paths in science. Additionally the Officer worked with the paleontology team and other scientists on shore to do background research for future curriculum development projects.  

The US Officer worked with several different outreach tools: webcasts (Zoom), blog posts through the JOIDES Resolution website (http://joidesresolution.org/), video production for YouTube, and other social media accounts for outreach (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram).  

# Chinese media outreach  

During the 2 months of Expedition 368, the journalist from Science and Technology Daily wrote about 30 news articles, including 4 videos and some photos, and the SMG News broadcasted 7 articles with Short Videos and 6 TV News, including a music video about the JOIDES Resolution.  

These reports highlighted the importance of ocean drilling, the history and achievements of IODP, and the research progress of this expedition. The reports also told the stories of the scientists on board, explaining their work and showing their life on board. These reports were widely distributed in Chinese media and networks. They also helped enhance the public’s awareness of IODP and scientific research in the SCS.  

The Chinese journalists and scientists also did 26 education outreach broadcasts.

Figure F2. A–D. Schematic development of continental breakup initiated by a simple shear along a deep, low-angle fault. B–D are slightly modified from Huismans and Beaumont (2011) and illustrate modeling-based stages of extension at magma-poor rifted margins of the Iberia-Newfoundland type. Key features o f D are thinning of the upper crust, juxtaposition of lower crust and serpentinized mantle between the outer margin and igneous oceanic crust. $\mathsf{U P=}$ uppe r plate, $\mathsf{L P=}$ lower plate. The Expedition 367/368 drilling strategy will sample and test whether or not these fundamental crustal units and tectonic relationship s are present at the northern SCS rifted margin.

Figure F4. Deep crustal time-migrated seismic reflection data (A) without interpretation and (B) with interpretation. Note the rather thin lower crust (two layers) above a strong Mohorovicic seismic discontinuity (Moho) reflector that can be followed oceanward. Moho reflection is weak to absent seaward fro m around the interpreted continent–ocean boundary (COT). Wide-angle seismic data (Yan et al., 2001) confirm $\sim\!6\,\mathsf{k m}$ thick ocean crust (OC) to be present seaward of the COT. A large detachment fault $\sim\!150\;\mathsf{k m}$ inland of the COT separates more stable crust landward from that of highly extended crust seaward. A n outer margin high (OMH) is a fairly consistent feature margin along this margin segment. Key seismic unconformities are shown in purple (T70; $^{\sim32}$ M a breakup unconformity?) and blue (T60; $^{\sim}23$ Ma regional basin event). These ages are inferred from long distance $(>\mid00\mid\mathsf{k m})$ correlation of seismic unconformities with industry holes and ODP Leg 184 Site 1148 (T60). These ages need confirmation by coring, and are only tentative. Tg unconformity (green) is basement. Approximate position of seafloor magnetic anomalies with chron numbers are shown by arrows. Seismic data is from Line 04ec1555-08ec1555 (courtes y of the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation [CNOOC]). Location of line is shown in Figure F3. ${\mathsf{C D P}}=$ common depth point; C11?, C10?, and $\mathsf{C}9?=$ possibl e Chrons. $\mathsf{M S B=}$ midslope basin.

Figure F5. Two-way traveltime to (A) basement (Tg unconformity) and (B) Reflector T60. The proposed drilling transect (thick black line) is located approximately at the center of a margin segment bounded to the southwest by a transform fault. The northeastern boundary of the margin segment is located aroun d IODP Expedition 349 Site U1435. In this location, the outer margin high and Ridge A seem to coalesce, and Ridges B and C of the continent–ocean transitio n become indistinct toward the northeast within the next margin segment. Note that the outer margin high is slightly oblique to more parallel Ridges A, B, and C.
