# Abstract  

Volcanic arcs are the surface expression of magmatic system s that result from the subduction of mostly oceanic lithosphere a t convergent plate boundaries. Arcs with a submarine component include intraoceanic arcs and island arcs that span almost $22,000\ \mathrm{km}$ on Earth’s surface, the vast majority of which are located in the Pacific region. Hydrothermal systems hosted by submarine arc volcanoes commonly contain a large component of magmatic fluid. Thi s magmatic-hydrothermal signature, coupled with the shallow wate r depths of arc volcanoes and their high volatile contents, strongly influences the chemistry of the fluids and resulting mineralizatio n and likely has important consequences for the biota associated wit h these systems. The high metal contents and very acidic fluids i n these hydrothermal systems are thought to be important analogs t o numerous porphyry copper and epithermal gold deposits mined today on land.  

During International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 376 (5 May–5 July 2018), a series of five sites was drilled o n Brothers volcano in the Kermadec arc. The expedition was designe d to provide the missing link (i.e., the third dimension) in our understanding of hydrothermal activity and mineral deposit formation a t submarine arc volcanoes and the relationship between the discharge of magmatic fluids and the deep biosphere. Brothers volcan o hosts two active and distinct hydrothermal systems: one seawaterinfluenced and the other affected by magmatic fluids (largely gases). A total of $222.4~\mathrm{m}$ of volcaniclastics and lavas was recovered fro m the five sites drilled, which include Sites U1527 and U1530 in th e Northwest (NW) Caldera seawater-influenced hydrothermal field; Sites U1528 and U1531 in the magmatic fluid-influenced hydrothermal fields of the Upper and Lower Cones, respectively; and Sit e U1529, located in a magnetic low that marks the West (W) Calder a upflow zone on the caldera floor. Downhole logging and borehol e fluid sampling were completed at two sites, and two tests of a prototype turbine-driven coring system (designed by the Center for Dee p Earth Exploration [CDEX] at Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology [JAMSTEC]) for drilling and coring har d rocks were conducted.  

Core recovered from all five sites consists of dacitic volcaniclastics and lava flows with only limited chemical variability relative t o the overall range in composition of dacites in the Kermadec arc. Pervasive alteration with complex and variable mineral assemblage s attest to a highly dynamic hydrothermal system. The upper parts o f several drill holes at the NW Caldera hydrothermal field are characterized by secondary mineral assemblages of goethite $^+$ opal- $\mathbf{A}+\mathbf{z}\mathbf{e}-$ olites that result from low-temperature $(<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ reaction of roc k with seawater. At depth, NW Caldera Site U1527 exhibits a highe r temperature $({\sim}250^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ secondary mineral assemblage dominated b y chlorite $^+$ quartz $^+$ illite $^+$ pyrite. An older mineral assemblag e dominated by diaspore $^+$ quartz $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ rutile at the bottom of Hole U1530A is indicative of acidic fluids with temperature s of ${\sim}230^{\circ}{-}320^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . By contrast, the alteration assemblage at Sit e U1528 on the Upper Cone is dominated by illite $^+$ natroalunite $^+$ pyrophyllite $+\ \mathrm{quartz}+\mathrm{opal-CT}\ +$ pyrite, which attests to high-temperature reaction of rocks with acid-sulfate fluids derived from th e disproportionation of magmatic $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ . These intensely altered rock s exhibit extreme depletion of major cation oxides, such as MgO, $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , CaO, MnO, and $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ . Furthermore, very acidic (as low as p H 1.8), relatively hot $(\leq\!247^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ fluids collected at depths of 160, 279, and 313 meters below seafloor (mbsf) in Hole U1528D have chemical compositions indicative of magmatic gas input. In addition, preliminary fluid inclusion data provide evidence for involvement o f two distinct fluids: phase-separated (modified) seawater and a n ${\sim}360^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ hypersaline brine, altering the volcanic rock and potentiall y transporting metals in the system.  

The material and data recovered during Expedition 376 provid e new stratigraphic, lithologic, and geochemical constraints on th e development and evolution of Brothers volcano and its hydrothermal systems. Insights into the consequences of the different types o f fluid-rock reactions for the microbiological ecosystem elucidated b y drilling at Brothers await shore-based studies.  

# Introduction  

Magmatic systems that result from subduction of mainly oceanic lithosphere at convergent plate boundaries are manifested b y volcanic arcs at the surface. Those arcs that contain a submarin e component include intraoceanic arcs and island arcs, spanning almost $22,000~\mathrm{km}$ on Earth’s surface, the vast majority of which ar e located in the Pacific region (de Ronde et al., 2003). It is estimate d that all intraoceanic arcs combined may contribute hydrothermal emissions equal to $\sim\!10\%$ of that from mid-ocean ridges (MORs ) (Baker et al., 2008).  

Hydrothermal activity associated with these submarine arc volcanoes is commonly dominated by the discharge of magmatic volatiles in contrast to MOR systems that are governed by seawate r circulation through basaltic oceanic crust. Submarine arc magmatic-hydrothermal systems are driven by crystallization of magmas produced by mantle melting fluxed by volatiles released fro m the subducting slab. These magmas are enriched by an order o f magnitude in volatiles compared with MOR basalts (e.g., Wallace, 2005; Plank et al., 2013). Degassing of these arc magmas gives rise t o extraordinary phenomena, such as the discharge of liquid $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Lupton et al., 2006) and the formation of liquid “lakes” of sulfur o n the seafloor (de Ronde et al., 2015). Although intraoceanic arcs ar e some of the most hostile environments for life because of the exceptionally high concentrations of toxic metals and metalloids in ver y acidic, gas-rich, and high-temperature fluids, diverse animal an d microbial communities are commonly observed (e.g., Clark an d O’Shea, 2001; Takai et al., 2009).  

The Kermadec segment of the Kermadec-Tonga intraoceani c arc (Figure F1) is host to ${\sim}32$ large volcanoes, $80\%$ of which are hydrothermally active, making it the most active arc in the world. Th e magmatic-hydrothermal signatures, including high concentration s of sulfur and carbon species gases and high iron contents, couple d with the shallow depths of venting ${\sim}1800{-}120$ meters below se a level [mbsl]) of these volcanoes, heavily influence the chemistry o f the discharging fluids and the minerals that precipitate from thes e fluids and have important consequences for the biota associate d with these systems. Given the high metal contents and very acidi c fluids, these hydrothermal systems are also considered to serve a s important submarine analogs to many of the porphyry copper an d epithermal gold deposits exploited on land today.  

Brothers volcano on the Kermadec arc is such a system and ha s been the focus of a continuing series of studies. An International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) workshop (Lisbon, Novembe r 2012:  http://www.ecord.org/science/magellanplus)  identifie d Brothers volcano as the top candidate worldwide for arc volcan o drilling. Hence, Expedition 376 was designed to provide the missin g link (i.e., the third dimension) in our understanding of mineral deposit formation along arcs, the subseafloor architecture of thes e volcanoes and their related permeability, and the relationship between the discharge of magmatic fluids and the deep biosphere.  

# Geological setting  

The Kermadec-Tonga arc northeast of New Zealand (Figure F1 ) is one of the longest contiguous intraoceanic arcs in the world. More than 60 volcanoes of varying size occur along the arc—th e vast majority of which are submarine—with more than half occurring in the Kermadec sector (de Ronde et al., 2003, 2007). Volcani c rocks along the Kermadec arc range in composition from basalt t o rhyodacite. Trace element and isotopic data indicate significan t magma source heterogeneity both along and across the arc as a result of variable subduction of continent-derived sediments, pelagi c sediments, and oceanic crust and/or interaction with continenta l crust (e.g., Gamble and Wright, 1995; Gamble et al., 1996; Haase e t al., 2002; Timm et al., 2012, 2013, 2014).  

Brothers volcano (Figure F2) is one of three caldera volcanoe s included in 13 major volcanic edifices that form the active Kermadec volcanic arc front between $37^{\circ}\mathbf{S}$ and $34^{\circ}50^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ (Wright, 1997; Wright and Gamble, 1999). Brothers volcano is part of a ${\sim}35~\mathrm{km}$ long and $15\,\mathrm{km}$ wide predominantly silicic volcanic complex that i s dissected by basement fractures and associated dike-controlle d ridges that are $1{-}1.5~\mathrm{km}$ wide and rise $400{-}500\ \mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor. These structures strike predominantly $55^{\circ}$ to $65^{\circ}$ , although  a conjugate set of faults is observed subparallel to the elongate d Brothers edifice and caldera (Figure F2). These orientations ar e consistent with Havre Trough rifting (e.g., Wright et al., 1996; Deltiel et al., 2002; Ruellen et al., 2003) and indicate first-order extensional tectonic control on Brothers volcano. The base of Brother s volcano rises from a water depth of ${\sim}2200\ \mathrm{m}$ to a continuous caldera rim at $1540~\mathrm{m},$ , although locally the northwestern rim (or Upper Caldera wall) shoals to $1320\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . The caldera floor has a basa l diameter of $3{-}3.5\;\mathrm{km}$ , reaches a water depth of $1850\;\mathrm{m},$ and is surrounded by $290{-}530\ \mathrm{m}$ high walls. An elongate northeast–southwest postcollapse cone $(1.5{-}2~\mathrm{km}$ wide $\times~350~\mathrm{m}$ high), the Uppe r Cone, occurs within the caldera, and a satellite cone appears (Lowe r Cone) on its northeastern flank (Figures F3A, F3B). The Uppe r Cone in part coalesces with the southern caldera wall and shoals t o $1220\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ (de Ronde et al., 2005).  

Brothers volcano represents a window into the complicated hydrothermal systems found at submarine arc volcanoes, which display a range of geological and structural settings and vent flui d chemistry, as well as animals and microbes as yet undiscovered a t any other site on the seafloor. Six hydrothermal fields have bee n identified in or on the walls of the caldera at Brothers volcano (Figures F2, F4). Five of these fields are presently active (the Upper Caldera, NW Caldera, W Caldera, Upper Cone, and Lower Cone sites), whereas the Southeast (SE) Caldera site is currently inactive, or a t least it does not contribute to vent plumes measured above the seafloor (Baker et al., 2012). Extensive autonomous underwater vehicl e (AUV) mapping of the caldera (de Ronde et al., 2012; Embley et al., 2012) has shown that these hydrothermal fields, with the exceptio n of the Lower Cone site, are closely correlated to areas of magneti c “lows” that are consistent with zones of hydrothermal upflow (Figure F5) (Caratori Tontini et al., 2012a, 2012b; Gruen et al., 2012).  

The five active fields exhibit two different types of hydrotherma l activity. Type I hydrothermal systems are characterized by hightemperature $(\le\!320^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ venting of relatively gas-poor, moderatel y acidic fluids at the W, NW, and Upper Caldera sites, where Cu-Au– rich sulfide chimneys are common. Type II hydrothermal fields ar e characterized by lower temperature $(\Omega120^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ venting of gassy, ver y low pH (to 1.9) fluids at the summits of the Upper and Lower Con e sites, where native sulfur chimneys and extensive iron oxyhydroxid e crusts occur (de Ronde et al., 2005; 2011). Time-series studies of hydrothermal plumes above the four most active sites (i.e., Upper Caldera, NW Caldera, and the Upper and Lower Cone sites) show tha t the cone sites expelled fluids of widely differing compositions between 1999 and 2018, with large variations in dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ , particulate Cu, dissolved Fe, and Fe/Mn values (Humphris et al., 2018). B y contrast, the composition of chronic plumes above the NW Calder a site (the Upper Caldera site was discovered only in 2017), althoug h chemically distinct from the other hydrothermal vent sites, have no t changed over the same interval (de Ronde et al., 2005; Humphris e t al., 2018).  

In 2005, Neptune Minerals, Inc. drilled a number of shallo w holes (to depths of $14.8~\mathrm{mbsf})$ at Brothers volcano. Sixteen hole s were drilled on the slopes of the NW Caldera wall, and a single hol e was drilled inside the crater atop the Upper Cone. The uppermos t material of many of these holes consisted of dark brown ooze locall y containing glass sand and grit. This material was commonly underlain by a zone of $\mathord{\sim}1\;\mathrm{m}$ thickness containing pieces of sulfide chimney, glass grit, Fe-Si-Mn oxyhydroxides, and mixtures thereof. Typically underlying this zone were variably hydrothermally altere d volcanic rocks ranging from volcanic silt and sand to volcanic glass, gravel, breccia, and more massive volcanic rock (dacite). Alteratio n colors ranged from pale gray to pale green, and stockwork veins locally cut the rocks. The one core drilled inside the pit crater atop th e Upper Cone intersected volcanic breccia, gravels, and rocks together with native sulfur down to 10 meters below seafloor (mbsf).  

Microbial community development patterns associated with th e two types of hydrothermal activity at Brothers volcano have bee n explored using limited (four) samples collected from the seafloo r (Stott et al., 2008; Takai et al., 2009). Microbial community compositions obtained from chimneys at the NW Caldera site are characterized  by  an  abundance  of  slightly  thermophilic  an d hyperthermophilic chemolithoautotrophs (Takai et al., 2009), as observed in typical high-temperature hydrothermal vent environments of MORs and back-arc basin systems (Nakamura and Takai, 2014). By contrast, microbial communities from the Lower Con e exhibit a diversity of bacterial lineages, with potential psychrophili c and  thermophilic  sulfur-  and  iron-oxidizing  chemolithotroph s (Stott et al., 2008) like those found in the magmatic volatile–rich hydrothermal environments of submarine arc volcanoes (Nakamur a and Takai, 2014). These intrafield differences in microbial community composition and function are thought to be associated with th e different hydrothermal fluid compositions in the two types of hydrothermal systems. In particular, the highly variable volatile species concentrations induced by phase separation, the variabl e mixing ratios of hydrothermal and seawater inputs, and the concomitant precipitation of mineral phases are considered crucial factors  in  the  control  of  chemosynthetic  microbial  communit y development (Takai and Nakamura, 2011; Nakamura and Takai, 2014). The two distinct hydrothermal microbial ecosystems occurring together within a caldera, showing a clear niche segregation i n response to both physical and chemical differences in the hydrothermal fluids, is currently globally unique (Flores et al., 2012; Nakamura and Takai, 2014).  

Modeling of the subseafloor hydrology at Brothers volcano ha s suggested that subseafloor phase separation, inferred from measured temperatures and calculated end-member vent fluid chemical and isotopic compositions, can be achieved only by the primary input of saline magmatic fluids at depth (de Ronde et al., 2011; Grue n et al., 2012, 2014). In addition, the vent systems appear to evolv e over short time periods, as expulsion of magmatic heat and volatile s occurs within the first few hundred years of magma emplacement i n the form of low-salinity vapor-rich fluid, while magmatically derived salt is temporarily trapped in the crust. This retained salt i s then periodically expelled from the system by later convection o f low- to high-temperature hydrothermal fluid of seawater origi n (Gruen et al., 2014). This model has important implications for th e distribution of metals in the hydrothermal mineralization. Sulfidecomplexed metals (e.g., Au) will preferentially ascend during th e early vapor-dominated fluid discharge, whereas chloride-complexed metals (e.g., Cu, Pb, and $Z\mathfrak{n}$ ) will be retained in the dens e magmatic brine, thus potentially forming layers of metal sulfide s with distinct zonation at depth (Gruen et al., 2014).  

# Scientific objectives  

The four primary scientific objectives outlined in the Expeditio n 376 Scientific Prospectus (de Ronde et al., 2017) were to (1) characterize the subvolcano, magma chamber–derived volatile phase t o test model-based predictions that this is either a single-phase gas o r two-phase brine-vapor, (2) determine the subseafloor distributio n of base and precious metals and metalloids and the reactions tha t have taken place along pathways to the seafloor, (3) quantify th e mechanisms and extent of fluid-rock interaction and consequence s for mass transfer of metals and metalloids into the ocean and th e role of magmatically derived carbon and sulfur species in mediatin g these fluxes, and (4) assess the diversity, extent, and metabolic pathways of microbial life in an extreme, metal-toxic, and acidic volcani c environment. The drill sites represent discharge zones of geochemically distinct fluids that are variably affected by magmatic volatil e input, allowing us to directly address the consequences of magm a degassing on metal transport to the seafloor and its effect on th e functioning of microbial communities.  

To meet these objectives, a strategy involving two independen t drilling efforts was developed to recover cores from both shallo w $\left(<\!200\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and deep $(\sim\!200{-}800\,\mathrm{m})$ intervals. Cores with good recovery are required from the shallowest intervals (tens of meters depth ) to examine aspects of hydrogeology, permeability, fluid flow, an d seawater entrainment as well as their effects on microbial community development and habitability. We will acquire these cores b y deploying the MeBo seafloor drill rig (Freudenthal and Wefer, 2007 ) from the R/V Sonne at a time yet to be planned (Bach, Haase, Wefer, and de Ronde, co-PIs). This scheduled shallow drilling allowed Expedition 376 to bypass coring in the shallowest parts of the hole s when necessary and strategically prepare the holes for the casing required for deep coring. The operational plan for Expedition 376 wa s to drill, core, and log three sites—one on the northwest rim of th e caldera, one on the western side of the caldera floor, and one ato p the Upper Cone—to provide access to critical zones dominated b y magma degassing and high-temperature hydrothermal circulatio n over depth ranges considered crucial in the development of multiphase mineralizing systems.  

# Site summaries  

Site U1527  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1527 (proposed Site NWC-1A) is located on the rim of th e northwest caldera wall of Brothers volcano at a water depth of 146 4 m (Figure F6). Drilling targeted what was thought to be either th e margin of an older modified-seawater hydrothermal upflow zone o r a recharge zone to the currently active discharge areas several hundred meters away from either side of the drill site. A key objective o f Expedition 376 was to quantify the mechanisms and extent of fluidrock interaction and the consequences for mass transfer of metal s into the ocean in both seawater-dominated and magmatic fluiddominated hydrothermal systems within the caldera of Brother s volcano. Hence, the main objective of Site U1527 was to drill through the margin of the inferred upflow zone of a modified-seawater system.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in three holes at Site U1527. Hol e U1527A is located at $34^{\circ}51.6528^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.2397^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth o f $1464.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . We used the rotary core barrel (RCB) system in Hol e U1527A to core from the seafloor to 101.4 mbsf. Recovery was poo r $\left\langle1.27\,\mathrm{~m}\right\rangle$ $1.3\%$ ). The downhole conditions encountered in Hol e U1527A determined the preparations for running a reentry system. In Hole U1527B, located at $34^{\circ}51.6519^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.2526^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a wate r depth of $1464.2\ \mathrm{m},\ 10.75$ inch casing was drilled-in to 95.5 mbsf, and final penetration of the drilling assembly was 105.5 mbsf. Upo n release from the casing, the reentry system hung up on the underreamer arms, which failed to retract, and the entire assembly wa s recovered to the surface.  

Hole U1527C is located at $34^{\circ}51.6625^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.2534^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a wate r depth of $1464.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . After installing $95.5~\mathrm{m}$ of casing, we RCB core d continuously from 99.9 to 238.0 mbsf and recovered $25.9\;\mathrm{m}\;(19\%)$ o f material. We had extremely poor to no recovery in unconsolidate d volcanic deposits until a formation change at 187 mbsf, when average recovery increased to $49\%$ for the rest of coring in cemented volcaniclastic rocks. Unstable hole conditions forced abandonment o f Hole U1527C and, once again, the reentry system was unintentionally retrieved because of clogging of the hydraulic release tool (HRT) and upper casing sub. A total of $249.5~\mathrm{h},$ or 10.4 days, wer e recorded while at Site U1527.  

# Principal results  

Igneous rocks cored at Site U1527 were divided into two unit s (Figure F7). Igneous Unit 1 was recovered in Hole U1527A (29.10– 67.81 mbsf) and Hole U1527C (108.40–176.16 mbsf). It consists o f plagioclase-clinopyroxene phyric and Fe-Ti oxide–bearing blac k dacite lava with glassy trachytic groundmass and spatially associated fresh scoria and pumice lapilli.  

Igneous Unit 2 was recovered in Hole U1527C (185.20–234.3 8 mbsf). The contact between Units 1 and 2 was not recovered. Igneous Unit 2 consists of progressively hydrothermally altered lapillituffs, tuff-breccias, and lapillistone and is divided into four subunit s (2a–2d) based on changes in modal composition of clasts, matrixto-clast ratio, and color. Igneous Subunit 2a (185.20–185.44 mbsf ) is a lapilli-tuff, consisting of fresh dacitic clasts surrounded by  a brown, fine-grained matrix that probably represents altered tuff. Igneous Subunit 2b (185.44–220.98 mbsf) is composed of matrix-supported monomict and polymict lapilli-tuffs, lapillistones, and tuffbreccias. Igneous Subunit 2c (220.98–226.49 mbsf) is made up o f clast-supported polymict lapillistones, whereas Igneous Subunit 2 d (228.40–234.38 mbsf) is composed of both altered matrix-supported and clast-supported tuff-breccias and lapilli-tuffs.  

Igneous Unit 2 rocks contain various clasts of volcanic origin: (1) fresh to slightly altered dacite in Subunit 2a; (2) volumetricall y significant greenish gray altered volcanic clasts in Subunits 2b, 2c, and 2d; (3) fine-grained, dark green altered clasts in Subunit 2b; an d (4) various types of rare dark gray volcanic clasts in Subunits 2b, 2c, and 2d. The matrix of the volcaniclastic rocks and the groundmas s within volcanic clasts in Igneous Unit 2 appear very similar to th e trachytic groundmass of the dacite clasts in igneous Unit 1, but the y are increasingly replaced by secondary chlorite, clays, and quart z with depth. All clasts contain varying amounts of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides, strongly resembling the primary phenocryst assemblage of the dacite lavas of Igneous Unit 1. Although th e degree of alteration increases downhole, as indicated by the increasing degree of silicification, plagioclase crystals are only slightly altered, whereas clinopyroxene is altered significantly or disappears, and Fe-Ti oxides alter to sulfides.  

Three distinct types of alteration were observed in core materia l recovered from Site U1527 (Figure F8). Alteration Type I (0–185.4 4 mbsf) occurs in intervals of fresh to slightly altered volcanic rock s and is characterized by low-temperature alteration mineral assemblages (Figure F9). This alteration type is divided into distinct Subtype Ia and Subtype Ib. Alteration Subtype Ia $\left(0{-}185.20\,\mathrm{\mbsf}\right)$ consists of unaltered to slightly altered vesicular dacitic lava characterized by formation of zeolite in vesicles and the occurrence o f palagonite, iron oxyhydroxide, and trace pyrite partly replacing volcanic glass. Alteration Subtype Ib (185.20−185.44 mbsf) solely pertains to the volcaniclastic rocks of Igneous Subunit 2a, which ar e slightly to moderately altered. The clasts exhibit only trace alteration and retain primary plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocrysts, but the degree of alteration in the matrix increases compare d to alteration Subtype Ia. The alteration material in the matrix consists of iron oxyhydroxide and illite with minor zeolite, smectite, magnetite, and pyrite.  

Alteration Type II (185.72–234.38 mbsf) is characterized b y more extensive alteration of most primary minerals, with the clast s and matrix of the volcaniclastic rocks being replaced by clay minerals, silica, and pyrite (Figure F9). This alteration type is also divide d into two subtypes. Alteration Subtype IIa (185.72−234.38 mbsf; intercalated with Subtype IIb and Type III) features a pervasive greengray chlorite-smectite mineral assemblage with increasing amount s of cryptocrystalline/amorphous silica, infilling pore spaces, and increasing abundance of disseminated pyrite with depth. Moderate t o intense alteration occurs in both clasts and matrix of the primar y volcaniclastic rocks and increases in degree downhole. Alteratio n Subtype IIb (186.40−208.06 mbsf; intercalated with Subtype IIa) i s characterized by several centimeter- to meter-scale zones of yellowbrown alteration, overprinting greenish Alteration Subtype IIa. Th e overprinting boundary is sharp. Iron oxyhydroxide and occasionall y oxidized pyrite give this alteration type its characteristic yellowbrown color. Throughout both the green and yellow-brown altere d intervals, clasts display a range of degrees of alteration and resorption from slightly altered clasts with primary igneous textures an d sharp boundaries to intensely altered clasts with diffuse boundarie s to the surrounding matrix.  

Alteration Type III (220.98−226.49 mbsf) represents a more heterogeneous alteration type that is intercalated with Alteration Subtype IIa. In this type of alteration, both clasts and matrix ar e pervasively altered (Figure F9). The matrix contains dark gray silic a and chlorite, disseminated pyrite (as much as $3\;\mathrm{vol\%}$ ), and magnetite. Vugs are partially filled with clay minerals and silica.  

Unaltered volcanic rocks from Hole U1527A and the shallowe r sections of Hole U1527C (Igneous Unit 1) represent dacites that ar e compositionally similar to those previously reported from Brother s volcano (e.g., Haase et al., 2006; Wright and Gamble, 1999; Timm e t al., 2012). Most of the pervasively altered volcaniclastic rocks recovered from Hole U1527C (Igneous Unit 2) share the incompatible element composition (i.e., $\mathrm{Zr/Y}$ and $Z\mathrm{r}/\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ ) of overlying Igneou s Unit 1 from the same hole. This commonality suggests a commo n parental magma, despite petrographic differences.  

Geochemical analyses of the highly altered, variously colore d volcaniclastic rocks demonstrate the mobility of alkali element s during high- and low-temperature hydrothermal alteration of th e rock (Figure F10). Analyses of $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , Rb, Ba, $M\mathrm{gO},$ , and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ content s define a complex history of hydrothermal overprinting marked b y multiple alteration stages. Alteration Type III displays significan t enrichment in total sulfur content (up to $1.9\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Geochemical changes recorded in Hole U1527C are consistent with petrographi c observations, including the formation of pyrite and replacement o f groundmass and matrix by clay in deeper, more altered volcaniclastic rocks.  

Organic carbon comprises the bulk of measured total carbo n concentrations.  Detectable  only from  185–205 mbsf in  Hol e U1527C, this organic carbon may originate from seawater-derive d fluid circulation and/or microbial biomass. Headspace analysis o f gases evolved from Hole U1527C hard rock samples indicate s higher than ambient $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ contents that may have been produced b y mechanochemical sampling artifacts such as generation durin g RCB drilling and/or crushing rock samples prior to headspace sampling.  

Site U1527 is characterized by moderately to steeply dipping alteration boundaries, fractures, and faults in addition to shallowl y dipping shears and relatively few veins. Alteration boundaries ar e sharp and range in dip from $0^{\circ}$ to $74^{\circ}$ (average and median $=48^{\circ}$ ) an d demarcate the transition from Alteration Subtypes IIa to IIb. Fractures also dip moderately to steeply, ranging from $37^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ (averag e $=\ 68^{\circ},$ . The density of veins and fractures is low but increase s slightly downhole. Fractures almost always have a brown/orange alteration halo overprinting all other types of alteration, indicatin g late formation of fractures. The presence of brown/orange alteration along fractures and defining Alteration Subtype IIb may indicate the ingress of seawater through late-forming fractures. Fault s were observed only in Hole U1527C and dip steeply, ranging fro m $45^{\circ}$ to $83^{\circ}$ (average $=66^{\circ}$ ), and are most abundant in Igneous Subuni t 2c. All faults are discrete centimeter-scale zones with a normal sense of shear. Shallowly dipping shears are defined by elongate ribbons of white clays that may represent flattened and altered volcanic clasts. White ribbons wrapped around larger volcanic clasts ma y indicate some crystal-plastic deformation. The shallowly dippin g shears (average $=22^{\circ}$ ) are overprinted by higher-angle brittle faults. The overall lack of veins and indications of late fracturing sugges t that alteration is not structurally controlled and may instead be du e to pervasive flow.  

The two igneous units from Site U1527 have different natura l remanent magnetization (NRM) intensities before demagnetization; samples from Igneous Unit 1 show more intense NRM $(>\!0.5$ $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m})$ than those from Igneous Unit 2. However, the direction o f magnetization is consistent in both units, with an average inclination of $-59^{\circ}$ , which is very close to the inclination of a geomagneti c axial dipole (GAD) of $-60^{\circ}$ at the latitude of Brothers volcano. Thi s consistent GAD inclination suggests a coherent young age for thes e rocks, most certainly from the current normal polarity Brunhe s geomagnetic epoch. Igneous Unit 1 also has significantly large r magnetic coercivities than Igneous Unit 2. Thermal demagnetization experiments from Igneous Unit 2 show a more complex patter n compared to similar experiments from Igneous Unit 1, but coherently indicate magnetite or titanomagnetite as the main magneti c mineral in both igneous units. In addition, susceptibility measurements and isothermal remanence magnetization (IRM) experiments suggest comparable magnetite content in both units, with  a slight decrease in Igneous Subunits 2c and 2d.  

The fresh dacitic volcanics of Igneous Unit 1 show an invers e correlation between porosity and bulk density, but no such correlation is observed between $P$ -wave velocity and bulk density or $P_{-}$ - wave velocity and porosity. Variably altered volcaniclastic rocks i n Igneous Unit 2 display an inverse correlation between porosity an d bulk density and between porosity and $P$ -wave velocity. Mean bul k density $(2.2\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , porosity $(30\%)$ , and $P$ -wave velocity $\left(3330\mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ generally show small variations throughout Igneous Unit 2 and d o not appear to be affected by transitions between alteration types. Alteration Subtypes IIa and IIb are clearly identifiable in reflectanc e colorimetry data. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity sharply increases at the boundar y between Igneous Subunits 2b and $2c$ (velocities of ${\sim}4000$ and 420 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ on section halves and discrete samples, respectively), followe d by a downhole decrease in $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity to the bottom of Igneou s Subunit 2c. In Igneous Subunit 2C, this variation in $P$ -wave velocit y is reflected in a similar trend in bulk density and matching invers e variation in porosity, which appears to be associated with deformation and shear in this unit.  

Magnetic susceptibility measured on whole-round and sectionhalf cores is consistent with discrete measurements. Magnetic susceptibility in Igneous Subunits 2a and 2b is overall higher than tha t in Igneous Subunits 2c and 2d. Thermal conductivity values rang e from 1.09 to 2.35 W/(m·K) (average $=1.72\;\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K}])$ ; Igneous Uni t 2 has higher values than Igneous Unit 1. Thermal conductivity i n Igneous Unit 2 varies over smaller scales, reflecting changes in typ e and distribution of alteration minerals. Thermal conductivity value s are lower where alteration is dominated by the presence of waterrich clay minerals (e.g., low of $1.53\;\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K}]$ in Igneous Subunit 2 b at ${\sim}203.40\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ ), whereas the highest value of thermal conductivit y is observed along with increases in pyrite, silica, and magnetite concentrations in Igneous Subunit 2c. Hence, thermal conductivit y data reflect the heterogeneity of mineral compositions and alteration assemblages throughout the core.  

Five whole-round samples (each $9{-}19~\mathrm{cm}$ long) collected fro m hydrothermally altered, relatively hard materials in Hole U1527 C (Table T1) were processed and preserved as subsamples for shorebased biological investigations that will include quantification o f microbial and viral biomass, molecular analysis of the microbia l communities from extracted DNA and RNA, estimation of microbial metabolic activity and viral production, and cultivation of subseafloor  microbial components.  Quantification  of  th e contamination tracer perfluoromethyldecalin (PFMD) was conducted for the drilling fluid and the exterior and interior parts o f whole-round samples. PFMD was routinely detected, althoug h barely above detection levels, suggesting that penetration of drillin g fluids to the interior of whole-round samples was minimal.  

# Site U1528  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1528 (proposed Site UC-1A) is located inside a small ( $_{\sim40}$ m diameter at the top; ${\sim}25~\mathrm{m}$ diameter at the bottom) pit crater a t the summit of the Upper Cone of Brothers volcano at a water dept h of $1228\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F6). The primary objective at this site was to drill into the upflow zone of the Type II hydrothermal system that i s strongly influenced by magmatic degassing. In this area, discharg e of relatively gas-rich, very acidic fluids has resulted in advanced argillic alteration. Site U1528 addresses important Expedition 376 objectives related to the role of magmatically influenced hydrothermal fluids in transporting metals to the seafloor and provides a comparison of fluid-rock reactions with the Type I seawater-dominated hydrothermal system drilled at Sites U1527 and U1530.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in four holes at Site U1528. Hol e U1528A is located at $34^{\circ}52.9177^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.1070^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth o f $1228.4\:\mathrm{m}$ . We used the RCB system to core from the seafloor to 84. 4 mbsf and recovered $17.1\,\textrm{m}\,(20\%)$ . The downhole conditions encountered in Hole U1528A dictated the need to deploy a reentr y system to achieve our objectives.  

Hole U1528B is located $10~\mathrm{~m~}$ south of Hole U1528A a t $34^{\circ}52.9222^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.1077^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1229.4\mathrm{~m~}$ . Here, w e drilled-in 10.75 inch casing to 24.3 mbsf, with the drilling assembl y penetrating to 25.6 mbsf. We had trouble extracting the drilling assembly from the reentry system, which ultimately took several hours. Because of drilling-induced suspension of sediment in th e seawater, visibility was limited and we could see only the top of th e reentry funnel, observed to be at a water depth of $1224.8\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , consistent with it being properly set on the seafloor. After two separate, unsuccessful attempts to reenter Hole U1528B with both the RC B coring system and the CDEX turbine-driven coring system (TDCS), we suspended operations. Further visual observations showed th e reentry system was sitting at a slight angle, preventing the drill string from passing through the throat of the reentry funnel.  

Our next objective was to perform the first offshore test of th e TDCS. In Hole U1528C, located at $34^{\circ}52.9215^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.1128^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at  a water depth of $1229.1\;\mathrm{m},$ we drilled without coring using the TDC S to 22 mbsf, then cored to 53.5 mbsf, recovering $3.6\:\mathrm{m}\:(12\%)$ . Furthe r advancement was prevented by a broken core barrel that remaine d in the TDCS bottom-hole assembly (BHA), forcing abandonment o f Hole U1528C.  

In Hole U1528D, located at $34^{\circ}52.9219^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.1164^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in th e very limited flat central area of the pit crater and at a water depth o f $1228.1\ \mathrm{m}_{:}$ , we drilled-in 13.875 inch casing to $59.4~\mathrm{mbsf},$ with th e drilling assembly penetrating to 61.3 mbsf. We then RCB cored t o 359.3 mbsf and recovered $87.2\;\mathrm{m}\;(29\%)$ under good hole conditions. After the bit reached $40\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of rotation time, whereupon it would normally be changed before continuing to core, we instead decided t o take downhole temperature measurements and obtain borehol e fluid samples in the open hole through the existing bit.  

The Elevated Borehole Temperature Sensor (ETBS) tool was deployed first and recorded a maximum temperature of $35\mathrm{^\circC}$ at 35 7 mbsf, being $2~\mathrm{m}$ above the drilled bottom of the hole. The subsequent deployment of the $1000{\mathrm{-mL}}$ Kuster Flow-Through Sample r (FTS) tool ended with its failure under compression in the ope n hole. We then made an unsuccessful attempt to recover the too l with a fishing tool BHA equipped with boot-type junk baskets. Reentry into Hole U1528D was complicated by a plume emanatin g from the reentry funnel. We next deployed a logging BHA, lowere d the backup $600{\-}\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool on the core line, and successfully recovered a fluid sample from 279 mbsf. A subsequent ETB S downhole temperature measurement at the same depth recorded  a maximum temperature of $212{}^{\circ}C,$ , confirming that the flasked wireline high-temperature triple combo (HTTC) logging tool strin g (natural gamma ray, lithodensity, and temperature tools) could b e deployed. We successfully performed two upward logging passe s from 323 mbsf. Another deployment of the Kuster FTS tool then recovered a second borehole fluid sample from 313 mbsf; subsequen t deployment of the ETBS tool recorded a maximum temperature o f $165\mathrm{^\circC}$ . Next, we drilled down with a tricone bit BHA to clean ou t the hole to 356 mbsf—the depth of the top of the lost Kuster FT S tool.  

A concave mill bit, along with two boot-type junk baskets, wa s then deployed to attempt to remove the remaining parts of the los t Kuster FTS tool. After reentering Hole U1528D for the sixth time— despite very poor visibility around the reentry funnel—we advance d the mill bit to the bottom of the hole at 359.3 mbsf. Upon recovery, there was no evidence of the Kuster FTS tool in the boot baskets. The next fishing attempt used the reverse-circulation junk baske t (RCJB) assembled in conjunction with the boot-type junk baskets. After the seventh reentry of Hole U1528D, we worked the RCJ B BHA back to bottom $(359.3\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), where we circulated 25 barrels o f high-viscosity mud for ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{\min}$ while working the RCJB up an d down. When the end of the drill string cleared the rig floor, the discovery that the lowermost $172.8~\mathrm{~m~}$ was missing ended Hol e U1528D operations. The drill string failed in a piece of 5 inch pip e above the BHA. The recovered broken piece showed significan t damage directly attributable to the corrosive downhole environment.  

After completion of coring operations at Site U1531, we returned to Hole U1528D (about 3 weeks later) to conduct a series o f alternating downhole temperature measurements using both th e ETBS tool and Petrospec spool-in thermocouple memory too l (TCMT) as well as two Kuster FTS deployments that resulted in recovering a borehole fluid sample from 160 mbsf. Two successfu l temperature measurement runs recorded maximum values of $198^{\circ}C$ (ETBS) and $156^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (TCMT) at 160 mbsf. Site U1528 operations concluded with successful recovery of the failed Hole U1528B reentr y system at the end of Expedition 376. A total of $592.8\,\mathrm{h},$ or 24.7 days, were spent at Site U1528.  

# Principal results  

Rocks cored at Site U1528 are divided into three igneous unit s (Figure F11). Igneous Unit 1, recovered in Hole U1528A (0–6.0 3 mbsf) and Hole U1528C (26.50–31.41 mbsf), consists of polymic t lapilli tephra made up of subangular to subrounded volcanic clast s that have experienced varying degrees of alteration. Igneous Unit 2, recovered in Hole U1528A (16.30–83.57 mbsf), Hole U1528 C $(35.50{-}46.00\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ , and Hole U1528D (61.30–269.30 mbsf), is divided into three subunits based on internal rock fabric and the presence of primary minerals. Subunits 2a and 2c are composed o f sequences of altered lapillistone and lapilli-tuff, with subordinat e intervals of altered tuff and tuff-breccia. Clasts are volcanic in origi n and altered to differing degrees; the matrix consists of secondar y mineral assemblages. Identification of original lithologies become s increasingly difficult with depth (especially in Subunit 2c). More coherent, massive dacitic lavas, affected by a lesser degree of alteration, occur between 152.90 and 160.17 mbsf and make up Subuni t 2b. Igneous Unit 3, recovered exclusively in Hole U1528D (162.50– 269.03 mbsf), consists of altered dacite lava with some relatively unaltered intervals.  

The dacitic pyroclastic rocks and lavas at Site U1528 are pervasively altered, yet still show distinct similarities in petrography an d whole-rock geochemistry to fresh volcanics encountered in each Igneous Unit 1 at Sites U1527, U1529, and U1531 and to publishe d descriptions and geochemical results for unaltered dacite recovere d from elsewhere at Brothers volcano (e.g., Haase et al., 2006; Wrigh t and Gamble, 1999; Timm et al., 2012). Even though intervals wit h (partially) fresh phenocrysts are rare, primary igneous textures, such as vesicles, and the crystal shapes of plagioclase and (rarely ) pyroxene phenocrysts and microlites—now infilled and replaced b y secondary minerals—can be recognized in most samples. Petrography and the abundance of elements that are less affected by alteration suggest that the Site U1528 protolith was dacitic tephra an d lava similar to those previously encountered at Brothers volcano.  

Four distinct alteration types are observed in core material recovered from Site U1528 (Figure F12). Alteration Type I (0–35.7 6 mbsf), classified as slightly altered, occurs in unconsolidated gravels. The dominant alteration mineral assemblage consists of smectite with minor pyrite, opal-CT, natroalunite, pyrophyllite, an d native sulfur. Two distinct volcanic clast colors are observed: dar k gray clasts, which contain more smectite and light gray clasts. Native sulfur occurs in crystalline-tabular (orthorhombic) and globular grain morphologies.  

Alteration Type II (classified as highly altered) occurs in severa l intervals throughout Site U1528 (e.g., 148.1–150.5 mbsf) and i s characterized by an alteration mineral assemblage of illite, smectite, opal-CT, quartz, pyrite, and anhydrite. Alteration is typically bluegray in color, manifested by brecciation, and exhibits relict perliti c texture (Figure F13). Plagioclase phenocrysts are variably pseudomorphed by alunite and anhydrite, whereas pyroxene is pseudomorphed by anhydrite, smectite, and pyrite. The latter is abundan t (average $=\ 1{-}5\ \mathrm{\vol/6}$ ) and occurs not only in pyroxene pseudomorphs but also as subhedral to euhedral disseminated grains an d in  discrete  veins  associated  with  anhydrite.  Primary  titanomagnetite is rimmed and shows progressive replacement by pyrit e that exhibits skeletal texture and contains abundant anhydrite inclusions.  

Alteration Type III, classified as highly to intensely altered, is intercalated with Alteration Type II (e.g., 239.3–268.1 mbsf), and th e boundary between these alteration types can be either gradational or sharp. Alteration Type III is represented by pervasively altere d white-gray volcaniclastic rocks (Figure F13). A mineral assemblag e of natroalunite, pyrophyllite, and rutile, with lesser quartz, opal-CT, smectite, pyrite, and anhydrite, characterizes Alteration Type III. Alunite, pyrophyllite, and silica are more abundant in the matrix, whereas smectite is enriched in clast material. Plagioclase and pyroxene are completely pseudomorphed by alunite, anhydrite, an d pyrite. Late-stage anhydrite-pyrite veins commonly cut pseudomorphed plagioclase crystals. Titanomagnetite is almost completely replaced with leucoxene and pyrite. Vugs are infilled with anhydrit e and minor pyrite, native sulfur, alunite, and silica. In addition, finegrained pyrite is finely disseminated throughout matrix and clasts.  

Alteration Type IV is defined by discrete to diffuse white vein s that cut and postdate Alteration Types II and III. Alteration Type I V is first observed at 77.2 mbsf and occurs until the cored bottom o f Hole U1528D, at 355.1 mbsf. This alteration type is characterized b y an alteration assemblage of natroalunite, anhydrite, rutile, quartz, opal-CT, native sulfur, and pyrophyllite (Figure F13). Mineralogically, Alteration Type IV is distinguished from Alteration Types I I and III by higher abundances of native sulfur, silica, and rutile. Thi s alteration type occurs as discrete white veins and distinct alteratio n halos typically $<\!1\;\mathsf{c m}$ but occasionally as wide as $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ , commonl y with a vuggy texture, overprinting previous alteration and ofte n preserving earlier alteration textures. Pyrite is generally absent o r oxidized to iron oxyhydroxides within the halos, and native sulfur i s the major mineral phase infilling vugs.  

Fluid inclusions in the most recent vug and vein crystals of anhydrite, quartz, natroalunite, and gypsum indicate that the hydrothermal system at Site U1528 is highly dynamic. Two dominan t fluid types are variably involved in fluid-rock interactions (Figur e F14): a buoyant, hot $(220{-}360^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , sulfur-rich, and acidic hypersaline brine $(\mathrm{NaCl}>30~\mathrm{wt\%})$ and a hot, modified seawater. A massive influx of seawater $\mathrm{(NaCl}=3.2~\mathrm{wt\%)}$ locally overwhelmed th e hypersaline brine along fractures or pervasively diffused into th e hot formation, where it is heated to temperatures of $55{-}360^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Fluid inclusion salinities both higher and lower than seawater compositions, or the hypersaline brine, plot on the $\mathtt{N a C l}$ saturatio n curve and are attributed to depressurization in the formatio n caused by sudden fracturing events, resulting in phase separatio n (“boiling”). This process gives rise to a more saline, higher densit y fluid for both hypersaline brine and seawater and, at the same time, forms a low-density vapor phase that condenses through cooling t o a low-salinity aqueous solution under subcritical conditions (Figur e F14).  

Structures that occur across Holes U1528A, U1528C, an d U1528D include volcanic fabrics, alteration veins, and fractures. Volcanic fabrics are best observed in Holes U1528A and U1528 D and are defined by vesicles and plagioclase microlites (primary an d altered) and, to a lesser extent, phenocrysts. Volcanic fabrics hav e two forms, those in volcanic clasts and those in coherent lavas. Volcanic fabrics within clasts can be weak to strong, but each clast ha s a distinct orientation, suggesting brecciation after fabric formation. Fabrics over continuous intervals (i.e., lavas) have a similar orientation and tend to dip ${>}45^{\circ}$ . Peaks in volcanic fabric intensity are observed in Igneous Subunit 2b and Unit 3 in Hole U1528D.  

Alteration veins occur throughout Holes U1528A and U1528 D across all igneous units and alteration types. Veins are most commonly filled by anhydrite, pyrite, silica, and native sulfur. Veins ar e typically uniform but can be vuggy; some have halos. The presenc e of halos is the basis for Alteration Type IV. Vein density peaks between 100 and 190 mbsf, coincident with a peak in native sulfur an d vuggy veins and a deviation in borehole temperature. Vein dip varies from horizontal to vertical, with an average of ${\sim}60^{\circ}$ in both holes. The distribution of dips downhole is variable: a few zones have  a large range in dip (e.g., $0^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ})$ and other zones have dips ${\tt>}45^{\circ}$ . Vei n thickness ranges from 0.05 to $1~\mathrm{cm}$ and averages ${\sim}0.2\ \mathrm{cm}$ . Vei n thickness is variable downhole, but it appears to increase in intervals with a large range of vein dip, and thicker veins tend to hav e steeper dips.  

Fractures were observed in all three holes, but their abundanc e is limited. Fractures in Hole U1528C are irregular and lined with native sulfur. Native sulfur is more abundant where the fractures ar e irregular. In Hole U1528D, fractures are typically clustered in th e uppermost $175\,\mathrm{m}$ of the hole and have steeper dips (i.e., ${>}60^{\circ}$ ). Fracture density has three peaks; the one near 290 mbsf coincides with  a deviation in borehole temperature and a large range in vein dip.  

Considering that Y is relatively mobile under hydrothermal conditions in contrast to $Z\mathbf{r},$ the $\mathrm{Y/Zr}$ value of altered volcaniclastics i s used as a tracer for the extent of alteration. Two main intervals ar e characterized by lower $\mathrm{Y/Zr}$ values (i.e., relative to unaltered dacit e from Brothers volcano): (1) 46–95.5 mbsf in Igneous Subunit 2a, dominated by Alteration Type III, and (2) 240–325 mbsf overlapping Igneous Subunit 2c and Unit 3, as well as associated alternatin g Alteration Types II and III. Variable extents of depletion in alkali s (K, Rb, and Na), Mg, Ca, and Fe, as well as strong enrichment in total sulfur (as much as $15~\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) occur throughout the hole (Figur e F15). Based on average compositions of discrete intervals throughout the entire $360\,\mathrm{m}$ section at Hole U1528D, we estimate that $>\!75\%$ of both Mn and Mg have been lost due to hydrothermal alteration. Other significantly depleted elements include Na, K, and Rb $550\%$ loss of each element) as well as $\mathrm{Ca}$ and $\mathrm{P}$ $530\%$ loss of each element). Total S concentrations vary between 2.1 and $15.1\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , due t o the formation of S-dominated secondary minerals (e.g., alunite, native S, pyrite, and anhydrite), although anhydrite appears to represent a minor component of the total S inventory. Iron appears to b e strongly depleted in late-stage Alteration Type IV, suggesting tha t pH, $f\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , and $\ensuremath{\beta}_{2}$ conditions changed substantially from Alteratio n Types II/III, leading to extensive loss of Fe in possibly $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ -rich bu t $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ -poor hydrothermal fluids. Similar to Site U1527, organic carbon comprises the bulk of measured total carbon concentration s but remains very low, yielding an average of ${\sim}250~\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ at Sit e U1528.  

One sample of interstitial water (376-U1528C-7N-1, 140–15 0 cm) recovered from 45.9 mbsf has a low $\mathsf{p H}$ value of 4.1, consisten t with the presence of acidic magmatic fluids. Nearby equimolar enrichments in Ca and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ suggest that dissolution of anhydrite at lo w temperatures may be occurring in the pore waters.  

Three borehole fluid samples were collected from Hole U1528 D using the Kuster FTS tool at ${\sim}279$ and ${\sim}313$ mbsf and then 23 day s later at 160 mbsf. Maximum estimated temperatures of $212^{\circ}$ an d $247^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for the first two samples and $140^{\circ}C$ for the later sample wer e determined by downhole logging. The fluids have nearly identical Cl, Br, and $\mathrm{Mg}$ contents and Na concentrations all lower than seawater. Highly elevated $\Sigma{\cal S}{\cal O}_{4}$ and very acidic $\mathsf{p H}$ values (as low a s 1.8) are characteristic of acid-sulfate fluid. This fluid may either represent unaltered seawater mixing with the vapor phase of a phaseseparated, seawater-derived parent fluid $\left(\mathrm{Cl}_{\mathrm{fluid}}<\mathrm{Cl}_{\mathrm{seawater}}\right)$ , direct input from a low-salinity magmatic volatile-derived fluid, and/or  a mixture of fluids derived from both origins. Elevated Si and K contents in the fluids are due to the likely dissolution of Si- and K-bearing minerals in the presence of highly acidic fluids.  

Gas headspace components including $\mathrm{H}_{2},\mathrm{CO}_{2},$ and acid-volatil e S are elevated over ambient atmospheric levels. These gas anomalies may derive from subseafloor hydrothermal input of volatile-ric h fluids that share similar chemical properties with the seafloor hydrothermal fluids discharging at the Upper and Lower Cone sites.  

Eighty-three archive-half sections were measured for NRM an d underwent alternating field (AF) demagnetization experiments using the cryogenic magnetometer. The sections show generally lo w NRM intensities where the largest pieces have primary magnetization components, after AF steps of $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ , with negative inclination s suggesting normal polarities. AF and thermal demagnetization experiments on 82 discrete samples from Igneous Units 2 and 3 wer e also carried out. The drilling-induced overprint is generally removed after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization on the discrete samples, leaving, in most cases, a stable primary magnetization. The two igneous units have very low NRM intensities in agreement with th e observations from the cryogenic magnetometer. Both units show  a consistent direction of magnetization with average inclination compatible with the inclination of a GAD of $-55^{\circ}$ , the present-day latitude of Brothers volcano. This consistent GAD inclination suggest s a coherent young age for these rocks, most certainly during the current normal polarity Brunhes geomagnetic epoch. Thermal demagnetization experiments from these units show a complex pattern, suggesting irreversible transformation of magnetic minerals durin g heating to ${>}400^{\circ}\mathrm{C};$ this transformation is confirmed by changes i n the magnetic susceptibilities measured with the Agico Kappabridg e susceptibility meter before and after heating. In addition, IRM experiments suggest that these rocks contain minerals with large magnetic  coercivities,  such  as  titanohematite,  in  addition  t o titanomagnetite.  

Physical properties measurements for Igneous Unit 1 (Alteration Type I) are consistent with the ranges expected for fresh unconsolidated dacitic volcaniclastics. In Igneous Units 2 and 3, mor e complex variations in physical properties associated with igneou s unit and/or alteration type are observed. For example, magneti c susceptibility values are generally higher in intervals of Alteratio n Type II than Type III (Figure F12), which may be explained by th e observed partial replacement of titanomagnetite by rutile and pyrit e in the relatively more altered rocks of Alteration Type III. Downhol e measurements also indicate an association between Alteration Typ e II and increases in natural gamma radiation (NGR) attributed t o $^{40}\mathrm{K};$ however, this association could not be confirmed by NGR measurements in the laboratory due to the fragmented core materia l that was recovered. The relatively high $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ NGR signal identified i n a core from Alteration Type II (Section 376-U1528D-48R-1) is consistent with this observation.  

The boundary between Igneous Units 2 and 3 is clearly define d by changes in grain density, bulk density, porosity, $P$ -wave velocity, and thermal conductivity as well as by an increase in magnetic susceptibility associated with the concurrent transition from Alteration Type III to Type II. By contrast, boundaries between igneou s subunits within Igneous Unit 2 are clearly defined by variations i n physical properties. An interval of relatively lower bulk density an d $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity and higher porosity is observed between ${\sim}145$ an d ${\sim}220$ mbsf, but it is not associated with a defined igneous subunit o r alteration type boundary. Instead, this interval corresponds to th e depth at which $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ gas was smelled during core splitting, and it s boundaries correspond to a borehole temperature anomaly and increased fracture densities, vein thicknesses, and range of vein dip.  

A series of downhole measurements was conducted and borehole fluid was sampled at the end of Hole U1528D coring operations. Three runs of the ETBS memory tool were completed in Hol e U1258D. The first deployment, made prior to logging to help determine which logging tools could be deployed, measured an averag e temperature of $33^{\circ}C$ at 357 mbsf. After we collected borehole flui d samples using the Kuster FTS tool at 279 and 313 mbsf, two othe r temperature measurements were made at these same depths, recording temperatures of $212{}^{\circ}C$ and $165\mathrm{^\circC_{1}}$ , respectively, with the latter affected by circulation of cold seawater in the borehole prior t o the measurement.  

A high-temperature flasked wireline logging string consisting o f lithodensity, NGR, and logging head temperature tools was run t o 332 mbsf in Hole U1528D. Variations in the total natural gamma ra y measurements are mostly related to peaks in potassium, generall y correlated to Alteration Type II, which is rich in illite. Overall, th e downhole density log correlates well with bulk density measured o n the core samples and shows different trends that are generally correlated with igneous units and subunits: (1) from 65 to 145 mbsf (Igneous Subunit 2a), density gradually decreases downhole; (2) fro m 145 to $250~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , there is a sharp decrease in density (between 14 0 and 155 mbsf; Igneous Subunit 2b) followed by a gradual increas e with depth (Igneous Subunit 2c); and (3) from 250 to $330\;\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , th e density is very variable (Igneous Unit 3). Downhole caliper measurements revealed three zones of washouts where the borehole diameter exceeded $33.0~\mathsf{c m}$ and reached up to $43.2~\mathrm{cm}$ (17 inches): 149–162, 195–210, and 297–324 mbsf. The median diameter wa s determined at $28.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ (11.2 inches), only slightly exceeding the drill bit diameter of $25.1~\mathrm{cm}$ (9.875 inches). Two bridges were encountered on top $(292\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ and at the bottom $(323\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ of the deepes t washout interval while lowering the logging tool string.  

The three temperature profiles acquired during wireline loggin g suggest a convective temperature regime with small temperature increases at $\mathord{\sim}100$ and 150 mbsf and larger increases at ${\sim}275$ and 29 5 mbsf. A temperature reversal (i.e., a decrease in temperature wit h depth) was observed at ${\sim}250{-}260~\mathrm{mbsf}.$ Over the $2.5~\mathrm{h}$ of logging, the temperature increased by about ${}^{8\subset}$ in the isothermal zones an d by $24.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ between 270 and 310 mbsf, reaching $247^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This increas e suggests that the downhole temperatures had not yet reached equilibrium. The temperature anomalies at $\mathord{\sim}150$ and ${\sim}295$ mbsf are accompanied by increases in borehole diameter, peaks in potassium, the first instance of sulfur odor emanating from the cores, nativ e sulfur observed in veins, high fracture density with varied fractur e dips, crosscutting fractures, and increased vein density. These zone s are interpreted to be structurally controlled permeable intervals.  

A total of 3, 1, and 13 whole-round samples $(3{-}16\,\mathrm{cm}\,\mathrm{long})$ wer e collected from Holes U1528A, U1528C, and U1528D, respectively, for microbiological analyses (Table T1). Lithologies sampled represented the various igneous units recovered. Samples were processe d for shore-based DNA and RNA analyses, cell and viral counting, and viral and microbial activity measurements. All samples wer e analyzed onboard for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration; two samples gave positive values. The other samples containe d compounds that inhibited the enzyme luciferase used for the AT P test. Nutrient addition bioassays with inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, or organic carbon, were initiated to determine the nutritional constraints on biomass in this environment. PFMD was use d for contamination testing. PFMD was usually detected on the outside of uncleaned cores and, on rare occasions, was above detectio n levels on the cleaned outside of cores. However, it was usually belo w detection on the inside of cores, indicating that penetration of drilling fluid to the interior of whole-round drill cores (where we collected samples) is unlikely.  

# Site U1529  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1529 (proposed Site WC-1A) is located on the wester n side of the caldera floor of Brothers volcano at a water depth of 176 5 m (Figure F6). The primary objective for this site was to drill a second hole (the first was at Site U1527) into the margin of the upflo w zone of a hydrothermal system dominated by modified seawater-derived fluids. This site was planned to penetrate deeper into the hydrothermal system and obtain a record of the recent eruptiv e history in the caldera.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1529. Hol e U1529A is located at $34^{\circ}52.5161^{\prime}\mathrm{S},179^{\circ}3.5139^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth o f  

$1735.0\;\mathrm{m}$ . We used the RCB system to core from the seafloor to 12. 0 mbsf, with poor recovery of $1.86\;\mathrm{m}\;(16\%)$ . The downhole condition s encountered in Hole U1529A were extremely difficult because o f the unconsolidated volcaniclastic material, which caused hig h torque and tight hole conditions that ended drilling of this hole. I n Hole U1529B, located at $34^{\circ}52.5217^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.5207^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a wate r depth of $1733.0\mathrm{~m~}$ , RCB coring under similar difficult hole conditions penetrated to only 34.4 mbsf, with very poor recovery of $_{0.6\;\mathrm{m}}$ $(1.7\%)$ . After observing a tight hole, we attempted to work the dril l string back to ${\sim}15$ mbsf but lost circulation because the bit and jet s were plugged off with volcaniclastic material. This loss of circulation resulted in abandonment of Hole U1529B. An $8.2\;\mathrm{m}$ long ghos t core was recovered from the core barrel that was in place whil e working the drill string out of the hole. A total of $44.0\,\mathrm{h},$ or 1.8 days, were recorded while at Site U1529.  

# Principal results  

A single igneous unit was recovered in Hole U1529A (0–2.5 2 mbsf) and in Hole U1529B $(0{-}24.82\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ . Igneous Unit 1 consist s of decimeter-thick, alternating intervals of fresh, black plagioclasepyroxene phyric dacite lavas and unconsolidated, black monomic t lapilli tephra (Figure F16). The contacts between the lavas and th e tephra were not recovered. The moderately vesicular $(\sim\!10\ \mathrm{vol}\%)$ lava was recovered as individual pieces $0.5{-}6\;\mathrm{cm}$ in length. The lav a has a hypohyaline texture with groundmass rich in flow-aligned plagioclase microlites and shows fine fracture networks indicative o f incipient breakup. The lapilli tephra consists of fine-ash- to medium-lapilli-sized angular to subangular fragments of dacite lavas, as well as fragments of plagioclase and pyroxene crystals. The fines t grain size fraction contains $85\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ of angular vitric ash, resemblin g the larger lapilli clasts and fragments of dacite lava recovered at Sit e U1527.  

The ghost core from Hole U1529B, which contains materia l from anywhere between 0 and $34.4~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , similarly consists of unconsolidated fresh, black volcanic lapilli-ash ranging in size fro m ash to medium lapilli. Maximum clast sizes are very large pebbles. Ash- and lapilli-sized clasts are subangular and angular with a vesicularity and mineral assemblage (plagioclase-clinopyroxene phenocrysts and glomerocrysts) consistent with the lapilli tephra, being  a mixture of Igneous Unit 1 volcanic rocks.  

The volcanic rocks of Igneous Unit 1 appear fresh to slightly altered. Alteration Type I is the only alteration type recognized at thi s site and occurs within the lapilli tephra and coarser fragments o f dacitic lava. The alteration type is defined by the presence of mino r smectite and iron oxyhydroxide replacing phenocrysts and groundmass and lining some vesicles. A few individual clasts in Igneou s Unit 1 are more strongly altered and contain microcrystalline silica, iron oxyhydroxide, and a green clay mineral.  

Unaltered to slightly altered clasts and lapilli from Igneous Uni t 1 are typical dacites, with $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$ ranging from $62.3{-}65.4~\mathrm{wt}\%$ an d $\mathrm{Na_{2}O+K_{2}O}$ varying from $6.61{-}7.07\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . These dacites are simila r in major element composition to fresh dacites from Site U1527 an d consistent with the small compositional range previously reporte d for dacites at Brothers volcano (e.g., Haase et al., 2006; Wright an d Gamble, 1999; Timm et al., 2012).  

The uppermost sample (0.06 mbsf) from Hole U1529A and tw o samples from the ghost core have lower values of total carbon $^{<200}$ $\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g})$ compared to the other five samples from this hole, for whic h total carbon ranges from 221 to $344~\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ . Total sulfur concentrations are less than $220\;\upmu\mathrm{g}/\upvarepsilon,$ , consistent with total sulfur abundance s previously reported from Brothers volcano. Total nitrogen and tota l inorganic carbon are below the limit of detection in all Site U152 9 samples.  

At Site U1529, no meaningful structural measurements could b e made because no pieces of oriented core were recovered. Som e pieces of dacite have a network of microfractures, but there are n o faults or alteration veins present. In both Holes U1529A an d U1529B, the main structure observed is a shape-preferred orientation defined macroscopically by vesicles and microscopically by vesicles, phenocrysts, and microlites.  

No paleomagnetic measurements were performed on the samples from Site U1529 because of the absence of any oriented cor e pieces. Moreover, the low recovery and the fragmented nature o f the clasts and volcaniclastic sediments made the cores mostly unsuitable  for  continuous  physical  properties  measurements  o n whole-round and section-half cores. However, NGR measurement s for Hole U1529A recorded values of ${\sim}13$ cps (1.9 mbsf), and section-half multisensor logger point data indicated magnetic susceptibilities as high as ${\sim}2250\times10^{-5}$ IU (15.14 mbsf).  

A total of five discrete samples from Hole U1529A and thre e samples from Hole U1529B, including cut clasts and volcaniclastics, were analyzed for moisture and density. Bulk density values rang e from 1.92 to $2.37\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , whereas grain density has a range of 2.43 t o $2.50~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ . Porosity varies from $6{-}38\ \mathrm{vol}\%$ and is inversely correlated with bulk density. Three measurements of $P_{\|}$ -wave velocit y made in the $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}^{\prime}$ -direction on coherent clasts in section halves of Hol e U1529A vary from ${\sim}3500$ to $4500~\mathrm{m/s}$ . No thermal conductivit y measurements were made because of the limited recovery and fragmented nature of the material.  

No samples were collected from Site U1529 for microbiologica l analyses because of the nature of the material recovered.  

# Site U1530  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1530 (proposed Site NWC-3A) is located on a narro w bench on the NW Caldera site of Brothers volcano at a water dept h of $1595\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F6). The primary objective at this site was to drill through the lower part of the Type I hydrothermal system. Sit e U1530 is located ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Site U1527 on a ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ long by ${\sim}10$ m wide bench toward the upper part of the NW Caldera wall. It i s situated structurally above a known prominent metal-rich stockwork zone. The operations plan at Site U1530 was to penetrate ${\sim}450$ m through the upper stockwork and then into deeper portions o f the inferred hydrothermal upflow zone and continue through  a thicker stratigraphic section of lavas in the caldera, hoping to intersect the footwall of the original caldera. Intersection of the stockwork was expected to provide the best opportunity to investigat e the transport of metals through the Brothers hydrothermal system.  

# Operations  

Operations were conducted in one hole at Site U1530. Hol e U1530A is located at $34^{\circ}51.6588^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}3.4572^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth o f $1594.9\mathrm{~m~}$ . We used the RCB system to core from the seafloor t o 453.1 mbsf and recovered $76.8\mathrm{~m~}(17\%)$ . We encountered optimu m downhole conditions throughout coring. After successfully penetrating to target depth, we decided to terminate coring in Hol e U1530A to take advantage of the good hole conditions for downhol e measurements and fluid sampling. Hence, we released the bit in th e bottom of the hole by deploying the rotary shifting tool.  

Our downhole measurement plan for Hole U1530A consisted o f running (1) the ETBS tool, (2) the Kuster FTS tool, (3) the tripl e combination logging tool string (“triple combo”—natural gamm a ray, porosity, and density sondes, including magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, caliper, and logging head temperature), (4) the Formatio n MicroScanner (FMS)-Sonic logging tool string, and (5) the Petrospec spool-in TCMT. After recording a temperature of $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at th e bottom of the hole (stationary measurement time of $15~\mathrm{min}$ ) wit h the ETBS, we lowered the Kuster FTS tool on the core line to  a depth of ${\sim}433$ mbsf but did not recover a fluid sample because th e valves failed to close completely. We then raised the end of dril l string to a logging depth of 67.1 mbsf, lowered the triple combo tool string into the hole, and performed a calibration pass and a full logging run from the fill at 442 mbsf to the seafloor. This run was followed by two logging passes with the FMS-Sonic tool string fro m 442 mbsf to just below the end of the pipe at 51.8 mbsf. We the n lowered the end of the drill string to 416.2 mbsf and obtained  a borehole fluid sample with the Kuster FTS. Finally, the third-part y TCMT was deployed on the wireline and, with the temperaturesensitive TCMT data logger kept inside the drill string, the tw o thermocouple joints were lowered $8\;\mathrm{m}$ past the end of the drill pip e and held at 447 mbsf for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . This first test of the newly designe d high-temperature TCMT recorded a temperature of $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This tes t completed our operations at Site U1530. A total of $184.0~\mathrm{h}$ , or 7. 7 days, were spent at Site U1530.  

# Principal results  

Five igneous units were identified at Site U1530 (Figure F17). Igneous Unit 1 $(0{-}26.62\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ consists of clast-supported polymic t lapillistone with occasional blocks and bombs. Clasts are volcanic i n origin and reside in a matrix of altered, smaller volcanic fragment s and secondary minerals. Igneous Unit 2 (30.70–59.62 mbsf) consists of a sequence of altered tuffaceous mudstone, siltstone, an d sandstone, with one subordinate horizon of polymict lapillistone, and is divided into five subunits (2a–2e), based on color, grain size, and internal structures. Igneous Unit 2 displays various sedimentary textures including normal and reverse grading as well as horizontal, wavy, lenticular, and inclined bedding, indicating transport, depositional, and soft-sediment deformation events. Igneous Unit  3 (59.62–64.40 mbsf) consists of altered plagioclase phyric lava wit h pseudomorphs after glomerocrystic plagioclase. Igneous Unit  4 (64.40–218.21 mbsf) is a sequence of highly altered volcaniclasti c rocks with discernible monomict and polymict lapillistone an d monomict lapilli-tuff in the upper half that consists of altered volcanic clasts in a fine-grained, completely altered matrix. Significantl y pronounced alteration hinders detailed classification in the lowe r half of Unit 4. Igneous Unit 5 (222.70–448.68 mbsf) consists o f highly altered volcanic rocks with five discrete horizons of less altered plagioclase phyric lava containing pseudomorphs after glomerocrystic plagioclase.  

Despite the pervasive alteration, the volcanic and volcaniclasti c rocks retain residual volcanic textures and original compositions o f alteration-resistant elements and ratios $\mathrm{(Ti,~Zr,~Ti/Zr)}$ , suggestin g that the protolith was a typical Brothers dacite. Similar to volcaniclastic rocks of Igneous Unit 2 of Hole U1527C, Hole U1530A rock s appear to have the same systematically lower $\mathrm{Ti}/\mathrm{Zr}$ value $({\sim}27)$ compared to volcanic rocks of Sites U1528 and U1529, where th e $\mathrm{Ti/Zr}$ value is ${\sim}36$ . Although this disparity is small compared to th e overall range observed in Kermadec arc lavas (i.e., $\mathrm{Ti}/\mathrm{Zr}$ as high a s 220), it points toward slight genetic variability among the Brother s dacitic magma series.  

Five distinct alteration types were identified based on alteratio n mineral assemblage in core material recovered from Hole U1530 A (Figure F18). All alteration types occur at various intervals downhole, overprinting each other, and therefore cannot be assigned t o certain depth intervals.  

Alteration Type I, classified as highly to intensely altered, has a n alteration mineral assemblage of opal-CT, smectite, pyrite, anhydrite, sphalerite, and barite, with minor quartz, chlorite, and illit e (Figure F19A). A network of anhydrite-barite veins with fine- t o medium-grained sphalerite cuts blue-gray lapillistone. The clast s are variably altered/silicified, and the contacts between clasts an d matrix are distinct. Anhydrite is most abundant in veins and onl y rarely infills vugs within clasts. In one sample, an acicular mineral, most likely natroalunite, is observed microscopically cutting anhydrite-pyrite-silica veins but was not detected by $\mathrm{\DeltaX}$ -ray diffractio n (XRD) analysis.  

Alteration Type II, classified as intensely altered, has a characteristic green-gray color and an alteration mineral assemblage o f quartz, illite, and chlorite, with variable amounts of anhydrite, pyrite, and smectite (Figure F19B). Alteration Type II is associate d with three distinct lithologies throughout the hole: tuffaceous finegrained sediments, coherent lava, and pyroclastic rocks. The abundance of individual alteration minerals varies with lithology. For example, pyrite is more abundant in fine-grained sediments compare d to pyroclastic rocks. The fine-grained tuffaceous sediment interval (Igneous Unit 2) is frequently cut by coarse-grained vuggy anhydrit e veins. The altered lava unit exhibits a vuggy texture, the vugs fille d with quartz, anhydrite, and minor pyrite. Chlorite and illite are intergrown with microcrystalline quartz, forming a homogeneou s matrix. The upper volcaniclastic interval (Igneous Unit 1) is characterized by subangular clasts that are visually distinguishable fro m matrix material. Clasts are rich in chlorite and illite relative to th e silica- and pyrite-rich matrix. Plagioclase is completely pseudomorphed by chlorite, quartz, and occasionally smectite.  

Alteration Type III, classified as intensely altered, is characterized by an alteration mineral assemblage of quartz and illite, wit h minor smectite, anhydrite, and chlorite. It is divided into two Subtypes IIIa and IIIb based on relative abundances of anhydrite (enriched in Subtype IIIa) and chlorite (enriched in Subtype IIIb), respectively. Alteration Subtype IIIa is white-gray and consists o f well-defined pyroclastic texture with soft illite-rich clasts within  a silica- and pyrite-rich matrix (Figure F19C). Alteration Subtype III b is blue-gray, and both matrix and clasts are intensely silicified (Figure F19D). Pyrite occurs as a minor phase disseminated throughout. Iron oxyhydroxide is likely derived from pyrite oxidization. Magnetite is an accessory phase and is frequently partially resorbe d and overprinted by pyrite.  

Alteration Type IV, classified as intensely altered, is light gra y and has a mineral assemblage of pyrophyllite, quartz, illite, an d smectite, with minor pyrite and rutile (Figure F19E). Clasts ar e poorly defined and strongly resorbed. Pyrophyllite is patchy and intergrown with illite and disseminated fine-grained anhydrite an d likely represents the core of relict clasts. Quartz is intergrown wit h illite and forms discrete veins associated with subhedral pyrite. Common leucoxene and minor rutile form ${<}0.1\ \mathrm{mm}$ grains and ar e variably overprinted by pyrite.  

Alteration Type V exhibits a buff color and occurs as two distinct subtextures: fine-grained homogeneous material and coarsegrained equigranular material with a mottled texture (Figure F19F) . Both subtextures exhibit the same alteration mineral assemblage o f diaspore, quartz, pyrophyllite, smectite, and rutile, with minor illite, pyrite, and anhydrite. Iron oxyhydroxide staining is well develope d throughout this alteration type, and pyrite is absent in some samples. Vugs are abundant and commonly infilled with chalcedony an d anhydrite, with the latter filling the core of the vug. Anhydrite occurs in two distinct generations, coarse euhedral grains that infil l vugs and veins and a fine-grained subhedral to euhedral form intergrown within the matrix. Rutile occurs in traces, mantled or overprinted by pyrite.  

Unlike Hole U1528D, most veins in Hole U1530A are seale d with anhydrite $^+$ sulfides $^+$ quartz with only a few vugs partly fille d by drusy quartz or anhydrite that may record the latest fluid compositions and temperatures. All fluid inclusions are two-phase and homogenize to the liquid phase at $209^{\circ}$ to $390^{\circ}{C}$ , except for one (at 40 6 mbsf) that exhibits critical point behavior at $345\mathrm{^\circC}$ . The highest homogenization temperatures are measured in Alteration Types $\mathrm{V}$ (key minerals: pyrophyllite $^+$ diaspore) and II (key minerals: illite $^+$ chlorite). By contrast, the lowest median temperature of $255^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ wa s determined at 291 mbsf. The salinities of fluid inclusions plot int o two separate regions: at or near seawater compositions and as  a hypersaline brine at or along the $\mathrm{NaCl}$ saturation curve (Figur e F20). Only Alteration Types II and V can be associated with hypersaline brines. The fluid inclusion data are consistent with three different fluids being responsible for the alteration assemblages:  a pervasive fluid of modified-seawater composition that has bee n heated to ${\sim}390^{\circ}C_{\mathrm{{:}}}$ , a fluid that has condensed from NaCl vapo r within the supercritical region, and a hypersaline brine with temperatures of $288^{\circ}$ to $390^{\circ}C$ (Figure F20).  

Structures in Hole U1530A consist of volcanic fabrics, alteratio n veins, fractures, and sedimentary boundaries. Sedimentary boundaries, defined by changes in grain size and/or texture, are all subhorizontal $(<\!10^{\circ})$ . Volcanic fabrics are in two forms: within volcani c clasts or within coherent lava. In both forms, the fabric is defined b y vesicles and plagioclase microlites. Volcanic fabrics within volcani c clasts can be weak to strong but do not share a common orientatio n across clasts. This type of fabric is observed in the top half of Hol e U1530A in lapilli tuffs defining Igneous Units 1 and 4. Moderate t o strong volcanic fabrics that occur over decimeters define Igneou s Units 3 and 5, which consist of lavas. Volcanic fabrics within the lavas tend to be moderate to steep, with dips ${\sim}45^{\circ}$ .  

Alteration veins occur throughout the hole and are typicall y filled with anhydrite, silica, and/or pyrite. Vein density is variabl e downhole, with the highest density related to the presence of network veins, typically filled with pyrite or silica. The largest abundance in network veins is at the very top of the hole, from 0 to 2 5 mbsf. Discrete veins are most abundant at ${\sim}70$ and ${\sim}270$ mbsf. These depths also correspond to a large range in vein dip $(0^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ})$ , an increase in vein thickness and, at ${\sim}270\,\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ a deviation in borehole temperature. These depth intervals are also related to change s in igneous rock type between sedimentary and lavas above lapill i tuffs at ${\sim}70$ mbsf and a change from lapilli tuff to lava at ${\sim}270$ mbsf. The presence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks, large range in vei n dip and thickness, and a deviation in borehole temperature may indicate the presence of lateral flow zones related to permeability contrasts. Fractures are less abundant compared to veins but are mor e common than at any other site. Fractures have a large range in di p and are more frequent at ${\sim}55$ and ${\sim}255$ mbsf, coincident with zone s of more abundant veins. Slickenlines were identified from $\mathord{\sim}190$ t o 290 mbsf and typically have steep rake and a normal sense of shear. All hard rock samples from Site U1530 have been affected b y various degrees of hydrothermal alteration. Altered volcaniclasti c materials and lavas show strong geochemical changes for a larg e  

range of elements, with major loss of Mn, Ca, and Na (Figure F21). The observed downhole variations of major oxide and trace elements are much more pronounced at Site U1530 compared wit h  

Site U1527, including the extensive loss of $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ relative to unaltered dacites recovered at Sites U1527 and U1529. Other alkali elements, such as potassium $\left(\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}\right)$ and rubidium (Rb), as well as th e alkaline-earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba), show both depletion s and enrichments relative to fresh dacites. The strongest geochemical shifts in Hole U1530A occur between 189 and 191 mbsf, with  a decrease in $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , Rb, Ba, Y, and ${\mathrm{Cu}}$ concentrations, which corresponds to the transition to Alteration Type V, (i.e., the first appearance of pyrophyllite and decreasing abundance of illite). Alteratio n Types IV and V in Igneous Unit 5 form two important end-members and display the strongest depletions in Mg, Ba, Sr, Fe, Cu, an d Zn. The reverse pattern is seen in Alteration Type I in Igneous Uni t 1, suggesting that some of the loss of elements observed at the bottom of the hole may be, in part, balanced by a gain of these element s in the upper part of the hole. Depletions in Ca are associated wit h higher Sr concentrations and the identification of anhydrite b y XRD, suggesting that the abundance of Ca is mainly controlled b y the occurrence of anhydrite. Principally hosted in barite, Ba at Sit e U1530 ranges from trace levels of ${\sim}20~\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ in Alteration Types I V and V to very high abundances of $\leq3.4\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in Alteration Type I.  A pronounced correlation is observed between total S and Fe concentrations throughout Hole U1530A, suggesting that pyrite represent s the primary host of sulfur in the rock (predominantly in Igneou s Units 1, 2, and 4). Significant enrichments in Zn $(\le\!5.2\,\mathrm{\wt\%})$ , C u $(\leq\!1760\;\upmu\mathrm{g/g)}$ , As $(\le\!660~\upmu\mathrm{g/g)}$ , Pb $(\leq\!100~\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g})$ , and Mo $(\le\!560~\upmu\mathrm{g/g)}$ were also recorded in pyrite-rich intervals, consistent with hightemperature hydrothermal fluid contributions.  

Total carbon (TC) abundances in the majority of Hole U1530 A samples are ${<}200\;\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g}$ and are overall lower than TC abundances a t Sites U1527, U1528, and U1529. An average total sulfur (TS) concentration at Site U1530 of $5.1\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ is similar to the $5.9\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ averag e at Site U1528. In contrast to Site U1528, however, TS concentrations decrease with depth from ${\sim}11\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ to ${\sim}3.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ on average.  

Headspace dissolved gases, including $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , CO, ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4}.$ , $\mathrm{C}_{2}\mathrm{H}_{6},$ , $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}{S}.$ , were analyzed from several intervals of the recovere d cores in Hole U1530A. As reported at Sites U1527, U1528, an d U1529, headspace dissolved $C_{2}\mathsf{H}_{6}$ concentrations were below detection limit $(<\!0.03\ensuremath{~\upmu\mathrm{M}})$ for all depths of Hole U1530A. Five interval s with elevated $\mathrm{H}_{2},\,\mathrm{CH}_{4},\,\mathrm{CO}_{2},$ and acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) concentrations were detected. Maximum pore-fluid AVS and $\Sigma{\bf C}{\bf O}_{2}$ concentrations  of  1.6  and $37~\mathrm{~mM}_{\mathrm{{r}}}$ ,  respectively,  are  similar  i n concentration to those previously determined by de Ronde et al. (2011) for actively venting chimneys of the NW Caldera vent fiel d and may originate from fluids rich in magmatic volatiles.  

A fluid sample was collected with the Kuster FTS tool at 43 5 mbsf. The in situ fluid temperature was estimated to be ${\sqrt{38^{\circ}C}}$ base d on downhole temperature logging. The borehole fluid sample i s slightly acidic relative to seawater, with a pH of 6.8, and is characterized by the same major and minor species composition (i.e., dissolved Na, K, Ca, Sr, Mg, Cl, Br, and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ ) as drilling fluid (surfac e seawater) within analytical error. Dissolved $\Sigma\mathsf{H}_{2}S$ is below detection. The abundances of several metal species are highly elevate d above seawater values and are likely derived from contamination b y the steel bit and drill string or the Kuster FTS itself.  

NRM of 81 archive-half sections from Hole U1530A was measured using the cryogenic superconducting rock magnetometer. The overprint magnetization from drilling and coring was reduce d by using the inline AF demagnetizer. Detailed measurements o f anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), AF and thermal demagnetization, and IRM experiments on 65 discrete oriented samples were also conducted (four from Igneous Unit 1, five fro m  

Igneous Unit 2, two from Igneous Unit 3, twenty-four from Igneou s Unit 4, and thirty from Igneous Unit 5). Magnetic directions for discrete samples show relatively shallow inclinations compared wit h Sites U1527 and U1528. In particular, three samples from Igneou s Unit 2 (Cores 376-U1530A-10R to 11R; 50–55 mbsf) show consistent positive inclinations, confirmed by corresponding pieces measured in the cryogenic magnetometer. The NRM intensities an d magnetic susceptibilities also highlight relative differences betwee n the various igneous units. For example, Igneous Unit 1 is characterized by low NRM intensities, low coercivities, and erratic therma l demagnetization curves. Igneous Units 2 and 4 are characterized b y very low NRM intensities with complex AF and thermal demagnetization curves, but larger coercivities. Igneous Units 3 and 5 sho w low NRM intensities, low-to-medium magnetic coercivities, an d relatively simple AF and thermal demagnetization curves, with  a minor overprint from drilling. Igneous Units 1, 2, and 4 also sho w increases of NRM intensity after heating to temperatures ${>}400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , suggesting irreversible transformation of the original magnetic minerals during heating.  

Variations of physical properties at Site U1530 show good correlations with defined igneous units and subunits but correlate les s well with transitions in alteration types. Igneous Unit 1, which corresponds to Alteration Type I, contains the peak values for magneti c susceptibility and NGR at the site. NGR peaks are also recorded b y downhole measurements with the hostile environment natura l gamma ray sonde (HNGS) and are an order-of-magnitude highe r than those recorded at the other Brothers drill sites, attributed t o radioactive U isotopes in the sulfide and barite veins observed a t this depth.  

Transitions between and within igneous units and subunits ar e clearly defined by variations in bulk density, porosity, and $P$ -wav e velocity. These data do not show strong correlation with structura l features such as fractures or alteration veins. Observed variations i n magnetic susceptibility and thermal conductivity do not correspon d clearly to the observed abundance or distribution of particular minerals, but there is a large increase in magnetic susceptibility fro m Igneous Unit 4 to 5.  

Overall, physical properties data define two intervals of markedly different characteristics: ${\sim}30$ to ${\sim}35$ mbsf in Igneous Unit 2 an d $\mathord{\sim}75$ to ${\sim}85$ mbsf in Igneous Unit 4. These intervals are characterized by high grain density, low bulk density, and high porosity. The y also correspond to increased concentrations of $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}},$ S, trace metals, and metalloids and are located directly beneath intervals characterized by increased fracture density and wide ranges in di p angles of alteration veins. These intervals may therefore be important for understanding the past fluid-rock interactions and flo w pathways of the hydrothermal system at Site U1530.  

Multiple borehole temperature measurements obtained ove r the downhole logging period indicate that the hole warmed fro m ${\sim}35^{\circ}$ to $94^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at ${\sim}430$ mbsf during the first $^{5\,\mathrm{h}}$ after stopping circulation and then cooled to $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ during the subsequent $^{10\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ . The temperature profile shows a gradual increase in temperature wit h depth, indicative of a largely conductive-dominated regime in th e borehole, and also displays a “concave up” shape suggestive of recharge into the formation. Thermal anomalies in the temperatur e profiles observed between 255 and 295 mbsf may indicate a permeable flow zone. This interval is also characterized by the highes t number of veins with a large range in vein dip and a higher abundance of fractures, suggesting structural control for this permeabl e zone. Downhole caliper measurements show an overall comparatively large borehole diameter partially exceeding the measurabl e  

$43.2\;\mathrm{cm}$ (17 inches), with a minimum of $24.0~\mathrm{{cm}}$ (9.5 inches) and  a median of $41.1\ \mathrm{cm}$ (16.2 inches). Downhole natural gamma ra y measurements revealed high uranium content between 23 and 3 5 mbsf, correlating well with high values measured on the recovere d core and most likely related to barite that was identified by XR D analysis. High potassium values correspond to Alteration Types I I and III, both of which contain abundant illite. Downhole densit y and porosity measurements are in good agreement with discret e core measurements. The interval between 70 and 85 mbsf in Igneous Unit 4 and Alteration Type IIIa has low bulk density and hig h porosity from both discrete and downhole measurements as well a s low resistivity.  

A total of 18 whole-round samples ( $5{-}11~\mathrm{cm}$ long) were collected from Hole U1530A for microbiological analysis (Table T1) . Samples were processed for shore-based DNA and RNA analyses, cell and viral counting, and viral and microbial activity measurements. PFMD was used for contamination testing and was usuall y detected on the outside of uncleaned cores and, on rare occasions, was above detection levels on the cleaned outside of cores. However, concentrations of PFMD in drilling fluid samples were muc h lower than the expected 500 ppb values. Based on the results, th e decision was made to increase the PFMD tracer pumping rate by  a factor of 10 at the next drill site (U1531) and to collect drilling flui d from every core.  

# Site U1531  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1531 (proposed alternate Site LC-1A) is located on th e saddle between the Lower and Upper Cones of Brothers volcano a t $34^{\circ}52.7767^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}04.2241^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1355\;\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F6) . This site likely sits between the margins of the upflow zones of bot h the Upper and Lower Cones because there is no detectable magnetic low in this area. The Lower Cone hydrothermal vent field includes vents that discharge the most Fe- and $\mathrm{Mg}$ -rich fluids sample d at Brothers volcano to date, although there is no evidence for venting at the saddle. The main objective of Site U1531 was to drill an d core to $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf to sample the various volcanic cycles that comprise the Lower Cone as well as to intersect the upflow zone o f metal-rich fluids.  

# Operations  

We implemented operations in five holes at Site U1531. Hole s U1531A, U1531B, and U1531E were drilled on the saddle stretchin g between the Lower and Upper Cone of Brothers volcano. Hole s U1531C and U1531D were established on the summit of the Lowe r Cone. Hole U1531A is located at $34^{\circ}52.7767^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2241^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at  a water depth of $1354.9\mathrm{~m~}$ . In this hole, we conducted RCB corin g from the seafloor to 15 mbsf, with poor recovery of $1.0\textrm{m}(7\%)$ . Further advancement was impossible due to very poor hole condition s that led to a stuck drill string several times. In Hole U1531B, locate d at $34^{\circ}52.7721^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2111^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1351.9\ \mathrm{m},$ RC B coring penetrated from the seafloor to 26 mbsf and recovered $4.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(15\%)$ . However, poor hole conditions in blocky/fragmented lav a deposits prevented us from further deepening the hole. We the n offset the vessel ${\sim}110\;\mathrm{m}$ northeastward to the summit of the Lowe r Cone to Hole U1531C at $34^{\circ}52.7239^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2586^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a wate r depth of $1306.9\mathrm{~m~}$ . Here, we RCB cored from the seafloor to 28. 4 mbsf and recovered $2.3\textrm{m}(8\%)$ , with tight hole conditions throughout coring. We thus abandoned Hole U1531C at 28.4 mbsf.  

We then decided to deploy a reentry system with a short, $16~\mathrm{m}$ long casing string to establish a stable hole for reaching deeper coring and logging objectives. We drilled in casing in Hole U1531D a t $34^{\circ}52.7228^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2606^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1306.9\,\mathrm{m}$ at the summit of the Lower Cone. After the pilot bit drilled to the target dept h of 19 mbsf, we released the reentry system from the drilling assembly (mud motor, underreamer, and drill bit), but we were unable t o pull the drilling assembly clear of the casing string, as the underreamer arms did not completely retract. After several hours of attempting to free the reentry system, we started pulling the dril l string and attached reentry system out of the hole and back to th e vessel. While we were retrieving the casing-reentry system assembly, it unfortunately dropped off in sight of the moonpool, with ou r position above the bottom part of Lower Cone slope in its transitio n to the surrounding southeastern caldera floor.  

We then moved back to the saddle between the Lower and Upper Cone and made up another drilling assembly to drill-in $16\;\mathrm{m}$ o f casing  in  Hole  U1531E,  which  is  located  at $34^{\circ}52.7591^{\prime}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $179^{\circ}4.2344^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $1355.0\;\mathrm{m}$ . We drilled-in the casin g to 17.9 mbsf. We then conducted another test of the CDEX TDCS, which washed down (drilled without coring) to 17.9 mbsf to star t coring in Hole U1531E. We could not advance any deeper, as th e TDCS core barrel got stuck in the BHA and could not be retrieved. After the TDCS test, we RCB cored from 17.9 to 39.6 mbsf and recovered only $0.8\mathrm{~m~}(4\%)$ . At this point, the blower motor in the to p drive failed. We decided not to repair it at this time due to our remaining scientific priorities and the approaching end of the expedition. Our final operation at Site U1531 consisted of a downhol e temperature measurement with the ETBS memory tool. It recorde d a maximum temperature of ${\sim}5^{\circ}C$ at 20 mbsf. A total of $264.25\,\mathrm{h}$ , o r 11.01 days, were spent at Site U1531.  

# Principal results  

At Site U1531, one igneous unit was observed in Holes U1531 A $(0{-}1.14~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , U1531B (0–21.97 mbsf), U1531C (0–23.75 mbsf), and U1531E (17.90–34.95 mbsf). Several cores were also recovere d during hole cleaning (“ghost cores”; Cores 376-U1531E-2G to 4G). Igneous Unit 1 consists of unaltered to slightly altered plagioclasepyroxene phyric dacite lava intercalated with unconsolidated ash, ash with lapilli, and lapilli tephra with ash. The moderately to highl y vesicular dacite lava contains glomerocrysts and phenocrysts of plagioclase, ortho- and clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides in cryptocrystalline and hypocrystalline groundmass. Volcaniclastic materia l is mainly composed of unaltered vitric clasts and crystals, likel y fragments of the dacite lava, and subordinate lithic components. The composition of the dacitic lavas and pyroclastic rocks from Sit e U1531 is typical for those of the youngest dacitic magmas erupte d at Brothers volcano.  

Based on the alteration mineral assemblage, one alteration typ e was identified at Site U1531. This Alteration Type I, classified a s slightly altered, has an alteration mineral assemblage of smectite, iron oxyhydroxide, zeolite, pyrite, and rarely native sulfur. Alteration occurs as infilling and lining of vesicles as well as smectite replacing the glassy matrix.  

Site U1531 has a structural record of volcanic eruptions an d brittle deformation in all holes, yielding volcanic fabrics and fractures, respectively. Volcanic fabric intensity ranges from isotropic t o strong, with the majority of intervals having a strong fabric and isotropic intervals being present in only three intervals. Fabrics are defined by elongated vesicles, plagioclase microlites, and to a lesse r extent plagioclase phenocrysts and glomerocrysts. Vesicles have aspect ratios between 5 and 15. Hole U1531C is the only hole wher e fabric orientation was able to be measured with dips that rang e from moderate to steep. A few pieces in Hole U1531C have lineations defined by vesicles; all plunges are subparallel to the dip. Several core pieces from all holes have microfractures delineated by th e growth of halite and gypsum in the core description laboratory afte r pieces were cut and dried. Discrete fractures are best preserved i n Hole U1531C. Fractures range from shallow to steep and are typically marked by secondary minerals such as native sulfur or iro n oxyhydroxide.  

Unaltered to slightly altered lavas and tephra from Igneous Uni t 1 represent typical dacites, with $62.3{-}65.0~\mathrm{wt}\%$ $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}\ +$ $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ contents ranging from $6.5–6.9\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ . They are essentially simila r in major and trace element composition to fresh dacites from Sit e U1529 and Hole U1527A (Igneous Unit 1 at those sites) and confirm the low compositional range previously reported for dacites a t Brothers volcano. TC and sulfur concentrations are generally lo w $_{<250}$ and $<\!300\ \upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g}.$ , respectively) except in one sample with $\mathrm{T}\cal C\approx$ $1900~\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ . Low total sulfur is consistent with previously reporte d data for dacitic glass in Brothers volcano, suggesting minimal influence of magmatic volatile input in the selected samples. However, the detection of relatively high concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and acid-volatile sulfides in some intervals is consistent with discharging magmatic gases through the volcanic pile.  

Only three core sections recovered from Site U1531 (i.e., Hol e U1531C) had oriented pieces that could be measured in the cryogenic superconducting rock magnetometer. In addition, we selecte d five discrete samples from the working-half core sections for detailed measurements of AMS, AF, and thermal demagnetization, a s well as IRM experiments. As expected from fresh dacites, NRM intensities are large. Magnetic directions from these samples have inclinations of $\mathrm{\sim-60^{\circ}}$ , suggesting a very young age for the primar y magnetization component. The shape of the thermal demagnetization curve indicates that these samples contain pure magnetite an d titanomagnetite with variable Ti content.  

Physical properties measurements made on limited fragmente d core recovered from Holes U1531A, U1531B, U1531C, and U1531 E are consistent with the range of expected values for fresh dacitic lavas and tephras and are similar to those for fresh volcaniclastic material from Igneous Unit 1 at corresponding Sites U1527 to U1529. There is no clear difference in physical properties between material recovered from the summit of the Lower Cone and material recovered from the saddle, although interpretation is significantly limite d by the low recovery, fragmented nature of the core, and limite d number of oriented pieces.  

The ETBS memory tool was deployed in Hole U1531E afte r about $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ without circulation. It recorded a maximum temperatur e of $5.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 20 mbsf, which is similar to the bottom seawater temperature.  

One whole-round sample of moderately vesicular dacite lav a was collected from Hole U1531C for microbiological analysis (Tabl e T1). Sample aliquots were taken and preserved for shore-base d DNA and RNA analyses, as well as prokaryotic and viral countin g and activity measurements.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 376 was designed to provide the missing link (i.e. , the third dimension) in our understanding of hydrothermal activit y and mineral deposit formation at submarine arc volcanoes and th e relationship between the discharge of magmatic fluids and the dee p biosphere. The drill sites are located in areas considered to be hydrothermal upflow zones of geochemically distinct fluids that ar e variably affected by magmatic volatile input, allowing us to directl y address the consequences of magma degassing for metal transpor t to the seafloor and its effect on the functioning of microbial communities.  

Expedition 376 completed five sites: two (Sites U1527 an d U1530) within the NW Caldera seawater-dominated hydrotherma l field, two (Sites U1528 and U1531) within the Upper and Lowe r Cone magmatic fluid-influenced hydrothermal fields, and one (Sit e U1529) in a magnetic low that delineates the W Caldera upflo w zone. Although three of these sites were original primary sites an d one (Site U1531) an original alternate site, Site U1530 was adde d during the expedition. This addition was needed because we encountered much thicker than expected loose, unconsolidated volcanic gravels, sands, and ash-like material that caused significan t drilling difficulties early in the expedition, particularly for Sit e U1529 on the caldera floor, where Hole U1529B collapsed after onl y ${\sim}34\mathrm{~m~}$ of penetration. Hence, we sought and obtained approval t o move an alternate caldera floor site to a new location on a bench o n the NW Caldera wall (Site U1530) to minimize the likelihood of a n overburden of unconsolidated volcaniclastic material.  

Expedition 376 used rotary coring for most sites, but it als o tested a prototype TDCS developed by Japanese Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) in Holes U1528 C and U1531E. Drilling was extremely successful, coring $1244\mathrm{~m~}$ an d recovering $222.4\:\mathrm{m}$ of core—almost four times that of ODP Leg 15 8 (TAG hydrothermal field, Mid-Atlantic Ridge) (Herzig et al., 1998) and almost three times that of ODP Leg 193 (PACMANUS hydrothermal field, Eastern Manus Basin) (Barriga et al., 2007), representing  the  two  previous  endeavors  with  volcanic  rock-hoste d hydrothermal systems as drilling targets. Important to the succes s of Expedition 376 was the use of drill-in casing, which provided stability in the volcaniclastic deposits encountered in the upper part o f some holes. Overall, the recovery averaged $18\%$ for Expedition 37 6 (cf. $13\%$ for ODP Leg 158 and $11\%$ for ODP Leg 193), varying between $1\%$ (U1527A) and $29\%$ (U1528D), depending on the hole an d lithologies encountered. Downhole measurements and borehol e fluid sampling were conducted in Holes U1528D, U1530A, an d U1531E. Given the low and variable recovery, the downhole log s from Sites U1528 and U1530 will be extremely helpful postexpedition in the interpretation of the rock record.  

We expect that integration of the shipboard data with postexpedition shore-based analyses will result in significant progres s toward addressing all four of the primary scientific objectives outlined in the Expedition 376 Scientific Prospectus (de Ronde et al., 2017), discussed below.  

1. Characterize the subvolcano, magma chamber–derived volatile phase in order to test model-based predictions that this is either a single-phase gas, or two-phase brine-vapor  

Hole U1528D penetrated $359.3\;\mathrm{m}$ through the center of the Upper Cone, beginning at the floor of a pit crater at its summit. Muc h of the core recovered from this hole smelled strongly of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and  a mineral assemblage of illite $^+$ natroalunite $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ quartz $^+$ opal-CT $^+$ pyrite attests to acid-sulfate fluids derived from the disproportionation of magmatic gases, such as $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ . Headspace ga s analyses confirm relatively high levels of acid-volatile sulfide (a s much as $20\;\mathrm{mM}$ near the bottom of the hole) and $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ (as much a s $182\ \mathrm{mM},$ . The effects of strong acid on the host rock are also reflected in the geochemical data, which indicate extreme depletio n of major elements, such as MgO, $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , and $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ . Furthermore, ver y acid (as low as $\mathsf{p H}\,1.8)$ , relatively hot $(\le\!247^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ fluids collected by th e  

Kuster FTS tool at depths of 160, 279, and 313 mbsf have compositions indicative of significant magmatic gas input. In addition, preliminary fluid inclusion results provide evidence for two dominan t fluids having transgressed the Upper Cone: a hot $(\le\!340^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ hydrothermal fluid of modified-seawater origin that appears to have undergone phase separation and a hot $(\le360^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ hypersaline brine tha t may be transporting metals, given the observation of sulfide daughter crystals (together with halite) in some of the inclusions. Th e highest fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures are coinciden t with a high-temperature acidic alteration mineral assemblage of natroalunite $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ opal-CT, indicating $\geq\!230^{\circ}\!C$ (e.g., Reye s et al., 1990). These results clearly show brine-vapor conditions occurring within the Upper Cone site at Brothers volcano.  

Hole U1531E penetrated 39.6 mbsf into the SW flank of th e Lower Cone immediately east of the saddle between the lowe r flanks of the Upper and Lower Cones. Cores recovered from thi s hole are largely fresh lavas with only incipient low-temperature alteration, although native sulfur, coating the walls of small fractures, indicates limited interaction with magmatic volatiles and/or hydrothermal fluids. However, the observation of extensive diffuse venting of gassy, very acidic fluids emanating from and surrounding th e summit of the Lower Cone (de Ronde et al., 2011) implies that magmatic degassing must be restricted to narrow upflow zones.  

Further shore-based studies, including additional analyses of th e borehole fluids and more extensive fluid inclusion studies, will hel p constrain the characteristics of the fluids within the Upper Cone hydrothermal system, allowing us to test models of the subsurfac e hydrologic regimes at Brothers volcano.  

2. Explore the subseafloor distribution of base and precious metals and metalloids as well as the reactions that have taken place along pathways to the seafloor  

Holes U1527C and U1530A are located in different parts of th e NW Caldera hydrothermal vent field, the former on the wester n margin of the field atop the caldera rim and the latter on the calder a wall. Hole U1527C was drilled to 238 mbsf and penetrated variabl y altered volcaniclastic rocks and coherent lava of dacitic composition. The upper $185~\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1527C is dominated by a mineral assemblage of goethite $^+$ opal $^+$ mordenite, indicative of relativel y low-temperature $(<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ alteration. This assemblage is replace d downhole by chlorite $^+$ quartz $^+$ illite $\pm$ smectite, and the lowe r parts of the hole are characterized by an assemblage dominated b y quartz $^+$ chlorite $^+$ pyrite $\pm$ illite. These assemblages indicate alteration temperatures $>\!230^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Pyrite is the predominant sulfide phas e in Hole U1527C and is disseminated mainly in the deeper chlorite $^+$ illite-rich part of the core.  

Hole U1530A was located proximal to a fault that exposes  a stockwork zone, where several centimeter-thick, metal-rich vein s form an anastomosing network within the altered host rock. Hol e U1530A was drilled to 453 mbsf through a sequence of altered volcaniclastics with intercalated coherent lavas and an interval of altered volcanic sediments. The upper ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ of core has a mineral assemblage of opal-CT $^+$ smectite $^+$ chlorite $^+$ pyrite $^+$ barite $^+$ sphalerite, indicative of alteration temperatures of $100^{\circ}{-}250^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Th e occurrence of sphalerite and pyrite in close proximity to the sulfat e minerals, along with the presence of a dense network of veins averaging $0.2\;\mathrm{cm}$ in thickness and enrichment in metals and metalloid s (Zn, As, Cu, Mo, Se, and $\mathrm{Pb}$ ), is consistent with the proximity of th e hole to the exposed stockwork zone.  

This assemblage is replaced downhole by quartz $^+$ illite $^+$ chlorite $^+$ anhydrite, pointing to alteration temperatures ${<}275^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Mor e acid $\ensuremath{\left(\mathrm{pH}<4\right)}$ and hotter $(250^{\circ}{-}300^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ fluids are implied even further downhole with the appearance of pyrophyllite below $\mathord{\sim}190$ mbsf, followed by a final assemblage of diaspore $^+$ quartz $^+$ pyrophyllite $^+$ rutile $\pm$ zunyite below ${\sim}225$ mbsf. Two-phase fluid inclusions (with and without daughter halite crystals) associated with th e pyrophyllite- and diaspore-rich alteration assemblages have homogenization temperatures of ${\sim}350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $390^{\circ}C$ . Other inclusion s are complex and contain various daughter minerals, including halite, sulfates, and other anisotropic minerals, with homogenizatio n temperatures $>\!320^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Combined, the fluid inclusions are indicativ e of hypersaline brines like those seen in fluid inclusions at Uppe r Cone Site U1528. Pyrite is the main proxy for metals in the borehol e and is distributed throughout the hole, though more so in the chlorite $^+$ illite-rich zones. The loss of K, Ba, Y, and $\mathrm{Cu}$ below $\mathord{\sim}190$ mbs f and an increase in the magnitude of depletion below ${\sim}225~\mathrm{mbsf},$ corresponding to the appearance of pyrophyllite and diaspore, ar e also consistent with a downhole decrease in $\mathsf{p H}$ and increase i n temperature (above $\mathrm{{\sim}250^{\circ}C)}$ ) of fluid-rock reaction. Later incursio n and mixing of seawater and hydrothermal fluid that overprints earlier mineral assemblages resulting from reaction with more acidi c fluids is reflected in the increased abundances of smectite, chlorite, and anhydrite in a later alteration event.  

The large variations observed in the alteration mineral assemblages encountered at Sites U1527, U1528, and U1530 clearly attes t to complex but distinct paragenetic sequences at both the NW Caldera and the Upper Cone hydrothermal fields. Interestingly, it appears  that  the  currently  seawater-dominated  NW  Calder a hydrothermal field may have undergone an earlier phase of reactions with acid-sulfate fluids, resulting in alteration assemblages resembling those observed in the Upper Cone. Further mineralogical, geochemical, and fluid inclusion shore-based studies will elucidat e the reactions that take place along pathways to the seafloor as wel l as the distribution, transport, and fate of metals and metalloid s within the hydrothermal systems of Brothers volcano.  

3. Quantify the mechanisms and extent of fluid-rock interaction, the consequences for mass transfer of metals and metalloids into the ocean, and the role of magmatically derived carbon and sulfur species in mediating these fluxes  

Fluid-rock reactions at Sites U1527, U1528, and U1530 have occurred under a range of conditions (i.e., temperature, pH, Eh, etc.), and hence quantifying mass transfer of elements into the ocean i s difficult, particularly given the heterogeneous lithologies encountered at all sites. The mineral assemblage of quartz $^+$ illite $^+$ chlorit e $^+$ anhydrite $\pm$ smectite in Holes U1527C and U1530A in the N W Caldera hydrothermal vent field clearly points to a complex exchange between a hydrothermal fluid of modified-seawater composition and the dacitic protolith, indicated by $\mathrm{Mg}$ and S enrichmen t as well as both depletion and enrichment in K and Rb, in addition t o relatively subtle changes in other major elements (normalized to th e composition of unaltered dacitic lava from Site U1527). These element exchanges are distinct from those observed in the mineral assemblage indicative of interaction with  hot acidic fluids (i.e., denoted by the assemblage of pyrophyllite $^+$ diaspore $^+$ quartz + illite $\pm$ rutile) seen deeper in Hole U1530A, which show strong depletions in K, Mg, Ca, Na, and Fe contents.  

In contrast, at the Upper Cone site, alteration and elemental exchange are affected by magmatic volatile-driven reactions. Magmatic gases (high concentrations of $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ $\Sigma C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ and dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ were measured in headspace gas analyses) condense in seawate r with disproportionation reactions involving $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ bufferin g the hydrothermal fluid compositions, resulting in rocks of the Upper Cone being strongly leached by acids. The leaching leads to depletion of many major elements, including Mg, K, Rb, Na, Fe, Ca, and Mn, and enrichment in S (note that the loss of Fe may be relate d to interaction with a later-stage, sulfate-rich fluid). Fluid inclusio n data from depth in Hole U1528D suggest that most metals are likel y still at depth, given the highly saline $33\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ equiv. NaCl) brines, with noticeable sulfide daughter minerals included. Active ventin g at the Upper and Lower Cone sites is testament to the flux of $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ sulfur, and iron in particular into the overlying water column (d e Ronde et al., 2011).  

Shore-based analyses will focus on more detailed geochemical , isotopic, and fluid inclusion studies to decipher the conditions of alteration, the sources of elements, and the elemental exchanges tha t accompany fluid-rock reactions.  

4. Assess the diversity, extent, and metabolic pathways of microbial life in an extreme, metal-toxic, and acidic volcanic environment  

The overarching objectives for microbiological studies for Expedition 376 focus on determining the biomass, activity, and community structure of subsurface microbial and viral communities usin g an array of molecular microbiological applications. Whole-roun d samples collected for microbiological studies were subsampled fo r shore-based analyses to explore the limits of microbial life and characterize the microbial diversity (including Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses)  using  cultivation-based  and  cultivation-independen t molecular biological approaches.  

Relatively few shipboard analyses were performed because mos t measurements require postexpedition studies in shore-based laboratories. First, detection of ATP was attempted on board to identif y signs of bacterial life in the rock samples. However, detection wa s not successful in most cases due to denaturation of the luciferas e enzyme by compounds found within the retrieved material. Second, tracers were pumped into the drill string prior and during core recovery. Systematic sampling of the cored material and drilling fluid s indicated that the interiors of the whole-round samples for microbiology are suitable for shore-based analyses.  

Postexpedition analyses will include an array of techniques: (1 ) total cell counts to quantify microbial biomass, (2) DNA analysis o f small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing to address community structure, (3) metagenomics analysis to reconstruct the metabolic potential and identify entire genomes fro m microbial populations in the samples, (4) RNA determination usin g metatranscriptomics to establish potential community activity (i.e., the genes that are most highly expressed in a given microbial environment), (5) characterization of the viral diversity using polymerase chain reaction and metagenomic approaches to identify th e role of viruses in the ecosystem, (6) metabolic activity measurements of microbial communities using stable isotope-labeled or radioactive isotope-labeled tracers to identify what kinds of majo r energy and carbon metabolisms are present, and (7) enrichment o f specific groups of organisms to identify the unique physiological properties of the organisms.  

# Operations  

# Auckland port call  

Expedition 376 started with the first line ashore at the Freyber g Wharf B in Auckland, New Zealand, at $0652\mathrm{~h~}$ on 5 May 2018, marking the end of Expedition 375 (Hikurangi Subduction Margin). Activities on the first day of port call included boarding the Expedition 376 Co-Chief Scientists, JOIDES Resolution Science Operato r (JRSO) staff, and Center for Deep Earth Exploration (CDEX) engineering staff. The JRSO staff conducted the crossover with their Expedition 375 counterparts. Initial loading of incoming freight bega n while Expedition 375 core and sample shipments were offloaded.  

On 6 May, Expedition 376 (Brothers Arc Flux) scientist s boarded the vessel, moved their luggage into their cabins, receive d an introduction regarding information technology, were given a n initial safety orientation, and then were introduced to life on boar d and the science laboratories. Loading and discharge of freight continued throughout the day. The freight activity included loading 8 3 joints of casing (10.75 inch and 13.375 inch), 40 joints of 5.5 inc h drill pipe, and 88.5 metric tons of sepiolite.  

On 7 May, the scientists and JRSO technical staff were introduced to each other, and the Co-Chief Scientists initiated the expedition with a presentation on the expedition science objectives. Thi s presentation was followed by a second talk addressing the scienc e work plan presented by the IODP Expedition Project Manager. I n the afternoon, the Captain introduced key staff to the science part y and gave an orientation on ship safety. All science groups the n started learning their onboard laboratory tasks, including setting u p applicable instruments, assisted by JRSO staff.  

On 8 May, all loading of supplies and hardware as well as publi c relations activities were completed. In the evening, the ship shifte d to Wynyard Wharf for fueling, with the first line ashore at $1930~\mathrm{h}$ . Fueling was completed at $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 May.  

# Transit to Site U1527  

At $0758~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 May 2018, the pilot arrived on board, and th e vessel departed Wynyard Wharf with the last line away at $0821\ \mathrm{h}$ . Our departure was assisted by one harbor tug, and we thereafte r proceeded to the pilot station, where the pilot departed the vessel a t $0924\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . We then began our transit through the Hauraki Gulf to Sit e U1527 at Brothers volcano. In the afternoon of 9 May, the Captai n held the first fire and safety drill. During the transit, the Co-Chie f Scientists met with key members of the IODP JRSO staff and ship’ s crew to review the coring and logging plan for the expedition.  

# Site U1527  

The original plan for Site U1527 (proposed Site NWC-1A) wa s to drill two holes. The first, a pilot hole, was designated to core t o ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ with the RCB system. The second hole was to drill-in a reentry system to a depth determined based on the pilot hole. The reentry system was supposed to allow for $405~\mathrm{m}$ of penetration at Sit e U1527. Actual operations proved different from the plan, leading t o drilling of three holes. Hole U1527A was RCB cored to 101.4 mbsf. Hole U1527B was RCB drilled to $105.5\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , with $95.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long casing installed, but could not be reentered due to the reentry syste m being inadvertently retracted. Hole U1527C was cased to 95.5 mbs f and reentered with continuous RCB coring from 99 to 238 mbsf. Al l cores, penetration depths, and core recovery are displayed in Tabl e T2.  

# Hole U1527A  

After completion of the $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ transit from Auckland $246\;\mathrm{nmi}$ a t $10.6~\mathrm{kt})$ , we arrived at Site U1527 at $0800~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 May 2018. W e picked up a new RCB coring bit with a mechanical bit release, assembled the RCB BHA, verified the correct space-out of the cor e barrel, and lowered it to the seafloor. We deployed nonmagneti c core barrels throughout coring at Site U1527. The subsea camer a system, along with the advanced piston corer temperature too l (APCT-3) temperature shoe (for recording a water column temperature profile), was lowered to the seafloor to conduct a survey, and the seafloor site marker left in 2017 by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was quickly located. After tagging six potential hole locations to verify the water depth, the subsea camera system wa s retrieved and the acoustic beacon deployed. We then spudded Hol e U1527A at a water depth of $1464.2\;\mathrm{m}$ at $2240\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 May. Trace r material PFMD was pumped continuously while drilling. Maximu m downhole temperatures were recorded by temperature strips contained in a housing tool attached to the RCB core barrel head.  

Cores 376-U1527A-1R to 15R penetrated the seafloor to a fina l depth of 101.4 mbsf, with extremely poor recovery of only $1.27\textrm{m}$ $(1.3\%)$ in unconsolidated volcanic deposits. The change to halflength advance $\left(4.8\mathrm{~m}\right)$ RCB coring from Cores 7R to 15R did no t improve the recovery, with all but one core barrel recovered bein g empty. Coring was terminated when we determined that the hol e conditions were worsening, leading to the decision that ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ o f casing was all that could likely be installed and would be sufficien t to prevent the hole from collapsing. A total of $51.3~\mathrm{h}$ , or 2.1 days, were spent in Hole U1527A.  

# Hole U1527B  

After completing Hole U1527A, the ship was offset $20\ \mathrm{m}$ east , and we started assembling a reentry system for installation in Hol e U1527B to facilitate the deep coring and logging objectives at thi s site. We assembled a $95.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long, 10.75 inch casing string and  a BHA consisting of a 9.875 inch tricone drill bit, an underreamer (se t to $12.75\;\mathrm{inch})$ ), a mud motor, two stands of drill collars, and $23\;\mathrm{m}$ o f drill pipe. The preassembled running stand with the HRT (casin g running tool) was lowered to the moonpool and connected to th e casing string. The reentry funnel was picked up, installed, an d welded to the top casing joint, together with the hard rock landin g frame.  

At $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 May 2018, we opened the moonpool and starte d lowering the $95.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long casing string and drilling assembly to th e seafloor. After deploying the subsea camera system at $1530~\mathrm{h}$ , w e spudded Hole U1527B at $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ at a water depth of $1464.2\;\mathrm{m}$ . Afte r drilling-in the casing to ${\sim}92$ mbsf, drilling slowed to a stop wit h high standpipe pressures. We then worked the reentry system an d eventually landed it on the seafloor, completing drilling-in the casing when the bit reached 105.5 mbsf at $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 May. The HR T was activated to release the drill string from the casing. After recovering the subsea camera system and pulling the drill string back t o the ship, we found the reentry system and casing were still attache d to the drill string because the underreamer arms had not retracted. The reentry system was landed back in the moonpool, and the reentry funnel and hard rock landing frame were removed. After working the drill string, the underreamer was finally drawn up into th e casing, and the HRT BHA was disassembled. When the end of th e drill string cleared the rig floor at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 May, we discovere d that the 9.875 inch tricone bit was missing from the bit sub, whic h was damaged beyond repair. After examining the damaged components and the rig instrumentation data, we determined that the bi t most likely failed at a depth of ${\sim}92\mathrm{~m~}$ . In total, $76.3~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , or 3.2 days, were spent in Hole U1527B.  

# Hole U1527C  

We then offset the vessel $20\,\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1527B as w e started making up a new reentry system for installation in Hol e U1527C, utilizing the $95.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of casing already landed in the moonpool. A new 9.875 inch tricone bit and underreamer (set to 12.7 5 inch) were installed in the drilling assembly, which was shortene d by $\sim\!5\,\mathrm{m}$ . The remainder of the BHA—two stands of drill collars an d $23\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of drill pipe—were assembled, and the HRT stand was attached to the top of the casing string. The drilling assembly wa s lowered through the moonpool and bolted to the casing string. Th e reentry funnel was then reassembled in the moonpool. The assembled reentry funnel and the hard rock landing frame were welded t o the casing.  

At $0615\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 May 2018, the reentry system and $95.5\;\mathrm{m}$ lon g casing string were lowered through the open moonpool doors to th e seafloor. The subsea camera system was deployed at $0945~\mathrm{h}$ to observe the reentry funnel while drilling-in the casing. Hole U1527 C was spudded at $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 May. Drilling was completed at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 May when the bit reached 99.9 mbsf. The HRT was activate d through deployment of a go-devil tool, which freed the drill strin g from the casing. The drill string was raised so that the HRT was visible above the reentry funnel. After the underreamer was verified t o have entered the casing, the remainder of the hole was displace d with heavy mud. The drill string was pulled out of the hole, and th e bit reached the rig floor at $1150~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 May. The BHA was disassembled, and the mud motor and underreamer were flushed wit h freshwater.  

An RCB BHA was made up, including a new RCB bit, and a t $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ , the drill string was lowered to the seafloor. We deployed th e subsea camera system, located the reentry funnel immediately, an d reentered Hole U1527C at $2014~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 May after only $14~\mathrm{min}$ o f maneuvering. Upon recovery of the subsea camera system, the bi t was washed down (i.e., drilling without coring) to 99.9 mbsf, and 3 0 barrels of mud sweep were pumped. We dropped a core barrel an d began RCB coring from 99.9 mbsf. Cores 376-U1527C-2R to 20 R penetrated to 238.0 mbsf and recovered $25.9~\mathrm{m}$ of core $(19\%)$ . Th e first nine of these cores took only $10\;\mathrm{min}$ each to cut but had no t o extremely poor recovery (0 to $0.54\mathrm{~m})$ ), retrieving pebbles from unconsolidated volcanic deposits. While cutting Core 11R, we encountered a substantial formation change at $\mathord{\sim}187$ mbsf, and cor e recovery improved to $29\%$ . After Core 11R, we switched to halflength advances $\left(4.8\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and continued through Core 20R, recovering $54\%$ on average. The change in formation was reflected in th e lithology, intersecting a consolidated volcaniclastic rock. Regula r mud sweeps were required to keep the hole clean, and a total of 42 5 barrels of high-viscosity mud were pumped during the coring.  

While pulling up to make a connection after cutting Core 376- U1527C-20R at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 May, we experienced high torque wit h the bit at 234 mbsf. Although circulation and rotation were maintained, we had problems picking up the drill string. After workin g the stuck pipe for $13.75\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , we were unable to work it past 125 mbs f $\,\!\,30\,\mathrm{m}$ below the end of the casing string). The decision was made t o release the bit in the hope that we could then pull the drill strin g clear of the hole. We offset the vessel ${\sim}75\mathrm{~m~}$ to access a drill pip e connection at the rig floor to retrieve Core 20R and to release the bi t in an attempt to free the drill string. The vessel was offset back to it s original location while tension was maintained on the drill strin g and attempts to free the stuck pipe continued. Eventually, the dril l string cleared the seafloor at $0155~\mathrm{h}$ on 20 May, but overpull wa s observed at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ . The reentry system was stuck to the drill string. The reentry system was secured in the moonpool, and the hard roc k landing frame was removed from the system. Upon removal of th e reentry funnel, we broke the flange connection and cleaned out cuttings made of lapilli-sized tephra that clogged the HRT latch sleev e and upper casing sub. The cuttings were collected and curated fo r sampling. After working the drill string up and down, it was free d from the reentry system and pulled back to the rig floor. The bi t cleared the rig floor at $1725\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 May, ending Hole U1527C. Th e total time spent in Hole U1527C was $122.0\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 5.1 days. While disassembling the remainder of the reentry system, including eigh t joints of 10.75 inch casing, the vessel moved to Site U1528 about  1 nmi away using the dynamic positioning system.  

# Site U1528  

Our highest priority, Site U1528 (proposed Site UC-1A), consisted of four holes. The original plan was made for a two-hole operation: a pilot hole cored to ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ with the RCB system, followed b y installation of a reentry system in a hole to a depth determined b y lithological conditions encountered in the pilot hole. Penetration t o a depth of 800 mbsf at Site U1528 was envisioned. All operations a t Site U1528 were challenged by the fact that the space to operate wa s restricted to a small flat area of only ${\sim}25~\mathrm{m}$ in diameter at the bottom of a steep-walled pit crater at the summit of the Upper Cone. Thus, we relied heavily on the subsea sonar system attached to th e vibration isolated television (VIT) frame (i.e., the subsea camer a system) throughout operations at Site U1528 for conducting seafloor surveys, drill-in casings, and reentries.  

First, Hole U1528A was cored with the RCB as a pilot hole to  a depth of 84.4 mbsf. Coring was terminated when we determine d that the hole conditions were worsening and would likely result in  a stuck drill string. Hole U1528B was drilled to 25.6 mbsf to install $24.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of casing but could not be reentered because the reentry system was tilted. Hole U1528C saw the very first offshore test of th e CDEX TDCS, which drilled down to 22 mbsf and cored to a final depth of 53.5 mbsf. At that depth, the reduction gear section of th e coring system failed, and the hole had to be terminated. In Hol e U1528D, we drilled in a reentry system to 61.3 mbsf and installe d $59.4~\mathrm{m}$ of casing. Upon reentry, Hole U1528D was then RCB core d to 359.3 mbsf.  

After completing $40~\mathrm{{h}}$ and $10\ \mathrm{min}$ of coring with the RCB bit , coring was halted for borehole fluid sampling, temperature measurements, and logging. We ran our in-house ETBS tool three time s to record downhole temperatures. Deployment of the ETBS alternated with three deployments of the Kuster FTS tool using two different devices: a primary $1000~\mathrm{{mL}}$ and a spare $600~\mathrm{mL}$ tool. Tw o runs with the latter tool recovered borehole fluid samples. The firs t Kuster FTS deployment using the primary tool was unsuccessful, a s the tool failed in the hole and the vast majority of it was not retrieved. Downhole wireline logging was implemented after the second ETBS and Kuster FTS deployments. Given that the ETB S measured a maximum temperature of $212^{\circ}C_{:}$ , we assembled th e flasked HTTC wireline logging string consisting of the lithodensity, natural gamma ray, and logging head temperature tools. After tw o successful logging passes between the seafloor and fill at 332 mbsf, we deployed a drill bit to clean out Hole U1528D from 326 to 35 6 mbsf, the depth of the top of the Kuster FTS tool that was still in th e bottom of the hole. To ensure that we could resume coring, we the n deployed a milling bit and two boot-type junk baskets to remove th e lost Kuster FTS tool in the bottom of the hole. The milling bi t drilled down to the bottom of the hole at 359 mbsf, but the junk baskets did not retrieve any remnants of the Kuster FTS tool. We the n deployed a reverse-circulation junk basket tool with twin boot-typ e baskets for another attempt at clearing the hole so we could continue coring. We worked the tool down to 359 mbsf and circulate d high-viscosity mud sweeps. However, when the end of the drill string arrived back on the rig floor, we discovered that the lowermost $172.8\;\mathrm{m}$ of the drill string was missing. The loss of part of th e drill string ended any further attempt to resume coring in Hol e U1528D.  

After completion of coring at Site U1531, we returned to Hol e U1528D 23 days later and successfully deployed the ETBS tool, Kuster FTS tool, and Petrospec spool-in TCMT. In addition, we als o pulled the failed reentry system of Hole U1528B back to the surfac e at the very end of the Site U1528 operations. A total of $616.8\ \mathrm{h},$ , o r 25.7 days, were recorded while at Site U1528.  

Cores, penetration depths, and core recovery are listed in Tabl e T2.  

# Hole U1528A  

After pulling out of Hole U1527C at $1725\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 May 2018, th e vessel was moved ${\sim}1.1$ nmi to Site U1528 (proposed Site UC-1A) i n dynamic positioning (DP) mode. Once we were positioned over th e site, we made up an RCB BHA for coring in Hole U1528A. While w e were running the RCB BHA to the seafloor, we began a camera an d sonar survey of the seafloor to identify four possible hole location s in the narrow confines of the Upper Cone pit crater, tagging the seafloor at each location to verify the water depth $(1228.4\;\mathrm{m})$ ).  

After retrieving the subsea camera and sonar system (along wit h the APCT-3 temperature shoe that recorded temperatures throughout the water column) and reassembling the rig floor, we picked u p the top drive, dropped a core barrel, and spudded Hole U1528A a t $0825~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 May. Cores 376-U1528A-1R to 15R penetrated fro m the seafloor to a final total depth of 84.4 mbsf (reached at $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ o n $22\ \mathrm{May})$ ) and recovered $22.2~\mathrm{m}$ $(26\%)$ . We switched to half-lengt h advances $\left(4.8\,\textrm{m}\right)$ after Core 6R. We pumped high-viscosity mu d sweeps during the coring to keep the hole clean, adding up to a tota l of 670 barrels of high-viscosity mud. A substantial change to a har d formation was observed at 12.7 mbsf. Once Core 15R was cut, w e had to work a stuck drill string that was finally freed after $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$ . Whil e we were pulling out of the hole, we had to work through poor hol e conditions with high torque from 83 to 66 mbsf, likely due to unconsolidated volcanic debris from the uppermost ${\sim}13\,\mathrm{m}$ of the hole. The drill string finally cleared the seafloor at $1850\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 May. W e were finally able to retrieve Core 15R at $1945\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , ending Hol e U1528A. All cores, penetration depths, core recovery, and time recovered on deck are displayed in Table T2. The time spent in Hol e U1528A was $50.2\,\mathrm{h}_{:}$ , or 2.1 days.  

# Hole U1528B  

After the drill string cleared the seafloor from Hole U1528A, w e offset the vessel $10\,\mathrm{~m~}$ south to the surveyed location of Hol e U1528B. Our initial objective for this hole was to determine th e length of casing needed to stabilize the uppermost unconsolidate d formation to enable deeper coring. At $2040~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 May 2018, w e started RCB drilling without coring, using a center bit in Hol e U1528B. After reaching 13 mbsf and verifying the hard formatio n encountered in Hole U1528A, the drill string was pulled back to th e surface, clearing the seafloor at $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Once the drill bit returned to the rig floor, we started casing operations for Hole U1528B. After assembling $24.3\mathrm{~m~}$ of 10.75 inc h casing, we lowered it to the moonpool and latched it to the mu d skirt. We then made up the casing drilling stinger with a BHA consisting of an 8 inch mud motor, an underreamer set to 12.75 inch, and a 9.875 inch tricone drill bit, to drill-in the reentry system. Following a successful test of the mud motor and underreamer in th e moonpool, the drilling assembly was run inside the casing and attached to the casing flange on the mud skirt with the HRT. Afte r assembling the reentry funnel and welding it to the casing hanger, we shut down operations at $1500~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 May due to inclemen t weather and spent the next $20\,\mathrm{{h}}$ waiting for the weather to improv e enough so that we could safely deploy the reentry system, as well a s precisely position Hole U1528B.  

At $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 May, we picked up the reentry system and lowered it to the seafloor. With rough seas, it was very difficult to position the vessel over the intended coordinates. After reaching 1 3 mbsf, the casing was drilled-in to 25.6 mbsf and the drilling assembly released from the casing using the go-devil. Drilling-in the casing had caused disturbance of the seafloor and visibility was ver y poor, but the HRT inside the throat of the reentry funnel was visible. We had trouble extracting our drilling assembly from the reentr y system. After working the drill string with varying pump strokes fo r several hours, we finally managed to retract it from the reentry system. We pulled the drill string out of the reentry system with th e drilling assembly sliding through the casing with drag, clearing th e top of the reentry funnel at $2330~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 May. The subsea camer a system was retrieved, and the inner drill pipe sleeve was removed s o that the camera system could be deployed over the HRT to examin e the reentry funnel and confirm its landing position. Visibility remained poor, but the very top of the reentry system was observed, although the seafloor was not visible. The top of the funnel was observed at $1224.7\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth, which seemed to verify that it wa s in the correct position. We then recovered the subsea camera system and pulled the drill string out of Hole U1528B.  

Once the drilling assembly had reached the moonpool, the mu d motor and underreamer were flushed with freshwater. The bit returned to the rig floor at $0450\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 May. The return of the bit t o the rig floor essentially ended operations in Hole U1528B, as tw o separate attempts at trying to reenter using both the TDCS (se e Hole U1528C) and an RCB system failed because the reentry syste m had been damaged while landing the casing too close to the crate r walls. The second unsuccessful attempt to reenter was made afte r completion of coring at Site U1529. The final operation of Expedition 376 saw another return to Hole U1528B at the end of the expedition to retrieve the failed reentry system. We reentered Hol e U1528B at $0958\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 3 July, latched into the mock hanger, an d pulled the reentry system back to the surface on the same day.  A total of $79.25\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{m}}$ , or 3.3 days, were recorded while in Hole U1528B.  

# Hole U1528C  

After completing the installation of the reentry system and casing in Hole U1528B, our intention was to reenter the hole to star t coring operations. For this purpose, we assembled the TDCS designed by CDEX to implement its very first offshore test. Once th e TDCS BHA, including a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC ) bit, was assembled, we successfully tested the function of the TDC S core barrel on the rig floor to verify the operation of the equipmen t prior to beginning the pipe trip to bottom.  

At $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 May 2018, we started lowering the TDCS BH A to the seafloor. We then deployed the subsea camera system an d made a reentry attempt at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 May. The PDC bit hung u p in the reentry funnel throat, possibly due to the base of the reentr y system not sitting flat on the seafloor. After we had made several unsuccessful attempts to reenter Hole U1528B, we offset the vessel to a preselected hole position, tagged the seafloor to verify the wate r depth, retrieved the subsea camera, and spudded Hole U1528C a t $0230~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 May. We advanced with a center bit installed to 2 2 mbsf, pulled it, and deployed a TDCS core barrel on a wireline.  

Cores 376-U1528C-2N to 8N penetrated from 22.0 to 53.5 mbsf a t full $4.5\;\mathrm{m}$ advancements and recovered $3.6\:\mathrm{m}\:(12\%)$ . We pumped 3 0 barrels of mud sweeps at several depths to keep the hole clean. When Core 8N was pulled, we observed that only the top one-thir d of the core barrel was recovered. The core barrel had parted in th e reduction gear, so the lower core barrel remained in the BHA. W e pulled the drill string out of the hole, with the bit clearing the seafloor at $2330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 May. The drill string was pulled to the surface, and the TDCS BHA was disassembled and the lower section of th e core barrel was recovered from the BHA. The TDCS PDC bi t cleared the rig floor at $0430~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 May, ending Hole U1528C. While laying out the TDCS subs, the vessel moved to Site U152 9 using the DP system $[\sim\!1.0\,\AA$ nmi move). A total of $47.75\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 2.0 days, were recorded while on Hole U1528C.  

# Hole U1528D  

Upon returning from Site U1529 to make another unsuccessfu l attempt of reentering Hole U1528B, we prepared the installation o f casing in Hole U1528D. The preparation consisted of: (1) assembling a 9.5 inch mud motor, an underreamer (set to 16.5 inches), an d a 12.25 inch tricone drilling bit to form the drilling assembly; (2 ) connecting five joints of 13.375 inch casing to form a $59.4~\mathrm{m}$ lon g casing string; (3) installing and testing the drilling assembly; and (4 ) landing the casing running tool (HRT) in the moonpool and attaching it to the casing string. We then installed and welded the reentr y funnel and hard rock frame. Although the reentry system was read y to be deployed at $0500~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 May 2018, we had to wait for $^{7\mathrm{~h~}}$ until the weather improved enough to start lowering the reentr y funnel and casing to the seafloor.  

Once the weather abated, we lowered the reentry system to th e seafloor and then deployed the subsea camera and sonar system. We began drilling-in the casing into Hole U1528D at $1750~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 0 May. We encountered firm formation between 13 and 15 mbsf. Th e casing running tool (HRT) prematurely released at 35.5 mbsf whil e we were pumping a mud sweep. We decided to continue drillin g down, with the possibility that the casing would continue to settl e into the hole following the bit. The bit eventually reached 50 mbsf. However, after observing that the casing was not following the bit, we attempted to move the casing with the underreamer arms to n o avail for $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . We then continued drilling the 16.5 inch hole from 5 0 mbsf to the planned total depth of 61.3 mbsf, which was reached a t $0640\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 May. After reaming and circulating the hole clean, w e pulled out of the hole while observing the reentry funnel. Hol e U1528D appeared to be located in the flat central area of the pit crater, with the casing and funnel standing independently $23~\mathrm{m}$ abov e the seafloor. We set back the top drive, recovered the subsea camera, and pulled the drill string out of the hole, with the bit clearin g the rig floor at $1605\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 May. Subsequent function tests of th e mud motor and underreamer indicated that they were both workin g properly.  

Our next objective was to reenter Hole U1528D to get the reentry funnel and casing to settle to the appropriate depth. For this purpose, we installed a 13.375 inch cup seal on top of the drillin g assembly $\mathrm{^54.4\,m}$ above the bit) to seal the inside of the casing whil e circulating. This installation was intended to clean the annulus between casing and surrounding formation to promote complete settling of the casing string into the hole. We deployed the subse a camera and sonar system, continued lowering the drill string to th e seafloor, picked up the top drive, and reentered the funnel of Hol e U1528D at $0110\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 June. We lowered the drill string to positio n the cup seal inside the casing with the mud motor and underreame r below the casing shoe, pumped a 20-barrel mud sweep, and bega n attempting to circulate and work the drill string down. After $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}_{\cdot}$ , th e casing began falling at $0534\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 June, and the reentry system finally landed at the seafloor at $0602\,\mathrm{h}$ . After circulating the hole, w e pulled the drill string out of the hole, set back the top drive, recovered the subsea camera, retrieved the drill string, disassembled th e drilling assembly, and flushed the mud motor and underreamer.  

We then made up the RCB BHA, lowered it to the seafloor, deployed the subsea camera and sonar system, and reentered Hol e U1528D at $2035~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 June. After installing the top drive and retrieving the subsea camera system, we lowered the bit through th e casing and circulated ${\sim}7\textrm{m}$ of soft debris out of the bottom of th e hole with 30 barrels of high-viscosity mud. We started RCB corin g from a depth of 61.3 mbsf at $2337~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 June. Half-length $\left.4.8\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ advance) Cores 376-U1528D-2R to 63R penetrated from 61.3 t o $359.3\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $87.2\textrm{m}(29\%)$ . Hole conditions for the entir e interval remained optimum, with 30 barrels of mud sweeps bein g pumped on each core to keep the hole clean. The only short interruption $(1.5\;\mathrm{h})$ of that coring period was caused by a failure of th e hydraulic return line from the top drive (after cutting Core 50R).  

After Core 376-U1528D-63R was cut, we stopped coring, as th e bit had reached $40\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of rotating time and needed to be changed fo r us to continue coring deeper. Before recovering the drill string t o change the bit and resume coring, we decided to measure the borehole temperature and obtain a borehole fluid sample. At $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ on  6 June, we started preparing the ETBS memory tool and the primar y $\mathrm{[1000\:mL]}$ ) Kuster FTS tool for deployment on the coring line. First, we lowered the ETBS attached to a core barrel and let the tool collect data for $15~\mathrm{min}$ at the bottom of the hole; on recovery, it revealed an average temperature of $33^{\circ}C$ . We then deployed th e Kuster FTS tool with a core barrel to sample borehole fluid, bu t sometime during the sampling run the tool failed under compression. Only the top connector from the tool returned to the surface, leaving almost $3\,\textrm{m}$ of tool behind. We then recovered the drill string, with the bit reaching the rig floor at $1450\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 June.  

A fishing tool BHA with a Gotco junk basket and two boot-typ e junk baskets was assembled to recover the Kuster FTS and lowere d to the seafloor, followed by deployment of the subsea camera an d sonar system for reentering Hole U1528D. Reentry was hampere d by a plume emanating from the funnel, but we successfully reentered at $0235\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 June. We then recovered the subsea camera system, picked up the top drive, and continued lowering the fishin g tool assembly to the bottom of the hole. We started circulating a t 335 mbsf and had to work the assembly through soft fill from 341 t o 350 mbsf, which was circulated out with high-viscosity mud sweeps. At 350.0 mbsf, we encountered hard fill. After washing/drillin g down, we tagged the final hole depth of 359.3 mbsf. The junk baske t was worked up and down with rotation and cycling the mud pump s on and off. We started pulling the drill string out of the hole at 094 5 h on 7 June, set back the top drive, and the drill string cleared th e seafloor at $1140~\mathrm{h}.$ . The Gotco junk basket came back with all th e fingers missing from the junk basket catchers. We emptied the boo t baskets and saved the contents, consisting of rock debris and mino r unidentifiable small pieces of metal. We then were confronted wit h $5\textrm{m}$ ship heave and had to wait for the weather to improve for $^{8\mathrm{~h~}}$ before starting to prepare for downhole measurements and borehole fluid sampling in Hole U1528D.  

At $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 June, we made up a logging BHA and lowered i t to the seafloor. We deployed the subsea camera system (along wit h the APCT-3 temperature shoe to monitor water column and bottom water temperatures), continued lowering the drill string, an d positioned the vessel for reentry. We maneuvered for more than $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ in poor visibility, due to a hydrothermal plume emerging from th e reentry funnel, but finally reentered Hole U1528D for the fourt h time at $0950\,\mathrm{h}$ . We tagged hard fill at 303 mbsf. We then picked u p the top drive and deployed the back-up $\left(600\mathrm{~mL}\right)$ ) Kuster FTS too l on the core line, successfully recovering a borehole fluid sample. The recovery was followed by lowering the ETBS, which measure d a maximum temperature of $212^{\circ}C$ . When the bit reached 323 mbsf, a high-viscosity mud sweep was circulated to clean the hole and th e bit was raised to 50.6 mbsf—inside the 13.375 inch casing. Th e HTTC tool string consisting of the LEH-MT (Logging Equipmen t Head-Mud Temperature Tool), EDTC (Enhanced Digital Telemetr y Cartridge), HNGS, and HLDS (Hostile-Environment Litho-Densit y Sonde) was assembled and lowered to 332 mbsf. Two upward logging passes were conducted, and the tools were back on the rig floo r at $0210\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 9 June. The logging tools were disassembled, cleaned, and secured.  

We then lowered the drill string back down to the bottom o f Hole U1528D in preparation for another Kuster FTS tool run an d encountered hard fill at 330 mbsf. The top drive was picked up, an d the end of the drill pipe was set at ${\sim}323$ mbsf. We deployed th e Kuster FTS tool and successfully recovered a borehole fluid sampl e from 313 mbsf. On breaking the drill string connection at the ri g floor, we measured an $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ concentration of $20~\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ . The connection was made back up, and the drill pipe was circulated out to clea r the drill string of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ . We then deployed the ETBS memory tool t o 313 mbsf, which yielded a maximum temperature measurement o f ${\sim}165^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (not equilibrated), following $15\;\mathrm{min}$ of stationary measurement. After recovering the ETBS tool, we started pulling the dril l string out of the hole and set back the top drive; the logging BH A cleared the seafloor at $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 June, and the bit arrived on th e rig floor at $1535\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

We then assembled a new 9.875 inch tricone bit BHA to clea n out Hole U1528D. We lowered the drill string and deployed the subsea camera and sonar system to aid in the reentry. We reentere d Hole U1528D for the fifth time at $2110\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 June. After the subse a camera was recovered, we picked up the top drive and lowered th e bit to 326 mbsf, where hard fill was encountered. The bit wa s worked down to $356.0\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , where we observed torque at the dept h of the top of the Kuster FTS tool that was left in the bottom of th e hole. After working the top of the tool remnants, two 30-barrel mu d sweeps were pumped, and the hole was circulated out. The bit wa s raised to 291.2 mbsf and the top drive was set back. We continue d to pull the drill string out of the hole, clearing the top of the reentr y funnel at $0535~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 June. The remainder of the drill string wa s pulled back to surface, and the bit cleared the rig floor at $0840~\mathrm{h}$ . The bit and the float were inspected at the rig floor. The bit was intact, with slight markings indicating its interaction with the Kuste r FTS remnants; however, the Baker float was severely damaged b y heat and all rubber components were disintegrating.  

We next assembled a milling bit and two boot-type junk basket s and lowered the drill string to the seafloor to attempt to clean th e Kuster FTS tool from the hole. We reentered Hole U1528D for th e sixth time at $1519~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 June, lowered the bit to 356 mbsf, an d started grinding up the Kuster FTS tool with the milling bit fro m 356 to 359 mbsf. No torque was observed during the milling. Afte r reaching 359 mbsf, we worked the junk basket multiple times, circulated high-viscosity mud sweeps, and started pulling the drill strin g out of the hole. The milling bit cleared the rig floor at $0225\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 1  

June. The junk baskets contained rock debris but no remnants of th e lost Kuster FTS tool.  

We then assembled the reverse-circulation junk basket (RCJB ) tool with twin boot-type baskets for a last attempt at clearing th e hole. At $0415~\mathrm{h}$ , we stopped operations due to storm-force wind s and high seas. The next $31.75\,\mathrm{h}$ were spent waiting for the weathe r to improve enough to continue operations.  

Once the weather had abated, we completed assembling th e RCJB tool BHA, lowered it to the seafloor, and deployed the subse a camera and sonar system to assist in positioning the ship for reentry. We reentered Hole U1528D for the seventh time at $1714\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 2 June. We continued lowering the drill string into the hole, retrieve d the subsea camera, picked up the top drive, and washed down fro m 327 to 352.3 mbsf. At this depth, we tagged hard fill that led to hig h torque. We continued attempting to work the drill string back to th e bottom of the hole, starting to divert the flow path on the RCJB a t $2100~\mathrm{h}$ . When we reached 359.3 mbsf, we pumped 25 barrels o f high-viscosity mud sweep, worked the RCJB BHA down to the bottom of Hole U1528D, and circulated for $15\;\mathrm{min}$ in an attempt to recover any parts of the lost Kuster FTS tool. At $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 June, w e started pulling the drill string out of the hole. The drill strin g cleared the seafloor at $0220\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . When the end of the drill string arrived back on the rig floor at $0405~\mathrm{h}$ , we discovered that the lowermost $172.8\mathrm{~m~}$ of the drill string was missing; this loss ended Hol e U1528D drilling operations. The drill string failed in a piece of  5 inch pipe above the BHA. Furthermore, the broken piece that wa s recovered showed significant damage from corrosion, likely due t o the acid and high $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ conditions encountered in the hole.  

After conducting operations at Sites U1530 and U1531, we returned to Hole U1528D to perform downhole temperature measurements and fluid sampling, marking our final science operation s of Expedition 376. At $^{1720\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 1 July, we lowered the drill string t o the floor of the pit crater and reentered Hole U1528D at $1805\,\mathrm{h}$ . W e lowered the end of the drill string to 27.2 mbsf and started an alternating series of temperature measurements and two borehole flui d sampling attempts. These measurements consisted of: (1) the ETB S memory tool, which tagged the bottom of the hole at 195 mbsf an d recorded a maximum temperature of $198^{\circ}C$ at $160~\mathrm{{mbsf},}$ , (2) th e Kuster FTS tool, which successfully recovered borehole fluid at 16 0 mbsf, (3) the Petrospec spool-in TCMT, which flooded and did no t obtain any data, (4) the Kuster FTS tool deployed at 160 mbsf agai n but returned empty to the ship due to the sample chamber valve s failing to close, and (5) another deployment of the Petrospec TCM T to a depth of 160 mbsf, where it recorded $156^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . We then pulled th e drill string out of the hole, and it cleared the seafloor at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on  2 July. Upon an ETBS memory tool deployment in Hole U1531E, w e returned one last time to Hole U1528D in an attempt to perfor m another Kuster FTS tool run. We abandoned the attempt when w e observed the Hole U1528D reentry funnel to be on its side on th e seafloor, ending all operations in this hole. A total of $391.5\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 16. 3 days, were recorded while in Hole U1528D.  

# Site U1529  

The original plan for Site U1529 (proposed Site WC-1A) was t o drill two holes. The first, pilot hole, was to core to ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ with th e RCB system. The second hole was dedicated to drilling-in a reentr y system to a depth determined by lithologies revealed by the pilo t hole to enable $565\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration at Site U1529. The actual operations consisted of RCB coring two pilot holes—Hole U1529A t o 12.0 mbsf and Hole U1529B to 34.4 mbsf—both of which had to b e abandoned because of poor hole conditions. Cores, penetratio n depths, and core recovery are listed in Table T2.  

# Hole U1529A  

After clearing the seafloor from Hole U1528C, the vessel move d slowly in DP mode from Site U1528 to Site U1529 while continuin g to recover the drill string. The $0.7\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ transit was done betwee n two periods of operations at Site U1528. Once the bit cleared the ri g floor at $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 May 2018, we made up the RCB BHA with  a new CC-7 RCB coring bit. A perforated brass insert that containe d fractured crystals wrapped in gold foil, supplied by the scienc e party, was installed in the bit prior to assembly into the BHA. It wa s hoped that these crystals would trap borehole fluids (as fluid inclusions) while coring. The bit was then lowered to just above the seafloor, and the subsea camera system was installed and run down t o conduct a survey at Site U1529. Prospective hole positions were located, and the seafloor was tagged to confirm the water depth. Upon recovery of the subsea camera system, Hole U1529A wa s spudded at $1610~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 May 2018 at a water depth of $1735.0\mathrm{~m~}$ . RCB coring began with a $12\textrm{m}$ core to allow us to make the firs t connection without clearing the seafloor. After Core 376-U1529A1R penetrated the seafloor to a depth of 12 mbsf and recovered 1.8 6 m of core $(15.5\%)$ , we measured high torque and had to work a tigh t hole from 12 mbsf back to the seafloor. We were unable to retriev e the core barrel, and the drill string had to be pulled out of the hol e because of poor hole conditions related to unconsolidated volcani c material. Hole U1529A ended when the bit cleared the seafloor a t $1925\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 May 2018. The core barrel was retrieved, and anothe r core barrel was dropped. A total of $15\,\mathrm{{h}}$ (0.6 d) were spent in Hol e U1529A.  

# Hole U1529B  

The vessel was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east, and RCB coring in Hole U1529 B started at a water depth of $1733.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ at $2030~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 May 2018. Cores 376-U1529B-1R to 3R penetrated from the seafloor to 34. 4 mbsf, with extremely poor total recovery of $0.6\mathrm{~m~}(2\%)$ . We onc e again experienced a tight hole at the bottom depth and attempted t o work the drill string back to ${\sim}15\mathrm{~m~}$ . We dropped a core barrel t o improve circulation; however, circulation was lost when the bit wa s at 15 mbsf. We decided to abandon Hole U1529B because the dril l bit and jets were plugged with debris and hole conditions were extremely unstable. We pulled the drill string out of the hole, and th e bit cleared the seafloor at $1015~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 May. The core barrel tha t was in place during the attempt to get back to the bottom of the hol e was then retrieved (i.e., ghost Core 4G; $8.17\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of lapilli-size d tephra). After two unsuccessful attempts to establish an adequat e pilot hole, coring operations at Site U1529 were abandoned. Th e drill string was pulled back to a water depth of $1116.5\mathrm{~m}_{:}$ , and th e vessel was moved in DP mode back to cased Hole U1528B where w e arrived at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 May. The total time spent in Hole U5129 B was $29.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.2 d).  

# Site U1530  

After the drill string cleared the seafloor from Hole U1528D a t $0220\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 June 2018, the vessel moved slowly in DP mode fro m Site U1528 to Site U1530 at the NW Caldera wall while we continued to recover the drill string. The transit was completed before th e end of the drill string reached the rig floor (officially ending Sit e U1528).  

The original plan for Site U1530 (proposed Site NWC-3A) wa s to drill two holes. The first, a pilot hole, was to core to ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ wit h the RCB system. The second hole was to install a reentry system t o a depth determined by lithologies intersected by the pilot hole t o allow $450\:\mathrm{m}$ of penetration. The actual operation involved RCB coring of only a single hole. Hole U1530A was RCB cored to the targe t depth of 453.1 mbsf without the need for installation of a reentr y system. Coring was then terminated and the bit was dropped in th e bottom of the hole. The ETBS tool and the Kuster FTS tool wer e deployed, followed by two wireline logging runs with both the tripl e combo and FMS-Sonic tool strings. At the conclusion of logging, w e deployed the Kuster FTS tool for borehole fluid sampling again an d tested the Petrospec TCMT to record borehole temperatures. Cores, penetration depths, and core recovery are listed in Table T2.  

# Hole U1530A  

An RCB BHA was assembled with a new CC-7 bit, into which  a perforated brass insert containing crystals to enable potential trapping of borehole fluids (supplied by the science party) had been installed.  

The RCB bit was lowered to just above the seafloor and the subsea camera and sonar system were deployed. A subsea survey fo r Site U1530 was conducted and three prospective hole position s were located. Seafloor tags were performed with the bit to verif y precise water depths of the seafloor at each hole position. The to p drive was picked up while the subsea camera system was retrieve d and secured at the surface. We then pumped a pig to clean out th e inside of the new pieces of drill string. The PFMD tracer pump wa s turned on and slow circulating pressure was recorded.  

RCB coring in Hole U1530A (water depth of $1594.4\;\mathrm{m})$ ) began a t $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 June with a $7.2\,\mathrm{m}$ mudline core to enable the first pip e connection to be made without clearing the seafloor. After a $9.7\textrm{m}$ cored interval that recovered Core 376-U1530A-2R, the decisio n was made to switch to half-length $\left(4.8\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ coring advances to maximize core recovery. Thirty barrels of high-viscosity mud sweep wer e pumped with every other core to keep the hole clean. Good hol e conditions remained throughout coring. These conditions continued to a final depth of 453.1 mbsf (Core 93R), resulting in a total o f $76.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(17\%)$ of core material recovered. Total depth for Hol e U1530A was reached at $0505\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 June 2018.  

After completion of coring to the target depth, another 30-barrel sweep of high-viscosity mud was pumped, followed by 30 barrel s of salt water and a second 30-barrel sweep of high-viscosity mud t o condition the hole for downhole measurements. The rotary shiftin g tool (RST) was lowered on the core line to release the bit in the bottom of the hole. The RST was then pulled back to the surface, an d the reverse RST tool was run to move the releasing sleeve back int o the circulating position. Because there were some conflicting indications as to whether the bit had actually released, an RCB core barrel was deployed and, after a few minutes of testing, it was verifie d that the bit had indeed released. Apparently, sufficient fill had accumulated underneath the end of the mechanical bit release (MBR) a t the end of the drill string to give a false indication. While laying ou t the RCB core barrel, damage to some of the strands of the corin g line were observed, so $150~\mathrm{m}$ of core line was cut and slipped. Th e sinker bars and the oil saver were reattached. The end of the drill string was spaced out one stand of drill pipe above the bottom o f Hole U1530A.  

The downhole measurement plan for Hole U1530A consisted o f running: (1) the ETBS tool, (2) the Kuster FTS tool, and (3) the tripl e combo (natural gamma ray, porosity, and density sondes). At $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 June, the ETBS was assembled and lowered to 429.1 mbs f where it was held stationary for $16\,\mathrm{{min}}$ before retrieval. The highes t temperature recorded was ${\sim}39.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . The Kuster FTS was then lowered at half the normal core line speed to just below the end of th e pipe ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom of the hole (i.e., depth of 436.1 mbsf). Circulation was stopped for ${\sim}20~\mathrm{min}$ to allow the clock timer to activate and the sample to be taken. Upon retrieval of the tool, it wa s determined that a cap screw of the upper valve assembly had unscrewed, preventing the lower valve from closing to collect a sample. The tool was repaired and readied for another sampling run a t the end of the logging activity.  

We then raised the end of the drill string to a depth of 67.1 mbsf, rigged up the drill floor for logging, and started preparing the tripl e combo tool string. The average heave was estimated to be $0.75\mathrm{~m~}$ just prior to logging. The active heave compensator was utilize d whenever the logging tools were in the open hole. A standard (lowtemperature) triple combo logging tool string was made up with th e following tools: HRLA (High-Resolution Laterolog Array), HLD S (Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde, with source), APS (Accelerator Porosity Sonde), HNGS (Hostile Environment Loggin g Natural Gamma Ray Spectroscopy Sonde), EDTC (Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge), and LEH-MT (Logging Equipment HeadMud Temperature Tool (model “mud temperature” [MT]).  

The tool string was lowered at $1820~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 June, and a downward logging pass was performed from just above seafloor to th e full accessible hole depth above fill at 442 mbsf. The hole was the n logged up for a $182\,\mathrm{m}$ calibration pass, lowered back to bottom (44 2 mbsf), and logged uphole with the triple combo tool string throug h the casing and drill string to the seafloor. The caliper was close d prior to entering the casing. The tools were pulled from the hole, cleared the seafloor at $2300\;\mathrm{h},$ and were rigged down by $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 20 June.  

A second tool string with the FMS was made up with the following logging tools: FMS (Formation MicroScanner), DSI (Dipol e Sonic Imager), HNGS, EDTC, and LEH-MT. Deployment of th e tool string commenced at $0140\,\mathrm{h}$ , and a downhole logging pass wit h the FMS calipers closed began just above the seafloor and extende d to 442 mbsf where fill was encountered ${\sim}11\;\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom o f the hole. Natural gamma ray was logged through the drill pipe t o identify the seafloor to match the depth results on the first loggin g run. At the depth of the fill, the first upward log was started an d logged from 442 to $\mathord{\sim}116$ mbsf with the FMS calipers open. Th e tools were run back down to 442 mbsf, and the second upward lo g was run with the calipers open. The calipers were closed just prio r to entering the drill pipe at 51.8 mbsf, and logging continued all th e way to the seafloor. The FMS-Sonic tool string returned to the ri g floor at $0725\,\mathrm{h}$ and was rigged down by $0830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June.  

Upon completion of downhole logging, the drill string was lowered back to the top of the fill at $442\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and the end of the pip e was pulled back to 428.2 mbsf. The Kuster FTS tool was lowered t o ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom of the hole with circulation stopped. Afte r waiting $15\,\mathrm{min}$ for the mechanical clock of the Kuster FTS to trigge r closure of the valves, the tool was pulled back to the rig floor, havin g successfully recovered a fluid sample.  

At $1245\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 20 June, the newly designed, high-temperatur e Petrospec spool-in TCMT was deployed for the first time on th e core line. While lowering the two thermocouple joints $8\;\mathrm{m}$ past th e end of the drill pipe to 447 mbsf, circulation was started at 2 0 strokes/min to cool the temperature-sensitive TCMT data logge r inside the drill string. After waiting $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ , the tool was pulled bac k into the pipe and returned to the surface. The TCMT recorded  a maximum temperature of $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . With the downhole measurement s complete, the drill string was pulled out of the hole and cleared th e seafloor at $1540\,\mathrm{h}$ . While the drill pipe was being tripped, we bega n moving the vessel slowly in DP mode to Site U1531 at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ . Th e end of the drill string (mechanical bit release) arrived back on th e rig floor at $2005~\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June 2018, ending Hole U1530A and thu s Site U1530. The total time spent on Hole U1530A was $184.0\;\mathrm{h},$ , o r 7.7 days.  

# Site U1531  

Site U1531 (proposed alternate Site LC-1A) consists of fiv e holes. The original plan for this site was to drill two holes: a pilo t hole to core to ${\sim}50\mathrm{~m~}$ with the RCB system and a second hole t o drill-in a reentry system to a depth based on conditions encountered in the pilot hole, followed by coring to $300~\mathrm{m}$ . Actual operations proved different from the plan. Hole U1531A was RCB core d to 15.0 mbsf into the saddle between the Upper and Lower Cone. Coring was terminated when we could not retrieve the first cor e barrel and had to pull clear of the seafloor because of high torqu e and high overpull.  

The second hole at Site U1531 reached 24.0 mbsf with Core 376- U1531B-3R, but hole conditions were very poor, with high torqu e and overpull during the entire interval in blocky, fragmented volcanic and volcaniclastic deposits. We then moved northeast, up th e slope of the Lower Cone ${\sim}110\ \mathrm{m}$ to its summit area and attempte d another pilot hole (U1531C). It was of very limited success, takin g only three cores to a depth of 28.4 mbsf. Again, high torque an d high overpull prevented coring further.  

We then decided to try drilling-in a reentry system through th e upper section of the formation. A reentry system and 13.375 inc h casing for Hole U1531D was drilled-in, but after releasing from th e hanger, we were unable to release from the casing, most probabl y because the underreamer arms failed to close completely. Forced t o pull out of the seafloor with the reentry system still attached, we offset $400\mathrm{~m~}$ east in case the system fell during retrieval. The syste m did fall to the seafloor just before it was recovered. It was later located during a seafloor camera survey to record its position.  

A second, similar reentry system was constructed for Hol e U1531E with $\mathord{\sim}15\;\mathrm{m}$ of 13.375 inch casing. We experienced simila r problems with releasing from the casing, but we were finally able t o do so. We attempted to test the CDEX TDCS, but a stuck core barrel at the beginning of the test forced us to abandon coring with th e TDCS. The RCB coring system was able to core to 39.6 mbsf, bu t there was high torque on the drill string throughout. Before w e could abandon coring, an equipment failure on the top drive drillin g system caused us to end coring slightly ahead of our planned termination time. After a short interlude, we returned to Site U1531 for  a downhole temperature measurement with the ETBS memory tool in Hole U1531E. The tool recorded a value similar to bottom seawater temperatures. A total of $264.25\ \mathrm{h},$ or 11.0 days, were spen t while at Site U1531.  

# Hole U1531A  

While we were recovering the drill string from Hole U1530A , we began moving the vessel to shallower water Site U1531 using th e dynamic positioning system. At $1806\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June, we arrived at Sit e U1531, located on the saddle between the Lower and Upper Cone o f Brothers volcano. The end of the drill string (mechanical bit release ) arrived back on the rig floor at $2005\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June (officially endin g Hole U1530A). We then reassembled the rig floor and conducted  a routine cut and slip of the drilling line, before we had to stop operations due to storm-force winds and high seas. The following $35.75\,\mathrm{h}$ were spent waiting for the weather to improve enough to continu e operations.  

At $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 June, we made up an RCB BHA and lowered i t to the seafloor at Site U1531. At $1430~\mathrm{h},$ , we deployed the subse a camera system to perform a seafloor survey and verify the exac t seafloor depth at three potential hole locations. After retrieving th e subsea camera system and picking up the top drive, we started RC B coring in Hole U1531A at $2030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 June. Core 376-U1531A-1 R penetrated from the seafloor to 15 mbsf, but we experienced excessive torque and overpull and had to pull the drill string out of th e hole. After the bit cleared the seafloor (at $2330\;\mathrm{h}$ ), we lowered th e core line to retrieve Core 1R $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $7\%$ ) at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 3 June. The time spent in Hole U1531A was $51.5~\mathrm{h}$ or 2.1 days, no t including the $35.75\,\mathrm{h}$ of waiting on weather.  

# Hole U1531B  

We then started RCB coring in Hole U1531B, with Cores 376- U1531B-1R to 3R penetrating from the seafloor to 26 mbsf and recovering $4.0\textrm{m}(15\%)$ . Drilling conditions were very poor, with hig h torque, overpull, and frequent stalling of the top drive; the dril l string became stuck several times. These conditions forced us t o start pulling the drill string out of the hole before Core 3R could b e retrieved. After the bit cleared the seafloor at $1420\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 June, w e recovered Core 3R, ending Hole U1531B. The time recorded i n Hole U1531B was $14.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (0.6 days).  

# Hole U1531C  

With the drill string just above the seafloor, we deployed th e subsea camera system, offset the vessel $110\,\mathrm{m}$ northeast to the summit of the Lower Cone, and started a seafloor survey at $1730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 3 June. During the survey, we tagged the seafloor in two locations t o verify the exact seafloor depth. We then retrieved the subsea camera system and started coring in Hole U1531C at $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 June. Cores 376-U1531C-1R to 3R penetrated from the seafloor to 28. 4 mbsf and recovered $2.25~\mathrm{m}$ $(8\%)$ . We circulated 30 barrels of highviscosity mud at several depths to clean the hole. We experience d tight hole conditions throughout coring, facing high torque and frequent overpull, so Hole U1531C was abandoned at 28.4 mbsf. A t $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 June, we started pulling the drill string out of the hole, and it cleared the seafloor at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ . We set back the top drive, continued raising the drill string, and the bit arrived at the rig floor a t $1340\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1531C. Inspection of the BHA revealed massive wear on the outside diameter of the bottom three drill collar s and the mechanical bit release. A total of $23.5~\mathrm{h},$ or 1.0 day, wer e recorded while in Hole U1531C.  

# Hole U1531D  

After ending Hole U1531C, we decided to install a reentry system with a short casing string to establish a stable hole in the summit area of the Lower Cone for deeper coring and loggin g objectives. We made up a drilling BHA with a 12.25 inch tricone bit, an 11.75 inch underreamer (set to 16.5 inches), and a mud motor. A t $2200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 June 2018, we assembled a reentry system with $16\,\mathrm{m}$ o f 13.375 inch casing, a reentry funnel, and a hard rock landing frame. After the drilling BHA was lowered through and attached to the reentry system, at $0500~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 June, we started lowering the entir e reentry system to the seafloor. At $0800\ \mathrm{h},$ we deployed the subse a camera and sonar system, continued lowering the drill-in casing assemblage, and picked up the top drive. We started drilling-in th e casing in Hole U1531D at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 June, reaching a total dept h of 19 mbsf at $1445~\mathrm{h}$ . We then deployed the go-devil to activate th e HRT and release the reentry system, but we were unable to pull th e drilling assembly clear of the casing string because the underreame r arms did not retract completely. We attempted to free the reentr y system for $3.5\,\mathrm{h}$ unsuccessfully, so we decided to pull the drill strin g and attached reentry system out of the hole and back to the vessel. After the bit cleared the seafloor at $1835\,\mathrm{h},$ we offset the vessel 40 0 m east. We set back the top drive, retrieved the subsea camera an d sonar system, and continued raising the drill string. While we wer e retrieving the casing and drilling assembly to the surface, the reentry system and casing unfortunately dropped off the drilling assembly at $2310\,\mathrm{~h~}$ in sight of the moonpool with doors open whil e picking up the last drill collar. We began taking apart the drillin g BHA, with the bit arriving back at the rig floor at $0045\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 June. A total of $35.00\,\mathrm{h},$ or 1.5 days, were recorded while in Hole U1531D.  

# Hole U1531E  

On 26 June 2018, we started making up a new drilling BHA wit h a 12.25 inch tricone bit, an 11.75 inch underreamer (set to 16. 5 inches), and a mud motor to drill-in $16\,\mathrm{m}$ of 13.375 inch casing int o Hole U1531E, located on the saddle between the Upper and Lowe r Cone of Brothers volcano. After testing the mud motor and underreamer at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 June, we had to stop operations for $7\,\mathrm{{h}}$ du e to inclement weather. At $1545~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{{r}}}$ , we began assembling the casin g string but had to stop operations again at $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ as the weather deteriorated. The next $24.25~\mathrm{h}$ were spent waiting for the weather t o improve enough to resume operations.  

At $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 June, we continued connecting the drilling BH A (mud motor, underreamer, and drill bit) to the casing string. Afte r welding the casing system, we attached the reentry funnel and har d rock landing skirt. We opened the moonpool doors and started lowering the casing and reentry system to the seafloor at $2350\,\mathrm{h}$ . Upo n deployment of the subsea camera and sonar system at $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 8 June, we continued lowering the casing assembly, picked up the to p drive, and positioned the vessel to start drilling. We started Hol e U1531E at $0705\,\mathrm{h}$ and by $1545\,\mathrm{h}$ had drilled-in to $17.9\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , working through tight spots. We then deployed the go-devil to activat e the HRT to release the drilling assembly from the casing. We wer e initially not able to retrieve the drilling assembly from the casin g string and had to work the drilling assembly to get the underreame r arms to close. After it released from the casing at $1605\,\mathrm{h}$ , we raise d the drill string above the top of the reentry funnel and observed tha t the casing had been lifted $4.2\textrm{m}$ while we were trying to release. This lifting of the casing left the base of the casing shoe at 10.7 mbsf. We then recovered the subsea camera, set back the top drive, an d recovered the drill string to the rig floor. We flushed the mud moto r and underreamer with freshwater and disassembled the HRT components and the BHA.  

At $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 June, we began making up the CDEX TDCS fo r running a second test during this expedition. We assembled th e TDCS core barrels and BHA, including a 9.875 inch PDC bit. W e started lowering the TDCS BHA to the seafloor at $0530\,\mathrm{h},$ deploye d the subsea camera and sonar system, and picked up the top drive. We then reconfigured the TDCS core barrels and conducted a “dro p test” deployment (i.e., dropped the core barrel and retrieved it prio r to reentry). We reentered Hole U1531E at $1347~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 June, lowered the drill string to ${\sim}8$ mbsf, and flushed the interior of the casing. While recovering the subsea camera, we checked for fill belo w the end of the casing at 10.7 mbsf. At $1430\,\mathrm{h},$ , we deployed a TDC S core barrel, washed down to the bottom of the hole at $17.9\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ flushed it with two back-to-back high-viscosity mud sweeps, and retrieved the TDCS core barrel (ghost Core 376-U1531E-2G; $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$ o f fresh dacite pebbles). The next TDCS barrel got stuck in the BH A and could not be recovered after three attempts. We then terminated the TDCS test and started pulling the drill string out of th e hole. It cleared the seafloor at $2045~\mathrm{h}$ . We set back the top drive, recovered the drill string, and the bit arrived back on the rig floor a t $0110\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 June.  

We then made up an RCB coring system BHA and started lowering it down to the seafloor. We deployed the subsea camera an d sonar system to aid in reentry of Hole U1531E. We then continue d lowering the drill string, picked up the top drive, and reentered Hol e U1531E at $1133~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 June. After recovering the subsea camera, we reassembled the rig floor, pumped 40 barrels of high-viscosit y mud sweep to clean the hole, and lowered the bit until it encountered hard fill at 9 mbsf (inside the casing). At $1245~\mathrm{h},$ , we droppe d an RCB core barrel and washed back to bottom of the hole at 17. 9 mbsf (Core 376-U1531E-4G; $0.15\,\mathrm{~m~}$ dacitic lapilli). We then cu t half-length ( $\leftmoon.8\:\mathrm{m}$ advances) Cores 376-U1531E-5R to 9R from 17. 9 to 39.6 mbsf and recovered $0.8\textrm{m}$ $(4\%)$ . We had to pump multipl e high-viscosity mud sweeps to keep the bottom of the hole clean t o be able to keep coring. Hole conditions were very poor. After recovering Core 9R, the top drive blower motor seized with a bad bearing. We began repairs $\mathrm{^4.75~h}$ of downtime) but then evaluated th e repair time versus the remaining coring time. We concluded corin g activities and began other operations. We released the bit in Hol e U1531E and then shifted the circulating sleeve back into the circulating position. After releasing the bit, we pulled the drill string ou t of the hole with the top drive installed, clearing the seafloor an d ending coring operations in Hole U1531E at $1435\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 July 2018.  

We then left Hole U1531E and transited to Hole U1528D fo r fluid sampling and temperature measurements. After completin g operations in Hole U1528D, we returned to Hole U1531E at $0745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 July. We lowered the drill string with the top drive installed an d reentered Hole U1531E at $1015~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 July. We then lowered th e ETBS memory tool into the hole with the core line for a temperature profile. After completing the ETBS tool run, which yielded  a stationary temperature measurement of $5\mathrm{{C}}$ at $20~\mathrm{mbsf},$ we pulle d the drill string out of the hole and cleared the seafloor at $1135~\mathrm{h}$ . The drill string was pulled back to 1149 mbsl with the top drive installed. We then began the transit back to U1528D, ending Hol e U1531E at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 July 2018. A total of $139.5\,\mathrm{h},$ or 5.8 days, wer e spent on Hole U1531E.  

# Education and outreach  

Expedition 376 had two Education and Outreach Officers o n board: an education tour guide from Wellington, New Zealand, an d a high school teacher from Florida, USA. The officers communicated the scientific objectives of the expedition with audiences of al l ages from around the world via live video broadcasts and social media posts and also developed classroom resources and other educational products for students at all age levels.  

Live ship-to-shore video broadcasts to classrooms and museums were conducted using tablets (iPads) with the videoconferencing software Zoom and Google Hangouts. Fifty-four video session s were conducted reaching an estimated 2700 students, teachers, an d museum patrons. A typical session included a brief background explanation of the location of Brothers volcano and reasons for drilling, followed by a core flow tour. Scientists and lab technician s working in the science laboratories participated in every session, which allowed participants to make questions directly to the scientists and lab technicians. Survey responses from participants indicated that they found the objectives of the expedition clearl y explained; they learned about science content, process, and careers; and the programs exceeded their expectations. Respondents also indicated that the programs helped them to meet the relevant stat e and local education standards. In addition, GNS Science hosted  a series of four broadcasts on shore at the Museum of New Zealan d Te Papa Tongarewa. These events covered the key research areas o f Expedition 376 and were introduced on shore with a presentatio n from an expert in the field. These events were attended by 150 people and received strong positive feedback from those who attended.  

The Education and Outreach Officers maintained four socia l media sites for the duration of the expedition: a Facebook pag e $(\@]$ OIDES Resolution), a Twitter feed $\left(\varpi\mathrm{The}\right)\mathrm{R})$ , an Instagram account (@joides_resolution), and a blog at http://joidesresolution.org. Outreach Officers created more than 62 Facebook posts , and the number of Facebook followers increased by $3.5\%$ over the  2 months of the expedition. The team also hosted two Facebook Liv e video streams, with an average 400 viewers per stream. These liv e video sessions provided the general public with the unique ability t o directly engage with the team on the ship and receive nearly instan t responses to their questions. A total of 73 Twitter posts were made, with $\mathord{\sim}144$ new Twitter followers added. A total of 30 Instagra m posts were made on the JOIDES Resolution account, garnering dozens of new followers. The Outreach Officers produced 33 blog post s on the JOIDES Resolution website, including five guest blogs writte n by science party members. The team also hosted an “Ask Me Anything” session on Reddit, answering 20 questions from the publi c over the course of $2\,\mathrm{h},$ with the help of four members of the scienc e party.  

In addition to the video broadcasts and social media, the Education and Outreach Officers created their own focused products. The USA high school teacher developed multiple lesson plans wit h a focus on submarine volcanoes and hydrothermal vents. These lesson plans will be hosted on the JOIDES Resolution website unde r the “For Educators” page, and though geared toward secondar y school students, will be easily adaptable for many age groups. Th e museum educator developed a $360^{\circ}$ tour of the JOIDES Resolution for YouTube, a series of microbe infographics for the JOIDES Resolution website, and produced a video in Te Reo Māori about IODP.  

The Education and Outreach Officers each created a series o f STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics ) based artworks. The New Zealand officer produced a set of micrographs from thin sections of hard rocks from Brothers volcano, which were shared on the JOIDES Resolution blog and social media. The USA officer created a set of acrylic pour paintings, utilizing th e movement of the ship to distribute the paint across the canvas. Th e painting process and photographs of completed paintings wer e shared on the JOIDES Resolution blog page, as well as social medi a sites.  

Education and outreach activities will continue on shore, wit h development of additional school curricula to be shared on the JOIDES Resolution website. The USA Education and Outreach Office r will participate at IODP’s booth and conduct teacher outreach activities at the National Science Teachers Association annual conference in St. Louis, MO, from 11 to 14 April 2019. The New Zealan d Outreach Officer has developed a card game involving extremophile microbes and environments, such as Brothers volcano, an d will produce a deck and a rule-set resource for future publication o n the JOIDES Resolution website.  

Media covered Expedition 376 during both port calls, includin g national TV and radio as well as national/international web an d newspapers (e.g., The Sydney Morning Herald). At the time of th e publication of this report, 17 media stories have been recorded i n total.  Updates can be  continuously retrieved  fro m http://iodp.tamu.edu/outreach/index.html.

Figure F14. Salinity (NaCl equivalent ${\sf W t}\%$ ) versus homogenization temperature and corresponding enthalpy of $N a C l-H_{2}O$ (Bischoff and Rosenbauer, 1985) fo r fluid inclusions from anhydrite, gypsum, and alunite recovered from Site U1528. The critical line divides the diagram into the supercritical and subcritica l zones. The NaCl saturation curve was calculated from Driesner and Heinrich (2007) and the NaCl vapor conjugate curve from Bischoff (1991). Phase separatio n (boiling) curves are calculated for seawater (bc1), seawater $\mathrm{(sw)}+0.22\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ (bc2), $33\,\mathsf{w t}\%$ NaCl equivalent hypersaline brine (bc3) and $33\,\mathsf{w t}\%$ NaCl equivalent hypersaline brine $+\,0.22\mathsf{m}\,\mathsf{C}\mathsf{O}_{2}$ . Also shown is a broken line with arrow indicative of salinities caused by vapor condensation under subcritical conditions.

Figure F20. Salinity (NaCl equivalent ${\sf W t}\%$ ) versus homogenization temperature and corresponding enthalpy of $N a C l-H_{2}O$ (Bischoff and Rosenbauer, 1985) fo r fluid inclusions from anhydrite, Site U1530. The critical line divides the diagram into the supercritical and subcritical zones. The NaCl saturation curve wa s calculated from Driesner and Heinrich (2007) and the NaCl vapor conjugate curve from Bischoff (1991). Phase separation (boiling) curves are calculated fo r seawater and for 41 wt% NaCl equivalent hypersaline brine (bc1). Salinities measured near the seawater line may be due to condensation from a supercritica l NaCl vapor. Hypersaline brine salinities above the NaCl saturation curve may be caused by boiling (bc1) or a NaCl brine with additional major cations such as  K (line NK).
