# Abstract  

The primary objectives of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 367/368 to the northern South China Se a (SCS) margin were to (1) examine its history of continental breaku p and (2) compare it with other nonvolcanic or magma-poor rifte d margins with the broader goal of testing models for continenta l breakup. A secondary objective was to further our understanding o f the paleoceanographic and environmental development of the SC S and southeast Asia during the Cenozoic. Four primary sites were selected for the overall program: one in the outer margin high (OMH ) and three seaward of the OMH on distinct, margin-parallel basement ridges. These three ridges are informally labeled A, B, and  C and are located in the continent–ocean transition (COT) zone ranging from the OMH to the interpreted steady-state oceanic crus t (Ridge C) of the SCS. The main scientific objectives include the following:  

• Determining the nature of the basement in crustal units across the COT of the SCS that are critical to constrain style of rifting, • Constraining the time interval from initial crustal extension and plate rupture to the initial generation of igneous ocean crust, • Constraining vertical crustal movements during breakup, and • Examining the nature of igneous activity from rifting to seafloor spreading.  

In addition, the sediment cores from the drill sites targeting primarily tectonic and basement objectives will provide informatio n on the Cenozoic regional environmental development of the Southeast Asia margin.  

Site U1499 on Ridge A and Site U1500 on Ridge B were drille d during Expedition 367. Expedition 368 was planned to drill at tw o primary sites (U1501 and U1503) at the OMH and Ridge C, respectively, but based on drilling results from Expedition 367, Expeditio n 368 chose to insert an alternate site on Ridge A (Site U1502). In addition, Expedition 368 added two more sites on the OMH (Site s U1504 and U1505). Expedition 367/368 completed operations at si x of the seven sites (U1499–U1502, U1504, and U1505). Site U1503, however, was not completed beyond casing without coring to $990\,\mathrm{m}$ because of mechanical problems with the drilling equipment tha t prevented the expedition, after 25 May 2017, from operating with  a drill string longer than $3400\;\mathrm{m}$ . New alternate Site U1504, propose d during Expedition 367, met this condition. Original Site U1505 als o met the operational constraints of the $3400\:\mathrm{m}$ drill string (total) an d was an alternate site for the already-drilled Site U1501.  

At Site U1499, we cored to $1081.8\mathrm{~m~}$ in 22.1 days with $52\%$ recovery and then logged downhole data from 655 to $1020\ \mathrm{m}$ . In 3 1 days at Site U1500, we penetrated to $1529\,\mathrm{m}$ , cored a total of 1012. 8 m with $37\%$ recovery, and collected log data from 842 to $1133\;\mathrm{m}.$ . A t Site U1501, we cored to $697.1\;\mathrm{m}$ in 9.4 days with $78.5\%$ recovery. W e also drilled ahead for $433.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ in Hole U1501D and then logge d downhole data from 78.3 to $399.3\;\mathrm{m}$ . In 19.3 days at Site U1502, w e penetrated $1679.0\ \mathrm{m}$ in Holes U1502A $(758\textrm{m})$ and U1502B (92 1 m), set $723.7\mathrm{~m~}$ of casing and cored a total of $576.3\mathrm{~m~}$ with $53.5\%$ recovery, and collected downhole log data from 785.3 to $875.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and seismic data through the $10\%$ inch casing. At Site U1503, w e penetrated $995.1\;\mathrm{m}$ and set $991.5\,\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing, but no core s were taken because of a mechanical problem with the drawworks. At Site U1504, we took 40 rotary core barrel (RCB) cores over tw o holes. The cored interval between both holes was $277.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wit h $26.8\%$ recovery. An $88.2~\mathrm{m}$ interval was drilled in Hole U1504B. A t Site U1505, we cored $668.0\ \mathrm{m}$ with $101.1\%$ recovery. Logging dat a was collected from 80.1 to $341.2~\mathrm{m}$ . Operations at this site covere d 6.1 days. Except for Sites U1503 and U1505, all sites were drilled t o acoustic basement. A total of 6.65 days were lost due to mechanica l breakdown or waiting on spare supplies for repair of drilling equipment, but drilling options were severely limited from 25 May to th e end of the expedition by the defective drawworks limiting deployment of drill string longer than $3400\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

At Site U1499, coring ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{m}$ into the interpreted acoustic basement sampled sedimentary rocks, possibly including early Miocen e chalks underlain by Oligocene polymict breccias and poorly cemented gravels of unknown age comprising sandstone pebbles an d cobbles. Preliminary structural and lithologic analysis suggests tha t the gravels might be early to late synrift sediment. At Site U1500, the main seismic reflector corresponds to the top of a basalt sequence at ${\sim}1379.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . We cored $149.90\:\mathrm{m}$ into this volcanic packag e and recovered $114.92\;\mathrm{~m~}$ $(77\%)$ of sparsely to moderately plagioclase-phyric basalt comprising numerous lava flows, includin g pillow lavas with glass, chilled margins, altered veins, hyaloclastites, and minor sediment. Preliminary geochemical analyses indicat e that the basalt is tholeiitic.  

Sampling of the Pleistocene to lower Miocene sedimentary section at Sites U1499 and U1500 was not continuous for two reasons. First, there was extremely poor recovery in substantial intervals interpreted to be poorly lithified sands, possibly turbidites. Second, we chose to drill down without coring in some sections at Sit e U1500 to ensure sufficient time to achieve this site’s high-priorit y deep drilling objectives. The upper Miocene basin sequence, whic h consists of interbedded claystone, siltstone, and sandstone can b e correlated between the two sites by seismic stratigraphic mappin g and biostratigraphy.  

At Site U1501 on the OMH, coring ${\sim}45\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into the acousti c basement sampled prerift(?) deposits comprising sandstone to conglomerate of presumed Mesozoic age. These deposits are overlai n by siliciclastic synrift sediments of Eocene to Oligocene age followed by primarily carbonaceous postrift sediments of early Miocene to Pleistocene age. Site U1502 on Ridge A was cased to 723. 7 m. No coring was attempted shallower than $380~\mathrm{m}$ to save operational time and because of low expectations for core recovery in th e upper Plio–Pleistocene sequence. At this site, we recovered $180~\mathrm{m}$ of hydrothermally altered brecciated basalts comprising sheet an d pillow lavas below deep-marine sediments of Oligocene to late Miocene age. At Site U1503 on Ridge C, $991.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of casing was installe d in preparation for the planned deep drilling to ${\sim}1800\;\mathrm{m}$ . No corin g was performed due to mechanical failures, and the site was abandoned without further activity except for installation of a reentr y cone. Coring at Site U1504 on the OMH, located ${\sim}45\,\mathrm{km}$ east of Sit e U1501, recovered mostly foliated, greenschist facies metamorphi c rocks below late Eocene(?) carbonate rocks (partly reef debris) an d early Miocene to Pleistocene sediments. At Site U1505, we cored t o $480.15\,\mathrm{~m~}$ through Pleistocene to late Oligocene mainly carbonaceous ooze followed at depth by early Oligocene siliciclastic sediments.  

Efforts were made at every drill site to correlate the core wit h the seismic data and seismic stratigraphic unconformities interpreted in the Eocene to Plio–Pleistocene sedimentary sequenc e prior to drilling. The predrilling interpretation of ages of these unconformities was in general confirmed by drilling results, althoug h some nontrivial corrections can be expected from detailed postexpedition work on integrating seismic stratigraphic interpretation s with detailed bio- and lithostratigraphy.  

As a result of the limited length of drill string that could be deployed during the later part of Expedition 368, the secondary expedition objectives addressing the environmental history of the SC S and Southeast Asia received more focus than originally planned, allowing Site U1505 (alternate to Site U1501) to be included. Despit e this change in focus, Expedition 367/368 provided solid evidenc e for a process of breakup that included vigorous synrift magmatis m as opposed to the often-favored interpretation of the SCS margin a s a magma-starved margin or a margin possibly overprinted at  a much later stage by plume-related magmatism. In this broader perspective, Expedition 367/368 accomplished a fundamental objectiv e of the two-expedition science program.  

# Introduction  

The South China Sea (SCS) margin (Figure F1) is an accessibl e and seismically well-imaged location where drilling of synrift sediment and underlying basement will provide key constraints on th e processes of rifting and eventual rupturing of the continental lithosphere during breakup at a highly extended rifted margin. Expedition 367/368 was based on International Ocean Discovery Progra m (IODP) drilling Proposals 878-CPP, 878-Add, 878-Add2, and 878- Add3. This project was implemented as a single science progra m with 114 days of drilling operations spread across two IODP expeditions as outlined in the Expedition 367/368 Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Two expeditions were required to drill four highpriority, deep-penetration sites in a transect across the margin. O f these, three sites targeted acoustic basement in the continent– ocean transition (COT), and one site targeted prerift through synrift to postrift sequences on the landward side of the transect. Although  the  primary  focus  of  this  drilling  expedition  was  t o discriminate among possible models for rifting and plate rupture, the drilling, along with results from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP ) Leg 184 and IODP Expedition 349, addressed a secondary objectiv e to improve our understanding of the Cenozoic environmental evolution of the southeast Asian area as recorded in the sediments o f the SCS basin.

Global questions regarding formation of rifted margins  

ODP (1985–2003) made a major effort along the rifted margin s of the North Atlantic to understand the processes of continenta l breakup (ODP Legs 103, 104, 149, 152, 163, 173, and 210). This effort resulted in the recognition of two end-members of rifted margins (see summary of observations in Sun et al., 2016a, 2016b).  

The first recognized end-member is referred to as a volcani c rifted margin, examples of which are characterized by massive igneous activity in a relatively short period of time (\~1–3 million years ) during breakup and initial seafloor spreading. The pair of conjugat e margins of Greenland and northwest Europe is a type example. I n these locations, the asthenospheric mantle may have been anomalously hot (e.g., mantle plumes), leading to thermal weakening of th e continental lithosphere followed by rapid plate rupture (Duncan, Larsen, Allan, et al., 1996; Eldholm et al., 2000; Geoffroy, 2005).  

The second recognized end-member is the hyperextended, magma-poor rifted margin, which is interpreted to endure hyperextension of the continental crust, with tectonic extension at the dista l margin leading eventually to serpentinization and exhumation o f the subcontinental mantle. The Newfoundland and Iberia conjugat e margin, where serpentinized exhumed mantle occupies a broa d zone in the COT, is an example of this type of margin (Boillot, Winterer, et al., 1988; Whitmarsh, Sawyer, Klaus, and Masson, 1996; Beslier, Whitmarsh, Wallace, and Girardeau, 2001). However, it i s the only conjugate margin pair where geophysical interpretation ha s been confirmed by scientific drilling. The introduction of water t o the subcontinental lithospheric mantle is interpreted to have take n place through deep, crust-cutting faults, causing serpentinizatio n that profoundly weakens the mantle lithosphere and facilitates plat e rupture. The subsequent ultraslow spreading led to formation of additional serpentinite on the seafloor (e.g., Dick et al., 2003) until sufficient magma production for normal oceanic crust to form wa s established.  

Other examples of hyperextended rifted margins have been interpreted from seismic reflection data (e.g., Brune et al., 2017; Dor é and Lundin, 2015). However, it is not known if serpentinized mantl e plays a critical role in all cases. Modeling by Huismans and Beaumont (2008, 2011) suggests several scenarios for the formation o f rifted margins in the absence of anomalously hot asthenospheri c mantle. One scenario (Type I of Huismans and Beaumont, 2011) i s the Iberia-Newfoundland-type margin described above. In thi s case, lithospheric thinning initially occurs in the (upper) crust, wit h extensional faults profoundly thinning the continental crust (hyperextension) and eventually reaching the mantle and causing serpentinization (Whitmarsh et al., 2001; Pérez-Gussinyé and Reston, 2001;  Pérez-Gussinyé  et  al.,  2006;  Reston,  2009;  Sutra  an d Manatschal, 2012). The schematic model of this type of margin development, shown in Figure F2, guided the drilling strategy of Expedition 367/368. Huismans and Beaumont (2008, 2011), however, also suggest that final plate rupture can occur without exhumatio n of the subcontinental mantle and can be followed rather quickly b y igneous oceanic crust formation, a scenario that our chosen drillin g strategy also tested. The highly extended northern margin of th e SCS is therefore an excellent location to examine through drillin g whether this margin experienced magmatism during breakup or it s development is closer to the Iberia-type, amagmatic margin.  

# Geological setting  

The SCS is a modestly sized young ocean basin that forme d along the eastern boundary of the Eurasian plate during mid- to lat e Cenozoic time (Figure F1). Expedition 367/368 cored and logged  a transect of drill sites across the COT in the northern SCS (Figur e F3).  

Before the continental crust rifted to form the present SCS , there used to be a subduction zone in the late Mesozoic along th e southeast part of the South China block (Zhou and Li, 2000; Zho u et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b). This relatively young continental lithosphere subsequently underwent extensive rifting during th e Paleogene, likely in the Eocene and early Oligocene. Seafloo r spreading in the SCS started during the Oligocene, with the oldes t interpreted magnetic anomaly in the area of the drilling transect interpreted to be Anomaly C11 ${\sqrt{\sim\!29.5\,\mathrm{Ma}}})$ or possibly C12n (\~31 Ma ) (Briais et al., 1993; Li et al., 2013, 2014; Franke et al., 2013). Seafloo r spreading then started to propagate into the Southwest Subbasin a t ${\sim}23\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Briais et al., 1993; Barckhausen and Roeser, 2004; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b; Franke et al., 2013).  

The initial half-spreading rate may have been as high a s ${\sim}3.6\ \mathrm{cm/y},$ later slowing to $1.2\,\mathrm{\cm/y}$ with seafloor spreading t o eventually cease by ${\sim}15~\mathrm{Ma}$ (Li et al., 2014). The initial spreadin g rate in the SCS basin is therefore higher than the ultraslow spreading scenario of the Iberia-Newfoundland margin (Dick et al., 2003).

The Expedition 367/368 drillin g strategy was designed to sample and test whether or not these fundamenta l crustal units and tectonic relationships are present at the northern SCS rifte d margin.

Subduction of the eastern part of the SCS basin started at or befor e ${\sim}15$ Ma along the Manila Trench (Li et al., 2013). For a more complete review of the regional setting and tectonic development of th e SCS, see Shi and Li (2012), Franke et al. (2013), Li et al. (2013), an d Sun et al. (2014).  

The Expedition 367/368 drilling transect is located ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{km}$ wes t of IODP Site U1435 along the northern SCS margin (Figures F1, F3 ) (Li et al., 2015a, 2015b). A transform fault defines a western boundary of a margin segment that exhibits a broad zone of crustal extension (Figure F4). This broad zone of extension (COT) may end t o the east somewhere between Sites U1432 and U1435. East of thi s position, continental crust seems to thin into ocean crust in a muc h narrower COT. It is therefore conceivable that a kind of crusta l transform zone is present in this location and defines an eastern en d of a margin segment characterized by a high degree of crustal extension.  

The segment of the SCS margin addressed by Expeditio n 367/368 is characterized by a relatively broader COT $\left({\sim}80~\mathrm{km}\right)$ o f crustal stretching and extension (Figure F5) prior to breakup an d stretches for nearly $100~\mathrm{\km}$ between longitudes $115^{\circ}35^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ an d $116^{\circ}30^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ . A deep sag basin (midslope basin [MSB]) of presume d Eocene to Oligocene age is present in the midslope area and i s bounded seaward by an outer margin high (OMH), forming a quit e persistent structure along the margin. Three distinct ridges (A, B, and C in Figure F4) are found seaward of the OMH in the more distal margin and on progressively thinner crust in the COT. We refe r

to the continent/ocean boundary (COB) as the much narrower zon e in which the outermost, highly thinned continental lithosphere i s replaced seaward by new crust that formed in a narrow zone at  a spreading ridge in a steady-state fashion. The latter can include continuous tectonic exhumation of rising lithospheric or asthenospheric mantle (e.g., Dick et al., 2003), accretion of normal igneou s oceanic crust, or a mixture of these two processes. Constraining th e nature and location of the COB at the SCS will require integrate d interpretation of deep crustal reflection normal and wide-angle incidence seismic data and deep sampling by drilling.

Propose d drilling transect (thick black line) was located approximately at the center o f a margin segment bounded to the southwest by a transform fault. Northeastern boundary of margin segment is located around Expedition 349 Sit e U1435. In this location, the outer margin high and Ridge A seem to coalesce, and Ridges B and C of the COT become indistinct toward the northeas t within the next margin segment. Note that outer margin high is slightl y east-northeast to the more parallel Ridges A, B, and C.  

![](images/8f2df4533dd846f5e3d3530530a810142324d185d6feb2559e56c51b773dd2fa.jpg)  
The clear seismic reflections from the Mohorovičić seismic discontinuity (Moho) show distinct thinning of the continental crus t (Figure F5) across the COT with a thickness of ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}$ around th e seaward end. Separate layers hypothesized to be upper, middle, an d lower crust are present in the landward part of these seismic pro  

files. The lower crust is acoustically transparent and may in place s be as thin as ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}$ . Lower crust with a similar thickness and seismic appearance is reported from the northeastern SCS margi n (McIntosh et al., 2013, 2014; Lester et al., 2013). The seaward continuation of this crustal layering into the COB is, however, ambiguous, and prevents us from interpreting the detailed nature of th e COB at this point.  

The upper crust shows numerous extensional, low-angle detachment faults soling out at midcrustal levels. This fault syste m generated a number of deep half-grabens filled with synrift sediments that were subsequently covered by postrift sediments. Th e boundary between synrift and postrift sediments may follow th e seismic stratigraphic unconformity named T70 (Figure F5). Industry data from distant wells suggest a breakup unconformity age o f ${\sim}34$ Ma. However, this age of T70 may be subject to revision, and i n addition, the time of crustal extension is not necessarily synchronous across the margin and could be younger toward the outer margin. A younger, widely distributed unconformity (T60) is also show n in Figure F5. The T60 unconformity corresponds to a hiatus at ${\sim}23$ Ma found at ODP Site U1148 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2000) an d IODP Site U1435. T60 is approximately synchronous with a southward jump of the SCS spreading axis (Briais et al., 1993). However, the age of T60 may also be subject to revision, and the relationshi p between a ridge jump and a margin-wide unconformity and seismi c sequence boundary remains speculative at this point.  

The OMH hosts a number of relatively shallow half-graben basins on top of this broad basement high. The stratigraphy of thes e smaller basins can be traced seismically into the deeper, central basin sag below the MSB (Figure F5). The normal faults boundin g these OMH basins are clearly imaged and, for the main part, di p seaward. These small rift basins, therefore, offer an opportunity t o sample the stratigraphy covering the entire period of rifting an d postrift subsidence. The MSB itself is bounded landward by major, seaward-dipping normal fault(s) seemingly forming major detachments soling out at middle to lower crustal levels but not penetrating through the lower crust. This suggests decoupling between th e upper and lower crust and, at least in this more landward part of th e margin, faults never penetrated the lower crust, which may have remained ductile and resistant to faulting.  

The lower crust in the COT may thicken seaward (lower crusta l flow?), but this interpretation is not well constrained (Figure F5) . Likewise, seismic imaging of the low-angle faults and detachment s in the landward part of the COT cannot, with confidence, be trace d into the distal margin regime south of the OMH. One possibility i s that the main detachment zone was located above what later became Ridge A, effectively implying that Ridge A is a core comple x consisting of lower continental crust or subcontinental mantle, depending on how deeply detachments exhumed the lithosphere i n the distal margin. Alternatively, if the main detachment underlie s Ridge A, this structure would represent upper plate material of upper crustal origin.  

Ridge A is for the most part dome-like, showing neither norma l faults nor clearly developed synrift half-grabens like the OMH. Excluding postrift sediments, the crust below this outermost basement  high  is  only ${\sim}6{-}8\ \ \mathrm{km}$ thick  using  the  ocean-botto m seismometer velocity constraints of Yan et al. (2001), Wang et al. (2006), and Wei et al. (2011). Seaward of Ridge A and across ridge s B and C, the crust has a fairly uniform thickness of ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}.$ , whic h could be consistent with oceanic crust (Yan et al., 2001). The oldes t linear magnetic anomaly that can be confidently mapped along thi s margin segment is interpreted as magnetic Chron C11n based o n  

Figure F5. Deep crustal time-migrated seismic reflection data without and with interpretation. Note the rather thin lower crust (two layers) above a stron g Mohorovičić seismic discontinuity (Moho) reflector that can be followed oceanward. Moho reflection is weak to absent seaward from around the interprete d COT. Wide-angle seismic data (Yan et al., 2001) confirm ${\sim}6$ km thick ocean crust (OC) seaward of the COT. A large detachment fault ${\sim}150\,\mathsf{k m}$ inland of the CO T separates more stable crust landward from that of highly extended crust seaward. An OMH is a fairly consistent feature along this margin segment. Key seismi c unconformities are shown in purple $(\mathsf{T}70;{\sim}32$ Ma breakup unconformity?) and blue (T60; $^{\sim}23$ Ma regional basin event). These ages are inferred from longdistance $(>\mid00\mid\mathsf{k m})$ correlation of seismic unconformities with industry holes and ODP Leg 184 Site 1148 (T60); ages need confirmation by coring and are onl y tentative.

total magnetic field data; the corresponding magnetic high is located ${\sim}10~\mathrm{km}$ seaward (south) of Ridge B (Figure F5). However, i f this position is corrected by deskewing the magnetic data, the magnetic high corresponding to C11n with an age of ${\sim}29.5{-}30\ \mathrm{Ma}$ wil l be located more or less on top of Ridge B (Figure F5).  

Both Ridges B and C consist of fault blocks tilted landward alon g seaward-dipping normal faults (Figure F5). Ridge B shows seismi c features along strike and in the uppermost crust that could be consistent with a volcanic origin. However, without drilling constraints, these features could also be interpreted as prerift deposits below th e seismic unconformity that defines the top of acoustic basement a t Ridge B. Ridge C is seismically similar in many ways to Ridge B. However, an apparent reversed magnetic anomaly (C10r; $\mathord{\sim}29$ Ma ) strongly suggests that this ridge indeed represents close to if not ful l igneous oceanic crust.  

Sampling the basement at Ridges A, B, and C was therefore essential for Expedition 367/368 to distinguish between different tectonic models for breakup along highly extended margins. Ridges  A and B in particular help constrain the style of rifting and to determine if the SCS margin indeed succeeded to the stage of a hyperextended margin or not. Ridge C is assumed to represent the earl y igneous crust, and samples from this ridge will constrain the natur e of early oceanic crust formation, specifically how quickly a robus t igneous system was established, what mantle source was involve d (e.g., composition, temperature), what conditions of mantle meltin g (degree and depth of melting) ruled, and, if any, type and amount o f continental crustal contamination of the igneous material derive d from the asthenospheric mantle.  

# Expedition objectives  

The two-expedition drilling transect across the SCS margin se t out to understand the timing and process of rifting, the eventual rupturing of the continental crust, and the onset of breakup-relate d magmatism at the SCS rifted margin (Figure F2). Four primary an d sixteen alternate drill sites across a ${\sim}150~\mathrm{km}$ wide COT zone wer e defined in the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). The four primary sites targeted the four main tectonic features (the OMH an d its small rift basins) and the nature of the three ridges in the distal margin (Ridges A, B, and C). At each of these sites, the nature of th e acoustic basement and the record of synrift and postrift deposit s were key targets.  

Results from the OMH site (U1501) in particular will addres s the rifting history and provide constraints on the degree of crustal exhumation, if any, in the OMH. Located off the distal margin an d in relatively thick crust, the subsidence history at this site can b e compared with that of the more distal margin, which suffered  a much higher degree of crustal thinning. Sampling of prerift throug h synrift to postrift sediments in one of the rotated fault blocks at th e OMH can constrain the timing of rifting and rate of extension in  a location where results can be tied to the much deeper rift basin s further landward through a dense grid of high-quality 2-D seismi c data provided by the Chinese National Offshore Oil and Gas Company (CNOOC). The site has the further advantage of a water dept h shallower than the other three primary sites and, importantly, abov e the present carbonate compensation depth (CCD). It therefore ha s the potential to yield a rich record of carbonate sediments for detailed paleoclimate studies using stable isotope techniques.  

Ridge A in particular will be important for constraining whethe r this ridge is a core complex representing lower plate material (mantle of lower crust), upper plate extensional fault block, or igneou s material related to breakup. Ridge B provides an option to distinguish between possible unroofed, lower plate material, upper plat e extensional fault block, and igneous material related to incipien t seafloor spreading. Ridge C, as described above, targeted sampling  a time series of early ocean floor volcanism to establish a referenc e frame for understanding and modeling the igneous development o f the margin.  

Except for coring at Ridge C, where operations came to a halt fo r technical reasons, Expedition 367/368 completed all the above objectives. Expedition 367 drilled two of the primary sites (U1499 an d U1500) on Ridges A and B (Figures F2, F3, F4, F5). Coring at Sit e U1499 on Ridge A recovered synrift or prerift sediments below th e acoustic basement. Coring at Site U1500 successfully sampled 15 0 m of submarine basaltic lavas, including pillow lavas, below th e acoustic basement at Ridge B. Expedition 368, which originally se t out to drill the remaining two primary sites on Ridge C (U1503) an d the OMH (Site U1501), added a second, alternate site on Ridge  A (Site U1502) to improve the characterization of this ridge and recovered a $180\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of submarine basaltic lavas. A successful  drilling  strategy  (see  Coring  and  logging  strategy), however, allowed us to also pursue Site U1503 on Ridge C, but afte r installation of casing at this site, the hole had to be abandoned fo r technical reasons. This decision left time for inserting alternat e Sites U1504 and U1505, both at shallower water depths on th e OMH. Two of the OMH drill sites penetrated to acoustic basemen t and found Mesozoic prerift? sediments (Site U1501) and metamorphic schist (Site U1504). Site U1505 provided ${\sim}100$ percent recovery of a very complete Oligocene to Plio–Pleistocene sedimen t sequence.  

# Coring and logging strategy  

Drilling operations were designed to core and log through thic k sediment sections and, significantly, into underlying basement using casing in the upper and unstable part of the sedimentary sections. Initially, the operational approach was to drill two holes pe r site (Figures F6, F7).  

The first hole at each site would be cored with the advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel (XCB) systems to refusal (or maximum casing depth) and then logged with the triple combination (triple combo) and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-soni c tool strings. The APC/XCB hole would also document borehole an d formation conditions to help determine the length of casing fo r drilling a second hole (B). All full APC cores were intended to b e oriented, and formation temperature measurements would be mad e using the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3).  

The second hole at each site was designed to begin by drilling i n a seafloor reentry system with casing extending to ${\sim}650\,\mathrm{~m~}$ or a n otherwise defined depth (Figures F8, F9, F10, F11). Casing is drille d down through the reentry cone using an extendable underreame r and mud motor technology (see https://rosetta.iodp.tamu.edu / A/TechDoc/8250). Following the installation of casing to the desired depth, coring using the RCB system could then extend fro m the base of the casing through the sediment and into the underlyin g basement. Multiple pipe trips to replace hard rock RCB bits woul d be made as required by the depth of the target in basement. Upo n completion of the coring objectives, the RCB bit would be droppe d either at the bottom of the hole or on the seafloor before downhol e wireline logging was  conducted. For this deeper logging, w e planned to use the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings alon g with the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) tool string to conduct chec k shots.  

During Expedition 367/368, we had to modify this general operational plan in response to borehole conditions and the need to focus our operations time to achieve our highest priority basement objectives. The implemented operations are shown in Figures F6 and F7.

At Site U1499, the pilot (first) hole (U1499A) consisted of APC/XCB coring until refusal. In the pilot hole (U1500A) at Site U1500, we washed down without coring in the limits of safety approval and the requirements to identify appropriate locations for setting casing in the subsequent hole. We also decided not to collect downhole log data in either of these pilot holes, partly due to poor borehole conditions that we thought would not yield good data and partly to focus more time on the deeper core and log objectives.  

For the primary, deep-penetrating, cased holes at each of the first two sites, we set as much casing as possible $.651\mathrm{~m~}$ in Hole U1499B and $842~\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1500B) to keep the upper part of the hole in stable condition for drilling and to enhance our ability to clean cuttings out of such deep holes. Casing was drilled into the seafloor to total depth as a single step at each location to minimize hole disturbance and save time. We then drilled and cored using the RCB system below the casing until we reached the basement (Hole U1500B) or until hole conditions prevented further coring (Hole U1499B). We collected downhole logging data in the deep penetration hole at each site.  

At Site U1501, the pilot hole (U1501C) consisted of APC/XCB coring until refusal. From the findings, we concluded that in this location the formation might be stable enough to continue with the deeper RCB Hole U1501D to ${\sim}600\mathrm{~m~}$ without casing. Logging was therefore not done in Hole U1501C. Hole U1501D was drilled without coring to a slightly shallower depth than Hole U1501C and then RCB cored to the bottom of the hole. Logging was then executed. This approach saved considerable operational time. We drilled in Hole U1502A to $375\,\mathrm{m}$ without coring and then cored with the RCB system to identify a proper casing point. Casing was then drilled in

Hole U1502B to the desired depth, followed by RCB coring to target. Single-run logging (triple combo) was then executed in the open hole below casing with VSI check shots in both open hole and casing. At Site U1503, we initially drilled in Hole U1503A without coring to a planned casing depth $\left(990\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ estimated on the basis of drilling data from Site U1500 ( ${\sim}20~\mathrm{km}$ away) and seismic correlation between the two sites. A free-fall reentry system was deployed, and casing was subsequently installed in the already established Hole U1503A with the assistance of the underreamer and mud motor (Figure F12). This approach turned out to be very efficient and saved much time. Unfortunately, mechanical problems at the rig floor (lower clutch of the drawworks) prevented us from further pursuing the site.  

With an operational limit of deploying a maximum of $3400\;\mathrm{m}$ of drill string for the remainder of Expedition 368, no deep sites requiring casing could be pursued. Site U1504 had a primary basement target below only ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment cover. Hole U1504A was RCB cored to $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ . Hole U1504B was drilled without coring to ${\sim}90\;\mathrm{m}$ and continued with RCB coring to $200\;\mathrm{m}$ . No logging was pursued.  

Four holes were cored and/or drilled at Site U1505. Hole U1505C was cored with the APC as deep as possible, further cored with the half-length advanced piston corer (HLAPC) system until refusal, extended by XCB coring until the maximum length of the drill string was reached at $480\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , and then logged. Hole U1505D was cored with the APC to $180\;\mathrm{m}$ .

Site U1499 is located on basement Ridge A in the SCS CO T zone ${\sim}60\ \mathrm{km}$ seaward and southeast of the OMH. The goal of drilling here was to core through the sediment to sample the basemen t rocks and thus determine basement age and lithology, which woul d provide a test of different possible models for the processes and rheology controlling the extension and ultimate breakup of the continent. Ridge A was expected to have basement of either uppe r continental crust, lower continental crust, or exhumed mantl e rocks. Coring and drilling also constrain the postrift history by determining the age, water depth, and subsidence rates of the overlying sedimentary packages.  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1499 (propose d Site SCSII-14A; Sun et al., 2016b) (Table T1). Hole U1499A is located at $18^{\circ}24.5698^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $115^{\circ}51.5881^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in a water depth of $3760.2\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1499A, APC/XCB coring penetrated from the seafloor t o $659.2\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $417.05\mathrm{~m~}(63\%)$ . Hole U1499B is located a t $18^{\circ}24.5705^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}51.5990^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in a water depth of $3758.1\mathrm{~m~}$ . We installed casing in Hole U1499B to $651\;\mathrm{m}$ followed by RCB coring tha t penetrated from 655.0 to $1081.8\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $150.64\mathrm{~m~}$ $(35\%)$ . Coring terminated in gravel before deteriorating drilling condition s prevented further penetration; no crystalline basement was encountered. Despite challenging conditions in the lowermost part o f Hole U1499B, two successful wireline logging runs were conducte d from 652 to $1020\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The cored sediment at Site U1499 is divided into nine lithostratigraphic units (Figure F13). Lithostratigraphic Unit I is a 48.8 5 m thick middle−upper Pleistocene sequence of dark greenish gra y bioclast-rich clay with thin clayey silt and sand interbeds. Finingupward silt and fine sand intervals are abundant and interpreted a s turbidite sequences. Four thin $(2{-}7\,\mathrm{cm})$ ash layers were identified i n Unit  I;  none  were  observed  in  the  deeper  units.  Unit  I I $(48.85{-}100.04\ \mathrm{m})$ is a $51.19\mathrm{~m~}$ thick middle–upper Pleistocene sequence of interbedded greenish gray clay-rich calcareous ooze an d dark greenish gray nannofossil-rich clay. Synsedimentary deformational structures such as folds, microfaults, and inclined beds ar e well developed in the sediment of this unit, which is interpreted as  a slump deposit. This unit is underlain by Unit III (Pliocene−middl e Pleistocene), which is divided into Subunits IIIA $(100.04–181.80\;\mathrm{m})$ and IIIB $181.80{-}333.65\ \mathrm{m})$ ). The $233.61\;\mathrm{m}$ of Unit III is dominate d by dark greenish gray clay with thick to very thick clayey silt an d calcareous sand interlaminations. Subunit IIIA contains clayey sil t layers that are thick laminations $\left(<\!1{\mathrm{~cm}}\right)$ , whereas Subunit IIIB ha s abundant thin beds $(2{-}5\,\mathrm{cm})$ of clayey silt and an overall increase i n nannofossil and foraminifer content. Unit IV $333.65{-}404.90\;\mathrm{m})$ is  a $71.25~\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of upper Miocene–Pliocene dark greenis h gray silty sand with clay interbeds. Recovery is very low throughou t this unit, but the recovered intervals and physical property dat a suggest that the sections with no recovery may contain unconsolidated to weakly consolidated sand.  

Unit V $(404.90\substack{-469.45\mathrm{~m}})$ is a $64.55\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of uppe r Miocene dark greenish gray clay with mostly thin $\left(<5\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ clayey sil t and foraminifer sand interbeds. Drilling disturbance in the form o f biscuiting increases significantly in this unit. Similar to Unit IV, recovery in Unit VI $^{\left(469.45-618.30\mathrm{\;m}\right)}$ is very low. The recovered intervals in this unit include upper Miocene dark greenish gray silt y sand with clay interbeds. Unit VII $(618.30\mathrm{-}761.70\,\mathrm{~m})$ is mainl y composed of upper Miocene dark greenish gray to dark gray sandstone and claystone with siltstone interbeds. Lithification increase s sharply downhole from the top of this unit, although sections wit h no  recovery  are  inferred  to  be  nonlithified  sand.  Unit  VII I $?61.70{-}929.02\,\mathrm{~m})$ ) comprises a $167.32\mathrm{~m~}$ thick interval of uppe r Oligocene−Miocene reddish brown to reddish gray claystone an d clay-rich chalk. Based on the abundance of calcareous material, thi s unit is divided into two subunits. Subunit VIIIA $(761.70{-}892.10\;\mathrm{m})$ contains lower–upper Miocene dark reddish brown claystone wit h siltstone and foraminifer sandstone interbeds, whereas Subuni t VIIIB $\langle892.10{-}929.02\ \mathrm{m}\rangle$ is composed of upper Oligocene−lowe r Miocene reddish brown to reddish gray clay-rich nannofossil chal k and clay-rich chalk. In the lowest part of Subunit VIIIB, abundan t brownish black iron-manganese nodules occur in reddish brow n nannofossil-rich claystone.  

Unit IX $929.02{-}1081.80\ \mathrm{m})$ is readily distinguished from th e overlying units by containing Oligocene (and pre-Oligocene?) sandstone, claystone, matrix-supported breccia, and gravel. This unit i s $152.78~\mathrm{~m~}$ thick  and  comprises  three  subunits.  Subunit  IX A $?929.02–933.28\,\mathrm{~m})$ is defined by dark brown and greenish gra y sandstone and breccia. Subunit IXB $(933.28{-}933.35\ \mathrm{m})$ ) is define d by dark gray matrix-supported breccia in Core 367-U1499B-30R. Subunit IXC $933.35{-}1081.80\ \mathrm{m})$ contains gray to dark gray gravel with silty sand intervals. The cores in Subunit IXC are completel y fragmented and were recovered as pebbles and cobbles. In general, the pebbles and cobbles are recycled sedimentary rocks (such a s sandstone) that contain a variety of individual lithic components including igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic clasts. Althoug h the matrix that likely surrounded these cobbles and pebbles was no t recovered, we infer that the matrix is poorly consolidated an d washed away by the drilling process. Based on this description, Subunit IXC may represent synrift or prerift sediments.

# Structural geology  

The tilting of sedimentary beds and deformation structures observed at Site U1499 are limited to lithostratigraphic Units II, VII, VIII, and IX. The folds, faults, and tilted beds observed in Unit II ar e related to two slump events that reworked older sediment betwee n younger Units I and III. Tilted beds and faults with slickensides wer e observed in Units VII and VIII. These faults are linked to compaction processes of the clays, and the tilted beds are associated wit h sandy layers. Unit IX is divided into three subunits. In Subunit IXA, tilted beds and a downhole increase in clast size, angularity, an d proportion of clasts were observed. The matrix-supported brecci a of Subunit IXB exhibits no clear deformation structure or tilted sedimentary bedding. Some of the sandstone and breccia clasts in Subunit IXC exhibit veins and fractures. These clasts were transporte d before sedimentation; therefore, their veins and fractures must hav e originated in a previous tectonic event.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples at Site U1499 were analyzed for calcareous nannofossil and foraminiferal content, and additional sample s were taken from the split-core sections when necessary to refine th e ages. Preservation of microfossils varies from poor to very good, and total abundance varies from barren to abundant. Althoug h samples exhibit some degree of reworking, 28 biostratigraphic datums are recognized, revealing that we recovered an apparentl y continuous succession of the Oligocene to the Pleistocene spannin g nannofossil Zones NP25–NN21 and foraminifer Zones M4/M3 t o Subzone PT1b. The Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary is located between Cores 367-U1499A-20X and 27X, the Pliocene/Miocen e boundary is located between Cores 31X and 43X, and the Miocene/Oligocene boundary is in Section 367-U1499A-30R-2. Sedimentation rates varied from ${\sim}80~\mathrm{mm/ky}$ in the late Miocene–earl y Pliocene and ${\sim}50\mathrm{\mm/ky}$ in the early Pliocene–early Pleistocene t o ${\sim}130\mathrm{\mm/ky}$ in the middle–late Pleistocene. Extremely low sedimentation rates $\langle{\sim}8\;\mathrm{mm/ky}\rangle$ occurred in the early–middle Miocen e during deposition of Unit VIII. Subunit IXA contains early–late Oligocene microfossils (calcareous nannofossils and foraminifers) wit h different preservation and abundance, probably influenced b y transported and reworked materials.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic analysis was conducted on both archive-half sections and discrete samples from the working half. The archive-hal f sections were measured with the pass-through superconductin g rock magnetometer (SRM) with demagnetization steps at 5, 15, an d $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The discrete samples were subjected to alternating field (AF ) and thermal demagnetization, and remanence was measured on th e spinner magnetometer. We adopted a combination of stepwise A F and thermal demagnetization steps to fully demagnetize the discrete samples and obtain the characteristic remanent magnetizatio n (ChRM).  

Variations in natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensit y are well correlated to observable changes in lithology and magneti c susceptibility; for example, the low NRM intensity at ${\sim}60~\mathrm{m}$ (Cor e 367-U1499A-7H) agrees with the carbonate-rich slump in whic h magnetic susceptibility values are also low. Drilling-induced remanence was identified and removed in most core sections at AF treatments of $15\,\mathrm{~mT}$ . In addition, magnetic mineral variations wer e observed from the demagnetization behavior. From Core 367- U1499B-12R downhole, the drilling overprint becomes stronge r and hard to remove with the relatively low AF steps used on the archive-half sections, whereas AF treatments up to $200~\mathrm{mT}$ and temperatures up to $675\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ could not fully demagnetize the discret e samples. These characteristics confirm the presence of higher coercivity magnetic minerals, such as hematite, compared with the predominant magnetite and/or titanomagnetite. But further roc k magnetic property measurements should be conducted in a shorebased laboratory in order to better understand the compositions.  

We constructed the magnetostratigraphy of Holes U1499A an d U1499B based on the interpretation of the raw paleomagnetic dat a that show stable and clear demagnetization behaviors. Declination s from 0 to $162\;\mathrm{m}$ have been corrected by the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool and therefore could help accurately define magneti c reversals. Otherwise, only inclinations are used for polarity interpretations. After correlating the magnetostratigraphy to the standard geomagnetic timescale, we confidently identified the boundar y between the Brunhes and Matuyama Chrons at ${\sim}110\mathrm{~m~}$ . We thu s conclude that the middle/early Pleistocene boundary $(0.78\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is a t  

![](images/27de2bfe8f76ce245260f5bd752d60873eeda6f4d64288119a8e67850d00ef2d.jpg)  
${\sim}110\ \mathrm{m},$ , the early Pleistocene/late Pliocene boundary is at ${\sim}220~\mathrm{m}$ , the late/early Pliocene $\left(3.6\mathrm{~Ma}\right)$ boundary is at ${\sim}260\ \mathrm{m},$ and earl y Pliocene/late Miocene boundary $(5.33\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is at ${\sim}370\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Geochemistry  

Geochemical analyses were conducted for headspace gas safet y monitoring; quantification of sediment $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ organic carbon, an d nitrogen content; and interstitial water characterization. Calciu m carbonate contents vary between 0.4 and $82\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , with higher value s of $>\!20\,\mathrm{\wt\%}$ corresponding to intervals of nannofossil/foraminife r ooze or chalk. Total organic carbon (TOC) contents mostly rang e from ${\sim}0$ to $\sim1.0\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC decreases gradually downhole from 1. 0 to $0.3\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the uppermost $^{110}\,\mathrm{m}$ corresponding to the base of th e sulfate reduction zone, reflecting active degradation of sedimentar y organic matter. The TOC to total nitrogen molar ratio (TOC/TN) i s mostly ${<}8.$ , indicating that TOC is derived dominantly from a marine source.  

Hydrocarbon monitoring shows headspace gas consistently approaching zero throughout the site. Relatively higher methane contents of approximately tens to 6000 ppmv occur across the ${\sim}100-$  

$250\ \mathrm{m}$ interval, just below the sulfate reduction zone. The overal l low methane content indicates limited microbial methanogenesi s likely caused by low TOC contents $(<\!0.3\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ deeper than $^{110}\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

We obtained 58 interstitial water samples from Hole U1499A. The inorganic geochemistry of interstitial water is controlled by th e remineralization of organic matter and carbonate and clay diagenesis. The sediment rapidly becomes suboxic, as indicated by  a Mn peak of ${\sim}120~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{m}$ . Sulfate reduction coupled with sedimentary organic matter degradation occurs to ${\sim}110~\mathrm{m},$ with nearcomplete depletion to $257\,\mathrm{m}$ before increasing slowly to $16.9\,\mathrm{mM}$ a t the bottom of Hole U1499A. The interval of near-complete sulfat e consumption is also marked by pronounced high Ba concentration s $>50~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ suggesting the dissolution of barite $\mathrm{(BaSO_{4})}$ . The peak alkalinity and steady increase in $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ in the upper $110\;\mathrm{m}$ ar e consistent with progressive remineralization of sedimentary organic matter. The gradual decrease in $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ shallower than $80\,\mathrm{m}$ suggests active authigenic carbonate precipitation triggered by sulfat e reduction. A subsequent downhole increase in $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Sr^{2+}}$ is likel y caused by biogenic carbonate dissolution and recrystallization. Nearly parallel downhole decreases in ${\mathrm{M}}\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ are mostl y driven by clay mineral cation exchange and/or clay mineral authigenesis. The lower $C1^{-}$ and $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ concentrations compared to those o f seawater at the bottom of Hole U1499A are mostly driven by th e smectite–illite transformation. Elevated Si concentrations of $700-$ $820\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ from the seafloor to $45\;\mathrm{m}$ suggest active dissolution of biogenic silica.  

# Petrophysics  

At Site U1499, measurements of $P$ -wave velocity, bulk density , magnetic susceptibility, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) wer e made on whole-round cores, and additional measurements wer e made on split cores and discrete samples, including thermal conductivity; caliper $P$ -wave velocity on the $P$ -wave caliper (PWC); porosity; and bulk, dry, and grain density. In general, bulk density, $P_{-}$ - wave  velocity,  and  thermal  conductivity  increase  with  depth, whereas porosity decreases with depth as a result of compactio n and lithification. However, some properties, such as NGR or magnetic susceptibility, show local variations related to the specifi c lithology. The soft sediment in the upper $100~\mathrm{m}$ shows rapid compaction with depth, marked by a decrease in porosity and increas e in bulk density and thermal conductivity. Four thin volcanic ash layers in the uppermost $50\,\mathrm{m}$ are marked by peaks in magnetic susceptibility. The mass transport deposit $(48.85{-}100.04\ \mathrm{m})$ displays lo w magnetic susceptibility and low NGR, reflecting the high carbonat e content of the calcareous ooze. Below these layers downhole t o ${\sim}890~\mathrm{m},$ , physical properties show small variations; bulk density, $P_{-}$ - wave velocity, and thermal conductivity gradually increase, wherea s porosity decreases with depth. The NGR and magnetic susceptibility data in this interval do not show much variation. From 830 t o $930\,\mathrm{\,m,}$ , we observed a general decrease in magnetic susceptibilit y and NGR where density increases slightly and $P$ -wave velocity increases significantly from 2200 to $2900\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . These variations are associated with a significant increase in the carbonate content in th e Subunit VIIIB chalks. The cobbles and pebbles in the deepest par t $(930{-}1080\ \mathrm{m})$ ) show large variations in NGR, bulk density, and $P_{-}$ - wave velocity and very low magnetic susceptibility.  

# Downhole measurements  

Two downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1499B,  a modified triple combo (sonic velocity, NGR, bulk density, resistivity, and caliper) tool string and the FMS-sonic tool string (FMS resistivity images and calipers, as well as NGR). We added the velocity tool to the first tool string because sonic velocities were needed for a n accurate prediction of basement depth for the subsequent Sit e U1500 and to better constrain core-log-seismic correlation. We als o did not know if hole conditions would allow a second logging run. Although stable borehole conditions in Hole U1499B allowed th e second FMS logging run, we did not attempt a check shot due t o time constraints and concerns about hole stability. Borehole conditions from the bottom of the casing at ${\sim}651\,\mathrm{m}$ to the bottom of Hol e U1499B at ${\sim}1020\;\mathrm{m}$ were generally good, with measured diameter s from ${\sim}10$ to 16 inches. Washout zones were observed from 670 t o $710\;\mathrm{m}$ , which corresponds to an interval of very low core recovery, as well as from 830 to $920\,\mathrm{\Omegam},$ , affecting quality of the log data i n these intervals. Log and core data are generally in good agreement. Downhole logging provided information in zones of poor core recovery in Hole U1499B. The log data from 726 to $739\mathrm{~m~}$ exhibit s high NGR and low bulk density and $P.$ -wave velocity, whereas th e data from 820 to $840\;\mathrm{m}$ is characterized by a sharp increase in bul k density, a slight increase in $P_{-}$ -wave velocity, and an abrupt decreas e in NGR compared to average values above and below these depths. The Subunit VIIIB chalks $(\sim\!890\!-\!930\,\mathrm{m})$ display a sharp decrease i n NGR and an increase in bulk density and $P$ -wave velocity wit h depth, as well as only small variations in resistivity. Deeper than 93 0 m, bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and resistivity show large variability, in part because of the presence of cobbles and pebbles. Th e quality of the acquired FMS images is strongly influenced by variations in hole diameter; they generally show alternating smooth an d patchy textures with contrasting resistivity marking horizontal t o slightly tilted bedding downhole to $930\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . The deepest layers o f sandstones, breccias, and gravels show highly variable and obliqu e textures on the FMS images, possibly reflecting the varied orientation of the gravel clasts or the presence of faults and fractures in th e gravel or the matrix. In general, the velocity measured with th e sonic velocity logging tool match the PWC measurements take n with the caliper on the split cores. Six in situ formation temperatur e measurements were made in Hole U1499A and give a geothermal gradient of $93^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ . The estimated heat flow is $110\,\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}}$ ,  a value in agreement with the general heat flow of the area.  

# Correlation to seismic data  

We used downhole log data and physical property measurements on cores and samples as well as other available data to correlate Site U1499 data with the available seismic reflection profiles. We also used the Site U1499 density and sonic velocity data to create synthetic seismograms that provided additional constraints o n the correlation. Log sonic velocities and PWC velocities are in ver y good agreement, except for the deepest breccias and gravels (deepe r than ${\sim}930\;\mathrm{m})$ ) where measurement on individual pebbles leads to a n overestimate of the velocity in the formation. For seismic correlation, we used the PWC and density data from moisture and densit y (MAD) and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density data from Hol e U1499A $(0{-}655\ \mathrm{m})$ , whereas below that depth we used the downhole logging velocity and density data. We used a constant velocit y of $2100\ \mathrm{m/s}$ in the low-recovery zones (333–406 and $531{-}561\ \mathrm{m})$ ), interpreted to be sandy layers, based on the downhole logging velocity values measured at greater depth. The comparison of th e time-depth relationship (TDR) obtained for Site U1499 to those fo r Sites 1148, U1431, and U1433 shows substantial agreement, excep t for the Site 1148 TDR, which shows higher velocities in the deepe r layers. The comparison among the seismic reflectors and the variations in physical properties and lithology characteristics using th e computed Site U1499 TDR shows a good correlation between th e main upper reflectors and the poor-recovery sandy intervals. However, the main physical property changes related to the top of th e deep gravel layer do not correlate to the reflector observed at ${\sim}5.9\;s$ in the seismic profile.  

# Site U1500  

Site U1500 is located on basement Ridge B and is the most seaward site that Expedition 367 drilled in the SCS COT zone. Ridge  B is located ${\sim}80~\mathrm{km}$ seaward of the OMH and ${\sim}20~\mathrm{km}$ seaward o f Ridge A, where Site U1499 was drilled. The goal of drilling here wa s to sample and log the lowermost sediment and underlying basement rocks to determine basement age and lithology of the COT o r embryonic oceanic crust, thus providing a test of different possibl e models for the processes and rheology controlling the breakup o f the continent. Ridge B was expected to have basement of either upper continental crust, lower continental crust, mantle rocks, or oceanic crust. The coring and logging would also constrain the histor y of the region after rifting by determining the age, water depth, an d subsidence rates of the overlying sedimentary packages.  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1500 (propose d Site SCSII-8B; Sun et al., 2016b) (Table T1). Hole U1500A is locate d at $18^{\circ}18.2762^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $116^{\circ}13.1916^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in a water depth of $3801.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . I n Hole U1500A, we drilled without coring from the seafloor to 378. 2 m and then cored with the RCB system from 378.2 to $494.6~\mathrm{m}$ an d recovered $26.5\;\mathrm{m}\;(23\%)$ . Thereafter, we drilled without coring fro m 494.6 to $641.2\,\mathrm{m}$ and cored with the RCB system from 641.2 to 854. 6 m and recovered $67.2\;\mathrm{m}\;(31\%)$ .  

Hole U1500B is located at $18^{\circ}18.2707^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $116^{\circ}13.1951^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in a water depth of $3801.7\:\mathrm{m}$ . After installing casing, we continuously core d the sediment sequence from 846.0 to $1379.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $\mathit{\Delta}^{533.1\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ cored; $164.7\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $31\%$ ) and then continuously cored $149.9\;\mathrm{m}$ int o the underlying basalt from 1379.1 to $1529.0\;\mathrm{m}$ ( $114.92\:\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $77\%$ ). This made Hole U1500B the eighth deepest hole that the $\mathrm{R}/\mathrm{V}$ JOIDES Resolution has drilled in ODP/Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program/IODP history. Three downhole logging strings were run i n Hole U1500B from 842 to $1133\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The cored sediment at Site U1500 is divided into eight lithostratigraphic units (Figure F14). The uppermost $378.2\textrm{m}$ of sediment was drilled without coring. Lithostratigraphic Unit I (378.2– $410.0\:\mathrm{m})$ ) is a $31.8\;\mathrm{m}$ thick upper Miocene sequence of greenish gra y heavily bioturbated clay with silt and sandy silt interbeds. Some o f the clay intervals are nannofossil rich. Structure in the clay is mostl y massive, but parallel laminations occur in the silt and sandy sil t interbeds. Unit II $(410.0–494.6\,\mathrm{m})$ is an upper Miocene sequence o f interbedded dark greenish gray clay and silt. Recovery was very lo w for this unit $(\sim\!8\%)$ , which may indicate a change in lithology (e.g., increased abundance of nonlithified sands). This unit is underlai n by another interval drilled without coring $(494.6{-}641.2\,\mathrm{m})$ .  

Unit III $(641.2–892.4\ \mathrm{m})$ is defined by upper Miocene interbedded claystone, siltstone, and sandstone. Many of the siltston e and sandstone intervals are organized into a variety of massive an d stratified beds that include sedimentary structures such as paralle l laminations, cross-stratification, and contorted strata. There ar e also several massive beds of sandstone that contain pebble-size d mud clasts. The well-organized coarser intervals fine upward int o more massive claystone intervals and are interpreted as turbidite sequences. Several of the stratified beds are composed of foraminife r tests.  

Unit IV (892.4–1233.3 m) also had very low recovery $(15\%)$ . Thi s unit is composed of lower upper Miocene very dark greenish gray t o dark gray sandstone with dark brown to very dark gray clayston e and siltstone intervals. Many of the intervals described in this uni t contain interlaminations of silt or sand in a prevailing clayston e lithology. Similar to Unit III, sedimentary structures in many of th e sandstone and siltstone intervals are interpreted as turbidites. Th e claystone in some of the cores shows a distinctive color banding, which was observed as a pattern of alternating reddish brown, dar k greenish gray, and brownish gray. The color banding appears to b e associated with fining-upward grain sizes and varying levels of bioturbation. Sandstone intervals in this unit contain high percentage s of K-feldspar, quartz, plagioclase, and mica minerals that may hav e been sourced from granitic rocks exposed along the southern margin of China.  

Unit $\mathrm{V}$ (lower middle Miocene) is divided into Subunits V A $1233.30{-}1272.10\,\mathrm{~m})$ and VB $'1272.10{-}1310.98\,\mathrm{~m})$ based on th e abundance of calcareous material. Subunit VA consists of dark reddish brown, dark greenish gray, and dusky red homogeneous massive claystone with few sandstone and siltstone interbeds $3{-}12\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick). Subunit VB consists of dark reddish brown, reddish brown, and greenish gray intervals of claystone, nannofossil-rich claystone, claystone with biogenic carbonate, and clay-rich chalk. The greenish gray color banding in Subunits VA and VB is interpreted as diagenetic alteration.  

Unit VI $(1310.98{-}1370.33\ \mathrm{m})$ is composed of Oligocene dar k greenish gray massive silty claystone with biogenic carbonate an d dark gray sandstone. Unit VII $(1370.33\substack{-1379.10\mathrm{~m}})$ comprises  a thin ( $\leftmoon\rightleftharpoons0~\mathrm{cm}$ thick) Oligocene dusky red claystone. The lowermost  2 cm of this unit has a greenish gray color that marks a shar p horizontal contact with the igneous rocks below in Unit VIII. Th e basalt in Unit VIII $1379.10{-}1529.0\ \mathrm{m})$ , which is Oligocene or preOligocene in age, contains some fractures that are filled with welllithified claystone. The claystone contains authigenic carbonate, siliciclastic components, and rare nannofossils. The basalt interval s are sparsely intercalated with dusky red claystone, with the basalt/sediment contacts often associated with chilled glassy margins. Some claystone intervals in the basalt unit show evidence of dolomitization in thin section.  

# Igneous petrology  

In Hole U1500B, we cored $149.9\mathrm{~m~}$ of igneous rocks below th e sedimentary section and recovered a total of $114.92\,\mathrm{m}$ of basalt. Th e aphanitic to porphyritic basalts are nonvesicular to moderately vesicular and glassy to hypocrystalline, with the latter ranging fro m cryptocrystalline to fine grained, making up an aphyric to highly olivine-plagioclase phyric texture (microstructure). These basalt s contain numerous $2{-}5\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick baked/chilled contacts and chille d margins, many of the latter with preserved fresh glass, as well as occasional hyaloclastites showing brecciated glass fragments mixe d with sediment. The basalts comprise Unit VIII and are divided int o igneous lithologic Subunits 1a and 1b according to flow boundarie s to distinguish an upper massive lava flow sequence $\left.27.28\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ thick ) from a lower, predominantly pillow lava flow succession ( $122.62\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) with subordinate thin $(<\!6\;\mathrm{m})$ interbedded lobate, sheet, an d massive lava flows. The pillow lobes are well preserved and are separated by chilled, glassy margins (identifying upper and lowe r chilled margins of individual pillows where possible) and also claystone. Plagioclase phenocrysts are found throughout these basalts, with olivine being an occasional phenocryst. Modal abundances o f olivine and plagioclase phenocrysts increase downhole, reaching  a peak between 1420 and 1470 mbsf. Veins occur throughout Uni t VIII and are predominantly filled with carbonates and Fe (hydr)oxides, chlorites, zeolites, and silica, as well as sediment. Veins usuall y show a sharp contact with the host basalt and are either polycrystalline or massive. Claystone is a ubiquitous phase in many carbonate-rich veins, especially in pillow lava flows, and is usuall y found as very fine aggregates in carbonate veins or as centimeterthick veins with no preserved textures or structures. Red to greenred halos usually surround the carbonate veins, which are related t o the background alteration of interstitial glass, olivine, and occasionally plagioclase and clinopyroxene. Alteration of these basalts remains slight overall, as evidenced by the minimal alteration o f interstitial glass as well as the good preservation of plagioclase. Alteration intensity, however, does increase downhole.

# Structural geology  

Tilted sedimentary bedding and deformation structures wer e observed in all lithostratigraphic units. Faults, tilted beds, folds, an d mud clasts observed in Units I, II, and III are likely related to gravity-controlled deposition (e.g., debris flows, slumps, slides, etc.).  

Unit IV has low recovery and exhibits only a few tilted beds an d compaction faults. A total of 47 centimeter-scale faults were measured in the claystone of Units V, VI, and VII. Many of these fault s have slickensides and are likely related to clay compaction durin g lithification. Open fractures and veins are identified in the sparsel y to highly plagioclase phyric basalts of Unit VIII. There are no preferred orientations of these structures. Most of the veins are fille d by carbonate minerals, Fe oxides, sediment, and secondary minerals. Veins are often haloed by Fe oxide alteration. Vein connectivit y is variable; single veins, branched veins, and vein networks were observed. There is no mineral-preferred orientation. Although th e seismic profile across Site U1500 shows dipping reflectors in the basalt, we did not observe any clear paleohorizontal or dipping features in these lavas.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples were analyzed for calcareous nannofossil and foraminifer contents. Additional samples were taken fro m the split-core sections when necessary to refine the ages betwee n core catcher samples. Preservation of microfossils varies from poo r to good. Overgrown and abundant broken fragments are commo n in the sediment sequences. The total abundance varies from barre n to abundant, and most samples exhibit some degree of reworking.  

Although recovery is low and ${\sim}50\%$ of the samples are barren, the succession is apparently continuous and is tentatively assigned  a late Oligocene–Miocene age. The late/middle Miocene boundar y $(11.6\ \mathrm{Ma})$ can be placed between Samples 367-U1500B-37R-1, $40-$ $41~\mathrm{{cm}}$ , and 44R-CC. Both calcareous nannofossils and planktoni c foraminifers indicate an early Miocene to late Oligocene successio n in Cores 46R through 56R.  

In the calcareous sandstone (Section 56R-1), just above the basalt, some younger species, such as Praeorbulina circularis (middl e Miocene), Globigerinoides subquadratus, and Orbulina suturalis, are found together with the typical late Oligocene–early Miocen e planktonic foraminiferal species (Catapsydrax dissimilis). In th e same sample, the nannofossil content is represented by long-rang e species and cannot give a precise age. However, two samples fro m the veins and intrapillow fill of the basalts in Unit VIII contai n poorly preserved calcareous nannofossils that indicate an Oligocen e age. The resolution of the age discrepancy in Core 56R requires further postexpedition studies.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site U1500, measurements of organic and inorganic carbo n and nitrogen were conducted on one sample per sedimentary cor e that had relative high recovery, and headspace gas measurement s were taken for all sediment cores. In addition, four basalt sample s were analyzed for concentrations of major elements and severa l trace elements using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emissio n spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Headspace gas values do not exceed 1 5 ppmv and are mostly below the quantification limit. Carbonate contents are dominated by biogenic carbonate and vary between $_{<1}$ an d $40\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ , with higher values corresponding to the calcareous-ric h lithostratigraphic units. TOC and TOC/TN are low, averaging 0.1 4 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ and 4.6, respectively. ICP-AES analyses of basalts from Sit e U1500 indicate subalkaline mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB)-lik e compositions.  

# Paleomagnetism  

We conducted AF demagnetization of archive-half sections an d AF and thermal demagnetization of representative discrete sample s from both sedimentary successions and the igneous rocks. For th e sedimentary samples, AF demagnetization could effectively removed the drilling-induced overprint. The polarity interpretatio n results based on inclination data from the sedimentary long cor e and discrete samples are in agreement, which supports our curren t preliminary polarity patten, but because of discontinuous corin g and poor recovery in many cored intervals, we are not able to correlate these results to the standard geomagnetic polarity timescale. The pass-through measurements of the basalts from the archiv e halves using the SRM effectively removed a low-coercivity component; however, it is not clear if the ChRM or primary magnetizatio n has been reached, partly due to the unavoidable magnetic contamination and partly due to the destructive feature and thus limited A F treatment levels (up to $25~\mathrm{mT}$ ).Within a single igneous subunit, basalts sometimes show both positive and negative inclinations upo n stepwise AF treatments, which makes it hard to assign reliable polarities. The demagnetization behaviors of the discrete basalt samples are of high noise at higher temperatures, which is probably du e to the onset of thermo-viscous remanent magnetization especiall y in a magnetically nonshielded environment. The close associatio n of negative inclinations, changes in magnetic susceptibility, and demagnetization behavior with fractures in the cores points to th e possibility of a secondary chemical remanent magnetization (CRM ) as the source of the reversed intervals in the basalt.  

# Petrophysics  

We conducted measurements of GRA bulk density, magneti c susceptibility, and NGR on whole-round cores and additional measurements on split cores and discrete samples, including thermal conductivity, $P.$ -wave velocity on the PWC, porosity, and bulk, dry, and grain density. In general, bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, an d thermal conductivity increase with depth, whereas porosity decreases with depth as a result of compaction and lithification. However, some properties, such as NGR or magnetic susceptibility, sho w local variations related to the specific lithology. A significant increase in carbonate content in Subunit VB (1272–1311 m) causes  a general decrease in NGR and only a slight decrease in magnetic susceptibility. Physical properties change significantly in the basalts o f Unit VIII $(1379\!-\!1529\mathrm{~m})$ ). Magnetic susceptibility is two orders o f magnitude higher than in the sediment above and varies dependin g on the degree of alteration. $P$ -wave velocity is also much higher, ranging between 4430 and $5710\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s},$ , whereas porosity and NGR ar e very low compared to the sediment above.  

# Correlation to seismic data  

We used physical property data from cores and samples to correlate Site U1500 data with the available seismic reflection profile. We also used the Site U1500 density and PWC velocity data to create synthetic seismograms that provided additional constraints o n the correlation. The TDR obtained for Site U1500 shows substantial agreement with that for Site U1499 and Sites U1431 and U1433; i n contrast, the ODP Site 1148 TDR exhibits higher velocities in th e deeper layers. The comparison between the seismic reflectors an d the variations in physical properties and lithology characteristic s using the computed Site U1500 TDR shows good correlation between the high-amplitude seismic reflector at ${\sim}6.4\,s$ two-way traveltime (TWT) and the top of the basalts of Unit VIII.  

# Downhole measurements  

Three downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1500B:  a modified triple combo (sonic velocity, NGR, bulk density, resistivity, and caliper), the FMS-sonic (FMS resistivity images and calipers, a s well as NGR), and the VSI (check shot and NGR). During the firs t run, the tool string encountered an obstruction at $4946~\mathrm{m}$ wirelin e log depth below rig floor (WRF; ${\sim}1133\;\mathrm{m})$ ), and we were unsuccessful in getting the tool string to pass below this depth. We collecte d FMS data from ${\sim}1044\,\mathrm{m}$ uphole to the bottom of the casing $\left(842\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ . Although the hole had many zones that were significantly enlarged, initial observations of the real-time FMS data indicate that some intervals exhibit relatively good caliper contact and should provid e useful resistivity images. A seismic check shot survey with the VS I successfully collected data at one depth in the open hole and at th e base of the casing. Because this was the last operation conducte d during Expedition 367 and we only had a 1 day transit to Hon g Kong, data processing and full evaluation of the log data will be conducted after Expedition 367.

# Site U1501  

# Background and objectives  

Site  U1501  (proposed  Site  SCSII-41A; $18^{\circ}53.0923^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}45.9455^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ ) (Sun et al., 2016b) in the SCS northern margin (Figure F3) is located on a broad regional basement high (OMH). Th e OMH is the most landward of four distinct highs in the COT and i s followed seaward by Ridges A, B, and C (Figures F4, F5, F15). Sit e U1501 is located at $2845.8\:\mathrm{m}$ below sea level (mbsl). Small rift basin s of presumed Paleogene age are located on top of the OMH (Figur e F5). These basins can be traced landward into much deeper halfgraben basins that formed during the main phase of crustal extension. The rift basins located on the OMH, therefore, offer options t o recover the stratigraphy of these basins by drilling to moderat e depths, testing existing stratigraphic interpretations, and extrapolating the findings margin wide. Recovering and characterizin g these sequences were key objectives at Site U1501, and the specifi c goal was to constrain the timing and duration of crustal extension, the tectonic vertical movements during rifting, and the subsequen t postrift thermal subsidence. The crystalline basement at Site U150 1 is most likely located far below the acoustic basement at ${\approx}600\;\mathrm{m}$ an d was not an objective for this site.  

At 2846 mbsl, Site U1501 is one of the few ODP and Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program sites in the SCS above the modern CCD o f the SCS. Sites U1504 and U1505, also at the OMH, are situated a t $<\!3000\;\mathrm{mbsl}.$ . The younger stratigraphy is therefore also the focus o f some secondary scientific objectives related to Neogene environmental development of the SCS and adjacent landmasses of Southeast Asia. Among these secondary objectives are to (1) reconstruc t the history of the east Asian monsoon evolution and of deep-water exchanges between the SCS and Pacific Ocean and (2) explore th e sedimentary responses to the Cenozoic regional tectonic and environmental development of the Southeast Asia margin.  

# Operations  

We conducted operations in four holes at Site U1501 (Table T2) . In Holes U1501A and U1501B, Core 1H missed the sediment–wate r interface and retrieved full core barrels, indicating that the core wa s shot  from  below  the  seafloor.  Hole  U1501C $\langle18^{\circ}53.0919^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ $115^{\circ}45.9485^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $2846\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was cored with the APC system from th e seafloor to $461.8~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $447.8\mathrm{~m~}$ $(96.3\%)$ . Hole U1501 D $\mathrm{[18^{\circ}53.0929^{\prime}N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}45.9370^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $2846~\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was drilled without coring from the seafloor to $433.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and then cored with the RCB system to $644.3\mathrm{~m~}$ . A total of $78.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered $(37.4\%)$ . Hole U1501D was logged with the triple combo tool string from 11 3 to $299.3\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1501 is composed of clay-rich nannofossil ooze, silty clay, clayey silt, sand, siltstone, sandstone with minor conglomerate, and rare volcanic ash. The succession is divided into three major lithostratigraphic unit s (I, II, and III) distinguished on the basis of sediment composition, particularly the relative abundance of the calcareous and siliciclasti c fractions (Figure F16).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I is a $303~\mathrm{m}$ thick, Holocene–upper Oligocene succession dominated by clay-rich nannofossil ooze an d nannofossil ooze with clay, with minor amounts of nannofossil-ric h foraminifer sand or silty sand. A felsic volcanic ash layer occurs i n Section 368-U1501A-1H-7, and an ash pod was observed in Sectio n 368-U1501C-3H-1. Unit I is divided into the following subunits:  

• Subunit IA $\left(0{-}25.47\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , • Subunit IB $(25.47{-}66.17\;\mathrm{m})$ ), • Subunit IC $(66.30{-}156.70\;\mathrm{m})$ , • Subunit ID (156.80–191.99 m), • Subunit IE (191.99–293.09 m), and • Subunit IF (293.90–303.01 m).  

These divisions are based on changes in lithology, particularly th e clay to nannofossil ratio, the presence and abundance of foraminifers, and/or physical properties. The lower contact of Unit I is erosional and marked by the emplacement of a poorly sorted sand y layer. At the boundary, marked changes in $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, NGR, magnetic susceptibility, porosity, MAD, color, carbonate content, and biostratigraphy indicate a small hiatus (Figure F16). Unit I wa s deposited in a deep-marine environment, and lithologic change s between subunits likely reflect the amount of terrigenous input int o a relatively open ocean setting. This input may be delivered as buoyant sediment plumes from shallower shelf environments and rarel y by weak (distal) turbidity currents. Soft-sediment deformation i n Subunit IB indicates slumping downslope of parts of the sequence.

Lithostratigraphic Unit II is $296~\mathrm{m}$ thick and late Oligocene t o late Eocene in age. The unit consists of variable amounts of clay, silt, and sand with minor nannofossil-rich clay, nannofossil ooze, an d silt with organic matter. Gravel-sized grains occur, including shel l fragments and glauconite, as well as carbonate and pyrite concretions. Unit II is divided into six subunits:  

• Subunit IIA $(303.01{-}385.26\;\mathrm{m})$ ), • Subunit IIB $\left(388.80{-}452.69\:\mathrm{m}\right)$ , • Subunit IIC (452.60–482.33 m), • Subunit IID (491.00–519.80 m), • Subunit IIE (529.30–548.64 m), and • Subunit IIF (548.64–598.91 m).  

The uppermost two subunits define a fining-upward succession o f glauconite-sand dominated to siltstone and clay overlain by cla y with nannofossils. Subunits IIC and IE are dominated by sandston e with calcite; Subunit IID has more fine-grained, organic-rich lithologies; and Subunit IIF is similar to Subunit IIB but has mor e coarse-grained sediment and distinctive weak red and reddish gra y intervals in the green glauconite-bearing sands. Coarse sand– t o pebble-sized shell fragments are common in Unit II, and coral fragments were occasionally observed in the upper part of the unit. Glauconite and quartz minerals dominate the siliciclastic grai n component. Diagenetic pyrite is common. Unit II most likely represents a gradual change upward from shallow-water (outer shelf o r upper continental slope) to deep-water (lower slope) depositiona l environments. The Unit II/III boundary was not recovered but i s marked by an abrupt change in magnetic susceptibility, NGR, an d $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity. A change in the apparent dip of strata from nea r horizontal in Unit II to ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ in Unit III suggests that the contact i s unconformable.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit III $\mathrm{^{598.91\m}}$ to the bottom of the hole ) is well lithified and composed of poorly sorted, feldspar-rich sandstone interbedded with moderately to well-sorted, medium- to finegrained sandstone and, rarely, siltstone and poorly sorted conglomerate. The age is unknown because no fossils were recognized. Uni t III is divided into two subunits: IIIA $(598.91\substack{-629.79}\mathrm{~m})$ and III B $629.79{-}643.56\,\mathrm{~m}$ ). Subunit IIIA is composed of coarse-graine d heterolithic sandstone, sandstone with calcite clasts, and mino r conglomerate and siltstone. Pebble- to cobble-sized clasts includ e felsic intrusive and volcanic rocks, sedimentary rocks, metamorphic rocks, and rare gabbro. Subunit IIIB consists of sandstone an d minor sandstone with organic matter. Subunit IIIB is finer graine d than Subunit IIIA and has finely laminated intervals. We speculat e that Unit III was formed in continental to littoral environments wit h a provenance not far from the site.  

# Structural geology  

Unit I shows predominantly horizontal to subhorizontal bedding with local soft-sediment deformation structures such as slum p folds. Unit I is devoid of any structures related to tectonic deformation, apart from some rare normal faults with minor offsets.  

Unit II is characterized by subhorizontal to gently dipping bedding. Steep dips up to $40^{\circ}$ are locally observed in close relation t o tially characterized by randomly distributed occurrence of single t o branched uniform calcite and quartz veins. Recognition of deformational structures was difficult due to drilling disturbance throughout this unit.

parallel lamination and are therefore interpreted as cross-laminae. In contrast to Unit I, deformation structures were observed in Uni t II, although their occurrence is rather heterogeneously distributed. Planar to irregular millimeter-scale normal faults and joints wer e observed in Subunit IIA, typically with offsets ranging from 0.1 t o $0.5\ \mathrm{cm}$ and apparent dips of $10^{\circ}{-}40^{\circ}$ . Striations and slickenside s were documented locally where the surfaces of such structures ar e exposed. Deformation in the underlying Subunits IIC–IIF is essen  

The acoustic basement marks the top of Unit III. This uni t shows a weak tilting of stratified beds expressed in apparent dips o n split core surfaces up to ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ . Again, deformation structures remai n scarce and heterogeneously distributed in Unit III. The recognize d structures consist of veins, fractures, and local microfaults associated with cataclastic fault gouge.  

In conclusion, despite the various tilting of reflectors $(\sim\!5^{\circ})$ an d the vicinity of extensional structures observed on seismic profiles, only weak evidence of bedding tilting and/or deformation structures were observed at this site, possibly due to the nature of th e sediments.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples at Site U1501 were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, diatoms, and foraminifers, with select cor e catchers examined for ostracods. Additional samples were take n from the split working-half sections when necessary to refine th e ages between core catcher samples. Preservation of calcareou s microfossils varies from good in Unit I (Cores 368-U1501A-1H, 368-U1501B-1H, and 368-U1501C-1H through 44X) to poor i n Units II and III (Cores 368-U1501C-45X through 62X and 368- U1501D-2R through 5R). Planktonic foraminifers and calcareou s nannofossils are abundant in Unit I, common to rare in Unit II an d upper Unit III, and barren in the rest of Unit III (Cores 368- U1501D-6R though 27R). Diatoms are few with moderate preservation in Samples 368-U1501A-1H-CC, 368-U1501B-1H-CC, an d 368-U1501C-1H-CC and 2H-CC. The rest of the core catcher samples are barren of diatoms with the exception of Samples 368- U1501C-3H-CC, 4H-CC, 33F-CC through 35F-CC, and 46X-CC, i n which diatoms are rare with poor preservation. Diatoms are common in burrows found in interval 368-U1501C-35F-1, 118–119 cm, with poor preservation.  

Forty biostratigraphic datums were identified in a mostly continuous succession from the Eocene to Holocene, which indicate s that Holes U1501C and U1501D penetrated late Eocene or olde r strata (Figure F16). The Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary $(\sim\!2.6\ \mathrm{Ma})$ was placed in Core 368-U1501C-7H, the Pliocene/Miocene boundary $({\sim}5.3\,\mathrm{Ma})$ in Core 9H, the Miocene/Oligocene boundary $(\sim\!23.0$ Ma) between Cores 41X and 42X, and the Oligocene/Eocen e boundary $({\sim}33.9\ \mathrm{Ma})$ between Cores 53X and 54X. Sedimentatio n rates vary from ${\sim}13\mathrm{~mm/ky}$ in the early Oligocene, ${\sim}11\ \mathrm{mm/ky}$ i n the Miocene, and ${\sim}14~\mathrm{mm/ky}$ in the Pliocene to $24~\mathrm{mm/ky}$ in th e Pleistocene. Low sediment accumulation rates $(\sim\!3.6\,\mathrm{mm/ky})$ durin g the late Eocene through the early Oligocene and in the late Miocen e suggest the presence of hiatuses in the sedimentary record durin g these periods. In contrast, higher sediment accumulation rates (3 5 $\mathrm{mm/ky},$ ) exist during the late Oligocene and the early Miocene.  

Predominance of shallow-water benthic foraminifer and ostracod assemblages in Cores 368-U1501C-45X through 62X an d 368-U1501D-2R through 6R indicate an upper bathyal to continental shelf paleoenvironment during the Eocene to the early Oligocene. Predominantly abyssal benthic foraminifers and ostracod s above Core 368-U1501C-44X indicate that deep-water condition s existed in this part of the SCS since the early Oligocene.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations combined measurement and inline AF demagnetization of archive-half sections on the 2G Enterprises SRM with the measurement of discrete samples either AF o r thermally demagnetized.  

The rock magnetic experiments on six representative sample s from  Hole  U1501C  show  saturation  remanent  magnetizatio n $({\mathrm{SIRM}})/{\upchi}$ ratios between 12.8 and $14.6\ \mathrm{kA/m}$ , indicating the predominance of greigite in Unit I of Hole U1501C, also documente d by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in $2{-}10~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grains. Thermal demagnetization behaviors show that greigite dominates th e  

NRM, at least downhole to $83\,\mathrm{m}$ . However, the magnetic remanenc e left above $575\mathrm{^\circC}$ suggests contributions from additional phases suc h as maghemite (Curie temperature $[T_{\mathrm{C}}]=\sim590^{\circ}–675^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ or hematit e $(T_{\mathrm{C}}=\sim\!675^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ .  

Both AF and thermal treatments on discrete samples successfully removed the steep low-temperature/coercivity componen t that represents the drilling overprint. The mean inclination gathered from the high-temperature component is $37.3^{\circ}\,\pm\,6.6^{\circ}$ , corresponding  to  a  paleolatitude  of $20.8^{\circ}~\pm~3.3^{\circ}$ for  Unit  I  (se e Lithostratigraphy). Many of the AF-demagnetized discrete samples reveal trends of reversed or normal polarity in the last step o f demagnetization $(50\;\mathrm{mT})$ and are more difficult to interpret.  

The magnetostratigraphy in Holes U1501C and U1501D i s based on directions derived from the raw moments measured by th e SRM after $25~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step and from the corroborativ e evidence from discrete samples. Magnetostratigraphy was correlated to the standard timescale and plotted along with the ti e points from the microfossil ages from shipboard paleontologists. The paleomagnetic and paleontological age constraints match well over most of the section (Figure F16). A succession of eight normal and five reversed events was recognized in Hole U1501D. However, the lack of biostratigraphic constraints throughout Hole U1501 D prevented even a tentative correlation of these events with the standard timescale.  

# Geochemistry  

Interstitial water samples were obtained downcore to $450\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Subunit IIB). In Unit I, variations are mainly the result of diageneti c and microbial processes, and measurements of alkalinity, phosphate, ammonia, and sulfate are in the typical ranges for the regio n $3.5{-}5\ \mathrm{mM}$ alkalinity, $250{-}510~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ phosphate, ${<}30~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ ammonia, and ${<}26~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ sulfate). However, more atypically (particularly whe n compared to Expedition 367 Site U1499), the main changes associated with microbial processes are notable only in the uppermost 2 5 m in Subunit IA and are typical of organic matter degradation. Deeper than $25~\mathrm{m}$ in Unit I, changes in interstitial water chemistr y appear inhibited until $300\;\mathrm{m}$ . These changes may be a consequenc e of the low organic carbon concentration and high carbonate conten t $(\sim\!50\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ of Unit I. Decreases in sulfate concentrations with dept h are more pronounced in Unit II $\left(>\!300\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , and in this zone there i s heavy pyritization and total sulfur (TS) contents are high, suggesting sulfate reduction has taken place. In the uppermost part of Uni t II $(300{-}370\ \mathrm{m})$ , chloride, bromide, and sodium are notably lowe r (chloride $=500~\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}$ , cf. $565~\mathrm{mM};$ ; bromide $=0.75~\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , cf. $0.9\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}$ and sodium $=410~\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}$ , cf. $480~\mathrm{mM}$ ). This difference in interstitial water chemical composition is sharp and could result from pressure-isolated units retaining a distinct formation water chemistry o r from the migration of chloride-poor formation water.  

Headspace gas concentrations are below background laborator y levels in all samples collected from Site U1501 ${<}1\%$ ppmv). TO C content is typically ${<}0.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in Unit I, except from 0 to $50\;\mathrm{m}$ (Subunit IA). In this interval, a typical black marine mud has a TOC o f ${\sim}1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC was also typically ${<}0.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in Units II and III, excep t for a few carbonaceous lithologies: sandstones with plant phytoclasts associated with an ash-rich boghead coal in Unit II (interval 368-U1501D-9R-1, $10{-}15\ \mathrm{cm})$ and a bitumen-impregnated sandstone in Unit III (interval 27R-1, $12{-}16~\mathrm{cm}$ ). TS content is low i n Unit I: ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ in Subunit IA and below effective shipboard detection limits of $0.01\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ for the rest of Unit I. TS content is higher i n Unit II $;>\!1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in the muddier uppermost part of Unit II and a n average of $0.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the sandier, deeper part.  

Elemental compositions primarily reflect geological units an d changes in lithology. In Unit I, carbonate contents are high and exceed $50~\mathrm{wt\%}$ in foraminifer-rich intervals (compositionally a limestone). In Units II and III, carbonate is less common, and the unit s are predominantly siliciclastic with a distinction between units tha t are mud rich and feldspathic and sandier units toward the base o f the hole. Calcium and strontium are associated with biogenic sediments in Unit I, but in deeper units they covary with aluminum. In the base of Units II and III, sodium and potassium are both high, which is consistent with the dominant presence of feldspathic sediments. The higher aluminum proportion in the uppermost part o f Unit II is consistent with the muddier, clay-rich lithologies presen t here.  

# Physical properties  

Hole U150A is divided into four units based on the sedimen t and rock physical properties. Physical properties (PP) Unit 1 (0–30 0 m) experienced the most evident changes in sediment compaction, which is expressed by increasing bulk density (from 1.4 to 2. 0 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ and $P$ -wave velocity (from 1450 to $1930\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ) and decreasin g porosity (from $85\%$ to $45\%$ ) with depth. Because PP Unit 1 consist s mostly of calcareous ooze, it has relatively low NGR (between 2 0 and 40 counts/s) and magnetic susceptibility (between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$ SI). The onset of PP Unit 2 $(300{-}450~\mathrm{m})$ is marked by a rapid increase in NGR and porosity and a rapid decrease in bulk density an d $P$ -wave velocity, corresponding to a shift to a different lithologi c unit with sand, silt, and clay-enriched sediments. In the entire unit, NGR is persistently high (60–80 counts/s), whereas magnetic susceptibility remains as low as $10\times10^{-5}$ SI. $P$ -wave velocity and bul k density continue to increase with core depth. Most physical properties of PP Unit 3 $(450{-}600\;\mathrm{m})$ ) have similar values to those of Unit 2, except that $P_{-}$ -wave velocity is extremely high, up to $4000{-}6000\ \mathrm{m/s}$ at some interbeds, and bulk density and porosity increase and decrease to $2.6~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and $2\%{-3\%}$ , respectively, at parallel depths. P P Unit 4 $(600{-}657\;\mathrm{m})$ is distinct from other units due to higher mea n NGR (80 counts/s), bulk density $(2.6\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , magnetic susceptibilit y $(500\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\,\mathrm{SI})$ ), and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity $(4500~\mathrm{m/s})$ . Throughout th e hole $\left(0{-}657\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , thermal conductivity values increase from 0.7 to 3. 4 $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ , most likely as a result of increasing sediment compactio n and changes in sediment compositions. $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ reflectance values ar e highly relevant to weight percent carbonate in sediments, which exhibit relatively high $L^{\ast}$ values between 100 and 160 in the upper 30 0 m and thereafter remain as low as 90.  

# Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging was conducted in Hole U1501D using a modified triple combo tool string that included the Hostile Environmen t Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS), Hostile Environment LithoDensity Sonde (HLDS), High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA), and magnetic susceptibility sonde (MSS). The triple combo run collected good data between $115.1\;\mathrm{m}$ (base of the drill pipe) and $300\,\mathrm{m}$ , where it encountered an impenetrable obstruction. Four loggin g units are defined:  

• Logging Unit 1 (base of the drill pipe to $190\;\mathrm{m}$ wireline depth below seafloor [WSF]) is characterized by intervals of large hole diameter and relatively high variability in NGR and magnetic susceptibility.   
• Logging Unit 2 (190–260 m WSF) is characterized by a relatively constant hole diameter, relatively homogeneous logs, and submeter-scale layering.  

• Logging Unit 3 (260–275 m WSF) again shows a relatively large hole diameter, as well high variability in NGR, density, and resistivity logs. • Logging Unit 4 (275–300 m WSF) exhibits relatively large values of resistivity and magnetic susceptibility.  

The upward log pass indicated a collapsed hole at ${\sim}156.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) on the caliper curve, and fo r safety reasons no further attempts to descend deeper than that undergauge spot were made. Because the interval of the collapsed hol e was located only ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ below the base of the pipe, the originall y planned FMS-sonic tool string was not run. Four in situ formatio n temperature measurements were made in Hole U1501C, yielding  a geothermal gradient of $81.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ and a calculated heat flow o f $100.1\ \mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . These values are comparable to the relatively hig h values observed at some ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program sites in this part of the SCS.  

# Site U1502  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1502 (proposed Site SCSII-17A; Sun et al., 2016b) in th e SCS northern margin (Figures F3, F17) is located at 3764 mbsl on  a prominent basement ridge (A) in the COT (Figure F5). Ridge A i s one of four distinct basement highs found across the COT. Th e OMH is the most landward of these highs and is followed seawar d by the nearly parallel Ridges A, B, and C. A key objective of Expeditions 367 and 368 was to examine the nature of the crust in Ridge A. This ridge is considered to be a pivotal element in the transitio n from continental to oceanic crust. Hence, the main objective of Sit e U1502 was to drill through synrift deposits overlying an interprete d shallow-dipping $({\sim}20^{\circ})$ fault zone and into the crystalline basemen t below the fault. Information on the nature and age of the synrift deposits overlying the fault, as well as the nature and age of the overlying sediments and associated seismic unconformities, forme d another target with the objective of constraining basin subsidence.

# Operations  

We conducted operations in two holes at Site U1502 (Table T2). Hole U1502A is located at $18^{\circ}27.8720^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $116^{\circ}13.8381^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , at 376 3 mbsl. Our operations in Hole U1502A were designed to provide information on formation characteristics and drilling conditions s o that we could decide the length of casing to drill into the seafloor i n deep-penetration Hole U1502B. Given this purpose and the amoun t of time to drill the second, deep hole, we did not core continuousl y in Hole U1502A. Instead, we drilled without coring from the seafloor to $375.0\;\mathrm{m}$ and cored with the RCB system from 375.0 to 758. 2 m,  recovering $176.81~\mathrm{~m~}$ $(46\%)$ .  Hole  U1502B  is  located  a t $18^{\circ}27.8798^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , $116^{\circ}13.8409^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , at 3763.6 mbsl. In Hole U1502B, w e drilled a reentry funnel and $727.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing into the seafloor; cored with the RCB system through the sediment–basal t transition $(727.7\mathrm{-}739.16\mathrm{~m})$ and $180\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into the underlying basal t $(739.16{-}920.95\ \mathrm{m})$ , recovering $128\mathrm{~m~}(70\%)$ ; and collected downhole log data with the triple combo tool string and a check shot wit h the VSI tool string.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1502 extend s from the early Oligocene (possibly late Eocene) to the late Miocene. The succession includes four sedimentary units (I and III–V) tha t are composed of mainly clay, nannofossil-rich clay, biosiliceous-ric h clay, limestone, and clast-rich clay and two igneous units (II and VI ) that are mainly composed of basalt. The base of the sedimentar y succession is a sequence of clay and metasediments (dolomite marble and dolomitic limestone) that possibly forms the contact with  a unit of altered basalt (Unit VI) (Figure F18).  

Late Miocene to late Oligocene lithostratigraphic Unit I is divided into five subunits. Subunit IA (Hole $\mathrm{U1502A}=375.00{-}486.82$ m) is composed of dark gray, gray, dark greenish gray, and greenis h gray silty clay, clay with nannofossils, and nannofossil-rich clay intercalated with dark grayish brown, grayish brown, and brown cla y with nannofossils, with minor dark greenish gray sandy clay wit h calcite. Subunit IB (Hole $\mathrm{U1502A}=490.20{-}599.57\ \mathrm{m})$ is compose d of alternating intervals of brown and greenish gray clay, silty clay, and clayey silt. Sandy intervals are rare. Recovery in Subunits I A and IB was very poor, which might be due to the occurrence of thic k sand beds that were washed out. Subunit IC (Hole $\mathrm{U}1502\mathrm{A}\ =$ $599.57{-}602.39\ \mathrm{m})$ is composed of greenish gray and reddish gra y foraminifer-rich clayey siltstone to sandstone with parallel laminations and convolute bedding, with thin layers of pinkish gray foraminiferal chalk. Subunit ID (Hole $\mathrm{U1502A}\,=\,602.39\mathrm{-724.03~m})$ i s mainly composed of alternating greenish and brownish gray an d grayish brown clay, silty clay, clayey silt, and clay with silt (Core s 368-U1502A-25R through 32R), but brown colors dominate Core s 33R through 38R. Nannofossils are abundant in the lowermost ${\sim}4$ m of this subunit. Subunit IE (Hole $\mathrm{U1502A\,=\,724.03{-}734.87\ m;}$ Hole U1502B; 727.79–727.96 m) is composed of brown nannofossil-rich clay with foraminifers and nannofossil-rich clay with pal e green colored halos around fractures. The sediments of Unit I ar e interpreted as having been deposited in a deep-marine environment. Fining-upward intervals in Subunits IA–IC are interpreted a s turbidites.  

Unit II is a highly altered greenish gray basalt clast recovere d from Hole U1502B at $727.96{-}728.04\;\mathrm{~m~}$ . The primary minera l phases are replaced by an alteration-mineral assemblage.  

Unit III (Hole $\mathrm{U1502A~=~739.10{-}739.16~m;}$ ; Hole $\mathrm{U}1502\mathrm{B}\ =$ $728.04{-}733.82\;\;\mathrm{m})$ is composed of brownish yellow, very hard, poorly sorted breccia. The granule- to pebble-size siliceous clast s consist of alteration minerals (Fe hydroxides) cemented by a matri x of annealed quartz in various grain sizes.  

Unit IV (Hole $\mathrm{U1502A}\,=\,739.16{-}747.20~\mathrm{m})$ consists of biosiliceous-rich silty clay. Diatoms, sponge spicules, and radiolarians ar e abundant in the upper part, but the abundance of both nannofossil s and  diatoms  decreases  rapidly  downhole  from  Section  368- U1502A-40R-1 to Section 40R-3. Pyrite occurs as centimeter-size d patches and along cracks. The layering in Unit IV is inclined an d may be slightly deformed.  

Unit $\mathrm{V}$ (Hole $\mathrm{U1502A~=~747.20{-}749.01~m;}$ Hole $\mathrm{U}1502\mathrm{B}\ =$ $733.82{-}739.16\;\mathrm{m})$ is an interval of alternating metasediments (dolomite marble, dolomitic limestone, and clast-rich clay). The dolomit e marble is dominated by very fine grained dolomite $(\sim\!95\%)$ with minor amounts of magnetite $(\sim\!3\%)$ and calcite $(\sim\!2\%)$ . The annealin g texture is equigranular and crossed by fine-grained dark gray bands. The presence of magnetite explains the extraordinarily high magnetic susceptibility of this unit. The gray, fine-grained dolomiti c limestone in Hole U1502B is intercalated with well-consolidated, very dark greenish gray clay with $10\%{-15\%}$ igneous clasts. The sediment is partially overprinted with alteration caused by secondar y high-temperature processes (e.g., hydrothermal fluid sediment interaction or contact metamorphism).  

Unit VI (Hole $\mathrm{U1502A\=\749.01{-}750.67\ m;}$ ; Hole $\mathrm{U}1502\mathrm{B}\ =$ $739.16{-}920.95\ \mathrm{m})$ ) consists of highly altered basaltic breccia, brecciated basalt, pillow basalt, and sheet basalt. The unit is divided int o two subunits. Subunit VIA is composed of highly altered basalti c breccia and brecciated basalt with minor sheet basalt, chert, an d claystone and very minor pillow basalt. Subunit VIB is dominate d by altered pillow basalt and sheet flows and is less brecciated tha n Subunit VIA.  

# Igneous petrology  

At Site U1502, we recovered two igneous lithologic units. Unit  1 (lithostratigraphic Unit II) is represented by just three small, aphanitic, fine-grained basalt fragments that contain rare plagioclas e phenocrysts (Figure F19). Alteration of Unit 1 is intense, with mos t of the groundmass replaced by green clay minerals, clinozoisite, zeolites, and Fe (hydr)oxides.  

Unit 2 (lithostratigraphic Unit VI) comprises a $182~\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of highly altered aphyric to highly plagioclase porphyriti c basalts with minor chert (Figure F19). These basalts are divided int o two igneous subunits (2a and 2b) based on flow morphology an d alteration style: an upper brecciated and fractured massive lava flo w sequence (Subunit 2a) and a lower sequence of interbedded pillo w flows with lobate and sheet lava flows in which the alteration style i s characterized by intense veining (Subunit 2b). Subunit 2a is characterized by highly altered breccia clasts of sparsely to moderatel y phyric basalt in a matrix of carbonates, epidote, chlorite, F e (hydr)oxides, quartz, zeolite minerals, and clay minerals. The clast s show an alteration assemblage similar to the matrix, with remnan t plagioclase and secondary pyrite. Subunit 2b consists of aphyric t o highly plagioclase phyric $(>\!30\%)$ basalts with abundant chlorite an d sulfides, as well as epidote, clay minerals, carbonates, zeolites, an d opaque minerals.  

All of Unit 2 has undergone some degree of hydrothermal alteration. This alteration varies from complete replacement of the rock, where the original composition and texture are difficult to determine, to replacement of mineral phases with little change to the texture. Glassy pillow rinds are completely replaced, and multipl e phases of veining and halos are ubiquitous throughout the rocks. Three vein types were observed: (1) white to green to black silicaepidote veins, (2) apple green pyrite-epidote veins, and (3) white silica and/or calcite veins. Sulfide mineralization (disseminated an d veined) is widespread throughout Unit 2 and is dominated by pyrite, with minor sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and covellite.

Figure F18. Lithostratigraphic summary with simplified lithology and unit descriptions, Holes U1502A and U1502B.  

Handheld portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyses show n o significant differences in contents of alteration-resistant element s such as Ti and $Z\mathbf{r}$ in Unit 2, but Subunit 2a has lower $\mathrm{MgO}_{:}$ FeO, an d $\mathtt{M n O}$ than Subunit 2b, which is consistent with the higher degree o f alteration. Subunit 2b is also strongly affected by secondary alteration, but areas of less intense alteration are indicated by highe r magnetic susceptibility and high CaO and $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ contents. Unit  1

# Structural geology

Core 25R. Downhole from Core 37R at ${\sim}700\ \mathrm{m},$ , a gradual increas e in deformation structures was observed (Figure F19). Cores 37 R through 39R are characterized by microfaults, as evidenced b y downward-dip plunging striations and slickensides on expose d fracture surfaces, systematically associated with greenish halos. N o deformation structures were encountered in Unit II. Unit III con  

Deformation structures are scarce in Unit I above Core 368- U1502A-37R, with only a local, convolutely bedded sequence i n sists of extremely silicified breccia that was poorly recovered. Th e nature of this breccia, however, as sedimentary, tectonic, or hydrothermal remains unconstrained at the moment. In Unit IV, a smallscale transition from distributed to localized shear in unlithifie d sediments was documented. No deformation structures were encountered in Unit V.  

Unit VI is essentially composed of basalts that were heterogeneously affected by brecciation and veining associated with the circulation of hydrothermal fluids. Subunit VIA is dominated b y brecciated basalt/basaltic breccia, whereas Subunit VIB comprises  a rather coherent series of lava flows crosscut by a multistage networ k of polymineralic veins. The uppermost part of Unit VI contains severely fractured and fragmented basalt locally filled by fine-graine d unconsolidated greenish rock. Subunit VIA is characterized by diverse brecciation horizons associated with veins and microcracks. Depending on the intensity of fragmentation and the clast/matri x ratio, the rocks are referred to as brecciated basalt or basaltic breccia. A typically observed feature is the jigsaw-puzzle structure, suggesting possible in situ fragmentation. Macro- and microscopi c observations show that the breccia-clasts consist mainly of sparsel y to moderately plagioclase phyric basalts that were hydrothermall y altered to variable degrees. Thus, formation of such breccias likel y involved fluid-assisted fracturing of basalt. In contrast, Subunit VI B is characterized by a progressive decrease of breccia horizons an d the development of different vein types, almost always polymineralic. Notably, vein composition and their orientation change s through Subunit VIB. Although numerous small-scale veins ofte n related with major veins were observed, three first-order vein type s were categorized: (1) composite silica-rich veins, (2) composite epidote-rich veins, and (3) composite carbonate- and/or silica-ric h veins.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples from Hole U1502A and selected samples from Hole U1502B were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, diatoms, and ostracods. Additional samples wer e taken from the working-half core intervals when necessary to refin e the ages. The preservation of calcareous microfossils is mostly goo d to moderate in the upper sections (Cores 368-U1502A-2R throug h 13R) and moderate to poor in the lower sections (Cores 14 R through 41R). Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossil s are abundant to common in Cores 2R through 10R, 25R, and 37 R through 39R and rare to barren in all other sections. Diatoms wer e only observed in Sections 40R-1 through 40R-3. In Hole U1502B, foraminifers were observed only in Section 3R-1 and are represented by well-preserved agglutinated deep-water taxa. Ostracod s are extremely rare; single occurrences were observed only in thre e samples in Hole U1502A (Samples 3R-CC, 4R-CC, and 5R-CC).  

Fourteen planktonic foraminifer and calcareous nannofossi l biostratigraphic events were used to provide an age-depth mode l for Site U1502 from the late Oligocene to the late Miocene. Th e Pliocene/Miocene boundary is placed tentatively in Core 368- U1502A-2R, but it may be shallower than the cored section. Th e Miocene/Oligocene boundary was determined to lie between Samples 39R-CC and 40R-1, 7 cm. Sedimentation rates vary from ${\sim}10$ $\mathrm{mm/ky}$ in the early–middle Miocene to ${\sim}39\mathrm{\mm/ky}$ in the late Miocene. No planktonic microfossils were found in Hole U1502B, but  a sample from the sandy interval in Core 3R revealed abundant an d diverse abyssal agglutinated benthic foraminifers. The compositio n of this agglutinated benthic foraminifer assemblage provides a possible age of late Eocene for this interval.

# Paleomagnetism  

The magnetic behavior of sediments at Site U1502 correlate s with their color (greenish gray or reddish brown). Reddish brow n sediment shows AF magnetization indicative of magnetite o r titanomagnetite and hematite (responsible for the color). In contrast, greenish gray sediment hosts magnetite or titanomagnetit e and pyrrhotite. The predominance of steep normal inclination s $(\sim\!75^{\circ}$ ; Figure F20) across all late Oligocene to late Miocene unit s $(375.00{-}750.67\;\mathrm{m})$ affects the SRM section measurements and prevents any reliable magnetostratigraphy to be established for Hole s U1502A and U1502B.  

The basalt has NRM intensity one order of magnitude highe r than sediment. The main magnetically remanent phase is titanomagnetite, but its alteration produces maghemite or hematite. Magnetic susceptibility (κ) has a bimodal distribution with a median a t $327~\times~10^{-6}$ SI. κ does not show any strong correlation with an y chemical $\!R^{2}=0.343$ for $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ . Intervals of high κ might correspond to the bottoms of flows with a massive, less altered structure. Altered basalts have higher Koenigsberger ratios $\left(Q_{\mathrm{n}}=1{-}10\right)$ tha n fresher basalts $\!\!\!\phantom{0}Q_{\mathrm{n}}=0.001{-}1\!\!\!$ ). The mean dip of magnetic foliatio n is $8^{\circ}$ .  

Cores 368-U1502B-9R and 10R show less-pervasive drillin g overprint, and two discrete samples show both a normal (soft) component and a reverse (hard) component, suggesting a possible reversal.  

# Geochemistry  

Site U1502 contains very low high-hydrocarbon gas abundance s and TOC, nitrogen, and sulfur contents, likely reflecting the poo r preservation of organic matter. Instances of high carbonate conten t are associated with siderite, and on occasion this mineral comprise s $>\!50\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ by mass of intervals in lithostratigraphic Subunit ID. Th e interstitial water at Site U1502 is enriched in Ca, Mg, and K and ha s notably high alkalinity but is depleted in Na, Cl, and Br. The linea r increase of major anion and cation contents implies upward movement of fluid from deeper sediments. The hemipelagic sediments in Unit I have some similarities to the geochemical characteristics o f the hemipelagic and pelagic units at Sites U1501 and U1505, bu t Site U1502 sediments are enriched in Fe, K, and clay concentrations, likely as a result of regions of increased alteration. All of th e analyzed igneous rocks from Units II–VI are heavily altered, although samples from igneous lithologic Subunit 2b are altered to  a lesser degree than those from Subunit 2a.  

![](images/7fe758bc4a2180ca2c8521b1272f418494b4c2762f79fbfe30736f94655f5163.jpg)  
Figure F21. Physical property records, Site U1502.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property data acquired at Site U1502 include density, magnetic susceptibility, $P$ -wave velocity, NGR, color reflectance, and thermal conductivity (Figure F21). These data allow us to characterize four physical property (PP) units. PP Unit 1 $(375{-}740\ \mathrm{m})$ corresponds to the nannofossil-rich and biosiliceous-rich clay lithologies and exhibits small variations in NGR between 50 and 7 0 counts/s and uniformly increasing $P$ -wave velocity with depth tha t averages $<\!2500\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Unit 1 sediments have similar porosity to thos e recorded at nearby Sites U1499 and U1500 in the same depth interval, suggesting the same compaction history. A significant increas e in bulk density (up to $2.7\ \mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ ) in Core 368-U1502B-3R is associated with strongly lithified limestone beds. Variations of high an d low magnetic susceptibility values correspond to sediment colo r changes in Unit 1 and may be controlled by the amount of pyrrhotite in the sediments.  

PP Unit 2 $(740{-}750\,\mathrm{~m~})$ in Hole U1502A is characterized b y lower $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity and bulk density and higher NGR than th e strata above. Low density and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity found in Unit 2 reflect the clast-rich claystone from lithostratigraphic Unit V.  

PP Units 3 and 4 represent the basaltic basement and are characterized by relatively low NGR ( $_{<10}$ counts/s), high density, and $P_{-}$ - wave velocity that vary over a broad range $(3000{-}6000\ \mathrm{m/s})$ . Th e boundary between Units 3 and 4 is marked by an abrupt increase i n density, $P$ -wave velocity, and thermal conductivity and coincide s with the change from igneous lithologic Subunit 2a to 2b. Prominent magnetic susceptibility peaks (up to $4000\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}_{.}$ ) in Units  3 and 4 correspond to relatively less altered basalt. Thermal conductivity in Units 3 and 4 are variable but generally increases in lin e with decreasing porosity with depth.  

# Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging was conducted in Hole U1502B using a modified triple combo tool string and the VSI tool string. The modifie d triple combo tool string included the HNGS, HLDS, and Dipol e Sonic Imager (DSI) for acoustic velocity. The triple combo run collected good data downhole from $875.3\;\mathrm{m}$ ( $\mathord{\sim}45\;\mathrm{m}$ above the botto m of Hole U1502B) and allowed us to define eight logging units, whic h correlate in great part to the lithostratigraphic units and core physical properties. Logging Units 1–5 are defined by data collecte d through the casing and drill pipe. Unit 6 data was collected outsid e the casing but inside the drill pipe, whereas data in Units 7 and  8 were collected in the open hole. For measurements inside the casin g and/or drill pipe, only NGR and the associated K, Th, and U components provide meaningful data, although they are highly attenuate d by the casing and/or drill pipe. Open borehole conditions from th e bottom of the casing at $723\;\mathrm{m}$ to $875.3\;\mathrm{m}$ were generally good, wit h measured diameters from 12 to 14.5 inches. Log and core data generally show good agreement, and downhole measurements provid e information in zones of poor core recovery in Hole U1502B. The lo g data exhibit increasing density and $P$ -wave velocity with depth. Th e amplitude of NGR increases gradually with depth throughout Unit s 1–3 (seafloor to ${\sim}630\;\mathrm{m})$ , with an interval of relatively constant values between 150 and $350\mathrm{~m~}$ . NGR values are lowest in Units 4– 8 $(\mathord{\sim}630\mathord{-}850\;\mathrm{m})$ .  

The VSI tool string was run only inside the casing because th e tool could not pass through an obstruction encountered at the en d of the casing. Eight stations were attempted. The two deepest stations (at 715.1 and $695.2\ \mathrm{m})$ ) are associated with large noise levels, which were possibly caused by poor mechanical coupling of the casing with the surrounding formation. The remaining upper six stations, located at 290.2, 350.3, 450.3, 550.1, 590.3, and $630.3\,\mathrm{~m},$ recorded good quality waveforms.  

# Site U1503  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1503 (proposed Site SCSII-9B; Sun et al., 2016b) is locate d at 3868 mbsl near the top of the structural high named Ridge C (Figures F3, F22). Ridge C is the most seaward ridge of the three margin-parallel  Ridges  A,  B,  and  C  that  characterize  the  lowe r continental slope underlain by thin $(5{-}7~\mathrm{km})$ crust. Ridge C is believed to represent at least partly, if not fully, igneous crust an d hence the completion of continental breakup along this margin segment of the northern SCS.

Figure F22. Bathymetry at Site U1503 and location of the site in relation t o seismic Lines 15ecLW5 and 08ec1555.  

A key operational objective of Site U1503 was to sample the lowermost ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediments on top of basement to constrain th e age and subsidence history of the crust at this location, the timing o f normal faulting, and the environment of the early half-graben fill. The most important goal was to sample the igneous stratigraphy t o at least $100\,\mathrm{m}$ below the basement. Because of a rig floor equipmen t failure (drawworks), we abandoned the site after installing casing i n Hole U1503A to $991.5\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Deep, representative sampling of the basaltic material at this sit e would have provided an important reference frame for breaku p modeling. With an estimated $1640~\mathrm{m}$ sediment thickness overlyin g basement, obtaining basement samples and log data at this site represented a challenging operation.  

# Operations  

To reach our objectives, we conducted operations in one hol e (U1503A; $18^{\circ}08.6300^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $116^{\circ}18.8456^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $3868~\mathrm{mbsl}_{\cdot}$ ) (Table T2). W e successfully installed a reentry system and $991.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing in Hole U1503A. However, we were unable to deepen the hol e below the casing because of repeated breakdowns of the low clutc h diaphragm in the drawworks and concerns that we did not hav e enough spares to last the remainder of the expedition. Without th e drawworks’ low clutch, we could not conduct drilling operation s deeper than $3400\;\mathrm{m}$ (water depth plus penetration depth). Becaus e Site U1503 had a planned depth of $5695\;\mathrm{m}$ (water depth plus penetration depth), we abandoned Hole U1503A without addressing an y scientific objectives. Hole U1503A remains cased and open for possible future occupation.  

# Site U1504  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1504 (alternate Site SCSII-27A) was proposed during Expedition 367 and approved by the Environmental Protection an d Safety Panel during Expedition 368 as an alternate site should ther e be time left following completion of the high-priority sites include d in the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Expedition 368 occupied Site U1504 because of the inability to continue drilling belo w the $990\,\mathrm{~m~}$ deep, cased Hole U1503A. Most of our remaining approved sites were in water deeper than $3400\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and/or require d deep penetration. One exception was Site U1504, which is locate d at 2823 mbsl \~45 km east of Site U1501 on the OMH and has a shallow coring target (Figures F3, F23) and targets the nature of basement within the COT.  

# Operations  

Two holes were drilled at Site U1504 (Table T2). In Hol e U1504A $\mathrm{[18^{\circ}50.9199^{\prime}N}$ , 116°14.5397′E; 2816.6 mbsl), we cored wit h the RCB system from the seafloor to metamorphic basement a t $134.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and then into basement to $165.5\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , recovering $52.77\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(32\%)$ . In Hole U1504B ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{~m~}$ southeast of Hole U1504A; $18^{\circ}50.8213^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $116^{\circ}14.5978^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; $2843.0~\mathrm{mbsl}$ ), we drilled without recovery to $88.2\,\mathrm{m}$ , cored with the RCB system to metamorphic basement at $107.9\,\mathrm{m}$ , and then cored into basement to $200\,\mathrm{m}$ , recoverin g $21.48\;\mathrm{m}\;(19\%)$ .  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The succession recovered at Site U1504 includes two sedimentary units (I and II) underlain by a metamorphic unit (III). Lithostratigraphic Unit I (early Miocene–Pleistocene) is dominated b y

nannofossil and foraminiferal ooze and minor nannofossil-rich cla y and is divided into four subunits (IA–ID). Subunit IA (Hole U1504 A $=17.50–46.59\ \mathrm{m})$ is composed of nannofossil-rich clay, nannofossi l ooze, nannofossil ooze with biogenic silica, and clay-rich nannofossil ooze. The color of the ooze gradually changes downhole fro m dark greenish gray to greenish gray and gray. Distinct intervals contain more silt. Thin silt laminations are often disrupted by bioturbation. Layering is contorted at the base of the subunit. Subunit I B (Hole $\mathrm{U1504A}=46.59{-}59.73\ \mathrm{m})$ is composed of light brown foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze and pale brown nannofossil ooze wit h foraminifers. Subunit IC (Hole $\mathrm{U1504A}=65.80–104.99\ \mathrm{m})$ is composed of light greenish gray, greenish gray, light brownish gray, pal e brown, and light gray nannofossil ooze with clay and greenish gra y clay-rich nannofossil ooze intercalated with light gray nannofossilrich foraminiferal ooze with clay, light brownish gray foraminiferrich nannofossil ooze, and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze wit h clay. Subunit ID (Hole $\mathrm{U1504A}\,=\,104.99–112.66\ \mathrm{m};$ Hole U1504 B $=88.20{-}92.31\ \mathrm{m})$ is composed of light brown to yellowish brow n nannofossil ooze with foraminifers intercalated with pink or brownish yellow foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze. Unit II (possibly Eocene; Hole $\mathrm{U1504A\,=\,114.72{-}134.80\,\ m;}$ ; Hole $\mathrm{U1504B}\;=\;97.90-$ $107.91\,\mathrm{~m~}$ is clast-supported, bioclast-rich limestone with large r benthic foraminifers (as large as $15~\mathrm{mm}$ ). Unit III (age unknown ; Hole $\mathrm{U1504A}\,=\,136.40–163.70~\mathrm{m};$ Hole $\mathrm{U1504B}\,=\,117.40{-}196.28$ m) is composed of fine- to coarse-grained epidote-chlorite schis t (Subunit IIIA) and calc-silicate schist (Subunit IIIB) with granofel s clasts.  

# Metamorphic petrology  

We recovered $27\;\mathrm{m}$ (Hole U1504A) and $79\;\mathrm{m}$ (Hole U1504B) o f a variety of mylonitic epidote-chlorite to calc-silicate schists containing granofels clasts. Recovery was ${<}20\%$ in metamorphic lithologic Unit 1. Lithologic changes with depth and between the tw o holes were observed, and Unit 1 is divided based on a change in th e predominant metamorphic lithology (Figure F24). Metamorphi c lithologic Subunit 1a was recovered in both Holes U1504A an d U1504B and consists of greenish gray, microcrystalline to coarsegrained epidote-chlorite schist with dark greenish gray granofel s clasts $\left({<}10\ \mathrm{cm}\right)$ and epidote-chlorite breccia. The schists show  a strong mylonitic foliation, whereas the clasts have generally isotropic textures showing local weakly developed foliation. Both th e schist and the granofels clasts show, in general, a comparable mineral assemblage consisting of epidote, chlorite, feldspar, and quart z $\pm$ other phyllosilicates and accessory minerals and locally isolate d subhedral dark minerals (pyroxene?). The granofels clasts are ofte n crosscut by a network of quartz veins. Subunit 1b contains an alternation of calc-silicate schist and epidote-chlorite schist with granofels clasts, epidote and/or chlorite granofels, chlorite schist wit h epidote, epidote-chlorite gneiss, and minor marble. The lithologie s are fine grained to coarse grained with mostly an inequigranula r texture and some bimodal or equigranular textures, and the schistose sections show a strong mylonitic foliation. Several of the schist s show reddish brown alteration, and late calcite veins crosscut th e foliation of the deepest schists recovered (e.g., in Core 368- U1504A-20R). Minerals observed are epidote, quartz, chlorite, calcite, and feldspar. Subunit 1b contains numerous clasts with variable lithologies: cryptocrystalline granofels either with or withou t quartz and/or calcite veins, porphyritic rocks with tabular phenocrysts (possibly altered plagioclase), brecciated (epidote, calcite, and/or quartz) veins, and foliated granofels.  

Handheld pXRF analyses show an average mafic igneous composition for both the schist and the clasts but with a spread towar d ultramafic (in Hole U1504B Subunit 1a) and more felsic compositions (in Subunit 1b). A clear change in sulfur contents occurs between Subunits 1a and 1b, the latter of which is below the detectio n limit. High Nb contents compared to MORB indicate a potentiall y enriched source for the protolith.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit III (metamorphic lithologic Unit 1) consists of mylonitic greenschist facies metamorphic rocks, as indicated by the presence of epidote and chlorite. We infer that th e protolith most likely was breccia based on the different clast size s and types and styles of deformation. The protolith likely had a mafi c igneous composition. It is, however, unclear if this breccia wit h mafic clasts has a sedimentary origin (e.g., volcaniclastic) or represents a potentially hydrothermally altered form of basalt, gabbro, or ultramafic protolith. At present, the metamorphic evolution o f this unit and its possible connection with the opening of the SCS i s unknown.  

# Structural geology  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I shows subhorizontal bedding and locally some minor possible slump folds, as observed in Section 368- U1504A-5R-1. Unit II is devoid of any deformation structures. Th e metamorphic basement at Site U1504 is formed by greenschist facies mylonitic epidote-chlorite schists and calc-silicate schists (Uni t III). The rocks preserve distinct deformation structures resultin g from changes in the mode of deformation (brittle/ductile); th e modal amount of quartz $^+$ feldspar governing the (local) rheological behavior; the amount of accumulated strain; the occurrence of variably sized (up to decimeter scale), prekinematic, heterolithic clast s that mostly form rigid (i.e., internally undeformed) bodies in th e ductile  foliation;  and/or  superimposed  multiple  deformatio n phases. The steeply dipping (up to $75^{\circ}$ ) mylonitic foliation is characterized by distinct morphologies: (1) a widely spaced anastomosin g foliation associated with leucocratic bands; (2) a tight, closel y

spaced, and often crenulated foliation associated with more melanocratic schist variations; and (3) a tight anastomosing foliation associated with calc-silicate schists enclosing angular to rounde d heterolithic granofels clasts. Locally, the sense of shear is indicate d by shear bands and sigma clasts. In metamorphic lithologic Subuni t 1a (Figure F24), granofels clasts are consistently microcrystallin e (chlorite $^+$ epidote) and dismembered by a network of mostly parallel and perpendicular quartz veins cutting each other. They ofte n form apparently stretched, elongated bodies oriented parallel to th e foliation. Subunit 1b shows a wide range of prekinematic (mostl y mafic) clasts enclosed by the foliation. Encountered varieties encompass highly phyric to aphyric rocks, as well as fragmented former (epidote/calcite/quartz) vein fillings. In some cases, such clast s show ductile internal deformation. Clast boundaries can be eithe r distinctly sharp or diffuse, the latter indicating mechanical and/o r chemical interactions with the surrounding foliation. Deformatio n in Subunit 1b is presumably strongly controlled by an inherite d (protolithic) brecciated structure.  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples at Site U1504 were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, and diatoms. Additional sample s were taken from intervals in the working-half core sections whe n necessary to refine the ages. Preservation of calcareous microfossil s is good to very good in Cores 368-U1504A-2R through 12R, an d 368-U1504B-2R and is poorly preserved (recrystallization) in th e reefal limestone below Core 368-U1504A-12R. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils are abundant in Cores 368- U1504A-2R through 12R and 368-U1504B-2R and barren in Core s 368-U1504A-13R through 15R. Diatoms are present but poorly preserved in Cores 368-U1504A-2R through 5R and absent in rest o f the samples. Twenty biostratigraphic datums were identified in  a succession from the late Pleistocene to the early Miocene.  

A possible hiatus between the early Pleistocene and late Miocene was determined in Core 368-U1504A-6R by abrupt planktoni c foraminifer and nannofossil assemblage changes. Sedimentatio n rates at this site varied from ${\sim}6\mathrm{\mm/ky}$ in the early middle Miocen e to ${\sim}22\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{ky}$ during the Pleistocene.  

Cores 368-U1504A-13R through 15R are mainly composed o f reefal and larger benthic foraminiferal limestone. Thin section examination of these carbonate rocks indicates the presence of abundant Nummulites, suggesting an Eocene age. The abundant large r benthic foraminifers indicate deposition in a warm shallow-marin e environment. In contrast, the abundant planktonic foraminifers an d calcareous nannofossils in the carbonate ooze in the overlying sedimentary section (Cores 2R through 12R) indicate a deep-water environment since the early Miocene.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Most of the discrete sediment samples analyzed show an initia l soft magnetic behavior attributed to titanomagnetite followed by  a gyroremanent magnetization (GRM) greater than $70\;\mathrm{mT}$ attribute d to greigite, a mineral already identified in Hole U1501C. Consistently steep normal inclinations $(\sim\!60^{\circ})$ across all sedimentary unit s indicate a significant drilling overprint that is removed by AF demagnetization up to $15~\mathrm{mT}.$ A succession of nine normal and eigh t reversed polarities are defined, particularly in the upper part of th e cores.  

Discrete samples show low κ values, a moderate degree of magnetic anisotropy, and strongly oblate symmetry, probably of depositional origin. This subhorizontal planar fabric indicates depositio n in a calm, pelagic environment with moderate traction.  

NRM intensities of metamorphic rocks, measured on the SR M and on four discrete cubes, are relatively weak and indicate a complex magnetic assemblage composed of magnetite and hematite. The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) fabrics consistently dip steeply and show a moderate to high degree of magneti c anisotropy, oblate symmetries, and oblique magnetic lineations, possibly indicating an oblique motion in this high-strain shear zone.  

# Geochemistry  

Hydrocarbon gases were not detected above background level s at Site U1504, and TOC, TN, and TS contents were low $(<\!0.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ . Instances of high carbonate content were associated with bioclastrich and clast-supported limestone. The upper part of the sedimen t was not cored. Interstitial water data from the cored sediments ar e broadly comparable to other sites.  

# Physical properties  

Four physical properties (PP) units are identified at Site U150 4 according to variations in the core physical properties. Core material in PP Units 1 and 2 consists of soft sediments. In general, wit h respect to Unit 2, Unit 1 has a higher average NGR ${\sim}30$ versus 2 0 counts/s), a weaker color reflectance (mean $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ of ${\sim}40$ versus 50), and a lower average red, green, blue (RGB) value (100 versus 150). These changes in physical properties between Units 1 and 2 correspond to a switch in sediment composition from nannofossil-ric h clay to nannofossil ooze. A general increase in bulk (from ${\sim}1.4$ to 1. 8 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ and dry (from ${\sim}0.7$ to $1.2\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ) densities and a downhol e decrease in porosity (from $75\%$ to $56\%$ ) in Units 1 and 2 mainly indicate sediment compaction with time. The boundary between Unit s 1 and 2 is marked by a relatively rapid increase in $P$ -wave velocit y and bulk density and a rapid decrease in porosity compared with th e general trends mentioned above. This physical property boundar y corresponds to an unconformity in the seismic profile and to a hiatus confirmed by the biostratigraphic data.  

$P$ -wave velocity and bulk density increase from $\mathord{\sim}3800$ to 500 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ and from ${\sim}2.4$ to $2.9\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively, in Unit 3, which corresponds to a transition in lithology from coral-rich limestone t o clast-supported limestone. Coral-rich limestone in the upper portion of Unit 3 is also associated with a moderately high porosity o f $\sim\!23\%$ . Unit 4 is characterized by uniformly high velocity of ${\sim}5500$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ , high bulk density of ${\sim}2.9~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ , and low porosity of ${\sim}3\%$ , which correspond to the epidote-chlorite schist. A large increase i n both velocity and density at the Unit 2/3 and Unit 3/4 boundarie s corresponds to strong reflectors in the seismic data. The gradual downhole increase in thermal conductivity values at shallow depth s is likely due to progressive compaction of the sediments.  

# Site U1505  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1505 (proposed Site SCSII-3D) is located at $2916.6\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth on a broad regional basement high (Figure F25). This sit e was an alternate to Site U1501, should time be left for drilling following completion of the high-priority sites included in the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Site U1505 was included i n Expedition 368 because it might complement findings at Sit e U1501, and it was in the operational limits of the $3400\:\mathrm{m}$ drill strin g imposed by the failure of the drawworks.  

Both Sites U1505 and U1501 are located on the same structura l high at similar water depths and are $10.5\,\mathrm{km}$ apart (Figure F2). Th e seismic section at Site U1505 generally shows a more horizontal orientation of the seismic reflectors and concordant relationship of th e strata than the one at Site U1501, indicating the sediment sequenc e

![](images/9b8ae1018182341fe5886b5f8adc432a05283d97643d26de06c43ecab76dcd62.jpg)  

at Site U1505 should be more complete. The key objective at Sit e U1505 was to sample the stratigraphic record above seismic Unconformity T80 (inferred before drilling to be ${\sim}38\mathrm{\Ma}_{.}$ ), and specifi c goals were to constrain both (1) the sediment responses to the tectonic events and basin evolution since the Eocene and (2) Neogen e paleoceanographic  and  paleoclimatological  changes  along  th e northern SCS margin.  

The relatively shallow $2916.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth at Site U150 5 makes it one of the few ODP/Integrated Ocean Drilling Program/IODP sites above the modern CCD of the SCS. The site’ s hemipelagic deposits, rich in calcareous microfossils, enable the application of stable isotopes, faunal analyses, and other multidisciplinary methods. Key objectives were to reconstruct the east Asia n monsoonal climate record in the SCS and upper- and deep-wate r variations in the western Pacific. Site U1505 will, for the first time, provide an almost continuous sequence of paleoceanographic studies at orbital and millennial timescales since the late Eocene in th e SCS. We cored two deep holes at this site with the APC/XCB syste m to obtain a continuous record of the Pliocene–Pleistocene interva l for high-resolution paleoceanographic studies.  

# Operations  

Four holes were cored with the APC and XCB systems at Sit e U1505 (Table T2). In Hole U1505A $\mathrm{[18^{\circ}55.0560^{\prime}N},$ , $115^{\circ}51.5369^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; $2916.6~\mathrm{m}$ water depth), Core 1H misfired and recovered only $0.3\;\mathrm{m}$ . In Hole U1505B $(18^{\circ}55.0562^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}51.5370^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; $2918.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth), a $3.23\;\mathrm{m}$ long mudline core was recovered for future education  and  outreach  activities.  Hole  U1505C $(18^{\circ}55.0570^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $115^{\circ}51.5370^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; 2917.4 m water depth) was cored with the APC system to $317~\mathrm{m}$ and then cored with the XCB system to $480.2\ \mathrm{m},$ recovering  480.15  m $(100\%)$ .  Hole  U1505D $(18^{\circ}55.0485^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ 115°51.5501′E; $2917.5\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth) was cored with the APC system to $184.5~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $191.43\;\mathrm{m}$ $(104\%)$ ). Downhole loggin g with a modified triple combo tool string was conducted in Hol e  

U1505C from $341.2\,\mathrm{~m~}$ uphole. The maximum drilling depth o f $480.2\,\textrm{m}$ was determined by the possible maximum total lengt h $\left(3400\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ of drill string deployment.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The sediment succession recovered at Site U1505 extends fro m the Oligocene to the Pleistocene. Two sedimentary units (I and II ) were observed (Figure F26). Lithostratigraphic Unit I is dominate d by nannofossil ooze with varying amounts of foraminifers and clay, as well as biogenic silica in the upper interval of the hole. Unit I i s divided into three subunits (IA–IC). Subunit IA (Hole $\mathrm{U}1505C\ =$ $0.00{-}27.76\;\mathrm{m})$ ) is composed of dark greenish gray and greenish gra y biosiliceous-rich clay with nannofossils, nannofossil-rich clay wit h biogenic silica, and nannofossil-rich biosiliceous ooze with clay. Th e abundance of biogenic silica decreases downhole. A pinkish gray, ${\sim}6$ cm thick, slightly fining upward ash layer occurs at $20.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Hol e U1505C), and ash pods were observed at $20.3~\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1505D. Subunit IB (Hole $[1505C=27.76{-}273.39\mathrm{~m})$ is composed of gray t o brown nannofossil ooze with minor silty intervals. The color chang e reflects the varying abundance of foraminifers and clay. Subunit I C (Hole $[1505C\,=\,273.39{-}403.79\ \mathrm{m})$ is composed of gray, greenis h gray, and light brownish gray clay-rich nannofossil ooze (with foraminifers) and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze with clay and mino r amounts of nannofossil-rich clay. Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1}505\mathrm{C}=403.50-$ $480.54\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ) is dominated by dark greenish gray, well-consolidate d silty clay and clayey silt (with nannofossils).  

# Biostratigraphy  

All core catcher samples from Holes U1505A–U1505C were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and diatoms.  Additional  samples  were  taken  from  intervals  in  th e working-half sections when necessary to refine the ages. Hol e U1505D was not sampled continuously for biostratigraphic analyse s because of time constraints at the end of the expedition, but the sequence recovered spans from the late Miocene to the present (Figure F26). Preservation of calcareous microfossils is good in Core s 368-U1505C-1H through 48X and moderate to poor in Cores 49 X through 64X. Planktonic foraminifers are abundant or common i n Cores 1H through 56X and 59X through 62X and rare in Cores 57X, 58X, 63X, and 64X. Calcareous nannofossils are generally abundan t to common in most samples from Hole U1505C, except for thos e from the upper part of Core 57X.  

Forty-five biostratigraphic datums identified in Hole U1505 C suggest a continuous succession from the early Oligocene to th e Holocene (Figure F26). The Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary i s placed in Core 7H, the Pliocene/Miocene boundary is placed between Cores 11H and 13H, and the Miocene/Oligocene boundary i s placed between Cores 54X and $55\mathrm{X}$ . Sedimentation rates are ${\sim}7$ $\mathrm{mm/ky}$ in the Oligocene, ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{ky}$ during the Miocene–Pliocene, and ${\sim}24\mathrm{\mm/ky}$ during the Pleistocene.  

Relatively low abundances of planktonic foraminifers deepe r than Core 57X indicate bathyal depths during the early Oligocene, whereas much higher abundances of planktonic foraminifers shallower than Core 56X suggest a deeper water environment since th e late Oligocene.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Only NRM was measured with the SRM in Hole U1505C, excep t for Sections 1H-1 through 3H-1, which were in-line AF demagnetized in three steps. Most of the 55 AF demagnetized discrete samples  show  very  soft  magnetic  behavior  responsible  for  th e acquisition of a strong, vertical drilling overprint (average inclina

tion $=\,{\sim}81^{\circ}$ ) that was removed by demagnetization to $10{-}15~\mathrm{mT}$ This soft behavior shows that magnetic remanence is dominated b y multidomain to pseudosingle-domain titanomagnetite or magnetite. The drilling overprint appears to impact discrete samples fa r less than core sections (Figure F27). The lower part of the hol e (Cores 48X through 64X) is characterized by severe drilling disturbance, which causes a large scatter of NRM directions and inclinations.   
Magnetostratigraphic data are based on polarities assigned t o the archive-half sections and corroborated by directions obtaine d from oriented discrete samples. The lower boundary of the Brunhe s (C1n) normal chron is at $37.4~\mathrm{m}$ $(0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . The lower boundar y $(57.4\mathrm{~m})$ of the reverse polarity r1 is the base of Subchron C1r.3 r with an age of $1.778\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .

# Geochemistry  

Low but measurable hydrocarbon gases were detected only i n Cores 368-U1505C-53X through 60X $(371\!-\!438\;\mathrm{m})$ . The base of th e hole has methane distributions similar to those at Site U1499, whereas the uppermost section is barren of methane, similar to Sit e U1501. Except for the shallowest $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, TOC, TN, an d TS contents are mostly low in lithostratigraphic Unit I, but TS an d TOC are slightly higher in Unit II; however, in all cases they are typically ${<}1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ (Figure F28). Interstitial water chemistry has two important features. The upper part of the hole exhibits pattern s similar to those at Site U1501; inhibited sulfate reduction and lo w chlorine, bromine, and salinity suggest the presence of freshwater a t depth. Freshwater at ${>}400\,\mathrm{~m~}$ coincides with the presence of lo w quantities of methane and the T60 regional seismic unconformity.  

# Physical properties and downhole measurements  

Physical property data were acquired from cores from Hole s U1505C $(0{-}480.5\,\textrm{m})$ and U1505D $(0{-}184\,\mathrm{~m)}$ ), including density, magnetic susceptibility, $P$ -wave velocity, NGR, color reflectance, and thermal conductivity. Physical property trends allow us to define two physical property units, PP Units 1 $(0{-}403\;\mathrm{m})$ and 2 $(403-$ $480\,\mathrm{\,m},$ ). The boundary between Units 1 and 2 displays a distinc t color change from greenish and light brownish gray to dark greenish gray. This boundary, which corresponds to the seismic stratigraphic T60 unconformity, is associated with a sharp change i n physical properties. In Unit 1, sediments in the upper part are composed of foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze with clay that graduall y changes to clay-rich nannofossil ooze in the lower part. This chang e is well reflected in the NGR, which increases with depth. The highe r NGR in Unit 2 is related to sediment that primarily consists of silt y clay. Magnetic susceptibility overall gradually decreases with depth. The boundary between Units 1 and 2 shows that density and $P.$ -wav e velocity drops sharply from ${\sim}2.2$ to ${\sim}1.8~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ and from ${\sim}2250$ t o $1750~\mathrm{m/s}$ , respectively. Porosity abruptly increases from $\sim\!35\%$ t o $\sim\!50\%$ . Thermal conductivity also shows a sharp change at th e boundary. Reflectance parameter $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ and RGB data are well correlated with carbonate content.  

![](images/4c035dca57f8ab276198c2a48b0583752782fc59b4d0282066bcde895f4a56fe.jpg)  

Wireline logging was conducted in Hole U1505C using the tripl e combo tool string, which included the HNGS, HLDS, DSI, an d MSS. This logging string collected good data from $341.2\:\mathrm{m}$ ( $\mathrm{139.1\,m}$ above the bottom of Hole U1505C), which allows the definition o f six logging units that mostly correlate with the lithostratigraphi c units and core physical property data. Logging Unit 1 extends fro m the seafloor to the base of the drill pipe at $78~\mathrm{m}$ . NGR is highly attenuated inside the drill pipe. Logging Unit 2 (base of the drill pip e to $96\;\mathrm{m}$ ) exhibits NGR values that are ${\sim}50\%$ lower than the underlying logging Unit 3. In Unit 3 $(96{-}136\,\mathrm{m})$ ), NGR increases with depth. Logging Unit 4 $(136{-}220\;\mathrm{m})$ exhibits relatively constant $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ . In logging Unit 5 $(200{-}296\,\textrm{m})$ , resistivity increases with depth, whereas most of the other physical properties are relatively constant. Logging Unit 6 $296{-}341.2\;\mathrm{m})$ has higher magnetic susceptibility values than logging Unit 5.  

Four downhole temperature measurements were conducted i n Hole U1505C using the APCT-3. The temperature values rang e from $4.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $36.7~\mathrm{m}$ to $11.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $122.8\;\mathrm{m}$ , giving a geothermal gradient of $84.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . A heat flow of $94.0~\mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ was obtained fro m the linear fit between temperature and thermal resistance. The geothermal gradient and heat flow at Site U1505 are comparable to th e relatively high values observed in a number of ODP and IODP site s in this part of the SCS.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

In this section, we assess the achievements of Expeditio n 367/368 in the SCS toward meeting the four specific objectives a s stated in the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Expedition 36 7 followed the original drilling plan and cored into acoustic basemen t at Ridges A and B and progressed without significant delays. However, based on Expedition 367 results, Expedition 368 followed  a modified drilling plan that included a second drill site on Ridge A. Drilling plans for Expedition 368 were further modified due to serious drilling equipment failures at deep-water Site U1503 on Ridge  C (see Site U1503). This failure limited the drilling capability of th e JOIDES Resolution to a maximum $3400\mathrm{~m~}$ drill string deploymen t from 25 May 2017 to the end of the expedition on 11 June. Only  a couple of alternate drill sites could be addressed with this limit o n drill string length. Two of these, both on the OMH, were implemented (Sites U1504 and U1505). Furthermore, expedition tim e spent from 14 to 25 May installing casing to $990\;\mathrm{m}$ for primary Sit e U1503 was de facto time wasted for the expedition because the sit e could not be completed, but it left an important drill site ready fo r coring in the future. The overall effects of this operational constraint are that it directed efforts more toward Objective 4 (Sit e U1505) than originally planned and that the tectonic high-priorit y Site U1503 was lost for Expedition 367/368.  

1. To determine the nature of the basement in critical crustal units across the COT of the SCS rifted margin to discriminate between different competing models of breakup at magma-poor rifted margins. Specifically, to determine whether the subcontinental lithospheric mantle was exhumed during plate rupture.  

This objective was partly achieved with the potential for  a higher degree of completion during postexpedition research. However, eventually Site U1503 needs to be completed, and further efforts need to be made to understand the deep nature of Ridge A.  

Site U1499 at Ridge A provided important clues to the timing o f tectonism but failed to provide direct evidence for its deeper crustal composition. Site U1502, originally an alternate site to Site U1499, was therefore pursued because the nature of Ridge A was considered a very high priority and the most likely place to recover eithe r deep crust or exhumed mantle. To give this site priority was a significant decision and deviation from the drilling plan in the Scientifi c Prospectus and potentially affected our ability to address an important site on Ridge C (Site U1503).  

Site U1499 on Ridge A successfully penetrated into the acousti c basement, which comprises synrift and/or postrift deposits of Oligocene or possibly older age. The clasts found in these partly coars e sediments do not contain lithologies that suggest a source of lowermost crust to exhumed mantle origin. Therefore, the nature of th e deeper crust at Site U1499 remains unconstrained by direct sampling. Site U1502, also on Ridge A, recovered ${\sim}180\;\mathrm{m}$ of submarin e basalts of possible late Eocene to Oligocene age overlain by late Eocene/Oligocene to Miocene deep-water sediments. Onboard preliminary ICP-AES element analyses indicate they are tholeiiti c basalt and are comparable to samples from the ocean crust in th e SCS collected during Expedition 349 and from Site U1500 at Ridg e B. However, unlike the fresh basalts of Site U1500, the Site U150 2 basalts show strong fracturing and alteration by high temperatur e hydrothermal activity, including mineralization (e.g., massive pyrite). This difference may suggest that the deeper crust comprise s plutonic bodies but does not further constrain the nature of th e deep crust.  

Combining the findings at Site U1502 with the recovery at Sit e U1499 (Expedition 367; Ridge A) of potentially rift-related syntectonic or prerift sediments suggests that Ridge A is a comple x structure comprising both rift-related sediments and syntectoni c igneous material. The specific question of whether upper/lowe r crust or subcontinental lithospheric mantle is present at depth, however, remains unanswered by coring data. Detailed examinatio n of the recovered basalts and of the gravel unit may help constrai n the specific nature of the deeper crust. Future dedicated geophysica l surveying and one or two more deep drill holes will be required t o firmly advance our understanding of Ridge A.  

The nature of the acoustic basement below Ridge B was successfully determined at Site U1500. This site recovered $150~\mathrm{m}$ of fresh, submarine basalts of Oligocene age in a location where seismic imaging shows a layered structure below the acoustic basement, extending to ${\sim}2.5\ \mathrm{{km}}$ depth. The presence of a kilometer-thic k carapace of basaltic lavas in the upper crust is therefore concluded. However, this carapace does not prove this $\sim\!6\,\mathrm{km}$ thick crust to b e entirely igneous, and its lower part conceivably could contai n stretched continental lithosphere.  

The nature of the crust at the OMH was well addressed at Sit e U1501. This site drilled ${\sim}45\mathrm{~m~}$ into the prerift? acoustic basemen t beneath the Cenozoic sedimentary section and recovered lithified, coarse-grained sedimentary rocks of presumed Mesozoic age. Thi s finding verified our predrilling interpretation of the OMH as comprising upper continental crustal material. The basement of th e easternmost extension of the OMH was also sampled at Site U1504. In this location, greenschist facies metamorphic rock was found, suggesting that only a moderate amount $\left({\sim}5\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ of upper crust wa s removed prior to deposition of the thin, mainly postbreakup sediments that overlie the basement. The timing of the removal of th e uppermost crust is constrained to be at least before the late Eocene. Postexpedition work on age determination and thermobarometr y may constrain an exhumation history and its possible relation to th e Cenozoic rifting of the SCS.  

Our inability to pursue deep drilling at Site U1503 obviousl y prevents us from characterizing the nature of the crust at Ridge  C based on in situ drilling data. Combining seismic interpretation an d the observations from Ridge B (Site U1500), however, constrain s this to be primarily if not entirely of igneous origin.  

2. To determine the time lag between plate rupture and asthenospheric upwelling that allowed decompression melting to generate igneous oceanic crust.  

This objective was achieved. The simple answer to Objective 2 i s that there was no substantial time lag between (final) plate ruptur e and asthenospheric upwelling supporting the generation of igneou s material with a basaltic, MORB-type composition. Submarin e MORB-type basalts of early Oligocene age were recovered at Sit e U1500 on Ridge B, and based on geophysical evidence, Ridge C ca n be interpreted to be at least partly igneous. Seafloor magneti c anomalies C10r to C11n $29{-}30\,\mathrm{Ma};$ ; approximately mid-Oligocene ) encompass these two ridges and provide independent evidence o f the age of the basalts from Site U1500 (Oligocene). Submarine basalts of similar or possibly slightly older age (early Oligocene to lat e Eocene) were found on Ridge A (Site U1502). These observation s rule out any significant time-lag between final plate rupture and th e onset of magmatism. Postexpedition work on mantle melting history may detail the thickness of residual subcontinental lithospher e of lithospheric thinning during breakup. Excellent material for thi s type of work, and for age determination, is available from Sit e U1500, but modeling efforts will lack the constraints from Ridge  C (Site U1503) representing a more advanced stage of spreading. Because of the highly altered nature of Site U1502 basalts, geochemical studies will unfortunately be challenging but very importan t because these rocks likely represent a stage in margin developmen t where continental lithosphere had a stronger impact on magmatis m (contamination and by lithospheric thickness). Expedition 367/36 8 findings also rule out that the margin in this location was overprinted by late-stage magmatism as recently proposed.  

Although the failure to pursue Site U1503 did not seriously affect our ability to constrain a possible time lag between plate rupture and onset of magmatism, it left us without a well-define d reference frame for assessing mantle composition and mantle melting conditions during steady-state accretion of igneous crust. Reoccupation of Site U1503 is therefore highly recommended to provid e a benchmark against which the earlier breakup magmatism can b e compared. Similarly, more and fresh basaltic material from Ridge  A would greatly benefit the study of the SCS margin in terms of ag e determination of the earliest basaltic magmatism and its detaile d geochemical elemental and isotopic composition evolution ove r time.  

# 3. To constrain the rate of extension and vertical crustal movements.  

This objective was partly achieved, but postexpedition work i s needed to further develop our findings. Important stratigraphi c control on the synrift sediments related to breakup was achieved a t Sites U1499, U1501, U1502, and U1505. The findings of highly syntectonic deposits of Oligocene (and possibly older) age overlain by  a very low sedimentation rate sequence of late Oligocene to earl y Miocene age at Ridge A (Site U1499) is strong evidence for an earl y Oligocene plate rupture that was completed by the latest Oligocene. This was further confirmed at Site U1501, located on the OMH. This site recovered the entire sequence of synrift sediments down t o (presumed) Mesozoic basement. The sequence shows developmen t from deltaic to shallow marine with terrigenous sedimentation (Eocene) through deepening water, yet still predominantly clastic detrital  sediments  (approximately  early  Oligocene),  to  deep-water marine calcareous sediments (approximately late Oligocene to Miocene). Biostratigraphic constraints on the Eocene deposits are lacking below the uppermost late Eocene sediments. A very simila r evolution was documented at Site U1505 for the early Oligocene t o Miocene interval. Site U1504, also at the OMH and slightly shallower than at Sites U1501 and U1505, penetrated a $120\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thic k postrift sedimentary sequence above crystalline basement. Deepwater conditions were established by lowermost early Miocen e time. The presence of a carbonate reef debris deposit (very shallo w marine water) with an approximate age of late Eocene suggests tha t the $\sim\!3\;\mathrm{km}$ subsidence experienced by these sediments was initiate d post-late Eocene. Site U1502, also located on Ridge A, shows (minor) deep-water deposits of early Oligocene to perhaps late Eocen e age followed exclusively by deep-water deposits of Oligocene t o Miocene age. Deep-water conditions therefore developed earlie r (pre-Oligocene) on Ridge A than on the OMH (approximately lat e Oligocene).  

The inability to pursue coring at Site U1503 unfortunately prevented Expedition 368 from extending subsidence studies seawar d of Ridge B (Site U1500), where the late Oligocene sediment packag e overlying the basalts is much better developed than at Site U150 0 on Ridge B. However, the most serious lack of data needed for constraining rate of extension is the lack of biostratigraphic control in the deeper part of the Eocene section at Site U1501 and the olde r part of synrift or prerift deposits at Site U1499. Shallow water sediments of Eocene age similar to those at Site U1501 were found a t Site U1435 (IODP Expedition 349), and, although the sediment i s similarly barren of microfossils, detrital zircon is present. If als o present in the Site U1501 samples, age determination on a population of these might provide maximum ages. The amount of crusta l extension will be determined through a detailed tectonic interpretation of the regional seismic data (courtesy of the CNOOC) that th e entire Expedition 367/368 program is based on.  

4. To improve the understanding of the Cenozoic regional tectonic and environmental development of the Southeast Asia margin and SCS by combining Expedition 367/368 results with existing ODP/IODP sediment records and regional seismic data.  

This objective was achieved, but intensive multidisciplinar y postexpedition work is needed to maximize our findings. An important achievement in this regard was the recovery of a nearly continuous sequence of the prerift, synrift, and postrift sediments sinc e the Eocene and older sediments at Site U1501. This sequence provides the sedimentary records of the SCS evolving from land t o deep sea for the first time and will greatly help us to understand th e sedimentary processes associated with tectonic events and paleoenvironmental development at the SCS northern margin. Togethe r with the deep-water sediment packages from Sites U1499, U1500, U1502, and U1505, Expedition 367/368 findings provide the possible tectonic links between the SCS and the western Pacific in th e aspects of the SCS formation history.  

Based on the coring/drilling results of Expedition 367/368, ne w time-depth constraints on some of the major seismic stratigraphi c unconformities are available. These unconformities were mappe d regionally throughout the basin by integrating microfossil ages, petrophysics, and borehole logging data with the existing seismic reflection  data.  Among  these  seismic  unconformities,  the  T6 0 unconformity is the most prominent. It is easily recognized basinwide and is present at Sites U1500, U1501, U1502, U1503 (not sampled), and U1505. Though not resolved by seismic data, its stratigraphic position is also present at Site U1499 in an extremel y condensed section. Exploring its nature (e.g., timing and duration, processes, and mechanisms) is very important for understandin g the regional geological evolution, but this objective will need further postexpedition work.  

The postrift sediments cored during Expedition 367/368 wil l contribute to our understanding of the late Cenozoic tectonic an d environmental history of the SCS. An early to middle Miocene succession of red claystone was found at Sites U1499, U1500, an d U1502, all located deeper than 3500 mbsl. The red claystone deposits near the acoustic basement (e.g., basalt or altered basalt o r gravel) extending over all of these sites indicates that the SCS basi n was deep and the sedimentation rate was extremely low at that time. These conditions may correlate with a basin-wide event related t o deep circulation of oxygenated water from the western Pacific prio r to the closure of the Luzon Strait.  

A late Miocene succession of hemipelagic and turbidite deposit s was observed at deeper Sites U1499, U1500, and U1502 and likel y recorded the processes that delivered sediment from the shallo w shelf or slope of the northern SCS to the deeper parts of the basin.  A high sedimentation rate at the deep-water sites during the late Miocene and a nearly $10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ hiatus from the middle Miocene to Pleistocene observed at Site U1504 on the OMH indicate strong erosio n from source areas in the upper slope and shelf region and efficien t transport into the deep basin during late Miocene time.  

In addition to the Oligocene to Plio–Pleistocene APC/XCB record $\mathbf{\omega}^{\sim100}$ percent) at Site U1505, the Plio–Pleistocene sequenc e was recovered by double APC, high-recovery holes at Site U1505 t o establish a complete record for high-resolution paleoceanographi c and paleoclimatic studies. The hemipelagic deposits, rich in calcareous microfossils, at this site above the modern CCD of the SC S should enable us to reconstruct the east Asian monsoonal climat e and paleoceanographic changes in the SCS at orbital and millennial timescales.  

Postexpedition research using samples from Expedition 367/36 8 together with seismic stratigraphic correlations will continue to improve the contributions to Objective 4. This research should b e channeled into four general avenues:  

1. To reconstruct the early stage history of the SCS, including paleoenvironmental changes from land to deep sea and new data (e.g., detrital zircon geochronology) to constrain the sedimentary provenance,   
2. To explore the paleoceanographic conditions favorable for early to middle Miocene pelagic red clay and late Miocene turbidite deposition through geochemical and geophysical techniques,   
3. To correlate the chronostratigraphic records between all ODP (Leg 184) and IODP drill sites from Expedition 349 and Expedition 367/368 sites in the SCS, and   
4. To conduct high-resolution paleoceanographic study of Pliocene- and Pleistocene-related monsoonal climate changes and deep-water exchange between the SCS and the Pacific.  

# Integration of drilling results with seismic data  

The large regional set of high-quality seismic data provided b y the CNOOC formed an essential basis for the planning, scheduling, and implementation of Expedition 367/368. The continued availability of these data to the scientific party will be pivotal for postexpedition research on most of the scientific objectives discusse d above.
