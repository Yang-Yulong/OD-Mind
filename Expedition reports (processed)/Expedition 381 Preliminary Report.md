# Abstract  

The primary objective of International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 381 was to retrieve a record of early continenta l rifting and basin evolution from the Corinth rift, central Greece. Continental rifting is fundamental for the formation of ocean basins, and active rift zones are dynamic regions of high geohazar d potential. However, the detailed spatial and temporal evolution of  a complete rift system needed to understand rift development fro m the fault to plate scale is poorly resolved. In the active Corinth rift, deformation rates are high, the recent synrift succession is preserved and complete offshore, earlier rift phases are preserved onshore, and a dense seismic database provides high-resolutio n imaging of the fault network and of seismic stratigraphy around th e basin. As the basin has subsided, its depositional environment ha s been affected by fluctuating global sea level and its absolute position relative to sea level, and the basin sediments record this changing environment through time. In Corinth, we can therefore achiev e an unprecedented precision of timing and spatial complexity of riftfault system development, rift-controlled drainage system evolution, and basin fill in the first few million years of rift history. Th e following are the expedition themes:  

• High-resolution fault slip and rift evolution history,   
• Surface processes in active rifts,   
• High-resolution late Quaternary Eastern Mediterranean paleoclimate and paleoenvironment of a developing rift basin, and   
• Geohazard assessment in an active rift.  

These objectives were and will be accomplished as a result o f successful drilling, coring, and logging at three sites in the Gulf o f Corinth, which collectively yielded $1645\;\mathrm{m}$ of recovered core over  a $1905~\mathrm{m}$ cored interval. Cores recovered at these sites together provide (1) a longer rift history (Sites M0078 and M0080), (2) a highresolution record of the most recent phase of rifting (Site M0079), and (3) the spatial variation of rift evolution (comparison of sites i n the central and eastern rift). The sediments contain a rich and complex record of changing sedimentation, sediment and pore wate r geochemistry,  and  environmental  conditions  from  micropaleontological assemblages. The preliminary chronology developed by shipboard analyses will be refined and improved durin g postexpedition research, providing a high-resolution chronostratigraphy down to the orbital timescale for a range of tectonic, sedimentological, and paleoenvironmental studies. This chronology wil l provide absolute timing of key rift events, rates of fault movement, rift extension and subsidence, and the spatial variations of these parameters. The core data will also allow us to investigate the relativ e roles of and feedbacks between tectonics, climate, and eustasy i n sediment flux and basin evolution. Finally, the Corinth rift boreholes will provide the first long Quaternary record of Mediterranean-type climate in the region. The potential range of scientifi c applications for this unique data set is very large, encompassing tectonics, sedimentary processes, paleoenvironment, paleoclimate, paleoecology, geochemistry, and geohazards.  

# Introduction  

How rifting initiates and evolves to continental breakup an d ocean basin formation is a major unanswered solid earth/plate tectonic question; continental rifting is the first stage of this process.  

Numerical models indicate that strain rate is a key parameter controlling the style and magnitude of extension, but spatial and temporal patterns in strain rate are very poorly known for mos t extensional systems due to scarce chronological constraints, othe r than over short (earthquake-cycle) timescales. Key questions include the following: What controls rift geometry and evolution ? How does activity on faults change with time? What does rift evolution and fault activity tell us about crustal rheology? What are th e implications of changing fault activity for earthquake activity in  a developing rift fault system? Over the last ${\sim}15$ years, important insights have been derived from numerical models (e.g., Burov an d Poliakov, 2001; Lavier and Buck, 2002; Lavier and Manatschal, 2006; Huismans and Beaumont, 2007, 2011; Olive et al., 2014) and fro m observations at mature, magma-poor passive margins where activity has ceased (e.g., Manatschal et al., 2001; Whitmarsh et al., 2001; Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008; Van Avendonk et al., 2009; Bayrakc i et al., 2016). However, early synrift stratigraphy is often difficult t o image and sample due to deep burial and tectonic overprinting, making it difficult to examine the earliest stages of rifting.  

Instead,  this  project  studies  the  young,  seismically  activ e Corinth rift with a unique existing data set to resolve at high temporal and spatial resolution how rift faults initiate and link and ho w strain is distributed over time. The rift is currently a closed, smallscale clastic sedimentary system, and the last $\mathord{\sim}1\mathrm{-}2$ My of the synrif t stratigraphic record is preserved offshore, with earlier rift sediments preserved onshore, providing a clear spatial and temporal record of fault and rift activity. The Corinth rift is also an ideal targe t for studying rift processes because it is opening orthogonally (perpendicular to the rift axis) at high strain rates (e.g., Briole et al., 2000), extension is focused with well-constrained initial conditions, it lacks volcanism, and there is almost no tectonic overprinting. Thus, the number of variables contributing to rift development ar e reduced, and a study here will complement research in other activ e rift systems that are more mature, oblique, and/or characterized b y significant magmatism (e.g., East Africa and the Gulf of California).  

Constraining the contributions of tectonics and climate to landscape evolution and sediment delivery in active basins and ho w surficial processes influence rifting remains another major challenge in Earth science. Uplift and subsidence associated with rif t faults can strongly modify landscapes, creating and destroying sediment delivery pathways into rift basins (e.g., Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000), but a detailed record of a complete sedimentary system in  a young, active rift is lacking. For example, how do strain rate an d strain distribution control landscape development and sedimen t flux into rifts? Climate is clearly another dominant control on sediment flux. Isolated and semi-isolated basins formed by rifting ar e particularly sensitive to climate and global climate-driven sea level change (e.g., Collier et al., 2000; Scholz et al., 2007; McHugh et al., 2008); thus, active rift basins are ideal targets both for assessing ho w changing climate impacts sedimentation and for examining change s in paleoenvironment as basins become isolated and then reconnected to the global oceans. Where strain rates are high, such as a t the Corinth rift, high basin sediment accumulation rates provide  a very high resolution record of regional climate, basin paleoenvironment, and change in sediment source and flux into the basi n through time. Recent models predict that surface processes will als o strongly influence rift development by modifying the thermal structure (Bialas and Buck, 2009) and by redistributing mass throug h erosion and deposition (Olive et al., 2014), all of which can influenc e fault evolution and strain localization. Addressing all of these questions, determining driving mechanisms, and resolving the interpla y between processes requires a detailed record of climate, tectonics, and sedimentation in a young rift basin. The Corinth rift is an excellent location to tackle these questions. Glacial–interglacial cycle s are characterized by changes in climate, sea level, and vegetation, including in this region (e.g., Tzedakis et al., 2009; Sadori et al., 2016), allowing us to examine the impact of both climatic chang e and tectonics on surface processes. Sedimentation rates are high, and the geology around the Corinth rift is well studied, enabling  a comprehensive study of the complete synrift sedimentary system.  

During International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 381 we drilled, sampled, and logged a significant part of th e synrift sequence of the Corinth rift to constrain in space and tim e the deformation rate, absolute timing of rifting processes, subsidence and sediment flux, changing paleoenvironment and depositional conditions, and the interaction of rift development an d climate on surface processes and sediment flux.  

# Background  

# The Corinth rift  

The Corinth rift (Figure F1) is one of Europe’s most seismicall y active areas. The Aegean Sea represents a natural laboratory for th e study of rapid continental extensional tectonics, with extension beginning in the Oligocene–Miocene (e.g., McKenzie, 1978; Le Picho n and Angelier, 1981; Jolivet et al., 1994; Armijo et al., 1996; Jolivet, 2001). In the late Pliocene–early Pleistocene, deformation becam e strongly localized across a few zones, and the Corinth rift was th e most prominent. The active rift is a ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{km}\times30{-}40\ \mathrm{km}$ band experiencing north–south extension, and the entire rift system i s ${\sim}70{-}80~\mathrm{km}$ wide. Current extension rates reach $10{-}15\ \mathrm{mm/y}$ (e.g., Clarke et al., 1998; Briole et al., 2000; Bernard et al., 2006), some o f the highest in the world, giving strain rates of ${\sim}5\,\times\,10^{-7}/\mathrm{y}.$ Debat e continues on the origin of extension in the broader Aegean and focusing of strain at the Corinth rift, with models typically combinin g gravitational collapse of thickened crust, subduction-driven rollback and back-arc extension, westward expulsion of Anatolia, an d propagation of the North Anatolian fault (e.g., Armijo et al., 1996; Jolivet et al.,  2010).  Regional lithospheric structure, includin g crustal thickness and structure of the underlying subducting African plate, is constrained by wide-angle seismic and teleseismic tomographic techniques and gravity data (e.g., Tiberi et al., 2000; Sachpazi et al., 2007; Zelt et al., 2005); thicker crust $({\sim}40{-}45\ \mathrm{km})$ runs northwest–southeast along the orogenic Hellenide/Pindo s mountain belt in the western rift.  

# Rift evolution and stratigraphy  

Corinth rifting began at ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ with three main phases identified by integration of onshore depositional records and offshor e seismic stratigraphy (Figure F2) (e.g., Higgs, 1988; Armijo et al., 1996; Sachpazi et al., 2003; Ford et al., 2007; Bell et al., 2009; Taylo r et al., 2011; Nixon et al., 2016; Gawthorpe et al., 2017). Initial Pliocene basinal deposition (from onshore preserved sediments) wa s continental, varying from alluvial fans in the west to lakes in the eas t (“Lower Group”) (Ford et al., 2007, 2013; Rohais et al., 2007; Hemelsdaël et al., 2017). Increased subsidence rates, depocente r deepening, and fault linkage followed, with large marginal fan delta s (locally ${>}800\ \mathrm{m}$ thick) now uplifted and exposed onshore (“Middl e Group”; Backert et al., 2010). The timing of the depocenter deepening and transition from the Lower Group to Middle Group ma y have occurred at different times along the rift (e.g., ${\sim}2.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in th e Alkyonides Gulf [eastern rift], ${\sim}3.0$ Ma in the central rift [Leeder e t al., 2008, 2012], and ${\sim}1.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in the western rift [Ford et al., 2013]). This transition is thought to represent increased subsidence an d sediment supply into the rift at the location of the modern Gulf o f Corinth (Middle Group onshore; proposed correlation with th e lower synrift unit [seismic Unit 1] offshore). During this phase, th e rift was controlled by both south- and north-dipping boundin g faults (Bell et al., 2009; Ford et al., 2013, 2016; Nixon et al., 2016).  

At ${\sim}0.6$ Ma (hypothesized age prior to drilling), fault activit y stepped northward and the rift narrowed, establishing the moder n rift asymmetry with southern boundary north-dipping faults dominating subsidence and with new fan deltas developing along th e southern gulf margin (“Upper Group” onshore; upper synrift uni t [seismic Unit 2] offshore). These southern boundary faults apparently grew and linked rapidly (Nixon et al., 2016). During this time, the rift environment was hypothesized to alternate between isolated/semi-isolated and marine between glacial and interglacial periods, respectively, as eustatic sea level fluctuated relative to th e boundaries of the basin (west: Rion sill; east: Isthmus of Corinth). The exact onset of regular marine deposition is not known but i s hypothesized to correlate with the distinct seismic stratigraphy o f the offshore upper synrift unit, seismic Unit 2 (Bell et al., 2009; Nixon et al., 2016). However, earlier limited marine incursions hav e been described (e.g., Bentham et al., 1991; Ford et al., 2007, 2013).  

The rift appears to have narrowed as it evolved (strain localization) but also migrated northward. Geodetic and microseismicit y data indicate the highest modern strain rates in the western rif t (e.g., Avallone et al., 2004; Bernard et al., 2006). However, long-ter m extensional strain (geological timescales) is greatest in the central rift (e.g., Bell et al., 2009, 2011). The extension rate may have increased at specific times over rift history (Ford et al., 2013, 2016), suggesting a deviation from models with relatively constant ne t strain and increasing, gradual localization (McLeod et al., 2000; Sharp et al., 2000; Gawthorpe et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2004).  

# Offshore rift architecture and synrift stratigraphy  

Patterns of extension in the offshore rift change along axis an d with time, with changing polarity and symmetry of fault networks, single versus multiple active faults, and complex and changin g depocenter geometry offshore (Figures F1, F3). Clear, traceable uni t boundaries (possible unconformities or sequence boundaries) mar k major changes in rift development, but their age is unknown.  

The synrift succession offshore is locally as thick as ${\sim}2.5\,\mathrm{km}$ an d divided into two seismic stratigraphic units separated by a locall y angular unit boundary or unconformity (U): the older, lower amplitude seismic Unit 1 and the younger, well-stratified, and higher amplitude seismic Unit 2 (e.g., Figures F4, F5, F6, F7). Seismic Unit  1 includes two different seismic facies that may or may not be stratigraphically distinct: a nonstratified (limited clear reflections) subunit (1a) mainly found on the southern basin margin and a mor e widespread, stratified (although weakly in places) subunit (1b) (se e Nixon et al., 2016). Seismic Unit 2 has been interpreted to recor d glacial–interglacial cycles on the basis of marine and lacustrine conditions detected in short cores (Sachpazi et al., 2003; Moretti et al., 2004), clinoform sequences on some basin margins (e.g., Leeder e t al., 2005; McNeill et al., 2005; Lykousis et al., 2007; Bell et al., 2008), and alternating low-amplitude/high-amplitude seismic sequence s interpreted as lowstand lacustrine/highstand marine sequences, respectively (e.g., Sachpazi et al., 2003; Lykousis et al., 2007; Bell et al., 2008, 2009; Taylor et al., 2011) (e.g., Figure F5). The integrated sequence stratigraphic interpretations suggest the base of seismi c Unit 1 is ${\sim}0.6\,M\mathbf{a}$ (Nixon et al., 2016). The onshore Middle Group i s thought to be time-equivalent to seismic Unit 1 offshore, with th e onshore Upper Group equivalent to seismic Unit 2 offshore. Th e onshore Lower Group is likely of minimal thickness offshore, i f present at all, being north of the primary locus of rifting at tha t time. However, earlier rift phases (such as those in the Megara basi n in the eastern rift; e.g., Bentham et al., 1991) may have extended int o the present-day offshore rift area in the Alkyonides Gulf, at the eastern end of the rift (Figure F1).  

Depth to basement maps (Bell et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2011 ) show a single depocenter below the current central gulf, with reduced subsidence in the eastern (Alkyonides Gulf) and western rift. Isochore maps of the synrift sediments (Figure F3; Bell et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2011; Nixon et al., 2016) indicate that before the ${\sim}0.6$ Ma unit boundary/unconformity separating seismic Units 1 and 2, two primarily symmetric depocenters existed, but since ${\sim}0.6$ Ma, these have linked into a single depocenter, coincident with transfe r of strain from south- to north-dipping faults (increased asymmetry). Specifically, a change in rift polarity and symmetry followed b y depocenter linkage occurred. The switch to dominant north-dipping faults appears to be broadly synchronous along the entire rift. Since ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{ka}$ , these north-dipping faults appear to have evolved b y linkage of smaller fault segments into longer fault segments an d have increased in displacement and activity with equivalent change s to the associated depocenters. The timing and rate of switch in rif t polarity/symmetry and of fault and depocenter linkage could onl y be constrained by drilling that can provide chronostratigraphy combined with the existing dense seismic network.  

# Changing paleoenvironment in the Corinth area  

Minimal information is available on the impact of climate variations and resulting sea level changes on sedimentation and paleoenvironment in the Corinth rift. Existing constraints come fro m onshore studies (e.g., Andrews et al., 2007), piston cores as long a s $30\;\mathrm{m}$ (e.g., Moretti et al., 2004) and geophysical imaging (e.g., Perissoratis et al., 2000; Bell et al., 2009). Late Quaternary interglacials i n southeastern Europe are characterized by Mediterranean, subMediterranean, and temperate forests, whereas glacial cycles ar e characterized by open woodland and steppes (e.g., Tzedakis et al., 2009; Sadori et al., 2016). Systematic fluctuations in marine microfossil assemblages and in the isotopic composition of their shells depict long- and short-term climatic changes in the region. I n addition, these fluctuations provide valuable information regardin g the impact of both African monsoon variability and higher latitud e climate processes on the climatic and oceanographic evolution o f the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (e.g., Rohling et al., 2015). Glacial– interglacial cycles appear to be associated with changes in sedimentary processes and environment in the Corinth basin (e.g., Perissoratis et al., 2000); for example, long piston cores that sample the mos t recent transition reveal changes in sediment facies and micropaleontological assemblages (Moretti et al., 2004). The collection o f cores and data from drilling will provide unique constraints for examining the impact of both climatic change and tectonics on sedimentation  and  paleoenvironment  in  the  gulf  and  improvin g understanding of regional climate in the Quaternary.  

# Objectives  

# Primary objectives  

1. Fault and rift structural evolution in an active continental rift: to establish the distribution of tectonic strain in time and space and the timescales of fault evolution in a young rift at high resolution (20–50 ky and one to tens of kilometers).  

We will determine the growth and development of a rift-scal e normal fault network, timescales of segmentation establishment, basin evolution in terms of strain localization, rift propagation an d migration, and the impact of crustal structure and composition o n strain rate and distribution. What are the controlling parameters o n strain localization? How and when does a “mature” fault networ k emerge? How does fault evolution impact subsidence patterns an d depocenter development?  

2. Surface processes in active rifts: to determine the evolution of a rift-controlled, closed drainage system in time and space at high temporal resolution $(20{-}50\,k y)$ and the relative impact of tectonics and climate on sediment flux.  

What are the relative contributions of millennial to orbital periodicity Quaternary climate fluctuations (global and regional) an d fault activity/rift evolution in controlling the supply of sedimen t into a rift basin? We will assess changes in sediment flux at a rang e of timescales and analyze the paleoenvironment of the rift basi n through time. These results will be used to evaluate the response o f sediment supply to fault birth, death and migration, rift flank uplift, and changes in strain rate and to better understand feedbacks between climate, sea level fluctuations, erosion, sediment transport, and deposition and tectonic processes.  

# Secondary objectives  

3. To resolve reliable active fault slip rates to improve regional assessment of hazards due to earthquakes and secondary tsunami and landslides.  

The Gulf of Corinth has high levels of seismicity and damagin g historic secondary hazards such as slope failure and tsunami in  a region of high coastal population density and tourism. Fault sli p rates currently rely on paleoseismological and tectonic geomorphological studies with dated materials of very recent fault slip (the las t ${\sim}200~\mathrm{ky}$ or less) and estimated horizon ages for longer timescales. These slip rate estimates include significant uncertainties, and sli p rates remain unquantified on many faults. Ocean drilling allows u s to determine fault slip rates on timescales of $10{-}100\,\mathrm{ky}$ to 1 My. W e will integrate fault slip rates with shorter timescale data (paleoseismological, geodetic, and seismicity) to more fully understand th e seismic hazard potential of individual faults. Cores may also allo w us to assess the frequency of major slope failures (integrated wit h seismically identified mass transport deposits offshore), an indication of secondary hazards and of possible seismicity.  

4. To generate a new high-resolution record of the Quaternary paleoclimate of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea with respect to global climate and the paleoenvironment of the Corinth basin as a semi-isolated marine-lacustrine basin controlled by changing base level and climate.  

Details of the Corinth basin’s changing environment from glacial to interglacial times are poorly known, and the precise timin g and nature of transitions between isolated and marine conditions i s unconfirmed, as is the relationship to the interacting controls of basin subsidence, sill elevation, and eustatic sea level. Offshore drillin g of synrift sediments provides a record of regional Quaternary paleoclimate and basin paleoenvironment by sampling and analyzing pollen, micro- and macrofossils, stable isotopes, and sediment physica l and chemical properties. Long cores from the Gulf of Corinth wil l also provide the opportunity to generate (1) the first high-resolutio n relative paleointensity (RPI) record in the Mediterranean Sea correlated with global RPI stacks (e.g., Valet et al., 2005; Channell et al., 2009) and the pattern of the magnetic excursions (Stott et al., 2002; Lund et al., 2005; Channell et al., 2008) to help understand the dynamics of the geomagnetic field and (2) a linked terrestrial polle n and marine $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ record in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (at leas t for interglacial intervals) to establish a record of paleoenvironmen t and vegetation and to help constrain age models for existing Easter n Mediterranean long pollen records.  

# Operational strategy  

Based on seismic and bathymetric data acquired in the Gulf o f Corinth prior to the expedition, three primary and three alternat e drill sites were proposed to satisfy the objectives of the proposal. The three primary (and ultimately drilled) sites (Figure F1) were selected based on the likelihood of recovering key stratigraphic unit s to achieve the expedition scientific objectives, the ability to correlate with horizons in the seismic reflection data network, and, i n combination, to resolve both temporal and spatial rift evolutionar y history.  

Site M0078 (proposed Site COR-02A) is located in the centra l basin on a horst block where there is therefore a relatively condensed section. This site allows recovery of a long synrift record, including a significant part of seismic Unit 1 below, a near-complet e seismic Unit 2 above, and the regional unit boundary or unconformity between them (Figures F4, F5). Site M0079 (proposed Sit e COR-01A) allows sampling of a complete seismic Unit 2 at ver y high resolution (Figures F4, F6). Site M0080 (proposed Site COR04B) was selected because the uppermost basement and early seismic Unit 1 sediments can be sampled at this location due to the relatively thin seismic Unit 2 section (Figures F4, F7). The location o f Site M0080 in the eastern part of the rift (Alkyonides Gulf; Figur e F1) also provides an opportunity to test along-axis variation in rif t processes.  

All holes were sited in a $20\textrm{m}$ radius of the proposed drillin g sites approved by the IODP Environmental Protection and Safet y Panel (EPSP), with Holes M0078A, M0079A, and M0080A all situated within $5\;\mathrm{m}$ of the specified coordinates. The general location s of the sites drilled are shown in Figure F1. As with all Mission Specific Platform expeditions, no cores were split during the offshor e phase; therefore, a comprehensive onshore phase complemente d the offshore phase. Table T1 summarizes the descriptions and measurements made during Expedition 381 and indicates whether the y were conducted offshore or onshore.  

# Offshore operations  

Mobilization of the vessel began on 3 October 2017 in Falmouth, UK, with the D/V Fugro Synergy sailing for the Port of Valletta, Malta, on 7 October. On 16 October, the vessel arrived at th e  

Port of Valletta, and European Consortium for Ocean Researc h Drilling (ECORD) Science Operator (ESO) personnel joined th e vessel to continue the mobilization of science facilities before arrival in Greece. Following refueling, the Fugro Synergy continued th e transit to the Port of Corinth, Greece, and was alongside on 19 October.  

The offshore phase took place from 19 October to 18 December . The vessel sailed from Corinth on 22 October and returned to por t on 18 December. Demobilization also took place at the Port o f Corinth, where the ESO refrigerated (reefer) containers, containerized laboratories, multisensor core logger (MSCL) laboratory container, and offices were offloaded from the vessel in preparation fo r road transport to the Center for Marine Environmental Science s (MARUM), University of Bremen (Germany), and transfer t o Pireás, Greece, for shipping by sea to the British Geological Surve y (UK). The University of Montpellier logging container was transported by sea to Falmouth (UK) and then over land to Montpellier. ESO staff departed by 19 December following completion of demobilization.  

The cores, core catcher samples, headspace gas samples, and interstitial water splits collected offshore were transported under refrigeration to the IODP Bremen Core Repository at MARU M (University of Bremen, Germany).  

In total, 52.5 days of Expedition 381 were spent operational o n station, 0.5 days were spent in transit between sites, 0.8 days wer e spent in port during the expedition, 0.2 days were spent on standb y at station because of weather, and 2.3 days were spent on equipment-related downtime. See Table T2 for a summary of offshor e operations and recovery. Shipboard-generated recovery plots ar e available in the weekly ship reports on the ECORD Expedition 38 1 website (http://www.ecord.org/expedition381/reports).  

The following coring and downhole logging tools were availabl e during Expedition 381:  

• Fugro Wison Extended Piston (WEP) system (designated $^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^{\prime\prime}$ ),   
• Fugro Corer system in push mode (designated “P”) and percussive mode (designated “V”),   
• Fugro Extended Marine Core Barrel (FXMCB) system (rotary; designated “R”),   
• DOSECC Exploration Services suite of coring tools as a backup, and   
• A suite of standalone and stackable slimline wireline logging tools (from the University of Montpelier and operated by the European Petrophysics Consortium).  

# Onshore Science Party  

Thermal conductivity measurements were carried out on al l cores before the start of the Onshore Science Party (OSP).  

During the Expedition 381 OSP from 31 January to 28 Februar y 2018, the cores were described in detail and IODP standard sampling and measurements and postexpedition scientific researc h sampling were undertaken (Table T1). Analytical laboratories an d equipment were used at MARUM (nondestructive core logging, marine geotechnics, inorganic geochemistry, and microscopes) an d the Department of Geosciences at the University of Bremen (paleomagnetism and hydrofluoric acid laboratories and the carbon/sulfur analysis system).  

# Principal results  

Operational site summaries  

# Site M0078  

Site M0078 is located in the central Gulf of Corinth (Figure F1 ) on a fault-bounded horst block (Figure F5) with the aim of recovering a long, condensed record of synrift sedimentation. Two hole s (M0078A and M0078B) were drilled at water depths of $\mathord{\sim}860$ meter s below sea level (mbsl). Hole M0078A was drilled and cored t o 610.43 meters below seafloor (mbsf) using the Fugro WEP syste m (piston), the Fugro Corer in push and percussive modes, and th e FXMCB (rotary corer). Core recovery was $87\%$ . Downhole loggin g was attempted in Hole M0078A but successful data collection wa s not possible. Hole M0078B was drilled and cored to 55.85 mbsf using the Fugro Corer in push mode to capture material not recovere d in Hole M0078A. Core recovery was $93\%$ . Downhole logging wa s not conducted in Hole M0078B because it was a relatively shallo w hole.  

# Site M0079  

Site M0079 is located in the central Gulf of Corinth (Figure F1 ) with the aim of drilling a complete and expanded stratigraphic section of the most recent rift phase and the uppermost section of sediments from the penultimate phase to provide a high-resolutio n temporal record (Figure F6). Hole M0079A (water depth of 85 7 mbsl) was drilled and cored to 704.9 mbsf using the Fugro Corer i n push and percussive modes and the FXMCB. Core recovery wa s $87\%$ . Downhole logging was conducted with a limited suite of logging tools, primarily in the upper 295 mbsf.  

# Site M0080  

Site M0080 is located in the Alkyonides Gulf (Figure F1) in th e eastern part of the Corinth rift with the aim of testing spatial variation in rift evolution history and to sample earlier phases of rifting. Hole M0080A (water depth of $349~\mathrm{mbsl}_{\cdot}$ ) was drilled and cored t o 534.1 mbsf using the Fugro Corer in push and percussive modes an d the FXMCB. Core recovery was $84\%$ . Downhole logging was conducted with a full suite of standard logging tools, with most dept h intervals covered.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The drilled sequences of Expedition 381 comprise an upper uni t that records the most recent phase of synrift deformation and deposition (equivalent to seismic Unit 2), a lithostratigraphic uni t boundary (of possible unconformable nature in places), and an underlying unit or units (equivalent to seismic Unit 1) that records earlier rift history and represents a variable time period of deposition. The lithostratigraphic units for all sites were defined based on lithologic, micropaleontological, and select physical properties. To characterize the lithostratigraphy, a series of facies associations (FAs ) were defined based on physical and biogenic features of the sediment, including bedding and lamination style, grain size, color, an d body and trace fossils. The facies associations are defined in Tabl e T3.  

# Site M0078  

The lithostratigraphy of Site M0078 is divided into two unit s with a boundary at 385.14 mbsf. Unit 1 is divided into 16 subunit s (Figure F8) that correlate well with micropaleontological data, which define marine and isolated/semi-isolated intervals that appear to be primarily controlled by changing eustatic sea level wit h respect to sills at the entrance to the Corinth basin.  

Unit 1 sediments are dominated by detrital clay- and silt-grad e carbonate. Background sedimentation consists of hemipelagic an d turbiditic muds with occasional thin, coarser (fine silt to mediu m sand) beds and turbidite–homogeneous mud couplets. Bioturbatio n is primarily present in the marine subunits. Calcite is most abundant, with common to abundant quartz, feldspars, and micas. Biogenic material is common (in particular in the marine subunits), a s are organic components and framboidal pyrite. Well-sorted, siltsized aragonite needles are dominant in some laminated intervals. Marine subunits in Unit 1 (odd numbers) are dominated by homogeneous to poorly bedded, often greenish gray mud (FA1 and FA6; see Table T3) with some laminated muds (e.g., FA3) and sparse thi n silty and sandy beds. Isolated/semi-isolated subunits (even numbers) include laminated muds, thin mud beds, greenish gray mu d with homogeneous thick mud beds, and dark gray to black organicrich beds (FA4, FA3, and FA5) with sparse thin silty and sandy beds. Submillimeter- to millimeter-scale laminations, commonly gray t o white, also occur in these isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Throughout Unit 1, interbedded mud–silt and centimeter-thick sand bed s are present, but overall sand is minor and decreases with depth (Figure F8).  

Unit 2 has a composition similar to that of Unit 1, with wellsorted, very fine silt sized detrital calcite dominant. Unit 2 is composed almost entirely of light gray or buff weakly laminated to homogeneous highly bioturbated mud (FA12; Figure F8). Mino r darker gray mud with faint bedding and black laminations associated with organic matter also occurs. The Unit 1/2 boundary i s sharp and marked by an abrupt change from laminated greenis h gray muds to homogeneous light gray muds downhole.  

# Site M0079  

The lithostratigraphy of Site M0079 is divided into two unit s with a boundary at 677.23 mbsf (Figure F9). Unit 1 is divided into 1 6 subunits that correlate well with micropaleontological data, whic h define marine and isolated/semi-isolated intervals. Unit 1 sediments, as at Site M0078, are dominantly fine grained and carbonat e rich. Detrital calcite predominates, with subordinate quartz, feldspar, and phyllosilicates. Biogenic material is common, particularl y in the marine subunits. Depositional processes were dominated b y fine-grained turbiditic and hemipelagic deposition. Marine subunits in Unit 1 (odd numbers) are moderately to highly bioturbate d and dominated by homogeneous to poorly bedded greenish gra y muds (FA1 and FA6; see Table T3). Isolated/semi-isolated subunit s (even numbers) are dominated by laminated to thinly bedded gra y and greenish gray muds, some with black, organic-rich lamination s and beds (FA2, FA4, and FA5) with no or sparse bioturbation. Higher energy depositional processes are indicated by intervals o f soft-sediment  deformation  and  mud-supported  conglomerate s (FA13) and sand–homogeneous mud couplets that occur in bot h marine and isolated/semi-isolated units. Overall occurrence o f slumped and mud-supported conglomerates increases with dept h in Unit 1, with a particularly thick slumped interval occurring i n Subunit 1-11.  

Unit 2 has a composition similar to that of Unit 1 and is dominated by light gray to buff weakly laminated to homogeneous highl y bioturbated mud (FA12; Figure F9). It is also dominated by fine silt– sized detrital calcite, similar to Site M0078, with lower concentrations of siliciclastic grains compared with Unit 1. In contrast to Sit e  

M0078, Unit 2 contains fining-upward sands (FA10) and large decimeter- to meter-scale slump structures and mud-supported intraclast conglomerates (FA13).  

# Site M0080  

The lithostratigraphy of Site M0080 is divided into four unit s with boundaries at 136.96, 256.85, and 458.4 mbsf (Figure F10). Units 1 and 2 are dominated by moderately sorted, silt- to claygrade calcite. Other minor terrigenous components include quartz, mica, and feldspar mineral grains. Occasionally, both calcite an d aragonite occur in equal proportions. Biogenic components an d framboidal pyrite are common throughout.  

Unit 1 has characteristics similar to those of Unit 1 at Site s M0078 and M0079 and is divided into 11 subunits based on alternations between dominantly bioturbated homogeneous and poorl y bedded greenish gray and gray mud (FA1 and FA6) and bedded an d laminated mud (FA2, FA3, FA4, and FA5) (Figure F10). These sediments are interpreted as dominantly deep-water turbiditic an d hemipelagic deposits. The alternating subunits are interpreted t o represent  alternating  marine  (homogeneous  mud)  and  isolated/semi-isolated (bedded and laminated mud) environments, with good correlation with micropaleontology results. Unit 2 is divided into an upper part dominated by light gray bioturbated mu d (FA12) and a lower part with greater variability of facies and grai n size, including ophiolitic-rich conglomerates, highly bioturbate d mudstones with shallow-water foraminifer assemblages, and occasional paleosols. The lower part of this unit reflects a transitio n downhole in paleoenvironment from subaqueous to subaerial, marking the top of a significant interval of subaerial deposition i n Unit 3.  

Two main facies associations dominate Unit 3: the upper hal f has a high proportion of coarse clastic sediments, with clasts including basic/ultrabasic ophiolite, limestone, and chert (FA7), tha t pass down into distinctive red-brown fine-grained muds and silts o f FA8 (Figure F10). The very fine sand to mud fraction commonl y contains abundant clay-sized Fe oxides that may be responsible fo r the reddish brown to pale yellow color of the sediments. The base o f the unit comprises a range of facies associations, including shell y bioturbated muds of FA17. The character of the conglomerates an d dominance of calcrete soils in Unit 3 suggest an ephemeral alluvia l setting subject to a fluctuating water table.  

Unit 4 at Site M0080 is dominated by shelly laminated to bedde d carbonates (FA15 and FA16) that suggest a reduction in clastic input and most likely formed in a low-energy nearshore setting. Th e basal two cores of Unit 4 consist of polymict pebble–cobble conglomerates featuring abundant limestone clasts with minor re d chert and basic/ultrabasic clasts, reflecting a high-energy alluvia l (fan) environment.  

Units 3 and 4 include ophiolitic-derived grains and clasts in al l grain size fractions but most obviously in the coarser grain siz e range (sand to pebble grade). Carbonate minerals are most commonly calcite, whereas the ophiolitic-derived mafic sediment grain s largely comprise pyroxenes, serpentinized olivine, and plagioclase.  

# Structural geology  

Both natural and drilling-induced deformation were recorded i n the cores. Natural faults were distinguished from drilling-induce d faulting or other forms of drilling-induced deformation by their planar geometries and lack of influence by proximity to either the cor e liner or core axis (i.e., by not curving to become parallel to the cor e axis, forming conjugate pairs with an intersection at the core axis, o r curving into the core liner).  

# Site M0078  

At Site M0078, bedding attitude is horizontal to subhorizonta l with local tilting and apparent bedding dips increasing downhole u p to $24^{\circ}$ (slightly higher than measured dips in coincident seismic reflection data; Figure F5). Small-scale natural faulting was observe d sporadically throughout the hole, including frequent normal fault s and less common reverse and strike-slip faults. Faulting intensit y generally increases with depth but with faulting concentrated in discrete intervals, in particular in the 329–447 mbsf interval aroun d the lithostratigraphic Unit 1/2 boundary. A general lack of faults i n the deeper part of Unit 2 may be related to destruction due to rotar y drilling–induced biscuiting. Normal fault displacements range fro m $1~\mathrm{mm}$ to $35~\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and orientation measurements on selected fault s indicate that they may form conjugate sets throughout the core. Th e sampled normal fault dips show true dips ranging from $42^{\circ}$ to $82^{\circ}$ with a modal average of $60^{\circ}{-}70^{\circ}$ and a mean of $66^{\circ}$ . The general abundance and geometry of observed small normal faults is i n agreement with the overall extensional nature of the rift deformation.  

Drilling-induced deformation intensity and style were recorde d to determine the state of cores for interpretation and analysis an d for potential postexpedition analysis of sediment physical properties variations. A range of drilling-induced structures was observed, including biscuiting, arching bedding, tilted panels, lensing, smearing/flow of sediment along the core lining, voids, and open fractures. In general, drilling-induced deformation increases downhole. Piston coring generated sporadic slight to moderate drilling-induced deformation. Rotary coring from 224 mbsf downhole is associated with a marked increase in intensity (moderate to high) an d deformation dominated by biscuiting and inflow of sediment an d drilling fluid between biscuits.  

# Site M0079  

Bedding attitude is generally horizontal to subhorizontal despit e a gentle increase in dip of reflection horizons in seismic data wit h depth at Site $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{M0079}}$ (Figure F6). Small-scale natural faulting wa s observed sporadically throughout the hole, and concentrated faulting was observed in discrete intervals at 48–62, 259–278, 472–548, and 686–698 mbsf. More significant faulting with larger displacements occurs below 547 mbsf. Faulting intensity varies downhol e from 0.7 to $10\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ . All natural faults in Hole M0079A have apparen t normal offset, with displacements of $1~\mathrm{mm}$ to ${>}14~\mathrm{cm}$ . Faults sampled for orientation analysis appear to form a conjugate set aroun d an average north–south strike in the core reference frame, but sampling is biased to what is exposed on the split-core face. The abundance and geometry of small normal faults are consistent with thos e observed at Site M0078 and with the extensional rift deformation.  

A wide range of drilling-induced structures was observed, mos t commonly biscuiting, shear fractures, arching and disturbed bedding, smearing/flow of sediment along the edges of the core, voids, and open fractures; the intensity and style of drilling-induced structures vary downhole. Overall drilling-induced deformation intensity is reduced relative to Hole M0078A (most likely due to change s in drilling and coring methods). Biscuiting is regularly present below 300 mbsf. Below 574 mbsf, cores are more intensely deformed, with biscuiting dominant. Well-developed, drilling-induced shea r fracturing is a characteristic feature of Hole M0079A (not observe d in Hole M0078A) and is a regular feature below 276 mbsf. Fracture s often form as conjugate pairs typically intersecting in the center o f the core or steepening toward the center of the core.  

# Site M0080  

Bedding attitude is generally horizontal to subhorizontal, despite a gentle increase in dip of reflection horizons in seismic data a t depth at Site M0080 (Figure F7). Small-scale natural faulting wa s observed in lithostratigraphic Units 1, 3, and 4, with no faults between 101 and 368 mbsf. The lack of faulting in this interval may b e related to lithologic and rheological properties. In Unit 1, faultin g intensity varies from 1.4 to $10.5\,\mathrm{\m^{-1}}$ , and all faults have apparen t normal offsets with displacements of $0.2\;\mathrm{mm}$ to $3.2~\mathrm{cm}$ . In Units  3 and 4, faulting intensity varies from 0.7 to $4~\mathrm{m^{-1}}$ . Some faults hav e apparent displacements larger than their length in the core and ar e characterized by fault gouges and mineralized mirror surfaces wit h slickenlines. Faults sampled for orientation data illustrate a conjugate fault set striking NNE–SSW in the core reference frame in Uni t 1, but sampling is biased to what is exposed on the split-core face. I n Units 3 and 4, orientations are more variable, and slickenlines indicate oblique slip and strike-slip motion. The geometries of faults i n Unit 1 are consistent with those at Sites M0078 and M0079 and th e extensional rift deformation; however, the range of motion sense s and geometries in Units 3 and 4 suggest a more complex history o f faulting.  

A wide range of drilling-induced structures was observed, mos t commonly biscuiting, shear fractures, arching bedding, smearing/flow of sediment along the edges of the core, and voids; the intensity and style of drilling-induced structures vary downhole. Overall, the intensity of drilling-induced deformation varies, wit h significant lengths of core with little or none, which may be relate d to a combination of drilling technique and strength of the materials. Below 15 mbsf, drilling-induced deformation associated with pisto n coring is pervasive with soupy textures, flow along the core line r and axis, and even complete mobilization and destruction of bedding in some cores. Biscuiting is dominant between 156 and 24 4 mbsf with the onset of rotary coring and again between 314 and 53 0 mbsf, where it is associated with intense brecciation between biscuits. Overall, shear fracturing is less common than at Site M0079.  

# Micropaleontology  

Micropaleontological analysis included calcareous nannofossils, marine and nonmarine diatoms, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and palynomorphs (terrestrial and aquatic pollen and spores, dinoflagellate cysts, green algae coenobia and spores, fungal remains, foraminifer test linings, and microscopic charred particles). The combined examination of microfossil groups in the younges t synrift sediments revealed variations between marine, mixed (marine with nonmarine), nonmarine, and indeterminate (e.g., barren ) microfossil assemblages constructed by complex environmenta l and depositional settings in the Corinth basin; alternating paleoenvironment was particularly evident in the most recent rift phase. Each microfossil group contributes unique information to the regional/basinal paleoenvironmental interpretation. Additionally, calcareous nannofossils contributed to the chronostratigraphic mode l for the stratigraphic sequence. Diatoms provided critical information about depositional environments in both marine and isolate d intervals but especially in isolated intervals. Planktonic and benthi c foraminifers were used to interpret the evolution of the paleoceanographic conditions in the basin during marine phases. Palynolog y provided a link between the terrestrial and aquatic realms and a n assessment of changes in terrestrial paleovegetation and aquati c ecosystems.  

# Site M0078  

The micropaleontology at Site M0078 revealed a high level o f complexity both in individual microfossil groups and collectively. I n the 16 subunits of lithostratigraphic Unit 1, micropaleontological assemblages alternate primarily between marine and undetermine d assemblages but also include several mixed and nonmarine assemblages. Lithostratigraphic Unit 2 is devoid of marine calcareous an d siliceous microfossils, containing only nonmarine diatoms and terrestrial and aquatic pollen, dinoflagellate cysts, green algae coenobia  and  spores,  fungal  remains,  and  foraminifer  test  linings. Calcareous nannofossils were observed in almost all Unit 1 sample s but with significantly lower abundances and diversity in the isolated/semi-isolated subunits. In general, Gephyrocapsa is the mos t dominant genus. Late Quaternary age control in Unit 1 is provide d loosely by three biostratigraphic events: (1) the last occurrence (LO ) of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa $\left(0.43\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ , supported by the co-occurrence with Umbilicosphaera sibogae; (2) the first occurrence (FO) o f Emiliania huxleyi $\left(0.29\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ ; and (3) a crossover in dominance between E. huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa “small” $(<\!3\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , documented t o be ${\sim}70$ ka in the Mediterranean Sea (Anthonissen and Ogg, 2012). Because of the punctuated nature of marine environments here, it i s important to keep in mind that the precision of these biohorizons i s low. Unit 2 is nearly devoid of in situ calcareous nannofossils. Marine diatoms were observed in the majority of the fully marine subunits. Nonmarine diatoms were most commonly observed in th e isolated/semi-isolated subunits but were also sometimes observe d in low abundance with marine microfossils and were poorly preserved. The assemblages are not diverse and are dominated by species of the Pontosphaera ocellata group. The assemblages in th e underlying Unit 2 are more diverse but are still dominated by th e planktonic P. ocellata complex. Benthic and planktonic foraminifer s are well preserved but have highly variable abundances and compositions in Unit 1.  

Foraminifers tend to be absent or in low abundances in isolated/semi-isolated subunits and abundant to trace in the marin e subunits. In the marine subunits, foraminifers reach high abundances, and in general benthic foraminifers tend to be more abundant  than  planktonic  foraminifers.  Planktonic  and  benthi c foraminifers are absent from Unit 2 samples. From palynological analysis, the trees versus herbs percentage curve shows alternatin g periods dominated by forests or herb vegetation that correlate wit h marine and isolated/semi-isolated intervals, respectively. The interpreted aquatic ecosystem ranges from marine to brackish to evidence for freshwater influx. Highly diverse marine dinoflagellat e assemblages correlate with the fully marine intervals, and low dinocyst diversity samples with low salinity indicators suggest deposition under low-salinity (brackish) conditions.  

# Site M0079  

The micropaleontology at Site M0079 revealed a high level o f complexity both in individual microfossil groups and collectively, a s at Site M0078. In the 16 subunits of lithostratigraphic Unit 1, micropaleontological assemblages alternate primarily between marin e and undetermined assemblages but also include some mixed an d nonmarine assemblages. Lithostratigraphic Unit 2 is nearly devoi d of marine and terrestrial microfossils. Calcareous nannofossils wer e observed in almost all Unit 1 samples but with significantly lowe r abundances and diversity in isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Gephyrocapsa is the most dominant species. Late Quaternary age contro l in Unit 1 is provided loosely by three biostratigraphic events tha t were also observed at Site M0078: (1) the LO of $P\!\!\!\!/$ lacunosa (0.4 3 Ma), (2) the FO of $E_{\mathrm{{*}}}$ . huxleyi $\left(0.29\,\mathrm{{Ma})}$ , and (3) a crossover in dominance between $E$ . huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa “small” $\left(<3\ \upmu\mathrm{m}\right)$ . Because of the punctuated nature of marine environments here, it i s important to bear in mind that the precision of these biohorizons i s low. Unit 2 is completely devoid of in situ calcareous nannofossils. As at Site M0078, marine diatoms were observed in the majority o f the fully marine subunits. Nonmarine diatoms were most commonly observed in the isolated/semi-isolated subunits, typically i n combination with low abundances of marine microfossils. On occasion, nonmarine diatoms were observed in low abundance in marine intervals; however, because of poor preservation, they are no t interpreted to be in situ. The nonmarine diatom assemblages ar e dominated by several morphotypes of the $P\!\!\!\!/$ ocellata complex. Benthic and planktonic foraminifers are well preserved but have highl y variable abundances and compositions in Unit 1. Eight interval s with relatively high abundances of benthic and/or planktonic foraminifer species in Unit 1 suggest the prevalence of marine conditions. In these intervals, benthic foraminifer abundance is generall y higher than that of planktonic foraminifers. Foraminifers tend to b e absent or in low abundances in isolated/semi-isolated subunits, although intervals with higher foraminifer abundance were also observed. Planktonic and benthic foraminifers are absent from Unit  2 samples. The majority of the pollen assemblages corresponding t o marine intervals in Unit 1 are characterized by high tree abundances, suggesting the occurrence of forested landscapes in the surroundings of the Gulf of Corinth, whereas in pollen assemblage s corresponding to isolated/semi-isolated intervals, herb and tre e abundances are nearly equal. As at Site M0078, dinoflagellate assemblages show alternating periods of marine and brackish paleoenvironments correlating with marine and isolated/semi-isolate d intervals, respectively.  

# Site M0080  

At Site M0080, the microfossil assemblages in lithostratigraphi c Unit 1 indicate alternation primarily between marine and undetermined/barren assemblages but also include a few mixed and nonmarine assemblages toward the base of the unit. Unit 2 alternate s between nonmarine and undetermined/barren assemblages. Unit  3 is devoid of microfossils except palynomorphs because it is almos t entirely terrestrial. Unit 4 is nearly devoid of the microfossil group s analyzed, with the exception of three samples that contain calcareous nannofossils in very low concentrations. Calcareous nannofossils similar to those observed at Sites M0078 and M0079 wer e observed in all marine intervals in Unit 1. Late Quaternary age control in Unit 1 is loosely provided by two biohorizons: (1) the crossover in dominance between $E$ . huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa “small ” $(<\!3\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ and (2) the FO of $E$ . huxleyi. As at Sites M0078 and M0079, the true FO of $E$ . huxleyi was probably not observed. Units 2 and  3 are devoid of in situ calcareous nannofossils, and nannofossils ar e rarely present in Unit 4, where their implications for age are bein g investigated. Initial investigations suggest marine diatoms are present in significantly lower abundances than at Sites M0078 an d ${\cal M}0079$ . The nonmarine diatom assemblages show better preservation and greater diversity of benthic taxa, indicating a shallower environment  compared  with  the  other  two  sites.  Benthic  an d planktonic foraminifers are present only in Units 1 and 2, wit h highly variable abundances and compositions. Planktonic foraminifers similar to those observed at Sites M0078 and M0079 were observed in all marine intervals in Hole M0080A. The benthi c foraminifer assemblages in the lower part of Unit 1 and in Unit  2 imply shallow-marine depositional environments. Pollen assemblages in Units 1 and 2 corresponding to interpreted marine intervals show high tree abundances, suggesting the occurrence of  a forested landscape surrounding the Alkyonides Gulf, whereas i n isolated/semi-isolated intervals, herb and tree abundances ar e nearly equal. Dinoflagellate assemblages indicating marine an d brackish paleoenvironments were observed in Units 1 and 2, whereas Units 3 and 4 were devoid of dinocysts.  

# Geochemistry  

Pore water was collected from core samples offshore using Rhizons and squeeze cakes. Offshore, these samples were analyzed fo r alkalinity, ammonium, ${\mathsf{p H}},$ , and salinity. During the OSP, a combination of methods was applied to pore water samples to measure anions, cations, phosphate, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Solid samples were selected and processed during the OSP and wer e measured for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) elemental composition, Xray diffraction (XRD; results were incorporated into Lithostratigraphy), total carbon (TC) and total organic carbon (TOC).  

# Site M0078  

At Site M0078, 82 pore water samples were analyzed from Hole s M0078A and M0078B, and 127 bulk sediment samples were processed during the OSP. Pore water and solid-phase chemical result s follow very similar trends in Holes M0078A and M0078B. Pore water composition in the uppermost 30–50 mbsf at Site M0078 reflects a diffusion profile of dissolved elements from the wate r column into the sediments (sodium, chloride, and sulfate) and ion s produced during the degradation of organic matter (ammonium, bicarbonate, phosphate, iron, and manganese) diffusing from the sediments into the water column. Comparison of salinity values t o those of sodium and chloride indicate that the major salt contributing to the pore water is sodium chloride. Significant changes between the pore water above and below the lithostratigraphic Uni t 1/2 boundary were observed; higher concentrations of sodium an d chloride and ions associated with carbonates (calcium, magnesium, and strontium) were observed below the boundary. Changes in por e water composition below the Unit 1/2 boundary may reflect th e change in sediment composition, which is evident from the elemental composition of the solid sediment. Although solid sedimen t samples are carbonate rich throughout Hole M0078A, below th e Unit 1/2 boundary an increase in the dominance of carbonate i s clear from higher calcium concentrations. Organic carbon is lo w throughout Site M0078, ranging from 0.07 to $0.89\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

# Site M0079  

At Site M0079, 77 pore water samples were analyzed, and 11 1 bulk sediment samples were processed during the OSP. From th e seafloor to approximately 50 mbsf, pore water composition show s decreasing salinity $(\mathrm{from}\ 38.17$ to 10.48) alongside decreasing por e fluid sodium, chloride, and sulfate concentrations, reflecting a diffusion of ions from the seawater into the sediment. Dissolved chloride ranges between 7.82 and $610.49\,\mathrm{\mM}$ , and dissolved sodiu m varies from 51.65 to $541.73~\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}$ ; their highest values are in the upper 0.5 mbsf at the sediment/water interface.  

Iron, which varies between 0 and $71.52~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ and manganese, which ranges from 0 to $220.63\ensuremath{~\upmu\mathrm{M}}$ , both increase in the uppermos t 9 mbsf, most likely due to generation of these ions during microbia l oxidation of organic matter. Other ions generated during the degradation of organic matter (ammonium, bicarbonate, and phosphate ) also show this increase in the uppermost part of the hole but fluctuate with depth, reflecting the complex nature of the geochemical environment. Ions commonly associated with carbonates (calciu m $[\mathrm{mean}=3.82\:\mathrm{mM}]$ , magnesium $[\mathrm{mean}=17.41\;\mathrm{mM}]$ , and strontiu m [mean $=\ 0.11\,\mathrm{\mM}]$ ) also vary with depth and, similar to Hol e M0078A, increase at the base of Hole M0079A. These observation s are in agreement with the solid sample analyses.  

Analysis of solid sediment samples (total inorganic carbo n [TIC] and calcium) suggests that the sediment is predominantl y composed of carbonate, which generally increases with depth $\mathbf{\check{C}a=}$ $175.0\mathrm{-}228.0\,\mathrm{g/kg;\,TIC}=3.95\mathrm{-}10.52\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ . Elements associated wit h detrital material (silicon, aluminum, zircon, and potassium), in contrast, decrease with depth.  

# Site M0080  

At Site M0080, 62 pore water samples were analyzed, and 6 8 bulk sediment samples were processed during the OSP. Pore wate r profiles in the uppermost section of Hole M0080A show change s that most likely reflect diffusion profiles. Decreases in salinity fro m close to seawater values (35.74) to much lower values (12.38) at 4 9 mbsf, along with decreases in sodium, chloride and sulfate concentrations, are likely linked to diffusion from seawater into the sediment. The highest concentrations of dissolved iron and manganes e (as high as 166.74 and $31.45\;\upmu\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , respectively) at the top of the hol e decrease to relatively stable state concentrations below around 3 0 mbsf. This trend is likely due to generation of these dissolved ion s during oxidation of organic matter and diffusion into the water column. Concentrations of other ions linked to organic matter degradation (ammonium, phosphate, alkalinity, and DIC) also increase i n the uppermost 20 mbsf (with maxima of $2.1~\mathrm{mM}$ , $21.44~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ , 13.8 7 $\mathrm{mM}$ , and $12.59\;\mathrm{mM}$ , respectively). Below this depth, these ions continue to be present in variable concentrations, possibly relating t o various loci of organic matter degradation.  

Below the lithostratigraphic Unit 2/3 boundary, ions relating t o organic matter degradation are generally present in low concentrations, whereas ions related to marine seawater appear to be high, comparable to modern day local seawater. Calcium and magnesiu m ion concentrations, which are typically related to carbonate, also increase in Unit 3. Average calcium and magnesium ion concentrations are 8.16 and $38.86~\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , respectively, throughout the hole bu t reach maxima of 34.65 and $86.85\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , respectively, in Unit 3.  

Bulk geochemical results from solid sample analysis indicat e that lithostratigraphic Units 1, 2, and 4 are dominated by calciu m carbonate, with inorganic carbon averaging $8.34~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and calciu m averaging $237.77~\mathrm{g/kg}$ . In Unit 3, silicon dominates with an averag e of $172.68~\mathrm{g/kg}$ compared with $83.63~\mathrm{g/kg}$ in Units 1, 2, and 4. Thi s switch in dominance, alongside higher values of aluminum, potassium, rubidium, and zirconium, suggests a change to more siliciclastic  sediment  in  Unit  3.  Organic  carbon  content  is  lo w throughout, averaging $0.24~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and is lowest in Unit 3 (average $=$ $0.06\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ).  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties data acquired offshore and onshore o n whole cores, split cores, and discrete samples exhibit coherent variations with depth and between different lithologies. Shear strengt h was estimated with handheld penetrometer measurements o n whole cores and in situ cone penetration tests offshore and from fall cone and shear vane tests on split cores during the OSP. MSCL density data were acquired on whole cores offshore, and moisture an d density (MAD) density and porosity were measured on discret e samples during the OSP. MSCL magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and natural gamma ray (NGR) data were acquired offshore o n whole cores, and color reflectance data were acquired on split core s during the OSP. Attempts were made to collect $P$ -wave velocity dat a on whole cores, half cores, and discrete samples. At Sites M007 8 and M0079, reliable velocity measurements were only obtained i n restricted intervals, primarily in the upper parts of the core, but reliable results were obtained for a large part of Site M0080. Betwee n the offshore phase and the OSP, thermal conductivity measurements were conducted on whole cores prior to splitting.  

# Site M0078  

At Site M0078, MAD, MSCL density, MSCL resistivity, an d shear strength data indicate increases in sediment density an d strength and a reduction in porosity with depth, consistent wit h compaction (Figure F8). Sharp increases in density and shea r strength were observed at 225 mbsf, near the transition to rotar y coring. Overall, low NGR values at Site M0078 indicate low potassium (K), uranium (U), and thorium (Th) concentrations.  

Physical properties vary between the two defined lithostratigraphic units. In Unit 1, physical properties show clear variation between the marine and isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Marin e subunits (odd numbers) are characterized by higher NGR value s and lower and less scattered magnetic susceptibility values than isolated/semi-isolated subunits (even numbers; Figure F8). Lower density values are commonly associated with marine subunits and/o r with transitions from these subunits into those above and below. Marine subunits have lower mean $L^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ values and higher mea n $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ values compared with the means for the hole. Unit 2 is characterized by low and highly variable NGR values, scattered magnetic susceptibility values, low thermal conductivity, and lighter colors, resulting in higher mean $L^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ values and lower $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ values fro m color reflectance data. Density values are less scattered in Unit 2 bu t show in-core trends in MSCL data related to coring and drilling.  

# Site M0079  

Overall, as at Site M0078, MAD, MSCL density, MSCL resistivity, and shear strength data at Site M0079 indicate increases in sediment density and strength and a reduction in porosity with depth, consistent  with  compaction  (Figure  F9).  However,  low  shea r strength, density, and velocity values and high porosity values in th e upper $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf suggest relatively little compaction in this interval. Comparison between $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity values from discrete measurements, those from the downhole logging data, and those predicted by core-log-seismic integration (CLSI) suggests that velocit y values in the upper ${\sim}225$ mbsf are realistic, but that velocity value s below this depth are anomalously low.  

Also similar to Hole M0078A, significant variations in Hol e M0079A were observed in many physical properties between th e marine and isolated/semi-isolated subunits in Unit 1. Marine subunits are characterized by higher NGR values and lower and les s scattered magnetic susceptibility values than isolated/semi-isolate d subunits (Figure F9). Lower density values are commonly associated with marine subunits and/or with transitions at the boundarie s of these subunits. Conversely, shear strength and velocity appear t o increase in some marine subunits. Marine subunits have lowe r mean $L^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ values and higher mean $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ values compared wit h means for the hole from color reflectance data.  

The lithostratigraphic Unit 1/2 boundary does not have a clea r expression in physical properties measurements.  

# Site M0080  

Physical properties from Hole M0080A cores show more variability than at Sites M0078 and M0079, reflecting the greater diversity of depositional environments and lithologies encountered. Most lithostratigraphic unit boundaries have a clear signature in th e physical properties data. A change was also observed in most physical properties data sets at the boundary between Subunits 3-1 an d 3-2 at ${\sim}350$ mbsf. Density values increase steadily with depth, consistent with compaction and strengthening (Figure F10). Resistivit y shows slightly more complex variation with depth, with a pronounced increase in values downhole at the Unit 3/4 boundary.  

Variations in physical properties reflecting environmental variation in Unit 1 were observed, as at Sites M0078 and M0079. In Uni t 1, density and magnetic susceptibility increase and porosity an d NGR decrease in isolated/semi-isolated intervals relative to the marine intervals. Marine subunits have lower mean $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ value s and higher mean $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ values compared with means for the hole fro m color reflectance data. Density, color reflectance, and porosity values become more scattered in the lower part of Unit 2 and transitioning into Unit 3. NGR decreases and then increases in Unit 3, followed by a sharp decrease into Unit 4 (Figure F10). Magnetic susceptibility increases in Unit 3, with a slight decrease with depth an d a sharp reduction into Unit 4. These trends are thought to reflec t the varied composition of the changing subaqueous and subaeria l sequences in these units (see Lithostratigraphy).  

Velocity data from discrete measurements in Units 1 and 2 ar e relatively low, but some values are consistent with sonic data acquired by downhole logging. In Units 3 and 4, both discrete an d MSCL $P$ -wave data appear to be more reliable. Velocity values average $2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ in the lower part of Unit 3. Unit 4 is characterized b y increased velocity values but with variations between the two cor e velocity data sets $(2000{-}3000~\mathrm{m/s}$ on the MSCL and 2000–350 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ on discrete samples).  

# Paleomagnetism  

# Site M0078  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured on 500 samples fro m Holes M0078A and M0078B, and the results show a good matc h with MSCL magnetic susceptibility. Above $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf, magneti c susceptibility variations are relatively small and exhibit differen t patterns in marine and isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Muc h higher variability in magnetic susceptibility was observed belo w $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf. Overall, magnetic susceptibility and natural remanen t magnetization (NRM) exhibit similar patterns with depth, suggesting that variations in susceptibility are primarily controlled by th e concentration of magnetic minerals.  

Thermal variation in magnetic susceptibility was determined o n five representative samples at the University of Hawaii prior to th e OSP. Most samples show a primary Curie temperature of $518^{\circ}-$ $577^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , indicating the occurrence of Ti-poor titanomagnetite, although a couple of lower Curie temperatures may indicate the occurrence of greigite.  

The direction and intensity of NRM were also determined o n 500 samples from Holes M0078A and M0078B. The inclination values are dominantly positive (normal polarity) in Unit 1, which ma y correspond to the Brunhes Normal Chron $(0{-}0.773\,\mathrm{\Ma})$ ). Som e anomalous low inclinations in this upper interval may represent excursions of the geomagnetic field in the Brunhes Chron. Below th e transition from Unit 1 to 2, inclination values are dominantly negative (reversed polarity), although several samples with normal polarity are also present.  

# Site M0079  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured on 532 samples fro m Hole M0079A, and the results show a good match with MSCL magnetic susceptibility. Above $\mathord{\sim}540$ mbsf, magnetic susceptibility variations are relatively small and exhibit different patterns in marin e and isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Much higher variability i n magnetic susceptibility was observed below $\mathord{\sim}540$ mbsf. Overall, magnetic susceptibility and NRM exhibit similar patterns wit h depth, suggesting that variations in susceptibility are primarily controlled by the concentration of magnetic minerals.  

Thermal variation in magnetic susceptibility was determined o n eight representative samples at the University of Hawaii prior to th e OSP. The results of the thermomagnetic experiments reveal a wid e range of Curie temperatures between $364^{\circ}$ and $595\mathrm{^\circC}$ . However, most of the samples show a primary Curie temperature betwee n $502^{\circ}$ and $585\mathrm{^\circC_{:}}$ , which is typical of Ti-poor titanomagnetite. Othe r Curie temperatures between $364^{\circ}$ and $486^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ suggest the occurrenc e of iron sulfides (likely greigite) or Ti-rich titanomagnetite.  

The direction and intensity of NRM were also determined o n 532 samples from Hole M0079A. The inclination values are dominantly positive (normal polarity) in Unit 1, with the exception o f two samples that show a negative inclination (reversed polarity). This uppermost interval may represent the Brunhes Normal Chron, with the two reversed polarity samples possibly corresponding t o excursions of the geomagnetic field. Inclination values show a wide r variability from negative to positive below this depth and requir e further postexpedition analysis.  

# Site M0080  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured on 379 samples fro m Hole M0080A, and the results show a good match with MSCL susceptibility. Above ${\sim}250$ mbsf, magnetic susceptibility variations ar e relatively small. A much higher variability, with overall higher values of susceptibility, was observed between ${\sim}250$ and ${\sim}460$ mbsf, likely related to the occurrence of mafic ophiolitic clasts in Unit 3. Magnetic susceptibility and NRM exhibit similar patterns wit h depth, suggesting that variations in susceptibility are primarily controlled by the concentration of magnetic minerals. The results of th e thermomagnetic experiments reveal a wide range of Curie temperatures between $116^{\circ}$ and $646^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , indicating the occurrence of Ti-ric h titanomagnetite, iron sulfides (likely greigite), and likely oxidize d titanomagnetite (i.e., titanomaghemite).  

The direction and intensity of NRM were also determined o n 379 samples from Hole M0080A. The inclination values are dominantly positive (normal polarity) in Units 1 and 2 and the uppermost part of Unit 3, with six samples showing a negative inclinatio n (reversed polarity). At greater depths, samples have a dominantl y negative inclination (reversed polarity) that become positive agai n toward the bottom of the hole. The polarity transition observed i n Unit 3 corresponds to the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary (0.77 3 Ma). The reversed polarity intervals observed in the uppermos t normal polarity interval may represent excursions of the geomagnetic field during the Brunhes Normal Chron.  

# Downhole logging  

# Site M0079  

Downhole logging data were collected through pipe (gamm a ray) from the bottom of Hole M0079A to the seafloor and in the upper part of the open hole with logs recording magnetic susceptibility and conductivity $\leftmoon297$ to ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline log depth belo w seafloor [WSF]), sonic velocity ( ${\sim}230$ to ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ WSF), and dual resistivity $({\sim}290{-}50\ \mathrm{m}$ WSF). Gamma ray values, even though measured through the pipe, compare well with MSCL data collected o n cores. The overall trend shows some correspondence to the marin e and isolated/semi-isolated intervals. The slumped interval described in the deeper part of Unit 1 (484.48–506.4 mbsf; see Lithostratigraphy) is associated with a clear drop in gamma ray counts . Resistivity values derived from the conductivity data (magnetic susceptibility and conductivity tool) and collected with the dual resistivity log compare well with each other and with MSCL resistivit y data acquired on cores, and the values indicate low resistivity in th e formation (typically $<\!5\;\Omega\mathbf{m}\rangle$ ). Trends in the magnetic susceptibilit y log acquired downhole mirror those from MSCL data on cores, wit h a clear variation associated with changing basin environment: magnetic susceptibility tends to be lower in marine intervals/subunit s and higher and more scattered in the isolated/semi-isolated intervals/subunits. Sonic data suggest low velocity, typically betwee n 1500 and $1700\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ from 50 to $190\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ and increasing to value s as high as ${\sim}1900\ \mathrm{m/s}$ from 190 to $^{230}\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF.  

# Site M0080  

Hole M0080A logging operations were very successful, wit h most of the hole (0 to ${\sim}530~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) covered with a suite of standar d logging tools: spectral gamma ray through pipe and magnetic susceptibility and conductivity, dual induction resistivity, sonic, an d spectral gamma ray in the open hole. Spectral gamma ray data wer e acquired through the pipe from the bottom of the hole to the seafloor and in the open hole principally from ${\sim}370$ to $50\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF. Magnetic susceptibility and conductivity data cover most of the hole, with gaps from ${\sim}220$ to ${\sim}230\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ and at $430\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. Dual induction (resistivity) data cover the hole from ${\sim}370$ to $50\textrm{m}$ WSF, with a gap from ${\sim}220$ to ${\sim}230\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. Sonic data cover from th e bottom of the hole to $50\mathrm{\;m\;WSF},$ , with gaps from ${\sim}430$ to ${\sim}370$ an d from ${\sim}230$ to ${\sim}220\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF.  

The collected logs reflect the main lithostratigraphic units identified in Hole M0080A. In particular, magnetic susceptibility lo g data clearly respond to the changing depositional environments an d potentially  sediment  composition.  Unit  1  is  characterized  b y gamma ray counts of 50–100 counts/s, low magnetic susceptibilit y values, and relatively low velocity values between 1500 and 160 0 $\mathrm{m/s}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , consistent with some of the discrete velocity measurements. Gamma ray increases in marine subunits, and magnetic susceptibility shows locally higher values in the isolated/semi-isolated subunits of Unit 1. In Unit 2, the gamma ray counts are lower than i n Unit 1 and magnetic susceptibility remains low with local increase s in Subunits 1-4 and 1-5. Velocity values increase to $1700{-}2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ in Unit 2. Magnetic susceptibility increases significantly in Unit 3, associated with increased scattering. Similar scattering was observed in the resistivity data, and sonic velocity increases to value s $>\!2000\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Data in this unit may be affected by poorer and variabl e borehole conditions. At the boundary between Subunits 3-1 an d 3-2, magnetic susceptibility decreases, gamma ray increases, and resistivity and sonic velocity sharply increase. In Unit 4, gamma ra y (through pipe) drops again to reach values $^{<20}$ counts/s, magneti c susceptibility remains low with little variation, and sonic velocity increases abruptly to values close to $3000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ .  

Velocity data acquired on whole-round cores (MSCL) and discrete samples and from downhole logs show similar trends, but values differ slightly in some parts of the hole. In particular, in th e deeper part of the hole (Unit 4) MSCL data indicate velocity value s of $2000{-}2500\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , sonic data values are between 2500 and $3500\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and higher, and discrete core measurement values sit between thes e two data sets.  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

The goal of CLSI during Expedition 381 was to tie data and observations from each of the sites to the extensive seismic reflectio n database available in the Gulf of Corinth (e.g., Sachpazi et al., 2003; Zelt et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2011; McNeill et al., 2005; Bell et al., 2008, 2009; Lykousis et al., 2007; Sakellariou et al., 2007; Collier e t al., 2000; Leeder et al., 2002, 2005; Stefatos et al., 2002; Charalampakis et al., 2014; Nixon et al., 2016) (e.g., Figure F3). Synthetic seismograms were calculated with MSCL and MAD density and, wher e available, with velocity information from downhole logging, cor e physical properties, or existing pre-expedition velocity profiles derived from seismic data.  

# Site M0078  

Synthetic seismograms for Site M0078 (Figure F5) were calculated from MSCL density data from Holes M0078A and M0078 B and a velocity function estimated from seismic data before the expedition. Unfortunately, neither core MSCL nor discrete $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ measurements produced reliable velocity data for Site M0078. Nonetheless, the synthetic seismograms can be reliably tied to the seismic dat a using the pre-expedition velocity function. Minor adjustments t o the velocity function were made to match prominent reflections i n the synthetic seismogram to those in the coincident seismic data. Above 250 mbsf, the main high-reflectivity horizons in lithostratigraphic Unit 1 (seismic Unit 2) correspond to marine subunits, confirming the interpretations of Nixon et al. (2016) and other previou s authors. However, the marine intervals are sometimes thinner tha n estimated from the reflection data prior to the expedition. In th e lower part of Unit 1 (below ${\sim}250~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ), correlating seismic reflectors with subunit boundaries becomes more challenging becaus e this part of the section is condensed and parts of the section may b e missing. In this depth range, observed marine and isolated/semiisolated subunits sometimes correspond to the seismic phases bu t sometimes differ. The lower reflectivity sequences of lithostratigraphic Unit 2 (seismic Unit 1; Figure F5) proved to be more challenging to match to seismic reflection data due to the lack o f impedance contrasts in the core and seismic records. However, a t least two low-reflectivity horizons in Unit 2 can be potentiall y traced in the synthetic seismogram and tied to seismic data.  

# Site M0079  

MSCL density data were combined with a velocity function created from discrete velocity values and sonic data from downhol e logging in the upper part of Hole M0079A and a velocity functio n based on preliminary offshore CLSI in the lower part of the hole t o calculate synthetic seismograms. A comparison of all available velocity information indicates that the upper $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf is characterized  by  relatively  low  velocity  values  that  suggest  limite d compaction, consistent with other physical properties. Further minor adjustments to the velocity function were made to match prominent reflections in the synthetic seismogram to those in th e coincident seismic data. Synthetic seismograms exhibit patterns o f high and low reflectivity similar to those observed in seismic dat a crossing the site (Figure F6). Intervals of high reflectivity in synthetic seismograms correspond to marine subunits from lithostratigraphic Unit 1, confirming the interpretations of Nixon et al. (2016 ) and previous authors. In detail, CLSI demonstrates that the tops o f marine intervals correspond to the onsets of high-reflectivity intervals. In the lower part of Unit 1, the relationship between bright reflections and marine subunits is more complex, likely owing to th e small thicknesses of marine subunits and intervals in this part of th e hole. The deepest reflection, interpreted as the unit boundary i n seismic data, may in fact correspond to the deepest marine interva l of lithostratigraphic Unit 1.  

# Site M0080  

For Site M0080, MSCL density data were combined with a velocity function created from discrete velocity values, sonic dat a from downhole logging, and velocity values from offshore MSC L data to calculate synthetic seismograms. A comparison of all available velocity information indicates that the upper $\mathord{\sim}140$ mbsf i s characterized by relatively low velocity values that suggest limite d compaction, consistent with other physical properties. From $\mathord{\sim}150$ to ${\sim}450\,\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ an increase in velocity corresponds, on average, to th e velocity function estimated from seismic data before the expedition. Below ${\sim}450~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , there is a significant difference in average MSC L velocity values and the downhole logging velocity values, with th e former suggesting a lower range of ${\sim}2000{-}2500~\mathrm{m/s}$ and the latte r varying from ${\sim}2500$ to $3500\ \mathrm{m/s}$ . Both velocity scenarios were utilized for synthetic seismogram generation to determine their sensitivity to uncertainty in the input velocity profile.  

Synthetic seismograms at Site M0080 match the coincident seismic data remarkably well, but the correlation in Unit 4 is less clear. The four lithostratigraphic units identified from the cores have visibly different expressions in the seismic data around the site (Figur e F7). Lithostratigraphic Unit 1, a succession of relatively thin marin e and isolated/semi-isolated subunits, exhibits a series of continuou s reflectors with a very pronounced positive phase, likely produced b y the change to lower density in the marine intervals (from othe r physical properties data sets). Select subunit boundaries can be reliably traced from the cores to the seismic data. Lithostratigraphi c Unit 2 is characterized by a series of continuous reflectors wit h equally  pronounced positive  and  negative  phases. Lithostratigraphic Unit 3 has a more complex reflectivity signature characterized by discontinuous reflectors and some gaps in reflectivity, corresponding to the conglomerates in Subunit 3-1 and potentia l faults at the base of Subunit 3-2. Below ${\sim}450$ mbsf, the syntheti c seismogram and its correlation with lithostratigraphic Unit 4 varie s significantly depending on the input velocity model. For the case o f lower input velocity values derived from MSCL data, the top an d bottom of Unit 4 are marked by two distinct reflectors, the shallower of which was previously attributed to the top of acoustic basement (Nixon et al., 2016) but could now be interpreted as th e transition into basal conglomerates. Alternatively, using the highe r velocity values derived from the downhole log data, the whole o f Unit 4 maps onto the upper of these two reflectors, and subuni t boundaries in Unit 4 cannot be resolved. In this case, the reflecto r interpreted as the top of acoustic basement would be intersected a t the very bottom of Hole M0080A. Based on the properties of th e cored materials, the latter interpretation is favored, but furthe r work will be required to distinguish between these two end-members.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

The overarching objective of Expedition 381 was to drill, sample, and analyze the synrift sedimentary sequence that records a n extended period of the early stage continental rifting process in th e Corinth rift, Greece. This is the first time a record of this length an d resolution has been recovered in an active rift system. In th e Corinth rift, part of the rift depositional record is preserved onshore, but the most recent sequence is only present offshore. Onshore, only limited dating of the sedimentary sequence has bee n possible; therefore, there is little constraint on geological timing an d the rates of processes. Obtaining this record makes it possible to develop the chronostratigraphy, determine the environment of the basin through its rift development history, quantify changes i n depositional processes and sediment flux in the basin, and determine the rates and timings of rift and fault development, fault slip, and fault activity history.  

Expedition 381 was extremely successful. The drilling and coring objectives were almost completely achieved, and a total of 164 5 m of core was recovered from three sites over a $1905\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval. At Site M0078, the borehole depth was shortened slightly due t o projected time constraints; therefore, an intended part of the olde r synrift section was not recovered. At Site M0080, the drilling targe t was to reach acoustic basement (the older sedimentary sequence s underlying the synrift sequence). Basal conglomerates interprete d to immediately overlie basement were recovered, but there was insufficient time to continue to basement itself. Due to hole stabilit y problems and the loss of tools in one hole, only partial logging of th e three sites was conducted. At Site M0078, logging operations wer e conducted, but data are probably not usable. At Site M0079, a limited suite of logging tools were deployed, primarily only in the uppe r ${\sim}295\mathrm{~m~}$ of the hole. At Site M0080, a full suite of standard loggin g tools were used to collect data through almost the entire borehole. In spite of these (relatively minor) changes to the operational program, the combined coring and logging data sets collected will full y enable us to address the objectives of the expedition. Core recover y was excellent (average $86\%$ ), and core quality is good overall. Changes to coring and drilling methods during the expedition significantly improved subsequent core quality and increased rates o f progress, enabling the three sites to be completed very nearly a s planned in the time available.  

The potential range of scientific applications for this uniqu e data set is very large, encompassing tectonics, sedimentary processes, paleoenvironment, paleoclimate, paleoecology, geochemistry, and geohazards. We anticipate exciting and important result s from both the postexpedition research and from research endeavor s beyond the science party for many years to come.  

# Active rift sedimentary processes  

The three drill sites of Expedition 381 capture a long and highresolution record of sedimentation in the center of the Gulf o f Corinth and Alkyonides Gulf, with primarily fine grained, distal sediment gravity flow and hemipelagic deposits. The core material s show a clear link to the changing environment of the basin in th e most recent synrift succession, namely an alternation between  a marine environment during global sea level highstands and an isolated/semi-isolated environment during global sea level lowstands. In the marine intervals, sediments are predominantly homogeneou s bioturbated muddy sediments with a marine biogenic assemblage. In the isolated/semi-isolated intervals, sediments tend to exhibi t clearer bedding and fine-scale lamination, with coarser lamination s and beds apparently more pronounced. Sediment composition, primarily carbonate, shows a clear correlation with onshore drainage s and sediment sources, and grain analyses will be used in postexpedition research to assess changes in provenance. Organic components are common in the sediments, possibly with both marin e and terrestrial sources, and these components in turn affect th e geochemistry of the sediments and pore waters. In the deeper an d earlier rift sequences of the sites in the central gulf (Sites M0078 an d M0079; Figure F1), sediments become more homogeneous and lac k the clear cyclical signature related to the changing environment o f the basin driven by global sea level seen in the overlying sequence. Slump and debris flow deposits appear to be more common a t depth in the sequence, in particular at Site M0079, and may reflect  a change in rift faulting and activity and/or sediment flux.  

In the Alkyonides Gulf at Site M0080 (Figure F1), many differences are seen in the sedimentary sequence compared with sites i n the central gulf (Sites M0078 and M0079). Some of these difference s may reflect the smaller drainage systems feeding the basin, the shallower water depth of the site, and/or closer proximity to the shoreline. At depth at Site M0080, terrestrial alluvial–fluvial sequence s and deposits indicative of a shallow ephemeral basin fluctuating between a subaqueous and subaerial environment are preserved. These deposits predate the most recent phase of deeper water deposition affected by changing global sea level. The exact age of thes e older deposits is not yet clear, but they may include a record of a n earlier phase of Corinth rifting than that penetrated by the boreholes in the central gulf. Correlation of the earliest deposits at al l three sites with the onshore exhumed synrift sequences will be  a crucial element of postexpedition research to generate a complet e history of Corinth rift evolution and deposition and to identify an y along-axis variations in rift evolutionary history.  

# Paleoenvironment of the Corinth rift basin  

Sediments from the most recent rift phase reveal substantia l temporal variations in paleoenvironment in the Gulf of Corinth tha t appear to be driven by sea level fluctuations with respect to th e topographic sills bounding this semi-isolated basin and the suppl y of riverine water to the basin. These changes are manifest in varyin g microfossil assemblages, sediment lithology, and the chemistry o f the basin sediments and pore fluids. During marine periods whe n the gulf was connected to the global oceans, full suites of marin e microfossils were observed, including combinations of benthic an d planktonic foraminifers, marine diatoms, calcareous nannofossils, and marine dinoflagellate cysts; however, the abundance and diversity of microfossil groups vary between sites and with time. Durin g isolated/semi-isolated periods when the gulf appears to have bee n cut off from the global ocean, microfossil assemblages are ofte n complex, suggesting multifaceted paleoenvironmental conditions. The transitions between the marine and isolated/semi-isolated intervals expressed in the micropaleontological and sedimentary record are particularly complex and varied in their length an d character. Pollen analysis of the deposits also provides a link between the terrestrial and aquatic environments during this time. The sea level–driven paleoenvironmental change in the late Quaternary basin is also recorded in the lithology and geochemistry of th e most recent synrift sediments. The volume and mode of sedimen t delivery into the rift basin appear to change between marine an d isolated/semi-isolated intervals. Variations in the geochemistry o f the sediments and pore fluids were also observed over this part o f the drilled interval, with apparent links to paleoenvironmenta l changes.  

At greater depths in the boreholes, older parts of the synrift sedimentary fill appear to be dominantly nonmarine. In the central gul f (Sites M0078 and M0079), the gulf appears to have been primaril y isolated during this earlier phase. Although extended intervals ar e devoid of microfossils, likely as a result of preservation (e.g., dissolution, scavenging, etc.), significant bioturbation was observed; therefore, the environmental conditions in these periods are les s clear. In the Alkyonides Gulf (Site M0080), the recovered synrif t sediments from earlier phases of basin development indicate bot h terrestrial and subaqueous conditions.  

Further postexpedition research and integration of micropaleontological, sedimentological, and geochemical observation s and analyses will be needed to more fully understand the comple x changes in paleoenvironment over the history of the Corinth rif t and how these relate to its tectonic and climatic evolution. Comparisons with other basins with varying paleoenvironments, such as th e Marmara Sea and Black Sea, will form part of this process. Th e Corinth rift cores will also provide a new, long Quaternary record o f Mediterranean-type climate in the region, complementing long records farther north in the southern Balkans–Greece, such as fro m Lake Ohrid, Lake Kopais, Lake Ioannina, Tenaghi Philippon (e.g., Tzedakis et al., 2009; Sadori et al., 2016), and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Sea.  

# Chronostratigraphy  

One of the primary objectives of Expedition 381 was to obtai n age constraints on synrift sediments that can be used to quantif y rates of tectonic and sedimentary processes at high temporal resolution in this young and active rift. Shipboard characterization o f the recovered cores indicates that this objective will be achievabl e by using a suite of complementary dating and paleoenvironmental characterization methods, although this process will take time an d will be challenging. Shipboard analyses have already yielded important age constraints that will be greatly expanded by postexpedition research efforts.  

Shipboard  efforts  included  biostratigraphy,  magnetostratigraphy, and, less directly, identification of alternating basin conditions linked to past sea level fluctuations and glacial–interglacial cycles. Two key calcareous nannofossil markers were observed i n the sedimentary record of the most recent rifting phase: E. huxleyi (FO at $0.29\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and $P_{\star}$ lacunosa (LO at $0.43\,\mathrm{Ma}_{.}$ ). However, becaus e the basin alternates between marine and isolated conditions an d thus does not possess a continuous record of marine microfossils, interpreting these microfossil observations must be undertake n with care. Magnetostratigraphy provides baseline chronological tie s for the drilled section, including probable identification of th e Brunhes/Matuyama boundary at all sites and potential correlation s with other earlier chrons. With further postexpedition research, th e opportunity to identify excursions of the geomagnetic field and t o develop and correlate with the global RPI record should further improve the resolution of the chronostratigraphy. Finally, pinpointin g changes in basin paleoenvironment linked to glacial–interglacial cycles also provides indirect age constraints. These data indicat e that the most recent phase of rift deformation is late Quaternar y and that pre-expedition correlations with glacial–interglacial cycle s are broadly correct. The penultimate phase of rift deformation als o appears to be Quaternary in age, but further analysis is required t o pinpoint ages more precisely and to examine any spatial variation s in the extent of the rift history preserved in the gulf and sampled a t all three sites.  

The cores clearly contain a rich trove of material that can b e used to provide further age constraints. To develop a final ag e model for each site, shipboard results will be complemented by  a series of postexpedition research efforts, including radiocarbon dating of the youngest sediments, stable isotope analyses from the marine intervals, magnetic RPI, and tephrochronology. The results wil l be crucial for studies of rift evolution, sedimentary processes, an d paleoenvironment.  

# Structure and deformation  

The three drill sites were purposely located away from majo r seismic-scale faulting to maximize recovery of a complete stratigraphic sequence and to avoid the problems of drilling throug h faults. However, small-scale deformation, primarily compatibl e with the present-day extensional regime, was observed in the core d sequence at all three sites. Deformation tends to be more commo n with depth, probably reflecting the syntectonic nature of the sedimentary sequence. Fault structures are most common in the deepe r part of Site M0080 in the Alkyonides Gulf of the eastern Corint h rift. This part of the rift is experiencing the lowest current rates o f extension; the increased level of faulting may be a function of th e probable longer sedimentary record captured here. Although normal faulting dominates the core-scale deformation, the presence o f a wider range of structures hints at a more complex stress field i n the past. Quantification of the core structures and comparison wit h the seismic-scale structures imaged throughout the extensive seismic reflection network will contribute toward characterizing th e extent of subseismic strain in an active rift environment. This is a n elusive parameter of significance for calculating a reliable estimat e of strain and estimating the integrity of petroleum reservoirs an d traps.  

# Rift evolution  

Much of the analysis to address the Expedition 381 objectives o n rift evolution will result from postexpedition research. Postexpedition analyses will build on the shipboard analyses to build a highresolution chronology for the synrift sequence sampled (e.g., biostratigraphy,  tephrochronology,  magnetostratigraphy,  magneti c RPI, radiocarbon, and stable and radiogenic isotopes). CLSI will enable correlation of the drill cores with the extensive seismic data set, in particular increasing the precision of seismic reflector ties an d time-depth conversion. These new data sets will be used to provid e considerably improved constraints on ages of synrift seismic stratigraphic horizons, fault displacements, sediment thicknesses an d volumes, and the timing of major rift events. Thus, we will be abl e to determine rift fault activity and slip rates in space and time, including in the very recent past for the purposes of hazard assessment, the timing and rate of development of the rift fault network, and the longer term rift evolution, including discrete rift phases an d changes in rates of extension and subsidence. Analysis of the stratigraphic sequence, including sediment provenance and calculatio n of sediment fluxes in space and time, and its integration and correlation with the onshore elements of the rift sequence will allow fo r building a model of rift basin and sedimentary development. By tying these data with existing data and new data from drilling on th e regional paleoclimate and the paleoenvironment of the basin, th e relative roles of climate, tectonics, and sea level/water depth on sediment flux into the basin and the history of basin filling can be unraveled.  The  combined  drilling  data,  seismic  network,  an d preserved sequences onshore will provide a unique opportunity t o model the temporal and 3-D spatial tectonic and sedimentological development of a young rift basin.  

# Operations  

Each site was evaluated by the EPSP before the expedition, including assessment of the subsurface with the aid of seismic reflection  profiles  for  any  potential  hazards  to  drilling  operations. Following this assessment, all sites were approved for drilling.  

# Site M0078  

During Expedition 381, cores were recovered from two holes a t Site M0078 (Figures F1, F5). In total, 20.27 days were spent on station, with an average core recovery for the site of $90.4\%$ . Hol e M0078A was drilled to 610.43 mbsf, and Hole M0078B was drille d to 55.85 mbsf.  

In Hole M0078A, the WEP system was used to core the uppe r $75\;\mathrm{m}$ , and the Fugro Corer in push mode was used for the next 12 4 m, followed by the same corer in percussive mode for $25\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Th e FXMCB (rotary) was used to core the final $386\,\mathrm{m}$ of the borehole. I n Hole M0078B, the Fugro Corer in push mode was used throughout, to the base of the hole at 55.85 mbsf.  

# Transit to Hole M0078A  

The Fugro Synergy prepared to sail on the evening of 22 Octobe r 2017, with the vessel departing the Port of Corinth at $1955\,\mathrm{h}$ for th e first coring site. At $2130\,\mathrm{h},$ the Fugro Synergy arrived at Site M0078, and a dynamic positioning (DP) model was established. A referenc e beacon was deployed, and a sound velocity profile (SVP) was conducted. Water depth near Site M0078 varied from 859 to $864\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Coring operations  

At $0145~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 October 2017, the seabed frame (SBF) was deployed, and the drilling crew began running pipe. However, runnin g pipe took longer than anticipated due to rust at the joints resultin g in the need for a thorough cleaning prior to deployment.  

During the evening of 23 October, the first cores were recovere d with the first core on deck at $2135\,\mathrm{h}$ . The SEADEVIL (an addition t o the standard seabed template) was used to accurately spud in an d collect a seabed/water interface sample. The WEP system was lowered to approximately $10~\mathrm{cm}$ above the seabed and energized. Th e first core was $2.65~\mathrm{m}$ long. The next attempt at coring was unsuccessful, and the decision was made to wash through this interval. Following this, coring continued throughout 23 and 24 October, generally with high recovery rates. On 25 October, recovery gradually decreased, prompting a switch to the Fugro Corer in push mod e with flapper and finger catchers to optimize recovery. Initially, $3\;\mathrm{m}$ runs were conducted, but runs were extended to $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ on the evening of 25 October.  

At $2130~\mathrm{h},$ a communication issue arose with the SEADEVIL , leading to its recovery on deck at $0300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 October for assessment. Further investigation identified a printed circuit board fault, and the board was replaced. At $1415\mathrm{~h~}$ , the SEADEVIL was redeployed to the seabed, and the drill pipe was extended to the base o f the hole so that coring could recommence. The first core was recovered on deck at $1610\,\mathrm{h}$ . Coring paused briefly on 26 October to undertake  an  in  situ  temperature  cone  penetration  test  (CPT ) measurement at 100 mbsf; temperature CPT measurements wer e also taken close to 200 and 300 mbsf in Hole M0078A. Coring wit h the Fugro Corer continued for the remainder of 26 October throug h 28 October. At $0810\;\mathrm{h},$ core Run 60 made no advance, and the ru n was repeated at the same interval (core Run 61). A $2\,\mathrm{m}$ advance wa s achieved, but no core was returned. Next, a $4.5\;\mathrm{m}$ run (core Run 62 ) was conducted with good recovery.  

Recovery became more variable on 28 and 29 October, an d some runs returned no core. As a result, in the early hours of $29\,\mathrm{Oc}-$ tober it was decided to change to using the Fugro Corer in percussive mode. Despite this change, recovery continued to be highl y variable, and at $2130\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , the operational decision was made t o change from the Fugro Corer to the FXMCB system.  

Coring continued with good rates of advance and recovery fo r the next 3 days until a communications and power issue arose wit h the SEADEVIL, resulting in its recovery on deck at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 November for further assessment. It was concluded that this issue required a significant amount of time to resolve; therefore, it wa s agreed  that  coring  would  continue  without  the  use  of  th e SEADEVIL. From this point onward, the basic SBF was used fo r coring without the additional support of the SEADEVIL. Coring began again at $1645\,\mathrm{h}$ and progressed well to 7 November.  

On 7 November, coring operations were paused due to a sli p clamp becoming jammed around the drill string. The clamp wa s eventually released after approximately $7\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . Coring then recommenced and continued through 8 November (apart from $1\,\mathrm{~h~}$ o f downtime for lightning).  

On the morning of 9 November, drill floor maintenance was required to repair some disk springs on the FXMCB. At ${\sim}0545\,\mathrm{h},$ , a sli p clamp jammed around the drill string again and was not release d until $0710\ \mathrm{h},$ after which coring resumed. Coring paused again a t $1135\,\mathrm{h}$ when the FXMCB was recovered on deck to undergo repairs. At $1600\;\mathrm{h},$ coring resumed and progressed well through the morning of 10 November. At $1335~\mathrm{h},$ , the final core from Hole M0078 A was on deck with a total penetration of 610.43 mbsf.  

Throughout coring operations in Hole M0078A, seawater wa s used as the drilling medium, with the exception of four core run s where bentonite drilling mud was used to assist with hole conditioning (removal of cuttings and reducing any swelling of the borehole sidewall).  

Downhole logging operations in Hole M0078A commenced following coring and continued through 12 November. See Loggin g operations below for details.  

# Hole M0078B  

Following unsuccessful logging, the decision was made to bum p over by $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to drill a short ${}^{\iota}\mathrm{B}^{\prime\prime}$ hole to capture intervals of the upper $^{50\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ of stratigraphy that were not recovered from Hol e M0078A. Pipe was tripped, and the vessel moved $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south to th e new coordinates $38^{\circ}8^{\prime}41.144^{\prime\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\cdot}$ , $22^{\circ}45^{\prime}30.242^{\prime\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ).  

At midnight on 12 November 2017, the Fugro Synergy was settling on site. The first core was recovered at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ using the Fugr o Corer in push mode (a $1.31\;\mathrm{m}$ core capturing the seabed/water interface), and coring continued throughout the day with good recovery until $1640\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , when coring operations ended at 55.85 mbsf. Seawater was used as the drilling medium throughout coring operations in Hole M0078B. Following the completion of coring, trippin g pipe commenced, and the SBF was recovered on deck in preparation for transit to the port call. At $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 November, the Fugr o Synergy departed Site M0078 for the pilot station and was alongsid e and tied up by $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ at the Port of Corinth.  

# Logging operations  

The following wireline logging tools were planned for deployment in two depth stages: magnetic susceptibility and conductivit y (EM51), dual laterolog resistivity (DLL3), stacked natural gamm a ray (QL40SGR), sonic (QL40FWS), acoustic borehole televiewe r (QL40ABI), and spectral gamma ray (ASGR512).  

# Hole M0078A  

Following completion of coring in Hole M0078A on 10 November 2017, preparations were made for downhole logging. Hol e M0078A was stabilized with weighted bentonite mud, and then th e drill pipe was raised to 296.54 mbsf for the first phase of logging.  

Logging  with the magnetic  susceptibility and conductivit y (EM51) tool began at $_{0028}\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 11 November. The logging tools utilized for this expedition are super-slimline, and the tool strings ar e consequently relatively light. The light tool strings, coupled with th e density of the mud that was ultimately used to stabilize the borehole, made it difficult for the tool string to descend in the borehole. Due to concerns surrounding hole stability, it was necessary to circulate heavier mud $(8.5\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal})$ , which further impeded the descen t of the tool string. After several failed attempts to deploy the tool, additional weight $(\mathrm{{\sim}}15\;\mathrm{kg)}$ was clamped to the wireline cable abov e the tool to make it heavier. The weighted tool started its descen t more easily than before, but several losses of tension were observed, including at $297~\mathrm{m}$ WSF, the depth of the drill bit, and between 33 7 and $347\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. The total depth reached by the tool was $607\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, and logging up commenced at a speed of $22\;\mathrm{m/min}$ . The difficulties encountered during the descent, including repeated attempts to pass various tight spots, led to the logging cable becomin g entangled around the tool. As a result, $100\,\mathrm{m}$ of logging cable had t o be cut from the primary winch (GV550). Data acquired during thi s first run are not depth accurate, and owing to the nature of the measurement, the recorded signal is likely unreliable due to the cabl e entangled around the tool. Therefore, these data have not been processed.  

To save operational time, the backup winch (RG2200) was set u p and used for the remainder of logging operations in Hole M0078A. To address the issues encountered during the first run, a heavier, centralized stacked tool string including the stacked natural gamm a ray (QL40SGR), sonic (QL40FWS), and acoustic borehole televiewer (QL40ABI) tools was deployed. No difficulties were encountered during the descent in the drill pipe. However, the tool strin g could not pass through the bit into the open hole, presumably because of the passive bowspring centralizers. The tool string was recovered, and a longer, heavier tool string was deployed in its plac e without  the  bowspring  centralizers  and  with  the  QL40SGR, QL40FWS,  caliper  (QL40CAL),  and  magnetic  susceptibilit y (QL40MSUS) tools. This tool string successfully reached $607\,\textrm{m}$ WSF, and logging up started at $4~\mathrm{m/min}$ . Unfortunately, the tool string became stuck in the open hole $(356\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF})$ ) during its ascent. For $6\,\mathrm{h}$ , multiple attempts were made to free the tool string from th e borehole, with increasing load applied to the cable in a step-wis e fashion. Ultimately, it became clear that recovery of the tool strin g might not be possible, and the breaking load of the tool head wa s exceeded, resulting in the abandonment of the tool string in th e hole. Fishing operations were not attempted, and logging operation s in Hole M0078A were concluded at $1910\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 November.  

Data recorded during the final run indicate that the tool strin g became stuck on multiple occasions during its ascent, suggestin g that borehole conditions were likely deteriorating as logging operations progressed. Owing to the difficulties encountered, data are no t depth accurate, and the data quality is extremely poor.  

# Hole M0078B  

Due to the shallow penetration (55.85 mbsf) of Hole M0078B, i t was not logged.  

# Port call and transit to Hole M0079A  

On 13 November 2017 at $0630\,\mathrm{h},$ the Fugro Synergy made a por t call in the Port of Corinth to load equipment and supplies and for a n ESO and Fugro crew change. At $2020\,\mathrm{h}$ , the vessel departed the Por t of Corinth for Site M0079. At $2223\,\mathrm{h}$ , the vessel arrived on site an d began settling on DP. At $0210\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November, a reference beaco n was deployed, and an SVP was conducted to ascertain water dept h at the site.  

# Site M0079  

Upon arrival at Site M0079, a water depth of $857.1\;\mathrm{m}$ was established following an SVP. In total, 18 days were spent on station, wit h an average core recovery of $86.65\%$ . Drilling and coring in Hol e M0079A was completed to 704.9 mbsf using two tools in 14 days. The Fugro Corer in push mode collected the upper $67\textrm{m}$ of sediment, and the Fugro Corer in percussive mode collected the next 8 1 m. The FXMCB was then used to complete the lowermost $556\;\mathrm{m}$ o f the borehole. Logging operations in Hole M0079A were conducte d over 3 days.  

# Coring operations  

Lowering the SBF began at $0240~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 November 2017 an d was completed by $_{0410\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ . However, at $0515\,\mathrm{h}$ communications wer e lost to the SBF, which resulted in recovering it on deck for maintenance. At $0718\,\mathrm{h}$ , the bottom-hole assembly was recovered on deck, and the SBF was inspected in the moonpool then returned to th e seafloor. At $1709\mathrm{~h~}$ on 14 November, coring commenced in Hol e M0079A with the Fugro Corer in push mode. A seabed/water interface sample was collected by holding the Fugro Corer above th e mudline, and $^{1\textrm{m}}$ of penetration was achieved, collecting $_{0.9\textrm{m}}$ o f sediment.  

Coring continued throughout the morning of 15 November until the Fugro Corer became stuck during a core run at $1045~\mathrm{h}$ . Unsuccessful fishing attempts were made, therefore requiring trippin g the pipe to recover the tool at $2209\,\mathrm{h}$ . Running pipe in the hole began at $0435~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 November, and coring resumed at $1259\mathrm{~h~}$ A t $2223\,\mathrm{h}$ , there was a brief pause in coring to undertake an in situ temperature CPT measurement at 100 mbsf.  

Coring continued through 17 November using the Fugro Core r alternating between percussive and push mode. On the evening o f 17 November, the operational decision was made to switch to th e rotary coring method (FXMCB) because recovery had dropped du e to the ground conditions becoming firmer. From 18 to 23 November, coring progressed well with short pauses for high winds an d three further temperature CPT measurements every ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ t o ${\sim}400$ mbsf.  

At $0305\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 November, repairs to the core barrel head wer e required, and coring resumed at $0700~\mathrm{h}$ . As with Hole M0078A, i t was found that penetrating to the full $5\,\mathrm{m}$ of the FXMCB barrel an d recovering high percentages of samples was difficult at times. It appears there may have been insufficient flush at the bit to lubricat e material being cored. Combined with the expanding nature of som e of the intervals, this insufficient flush apparently caused the core t o compress the liner, pushing it up the core barrel and creating a ga p at the bottom that allowed a section of core to expand into the gap, making it too large to enter the liner. This effectively blocked th e liner, causing the remaining material to not be taken or a shorte r core run to be completed. Coring progressed well until the terminal depth of the hole (704.9 mbsf) was achieved at $0045~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 November.  

Generally, seawater was used as the drilling medium, with th e occasional use of bentonite drilling mud to assist with hole conditioning (removal of cuttings and reducing any swelling of the borehole sidewall), although bentonite was used for short runs earlier i n Hole M0079A.  

# Logging operations  

In preparation for logging, Hole M0079A was stabilized via displacement with weighted bentonite mud $\mathrm{(8.9\;lb/gal)}$ . Following th e loss of a tool string in Hole M0078A, only standalone tools wer e available and used, and they were systematically run with a sinke r bar fitted above the tool to help its descent. The planned loggin g program for Hole M0079A was to start logging the entire borehol e through pipe with the spectral gamma ray (ASGR512) tool and the n log in the open hole in three depth stages (475–705 [base of th e hole], 220–475, and 50–195 mbsf) using the following tools: magnetic susceptibility and conductivity (EM51), sonic (2PSA-1000), and dual induction (DIL45). Depths of the stages changed durin g logging operations.  

Hole M0079A logging operations started on 29 November 201 7 at $0345\,\mathrm{h},$ with the drill bit at $699.5\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloo r (DSF) (close to the bottom of the hole) to log with the spectral gamma ray (ASGR512) tool through the pipe. The ASGR512 tool did not encounter any difficulty going down through the bentonit e mud and in the pipe; it passed the drill bit to reach the bottom of th e hole, and logging up started. After recovery of the tool, the drill bi t was pulled up to $500\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF to start logging in the open hole for th e first depth stage ( $500{-}705\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF). Bentonite mud $(9\ \mathrm{lb/gal})$ wa s circulated to stabilize the hole. Multiple attempts were made t o send the magnetic susceptibility and conductivity (EM51) tool down the hole, but the tension meter of the winch (GV550) appeared to be damaged. The fault could not be identified, so it wa s decided to use the backup winch (RG2200) and to move to the second depth stage $220{-}500\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF). Bentonite mud was recirculated, and the drill bit was pulled up to $220\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF. The EM51 tool wa s deployed successfully and passed the drill bit, but a loss of tensio n was observed at $297\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. After multiple attempts to pass thi s obstruction, it was decided to start logging up from this depth an d to move to the next depth stage $:50{-}220\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF). The EM51 tool was recovered, the drill bit was pulled up to $50\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and bentonite mud $\mathrm{(9\1b/gal)}$ was circulated. The EM51 tool was deploye d without any problem and reached $230\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ to allow ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ o f overlap with the data collected during the previous stage. Loggin g up started, the tool was recovered, and the sonic (2PSA-1000) tool was sent for the second run in this depth interval. The tool reache d $230\ \mathrm{m}$ WSF, and no attempts were made to go deeper because th e tool is fragile and deeper borehole conditions were not known. Dat a acquisition uphole was done and then the tool was recovered o n deck. Following this run, the dual laterolog resistivity (DLL3) tool was sent instead of the dual induction (DIL45) tool because communication problems were observed with the latter during preparations on deck. The DLL3 tool was deployed successfully an d reached $290\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF, just above the obstruction encountered durin g the second depth stage. Data acquisition uphole started, and th e tool was recovered safely to terminate logging operations at Sit e $_{M0079}$ , with rigging down completed at $1740\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 December.  

After logging operations were completed, pulling pipe and recovering the SBF and DP transponder was completed by $2325\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 1 December. At $2340\,\mathrm{h}$ , transit to Site M0080 began.  

# Transit to Site M0080  

Transit to Site M0080 began in the early hours of 2 Decembe r 2017. While in transit, four surface seawater samples were collected.  

# Site M0080  

Drilling and coring in Hole M0080A was completed to 534. 1 mbsf in 13 days, achieving an $84\%$ recovery rate. The Fugro Corer i n both push and percussive modes collected the upper $141~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. The FXMCB was used to complete the lower $390\mathrm{~m~}$ of th e borehole. Wireline logging operations were then conducted over  2 days.  

# Coring operations  

During the positioning process for Hole M0080A on 2 December 2017, the SBF and pipe were lowered to within $50\;\mathrm{m}$ of the seafloor. After positioning was complete, the SBF and pipe wer e lowered, and coring commenced using the Fugro Corer in pus h mode. A seabed/water interface sample was collected. The core r was dropped through the drill string in free fall and penetrated 1. 5 m with a recovery of $1.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. Coring continued uninterrupted for the rest of 2 December and throughout 3 December, wit h exceptional progress being made at a rate of ${>}100\ \mathrm{m}$ /day. A switc h to the Fugro Corer percussive mode occurred at 84 mbsf. The abilit y to alternate between push and percussive modes without switchin g to the rotary method (FXMCB) enabled nonrotary coring to greate r depths than would have otherwise been possible. A temperatur e CPT measurement was made at close to 100 mbsf to acquire in sit u temperature and friction/strength information of the formation, and a second temperature CPT measurement was taken close t o 210 mbsf. The change to the FXMCB was made on the evening of  3 December when the efficacy of the Fugro Corer had dropped an d the sediments were deemed firm enough to withstand the effects o f rotary coring. Following the switch to the FXMCB, coring continued at a very high rate until the morning of 5 December. At tha t time, the ground conditions became considerably more challenging, with mixed beds of sands and gravels, resulting in a slowing of th e rate of advance to $29.6\:\mathrm{m},$ /day. These slow rates continued and worsened until the end of 12 December, with the lowest advance of 20. 0 m/day in Hole M0080A on 9 December. Coring continued uninterrupted during this period.  

The rate of advance improved significantly throughout 12 an d 13 December, with $85.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of advance, due to favorable ground conditions. The drilling rate slowed once more on 14 December as conditions became more challenging.  

The final core from Hole M0080A was recovered at $_{0330\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 1 5 December, achieving a final depth of 534.1 mbsf. Despite a smal l number of discrete areas where recovery was low, Hole M0080 A achieved good recovery $(84\%)$ . The borehole was cored $65\,\mathrm{m}$ deepe r than anticipated because the scientific goal for this borehole (basement) was deeper than the initial estimated target depth. Basemen t sensu stricto was not reached; however, the deepest cores recovere d very coarse grained conglomerates thought to immediately overli e basement.  

In general, seawater was used as the drilling medium; however , bentonite was used for core Runs 64–103 and 127–146.  

# Logging operations  

In preparation for logging, Hole M0080A was stabilized via displacement with weighted bentonite mud $\mathrm{(8.8\1b/gal)}$ . Standalon e tools were used to address the scientific objectives, and they wer e systematically run with a sinker bar fitted above each tool to help it s descent. Logging the hole started through the pipe with the spectral gamma ray (ASGR512) tool and then continued in three dept h stages where the following tools were planned to be deployed in th e open hole: magnetic susceptibility and conductivity (EM51), soni c (2PSA-1000), dual induction (DIL45), and ASGR512.  

All tools were run with the primary winch (GV550). Hol e M0080A logging started on 15 December 2017 at $0330~\mathrm{h}$ with th e drill bit pulled up to $533.1\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{DSF}$ (just above the base of the hole) t o log through the pipe. The spectral gamma ray (ASGR512) tool di d not encounter any difficulty going down through the bentonite mu d and in the pipe; it passed the drill bit to reach the bottom of th e hole, and logging up started. After recovery of the ASGR512 tool, the drill bit was pulled up to $365\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF to log in the open hole fo r the first depth stage (365–533 m DSF). Bentonite mud $\mathrm{(8.8\lb/gal)}$ was circulated to stabilize the hole. The magnetic susceptibility an d conductivity (EM51) tool was deployed and passed the drill bit, bu t difficulties were encountered in the open hole from 410 to $425\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, with several losses of tension. After borehole conditions prevented the tool from passing beyond $425\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, data were collected from this depth to the drill bit and the tool was recovered o n deck to perform a wiper trip downhole. The drill string was lowere d to the bottom of the hole and then pulled up to $430\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ to avoi d the interval where losses of tension were observed during the previous run. The EM51 and sonic (2PSA-1000) tools were run successfully, reaching a maximum depth of ${\sim}530\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF and collectin g data from this depth to the drill bit at $430\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. However, whe n deploying the ASGR512 tool, the tool could not continue its descen t beyond ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ below the drill bit. The decision was made to mov e to the next depth stage, and the drill bit was lowered to $460\;\mathrm{m}$ DS F to clean the borehole walls and then pulled to $230\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF for th e second depth stage. In this depth interval, the EM51 tool was ru n down the hole but could not pass beyond ${\sim}430~\mathrm{m}$ WSF. Data wer e collected with the EM51 tool from 430 to $230\ \mathrm{m}$ WSF. The 2PSA1000 tool was deployed but could not pass beyond ${\sim}370\mathrm{~m~WSF}_{1}$ ; therefore, data were collected up from this depth to the drill bit a t $230\textrm{m}$ DSF. After recovery of the 2PSA-1000 tool, the dual induction (DIL45) tool and then the ASGR512 tool were deployed successfully in a similar depth range, collecting data from 370 to $^{230}\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF. The third and last depth stage was conducted after the drill bi t had been pulled up to $50~\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and the bentonite present in th e borehole was displaced with seawater. This change in fluid wa s aimed at better stabilizing the borehole for the expected lithologie s in this shallow interval. Once deployed, the first tool (EM51) coul d not pass beyond ${\sim}220\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF downhole. The EM51, 2PSA-1000, DIL45, and ASGR512 tools were all deployed with data acquisitio n from ${\sim}220$ to $50\,\textrm{m}$ WSF. Logging operations were completed a t $1235\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 December.  

# Demobilization  

Following  the  completion  of  logging  operations  in  Hol e M0080A, the ESO team continued with demobilizing the containerized laboratories and offices. All operations ceased at $1235\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 7 December 2017, and the Fugro Synergy drill team tripped out of th e hole. Transit to Corinth took place overnight, with the Fugro Synergy arriving dockside at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December.  

# Outreach and communication  

The overall aim of the ESO Outreach and Education effort is t o promote the benefits of each expedition’s science and the wider objectives of IODP/ECORD to a broad audience, including the scienc e community and public. To accomplish this objective, we focused o n publicizing the expedition’s aims and findings to international media  and  concentrated  on  media  networks  developed  in  th e IODP/ECORD community and members of the science party’s organizations.  

Targeted activities in support of the outreach and communication objectives included the following:  

• The expedition web page on the ECORD website, which acts as a source of information by including Ship Reports and blogs, includes links to expedition materials and a media pack with information about press conferences and media releases along with pictures and contact details to arrange interviews with the expedition scientists.   
• Expedition promotional materials, including an expedition logo, flier (in English), and branded items such as caps, T-shirts, iron on patches, and mugs were available for the science party members, ESO staff, and ship’s crew.   
• Banners with IODP and ECORD logos and the expedition logo were available to display on the side of the Fugro Synergy and serve as a backdrop for interviews and pictures. Widespread use of logos ensures recognition in photographs/videos.   
• Contact was made with media officers at the science party member’s universities to raise awareness of their staff’s participation in the expedition and to enlist their support in promoting the expedition locally and nationally.   
• A media day was held at the start of the expedition on 19 October 2017 at the Alexandreio Conference Centre in Loutraki, Greece. Professor Lisa McNeill, Professor Donna Shillington (Co-Chief Scientists), and Gareth Carter (ESO, Expedition Project Manager) presented logistics and expedition objectives. Afterward, a visit on board the Fugro Synergy took place. The event was attended by a TV team from Athens (Skai TV) and by Greek scientist collaborators on the project. After the media day, a local TV team visited the vessel (Hlektra TV). Prior to the expedition, there was a news feature in one of the main German language newspapers in Europe.   
• For the on board media day, an embargoed press release was issued to IODP/ECORD representatives, media departments of the participants, Greek media, and international media. Over 20 news articles covered the project, particularly in the Corinth region of Greece.   
• Education officer Martin Böttcher (education officer and teacher) visited the Fugro Synergy at the Port in Corinth before the offshore phase of expedition and then visited the University of Bremen during the OSP. He hosted a ship-to-shore event with the Rabanus-Maurus-Schule in Fulda, Germany, and wrote two blog stories about the expedition.   
• Several ship-to-shore events were broadcast, including to staff and students at the University of Athens, hosted locally by science party member Katerina Kouli, and to the science party of the R/V JOIDES Resolution in transit to New Zealand during IODP Expedition 372.   
• A video tour and scientific presentation was recorded for the UK Natural Environment Research Council Showcase “Unearthed” Exhibition at Our Dynamic Earth (Edinburgh UK). This event was visited by over 7000 members of the public.   
• Video footage was recorded about life and scientific objectives on board the research vessel, including short interviews, core flow offshore, and aerial video of the Fugro Synergy recorded by UAV drone. All clips are published on the ECORD/ESO YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/user/ECORDESO).   
• A second media event was held during the OSP on 22 February 2018 at MARUM and featured short presentations by the CoChief Scientists followed by interviews and a tour of the laboratory facilities and core repository. The event was attended by representatives from regional and national media and reported nationally in printed and online media.   
• A second press release was issued on 5 March, which was picked up by universities and institutions that published individual versions that resulted in features by various international media.   
• Regular promotion of the expedition’s accomplishments onshore and offshore were posted on ECORD’s social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook (summary statistics unavailable), and YouTube (2000 views plus reposts to Facebook and Twitter).   
• An expedition blog (https://esoexp381corinthactiveriftdevelopment.wordpress.com) was maintained throughout the expedition (onshore and offshore) and included regular updates from all phases of the expedition. Between the start of the offshore phase and the end of the OSP, the blog site had been visited over 21,200 times.   
• During the OSP in Bremen, short video clips of the core flow were produced, as well as audio recordings and pictures to be published in due course. They supplement the series of offshore videos that have already been uploaded on the ECORD/ESO YouTube channel.

Figure F8. Site M0078 summary. Estimated age. Seismic reflection data crossing site location from Taylor et al. (2011). Lithostratigraphic units and Unit 1 subunits with paleoenvironment: blue $=$ marine, green $=$ isolated/semi-isolated, gray $=$ undetermined. Lithology/facies associations (FAs) are from lithostratigraphic interpretations (facies associations are grouped for simplicity and coarser sediment layers are highlighted by longer bars); see Table T3 for descriptio n of facies associations. MSCL magnetic susceptibility (MS), natural gamma ray (NGR), and density data are from whole cores. MAD bulk density data are fro m discrete core samples. cps $=$ counts per second.
