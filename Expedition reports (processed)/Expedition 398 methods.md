# 1. Operations  

This section provides an overview of operations, depth conventions, core handling, curatoria l procedures, and analyses performed on the R/V JOIDES Resolution during International Ocea n Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 398, Hellenic Arc Volcanic Field. This information applie s only to shipboard work described in the Expedition reports section of the Expedition 398 Proceedings of the $I O D P$ volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of Expeditio n 398 data will be described in separate individual postcruise research publications.  

# 1.1. Site locations  

Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates (WGS84 datum) from precruise site surveys wer e used to position the vessel at Expedition 398 sites. A SyQwest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloor depth during the approach to each site and to confirm the seafloor depth once on site. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters were lowered. Dynamic positioning control of the vessel primarily used navigational input from the GPS (Figur e F1). The final hole position is the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over  a significant portion of the time during which the hole was occupied.  

# 1.2. Drilling operations  

The advanced piston corer (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), extended core barrel (XCB), an d rotary core barrel (RCB) systems were all used during Expedition 398 (Figures F2, F3, F4). Thes e tools and other drilling technology are documented in Graber et al. (2002). The APC and HLAP C systems cut soft-sediment cores with minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP corin g systems. After the APC/HLAPC core barrel is lowered through the drill pipe and lands above th e bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until the two shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to th e outer barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation and cuts the core (Figure F2). The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke,” by observing the pressure gauge on the ri g floor because the excess pressure accumulated prior to the stroke drops rapidly.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in one of two ways: (1) the piston fails to achieve a complet e stroke (as determined from the pump pressure and recovery reading) because the formation is to o hard, or (2) excessive force “overpull” $^{\prime}{>}60{,}000$ lb) is required to pull the core barrel out of th e formation. For APC cores that do not achieve a full stroke, the next core can be taken after advancing to a depth determined by the recovery of the previous core (i.e., advance by recovery) or to th e depth of a full APC core (typically $9.5\mathrm{~m}]$ ). When a full stroke is not achieved, one or more additional attempts are typically made, and each time the bit is advanced by the length of the cor e recovered (note that for these cores, this results in a nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ ). When a full o r partial stroke is achieved but excessive force is not able to retrieve the barrel, the core barrel can b e “drilled over,” meaning that after the inner core barrel is successfully shot into the formation, th e drill bit is advanced to total depth to free the APC barrel.

The standard APC system uses a $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, whereas the HLAPC system uses a $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, the HLAPC system is deployed after the standard APC syste m has repeated partial strokes and/or the core liners are damaged. During use of the HLAPC system, the same criteria are applied in terms of refusal as for the APC system. Use of the HLAPC syste m allowed for significantly greater APC sampling depths to be attained than would have otherwis e been possible.  

The XCB system is typically used when the APC/HLAPC system has difficulty penetrating th e formation and/or damages the core liner or core. The XCB system can also be used either to initiate holes where the seafloor is not suitable (e.g., Site U1599) for APC coring or be interchange d with the APC/HLAPC system when dictated by changing formation conditions. The XCB syste m is used to advance the hole when HLAPC refusal occurs before the target depth is reached or whe n drilling conditions require it. The XCB system is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe tha t extends below the large rotary APC/XCB bit (Figure F3). The smaller bit can cut a semi-indurate d core with less torque and fluid circulation than the main bit, potentially improving recovery. Th e XCB cutting shoe typically extends ${\sim}30.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediments, but a sprin g allows it to retract into the main bit when hard formations are encountered. Shorter XCB cuttin g shoes can also be used.  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) used for APC/XCB coring is typically composed of an $11\%$ inch $({\sim}29.05\;\mathrm{cm})$ roller cone drill bit, a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered drill collar, tw o stands of $5\%$ inch transition drill pipe, and a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extends to th e surface.  

The RCB system is a rotary system designed to recover firm to hard sediments and basemen t rocks. The BHA, including the bit and outer core barrel, is rotated with the drill string while bearings allow the inner core barrel to remain stationary (Figure F4).  

A typical RCB BHA includes a $9\%$ inch drill bit, a bit sub, an outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, a variable number of $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered drill collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe, and a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extends to the surface.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used only at Sites U1589 and U1590 and Hole U1591A for APC, HLAPC, and RCB coring. APC cores were oriented with the Icefield MI-5 core orientation too l when coring conditions allowed. Formation temperature measurements were taken with th e advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool (see Downhole temperature measurements). Information on recovered cores, drilled intervals, downhole tool deployments, and related information are provided in the Operations, Paleomagnetism, and Downhole measurements section s of each site chapter. Having severed the drill string at Sites U1589 and U1590 and becoming stuc k in Hole U1591A, the decision was made to assemble and run simplified BHAs from Hole U1591 B forward. These BHAs had no tapered collars, no nonmagnetic collars, and no Icefield MI-5 cor e orientation tool. In addition, temperature measurements were discontinued.  

# 1.3. IODP depth conventions  

The primary depth scales used by IODP are based on the measurement of the following:  

• The drill string length deployed beneath the rig floor (drilling depth below rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]),   
• The length of core recovered (core depth below seafloor [CSF] and core composite depth below seafloor [CCSF]), and   
• The length of logging wireline deployed (wireline log depth below rig floor [WRF], wireline log depth below seafloor [WSF], and wireline log matched depth below seafloor [WMSF]).  

All depths are in meters. The relationship between scales is defined either by protocol, such a s the rules for computation of CSF depths from DSF depths, or by combinations of protocols wit h user-defined correlations (e.g., CCSF scale). The distinction in nomenclature should keep th e user  aware that a nominal depth value in two different depth scales usually does not refer t o exactly   the   same  stratigraphic  interval  (see  Curatorial  procedures  and  sample  dept h calculations). For more information on depth scales, see IODP Depth Scales Terminology a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines. To more easily communicate shipboard results, CSF, Method A (CSF-A), depths in this volume are reported as meters below seafloor (mbsf ) unless otherwise noted.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the rig floor based on the length of drill pip e deployed beneath the rig floor (DRF scale; Figure F1). The depth of the cored interval is reference d to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth of the hole from the DRF depth of th e interval. Standard depths of cores in meters below seafloor (CSF-A scale) are determined based o n the assumption that the top depth of a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of its core d interval (DSF scale). Standard depths of samples and associated measurements (CSF-A scale) ar e calculated by adding the offset of the sample or measurement from the top of its section and th e lengths of all higher sections in the core to the top depth of the core.  

If a core has ${<}100\%$ recovery, for curation purposes all cored material is assumed to originate fro m the top of the drilled interval as a continuous section. In addition, voids in the core are closed b y pushing core segments together, if possible, during core handling. If the core pieces cannot b e pushed together to eliminate the voids, then foam spacers are inserted and clearly labeled “void. ” Therefore, the true depth interval within the cored interval is only partially constrained. Thi s should be considered a sampling uncertainty in age-depth analysis or correlation of core data wit h downhole logging data.  

When core recovery is ${>}100\%$ (i.e., the length of the recovered core exceeds that of the cored interval), the CSF-A depth of a sample or measurement taken from the bottom of a core will be deepe r than that of a sample or measurement taken from the top of the subsequent core (i.e., the dat a associated with the two core intervals overlap at the CSF-A scale). This overlap can happen whe n a soft to semisoft sediment core recovered from a few hundred meters below seafloor expand s upon recovery (typically by a few percent to as much as $15\%$ ). Therefore, a stratigraphic interva l may not have the same nominal depth on the DSF and CSF-A scales in the same hole.  

# 1.4. Curatorial procedures and sample depth calculations  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples followed standard IODP procedure (Figure F1).  A full curatorial identifier for a sample consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, section half, piece number (hard rocks only), and interva l in centimeters measured from the top of the core section. For example, a sample identification o f “398-U1589A-2H-5W, $80{-}85\,\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{;}}$ ,” indicates a $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ sample removed from the interval between 8 0 and $85\;\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 5 (working half) of Core 2 ( $\ ^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^{\prime}$ designates that this core wa s taken with the APC system) of Hole A at Site U1589 during Expedition 398 (Figure F1). The “U ” preceding the hole number indicates the hole was drilled by the US IODP platform, JOIDES Resolution. The drilling system used to obtain a core is designated in the sample identifiers as follows:  

${\mathrm{H}}={\mathrm{APC}}.$ $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{HLAPC}.$ ${\mathrm{R}}={\mathrm{RCB}}$ . $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{XCB}$ .  

Integers are used to denote the core type of drilled intervals (e.g., a drilled interval between Core s 2H and 4H would be denoted by Core 31).  

# 1.5. Core handling and analysis  

The overall flow of cores, sections, analyses, and sampling implemented during Expedition 398 i s shown in Figure F5.  

# 1.6. Sediment  

When the core barrel reached the rig floor, the core catcher (CC) from the bottom of the core wa s removed and taken to the core receiving platform (i.e., the catwalk), and a sample was extracted fo r paleontological (PAL) analysis. Next, the sediment core was extracted from the core barrel in it s plastic liner. The liner was carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwal k outside the core laboratory, where it was cut into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections. If the core material was to o soupy and sloshed within the core liner, decantation was achieved either by compressing the sediment and draining off the seawater or by vertical density segregation. Blue (uphole direction) an d clear (downhole direction) liner caps were glued with acetone onto the cut liner sections.  

Once the core was cut into sections, whole-round samples were taken for interstitial water (IW ) chemical and microbiological analyses. When a whole-round sample was removed, a yellow ca p was used to indicate it was taken. Syringe samples were taken for gas analyses according to th e IODP hydrocarbon safety monitoring protocol. Syringe and whole-round samples were taken fo r microbiology culturing and postcruise analyses.  

The core sections were placed in a core rack in the laboratory, core information was entered int o the database, and the sections were labeled. When the core sections reached equilibrium with laboratory temperature (typically after $4~\mathrm{{h}}$ ), they were run through the Whole-Round Multisenso r Logger (WRMSL) for $P.$ -wave velocity, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and gamma ray attenuatio n (GRA) bulk density (see Physical properties). The core sections were also run through the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL), often prior to temperature equilibration because that doe s not affect the natural gamma radiation (NGR) data, and thermal conductivity measurements wer e taken once per core when the material was suitable.  

The core sections were then split lengthwise from bottom to top into working and archive halves. Investigators should note that older material can be transported upward on the split face of eac h section during splitting.  

Discrete samples were then taken for moisture and density (MAD) and paleomagnetic (PMAG ) analyses and for remaining shipboard analyses such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), carbonat e (CARB), and inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Samples wer e not collected when the lithology was a high priority interval for expedition or postcruise research, the core material was unsuitable, or the core was severely deformed. During the expedition, samples for personal postcruise research were only taken in the form of a limited number of persona l or shared “pilot” samples for three reasons: (1) to determine whether an analytical method work s and yields interpretable results and how much sample is needed to guide postcruise sampling, (2) to generate low spatial resolution pilot data sets that can be incorporated in proposals an d potentially increase chances of being funded, and (3) to generate early results to help with hig h impact publications before the Expedition 398 sampling party.

The archive half of each core was scanned on the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) to provid e linescan images, and then it was measured for point magnetic susceptibility (MSP) and reflectanc e spectroscopy and colorimetry (RSC) on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). Labele d foam pieces were used to denote missing whole-round intervals in the SHIL images. The archiv e halves were then described visually and by means of smear slides for sedimentology. Finally, th e magnetization of archive halves and working-half discrete pieces was measured with the cryogeni c magnetometer and spinner magnetometer.  

When all steps were completed, cores were wrapped, sealed in plastic tubes, and transferred to the cold storage space aboard the ship. At the end of the expedition, the working halves of the core s were sent to the IODP Bremen Core Repository (Center for Marine Environmental Science s [MARUM], Bremen, Germany), where samples for postcruise research were taken in July 2023. The archive halves of the cores were first sent to the IODP Gulf Coast Repository (Texas A& M University, College Station, Texas, USA), where a subset was analyzed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning before being forwarded to the Bremen Core Repository for long-term archive.  

# 1.7. Drilling and handling core disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed and contain extraneous material as a result of the coring an d core handling process (Jutzeler et al., 2014). For example, in formations with loose lapilli pumice, clasts from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down by drilling circulation, accumulate a t the bottom of the hole, and be sampled with the next core. The uppermost $10{-}50\;\mathrm{cm}$ of each cor e must therefore be examined critically during description for potential “fall-in.” Common coringinduced deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Piston action can result in liquefaction (i.e., “flow-in”) at the bottom of APC cores and/o r especially when coarse loose material is penetrated, as well as disruption and shearing of the cor e material and subsequent midcore flow-in. The rotation and fluid circulation used during XCB an d RCB coring can also cause core pieces to rotate relative to each other as well as introduce fluid s into the core and/or cause liquefaction and remobilization of poorly consolidated/cemented sediments. In addition, extending APC or HLAPC coring into deeper, firmer formations can als o induce core deformation. Retrieval from depth to the surface can result in elastic rebound. Ga s that is in solution at depth may exsolve and drive apart core segments in the liner. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the liner, which forces some sediment as well as gas ou t of the liner. These disturbances are described in each site chapter and graphically indicated on th e visual core descriptions (VCDs).  

# 2. Lithostratigraphy  

This section outlines procedures used to document the composition, texture, and structures of th e volcanic, tuffaceous, and nonvolcanic sediments and sedimentary rocks recovered during Expedition 398. The procedures include VCD, smear slide and petrographic thin section analysis, digita l color imaging, color spectrophotometry, and XRD.  

Cores were split into working and archive halves, with sedimentologic and petrographic observations described on the archive halves. Soft-sediment cores were split with a wire, and lithifie d cores were split with a diamond-impregnated saw. The exposed surface of the archive half wa s evaluated for quality (e.g., smearing or surface unevenness) and, if necessary, gently scraped perpendicular to the core with a glass or stainless-steel slide to ensure a smooth, uncontaminate d surface. After splitting, the archive half was imaged on the SHIL and then analyzed for colo r reflectance and MS using the SHMSL (see Physical properties). The archive-half sections were i n some cases reimaged when visibility of sedimentary structures or fabrics improved followin g treatment of the split core surface.  

Following imaging, the archive-half sections of the sediment cores were macroscopicall y described for lithologic and sedimentary features aided by use of a $20\times$ wide-field hand lens,  a binocular microscope, and $10\%$ and $20\%$ HCl solutions. Based on preliminary observations, toothpick samples from the archive-half sections were used to make smear slides, whereas thin section s and XRD samples were taken from the working-half sections. Lithostratigraphic units wer e defined following visual inspection, assisted by smear slide analysis; XRD analysis; and, where useful, thin section analysis, as well as physical properties.  

Visual inspection of volcanic, tuffaceous, and nonvolcanic sediments and their lithified equivalents (e.g., tuff, mudstone, sandstone, marl, limestone) yielded macroscopic information such a s sedimentary structures, lithologic variation, clast componentry, color, contacts, and core disturbance (e.g., drilling or tectonic disturbances; see Structural geology), whereas smear slide, thi n section (i.e., microscopic), and XRD analyses were used to better identify volcanic, tuffaceous, an d nonvolcanic sedimentary constituents including clasts, minerals, glass, and microfossils. Igneou s rocks were found only as clasts in sediments or sedimentary rocks and were characterized macroscopically only as volcanic or plutonic. Varied types of metamorphic rocks were found as clasts i n sediments, whereas metamorphic rocks from the basement consisted of marble or peridotite. Where applicable, thin sections of selected descriptive intervals and clasts provided more detail o n mineralogy, variations in primary and secondary mineralogy, and the texture of these rocks. Th e descriptive data were entered into the GEODESC application (see GEODESC for details). Al l descriptions and sample locations were recorded using curated depths and documented on VC D graphic reports (e.g., Figure F6).  

# 2.1. GEODESC  

Data for the macroscopic and microscopic (i.e., smear slide and thin section) descriptions o f recovered cores were entered into the IODP descriptive database using the IODP applicatio n GEODESC. GEODESC is description software that stores macroscopic and/or microscopi c descriptions of cores. Data were entered into GEODESC through templates specific to differen t lithologies (i.e., sediments, intrusive igneous rocks, extrusive igneous rocks, and metamorphi c rocks) for both macroscopic and microscopic observations. Core description data are availabl e through LIMS Reports - Descriptive Information (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/DESCReport).  A single row in GEODESC defines one descriptive interval, where the material in that interval ha s similar characteristics with no major visual breaks. In volcanic sedimentary environments, a n interval is commonly related to an eruptive or depositional event that punctuates backgroun d sedimentation intervals (Table T1).  

This expedition collected volcanic material that was deposited by multiple possible processes (e.g., air fall, pyroclastic density current, turbidity current, debris flow, and so on) and as such are sediments and sedimentary rocks. The descriptive protocol employed during this expedition is rigorously nongenetic and integrates volcanic particles into GEODESC’s sedimentary descriptiv e schemes. As such, we have followed but adapted the methods used during Expeditions 350 an d 376 (Tamura et al., 2015; de Ronde et al., 2019)  

A capability in the new rollout of GEODESC is that multiselection lists allow multiple characteristics to be listed within one column, separated by commas in the output files. This feature wa s particularly useful for Expedition 398 because it allows for easy identification of multiple types o f lithic clasts, glass shards, and crystals in volcanic lithologies for which no further description i s needed. The order of selection in the multiselection list can be used to order the components i n the output list by abundance. The same is true for alteration features.  

The position of each smear slide or petrographic thin section is shown in the VCDs with a sampl e code of “SED” or “TS,” respectively.  

# 2.2. Core disturbance  

The coring and core handling processes may induce various types of core disturbance (Jutzeler e t al., 2014), affecting our ability to recognize and describe original sedimentary and tectonic structures. The severity of core disturbance was rated as slight, moderate, severe, or destroyed, depending on the intensity of disturbance. Common types of core disturbance are described below:

• Fall-in core disturbance in unconsolidated units (e.g., ash, lapilli-ash, and lapilli) occurs when granular material from the top of the hole may fall in and accumulate at the bottom until the next core is recovered. As a result, fall-in material may reoccur in the uppermost part of the recovery of the next core, and original lithofacies and sedimentary structures are not present in these intervals. Thus, the uppermost part of each core section must be examined critically during description for potential fall-in (Figure F7A).   
• Up- and downarching core disturbance results from slight to moderate coring-induced shear between the sediment and core liner and is recognized from bedding uniformly dragged downward along the core margins (Figure F7B). In these intervals, the original lithofacies and sedimentary structures are usually slightly to severely disturbed but can still be recognized visually.   
• Soupy core disturbance is typically restricted to water-saturated intervals of unconsolidated ash overprinting original sedimentary or depositional structures (Figure F7C).   
• Sediment flowage is caused by high shearing rates between cored sediments and the core liner, leaving a smear or thin trail of displaced sediment along the inside of the core liner (Figure F7D). Contamination by sediment flowage along the core liner may occur over long sections of the core and should be considered when further measurements and sampling of core material are conducted.   
• Midcore flow-in disturbance may occur in water-saturated, granular core sections where grains and clasts flow and mix, producing mixed sediment and moderately to severely disturbed original sedimentary structures and stratigraphy (Figure F7E).   
• Brecciated core disturbance results from drilling-related brittle rock failure (Figure F7F). Slight brecciation produces cracks in the original lithologies (Figure F7G), whereas moderate to severe brecciation disturbs original lithofacies and sedimentary structures more severely, though they usually remain readily recognizable.   
• Biscuiting of recovered cores produces fractured disc-shaped pieces ranging in size from a few to more than $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ , often packed with sheared and remolded core material mixed with drill slurry, filling gaps between brittle “biscuits” (Figure F7H). Depending on the size of the biscuits, the degree of biscuiting was rated as slight $\sqrt{>}5\,\mathsf{c m}$ biscuits), moderate $(2{-}5\,\mathrm{cm})$ , severe $\left(<\!2\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ , and destroyed (brecciated biscuits).   
• Core voids up to ${\sim}25~\mathrm{cm}$ in the original lithologies were observed in a few instances, for example in cores that experienced basal flow-in (Jutzeler et al., 2014), core extension, or low recovery (Figure F7I). Original lithofacies and sedimentary structures are fully destroyed in these intervals. Artificial size and density segregation of sediments is likely to occur during drilling or within postrecovery core handling processes on board (e.g., inclining, shaking, and plunging cores on the catwalk to compact sediments).   
• Pseudohorizontal density grading, also described by Jutzeler et al. (2014), may occur while a core is lying flat on deck, resulting in vertical structures once the core is turned upright. Such core disturbances are observed most often in volcanic sediments, as increased porosity allows sucking in of seawater during hydraulic piston coring. The resulting soupy texture allows material to flow within the core liner. Secondary normal or reverse grading, or density separation of clasts, may occur as a result of this disturbance and obscure primary sedimentary features (Figure F8).

Identified disturbance parameters are recorded in GEODESC, and some of them are only associated with specific coring techniques. For example, APC and HLAPC coring may induce cor e expansion (stratification destroyed and layer thickness artificially increased), sediment flowag e disturbance (leaving a smear of exotic sediment along the inside of the core barrel), shearing an d sediment flowage along the margin of the core liner, and basal flow-in (false stratigraphy, commonly composed of soupy, polymictic, density-graded sediment that generally lacks horizonta l laminations). RCB and XCB coring typically cause torquing of the consolidated units (e.g., sedimentary and volcanic lithologies), resulting in biscuiting and brecciation (see above).  

# 2.3. Core description workflow  

Several procedures were used to document the composition, texture, and structures in materia l recovered during Expedition 398, including visual core description (both macroscopic and microscopic), digital color imaging, scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, X-ray imaging, an d XRD analysis.

Figure F8. Examples of artificial and primary grain size and density segregation in volcanic lithologies, Expedition 398. A. Artificial grain size variation created by remobilization of less dense, vesicular clasts within a soupy ash matrix. This disturbance was often observed in water-rich volcanic sediments where clasts could float freely in the core liner. B, C. Sedimentary features interpreted as primary observed in core sections with more tightly packed sediments and grading acros s cores. Though the interval in (B) is affected by uparching and sediment flowage core disturbances, the thin layer of lithi c enrichment is preserved. The normally graded ash in (C) transitions downcore to a graded lithic-rich layer, which the n returns to a normally graded ash (not pictured). The density and uniform distribution of clasts suggests these features ar e primary.  

To describe the cores with as much detail and efficiency as possible, the core describers of Expedition 398 established the following description workflow:  

1. Macroscopic identification and logging of intervals (see Table T1 for interval definition): macroscopic description of material color, texture, structure (e.g., bottom contacts, grain size, bedding, grading, and so on), componentry, and alteration (e.g., disseminated sulfides). Componentry refers to clasts $>2\;\mathrm{mm}$ and crystals; these were logged separately as vitric clasts (e.g., pumice, scoria), lithic clasts (e.g., volcanic rock, metamorphic rock), and biogenic clasts. 2. Microscopic analyses of interval characteristics: smear slides were critical for identifying components and mineralogy of volcanic, tuffaceous, and nonvolcanic sediments. Thin sections were important for identifying components and mineralogy of sedimentary rock igneous clasts and metamorphic basement rock (marble only). In the event of recurring layers in sediments and neighboring holes, smear slides were prepared only for representative layers, due to limited capacities/personnel on board. 3. Based on the descriptions from (1), supported by (2), and assisted by physical properties analysis (see Physical properties), intervals were grouped into sequential lithostratigraphic units and subunits (see Table T1 for lithostratigraphic unit and subunit definitions).  

# 2.4. Units  

The materials retrieved during Expedition 398 include sediment and their lithified equivalent s (including igneous rock clasts), and metamorphic (i.e., marble or peridotite) basement rocks. The y are described at the following levels:  

1. The descriptive interval (a single descriptive row in the GEODESC spreadsheet),   
2. The lithostratigraphic unit, and   
3. The subunit.  

# 2.4.1. Descriptive intervals  

A descriptive interval is a sediment or rock interval defined by macroscopic features such as color, texture, and grain size that are distinct from features in the lithologies above or below and ma y continue across core sections. They are analogous to beds, and thicknesses can be classified in th e same way.  

Multiple lithologies are sometimes intercalated and repetitive (e.g., alternating mud and san d beds), and these are usually grouped within one descriptive interval. This was accomplished b y adding a suffix of “with alternating…” to the principal name of the most abundant facies for th e subordinate facies (e.g., “organic-rich mud with alternating sand”; Figure F9). Alternatively, although not used during this expedition, it is possible to use the domain classifier in GEODES C for this purpose, where the alternating interval is identified as Domain 0 for the dominant lithology and the subordinate part is identified as Domain 1 (and 2, 3, if necessary). In GEODESC, eac h subordinate domain is then described beneath the composite descriptive interval as if it were it s own descriptive interval.  

Description of alternating lithologies was generally avoided for intervals containing volcanic sediments with $>\!75\%$ volcanic material, as these volcanic sediments must be associated with specifi c depth intervals for tephrostratigraphic purposes. Therefore, these lithologies were typically adde d using GEODESC’s “split interval” function so that background sediments could be describe d across an entire larger interval with smaller split intervals added incrementally (e.g., at the appearance of discrete volcanic ash layers).  

# 2.4.2. Lithostratigraphic units  

Lithostratigraphic units are assemblages, tens to hundreds of meters thick, of similar principa l lithologies and facies. They can include subunits (Table T1). Units are numbered sequentially (e.g., Lithostratigraphic Unit I, II, III) from top to bottom. They are clearly distinguishable from eac h other by several observable characteristics (e.g., relative proportion of principal lithologies, composition, bed thickness, grain size class). They can be considered analogous to formations. Changes in age, geochemistry, physical properties, or paleontology may coincide with, or infor m placements of, boundaries between lithostratigraphic units.

Figure F9. Volcanic, tuffaceous, and nonvolcanic sedimentary lithology naming conventions based on relative abundance s of grain (particles $<2\,\mathsf{m m})$ ) and clast (particles $>2\,\mathsf{m m}^{\prime}$ ) types. Expedition 398. Principal lithology names are compulsory fo r all intervals. Prefixes and suffixes are optional and can be combined with any principal lithology name. First-order divisio n is based on abundance of volcanic particles irrespective of fragmentation mechanism (e.g., pyroclastic, hydroclastic, epiclastic). Lithologies with $25\%{-}100\%$ volcanic particles are either “volcanic” $>\!75\%$ volcanic-derived grains and clasts) o r “tuffaceous” $(25\%-75\%$ volcanic-derived particles). For tuffaceous lithologies, if the dominant nonvolcanic particle component is siliciclastic, the grain size classification of Wentworth (1922) was used; if not siliciclastic, it was named by the dominant type of chemical or biogenic lithology. Lithologies with $0\%{-}25\%$ volcanic particles were classified as “nonvolcanic ” and treated similarly to the tuffaceous lithologies. If the lithology is predominantly nonvolcanic siliciclastic, the grain siz e classification of Wentworth (1922) is used. In nonvolcanic chemical or biogenic lithologies, the principal lithology name i s derived from the dominant lithology. Where multiple lithologies are intercalated and repetitive (e.g., alternating silt an d mud beds), the term “alternating” was added to the principal name of the most abundant facies, followed by “with” suffi x for the subordinate facies (e.g., organic-rich mud with alternating sand).  

# 2.4.3. Subunits  

Subunits are made up of many descriptive intervals and capture lithologic trends on the scale o f one to hundreds of meters. They are distinguished by more subtle shifts within the overall lithologic context, such as a subunit of ooze containing a much higher frequency of volcanic layers tha n a previous subunit. Subunits are numbered sequentially within the main units with an alphabetica l suffix (e.g., Subunit Ia, Ib, Ic), from top to bottom.  

# 2.5. Sediments and sedimentary rocks  

# 2.5.1. Lithologic description  

# 2.5.1.1. Principal lithology  

Principal lithologies were assigned by the proportion of four main sedimentary lithologic classe s (Figure F9), based on composition:  

• Volcanic $[>]5\%$ volcanic particles).   
• Tuffaceous $\langle25\%{-}75\%$ volcanic particles).   
• Nonvolcanic siliciclastic $.25\%$ volcanic particles, where siliciclastic particles are dominant compared to chemical and biogenic components).   
• Nonvolcanic chemical and biogenic ( $+25\%$ volcanic particles, where chemical and biogenic components are dominant compared to siliciclastic particles).  

The volcanic principal lithology names are from Fisher and Schmincke (1984) based on particl e size and proportions (Figures F10, F11).

\*Rock name can be more specific if dominant grain size is easily identifiable (e.g. pebble-grade conglomerate) ^A conglomerate consists of predominantly rounded to subrounded clasts; when the clasts are predominantly angular to subangular, the term breccia is used. For rocks with both rounded/subrounded and angular/subangular clasts in approximately equal proportions, the term 'breccia-conglomerate' is used \*\*Names used for both consolidated and unconsolidated sediments  

The term “tuffaceous” describes sediments consisting of $25\%{-}75\%$ volcanic grains and clast s mixed with another principal lithology (e.g., Fisher and Schmincke, 1984), often identified wit h microscopic smear slide observation (e.g., tuffaceous ooze; Figure F9). We chose to include tuffaceous lithologies as independent principal lithologies to preserve the use of prefixes for furthe r description.  

Nonvolcanic sediments contain $<\!25\%$ volcanic particles and are classed as either “siliciclastic, ” where siliciclastic particles are dominant compared to chemical and biogenic components, o r “chemical and biogenic,” where chemical and biogenic sedimentary components are dominan t compared to siliciclastic particles.  

Within these lithologic classes, the principal lithology name is based on particle size and lithification (unconsolidated versus consolidated) (Figure F11). Tuffaceous and nonvolcanic lithologie s were further categorized based on the proportions of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains (for lithologies with grain sizes $<\,2\ \mathrm{mm}\rangle$ ) (Figure F12) or based on the proportions of mud-, sand-, an d gravel-sized grains and clasts (for lithologies that contain clasts $>2\ \mathrm{mm}$ ) (Figure F13). For tuffaceous and nonvolcanic lithologies with a biogenic component, a simplified and adapted classification scheme based on Shepard (1954) was used (Figure F14). This scheme uses abundance o f biogenic components (e.g., foraminifera, diatoms, nannofossils, and radiolarians) to name nonvolcanic sediments. See Other parameters for more detail.

Carbonate lithologies are typically calcium carbonate based (i.e., calcite) and, in some cases, contain a proportion of dolomite (i.e., calcium magnesium carbonate). In such a case, we added th e prefix “dolomitic” to the principal lithology name (e.g., dolomitic sand). Mineralogy was determined by color, mineral hardness, smear slide observation, and HCl acid test (using both $10\%$ an d $20\%$ HCl)—the latter is particularly useful for the distinction of calcitic and dolomitic lithologies— and was subsequently confirmed by XRD analyses on selected samples. Evaporitic chemical sediments encountered at Site U1591, and maybe at Site U1599 (micritic sediment), were characterized based on mineralogy, macroscopic observations of texture, and XRD. Anhydrite lithologie s often occur as nodular varieties $(>\!0.5\ \mathrm{cm}$ growths) described in the literature as “chicken wire ” anhydrite (e.g., Hsü et al., 1973) or as laminated sheets $_{<0.5\mathrm{~cm}}$ growths) interbedded wit h micrite, and thus were assigned the “nodular” or “laminated” prefix. If the abundance of nodule s was $<\!25\%$ , the suffix “with anhydrite nodules” was used. Thin section analysis also allowed observation of algal mats within evaporitic lithologies.  

Lithification of sediments was determined by visual observation of relative hardness and compaction of sediments and corroborated by increasing $P$ -wave velocity and bulk density and decreasin g porosity (see Physical properties). As sediments often transitioned gradually from unconsolidated sediment to sedimentary rock with increasing depth, the point of transition to lithifie d principal lithology nomenclature (e.g., “mudstone” instead of “mud”) was determined based o n overall downcore trends.

# 2.5.1.1.1. Prefix  

Prefixes are used to describe lithologies and features that are present but not captured by principa l lithology names. They can refer to observable characteristics, such as “clast-supported” versu s “matrix-supported,” or “nodular.” They can also be assigned to components that appear in $25\%-$ $50\%$ abundance, for example, “silty” as a prefix to sand, “calcareous” as a prefix to mud, o r “microfossil-rich” as a prefix to limestone.  

# 2.5.1.1.2. Suffix  

The suffix is used for a subordinate component within a given sediment or sedimentary rock tha t deserves to be highlighted. Suffixes were assigned to lithologies with $1\%{-}25\%$ abundance. The y are always in the form of “with” added to the dominant principal lithology, for example, “with ash, ” “with clay,” or “with foraminifera.” Suffixes are also used with alternating units as describe d previously, and these can be up to $50\%$ abundance. For example, suffixes for principal lithologie s with alternating units might read “with alternating mudstone.”  

# 2.5.2. Definitions of descriptive terms  

# 2.5.2.1. Grain versus clast  

The term “particle” is used to describe fragments (i.e., grains and clasts) that comprise volcanicrich and nonvolcanic sediments, regardless of size. We use the term “clast” to describe particles $>$ $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ and “grain” to describe particles $<2\,\mathrm{mm}$ . This follows the practice of IODP Expedition 350, with combined size divisions of particles from Wentworth (1992), Fisher (1961), Fisher an d Schmincke (1984), Cas and Wright (1987), McPhie et al. (1993), and White and Houghton (2006).  

Volcanic particles were defined by Fisher and Schmincke (1984), and we adapt their scheme base d on grain size and the relative abundance of ash-sized $\left({<}2\ \mathrm{mm}\right)$ and lapilli-sized $(2{-}64\ \mathrm{mm})$ particles (Figure F10) rather than particle type. For example, the terms “ash” and “lapilli” are used whe n the proportion of one size was $>\!75\%$ , and “lapilli-ash” describes when both grain sizes were present but each at $-75\%$ abundance (Fisher and Schmincke, 1984). The term “ash” is used to imply  a composition of predominantly vitric grains (glass shards), unless specified otherwise, usin g “lithic,” “crystal,” or “lithic, crystal” prefixes in cases where these are dominant components, a s confirmed, for example, by smear slide analysis. Equally, lapilli are implied to consist predominantly of vitric clasts (e.g., pumice or scoria) unless a lithic, crystal, or lithic, crystal prefix is used, suggesting that these are dominant components. For example, we use the term “lithic lapilli” whe n an interval is dominantly composed of lithics sized $2{-}64\ \mathrm{mm}$ rather than vitric clasts. Types o f vitric clasts are further defined in the GEODESC interval under Type of vitric clasts.  

Lithic clast types are listed in the componentry columns of GEODESC (see Componentry).  

# 2.5.2.2. Monomictic versus polymictic  

The term “monomictic” is used for sediments with only one clast type (i.e., lithic or vitric), whereas “polymictic” is used when sediments have multiple clast types. We restrict our use o f these terms to particles $>\!2\,\mathrm{mm}$ in size (referred to as clasts in our scheme) and do not use the ter m for particles ${<}2\,\mathrm{mm}$ in size (referred to as grains in our scheme). Variations within a single volcani c parent rock (e.g., a collapsing lava dome) may produce a deposit referred to as monomictic, whic h is composed of fragments of the same composition. In contrast, a debris flow or turbidity curren t may remobilize a region that contains multiple source-rock types, therefore producing a deposi t that is polymictic.  

# 2.5.2.3. Clast-supported versus matrix-supported  

We define clast-supported sediments as sediment intervals with clasts $>\!2\ \mathrm{mm}$ that are in direc t physical contact with each other. In contrast, matrix-supported sediments have clasts $>\!2\,\mathrm{mm}$ surrounded by an interstitial fine-grained matrix with very few clast/clast contacts. The matrix is no t specifically defined by a grain size (i.e., it is not restricted to grains, which are ${<}2\;\mathrm{mm}$ in size). Fo r example, a matrix-supported volcanic breccia could have clasts supported in a matrix of lapilli.  

# 2.5.2.4. Lithic, crystal, and crystal, lithic prefixes  

Volcanic lithologies (e.g., ash, lapilli-ash, lapilli) were sometimes modified with the prefix “lithic,” “crystal,” or “crystal, lithic” to denote component enrichment (in a proportion of $25\%{-}50\%$ ) withi n a descriptive interval. Volcanic lithologies described without a lithic, crystal, or crystal, lithi c prefix are implied to be dominantly vitric. The type of vitric clast (e.g., pumice or scoria) is define d in GEODESC for that interval under Type of vitric clasts.  

# 2.5.2.5. Ooze versus calcareous mud  

Nonvolcanic sediments (i.e., sediments with $<\!25\%$ volcanic grains and clasts) containing a significant proportion of biogenic and calcareous components relative to siliciclastic components wer e commonly recovered during Expedition 398. These sediments were classified as “ooze” if the proportion of biogenic and calcareous components (e.g., calcareous nannofossils, foraminifera, diatoms, radiolarians) was ${>}50\%$ and as “calcareous mud” or “calcareous sand” if biogenic an d calcareous components were $25\%{-}50\%$ abundance (Figure F14). A suffix, for example “with foraminifera” or “with nannofossils,” was used for lithologies that contain $1\%{-}25\%$ biogenic and calcareous components. Such lithologies and calcareous muds and sands are implied to contain  a greater proportion of siliciclastic material than oozes and were distinguished from ooze by intensity of reaction with HCl and confirmed by microscopic smear slide observation, where necessary. Although most recovered oozes consist dominantly of calcareous microfossils, rare instances o f siliceous oozes, dominated, for example, by diatoms or radiolarians, were noted in the GEODES C descriptions.  

# 2.5.2.6. “Organic-rich” prefix and “with organic material” suffix  

Nonvolcanic ooze-dominated units and subunits display cyclical transitions from green-hue d ooze to olive-gray-brown oozes and calcareous muds, representing cyclical variations in proportions of organic matter. This organic matter also presented a telltale odor. When these color variations and odors were present, the “organic-rich” prefix was employed. If only a slight color chang e was observed and ooze was still recognizable, the suffix “with organic material” was employed.  

# 2.5.3. Sedimentary structures, textures, and fabric  

Sediment grain size was determined using the Wentworth scale (Wentworth, 1922) (Figure F10). The determination of grain sizes of loose volcanic-dominated deposits (i.e., fine to coarse ash/ lapilli) simplifies the classification schemes of Fisher and Schmincke (1984) and Schmid (1981).  

# 2.5.3.1. Structures  

Sedimentary structures observed in the recovered cores included stratification (i.e., bedding o r lamination), grading, soft-sediment deformation, and bioturbation. The lower contacts of stratification features were described based on geometry (i.e., irregular, planar, curviplanar, covered, o r not recovered), definition (i.e., sharp, diffuse, scoured, wavy, continuous, discontinuous, and gradational), and orientation (i.e., horizontal, subhorizontal, inclined, subvertical, and vertical).  

# 2.5.3.2. Bedding  

Bed thickness was defined according to Ingram (1954) and included the following units:  

• Very thickly bedded $=>\!100\,\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Thickly bedded $=30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Medium bedded $=10{-}30\;\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Thinly bedded $=3–10\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Very thinly bedded $=1{-}3\,\mathsf{c m}$ .   
• Thickly laminated $=0.3–1\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Thinly laminated $=<\!0.3\;\mathrm{cm}$ .  

Bedding type was also described as either planar, wavy, lenticular, or cross-bedded.  

# 2.5.3.3. Grading, sorting, and roundness  

Sediment grading was described as either normal (i.e., fining upward), reverse, symmetric (i.e., normal to reverse), symmetric (i.e., reverse to normal), multiple normal, or multiple revers e (Fisher and Schmincke, 1984). Descriptions of sorting and rounding followed the scheme of Fol k (1980) as shown in Figure F15.  

# 2.5.4. Bioturbation  

Bioturbation intensity in deposits was measured and shown on the VCDs using the semiquantitative ichnofabric index described by Droser and Bottjer (1986, 1991), aided by visual comparativ e charts (Heard et al., 2014). The several indexes shown in these charts refer to the degree of biogenic disruption of primary fabric such as laminations and range from nonbioturbated sedimen t to total homogenization. Here, the indexes are simplified and summarized into categories a s below:  

• None $=$ no bioturbation recorded; all original sedimentary structures preserved. • Slight bioturbation $=$ discrete, isolated trace fossils; up to $10\%$ of original bedding disturbed. • Moderate bioturbation $=$ approximately $10\%{-}60\%$ of original bedding disturbed; burrows largely overlap and are commonly poorly defined. • High bioturbation $=$ bedding is completely disturbed, but burrows can still be discerned in places; the fabric is not mixed although the bedding may be nearly or totally homogenized.  

# 2.5.5. Componentry  

Volcanic, tuffaceous, and nonvolcanic sediments and their lithified equivalents were furthe r described by their respective components including lithic clasts, vitric clasts, biogenic clasts, fre e crystals, and matrix. Clast components must be $>\!2\,\;\mathrm{mm}$ (following the definition of clasts vs. grains), whereas matrix may be composed of both clasts and grains. Lithic clasts were described b y their composition (i.e., volcanic, carbonate, sedimentary, and so on). Vitric clasts were characterized by texture (e.g., scoria, pumice) and roundness (i.e., angular, subangular, subrounded, rounded) (Figure F15). Free crystals visible macroscopically were identified regardless of size, though most crystals were grains $\left(<2\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ ). Biogenic components were identified and specified b y type if possible (e.g., gastropod, echinoderm, bivalve, and so on).  

# 2.6. Alteration  

# 2.6.1. Macroscopic description  

Alteration observed macroscopically was classified by feature (e.g., vein, disseminated) an d secondary mineral type. Noted alteration features include background alteration, concretion, disseminated secondary mineral phases, layered alteration, nodular alteration, or vein infills.  

Macroscopic observation of several secondary minerals was recorded in terms of abundance (i.e., dropdown multiselect list by order of abundance) to indicate prevalence of mineralization for eac h type. Comments were allowed for further description of observed alteration (e.g., “quartz-chlorit e veins may indicate hydrothermal alteration”).  

# 2.6.2. Microscopic description  

Microscopic descriptions of alteration are contained within the microscopic descriptions of th e major rock type (i.e., sedimentary, igneous, metamorphic). The intensity of replacement of original rock components is based on visual estimations of proportions relative to the total area of th e thin section. Microscopic descriptions are made in terms of replacing phases for minerals, groundmass/matrix, clasts, glass, and patches of alteration. Comments are used to provide furthe r specific information where available. Descriptive terms used for alteration extent follow:

• Slight $=<\!10\%$ .   
• Moderate $=10\%{-50\%}$ .   
• High $=>\!50\%$ .  

# 2.7. Other parameters  

Several additional parameters were recorded in macroscopic core descriptions to further delineat e units. Color was recorded using standardized Munsell color charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2009). Organic-rich (sapropelic) muds and oozes were recognized by their dark color and occasional sulfuric odor and characterized using the terms “homogeneous” or “color-banded.”  

# 2.8. Smear slides  

Smear slides are useful for identifying and reporting basic sediment attributes like textural, mineralogical, and compositional features, as well as microfossils. They were prepared to confirm macroscopic descriptions of distinct lithology changes at the core section level, such as identificatio n of vitric particles in tuffaceous lithologies or crystals in ash layers. They confirmed the presence o f specific minerals such as biotite, amphibole, feldspar, and pyroxene. Smear slide components supported designation of boundaries of units and subunits, but the results are semiquantitative at bes t (cf. Marsaglia et al., 2013, 2015). Finer grained sediments $\left(<2\ \mathrm{mm}\right)$ required inspection at hig h magnification to accurately determine lithic, crystal, and biogenic type and abundance. We estimated the abundance of volcanic, tuffaceous, siliciclastic, and biogenic components using a visua l comparison chart (Rothwell, 1989), with an emphasis on major lithologies. Particular attentio n was paid to recognition of ash layers and tuffaceous lithologies through observation of glass an d crystals. Glass shape and vesicularity as well as vesicle shape were quantified as well.  

Visual estimates for normalized percentages of sand, silt, and clay (Terry and Chilingar, 1955) wer e recorded along with abundance for the individual observed grain types. The component categorization applied to smear slides is shown in Figure F16. For all smear slides, visual estimates of component abundance were made semiquantitatively, and defined as follows:  

• $\mathrm{T}=$ trace $(<\!1\,\mathrm{vol}\%)$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(1\!-\!5\;\mathrm{vol\%})$ .   
• $C=$ common $(5\mathrm{-}20\,\mathrm{vol\%})$ .   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(20{-}50\,\mathrm{vol}\%)$ ).   
• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant $(>\!50\%)$ .  

Smear slides were observed and photographed in transmitted light, plane-polarized light (PPL), and cross-polarized light (XPL) using an Axioskop 40A polarizing microscope (Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a FlexSpot digital camera (Figure F17).  

# 2.9. Thin sections  

Description of thin sections followed standard protocols as described in IODP Expedition 34 4 (Harris et al., 2013). Thin section descriptions were used to refine the initial macroscopic observations of sedimentary, igneous (clast only), and metamorphic lithologies. The composition an d proportion (modal) of primary and secondary (altered/hydrothermal) minerals and other rockforming components in these lithologies were better defined by using microscopic examination. The microscopic description of sedimentary lithologies followed closely that of our macroscopi c characterization, with additional detail provided on the grain size, texture, and proportions of roc k components. Textural domains of igneous rocks (identified only as clasts for Expedition 398) wer e defined after MacKenzie et al. (1982). We also described the crystallinity (i.e., holocrystalline, hypocrystalline, and holohyaline) and the vesicularity (i.e., degree, shape, and size) of our samples. In our description, “phenocryst” was used as a shape term describing relatively large and generall y conspicuous crystals distinctly larger than the groundmass of a volcanic rock. A preliminary nam e for volcanic rock (e.g., basalt, andesite, dacite, and rhyolite) was given based on color, phenocrys t content, and literature data (Table T2).  

Eruptive products from Christiana, Kolumbo, and ancient Santorini $(>\!550\,\mathrm{ka})$ contain amphibol e and zircon (e.g., Huijsmans, 1985; Druitt et al., 1999; Francalanci et al., 2005; Cantner et al., 2014; Higgins et al., 2021) (Table T3), which are essentially absent in the younger Santorini series (Francalanci and Zellmer, 2019). In addition, biotite has so far only been identified in quantity in th e Kolumbo eruptive products (e.g., Cantner et al., 2014) (Table T3). These mineralogical difference s helped us to correlate the volcanic layers between cores collected during this expedition an d between source volcanoes. We also compared our samples with the parageneses of the eruptiv e products of Milos and Eastern Aegean arc volcanoes that could be present in our cores.

Metamorphic rocks were only encountered as occasional lithic clasts in volcanic intervals and i n crystalline basement rocks of the south Aegean region that were recovered at some sites. Th e nomenclature used for naming metamorphic rocks was based on directly observable features a t the macroscopic scale (i.e., mineral content and rock structure) rather than genetic terms, following the recommendations by the IUGS Subcommission on the Systematics of Metamorphic Rock s (Schmid et al., 2004).  

Thin sections were observed and photographed in transmitted light, PPL, and XPL using a n Axioskop 40A polarizing microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a FlexSpot digital camera (Figur e F18).

# 2.11. X-ray diffraction  

Samples for XRD analysis were obtained routinely from IW squeeze cake sediment residues an d selected other core samples. Typically, $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}$ samples were processed for XRD analysis. All samples were vacuum-dried, crushed for $3\ \mathrm{min}$ with a ball mill, and mounted as randomly oriente d bulk powders. Routine XRD analyses of bulk powders were performed using a Malvern Panalytica l Aeris X-ray diffractometer equipped with a PIXcel1D detector, which allows standardless quantification of mixtures of phases. XRD instrument settings were as follows:  

• Voltage $=40\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
• Current $=15\;\mathrm{mA}.$ .   
• Goniometer angle $=5^{\circ}{-}70^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
• Step size $\prime=0.0108664^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
• Scan speed $=49.725\;\mathrm{s}/$ step.   
• Divergence sl $\mathrm{t}=0.25~\mathrm{mm}$ .  

The principal goal of XRD analysis was to determine bulk sample mineralogy from characteristi c peaks in the XRD spectra (Figure F19) to complement the macroscopic core description and geochemical analysis. Identification of all phases was carried out using Malvern Panalytical’s softwar e package, HighScore Plus, based on characteristic mineral peaks and peak intensities (i.e., counts). Relative phase proportions were determined in selected samples using the Rietveld method implemented in HighScore Plus.  

# 2.12. Interpretation  

Core description was intentionally restricted to observable characteristics of the recovered materials. However, we allowed for optional preliminary interpretation of lithologic origin based on th e observable characteristics recorded (i.e., fallout, debris flow, basement). Initial interpretation wa s largely for ease of internal communication among the onboard science party and is not included i n the final VCDs subject to review by the core description scientists and co-chief scientists.

# 3. Stratigraphic correlation  

The scientific objectives of Expedition 398 required recovery of complete stratigraphic interval s with continuity at a centimeter scale. With a single IODP hole, such recovery is impossible t o achieve because of coring gaps that occur between successive cores during the drilling process, even when $100\%$ or more nominal recovery is attained (Ruddiman et al., 1987; Hagelberg et al., 1995). In addition, contamination by sediments that might have fallen into the hole introduce s stratigraphic noise within any core. Therefore, it was important to generate a “splice,” whereby w e combined stratigraphic intervals from two or more closely spaced holes at the same site, such tha t the depths of core gaps are staggered between holes. To minimize gaps between cores, w e attempted to offset the depths of coring between adjacent holes and intended to apply near realtime correlations to check while coring.  

The stratigraphic correlators aboard JOIDES Resolution during Expedition 398 focused mainly o n three tasks: (1) use the correlation of sediment physical properties (MS and GRA density) acquire d from fast whole-round tracks between holes that were scanned immediately upon retrieval o f cores as a rapid-response guide while drilling to minimize gap alignment; (2) construct a composite depth scale for all holes; and (3) reconstruct the most representative single continuous sedimentary section by splicing intervals from multiple holes.  

The results from the stratigraphic correlation effort involved consideration of several differen t depth scales, for which we followed IODP conventions, as outlined below (see IODP Depth Scale s Terminology at https://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines) (Figure F20).  

![](images/3bdff39fbb4a03955171dfe11051c86b01edf53084d96b2a8beccbe5af8daa93.jpg)  
Figure F20. Relationships between cored material and the depth scales used during Expedition 398. We obtained the CSFA scale by adding the curated core length (CSF) to the core top depth (DSF). Here, the mudline was cored in Hole A Core  1 but not in Hole B Core 2. Stratigraphic overlaps result from core expansion (dashed lines). For correlation, we identify distinct events in adjacent holes (turquoise lines) working from the top downward. By applying the according depth shifts, w e construct the CCSF-A scale. The splice (CCSF-D) is constructed by combining selected intervals between tie points (yellow ) such that coring gaps and disturbed sections are excluded.  

# 3.1. Drilling depth below seafloor scale  

The starting point for the process of building a composite section was to assign a depth to the to p of each core, which is initially based on DSF. This value is determined as the difference betwee n the length of the drill string below the rig floor to the top of the cored interval and the length of th e drill string from the rig floor to the mudline, which is, by IODP convention, assumed to be th e seafloor (Figure F20). DSF is influenced by tidal variations in sea level, uncompensated ship heave, and other sources of error.  

# 3.2. Core depth below seafloor scale  

The depth of a given position within any core is determined relative to the DSF core top depth. The CSF scale combines the DSF core top depth with the curated depth within a core afte r retrieval (Figure F20).  

CSF does not necessarily correspond to the actual depth below the seafloor for several reasons. Technical reasons can prevent the mudline from being cored, especially if the precise water dept h is not accurately known, for instance, due to tides or swell and resulting heave. It may turn out tha t even if the mudline was cored in Hole A, the mudline was not cored in Hole B because the AP C stroke was shot from beneath the sediment surface. Such an example is shown in Figure F20.  

Other factors combine to further influence CSF. Sediment loss at the ends of the core may shorte n the core. Core expansion resulting from the piston coring technique, which develops underpressure at the top of the core, is one of the most common effects. Overpressurized fluids or trappe d gas within the pore space of the core may also result in expansion. Therefore, core expansion ma y result in an overlap of cores when plotted on the CSF scale (CSF-A).  

If the APC core barrel, for example, penetrates the seafloor by $8\;\mathrm{m}$ including the mudline (Hole  A Core 1H), the entire ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ long core may be filled due to expansion. However, because the top o f the next core is at $8\textrm{m}$ DSF, the resulting CSF-A scale will indicate a $2\;\mathrm{m}$ overlap. Thus, errors i n the CSF-A scale include both drilling effects and core expansion effects, and, as a consequence, th e CSF-A scale permits overlap between successive cores that are stratigraphically impossible.  

# 3.3. Core composite depth below seafloor scale  

Before a splice can be constructed, the cores from adjacent holes must be stratigraphically correlated with each other (Figure F20). Such correlation transfers the CSF-A scale into the CCSF, Method A (CCSF-A), scale that should, in principle, correct stratigraphic artifacts contained in th e CSF-A scale. The CCSF scale is based on locating features common to cores in multiple holes at  a given site and working from the top of the site downward to select tie points (arrows in Figur e F20) that correlate strata in one hole with those in another. Because of core expansion and th e unavoidable absence of complete recovery at the tops and bottoms of cores, Holes A and B on th e CCSF scale are potentially longer than they are on the CSF-A scale.  

By correlating distinct features, such as prominent waveforms in physical properties or distinc t layers in core images, between cores from adjacent holes, we shifted the depth of individual core s relative to CSF-A in that hole to align those features on a common depth scale (Figure F20). Th e construction of a CCSF-A scale requires that each individual core is offset by a constant valu e without stretching or squeezing individual cores. This resulting composite depth scale provide s good estimates of the length of coring gaps and provides the basis for the development of th e spliced record (CCSF-D scale, see below). We summarized the vertical depth offset of every cor e in every hole in an affine table, one of the principal deliverables of the stratigraphic correlatio n effort.  

In practice, we constructed the CCSF-A scale using Correlator software (version 4.0) (see mor e below), which allowed correlation of distinct strata or corresponding physical properties downhole from the mudline. The mudline marks the top of the stratigraphic section and was typicall y taken from the first core. We used the core including the uppermost strata as the “anchor” in th e composite depth scale. This core (Core A in Figure F20) is usually the only one in which the depth s are the same on the CSF-A and CCSF-A scales.  

Next, we identified corresponding signatures (i.e., prominent waveforms in physical properties o r distinctive layers in core images) and established tie points among adjacent holes. MS was th e most suitable physical parameter and was used most often. The decision regarding which cor e from which hole should be shifted against the corresponding core in the neighboring hole was no t always easy to make. As a rule, however, cores were shifted downward because an upward shif t usually increased the vertical overlap of two cores in the same hole, which is usually not plausible. Whenever we encountered gaps in the correlation (e.g., due to low recovery or when no correlations could be identified), we used the “SET” function in Correlator software to offset the core s below the gaps by the same amount as the cores above.  

As a consequence of the downward shift, the summed length of all cores in the CCSF-A scale i s usually longer than the sum of all cores in the DSF or CSF-A scale. We calculated the systemati c increase for each site by comparing the deviation from the CCSF-A scale from the CSF-A scale. The final length of all cores in the CCSF-A scale is therefore greater than the maximum drillin g depth due to postrecovery expansion of the cores.  

After establishing the CCSF-A scale and identifying all between-core gaps, we constructed a complete stratigraphic section—the splice—by combining selected intervals between aligned adjacen t cores. The resulting depth section is the CCSF-D scale, which can be considered a subset of th e CCSF-A scale (Figure F20). The corresponding splice interval table contains listings of the specifi c core intervals used to construct the splice and is the other principal deliverable of the stratigraphi c correlation effort. No correction of the core expansion was applied on board.  

# 3.4. Measurements and methods for correlation  

Our workflow for compositing and splicing using Correlator software (version 4.0) comprised tw o steps:  

1. During core retrieval from Hole B, we anticipated using the Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) to rapidly measure GRA density and MS as soon as possible after core retrieval. This allowed stratigraphic correlation to be conducted in near real time so that bit depths could be adjusted to avoid alignment of core gaps between holes.   
2. After retrieval of cores from both Holes A and B, we used all available data to develop composite sections (CCSF-A scale) based on the stratigraphic correlation of NGR, MS, and GRA density acquired from the WRMSL and STMSL, as well as digitized color reflectance data and photos. We accomplished compositing and splicing using Correlator software, from which we generated standard affine tables (i.e., listings of the vertical offset in meters added to each core to generate the CCSF-A scales) and splice interval tables (i.e., listings of the specific core intervals used to construct the splice). Once the stratigraphic correlation was finalized, we uploaded finalized tables into the IODP LIMS database with “-USE THIS” remarks, which then affixes the appropriate depth scale to any associated data set.  

# 4. Structural geology  

The Christiana-Santorini-Kolumbo (CSK) volcanic field and surrounding marine rift basins on th e Hellenic volcanic arc form a unique system that records rich archives of volcanic products, tectonic evolution, and magma genesis. The principal objective of the structural geology team durin g Expedition 398 was to record deformation structures observed both in volcanic and clastic packages in cores, which are the basic data for evaluating the links between tectonic evolution an d volcanism, and corresponding event deposits in the basin.  

Our methods for documenting the structural geology of Expedition 398 cores largely followe d those given by Expedition 334 structural geologists (see Structural geology in the Expedition 33 4 methods chapter [Expedition 334 Scientists, 2012]). We documented deformation observed in th e split cores by classifying structures, determining the depth interval, measuring orientation data, and recording the sense of displacement. The collected data were hand logged onto a printed for m at the core table and then typed into both a spreadsheet and the GEODESC database.  

# 4.1. Structural data acquisition and orientation measurements  

Each structure was recorded manually on a description table sheet modified from that used durin g Expeditions 315 and 316 (Figure F21). Core measurements followed those made during Expeditions 315, 316, and 376 (Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 316 Scientists, 2009; de Rond e et al., 2019), which in turn were based on previous Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) procedure s developed at the Nankai accretionary margin (i.e., ODP Legs 131 and 190; Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 1991; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001). The distance from the top of the section $\left(0\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ t o the top and bottom of the feature was recorded, and the mean distance between the top an d bottom of the feature was used as the depth of the structure on the plot (Figure F22). We used  a plastic protractor for orientation measurements (Figure F23). Using the working half of the spli t cores provided greater flexibility in removing—and cutting, if necessary—pieces of the core fo r measurements.  

Orientations of planar and linear features in cored materials were determined relative to the cor e axis, which represents the vertical axis in the core reference frame, and the “double line” marke d on the working half of the split core liner, which represents $0^{\circ}$ (and $360^{\circ}$ ) in the plane perpendicular to the core axis (Figure F24). For the RCB cores, orientation measurements were conducte d only on core pieces longer than ${\sim}5~\mathrm{cm}$ to ensure that a piece did not rotate around a horizonta l axis resulting in an uncertain upcore orientation).  

To determine the orientation of a planar structural element, two apparent dips of this elemen t were measured in the core reference frame and converted to a plane represented by the dip angl e and either a strike or dip direction (Figure F25). One apparent dip is usually represented by th e intersection of the planar feature with the split face of the core and is quantified by measuring th e dip direction and angle in the core reference frame ${\mathfrak{f}}_{1};$ Figure F25). Typical apparent dip measurements have a trend of $90^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ and range in plunge from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ ( $\upbeta_{2},$ Figure F25). The secon d apparent dip is usually represented by the intersection of the planar feature and a cut or fracture d surface at a high angle to the split face of the core. In most cases, this was a surface either paralle l or perpendicular to the core axis. In the former cases, the apparent dip lineation would trend $0^{\circ}$ o r $180^{\circ}$ and plunge from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ ; in the latter cases, the trend would range from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ and plung e at $0^{\circ}$ . Linear features observed in the cores were always associated with planar structures (e.g. , striations on faults), and their orientations were determined by measuring either the rake (o r pitch) on the associated plane or the trend and plunge in the core reference frame. During Expedition 398, we measured rake for striations on fault surfaces (Figure F26) but azimuth and plunge fo r other lineation (e.g., fold axes).

# 4.2. Description and classification of structures  

We constructed a structural geology template for GEODESC to facilitate the description an d classification of observed structures. For clarity, we defined the terminology used to describ e fault-related rocks as well as the basis for differentiating natural structures from drilling-induce d features.

Figure F26. Diagram of apparent rake measurement of striations on a fault surface from $270^{\circ}$ direction of split core surfac e trace, Expedition 398. $\Phi_{\mathsf{a}}=\,$ apparent rake.  

Faults were classified into several categories based on the sense of fault slip and their structura l characteristics. The sense of fault slip was identified using offsets of markers (e.g., bedding an d older faults) across the fault plane and predominantly by slicken steps. A fault with cohesivenes s across the fault zone was described as a “healed fault.”  

For the igneous rock intervals, whereas lithology and mineralogy of the vein minerals wer e described by the petrologists, the orientations of the veins, foliations, and other structural feature s were measured by the structural geologists.  

Structural data can sometimes be disturbed by drilling-induced structures such as flow-in structures in APC and HLAPC cores and biscuiting, fracturing, faulting, and rotation of fragments i n XCB and RCB cores. If structures have been disturbed by flow-in on ${>}60\%$ of the cross section o f the core, we excluded measurements because of the intense disturbance (e.g., bending, rotation, and so on) of these structures.  

# 4.3. X-ray image logger  

X-ray imaging provides information about structural and sedimentary features and quality i n cores. Furthermore, structures such as shear zones could be imaged related to porosity changes o r chemical alteration within shear zones. X-ray imaging was supplemental to visual core description during Expedition 398.  

The X-ray Logger (XMAN) on JOIDES Resolution is a Teledyne ICM CP120B. Imaging was performed on selected core sections with complex fractures/microfaults during core descriptions. The XMAN scans a $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ core section in $\mathord{\sim}8\;\mathrm{min}$ . It scans the upper half of the core section in th e first $4~\mathrm{min}$ ; a plastic pusher is then added behind the core section, and the instrument runs fo r another $4\,\mathrm{min}$ to scan the lower half of the core section. The images are then processed.  

The images were transferred from the XMAN host PC to the server using a script that copies th e output from the XMAN to the server automatically every 30 min as executed via a task scheduler. The X-ray imaging parameters (i.e., voltage, current, time, and stack) were added at the top of eac h processed image for further reference.  

# 4.4. Calculation of plane orientation  

For planar structures (e.g., bedding or faults), two apparent dips on two different surfaces (e.g., on e being the split core surface, which is east–west vertical, and the other being the horizontal o r north–south vertical surface) were measured in the core reference frame as azimuths (measure d clockwise from north, looking down) and plunges (Figure F25). A coordinate system was define d in such a way that the positive $x_{\mathrm{-}},y_{\mathrm{-}}$ , and $z_{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ -directions coincide with north, east, and vertical downward, respectively. If the azimuths and plunges of the two apparent dips are given as $(\alpha_{1},\,\upbeta_{1})$ an d $(\alpha_{2},\beta_{2})$ , respectively, as in Figure F25, then the unit vectors representing these two lines, $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2},$ are  

![](images/ab849a9668338abbbaec8cd7385716ffe3ccaebc553509ffc072bb80670f600c.jpg)  
Figure F27. Diagrams of dip direction $(\upalpha_{\mathsf{d}})$ , right-hand rule strike $(\upalpha_{s})$ , and dip (β) of a plane deduced from its norma l azimuth $\left(\mathfrak{a}_{\mathfrak{n}}\right)$ and dip $(\beta_{\mathfrak{n}})$ , Expedition 398. $v_{\mathsf{n}}=$ the unit vector normal to plane. A. $\beta_{n}<0^{\circ}.\,\mathsf{B}.\,\mathsf{\beta}\mathsf{\beta}_{\mathsf{n}}\geq0^{\circ}$ .  

$$
\nu_{1}\,=\,{\binom{l_{1}}{m_{1}}}\,=\,{\binom{\cos\alpha_{1}\cos\beta_{1}}{\sin\alpha_{1}\cos\beta_{1}}}
$$  

and  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{2}\,=\,\left(\!\!\begin{array}{c}{l_{2}}\\ {m_{2}}\\ {n_{2}}\end{array}\!\!\right)\,=\,\left(\!\!\begin{array}{c}{\cos\alpha_{2}\cos\upbeta_{2}}\\ {\sin\upalpha_{2}\cos\upbeta_{2}}\\ {\sin\upbeta_{2}}\end{array}\!\!\right)\!.}\end{array}
$$  

The unit vector normal to the plane, $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ (Figure F27), is then defined as  

$$
\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\mathrm{n}}\,=\,\left(\!\!\begin{array}{l}{l_{\mathrm{n}}}\\ {m_{\mathrm{n}}}\\ {n_{\mathrm{n}}}\end{array}\!\!\right)\,=\,\frac{\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}}{\left|\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}\right|}\,,
$$  

where  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{l}{\left|\begin{array}{l}{m_{1}}\end{array}\right|}\\ {n_{1}}\end{array}\right)}\\ {\left|\begin{array}{l}{n_{1}}\\ {l_{1}}\end{array}\right|}\\ {l_{1}}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{l}{m_{1}n_{2}-m_{2}n_{1}}\\ {n_{1}l_{2}-n_{2}l_{1}}\\ {l_{1}m_{2}-l_{2}m_{1}}\end{array}\right).}\end{array}
$$  

The azimuth, $\upalpha_{\mathrm{n}},$ and plunge, $\beta_{\mathrm{n}},$ of $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ are given by  

$$
{\upalpha}_{n}\,=\,\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{m_{n}}{l_{n}}\right)\!,\,{\upbeta}_{n}\,=\,\sin^{-1}\!n_{n}.
$$  

The dip direction, $\upalpha_{\mathrm{{d}}},$ and dip angle, $\upbeta_{\cdot}$ , of this plane are $\upalpha_{\mathrm{n}}$ and $90^{\circ}+\beta_{\mathrm{n}}$ respectively, when $\beta_{\mathrm{n}}<0^{\circ}$ (Figure F27A). They are $\alpha_{\mathrm{n}}\pm180^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}-\beta_{\mathrm{n}}$ respectively, when $\upbeta_{\mathrm{n}}\geq0^{\circ}$ (Figure F27B). The righthand rule strike of this plane, $\upalpha_{\mathrm{s}},$ is then given by $\upalpha_{\mathrm{d}}-90^{\circ}$ (Figure F27).  

# 4.5. Calculation of slickenline rake  

For a fault with striations, the apparent rake angle of the striation, $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}},$ was measured on the faul t surface from either the $90^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ direction of the split-core surface trace (Figures F26, F27). Th e fault orientation was measured as described above. Provided that $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$ are unit vectors norma l to the fault and split core surfaces, respectively, the unit vector of the intersection line, $\nu_{\mathrm{i}},$ is perpendicular to both $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ and $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$ (Figure F28) and is therefore defined as  

$$
\nu_{i}\,=\,\left(\begin{array}{c}{{l_{i}}}\\ {{m_{i}}}\\ {{n_{i}}}\end{array}\right)\,=\,\frac{\nu_{n}\times\nu_{c}}{\left|\nu_{n}\times\nu_{c}\right|},
$$  

where  

$$
\nu_{c}\,=\,{\left(\begin{array}{l}{1}\\ {0}\\ {0}\end{array}\right)}
$$  

and  

$$
\nu_{n}\times\nu_{c}={\left(\begin{array}{l}{\left|{\begin{array}{l}{m_{n}}&{0}\\ {n_{n}}&{0}\end{array}}\right|}\\ {\left|{\begin{array}{l}{n_{n}}&{0}\\ {n_{n}}&{0}\\ {l_{n}}&{1}\end{array}}\right|}\\ {\left|{\begin{array}{l}{l_{n}}&{1}\\ {l_{n}}&{1}\\ {m_{n}}&{0}\end{array}}\right|}\end{array}\right)}={\left(\begin{array}{l}{0}\\ {n_{n}}\\ {n_{n}}\end{array}\right)}.
$$  

Knowing the right-hand rule strike of the fault plane, $\upalpha_{\mathrm{{s}}},$ the unit vector, $\nu_{s},$ toward this direction i s then  

$$
\nu_{s}\,=\,\left(\begin{array}{c}{{\cos\alpha_{s}}}\\ {{\sin\alpha_{s}}}\\ {{0}}\end{array}\right)\,.
$$  

The rake angle of the intersection line, $\Phi_{\mathrm{i}},$ measured from the strike direction is given by  

$$
\Phi=\cos^{-1}(\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\times\nu_{\mathrm{i}}),
$$  

because  

$$
\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\times\nu_{\mathrm{i}}=\left|\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\right|\left|\nu_{\mathrm{i}}\right|\mathrm{cos}\phi_{\mathrm{i}}=\mathrm{cos}\phi_{\mathrm{i}},\therefore\left|\nu_{\mathrm{s}}\right|=\left|\nu_{\mathrm{i}}\right|=1.
$$  

The rake angle of the striation, $\Phi_{:}$ , from the strike direction is $\Phi_{\mathrm{i}}\pm\Phi_{\mathrm{a}},$ depending on the directio n from which the apparent rake was measured and on the dip direction of the fault: $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ should b e subtracted from $\Phi_{\mathrm{i}}$ when the fault plane dips to the west and $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ was measured from either the to p or $90^{\circ}$ direction (Figure F28A) or when the fault plane dips toward the east and $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ was measure d from either the bottom or $90^{\circ}$ direction (Figure F28B). On the other hand, $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ should be added t o $\Phi_{\mathrm{i}}$ when the fault plane dips toward the east and $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ was measured from either the top or $270^{\circ}$ direction (Figure F28C) or when the fault plane dips toward the west and $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ was measured fro m either the bottom or $270^{\circ}$ direction (Figure F28D).

# 4.6. GEODESC structural database  

The GEODESC database is a program used to store visual (i.e., macroscopic and/or microscopic ) descriptions of core structures at a given section index. During this expedition, orientation dat a were first recorded on the printed Structure VCD and then logged in a spreadsheet as describe d above. Then all the orientation data, locations of structural features, and calculated orientations i n the core reference frame were input into GEODESC.  

# 5. Biostratigraphy  

The primary biostratigraphic objectives were to provide biostratigraphic ages to develop an integrated biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy for all drill sites. Secondary objectives were t o identify changes in paleowater depth ranges and intervals of reworking to help elucidate the history of sedimentation and volcano-tectonic processes within the Hellenic arc volcanic field.  

Preliminary age assignments during Expedition 398 were based on biostratigraphic analyses usin g calcareous nannofossils and planktonic and benthic foraminifera from $5{-}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ whole-roun d samples cored with the APC, HLAPC, XCB, and RCB systems. Most samples were taken from CC s or from the base of cores where CCs were not recovered, but where appropriate, additional splitcore samples were taken to better define certain datums and zonal boundaries. Moreover, mudlin e samples from all cores were preserved in an ethanol $(70\%)$ and rose bengal solution $(2\,\mathrm{g/L})$ according to Walton’s (1952) technique to analyze the present-day environmental conditions. In additio n to the abundance and preservation of the age-diagnostic microfossil groups, the presence of othe r sedimentary remains including tephra, shell fragments, phytoliths, micromollusks, ostracods, otoliths, bryozoan fragments, echinoid spines and plates, fish teeth and remains, radiolarians, diatoms, and sponge spicules was also routinely monitored.  

The Geologic Time Scale 2020 (GTS 2020) (Gibbard and Head, 2020; Gradstein et al., 2020; Raff i et al., 2020) was used during Expedition 398 and supplemented with regional Mediterranean biostratigraphic schemes and datums (e.g., Rio et al., 1990; Lirer et al., 2019) to facilitate the integration of the Expedition 398 data with regional geological and seismic data (Figure F29). Wher e identified, uncertainties within microfossil datums that appear diachronous with the utilize d Mediterranean biostratigraphic schemes, potentially due to local oceanographic differences, wer e noted for future calibration.  

# 5.1. Calcareous nannofossils  

The taxonomic criteria of calcareous nannofossils follows Perch-Nielsen (1985) and Raffi et al. (2006). The calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic classification of sedimentary sequences follows the recent reviews by Raffi et al. (2006) and Backman et al. (2012). Based on this classification, the calcareous nannofossil zonal scheme established by Martini (1971) and Okada and Bukr y (1980), and modified by Young (1998) and Backman et al. (2012), was used for Neogene to Quaternary sequences encountered during Expedition 398. In addition, the Neogene to Quaternary biohorizons defined by Sato and Takayama (1992), modified by Raffi et al. (2006), were used for mor e detailed correlation of the sedimentary sequences. The Mediterranean scheme of Rio et al. (1990 ) was also utilized and updated with regional biostratigraphic markers (e.g., Lourens et al., 2004; Raffi et al., 2006; Di Stefano and Sturiale, 2010).  

Astronomically tuned age estimates for the Neogene to Quaternary global chronostratigraphi c units were based on the GTS 2020 (Gibbard and Head, 2020; Gradstein et al., 2020; Raffi et al., 2020). Specimens of the genera Reticulofenestra were assigned to size categories as proposed b y Young (1998). For gephyrocapsids, we adopted the concept of Raffi et al. (2006), and the morphological terminology used here is summarized in Perch-Nielsen (1985) and Takayama and Sat o (1987). Accordingly, Gephyrocapsa is divided into four major groups by maximum coccolit h length:  

• Small Gephyrocapsa $(<\!4\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ .   
• Medium Gephyrocapsa ( $G.$ . caribbeanica and $G.$ . oceanica; ${\ge}4$ but $<5.5\;\upmu\mathrm{m}\rangle$ .   
• Gephyrocapsa sp. 3 ( $G.$ . parallela; ${\ge}4$ but ${<}5.5\;\upmu\mathrm{m}\mathrm{)}$ ).   
• Large Gephyrocapsa ( $G.$ . caribbeanica and $G.$ . oceanica ${\geq}5.5\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ .  

All zonal schemes and nannofossil biohorizons are shown in Figure F29 and Tables T4 and T5.  

# 5.1.1. Sampling, sample preparation, and analysis  

For nannofossil analyses, the CC section or the base of each recovered core was sampled. Sample s from other sections were included from split-core samples to better define biostratigraphi c datums or when nannofossils were not abundant in the analyzed material. Standard smear slid e methods were used for all samples, using optical adhesive as a mounting medium. Calcareous nannofossils were examined under a polarizing light microscope at $1250\times$ magnification. Abundance, preservation, and zonal data for each sample investigated were recorded in the GEODESC database.  

![](images/b410431a5367fd49fcad201f48fc8f813327321d8f3b535bb71e0ba3fea7ce82.jpg)

We followed the taxonomic concepts summarized in Takayama and Sato (1987). Calcareous nannofossil preservation was assessed as follows:  

• ${\sf G}\left({\bf g}00{\sf d}\right)=$ little or no evidence of dissolution and/or overgrowth.   
• M (moderate) $=$ minor dissolution or crystal overgrowth observed.   
• $\mathrm{P}\left({\bf p o o r}\right)=1$ strong dissolution or crystal overgrowth, many specimens unidentifiable.  

Total abundance of calcareous nannofossils for each sample was estimated as follows:  

• A (very abundant) $=>\!50$ specimens per field of view.   
$\mathrm{\Delta\C\left(common\right)=>\!10\mathrm{{-}}50}$ specimens per field of view.   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~F~}(f e w)~}{=}1–10$ specimens per field of view.   
• R (rare) $^{\mathrm{~\,~\,~}}=1$ specimen per 2 or more fields of view.  

Nannofossil abundances of individual species were recorded as follows:  

• A (abundant) $=1–10$ specimens per field of view.   
• $\mathsf{C}\left(\mathrm{common}\right)=1$ specimen per 2–10 fields of view.   
• R (rare) $^{\mathrm{~\,~\,~}}=1$ specimen per ${>}10$ fields of view.

# 5.2. Planktonic and benthic foraminifera  

The taxonomy for planktonic foraminifera follows a modified version of the phylogenetic classification of Kennett and Srinivasan (1983).

# 5.2.1. Sampling, sample preparation, and analysis  

Samples $\mathrm{^{5-10}\ c m}$ whole rounds) were prepared by manually breaking the core into small piece s followed by disaggregation and washing over a $63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh sieve to remove all mud and silt. Mor e lithified sediments were soaked in a solution of hot water and hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2};\,30\%\right)$ t o chemically disaggregate the microfossils from the sediments, and then additionally were manuall y broken down using a mortar and pestle if necessary. The washed microfossil residue retained o n the sieve was dried at low temperature $(\sim\!50^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ in a thermostatically controlled drying cabinet an d divided with a microsplitter into equal aliquots for examination. As a precaution against cross contamination, sieves were cleaned with jetted water, placed in an ultrasonic bath for $15\,\mathrm{\min}$ , dried with compressed air, and thoroughly inspected between samples.  

During examination of samples, the percentage of planktonic foraminifera relative to total foraminifera was determined quantitatively from random counts of 100 foraminifera in the 150–50 0 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grain-size fractions of washed microfossil residues. This was done to determine relative oceanicity (greater planktonic percent corresponds to greater oceanicity; Hayward et al., 1999) (Figur e F30) to identify samples with reworked material (i.e., dependent on the water depth). For planktonic foraminifera, age-diagnostic markers were picked from the $150{-}500~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grain-size fractio n and mounted onto 60-division faunal slides coated with gum tragacanth. Additionally, durin g intervals biostratigraphically subdivided by abundances shifts in Neogloboquadrina spp. (sinistral), the population ratios of sinistral and dextral coiled specimens within this genus were semiquantitatively assessed. For benthic foraminifera, the ${>}125~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grain-size fraction was examine d and $\mathord{\sim}100$ specimens were obtained and identified for environmental and paleowater depth estimations. As time allowed, other species and biogenic remains of microfossils were also picked an d mounted onto the same slides.

Specimen images were taken using a camera-mounted Zeiss SteREO Discovery V8 microscope, or  scanning electron micrographs were acquired by mounting the specimens on an SEM stub, sputter-coating them with gold-palladium alloy, and imaging them using a Hitachi TM3000 tabletop microscope and an SNE-4500M Plus SEM.  

During examination of microfossil samples, the abundance of foraminifera and other fossil group s in the $150{-}500~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ grain-size fractions of washed samples was determined visually and categorized as follows:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant (foraminifera compose ${>}50\%$ of the washed sample).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (foraminifera compose $>\!20\%{-}50\%$ of the washed sample).   
• $C=$ common (foraminifera compose $>\!5\%{-}20\%$ of the washed sample).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few (foraminifera compose $1\%{-}5\%$ of the washed sample).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (foraminifera compose ${<}1\%$ of the washed sample).   
• $\mathrm{X=}$ present (foraminifera present in sample, abundance undetermined).  

In addition, the preservation of foraminifera was categorized as follows:  

• $\mathrm{VG}=$ very good (specimens mostly whole, very well preserved ornamentation and surface ultrastructure, no visible modification of the test wall).   
• $\mathrm{G}=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (specimens often whole, ornamentation and surface ultrastructure preserved but sometimes abraded or overgrown, visible evidence of modification of the test wall).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (specimens often etched or broken, ornamentation and surface ultrastructure modified, majority of specimens identifiable to species level).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbf{r}$ (most specimens crushed or broken, recrystallized, diagenetically overgrown, or infilled with crystalline calcite; most specimens difficult to identify to species level).   
• ${\mathrm{VP}}=$ very poor (all specimens crushed or broken, recrystallized, diagenetically overgrown, or infilled with secondary minerals; most specimens difficult to identify to genus level).  

Additionally, benthic and planktonic foraminifera were examined in thin sections of lithifie d calcareous rock samples. Specimen images were taken using a camera-mounted Zeiss Axioplan.  

# 5.2.2. Planktonic foraminifera  

Planktonic foraminiferal dating was used in conjunction with calcareous nannofossil dating t o determine biostratigraphic ages. Planktonic foraminifera were also used to identify changes i n marine conditions. To achieve this goal within the available time, species with documented affinit y for warm- or cold water masses (see Crundwell et al. 2008; Aze et al. 2011; Crundwell and Woodhouse, 2022; Woodhouse et al. 2023) were used to assign tentative boundaries of marine isotop e stages to supplement biostratigraphic analyses.  

# 5.2.3. Benthic foraminifera  

Benthic foraminifera were the primary paleontological tool used for estimating paleowater depth s during the examination of samples, in collaboration with planktonic foraminiferal assemblag e abundance. Additionally, they were also used as secondary markers for biostratigraphic dating. Paleowater depth ranges were estimated on the basis of the deepest calibrated depth marker contained in each sample based on Wright (1978), van Morkhoven et al. (1986), de Stigter et al. (1998), De Rijk et al. (1999), Rasmussen et al. (2005), Spezzaferri and Tamburini (2007), and Milker et al. (2017). These analyses contributed to understanding the complex sedimentary and volcanotectonic sediments sampled during Expedition 398 that can result in uncertainties in paleowate r depth reconstructions through sediment remobilization and downslope displacement of shallowwater species (e.g., Cimerman and Langer, 1991).  

# 6. Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic analyses during Expedition 398 focused on measurement of the remanent magnetization of archive-half sections on the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) before an d after alternating field (AF) demagnetization. Our aim was to determine magnetostratigraphic ag e constraints to combine with micropaleontological datums to yield an age model for each site.  

Analyses of the archive-half sections were complemented by experiments on discrete cubic specimens taken from working-half core sections. These were subjected to stepwise AF demagnetization (usually up to $50~\mathrm{mT}$ ), although a limited number of samples were thermally demagnetize d (up to $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ ) or subjected to a combination of low-temperature demagnetization (down to 77  K using liquid nitrogen) followed by either AF or thermal treatment.  

# 6.1. Archive-half section remanent magnetizations  

Measurements of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and remanences following stepwise A F demagnetization were conducted on archive-half sections using the automated pass-through 2 G Enterprises Model 760R-4K SRM interfaced to Integrated Measurement System (IMS) SR M software (version 13.0). The SRM is equipped with direct-current superconducting quantu m interference devices (DC-SQUIDs) and an in-line automated three-axis AF demagnetizer capabl e of reaching a maximum peak field of $80~\mathrm{{mT}}$ (frequency $200\;\mathrm{Hz}$ ). The spatial resolution of remanence measurements is determined from the integrated response function of the SQUID sensor s with effective widths of $7.3\;\mathrm{cm}$ for the $x\cdot$ - and $y$ -axes and $9.0\;\mathrm{cm}$ for the $z_{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ -axis (Acton et al., 2017). The practical noise level of the SRM is $\sim\!2\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{Am}^{2}$ and is primarily controlled by the magnetization of the core liner and the background magnetization of the measurement tray.  

The sample tray was cleaned every $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ , the AF demagnetized at a peak field of $30~\mathrm{mT}$ , and it s remanence measured to monitor any changes during the expedition and to ensure accurate tra y correction values. The measurement interval and speed for processing archive-half sections wer e set to $2.0\:\mathrm{cm}$ and $10\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s}$ , respectively. A $12\,\mathrm{cm}$ long interval of empty track was measured befor e the start of the section passed the center of the pickup coils of the SQUID sensors, and an equa l interval of empty track was measured after the end of the section had passed through it. Thes e header and trailer measurements serve the dual functions of monitoring the background magneti c moment and enabling future deconvolution analysis (Xuan and Oda, 2015).  

Following an initial period of experimentation at the start of the expedition to establish the mos t appropriate demagnetization sequence to use for routine analysis, archive-half sections wer e demagnetized in AF fields of 15, 20, and $25~\mathrm{mT},$ sufficient to allow the biasing effects of an y drilling-induced magnetization on magnetic polarity to be determined to aid identification of th e distribution of magnetozones downhole. This limited demagnetization sequence fulfilled th e following requirements: (1) allowed more rapid throughput of sections through the SRM to kee p up with core flow; (2) provided sufficient data to allow principal components of magnetization t o be calculated for each measurement interval; and (3) avoided recently reported overheating problems with one of the demagnetization coils when used to produce high demagnetizing fields (up t o $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ ).  

Data collected near the ends of core sections and piece boundaries are significantly affected b y edge effects due to the width of the SQUID sensor response functions. Consequently, data point s within $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ of section ends and piece boundaries were filtered out prior to further processing. T o further reduce artifacts when measuring core samples collected by RCB drilling, any piece s smaller than $^{8}\mathrm{~cm}$ were removed from section trays prior to measuring/demagnetizing an d replaced afterward.  

Data from individual measurement points were examined on orthogonal vector plots (Zijderveld, 2013) and analyzed using the PuffinPlot software (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012). This allowed us t o automate the calculation of principal component directions of magnetization downhole to ai d determination of the distribution of magnetozones. In addition, Fisher mean directions of magnetization were calculated for each measurement interval (from the directions after demagnetizatio n at 15, 20, and $25~\mathrm{mT}$ ) to estimate inclinations in samples where only minor changes in intensit y occurred. Both principal component and Fisher mean directions were subject to statistical filtering to establish the most appropriate estimate of inclination, and the inclination at $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ was use d when no statistically acceptable alternative measure was available. This process is described i n detail in the Site U1591 chapter (see Paleomagnetism in the Site U1591 chapter [Druitt et al., 2024]).  

Mean inclinations and associated Fisher statistics were calculated using the incfish.py program i n the PmagPy package (Tauxe et al., 2016). In addition, median destructive fields (i.e., the demagnetization treatment levels at which the sample intensity is reduced to $50\%$ of its NRM value) wer e calculated using PuffinPlot (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012) to give further information on the coercivity of magnetic minerals present in the samples.  

# 6.2. Discrete sample remanent magnetizations  

Remanent magnetizations of discrete samples were measured exclusively with the AGICO JR-6 A spinner magnetometer using the automated sample holder, providing the most accurate discret e sample remanent magnetization directions and intensities. Measurements of the empty automati c sample holder after subtracting the stored holder magnetization yielded intensities on the order o f $9.0\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ , representing the practical noise limit of the system.  

Where sediments were sufficiently soft, we collected discrete $7\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples in plastic NatsuharaGiken sampling boxes pushed into the working half of the core by hand through a plastic 3- D printed jig designed to align samples with the core reference framework, with the “up” arrow o n the box pointing upsection in the core. In stiffer sediments, a stainless steel cutter was hammere d into the sediment through a second custom-made plastic 3-D printed jig, and the resulting sampl e was then extruded onto a flat surface and placed inside a Natsuhara-Giken sampling box. Thes e samples were subject to stepwise AF demagnetization.  

In more indurated sediment and hard rocks, we cut $8\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ cubes with orthogonal passes of a roc k saw with two parallel blades spaced $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ apart. These were marked with an upcore orientatio n arrow on the split core face of the cubic sample and wrapped in plastic to prevent desiccation. These lithified samples without a plastic container were suitable for both AF and thermal demagnetization.  

Stepwise AF demagnetization of discrete samples was performed using a DTech D-2000 A F demagnetizer. Samples selected for AF demagnetization were usually treated at peak fields of 10, 15, 20, 30, and $50\,\mathrm{mT}$ . Thermal demagnetization of some discrete samples was performed using a n ASC Scientific TD-48 SC thermal demagnetizer capable of heating samples up to $700^{\circ}C$ . Durin g use, samples were located in the innermost $26\;\mathrm{cm}$ of the sample chamber where the field was ${<}50$ nT, avoiding a significant field gradient toward its mouth (reaching a maximum of $120\;\mathrm{nT}$ ).  

MS was measured using the AGICO MFK2 Kappabridge after every heating step to monitor thermal alteration of magnetic minerals during heating. Low-temperature demagnetization (LTD) wa s performed on a limited number of discrete samples (Dunlop, 2003) prior to subsequent AF o r thermal demagnetization to remove secondary magnetizations. LTD involves cooling samples in  a liquid nitrogen bath (77 K) and allowing them to warm back up to room temperature in a low-fiel d environment. A suitable low-field environment was provided by a three-layer cylindrical mumetal shield.  

Characteristic remanent magnetization directions of the discrete samples were determined usin g principal component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980) using the PuffinPlot software, version 1.4.1 (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012).  

# 6.3. Anisotropy of low-field magnetic susceptibility  

In addition to standard paleomagnetic measurements, the anisotropy of low-field magnetic susceptibility (AMS) was determined for all discrete samples using an AGICO MFK2 Kappabridg e operated via AGICO SAFYR 7.5.01 software. AMS reflects the shape- or crystallographicpreferred orientations of minerals and grains (e.g., Tarling and Hrouda, 1993; Borradaile an d Jackson, 2004) or the distribution anisotropy of ferromagnetic grains (Stephenson, 1994), providing quantitative constraints on petrofabric development even in weakly deformed sediments an d rocks. Described by a second-order tensor, AMS is represented by a susceptibility ellipsoid specified by the magnitude and orientation of its principal axes $\langle k_{\mathrm{max}},k_{\mathrm{int}},$ and $k_{\mathrm{min}},$ corresponding to it s maximum, intermediate, and minimum susceptibility axes, respectively). AMS in a rock result s from contributions from all its constituent minerals but is usually dominated by the signal fro m ferromagnetic phases, when present, because of their high susceptibilities. The shape of the AM S ellipsoid is defined by the relative magnitude of the principal susceptibility axes and can be  

1. Isotropic ${}^{\prime}k_{\mathrm{min}}=k_{\mathrm{int}}=k_{\mathrm{max}})$ with no preferred alignment,   
2. Oblate $(k_{\mathrm{min}}\ll k_{\mathrm{int}}\approx k_{\mathrm{max}})$ defining a planar magnetic fabric (foliation),   
3. Prolate $(k_{\mathrm{min}}\approx k_{\mathrm{int}}\ll k_{\mathrm{max}})$ defining a linear magnetic fabric (lineation), or   
4. Triaxial $(k_{\mathrm{min}}<k_{\mathrm{int}}<k_{\mathrm{max}})$ .  

AMS ellipsoid shapes were quantified using the Jelínek and Kropáček (1978) shape parameter $(T)$ where $-1.0<T<1.0_{\circ}$ , with positive/negative values of $T$ indicating oblate/prolate fabrics, respectively. The magnitude of anisotropy is described using the corrected anisotropy degree, $P_{\mathrm{{J}}}$ (Jelínek and Kropáček, 1978), where $P_{\mathrm{J}}=1.0$ indicates an isotropic fabric and, for example, $P_{\mathrm{J}}=1.05$ indicates $5\%$ anisotropy.  

# 6.4. Sample coordinates and core orientation  

All magnetic data were initially acquired relative to the IODP core reference frame. In this system, $+x$ points into the working half, $+z$ is downcore, and $+y$ is orthogonal to $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}$ and $\boldsymbol{z}$ in a right-han d sense. Therefore, $+x$ corresponds to $000^{\circ}$ and $+y$ to $090^{\circ}$ in the core reference frame. For some AP C sediment cores, the magnetization directions and AMS principal axes were subsequently restore d to a geographic reference frame using the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool. This tool uses thre e orthogonally mounted fluxgate magnetometers to record the orientation of the magnetic tool fac e (which is collinear with the double line scribed on the core liner) relative to magnetic north. Th e tool is run on the APC BHA in a nonmagnetic core barrel. The tool declination, inclination, tota l magnetic field, and temperature are recorded on internal memory at a regular interval (typicall y 10 s). The core barrel, pipe, and BHA is kept steady for several minutes just prior to when the cor e is taken. Data recorded during this time are used to determine the core orientation. Rotation of th e core barrel is prevented using an anti-spiral key, although the core and/or core liner may twist as i t penetrates the sediments. The Icefield MI-5 tool data then provide orientation correction for th e core barrel that converts observed magnetic declinations measured in the core reference fram e $(D_{\mathrm{obs}})$ to true declinations $(D_{\mathrm{true}})$ as follows:  

$$
D_{\mathrm{true}}=D_{\mathrm{obs}}+\mathrm{MTF}+D_{\mathrm{amb}},
$$  

where MTF is the magnetic tool face angle from the Icefield MI-5 tool and $D_{\mathrm{amb}}$ is the ambien t geomagnetic field declination obtained from geomagnetic field models (Weber et al., 2021). Th e International Geomagnetic Reference Field (13th generation, Alken et al., 2021) declination for al l drill sites is $+5.0^{\circ}$ .  

# 6.5. Magnetostratigraphic dating  

Expedition 398 sites are all located at ${\sim}36.3^{\circ}{-}36.7^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ and have not undergone significant latitudinal motion, and hence reversals of the Earth’s magnetic field recorded by sampled sequences ca n be easily identified by distinct changes in inclination. Assuming a geocentric axial dipole (GAD ) geometry for the field, it is possible to calculate the field inclination, $I,$ as tan $\protect(I)=2$ tan(lat), wher e lat is the latitude. The time-averaged GAD field at a latitude of $36.5^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ is therefore expected to hav e a positive (downward) inclination of ${\sim}56^{\circ}$ . Negative inclinations indicate reversed polarity. Magnetozones identified from the shipboard data were correlated with the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS; Gradstein et al., 2020) with the aid of biostratigraphic datums.  

# 7. Physical properties  

The primary objectives of the Expedition 398 physical properties program are to collect variou s high-resolution physical properties data on cored materials that (1) identify major volcaniclasti c deposits and mass transport events; (2) constrain geothermal, geomechanical, and seismic properties of the deposits; and (3) construct composite stratigraphic correlations. In addition, physica l properties measurements provide data that assist in the characterization of lithologic units, hea t flow, fluid flow, and consolidation history. They also help with the interpretation of seismic reflection profiles and downhole geophysical logging data.  

# 7.1. Laboratory core flow  

Physical properties measurements were made in the following sequence:  

1. The pocket penetrometer (PP) was used to measure undrained compressive strength on finegrained cohesive sediment; typically, but not always, the bottom of the second to last section of each core was measured while the core was on the catwalk.   
2. Whole-round cores were measured with the NGR detector when the length of an individual section was $>\!50\;\mathrm{cm}$ .   
3. Whole-round cores were measured on the WRMSL, which includes a GRA bulk densitometer, an MS pass-through loop system, and a $P$ -wave velocity logger (PWAVE_L). The default sampling interval was set to $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ . APC cores were analyzed after equilibrating on the core deck for at least $4\,\mathrm{h}$ to reach thermal equilibrium with the laboratory (a necessary condition for $P$ -wave velocity analysis). $P$ -wave velocity was not measured on XCB and RCB cores because they do not fill the core liners; these cores could therefore be analyzed without waiting for thermal equilibrium to be reached.   
4. Whole-round cores were split.   
5. Thermal conductivity on the working half was measured with a TeKa TK04 half-space needle probe (HLQ) puck.   
6. Shear strength was measured with the automatic vane shear (AVS) system at representative locations along the working half.   
7. Discrete $P$ -wave velocity measurements were made along the working half in its core liner using the $P$ -wave gantry system. For consolidated rock, $P$ -wave velocity was measured on seawater-saturated cube samples in the $x_{\mathrm{-}},y_{\mathrm{-}}$ , and $z$ -directions.   
8. Discrete samples for shipboard moisture and density (MAD) measurements were collected from representative locations along the working half. Wet mass was measured before samples were dried at $105\mathrm{^\circC}$ for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and then cooled to room temperature in a desiccator for $3\,\mathrm{{h}}$ , after which their dry mass was obtained. Sample volumes were then obtained by helium pycnometry.  

During Expedition 398, all raw data were uploaded to the LIMS database.  

# 7.2. Whole-Round Multisensor Logger  

PWAVE_L, GRA density, and MS were measured on the WRMSL, and NGR was measured usin g the NGRL. These measurements are all nonintrusive and nondestructive. APC sections wer e passed through the WRMSL after equilibrating to laboratory temperature for at least $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ .  

The sampling interval for all WRMSL measurements was $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ , with an integration time of 3  s for each measurement. The reliabilities of WRMSL measurements were assessed by passing a single core liner filled with deionized (DI) water through the WRMSL after every core. The core line r was assumed to be completely full. Bulk density values obtained from the GRA and the MS measurements may underestimate true values if the liner is not completely full. This was the case fo r many core sections, particularly when the recovered material was sand/volcaniclastic rich. Anomalously low values of $P$ -wave velocity, MS, and bulk density also occur where there are cracks an d gaps in the core. To limit data manipulation, anomalous values were left in the raw data.  

During Expedition 398, the STMSL (i.e., “fast-track”; see Stratigraphic correlation) was onl y used at Site U1589. To enable rapid stratigraphic correlation for Hole B against Hole A, section s were run through the STMSL, measuring GRA density and MS as soon as possible. These section s then equilibrated to laboratory temperature and were remeasured with the full set of WRMS L instruments.  

# 7.2.1. Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

Bulk density is calculated by measuring the attenuation of gamma rays as they pass through th e core. Attenuation of these rays is dominated by Compton scattering and depends on the densit y and thickness of the sample. Gamma rays with energy of $0.662\,\mathrm{MeV}$ are generated by a $^{137}\!C s$ sourc e core (Evans, 1965; Harms and Choquette, 1965) and pass through the entire diameter of the core. The GRA detector records these gamma rays on a $75\:\mathrm{mm}\times75\:\mathrm{mm}$ NaI detector. The spatial resolution of the GRA detector is $<\!1\;\mathsf{c m}$ .  

Bulk density, $\uprho_{\mathrm{r}}$ , is proportional to the gamma ray count,  

$$
{\uprho}=\frac{1}{\upmu d}\ln\Bigr(\frac{I_{0}}{I}\Bigl),
$$  

where  

$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient,   
$d=$ sample diameter,   
$I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity, and   
$I=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample.  

$\upmu$ and $I_{0}$ are treated as constants obtained by calibrating the gamma ray detector with a set o f aligned aluminum cylinders of various diameters surrounded by distilled water in a sealed cor e liner that is the same as that used during coring operations. The relationship between $I,\upmu_{:}$ , and $^d$ is  

$$
\ln I=A(\upmu d)^{2}+B(\upmu d)+C,
$$  

where $A,B;$ , and $C$ are coefficients obtained from the calibration. Gamma ray counts through eac h cylinder were determined for a period of $60\;\mathrm{s}$ . The density, ${\mathsf{P}};$ , of each aluminum cylinder was 2. 7 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , and the diameter, $d_{x}$ , was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ .  

Drift was assessed by running a water standard after every core. Calibrations were performed i f deviations from the standard exceeded $2\%$ .  

# 7.2.2. Magnetic susceptibility  

The bulk MS of a material indicates its ability to produce a magnetic response to an applied external magnetic field. The relationship between the magnetic response, that is, the magnetization o r normalized magnetic moment, $M$ (unit: $\mathrm{Am}^{2}.$ ), and the external field, $H\left({\mathrm{unit}};{\mathrm{Am}}^{2}\right)$ , is  

$$
M=\kappa H,
$$  

where κ is the bulk volume MS and is dimensionless. (We report measurement values in $^{\ast}{\cal S}{\cal I}^{\prime\prime}$ t o indicate that the values in this equation are in SI units as opposed to CGS units, for which th e volume MS is a factor $\%\uppi$ smaller).  

The strength and distribution of MS can indicate the composition and properties of magneti c minerals and thus can be related to the origins of cored materials and impacts of diagenesis. Igneous materials typically have an MS a couple orders of magnitude greater than background organi c sediments and clay.  

A Bartington Instruments MS2C sensor coil with an operating frequency of $565~\mathrm{Hz}$ was used i n WRMSL instrumentation. Calibration of the instrument was preset. Spatial resolution is $4~\mathrm{{cm}}$ ; thus, if the core is not continuous over an interval greater than $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ , κ will be underestimated.  

# 7.2.3. Compressional P-wave velocity  

The compressional wave velocity sensor measures the traveltime of $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasonic wave s across the whole core while it remains in the core liner. The waves are transmitted to the core b y plastic transducer contacts connected to linear actuators. Pressure is applied to the actuators t o ensure coupling between the transducers and the core liner. Water is dripped along the outside o f the core liners to enhance the physical connection with the actuators. $P$ -wave velocity, $V,$ , is calculated by $V=d/t$ where $^d$ is the path length of the wave through the core and $t$ is the traveltime. Th e total traveltime between the transducers includes the time delay related to transducer faces an d electronic circuitry, the delay in the peak detection procedure, and the transit time through th e core liner.  

Traveltime is calculated by automated signal processing that detects the arrivals of $P$ -wave signal s to a precision of $50~\mathrm{ns}$ . The search method skips the first positive amplitude and finds the secon d positive amplitude using a detection threshold limit, typically set to $30\%$ of the maximum amplitude of the signal. It then finds the preceding zero crossing and subtracts one wave period to determine the first arrival. To avoid extremely weak signals, minimum signal strength can be se t (typically 0.02 V) and weaker signals are ignored. To avoid signal interference at the beginning o f the record from the receiver, a delay (typically $0.01\;\mathrm{ms}$ ) can be set to force the amplitude search t o begin in the quiet interval preceding the first arrival. In addition, a trigger (typically $4\mathrm{~V~}_{.}$ ) i s selected to initiate the arrival search process, and the number of waveforms to be stacked (typically 5) can also be set. A linear voltage differential transformer measures the separation of th e transducer to derive a signal path length (i.e., the core diameter). The $P$ -wave velocity is finall y calculated after correction for system propagation delay, liner thickness, and liner material velocity. The gain was adjusted throughout the expedition to maximize the number of good measurements.  

The system was calibrated with a set of plastic cylinders with a range of diameters. A water standard was run after each core to ensure the measurements remained reliable. PWAVE_L velocitie s always remained within $2\%$ of the room temperature value.  

# 7.2.4. Natural Gamma Radiation Logger  

Gamma rays are emitted from decay of 238-uranium $^{(238}\mathrm{U})$ , 232-thorium $(^{232}\mathrm{Th})$ , and 40- potassium $(^{40}\mathrm{K})$ . The NGRL measures this natural emission on whole-round cores using a syste m designed and built at IODP Texas A&M University between 2006 and 2008 (Vasiliev et al., 2011). This system was also used on all expeditions since Expedition 320.  

The NGR detection unit contains $8\,\mathrm{NaI}$ scintillator detectors, 7 plastic scintillator detectors, an d 22 photomultipliers. Lead is used for passive shielding. The NaI detectors are covered by $8\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ o f lead shielding. Half of the lead shielding closest to the NaI detectors is composed of lowbackground lead, whereas the outer half is composed of regular (i.e., virgin) lead. Low-backgroun d lead of thickness $7~\mathrm{{cm}}$ separates each NaI detector. The NGRL uses a plastic scintillator to suppress high-energy gamma and muon components of cosmic radiation by producing a cancelin g signal when these charged particles pass through the plastic scintillators. The NGRL was calibrated with $^{137}\!C s$ and $^{60}{\bf C o}$ sources and identifying peaks at $662\;\mathrm{keV}$ $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ and $1330\ \mathrm{keV}\ (^{60}\mathrm{Co})$ and using the $1170~\mathrm{keV}$ peak for verification. Calibration materials are provided by Eckert an d Ziegler Isotope Products (Valencia, California, USA).  

Gamma ray counts are summed over the range of $100{-}3000~\mathrm{keV}$ and are thus comparable wit h data collected from previous expeditions and can be directly compared with downhole loggin g data.  

The characterization of each section consisted of 8 measurements at 2 positions for a total of 1 6 measurements at $10~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals. Intrinsic spatial resolution, defined by the full-width at halfmaximum, is $17\,\mathrm{cm}$ and an edge correction was applied to measurements within $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ of the end s of each section (Vasiliev et al., 2011). The quality of the energy spectrum depends on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample, but also on the counting time, with higher times yieldin g better spectra. A previous study on pelagic sediments (i.e., very little gamma radiation activity )  

with minor amounts of siliciclastic material used the same apparatus; with counting times of $5\,\mathrm{min}$ at each position, spatial variations in natural radiation could be identified reliably and then use d for stratigraphic correlation (Vasiliev et al., 2011). Thus, we used counting times of 5 min at eac h position to ensure reliable counting statistics. Measurements made at the ends of each sectio n appear to be systematically different from adjacent measurements, even after end corrections ar e made, likely due to a combination of uncertainty in the actual position of the end of the material i n the core liner and spatial variations in the abundance of radiogenic elements.  

# 7.3. Discrete measurements  

# 7.3.1. Sediment strength  

During Expedition 398, an undrained shear strength $(S u)$ measurement was attempted in undisturbed fine-grained sediments using a PP at the base of one section per core when the core was o n the core deck to minimize drainage and provide an estimate of the undrained shear strength. Th e AVS system was used to measure strength on the working half.  

The shear strength is the resistance of a material to failure in shear. Shear stress in unconsolidate d materials is resisted only by the contact network of solid particles. Shear strength $\left(\uptau_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ is expresse d as a function of the effective normal stress at failure $\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)$ , with shear strength parameters being th e effective cohesion $\left(c^{\prime}\right)$ and friction angle $\left(\Phi^{\prime}\right)$ :  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{r}_{\mathrm{f}}=c^{\prime}+\sigma^{\prime}\tan\tan\Phi^{\prime}.}\end{array}
$$  

The shear strength parameters can be determined by means of multiple laboratory tests. $c^{\prime}$ and $\Phi^{\prime}$ are relevant in situations where the field drainage conditions correspond to the test conditions. The shear strength of a sediment under undrained conditions (i.e., pore fluid drainage does no t occur during failure) is different from that under drained conditions (i.e., pore fluid drainag e occurs).  

The undrained shear strength can be expressed in terms of total stress in the case of fully saturate d materials of low permeability (e.g., clays). The most common strength tests in shipboard laboratories are the AVS test and the penetrometer, which provide measurement of the undrained shea r strength Su (Blum, 1997).  

# 7.3.1.1. Pocket penetrometer  

A Humboldt Manufacturing PP with three different foot adapter types was used to estimate th e compressional strength of cored materials. The force required to push a cylindrical probe into sediment was measured at the bottom of a section of each core when the core arrived on the cor e deck. There were three probe adapter foot types available: 25.35, 6.4, or $2.85~\mathrm{mm}$ diameters. W e selected the foot type depending on the stiffness of the cored materials. The instrument wa s inserted parallel to the core in the $\boldsymbol z$ -direction. Three to seven measurements were made ${\sim}1~\mathrm{cm}$ from each other, and the mean was reported. The mechanical scale of compressive strength $(\Delta\sigma)$ i s in units of kilograms per square centimeter, which are converted into units of kilopascals fo r reporting as follows:  

$$
\Delta\sigma_{\mathrm{f}}(\mathrm{kPa})=98.1\times\Delta\sigma\,(\mathrm{kg/cm^{2}}).
$$  

Unconfined shear strength, $S u_{\mathrm{(penet)}},$ is approximately related to compressive strength by (e.g., Blum, 1997)  

$$
S u_{\mathrm{(penet)}}=\Delta\sigma_{\mathrm{f}}/2.
$$  

Shear strengths up to ${\sim}220\,\mathrm{kPa}$ and $1.1\,\mathrm{MPa}$ could be measured with the 6.4 or $2.85\;\mathrm{mm}$ diamete r adapters, respectively. The smallest diameter adapter was available from Hole U1589B and onward. In the LIMS database we indicate adapter type: PP_L, NA, and PP_PT, for 25.35, 6.4, or 2.8 5 mm diameters, respectively.  

# 7.3.1.2. Automatic vane shear system  

The AVS test is used to measure the undrained strength of fully saturated homogeneous finegrained sediment. The undrained shear strength was determined by inserting a four-bladed van e into the split core and rotating at a constant $9.0^{\circ}/\mathrm{min}$ to determine the torque required to shear  a cylindrical surface by the vane, which provides a measure of the peak shear strength. The vane ha s a rotation axis perpendicular to the surface of the split core. The difference in rotational strai n between the top and the bottom of a linear spring is measured using digital shaft encoders. Th e residual shear strength was taken to be the constant and lowest measured shear strength afte r reaching the peak value during the test cycle. Sampling rates were limited to one per core sectio n unless the sediment was too firm for instrument penetration or the sediment was disturbed durin g coring.  

Vane shear strength, $S u_{\mathrm{(v)}}\left(\mathbb{P}\mathbf{a}\right)$ , is calculated as follows:  

$$
S u_{\mathrm{v}}\,=\,\frac{T}{K_{\mathrm{v}}}\,=\,\frac{\Delta B}{K},
$$  

where  

$T=$ torque required to induce material failure $\left(\mathsf{N}\mathbf{\cdot}\mathsf{m}\right)$ ,   
$K_{\mathrm{v}}=$ constant depending on vane dimensions $(\mathbf{m}^{3})$ ,   
$\Delta=$ the maximum torque angle $(^{\circ})$ at failure, and   
$B=$ the spring constant that relates the deflection angle to the torque (° N∙m) (Blum, 1997).  

All measurements used a vane with blade height and diameter of $12.7\ \mathrm{mm}$ . Failure torque wa s determined by measuring the degrees of rotation of one of four torsional springs. A linear calibration equation (specified by the manufacturer) relates the rotation angle to the torque for the particular spring being used. Selection of the appropriate spring was based on the anticipated shea r strength of the material. Vane shear results were generally considered reliable for shear strengt h values less than ${\sim}150\ \mathrm{kPa}$ , above which excessive cracking and separation of the core materia l occurred. To avoid data gaps, locations where sediment strength prevented successful insertion o f the vane (hence, no measurement was made) are recorded in the LIMS database with a shea r strength value of $150\;\mathrm{kPa}$ . These $150\;\mathrm{kPa}$ database values thus indicate real shear strength value s that may be equal to or greater than $150\;\mathrm{kPa}$ .  

# 7.3.2. Compressional wave velocity  

The measurement of compressional wave ( $P_{\cdot}$ -wave) velocity was carried out on wet sediment an d rock in the working half of the split cores using the $P$ -wave gantry system. Measurements wer e conducted perpendicular to the split core surface $x_{\cdot}$ -axis) using the caliper transducers for ever y section unless core quality was compromised. $X_{}.$ -axis measurements could be performed in mos t core sections. Measurements parallel to the core ( $\scriptstyle{\boldsymbol{z}}$ -axis) and across the core $(y$ -axis) were made b y insertion of bayonet transducers and could therefore only occasionally be carried out in loose, fine-grained sediments. Sandy sediments tend to fracture when the bayonet transducers ar e inserted, preventing $P$ -wave measurement, and thus there are few $y_{-}$ and $z$ -axis data.  

For more efficient contact, DI water was applied on the lower transducer in contact with the cor e liner during $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis measurements. To protect the upper $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis caliper transducer from dirt an d damage, a piece of plastic film was placed on the split core surface.  

The system uses Panametrics-NDT Microscan delay line transducers with a frequency of $500\,\mathrm{kHz}$ . The distance between the two transducers was measured with a built-in linear variable differentia l transformer (LVDT). The $P.$ -wave passing through the sample was recorded and first arrivals wer e picked as the initial rise of the first peak using an automated procedure. Velocities were manuall y picked only in circumstances where the automated thresholds did not align with the observed firs t arrival. The $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}.$ -axis measurement of section halves includes an adjustment for the core liner o f known thickness.  

# 7.3.3. Moisture and density  

Several basic quantities of interest (e.g., water content, bulk density, grain density, porosity, an d void ratio) are measured most accurately through mass and volume determinations on discret e samples. MAD data are also used for comparison with GRA bulk density data from the WRMSL. The shipboard MAD facility on JOIDES Resolution includes a dual balance system and a hexapycnometer (i.e., six pycnometers in a single instrument).  

In undisturbed cores, 1–3 MAD samples were typically collected from each core. From APC cores, cylindrical MAD samples were extracted with a plastic syringe or metal corer, depending on th e degree of sediment consolidation. In XCB and RCB cores, fragmented domains produced by th e coring processes were sampled with forceps to minimize further core destruction. Occasionally, samples were cut from the working half of RCB cores with a saw.  

# 7.3.3.1. Dual balance system  

The dual balance system was used to measure both wet and dry masses. The two coupled analytical balances, Mettler Toledo XS204, were used to compensate for ship motion; one acted as a reference and the other for measurement of the unknown. Before weighing sample-standard pairs, the balances were “tared” to zero based on the mean of 300 measurements; this procedure wa s performed every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ . Standard weights of similar value to the sample’s weight were placed on th e reference balance and the sample was placed on the “unknown” balance. Each reported sampl e mass is the mean of 300 measurements. If the reference and sample masses differed by more tha n $2\;\mathbf{g}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the measurement was aborted and then repeated after adjusting the weights on the referenc e balance.  

# 7.3.3.2. Wet and dry mass  

Immediately after sediment samples were collected (or hard rock samples were saturated with seawater), the wet sample mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{w}}\right)$ was measured. Dry sample mass $(M_{\mathrm{d}})$ and volume $\mathbf{\nabla}(V_{\mathrm{d}})$ wer e measured after drying the samples in a convection oven for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at a temperature of $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ an d then cooling them in a desiccator for $3\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . Dry volume was measured using a helium-displacemen t pycnometer with a nominal precision of $\pm0.04~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Each reported volume value consists of a n average of three measurements.  

# 7.3.3.3. Hexapycnometer system  

The hexapycnometer system measures dry sample volume using pressurized, helium-filled chambers. At the start of the expedition and whenever the helium gas tank was changed, shipboar d technicians performed a calibration using stainless steel spheres of known volume. A batch o f samples consisted of five cells with unknowns and one cell with two stainless steel spheres (3 an d $7~\mathsf{c m}^{3},$ ). The spheres were cycled through the cells to identify any systematic error and/or instrument drift requiring recalibration. Samples should be close to $10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ because the larger the sample, the higher the precision of the method. During Expedition 398, we also performed MA D analyses on a small number of individual intact pumice clasts. To improve accuracy when measuring the volumes of the smallest $(<\!1{\mathrm{~cm}}^{3})$ of these pumice clasts, a $3~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ calibration sphere wa s added to the sample container and its volume subsequently subtracted from the measured value. Individual volume measurements were preceded by three purges of the sample chambers wit h research grade (i.e., $99.995\%$ or better) helium heated to $28\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ , followed by three data acquisitio n cycles.  

# 7.3.3.4. Calculation of densities and porosity  

For calculation of sediment bulk density, dry density, grain density, porosity, and void ratio, th e traditional ODP method is used (“Method C,” Blum [1997]). Water content, porosity, and voi d ratio are defined by the mass or volume of extracted water before and after removal of interstitia l pore water through the drying process.  

Water content was determined following the methods of the American Society for Testing an d Materials (ASTM) designation D2216 (ASTM, 1990). Corrections are required for salt whe n measuring the water content of marine samples. For these, a pore water salinity, $S_{i}$ , of $0.035\%_{00}$ an d density of $1.024\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were used. The salt content of the pore fluid is calculated as follows:  

$$
M_{\mathrm{salt}}\,=\,\frac{S(M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})}{1-S},
$$  

where  

$M_{\mathrm{s}}=$ mass of salt, $\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{w}}=}\end{array}$ sample wet mass, and $\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{d}}}=$ sample dry mass.  

Grain density, $\mathsf{\nabla}\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{g}},$ is obtained from the dry mass and dry volume measurements:  

$$
\uprho_{\mathrm{g}}\,=\,\frac{M_{\mathrm{d}}-M_{\mathrm{salt}}}{V_{\mathrm{d}}-\Bigl(\displaystyle\frac{M_{\mathrm{salt}}}{\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}}}\Bigr)}\,,
$$  

where $\mathsf{\rho}_{\mathrm{p_{salt}}}=$ density of salt $(2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ).  

The mass of pore water, $M_{\mathrm{pw}},$ removing the mass of salt, is  

$$
M_{\mathrm{pw}}\,=\,\frac{M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{d}}}{1-S}\,.
$$  

The volume of pore water, $V_{\mathrm{pw}},$ is then  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}\,=\,\frac{M_{\mathrm{pw}}}{\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}}\,=\,\frac{M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{d}}}{(1-S)\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}},
$$  

where $\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}$ is the density of pore water (assumed to be $1.024\;\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ ).  

The bulk volume of the wet sample is $V_{\mathrm{b}}=V_{\mathrm{d}}+V_{\mathrm{pw}},$ so that the bulk density is  

$$
\uprho_{\mathrm{b}}\,=\,\frac{M_{\mathrm{b}}}{V_{\mathrm{b}}}\,,
$$  

and the (connected) porosity is  

$$
\phi\;=\;\frac{V_{\mathrm{pw}}}{V_{\mathrm{b}}}.
$$  

# 7.3.4. Thermal conductivity  

Thermal conductivity measures the ability of a material to transfer heat by conduction. It is used, in combination with measurements of temperature, to calculate heat flow. Its value also depend s on composition, porosity, and structure and thus complements the other physical property measurements.  

All measurements were made after the core had equilibrated with the ambient temperature in th e laboratory. Thermal conductivity was measured on seawater-saturated split cores from the working half (sample size $\geq\!6\;\mathsf{c m}$ ) using the TeKa TK04 system described in Blum (1997). Half-spac e determinations of thermal conductivity were made using standard HLQ pucks (number H11060 ) and mini needle probe pucks (number H51033). The mini-puck was used when the samples wer e cracked into pieces that were too small for the standard puck or did not sufficiently fill the cor e liner to enable good contact between the puck and the sample. The pucks, which are designed fo r planar surfaces, consist of a Plexiglas block $(k=0.184\;\mathrm{W/[m.K]})$ with a needle probe embedded i n its base. Heat is assumed to be transferred through the sample, and the TeKa TK04 documentatio n indicates that heat flow through the Plexiglas block itself is only significant for samples with thermal conductivities ${<}1\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ . Heating power can be adjusted for each sample depending on th e type of HLQ puck being used; heating power can be varied from 1 to $1.6\:\mathrm{W/m}$ for a standard puc k and from 0.5 to $1.2\:\mathrm{W/m}$ for a mini-puck. For most samples, a heating power close to $1.2\:\mathrm{W/m}$ fo r a standard puck and $0.8\:\mathrm{W/m}$ for a mini-puck were used. These values were adjusted as needed t o ensure stable measurements. Prior to measurements, a test was performed on a standard o f MACOR plastic with $k=1.626\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m{\cdotK}})\pm2\%$ . Measured values were within $3\%$ .  

At steady state, thermal conductivity $(k)$ is the coefficient of heat transfer $(q)$ across a steady-stat e temperature difference $(\Delta T)$ over a distance $(\Delta x)$ :  

$$
q=k(\Delta T/\Delta x).
$$  

The temperature of the superconductive needle probe has a quasilinear relationship with the natural logarithm of the time after the initiation of heating (Blum, 1997). The TeKa TK04 device use s a special approximation method to calculate conductivity and to assess the fit of the heating curve. This method fits discrete windows to the theoretical function of temperature $(T)$ with time $\r(t)$ fo r a constantly heated line source (Kristiansen, 1982):  

$$
T(t)=\mathrm{A_{1}}+\mathrm{A_{2}}\ln(t)+\mathrm{A_{3}}[\ln(t)/t]+(\mathrm{A_{4}}/t),
$$  

where $\mathrm{A}_{1-4}$ are constants that are calculated by linear regression. $\mathrm{A}_{1},\mathrm{A}_{3},$ and $\mathrm{A}_{4}$ are related to th e sample geometry and the material properties surrounding the needle probe, and $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ is related t o the heating power and thermal conductivity. Having determined these constants (and how wel l they fit the data), the apparent conductivity, $k_{\alpha},$ for the fitted curve is time dependent:  

$$
k_{\mathrm{a}}(t)\,=\,\frac{Q}{4\pi}\bigg(\mathrm{A}_{2}+\mathrm{A}_{3}\bigg[1-\frac{\ln(t)}{t}\bigg]-\frac{\mathrm{A}_{4}}{t}\bigg),
$$  

where $Q$ is the input heat flux. The maximum value of $k_{\upalpha}$ and the time $\left(t_{\mathrm{max}}\right)$ at which it occurs o n the fitted curve are used to assess the validity of that time window for calculating the therma l conductivity. The best solutions are those where $t_{\mathrm{max}}$ is greatest, and these solutions are selecte d for use. Data are considered good if $k_{\upalpha}$ has a maximum value, $t_{\mathrm{max}}$ is large, and the standard deviation of the least-squares fit is low. For each heating cycle, several output values can be used t o assess the quality of the data, including the natural logarithm of $t_{\mathrm{max}},$ which should be large, an d the contact value, which assesses contact resistance between the probe and the sample and shoul d be small and uniform for repeated measurements. For each sample, three thermal conductivit y measurements (and occasionally two when one was of insufficient quality) were made, and th e reported values are the mean of all measurements on the sample.  

Reported data are not corrected to in situ conditions. The effect of increasing pressure is t o increase thermal conductivity, $k$ . The pressure correction is about $+1\%$ for each $1800\;\mathrm{m},$ , assumin g a hydrostatic pressure gradient (Ratcliffe, 1960). The effect of temperature is more complicated. The thermal conductivity of the matrix solids is inversely proportional to temperature (Zoth an d Haenel, 1988). In contrast, the thermal conductivity of water increases with temperature (Keena n et al., 1978). The temperature correction for each $+20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ change in temperature can be as high a s $+5\%$ for a high-porosity, water-saturated sediment (Ratcliffe, 1960), and $-3\%$ for hard rocks (Clark, 1966). These corrections are similar to the TeKa TK04 measurement uncertainty of $5\%$ durin g routine evaluation.  

# 7.4. Downhole temperature measurements  

Depending on the coring system being used, one of two temperature measurement tools wer e deployed. In situ temperature measurements were made with the APCT-3 tool when the APC system was deployed. In consolidated sediments, the Sediment Temperature 2 (SET2) tool was used. Downhole temperature measurements helped to determine which logging tool string suites coul d be safely deployed.  

# 7.4.1. Advanced piston corer temperature tool  

The APCT-3 thermistor tool fits directly into the coring shoe of the APC coring system and ca n therefore be used to measure formation temperatures during regular piston coring. The tool consists of a battery pack, a data logger, and a platinum thermistor probe (Model YSI 55032) calibrated over a temperature range from $-5^{\circ}$ to $55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with an accuracy of $\pm0.02^{\circ}C.$ . Before entering th e borehole, the tool is first held at the mudline for 5 min to thermally equilibrate and to estimate th e bottom water temperature. However, the lowest temperature recorded during the run was occasionally used as an estimate of the bottom water temperature instead of the average temperature a t the mudline because (1) it was more repeatable and (2) the bottom water is expected to have th e lowest temperature in the profile. When the APCT-3 tool is inserted into the formation, there is  a rapid temperature rise from frictional heating. This heat gradually dissipates into the surroundin g sediment as the temperature within the APCT-3 tool and adjacent sediment equilibrate to th e temperature of the surrounding sediment volume. After the APCT-3 tool penetrates the sediment, it is held in place for ${\sim}10$ min while it records the temperature of the cutting shoe every 1 s. Detail s of its calibration and testing are described by Heesemann et al. (2006).  

The recorded evolution of temperature is fit to a theoretical solution to the temperature evolutio n using TP-Fit software (Fisher et al., 2007). The calculated temperature depends on thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat capacity of the surroundings. Uncertainties in these therma l properties dominate the uncertainty in the recovered temperature. Typical uncertainties in temperature are ${<}0.15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# 7.4.2. Sediment temperature tool  

Formation temperatures are measured using a thermistor in the SET2 tool that records actual i n situ temperature and is located ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{cm}$ from the probe tip. The thermistor is calibrated for a temperature range of $-2^{\circ}$ to $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ with an accuracy of $\pm0.002^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Once the tool is retrieved, the data ar e downloaded and processed on the ship using TP-Fit software (Fisher et al., 2007). The probe ti p contains both the data logger and the thermistor string and is designed to enter the sediment wit h minimal disturbance. The probe tip design and high-strength stainless steel construction survive s penetration into highly consolidated sediment and contact with igneous rock. The $8\,\mathrm{mm}$ spherica l probe tip tapers upward at an angle of $5^{\circ}$ to minimize mechanical disturbance of the soil and th e tendency to crack the formation upon penetration by the tool. The SET2 tool is deployed by th e motion decoupled hydraulic delivery system (MDHDS).

# 8.1. Headspace gas analysis  

One sample per sediment core ( $9.5\mathrm{~m~}$ advance) or one sample every other core for half-lengt h cores $\mathrm{^4.7~m}$ advance) was routinely taken for headspace hydrocarbon gas analysis as part of th e standard shipboard safety monitoring procedure as described in Kvenvolden and McDonal d (1986) and updated by Pimmel and Claypool (2001). Regular shipboard monitoring of the hydrocarbon content of the cores ensured an assessment of the probable risks of an uncontrolled releas e of hydrocarbons while drilling. This risk assessment is determined by the $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratio (methane/ethane) and the temperature of the sediments at depth, measured by temperature sensor s during coring (Figure F31).  

About $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was collected from cores immediately after sectioning on the catwal k using a cork borer in soft sediments and a metal spatula for harder material. The samples wer e usually taken at the top of the section adjacent to the IW whole-round sample (cf. IW whole-roun d sample in Figure F32). After sampling, the sediments were placed in a $20\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass vial and seale d with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/silicon septum and a crimped aluminum cap. Each via l containing a headspace sample was placed in an oven at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ . A $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ aliquot of th e released hydrocarbon gases was then extracted from the headspace vial with a gas-tight syring e and manually injected into an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) set at $300^{\circ}C$ for rapid estimation of methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ content. For these analyses, capillary columns DB-1 (123-1015, DB-1, $5.0\ \mathrm{m}\times0.32\ \mathrm{mm}\times1.0\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ ) and AL/S (19091P-S12, HP-AL/S, $25\;\mathrm{m}\times0.32\;\mathrm{mm}\times8.0\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ were used. The GC oven program was set to remain at $35\mathrm{^\circC}$ for $4~\mathrm{min}$ with a subsequent rise t o  

$200^{\circ}C$ at $25^{\circ}C/\mathrm{min}$ , and then was kept isothermal for $5~\mathrm{min}$ , resulting in a total run time of 15. 6 min. For these analyses, helium was used as the carrier gas. The results were processed using th e Agilent ChemStation data software package.  

The chromatographic response was calibrated using nine different gas standards containin g known variable concentrations of low molecular weight hydrocarbons. One of these standards wa s checked every day before headspace gas analysis to ensure correct response from the FID. Thi s standard measurement was also preceded by a blank analysis to verify the absence of a residua l signal from the GC. Concentrations of hydrocarbon gases are reported as parts per million b y volume (ppmv). The detection limit of the FID detector is $^{\sim1}$ ppmv, and the measurement uncertainty is ${\sim}2\%$ of the measured value.  

# 8.2. Interstitial water geochemistry  

# 8.2.1. Shipboard processing  

Whole-round core samples of unconsolidated materials, generally $5{-}10\,\mathrm{cm}$ long (IW whole-roun d sample in Figure F32), were partitioned immediately after the core was brought on deck, capped, and taken to the laboratory for pore fluid processing. After extrusion from the core liner, contamination from seawater and sediment smearing was removed by scraping the sample surface with  a spatula. The sample was placed into a titanium squeezer (modified after Manheim and Sayles, 1974) and compressed using a laboratory hydraulic press. The squeezed pore fluids were filtere d through a prewashed Whatman No. 1 filter placed in the squeezers above a titanium mesh screen. Approximately $40~\mathrm{mL}$ of pore fluid was collected in precleaned plastic syringes attached to th e squeezing assembly and subsequently filtered through a $0.45\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ Whatman Puradisc polyethersulfone (PES) disposable filter. For several samples, such as samples with high ash and water content, Rhizon samplers were used instead of titanium squeezers (Rhizosphere Research Products, Wageningen, The Netherlands). Rhizon samplers were presoaked in DI water and inserted into th e sediment, and the first $1~\mathrm{mL}$ of extracted IW was discarded as waste to remove potential contaminants or residual DI in the sampler.

After fluids were extracted, the squeezer parts were cleaned with shipboard water and rinsed wit h DI water. Parts were dried thoroughly with compressed air prior to reuse.  

Sample allocation was determined based on the pore fluid volume recovered and on analytica l priorities based on the expedition objectives. The IW extracted from the compressed sedimen t sample was divided into aliquots (in priority order) for the following analyses:  

• $3\;\mathrm{mL}$ for salinity, alkalinity, and pH;   
• $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for ion chromatography (IC) analysis of major anions and cations; • $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for ICP-AES analysis of major, minor, and trace elements; and • $5{-}10+\mathrm{mL}$ for postexpedition analysis.  

# 8.2.2. Shipboard interstitial water analyses  

# 8.2.2.1. Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately after IW extraction, following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinity was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensate d handheld refractometer (Fisher Model S66366). A transfer pipette was used to transfer 2 drops o f IW to the salinity refractometer, and the corresponding salinity was recorded in the log book.  

The pH was measured with a combination glass electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gra n titration with an autotitrator (Metrohm 794 Basic Titrino) using $0.1\,\mathrm{M}$ HCl at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ . Internationa l Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater was used as  a check standard and was analyzed at the beginning and end of the sample set for each site and afte r every 10 samples. Repeated measurements of IAPSO standard seawater alkalinity yielded a precision $<\!0.8\%$ .  

# 8.2.2.2. Ion chromatography  

Interstitial water samples were analyzed on board for major anions (i.e., $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ , ${\mathrm{SO}}_{4}^{\ 2-}$ , and $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ ) an d major cations (i.e., $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ , ${\bf{M}}{\bf{g}}^{2+}$ , and ${\bf K}^{+}$ ) using a Metrohm 850 ion chromatograph equippe d with a Metrohm 858 Professional sample processor as an autosampler following the protocols i n Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation. Interstitial water was diluted 1:100 with $18.2\;\mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm}$ DI water prior to ion chromatograph y analysis. Precision and accuracy were monitored using IAPSO standard seawater with the following composition: alkalinity $(2.353~\mathrm{mM})$ ), Ca $\left(10.54\mathrm{~mM}\right)$ , $\mathrm{Mg}$ $(54.1~\mathrm{mM})$ ), K $(10.46~\mathrm{mM})$ , Sr (93. 0 $\upmu\mathrm{M})$ , sulfate $(28.94~\mathrm{mM})$ , Cl $(559.6\;\mathrm{mM})$ ), Na $(480.7\ \mathrm{mM})$ , and Li $(26.4~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ . Diluted IAPSO standard seawater was analyzed every 10 unknown samples as a check standard. During Expeditio n 398, repeated values for check standards were generally within $4\%$ .  

# 8.2.2.3. ICP-AES major and minor elements  

A $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ aliquot of interstitial water from each sample was acidified immediately with 2 drops o f ultrapure $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ after squeezing and analyzed on an Agilent Technologies 5110 spectrometer ICPAES for major (i.e., S, Ca, Mg, K, and Na) and minor (i.e., B, Ba, Fe, Li, Mn, P, Si, and Sr) elements. The general method for shipboard ICP-AES analysis is described in ODP Technical Note 2 9 (Murray et al., 2000) and the user manuals for shipboard instrumentation, with modifications a s indicated.  

The ICP-AES plasma was ignited at least $20\ \mathrm{min}$ before each sample run to allow the instrumen t to warm up and stabilize. Blanks and standard solutions of known concentrations were added t o each analytical run. The raw intensity values were corrected for instrument drift and blank values.  

Drift correction was applied to each element by linear interpolation between the drift-monitorin g solutions. Whenever possible, multiple wavelength analyses of an element were performed, an d wavelengths generating the least scatter and smallest deviations from the certified standard value s were selected. The wavelengths performed for each major and minor element in the IW sample s and the wavelength selected for reporting the analytical data of each element are shown in Tabl e T7. Major and minor elements were run in triplicate for both unknowns and standards.  

Splits of $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of samples and standards were diluted with a $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ internal standard (i.e., Be, In, Sb, and Sc) and $4.4\;\mathrm{mL}$ $2\%$ trace-metal grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . With every batch run for major elements (i.e., S, Ca, Mg, K, and Na), a 7-point calibration curve was created using different dilution levels o f IAPSO seawater. For minor elements (i.e., B, Ba, Fe, Li, Mn, P, Si, and Sr), an 8-point calibratio n curve was created using synthetic, acidified seawater spiked with minor elements from SPE X CertiPrep stock solutions diluted to varying degrees. Calibration curves were used to conver t background-corrected intensities to concentrations. The IAPSO dilutions for the major elemen t calibration curve were also included in the trace element calibration curve for the trace element s with detectable concentrations. All standards were analyzed at the beginning of the run to construct a calibration curve using the Agilent software. Four standards (IAPSO and in-house) wer e run every 10 samples to monitor drift and precision of each element throughout the run. Durin g Expedition 398, relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeated check standards was better than $3\%$ for the majority of elements. Iron and phosphorus were below the detection limit in a majority of samples.  

# 8.3. Sediment bulk geochemistry  

# 8.3.1. Shipboard processing  

A portion of the squeeze cakes produced when compressing the sediments for interstitial wate r extraction were freeze-dried for ${\sim}24~\mathrm{h}$ to remove water and then ground to powder to ensur e homogenization. This powder aliquot was used for sediment bulk geochemical analyses.  

# 8.3.2. Sapropel Identification  

For units described as organic rich and suspected to be sapropels (e.g., Kroon et al., 1998), sample s were collected from the working half of the core for bulk geochemical analyses to calculate tota l organic carbon (TOC) values. Following Kidd et al. (1978), units with TOC values $>2\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ wer e termed “sapropels” and TOC values of $0.5{-}2~\mathrm{wt}\%$ were termed “sapropelitic.” TOC values wer e used to identify organic-rich units as sapropels.  

# 8.3.3. Sediment geochemistry  

# 8.3.3.1. Carbonate content  

The carbonate-associated carbon content of the samples (also referred to as total inorganic carbo n [TIC]) was determined using a Metrohm CM5017 coulometer. About $11~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment wa s placed in a heated glass vial and reacted with $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of 1 M HCl at $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The evolved $C O_{2}$ wa s backtitrated to a colorimetric end point. Analytical reproducibility was determined by replicat e measurements of selected samples. A verification external standard (i.e., $100\,\mathrm{wt}\%\,\mathrm{CaCO}_{3})$ ) was ru n every 10 samples. Analyses would only continue if standard values were $98–102\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Carbonat e content, reported as weight percent, was calculated from the TIC content based on the assumption that all TIC exists as $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ :

All $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was assumed to derive from dissolution of $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ . No corrections were made for othe r carbonate minerals.  

# 8.3.3.2. Total carbon, total organic carbon, and nitrogen  

Total carbon (TC) and nitrogen (N) content was determined using a Thermo Electron Flas h EA-1112 Series elemental analyzer equipped with a Thermo Electron packed GC column carbonhydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS)/nitrogen-carbon-sulfur (NCS) analyzer and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Bulk powder, ${\sim}12~\mathrm{mg}$ , was weighed into a tin capsule and combusted in a n oxygen gas stream at $950^{\circ}C$ . After the reduction of nitrogen oxides to $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ the mixture of gases (i.e., $\mathrm{N}_{2},\mathrm{CO}_{2},\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O},\mathrm{SO}_{2})$ was separated by gas chromatography and detected by TCD.  

Calibration for the elemental analyzer was based on Standard 2704, Buffalo River sediment $\left\langle\boldsymbol{C}=\right\rangle$ $3.35\%$ , $\Nu=0.172\%{-}0.18\%$ . Analytical reproducibility was determined by replicate measurement s of this standard every 10 samples. During Expedition 398, RSD for repeated check standards wa s better than $10\%$ for $_\mathrm{N}$ and better than $1.7\%$ for C. TOC was determined as the difference betwee n TC and TIC measured by coulometry:  

$$
\mathrm{TOC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%)=\mathrm{TC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%)\mathrm{~-~}\mathrm{TIC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%).
$$  

# 8.4. Igneous and volcaniclastic bulk geochemistry  

# 8.4.1. Shipboard processing  

Volcaniclastic sediments and ash layers identified as regions of interest were sampled by scooping, whereas lapilli-sized pumice clasts were hand-picked, targeting a total sample volume of $\{{\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}}$ . Volcaniclastic sediments and ashes were freeze-dried $(10{-}12\ \mathrm{h})$ . The samples were ground to  a fine powder in the SPEX 8530 Shatterbox.  

Each sample and standard was weighed on a Cahn C-31 microbalance to make $100.0\,\pm\,0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ splits; weighing errors were estimated to be $\pm0.05~\mathrm{mg}$ under relatively smooth sea-surface conditions. Splits of ignited whole-rock powders were mixed with $400.0\,\pm\,0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ flux (preweighed on shore). During each ICP-AES analysis, standard rock powders and full procedura l blanks were interspersed with unknowns (among the elements reported, contamination from th e tungsten carbide mills is negligible) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003).  

Aqueous LiBr solution ( $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $0.172~\mathrm{mM}$ LiBr) was added to the flux and rock powder mixtur e as a nonwetting agent prior to sample fusion to prevent the fused bead from sticking to the crucible during cooling. Samples were fused individually in Pt-Au (95:5) crucibles for ${\sim}12$ min at a maximum temperature of $1050^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in an internally rotating induction furnace (Bead Sampler TK-4100).  

The beads were transferred into $125~\mathrm{mL}$ high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles and dissolve d in a $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ solution containing $10\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . The solution bottle was placed in a Burrell wrist-actio n shaker for $1\,\mathrm{~h~}$ to aid dissolution. Next, $20~\mathrm{mL}$ increments of the solution were passed through  a $0.45\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ filter into a clean $60\;\mathrm{mL}$ wide-mouth HDPE bottle. From the filtered solution, $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ wa s pipetted into a scintillation vial and diluted with $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ of dissolution solution containing $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . Internal standard solution containing Be, In, and Sb $(100\,\upmu\mathrm{L})$ was added into each vial. Th e final solution-to-sample dilution factor was 5000; this solution was used to analyze both major an d trace elements.  

# 8.4.2. ICP-AES major and trace elements  

Major and trace element concentrations of standards and samples were determined using an Agilent 5110 ICP-AES instrument. Certified international rock reference materials, calibration an d drift solutions, and chemical procedure blanks were included with the unknown samples for eac h sample run (Table T7). Detection limits were calculated as three times the standard deviation o f the mean for blank solution measurements.  

The ICP-AES plasma was ignited at least $20\ \mathrm{min}$ before each sample run to allow the instrumen t to warm up and stabilize. The ICP-AES data presented in the rock geochemistry sections for eac h site were acquired using Agilent’s ICP Expert software. The intensity curve for each element i s defined by 20 measurements within the designated wavelength window. The ICP Expert softwar e integrates the area delineated by the baseline and the intensity curve. Each sample was analyze d three times from the same dilute solution in a given sample run.  

A set of six certified rock standards were chosen for their wide range in composition to calibrat e the analyses (Table T8; Figures F33, F34): basalts BHVO-2 and BCR-2; andesites JA-1 and AGV1; and rhyolites JR-1 and RGM-1. As many as 25 unknown samples were analyzed during a singl e run. A $10\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ wash solution was run for $90\,\mathrm{s}$ between each sample analysis. Estimates of accuracy and precision of major and trace element analyses were based on replicate analyses of tw o international standards, basalt BHVO-2 and granodiorite JG-3, run every four samples. Durin g Expedition 398, run-to-run RSD by ICP-AES was typically $\pm1\%$ for major elements and $\pm5\%{-}10\%$ for trace elements. Repeated procedural blanks were used to determine detection limits.  

# 8.4.3. ICP-AES data reduction  

All analyses were corrected first for drift. A drift correction was applied to each element based o n the internal standard containing Be, In, and Sb. Concentrations used for the calibrations wer e compiled values from the literature. Total iron oxide concentrations were reported as $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}^{\mathrm{t}}$ . Element concentrations in the samples were calculated from the relevant calibration lines.

# 9. Microbiology  

The microbiology team collected samples from the deep subsurface of the Santorini caldera a t Sites U1595 and U1596 and from the Anafi Basin at Sites U1599 and U1600. Because sampling fo r microbiology is delicate in terms of identifying suitable sampling material and avoiding contamination, we focused on samples showing specific geochemical and physicochemical characteristic s (e.g., differences in color, temperature, and so on) and made ad hoc decisions while the core wa s being delivered to the core receiving platform (i.e., catwalk). Special emphasis was placed on dar k black-green and red, iron-rich layers. In total, we collected 50 samples for all four sites.  

During Expedition 398, we collected samples from sediments and volcaniclastics. Εmphasis wa s placed on sediment sampling. Some representative pumice samples were collected.  

Samples were processed and prepared for shore-based molecular-based phylogenetic studies an d metagenomic analysis (DNA), cultivation assays (prokaryote cultivation experiments), microscopic observation of cells and cell counts, and contamination tests. Our efforts were dedicated t o collecting and preserving an adequate number of samples for further shore-based studies; no shipboard analyses were performed.  

# 9.1. Sampling  

For the most part, the sampling strategy was based on the methods of Expedition 376 (de Ronde e t al., 2019). Microorganisms collected were expected to be sensitive to chemical and physica l changes when brought to the surface. Changes in oxygen concentration and temperature are tw o important factors that were considered. Thus, the following procedures were followed to minimize harm to subsurface microorganisms.  

For microbiological studies, whole-round samples were required to have sufficient material t o work with to enable proper cleaning and avoid contamination introduced by sample handlin g before and during the core splitting process. Gloves and face masks were used when samplin g whole rounds from the catwalk, and the split core liner was sprayed with $70\%$ ethanol to minimiz e the chances of contamination. The microbiologists and the geologists taking part in sample selection wore gloves sprayed with ethanol to limit possible contamination of the sample from huma n contact. The microbiologists wore closed-sleeve laboratory coats. The lead microbiologis t selected a whole-round section for sampling in accordance with the Co-Chief Scientist on shift o r the Staff Scientist. An ideal sample was one that consisted largely of intense dark green-black o r red sediments that had not split apart during recovery and did not have a unique lithology tha t would be critical to the core description team. The whole-round core sample chosen for microbiology was transferred immediately into a sterile Whirl-Pak bag and transported to the microbiology laboratory for further processing. In the microbiology laboratory, the whole-round sampl e was transferred immediately into the hard-shell anaerobic chamber (COY anaerobic chambe r rigid glove box with purge airlock, COY Laboratory Products Inc.) (Figure F35). The outside o f each core was sprayed three times with $70\%$ ethanol.  

Prior work has shown that the interior of rock cores is generally free from contamination (Lever e t al., 2006). Therefore, efforts were made to sample only the interior of the cores. Sections that displayed soft material or were organically enriched were chosen because these were the most likel y locations to support microbial life.  

![](images/d37344b04b645d8edfc4d684372afea6de3f91bc0094aaaea31f37816d8a0bbd.jpg)  
Figure F35. COY anaerobic chamber, Expedition 398.  

On average, microbiology samples were ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{cm}$ long. Sample material was divided into subsample s for a variety of tests, which included the following:  

• DNA-based metagenetic analysis,   
• DNA-based metagenomic analysis,   
• Cell counts,   
• Microscopy,   
• Aerobic cultures in liquid medium and agar plates, and • Anaerobic cultures.  

After cleaning the exterior of whole-round samples, the core interiors were subsampled for th e above-mentioned tests using either sterile syringes of $60~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ and $20~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ or ethanol-sterilize d stainless-steel spatula, chisel, and hammer (Figures F36 and F37). The whole-round core remaining after subsampling was stored at $4^{\circ}C$ .  

Following completion of sample processing, all tools and the chamber were cleaned with DI water, sprayed with $75\%$ ethanol, wiped with Kimwipes, sprayed with $75\%$ ethanol again, and allowed t o air dry.  

# 9.2. Contamination testing of drilling fluid  

Samples of the drilling fluid were collected for microbial community small subunit ribosoma l RNA gene diversity analysis during drilling. These samples were collected directly from the injection pipe on the rig floor into sterile bottles. Any organisms found to be present in both the drillin g fluid and rock samples will be considered a sign of contamination.  

The Aegean Sea is an oligotrophic environment, and the microbial abundances in the surfac e waters are extremely low, so we do not expect contamination issues. However, in the case tha t some organisms are present in the drilling fluid and are observed during postcruise analyses, the y will be excluded from further analysis. Following previous expedition methodology (i.e., Expedition 376), this conservative approach is the most appropriate one.  

To measure contamination, ${\sim}500~\mathrm{mL}$ of drilling fluid was collected and filtered on board onto 4 5 $\operatorname*{mm}\,0.22\,{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ pore-sized polycarbonate membrane filters and kept frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-base d DNA extraction and analysis.  

![](images/388e849ea24f599e7fe6dd656cd96d91a1b96494aac687b9b39e5354ed302dd6.jpg)  
Figure F36. Whole-round sample after subsampling of interior for microbiology, Expedition 398.  

Samples of drilling mud (i.e., sepiolite) were also collected on the rig floor prior to injection int o the drill pipe in two sterile $50~\mathrm{mL}$ polypropylene centrifuge tubes and frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shorebased DNA extraction.  

# 9.3. Subsample preparation  

# 9.3.1. Cell counts and microscopic examination  

A subsample of ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was placed into a $15\;\mathrm{mL}$ plastic tube (Falcon type) with $8.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of filtere d sterile seawater collected from the drilling site, fixed with $3\%\left(\mathrm{v/v}\right)$ buffered formalin (final concentration), and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until analysis in the laboratory for total microbial cell counts.  A subsample of ${\sim}1.5~\,\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ was placed in small $2~\mathrm{mL}$ vials and frozen at $4^{\circ}C$ for further electro n microscopy investigation of microbial cells on shore.  

# 9.3.2. Cultivation experiments  

Culture-based techniques using different substrates and conditions were also applied in a n attempt to isolate microorganisms from the deeper layers of Santorini caldera (Figure F38). Special emphasis was given to iron-related bacteria to further investigate their potential in the biological Fe cycling. Both aerobic and anaerobic conditions were investigated. From each round core,  a subsample of ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ was placed into a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ sterile Falcon tube and anaerobically stored at $4^{\circ}C$ for shore-based analysis. A subsample of $1.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ was used for aerobic cultivation on board using  a laminar flow hood. The material was placed into $15\,\mathrm{\mL}$ Falcon tubes containing sterile 9 K medium, which is rich in $\mathrm{Fe^{+2}}$ and stored at $16^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for onboard and shore-based cultivation experiments. Onboard experiments were performed using sterile Petri dishes with 9K agar mediu m already prepared by the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR) using the streak plat e method.  

# 9.3.3. Molecular biology-DNA  

For DNA analyses, we collected $50\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment and froze it at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . These samples will b e analyzed during postcruise research for molecular-based phylogenetic studies and metagenomi c analysis. In addition, in some cases, mudline water was collected for microbial community analysi s to be used for comparison.

# 9.4. Storage and shipment conditions  

All sediment cores and rocks for molecular analyses were placed in sterile tubes and bags an d stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The slurry samples for aerobic cultivation were stored at room temperature. Th e slurry samples for anaerobic cultivation were stored under anaerobic conditions at $4^{\circ}C$ .  

# 10. Downhole logging  

Downhole wireline logging data help characterize subseafloor lithologies and their structures. It i s especially useful to fill gaps at depth intervals where recovery is poor (e.g., lapilli-rich units o r depths cored with XCB and RCB coring) and to compare shipboard and in situ measurements.  A suite of downhole logging tools provides continuous physical properties data in situ at samplin g intervals ranging from $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ to $0.15\,\mathrm{m}$ . The acquired data help with interpretation of whole-hol e lithostratigraphy, formation fluid properties, and measured temperatures. Downhole logging dat a are ultimately used to conduct multiscale correlations of data acquired throughout and beyon d Expedition 398 by bridging measurements on discrete sample/whole and/or half core and variou s regional-scale data, including seismic reflection records.  

During Expedition 398, one wireline logging run was conducted in Hole U1589C, which yielde d three paths. We adhered to a standard open-hole logging approach established by Schlumberge r and throughout scientific ocean drilling on JOIDES Resolution. Prior to the logging operations, th e formation temperature was deemed sufficiently low for logging. This was checked by the followin g tools:  

• APCT-3 (soft sediments) and • SET2/sediment temperature pressure tool (SETP) (consolidated sediments).  

In  Hole  U1589C,  we  deployed  the  standard  suites  of  downhole  logging  tool s (http://iodp.tamu.edu/tools/logging). The triple combination (triple combo) tool string deployed in Hole U1589C consisted of the following tools (top to bottom) (also see Table T9):  

• LEH-QT (logging equipment head-Q tension).   
• EDTC (Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge).   
• HNGS (Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde).   
• HLDS (Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde with source and caliper).   
• HRLA (High-Resolution Laterolog Array).  

• MSS (Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde—third-party tool from Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory [LDEO]).  

# 10.1. Logging data flow and depth scales  

In Hole U1589C, the triple combo tool string was pulled up at a constant speed of ${\sim}9~\mathrm{m/min}$ t o provide a continuous set of measurements in each logging path. Downhole data during the loggin g run were monitored in real time and recorded by the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system.  

Initially, the logging data depths were referenced to the rig floor; the data depths are then postprocessed using a combination of the tool locations during operations, including stuck-and-sli p motion data. The Schlumberger logging tool head (or cable head) measures tension at the very to p of the wireline tool string. These measurements detect and can diagnose difficulties in running th e tool string up or down the borehole when exiting or entering the drill string or casing. The EDT C includes an accelerometer from which the data are used to evaluate the efficiency of the wirelin e heave compensator (WHC) (see Wireline heave compensator). The EDTC also includes a scintillation gamma ray detector to aid correlation between various passes and detect when the too l passes the seafloor. A clearer indication of the seafloor is provided by the HNGS. Because the too l strings combine tools of different generations and various designs, they include several adapter s and joints between individual tools to allow communication, provide isolation, avoid interferenc e (i.e., mechanical or acoustic), terminate wirings, or position the tool properly in the borehole.

After completion of logging operations, the downhole logging data were sent to the LDEO Borehole Research Group at Columbia University (New York, USA) for processing during the expedition and returned to the shipboard downhole logging scientists for interpretation.  

Postprocessing primarily involves depth-matching to provide consistency in the depth scal e between the different logging passes. Similar to the depth shift to the seafloor datum, this dept h matching was undertaken primarily by utilizing the gamma ray data. In addition, corrections wer e made to certain tools and logs (e.g., speed and voltage corrections to microresistivity images), documentation for the logs (including an assessment of log data quality) was prepared, and the dat a were converted to ASCII format for the conventional logs.  

# 10.2. Log data quality  

The condition of a borehole is the principal factor contributing to log data quality. The ideal conditions for logging include a consistent borehole diameter of the size of the bit with no washout s (i.e., enlarged borehole) or bridges (i.e., narrowed borehole). Oversized borehole diameter ca n have a significant impact on measurements, especially those that require tool eccentering (e.g., HLDS). Direct contact of the eccentered tools with the formation is essential for acquisition o f high-quality data sets. Borehole wall contact is lost beyond a 20 inch $(50.80\,\mathrm{cm})$ borehole diamete r for the HLDS. Certain measurements (notably, spectral gamma ray [HNGS], resistivity [HRLA], and acoustic velocity [Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI)]) taken during Expedition 398 are still representative of the formation in larger borehole diameters. Consequently, these measurements are les s affected by borehole conditions, although data are optimized in boreholes where the tools can b e centralized (as large as ${\sim}20$ inch diameter).  

If the borehole diameter changes over short intervals due to washouts or ledges, logging result s may be irregular. Bridged sections will also cause irregular log results. The quality of the borehol e can be improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling fluid, flushing the borehole to remov e debris prior to logging, performing a full wiper trip, and starting logging as soon as possible afte r drilling and hole conditioning.  

The quality of logging depth determination is dependent on a number of factors, including ship’ s heave, cable stretch, cable slip, and tidal changes. An important reference datum in wireline logging is the seafloor/mudline, which is determined from the gamma ray logs acquired during eac h logging pass. Discrepancies between the drilling core depth and the wireline logging depth occu r because of incomplete core recovery, core expansion, incomplete heave compensation, and dril l pipe stretch. Reconciling the differences between the two data sets is possible through compariso n of the common data sets acquired in situ and on the core (e.g., NGR and MS).  

# 10.3. Logged properties and tool measurement principles  

The properties of the formations logged and the methods by which they were measured ar e described below. Further information regarding individual and/or combinations of logging tool s and their applications are widely available (e.g., Ellis and Singer, 2007; Goldberg, 1997; Lovell et al., 1998; Rider and Kennedy, 2011; Schlumberger, 1989; Serra, 1984, 1986, 1989). In addition, a complete list of acronyms for Schlumberger tools and logs is available at http://www.odplegacy.org/PDF/Operations/Engineering/Logging_Tools/Acronyms_Comprehensive.pdf.  

# 10.3.1. Physical properties wireline tools  

During Expedition 398, a standard triple combo tool string in Hole U1589C recorded bulk densit y and photoelectric effect (PEF; HLDS), porosity (Accelerator Porosity Sonde [APS]), spectra l (HNGS) and total count (EDTC) natural gamma ray, resistivity (HRLA), and fluid temperatur e (logging equipment head-mud temperature [LEH-MT]). Each tool string also included a telemetr y cartridge in the EDTC that transmitted the data in real time from the tools to the MAXIS unit o n the ship through the wireline cable.  

# 10.3.2. Caliper  

The borehole diameter measured by the caliper provides an indication of formation strength an d borehole wall conditions after drilling operations. Displaying caliper measurements along dept h can provide evidence of breakouts or borehole ellipticity that can be interpreted in terms o f maximum and minimum plane stresses. A breakout signal typically shows an increase in diamete r in one of the orthogonal calipers, whereas the other caliper remains close to the bit size. Thes e caliper measurements can provide information on the present-day stress field inferred from th e ellipticity of borehole deformation induced by downhole operations.  

# 10.3.3. Natural gamma radioactivity  

Total and spectral gamma ray measurements were acquired using the HNGS. This tool utilize s two bismuth germanate scintillation detectors and five-window spectroscopy to determine concentrations of $^{40}\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ in the formation. Sensitivity to any additives in the drilling flui d (notably sepiolite-based drilling mud clay) is eliminated because the HNGS filters out gamma ra y energies $<500\ \mathrm{keV},$ thus improving measurement accuracy. The inclusion of HNGS in all too l strings allows the use of gamma ray data for depth correlation between consecutive tool strin g runs and individual tool string passes (up- and down-logs).  

# 10.3.4. Photoelectric effect  

The HLDS also measures photoelectric absorption (i.e., PEF). After repeated Compton scatterin g resulting from collision with formation electrons, gamma radiation reaches an energy that is lo w enough $({<}150\,\mathrm{keV})$ to be photoelectrically absorbed. The PEF is dependent on the atomic numbe r of the elements in the formation and therefore varies according to the mineralogical compositio n of the lithologies encountered. As such, the PEF can be used to identify the presence of some minerals. Bartetzko et al. (2003), for example, interpret values ${>}6\,\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ as a general indicator for sulfid e or oxide mineralization.  

# 10.3.5. Density  

The HLDS measures formation density utilizing a cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source and far- an d near-gamma ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid. This skid is pressed against the borehol e wall using a hydraulically activated eccentering arm. The gamma rays emitted from the source ar e attenuated through the process of Compton scattering, which involves a partial energy loss resulting from elastic collision with electrons in the formation. The quantity of gamma radiation tha t reaches the detectors is directly related to the density of electrons in the formation, which in tur n is related to the bulk density. Good tool/borehole contact is essential for effective HLDS measurements, whereas poor contact results in underestimation of formation density values.  

# 10.3.6. Porosity  

The formation porosity sonde includes a minitron neutron generator that produces fast neutron s and five detectors positioned at different spacings from the minitron. The tool’s detectors coun t neutrons that arrive after being scattered and slowed by collisions with atomic nuclei in the formation. The highest energy loss occurs when neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei, which hav e essentially the same mass as the neutron. Therefore, the tool provides a measure of hydrogen content, which is most commonly found in water in the pore fluid and can be directly related to porosity. However, hydrogen may be present in sedimentary, igneous, and alteration minerals, includin g clay minerals, which can result in overestimation of actual porosity.  

Upon reaching thermal energies $(0.025\mathrm{~eV})$ ), the neutrons are captured by the nuclei of Cl, Si, B, and other elements, resulting in gamma ray emission. This neutron capture cross section $(\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}})$ i s also measured by the tool and can be used to identify these elements (Broglia and Ellis, 1990; Brewer et al., 1996).  

# 10.3.7. Magnetic susceptibility  

The MSS is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by LDEO (see Specialty Wireline Tools a t https://iodp.tamu.edu/tools/logging/SPECIAL/mss-b.html). It measures the ease with whic h formations are magnetized when subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetization is ultimately related to the concentration and composition (i.e., size, shape, and mineralogy) of magneti c minerals (principally magnetite) in the formation. These measurements provide one of the bes t methods for investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy and lithology because the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructive and because different lithologies often have strongl y contrasting magnetic susceptibilities.  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution measurements with ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{cm}$ depth of horizontal investigation. The MSS was operated as the lowermost tool in the triple combo tool strin g with a data translation cartridge to be combined with the Schlumberger tools. MS data from th e MSS are plotted as noncalibrated units and are affected by temperature and borehole size (e.g., higher temperatures lead to higher susceptibility measurements). For quality control and environmental correction, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $z$ -axis acceleration, and lowresolution borehole conductivity.  

# 10.3.8. Electrical resistivity  

Six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation (including one borehole flui d measurement and five formation measurements) were acquired with the HRLA. The array provides direct resistivity measurements by emitting a focused current into the formation and measuring the intensity necessary to maintain a constant drop in voltage across a fixed interval. Th e HRLA has one central (i.e., source) electrode and six electrodes above and below it that alternat e as transmitting and receiving current electrodes. Simultaneous resistivity measurements at si x penetration depths are possible because of the rapid alternation in roles of these electrodes.  

# 10.3.9. Acoustic velocity  

The DSI measures the transit time of acoustic pulses between sonic transmitters and an array o f eight receivers. The resulting waveforms are used to calculate the sonic velocity of the formation. High-frequency $(5{-}15\;\mathrm{kHz})$ pulses emitted by an omnidirectional monopole transmitter are use d to extract the compressional velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ of the formation. It is possible to extract the shear wav e velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{{S}}}\right)$ from these data in the event that it is faster than the acoustic velocity in the borehol e fluid. The monopole transmitter can also be fired in sequence at a lower frequency $(0.5{-}1.0\;\mathrm{kHz})$ to generate Stoneley waves, which are sensitive to fractures and variations in formation permeability. The DSI has two cross-dipole transmitters that facilitate the acquisition of shear wave velocit y data in slow formations where the formation $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ is less than that of the borehole fluid. In fast formations, $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ measurements from the monopole waveforms are possible and have sharper arrival s and more accurate $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ estimates than the equivalent cross-dipole data. However, the cross-dipole– derived shear velocities can be useful in identifying any sonic anisotropy associated with the loca l stress regime.  

# 10.4. Wireline heave compensator  

The WHC is designed to compensate for the ship’s vertical motion to help maintain the stead y movement of the logging tools in the borehole. Vertical acceleration measurements made by th e motion reference unit (MRU), located under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity, are use d to calculate the vertical motion of the ship. The WHC then adjusts the length of the wireline b y varying the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes. The actua l motion of the tool string is displayed, enabling evaluation of the compensator’s efficiency. Th e WHC was used during logging operations in Hole U1589C with favorable sea conditions $_{\;<1\mathrm{~m~}}$ peak-to-peak heave). Real-time measurements of uphole (i.e., surface) and downhole acceleratio n are made simultaneously by the MRU and the EDTC, respectively.
