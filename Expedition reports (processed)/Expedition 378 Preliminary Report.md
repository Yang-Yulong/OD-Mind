# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 37 8 was designed to recover the first comprehensive set of Paleogen e sedimentary sections from a transect of sites strategically positioned in the South Pacific to reconstruct key changes in oceani c and atmospheric circulation. These sites would have provided a n unparalleled opportunity to add crucial new data and geographi c coverage to existing reconstructions of Paleogene climate. In addition to the ${\sim}15$ month postponement of Expedition 378 and subsequent port changes resulting in a reduction of the number o f primary sites, testing and evaluation of the R/V JOIDES Resolution derrick in the weeks preceding the expedition determined that i t would not support deployment of drill strings in excess of $2\,\mathrm{km}$ . Because of this determination, only 1 of the originally approved 7 primary sites was drilled.  

Expedition 378 recovered the first continuously cored, multiplehole Paleogene sedimentary section from the southern Campbel l Plateau at Site U1553. This high–southern latitude site builds on th e legacy of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 277, a single, partially spot cored hole, providing a unique opportunity to refine an d augment existing reconstructions of the past ${\sim}66\$ My of climate history. This also includes the discovery of a new siliciclastic unit tha t had never been drilled before.  

As the world’s largest ocean, the Pacific Ocean is intricatel y linked to major changes in the global climate system. Previous drilling in the low-latitude Pacific Ocean during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 138 and 199 and Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Expeditions 320 and 321 provided new insights into climate and carbon system dynamics, productivity changes across th e zone of divergence, time-dependent calcium carbonate dissolution, bio- and magnetostratigraphy, the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and evolutionary patterns for times of climati c change and upheaval. Expedition 378 in the South Pacific Ocea n uniquely complements this work with a high-latitude perspective, especially because appropriate high-latitude records are unobtainable in the Northern Hemisphere of the Pacific Ocean.  

Site U1553 and the entire corpus of shore-based investigation s will significantly contribute to the challenges of the “Climate an d Ocean Change: Reading the Past, Informing the Future” theme o f the IODP Science Plan (How does Earth’s climate system respond t o elevated levels of atmospheric $C O_{2}^{\prime}$ ? How resilient is the ocean t o chemical perturbations?). Furthermore, Expedition 378 will provid e material from the South Pacific Ocean in an area critical for highlatitude climate reconstructions spanning the Paleocene to late Oligocene.  

# Introduction  

The South Pacific Paleogene Climate science program originated from International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Proposal 567-Full4  (http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/south_pacific_paleogene_climate.html) with the broad goal to investigate the record of Cenozoic climate and oceanography through  a drilling transect in the high-latitude southern Pacific Ocean. Th e principal drilling targets include sediments deposited during th e very warm late Paleocene and early Eocene, including the Paleocene/Eocene boundary and Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT). These archives can help investigate how the Eocene Earth maintained high global temperatures and high heat transport to the pola r regions despite receiving near-modern levels of solar energy input.  

Investigation of the recovered sediments will provide critical constraints on the subpolar Pacific Ocean climate, oceanographi c structure, and biogeochemical cycling through much of the Cenozoic and possibly the latest Cretaceous. New drilling on the southern Campbell Plateau will enable reconstruction of intermediat e water compositions in addition to augmenting the Pacific latitudinal gradient. The Drake Passage (or Drake Isthmus) separated the abyssal South Atlantic from the abyssal South Pacific through much o f the Paleogene (there was likely a shallow connection via the Transantarctic Seaway prior to the opening of the Drake Passage), and i t is likely that the South Pacific thermohaline structure was differen t from that in the South Atlantic. Expedition 378 will allow researchers to compare Atlantic and Pacific Ocean circulation throug h much of the Cenozoic.  

One of the primary needs for both atmospheric and oceanic circulation models is robust sea-surface temperature (SST) control. SST data form a major boundary condition for constraining thes e models, and SST is the most easily observable signal of circulatio n patterns. Temperature gradients can be measured in a relative sens e even if the absolute calibrations are off with respect to the subantarctic or equatorial region.  

# Background  

# Reconstruction of environmental conditions and physical processes in the Paleogene oceans  

Seafloor sediments record the broad outlines of the major features of ocean circulation such as water mass distributions; region s of steep gradients in temperature, salinity, and biologic productivity; and the distribution of deepwater masses. Surface water provinces are identified by their salinity and temperature in the moder n ocean. Distinct assemblages of planktonic organisms are associate d with these provinces; thus, microfossil assemblages of these organisms can be used to define the geographic extent of water masses i n premodern sediments (Fontorbe et al., 2017). Divergence of nearsurface water usually supports higher organic productivity, whic h leaves a diagnostic geochemical and micropaleontological fingerprint in the underlying sediments. Steep gradients in the surfac e ocean are preserved in the records of planktonic microfossil assemblages and mark regions of vigorous near-surface transport as winddriven open-ocean and boundary currents. Winds that drive thes e currents may be reconstructed through the geochemical composition of the dust from upwind continental areas after accounting fo r any volcanic ash contributions (e.g., Rea et al., 1994; Dunlea et al., 2015).  

Present  poleward  heat  transport  is  divided  approximatel y equally between the atmospheres and the oceans. Wind-driven currents achieve about half of the ocean heat transport, whereas th e balance of oceanic heat transport is driven by the overturning circulation. Obviously, all aspects of heat transport must be defined a s well as possible in our effort to better understand ocean circulatio n and the role it plays in times of extremely warm climates. By focusing our efforts on a specific time interval in both the previousl y drilled equatorial and presently proposed subpolar–polar transects, we will advance reconstructions of meridional Eocene heat transfer, along with the circulatory response of the ocean and atmosphere.  

# Sea-surface temperatures  

The early Paleogene $(66{-}35\ \mathrm{Ma})$ was the most recent geologi c interval during which atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels were likely abov e ${\sim}1000\,\mathrm{ppm}$ (e.g., Pearson et al., 2009; Pagani et al., 2011; Hönisch e t al., 2012; Anagnostou et al., 2016). Proxy records and models indicate that elevated atmospheric greenhouse gas inventories woul d have produced higher SSTs.  

Multiproxy reconstructions of SSTs confirm these results (Hollis et al., 2019) and indicate that tropical SSTs ranged from $\mathrm{\sim}34^{\circ}$ t o $38^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Pearson et al., 2006; Huber, 2008), SSTs in the highlatitude South Pacific $(\mathrm{\sim}55^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ ranged from $20^{\circ}$ to $35\mathrm{^\circC}$ (Bijl et al., 2009; Hollis et al., 2012; Pross et al., 2012; Cramwinckel et al., 2018), and Antarctic/high-latitude SST estimates from Seymour Island of f the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula were ${\sim}15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Ivany et al., 2011).  

These SST estimates produce early Paleogene equator-to-pol e thermal gradients significantly lower than that of the modern ocea n (e.g., Hollis et al., 2009; Lunt et al., 2012). Fully coupled model simulations using strong radiative greenhouse gas forcing yield seasonal thermal gradients generally consistent with available prox y data (Huber and Caballero, 2011; Hollis et al., 2012; Lunt et al., 2012), whereas simulated meridional temperature gradients ar e overemphasized and high-latitude precipitation is typically underestimated (Carmichael et al., 2016).  

# Ocean circulation  

Oceanic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is a crucia l component of the climate system and impacts heat transport, nutrient transport, and global carbon cycling. The operating mode of th e MOC was significantly different during the Late Cretaceous an d early Paleogene (e.g., Thomas et al., 2014; Hutchinson et al., 2018). In the modern oceans, Antarctica is surrounded by the world’ s strongest ocean current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which flows around Antarctica and reaches from the surface t o abyssal depths. The current is sufficiently strong to cause erosio n and sediment transport near its axis at $50^{\circ}{-}55^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (e.g., Goodell et al., 1971; Watkins and Kennett, 1977; Hollister and Nowell, 1991; Barker and Thomas, 2004). Exactly when the ACC developed remains uncertain. In the early Paleogene, the Southern Ocean wa s divided into Pacific and Atlantic-Indian sectors because Australi a and South America were joined to Antarctica. Both Souther n Ocean sectors developed a unique subpolar gyre, and the Pacifi c sector gyre is known as the proto-Ross Gyre (Huber et al., 2004; Stickley et al., 2004).  

An increasing catalog of water mass proxy data combined wit h state-of-the-art numerical simulations provides a reconstruction o f MOC characterized by convection in the South Pacific as well as th e North Pacific during the latest Cretaceous through early Paleogene. This reconstruction is supported by fully coupled Global Circulation Model simulations that indicate the “age” of deep water in th e Pacific Ocean increased from high to low latitudes in both th e South and North Pacific (Hague et al., 2012). Neodymium (Nd) isotope records also suggest that the MOC in the Pacific Ocean wa s dissimilar and separated from that in the Atlantic Ocean (Thoma s et al., 2014).  

The evolution of modern Antarctic circulation began with th e formation of deepwater passages south of Australia (Tasman Gateway) and through the Scotia Arc (Drake Passage). Data from Ocea n Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 189 (Stickley et al., 2004; Bijl et al., 2013) suggest the earliest throughflow of a westbound ACC bega n at ${\sim}49{-}50$ Ma through a southern opening of the Tasmanian Gateway in conjunction with the simultaneous onset of regional surfac e water and continental cooling $(2^{\circ}-4^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . The timing of subsequen t deepening of the Tasman Gateway and Drake Passage still is no t well constrained, with estimates ranging from the middle Eocene t o early Miocene for the development of circum-Antarctic deepwate r passages and the formation of the full ACC (Lawver and Gahagan, 1998, 2003; Barker, 2001; Pfuhl and McCave, 2005; Scher and Martin, 2006). Interestingly, abyssal hiatuses along the thermohalin e flow path at the base of the Campbell Plateau developed at the tim e of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary; however, shallow-water hiatuses indicate a ${\sim}3$ My younger formation age. Furthermore, grai n size, stable isotope, and foraminifer data along the ACC flow pat h suggest that the ACC developed after the Eocene–Oligocene transition, in the late Oligocene or at the Oligocene/Miocene boundar y (Pfuhl and McCave, 2005; Lyle et al., 2007). Uncertainty in the timing of ACC formation compounds the ongoing debate about the potential role of ACC formation on global/regional climate. Sit e U1553 will contribute to our understanding of the timing of AC C formation as well as the potential impact of ACC formation on climate.  

# Water formation and hydrologic cycling  

Deep and bottom water likely formed south of the polar fron t during the Paleogene (e.g., van de Flierdt et al., 2004; Thomas et al., 2014), and the character of this deeper water can be assessed b y measuring geochemical signals preserved in benthic foraminifers, fossil fish teeth and bones, and Fe-Mn oxide minerals at the proposed drill sites. Data from Site U1553 will enable us to assess existing models for the evolving mode of intermediate water formatio n through the Paleogene.  

Proxy estimates of atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2},$ SSTs, and terrigenous organic matter inputs will contribute significantly to the state of understanding of Paleogene prevailing winds and hydrologic cycling. For example, published model simulations and existing proxy dat a suggest that overall hydrologic cycling was more intense during th e early Paleogene, resulting in higher precipitation in temperate an d high latitudes (e.g., Pagani et al., 2006). Higher precipitation/humidity would have caused a greater vegetative cover in temperat e and high-latitude continental regions than during drier periods, which in turn would have diminished dust transport from sourc e regions to the ocean basins. Conversely, an enhanced hydrological cycle implies a drying of the arid-to-semiarid regions (Held an d Soden, 2006) that may have enhanced the size of the subtropical dust source regions.  

Only a few dust accumulation and provenance records exist fo r the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene (e.g., Janecek and Rea, 1983; Hovan and Rea, 1992; Zhou and Kyte, 1992). In general, th e compilation of long-term data indicates higher dust accumulatio n in the North Pacific (Deep Sea Drilling Project [DSDP] Site 576; piston Core LL44-GPC3) than the southern Indian Ocean (ODP Site s 756 and 757) during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene. Lat e Paleocene high-resolution data from Indian Ocean DSDP Site 21 5 show a transient increase in dust fluxes at ${\sim}59\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , but fluxes prio r to and after the pulse seem to be consistent with the few othe r Southern Hemisphere locations (Hovan and Rea, 1992). Norther n Hemisphere dust fluxes increased throughout the Neogene; however, the Indian Ocean sites record a slight decrease in flux throughout the Cenozoic. Site U1553 provides an opportunity to contribut e to the record of dust deposition and provenance in the southwestern Pacific, and statistical analysis of bulk sediment elemental dat a will enable us to determine the accumulation rate of and distinguis h between eolian dust and disseminated ash (e.g., Dunlea et al., 2015).  

# Chronostratigraphy  

High-quality, multiple-hole cored Cenozoic sedimentary successions from the Atlantic (ODP Legs 171B, 207, and 208 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 342) and Pacific (OD P Legs 198 and 199 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 320 and 321) yielded high-resolution geochemical records tha t also led to the development of astronomically calibrated age model s (e.g., Röhl et al., 2007; Westerhold et al., 2011, 2018; Littler et al., 2014; Lauretano et al., 2016; Barnet et al., 2019). Expedition 378 wil l contribute a unique section including crucial time intervals for th e South Pacific area that will be integrated into the global chronostratigraphy.  

# Previous drilling  

The best-known Paleogene paleoceanographic site in the Sout h Pacific is DSDP Site 277, which was drilled during Leg 29. This sit e is located south of New Zealand and recovered upper Oligocene t o upper Paleocene carbonates in a single hole, but the Eocene portio n of this hole was spot cored with low recovery (Kennett et al., 1975). The current water depth at this location is ${\sim}1215\mathrm{~m~}$ . The Site 27 7 sediment sequence consists of ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ of Pliocene–Pleistocene carbonate ooze that is disconformably separated from an expande d middle Paleocene to upper Oligocene sequence with sedimentatio n rates of $19{-}22\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My}.$ . The sediments spanning the upper Eocene t o upper Oligocene are stiff carbonate oozes, and the ooze–chalk transition is nominally placed at 246 meters below seafloor (mbsf). Middle Paleocene to upper Eocene sediments are variably indurated bu t typically consist of chalks with low to moderate amounts of lithification (Kennett et al., 1975). Materials from this site provided mos t of the samples for two classic oxygen isotope curves that first defined the unusually warm early Eocene period (Shackleton and Kennett, 1974; Savin, 1977).  

Improvements in the advanced piston corer (APC) and halflength APC (HLAPC) technologies have vastly improved the abilit y to develop triple-core stratigraphic splices. This capacity will allo w for unprecedented insight into the details and timing of the majo r events preserved in the sedimentary record of the Campbell Platea u (Hollis et al., 2015).  

# Seismic studies and site survey data  

No modern seismic surveys exist in the immediate vicinity o f Site U1553, and the original siting for Site 277 was based solely o n D/V Glomar Challenger shipboard subbottom depth profiling (3. 5 kHz) (Kennett et al., 1975).  

# Scientific objectives  

As laid out in Proposal 567-Full4, Expedition 378 sought to elucidate the temperate to subpolar climate and oceanography of th e very warm Eocene, as well as the middle and late Cenozoic, in th e far southern Pacific Ocean. Proposed drill sites were positione d along Anomaly 25 $.56\,\mathrm{Ma})$ between $56^{\circ}$ and $70^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ paleolatitudes (using the Ocean Drilling Stratigraphic Network webpage backtrac k scheme). The overall aim was to obtain a continuous well-preserve d sediment section that would address the following primary scientific objectives (of equal priority):  

1. To reconstruct the early Eocene surface water temperature gradient around Antarctica to monitor ocean heat transport and to extrapolate subsurface water structure (proposed Sites SP-1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, and DSDP 277 and, to a lesser extent, proposed Sites SP-4B, SP-5B, and SP-15A), 2. To establish the early Eocene vertical temperature gradient (proposed Sites DSDP 277, SP-1B, and SP-2B),  

3. To evaluate early Eocene biological productivity and determine nutrient exchange and mixing of surface and subsurface waters (proposed Sites SP-1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, and DSDP 277 and, to a lesser extent, proposed Sites SP-4B, SP-5B, and SP-15A),   
4. To track the development and variability of South Pacific thermohaline circulation during the Paleogene (proposed Sites SP1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, SP-15A, SP-4B, and SP-5B),   
5. To document the response of the proto-Ross Gyre (South Pacific Subantarctic gyre) to the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) (proposed Sites DSDP 277, SP-1B, SP-2B, and SP3B and, to a lesser extent, proposed Sites SP-4B, SP-5B, and SP15A),   
6. To reconstruct changes in South Pacific temperature, circulation, and productivity associated with the greenhouse–icehouse transition (Eocene/Oligocene boundary) (proposed Sites SP-1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, SP-13A, SP-14A, and DSDP 277 and, to a lesser extent, proposed Sites SP-4B, SP-5B, and SP-15A),   
7. To establish the development of ACC (proposed Sites SP-14A, SP-13A, DSDP 277, SP-1B, SP-2B, and SP-3B), and   
8. To reconstruct the evolution of Paleogene wind field (proposed Site SP-15A and all other sites).  

The obtained sediment section would also address the followin g additional objectives:  

1. To develop a common chronostratigraphic framework for Paleogene Southern Ocean magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and cyclostratigraphy (all proposed sites),   
2. To resolve geographic distribution of important Paleogene and early Neogene hiatuses in concert with ODP Leg 181 results and DSDP drilling (primarily proposed Sites DSDP 277, SP-1B, SP2B, SP-3B, SP-13A, and SP-14A),   
3. To better determine Paleogene Pacific plate motion (all proposed sites), and   
4. To determine, if possible, Paleogene and Neogene development of ice rafting from Antarctica (primarily proposed Site SP-1B).  

# Revised scientific objectives for Site U1553  

Revised drilling operations for Expedition 378 that eliminate d the abyssal sites listed in the Scientific Prospectus prompted a significant revision of the scientific objectives. Much of the transit fro m Lautoka, Fiji, to Site U1553 was devoted to revisiting laborator y group and individual science plans to ensure that each member o f the science party had the ability to contribute to the postcruise science. All of the science plans were crafted to exploit the new continuously cored, multiple-hole sediment section from Site U1553 t o achieve the following revised objectives:  

1. To reconstruct the surface and deepwater temperatures and carbon inventory, as well as vertical temperature gradients, through the Paleogene, with particular emphasis on the major events that punctuate this long-term record (e.g., the EOT, Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum [MECO], Eocene Thermal Maximum [ETM] events, PETM, and Cretaceous/Paleogene $[\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{Pg}]$ boundary);   
2. To develop an integrated chronostratigraphic framework for Paleogene Southern Ocean including magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and cyclostratigraphy;   
3. To refine our understanding of the Paleogene evolution of seawater chemistry, the role of atmospheric concentrations of $C O_{2},$ and ice sheet dynamics;   
4. To evaluate Paleogene biological productivity and determine nutrient exchange and mixing of surface and subsurface waters;   
5. To track the development and variability of South Pacific intermediate-water composition and its role in overturning circulation throughout the Paleogene, with emphasis on refining the timing and development of the ACC;   
6. To determine, if possible, Paleogene and Neogene development of ice rafting from Antarctica;   
7. To better determine Paleogene Pacific plate motion; and   
8. To reconstruct the evolution of the Paleogene wind field.  

# Site summary Site U1553  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1553 is located at $1221\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth and provided th e opportunity to continuously core multiple holes of a critical sequence of Paleogene sediments on the southern Campbell Platea u (Figure F1). The objectives of Site U1553 were the overall expedition objectives reported above: to recover a continuous Paleogen e sequence to reconstruct SSTs and deepwater temperatures, as wel l as vertical temperature gradients with particular emphasis on th e major events that punctuate the Paleogene record (e.g., EOT, MECO, Early Eocene Climatic Optimum ETM events, PETM, an d $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary); to develop a common chronostratigraphic framework for Paleogene Southern Ocean magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and cyclostratigraphy; to refine our understanding of th e evolution of seawater chemistry; to evaluate Paleogene biologica l productivity and determine nutrient exchange and mixing of surface and subsurface waters; and to track the development and variability of South Pacific intermediate-water composition and its rol e in overturning circulation during the Paleogene and Late Cretaceous, with emphasis on refining the timing and development of th e ACC.  

# Operations  

After a $2249\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Lautoka, Fiji, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1553 at $1210~\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local; $\mathrm{UTC}\mathrm{~+~}13~\mathrm{h}$ ) on 1 5 January 2020. Five holes were cored at Site U1553 (Figure F1; Tabl e T1). The operations plan was to triple core the upper portion of th e sedimentary sequence using the APC/extended core barrel (XCB ) drill string and then rotary core two deep holes to a maximu m depth of 670 mbsf, followed by logging of the final hole. Hol e U1553A recovered a total of 27 cores taken over a $216.4~\mathrm{m}$ interva l with $98.9\%$ recovery. Temperature measurements using the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool were taken o n Cores 378-U1553A-4H, 7H, and 10H, and all full-length APC core s were oriented using the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool. The total time spent on Hole U1553A was $34.00\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.4 days). After repair s to the top drive brake were concluded, operations resumed at 091 5 h on 17 January. Hole U1553B recovered a total of 29 cores take n over a $243.0\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $95.4\%$ recovery. The total time spent o n Hole U1553B was $42.50\;\mathrm{h}$ (1.8 days), with $^{10\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ spent repairing th e top drive. With weather systems moving in, the third APC/XC B hole was deferred in favor of an attempt to reach the deeper objectives with the rotary core barrel (RCB) system. Hole U1553C wa s spudded at $0010\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 January and drilled ahead without core recovery to 234.0 mbsf. A total of 43 cores were taken over a $334.6~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $47.4\%$ recovery. Anomalously low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios i n Cores 43R and 44R forced termination of coring at 567.5 mbsf. Th e total time spent on Hole U1553C was $82.75\,\mathrm{~h~}$ (3.4 days). Hol e  

U1553D was drilled ahead to 178.3 mbsf. The center bit was pulled, and the Sediment Temperature 2 (SET2) tool was lowered to obtai n a fourth temperature measurement with the goal of refining th e thermal gradient at Site U1553. After recovering the SET2 temperature probe, the center bit was deployed again and the hole wa s drilled to 399.4 mbsf. During coring operations, clearance was provided by the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel to advanc e Hole U1553D deeper than Hole U1553C on a core-by-core basi s pending headspace gas analysis. Hole U1553D was terminated a t 581.16 mbsf, and the vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west for Hole U1553E. Hole U1553E was spudded at $0845~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 January. A total of 2 7 cores were taken in Hole U1553E over a $237.6\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $88.3\%$ recovery. Total depth for Hole U1553E was 237.6 mbsf, and the total time spent on Hole U1553E was $33.25~\mathrm{h}$ (1.4 days). The total tim e spent at Site U1553 was 11.02 days, which includes $^{10\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ lost to repair of the top drive. The vessel then began the $531\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit t o Timaru, New Zealand, to pick up fuel filters before continuing t o Papeete, Tahiti (French Polynesia). The detour to Timaru added ${\sim}13$ h to the originally planned transit to Papeete.  

# Principal results  

Lithostratigraphy  

Coring at Site U1553 reached a maximum depth of 584.3 mbs f and recovered a $581.16~\mathrm{m}$ long sedimentary succession of deep-se a pelagic sediment of Pleistocene and Oligocene to early Paleocen e age from the Campbell Plateau. The recovered sections compris e five lithostratigraphic units (Figure F2). About $4\textrm{m}$ of Pleistocen e foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze (Unit I) overlies an expanded sequence ${\sim}200\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) of late Oligocene–early Oligocene nannofossil ooze with foraminifers (Unit II). The nannofossil ooze in Uni t II gradually transitions into nannofossil chalk in Unit III over $50~\mathrm{m}$ from ${\sim}175$ to 225 mbsf. Lithification of carbonates continues downcore and results in limestone, categorized as Unit IV. Finally, th e bottom ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ of the sediment column contains siliciclastic Unit V, characterized by alternating mudstone, sandy mudstone, and ver y fine to medium-grained sandstone (Figure F3).  

# Biostratigraphy  

A thin veneer of Pleistocene sediments overlies a sedimentar y succession that spans the early late Oligocene to early Paleocene. The upper portion of this succession (Units I–III) is an expande d ${\sim}250\;\mathrm{m}$ thick Oligocene to late Eocene (including the EOT) interval characterized by high abundance and good preservation of all microfossil groups reported here, namely calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, and radiolarians (Figure F4). Diatoms and spong e spicules are also abundant and well preserved throughout this interval. The Eocene and Paleocene intervals in Units IV and V are les s expanded and have more variable microfossil abundance and preservation, but biostratigraphic and lithologic evidence indicates th e presence of the Paleocene/Eocene boundary. Low calcareous and siliceous microfossil abundance and poor preservation in the basal mudstone to dolomitic mudstone, occasionally sandy unit (V) hampers exact age determination of the basal part of the section (Figur e F4).  

All planktonic microfossil groups lack the low-latitude specie s that form the basis of standard zonation schemes. For this reason, correlation and age assignments are based primarily on Souther n Ocean and Southwest Pacific zonations. The shipboard integrate d biozonation for the five holes exhibits overall good agreement between observed bioevents in different microfossil groups.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Much of the recovered section was characterized by a very lo w abundance of magnetic carriers. The high abundance of carbonat e in Units I–IV could have diluted the abundance of magnetite, henc e contributing to weak overall remanence magnetization. Consequently, only the upper $120\,\textrm{m}$ of Hole U1553A was suitable fo r magnetostratigraphic reconstruction. This preliminary magnetostratigraphy for the upper part of Hole U1553A is composed of  6 pairs of normal and reversed polarity patterns (n1/r1 to $\mathbf{n}6/\mathbf{r}6$ downsection). Two reversals identified in Hole U1553C (at $\sim\!290$ and 443 mbsf) likely correlate to the bases of Chrons C18n.2n (4 0 Ma) and C24n.3n $\left(54\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ , respectively.  

# Geochemistry  

The geochemical composition of the sediment and water samples from Site U1553 reflects the lithostratigraphic composition an d downcore diagenetic processes (Figure F5). Downcore changes i n the abundance of carbonate and aluminosilicates mirror the lithologic transition between Units IV and V. The presence of occasiona l glauconite, manganese nodules, pyrite, and chert suggest possibl e subseafloor changes in the aluminosilicates, siliceous, and carbonaceous components of the sediment. Interstitial water profiles compiled from the 5 holes resolve the first-order diagenetic processe s and their potential impact on the application of paleoceanographi c proxies.  

Headspace gas analyses for the uppermost $480\;\mathrm{m}$ of Site U155 3 indicate very low hydrocarbon concentrations, suggesting the lac k of biogenic and/or thermogenic gas production or their upward migration. A sudden increase in methane concentration occurs at th e transition from Unit IV to Unit V. The methane increase is accompanied by the detection of thermogenic hydrocarbons $\left(C_{2},\,C_{3},\right.$ an d $C_{4}^{\mathrm{~\large~\back~}}$ ), suggesting in situ methane production, possibly by microbia l activity, and upward migration of thermogenic gas. Gradually decreasing $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios with depth led to the termination of drillin g operations in Hole U1553C at 568 mbsf. Recalculation of $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios and an additional temperature measurement provided a bette r constraint for the deeper drilling in Hole U1553D.  

Interstitial water samples taken from whole-round squeezing o f sediment intervals and with Rhizons indicate an increase in total alkalinity from $2.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the seafloor to $3.6\;\mathrm{mM}$ at 200 mbsf. Ammonium increases from ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{mM}$ at the seafloor to $650{-}700\;\mathrm{mM}$ at 42 0 mbsf, suggesting organic matter degradation through a series of redox fronts utilizing manganese/iron oxides and sulfate as electro n acceptors. Carbonate dissolution/reprecipitation could explain th e increase in calcium and strontium with depth. Ba concentration s are $<\!3\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$ possibly suggesting low amounts of sulfate reduction, which, however, increases at depth. K and $\mathrm{Mg}$ concentrations decrease downcore, reflecting alteration and uptake into clays forme d within the seafloor (e.g., glauconite) or because of uptake into recrystallizing carbonates or authigenic clays forming within the seafloor.  

Solid-phase analyses indicate that the sediments predominantl y consist of carbonate (average $=90\%$ ) for the uppermost $420\textrm{m}$ o f Site U1553 (Units I–IV), ranging from $78\%$ to $99\%$ (Figure F5). Carbonate weight percent drops to ${<}10\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ at the top of Unit V $[\sim\!480$ mbsf), and this decrease coincides with an increase in Al, Si, an d trace elements associated with aluminosilicates. Overall, organi c carbon content is low $\left(<0.4\%\right)$ .  

# Physical properties  

Variations in physical properties data correspond with transitions between major lithostratigraphic units (Figures F6, F7).  A slight increase in bulk density and natural gamma radiation (NGR ) at 180 mbsf corresponds with the transition between Lithostratigraphic Units II and III. A significant increase in $P$ -wave velocit y and bulk density at 423 mbsf marks the top of Lithostratigraphi c Unit IV. A large increase in NGR counts, decrease in $P$ -wave velocity and bulk density, and change in color at 477 mbsf are reflective o f the higher silica and clay content of Lithostratigraphic Unit V.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Cores recovered using the APC and XCB coring systems i n Holes U1553A, U1553B, and U1553E, although seemingly in goo d condition and with reasonable recovery rates, were difficult to correlate because of the combined effects of the carbonate-rich lithology, age of the sediments, their postdepositional history, an d occasional drilling disturbance at the top of the cores. Preliminar y core offsets to align Holes U1553A, U1553B, and U1553E were assigned, but no continuous splice was attempted during the expedition. Correlation of the two deeper holes (U1553C and U1553D ) drilled using the RCB coring system was not possible for much o f the section at the usual meter and decimeter scale because of poo r recovery and the recovery of nonoverlapping intervals. An exception was a series of cores surrounding the possible PETM interval and in the early Paleocene.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Inspection of the derrick structure determining it was unsafe t o operate in typical pelagic water depths, as well as unforeseen maintenance issues with the ship’s two screws, led to the elimination of  6 of the 7 primary Expedition 378 drilling targets. Two additional setbacks during Expedition 378 operations resulted in the loss of ${\sim}23\,\mathrm{h}$ of drilling time on site (repairs to the top drive brake actuator an d the need to detour to Timaru, New Zealand, to obtain fuel filter s necessitated by contaminated fuel taken on in San Diego, Californi a (US).  

In spite of these setbacks, Expedition 378 recovered 5 sedimentary sequences from Site U1553 that collectively span an expande d Oligocene through late Eocene, a triple-cored EOT, much of the Eocene, a double-cored PETM, and a unique and expanded Paleocen e mudstone interval with unknown basal age. The $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundar y was a primary target of drilling at Site U1553, and it likely was no t recovered because of the need to terminate Hole U1553D above ou r maximum approved drilling depth.  

Comparison of the recovery from Sites U1553 and 277 indicate s the potential for substantially more complete records of the Oligocene, much of the Eocene, and much deeper into the Paleocene (Figures F2, F8). Postcruise analyses employing state-of-the-art proxie s will enable us to accomplish most of the revised science objective s presented here.  

# Outreach  

Three Education and Outreach (E&O) Officers sailed during Expedition 378: one from the United States, one from China, and on e from New Zealand. All three officers came from science centers o r museums: Center of Science and Industry (COSI) in Columbus, Ohio (US), Shanghai Natural History Museum (SNHM) (China), and Otago Museum in Dunedin (New Zealand).  

The E&O Officers conducted 32 live broadcasts with shorebased groups at schools or institutions that lasted $30{-}60\,\mathrm{min}$ . Thes e live broadcasts with contributions from many of the shipboard scientists reached over 1550 people in 9 countries with the majority o f calls to the United States and New Zealand. The most well attende d call was to the Shanghai Natural History Museum; unfortunately, further calls to the SNHM were canceled because of the coronaviru s outbreak. Facebook live events were streamed through the JOIDE S Resolution Facebook page, and 4 were shared videoconferencin g events with COSI; the Shanghai event was also shared as a vide o and got 28,939 views.  

The E&O Team maintained an expedition blog (http://joidesresolution.org/expedition/378), Facebook page $(\@)$ joidesresolution), Twitter  feed  (@TheJR),  SoundCloud  account  (https://soundcloud.com/joides-resolution),  and  Instagram  account $(\@)\mathrm{OI}.$ DES_resolution) throughout the expedition to communicate event s and activities occurring during the expedition on a daily basis. A series of articles entitled “Sailing Notes” was sent to the IODP-Chin a office and SNHM (6 in total) to be released via 3 Wechat (China’ s social media platform) accounts.  

Both Co-Chiefs maintained blogs during the expeditio n (English: https://iodpexpedition378.wordpress.com; German: https://www.marum.de/Entdecken/Logbuch-IODP-Exp-378.html and https://www.planeterde.de/logbuecher/joides-resolutionsuedpazifik); instead of duplicating effort, the E&O Team reposted some of these blogs. A total of 13 blog posts were uploade d to the expedition webpage, including 10 reposts of Co-Chief Debbi e Thomas’ English blogs, 2 blog posts by E&O Officers, and 1 gues t blog written by a science party member.  

Numbers for new social media posts, increase in number of followers, reach, and engagement are in Table T2. All accounts attracted new followers across the duration of the expedition.
