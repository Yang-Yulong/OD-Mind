# Abstract  

The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the world’s strongest zonal current system that connects all three major ocean basin s of the global ocean and therefore integrates and responds to globa l climate variability. Its flow is largely driven by strong westerly wind s and constricted to its narrowest extent in the Drake Passage. Transport of fresh and cold surface and intermediate water masse s through the Drake Passage (cold-water route) strongly affects th e Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation together with the inflow of Indian Ocean water masses (warm-water route). Bot h oceanographic corridors are critical for the South Atlantic contribution to Meridional Overturning Circulation changes. In contrast t o the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the ACC, and with the exceptio n of drill cores from the Antarctic continental margin and off Ne w Zealand, the Pacific sector of the ACC lacks information on its Cenozoic paleoceanography from deep-sea drilling records. To advance our knowledge and understanding of Miocene to Holocen e atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere dynamics in the Pacific and thei r implications for regional and global climate and atmospheric $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 383 recovered sedimentary sequences at (1) three sites located in the central South Pacific (U1539, U1540, and U1541), (2) two sites at th e Chile margin (U1542 and U1544), and (3) one site from the pelagi c eastern South Pacific (U1543) close to the entrance to the Drak e Passage. Because of persistently stormy conditions and the resultin g bad weather avoidance, we were not successful in recovering th e originally planned Proposed Site CSP-3A in the central South Pacific in the Polar Frontal Zone. The drilled sediments at Sites U154 1 and U1543 reach back to the late Miocene, and those at Site U154 0 reach back to the early Pliocene. High sedimentary rate Pleistocen e sedimentary sequences were drilled both in the central South Pacific (Site U1539) and along the Chile margin. Taken together, th e sites represent a depth transect from ${\sim}1100\mathrm{~m~}$ at the Chile margi n site (U1542) to ${\sim}4070\mathrm{~m~}$ in the central South Pacific (Site U1539 ) and allow investigation of changes in the vertical structure of th e ACC, a key issue for understanding the role of the Southern Ocea n in the global carbon cycle. The sites are located at latitudes and water depths where sediments will allow the application of a wid e range of siliciclastic-, carbonate-, and opal-based proxies to addres s our objectives of reconstructing with unprecedented stratigraphi c detail surface to deep-ocean variations and their relation to atmosphere and cryosphere changes through stadial to interstadial, glacial to interglacial, and warmer than present time intervals.  

# Introduction  

Our prior knowledge of southern high latitude paleoceanography comes mainly from conventional sediment coring and Deep Se a Drilling Project (DSDP)/Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drilling i n the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). A prominent example is the achievements of ODP Le g 177, which drilled sites arrayed along a north–south transect acros s the major ACC fronts and documented the Cenozoic history of th e Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. These sites provided, for example, insights into changes in dust supply and marine productivit y and nutrient consumption (Martínez-García et al., 2009, 2011, 2014), opposite Southern Ocean productivity between the Antarctic and Subantarctic Zone on glacial–interglacial cycles (Jaccard e t al., 2013) and between the ACC and the Antarctic margin on longe r timescales (Cortese et al., 2004), sea-surface temperature (SST) evolution since the Pliocene (Martínez-García et al., 2010), and Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) dynamics during the late Quaternary (Kanfous h et al., 2002; Teitler et al., 2010, 2015; Venz and Hodell, 2002; Haye s et al., 2014).  

In contrast, the Pacific sector of the ACC has been much les s studied; drilling records are mostly high-resolution proximal sediment records from the Antarctic continental margin south of th e ACC (e.g., Ross Sea during DSDP Leg 28 and Antarctic Peninsul a during ODP Leg 178). Integrated Ocean Discovery Program Le g 318 drilled Cenozoic sediments off Wilkes Land (eastern India n Southern Ocean) and revealed significant vulnerability of the Eas t Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) to Pliocene warming (Cook et al., 2013; Expedition 318 Scientists, 2010). A substantial advance in constraining the history and stability of the West Antarctic Ice Shee t (WAIS) and Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) came from the Antarctic Geological Drilling (ANDRILL) project (e.g., Naish et al., 2009; Florindo e t al. 2008), documenting that the WAIS/RIS underwent significan t changes with expanded cold and stable ice sheets between 13 and 1 1 Ma. The ice sheet became more dynamic in the late Miocene–earl y late Pliocene $[10{-}2.5\,\mathrm{~Ma})$ with cyclic expansion of grounded ic e sheets over the coring site after $2.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

These on- and near-shore drilling programs have significantl y advanced our understanding of AIS dynamics during the Cenozoic. However, to understand how these ice sheet changes are ultimatel y linked to climate, atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ levels, and ocean circulation requires constraints of the ACC (i.e., the current system that connect s Antarctica to the rest of the globe). In this context, our drilling i n the Pacific ACC will be closely linked to the recently completed International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions to th e Ross Sea (Expedition 374), Amundsen Sea (Expedition 379), an d Scotia Sea (Expedition 382). These expeditions targeted Antarcti c near-shore records, which will likely be incomplete due to glacial erosion, and the potential for analyses of paleoceanographic proxie s will be limited. Therefore, the Dynamics of the Pacific Antarcti c Circumpolar Current (DYNAPACC; Expedition 383) pelagic site s were designed to provide a critical paleoceanographic baseline information including rates of change for improving the understanding of reconstructed Antarctic ice sheet changes and testing ic e sheet models.  

During Expedition 383, we recovered high-resolution Miocen e to Holocene sediment records at three sites in the central Subantarctic Pacific Southern Ocean. These sites in the central South Pacific document the Miocene to Holocene ACC paleoenvironmental history at water depths from 5100 to $3600\;\mathrm{m}$ . We drilled two sites a t the Chile margin and one site in the pelagic eastern South Pacifi c (ESP) to provide a depth transect ${\sim}1000{-}3900\;\mathrm{m})$ ) across the majo r Southern Ocean water masses.  

# Background  

The ACC is the world’s largest current system and connects al l three major basins of the global ocean (i.e., the Pacific, Atlantic, an d Indian Oceans; Figure F1) and therefore integrates and responds t o climate signals throughout the globe (e.g., Talley, 2013). By inducin g pronounced upwelling and formation of new water masses, th e ACC fundamentally affects the global Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC; Marshall and Speer, 2012) and the stability of Antarctica’s ice sheets.  

The ACC has long been recognized as a key player in regulatin g atmospheric $C O_{2}$ variations and therefore global climate based o n the tight coupling between Southern Hemisphere temperatures an d atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentrations  (e.g.,  Parrenin  et  al.  2013). Through its steep density surfaces, the ACC provides a direct hydrographic link between the large deep-ocean reservoir of dissolve d inorganic carbon and the surface ocean along which deep-wate r masses may ascend to the surface (e.g., Kuhlbrodt et al., 2007; Marshall and Speer, 2012). The ACC therefore acts as a window throug h which ocean and atmosphere interact and as a key player in regulating atmospheric $C O_{2}$ variations and therefore global climate.  

Biological utilization of nutrients in the Southern Ocean is particularly important in relation to changes in atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentration because it regulates the preformed nutrient inventory fo r most of the deep ocean and therefore the global average efficienc y of the biological pump (e.g., Sigman and Boyle, 2000; Sigman et al., 2010). Nutrient utilization is inefficient in the Southern Ocean today in part because phytoplankton growth is limited by the scarcit y of bioavailable iron (e.g., de Baar et al., 1995). Martin (1990) proposed that dust-borne iron fertilization of Southern Ocean phytoplankton  caused  the  ice  age  reduction  in  atmospheric $C O_{2}$ . However, the role of iron in explaining variation in opal export t o the Southern Ocean sediments is complex. Chase et al. (2015) foun d a significant correlation between annual average net primary production and modeled dust deposition but not between dust deposition and opal burial. On glacial–interglacial timescales, prox y records from the Subantarctic support a positive relationship between dust flux and opal production (e.g., Chase et al., 2003; Bradtmiller et al., 2009; Lamy et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 1995; Anderson e t al., 2014). The opposite is true south of the Antarctic Polar Fron t (PF) (e.g., Chase et al., 2003; Jaccard et al., 2013), indicating that factors other than dust regulate the production and export of opal i n the Southern Ocean and, by association, the strength and efficienc y of the biological pump. Leading candidates for these “other factors ” include changes in water mass structure in the Southern Ocean locations of the fronts encircling Antarctica, which are related to th e flow of the ACC, and the spatial and temporal variability of winddriven upwelling that supplies nutrients and $C O_{2}$ to surface water s and glacial–interglacial changes in sea ice extent.  

# Oceanographic setting  

Expedition 383 drilled sites located within the ACC current system in the central and ESP and at the southern Chile margin close t o the Drake Passage. The flow of the ACC is largely driven by stron g Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) and is constricted to its narrowest extent in the Drake Passage. This so-called “cold-water route ” transport through the Drake Passage is one important pathway fo r the return of fresh and cold waters from the Pacific to the Atlantic, which strongly affects the strength of the Atlantic MOC, in concer t with the “warm-water route” inflow of warm and salty Indian Ocea n water masses through the Agulhas Current system (Beal et al., 2011; Gordon, 1986). The Drake Passage is ${\sim}800\,\mathrm{km}$ wide and located between Cape Horn and the western Antarctic Peninsula (Figure F1). Numerous hydrographic surveys across the Drake Passage since th e 1970s have contributed to the understanding of seasonal and interannual variability in ACC transport through the Drake Passage an d the mechanisms forcing physical and biological changes within th e Southern Ocean (Meredith et al., 2011). However, even with hydrographic time series reaching back $20{\mathrm{~y~}}$ (Koenig et al., 2014) in thi s relatively well constrained region of the ACC and more sophisticated model simulations (Meijers, 2014), important issues such a s the role of zonal winds in forcing ACC transport remain controversial. The total ACC flow transported through the Drake Passage i s estimated to be between ${\sim}130$ and 150 Sv (Koenig et al., 2014; Meredith et al., 2011; Renault et al., 2011). The three major ACC oceanographic fronts (Orsi et al., 1995), the Subantarctic Front (SAF), th e Polar Front (PF), and the Southern ACC Front (SACCF), can b e identified from north to south in the Drake Passage. The moder n winter sea ice margin presently does not extend significantly nort h into the Drake Passage. Oceanographic studies robustly show tha t more than half of the total Drake Passage transport occurs at an d north of the SAF (i.e., in the Subantarctic Zone) followed by the Polar Frontal Zone (between the SAF and the PF). The relative contribution of Drake Passage transport south of the PF is generally ${<}20\%$ .  

Along the southernmost Chile margin, the southward flowin g Cape Horn Current (CHC), a northern branch of the ACC that continues toward the Drake Passage, provides a major fraction of th e present day northern Drake Passage transport (Well et al., 2003). Satellite-tracked surface drifters reveal that after crossing the Eas t Pacific Rise (EPR), Subantarctic surface water of the ACC is transported northeastward across the Southeast Pacific toward the Chilean coast at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , $75^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005). Here, presently only a minor part of the ACC is deflected northward int o the Humboldt Current System (HCS), whereas the major fraction i s deviated southward toward the Drake Passage. The CHC thu s transports a significant amount of northern ACC water toward th e Drake Passage in a narrow belt ${\sim}100{-}150~\mathrm{km}$ wide off the coas t (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005) (Figure F2).  

The drill sites in the central South Pacific are all located in th e Subantarctic Pacific. Sites U1539 and U1540 are located east of th e EPR, whereas Site U1541 lies west of the EPR. Unfortunately, th e originally proposed drill site south of the PF could not be reache d during Expedition 383 because of persistent bad weather conditions. The drilled sites (U1539–U1541) lie in the pathway of th e Subantarctic Pacific Antarctic Circumpolar Current, 100-170 nm i north of the modern mean position of the SAF in a zonal transitio n zone of the ACC. These ACC fronts form the core of the ACC an d are partly constrained by the bathymetry of the EPR in this area. A s a result of topographic forcing, frontal positions in the ACC close t o large bathymetric features remain relatively stable at seasonal an d interannual timescale, whereas over abyssal plains their location appears to be fairly unstable (Sokolov and Rintoul, 2009). The SAF a t our sites at the western and eastern flank of the EPR is therefor e partly constrained by topography and the location of major fractur e zones (e.g., Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zone). The oceanographic conditions in the South Pacific are influenced by the Southern Annula r Mode (SAM) and the Amundsen Low but also by tropical variabilit y and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Thompson et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2009; Yuan, 2004). Interannual and decadal SS T and sea ice changes are amplified in the Pacific sector. For example, a distinct increase in sea ice north of the Ross Sea embayment and  a strong sea ice decrease in the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Sea ar e documented by observational time series (1979–2011) (Maksym e t al., 2012; Stammerjohn et al., 2012).  

Deep water that upwells south of the PF feeds both Antarcti c Bottom Water (AABW) close to Antarctica and Antarctic Intermediate and Mode Water formation north of the APF (e.g., Sloyan an d Rintoul, 2001; Talley, 2013). The Southeast Pacific is known as th e major Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) formation area wher e fresh, cold, high-oxygen and low-nutrient waters are formed. Originally, it was thought that AAIW originates from the subduction o f Antarctic surface waters below the SAF (e.g., Deacon, 1937). Later, it was suggested that the formation of AAIW is directly linked to th e formation of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) (McCartney, 1977), which has similar properties in the Southeast Pacific. Mor e recent studies basically confirm the location of the major AAI W formation area in the Southeast Pacific related to deep mixed-laye r development leading to SAMW formation and finally to AAIW. The Southern Ocean’s major water mass, the Circumpolar Dee p Water (CDW), is divided into upper and lower branches. Lowe r CDW (LCDW) is identified by a salinity maximum inherited fro m North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) (Reid and Lynn, 1971; Orsi e t al., 1995). Upper CDW (UCDW) is typically identified as an oxygen-minimum layer derived from oxygen-depleted, nutrient-ric h Indian Deep Water (IDW) and North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW ) (Callahan, 1972). LCDW and UCDW are transported into th e North Pacific, where they are transformed into NPDW, and retur n to the Southern Ocean in the East Pacific along the South America n continent at $1500{-}3500\ \mathrm{m}$ water depth (Kawabe and Fujio, 2010). North of the SAF, UCDW is centered at ${\sim}1500\;\mathrm{m}$ depth and LCD W covers depths below $2000\ \mathrm{m}$ . Below LCDW, northward-spreadin g dense AABW formed in the Weddell Sea, Ross Sea, and along th e Adélie Coast covers the abyss around Antarctica. In the South Pacific, the expansion of Ross Sea Bottom Water (RSBW), the coldes t and saltiest variety of AABW, is restricted by bottom topography t o areas south of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (Orsi et al., 1995).  

# Geological setting  

The drill sites in the central South Pacific are all located on oceanic crust. Site U1541 is located ${\sim}160~\mathrm{nmi}$ west of the crest of th e EPR, north of the Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zone. The basement ag e (Figure F3) (Eagles, 2006) at this location is about $10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (late Miocene). Sites U1539 and U1540 are located at a similar distance to th e fracture zone but ${\sim}210~\mathrm{nmi}$ east of the EPR crest on slightly olde r crust with a middle Miocene basement age of ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F3).  

The sites at the Chile continental margin are all located on continental crust. Tectonically, the southern Chile margin is characterized by a complex geodynamic setting with oblique convergenc e between plates, transcurrent motion, and tectonic rotation on lan d (Polonia et al., 2007). The geodynamic setting of the southernmos t Chile margin is driven by relative movements between three mai n plates: Antarctica, Scotia, and South America. This complex settin g results in a strong segmentation of the southern Chile margin, which is clearly visible by bathymetric data and the available multichannel seismic (MCS) data (Polonia et al., 2007). Two major forearc basins at ${\sim}53^{\circ}{-}54.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ and $55^{\circ}{-}56.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ are characterized by  a thick sediment infill of as much as ${\sim}3\ \mathrm{km}$ (Figure F4). We drille d one site in the southern fore-arc basin (U1544). Seismic Line IT97- 171 (Figure F4) documents $\sim\!3\;\mathrm{km}$ of remarkably undeformed sediments in this basin (Polonia et al., 2007). This southern basin mos t likely formed after the ridge consumption $(144{-}10\,\mathrm{Ma})$ when accretion resumed and contributed to construct the outer high that provided  the  barrier  for  the  accumulation  of  continent-derive d sediments.  

North of ${\sim}53^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , subduction in the Chile trench is more orthogonal. Here, the transition between the undeformed Antarctic abyssa l plain and the lower slope is very abrupt and results in a steep slop e incised by canyons that run perpendicular to the trench axis. Recen t sediment cover is minor at the lower slope, but a relatively smal l scale sediment depocenter has been localized at the upper continental slope. This sediment drift (Site U1542) contains a sedimen t sequence as thick as ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ that most likely does not extend beyond the early Pleistocene because of high sedimentation rates.  

# Scientific objectives  

The overall goal of Expedition 383 is to improve our knowledg e of Plio/Pleistocene atmosphere-ocean dynamics of the ACC in th e Pacific and their implications for regional and global climate and atmospheric $C O_{2}$ based on sediment records with the highest possible resolution. The sites (Table T1; Figure F1) are located a t latitudes and water depths where sediments will allow the application of a wide range of siliciclastic-, carbonate-, and opal-base d proxies for reconstructing surface to deep-ocean variations an d their relation to atmosphere and cryosphere changes with unprecedented stratigraphic detail. The cores recovered during Expeditio n 383 will allow us to test two major scientific hypotheses.  

Hypothesis H1: ACC dynamics and Drake Passage throughflow conditioned the global MOC and high–low climate linkages on orbital and submillennial timescales since the Pliocene.  

The Drake Passage is the major geographic constriction for th e ACC and forms an important pathway for the return of upper waters to the Atlantic through the cold-water route of the MOC (Gordon, 1986). Resolving changes in the flow of circumpolar wate r masses through the Drake Passage is crucial for advancing our understanding of the Southern Ocean’s role in affecting ocean and climate change on a global scale. Surface and intermediate wate r masses flowing through the Drake Passage strongly affect the Atlantic MOC together with the warm-water route inflow of India n Ocean water masses through the Agulhas Current system (Beal e t al., 2011; Knorr and Lohmann, 2003). Complementary sites belo w the warm-water route were drilled during IODP Expedition 36 1 (Hall et al., 2015). The potential role of the Drake Passage throughflow in driving changes in global MOC on glacial–interglacial an d millennial timescales is not well constrained (Knorr and Lohmann, 2003; McCave et al., 2014). For the last glacial cycle, Lamy et al. (2015) reconstructed Drake Passage throughflow based on a sediment record (MD07-3128) from the Chile margin (corresponding t o Proposed Site CHI-4A) and another record from the southernmos t Argentinean continental slope and found a significant glacial decrease in Drake Passage throughflow (Figure F3). This finding i s consistent with generally reduced current velocities of the AC C during glacials and concomitant reduction in interbasin exchange i n the Southern Ocean that is most likely regulated by variations in th e SWW field over the Subantarctic Zone and changes in Antarctic se a ice extent.  

Downstream of the Drake Passage, a meridional section of sediment records from the Scotia Sea revealed little overall bottom current speed variations between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM ) and the Holocene (McCave et al., 2014). In contrast, a 500,000 y record from the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean suggests that th e ACC was weak during warm stages and strong during glacial epochs (Mazaud et al., 2010). Likewise in the southwest Pacific, th e deep western boundary current east of New Zealand intensifie d during glacial periods over the past 1.2 My (Hall et al., 2001),  a change that has been related to a northward extension of the AC C along the New Zealand continental margin. Finally, a recent densit y reconstruction (based on benthic foraminifers) across the AC C south of Australia suggested a moderate increase of the ACC flo w during the LGM (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2016). Taken together, ther e is substantial disagreement about the ACC flow speed and its potential impact on changes in Drake Passage throughflow in respons e to glacial and interglacial cycles, which prevents us from a mor e complete understanding of MOC dynamics.  

Superimposed on the long-term glacial reduction of Drake Passage throughflow, prominent high-amplitude, millennial-scale variability was observed, implying a strong sensitivity of the norther n ACC in the Southeast Pacific to suborbital climate variations (Lam y et al., 2015). Enhanced Drake Passage throughflow during Antarcti c warm periods is consistent with the previously suggested impact o f the bipolar seesaw mechanism on the Southern Ocean (e.g., Anderson et al., 2009; Lamy et al., 2007), which leads to, for example, surface water warming, enhanced upwelling, and a stronger AC C caused by southward-shifted SWW. The glacial reduction of th e cold-water route occurred in concert with the well-documented decrease of the warm-water route (Agulhas leakage; Beal et al., 2011). The data currently available thus indicate that both of these oceanographic corridors are critical for the South Atlantic contribution t o glacial MOC strength changes.  

Our sites at the Chile margin (U1542 and U1544) and in the ES P (U1543) (Figure F2) provide a unique opportunity to extend the existing 60 ky record back into the early Pleistocene and Pliocene an d address important questions such as the role of long-term, orbitalscale, and millennial-scale changes in ACC strength and Drake Passage throughflow in warmer-than-present interglacials (e.g., Marin e Isotope Stages [MISs] 5e, 11, and 31) or the Pliocene warm perio d and the link to Antarctic climate fluctuations over multiple glacial– interglacial cycles.  

In the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, atmosphere-ocea n changes between the high, middle, and low latitudes are strongl y linked. Pronounced past changes in surface-ocean properties a t both millennial and orbital timescales, particularly SSTs, indicate a n exceptional climate sensitivity to external and internal forcings o n these timescales. Glacial–interglacial amplitudes in Subantarcti c SSTs are generally ${\tt{>}}4^{\circ}C$ in the Atlantic (Gersonde et al., 2005; Martínez-García et al., 2010), Indian (e.g., De Deckker et al., 2012; Lorrey et al., 2012), and Pacific Southern Ocean (Caniupán et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2012; Pahnke et al., 2003). Millennial-scale fluctuations with amplitudes of ${\sim}2^{\circ}{-}3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ are observed at continental margin sites in the Subantarctic Pacific during the last glacial (Barrow s et al., 2007; Caniupán et al., 2011; Lamy et al., 2004; Pahnke et al., 2003).  

High-amplitude glacial–interglacial SST changes in the Subantarctic Pacific Southern Ocean (Ho et al., 2012) are closely couple d to those observed in the subtropical ESP, implying large shifts of th e northern ACC system and export of Subantarctic surface wate r masses into the HCS. This variability is probably directly related t o variations in the strength and position of the ACC fronts, the SWW, and Drake Passage throughflow (Lamy et al., 2015) (Figure F5).  

Along the Chile margin, the reconstructed glacial cooling implies a stronger northward extension of the Antarctic cold-water influence in the ESP during glacials (Ho et al., 2012) compared to th e central Pacific (Figure F3). The significant glacial decrease in Drak e Passage transport accompanied by a reduction of the ACC transport strongly reduced the interbasin water mass exchange in th e Southern Ocean and enhanced the high–low latitude exchange i n the Pacific Eastern Boundary Current system (Figure F3). The reacceleration of subantarctic Drake Passage transport matches the major deglacial warming in the Subantarctic Southeast Pacific an d South Atlantic (Barker and Diz, 2014), suggesting a close couplin g of Drake Passage throughflow to the initiation of Southern Hemisphere warming.  

Similar to the glacial–interglacial pattern, the inferred millennial-scale changes in Drake Passage throughflow (Lamy et al., 2015 ) are paralleled by SST changes in proxy records from the Southeas t Pacific (ODP Site 1233) (Kaiser and Lamy, 2010) that extend nort h to the cold tongue in the eastern tropical Pacific (Lea et al., 2006). These data imply that substantial changes in the oceanographic dynamics of the South Pacific Gyre are related to the northward deflection of ACC waters at millennial timescales. Paleoceanographi c reconstructions based on our sites at the Chile margin (U1542 an d U1544) and in the ESP (U1543) in combination with ODP Leg 20 2 sites (Figure F2) (e.g., Dekens et al., 2007; Lamy et al., 2004; Pena e t al., 2008; Rincon-Martinez et al., 2009) and the JR100 expeditio n (http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expedi  

tions/JR100_379T.html) sites will allow us to estimate changes i n the coupling between the ACC and the tropical Pacific over variou s timescales and at warmer-than-present climate states. High–lo w latitude linkages (both modern and past) in the oceanographicall y little explored ESP are important for global climate. The suggeste d enhanced glacial northward export of cold-water masses to th e tropical Pacific reinforces earlier modeling studies showing the importance of southerly derived surface and intermediate wate r masses in the tropical Pacific for global cooling during the LG M (Liu et al., 2002).  

Our drill sites will allow us to better constrain the latitudina l shifts of the Southern Ocean fronts over time to understand the resulting changes in ACC transport, intrabasin mixing, and AAI W production over a wider range of climate states. For example, reconstructions of past changes in the latitudinal position of the SAF suggest as much as $9^{\circ}$ latitude northward shifts during glacials, wherea s other areas suggest no shift at all (Kohfeld et al., 2013). Smalle r shifts probably occurred where the front is bathymetrically confined, like in the vicinity of the EPR (central South Pacific sites). Large shifts likely occurred in the eastern Subantarctic Pacific wit h the SAF potentially located north of the Drake Passage during pea k glacials (Gersonde et al., 2003; Ho et al., 2012; Lamy et al., 2015). A s stated above, these changes may substantially affect the Drake Passage throughflow and low–high latitude exchange of heat and of nutrients with major implications for the global climate development. Further south, Benz et al. (2016) reconstructed a glacial winter se a ice (WSI) expansion by ${\sim}2^{\circ}{-}3^{\circ}$ in latitude in the western part of th e Pacific sector and an even stronger shift ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ in latitude) of both th e SACCF and the WSI edge in the central part (Figures F6, F7). Thi s west–east differentiation in the winter SST pattern and sea ice extent can be related to differences in topographic and atmospheri c forcing (Benz et al., 2016).  

Despite the strong climate sensitivity of the Subantarctic Southern Ocean, only one SST record is available (ODP Site 1090 in th e Subantarctic Atlantic) that reaches back to the Pliocene (Figure F8) . Here, the major cooling phase after ${\sim}1.6\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ coincides with th e emergence of the eastern tropical Pacific cold tongue and an intensification  of  the  meridional  temperature  gradients  (MartínezGarcía et al., 2010) (Figure F4). The ANDRILL records suggest tha t high-latitude climate cooling between 3.0 and $2.5~\mathrm{Ma}$ drove bot h the WAIS and EAIS toward their present expanded cold polar stat e (Naish et al., 2009). The intensification of Antarctic cooling resulte d in strengthened SWW and northward migration of Southern Ocea n fronts, which would restrict water exchange between ocean basin s (reduced MOC) beginning after $3.3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (McKay et al., 2012). War m early Pleistocene and Pliocene SSTs are consistent with the poleward expanded warm pool (Brierley et al., 2009)  

Our sites from the central South Pacific (U1539–U1541) will allow a more comprehensive assessment of the temperature evolutio n of the Pacific Southern Ocean and its relation to atmospheric variations of the SWW, sea ice, and AIS variability during cold an d warmer-than-present (e.g., MISs 5, 11, and 31 and the Pliocen e warming) time periods. Information on warm periods is critical t o assess the Southern Ocean’s role under future warming, especiall y for AIS melting and associated sea level rise because ice sheet modeling together with modern observations show that oceanic forcin g is the most important forcing mechanism (Pollard and DeCont o 2009; Paolo et al., 2015).  

Moreover, temperature records from our high-resolution sites a t the Chile margin (U1542 and U1544) and central South Pacifi c (U1539 and U1540) will allow us to compare millennial-scale variations between the Pacific Southern Ocean and Antarctica for a tim e interval that is well beyond the reach of ice cores. Even on a globa l scale, such millennial-scale temperature records back into the Pliocene are rare (e.g., IODP Site U1313: Naafs et al., 2013; ODP Sit e 980: McManus et al. 1999).  

Hypothesis H2: Variations in the Pacific ACC determine the physical and biological characteristics of the oceanic carbon pump and atmospheric $C O_{2}.$  

Atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere  interactions  and  teleconnections between high and low latitudes play an important role in understanding processes and feedbacks of past and future climat e change, and the Subantarctic Southern Ocean provides the majo r link between Antarctica and the low latitudes. In the Souther n Ocean, these interactions are believed to control sea ice cover, AI S dynamics, upper ocean stratification, biological nutrient utilization, and exposure rates of deep water. They have been considered to pla y a key role in explaining the variability in atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentrations. At low latitudes, oceanic circulation changes have profound impacts on large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, particularly in regard to trade and westerly winds. The SW W strongly impact the upwelling of carbon-rich deep-water masses i n the Southern Ocean affecting atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ (e.g., Anderson e t al., 2009) and also control the return flow of intermediate waters t o the tropics (Figure F9). Moreover, the SWW exert an importan t control on the upwelling of relatively warm deep water onto th e West Antarctic continental shelf in the Pacific sector where i t causes sub–ice shelf melting and mass loss of the WAIS (e.g., Stei g et al., 2012). Thus, the SWW are thought to play a key role in pas t and future climate change, and yet their strength and position i n colder and warmer climates relative to today remain a wide-ope n question (Kohfeld et al., 2013).  

In the modern Southern Ocean, deep waters with high dissolve d inorganic carbon (DIC) and major nutrient concentrations are carried to the surface by wind-driven upwelling and density-drive n overturning. However, phytoplankton growth is limited by the scarcity of iron, and these nutrients return to the subsurface before the y are completely consumed. This incomplete utilization of nutrient s represents a substantial leak in the modern global biological pum p because it allows the escape of deeply sequestered carbon back t o the atmosphere, keeping atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ levels high during interglacial stages. An increase in the efficiency of the global biologica l pump can be accomplished either by decreasing the physical cyclin g of deep water through the surface of the Southern Ocean or by increasing the degree to which surface nutrients are consumed by marine organisms (e.g., as a result of increasing iron availability relativ e to other nutrients) (Sigman and Boyle, 2000; Sigman et al., 2010).  

Paleoceanographic records (mainly from the Atlantic sector o f the Southern Ocean) indicate that ice age productivity was lowe r (Anderson et al., 2009; Kohfeld et al., 2005; Jaccard et al., 2013) i n the Antarctic zone (i.e., south of the PF) and nutrient consumptio n was higher (Robinson and Sigman, 2008; Studer et al., 2015). Thes e data indicate that the Antarctic zone was more strongly stratifie d during ice ages, reducing the Antarctic leak in the biological pum p and therefore contributing to the lowering of atmospheric $C O_{2}$ during glacial times.  

In the Subantarctic Atlantic, higher dust flux, increased productivity and nutrient consumption, and lower atmospheric $C O_{2}$ covary during peak glacial times and millennial cold events, which ha s been associated with iron fertilization (e.g., Frank et al., 2000; Kumar  et  al.,  1995;  Martínez-García  et  al.,  2009,  2011,  2014). Martínez-García et al. (2009, 2014) suggested that around 40–5 0 ppmv of the glacial atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ decline can be attributed t o iron fertilization (Figure F10), which is in good agreement wit h model estimates (Hain et al., 2010; Chalk et al., 2017; Brovkin et al., 2007). At ODP Site 1090, the first significant rise in ice age dust an d iron deposition over the past 4 My occurred at ${\sim}2.7\ \mathrm{Ma}_{}$ , and th e most dramatic rise in dust deposition occurred across the midPleistocene transition (Martínez-García et al., 2011).  

For the past million years, higher dust deposition during glacia l periods compared to interglacials has also been documented for th e Pacific Southern Ocean, suggesting an eastward extension of the influence of Australian and/or New Zealand dust sources (Lamy et al., 2014). In this area, dust fluxes follow the same glacial–interglacial fluctuations, but absolute glacial fluxes in the Subantarctic Pacifi c are about half of those in the Atlantic Southern Ocean (Figure F11) . As in the Atlantic sector, export production in the Subantarcti c Zone of the Pacific sector over the past ${\sim}450\,\mathrm{ky}$ is higher during glacial times, but in contrast to the Subantarctic Atlantic (MartínezGarcía et al., 2014), the relationship between productivity and nutrient consumption has not been evaluated in detail yet. Our preliminary data suggest that nutrient consumption increased in respons e to iron fertilization (A. Martínez-García, unpubl. data).  

The drill cores from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocea n will allow exploration of the glacial–interglacial changes in biological productivity both north and south of the Antarctic PF in mor e detail. Core records, including those from ODP Leg 177, show tha t the glacial-time biological productivity in the Subantarctic Zone o f the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean increased during the glacial periods of the late Quaternary and decreased in the Antarcti c Zone of this sector (Diekmann, 2007; Jaccard et al., 2013). The glacial productivity decrease in the Antarctic Zone is under debate an d may have been caused either by stratification of the water colum n (Sigman et al., $2004;$ Jaccard et al., 2005) or expansion of Antarcti c sea ice coverage (Hillenbrand and Cortese, 2006). The new drill cor e records proposed here will allow us to test whether this pattern i s also observed in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, as indicated by Bradtmiller et al. (2009), and will help to identify the caus e for the potential glacial productivity decrease south of the PF.  

Our drill sites at the central South Pacific (U1539–U1541) wil l provide robust data to test to which extent processes that are activ e in the Atlantic sector can be translated to the Pacific sector, thus allowing the construction of a more global picture of the Souther n Ocean’s role in nutrient distribution and biogenic export production and their impact on $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ variations. It is necessary to solv e these issues before the impact on the ocean carbon cycle under different climate boundary conditions can be modeled more realistically.  

Moreover, the ESP site (U1543) and Chile margin sites (U154 2 and U1544) will provide a long-term record of variability of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS). Both terrestrial records from Patagoni a and records of ice-rafted debris (IRD) in marine sediment core s from the Chile margin (MD07-3128 at Proposed Site CHI-4A) indicate substantial millennial-scale variability of the PIS parallelin g dust input changes recorded in Antarctic ice cores. This covarianc e implies a causal link between ice sheet advances and dust availability (Caniupán et al., 2011; Sugden et al., 2009). Thus, the Chile margin sites will provide important baseline information for dus t variability in the Atlantic sector of the ACC.  

Our two hypotheses contain a large number of challenging research targets critical for paleoceanography and paleoclimatolog y on a global scale. Our sites in the central South Pacific represent th e first drill cores in the Subantarctic Pacific sector of the Souther n Ocean. Through comparison to the ESP site, we include a particularly sensitive ocean area where glacial/interglacial changes ar e strongly amplified. Finally, the Chilean Margin Sites provide information on changes at shallower water depths together with change s in the PIS and potential links to dust input in the Atlantic sector o f the Southern Ocean.  

# Site summaries Site U1539  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1539 (Proposed Site CSP-2B) is located in the centra l South Pacific at $56^{\circ}09.0655^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $115^{\circ}08.038^{\prime}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{\sim}1600\mathrm{\;nmi}$ west of th e Magellan Strait at $4070\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F12). The site sits a t the eastern flank of the southernmost EPR, ${\sim}220\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ from th e modern seafloor spreading axis, and is underlain by oceanic crus t formed at ${\sim}10{-}12\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Eagles, 2006). Assuming a constant seafloo r half-spreading rate of ${\sim}4.5\ \mathrm{cm}$ (Pitman and Heirtzler, 1966), th e plate tectonic backtrack path of Site U1539 moves the site westward. This translates to an early Pliocene position ${\sim}100$ nmi close r to the crest of the EPR at a water depth shallower by several hundred meters. At a smaller scale, the site is located in a northeast– southwest oriented, ${\sim}5~\mathrm{nmi}$ wide trough that parallels the orientation of the EPR. The adjacent ridges rise to ${\sim}3000\mathrm{~m~}$ water dept h northwest of the site and to ${\sim}3500\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth to the southeas t (Figure F12).  

Site U1539 is located on MCS Line AWI-201000013 (Figur e F13A) close to the intersection with Line AWI-2010000011 (Gersonde, 2011). The seismic cross-lines indicate ${\sim}650\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sediments above oceanic basement. Sediments are mostly well stratifie d with flat-lying reflectors. Low to moderately reflecting layers become stronger deeper than ${\sim}100{-}120\;\mathrm{m}$ sediment depth. Sedimen t echo sound (Parasound) profiles (Gersonde, 2011) reveal excellen t penetration $\left(>\!150\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering (Figure F13B), suggesting a succession of fine-grained soft sediments with varying lithologic composition.  

Site U1539 lies in the pathway of the SAP ACC, ${\sim}100$ nmi nort h of the modern average SAF, in a zonal transition zone of the ACC. West of the site, the ACC and associated fronts are strongly steere d by the topography of seafloor spreading systems (Udintsev and Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zone systems), whereas to the east the vas t Amundsen Sea basin does not influence the ACC strongly.  

SSTs  seasonally vary between ${\sim}2^{\circ}C$ (July–September) an d ${\sim}6.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (January–March). The area is located west of the main Antarctic Intermediate and Mode Water formation regions in th e Southeast Pacific. The $4070\:\mathrm{m}$ water depth places Site U1539 withi n  

LCDW, close to the boundary to AABW (Figure F14). This hydrographic setting makes it ideal to evaluate past changes in frontal position, associated export production, ACC current speed an d position, and eolian dust and IRD input during the Pleistocene. The main objectives at Site U1539 were to  

• Recover a moderate- to high-resolution Subantarctic Pliocene– Quaternary sediment record close to the SAF; • Investigate the sequencing of siliceous and calcareous oozes, allowing for a wide range of paleoceanographic reconstructions; • Reconstruct high-amplitude Subantarctic SSTs and sea ice variations; • Provide a record of lowermost CDW and glacial AABW; • Reconstruct productivity (opal versus carbonate), nutrient distribution, and dust-productivity coupling; and • Recover a potential far-field record of WAIS variability.  

# Operations  

The first core of Expedition 383 was taken in Hole U1539A a t $0445~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 June 2019 from 4071.1 meters below sea level (mbsl). We used the advanced piston corer (APC) system to penetrate fro m the seafloor to 107.6 meters core depth below seafloor, Method  A (CSF-A) (Cores 383-U1539A-1H through 12H) and recover 104.7 5 m of core $(97\%)$ . The hole was terminated after Core 12H because o f rough weather and sea conditions. Shattered liners were recorde d on Cores 5H and 11H. Shear pins were sheared prematurely o n Cores 1H, 11H, and 12H.  

After $27\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of waiting on weather, Hole U1539B was spudded a t $0540~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 June. Cores 383-U1539A-1H through 3H recovere d $21.9~\mathrm{m}$ $78\%$ recovery), but Cores 2H and 3H were misfires, so w e decided to terminate the hole and wait for seas to further improv e before continuing operations.  

By $1245\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , heave had fallen to $_{3.0\mathrm{~m~}}$ and we resumed coring . Hole U1539C was started with Core 383-U1539C-1H returning  a full $9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ core barrel. This allowed us to determine a seafloor dept h of 4070.2 mbsl. Full-length APC coring continued to refusal at 240. 1 m CSF-A (Core 26H). Half-length APC (HLAPC) coring was the n used to deepen the hole, and coring terminated after Core 32F a t $268.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. A total of 32 cores were taken in this hole using th e APC and HLAPC coring tools. Formation temperature measurements were taken with Cores 4H, 13H, and 16H. Partial stroke s were recorded on Cores 24H–27F with high overpull on Core s 17H–26H. A misfire was recorded on Core 31F.  

Hole U1539D was spot-cored to fill in coring gaps from the previous holes. The hole was spudded at $1405\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 June, drilled ahea d without recovery to $47.5\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , where coring began, and continued to $198\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with seven drilled intervals totaling $68.7~\mathrm{m}$ .  A total of 14 APC cores were taken over the $129.3\textrm{m}$ cored interval with a recovery of $128.15\mathrm{~m~}(99\%)$ . The hole reached maximu m depth at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 June, and the drill string was recovered, endin g the hole and Site U1539. Misfires were recorded on Cores 383- U1539D-2H, 3H, 6H, 8H, and 9H, and a partial stroke was recorde d on Core 18H. No temperature or orientation measurements wer e taken in this hole. After recovering the drill string, the rig floor wa s secured for transit at $_{0130\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ . The thrusters were raised, and the se a voyage to Site U1540 began at $0224\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 June.  

# Principal results  

At Site U1539, a $268.1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick continuous sequence of Holocen e to early Pleistocene sediments was recovered with a bottom-hol e age of ${\sim}1.3\,M\mathbf{a}$ and a mean sedimentation rate of ${\sim}20.6\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . Hol e U1539C recovered the deepest cored sediments at $268.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

The recovered $247.50\mathrm{~m~}$ of core spans one lithologic unit with tw o subunits consisting of interbedded calcareous and siliceous biogenic ooze (Figure F15). Site U1539 sediments can broadly be divided into two categories: diatom ooze with varying amounts o f calcareous and biosiliceous components and biogenic carbonat e ooze with varying amounts of biosiliceous and other calcareou s components. Siliceous microfossils show relatively good preservation and are abundant throughout the record. Preservation of calcareous microfossils varies from moderate to good.  

Five primary lithofacies were identified, and they mostly diffe r in their proportions of calcareous and biosiliceous components. Secondary defining attributes include degree of diagenetic alteration, bioturbation, and in the case of Lithofacies 5, microfossil siz e and sedimentary structure. Lithofacies 1 comprises distinct centimeter-scale diatom mats in a biogenic ooze matrix. This facies ca n be distinguished from Lithofacies 2, which is characterized by sequences of more pronounced and stacked diatom mats with a nea r absence of diatom ooze matrix. Lithofacies 3 is the dominant lithofacies at Site U1539. It consists of light greenish gray to gray carbonate-bearing or carbonate-rich diatomaceous ooze that exhibit s moderate to heavy bioturbation. Lithofacies 4 consists of white t o light gray diatom-bearing to diatom-rich nannofossil or calcareou s oozes that occur as thin beds generally $<\!3\;\mathrm{m}$ thick with moderate t o heavy bioturbation. Lithofacies 5 corresponds to foraminifera l oozes and sands that occur sporadically as centimeter- to decimeter-scale layers characterized by a sharp basal contact and distinc t cross-bedding observable in X-ray images.  

We divided the Site U1539 stratigraphic sequence into Subunit s IA and IB based on the relative abundance of the five defined lithofacies. With the exception of Lithofacies 5 in Subunit IB, all lithofacies are present in both subunits, but the thickness, frequency, an d overall occurrence differs between the two. Subunit IA is characterized by the frequent occurrence of ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ thick beds of calcareou s and nannofossil ooze (Lithofacies 4) and limited occurrence of diatom mats (Lithofacies 2). In contrast, Subunit IB has only a few occurrences of Lithofacies 4 and is largely dominated by beds of thic k and continuous diatom mats (Figure F16). Carbonate-bearing an d carbonate-rich diatomaceous ooze (Lithofacies 3) is the dominan t lithofacies in both subunits and does not provide a useful means t o divide the stratigraphy because of its widespread occurrence. Th e prominent white to light gray calcareous beds associated wit h Lithofacies 4 drive the high-amplitude variations in RGB blue an d $L^{\ast}$ values. In general, we observed high-amplitude, low-frequenc y variations above the $125\,\mathrm{~m~}$ core composite depth below seafloor, Method A (CCSF-A), subunit boundary and more frequent lowamplitude variations below it (Figure F16).  

Biostratigraphic age assignments are consistent with each othe r and are mainly derived from diatom, radiolarian, and calcareou s nannofossil datums. Diatom, radiolarian, and nannofossil biostratigraphy detected no major hiatuses, indicating that a continuou s sediment sequence from the early Pleistocene through the Holocene was recovered at this site.  

We could not observe unambiguous evidence for geomagneti c reversals in any of the holes at Site U1539. This is probably due t o low natural remanent magnetization (NRM) intensities that coul d be related to the high diatom content of the sediments. Therefore, the paleomagnetic record cannot contribute to the age model fo r Site U1539.  

We analyzed samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bulk sediment chemistry at a resolution of three per cor e in Hole U1539A and three per core from 78.9 to $120\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, tw o per core from 120 to $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and one per core from $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the bottom of Hole U1539C at $266.41\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Headspace samples were not collected from HLAPC cores. Methan e concentration is low at this site overall. It gradually increases downhole, averaging 12.3 ppmv and never exceeding 18.4 ppmv. Ethan e and propane remain below detection limit throughout the entir e hole. In Hole U1539A, alkalinity increases in the uppermost $10.6\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $\sim\!5\;\mathrm{mM}$ , likely caused by anaerobic organic matter remineralization. pH values also increase from 7.7 at the surface to ${\sim}8$ a t $2.94\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and remain constant with depth. Interstitial wate r magnesium  and  lithium  concentrations  appear  conservativ e throughout the sediment column. Dissolved manganese concentrations increase sharply from below detection limit in the mudlin e sample to a maximum of $60\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $7.57\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, indicating anaerobic, reductive dissolution of manganese oxides within the uppermost $3\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment.  

The composite carbonate record at Site U1539 (Holes U1539 A and U1539C) shows downhole variability ranging from 2.9 to 92. 8 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ and a strong correlation with RGB blue and reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ measurements (Figure F17) and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bul k density. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentration has a mea n value of $0.40\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ , and values range between a minimum of $0.14\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ and a maximum of $0.76~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Hole U1539C). The mean value o f TOC/total nitrogen (TN) is often ${>}10$ from $0.8\textrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hol e U1539A and to $115.2\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ in Hole U1539C, suggesting that th e location of Site U1539 received a fraction of terrestrial organic matter input across these depths.  

Physical properties measurements at Site U1539 included nondestructive whole-round measurements of GRA bulk density, magnetic  susceptibility  (MS),  Whole-Round  Multisensor  Logge r (WRMSL) $P$ -wave velocity, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) o n core sections from Holes U1539A–U1539D. Additional physical properties collected include thermal conductivity (TCon) on wholeround cores from all holes. Downhole changes in physical propert y characteristics overall are in good agreement with the lithofacie s defined based on sedimentologic characteristics (Figure F18). I n general, diatom ooze lithofacies (1 and 2) correspond to high MS, low bulk density, and high porosity (Figure F18). The lowest densities and highest porosities occur in diatom mats within diato m ooze, which is the recurring dominant Lithofacies 2. In contrast, intervals that are predominantly calcareous nannofossil ooze (Lithofacies 4 and 5) correspond with decreased NGR, high bulk density, low $P.$ -wave velocity, low to moderate MS, and low to moderate porosity. Over most of the record, GRA bulk density shows an anticorrelation with the NGR-derived potassium concentrations and MS. The NGR record also exhibits $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m}$ scale cyclicity, particularl y in the interval from ${\sim}10$ to 135 CSF-A. NGR data also imply tha t total counts and the derived potassium concentrations can be use d as a semiquantitative proxy for the abundance of terrigenous material delivered by dust or sea ice and iceberg transport.  

Correlations between holes at Site U1539 were accomplishe d using the Correlator software (version 3.0). We constructed a splic e for the upper portion of the site from 0 to $219.80\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A usin g Holes U1539A–U1539D. However, the splice contains several gaps, as detailed below. Deeper than $219.80\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF-A}$ , only a single hol e (U1539C) was drilled; thus, Cores 383-U1539C-22H through 32 F were appended to the splice with gaps set between each core to th e bottom of the hole. The composite depth scale is anchored to th e mudline of Core 383-U1539A-1H, which is assigned as $_0\textrm{m}$ CCSFA.  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic results, mainly including diatom and nannofossil age markers. These data suggest that the sedimentary sequence recovered a t Site U1539 covers the past ${\sim}1.3$ My (Figure F19). For a pelagic setting, sedimentation rates are extraordinarily high, reaching on average $17\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ back to $0.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and even higher values of ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ from $\mathord{\sim}0.9$ to $1.3\mathrm{~Ma}$ . This biostratigraphic age model is generall y consistent with preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed onboard based on physical property data such as color measurement s (RGB blue) and GRA bulk density.  

The combination of nearly continuous recovery, very high sedimentation rates driven by high diatom productivity and potentia l sediment focusing, clear patterns in physical properties and sediment color, and a rich array of well-preserved diatoms combine d with calcareous microfossils will provide unprecedented opportunities for improving our understanding of the dynamics of the AC C and its link to global carbon cycle changes at orbital and suborbita l timescales.  

# Site U1540  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1540 (Proposed Site CSP-7A) is located in the centra l South Pacific at $55^{\circ}08.467^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $114^{\circ}50.515^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ $\mathord{\sim}1600$ nmi west of th e Magellan Strait at $3580\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F20). The site sits a t the eastern flank of the southernmost EPR within the Eltanin-Thar p Fracture Zone, ${\sim}130\ \mathrm{nmi}$ from the modern seafloor spreading axis, and is underlain by oceanic crust formed at the EPR about $6{-}8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ago (Eagles, 2006). Assuming overall constant seafloor half-spreading rates of ${\sim}4.5\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ (Pitman and Heirtzler, 1966), the plate tectonic backtrack path of Site U1540 moves the site westward to a n early Pliocene position ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{nmi}$ closer to the crest of the EPR at  a water depth shallower by several hundred meters. At a smaller scale, the site is located at the northeast end of a ridge that parallels th e orientation of the EPR.  

Site U1540 is crossed by a sediment echo sound (Parasound ) profile that is oriented northwest–southeast. The Parasound profil e documents excellent penetration $(>\!150\,\mathrm{~m)}$ with distinct layerin g (Figure F21), suggesting a succession of fine-grained soft sediment s with varying lithologic composition. The site is also located ${\sim}2\;\mathrm{nmi}$ northwest of site survey Core PS75/56 (Gersonde, 2011) (Figur e F5).  

Site U1540 lies in the pathway of the SAP ACC, ${\sim}170\;\mathrm{nmi}$ nort h of the modern mean position of the SAF in a zonal transition zon e of the ACC. West of the site, the ACC and the associated fronts ar e strongly steered by the topography of seafloor spreading system s (Udintsev and Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zone systems), whereas t o the east the vast Amundsen Sea basin does not influence the position of the ACC strongly.  

SSTs seasonally vary between ${\sim}2.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (July–September) an d ${\sim}7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (January–March). The area is located west of the main Antarctic Intermediate and Mode Water formation regions in th e Southeast Pacific. The $3580\,\mathrm{m}$ water depth places Site U1540 withi n LCDW (Figure F14). This hydrographic setting makes it ideal t o evaluate past changes in frontal position, associated export production, ACC current speed and position, and eolian dust and IRD input during the Pleistocene and Pliocene.  

The main objectives at Site U1540 were to • Recover a moderate- to high-resolution Subantarctic Pliocene– Quaternary sediment record close to the SAF;  

• Investigate the sequencing of siliceous and calcareous oozes, allowing for a wide range of paleoceanographic reconstructions; • Reconstruct high-amplitude Subantarctic SSTs and sea ice variations; • Provide a record of LCDW and glacial AABW; • Reconstruct export production (opal versus carbonate), nutrient distribution, and dust-productivity coupling; and • Recover a potential far-field record of WAIS variability.  

# Operations  

The sea voyage to Site U1540 began at $0224\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 7 June 2019. I t was a short $61\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit that was completed in only $6.1\,\mathrm{h}$ , and th e ship arrived on site at $0830\,\mathrm{h}$ . The thrusters were lowered, and th e vessel was in full dynamic positioning mode over the site coordinates by $0929\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill crew made up an APC/extended core barrel (XCB) bottom-hole assembly (BHA) and lowered the drill strin g to the seafloor, placing the bit at 2171 meters below the rig floo r (mbrf) by $1645~\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel began experiencing heave above $7~\mathrm{m}$ with a roll of ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ at that time, and it was decided to wait for the sea s to calm before continuing operations.  

By $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 June, the seas had calmed sufficiently to continu e operations. With an estimated depth of 3600.6 mbrf (calculated b y the precision depth recorder [PDR]), the bit was lowered to 3595. 0 mbrf to spud Hole U1540A. Core 383-U1540A-1H recovered $9.0\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and determined a seafloor depth of 3584.6 mbsl. Hol e U1540A was deepened to $150\mathrm{\;m\;CSF-A}$ , and Cores 1H–16H recovered $155.1\mathrm{~m~}(103\%)$ by $0815~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 June. The top drive was se t back, and the bit was pulled to 3561 mbrf, clearing the seafloor a t $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 June and ending Hole U1540A. Formation temperatur e measurements were taken with the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, and 16H, and orientation measurements were taken on all cores. Misfires wer e recorded on Cores 1H, 7H, and 16H. A misfire on Core 7H cause d an unreliable temperature reading.  

The vessel was moved $^{20\mathrm{~m~}}$ east, and the bit was lowered t o 3575 mbrf to spud Hole U1540B. Our first attempt to take a mudline core did not retrieve any sediment. The bit was then lowere d $9.5\textrm{m}$ to $384.5~\mathrm{mbrf},$ and Hole U1540B was started at $1220~\mathrm{h}$ on  9 June. Based on the recovery in Core 383-U1540B-1H, the seafloo r was calculated at 3580.0 mbsl. APC coring continued to $150\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF}}.$ - A with three drilled intervals (totaling $10\ \mathrm{m},$ ) to help obtain goo d overlap with cores from Hole U1540A. A total of 16 cores wer e taken over a $140.8\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $101\%$ recovery. Misfires were recorded on Cores 1H, 6H, $8\mathrm{H}$ , and 11H. The bit was raised, clearin g the seafloor at $0958\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 June and ending Hole U1540B.  

After coring Hole U1540B, permission was requested from th e IODP Environmental Protection and Safety Panel to extend the allowed penetration depth at Site U1540 from 150 to $275~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. This request was based on the successful recovery of a complete an d continuous Pleistocene sedimentary record in Holes U1540A an d U1540B. The increase in penetration depth would allow us to extend this record into the Pliocene, which was expected directly below the already cored maximum depth of $150~\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. A n additional reason for the request was the prevailing sea conditions, which predicted two additional days of reasonably calm seas, thu s allowing for further drilling, whereas significantly worst sea conditions were forecast at our two other primary sites in the South Pacific.  

Hole U1540C was spudded $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1540B at 111 0 h on 10 June with the bit positioned at 3587.5 mbrf. Core 383-  

U1540C-1H recovered $6.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , but the top of the core lacked th e characteristic light brown oxidized layer that would have indicate d the recovery of a good sediment–water interface. Therefore, we decided to end Hole U1540C and attempt another mudline core.  

We repositioned the vessel $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ west of Hole U1540C an d started Hole U1540D with the bit at 3587.5 mbrf. Core 383- U1540D-1H recovered $8.9\textrm{m}(100\%)$ with a noticeable light brow n sediment layer at the top of the core. The amount of core recovere d determined a water depth of 3577.5 mbsl. APC coring continued t o $79.2~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A with three interspersed, short drilled intervals to ensure adequate core overlap for stratigraphic correlation betwee n Holes U1540A, U1540B, and U1540C.  

Permission to extend the penetration depth at Site U1540 to 27 5 m CSF-A was received while retrieving Core 383-U1540D-11 H from $79.2\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . At that point, we drilled ahead without recovery to $131.0\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ before resuming coring operations. The AP C coring system was redeployed, and the hole was deepened until w e reached APC refusal at $210.5\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ . Cores 21H and 22H $(207.0-$ $210.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ) recovered just 3.39 and $_{0.5\textrm{m}}$ of sediment, respectively, with numerous rock fragments. We chose to deploy the XC B system for one more core in an attempt to recover more of the presumed basement material, but after coring for $45\;\mathrm{min}$ with only 0. 5 m of advancement, the core barrel was pulled back on board wit h no recovery. We raised the bit, which cleared the seafloor at $1710\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 June, ending Hole U1540D. A total of 19 cores were take n over a $151.8~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $151\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered $(99\%)$ . Misfires wer e recorded on Cores 4H and 6H, and partial strokes were recorded o n Cores 22H and 23H.  

The vessel was offset another $20\textrm{m}$ west of Hole U1540D, an d the bit was spaced out for spudding another hole using the seafloo r depth calculated from Hole U1540D. Hole U1540E was spudded a t $1840~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 June and drilled ahead without recovery to $135.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. At that point, we deployed the APC system and cored continuously until APC refusal at $213.3~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Cores 383-U1540E2H through 10H). The pipe was recovered on board, and the bi t cleared the rotary table at $1900~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 June. The rig was secure d and readied for transit by $1905\,\mathrm{h}$ . A total of eight cores were taken i n Hole U1540E with the APC system over a $76.0~\mathrm{m}$ interval with 78. 9 m recovered $(104\%)$ . Core 10H experienced a partial stroke. Tw o drilled intervals advanced $137.0\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

With the seas too high to raise the thrusters, the vessel waite d on weather until the seas calmed down at $1545~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 June. Th e thrusters were then raised, and the vessel began the transit to Sit e U1541.  

# Principal results  

A ${\sim}213\mathrm{~m~}$ thick continuous sequence of Holocene to early Pliocene sediments was recovered at Site U1540 (Figure F22). A bottom-hole age of ${\sim}4.8\mathrm{~Ma}$ and a mean sedimentation rate of ${\sim}4.5$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ were determined. The deepest cored sediments were recovered in Hole U1540E. A spliced sedimentary sequence ${\sim}227\mathrm{~m~}$ i n length was constructed from Holes U1540A–U1540E. Five primar y lithofacies were identified at this site (Figure F23). The numberin g of facies is based on all facies documented for Expedition 383 so far. The sequence is dominated by light greenish gray to gray carbonate-bearing to carbonate-rich diatom oozes (Lithofacies 2). Thes e are frequently interbedded with light gray or light greenish gray diatom-bearing to diatom-rich nannofossil or calcareous oozes (Lithofacies 3). Less abundant are white to very light gray nannofossi l oozes of heavily bioturbated, massive appearance (Lithofacies 4 ) and greenish gray to gray clay-bearing to clay-rich biogenic ooze s (Lithofacies 6 and 7). Based on the distribution and co-occurrenc e of the defined lithofacies, we divided the Site U1540 sedimentar y sequence into two lithostratigraphic units and the upper Unit I int o two subunits, IA and IB. Subunit IA extends downhole to ${\sim}58\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A $({\sim}62\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A})$ ) and is dominated by Lithofacies 2 and thi n intercalated beds of Lithofacies 4. It is therefore broadly equivalen t to Subunit IA at Site U1539. Subunit IB spans from ${\sim}58$ to ${\sim}156\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ( $^{\sim62}$ to $178\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A})$ ) and shows an increased occurrenc e of Lithofacies 3 and a decreased contribution of Lithofacies 2. Lithofacies 1, 4, and 6 are virtually missing in this subunit. Unit I I extends from $178~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A to the base of the record at $227.1\textrm{m}$ CCSF-A $165.83{-}210.50\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1540D and $165.33-$ $213.3\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hole U1540E). This unit is marked by a significant increase in the proportion of calcareous Lithofacies 3 and  4 and the appearance of the clay-bearing to clay-rich Lithofacies 6 i n the lowermost ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{m}$ of the unit. Lithofacies 7 occupies parts of th e lowermost $\mathord{\sim}8\;\mathrm{m}$ of Unit II, is pale yellowish brown to dark reddis h brown, and is visually enriched in iron (hydr)oxides. The last tw o sections of Core 383-U1540D-21H and the core catcher of Cor e 22H contain altered volcanic glass.  

Biostratigraphic age assignments are overall consistent wit h each other and are mainly derived from diatom, radiolarian, an d calcareous nannofossil datums as well as planktonic foraminife r biozonations. None of the different biozonations record any majo r hiatuses, indicating that a continuous sediment sequence from th e early Pliocene through the Holocene was recovered at this site. Th e core catcher sample of the deepest core in Hole U1540E (Core 383- U1540E-10H) contained a few reworked taxa from the Miocene. However, the in situ microfossils present in this interval indicate  a maximum early Pliocene age at the base of Site U1540.  

Paleomagnetic measurements indicate a number of polarit y changes that are best illustrated by downhole changes in inclination. The boundaries that define each polarity reversal are overall reasonably distinct. Prior to demagnetization, inclinations in the uppermost $40\,\textrm{m}$ are dominantly positive, which is opposite to th e expected inclination during the normal polarity Brunhes Chron. After demagnetization, inclinations become steeply negative an d largely consistent with values expected for a geocentric axial dipol e for the site’s location. Positive inclinations associated with reverse d polarity of the Matuyama Chron were observed in Holes U1540A, U1540B, and U1540D. However, the Matuyama–Brunhes polarit y transition is not definitively captured within any core other tha n possibly at the base of Core 383-U1540B-5H. Three normal polarit y subchrons within the Matuyama Chron were observed. The uppe r polarity transition of the Jaramillo Subchron was observed at th e base of Core 383-U1540D-8H and somewhat more noisily in Cor e 383-U1540A-6H, and the lower Jaramillo polarity transition fro m the Matuyama Chron was observed in Cores 383-U1540B-10H an d 383-U1540D-10H. The upper polarity transition from the Olduva i Subchron (C2n) was observed in Core 383-U1540B-17H and somewhat more noisily in Core 383-U1540A-12H. The lower polarit y transition from the Matuyama Chron was observed in Core 383- U1540B-16H and possibly the upper part of Core 383-U1540A13H. The normal polarity Reunion Subchron is recognized in all cored holes with varying fidelity. Deeper than ${\sim}180\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ , polarity becomes more difficult to interpret as well-defined interval s of both polarities were observed on a decimeter scale.  

We analyzed samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bulk sediment chemistry at a resolution of three sample s per core from 0 to $120\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, two per core from 120 to $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and one per core from $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the bottom of th e hole (Cores 383-U1540A-1H through 16H, 383-U1540B-2H, an d 383-U1540D-15H through 21H). Methane concentrations are ver y low at this site overall, ranging from a maximum 6 ppm and a minimum of 2 ppm, with an average content of 4 ppm. Ethane and propane remained below detection limit throughout the entire hole.  

Shallower than ${\sim}134\mathrm{\m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ (Holes U1540A and U1540B), alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ show no obvious trends, varying around averages o f $3.4\pm0.5\mathrm{~mM}$ and $7.96\pm\:0.07$ , respectively. Below this depth, alkalinity and pH exhibit almost identical behavior, first increasing to  a local peak at ${\sim}157\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ and then decreasing steadily to the bottom of Hole U1540D.  

The composite carbonate record at Site U1540 shows downhol e variability ranging from 6 to $93.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ and a strong correlation wit h RGB blue and reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ (Figure F24) and GRA bulk densit y measurements. TOC content has a mean value of $0.36~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and  a standard deviation of 0.13 across the entire cored interval. TOC values ranges from a maximum of $0.75~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $20.63\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hol e U1540A, and a minimum of $0.13~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $204.4\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hol e U1540D.. The TOC record shows no correlation to the $C a C O_{3}$ record $\!\!\left/R^{2}=0.004\right\rangle$ downhole.  

Physical property measurements at Site U1540 include nondestructive whole-round measurements of GRA bulk density, MS, WRMSL $P$ -wave velocity, and NGR on core sections from Hole s U1540A–U1540E. Additional physical properties collected includ e thermal conductivity on whole-round core from all holes. Data acquired from whole-round measurements are generally in goo d agreement with those from split-core measurements and discret e samples. In particular, discrete moisture and density (MAD) an d GRA bulk densities correlate well, and GRA bulk density is also wel l correlated to discrete carbonate measurements from the differen t holes. Major bulk density peaks, which correspond to the lowest $P_{-}$ - wave velocities, correlate with high-carbonate nannofossil content, whereas smaller GRA bulk density, NGR, and MS peaks observe d simultaneously are partly linked to IRD content. Low GRA densitie s reflect the more biosiliceous facies and correspond to higher $P_{-}$ - wave velocity and high porosity. The older part of the record at th e site, from $185\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ to the bottom, shows a clear inverse correlation of MS and GRA bulk densities, indicating that the oldest sediments are mainly composed of only two components, carbonat e nannofossils and clay. NGR data also imply that total counts and th e derived potassium content can be used as a semiquantitative prox y for the abundance of terrigenous material delivered by dust or se a ice and iceberg transport. Downhole changes in physical propert y characteristics overall are thus in good agreement with the identified lithostratigraphic units based on sedimentologic characteristic s (Figure F25). Comparison of the different physical properties allow s the discrimination of intervals consisting of mainly two components from intervals consisting of three or more components an d could help provide a more quantitative determination of the sediment composition.  

Correlations between holes were accomplished using the Correlator software (version 3.0). Tie points were established mostly using the RGB blue channel extracted from the Section Half Imagin g Logger (SHIL) digital images, but in many cases a combination o f measurements was used. We constructed a splice from 0 to 222.9 5 m CCSF-A using four holes (U1540A, U1540B, U1540D, an d U1540E). However, because some misfired cores that were disturbed could not be used, the splice contains two gaps. The deepes t cores of Holes U1540D and U1540E, 383-U1540D-22H and 23 X and 383-U1540E-10H, were excluded from the spliced interval because of poor recovery and high levels of drilling disturbance.  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic age markers. These data suggest that th e sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1540 covers the past ${\sim}4.8$ My (Figure F26). Though substantially lower than at Site U1539, sedimentation rates at Site U1540 are remarkably high for a pelagi c setting. Below a condensed shallow section downhole to ${\sim}0.3\mathrm{~Ma}$ , sedimentation rates average $7.5~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ downhole to ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ an d decrease to ${\sim}1.5\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ during most of the Pliocene $(2.7{-}4.8\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . This age model is generally consistent with preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed on board based on physical property dat a such as color measurements (RGB blue) and GRA bulk density.  

The combination of nearly continuous recovery, very high sedimentation rates driven by high diatom productivity during glacial periods and potential sediment focusing, clear patterns in physical properties and sediment color, and a rich array of well-preserved diatoms combined with calcareous microfossils will provide unprecedented opportunities for improving our understanding of th e dynamics of the ACC and its link to global carbon cycle changes a t orbital and suborbital timescales.  

# Site U1541  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1541 (Proposed Site CSP-1A) is located in the centra l South Pacific at $54^{\circ}12.756^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $125^{\circ}25.540^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ${\sim}1830~\mathrm{nmi}$ west of th e Magellan Strait at $3604\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figure F27). The site sits a t the western flank of the southernmost EPR, ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{nmi}$ north of th e Tharp Fracture Zone and ${\sim}160\ \mathrm{nmi}$ west of the modern seafloo r spreading axis, and is underlain by oceanic crust formed at the EP R at $\mathord{\sim}6\mathrm{-}8$ Ma (Eagles, 2006). Assuming overall constant seafloor hal f spreading rates of ${\sim}4.5~\mathrm{cm}$ (Pitman and Heirtzler, 1966), the plat e tectonic backtrack path of Site U1541 moves the site eastward, placing it ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{nmi}$ closer to the crest of the EPR at a water depth shallower by several hundred meters in the early Pliocene. At a smalle r scale, the site is located in a ${\sim}4\ \mathrm{nmi}$ wide trough oriented NNE– SSW, parallel to the orientation of the EPR. The adjacent ridges ris e to ${\sim}3400\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth southeast of the site and to ${\sim}3500\;\mathrm{m}$ wate r depth to the northwest (Figure F27).  

Site U1541 is located on MCS Line AWI-201000014 at the intersection with Line AWI-2010000016 (Figure F28A) (Gersonde, 2011). The seismic cross-lines indicate ${\sim}180\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sediment s above oceanic basement. Sediments are mostly well stratified wit h flat lying, slightly irregular reflectors. Low to moderately reflectin g layers become stronger deeper than ${\sim}120{-}140\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Sedimen t echo sound (Parasound) profiles (Gersonde, 2011) indicate moderate penetration $\left(\sim\!80\textrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering (Figure F28B), suggesting a succession of fine-grained soft sediments with varyin g lithologic composition.  

Site U1541 lies in the pathway of the SAP ACC, ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{nmi}$ nort h of the modern mean position of the SAF. In this sector of the ACC, the associated fronts are strongly steered by the topography of seafloor spreading systems (Udintsev and Eltanin-Tharp Fracture Zon e systems).  

SSTs seasonally vary between ${\sim}3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (July–September) and ${\sim}7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (January–March). The area is located west of the main Antarctic Intermediate and Mode Water formation regions in the Southeast Pacific. The $3604\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth places Site U1541 within LCD W (Figure F14).  

The main objectives at Site U1541 were to • Recover a moderate-resolution Subantarctic Miocene–Quaternary sediment record close to the SAF;  

• Investigate the sequencing of calcareous and siliceous oozes, allowing for a wide range of paleoceanographic reconstructions;   
• Reconstruct high-amplitude Subantarctic SSTs based on multiple proxies;   
• Investigate long-term changes in dust input;   
• Provide a record of LCDW and potential influence of AABW during glacial periods;   
• Reconstruct productivity (opal versus carbonate), nutrient distribution, and dust-productivity coupling; and   
• Recover a potential far-field record of WAIS variability.  

# Operations  

During the transit to Site U1541, rough weather systems move d in, causing high seas at the site location. Therefore, upon reachin g the site coordinates at ${\sim}2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 June 2019, the vessel continued at reduced speed on a $245^{\circ}$ weather avoidance course for another ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{nmi}$ past the site. At $2105\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 June, the sea state ha d sufficiently calmed down to turn the ship around and head back.  

We completed the sea voyage and arrived at Site U1541 at 073 6 h on 17 June. We lowered the thrusters and the vessel was place d over the site coordinates and on dynamic positioning mode by 082 0 h. Soon after, the drill crew started to build the APC/XCB BHA an d to lower the drill string to the seafloor.  

By $1815\ \mathrm{h}$ on June 17 2019, the drill bit was lowered to 359 7 mbrf, $5\,\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor depth calculated by the onboard PDR. We attempted to spud Hole U1541A, but the first core came u p empty. Three more attempts followed with the bit at 3602, 3607, and 3617 mbrf before we successfully recovered any sediment. Finally, we spudded Hole U1541A at $2330~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 June. Core 383- U1541A-1H recovered $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, indicating a missed mudline, and we ended the hole at that point.  

The bit was raised to $3612.0~\mathrm{mbrf}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and Hole U1541B was spudded at $0055\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 18 June. Based on the recovery in Core 383- U1541B-1H, the seafloor was calculated at 3614.4 mbrf (or 3603. 7 mbsl). Coring continued without incident until a partial stroke wa s recorded on Core 15H. When the core was recovered, the temperature tool (APCT-3) cutting shoe showed damage, and the drille r pulled back the next APC core barrel before it arrived at the bottom. An XCB core barrel was dropped to attempt Core 16X. After drilling for $45\;\mathrm{min}$ and advancing only $0.5\;\mathrm{m},$ , the barrel was pulled bac k on board. Core 16X retrieved three large pebble-sized basalt piece s $_{2-5\,\mathrm{cm}}$ in diameter) in the core catcher. The bit was pulled out o f the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ and ending Hole U1541B.  

A total of 16 cores were taken in Hole U1541B. The APC syste m was used for 15 of these, reaching a depth of $138.0\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A befor e APC refusal and recovering $129.3\mathrm{~m~}$ $(94\%)$ . The XCB system wa s used for one core; it advanced $_{0.5\textrm{m}}$ and recovered $0.06\;\mathrm{m}$ of basal t $(12\%)$ . The APCT-3 was used on Cores 383-U1541B-4H, 7H, 11H, and 15H. Misfires were recorded on Cores 1H, 4H, and 6H, and  a partial stroke was registered on Core 383-U1541B-15H. Twentyfive hours were spent in Hole U1541B.  

The vessel was offset $20\textrm{m}$ east of Hole U1541B, the bit wa s raised to $3608.0\;\mathrm{mbrf},$ , and Hole U1541C was spudded at $0325\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 19 June. The hole was deepened with the APC system to $118.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Cores 383-U1541B-1H–13H) before coring was terminate d at $1805\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 June to allow the vessel to evade approaching heav y weather.  

The drill pipe was retrieved, and the rig floor was secured fo r transit at $0204\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June, ending Hole U1541C and Site U1541.  A total of 13 APC cores were taken over a $118.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with a recovery of $100.4\;\mathrm{m}$ $(85\%)$ .  

In summary, three holes were cored at Site U1541 using the fulllength APC coring system. Hole U1541A was cored to $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF- A $^{(9.67\mathrm{~m~})}$ recovered; $101.8\%)$ , Hole U1541B was cored to $138.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ( $129.27\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $93.3\%$ ), and Hole U1541C was cored t o $118.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A $\mathrm{?00.37\;m}$ recovered; $85\%$ ).  

# Principal results  

A ${\sim}145\mathrm{~m~}$ spliced sedimentary sequence of Holocene–Miocen e age was recovered at Site U1541 from Holes U1541A–U1541C (Figure F29). The sedimentary sequence includes four lithofacies, namely carbonate-bearing to carbonate-rich diatom ooze (Lithofacies 2), diatom-bearing to diatom-rich nannofossil/calcareous ooz e (Lithofacies 3), nearly pure nannofossil ooze (Lithofacies 4), an d clay-bearing to clayey biogenic ooze (Lithofacies 6) (Figure F30) . Based on the distribution and co-occurrence of the defined lithofacies, we divided the Site U1541 sedimentary sequence into thre e lithostratigraphic units. The youngest, Unit I, is divided into tw o subunits: IA downhole to ${\sim}25\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A $\left[{\sim}27\mathrm{~m~}\right]$ CCSF-A) and I B from ${\sim}25$ to ${\sim}63\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A $\sim\!66\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A). The subunit boundar y is determined by a transition from frequent and marked change s between Lithofacies 2, 3, and 4 to a dominance of Lithofacies 3. Uni t II spans from ${\sim}63$ to ${\sim}95\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ( $[{\sim}66\$ to ${\sim}98\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A) an d differs from Unit I above by an absence of diatom ooze (Lithofacie s 2), resulting in a dominance of different varieties of nannofossil ooze (i.e., Lithofacies 3 and 4). Subunit IIIA, from ${\sim}95\$ to ${\sim}119\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A ( $\left.\sim\!99\right.$ to ${\sim}127\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}\mathrm{)}$ ), can be distinguished from Unit I I above by a distinct color change in Lithofacies 3 and 4 from whit e and light greenish gray to very pale brown and pale orange yello w and an increased contribution from Lithofacies 3. Subunit III B spans from $\mathord{\sim}119$ to ${\sim}137\mathrm{~m}$ CSF-A ( $.{\sim}127\$ to ${\sim}145\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ ) an d shows a dominance of Lithofacies 4 in contrast to Subunit IIIA. Th e presence of basalt rock and volcanic glass fragments at the base o f Hole U1541B in Sections 15H-5 and 16X-CC suggests the complet e recovery of the pelagic sediment sequence above oceanic basemen t at this site.  

All microfossil groups studied on board (diatoms, radiolarians , silicoflagellates, benthic and planktonic foraminifers, nannofossils, and ostracods) are present at the site. The preservation of diatoms i s moderate overall. Radiolarians are generally very well preserved except for a few samples. Silicoflagellates are rare to barren throughout the core except for four samples in which they are common t o abundant. Calcareous nannofossils are present in all the samples. They are common to abundant except for a few samples and become dominant in specific nannofossil ooze intervals. Planktoni c and benthic foraminifers and ostracods show good to moderat e preservation in the upper part of Hole U1541B and moderate preservation in the lowermost core catcher samples. Ostracods are particularly abundant in Sample 9H-CC.  

The biostratigraphic age model at Site U1541 was mainly base d on analyses from Hole U1541B with additional samples analyzed fo r diatoms and nannofossils in Hole U1541C. Split-core samples wer e taken in both holes to refine the stratigraphy in the lower half of th e site. In total, 117 biostratigraphic events were recognized and indicate an estimated age of $\mathord{\sim}7.7$ Ma at the bottom of both holes. Th e integrated biostratigraphy of diatoms, radiolarians, calcareous nannofossils, and planktonic foraminifers showed no major hiatuses a t Site U1541, suggesting a continuous sequence of late Miocene t o Holocene sediments.  

Paleomagnetic measurements indicate a number of polarit y changes that are best illustrated by downhole changes in inclination. These capture a series of apparent polarity reversals that are consistent between Holes U1541B and U1541C where they overlap an d together provide a long and almost continuous record of polarit y change over the past 8 My (Figure F31). The Matuyama/Brunhe s and upper and lower Jaramillo polarity boundaries that define th e upper part of the Matuyama Chron (C1r.1r and.1n) were observed. Most reversal boundaries from the Olduvai Chron (C2n) to C4r.1 n $(8.254\;\mathrm{Ma})$ are generally well characterized. The record of inclination and intensity after $20\,\mathrm{\mT}$ peak AF demagnetization for th e splice composite record allows polarity interpretations and correlation to the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS; Cande and Kent, 1995). Only the boundaries associated with the reversed polarity intervals of the Gauss Chron (C2An) (Kaena and Mountain) and th e short normal polarity Subchron C3BR.2n that spans from 7.454 t o $7.485\:\mathrm{Ma}$ are not clearly recognized over the $8.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ interval.  

We analyzed samples for headspace gas, interstitial water chemistry, and bulk sediment chemistry at a resolution of three per cor e from 0 to $9.5\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hole U1541A and 0 to $138.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ i n Hole U1541B and two per core from 0 to $32.6\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Hol e U1541C. Methane concentrations are low at this site overall, neve r exceeding 3.47 ppmv. Ethane and propane remain below detectio n limit throughout the entire hole.  

Alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ decrease with depth starting around $^{80\textrm{m}}$ CSF-A. Interstitial water iron concentration deeper than $86\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA drops below detection limits, and interstitial water manganes e concentration drops below detection limits deeper than $105.05\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A.  

Calcium carbonate content is relatively high at this site; it neve r falls below $21.6~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and has a downhole average content of 68. 6 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Calcium carbonate content shows a good correlation with sediment color reflectance parameter $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ and RGB blue data (Figur e F32). TOC contributes a maximum of $0.8~\mathrm{wt\%}$ to the total carbo n pool throughout this site and shows no clear correlation with calcium carbonate content. TN is very low at this site, never exceedin g $0.06\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

The bulk sediment elemental composition shows marked increase in concentrations toward the bottom at $135.85\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, indicating interaction between basement rocks and the sediment. Oxide contents of magnesium, potassium, iron, silica, and titanium co-vary strongly with aluminum oxides, suggesting that thes e elements are present primarily in clay minerals. High coherency between the downhole calcium and strontium concentration pattern s suggests that strontium is incorporated in biogenic carbonate.  

Physical property data acquired from whole-round measurements are generally in good agreement with those from split-cor e measurements for MS loop and point measurements. GRA bul k density and $P$ -wave logger (PWL) velocity values indicate shorte r term variations in Lithostratigraphic Unit I and the top of Unit II, and the shortest term variations at the top of Unit II and in Subunit IB are probably linked to 40 ky cycles in the early Pleistocene. MS shows both high amplitude and large timescale variability al l along the record. GRA bulk density shows higher values in Unit I I and Subunit IIIB, corresponding to a higher fraction of carbonate/nannofossils compared to diatoms, whereas MS and NGR sho w higher values in Subunit IIIA likely linked to higher terrigenou s content.  

Downhole changes in physical property characteristics overal l are in good agreement with the defined lithofacies (Figure F33) bu t show different relationships with one another compared to Site s U1539 and U1540 in intervals of low diatom content.  

Correlations between holes at Site U1541 were accomplishe d using Correlator software (version 3.0). Tie points were establishe d mostly using the core image RGB blue channel, but in many cases  a combination of measurements was used. We constructed a splic e from 0 to $127.254\:\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A using three holes; however, because o f some disturbed cores or cores that were too short to be used, th e splice contains two gaps. Because Hole U1541B was drilled deepe r than either of the other holes, the last two cores in Hole U1541 B were appended to the bottom of the splice.  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic age markers. These data suggest that th e sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1541 covers the past ${\sim}8$ My (Figure F34). Though substantially lower than at Site U1539 an d U1540, sedimentation rates at Site U1541 average $2.7\;\mathrm{{cm}/\mathrm{{ky}}}$ downhole to $\sim\!3\mathrm{~Ma}$ and decrease to ${\sim}1.3\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during most of the Pliocene and late Miocene. This age model is generally consistent wit h preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed on board based o n physical property data such as color measurements (RGB blue) an d GRA bulk density.  

The combination of nearly continuous recovery, medium hig h sedimentation rates primarily driven by calcareous and diatom productivity during glacial periods, clear patterns in physical propertie s and sediment color, and a rich array of well-preserved calcareou s microfossils combined with diatoms will provide unprecedente d opportunities for improving our understanding of the dynamics o f the ACC and its link to global carbon cycle changes at orbital timescales back into the late Miocene. Site U1541 will therefore provide  a crucial Miocene-to-present perspective on the evolution of th e ACC system and its climate impact and will complement higher resolution paleoclimate reconstructions based on Sites U1539 an d U1540 that cover the period from the Pliocene to present.  

# Site U1542  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1542 (Proposed Site CHI-4B) is located at the Chile continental  margin  in  the  eastern  South  Pacific  at $52^{\circ}42.2917^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $75^{\circ}35.76915^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{nmi}$ west of the entrance of the Magellan Strai t at $1101\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F35). North of ${\sim}53^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , subduction i n the Chile Trench is more orthogonal and results in a steep slope incised by canyons that run perpendicular to the trench axis. Recen t sediment cover is minor at the lower slope, but a relatively smallscale sediment depocenter (“sediment drift”) has been identified a t the upper continental slope where Site U1542 is located.  

Site U1542 is located on MCS Line AWI-20160511 ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ north of the intersection with Line AWI-20160513 (Figure F36A ) (Lamy, 2016). The seismic cross-lines indicate sediments as thick a s ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ above continental basement. The basement age of the drif t is unknown; a maximum age of ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ can be derived from the en d of the tectonic erosion and start of subsidence at the continental margin (Polonia et al., 2007). Sediments are mostly well stratifie d with slightly irregular reflectors. Low to moderately reflecting layer s become stronger deeper than ${\sim}350\,\mathrm{~m~}$ sediment depth. Sedimen t echo sound (Parasound) profiles (Lamy, 2016) reveal moderate penetration $\left(\sim\!50\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering (Figure F36B), suggesting  a succession of fine- to medium-grained sediments with varying lithologic composition.  

Site U1542 is located underneath the southward-flowing CHC , a northern branch of the ACC that continues toward the Drake Passage and provides a major fraction of the present-day norther n Drake Passage transport (Well and Roether, 2003). Satellite-tracke d surface drifters reveal that after crossing the EPR, Subantarctic surface water of the ACC is transported northeastward across th e Southeast Pacific toward the Chile coast at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , $75^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ (Figures F2,  

F37). Here, presently only a minor part of ACC water is deflecte d northward into the HCS, whereas the major fraction is deviate d southward toward the Drake Passage. The CHC thus transports  a significant amount of northern ACC water toward the Drake Passage in a narrow ${\sim}100{-}150\,\mathrm{km}$ wide belt along the coast (Chaignea u and Pizarro, 2005) (Figures F2, F37). Modern surface current velocities in the CHC reach $>\!35\;\mathrm{cm/s}$ , and high flow speeds of ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm/s}$ extend to mid-depths (Boisvert, 1969; Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005).  

Site U1542 is located at the lower limit of AAIW and lies close t o or within the major modern AAIW formation area in the Southeas t Pacific (e.g., Bostock et al., 2013). CDW underlies AAIW in this region (Figure F38). The area off the Strait of Magellan is located ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ latitude north of the present SAF. Modern mean annual SST in thi s area is ${\sim}8^{\circ}C,$ and the seasonal range is ${\sim}3^{\circ}C$ .  

The main objectives at Site U1542 were to  

• Recover Pleistocene paleoceanographic records over the past several glacial–interglacial cycles with suborbital-scale resolution;   
• Reconstruct the strength of the CHC (Subantartic ACC) before entering the Drake Passage;   
• Investigate AAIW and CDW water mass properties;   
• Investigate changes of continental paleoclimate; and   
• Recover a potential near-field record of Patagonian ice sheet variability.  

# Operations  

Four holes were cored at Site U1542 using the full-length AP C coring system: Holes U1542A $\left(0{-}169.5\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ CSF-A; $181.74\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $107\%$ ), U1542B ( $_{0-1.4\mathrm{~m~}}$ CSF-A; $1.46\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $104\%$ ), U1542C $0{-}213.7\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A; $225\mathrm{~m~}$ cored and $236.9\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $105\%$ ), and U1542D $0{-}234\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A; $202.7\mathrm{~m~}$ cored and $205.4~\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $101\%$ ).  

# Transit to Site U1542  

At $0236\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 June 2019, the vessel got underway at full spee d northeast of Site U1541 to avoid heavy weather headed toward th e operational area. Taking advantage of the transit, we deployed th e towed magnetometer. The vessel continued transiting on a northeasterly course for $1109\ \mathrm{nmi}$ over 4.7 days until $1845~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 Jun e when sea conditions allowed us to turn around and start heading t o our operational area at the southwest Chile margin. During th e northward transit on 21 June, we passed just $120\;\mathrm{nmi}$ east of Poin t Nemo, the most remote location on our planet.  

At $1845\mathrm{~h~}$ on 24 June, we set a southeast course toward Proposed Site CHI-1C, located at the southernmost Chile margin clos e to the Pacific entrance of the Drake Passage. This provided the bes t ability to change course for Sites U1542 or U1543 if the weather improved over those sites first. We continued on this course until 123 0 h on 28 June, covering $873\;\mathrm{nmi}$ , when a strong system of high wind s and seas was predicted to begin moving across the transit path an d into the Chile margin operational area, forcing us to stop a t $48^{\circ}44.0?\mathrm{S}$ , $089^{\circ}24.7?\mathrm{W}_{\cdot}$ . The thrusters were lowered to wait for th e system to pass.  

At $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 July 2019, the seas and weather subsided enoug h over the operational area in the Chile margin to get underway again. The thrusters were raised, and the vessel was underway at $1330~\mathrm{h}$ toward Site U1544. At $1345~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 July, we decided to adjust th e course for Site U1542.  

# Hole U1542A  

We arrived at Site U1542 at $1948\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 July 2019. The thruster s were lowered, and the vessel switched into dynamic positionin g mode by $2030~\mathrm{h}$ . An APC/XCB BHA was made up and lowered t o the seafloor. Based on a PDR reading of 1111.4 mbrf, an APC shooting depth of 1108.4 mbrf was chosen, and Hole U1542A was spudded at $0215~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 July. Core 383-U1542A-1H retrieved $7.1\textrm{m}$ o f sediment, determining the seafloor depth at 1110.8 mbrf (or 1099. 8 mbsl).  

APC coring continued until $165.6~\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (Cores 383- U1542A-1H through 19H) when the core barrel became detache d from the sinker bars during retrieval. The core barrel fell ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ back to the landing seat. Three attempts were needed to finally retrieve the barrel. Once at the surface, we found that only $1.05~\mathrm{m}$ o f core was recovered, and we decided to switch to the HLAPC syste m to deepen the hole. The HLAPC system was used for one core, recording a partial stroke and recovering $3.91\textrm{m}$ before the hole wa s abandoned because of high seas and winds. The bit was pulled t o 1033 mbrf, clearing the seafloor at $2359\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 July and ending Hol e U1542A. A total of 20 APC and HLAPC cores were taken over  a $169.5\:\mathrm{m}$ interval, recovering $181.74\;\mathrm{m}\;(107.2\%)$ .  

Nonmagnetic core barrels and the core orientation tool wer e used on all cores. Formation temperature was measured on Core s 383-U1542A-4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, and 16H. Partial strokes were recorded on Cores 10H–13H and 16H–21F. The total time spent i n Hole U1542A was $27.5\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.1 days).  

# Hole U1542B  

The vessel waited on the seas and winds to calm from $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ t o $1545\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 July 2019 with the bit set at 1033 mbrf. Then, the vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1542A, the bit was lowered to 1104. 0 mbrf, and Hole U1542B was spudded at $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 July. Core 383- U1542B-1H recovered only $1.46~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, and because of th e low recovery and quality of the core we decided to obtain a bette r mudline core, so Hole U1542B was abandoned.  

Hole U1542C  

The vessel stayed at the same coordinates, and the bit was lowered to $1105.0\;\mathrm{mbrf}.$ . Hole U1542C was spudded at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 Jul y 2019. Based on the recovery from Core 383-U1542C-1H $\left(3.3\,\mathrm{~m}\right)$ , the seafloor was calculated at 1111.2 mbrf ( $1100.2\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ ). APC coring continued to $169.3\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A with Core 20H. While running i n with the core barrel for Core 21H, the Captain terminated operations because of high currents and winds. When the core barrel wa s retrieved, it was found that the pins had sheared and $3.57\;\mathrm{m}$ of cor e had been retrieved for an advance of $3.0\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

At $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 July, the bit was pulled to $71.8\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and th e top drive set back to wait on weather with the bit in the hole. Th e crew continued to wait on weather until the seas subsided at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ . The top drive was picked up, the hole was washed to the bottom b y $1815\,\mathrm{h}$ , and coring continued with Cores 383-U1542C-22H–28H t o $226.0\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{CSF-A}$ at midnight on 6 July.  

A total of 26 cores were taken over a $217.0\ \mathrm{m}$ interval with tw o $4.5~\mathrm{m}$ drilled intervals ${\mathfrak{g}}{\mathfrak{m}}$ total drilled). A total of $228.91\;\mathrm{m}$ wa s recovered $106\%$ recovery). Nonmagnetic core barrels were use d with all cores, and the core orientation tool was removed after Cor e 383-U1542C-20H. A misfire was recorded on Core 8H, and partial strokes were recorded on Cores 10H, 12H, 13H, 16H, 17H, an d 20H–28H.  

# Hole U1542D  

The vessel was offset $_{20\textrm{m}}$ south of Hole U1542C, and the bi t was spaced out to 1107 mbrf. Hole U1542D was spudded at $0600\mathrm{h}$ on 7 July 2019. Based on recovery from Core 383-U1542D-1H, seafloor was calculated at $1111.7\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A (1100.7 mbrf). The hol e then was cored to a total depth of $213.7\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A using the fulllength APC system, and three intervals were drilled without recovery over a total of $11.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ to help eliminate gaps in core coverag e between holes. After reaching total depth, the bit was recovered t o the surface, clearing the seafloor at $0245~\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table a t $0545~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 July. The BHA was racked back in the derrick, and th e rig floor was secured for transit at $0555\,\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel was switche d from dynamic positioning to cruise mode at $0558\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hol e U1542D and Site U1542.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used on all cores, but no orientation or temperature measurements were taken. Partial stroke s were recorded on Cores 383-U1542D-10H and $12\mathrm{H}{-}27\mathrm{H}$ . A total o f 24 cores were taken over a $202.7\:\mathrm{m}$ interval with $205.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of recover y $(101.2\%)$ . Three drilled intervals were used following Core 12H, $22\mathrm{H}$ , and 24H. The hole was advanced by recovery on all partia l strokes.  

# Principal results  

A ${\sim}249\,\mathrm{~m~}$ spliced sedimentary sequence of Holocene–middl e Pleistocene age was recovered at Site U1542 from Holes U1542A– U1542D (Figure F39). It comprises five lithofacies, of which one wa s identified at previous Expedition 383 sites in the central South Pacific (nannofossil ooze; Lithofacies 4). New lithofacies includ e clayey silt to silty clay (Lithofacies 8), carbonate- and/or sand-bearing clayey to sandy silt (Lithofacies 9), foraminifers, sand- and/o r clay-bearing  silty  nannofossil  ooze  (Lithofacies  10),  and  san d (Lithofacies 11). Site U1542 is characterized by exceptionally hig h sedimentation rates that exceed $30~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . The entire recovere d sedimentary sequence $(\sim\!249\,\mathrm{m})$ can be described as one lithostratigraphic unit (I) that covers the middle Pleistocene to Holocene interval. Sediments at Site U1542 are of siliciclastic nature. Th e sedimentary sequence at this site is dominated by dark gray to dar k greenish gray clayey silts or silty clays, whereas thin beds of ligh t greenish gray to light gray nannofossil ooze occur infrequently (Figure F40). Deeper than $50\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ , up to $3\;\mathrm{m}$ thick intervals of interbedded clayey silt and sand appear recurrently. In addition, thin, light gray, foraminifer-bearing calcareous ooze, clay-bearing silt y nannofossil ooze, and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze was observed deeper than $95\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ .  

Diatoms and radiolarians are rare throughout the sediment succession, silicoflagellates are absent, nannofossils are few to barren, benthic and planktonic foraminifers are abundant, and ostracod s are sparsely present in some intervals at the site. The biostratigraphic age model for Site U1542 was mainly based on biostratigraphic analyses of core catcher and split-core samples from Hol e U1542A $(0{-}169\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ ) and the bottom of Hole U1542C (172.3– $234.0~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). In total, eight biostratigraphic events were recognized that indicate an estimated age of ${\sim}0.7$ Ma at the bottom o f Hole U1542C.  

The NRM of the archive-half sections of Site U1542 was measured and remeasured after alternating field (AF) demagnetizatio n at $2\ \mathrm{cm}$ increments. In general, the number of demagnetizatio n steps reflect  

• The desire for more steps to study the magnetization(s), • The severity of the drill string and natural overprints that hopefully can be removed to recover the natural remanence,  

• The desire to use low peak fields to preserve the magnetization for future shore-based studies, and • The need to maintain core flow through the laboratory.  

After demagnetization, the intensity correlates with neither M S nor intensity prior to demagnetization, suggesting that the larg e drill string overprint was successfully removed and a geomagneti c signal was recovered. Inclinations are steep and positive prior to demagnetization and steep and negative after, suggesting, as with th e intensity data, that a vertical $\left(+z\right)$ drill string magnetic overprint wa s removed, giving way to a primary remanence that varies around expected directions $(-69^{\circ})$ for the site latitude during normal polarity. The NRM after $15\;\mathrm{mT}$ shows no evidence for reversed polarity, suggesting that Site U1542 sediments are younger than 0.781 M a (Hilgen et al., 2012). Shore-based studies will verify these interpretations and further develop these sediments as geomagnetic recorders,  providing  information  on  field  intensity  and  directional variability while facilitating the next iteration in magnetic stratigraphy.  

The interstitial water chemistry at this site is influenced by anaerobic organic matter remineralization. As oxygen is depleted wit h depth by respiration, nitrate, manganese, and iron serve as terminal electron acceptors in organic matter remineralization. Sulfate reduction  occurs  when  other  electron  acceptors  become  consumed/unavailable,  and once sulfate  is  completely consumed, methanogenesis becomes the primary remineralization pathway. A t this site, sulfate reduction predominates in the shallow sedimen t and the sulfate–methane transition zone likely occurs at $\mathrm{\sim}9\,\mathrm{m}$ CSFA. This is not unusual for continental margin sediments and i s probably due to the fact that Site U1542 lies in a high productivit y zone supported by abundant supply of nutrients from continental runoff.  

Calcium carbonate content is very low in this site with the exception of two peaks of 39.2 and $80.0~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at 97.22 and $125.57\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, respectively. The carbonate record shows no correlatio n with reflectance $L^{\ast}$ and RGB blue data. Organic carbon contribute s a maximum of $0.67\mathrm{~wt}\%$ to the total carbon pool throughout thi s site. TN is very low, never exceeding $0.05\;\mathrm{wt}\%_{\mathrm{g}}$ , and low concentrations yield poor reproducibility of samples because of the detectio n limit of the instrument.  

TOC/TN ranges between 0.82 and 18.56, suggesting a predominance of marine-derived organic matter. However, the very hig h TOC/TN values are likely artifacts due to the extremely low value s and poor reproducibility of TN measurements.  

Physical property data acquired from whole-round measurements for Site U1542 are generally in good agreement with thos e from split-core measurements; however, at this site considerabl e offsets in many individual section depths exist through all holes du e to ongoing expansion of sediment between whole-round loggin g and splitting the cores. These differences will have to be correcte d with further onshore measures such as high-resolution X-ray fluorescence scanning and manual inspection of MS parameters befor e sampling. The applied manual processing to all Site U1542 hole s based on the whole-round WRMSL/Special Track Multisensor Logger (STMSL) log sheets provided sufficiently “clean” data for GR A bulk density, MS, and NGR data but yielded data loss of about $8\%-$ $15\%$ depending on the hole and data category. $P$ -wave velocity measurements largely failed for Site U1542 because of core expansio n and related cracking of the sediment.  

At this site, the downhole changes in physical property characteristics are only partly in agreement with the defined lithofacie s (Figure F41) based on sedimentologic characteristics. The principally higher MS and GRA bulk density values match the hemipelagic composition and higher lithogenic input to the sedimentar y matrix, but they show different relationships with one another compared to previous Sites U1539 and U1540 in intervals of low diato m content.  

The higher complexity of this hemipelagic site in terms of sediment delivery mechanisms is reflected in the acquired physica l properties of Site U1542. The predominantly terrigenous sedimen t supply likely is composed of multiple processes such as ice and glacial meltwater transport as well as dust and current-induced latera l material transport and sorting after deposition, all influenced b y various forcing such as climate and glacier mass balance changes, associated sea level changes, and dynamic changes in mid-dept h ocean circulation that affects the transport direction and strengt h on both orbital and short (sub-)millennial timescales.  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic age markers. These data suggest that the sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1542 covers the past ${\sim}0.7$ My (Figur e F42) with sedimentation rates averaging $37\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ . This age mode l is generally consistent with preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed on board based on physical property data such as colo r measurements (RGB blue) and GRA bulk density.  

The combination of nearly continuous recovery, very high sedimentation rates in a sediment drift primarily driven by siliciclasti c sediment input during glacials, and, though diluted, a rich array o f calcareous microfossils combined with diatoms will provide unprecedented opportunities for improving our understanding of th e dynamics of the northern ACC before entering the Drake Passage, variations of the CHC, intermediate water mass circulation, and Patagonian ice sheet variability.  

# Site U1543  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1543 (Proposed Site ESP-1B) is located in the easter n South Pacific at $54^{\circ}35.06^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $76^{\circ}40.59^{\prime}\mathrm{W}\,{\sim}110\mathrm{\;nmi}$ west of the Chil e coast and ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{nmi}$ south-southwest of Site U1542 at ${\sim}3860\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figure F43). The site is situated west of the Chile Trenc h on a topographically elevated ridge ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ above the trench axi s ${\sim}4200\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth) (Figure F44A). The basement at this location is oceanic crust older than ${\sim}20\,M\mathbf{a}$ (Eagles, 2006).  

Site U1543 lies at the intersection of two seismic lines with  a sediment thickness of $600{-}700\,\mathrm{m}$ . MCS Line AWI-20160501 lies ${\sim}1$ nmi southwest of the intersection with Line AWI-20160503 (Figur e F44A) (Lamy, 2016). Sediments are mostly well stratified with onl y slightly irregular reflectors. Sediment cover is drape-type and entirely covers the underlying basement morphology (Figure F44A). Sediment echo sound (Parasound) profiles (Lamy, 2016) revea l moderate penetration $\left({\sim}70\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering (Figure F44B), suggesting a succession of fine-grained sediments with varying lithologic composition.  

Site U1543 is located at the offshore reach of the southwardflowing CHC, a northern branch of the ACC that continues towar d the Drake Passage and provides a major fraction of the present-da y northern Drake Passage transport (Well and Roether, 2003). Satellite-tracked surface drifters reveal that after crossing the EPR, Subantarctic surface water of the ACC is transported northeastwar d across the Southeast Pacific toward the Chile coast at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{.}}$ , $75^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ (Figures F2, F37). Here, presently only a minor part of ACC water i s deflected northward into the HCS, and the major fraction is deviated southward toward the Drake Passage. The CHC thus transports a significant amount of northern ACC water toward the Drak e  

Passage in a narrow ${\sim}100{-}150\ \ \mathrm{km}$ wide belt along the coas t (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005) (Figures F2, F37). Modern surfac e current velocities in the CHC reach $>\!35\ \mathrm{cm/s}$ at the continental margin (Site U1542) but decrease offshore toward Site U1543 (Boisvert, 1969; Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005).  

Site U1543 is presently located at the lower limit of LCDW an d might have been affected by AABW in the past (Figure F38). Th e site is located ${\sim}4^{\circ}$ latitude north of the present SAF. Modern mea n annual SST in this area is ${\sim}8.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and the seasonal range is ${\sim}3^{\circ}C$ .  

The main objectives at Site U1543 were to  

• Recover a Plio/Pleistocene undisturbed, continuous sediment record with medium high sedimentation rates;   
• Reconstruct the strength of the CHC (Subantarctic ACC) before entering the Drake Passage;   
• Investigate AABW, CDW, and Pacific Deep Water (PDW) water mass properties;   
• Investigate changes of continental paleoclimate; and   
• Recover a potential near-field record of Patagonian ice sheet variability over the past several million years.  

# Operations  

The R/V JOIDES Resolution completed the $119\,\mathrm{nmi}$ transit fro m Site U1542 to Site U1543 at $1717~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 July 2019, in $10.5~\mathrm{h}$ an d averaging 11.3 knots. A water depth reading using the Precisio n Depth Recorder set the preliminary seafloor depth at $3877.4\;\mathrm{m}$ below rig floor (mbrf) for Hole U1543A. The operations plan for Sit e U1543 initially included three holes to a depth of $400\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. This was modified due to time lost to weather during the expedition, shallowing the penetration depth to $250\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A for eac h hole. While coring Hole U1543A, it was decided to continue deepening the hole until APC refusal, and to only core two holes to AP C refusal at this site.  

Hole U1543A  

Hole U1543A was spudded at $0325\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 July 2019, with Cor e 1H recovering $7.1\textrm{m}$ . Core recovery determined a seafloor depth o f 3863.4 mbsl. Soon after, at $0415\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , coring operations were suspended when one of the ship’s main propulsion shafts was shu t down due to mechanical problems. The engineers found the problem to be with a faulty shaft brake unit. The brake was taken out o f service and the shaft was repaired and brought back online by 090 0 h. At that point coring resumed and continued without interruptio n through 11 July in good weather and sea conditions. Coring was terminated after 90,000 lb of overpull were needed to retrieve Cor e 383-U1543A-36H from $339.6~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The drill string was pulle d out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 July. Overall, 3 6 cores were taken with $103\%$ recovery.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used on all cores. The core orientation tool was used in most cores except for 383-U1543A-8H, 14H, 16H, 17H, 24H–29H, and 32H–36H. Formation temperatur e measurements were taken with the APCT-3 on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, 16H, and 19H. Partial strokes were recorded on Cores 32H– 36H. The total time spent in Hole U1543A was $73.2\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.05 days).  

Hole U1543B  

The vessel was offset $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ east of Hole U1543A, and Hol e U1543B was spudded at $2010\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 July 2019. The seafloor dept h was calculated at 2876.4 mbrf (3865.3 mbsl) based on the recover y from Core 383-U1543B-1H. Hole U1543B was cored entirely wit h the APC system, and two drilled intervals were used to cover corin g gaps between Holes U1543A and U1543B. The first drilled interval $\left(1.9\mathrm{~m}\right)$ followed Core 1H, and the second drilled interval $\left(1.5\mathrm{~m}\right)$ ) followed Core 23H. Core 33H reached a total depth of $286.5\,\mathrm{m}$ CSFA. Overall, 31 cores were taken over a $283.1\textrm{m}$ interval with $104\%$ recovery.  

The bit was retrieved to the surface, clearing the seafloor at 180 0 h on 13 July and the rotary table at $0045~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 July. The rig floo r was secured for transit at $0110\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and JOIDES Resolution bega n transiting to Site U1544.  

A total of 31 cores were taken over a $283.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval. A total o f $294.97\,\mathrm{~m~}$ was recovered $104.2\%$ recovery). Two intervals wer e drilled without recovery for a total of $3.4\;\mathrm{m}$ . Nonmagnetic core barrels were used with all cores, and the core orientation tool was no t used. Partial strokes were recorded on Cores 383-U1543B-31H– 33H. The liners of Cores 3H, 14H, 20H, 21H, 25H, and 31H–33 H shattered on the catwalk after holes were drilled to release formation gas.  

# Principal results  

Site U1543 consists of a $376.3~\mathrm{m}$ spliced sedimentary sequenc e (Figure F45, F46). The sedimentary record comprises five lithofacies (Figure F46) identified at previous Expedition 383 sites. Thes e include major biogenic lithologies (nannofossil ooze [Lithofacies 4]; clay-bearing to clayey diatom ooze [Lithofacies 6]); and diatom-, clay-, and/or silt-bearing to rich nannofossil or calcareous ooz e [Lithofacies 10] and mainly siliciclastic sediments (diatom-bearin g to rich clay [Lithofacies 7] and silt-bearing clay to clay-bearing sil t [Lithofacies 8]). The biogenic lithofacies were first characterized i n the central South Pacific, whereas the pure siliciclastic sedimentar y lithofacies were observed at the northern Chile margin Site U1542. Their definition is expanded according to the varieties of lithofacie s observed at this site. The sedimentary sequence at Site U1543 i s characterized by moderate average sedimentation rates of ${\sim}5$ $\mathrm{{cm/ky.}}$ . Site U1543 comprises two lithostratigraphic units, I (0–11 5 m CCSF-A) and II ( $115{-}376.3\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A), that cover the earl y Pleistocene to Holocene and late Miocene to early Pleistocene intervals, respectively. Unit I largely consists of greenish gray to dar k greenish gray silt-bearing clay (Lithofacies 8) that contains prominent $10{-}30~\mathrm{cm}$ thick beds of light gray to light greenish gray carbonate-, clay-, and/or diatom-rich nannofossil ooze. Deeper tha n $115\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF-A, the abundance of diatomaceous sediments increases, mostly in the form of diatom-bearing silty clay (Lithofacie s 7) and carbonate and silt-bearing diatom ooze (Lithofacies 6). Th e latter often occurs in association with decimeter-scale beds of nannofossil ooze. Diatom mats and dropstones are rare, and burrow s and mottling due to diagenetic overprints are frequent. Lithification, secondary carbonate precipitation, and microfracturing increasingly occur deeper than $275\mathrm{~m~CCSF-A}$ .  

A ${\sim}339.54\mathrm{\;m}$ thick sediment succession of late Miocene age wa s recovered at Site U1543. Diatoms and radiolarians are abundan t throughout the sediment succession, silicoflagellates are absent t o few but locally abundant, nannofossil abundance varies strongl y with good preservation, benthic and planktonic foraminifers are absent in glacials and moderately preserved when present, and ostracods are rarely present at the site and restricted to Miocen e samples. Biostratigraphic analyses of Hole U1543A core catcher an d split-core samples allowed the recognition of 56 biostratigraphi c events and indicate an estimated age of 7.3–8.5 Ma at the bottom o f the hole.  

The NRM of the archive-half sections of Site U1543 was measured and remeasured after AF demagnetization at $2\ \mathrm{cm}$ increments. In general, the number of demagnetization steps reflects  

• The desire for more steps to study the magnetization(s), • The severity of the drill string and natural overprints that hopefully can be removed to recover the natural remanence, • The desire to use low peak fields to preserve the magnetization for future shore-based studies, and • The need to maintain core flow through the laboratory.  

The intensities before and after demagnetization for the uppe r $140\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of cores recovered from Hole U1543A are generally quit e strong, varying around the $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ range. A few discret e intervals have values as low as $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ and are generally associate d with MS lows. Deeper than $140\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, intensities are slightl y lower on average, falling to $\mathrm{\s10^{-2}\,A/m}$ . Deeper than $240\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , intensities are more variable and values in the $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}\,\,\mathrm{A/m}$ range are much more common. Compared with previous sites, there is little difference in intensity before and after demagnetization at a peak AF of $15\;\mathrm{mT},$ , suggesting a finer magnetic mineralog y with a higher coercivity that is less susceptible to the drill strin g overprint.  

The inclination for Holes U1543A and U1543B before and afte r AF demagnetization at $15~\mathrm{mT}$ captures a series of apparent polarit y reversals, either directly observed or inferred from polarity change s between cores, and when observed within a section the reversals ar e generally well defined and many times reproduced. Their position s in Hole U1543A are illustrated in Figure F47. All polarity boundaries from the Matuyama/Brunhes at 0.781 Ma through C3Br.2r a t $7.285\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , 31 polarity reversals in total, are either directly observe d or closely constrained and correlated to the GPTS (Cande and Kent, 1995; Hilgen et al., 2012). Reversed and normal polarity associate d with the base of Chron C3B and the upper part of Chron C4 (olde r than $7.432\ M\mathrm{a})$ were observed, but the boundaries are not constrained in the deepest cores in Hole U1543A. Shore-based studie s will refine correlations to the GPTS and facilitate development o f relative paleointensity as the next steps in magnetic stratigraphy a t Site U1543.  

Biologically mediated anaerobic oxidation of organic matter i s evidenced in the interstitial water by the presence of reduced iro n and manganese, high alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H},$ and high ammonium concentrations. Farther downcore, interstitial water chemistry may b e additionally impacted by oxidative processes either deep in the cor e or below the cored depth with upward diffusion. This is demonstrated by decreases in ammonium and increases in sulfate wit h depth. The deeper parts of the core show evidence of carbonate dissolution as well as the interplay of dissolution and precipitation o f iron- and manganese-bearing minerals.  

Calcium carbonate content at this site is low but highly variable , and several peaks fluctuate between a minimum of $0.1~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and  a maximum of $86.8~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . A linear correlation between calcium carbonate contents and RGB blue and reflectance $L^{\ast}$ data was observe d at this site for samples above $1\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F48). Organic carbo n contributes a maximum of $0.43\,\mathrm{\Delta~wt\%}$ to the total carbon pool throughout this site.  

TN is very low at this site, never exceeding $0.05~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . TOC/T N ranges between 0.34 and 19.91, suggesting a predominance of marine-derived organic matter. However, TOC/TN values closely mirror the TOC record, and TN values are likely too low to effectivel y apply TOC/TN values to sediments at Site U1543 (see discussio n for Site U1542).  

Data acquired from whole-round measurements for Site U154 3 are generally in good agreement with those from split-core measurements. For Site U1543, MS, bulk density, and NGR are positively correlated with higher values that correspond to highe r terrestrial component in the sediment (Lithofacies 7 and 8) an d lower values that correspond to increased biogenic component s (Lithofacies 4, 6, and 10). Although some minima in those physica l properties corresponds to changing lithofacies, the physical properties also record subtle changes between terrestrial and biogeni c components at high temporal frequency and for long term, allowin g a precise reconstruction of warm and cold intervals and a precis e correlation with isotopic stratigraphy. Furthermore, GRA bulk density and $P$ -wave velocity show different behaviors for increased nannofossil and diatom presence in Lithofacies 8. Both values decreas e for increasing nannofossil content, and GRA bulk density decreases. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocities, however, increase with increasing diatom content. It is thus possible, by combining the different highresolution physical property records, GRA bulk density, magneti c susceptibility loop, and PWL, to interpret the large to smaller variations of the records as variations of either diatom or nannofossi l content in terrigenous Lithofacies 8 (Figure F49).  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic age markers. These data suggest that th e sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1543 covers the past ${\sim}8.4$ My (Figure F50). Sedimentation rates are overall relatively constan t and average ${\sim}4.5\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . This age model is generally consistent wit h preliminary stratigraphic tuning performed on board based o n physical property data such as color measurements (RGB blue) an d GRA bulk density.  

Overall, the undisturbed continuous sediment record with medium to high sedimentation rates extending into the Miocene recovered at Site U1543 is exceptional. The record is an importan t eastern end-member locality to the central South Pacific sites recovered during Expedition 383 that can be used to evaluate pas t oceanographic and climate changes from the late Miocene to th e present. The observed variations in lithology and physical properties are at least in part driven by glacial–interglacial climate chang e that consistently impacts the delivery and nature of sediment deposited at Site U1543. The longer term evolution of these depositional  processes  recorded  at  Site  U1543  will  illuminate  th e multimillion-year history of Patagonian ice sheet growth and retreat, ACC transport, and the underlying climatic conditions i n which these processes evolved.  

# Site U1544  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1544 (Proposed Site CHI-1C) is located at the Chile continental  margin  in  the  eastern  South  Pacific  at $55^{\circ}32.2192^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $71^{\circ}35.6194^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ${\sim}30~\mathrm{\nmi}$ southwest off the Chile coast and a t ${\sim}2090\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F51).  

Tectonically, the southern Chile margin is characterized by  a complex geodynamic setting with oblique convergence betwee n plates, transcurrent motion, and tectonic rotation on land (Poloni a et al., 2007). The geodynamic setting of the southernmost Chil e margin is driven by relative movements between three main plates: Antarctica, Scotia, and South America. This complex setting result s in strong segmentation of the southern Chile margin as clearly visible in bathymetric data and multichannel seismic data (Polonia e t al., 2007) (Figure F4). There are two major fore-arc basins at ${\sim}53^{\circ}-$ $54.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ and $55^{\circ}{-}56.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ that are characterized by a thick sediment infill of up to ${\sim}3\ \mathrm{km}$ . Site U1544 is situated close to the axis of th e southern fore-arc basin on the continental crust of the Scotia plate. This southern basin most likely formed after the ridge consumptio n $(10{-}14\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . When accretion resumed, it contributed to an oute r high that provided the barrier for the accumulation of continent-derived sediments. The upper unit in the southern basement, relevan t for drilling, shows onlap terminations on both basin flanks.  

Site U1544 lies on multichannel seismic (MCS) Line IT95-181 , ${\sim}3\mathrm{\nmi}$ southeast of the intersection with Profile IT95-171 (Figur e F52) (Lamy, 2016). Sediments are mostly well stratified and sediment cover at the site exceeds $2.5\;\mathrm{km}$ . Sediment echo sound (Parasound) profiles (Lamy, 2016) reveal poor to moderate penetratio n $\left(\sim\!30\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ with distinct layering and an irregular surface, suggesting  a succession of fine- to medium-grained sediments with occasional coarser grained composition.  

Site U1544 is located underneath the southward-flowing CHC , a northern branch of the ACC that continues toward the Drake Passage and provides a major fraction of the present-day norther n Drake Passage transport (Well and Roether, 2003). Satellite-tracke d surface drifters reveal that after crossing the East Pacific Rise Subantarctic surface water of the ACC is transported northeastwar d across the Southeast Pacific toward the Chile coast at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , $75^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ (Figures F2, F37). Here, presently only a minor part of ACC water i s deflected northward into the HCS, whereas the major fraction is deviated southward toward the Drake Passage. The CHC thus transports a significant amount of northern ACC water toward the Drak e Passage within a narrow belt of ${\sim}100{-}150\,\mathrm{km}$ width along the coas t (Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005) (Figures F2, F37). Modern surfac e current velocities in the CHC reach $>\!35\;\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s}$ , and high flow speed s of ${\sim}20~\mathrm{cm/s}$ extend to mid-depths (Boisvert, 1969; Chaigneau an d Pizarro, 2005).  

Site U1544 is presently located at the lower limit of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water (LCDW) and might have been affected b y AABW in the past (Figure F38). The site is located ${\sim}4^{\circ}$ north of th e present SAF. Modern mean annual SST in this area is ${\sim}8.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , an d the seasonal range is $6^{\circ}{-}9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

The main objectives at Site U1544 were to  

• Recover Pleistocene paleoceanographic records over the past several glacial–interglacial cycles with suborbital-scale resolution,   
• Reconstruct the strength of the CHC (Subantarctic ACC) before entering the Drake Passage,   
• Investigate CDW and PDW water mass properties,   
• Investigate changes of continental paleoclimate, and   
• Recover a potential near-field record of Patagonian ice sheet variability.  

# Operations  

We arrived at Site U1544 at $1746~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 July 2019. Soon afte r arrival, the rig floor crew assembled the advanced piston corer/extended core barrel (APC/XCB) bottom-hole assembly (BHA) an d deployed the drill string to the seafloor, reaching $2055\mathrm{~m~}$ below ri g floor (mbrf) by midnight.  

The initial attempt to spud Hole U1544A was made at $_{0015}\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 15 July and resulted in a bent/broken APC core barrel, which mad e it necessary to pull the bit back to the rig floor and remove the stuc k portion of the barrel. The vessel was then moved $50\;\mathrm{m}$ southwest a t $225^{\circ}$ to attempt starting Hole U1544A again. Due to a hard layer below the sediment surface, we used the XCB system to spud the hol e and break through the hard layer.  

Hole U1544A finally was spudded at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 July with th e first core advancing $7.8~\mathrm{m}$ into a softer formation. When the XC B core barrel was retrieved, we found a ${\sim}5~\mathrm{cm}$ granite pebble in th e core catcher. We then deployed the APC system and cored to AP C refusal at $88.1\textrm{m}$ below seafloor (m CSF-A). The half-length AP C (HLAPC) system was used to deepen the hole to the final depth o f $106.0\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ before coring was terminated due to high seas an d winds. The drill string was pulled out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $0958\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 July and ending Hole U1544A.  

The vessel was offset $_{20\textrm{m}}$ to the east of Hole U1544A with th e bit at 2055 mbrf to wait for the seas to subside, so an attempt coul d be made to spud Hole U1544B. However, heave was still above $3.5\,\mathrm{m}$ at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 July and operations were terminated. The drill pip e was pulled to the surface and the vessel was secured for transit b y $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 July, ending Site U1544. A total of 19 cores were take n over a $103.0\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $89\%$ recovery.  

# Principal results  

Site U1544 consists of a $91.3~\mathrm{m}$ sedimentary sequence obtaine d from a single hole (Figure F53). The sedimentary record comprise s four lithofacies (Figure F54), all of which were identified at previou s Expedition 383 sites. They include fine-grained (biosilica-bearin g silty clay [Lithofacies 7] and silty clay [Lithofacies 8]), coarsegrained (sand [Lithofacies 11]) siliciclastic sediments, and biogeni c sediments (diatom-, clay-, and/or silt-bearing to -rich nannofossil o r calcareous ooze [Lithofacies 10]). The sedimentary sequence i n Hole U1544A is dominated by siliciclastic sediments (i.e., Lithofacies 7, 8, and 11), with only sporadic layers of calcareous ooze. Sedimentation is characterized by highly variable sedimentation rates o f $\geq25\,\mathrm{\cm/ky},$ with rapidly deposited gravity-driven sedimentatio n (e.g., turbidities) contributing a significant fraction of the sedimentary sequence. Hole U1544A sediments make up only lithostratigraphic unit in this hole, Unit I (7.7–106.1 m CSF-A), which cover s the late Pleistocene interval. Unit I largely consists of greenish gra y to dark greenish gray silty clay (Lithofacies 8) or biosilica-bearin g silty clay (Lithofacies 7) that frequently alternates with prominen t decimeter- to meter-scale dark gray sand layers that often have normal grading and erosional boundaries to underlying strata. Prominent $<\!1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick beds of light gray to light greenish gray silt-bearin g and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze occur in two intervals at $^{26-}$ 28 and $80.5–82.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Dropstones are rare, whereas mottlin g due to diagenetic overprints is minor but frequent. The upper core, 383-U1544A-2X, retrieved a single hard rock pebble that suggests  a rocky and hard substrate close to the seafloor at this site.  

Diatoms are rare to abundant throughout the sediment succession, radiolarians and silicoflagellates are absent, nannofossils ar e abundant to barren, benthic and planktonic foraminifers are abundant above ${\sim}85\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and ostracods are sparsely presen t throughout the sequence, but abundant at ${\sim}60$ and ${\sim}101\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The biostratigraphy of Site U1544 is not well constrained because o f the lack of marker species for most fossil groups. Based on the biostratigraphic events recorded, the estimated age is $_{<0.42}$ Ma at th e bottom of Hole U1544A.  

The NRM of the archive-half core sections was measured befor e and after AF demagnetization at $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ increments. The intensitie s before and after demagnetization for the upper $140~\mathrm{m}$ of cores recovered from Hole U1544A are generally quite strong, varyin g around the $10^{-1}$ to $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ range. A few discrete intervals have values as low as $10^{-4}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ and are generally associated with magneti c susceptibility (MS) lows. Below $140\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, intensities are slightl y lower on average, falling in the $10^{-2}\ \mathrm{A/m}$ and below range. Belo w $240~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, intensities are more variable, with values in the $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ range being much more common. Compared with previous sites, there is little difference in intensity before and after demagnetization at a peak field of $15\;\mathrm{mT}_{:}$ , suggesting a finer magneti c mineralogy with a higher coercivity that is less susceptible to th e drill string overprint. Although a very noisy record, no evidence fo r reversed polarity is observed, suggesting that Site U1544 sediment s are younger than $0.781\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Hilgen et al., 2012).  

We constructed a preliminary age model based on biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic age markers. These data suggest that th e sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1544 covers less than ${\sim}0.4$ Ma. Sedimentation rates are high and average ${\sim}25\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ .  

The low sampling resolution makes it difficult to interpret interstitial water profiles from this site. Low sulfate and high methan e concentrations suggest that the sulfate–methane transition zon e occurs shallower than ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ (Iverson et al., 1985). The hig h alkalinity indicates that organic matter degradation is dominated b y anaerobic processes, and concentrations of interstitial water iro n suggest that microbial iron reduction also occurs at this site. Because of limited time, only two samples were analyzed for TN an d carbon, and observed TN values are among the highest of all Expedition 383 sites.  

At this site, the downhole changes in physical property characteristics do not show obvious features aligned with the define d lithofacies based on sedimentologic characteristics (Figure F55) . Principally, lower MS and low GRA bulk density values match th e interval of higher biogenic component, but they do not show  a unique relationship with one another throughout the record. Comparing NGR and MS records could provide indications about th e different terrigenous components because they are mainly anticorrelated like at the shallow-water Site U1542.  

The close proximity of Site U1544 to the southernmost Chil e margin explains the dominance of terrigenous sediments at this site. Terrigenous sediment is likely delivered to the site by a combinatio n of ice rafting, suspension fallout from glacial meltwater plume s and/or freshwater plumes that originate from nonglaciated catchments, episodic downslope transport from the outer continental shelf, and fine-grained sediments transported by the CHC enterin g the Drake Passage as the northern branch of the ACC. The larg e proportion of normally graded sand beds with erosive basal contacts implies that turbidity currents were a transport mechanism t o carry sediments from the continental slope and the upper slop e during the Middle and Upper Pleistocene. We conservatively estimate the contribution of turbidities as ${\sim}40\%$ based on the thicknes s of sand layers (lithofacies 11). However, it is possible that a certai n fraction of the hemipelagic sediments also represents a continuation of the normal graded turbidite deposition sequence; if so, the n turbidites may account for a larger proportion of the sequence an d sedimentation at Site U1544 was rather discontinuous. Future geochemical and sedimentary analyses will provide crucial insights int o the nature and temporal evolution of sedimentation processes a t Site U1544.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

# Overall assessment  

The overall goal of Expedition 383 was to improve our knowledge of Plio/Pleistocene atmosphere-ocean dynamics of the ACC i n the Pacific and their implications for regional and global climate an d atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ based on sediment records with highest possibl e resolution.  

Expedition 383 was very successful. We accomplished drillin g and coring at six of the planned seven sites in the South Pacific. Th e drilling and coring objectives were largely achieved, and a total o f $2636\mathrm{~m~}$ of core was recovered from six sites over a $2649\mathrm{~m~}$ core d interval. This is the first time sedimentary records of this lengt h and, in particular, of this resolution have been recovered from th e South Pacific. We achieved our overall goal of recovering sedimentary sequences to improve our knowledge of Plio/Pleistocene atmosphere-ocean dynamics. Based on extrapolating sedimentatio n rates from the site survey cores and planned length of the drille d sequences, we expected to reach back to the early Pliocene $\left(\sim\!5\,\mathrm{{Ma}}\right)$ . At two of our sites (U1541 and U1543), we were able to drill continuous sequences that reach back to about $^{8\mathrm{~Ma~}}$ , well into the Miocene, thus exceeding our expectations and allowing an even mor e complete investigation of the long-term evolution of the climat e system in the South Pacific. The key achievements of the drillin g operations include the following:  

• All sequences cored are continuous and do not display any hiatuses.   
• Site U1539 and to a lesser extent Site U1540 have very high sedimentation rates for a pelagic setting, thus allowing for the first time analyses of climate variability at millennial and submillennial timescales in the Southern Ocean. The sites are complemented by a lower resolution site, U1541, with a remarkably constant sedimentation rate of $2.7\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{ky}$ downhole to $\sim\!3\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and then ${\sim}1.3\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during most of the Pliocene and late Miocene. It provides a continuous paleoclimate record back to the Miocene that is expected to serve as a reference site for the region.   
• Sites U1541 and U1543 provide the longest continuous paleoceanographic records obtained in the Southern Ocean.   
• Even though the cross-frontal transect in the central South Pacific could not be cored, Site U1539, closest to the modern SAF, and Site U1540, ${\sim}170\;\mathrm{nmi}$ north of the front, provide pronounced lithologic differences, suggesting strong gradients between both sites, particularly during glacials.   
• The two long-timescale cores from the central South Pacific (Site U1541) and the eastern South Pacific (Site U1543) provide an excellent zonal transect across the eastern part of the South Pacific over the past 8 My.  

Despite the drilling success at the six sites, the overall expeditio n experienced two challenges that affected the drilling strategy and, t o some extent, the scientific objectives:  

• Approval: By the time we left Punta Arenas on May 24, we had not obtained approval from the Chilean authorities to conduct drilling and coring operations in their territorial waters. This forced us to change the original operations plan by reordering the sequence of our sites to allow the Chilean authorities more time for approval for the initial sites planned in Chilean waters. We received notice about clearance on 31 May 2019, 1 week into the expedition when we were already well underway to the drill sites in the central South Pacific. The delay in obtaining the permits severely limited our flexibility in planning operations. • Weather-related interruptions and adjustments: During the entire expedition, we faced rough weather and sea conditions that impacted our drilling operation and required us to adjust our drilling plans on a continuous basis. Weather-related challenges were anticipated because Expedition 383 was targeting areas of the South Pacific Ocean that are within the range of maximum wind speeds of the Southern Westerly Winds. Expedition 383 was scheduled during austral autumn/winter when historical weather records show winds speeds in the Pacific Southern Ocean to be substantially reduced. However, we encountered  

rough weather and seas resulting in the loss of substantial operational time above the long-term climatological mean. Broadly, the weather-related issues were two different types:   
• Weather and sea conditions on site that stopped coring operations and partly prohibited the coring of three full holes per site as originally planned. At most of the sites, we had to interrupt drilling operations because of high seas and resulting high heave. In these cases, we stayed on site, waited until the seas calmed sufficiently, and continued drilling. Such conditions lead to $106\,\mathrm{h}$ of lost time.   
• While drilling at Site U1541 in the central South Pacific, a largescale $(>\!2000\,\mathrm{km})$ storm system developed in the Southeast Pacific and forced us to transit on a northeast course across the South Pacific on a bad-weather avoidance course. This not only caused a significant loss of time (12.3 days) but also made it impossible to reach one of our targeted sites, Proposed Site CSP3A, at $60^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ close to the PF. As a result of the bad-weather avoidance, we had to eliminate Site CSP-3A from our planed drilling schedule.  

Despite encountering weather-related challenges, we were successful in mitigating the impacts on the scientific drilling progra m through good time management, intense attention to weather forecasting, and excellent communication with the captain and the operations superintendent.  

# Assessment related to the scientific hypotheses  

Expedition 383 was built around two major scientific hypotheses. Here, we break down the objectives of the expedition in th e context of these two hypotheses and document the achievement s and potential for each hypothesis.  

Hypothesis H1: ACC dynamics and Drake Passage throughflow conditioned the global Meridional Overturning Circulation and highlow climate linkages on orbital and submillennial timescales since the Pliocene.  

The Drake Passage is the major geographic constriction for th e ACC and forms an important pathway for the return of upper waters to the Atlantic through the cold-water route of the MOC (Gordon, 1986). Resolving changes in the flow of circumpolar wate r masses through the Drake Passage is crucial for advancing our understanding of the Southern Ocean’s role in affecting ocean and climate  change  on  a  global  scale.  Before  Expedition  383, reconstructions of the throughflow along the Chile margin wer e limited to the past $60\;\mathrm{ky},$ and no further information was available. We were highly successful in drilling Site U1542, which will exten d this type of record back to the middle Pleistocene. Site U1542 i s complemented by a long and detailed record from Site U1543 in th e ESP that reaches back to the Miocene. The weather conditions a t Site U1543 were extremely favorable for the region and allowed u s to drill two holes deeper than $300\;\mathrm{m}$ without any interruption and  a minimum of heave-related drilling disturbance. The record recovered at this site has excellent paleomagnetics and a pronounce d variability in MS that provides a promising tuning target. At th e third site in the region, U1544, the borehole depth had to be shortened to about $100\,\mathrm{m}$ because of rough weather and time constraint s at the end of the expedition. Accordingly, the record at this site i s much shorter and limited to the last few glacial cycles but will prov e helpful to evaluate Hypothesis H1 with regard to the last interglacial period, MIS 5, and potentially MIS 7. However, two fully occupie d sites (U1542 and U1543) provide continuous and very well dated sequences that include relatively highly resolved interglacials and glacial–interglacial transitions. The two sites together will allow us t o address the long-term, orbital-scale, and millennial-scale evolutio n and variability in ACC strength and Drake Passage throughflow, particularly in warmer-than-present interglacials (e.g., MIS 5e, 11, and 31) and across the Pliocene warm period at Site U1543. We anticipate that the recovered material will allow us to fully tackle Hypothesis H1 and associated research questions, even exceeding th e timescale to the late Miocene.  

Hypothesis H2: Variations in the Pacific ACC determine the physical and biological characteristics of the oceanic carbon pump and atmospheric $C O_{2}$  

Atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere  interactions  and  teleconnections between high and low latitudes play an important role in understanding processes and feedbacks of past and future climat e change, and the Subantarctic Southern Ocean provides the majo r link between Antarctica and the low latitudes. In the Souther n Ocean, these interactions are believed to control sea ice cover, AI S dynamics, upper ocean stratification, biological nutrient utilization, and exposure rates of deep water. They have been considered to pla y a key role in explaining the variability in atmospheric $C O_{2}$ concentrations.  

We drilled three excellent sites in the Subantarctic South Pacific, U1539, U1540, and U1541, that matched or even exceeded our expectations for these records in resolution (Site U1539) and covere d time period (Site U1541). These drill cores from the Pacific sector o f the Southern Ocean will allow us to explore in more detail the glacial–interglacial changes and longer term climate evolution Nort h of the Antarctic PF. Our drill sites from the central South Pacifi c (U1539, U1540, and U1541) will provide robust data to test to wha t extent processes that are active in the Atlantic sector can be translated to the Pacific sector, thus allowing the construction of a mor e global picture of the Southern Ocean’s role in nutrient distributio n and biogenic export production and their impact on $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ variations . The cores will enable us to generate key records of SST, dust, expor t production, and other parameters back to the Miocene. These reconstructions will provide important benchmarks for a climate-sensitive region that are important constraints to more realisticall y model the impact on the ocean carbon cycle under different climat e boundary conditions.  

Unfortunately, we were not able to reach the site in the Pola r Frontal Zone (Proposed Site CSP-3A) because of persistent roug h weather in the region, and therefore we were not able to complet e the cross-frontal transect. The elimination of this key site from Expedition 383 has impacts on some aspects of testing Hypotheses H 2 and related research questions that target processes in the Antarcti c zone south of the PF as well as comparisons between the Subantarctic and Antarctic zone.  

At two of the sites (U1540 and U1541) east and west of the EPR, we drilled to the basement of the overlying sediment sequence. Th e lowermost sediments at both sites provide evidence of hydrothermal alteration that may add an unforeseen aspect to the future research at the Expedition 383 sites.  

The potential range of scientific applications for the unique se t of cores drilled during Expedition 383 is very large, encompassin g paleoclimate reconstructions, carbon cycle, evaluation of hydrothermal inputs, geochemistry, reconstruction of ice sheet variability,  land-ocean  interaction,  and  sedimentary  processes.  W e anticipate exciting and important results from both the postexpedition research and research endeavors beyond the science party fo r many years to come.  

# Outreach summary  

Expedition 383 shipboard participants included an outreach officer from the United States. She communicated the goals of the expedition to students and the general public across the globe throug h live broadcasts and social media. She also developed a virtual fiel d trip education outreach activity targeted toward high school an d undergraduate students.  

# Live Zoom broadcasts  

Using the direct satellite link, an iPad, and the Zoom videoconferencing software, the education outreach officer was able to hel p the expedition scientist connect with people all over the world.  A typical session included an introduction to the current location an d expedition goals followed by a tour of the laboratories, tracing th e core path as it comes on board. Scientists were stationed at eac h laboratory to give an overview of the science being conducted an d to answer questions. We finished each tour with a $10{-}15\ \mathrm{min}$ question and answer session. During Expedition 383, we completed 2 3 broadcasts and connected with 10 different countries, including  5 different states in the United States. We also worked with the National Science Foundation to hold a Facebook Live event tha t reached over 2700 views.  

# Social media  

During the expedition, the education outreach officer manage d the JOIDES Resolution Expedition 383 website (https://joidesresolution.org/expedition/383/) and completed a total of 35 Caree r Spotlight blogs that highlighted the careers of the expedition cre w members. She assisted scientist Anieke Brombacher, who posted i n both English and Dutch, with access to the website. Together the y posted a total of 48 blogs. The expedition website also has a link t o the Columbia University Earth Institute State of the Planet blog series where Co-Chief Gisela Winkler and scientists Julia Gottschal k and  Jenny  Middleton  posted  articles  about  Expedition  38 3 (https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/features/ocean-of-extremes/).  

The education outreach officer also added at least one post every day to the JOIDES Resolution Facebook, Twitter, and Instagra m social media accounts. This resulted in an increase of 89 new Instagram followers, 173 new Twitter followers, and 415 new Faceboo k page likes over the 2 month expedition. That is a total increase o f 677 newly engaged individuals.

Figure F5. Central and eastern South Pacific paleoceanography and Drake Passage throughflow (modified from Lamy et al., 2015). The pronounced glacia l cooling in the eastern Subantarctic is consistent with a northward extension of Antarctic cold-water influence. Reduced Cape Horn Current (CHC) and mor e sluggish glacial northern Drake Passage transport decreases the export of Pacific ACC water into the South Atlantic (cold-water route). Reduced Souther n Westerly Winds (SWW) core and extended sea ice diminish the wind forcing on the ACC and thus the Drake Passage transport. Stronger winds in the norther n SWW enhance the South Pacific Gyre and the export of northern ACC water into the HCS.

The geographic locations and water depths of the sites allow us t o (1) compare the dynamics of the ACC laterally between the central South Pacific in the vicinity of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) (bathymetric constraints) and th e eastern South Pacific before entering the Drake Passage and (2) investigate the vertical structure of the ACC. The sites sample the major water masses of th e ACC in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean from AAIW (Site U1542), across the CDW/PDW (Sites U1539 and U1541), and potentially down to AAB W (U1543), at least for glacial times (Ferrari et al., 2014).

Figure F9. Schematic representation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) overturning circulation in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean (modifie d from Ronge et al., 2016). Glacial pattern (left): northernmost extent of sea ice and Southern Westerly Winds (SWW). Increased Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW ) salinity by brine rejection and reduced Southern Ocean upwelling favors stratification. Increased dust input promotes primary production and drawdown o f ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ . Modern and deglacial pattern (right): upwelling induced by southward shift of Antarctic sea ice and SWW. The erosion of the deep-water carbon poo l releases $^{14}\!C.$ -depleted $\mathsf{C O}_{2}$ toward the atmosphere. Following air–sea gas exchange, the outgassing signal is incorporated into newly formed Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW; light blue shading). Blue shading: poorly ventilated old and $C O_{2}$ -rich waters. Darkest shading 2500–3600 m: water level influenced b y hydrothermal ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ . Green arrows $=$ intermediate water, orange arrows $=$ deep water, light blue areas $=$ sea ice, circular arrows $=$ diffusional and diapycna l mixing.

Figure F10. Left: contrasting paleoproductivity pattern in the Antarctic Zone (AZ; ODP Leg 177 Site 1094) versus the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ; ODP Leg 177 Sit e 1090) over the past 1 My (from Jaccard et al., 2013). Red and blue shading highlights intervals where AZ and SAZ processes, respectively, are dominantl y controlling the partitioning of ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ between the ocean interior and the atmosphere. During glacial inceptions, the first half of the $p C0_{2}$ reduction is essentiall y accomplished by decreasing vertical mixing and upwelling in the AZ (red shading). The second portion of the $p C0_{2}$ reduction (blue shading), initiated aroun d 225 ppmv, is achieved by enhancing carbon sequestration resulting from increased iron fertilization in the SAZ, thereby leading the climate system to reac h full glacial conditions. Right: records of Subantarctic dust-borne iron flux, phytoplankton productivity, surface nitrate consumption, and atmospheric $C O_{2}$ ove r the last glacial cycle (from Martínez-García et al., 2014). The gray-shaded vertical bars highlight maxima in dust flux that correspond to minima in atmospheri c ${\mathsf{C O}}_{2}$ .
