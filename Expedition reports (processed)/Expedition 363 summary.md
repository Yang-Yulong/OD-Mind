# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 363 sough t to document the regional expression and driving mechanisms of climate variability (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and productivity ) in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) as it relates to the evolutio n of Neogene climate on millennial, orbital, and geological timescales. To achieve our objectives, we selected sites with a wide geographical distribution and variable oceanographic and depositional settings. Nine sites were cored during Expedition 363, recovering  a total of $6956\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment in $875{-}3421\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth with an average recovery of $101.3\%$ during 39.6 days of on-site operations. Two moderate sedimentation rate $({\sim}3{-}10\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ sites are locate d off northwestern Australia at the southwestern maximum extent o f the IPWP and span the late Miocene to present. Seven of the nin e sites are situated at the heart of the Western Pacific Warm Poo l (WPWP), including two sites on the northern margin of Papua Ne w Guinea with very high sedimentation rates $(>\!60\mathrm{\cm/ky})$ spannin g the past ${\sim}450\,\mathrm{ky},$ , two sites in the Manus Basin (north of Papua Ne w Guinea) with moderate sedimentation rates $({\sim}4{-}14\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ recovering upper Pliocene to present sequences, and three sites with lo w sedimentation rates $({\sim}1{-}3\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ on the southern and norther n  

Eauripik Rise spanning the early Miocene to present. The wide spatial distribution of the cores, variable accumulation rates, exceptional biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic age constraints, an d mostly excellent or very good foraminifer preservation will allow u s to trace the evolution of the IPWP through the Neogene at differen t temporal resolutions, meeting the primary objectives of Expeditio n 363. Specifically, the high–sedimentation rate cores off Papua Ne w Guinea will allow us to better constrain mechanisms influencin g millennial-scale variability in the WPWP, their links to high-latitud e climate variability, and implications for temperature and precipitation in this region under variable mean-state climate conditions. Furthermore, the high accumulation rates offer the opportunity t o study climate variability during previous warm periods at a resolution similar to that of existing studies of the Holocene. With excellent  recovery,  Expedition  363  sites  are  suitable  for  detaile d paleoceanographic reconstructions at orbital and suborbital resolution from the middle Miocene to Pleistocene and thus will be use d to refine the astronomical tuning, biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and isotope stratigraphy of hitherto poorly constrained intervals within the Neogene timescale (e.g., the late Miocene) and t o reconstruct the history of the Asian-Australian monsoon and th e Indonesian Throughflow on orbital and tectonic timescales. Result s from high-resolution interstitial water sampling at selected sites will be used to reconstruct density profiles of the western equatorial Pacific deep water during the Last Glacial Maximum. Additional geochemical analyses of interstitial water samples in this tectonically active region will be used to investigate volcanogenic mineral and carbonate weathering and their possible implications for the evolution of Neogene climate.  

# Introduction  

The Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP), often defined by the $28^{\circ}C$ isotherm, is the warmest part of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP), which spans the western waters of the equatorial Pacific and eastern Indian Ocean (Figure F1). The region is a major source of heat and moisture to the atmosphere and a location of deep atmospheric convection and heavy rainfall. Small perturbations in the sea-surface temperature (SST) of the WPWP influence the location and strength of convection in the rising limbs of the Hadley and Walker cells, affecting planetary-scale atmospheric circulation, atmospheric heating, and tropical hydrology (Neale and Slingo, 2003; Wang and Mehta, 2008). These perturbations may also influence heat uptake and storage in the WPWP thermocline, as well as transport to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). These processes also constitute important feedbacks in the climate system due to their influence on the dynamic ocean-atmosphere coupling in the equatorial Pacific, thereby exerting a strong influence on global temperatures and atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ (Oppo and Rosenthal, 2010). Detailed paleoceanographic records, such as those recovered during Expedition 363, offer the opportunity to study the behavior of the WPWP under different mean-state background conditions and its effects on both regional and global climate.  

Seasonal to interannual climate variations in the WPWP are dominated by fluctuations in precipitation associated with the seasonal march of the monsoons, migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and interannual changes associated with variability of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (e.g., Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; Halpert and Ropelewski, 1992; Rasmusson and Arkin, 1993) (Figure F2). At present, departures from expected weather patterns associated with the monsoon and ENSO systems impact the lives of many people in the tropics and many regions around the world. For example, El Niño events are associated with a nearly global fingerprint of temperature and precipitation anomalies (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; Rasmusson and Arkin, 1993; Cane and Clement, 1999). However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the response of the tropical Pacific climate, primarily precipitation, to rising greenhouse gas concentrations because of our limited understanding of the past variability of the WPWP and conflicting results from data compared to models. For example, models simulating the response of the equatorial Pacific Ocean to greenhouse gas forcing disagree about whether the zonal temperature gradient will increase or decrease and what the implications will be for the Walker circulation and the hydrologic cycle in the tropics (Forster et al., 2007). These simulations typically use an ENSO analogy to predict future climate; in a similar way to interannual ENSO variability, long-term changes in the mean climate state of the equatorial Pacific are often evaluated primarily as changes in the east–west SST gradient. However, other simulations of global warming effects suggest that the tropical Pacific does not become more El Niño- or La Niña-like in response to increased greenhouse gases (DiNezio et al., 2009). Instead, these simulations suggest a different equilibrium state, whereby shoaling and increased tilt of the equatorial Pacific thermocline is associated with weakening of the trade winds without a concomitant change in the zonal SST pattern, which argues against using ENSO as an analog for long-term changes in tropical conditions (DiNezio et al., 2010). In turn, changes in the structure of the thermocline can have a major effect on the ocean heat content, and thus global climate, and also on the character of ENSO variability, which has been documented for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Ford et al., 2015). Changes in thermocline temperature/structure have also been suggested as a possible mechanism responsible for the slowdown in surface warming from $\mathord{\sim}2000$ to 2014 (e.g., England et al., 2014).  

A primary goal of this expedition was to assess the regional expression of climate variability (e.g., precipitation, temperature, $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ and biological productivity) within the WPWP in the context of changes in global background climate state from the middle Miocene to late Pleistocene. Drill sites were chosen to provide broa d spatial coverage to capture the most salient features of the WPW P (Figures F1, F3) at different temporal resolutions through this tim e interval (Figure F4). Situated in variable water depths, sediments a t these sites intersect different water masses, including the North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), Antarctic Intermediate Wate r (AAIW), Upper Circumpolar Deepwater (UCDW), and Lower Circumpolar Deepwater (LCDW) (Figure F5) and thus will allow reconstruction of intermediate and deep-water properties at relativel y high resolution through time.

# Oceanographic settings  

As the warmest ocean water on the planet, the IPWP and in particular the WPWP east of Indonesia, where mean annual SSTs ar e typically ${\tt>}29^{\circ}{\cal C}$ (Figure F1), are known to influence the dynamics o f ENSO and the Asian-Australian monsoon. Throughout the IPWP, warm water fuels atmospheric convection and heavy rainfall, resulting in a net freshwater flux into the ocean of $\mathrm{4-18~mm/day}$ (Figur e F2). The biggest seasonal changes in surface hydrography are expressed in salinity, with freshening caused by changes in precipitation due to the seasonal march of the ITCZ and the Asian  

Australian monsoon. On interannual timescales, ENSO exerts th e strongest influence on regional precipitation and, consequently, surface salinity. The spatial extent of the warm pool changes seasonally as the core of the WPWP follows the ITCZ migration. As a result, the size of the WPWP is smaller (larger) and SST is coole r north (south) of the Equator during boreal winter (summer).  

The western equatorial Pacific is also a crossroad for thermocline and intermediate waters that originate in the extratropics o f both hemispheres (Fine et al., 1994). Due to a complex network o f passages and basins, the Indonesian maritime continent on th e western edge of the WPWP exerts the strongest control on th e

From there, part of the ITF flows southward. joining the Leeuwin Current and bringing heat and moisture to Western Australia. However, most of the ITF enters the westward flowing South Equatorial Current (SEC) across the Indian Ocean, where it joins the southward-flowing Agulhas Current. With major contribution from ITF water, some of the Agulhas Current flows around the Cape of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean as part of the globa l thermohaline circulation. At present, the ITF receives water from the North Pacific Ocean and to a lesser extent from the South Pacific Ocean through the Ne w Guinea Coastal Current (NGCC), although the relative contributions of these end-members vary seasonally and interannually. On longer timescales, the contribution likely depends on changes in climate conditions and tectonic adjustments of the Indonesian Gateway (e.g., Cane and Molnar, 2001).

Comparing records from Expedition 363 drill sites at the heart of the WPWP and southwestern edge of th e IPWP (marked by yellow circles) will allow us to assess changes in the ITF on different temporal scales.

communication between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. As part o f the global circulation, the ITF is the only equatorial interocean connection transferring heat and freshwater from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, thus modifying the heat and salt budget of the India n Ocean. These changes affect the Atlantic Ocean via the Agulha s Current and thus ultimately may have far-reaching effects on ocea n meridional circulation and climate (Figure F6). The ITF is driven b y the average difference in sea level between the Pacific and India n Oceans $(\sim\!16\,\mathrm{cm})$ . Most of the ITF transport occurs in the upper 75 0 m of the water column, with the maximum volume transport occurring between 150 and $400\mathrm{~m~}$ (Fieux et al., 1994; Ffield et al., 2000; Gordon et al., 2003; Susanto and Gordon, 2005). On average, th e ITF transports a large amount of water (10–15 Sv, where $1\,\,{\cal S}\mathbf{v}\,=$ $1,000,000\;\mathrm{m}^{3}/\mathrm{s})$ ) and heat ${\sim}0.5\;\mathrm{PW},$ , where $1\ \mathrm{PW}=10^{15}$ W) from th e WPWP north of the Equator to $12^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ in the Indian Ocean. Approximately $80\%$ of the total ITF moves through the Makassar Strait (Figure F3) (Gordon, 2005). Of this, $25\%$ flows directly south throug h the Lombok Strait and $75\%$ takes a more circuitous route flowin g eastward into the Banda Sea and then westward into the India n Ocean via the Timor Sea (Fieux et al., 1994; Gordon and Fine, 1996; Gordon and Susanto, 1999) (Figures F1, F3). In the subsurface o f the WPWP, the upper thermocline represents a mixture of Nort h Pacific and South Pacific subtropical waters (NPSTW and SPSTW, respectively). At present, the NPSTW is the largest source to th e ITF with a smaller contribution of denser SPSTW through the Ne w Guinea Coastal Current (NGCC), which is the branch of the westward, cross-equatorial flowing Pacific South Equatorial Curren t (SEC), and constitutes the main southern Pacific contribution to th e ITF thermocline (Gordon and Fine, 1996; Hautala et al., 1996; Johnson and McPhaden, 1999). The lower thermocline and deeper $(>\!500$ m) receives contributions from the low-salinity, low-oxygen NPI W (salinity 34.45; density $26.5\mathrm{-}26.8~\sigma_{\mathrm{6}}^{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ ) advected through the Mindanao Current and the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU), which transport oxygen-rich AAIW (salinity ${\sim}34.55$ ; density $27.2-$ $27.3~\,\upsigma_{\uptheta})$ ). The deepest sites $>\!3000\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{~m~}}\ensuremath{\mathrm{~m~}}$ below sea level [mbsl]) ar e bathed by LCDW. The relative contributions of these water masse s at each of our drilling sites vary depending on their location and ag e at time of deposition.  

# Motivation for drilling the IPWP  

Studies of climate variability in the IPWP have relied primaril y on the low–sedimentation rate $({\sim}2{-}3\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the Pleistocene) Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Hole 806B from the Onton g Java Plateau (Kroenke, Berger, Janecek, et al., 1991), which serves a s a warm end-member to monitor broad-scale zonal and meridional gradients through the Neogene. However, higher resolution site s were unavailable from this region, preventing direct compariso n with suborbital variability recorded at high-latitude sites. Over th e past decade, new coring efforts have demonstrated the possibility o f obtaining records from key locations in the WPWP with comparable resolution to records from high-latitude oceans, cave deposits, and ice cores (e.g., Stott et al., 2002; Zuraida et al., 2009). Althoug h substantial progress has been made in understanding IPWP climat e variability by studying long piston cores, the newly cored Expedition 363 sites address fundamental questions across a broader spatial distribution and with enhanced temporal resolution. Expeditio n 363 cored sites of variable accumulation rates from the followin g three sectors of the IPWP:  

1. The southwestern sector of the IPWP (yellow box in Figure F3): cores at Sites U1482 and U1483, located seaward of the continental slope of northwest Australia at the southwestern edge of the IPWP and along the exit of the ITF to the Indian Ocean, recovered upper Miocene to recent sediment.  

2. The central sector of the WPWP (red box in Figure F3): high– accumulation rate Sites U1484 and U1485 on the northern margin of Papua New Guinea close to the Sepik/Ramu River mouths and Sites U1486 and U1487 in the Manus Basin span the late Pliocene to recent.   
3. The northern sector of the WPWP (green box in Figure F3): Sites U1488 and U1489 at the southern end of the Eauripik Rise and Site U1490 at its northern end recovered low–sedimentation rate sequences spanning the late Oligocene/early Miocene to recent.  

These sites will allow us to address the research themes discusse d below.  

# Investigating millennial-scale climate variability in the IPWP  

The origin of millennial-scale climate variability and its spatia l and temporal extent are significantly less well understood tha n mechanisms responsible for orbital climate variability. Most hypotheses attribute millennial-scale changes during the last glacia l interval to either instabilities in the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet s (e.g., MacAyeal, 1993) or a response to variations in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g., Rahmstorf, 2002) driven b y meltwater inputs to the North Atlantic (e.g., Clark et al., 2001, 2004). Much of the evidence for millennial-scale climate variabilit y comes from the North Atlantic Ocean and from regions directly affected by climate variability in that region. These records suggest  a strong link between millennial-scale variability and ice sheet instability, primarily during glacial periods (McManus et al., 1999). I n low-latitude and tropical regions, millennial-scale variability i s mainly expressed as changes in precipitation. Paleoprecipitation records suggest a southward shift in the ITCZ position apparentl y synchronous with North Atlantic cold events including the Younge r Dryas, Heinrich Event 1, and marine isotope Stage (MIS) 3 stadial s (Stott et al., 2002, 2004; Oppo et al., 2003; Dannenmann et al., 2003; Gibbons et al., 2014). These results are consistent with models tha t suggest climate conditions at high latitudes influence the position o f the ITCZ (Broccoli et al., 2006; Chiang and Bitz, 2005). The globa l extent and apparent synchroneity of millennial-scale variabilit y have been attributed to fast transmission of climate signals throug h the atmosphere in response to North Atlantic climate chang e (Schmittner et al., 2003; Gibbons et al., 2014). However, other studies suggest that changes in orbital insolation can induce changes i n the mean state of tropical climate that in turn affect tropical dynamics (e.g., monsoon and ENSO variability) operating on millennial o r shorter timescales (Clement et al., 2001; Koutavas et al., 2002, 2006; Stott et al., 2002). Accordingly, changes in the distribution of th e tropical Pacific SST may have large impacts on global temperature s (Clement et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2015) and low- to mid-latitud e heat and moisture transport, which can amplify small radiative perturbations (Tachikawa et al., 2013).  

As a major source of heat and moisture, the IPWP may hav e played an important role in millennial-scale variability throug h changes in its spatial extent and/or its SST and consequently on th e air-sea heat and moisture exchange. Obtaining long records fro m the IPWP with comparable resolution to the Greenland ice cores, Chinese speleothems, and high-resolution sediment cores fro m other regions will provide insight into the mechanisms driving centennial- to millennial-scale climate variability in the context o f changes in background climate states.  

# Reconstructing orbital-scale climate variability through the Neogene  

Significant glacial–interglacial variability characterizes SST reconstructions from the WPWP with the glacial–interglacial temperature amplitude increasing from ${\sim}2^{\circ}C$ in the Pliocene to $3^{\circ}C$ i n the Pleistocene (de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2005; Medina-Elizald e and Lea, 2005, 2010). These changes are also associated wit h changes in surface-water $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{seawater}},$ suggesting concomitant hydroclimate changes. Because the tropical Pacific is located far from th e polar ice sheets, studies have suggested that the glacial–interglacial variability of tropical Pacific SST is mostly driven by changes in atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ (e.g., Lea, 2004; Hansen et al., 2008) and to a lesse r extent by changes in local insolation (e.g., Tachikawa et al., 2013). I n addition, there may also be strong extratropical controls of WPW P temperatures due to ocean dynamical processes. For example, th e presence of significant obliquity variability in SST records from th e WPWP throughout the past ${\sim}2$ My attests to strong linkages wit h high-latitude climate variability (de Garidel-Thoron et al., 2005 ) likely transported through the thermocline. The causes and exten t of past precipitation changes in the WPWP are not well constraine d in terms of the relative importance of changes in boundary conditions in the equatorial Pacific compared to the high latitudes, thei r relationship to equatorial dynamics and the position of the ITCZ, and their associated climate system feedbacks (Figure F2).  

Lithologic proxy records of precipitation from the wester n equatorial Pacific suggest that precession-driven interhemispheri c changes in local insolation exert the strongest control on equatorial Pacific hydroclimate, primarily associated with the migration of th e ITCZ (Kissel et al., 2010; Tachikawa et al., 2011) and possibly modulated by ENSO-type processes (Dang et al., 2015). Notably, thes e precipitation records show no glacial–interglacial cyclicity and n o clear causal linkage to the climate of the North Atlantic (e.g., Kissel et al., 2010; Tachikawa et al., 2011; Carolin et al., 2013). However, recent studies suggest that southward displacement of the ITC Z during deglaciations may have played an important role in the inception of glacial terminations through its influence on the positio n of the southwesterly winds as the wind systems are linked. A southward shift of the southern westerly jet may have led to increased upwelling of $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ -rich deep water around Antarctica, which in tur n enhanced the deglaciation (Denton et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2009). Modeling studies, supported by new records, confirm th e idea of “interhemispheric teleconnection,” whereby warming (cooling) of the Northern Hemisphere causes both the ITCZ and th e Southern Hemispheric mid-latitude jet to shift northward (southward) (Lee et al., 2011; Ayliffe et al., 2013; Ceppi et al., 2013). Investigating these interconnections and their evolution throughout th e Neogene under different background climate states is one of th e overarching goals of this expedition.  

On million-year timescales, the relationships between differen t equilibrium states of the tropical Pacific and changes in the Equator-to-pole temperature gradient have likely affected ocean circulation and thus global climate evolution from the middle Miocen e through the late Pleistocene. Specifically, long-term Cenozoic cooling was interrupted by periods of relative global warmth during th e Middle Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO; ${\sim}17{-}15\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and th e early Pliocene warm period $(4.5{-}3\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Zachos et al., 2001). Th e period since the MMCO interval is of special interest due to a perceived decoupling between global SSTs and variations in atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ (e.g., LaRiviere et al., 2012). The early Pliocene war m period is also of particular interest because global surface temperatures were ${\sim}2^{\circ}{-}3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ higher than at present (Dowsett et al., 2009), which is comparable with projections for the twenty-first century, whereas atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was arguably similar to today’s level s $({\sim}400{-}450~\mathrm{ppmv})$ (Kürschner et al., 1996; Pagani et al., 2010; Fedorov et al., 2013). Studies suggest that this period was characterized by a reduced Pacific zonal temperature gradient due t o substantial warming of eastern equatorial Pacific SST (e.g., Wara e t al., 2005). However, the spatial extent and magnitude of SST chang e in the WPWP and their implications for tropical precipitation ar e debated (Brierley et al., 2009; Fedorov et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014; Ravelo et al., 2014), and new records from this expedition will contribute to this discussion.  

The MMCO was also characterized by a warm and humid climate (Mosbrugger et al., 2005; Bruch et al., 2007), with some evidence for even weaker meridional temperature gradients than in th e Pliocene (Flower and Kennett, 1994; Bruch et al., 2007; Holbourn e t al., 2010), although there are very few data available, particularl y from the WPWP, to help constrain global temperature gradients. After the MMCO, the climate cooled gradually through the lat e Miocene in many regions but was still warmer than today. It is currently debated whether the WPWP temperature was, on average, similar to today through the late Miocene (Nathan and Leckie, 2009) or significantly warmer (Zhang et al., 2014). The climat e mechanisms that explain past warmth during the MMCO, the lat e Miocene, and the early Pliocene are not fully understood, but greenhouse gas forcing and ocean circulation are considered to be important factors. Recent data suggest that $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was higher tha n today during the MMCO (Kürschner et al., 2008; Retallack, 2009; Zhang et al., 2013; Greenop et al., 2014) and in the early Pliocen e warm period (Pagani et al., 2010; Seki et al., 2010). However, reconstructions suggest $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ was relatively low in the late Miocene, similar to levels during the Pleistocene, even though the climate wa s relatively warm and Northern Hemisphere ice sheets were onl y starting to develop. At face value, this scenario indicates that mor e than one climate state (i.e., late Miocene warmth and late Pleistocene glaciation) is possible for a given $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ forcing. Thus, factor s other than $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2},$ such as the influence of tectonic opening or closure of oceanic gateways on ocean circulation (Cane and Molnar, 2001; Steph et al., 2010) or different modes of deepwater productio n and circulation (Woodard et al., 2014), may have played a critica l role in determining global climate. In particular, tectonic change s affecting the transport of water from the western Pacific to the Indian Ocean is one mechanism proposed to explain changes in globa l climate (Cane and Molnar, 2001).  

# Reconstructing changes in the ITF through the Neogene  

Hydrographic measurements indicate that nearly all of the IT F water in the Makassar Strait derives from the relatively coo l NPSTW and NPIW (Gordon and Fine, 1996; Gordon and Susanto, 1999). At present, the contribution of denser SPSTW from th e NGCC to the ITF is limited because of the proximity of West Papu a to the Equator (Gordon and Fine, 1996; Hautala et al., 1996; Johnso n and McPhaden, 1999; Cane and Molnar, 2001). On longer timescales, the strongest controls on the properties and strength of th e ITF are likely sea level changes leading to the exposure and floodin g of the Sunda shelf (Xu et al., 2008; Linsley et al., 2010) and tectoni c closure of the Indonesian seaways, which likely influenced regiona l and global climate (Cane and Molnar, 2001; Kuhnt et al., 2004). Based on preliminary results from IODP Expedition 356, for example, it has been suggested that long-term changes in the ITF exerte d a strong control on the climate of northwest Australia (Christense n et al., 2017). By reconstructing the thermocline structure at Expedition 363 sites located in the heart of the WPWP and off northwes t Australia, near the exit of the ITF into the Indian Ocean, we can distinguish changes in ITF transport due to tectonic versus global climate changes from the late Neogene to present. New high– sedimentation rate cores enable us not only to study long-ter m changes in ITF transport (e.g., Karas et al., 2009, 2011) but also t o assess the long-term variability of the ITF at orbital and suborbital timescales.  

# Assessing the vertical density structure of the IPWP during the LGM  

The spatial pattern of temperature and salinity in the ocean represents the distribution of different water masses and is used to infer deep-ocean circulation. It would be ideal to use the sam e approach to reconstruct ocean circulation in the past, but we ar e currently limited by the availability of proxies with sufficient accuracy to reconstruct temperature and salinity variability in the past. Specifically, benthic foraminiferal $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records cannot unequivocally be interpreted in terms of changes in ice volume, temperature, and salinity because these factors all affect the isotopic compositio n of the foraminifer tests. For the LGM, we can resolve this uncertainty by using the approach developed for reconstructing th e chlorinity (as a measure of salinity) and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of seawater from interstitial water profiles of deep-ocean sediment (Adkins et al., 2002; Schrag and DePaolo, 1993; Schrag et al., 1996).  

The LGM left the ocean on average ${\sim}3.5\%$ enriched in salt an d ${\sim}1.0\%_{0}$ enriched in $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ from the growth of land-based ice sheets. However,  these  enrichments  vary  locally,  depending  on  pas t changes in circulation and water mass properties. Using high-precision $\left[{{\bf{C}}{\bf{l}}-}\right]$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ measurements of the interstitial water profile s downhole to $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ below seafloor (mbsf) and applying a 1-D advection/diffusion equation, the amplitude of the seawater salinit y and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ change can be estimated, and when combined with foraminifer $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{calcite}},$ these data can be used to estimate the temperature and density of the LGM ocean. Previous studies show that mos t of the LGM deep ocean was near freezing, whereas deep ocean salinity varied more than that of the modern ocean (Adkins et al., 2002). Specifically, the available interstitial water data suggest tha t the LGM density gradient along the Atlantic Ocean was very different from today, with the saltiest water forming around Antarctic a during the LGM as opposed to around Greenland in the moder n ocean (Adkins et al., 2002). The overall picture is one of a salinitystratified ocean with different water mass geometries. Enhance d vertical stratification at the LGM would have had significant implications for the carbon budget of the ocean and $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ of the atmosphere at that time (Broecker and Barker, 2007). However, most o f the presently available data come from the Atlantic Ocean, and t o date there is only one record from the southern Pacific Ocean (OD P Site 1123; Adkins et al., 2002). New interstitial water profiles collected during Expedition 363 span a water depth of $\sim\!1000\!-\!3800$ mbsl and will allow us to reconstruct the stratification of the equatorial Pacific Ocean at the LGM.  

# Using interstitial water profiles to reconstruct diagenetic processes and their implications for seawater composition  

The study of uranium (U) and sulfur (S) interstitial water chemistry will be important for evaluating diagenetic processes at th e sites targeted by Expedition 363, with significant implications fo r our understanding of the proxy data generated with expeditio n samples and of the Earth system as a whole. The $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ ratios o f interstitial water have been demonstrated to be a sensitive indicato r of the amount of silicate dissolution and calcite recrystallization i n deep-marine sediment over submillion-year timescales (Maher e t al., 2004). Furthermore, the $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ ratio of the globally integrate d U flux from interstitial water to seawater is poorly known. $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ measurements on interstitial water collected from the range o f depositional environments sampled by Expedition 363 will provid e an important indicator of the diagenetic alteration of carbonate s and will place constraints on the global composition of the uraniu m outflux from marine sediments. Such data will be important fo r evaluating the robustness of carbonate-based environmental proxies generated by Expedition 363 postcruise research. These data wil l also provide insight regarding the influence of marine diagenesis o n the global $^{234}\mathrm{U}/^{238}\mathrm{U}$ budget. A better understanding of this budge t should allow for improvement of the U-series dating calibratio n used in many records of Pleistocene oceanographic changes (e.g., Hines et al., 2015) and better constrain the amount of chemica l weathering on glacial–interglacial timescales (e.g., Chen et al., 2016).  

The diagenesis of S and associated isotopic mass balance model s of the ocean play an important role in our understanding of the progressive oxygenation of Earth’s surface on geological timescales an d of the relative burial fluxes of oxidized and reduced S species i n modern marine sediment. Although ample studies (e.g., Jørgensen, 1977; Lyons et al., 2004) have documented S diagenesis throug h measurements of the S isotopic composition of pyrite and aqueou s S species in shallow-shelf sediment, our knowledge of the S isotopi c composition of pyrite buried in deep-sea sediment under generall y oxic water columns is incomplete. Expedition 363 presents an excellent opportunity to study S diagenesis through aqueous and soli d phase $\delta^{34}\!S$ measurements in relatively deep ocean sites across  a range of water depths $(875{-}3421~\mathrm{mbsl)}$ , sedimentation rates, an d terrigenous sediment fluxes, all of which may potentially influence  S diagenetic processes. High sedimentation rates through the Pleistocene at several sites (e.g., Sites U1484 and U1485) should also allo w exploration of the potential for these influences to impact sulfu r diagenesis and thus pyrite $\delta^{34}\!S$ on glacial–interglacial timescales . Additional measurements of interstitial water samples, includin g boron (B), lithium (Li), magnesium $\left(\mathrm{Mg}\right)$ , calcium $(\mathbf{Ca})$ , silica (Si), and strontium (Sr) elemental concentrations and their isotopic ratios, will be used to study processes related to $C a C O_{3}$ diagenesis an d in situ weathering of silicate minerals in the sediment and the implications for changes in seawater composition during the Neogene.  

# Specific scientific objectives

# Site summaries Site U1482  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1482 (proposed Site WP-12D) is located on the northwes t Australian margin at $15^{\circ}3.32^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $120^{\circ}26.10^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in $1466~\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F7). The site is situated at Shotpoint 440 on seismic Lin e HBR2000A-3032, ${\sim}581\,\mathrm{~m~}$ northwest of the crosspoint of seismi c Lines HBR2000A-3032 and BR98-84. The top of the first prominen t reflector, originally interpreted as the middle Miocene sequenc e boundary (Mi-3; $13.8\;\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ), is $_{0.55\,\mathrm{~s~}}$ two-way traveltime (TWT) below the seafloor, equivalent to $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Site U1482 is on the Scott Plateau, which corresponds to a subside d platform area that forms the northwestern flank of the northeasttrending Browse Basin (Keep et al., 2007; Hall, 2012). This region, which is adjacent to some of the oldest ocean crust still in th e world’s oceans (Argo Abyssal Plain), has remained a stable passiv e margin since the breakup of Gondwanaland and the separation o f northwest Australia from the Tethyan landmass (Gradstein, 1992). As a result of the northward movement of the Australian plate, continuous Neogene deformation along the normal faults that boun d the Scott Plateau has led to the amplification of relief between th e Browse Basin and the Scott Plateau and may have resulted in som e of the downslope transport seen in the seismic profiles (Keep et al., 2007) and sediment deformation in the cores recovered at this site.  

The Mesozoic section beneath the Scott Plateau is strongly influenced by breakup-related tectonics that form the acoustic basement through much of the Scott Plateau area (Stagg and Exon, 1981). The postbreakup sedimentary succession forms an ${\sim}2000\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, relatively uniform blanket over the Scott Plateau and th e northeastern margin of the Browse Basin. The extended Miocene t o recent sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1482 provides a n ideal archive to reconstruct the climate and circulation history a t the southwestern edge of the IPWP at a higher resolution than i s possible at nearby deep-sea ODP sites (e.g., Site 761 on the Womba t Plateau; Holbourn et al., 2004) (Figure F3).  

The location of Site U1482 within the prominent hydrographi c front separating tropical and subtropical water masses makes i t suitable to monitor changes in the southern extent of tropical war m water related to circulation and/or global climate trends. The site i s situated close to the oceanographic front between relatively cool, nutrient-rich water carried northward in the Eastern Indian Ocea n by the West Australian Current and warm, oligotrophic Leeuwi n Current waters, which results in a steep north–south SST gradien t (Figure F1). This strategic location will allow reconstruction of th e

southwestern extent of the IPWP and monitoring of the ITF outflow into the Indian Ocean since the early late Miocene.  

The extended sediment archive recovered at Site U1482 will enable reconstruction of climate variability on orbital timescales ove r the past ${\sim}10$ My, which will complement high-resolution record s from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Southern Oceans and will be crucia l for constraining regional and global circulation modes and Miocen e ice volume variations. The new Pliocene record from Site U1482 i s also ideally suited to test the hypothesis of a major restriction o f warm water throughflow originating from the South Pacific Ocea n between 3 and $5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ due to the northward movement of Papua Ne w Guinea, which may have been a key factor in the aridification o f East Africa and hominid evolution (Cane and Molnar, 2001).  

# Operations  

After a $1514\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Singapore, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1482 at $1524\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are local; $\mathrm{UTC}+8\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on $16\,\mathrm{Oc}.$ tober 2016. We cored four holes at Site U1482 (Table T1). The original operations plan called for three holes, the first to APC refusal, followed by two APC holes with XCB coring to 490 mbsf (our approved depth of penetration for the site). The plan was modified t o core to total depth $(490\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) in the first hole to determine the operations plan for the remaining holes.  

We reached APC refusal at ${\sim}345$ mbsf in Hole U1482A, whic h was cored using nonmagnetic hardware and the Icefield MI-5 cor e orientation tool. The advanced piston corer temperature too l (APCT-3) was deployed on Cores 4H (31.4 mbsf), 7H (59.9 mbsf), 10H (88.4 mbsf), and 13H (116.9 mbsf). We opted to deepen th e hole with the half-length APC (HLAPC) system, which reached 38 0 mbsf before refusal. We then switched to the XCB system to core t o the total approved depth of 490 mbsf. Hole U1482B was APC core d to 343.6 mbsf and then HLAPC cored to 366.6 mbsf. This hole included five intervals drilled without coring to avoid core gap alignment for stratigraphic correlation. Because the age of the sedimen t at the bottom of Hole U1482A was several million years younge r than anticipated, we requested and received permission to cor e deeper at the site. Hole U1482C was APC cored to 335.4 mbsf an d then XCB cored to 534.1 mbsf. We opted to terminate drilling a t that depth due to deteriorating calcareous microfossil preservatio n deeper than 500 mbsf and the increasing length of time required t o cut cores.  

After conditioning the hole for logging, we conducted tw o downhole logging runs using the triple combination (triple combo ) and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool strings in Hol e U1482C. The triple combo tool string reached the bottom of th e hole at $533.4~\mathrm{m}$ wireline depth below seafloor. The FMS-sonic tool string encountered a slurry of fine-grained fill and reached only 51 7 m WSF. Two upward passes were conducted with the FMS-soni c tool string. Following logging, we opted to core Hole U1482D to target three core gaps in the stratigraphic section. We took one core a t the seafloor to establish the seafloor depth before drilling ahead t o 137.0 mbsf. We then took eight APC cores to $213.0~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , successfully covering the targeted core gaps. We then terminated the hole, ending operations at Site U1482 at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 October. Total tim e spent at Site U1482 was $218.5\,\mathrm{h}$ (9.1 days).  

A total of 163 cores were collected at this site. The APC corin g system was deployed 115 times, collecting $1128.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t over $1077.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $(104.7\%)$ . The HLAPC coring syste m was deployed 13 times, recovering $57.01\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $55.3~\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $(103.1\%)$ . The XCB coring system was deployed 3 5 times, collecting $305.32\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over $304~\mathrm{m}$ of penetratio n $(100.4\%)$ . Total recovery for Site U1482 was $1490.33\;\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t over $1436.6\:\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(103.7\%)$ ).  

# Principal results  

The sediment cored at Site U1482 is assigned to a single lithologic unit composed of ${\sim}535\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of upper Miocene to Pleistocen e nannofossil ooze/chalk with varying amounts of clay and foraminifers (Figure F8). Lithologic Unit I is divided into four subunits. Subunit IA is an ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of Pleistocene light greenis h middle part of Subunit IB also contains an interval of significan t soft-sediment deformation at ${\sim}170~\mathrm{mbsf.}$ Sulfide specks and nodules are abundant, and foraminifer content increases toward th e bottom of the subunit. The base of Subunit IB is the first downhol e occurrence of well-defined light–dark cycles. Subunit IC ( ${\sim}160\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) consists of upper Miocene to lowermost Pliocene light greenish gray nannofossil ooze with varying abundances of foraminifer s and clay. This subunit shows strong color cyclicity at a section scale, with cycles largely reflecting changes in carbonate content ( $\mathord{\sim}80$ t o

gray clay-rich nannofossil ooze. This subunit contains pteropod s and is largely homogeneous with variable amounts of clay. In th e lowermost $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ of the subunit, dark–light bedding cycles becom e more evident. The boundary between Subunits IA and IB marks  a sharp transition between darker clay-rich foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze and dominantly lighter nannofossil ooze.

$50\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Sulfide patches are abundant throughout. The base of the subunit is defined by the transition from ooze to chalk, which corresponds to the switch from the HLAPC to XCB coring system in Hole U1482A. Subunit ID is composed of upper Miocene light greenish gray chalk with low abundances of clay. Color cycles are on the order of 1.5 to $2\;\mathrm{m}$ thick in this subunit. Dissolution of foraminifers has resulted in moldic porosity within the chalk. Foraminifers are also occasionally concentrated in discrete layers in Subunit ID.  

Throughout the recovered succession at Site U1482, calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers are abundant and benthic foraminifers are present and generally show very good to excellent preservation. Planktonic/benthic ratios are typically 99:1. The age model for Site U1482 is based on calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy (Figure F9). The base of the late Pleistocene is placed at ${\sim}3$ mbsf, between biohorizon top Globigerinoides ruber (pink) $(0.12\mathrm{~Ma})$ and biohorizon base Emiliania huxleyi $\left(0.29\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . The base of the middle Pleistocene is placed between 47 and 80 mbsf, between the top of Globorotalia tosaensis $\left(0.61\,M\mathrm{a}\right)$ and the top of Helicosphaera sellii $\left(1.26\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . There is strong evidence for sedimentary disturbance and reworking in the lower and middle Pleistocene with the potential for a missing section in the lower Pleistocene. The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary is placed at 118 mbsf (Figure F9). A concentration of planktonic foraminifer biohorizons at 300 mbsf $({\sim}6.1{-}6.6\ \mathrm{Ma})$ suggests a condensed interval or hiatus. This interval is less clear in the calcareous nannofossil biohorizons, although nannofossil age control is sparse at this level. Otherwise, sedimentation appears continuous throughout the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene interval (Figure F9). The age at the base of the recovered succession is constrained as $<\!10.47$ Ma by the absence of the planktonic foraminifer Paragloborotalia mayeri in the lowermost sample examined, although calcareous nannofossil assemblages suggest a slightly older age of ${\sim}10.75$ Ma based on identification of the biohorizon top Helicosphaera walbersdorfensis $\left\langle10.72\,M\mathbf{a}\right\rangle$ and the biohorizon base Helicosphaera stalis $(10.75\;\mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}15\mathrm{~m~}$ above the base of Hole U1482C. Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons are in generally good agreement and indicate sedimentation rates of ${\sim}5.9\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the late Miocene, decreasing to ${\sim}3.3\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the early Pliocene. The Pleistocene was characterized by higher sedimentation rates of ${\sim}7$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F9).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1482 measured natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archive halves from Holes U1482A–U1482C before and after demagnetization in a peak alternating field (AF) of $15~\mathrm{mT},$ , which effectively removed the vertical overprint induced by the drill string. Fifty $7~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ discrete samples were taken to investigate paleomagnetic carriers and rock magnetic properties. $\mathrm{NRM}_{\mathrm{15mT}}$ intensity is higher $({\sim}10^{-4}~\mathrm{A/m})$ in the uppe r 40–60 mbsf of each hole, decreases between 60 and 90 mbsf, an d remains low $({\sim}10^{-5}\;\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m})$ below ${\sim}90~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , where it approaches th e measurement noise level of the magnetometer. Decreases in magnetic intensity downhole are accompanied by decreases in othe r ferrimagnetic concentration parameters (anhysteretic remanen t magnetization [ARM] and isothermal remanent magnetizatio n [IRM]), a halving of the $\mathrm{NRM_{15mT}/N R M}$ intensity, and a coarsenin g of magnetic grain size (lower ARM/saturation remanent magnetization [SIRM]). These changes are coeval with decreases in interstitia l water sulfate $\left(\mathrm{SO_{4}}\right)$ and the appearance of pyrite in the sediment associated with the reduction of primary ferrimagnetic oxides an d formation of secondary iron sulfides during early sediment diagenesis. In the upper 50–70 mbsf, inclinations plot around those expected for the site latitude, assuming a geocentric axial dipol e (GAD) field. Azimuthally corrected declination using the Icefiel d MI-5 core orientation tool is largely consistent between successiv e cores but maintains an absolute offset of $150^{\circ}{-}180^{\circ}$ (i.e., correcte d declination values for normal polarity cluster between $150^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ instead of $0^{\circ}$ ). Relatively weak magnetic susceptibility coupled wit h reduction of ferrimagnetic oxides results in a largely uninterpretable signal below the iron-reduction zone and restricts our geomagnetic interpretation to the upper 50–70 mbsf. Sediment in this zon e appears to have been deposited during a period of normal polarit y consistent with the Brunhes Chron (C1n).  

The physical property data collected for Site U1482 include $P$ wave velocity, gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, magneti c susceptibility, natural gamma radiation (NGR), and thermal conductivity  measurements  on  whole-round  cores  from  Hole s U1482A–U1482D and $P$ -wave velocity, thermal conductivity, porosity, and bulk, dry, and grain density measurements on split core s or discrete samples. Despite the relatively homogeneous litholog y dominated by nannofossil ooze at this site, physical property parameters display comparable broad-scale features and high-resolution cyclicity throughout the sequence, allowing for correlation s among the holes (Figure F8). A linear downhole increase is apparen t in the thermal conductivity $({\sim}1.0{-}1.5\;\mathrm{W/[m{\cdot}K])}$ , GRA bulk densit y $({\sim}1.4{-}2.0\ \mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ , and moisture and density (MAD) dry densit y $(0.8{-}1.5~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and wet bulk density $(1.4{-}2.0~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ records. Th e decreasing trend in porosity from $\sim\!75\%$ to $45\%$ is due to increasin g compaction with depth. A broad peak in GRA bulk density, NGR, and magnetic susceptibility centered at $\mathord{\sim}175$ mbsf marks an interval of soft-sediment deformation observed in all holes (Figure F8). Downhole formation temperature measurements made with th e APCT-3 on Cores 363-U1482A-4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H indicate  a geothermal gradient of $48^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ for the upper ${\sim}120$ mbsf.  

Tie points for stratigraphic correlation were established mainl y with Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) magnetic susceptibility data, although some were based on WRMSL GRA bul k density and NGR data. Correlation was challenging due to interval s with very low amplitude variability in the WRMSL and NGR signals, the presence of intervals containing soft-sediment deformation, and variations in the size of core gaps that resulted from a larg e tidal range of $3{-}4\mathrm{~m~}$ during coring operations at Site U1482. Th e core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) depth scale is anchored to the mudline Core 363-U1482B-1H, which is assigned th e depth of $0\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CCSF}.$ From this anchor, we worked downhole to establish a composite stratigraphy on a core-by-core basis. We developed a splice from $0{-}451.2\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF and a composite depth scale t o $614.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. The match between the holes is well constraine d within the splice, except for intervals of soft-sediment deformatio n (0–17, 55–84, 104–111, and $207{-}210\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF})$ ) and one core gap a t 401 m CCSF. Below $451\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF, we determined tentative correlations between some cores but did not construct a splice, whic h should be explored as part of postcruise research.  

A total of 62 interstitial water samples were analyzed at Sit e U1482, including 57 whole-round samples and 1 mudline sampl e from Hole U1482A (from 0 to $489~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) and 4 whole-round samples from Hole U1482C (from 490 to $533~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), to achieve a complete interstitial water profile for the full stratigraphic succession a t this site. The interstitial water chemistry at Site U1482 is strongl y influenced by the remineralization of organic matter. Total organi c carbon (TOC) content is ${>}1.0\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ in the uppermost ${\sim}90$ mbsf (Figure F8), which is relatively high for an open marine setting. In th e upper 120 mbsf, interstitial water profiles of alkalinity, manganes e (Mn), $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ barium (Ba), Si, and methane reflect the progressio n from suboxic organic matter degradation to $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ reduction. At ${\sim}120$ mbsf, near-complete consumption of $S O_{4}$ and a rapid increase i n methane mark the transition to fermentation and anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM). This transition, known as the sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ), is also marked by a pronounce d increase in dissolved Ba, reflecting both authigenic precipitatio n and dissolution of sedimentary barite $\mathrm{(BaSO_{4})}$ in underlying sediment. Steady downhole increases in ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)$ and bromid e (Br) are also consistent with progressive remineralization of organi c matter. Ca and $\mathrm{Mg}$ concentrations decrease in the upper 120 mbsf, possibly reflecting calcite precipitation. Phosphate $\textstyle(\mathrm{PO}_{4})$ decrease s over the same depth interval, which may be due to precipitation o f apatite, although overall $\left[\mathrm{PO_{4}}\right]$ is quite low $(<\!10\;\upmu\mathrm{M})$ and no apatit e was detected by XRD analysis. Below 120 mbsf, $\mathrm{Mg}$ continues to decrease, whereas Ca slightly increases. Although this increase suggests precipitation of dolomite, downhole trends in potassium (K), B, and Li indicate that ion exchange with clay minerals could contribute to the trends observed in the interstitial water profiles.  

Hydrocarbon monitoring shows high methane concentratio n below the SMTZ, with an average of $6\%$ . However, the ratio o f methane to ethane and the gas wetness index suggest that most o f the gas has a biogenic origin. Methane concentration decreases t o ${\sim}3\%$ between $\mathord{\sim}380$ and $530~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , reflecting progressive depletio n of available organic matter for methanogenesis. Both ethane an d propane profiles largely follow methane but also respond to the increased thermal maturity with depth as a result of the geothermal gradient.  

The calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ content at Site U1482 fluctuates between 0 and 180 mbsf with an average of ${\sim}60~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figur e F8). Below 180 mbsf, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content increases to ${\sim}80\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , consistent with the late Miocene to early Pliocene “biogenic bloom” that i s most pronounced in the Indo-Pacific region (e.g., Farrell et al., 1995; Gupta and Thomas, 1999).  

Two downhole logging tool strings were run in Hole U1482C , the triple combo (NGR, porosity, density, electrical resistivity, an d magnetic susceptibility) and the FMS-sonic (NGR, sonic velocity, and electrical resistivity images). The triple combo tool strin g reached to the bottom of the hole at $533.4\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF, whereas th e FMS-sonic tool string only reached $517\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ after encounterin g fill in the bottom of the hole. One of the four FMS pads performe d poorly, but postacquisition processing corrected the problem. Caliper data show that the borehole was enlarged by ${\sim}2.5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ in th e upper 250 mbsf, which affected the quality of the density and porosity measurements and resulted in higher variability in those data. Deeper than 350 mbsf, corresponding to the depth where w e switched to XCB coring, the borehole walls were remarkabl y smooth. This interval corresponds to lithologic Subunit ID, whic h consists of chalk.  

The composite gamma ray log shows an increase between 11 8 and $207~\mathrm{m}$ wireline matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) (Subunit IB) that correlates with an increase in NGR measured on cores, indicating a higher proportion of clay over that interval. Shallo w and deep resistivity measurements show a consistent offset downhole, indicating that there was little or no fluid invasion into the formation. $P$ -wave velocity values increase steadily downhole t o roughly $2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at the bottom of the hole. Discrete $z$ -axis $P$ -wav e measurements on cores provide an estimate for the interval fro m the seafloor to the bottom of the drill pipe at $74.7~\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Combining these data, we were able to establish a velocity profile to the bottom of the hole and derive reliable calculations of depths to ke y reflectors in the seismic data crossing Site U1482.  

# Site U1483  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1483 (proposed Site WP-11B) is located on the northwes t Australian margin at $13^{\circ}5.24^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $121^{\circ}48.25^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in $1733~\mathrm{m}$ water dept h (Figure F7). The site is situated on seismic Line BR98-117, $1300\;\mathrm{m}$ northeast of the intersection with seismic Line BR98-168 and ${\sim}0.8$ nmi southeast of the ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ long piston Core MD01-2378, whic h provides insights into late Pleistocene sedimentation and stratigraphy at this location (e.g., Holbourn et al., 2005; Kuhnt et al., 2015). The interpretation of Miocene seismic reflectors is based o n comparison to the Australian Geological Survey Organisation regional seismic survey Line 119-04 (well control by Buffon 1 an d Brewster 1A) and the BBHR Line 175/10 (well control by Argus 1). A major unconformity marks the top of the prograding sequence a t 0.72 s TWT below seafloor and is interpreted as the middle Miocene sequence boundary corresponding to a major sea level drop associated with rapid expansion of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (Mi-3; 13. 8 Ma) (Rosenthal et al., 2016).  

Site U1483 is situated on the Scott Plateau at the northwester n margin of the northeast-trending Browse Basin (Figure F7), whic h underlies the Australian northwest margin between the onshor e Kimberley Basin and the Scott Plateau (Symonds et al., 1994). Thi s region, which is adjacent to some of the oldest ocean crust still i n the world’s oceans (Argo Abyssal Plain), formed after the breakup o f Gondwanaland and the separation of northwest Australia from th e Tethyan landmass (Gradstein, 1992). The Mesozoic section beneat h the Scott Plateau is strongly influenced by breakup-related tectonism and forms the acoustic basement through much of the Scot t Plateau area (Stagg and Exon, 1981). The postbreakup sedimentar y succession forms an ${\sim}2000\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, relatively uniform blanket ove r the Scott Plateau and the northeastern margin of Browse Basin. Sit e U1483 is located south of the Sunda arc, where ongoing collisio n between Australia and the Eurasia/Pacific arc system has occurre d since the Miocene (Keep et al., 2007; Hall, 2012). However, intens e Neogene faulting is mainly observed in the southernmost parts o f the Browse Basin (Barcoo Subbasin), whereas the northern parts ar e relatively devoid of intense Neogene deformation (Keep et al., 2007).  

Site U1483 is located ${\sim}142\ \mathrm{nmi}$ northeast of Site U1482. Bot h sites are within the hydrographic transition that separates the war m tropical water of the IPWP and subtropical water masses. Jointly, the two sites are suitable to monitor changes in the southward extent of tropical warm water related to circulation and/or global climate trends. Both sites are close to the oceanographic fron t between relatively cool, nutrient-rich water carried northward i n the Eastern Indian Ocean by the West Australian Current an d warm, oligotrophic Leeuwin Current water, which results in a stee p north–south SST gradient (Figure F1).  

The sedimentation rate at Site U1483 is $\mathrm{{\sim9\cm/ky}}$ (Holbourn e t al., 2005), about twice the rate at Site U1482, which will allow for th e reconstruction of late Pliocene to recent paleoceanography a t higher resolution than at Site U1482. Combined, the two sites will allow for reconstruction of the southwestern extent of the IPW P since the early late Miocene. Furthermore, the sites are locate d along the route of the ITF as it exits into the Indian Ocean throug h the Timor Strait between northwest Australia and Java (Figure F7) . The Timor Strait is one of the three main exits of the ITF to the eastern Indian Ocean (Gordon, 2005). Thus, Sites U1482 and U1483 ar e ideally located to monitor changes in the intensity and thermal structure of ITF water masses entering the Eastern Indian Ocea n (e.g., Xu et al., 2008).  

# Operations  

After a $142\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1482, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1483 at $_{0630\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 26 October 2016. We cored three hole s at Site U1483 (Table T1). The original operations plan called fo r coring to APC refusal (estimated at $250~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), followed by two additional holes deepened to 350 mbsf using the XCB system. Instead , we cored three holes using the APC system to $\sim\!290$ mbsf, the dept h at which we encountered APC refusal. We decided not to deepe n the holes to the original planned total depth because we had alread y reached our primary age target.  

Hole U1483A was cored with the APC system using the Icefiel d MI-5 core orientation tool and nonmagnetic hardware to 293. 3 mbsf (Cores 363-U1483A-1H through 31H), where a partial strok e indicated APC refusal. Downhole temperature measurements usin g the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H $(37.1\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ), 7H $(65.6~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , 10H (94.1 mbsf), and 13H $122.6~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , and reliable results wer e obtained on three of the four deployments. A total of $308.58\mathrm{~m~}$ o f sediment was recovered over $293.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of coring $(105\%)$ in Hol e U1483A.  

Hole U1483B was then cored with the APC system using th e Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool and nonmagnetic hardware t o 287.0 mbsf (Cores 363-U1483B-1H through 31H). A total of 301.6 2 m of sediment was collected over this interval $(105\%)$ . Oriente d APC coring using the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool with nonmagnetic hardware continued in Hole U1483C and reached 284. 8 mbsf (Cores 363-U1483C-1H through 31H). One drilled interval ( 3 m) advanced the hole without coring to avoid alignment of cor e gaps for stratigraphic correlation. A total of $292.42\textrm{m}$ of core wa s recovered over $281.8~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(104\%)$ . Operations at Site U148 3 ended at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 October. Total time spent at the site was 97. 5 h (4.1 days).  

A total of 92 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $902.62\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $862.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $(105.2\%)$ ).  

# Principal results  

The sediment cored at Site U1483 is assigned to a single lithologic unit composed of ${\sim}293\mathrm{~m~}$ of lower Pliocene to recent nannofossil ooze with variable amounts of clay, foraminifers, and siliceou s microfossils (primarily diatoms and radiolarians) (Figure F10) . Tephra layers occur sporadically throughout the unit. Lithologi c Unit I is divided into three subunits. Subunit IA is an ${\sim}56\mathrm{~m~}$ sequence of middle Pleistocene to recent greenish gray clay-bearin g and clay-rich nannofossil ooze. Sponge spicules and mollusk shell fragments are common throughout this subunit, whereas pteropod s are restricted to the upper 40 mbsf. Meter-scale alternations between dark greenish gray and light greenish gray sediment are apparent and also recorded in NGR and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ records. The boundar y between Subunits IA and IB is defined by the first downhole appearance of brownish gray diatom-rich nannofossil ooze. Subunit I B (early to middle Pleistocene) is an ${\sim}130\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of greenish gray clay-rich nannofossil ooze, diatom-rich nannofossil clay, and clay-rich diatom-nannofossil ooze. This subunit is distinguished by higher biosiliceous content than that in Subunit IA. Cla y content increases toward the bottom of Subunit IB. Color alternations are at the section scale $\left(\sim\!1.5\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ . The darker colored interval s have higher siliceous microfossil and organic matter content tha n the lighter colored intervals. Shell fragments are also commo n throughout this subunit. The boundary between Subunits IB and I C is denoted by a significant reduction in the abundance of siliceou s microfossils. Subunit IC is composed of ${\sim}105\mathrm{~m~}$ of greenish gra y foraminifer-rich nannofossil clay. Two significant intervals of softsediment deformation occur in this subunit (Figure F10). The uppe r unit is ${\sim}24~\mathrm{m}$ thick, whereas the lower unit has varying thicknesse s among the holes. These intervals include inclined bedding, folding, and microfaulting. Dark gray clay layers that exhibit high bulk density also occur in the deformed intervals.

The $293\mathrm{~m~}$ succession recovered at Site U1483 contains abundant, diverse, tropical calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer assemblages. Planktonic foraminifers dominate the ${>}63~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction; however, other microfossil groups are also present an d include benthic foraminifers, diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, and occasionally ostracods. The planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratios are typically 99:1. Preservation is generally excellent to ver y good throughout the entire succession, although a minor decreas e in preservation is noted with depth.  

Integrated calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminife r biostratigraphy, together with magnetostratigraphy, indicates tha t the succession at Site U1483 spans the late early Pliocene to the recent (Figure F11). Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons are generally in good agreement. The age at th e bottom of the recovered succession is $>\!3.59$ Ma based on the presence of Sphaeroidinella seminulina. Biostratigraphy in the lowermost part of the recovered section (\~293–260 mbsf) suggest s sedimentation rates of ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ during the late early Pliocene. The interval between $\mathord{\sim}260$ and 193.5 mbsf includes two packages o f disturbed sediment. A clustering of biohorizons around 260–24 3 mbsf coincides with the deeper disturbed interval and is overlain b y what appears to be intact stratigraphy, with another interval of clustered biohorizons from $\mathord{\sim}200$ to 193 mbsf. Based on the mixed fossil assemblages found in the two intervals, these clusters could represent the top and base of a single, large mass movement dated to ${\sim}2.1$ Ma or two (or more) discrete events dated to ${\sim}2.8$ and $2.1\,\mathrm{\OmegaMa}$

Figure F11. Age-depth plot for Site U1483 showing integrated biomagnetochronology for Hole U1483A. Average sedimentation rates were ${\sim}10\,{\mathsf{c m}}/1$ ky durin g deposition of the entire sequence. Two disturbed intervals were observed (gray boxes). These disturbed intervals are associated with intervals of mixed P F assemblages, calcareous nannofossil reworking, and intervals of lithologic disturbance.  

Above the disturbed interval, sedimentation rates were essentiall y constant at ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from 2 Ma to present.  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1483 involved measurement of the NRM of all archive halves before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Sixty-two $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ discrete samples wer e taken to investigate paleomagnetic carriers and rock magneti c properties. $\mathrm{NRM}_{\mathrm{15mT}}$ intensity is higher in the upper $\mathord{\sim}75$ mbsf o f each hole, decreases between 75 and 85 mbsf, and remains low an d variable deeper than ${\sim}85$ mbsf, occasionally approaching the measurement noise level of the magnetometer. Decreases in NRM intensity deeper than ${\sim}75$ mbsf and reductions in the $\mathrm{NRM}_{\mathrm{15mT}}/\mathrm{NRM}$ intensity ratios are coeval with a decrease in interstitial water sulfat e to almost zero and with peak methane concentrations, indicatin g that sediment diagenesis is likely influencing the magnetic mineralogy deeper than ${\sim}75$ mbsf, although rock magnetic properties suggest that these effects may not be as severe as those experienced a t Site U1482. For Holes U1483A and U1483B, azimuthally correcte d declination is internally consistent between adjacent cores, although it maintains an $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ baseline offset in absolute values because declination should cluster around $0^{\circ}$ during periods of norma l polarity. In Hole U1483C, negative inclination (expected for norma l polarity in this Southern Hemisphere location) in the upper part o f Hole U1483C is associated with declinations that cluster aroun d  

$0^{\circ}/360^{\circ}$ . These orientations suggest that the declination offset observed in Holes U1483A and U1483B appears to have self-correcte d in Hole U1483C; however, the cause of this self-correction remain s unclear.  

NRM directions are interpreted for the intervals not affected b y soft-sediment  deformation.  The  Matuyama/Brunhes  boundar y $(0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is identified at ${\sim}80$ mbsf. Below this depth we observ e the upper (\~93 mbsf; $0.988\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ) and lower ( $\mathord{\sim}100$ mbsf; $1.072\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) boundaries of the Jaramillo normal and the upper ( $..170$ mbsf; 1.77 8 Ma) and lower $\mathord{\sim}186$ mbsf; $1.945\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) boundaries of the Olduva i normal, with the lower Olduvai occurring a few meters above th e upper interval of soft-sediment deformation (Figure F10). Guide d by biostratigraphy, we also identify the Gauss/Matuyama boundar y ( ${\sim}223$ mbsf; 2.581 Ma) between the packages of soft-sediment deformation. These reversal horizons are in excellent agreement wit h both the calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons (Figure F11).  

The physical property data collected for Site U1483 include $P$ - wave velocity, GRA bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, NGR, an d thermal conductivity measurements on whole-round cores from all holes and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, porosity, and bulk, dry, and grain densit y measurements on split cores or discrete samples. Despite the relatively homogeneous lithology at Site U1483, physical property parameters display long-term trends and high-resolution variabilit y throughout the recovered succession. Thermal conductivity, GR A bulk density, MAD dry and bulk densities, and porosity are all dominated by a long-term trend of increasing compaction with depth. Subtle changes in GRA bulk density underlying the compactio n trend generally correspond with the lithologic subunits and ar e likely related to changes in clay content. Strong peaks in magneti c susceptibility are found coeval with the occurrence of some of th e tephra layers in multiple holes. Otherwise, magnetic susceptibilit y and NGR are relatively stable throughout the record (Figure F10), unlike the broad long-term trends observed at Site U1482. The tw o intervals of observed soft-sediment deformation are coinciden t with elevated GRA and MAD bulk density values observed a t $\sim\!195\!-\!218$ and ${\sim}243{-}253$ mbsf.  

Tie points between holes at Site U1483 were established mainl y with WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data, although some wer e based primarily on color reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ data. In addition, we use d WRMSL GRA bulk density and NGR data to aid correlations. W e constructed two spliced intervals, one from 0 to $211.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ an d the other from 239.8 to $266.8\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF. We did not construct splice s over the two intervals of soft-sediment deformation (211.5–239. 8 and deeper than $266.8\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CCSF}$ ) because WRMSL GRA bulk density and magnetic susceptibility data variations indicate that there i s not stratigraphic continuity between holes over these intervals. However, we did estimate offsets for the cores within the deforme d intervals because there were some features that could be correlate d between holes.  

A total of 36 interstitial water samples (35 whole-round sample s and 1 mudline sample) were analyzed from Hole U1483A from th e seafloor to 283.3 mbsf. The interstitial water profiles reflect earl y diagenetic processes related to organic matter degradation withi n the sediment, with downhole TOC contents ranging from 0.4 to 1. 4 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F10). The oxic–suboxic transition at Site U1483 occur s at ${\sim}7.5$ mbsf, indicated by a rapid increase in dissolved Mn concentration. The SMTZ observed at ${\sim}50$ mbsf is characterized by quantitative consumption of dissolved $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ and increases in pH (from 7. 7 to 8.4), alkalinity (up to ${\sim}18~\mathrm{mM}$ ), and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ $(25~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ . Dissolved C a decreases to $4~\mathrm{mM}$ at the SMTZ, suggesting active carbonate precipitation at this horizon. $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca}$ ratios suggest that calcite (and not high-Mg calcite and/or dolomite) is most likely th e dominant authigenic phase at the SMTZ. In addition, the rapid increase in the Ba profile at the SMTZ below 45 mbsf is suggestive o f barite dissolution at the SMTZ. In the methanogenic zone below 5 0 mbsf, methane concentration increases to ${\sim}100{,}000$ ppmv at 14 0 mbsf and then decreases to ${\sim}11\small{,}200$ ppmv at the bottom of Hol e U1483A. High methane/ethane ratios suggest that the methane i s mostly of biogenic origin.  

Downhole K, Mg, Li, Cl, and sodium (Na) concentrations reflec t a combination of clay-mineral authigenesis/alteration and interstitial water diffusion. In particular, increasing trends in the Cl and $\mathrm{Na}$ profiles possibly reflect an upward diffusion from higher salinit y fluids below the recovered sedimentary sequence. Changes in Si, Ca, $\mathrm{NH}_{4},$ alkalinity, and Li were observed at the depths of deforme d sediment intervals in Hole U1483A, suggesting that denser clay layers associated with the deformed sediments are influencing reaction/diffusion rates within, below, and/or above the deforme d layers. $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content ranges between 38 and $78\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=59$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ), showing a general increasing trend downhole in lithologi c Subunits IA and IB (Figure F10). The interstitial Si concentration i s also elevated here relative to Site U1482, and the presence of diatoms and radiolarians indicates the importance of biogenic silica a t this site.  

# Site U1484  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1484 (proposed Site WP-71A) is located ${\sim}15~\mathrm{km}$ off th e northern coast of Papua New Guinea at $03^{\circ}07.93^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $142^{\circ}46.98^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ i n $1031\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figure F12). The site is situated on seismi c Line RR1313-WP7-2 (Rosenthal et al., 2016), ${\sim}900\mathrm{~m~}$ southwest o f the crosspoint with seismic Line RR1313-WP7-5 and ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{km}$ eas t of the location of piston Core RR1313 PC32. The ${\sim}7~\mathrm{m}$ piston cor e and a companion gravity core from this site are characterized by  a mixture of clay and volcanic sand with relatively high numbers o f planktonic and benthic foraminifers in excellent state of preservation. Preliminary isotope analysis of planktonic foraminifers fro m the cores indicates $>\!6\;\mathrm{m}$ of Holocene sediment, implying sedimentation rates $>\!60\,\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ . The multichannel seismic (MCS) surve y shows ${>}650~\mathrm{m}$ sediment coverage at this site. The MCS profiles exhibit remarkable uniformity of acoustic stratification, indicating  a succession of alternating clay-, silt-, and sand-dominated beds dow n to 0.28 s TWT below the surface with an estimated depth of 22 5 mbsf, our target drilling depth. Below this depth, the MCS profile s suggest a disturbed zone. We also note a possible disturbed interva l between 0.14 and 0.16 s TWT below the seafloor (Rosenthal et al., 2016).

Figure F12. Northern margin of Papua New Guinea (red box in Figure F3) showing the location of Sites U1484–U1487 (yellow circles). Sites U1484 and U148 5 are located ${\sim}15$ and ${\sim}19\,\mathsf{k m}$ offshore Papua New Guinea, respectively. Contour interval $=500\;\mathrm{m}$ . Data source: Amante and Eakins (2009).  

Site U1484 is located in a tectonically complex region east of th e Cyclops Mountains and west of the Sepik/Ramu River mouths. Th e region is bounded to the south by the Bewani-Torricelli fault zon e on land, which links to offshore transform faults that eventuall y connect with a seafloor spreading zone(?) along the Bismarck Se a seismic lineation to the east (Baldwin et al., 2012). Northwest of th e site, the southward subduction of the Caroline microplate forms th e New Guinea Trench. The continental shelf in this region is exceedingly narrow $\left(<2\;\mathrm{km}\right)$ , allowing large amounts of terrigenous sediment discharge from coastal rivers to bypass the narrow continenta l shelf and accumulate in deeper water (Milliman et al., 1999).  

The climatology and oceanography of northern Papua Ne w Guinea is strongly influenced by the seasonal migration of th e ITCZ, with enhanced precipitation during boreal winter (Figur e F2A, F2B). Interannually, precipitation decreases during El Niñ o events (Figure F2C, F2D). Monsoon winds control the surface hydrography of the region such that the NGCC flows westward ove r the drill sites during the boreal summer southeasterly monsoo n (also referred to as the austral summer monsoon in the Souther n Hemisphere) (Kuroda, 2000). These currents distribute sediment s originating from the Sepik/Ramu River mouths and multitudes o f other tributaries along the coast over the northern slopes of Papu a New Guinea and adjacent deep basins. The surface current reverse s during the boreal winter northwesterly monsoon (Kuroda, 2000), and the surface sediment plume from the Sepik/Ramu River mouth s is observed to meander out across the Bismarck Sea (Steinberg e t al., 2006). In contrast, the NGCU persists in a westward directio n year round at a water depth of ${\sim}220\;\mathrm{m},$ , widening and strengthenin g during boreal summer (Kuroda, 2000). This undercurrent supplie s terrigenous sediments from the near-bottom river plumes to th e drill sites. At ${\sim}1000\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the sediment is bathed in AIW.  

The high sedimentation rate at Site U1484 provides the potential to resolve late middle to late Pleistocene centennial- to millennial-scale climate variability in the WPWP. Comparing these highresolution records with comparable ones for the North Atlantic an d eastern equatorial Pacific will allow us to better constrain the mechanisms influencing millennial-scale variability. This site will als o provide insights on orbital-scale variability during the late middle t o late Pleistocene. Finally, Site U1484 will allow us to examine th e southern Pacific contribution to the ITF.  

# Operations  

After a $2097\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1483, which was complete d in 7.5 days at an average speed of $11.6~\mathrm{kt}$ , the vessel stabilized ove r Site U1484 at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 November 2016. We cored three holes a t Site U1484 in accordance with the original operations plan that included coring with the APC system to 225 mbsf in three holes (Table T1).  

Hole U1484A was cored to 195.0 mbsf with the APC system using core orientation and nonmagnetic hardware (Cores 363- U1484A-1H through 21H). We had poor recovery within an interva l of sand from ${\sim}110$ to 130 mbsf. After encountering APC refusal, w e switched to the HLAPC system and continued coring to 223.2 mbs f (Cores 22F through 27F), where we terminated the hole. Downhol e temperature measurements using the APCT-3 were taken on Core s 4H (37.1 mbsf), 7H (65.6 mbsf), 10H (94.1 mbsf), 13H (122.6 mbsf), and 16H (147.5 mbsf), and reliable results were obtained on three o f the five deployments. A total of $220.60\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was recovere d over $223.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(99\%)$ in Hole U1484A.  

After encountering sand between ${\sim}110$ and 130 mbsf in Hol e U1484A, we altered the operations plan for the remaining holes t o include using the HLAPC system over that interval to improve recovery. Hole U1484B was cored with the APC system using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware to 104.8 mbsf (Cores 363-U1484B1H through 12H), including one $2~\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval to offset cor e gaps for stratigraphic correlation. We then switched to the HLAP C system and continued coring to 133.0 mbsf (Cores 13F throug h 18F), which allowed us to better recover the sand found throug h that interval (recovery of $88\%$ in Hole U1484B compared with $57\%$ in Hole U1484A). We then switched back to the APC system an d cored to 190 mbsf (Core 19H) using orientation. The remainder o f Hole U1484B was cored with the HLAPC system to 222.9 mbs f (Cores 25F through 31F) after encountering APC refusal with Cor e 24H. We recovered $220.51\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $220.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $100\%$ recovery) in Hole U1484B.  

Oriented APC coring with nonmagnetic hardware continued i n Hole U1484C to 106.1 mbsf (Cores 363-U1484C-1H through 12H). We then switched to the HLAPC system and cored to $145.7~\mathrm{mbsf}$ (Cores 13F through 21F) to recover the sand interval. One drille d interval $\left(2\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ advanced the hole without coring to avoid alignmen t of core gaps for stratigraphic correlation. We then switched back t o the APC system and cored to 193.2 mbsf (Cores 22H through 26H). After encountering APC refusal, we finished coring the hole t o 221.4 mbsf (Cores 27F through 32F) using the HLAPC. A total o f $225.46~\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered over $219.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(103\%)$ . Operations at Site U1484 ended at $0945\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 November. Total tim e spent at the site was $83.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.5 days).  

A total of 55 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $515.91\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $508.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $(101.5\%)$ . We als o collected 33 HLAPC cores, recovering $150.66\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment ove r $155.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of penetration $(97.1\%)$ . Overall recovery at Site U1484 wa s $666.57\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $663.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(100.5\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

The sediment cored at Site U1484 is assigned to a single lithologic unit composed of ${\sim}224\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of middle Pleistocene to recen t terrigenous and hemipelagic sediment (Figure F13). Lithologic Uni t I is composed of three main components: dark greenish gray clay, silt, and sand. The relative abundances of clay and silt vary downhole. Subordinate amounts of nannofossils and foraminifers ar e mixed with the terrigenous sediment, and fine-grained intervals alternate with discrete layers of sand- and silt-sized sediment. Th e upper ${\sim}10$ mbsf is characterized by decimeter- to meter-thick cla y layers with variable amounts of silt and a few thin (centimeter t o decimeter) sand layers. From ${\sim}10$ to $150~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , the abundance an d thickness of sand layers increases downhole. Clay is more abundan t between $\mathord{\sim}150$ and $175\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , whereas in the deepest part of the succession, sand and clay layers are present in subequal proportions. The amount of clay and nannofossils in the sand layers is negligible; however, large benthic foraminifers are present within some of th e coarser sand layers. Sulfide patches and sponge spicules are foun d in clay-rich intervals, whereas wood and shell fragments are mor e common in sand layers. The sand layers typically have sharp base s and show both normal and reverse grading. The sand-sized material at Site U1484 consists of four main components: minerals (feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, and chlorite), volcanic and plutonic rock fragments, mineraloids (pyritized glauconite), and biogenic particle s (foraminifers). Several discrete tephra layers up to $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick ar e present in the succession.

The sediment succession at Site U1484 contains well-preserve d calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers. Calcareous nannofossils are not as abundant as they are a t Sites U1482 and U1483, but benthic foraminifers are more common, with planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratios reaching 70:30 between ${\sim}60$ and $150\,\mathrm{\mbsf.}$ The benthic foraminifer assemblage s change downhole. Deeper water species are present in the uppe r and lower parts of the succession, whereas the middle sections include mixed deeper and shallow-water benthic foraminifers, including some reef-dwelling forms.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicates that Hole U1484A spans the late middle Pleistocene to recent (Figure F14). The upper $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf of the successio n is within Zone NN21 (late middle Pleistocene to recent), identifie d by the biohorizon base $E_{\mathrm{{*}}}$ . huxleyi $\left(0.29\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ between $\mathord{\sim}195$ and 20 0 mbsf. The absence of $G.$ . tosaensis (the marker for Subzone Pt1a) assigns the entire section recovered at Hole U1484A to Subzone Pt1 b $(<\!0.61\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , and the absence of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa indicate s that the base of the succession is within Zone NN20 $\left(0.44{-}0.29\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ (Figure F13). The middle/late Pleistocene boundary $(0.126\mathrm{\Ma})$ i s located between the biohorizons top acme Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica $(0.28\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and top $G.$ . ruber (pink) $\left(0.12\,M\mathrm{a}\right)$ at ${\sim}100$ mbsf. Average estimated linear sedimentation rates based on calcareou s nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer bioevents were ${\sim}75~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F14).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1484 involved measuring the NRM of archive halves from all holes before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $10{-}15~\mathrm{mT}$ . Forty-seven $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ discrete samples were taken to investigate paleomagnetic carriers and roc k magnetic properties. Discrete magnetic susceptibility, IRM, an d IRM ratios indicate relatively high ferrimagnetic mineral concentrations, and despite observations of pyrite in the lower part of th e three holes, sediment diagenesis has had relatively little effect o n the primary magnetic assemblage.  

Sediment in all three holes appears to have been deposite d (quasi-)continuously with no major hiatuses. Azimuthally correcte d declination from APC cores in all holes is internally consistent between adjacent cores, although it maintains an $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ baseline offse t in absolute values because declination should cluster around $0^{\circ}$ during periods of normal polarity. Inclination plots around, o r slightly steeper than (owing to a pervasive overprint), expected values of about $-6^{\circ}$ for the site latitude assuming a GAD field. Thes e observations are consistent with all the sediment recovered at Sit e U1484 being deposited during the Brunhes (C1n), ${<}0.781$ Ma (Figure F13). These findings are consistent with biostratigraphic datums that suggest that the sediment at the base of Site U1484 i s between 0.29 and 0.44 Ma in age.  

Physical properties, including short-term, decimeter-scale variability, correlate well with the alternating clay and silty sand lithologies found at Site U1484. Because of the high sedimentation rates, the effect of increased compaction with depth is only minor at thi s site. GRA bulk density increases rapidly from 1.5 to $1.75\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ fro m the seafloor to ${\sim}12$ mbsf and then gradually increases to ${\sim}1.8\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the bottom of the hole. GRA bulk density probably underestimates the true bulk density compared with discrete MAD bulk density, particularly in the sand layers. This underestimation may b e due to significant gas-induced expansion in the sand-rich layers. The high bulk and grain densities additionally correspond to lo w carbonate content values $({\sim}2{-}3\ \mathrm{wt}\%)$ and low TOC content $\left(0.1-\right.$ $0.2\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) (Figure F13). Magnetic susceptibility ranges from $50\times10^{-5}$ to $>\!1200\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ , with lower values corresponding to clay-rich intervals. NGR counts range between ${\sim}10$ and 30 counts/s, with lowe r values corresponding to sand intervals (Figure F13). In all holes, 1 2 distinct $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m}$ cycles are observed in GRA bulk density, NGR, and especially magnetic susceptibility, which broadly reflect alternations between clay-rich and silty sand-rich layers. Downhole temperature  measurements  made  with  the  APCT-3  indicate   a geothermal gradient of $40^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ .

Figure F14. Age-depth plot for calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons, Site U1484. Dashed line shows the mean long-term sedimentation rate. The age at the bottom of Hole U1484A is estimated to be 0.29 Ma based on the average linear sedimentation rate of $75\,{\mathsf{c m}}/{\mathsf{k y}}$ .  

For Site U1484, we constructed a splice for the entire site usin g all three holes, but there are gaps in the splice mainly because of incomplete recovery of sand intervals. Gas expansion frequentl y caused extrusion of sediment out of the top and bottom of the cor e liner and onto the rig floor, resulting in disturbed sediment, especially in the top and bottom sections of each core, as well as void s throughout the recovered sequence. These factors resulted in relatively high growth factors and made it difficult to correlate data between holes. Tie points were established mainly with WRMS L magnetic susceptibility data supplemented with NGR data. Th e splice is continuous from 0 to $133.98\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. Below this depth, from 133.98 to $153.85\:\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CCSF}}_{}$ , there are at least three core gaps an d some tentative tie points. This interval is underlain by an interva l from 153.85 to $270.85\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF that is continuous except for on e core gap at $172.55{-}175.28\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. The deepest interval, fro m 270.85 to $284.61\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ , has a few core gaps. In sum, althoug h there were some intervals with discontinuous recovery, we calculated offsets for all cores in all three holes and constructed a nearl y continuous splice that has a few gaps.  

A total of 24 interstitial water samples (23 whole-round sample s and 1 mudline sample) were analyzed from Hole U1484A from th e seafloor to $222.4~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . The interstitial water geochemistry reflect s early diagenetic processes driven by remineralization of organi c matter. The TOC content ranges between ${\sim}0.1$ and $1.8\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ (averag e $=\,0.88\,\mathrm{\,wt\%}$ ) (Figure F13). The TOC/total nitrogen (TN) ratios i n most samples are $^{<10}$ , suggesting that organic matter deposited a t Site U1484 is largely of marine origin. Correlations between th e downhole profiles of TOC and TN contents suggest that the majority of the nitrogen is organic-bound, with little preferential degradation between organic carbon and nitrogen; however, caution shoul d be taken when interpreting the TOC and $C/\Nu$ records because shipboard TOC values are calculated by the subtraction method. Carbonate content at this site is low, ranging from ${\sim}2$ to $15\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figur e F13).  

Rapid progression through suboxic and anoxic organic matte r remineralization in the upper portion of the sediment is indicate d by enrichments of dissolved Mn and Fe at ${\sim}3$ mbsf and an abrup t increase in methane and near-complete depletion of dissolved $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ (the SMTZ) at $\mathord{\sim}20$ mbsf. The dissolved $\mathrm{Ca}$ concentration at th e SMTZ is relatively low $\left({\sim}2\ m M\right)$ , suggesting that active carbonat e precipitation takes place at this depth, possibly as authigenic aragonite, as supported by a concomitant drop in Sr concentration. Belo w the SMTZ, hydrocarbon gas is characterized by very high methane/ethane ratios, which suggests that the methane is mostly of biogenic origin.  

A striking feature of interstitial water geochemistry at Sit e U1484 is the large increase of alkalinity (up to $50\,\mathrm{mM}$ ) from the seafloor to between ${\sim}40$ and 50 mbsf. This alkalinity peak is accompanied by enrichments in dissolved $\mathbf{Mg},\,\mathbf{K},$ and $\mathrm{Na}$ , suggesting partia l dissolution of silicate minerals occurred within this interval. At Sit e U1484, this process, termed anoxic silicate weathering (Wallman n et al., 2008), is most likely driven by the presence of substantia l amounts of easily alterable fresh volcanogenic material derive d from the nearby Papua New Guinea highlands. This process typically represents a net sink for carbon dioxide in methanogenic sediment, which releases $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{}^{-}$ , dissolved cations, and Si into th e interstitial water. It may also lead to formation of secondary cla y minerals (e.g., smectite) in the sediment, which at Site U1484 coul d possibly explain some of the observed decrease of dissolved $\mathrm{Mg}$ deeper than 50 mbsf. The comparatively low dissolved Fe concentration throughout Hole U1484A (except for the upper $10~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) may be explained by significant formation of pyrite within the sediment column.  

# Site U1485  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1485 (proposed Site WP-72A) is located ${\sim}19~\mathrm{km}$ off th e northern coast of Papua New Guinea at $03^{\circ}06.16^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $142^{\circ}47.59\mathrm{\,E}$ i n $1145\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figure F12). The site is situated on seismi c Line RR1313-WP7-2, ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{km}$ northeast of the cross point with seismic Line RR1313-WP7-5 (Rosenthal et al., 2016) and ${\sim}3.2\ \mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of Site U1484. An ${\sim}7~\mathrm{m}$ piston core and a companion gravity core retrieved ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{km}$ to the southwest of the site locatio n are characterized by a mixture of clay and volcanic sand with relatively high numbers of planktonic and benthic foraminifers in excellent state of preservation. Preliminary isotope analysis of planktoni c foraminifers from the cores indicates $>\!6\textrm{m}$ of Holocene sediment, implying sedimentation rates $>\!60\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . The multichannel seismi c profiles exhibit remarkable uniformity of acoustic stratification indicating a succession of alternating clay-, silt-, and sand-dominate d beds down to $_{0.4\textbf{s}}$ TWT below the seafloor surface, with an estimated depth of 350 mbsf, just deeper than our target drilling dept h of 325 mbsf. There is evidence for a disturbed layer between 0.1 6 and $_{0.19\;s}$ TWT, but bedding is very uniform below this interval t o the target depth (Rosenthal et al., 2016). This site extends the recor d recovered at Site U1484.  

Site U1485 is located in a tectonically complex region east of th e Cyclops Mountains and west of the Sepik/Ramu River mouths. Th e region is bounded to the south by the Bewani-Torricelli fault zon e on land, which links to offshore transform faults that eventuall y connect with a zone of seafloor spreading along the Bismarck Se a seismic lineation to the east (Baldwin et al., 2012). Northwest of th e site, the southward subduction of the Caroline microplate forms th e New Guinea Trench. The continental shelf in this region is exceedingly narrow $\left(<2\;\mathrm{km}\right)$ , allowing large amounts of terrigenous sediment discharge from coastal rivers to bypass the narrow continenta l shelf and accumulate in deeper water (Milliman et al., 1999).  

The climatology and oceanography of northern Papua Ne w Guinea is strongly influenced by the seasonal migration of th e ITCZ, with enhanced precipitation during boreal winter (Figur e F2A, F2B). Interannually, precipitation decreases during El Niñ o events (Figure F2C, F2D). Monsoon winds control the surface hydrography of the region, such that the NGCC flows westward ove r the drill sites during the boreal summer southeasterly monsoo n (also referred to as the austral summer monsoon in the Souther n Hemisphere) (Kuroda, 2000). These currents distribute sediment s originating from the Sepik/Ramu River mouths and multitudes o f other tributaries along the coast over the northern slopes of Papu a New Guinea and adjacent deep basins. The surface current reverse s during the boreal winter northwesterly monsoon (Kuroda, 2000), and the surface sediment plume from the Sepik/Ramu River mouth s is observed to meander out across the Bismarck Sea (Steinberg e t al., 2006). In contrast, the NGCU persists in a westward directio n year round at a water depth of ${\sim}220\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{;}}$ , widening and strengthenin g during boreal summer (Kuroda, 2000). This undercurrent supplie s terrigenous sediments from the near-bottom river plumes to th e drill sites. At ${\sim}1000\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the sediment is bathed in AIW.  

The high sedimentation rates at Site U1485 provide the potential to resolve late middle to late Pleistocene centennial- to millennial-scale climate variability in the WPWP. Comparing these highresolution records with comparable ones for the North Atlantic an d eastern equatorial Pacific will us to better constrain the mechanisms influencing millennial-scale variability. This site will also provide insights on orbital-scale variability during the late middle t o late Pleistocene. Finally, Site U1485 will allow us to examine th e southern Pacific contribution to the ITF.  

# Operations  

After a $1.85\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit in dynamic positioning mode from Sit e U1484, the vessel stabilized over Site U1485 on 10 November 2016. The original operations plan at Site U1485 included three holes using the APC and HLAPC to 315 mbsf. We ultimately cored fou r holes (Table T1). Holes U1485A and U1485B were cored to $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf. Hole U1485C was terminated after three cores when it prove d unsuitable for covering core gaps for stratigraphic correlation. Hol e U1485D was cored to 63.9 mbsf to fill core gaps and intervals wher e significant numbers of interstitial water samples were taken fro m each core in Hole U1485A.  

Hole U1485A was cored to 188.0 mbsf with the APC using orientation  and  nonmagnetic  hardware  (Cores  363-U1485A-1 H through 20H). After pumping Core 20H out of the core barrel, w e switched to the HLAPC and continued coring to 300.8 mbsf (Core s 21F through 44F), where we encountered a partial stroke, indicatin g HLAPC refusal. Because we had reached our age target, we decide d not to deepen the hole further using the XCB coring system. As Sit e U1485 is located only ${\sim}3.2~\mathrm{km}$ from Site U1484, we opted not t o take downhole temperature measurements. Whole-round sample s for high-resolution interstitial water analyses were taken at a frequency of one per section in the upper ${\sim}54$ mbsf of Hole U1485A.  A total of $312.36\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was recovered over $300.8~\mathrm{m}$ of corin g $104\%$ recovery) in Hole U1485A.  

Because core recovery was generally good in the upper 19 0 mbsf, we opted not to switch to the HLAPC over the interval wit h higher sand content that had resulted in poor recovery with the fulllength APC at Site U1484. Hole U1485B was cored to $173.5~\mathrm{mbsf}$ (Cores 363-U1485B-1H through 20H) using the APC with orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. We then switched to the HLAP C and continued coring to 297.7 mbsf (Cores 21F through 47F), wit h one $2\,\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval to offset core gaps for stratigraphic correlation. We recovered $291.18\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $295.7\ \mathrm{m}$ of coring $98\%$ recovery) in Hole U1485B.  

Oriented APC coring with nonmagnetic hardware then continued in Hole U1485C; however, after data collected for stratigraphi c correlation indicated that Core 363-U1485C-2H was a copy of Cor e 1H, we terminated the hole. Hole U1485C was cored to 27.5 mbs f (Cores 1H through 3H) and recovered $29.35\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment ( $107\%$ recovery). Hole U1485D was cored specifically to contribute material to the stratigraphic splice, particularly over the interval of highresolution interstitial water sampling shallower than 55 mbsf. Oriented APC coring with nonmagnetic hardware penetrated to 63. 9 mbsf (Cores 363-U1485D-1H through 8H), with one $^{1\,}\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval to cover a core gap. A total of $68.22~\mathrm{m}$ of core was collecte d over $62.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of coring ( $108\%$ recovery). Operations at Site U148 5 ended at $2330~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 November. Total time spent at the site wa s $85.8\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.6 days).

A total of 50 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $452.28\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $451.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.100.1\%$ recovery). W e also collected 50 HLAPC cores, recovering $248.73\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t over $235\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $105.9\%$ recovery). Total core collected at Sit e U1485 was $701.11\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over $686.9\mathrm{~m~}$ of coring $(102.1\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

An ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{~m~}$ succession was recovered in four holes at Sit e U1485. The upper ${\sim}225$ mbsf shares some similarities with th e stratigraphy and lithologies observed at Site U1484, which is locate d only ${\sim}3.2\ \mathrm{km}$ south-southwest of the site. The sediment at Sit e U1485 is assigned to a single lithologic unit composed of ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ o f middle Pleistocene to recent terrigenous and hemipelagic sedimen t (Figure F15). Lithologic Unit I is divided into two subunits. Subuni t  

IA is an ${\sim}216\;\mathrm{m}$ sequence of middle Pleistocene to recent sedimen t composed of three main components (dark greenish gray clay, silt , and sand) that is equivalent to Unit I at Site U1484. The relativ e abundances of these terrigenous components vary downhole. Subordinate amounts of nannofossils and foraminifers are mixed wit h the terrigenous sediment, and fine-grained intervals alternate wit h discrete layers of sand- and silt-sized sediment. As at Site U1484, the upper ${\sim}8$ mbsf is characterized by thick (decimeter to meter ) clay layers with variable amounts of silt and several centimeter- t o decimeter-thick sand layers. From ${\sim}8$ to 127 mbsf, coarser graine d material becomes more abundant, with the frequency and thicknes s of sand layers increasing downhole, although clay-rich intervals ar e still present over this interval. Two thick sand intervals occur between ${\sim}127$ and 165 mbsf, separated by $\mathsf{a}\,6\,\mathsf{m}$ thick interval of hemipelagic clay. From $\mathord{\sim}165$ to 216 mbsf, the sediment consists of cla y with variable amounts of silt and nannofossils, interbedded wit h thinner sand layers. Shallow-water benthic foraminifers are less frequent in the sand layers at this site compared to Site U1484, wherea s shell and wood fragments are common. The sand layers typicall y have sharp bases and show both normal and reverse grading. Th e sand-size material at Site U1485 consists of four main components: minerals (feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, and chlorite), volcanic an d plutonic rock fragments, mineraloids (pyritized glauconite), an d biogenic particles (foraminifers). Sulfide patches are also present, with pyrite occurring frequently deeper than $\mathord{\sim}165$ mbsf. Subunit I B is an ${\sim}85\mathrm{~m~}$ succession dominated by dark gray clay with variabl e amounts of silt and nannofossils. The absence of coarse sand layer s distinguishes this subunit from Subunit IA. A nannofossil-rich cla y layer from ${\sim}226$ to 240 mbsf has higher carbonate content than th e rest of the succession (Figure F15). A number of discrete tephra layers up to $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick are present throughout the succession at Sit e U1485.

Figure F16. Age-depth plot for calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons, Site U1485. Dashed line shows the mean long-term sedimentation rate of ${\sim}62.5\,\mathsf{c m/k y}$ . The age at the bottom of Hole U1485A is constrained between 0.44 and 0.60 Ma and is estimated as $>\!0.50$ Ma based on the nannofossil evidence.  

The succession at Site U1485 contains well-preserved calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifers. The calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer assemblage s are very similar to those at Site U1484; however, the benthic foraminifer assemblages show less influence from downslope transport. The planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratios are consistently aroun d 99:1 (compared with 70:30 at Site U1484). Only a few intervals contain  the  shallow-water  taxon  Rotalinoides  compressiusculus, whereas the bulk of the assemblage is dominated by typical bathya l forms.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicates that Hole U1485A spans the late middle Pleistocene to recent (Figure F16). The upper $\mathord{\sim}183$ mbsf of the successio n is within Zone NN21 (late middle to late Pleistocene), identified b y the biohorizon base $E_{i}$ . huxleyi $(0.29\mathrm{~Ma})$ between $\mathord{\sim}179$ and 18 6 mbsf. From $\mathord{\sim}183$ to 255 mbsf, the sequence is assigned to Zon e NN20 based on the absence of $E$ . huxleyi and $P_{\star}$ lacunosa. The biohorizon top $P\!\!\!\!/$ lacunosa $\left(0.44\mathrm{\Ma}\right)$ , found between ${\sim}254$ and 25 7 mbsf, indicates the top of Zone NN19. The remainder of the core d succession to 300 mbsf is assigned to the upper part of Zone NN1 9 (middle Pleistocene). The absence of $G.$ . tosaensis (the marker fo r Subzone Pt1a) assigns the entire section recovered at Hole U1485 A to Subzone Pt1b $(<\!0.61\,M{\bf a})$ (Figure F15). Together, nannofossil an d planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicates an age betwee n 0.61 and $0.44\;\mathrm{Ma}$ for the bottom of the succession at Hole U1485A. The middle/late Pleistocene boundary $(0.126\,\mathrm{\OmegaMa})$ is located between the biohorizons top acme $G.$ caribbeanica $\left(0.28\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and to p G. ruber (pink) $(0.12\,\mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}84$ mbsf. Sedimentation rates based o n calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer bioevents wer e ${\sim}62.5\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F16).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1485 involved measurement of the NRM of archive halves from all holes before and afte r demagnetization in a peak AF of $10\;\mathrm{~mT~}$ (Holes U1485A an d U1485D) and $15~\mathrm{mT}$ (Holes U1485B and U1485C). Sixty-three  7 $\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ discrete samples were also taken to investigate paleomagneti c carriers and rock magnetic properties. Discrete magnetic susceptibility, IRM, and IRM ratios indicate relatively high ferrimagneti c mineral concentrations in sediment shallower than $\mathord{\sim}180$ mbsf. Deeper than ${\sim}180~\mathrm{mbsf},$ magnetic susceptibility and IRM decreas e to relatively low values, and ferrimagnetic grain size is distinctl y coarser deeper than ${\sim}240$ mbsf. This interval was not cored at Sit e U1484 and is coincident with the occurrence of extensive pyrite i n the recovered sediment that may be related to alteration of the pri  

mary magnetic assemblage at depth (e.g., Karlin and Levi, 1983;   
Rowan et al., 2009).  

Sediment in all three holes appears to have been deposite d (quasi-)continuously with no major hiatuses. Azimuthally correcte d declination is internally consistent between adjacent cores, although it maintains an $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ baseline offset in absolute values because declination should cluster around $0^{\circ}$ during periods of norma l polarity. Corrected declination of Hole U1485A varies by ${\sim}30^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ}$ between adjacent cores. This between-core variability is not observed in the other holes at Site U1485, so it is likely these offset s result from incorrect correction from the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool. The specific tool used (Icefield $\#2007]$ ) generated a similar issue at Hole U1483C, and we concluded this to be a toolspecific issue. This tool was not used for the remainder of the expedition. Inclination plots around or slightly steeper than (owing to  a pervasive overprint) expected values of about $-6^{\circ}$ for the site latitude assuming a GAD field. These observations are consistent wit h all sediment recovered at Site U1485 being deposited during th e Brunhes (C1n), ${<}0.781$ Ma (Figure F15). These findings are i n agreement with biostratigraphic datums that suggest that the bas e of Site U1485 is between 0.61 and $0.44\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F16).  

Physical properties correlate well with the alternating clay an d silty sand lithologies at Site U1485 over both short and longe r scales. Because of the high sedimentation rates, the effect of increased compaction with depth is minimal. GRA bulk density an d magnetic susceptibility are particularly sensitive to variations in cla y and sand content, recording high-frequency variations. GRA bul k density increases rapidly from 1.5 to $1.65~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ between the seafloor and ${\sim}10$ mbsf. From ${\sim}10$ to 135 mbsf, GRA bulk density displays $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m}$ cycles with values ranging from 1.4 to $1.85~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Below 185 mbsf, variability in GRA bulk density decreases significantly, ranging between 1.35 and $1.5\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , which reflects the dominance of clay. Over most of the record, GRA bulk density an d magnetic susceptibility covary. Magnetic susceptibility is generall y lower in clay-rich intervals and shows more variability and highe r values in silt- and sand-rich intervals (Figure F15). Magnetic susceptibility values are consistently low from 0 to 10 mbsf $\langle{\sim}150~\times$ $10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ ). Below this, magnetic susceptibility shows $10{-}15\ \mathrm{m}$ scal e cyclicity similar to the GRA bulk density record, with values rangin g from $50\times10^{-5}$ to $>\!1200\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ . In the clay-rich Subunit IB, magnetic susceptibility is significantly lower and shows less variability, averaging $\sim\!100\times10^{-5}$ SI. NGR counts range between ${\sim}10$ and 4 0 counts/s, with the lower values corresponding to sand interval s (Figure F15). The NGR record also exhibits $10{-}15\;\mathrm{m}$ scale cyclicity, particularly in the interval from ${\sim}10$ to 135 mbsf.  

For Site U1485, we constructed a splice for the entire site usin g three holes (U1485A, U1485B, and U1485D), but there are gaps i n the splice mainly because of incomplete recovery of sand intervals. Hole U1485C was not used for construction of the splice because the second core appears to repeat the section recovered in the firs t core, which resulted in termination of coring after only three cores. Gas expansion frequently caused extrusion of sediment out of th e top and bottom of the core liner and onto the rig floor, resulting i n disturbed sediment, especially in the top and bottom sections o f each core, as well as voids throughout the recovered sequence. Ti e points were established mainly with WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data supplemented with NGR data. The splice is continuous an d well constrained from 0 to $157.41\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF. Reduced core recover y in the relatively sand rich interval from 157.41 to $222.11\mathrm{~m~}$ CCS F and gaps aligned between HLAPC cores of adjacent holes fro m 222.11 to $267.34\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF resulted in a discontinuous splice over thi s interval. From $267.34\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF to the bottom of the cored section a t $373.35\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, the splice is tentative due to voids caused by ga s expansion, low-amplitude magnetic susceptibility values, and lowresolution NGR counts used to establish correlations.  

A total of 60 whole-round samples and one mudline sampl e were collected from the seafloor to 295 mbsf in Hole U1485A. Thirty-six samples were analyzed on the ship, whereas the remaining samples were fixed for shore-based analyses. The interstitial water geochemical profiles at Site U1485 closely resemble thos e obtained at nearby Site U1484. Near-complete consumption of dissolved $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ was observed at ${\sim}12$ mbsf, coincident with an abrupt increase of methane at the SMTZ. Below the SMTZ, most samples ar e characterized by high methane/ethane ratios, suggesting that th e methane is mostly of biogenic origin. The TOC content at Sit e U1485 is slightly higher than at Site U1484, ranging from ${\sim}0.3$ to 1. 2 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F15). The TOC/TN ratios are usually $^{<10}$ , suggestin g that the organic matter deposited at Site U1485 is largely of marin e origin; however, caution should be taken when interpreting th e TOC and C/N records because shipboard TOC values are calculated by the subtraction method.  

As at Site U1484, Site U1485 displays evidence for anoxic silicat e weathering occurring within the methanogenic zone, as inferre d from marked enrichments of alkalinity (up to $50\,\mathrm{mM})$ ), $\mathsf{K}\left(13.5\,\mathrm{mM}\right)$ , and Mg $50\;\mathrm{mM})$ between $\mathord{\sim}20$ and 120 mbsf. Similarly, the carbonate content of Site U1485 is generally low, ranging from to 0.7 t o $27.0~\mathrm{wt\%}$ with an average of $9.0~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F15). Penetration t o deeper depths at Site U1485 $\left(300\ \mathrm{mbsf}\right)$ ) than at Site U1484 (22 3 mbsf) provides more insights into the sediment-water interaction s that occur deeper in the sedimentary sequence at the Papua Ne w Guinea margin. A notable feature is the pronounced downhole depletion observed for several elements (Mg, K, B, and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}.$ ) alon g with decreases in alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ from ${\sim}50$ to 120 mbsf. In agreement with results from previous investigations (Michalopoulos an d Aller, 1995; Wallmann et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2016), these finding s are consistent with secondary clay authigenesis (reverse weathering), a process that releases CO and leads to removal of major cations/anions from interstitial water.  

Finally, abrupt changes in concentration or slope are observed i n interstitial water profiles of several elements (e.g., K, Mg, Na, Br, and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}.$ ) coincident with changes in lithology. These changes i n lithology likely act as diffusive caps, interrupting communication i n interstitial water between the sediment above and below these distinct lithologic changes, thereby imparting slight variations in concentration that overprint the general trends dominated by anoxi c sediment weathering and clay mineral authigenesis.  

# Site U1486  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1486 (proposed Site WP-05A) is located ${\sim}215~\mathrm{km}$ westsouthwest of Manus Island at $02^{\circ}22.34^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $144^{\circ}36.08^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in $1332\,\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F12). The seismic profile shows a continuous succession of hemipelagic sediment with acoustic basement estimate d at ${\sim}225$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016). This site was targeted to recover a complete Pleistocene record with unprecedented resolutio n for the WPWP.  

The tectonic setting of Sites U1486 and U1487 (similar to that o f the northern Papua New Guinea Sites U1484 and U1485) wa s shaped by the oblique northward movement of the Australian plat e as it rapidly converged with the Pacific plate. This collision resulte d in a complex plate boundary zone that includes volcanic arcs bu t also resulted in the formation and rotation of microplates withi n this zone, as well as lithospheric rupture that formed small oceani c basins (Baldwin et al., 2012). The Bismarck Sea, on the northeaster n side of Papua New Guinea (Figure F12), forms a back-arc basin wit h respect to the New Britain arc and is divided into the North Bismarck (NBS) and South Bismarck (SBS) microplates, separated b y the active Bismarck Sea left-lateral transform fault and spreadin g segments (Taylor, 1979). Site U1486 is located on the NBS microplate. To the north, the NBS microplate is bordered by the Manu s Trench, which defines the boundary between it and the Pacifi c plate. Within this complex tectonic regime, the southwestern side o f the Manus Basin is considered one of the more stable regions. Magnetic anomalies in the Bismarck Sea indicate rapid asymmetri c spreading since $3.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Taylor, 1979). The continuous collision between the Australian and Pacific plates causes the SBS microplate t o rotate rapidly clockwise $({\sim}9^{\circ}/\mathrm{My})$ , whereas the NBS microplate i s rotating slowly anticlockwise $(0.3{-}1.25^{\circ}/\ensuremath{\mathrm{My}})$ (Baldwin et al., 2012). Asymmetric rotation of the North and South Bismarck Basins likel y changed the position of New Britain and adjacent islands relative t o Papua New Guinea. ODP Leg 193 focused on the eastern part of th e Manus Basin, exploring the tectonic, volcanic, and seafloor hydrothermal system activity in this convergent plate margin setting.  

An isotope record from piston Core MD05-2920 located nea r Site U1486 indicates a sedimentation rate of ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm/ky},$ substantially higher than that found in other open-ocean Pacific sites, wit h no discernible disturbance for the past ${\sim}400~\mathrm{ky}$ (Tachikawa et al., 2011, 2013). The moderately high $C a C O_{3}$ content $(25\mathrm{-}45\mathrm{\wt\%})$ ) an d well-preserved foraminifer tests suggest the potential to generate  a suborbitally resolved paleoceanographic record of unprecedente d quality through the Pleistocene. X-ray fluorescence scanning o f Core MD05-2920 demonstrates that centennial precipitation variability can be resolved from the elemental content of the sedimen t (Tachikawa et al., 2011).  

This site was targeted because of its potential to provide an excellent Pleistocene paleoceanographic record to examine orbitalscale climate variability at high resolution through the Pleistocene. The site is ideally located to monitor the contribution from th e NGCC and NGCU to the ITF. The NGCC is the southern branch o f the westward, cross-equatorial flowing SEC and constitutes th e main southern Pacific contribution to the surface transport of th e ITF. At ${\sim}1300~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , this site is bathed by UCDW originating fro m the Southern Ocean (Figure F5B) and thus will allow for the reconstruction of past variability of this water mass.  

# Operations  

After a $117\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1485, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1486 at 0921 h on 14 November 2016. The original operations plan included three holes using the APC to 200 mbsf. We ultimately cored four holes (Table T1). Hole U1486A consisted of  a single full core and was terminated because it did not recover th e mudline. Holes U1486B and U1486C were cored to 211.2 and 201. 3 mbsf, respectively. Hole U1486D was cored to 186.5 mbsf to fill coring gaps and intervals where significant numbers of interstitial water samples were taken from Hole U1486B for construction of th e composite section.  

Hole U1486A was cored to 9.5 mbsf with the APC using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. When Core 363-U1486A-1H retrieved a full core liner, indicating that we missed the mudline, w e terminated coring in this hole. A total of $9.95\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment wa s recovered over $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $105\%$ recovery) in Hole U1486A.  

Hole U1486B was cored to 211.2 mbsf (Cores 363-U1486B-1 H through 23H) using the APC with orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. Downhole formation temperature measurements usin g the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H $\mathrm{(34.5\mbsf)}$ ), 7H $(63.0\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ , 10H (91.5 mbsf), and 13H (120.0 mbsf), obtaining good results o n all four deployments. Whole-round samples for high-resolution interstitial water analyses were taken at a frequency of one per sectio n in the upper 150 mbsf of Hole U1486B. Core 23H seemed to be  a full stroke; however, only $5.67\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered. When drilling out the “rathole,” drilling stalled at 211.2 mbsf, indicating something hard at that depth that the core barrel was unable to penetrate. Given that the acoustic basement at Site U1486 was estimated a t ${\sim}225$ mbsf, we speculate that we encountered the acoustic basement at a somewhat shallower depth. The presence of a few small basalt fragments in the core catcher of Core 23H supports this interpretation. We collected $215.49\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment over $211.2\textrm{m}$ o f coring ( $102\%$ recovery) in Hole U1486B.  

Hole U1486C was cored to 201.3 mbsf (Cores 363-U1486C-1 H through 23H) using the APC with orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. We decided to terminate coring above the hard layer encountered in Hole U1486B. Two drilled intervals (each $2\textrm{m}$ ) wer e used to advance the hole without recovery for stratigraphic correlation and one core (Core 11H) did not recover any material. We collected $172.70\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $197.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $88\%$ recovery ) in Hole U1486C.  

Hole U1486D was cored to 186.5 mbsf in order to fill gaps in th e composite stratigraphic section. Continuous coring penetrated t o 153.2 mbsf (Cores 363-U1486-1H through 16H) with the APC usin g orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. We then drilled ahea d without coring to 177 mbsf $23.8\;\mathrm{m}$ advance) to shoot Core 19H t o capture a paleomagnetic reversal that was recovered in Hol e U1486B but had fallen within a core gap in Hole U1486C. We collected $166.53\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $162.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $102\%$ recovery) i n Hole U1486D. Operations at Site U1486 ended at $1015\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November. Total time spent at Site U1486 was $73.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (3.0 d).  

A total of 63 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $564.67~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $580.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(97.2\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

Sediment at Site U1486 is composed of ${\sim}212~\mathrm{m}$ of upper Pliocene to recent volcanogenic sediment, biogenic sediment, an d authigenic minerals overlying presumed oceanic crust, which wa s not cored. The relative abundance of the volcanogenic and biogeni c components varies significantly downhole. We assign the recovere d succession to one lithologic unit divided into three subunits (Figur e F17). Subunit IA is an ${\sim}57\;\mathrm{m}$ sequence of mid-Pleistocene to recen t mainly greenish gray biogenic sediment (predominantly foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze) with clay minerals and rare ash layers. Biosilica is also present, usually in trace amounts, and consists o f radiolarians, diatoms, and silicoflagellates. Pteropod tests are als o found in the uppermost part of this subunit. The base of the subuni t is placed at the first downhole occurrence of a black tephra layer. Subunit IB ( $..85\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) consists mainly of lower Pleistocene biogenic (predominantly nannofossil) sediment mixed with volcanogenic materials, which occur both as dispersed particles and distinc t layers (tephra) and clay minerals. Foraminifers are present in varying abundances, as are radiolarians and diatoms, although they always constitute ${<}10\%$ of particles. This subunit is distinctly darke r than Subunit IA due to larger proportions of volcanogenic sediment. The dominant lithologies are greenish gray foraminifer-ric h nannofossil clay to dark greenish gray ash-rich nannofossil clay. Tephra layers are more abundant in Subunit IB and are typically felsic in composition. Pumice fragments are also present. The base o f Subunit IB is defined at a prominent black volcanic ash layer that i s marked by an increase in magnetic susceptibility; below this laye r the sediment is distinctly darker in color (Figure F17). Subunit I C $\cdot^{70}\,\mathrm{m}$ thick; late Pliocene to early Pleistocene) is dominated by th e volcanogenic component (ash), which occurs as discrete lamina e and layers ranging from a few centimeters to $>\!50\ \mathrm{cm}$ thick. Thes e layers show a variety of depositional styles and occur both interbedded and mixed with the biogenic and lithogenic sediment (primarily  foraminifer-rich  nannofossil  clay).  The  volcanogeni c sediment in Subunit IC is more mafic in composition and include s brown volcanic glass and scoria fragments. The bottom ${\sim}4\textrm{m}$ o f Subunit IC is permeated by authigenic zeolites of probable hydrothermal origin. Centimeter-size fragments of basalt with olivine an d pyroxene phenocrysts are also found in the bottom part of Subuni t IC.

The sediment succession at Site U1486 contains planktonic foraminifers, benthic foraminifers, and calcareous nannofossils tha t are generally excellently preserved, although some foraminifers ar e fragmented or show evidence of cementation or incipient recrystallization. There is no obvious change in preservation state wit h depth; instead, foraminifers in layers with higher proportions of volcanogenic material appear slightly better preserved than those i n the biogenic sediments. The benthic foraminifer assemblage is indicative of upper bathyal depths throughout the succession, wit h planktonic/benthic ratios around 99:1. Planulina wuellerstorfi i s present in most core catcher samples. The significant amount o f volcanic ash in the sediments below $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf does not significantly affect the composition of the foraminifer and calcareou s nannofossil assemblages.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biohorizons, together with magnetostratigraphic horizons, show good agreement (Figure F18). The base of the sedimentary sequence is assigned a late Pliocene age between 2.49 and $3.33\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , constrained b y the presence of Discoaster surculus (biohorizon top at $2.49\,\mathrm{Ma}_{\cdot}$ ) an d Globigerinoidesella fistulosa (biohorizon base at $3.33\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) in the absence of Globorotalia truncatulinoides (biohorizon base at 2.4 7 Ma). In the latest Pliocene and earliest Pleistocene, sedimentatio n rates were high, ${\sim}14~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . Extrapolation of these sedimentatio n rates yields an age of $2.7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ for the base of the recovered succession, which is consistent with the age range based on biohorizons. Sedimentation rates declined markedly through the middle to lat e Pleistocene to a long-term average of ${\sim}6\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . Based on these linear sedimentation rates, the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary (2.5 8 Ma) is placed at $\mathord{\sim}183$ mbsf, just below the base of Chron C2r.2 r $(2.581\,\mathrm{Ma})$ (Figure F17).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1486 involved measurement of the NRM of archive halves from all holes before and afte r demagnetization in a peak AF of $15\;\mathrm{mT}$ . We took two or three $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ discrete samples per core from Hole U1486B $\left(N=49\right)$ to characterize the NRM demagnetization behavior and to investigate the roc k magnetic properties of the sediment. Discrete magnetic susceptibility, IRM, and IRM ratios indicate relatively high ferrimagnetic mineral concentrations in the upper ${\sim}62$ mbsf, greater influence o f higher coercivity minerals between ${\sim}62$ and 204 mbsf, and strongl y ferrimagnetic phases in the bottom of the hole. Coarser magneti c grain sizes and higher magnetic concentrations in Subunit IC likel y reflect the increased occurrence of mafic-rich volcanogenic sediment, with the highest magnetic concentrations associated with primary and altered basaltic fragments found at the bottom of the hole.  

The Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool was deployed with nonmagnetic hardware for all cores, which permitted azimuthal correction  of  declination.  Corrected  declination  is  largely  coheren t between cores; however, absolute values in all holes cluster aroun d $180^{\circ}$ for normal polarity and $0^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity, suggesting tha t the issues of the baseline offset experienced at the majority of site s during Expedition 363 also affected these measurements. Across al l three holes, we observed eight coeval and distinct $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ changes i n declination. These declination shifts occur at the same time that inclination changes from GAD-like values during normal polarity t o steeper and more overprinted values during reversed polarity. Th e Matuyama/Brunhes boundary $(0.781\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is identified at ${\sim}47$ mbs f (Figure F17). Below this boundary, we observed the upper $[{\sim}55\$ mbsf; $0.988\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and lower $\mathord{\sim}60$ mbsf; $1.072\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) boundaries of th e Jaramillo normal (C1r.1n), the upper ( $[\sim\!66.5\$ mbsf; $1.173\mathrm{~Ma}_{\star}$ ) an d lower ( $[\sim\!68.5\$ mbsf; 1.185 Ma) boundaries of the Cobb Mountai n Subchron (C1r.2n), and the upper $\ J{02}$ mbsf; $1.778\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and lowe r $_{\sim113}$ mbsf; 1.945 Ma) boundaries of the Olduvai normal (C2n). The Gauss/Matuyama boundary $(2.581\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is at $\mathord{\sim}182$ mbsf. Continued normal polarity below this depth in all three holes implie s that the recovered sediment is ${<}3.032\ \mathrm{Ma}$ because we did not observe  the  upper  boundary  of  the  Kaena  reversed  subchro n (C2An.1n). These reversal horizons are in excellent agreement wit h both the calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer datum s (Figure F18).

Figure F18. Age-depth plot for Site U1486 showing integrated biomagnetochronology for Hole U1486A. Sedimentation rates were ${\sim}6\,\mathsf{c m/k})$ for most of th e Pleistocene (0–125 mbsf) and $14\,{\mathsf{c m}}/{\mathsf{k y}}$ in the Pliocene and earliest Pleistocene (below 125 mbsf). The base of the hole (203 mbsf) is assigned a latest Pliocen e age, ${\sim}2.72$ Ma, assuming a constant sedimentation rate of $14\,{\mathsf{c m}},$ /ky for the basal $^{20}\,\mathsf{m}$ section.  

Physical property data collected for Site U1486, in particula r magnetic susceptibility, show variations that correlate well with th e three lithologic subunits defined for the site (Figure F17). Magneti c susceptibility values are low in the upper 57 mbsf $\zeta\sim\!20\times10^{-5}$ to 5 0 $\times\,10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI},$ ), corresponding to Subunit IA, which consists primarily o f biogenic components (foraminifers and nannofossils) mixed wit h clay and rare tephra layers. Over the same interval, GRA bulk density increases from 1.4 to $1.6~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ , although variability remain s low. Between 57 and 140 mbsf (Subunit IB), average magnetic susceptibility values increase to ${\sim}75\,\times\,10^{-5}$ to $100\times10^{-5}$ SI, with frequent peaks reaching $200~\times~10^{-5}$ to $400~\times~10^{-5}$ SI. Within thi s interval, distinct peaks in magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity are coincident with darker, volcanogenic-ric h layers superimposed on background nannofossil clay with varyin g proportions of foraminifers and ash. GRA bulk density increases t o $1.6\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ in Subunit IB. Below 140 mbsf (Subunit IC), magnetic susceptibility average values increase $\left(\sim\!200\;\times\;10^{-5}\;\,\mathrm{SI}\right)$ ) and distinc t peaks in magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity occur more frequently, reflecting the dominance of volcanogenic material in the deepest part of the succession. GRA bul k density reaches $1.8~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ by 200 mbsf before decreasing to 1. 7 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ in the deepest part of Hole U1486B. Unusually high $P.$ -wav e velocity values above $1800\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ are also found in this interval. Thes e high values coincide with the appearance of indurated sedimen t containing cemented zeolite precipitates and other minerals associated with the alteration of volcanic glass by hydrothermal fluids, suggesting that hydrothermal alteration was likely due to clos e proximity to the basaltic basement. NGR decreases linearly downhole from $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s at the mudline to 8 counts/s at the botto m of the sedimentary sequence (Figure F17).  

We constructed a continuous splice for Site U1486 from 0 t o $222.59\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ using three holes (U1486B, U1486C, and U1486D). Tie points were established mainly using WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data, aided occasionally by NGR data. Because Hole U1486 B was heavily sampled for interstitial water measurements (one 5–1 0 cm whole-round sample per section), we avoided using materia l from this hole for the splice from 0 to 150 mbsf, although this wa s unavoidable over a few intervals with poor recovery. The deepes t core collected at Site U1486, which contains basalt fragments and i s presumed to be within meters of volcanic basement, was appende d to the bottom of the splice.  

Site U1486 was sampled at high resolution (one $5{-}10\,\mathrm{cm}$ wholeround sample per section downhole to $150\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) for interstitial water geochemistry. Of the 106 whole-round samples taken, 39 wer e processed for standard shipboard analyses, along with one mudlin e sample, and the remainder were archived for shore-based analyses. The interstitial water profiles reflect the variable sedimentation an d tectonic evolution of the site over the past several million years. I n the upper 60 mbsf, interstitial water profiles are dominated by moderate changes in alkalinity, $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ $\mathrm{PO}_{4},$ $\mathrm{NH}_{4},$ and $\mathrm{Br}$ that reflect  a modest degree of organic matter remineralization. The minimu m $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ concentration observed in Hole U1486B is ${\sim}19\,\mathrm{mM}$ , and methane is low $(<\!4{\mathrm{~ppm}})$ , which is consistent with the relatively low TO C content at the site (average $=0.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) (Figure F17). $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ conten t is highly variable, ranging from to 0.3 to $75.4\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ with an average o f $40.5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Overall, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content is higher in the upper 138 mbs f (Figure F17). Extremely low $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content is found in ash and sil t samples.  

Deeper than 60 mbsf, interstitial water profiles show largely linear gradients toward the base of the hole that demonstrate the influence of upward diffusion on the profiles. Superimposed on thes e linear gradients is smaller scale variability, particularly noticeable i n K, B, Na, pH, Cl, and Fe, which can be explained by the interactio n of interstitial water with reactive volcanogenic sediment/mineral s and clay-mineral alteration. The inverse relationship between C a (increasing with depth) and $\mathrm{Mg}$ (decreasing with depth) is a common feature of sites that were drilled to oceanic basement and is attributed to submarine weathering of basal sediment and basal t (representing a source of Ca) and formation of authigenic clay (representing a sink for $\mathrm{Mg},$ ). Marked changes in Cl, Mn, and Fe and a n increase in $S O_{4}$ toward the base of the hole suggest communicatio n not only between interstitial water and basement rock and sediment, but also with crustal fluids.  

# Site U1487  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1487 (proposed Site WP-14A) is located ${\sim}190~\mathrm{km}$ westsouthwest of Manus Island at $02^{\circ}20.00^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $144^{\circ}49.17^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in $874\,\mathrm{m}$ wate r depth (Figure F12). The site is situated on seismic Line RR1313- WP6-5, ${\sim}1.4~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of the crosspoint with Line RR1313- WP6-3a. The seismic profile shows a continuous succession o f hemipelagic sediment with acoustic basement estimated at $\mathord{\sim}185$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016).  

The tectonic setting of Sites U1486 and U1487 (similar to that o f the northern Papua New Guinea sites) was shaped by the obliqu e northward movement of the Australian plate as it rapidly converge d with the Pacific plate. This collision resulted in a complex plat e boundary zone that includes volcanic arcs but also resulted in th e formation and rotation of microplates within this zone, as well a s lithospheric rupture that formed small oceanic basins (Baldwin e t al., 2012). The Bismarck Sea, on the northeastern side of Papua Ne w Guinea (Figure F12), forms a back-arc basin with respect to th e New Britain arc and is divided into the NBS and SBS microplates, separated by the active Bismarck Sea left-lateral transform fault an d spreading segments (Taylor, 1979). Site U1487 is located on the NB S microplate. To the north, the NBS microplate is bordered by th e Manus Trench, which defines the boundary between it and the Pacific plate. Within this complex tectonic regime, the southwester n side of the Manus Basin is considered one of the more stable regions. Magnetic anomalies in the Bismarck Sea indicate rapid asymmetric spreading since $3.5\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ (Taylor, 1979). The continuou s collision between the Australian and Pacific plates caused the SB S microplate to rotate rapidly clockwise $({\sim}9^{\circ}/\mathrm{My})$ , whereas the NB S microplate is rotating slowly anticlockwise $(0.3^{\circ}{-}1.25^{\circ}/\mathrm{My})$ (Baldwin et al., 2012). Asymmetric rotation of the North and South Bismarck Basins likely changed the position of New Britain an d adjacent islands relative to Papua New Guinea. ODP Leg 193 focused on the eastern part of Manus Basin, exploring the tectonic, volcanic, and seafloor hydrothermal system activity in this convergent plate margin setting.  

Site U1487 is upslope from Site U1486 and is expected to sho w the same sediment composition but with reduced sedimentatio n rate because of its shallower position. As a companion to Sit e U1486, Site U1487 was also targeted because of its potential to provide an excellent Pleistocene paleoceanographic record to examin e orbital-scale climate variability at high resolution through the Pleistocene. The site is also ideally located to monitor the contribution o f the NGCC and NGCU to the ITF. The NGCC is the souther n branch of the westward, cross-equatorial flowing SEC and constitutes the main southern Pacific contribution to the surface transport of the ITF. At a water depth of ${\sim}880~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , this site is bathed b y modified Antarctic Intermediate Water originating from the Southern Ocean (Figure F5B) and thus will allow for the reconstruction o f past variability of this water mass.  

# Operations  

After a $13.3\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1486, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1487 at $1145\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November 2016. Site U1487 was a n alternate site added to the operations during the expedition. W e planned two holes using the APC to $\mathord{\sim}175$ mbsf, with a third hole t o cover stratigraphic gaps if required. We ultimately cored two holes; Hole U1487A was cored to 144.2 mbsf, and Hole U1487B was core d to 144.3 mbsf (Table T1).  

Hole U1487A was cored with the APC using orientation an d nonmagnetic hardware to 144.2 mbsf (Cores 363-U1487A-1 H through 16H). Downhole formation temperature measurements using the APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H (34.9 mbsf), 7H (63. 4 mbsf), 10H (91.9 mbsf), and 13H (120.4 mbsf), obtaining good results on all four deployments. We terminated coring after Core s 14H and 16H recorded partial strokes, and Core 15H had to b e drilled over due to excessive overpull when attempting to retrieve it. Cores 14H through 16H included unconsolidated sand. We collected $146.43\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $144.2\:\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $102\%$ recovery ) in Hole U1487A.  

Hole U1487B was then cored to 125.5 mbsf (Cores 363-U1487B1H through 14H) with the APC using orientation and nonmagneti c hardware. We switched to the HLAPC to core the interval where w e encountered unconsolidated sand in Hole U1487A. We cored t o 144.3 mbsf (Cores 15F through 18F) with the HLAPC, where w e terminated the hole. We collected $148.73\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $144.3\;\mathrm{m}$ o f coring $103\%$ recovery) in Hole U1487B. Operations at Site U148 7 ended at $2215\ \mathrm{h}$ on 18 November. Total time spent at Site U148 7 was $34.5\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.4 days).  

A total of 30 APC cores were recovered at this site, collectin g $276.34\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $269.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $.102.5\%$ recovery). W e also collected 4 HLAPC cores, retrieving $18.82\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment ove r

$18.8~\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $100.1\%$ recovery). In total, we collected $295.16~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $288.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $102.3\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

Sediment at Site U1487 is composed of ${\sim}144\mathrm{~m~}$ of upper Pliocene to recent volcanogenic, authigenic, and biogenic sediment, with a sequence similar to that seen at Site U1486, which is locate d $25~\mathrm{km}$ west-southwest. We assigned the recovered succession t o one lithologic unit divided into three subunits (Figure F19), with th e subunits distinguished based on the amount of volcanogenic material in the sediment. Subunit IA (late Pleistocene to recent) span s the upper ${\sim}21\mathrm{~m~}$ and is composed primarily of biogenic (foraminifer and nannofossil) sediment mixed with clay minerals with rar e ash layers. The dominant lithology is nannofossil-rich foraminife r ooze, whereas the sediment at Site U1486 is finer grained and consists mostly of foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze. Trace amounts o f siliceous components (radiolarians, diatoms, and silicoflagellates ) are also present. Pteropods are found in the uppermost part of th e section. The base of Subunit IA is placed at the second downhol e tephra layer, which marks an increase in the proportion of volcani c particles in the sediment. Subunit IB (late Pleistocene) extends fro m the base of Subunit IA to ${\sim}86$ mbsf. Biogenic sediment (predominantly foraminifers) is still the main sedimentary component of thi s subunit, but volcanogenic sediment is more abundant here than i n Subunit IA. The main lithology is nannofossil-bearing to nannofossil-rich ash-rich foraminifer ooze. Siliceous microfossils remai n present in trace amounts. Tephra layers are typically brown to blac k and composed primarily of glass shards, indicative of explosive volcanism. Black tephra layers become more common toward the bas e of the subunit. As at Site U1486, the base of Subunit IB is marked b y a prominent volcanic ash layer that corresponds with a shift t o higher magnetic susceptibility values (Figure F19). Subunit IC (lat e Pliocene to early Pleistocene) marks the transition from dominantl y biogenic above to dominantly volcanogenic sediment below. Th e principal lithology is ash with varying proportions of nannofossils, foraminifers, and clay. The volcanogenic component in Subunit I C is primarily composed of microscoria, rather than glass, and wa s likely sourced from less explosive eruptions.  

The sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1487 exhibit s many similarities to that recovered at Site U1486. Both sites spa n the past ${\sim}2.7$ My and exhibit a reduction in volcanogenic inpu t through time. Despite the overall similarity between the two sites, we note four important differences in the sedimentology of Sit e U1487 relative to Site U1486:  

1. An overall coarser grain size (foraminifer ooze versus nanno  
fossil ooze),   
2. Lower sedimentation rates,   
3. More intense bioturbation and reworking, and   
4. Thicker tephra layers with larger microscoria fragments.  

The sediment succession at Site U1487 contains calcareou s nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and benthic foraminifer s throughout. Microfossil preservation is excellent to very good. Benthic foraminifers indicate a deepwater bathyal sedimentary environment with a planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratio typically 99: 1 throughout the succession.  

Biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic horizons are generally in good agreement. The oldest sediment recovered belongs t o calcareous nannofossil Zone NN16 and planktonic foraminife r Zone PL5 (late Pliocene) and is estimated to be $2.65\ \mathrm{Ma}$ based o n extrapolation of the age-depth trend (Figure F20). From the base o f the hole to ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , sedimentation rates averaged ${\sim}15\;\mathrm{cm/ky},$ mainl y because of the very high rate of volcanic ash deposition early in th e site’s history. Sedimentation rates slowed significantly in the Pleistocene, averaging ${\sim}3.5\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F20).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1487 involved measurement of the NRM of archive-half sections from Holes U1487A an d U1487B before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ .

Figure F20. Age-depth plot for Site U1487 showing integrated biomagnetochronology for Hole U1487A. Sedimentation rates averaged ${\sim}3.5\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ throug h much of the Pleistocene (0–60 mbsf) and ${\sim}15\,\mathsf{c m/k y}$ in the Pliocene and earliest Pleistocene (deeper than 60 mbsf). The age of the oldest recovered sedimen t is estimated at 2.65 Ma based on extrapolation of the age-depth trend.  

Corrected declination is largely coherent between cores; however, absolute values in all holes cluster around $180^{\circ}$ for normal polarit y and $0^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity, suggesting that the issues of the baseline offset experienced at the majority of sites during Expeditio n 363 affected these measurements. Relatively soft ferrimagnetic minerals are concentrated in the upper ${\sim}24$ mbsf; increased magneti c concentration and coercivity with depth likely reflect the increase d deposition of mafic-rich volcanogenic ash and tephra. We identif y six $180^{\circ}$ shifts in declination at Site U1487; the deepest of these i s the Gauss/Matuyama boundary $(2.582\ \mathrm{Ma})$ at $\mathord{\sim}134$ mbsf (Figur e F19). Continued normal polarity below this depth in both holes implies that the recovered sediment is younger than $3.032\,\mathrm{Ma}$ because we do not observe the upper boundary of the Kaena reversed subchron (C2An.1n). The magnetostratigraphy is in good agreemen t with both the calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer datums (Figure F20).  

All physical property data at Site U1487 exhibit excellent reproducibility between holes and show typical trends consistent with increased downhole volcanogenic input. As with Site U1486, th e trends and variability in the Site U1487 physical property data correlate well with the three defined lithologic subunits. These subunits are most easily recognized in magnetic susceptibility, which i s low in the upper 22 mbsf ( $\sim\!20\times10^{-5}$ to $50\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI},$ ), correspondin g to lithologic Subunit IA, which consists of nannofossil-rich foraminifer ooze with variable amounts of clay and ash (Figure F19).  

Over the same interval, GRA bulk density increases from 1.4 to 1. 6 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , albeit with low variability. Between 22 and 86 mbsf (Subuni t IB), average magnetic susceptibility increases to ${\sim}75\times10^{-5}$ to $100\,\times$ $10^{-5}\:\mathrm{SI}$ , with a concomitant increase in variability. GRA bulk densit y also increases to $1.6~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Within Subunit IB, distinct peaks i n magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity occur coincident with darker, volcanogenic-rich layers, superimpose d on a background lithology of nannofossil-rich foraminifer ooze wit h variable clay and ash content. The highest NGR values $^{\sim}20\$ counts/s) occur in the upper ${\sim}86$ mbsf (Subunits IA and IB) of Sit e U1487, reflecting higher clay content in these subunits relative t o Subunit IC (Figure F19). NGR variability in the upper 86 mbsf probably reflects changes in the amount of biogenic material. Below 8 6 mbsf (Subunit IC), average magnetic susceptibility increases t o ${\sim}200\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\mathrm{~SI~}$ and the distinct peaks in magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity occur more frequently, reflecting the dominance of volcanogenic material in the deepest par t of the site.  

We constructed a continuous splice for Site U1487 from 0 t o $136.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF using both Holes U1487A and U1487B. We use d WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data aided occasionally by NG R and GRA bulk density to correlate between the holes. Because Hol e U1487A was sampled for interstitial water measurements, our general approach was to use Hole U1487B as the backbone of the splic e and to use short segments from Hole U1487A to cover gaps in recovery encountered in Hole U1487B. There is considerable coarse sand below $136.0\ \mathrm{m}$ CCSF, and the WRMSL data did not correlate well between the holes due to drilling disturbance, including possible flow-in that occurred while retrieving the cores from the bottom of the hole. For this reason, the splice has gaps and uncertain tie points from $136.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF to the bottom of the hole at $156.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF.  

Site U1487 was sampled at standard resolution for interstitial water chemistry $\left[\sim\right]$ whole-round sample per core), with a total of 18 whole-round samples and 1 mudline sample analyzed. Despite the relative proximity of Sites U1487 and U1486, the profiles at Site U1487 display distinct differences from those at Site U1486. Low $\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{NH_{4}}$ concentrations $^{\angle1.5\ \upmu\mathrm{M}}$ and $0.2\ m M_{\mathrm{r}}$ , respectively) and a relatively high $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ concentration $(>\!24\,\mathrm{mM})$ ) downhole suggest lower organic matter content at Site U1487. Concentration of methane also remains low throughout the hole. Small downhole interstitial water gradients were observed in several elements (K, Li, and B) and likely reflect clay mineral authigenesis. However, the majority of the interstitial water profiles at Site U1487 display little to no variation with depth and appear to be influenced by advection and/or diffusion of crustal fluids. For example, Ca and $\mathrm{Mg}$ concentrations both change by ${>}15~\mathrm{mM}$ from the mudline to ${\sim}5$ mbsf but vary by ${<}1\ \mathrm{mM}$ below that depth. Higher permeability expected from the generally coarser sediment grain size and presence of several faults near Site U1487 that penetrate from the basement through the majority of the sediment column may help facilitate fluid migration.  

$\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content shows a monotonic decreasing trend with depth, with $C a C O_{3}$ content ranging from ${>}60\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ in the upper 20 mbsf to ${<}10\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ in the bottom $15\,\mathrm{m}$ of the recovered sequence (Figure F19). Comparison of $C a C O_{3}$ content with GRA bulk density data suggests that this trend can be explained by two-component mixing between biogenic carbonate (dominant in the upper portions of the hole) and volcanogenic sediment (dominant in the lower portions of the hole).  

# Site U1488  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1488 (proposed Site WP-03A) is located atop the southern part of the Eauripik Rise at $02^{\circ}02.59\,\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{{z}}}$ , $141^{\circ}45.29\mathrm{\,E}$ in $2604\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F21). The site is situated on seismic Line RR1313- WP3-1, ${\sim}4.4~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of the intersection with seismic Line RR1313-WP3-3. The seismic profile shows a continuous succession of hemipelagic, carbonate-rich sediment with basement at ${>}650$ mbsf (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Site U1488 is located ${\sim}28~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 62 (Figure F21) and close to the location of piston Core MD97-2140, which was used to reconstruct the Pleistocene SST history of the WPWP (de GaridelThoron et al., 2005). Leg 7 recovered a nearly continuous sequence of upper Oligocene to Quaternary chalk and carbonate-rich ooze from Site 62 (Winterer and Riedel, 1971). However, recovery was relatively poor, and the sediment was frequently disturbed due to the use of the RCB system.  

Figure F21. Eauripik Rise and Caroline Basin map (green box in Figure F3) showing the location of Sites U1488–U1490 (yellow circles) and DSDP Site 62 (purple circle). Contour interval $=\,500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Bathymetric data are from Amante and Eakins (2009).  

Site U1488 is situated on the Eauripik Rise within the Caroline Basin north of Papua New Guinea (Figure F3). The roughly north– south trending Eauripik Rise is an ${\sim}250\,\mathrm{km}$ wide aseismic ridge that rises ${\sim}1{-}2\ \mathrm{km}$ above the surrounding seafloor and separates the East and West Caroline Basins. Magnetic Anomalies C13–C9 in both basins show that ocean crust formed along roughly east–west spreading centers from the Eocene until the late Oligocene. Offsets in these anomalies and the lack of magnetic lineations beneath the Eauripik Rise support the interpretation that it formed due to excess submarine volcanism along a leaky north–south transform fault (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988.) An alternative interpretation attributes the formation of the Eauripik Rise to the northward passage of a mantle hotspot that contributed to the tectonically and structurally complex region surrounding the Sorol Trough (Bracey, 1975). Seismic refractions show thickened ocean crust beneath the Eauripik Rise, and a small free air anomaly and positive geoid anomaly indicate a compensated structure reaching deep into the mantle (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988). Although there are no discernible magnetic lineations on the Eauripik Rise, these data and the recovery of tholeiitic basalt at Site 62 (Shipboard Scientific, 1971) make it difficult to argue that it is a remnant of ancient continental material. The igneous rocks recovered from the bottom of Site 62 are slightly vesicular, highly altered, and contain calcite veins with well-preserved foraminifers and nannofossils. The dolomitization of overlying limestone suggests that these basalts intruded into marine chalk, leading to extensive diagenetic reactions near the base of the sedimentary succession.

Site U1488 is located ${\sim}2^{\circ}$ north of the Equator and is thus suitable for reconstructing the hydrographic history of the WPWP. The comparatively low sedimentation rate at this site, typical of openocean environments, will be used along with the record from Site U1490 to reconstruct the evolution of the WPWP since the late Miocene. At $2600\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ the site is bathed by modified UCDW (Figure F5A) and therefore will be useful to monitor past changes in this water mass. High-resolution interstitial water sampling at this site will be used for geochemical reconstructions of the deep Pacific water mass $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O},$ salinity, and seawater chemistry) during the LGM.  

# Operations  

After a $333.2\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1487, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1488 at $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 November 2016. The original operations plan called for three holes: the first to APC refusal, estimate d at 250 mbsf, followed by two holes to 300 mbsf using both the AP C and XCB coring systems. We ultimately cored three holes using onl y the APC and HLAPC systems, with the deepest penetrating to ${\sim}315$ mbsf (Table T1).  

Hole U1488A was cored with the APC system using orientatio n and nonmagnetic hardware to 300.4 mbsf (Cores 1H through 32H). Downhole formation temperature measurements using the APCT- 3 were taken on Cores 4H (34.4 mbsf), 7H $\mathrm{^{(62.9\mbsf)}}$ ), 10H (91. 4 mbsf), and 13H (119.9 mbsf), obtaining good results on all four deployments. We also collected high-resolution interstitial water samples at a frequency of one whole-round $(5{-}10\ \mathrm{cm})$ sample pe r section over the upper 150 mbsf of Hole U1488A. After Cores 31 H and 32H had excessive overpull and required drillover to extrac t them from the formation, we switched to the HLAPC system an d continued coring to 314.5 mbsf (Cores 33F through 35F). Becaus e Cores 33F and 35F also required drillover, indicating HLAPC refusal, we terminated coring. We collected $327.20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t over $314.5~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $104\%$ recovery) in Hole U1488A.  

Hole U1488B was cored to 304.9 mbsf (Cores 1H through 33H ) with the APC system using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. Cores 31H through 33H required drillover, indicating APC refusal, so we terminated coring. We collected $315.77\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over 304. 9 m of coring ( $104\%$ recovery) in Hole U1488B.  

Hole U1488C was cored to recover material for the stratigraphi c splice over the upper 150 mbsf, since high-resolution interstitial water sampling was conducted in Hole U1488A over this interval. AP C coring using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware proceeded t o 159.3 mbsf (Cores 1H through 17H), where we terminated coring. We collected $153.60\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $159.3\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(96.4\%$ recovery) in Hole U1488C.  

Operations at Site U1488 ended at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 November. Total time spent at Site U1488 was $102.5\,\mathrm{h}$ (4.3 days). A total of 82 AP C cores were recovered at this site, collecting $781.74\mathrm{~m~}$ of sedimen t over $764.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of coring ( $102.2\%$ recovery). We also collected  3 HLAPC cores, retrieving $14.83\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $14.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of corin g $.105.2\%$ recovery). In total, we collected $796.57\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment ove r $778.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $102.3\%$ recovery) at Site U1488.  

# Principal results  

We recovered an ${\sim}315\;\mathrm{m}$ succession of upper Miocene to recen t foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze to foraminifer-nannofossil ooz e in three holes at Site U1488. The sediment is assigned to a singl e lithologic unit (Figure F22). Siliciclastic (mainly clay minerals), siliceous (radiolarians, diatoms, sponge spicules, and silicoflagellates), and volcanogenic (ash) particles are present as minor sedimen t components. Authigenic sulfide precipitates and authigenic cla y minerals (e.g., smectite–chlorite) also occur as accessories. The sediment varies downhole with small changes in the color and abundance of different components. The upper ${\sim}50$ mbsf is composed o f light greenish gray clay- and foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze tha t transitions to greenish white foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze between ${\sim}50$ and ${\sim}250$ mbsf. The bottom part of the site (deeper tha n ${\sim}250\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) is primarily yellowish white radiolarian/diatom-bearin g foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze. Bioturbation is slight to moderate. Three volcanic ash layers composed of fresh, angular, and colorless glass shards are found at ${\sim}6.5$ , ${\sim}93$ , and ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ (Figure F22). Calcareous microfossil assemblages and preservation at Sit e  

U1488 are typical of a pelagic, relatively deepwater bathyal environment throughout the recovered succession. Unlike previous site s (U1482–U1487), microfossil preservation at Site U1488 shows  a marked increase in recrystallization (foraminifers) and some fragmentation, etching, and overgrowth (foraminifers and calcareou s nannofossils) downhole. Biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphi c horizons indicate recovery of a continuous sequence of pelagic sediment spanning the last ${\sim}10$ My (Figure F23). The oldest sedimen t recovered at Site U1488 is constrained to be younger than ${\sim}10.47$ Ma by the absence of the planktonic foraminifer $P_{\star}$ mayeri and olde r than $9.69\,\mathrm{Ma}$ by the presence of the calcareous nannofossil Catinaster coalitus. The Miocene/Pliocene boundary $(5.333\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is place d at $\mathord{\sim}149$ mbsf (Figure F22) based on linear interpolation betwee n the biohorizon base Ceratolithus armatus $(5.35\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and biohorizo n base Ceratolithus cristatus $(5.12\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . The base of the late Pliocen e $\left(3.60\,M\mathrm{a}\right)$ is placed at ${\sim}92\,\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ , between the biohorizon top Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus $(3.70\mathrm{~Ma})$ and biohorizon top Sphenolithus abies $(3.54\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary is place d at ${\sim}60$ mbsf, just below the base of Chron C2r.2r at 59.70 mbsf, an d the base of the middle Pleistocene is at the base of Chron C1n a t ${\sim}19$ mbsf. The middle/late Pleistocene boundary is placed betwee n the biohorizon top $P\!\!\!\!/$ lacunosa $\left(0.44\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and biohorizon top $G.$ . ruber (pink) $(0.12\,\mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}12$ mbsf. Long-term average sedimentatio n rates through the late Miocene and Pliocene were remarkably consistent at ${\sim}4~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . These rates roughly halved through the earl y Pleistocene $({\sim}2\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ before they increased in the middle to lat e Pleistocene $({\sim}3\,\mathrm{\cm/ky})$ (Figure F23). Benthic foraminifer assemblages are characteristic of intermediate to deep bathyal depths wit h Laevidentalina spp. and Uvigerina spp. as the dominant forms.  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1488 involved measurement of the NRM of archive-half sections from Hole U1488A, th e upper ${\sim}67\$ mbsf of Hole U1488B, and the upper ${\sim}102$ mbsf in Hol e U1488C before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ Corrected declination is largely coherent between cores; however, absolute values in all holes cluster between $90^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ for period s of normal polarity and between $270^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ}/360^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity, suggesting that the issues of a baseline offset experienced at th e majority of sites during Expedition 363 also affected these measurements. Relatively soft ferrimagnetic minerals are concentrated i n the uppermost ${\sim}45$ mbsf. Between ${\sim}45$ and ${\sim}50$ mbsf, $\mathrm{NRM}_{\mathrm{15mT}}$ magnetic susceptibility, and SIRM values decrease, and below ${\sim}50$ mbsf, average magnetic susceptibility values fall to $0.6~\times~10^{-5}$ SI. $\mathrm{NRM}_{15\mathrm{mT}}$ , magnetic susceptibility, and SIRM values deeper tha n ${\sim}50$ mbsf are approximately two orders of magnitude lower tha n those in the upper ${\sim}45$ mbsf and often approach the noise level o f their respective instruments, indicating a significant reduction i n magnetic mineral concentration deeper than ${\sim}50$ mbsf that resulte d in an uninterpretable paleomagnetic record. We identify six $180^{\circ}$ shifts in declination in Holes U1488A and U1488B and nine horizons in Hole U1488C (Figure F23) before ultimate degradation o f the  paleomagnetic  signal.  The  deepest  of  these  are  th e Gauss/Matuyama boundary $(2.582\ \mathrm{\Ma})$ at ${\sim}60$ mbsf in Hole s U1488A and U1488B and the upper boundary of C2An.2n ( $\,\,\sim\!82$ mbsf; $3.207\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) in Hole U1488C (Figure F22).  

All physical properties at Site U1488 exhibit excellent reproducibility between holes. GRA bulk density shows an increasing tren d with depth from $1.4\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the seafloor to $1.8\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the botto m of the hole, likely caused by compaction. At a break in this trend between ${\sim}245$ and $285~\mathrm{mbsf},$ values remain at ${\sim}1.75~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ before increasing to $1.8~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ . $P$ -wave velocity also shows an increasin g trend with depth caused by compaction, increasing from $1500\ \mathrm{m/s}$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}1600~\mathrm{m/s}$ at 310 mbsf. NGR values are ${\sim}25$ counts/s at the seafloor and then rapidly decreases to ${\sim}8$ counts/ s by 8 mbsf. NGR then gradually decreases to 2 counts/s over th e length of the record. Magnetic susceptibility also initially exhibit s moderate susceptibility $(\sim\!30\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\,\mathrm{SI})$ ) before decreasing abruptl y at ${\sim}45$ mbsf to values averaging $<\!3\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ to the bottom of the sit e (Figure F22). Thermal conductivity increases from 0.9 to 1. 3 $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ from the seafloor to the bottom of the hole. Deeper tha n 150 mbsf, the thermal conductivity slope decreases and variabilit y increases. Downhole formation temperature measurements indicate a geothermal gradient of $59^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ at Site U1488.

We constructed a continuous splice for Site U1488 from 0 t o $324.89\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ using three holes (U1488A, U1488B, and U1488C). Tie points were established with WRMSL magnetic susceptibility, GRA bulk density, and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity data, as well as NGR and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ color reflectance data. Because the upper 150 mbsf (equivalent t o ${\sim}162\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ ) of Hole U1488A was heavily sampled (one 5 or 1 0 cm whole-round sample per section) for high-resolution interstitia l water analyses, our general approach was to avoid using materia l from that interval in Hole U1488A because Hole U1488C was core d specifically to recover material for the splice. The splice is continuous and well constrained from 0 to $324.89\mathrm{~m~CCSF},$ although a fe w tentative tie points should be verified during postcruise research. Only Hole U1488A penetrated deeper than $324.89\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, an d therefore we appended the last two cores of Hole U1488A to th e bottom of the splice.  

At Site U1488, a total of 113 whole-round samples and one mudline sample were collected for interstitial water analysis. High-resolution sampling was conducted in the upper 150 mbsf of Hol e U1488A with the goal of reconstructing Cl concentration and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of UCDW during the LGM. Preliminary shipboard chlorinity measurements suggest that reconstruction of the salinity of UCDW will be possible with the samples collected.  

The interstitial water profiles at Site U1488 are controlled i n large part by carbonate diagenesis, indicated by a steady 10-fold enrichment in Sr down to ${\sim}100$ mbsf accompanied by an increase o f dissolved Ca, although a moderate increase in alkalinity over th e same depth suggests both dissolution and recrystallization are taking place. Deeper than ${\sim}100$ mbsf, linear increases in alkalinity, $\mathrm{{SO}_{4},}$ Ca, and Li and decreases in Sr, K, and $\mathsf{p H}$ are likely reflecting communication with a deep fluid source through diffusion. In general, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ is the major constituent of the sediment of Site U1488, wit h an average content of $83.5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F22). $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content increases with depth from ${\sim}70~\mathrm{wt\%}$ near the seafloor to ${>}90\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ a t ${\sim}170$ mbsf. TOC content shows several stepwise decreases downhole, from ${\sim}0.5$ to $0.2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the uppermost 25 mbsf and then further decreases from $0.2~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at ${\sim}170$ mbsf to minimal values tha t often are below the detection limit (Figure F22). TN content show s a trend similar to that of TOC content. Shallower than $80~\mathrm{mbsf},$ where both TOC and TN contents are above the detection limit, th e

Magnetochron reversals from Hole U1488C are show n where they extend below those reliably recorded in Hole U1488A. Age of the oldest recovered sediment at Site U1488 is constrained to ${\sim}10.47$ Ma by th e absence of the PF Paragloborotalia mayeri and $>\!9.69$ Ma by the presence of the calcareous nannofossil Catinaster coalitus at 314.52 mbsf.

$C/\Nu$ ratio is low, suggesting that the majority of the organic matte r is derived from marine production; however, caution should b e taken when interpreting the TOC and $C/\Nu$ records because shipboard TOC values were calculated by the subtraction method.  

# Site U1489  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1489 (proposed Site WP-04A) is located on the wester n slope of the southern Eauripik Rise at $02^{\circ}07.19^{\prime}\mathrm{N},$ , $141^{\circ}01.67^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ i n $3421\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figure F21). The site is situated on seismi c Line RR1313-WP4-2 at the intersection with seismic Line RR1313- WP4-3. The seismic profile shows a continuous succession of hemipelagic, carbonate-rich sediment with basement at ${>}650$ mbs f (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Site U1489 is located ${\sim}81~\mathrm{km}$ west-northwest of Site U1488 and ${\sim}105~\mathrm{km}$ northwest of DSDP Site 62 an d shows a similar sedimentary cover (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1971).  

Site U1489 is situated on the western slope of the southern par t of Eauripik Rise, within the Caroline Basin north of Papua Ne w Guinea (Figure F3). The roughly north–south trending Eauripi k Rise is an ${\sim}250~\mathrm{km}$ wide aseismic ridge that rises ${\sim}1{-}2~\mathrm{km}$ abov e the surrounding seafloor and separates the East and West Carolin e Basins. Magnetic Anomalies C13–C9 in both basins show tha t ocean crust formed along roughly east–west spreading centers fro m the Eocene until the late Oligocene. Offsets in these anomalies an d the lack of magnetic lineations beneath the Eauripik Rise support s the interpretation that it formed due to excess submarine volcanis m along a leaky north–south transform fault (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988.) An alternative interpretation attributes the formation of th e Eauripik Rise to the northward passage of a mantle hotspot tha t contributed to the tectonically and structurally complex region surrounding the Sorol Trough (Bracey, 1975). Seismic refractions sho w thickened ocean crust beneath the Eauripik Rise, and a small freeair anomaly and positive geoid anomaly indicate a compensate d structure reaching deep into the mantle (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988). Although there are no discernible magnetic lineations on th e Eauripik Rise, these data and the recovery of tholeiitic basalt at Sit e 62 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1971) make it difficult to argue that i t is a remnant of ancient continental material. The igneous rocks recovered from the bottom of Site 62 are slightly vesicular and highl y altered and contain calcite veins with well-preserved foraminifer s and nannofossils. The dolomitization of overlying limestone suggests that these basalts intruded into marine chalk leading to extensive  diagenetic  reactions  near  the  base  of  the  sedimentar y succession.  

Site U1489 is located ${\sim}2^{\circ}$ north of the Equator and is thus suitable for reconstructing the hydrographic history of the WPWP. Th e comparatively low sedimentation rate at this site, typical of openocean environments, allows coring of the middle Miocene at a relatively shallow depth, which was not possible at Site U1488, offerin g the opportunity to reconstruct the evolution of the WPWP fro m the MMCO to the middle Miocene climate transition associate d with expansion of the Antarctic ice sheet. At ${\sim}3400\;\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the site i s bathed by modified LCDW and therefore will be useful to monito r past changes in this water mass (Figure F5A). Because this site i s close to Site U1488 but at ${\sim}900\mathrm{~m~}$ deeper water depth, comparin g results from these two sites also offers the opportunity to investigat e potential diagenetic effects of foraminifer geochemical proxy records. High-resolution interstitial water sampling at this site will b e used for geochemical reconstructions of the deep Pacific wate r mass $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O},$ salinity, and seawater chemistry) during the LGM.  

# Operations  

After a 44 nmi transit from Site U1488, the vessel stabilized ove r Site U1489 at $1442~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 November 2016. Site U1489 was an alternate site that was added during the expedition to complemen t the record cored at Site U1488. We initially planned to core thre e holes to 200 mbsf; however, we requested and received permissio n to core to 5.0 s TWT at our site location on seismic reflection profile Line RR1313 WP4-2. We ultimately cored four holes at Sit e U1489 (Table T1). Hole U1489A consisted of a single full APC core, which indicated we missed the mudline. Hole U1489B was core d with the APC system to 129.2 mbsf. We terminated coring in thi s hole because of coring difficulties that resulted in poor recovery an d core disturbance. Hole U1489C was cored to 385.6 mbsf using  a combination of APC, HLAPC, and XCB coring, and Hole U1489 D was cored with the APC system to 127.2 mbsf, drilled without coring to 274.0 mbsf, and then cored with the XCB system to 385. 6 mbsf.  

Hole U1489A was cored with the APC system using orientatio n and nonmagnetic hardware. Core 1H recovered a full core barrel, indicating that we had missed the mudline, so we terminated coring. We collected $9.53\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $100\%$ recovery) in Hole U1489A.  

Hole U1489B was cored to 129.2 mbsf with the APC system using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware (Cores 1H throug h 14H). Downhole formation temperature measurements using th e APCT-3 were taken on Cores 4H (34.2 mbsf), 7H (62.7 mbsf), 10 H $(91.2\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ , and 12H (110.2 mbsf); however, only one measuremen t was of good quality (Core 10H). The measurements taken while collecting Cores 4H and 7H showed possible movement related t o heavy seas, and the measurement from Core 12H was of very poo r quality. We also collected high-resolution interstitial water sample s at a frequency of one $(5{-}10~\mathrm{cm})$ whole-round sample per sectio n over the entire cored succession in Hole U1489B. Coring difficultie s included premature failure of the APC shear pins due to ship motion on Cores 3H and 8H, as well as one core with no recovery (Cor e 11H) and two cores requiring a second coring attempt to retriev e sediment (Cores 12H and 13H). As these cores appeared very disturbed, we opted to terminate coring in Hole U1489B. We collecte d $120.66\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $129.2\textrm{m}$ of coring ( $93\%$ recovery) in Hol e U1489B.  

Hole U1489C was cored to 269.5 mbsf (Cores 1H through 29H ) with the APC using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. Cor e 29H required drillover to extract it from the formation, indicatin g APC refusal. We switched to the HLAPC system and cored only t o $278.9\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ (Cores 30F and 31F) before excessive overpull indicate d HLAPC refusal. We then switched to the XCB system to core t o 385.6 mbsf (Cores 32X through 42X), where we terminated coring. We collected $376.35\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $385.6~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $98\%$ recovery) in Hole U1489C.  

Hole U1489D was cored to recover material for the splice ove r the upper ${\sim}120$ mbsf interval that was heavily sampled for interstitial water in Hole U1489B and to collect a second copy of the deepe r succession at Site U1489. Hole U1489D was cored with the AP C system using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware to 127.2 mbs f (Cores 1H through 14H). Because several of the APCT-3 measurements provided spurious results in Hole U1489B, we opted to tak e additional measurements in Hole U1489D while collecting Core s 4H (32.2 mbsf), 7H (60.7 mbsf), 10H (89.2 mbsf), and 13H (117. 7 mbsf). All four measurements provided good results. We drille d without coring from 127.2 to 274.0 mbsf and then cored using th e XCB system to 385.6 mbsf (Cores 16X through 27X), where we terminated coring. We collected $229.24\:\mathrm{m}$ of core over $238.8\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $96\%$ recovery) in Hole U1489D.  

Operations at Site U1489 ended at $0212\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 November . Total time spent at Site U1489 was $131.5~\mathrm{h}$ (5.5 days). We collected  a total of 58 APC cores, recovering $527.85\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $535.4~\mathrm{m}$ o f coring $98.6\%$ recovery). We also collected 2 HLAPC cores, recovering $9.05\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $9.4\:\mathrm{m}$ of coring $(96.3\%$ recovery) and 23 XC B cores, retrieving $198.88\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over $218.3~\mathrm{m}$ of coring $92.6\%$ recovery). In total, we collected $735.78\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment over $763.1\;\mathrm{m}$ o f coring $(96.4\%$ recovery).  

# Principal results  

The recovered sedimentary succession at Site U1489 consists o f ${\sim}386\;\mathrm{m}$ of lower Miocene to recent nannofossil ooze and chalk wit h varying proportions of clay (Figure F24). Biosilica (mainly radiolarians) is a major component in the lowermost part of the site. Th e recovered succession at Site U1489 is assigned to one lithologic uni t divided into two subunits. Subunit IA consists of ${\sim}280~\mathrm{m}$ of uppe r Miocene to recent light greenish gray foraminifer-bearing clay-ric h nannofossil ooze and white clay-bearing foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze, with clay content decreasing downhole. Color alternations occur at the centimeter to meter scale and also include thinl y bedded pale yellow sediment. Grayish green and pale purple laminae are common in the upper part of Subunit IA. Soft-sediment deformation is a prominent feature in the lower part of Subunit I A (between $\mathord{\sim}100$ and $260~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and is characterized by a series o f large-scale soft-sediment deformation intervals intercalated wit h pelagic sediment. These intervals occasionally include coarsegrained foraminifer ooze or very thickly bedded homogeneous claybearing foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze. Subunit IB consists o f ${\sim}112~\mathrm{m}$ of lower to upper Miocene light greenish gray foraminiferbearing clay-rich chalk. Near the base of the subunit, biosilica becomes more abundant and the sediment transitions to pale yello w foraminifer-bearing radiolarian-rich chalk and light gray radiolarian-rich chalk. This subunit also shows color alternations between lighter and darker chalk, as well as minor soft-sedimen t deformation features. There is an abrupt change to white chalk a t the very base of the succession.  

Calcareous microfossil assemblages and preservation are typica l of a pelagic, relatively deepwater bathyal environment throughou t Site U1489. Foraminifer preservation is generally good to very goo d in the upper part of the succession (Subunit IA) but is moderate t o poor in the chalk of Subunit IB. Calcareous nannofossil preservation also decreases with depth, although this is most prevalent i n the discoasters, which show significant overgrowth in the chalk. The planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratio is on the order of 99:1 an d the benthic foraminifers $P_{\star}$ wuellerstorfi and Cibicidoides mundulus are present in most of the samples examined throughout the hole. Other common taxa include Laevidentalina spp.  

Integrated calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminife r biostratigraphy generally shows excellent congruence between bot h fossil groups and the magnetostratigraphy (Figure F25). The age a t the base of the succession is constrained to the early Miocene base d on the biohorizon base Sphenolithus belemnos at $\sim\!380$ mbsf and th e presence of Dentoglobigerina binaiensis and absence of Globigerinoides altiaperturus and Tenuitella munda at $\mathord{\sim}384$ mbsf. The Miocene/Pliocene  boundary  is  placed  at ${\sim}115$ mbsf,  above  th e biohorizon base C. armatus. The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary i s located at ${\sim}45$ mbsf based on the biohorizon top $D.$ . surculus and th e Gauss/Matuyama boundary (Figure F24). Long-term average sedimentation rates through the early to middle Miocene were lo w $({\sim}0.3\mathrm{~cm/ky})$ . Average sedimentation rates in the late Miocene increased to ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . In the latest Miocene and earliest Pliocene, average sedimentation rates increased to ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{\cm/ky}$ ; however, thi s interval is complicated by soft-sediment deformation, and the estimated sedimentation rate is based on sparse bioevents (and n o magnetostratigraphic reversal events). Above this interval of deformed sediment, Pliocene and Pleistocene sedimentation rates average ${\sim}2\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Figure F25), which is comparable to those of th e late Miocene at Site U1488.

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1489 involved measurement of the NRM of archive-half sections from Holes U1489A– U1489D before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ . Corrected declination is largely coherent between cores; however, absolute values in Hole U1489B cluster around $90^{\circ}$ for periods o f normal polarity and around $270^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity, with the opposite being true ( $270^{\circ}$ for normal polarity and $90^{\circ}$ for reverse polarity) in Holes U1489C and U1489D. Relatively soft ferrimagneti c minerals are concentrated in the uppermost ${\sim}90$ mbsf. Between ${\sim}90$ and 100 mbsf, $\mathrm{NRM}_{\mathrm{15mT}}$ , magnetic susceptibility, and SIRM value s decrease, and deeper than ${\sim}100$ mbsf, average magnetic susceptibility, $\mathrm{NRM}_{15\mathrm{mT}},$ and SIRM values are $\mathord{\sim}1\mathrm{-}2$ orders of magnitude lowe r than in the upper ${\sim}90$ mbsf and often approach the noise level o f their respective instruments, indicating a significant reduction i n magnetic mineral concentration deeper than ${\sim}100$ mbsf. We identify as many as twenty-two $180^{\circ}$ shifts in declination in Hole s U1489B–U1489D (Figure F25). The Matuyama/Brunhes boundar y $(0.781\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is placed at ${\sim}15$ mbsf, the Gauss/Matuyama boundar y $(2.581\ \mathrm{Ma})$ at ${\sim}45$ mbsf, and the Gilbert/Gauss boundary (3.59 6

The stratigraphy of the base of Hole U1489C is constrained by biohorizon base Sphenolithus belemnos $19.03\;\mathsf{M a})$ ) and by the presence of Dentoglobigerina binaiensis $(>\uparrow9.30\;\mathsf{M a})$ ) and absence of Globigerinoide s altiaperturus $(>20.03\,\mathsf{M a})$ ) and Tenuitella munda $(<\!20.78\,\mathsf{M a})$ at $\mathord{\sim}380$ mbsf.

Ma) at $\mathord{\sim}65$ mbsf. The deepest of these declination shifts is identified as the upper boundary of the Thvera normal (C3n.3r; 4.997 Ma ) at ${\sim}101$ mbsf (Figure F24).  

All physical property measurements are generally reproducibl e across holes with the exception of some intervals in Hole U1489 B that are likely due to core disturbance during recovery. GRA bul k density increases downhole from ${\sim}1.3$ to $1.8\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , with an increas e in variability deeper than 270 mbsf caused by an increase in sediment induration coincident with the switch to XCB coring. Magnetic susceptibility values are relatively high ( $\sim\!20\times10^{-5}$ to $60\times10^{-5}$ SI) in the upper $90\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , with distinct cyclicity that transitions fro m the $1{-}3\;\mathrm{m}$ scale to the $0.4–0.6\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m}}$ scale at 21 mbsf. Magnetic susceptibility values between 90 and 260 mbsf are extremely low $\langle3\times10^{-5}$ SI) in the light-colored sediment but increase to a mean of $\sim\!9\times10^{-5}$ SI between 260 and 385 mbsf (Figure F24). NGR deceases rapidl y from 30 to 10 counts/s over the upper 5 mbsf and then graduall y decreases to ${<}1$ count/s by the bottom of the site $_{\sim385\mathrm{\mbsf})}$ . Tw o intervals of slightly higher NGR between 55 and 84 mbsf and between 310 and 360 mbsf correspond to higher clay content in th e sediment. In general, the short-term cyclicity in magnetic susceptibility and NGR coincide with light–dark variations in the sediment. In general, $P$ -wave velocity values increase slightly and increase i n variability with depth. Discrete MAD bulk density is offset by ${\sim}0.05$ $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ in the uppermost 265 mbsf compared with GRA bulk density. Below 265 mbsf, where the sediment became indurated and XC B coring commenced, the variability of GRA bulk density increase s and the MAD bulk density values correspond well with the highes t GRA bulk density values. Thermal conductivity increases wit h depth from $\mathord{\sim}0.9$ to $1.3\ \mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ , similar to the trend seen in th e MAD bulk density and dry density, which is likely primarily due t o compaction. Downhole formation temperatures were measured i n both Holes U1489B and U1489D because the APCT-3 tool showe d evidence of movement in some of the measurements taken in Hol e U1489B. The more reliable measurements from Hole U1489D confirm the results from Hole U1489B and indicate a geothermal gradient of $31^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ .  

Stratigraphic correlations between holes at Site U1489 primaril y used WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data and were aided by additional whole-round measurements of GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, NGR, and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ measured on split cores. Overlap between hole s provided two continuous spliced intervals from 0 to $140.95\:\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ and from 305.70 to $371.25\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. The interval between thes e spliced sections corresponds to the interval of soft-sediment deformation in the lower part of Subunit IA that was cored only once. Gaps between an additional five cores deeper than $371.25\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ in both Holes U1489C and U1489D prevented the construction of  a deeper continuous spliced section.  

A total of 100 whole-round samples and one mudline sampl e were collected for interstitial water analysis at Site U1489: 69 samples from Hole U1489B and 32 from Hole U1489C. Because of coring problems and sediment disturbances deeper than ${\sim}90$ mbsf i n Hole U1489B, interstitial water sampling resumed at 88 mbsf i n Hole U1489C and continued to the bottom of the hole $381.8\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ . Small but nonetheless significant offsets are observed in downhol e profiles between the two holes, particularly for Cl, $\mathrm{PO}_{4},$ K, and B, and should be accounted for in future interpretations of the interstitial water profiles. High-resolution sampling was conducted in th e upper $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf at this site with the goal of reconstructing the C l concentration and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ of LCDW during the LGM. Preliminar y shipboard chlorinity measurements suggest that reconstruction o f the salinity of LCDW will be possible with the samples collected a t this site.  

Carbonate diagenesis and minor amounts of organic matte r remineralization are the dominant controls on the interstitial wate r chemistry, along with upward diffusion from a deep fluid source. Muted trends in Ca, Mg, and Li suggest a weaker influence of dee p fluids at this site relative to Site U1488, with chemistry reflective o f basalt–seawater interaction. Differences in basement age and sediment thickness between the two sites likely contribute to the observed differences. Calcium carbonate content averages $82\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ an d increases with depth from ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ near the seafloor to ${>}90\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ a t $\mathord{\sim}175$ mbsf (Figure F24). TOC is low (average $={\sim}0.14\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and varies between 0 and $0.8~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figure F24), which is reflected in th e moderate degree of $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ depletion and low concentrations of Br, ${}\mathrm{NH}_{4}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ . Nitrogen was detected in trace amounts.  

# Site U1490  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1490 (proposed Site WP-02A) is located on the norther n edge of the Eauripik Rise at $05^{\circ}48.95^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $142^{\circ}39.27^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ in $2341\;\mathrm{m}$ wate r depth (Figure F21). The site is situated on seismic Line RR1313- WP2- $1\sim\!3.6\;\mathrm{km}$ east of the intersection with seismic Line RR1313- WP2-6. The seismic profile shows a continuous succession of hemipelagic, carbonate-rich sediment. At Site U1490, horizontally bedded layers continue downsection to ${\sim}0.07$ s TWT below th e seafloor, where reflector geometry shows a dramatic change i n depositional processes. From ${\sim}3.26\$ to ${\sim}3.60~\mathrm{s}$ TWT, an apparentl y uninterrupted accumulation of current-controlled mud waves occurred, with the exception of a possible break at 3.27 s TW T (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Other MCS lines in the survey grid surrounding Site U1490 show these features as well. The wavelength s are ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{km}$ and oriented southwest–northeast (perpendicular t o seismic Line RR1313-WP2-1), with $15{-}18\ \mathrm{m}$ maximum amplitud e that gradually decreases upsection, possibly reflecting a several million–year record of current-controlled bedforms (Baldwin et al., 2017).  

Site U1490 is located ${\sim}431\,\mathrm{km}$ north of Site U1488 at the northern end of the Eauripik Rise (Figure F21), where it terminates in  a tectonically complex region that includes the Sorol Fault, Soro l Trough, and Caroline Ridge (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988). Th e roughly north-south–trending Eauripik Rise is an ${\sim}250~\mathrm{km}$ wid e aseismic ridge that rises ${\sim}1{-}2~\mathrm{km}$ above the surrounding seafloo r and separates the East and West Caroline Basins. Magnetic Anomalies C13–C9 in both basins show that ocean crust formed alon g roughly east–west spreading centers from the Eocene until the lat e Oligocene. Offsets in these anomalies and the lack of magnetic lineations beneath the Eauripik Rise support the interpretation that i t formed as a result of excess submarine volcanism along a leak y north–south transform fault (Hegarty and Weissel, 1988.) An alternative interpretation attributes the formation of the Eauripik Rise t o the northward passage of a mantle hotspot that contributed to th e tectonically and structurally complex region surrounding the Soro l Trough (Bracey, 1975).  

Site U1490 is located ${\sim}6^{\circ}$ north of the Equator and is therefor e suitable for reconstructing the hydrographic history of the norther n part of the WPWP. The comparatively low sedimentation rate a t this site $({\sim}1~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ will be used along with the record from Sit e  

U1488 to reconstruct the evolution of the WPWP since the Miocene. At ${\sim}2300~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the site is bathed by modified UCDW an d therefore may be used to monitor past changes in this water mas s (Figure F5A).  

# Operations  

After a $242\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1489, the vessel stabilize d over Site U1490 at $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 December 2016. The original operations plan at Site U1490 called for two advanced piston corer (APC ) holes to 250 mbsf and a third APC hole to 150 mbsf. With ${\sim}2$ days o f contingency remaining, we opted to deepen Hole U1490A to XC B refusal $382.8~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), core Hole U1490B to HLAPC refusal (292. 9 mbsf), and then use the remaining time to core as deeply as possibl e in Hole U1490C (170.0 mbsf) (Table T1).  

Hole U1490A was cored to 251.2 mbsf (Cores 1H through 27H ) with the APC using orientation and nonmagnetic hardware. Downhole formation temperature measurements using the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) were taken on Cores 4H (32. 7 mbsf), 7H (61.2 mbsf), 10H (89.7 mbsf), 13H (118.2 mbsf), and 16 H (146.7 mbsf), with some movement detected on two of the run s (Cores 4H and 10H). Cores 25H through 27H experienced excessiv e overpull and required drillover to extract them from the formation, indicating APC refusal. We switched to the HLAPC system an d continued coring to 270.0 mbsf (Cores 28F through 31F), where excessive overpull and drillover indicated HLAPC refusal. We the n cored with the XCB to 376.7 mbsf (Cores 32X through 42X). Whil e cutting Core 43X, the rate of penetration slowed dramatically, so w e retrieved the core after only a $5.6\;\mathrm{m}$ advance. The XCB cutting sho e showed extensive wear, and a small amount of chert was recovere d in the bottom of the core. Core 44X advanced only $_{0.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ over 4 5 min, so we terminated coring at 382.8 mbsf. No core was recovered, and the XCB cutting shoe had lost all of its carbide teeth. We collected $367.35\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $382.8\mathrm{~m~}$ of coring $96\%$ recovery) i n Hole U1490A.  

Hole U1490B was cored with the APC system using orientatio n and nonmagnetic hardware to 228.0 mbsf (Cores 1H through 25H). Core 25H required drillover to extract it from the formation, an d the core liner had to be pumped out of the core barrel. We switche d to the HLAPC and continued to core to 262.9 mbsf (Cores 26 F through 33F). We terminated coring in Hole U1490B when Cor e 33F required drillover. We retrieved $267.60\ \mathrm{m}$ of core over $258.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $103\%$ recovery) in Hole U1490B.  

Hole U1490C was cored with the APC system using orientatio n and nonmagnetic hardware to 170 mbsf (Cores 1H through 20H). Coring was terminated when a ground fault was detected in the to p drive motor that could not be repaired within the amount of tim e remaining for coring operations $(\sim\!18~\mathrm{h})$ . The drill bit was pulle d clear of the seafloor at $1017\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 December and retrieved to th e rig floor. The vessel was secured for transit, and we departed fo r Guam at $0542\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December, ending operations at Site U1490.  

A total of $125.75~\mathrm{h}$ (5.2 days) was spent at Site U1490. We collected 69 APC cores, recovering $662.07\mathrm{~m~}$ of core over $641.2~\mathrm{m}$ o f coring $\mathrm{103.3\%}$ recovery) and 11 HLAPC cores, retrieving $53.7\;\mathrm{m}$ o f core over $51.7~\mathrm{m}$ of coring ( $103.9\%$ recovery). We also collected 1 3 XCB cores, recovering $87.42\,\textrm{m}$ of core over $112.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of corin g $(77.5\%$ recovery). Overall core recovery for Site U1490 was 803.1 9 m of sediment over $805.7\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring $99.8\%$ recovery).  

# Transit to Guam  

The $485\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1490 to Guam was completed i n $49.0\;\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $9.9\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The pilot boarded the vessel a t  

$0600~\mathrm{h}$ on 8 December 2016. Expedition 363 ended with the firs t line ashore at the Port of Guam at $0648\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Principal results  

We recovered an ${\sim}380\;\mathrm{m}$ sequence of upper Oligocene to recen t sediment that contains calcareous microfossils (mainly nannofossil s and foraminifers), siliceous microfossils (radiolarians, diatoms, an d sponge spicules), clay minerals, and volcanic ash. The sediment i s assigned to one unit divided into three subunits based primarily o n downhole variations in biosilica, clay minerals, and ash (Figur e F26). Subunit IA $_{\sim185\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick) includes a sequence of upper Miocene to recent foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze with variable bu t generally low amounts of clay. Coarser, decimeter-thick layers dominated by foraminifer ooze are also present. In Subunit IB (late earl y to early late Miocene; ${\sim}78~\mathrm{m}$ thick), clay minerals become a significant component of the sediment, and their abundance increase s downhole. The primary lithology in Subunit IB is clay-rich foraminifer-nannofossil ooze. Biosilica (mainly sponge spicules and radiolarians) is also one of the sediment constituents of this subunit. Subunit IC is ${\sim}124\mathrm{\;m}$ thick and was deposited during the late Oligocene to the middle Miocene. The uppermost ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ of this subuni t is composed of greenish radiolarian-rich nannofossil ooze, wherea s the remainder is radiolarian-rich chalk. Discrete, dark gray to blac k partially indurated layers and nodules and indurated rock fragment s (chert) are exclusively found in this subunit. The number, thickness, and degree of induration of these layers increase downhole. Siliceous particles, either volcanic glass and/or biosilica (radiolarians, sponge spicules, and diatoms), are the dominant lithologic component of these layers, although calcareous components are also occasionally present.  

Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers are presen t throughout the ${\sim}380\mathrm{~m~}$ sequence recovered at Site U1490. Planktonic foraminifer preservation is very good to good for most of th e succession, although it decreases to moderate to poor in the chalk o f Subunit IC, whereas calcareous nannofossil preservation is moderate through most of the succession. Benthic foraminifers indicate  a deepwater environment, and the planktonic/benthic foraminifer ratio is $\mathord{\sim}99{:}1$ throughout the succession. The assemblages are simila r to those from other Eauripik Rise sites (U1488 and U1489). Th e most common species are Laevidentalina spp., $P_{\star}$ wuellerstorfi, an d Oridorsalis umbonatus.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy indicates that the recovered succession spans the latest Oligocene to recent (Figure F27). A series of paleomagnetic reversal s identified in the lower and middle Miocene interval correlate wel l with the biostratigraphic datums. There is no evidence of hiatuses, but the uppermost ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ of the site is complicated because of reworking of calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminife r marker species. The age at the base of the succession is constraine d to ${\sim}24$ Ma based on extrapolation through Oligocene/Miocen e boundary biohorizons and the presence of common Cyclicargolithus abisectus $({\sim}24\,\mathrm{\textbf{Ma}})$ at the base of the hole. The Oligocene/Miocene boundary is placed at $\mathord{\sim}340$ mbsf based on th e presence of Sphenolithus delphix. The Miocene/Pliocene boundar y is located at ${\sim}90$ mbsf between the biohorizon bases C. cristatus and $C.$ . armatus, and the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary is approximated by the biohorizon top $D$ . surculus at ${\sim}35\$ mbsf (Figure F26). The sedimentation rate appears to have been near constant for lon g periods, separated by four inflection points at 3.60, 5.33, 9.11, an d $22.25\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , the last three of which correspond to marked changes i n lithology. Average sedimentation rates were ${\sim}4.7\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the lates t Oligocene, ${\sim}0.88\,\mathrm{~cm/ky}$ in the early and middle Miocene, 1.5 7 $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the late Miocene, $2.9\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the early Pliocene, and 1. 4 $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene (Figure F27).  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1490 involved measurement of the NRM of archive-half sections from Holes U1490A– U1490C before and after demagnetization in a peak AF of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ We measured the entire sediment succession in Hole U1490A bu t ceased measurement between ${\sim}36$ and 161.5 mbsf in Hole U1490 B and below ${\sim}31$ mbsf in Hole U1490C because data quality decreased and became increasingly uninterpretable. Corrected declination is largely coherent between cores; however, absolute value s in Holes U1490A and U1490B cluster around $270^{\circ}$ for periods o f normal polarity and around $90^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity. For Hol e U1490C, no baseline offset was observed and corrected declinatio n during intervals of normal polarity cluster around $0^{\circ}/360^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$ for reversed polarity. In the upper ${\sim}16$ mbsf, WRMSL magnetic susceptibility data and discrete magnetic susceptibility and SIRM values suggest moderately low (ferri)magnetic mineral concentration. Between ${\sim}16$ and 175 mbsf, average magnetic susceptibility data decrease to negative values, associated with the diamagnetic properties of carbonate that dominate the sediment and an almos t complete absence of ferrimagnetic minerals. Below $\mathord{\sim}168$ mbsf, discrete magnetic susceptibility data and SIRM begin to steadily increase, a change associated with greater proportions of clay and as h in the sediment. We identify fifty distinct $\mathrm{\sim}180^{\circ}$ shifts in declinatio n in Holes U1490A–U1490C (Figure F27). We observe five reversal s in  the  youngest  part  of  the  succession,  including  th e Matuyama/Brunhes boundary at ${\sim}8$ mbsf. Deeper than ${\sim}170~\mathrm{mbsf},$ we observe 45 geomagnetic reversals with an almost complete record from the upper boundary of C4An (8.771 Ma; $\mathord{\sim}171$ mbsf) t o the upper boundary of C6n (18.748 Ma; $\mathord{\sim}263$ mbsf) in Hol e U1490B (Figure F26).  

All physical property measurements are generally reproducibl e among the three holes at Site U1490. GRA and discrete sampl e (MAD) bulk density generally agree well in terms of long-ter m trends and short-term variability. The upper 3 mbsf is characterize d by the transition away from the mudline, with a rapid increase i n GRA bulk density and a decrease in NGR (Figure F26). GRA bul k density linearly increases from ${\sim}1.6~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at the top of the hole t o ${\sim}1.9~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ at 230 mbsf, a change related to increased compactio n with depth. Magnetic susceptibility is extremely low between 2 0 and 180 mbsf with an average value around $-0.8\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ that corresponds to light-colored sediment with high carbonate conten t (nannofossil ooze). Magnetic susceptibility increases to ${\sim}7\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity increases from $\mathord{\sim}1500$ to ${\sim}1700~\mathrm{m/s}$ at $\mathord{\sim}180$ mbsf, coincident with increased clay content in Subunit IB. Betwee n 230 and 270 mbsf, a second transition is evident in all of the physical properties, with GRA bulk density decreasing from ${\sim}1.9$ to $\sim\!1.7$ $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ , which coincides with the highest peaks in magnetic susceptibility, with values up to $20\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}.$ . A broad magnetic susceptibilit y maximum with values up to ${\sim}330\,\times\,10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ is concurrent with th e first major peak of ${\sim}8$ counts/s in NGR at ${\sim}255$ mbsf, which coincides with an indurated ash layer. Deeper than 270 mbsf (Subuni t IC), we observe a general increase in the short-term variability of all physical properties, with values ranging from 1.5 to $1.9~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ fo r GRA bulk density, an increase in average magnetic susceptibility t o ${\sim}10\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ with peaks frequently reaching $\sim\!200\times10^{-5}$ to $300~\times$ $10^{-5}$ , NGR values frequently reaching ${\sim}4$ counts/s and occasionall y reaching ${\sim}15$ counts/s in the volcanogenic-rich dark layers, and an increase in $P$ -wave velocity from $\mathord{\sim}1540$ to ${\sim}1960~\mathrm{m/s}$ . This larg e variability is also observed in dry density, grain density, porosity, and thermal conductivity. This interval is associated with the presence of black layers consisting of silica mixed with volcanogeni c material, which become more indurated downhole.

Figure F26. Site U1490 results summary. cps $=$ counts per second.  

Stratigraphic correlation between holes at Site U1490 primaril y used Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) color reflectanc e data, mainly redness $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\right)$ and luminosity $(\mathbb{L}^{*})$ , as well as WRMS L magnetic susceptibility data. In addition, we used WRMSL GR A bulk density and NGR data. We constructed a splice for the entir e site using all three holes. The splice is continuous and well constrained from 0 to $295.95\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF, with the exception of one gap a t $258.01\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ A few tentative tie points should be verified durin g postcruise research.  

A total of 36 whole-round samples and one mudline sampl e were collected from Hole U1490A for interstitial water geochemica l analyses, spanning from 0 to 326 mbsf. Sampling for interstitial water chemistry was halted deeper than 326 mbsf due to biscuitin g and subpar recovery of core. The interstitial water profiles at thi s site indicate relatively weak remineralization of organic matte r throughout the sediment column, supported by observations o f very low TOC content (0 to $1.0\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ ; average of $0.2\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ (Figur e F26). Low dissolved Fe and Mn concentrations in the shallowes t sediment at the site suggest minimal suboxic remineralization of organic matter, and significant $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ $(>21\,\mathrm{\mM})$ is present at depth . High carbonate content $(\sim\!94\mathrm{~wt\%})$ in the upper 230 mbsf (Figur e F26) is associated with a dissolved Sr profile, reflecting a moderat e degree of carbonate recrystallization and/or dissolution. The interstitial water profiles at Site U1490 are dominated by upward diffusion from a deeper fluid source with a geochemical signatur e characteristic of basalt– and/or volcanogenic sediment–seawate r interaction. Marked depletion of Na and enrichment of Ca at thi s site suggest a unique deep fluid source and possible compositional variability of underlying basalt along the Eauripik Rise. Lower an d more variable carbonate content deeper than 230 mbsf coincide s with clay- and radiolarian-rich intervals and the presence of frequent ash layers (Figure F26).

Average sedimentation rates varied from $\mathord{\sim}0.9$ to 5 cm/ky.

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 363 sought to document the regional expression of climate variability (e.g., temperature, precipitation, and productivity) in the IPWP as it relates to the evolution of Earth’s climate from the middle Miocene to late Pleistocene on millennial to geological timescales. To achieve these objectives, we selected sites with a wide geographical distribution and variable depositional environments. The sites are strategically located at the heart of the WPWP, off northern Papua New Guinea and on the Eauripik Rise south of Guam, as well as on its southwestern edge along the northwest margin of Australia to capture the most salient features of the IPWP (Figures F1, F3). Combining sites with rapidly accumulating sediment at marginal locations and more typical open-ocean sites with relatively low accumulation rates offers the opportunity to trace the Neogene evolution of the IPWP at different temporal resolutions. Furthermore, the large range of water depths (Figure F5) allows reconstruction of the thermocline, intermediate, and deepwater contributions from the Northern and Southern Hemisphere to the lowlatitude interocean exchange through the ITF, as well as monitoring changes in intermediate and deeper water exchange in response to tectonic- or climate-related processes.  

Nine sites were cored during Expedition 363, two in the eastern Indian Ocean off northwest Australia and seven in the WPWP (Figures F1, F3). We recovered an IODP record totaling $6956\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment in $875{-}3421\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth with an average recovery of $101.3\%$ during 39.6 days of on-site operations (Table T1). Most of the sites were cored primarily using the APC system until refusal, which was generally encountered between 250 and 350 mbsf (Figure  

F4). One hole on the northwest Australian margin (U1482C) was cored and logged to 534 mbsf. The total expedition recovery is substantially more than the original primary operations plan, which targeted sediment recovery of $6015\;\mathrm{m}$ at seven sites and downhole logging at one site (Rosenthal et al., 2016). Potential security risks in Mindanao, Philippines, precluded us from conducting operations at proposed Site WP-09A in the Davao Bay, offshore South Mindanao; instead, we followed the alternate operations plan that included drilling several additional sites in the WPWP. Two alternate sites at distal locations, proposed Site WP-13A on the Benham Rise (near DSDP Site 292) and proposed Site WP-15A on the Ontong Java Plateau (at the location of ODP Site 806), were not cored due to time limitations. Overall, clement weather and smooth seas allowed for speedy transits to drilling locations, and there was no significant loss of operational time due to mechanical breakdown or equipment damage.  

Our scientific objectives required a wide spatial distribution of IPWP climate records with variable sedimentation rates in a variety of geologic settings. Sites U1482 and U1483 are adjacent to some of the world’s oldest preserved in situ ocean crust, just seaward of the continental slope of northwest Australia. Sites U1484 and U1485 are in a fore-arc region south of the New Guinea Trench. Sites U1486 and U1487 are on upper Pliocene ocean crust of the adjacent Manus Basin in the northern Bismarck Sea. Sites U1488, U1489, and U1490 are located on upper Oligocene ocean crust of the Caroline microplate (Figure F28). The high quality of cores recovered, as well as the extensive documentation of the geologic, biostratigraphic, paleomagnetic, and geochemical background (Figures F29, F30, F31, F32, F33, F34) and the excellent to good preservation of

foraminifer shells and calcareous nannofossils at most sites (Figur e F35), will allow us to meet and even exceed all of the expedition’ s primary objectives.  

# Primary objectives  

1. Investigate millennial-scale climate variability in the WPWP.  

Sites U1484 and U1485 are located ${\sim}15$ and $19\,\mathrm{km}$ , respectively, offshore of the northern coast of Papua New Guinea (Figure F12) i n relatively shallow water depths (1030 and 1145 mbsl, respectively). The proximity to land and to the Sepik/Ramu River mouths result s in high sedimentation rates exceeding $50~\mathrm{cm/ky},$ making the site s suitable for investigating Holocene and late to middle Pleistocen e centennial- to millennial-scale climate variability. Biostratigraph y suggests that ages at Sites U1484 and U1485 extend possibly to $\mathord{\sim}300$ ka and ${\sim}500\ \mathrm{ka}$ , respectively (Figure F30). The sediment primaril y consists of nannofossil-rich clay, with interbedded sand and silt layers (Figure F29). Postcruise research will investigate the timing an d processes responsible for the deposition of sand layers at both sites.  

The sediment is rich in organic matter compared with typical pelagic sediment, with wood fragments visible on split core surfaces, and excellent foraminifer preservation (Figure F35) will provide the opportunity to reconstruct climate variations with  a resolution comparable to that of ice cores, North Atlantic sedimen t drifts, and Southeast Asian speleothem records. These new record s

will allow better constraints of the mechanisms influencing millennial-scale variability and its effects on temperature and precipitation in this region. The recovery of high accumulation rate sections from several previous interglacials (e.g., MIS 5e to MIS 13) and glacials offers the possibility to assess whether Holocene trends are typical of previous interglacials with similar orbital forcings or late Holocene climate was already affected by anthropogenic $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .  

# 2. Reconstruct orbital-scale climate variability through the Neogene.  

All sites cored during Expedition 363 resolve orbital-scale variability at moderate to high resolution (Figure F30). Site U1483 northwest of Australia and Sites U1486 and U1487 in the Manus Basin provide extended upper Pliocene to recent successions at exceptionally high resolution $(6{-}10\ \mathrm{cm/ky})$ for these regions. Site U1482 northwest of Australia and Sites U1488–U1490 on the Eauripik Rise provide lower resolution records over longer timescales. Sites U1482 and U1488 cover the late Miocene at a resolution of $^{3-}$ $6\,\mathrm{{cm}/\mathrm{{ky},}}$ , whereas Sites U1489 and U1490 extend to the middle and early Miocene, respectively, at a resolution of ${\sim}1{-}2\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ . With excellent recovery, these sites are suitable for detailed paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic reconstructions through the middle Miocene to Pleistocene at orbital and suborbital resolution, comparable with records across the Pacific Ocean and in other ocean basins. Specifically,  pairing  of northwest  Australian sites  at  the southwestern edge of the IPWP with sites at the heart of the WPWP will allow us to document the spatial pattern of temperature and precipitation variability in the IPWP under different climate background states in relation to changes in radiative forcing $\mathrm{{CO}_{2}}$ and insolation) to better constrain climate sensitivity throughout the Neogene. Spanning a large bathymetric depth range (Figure F5), these sites are also suitable for reconstructing changes in intermediate and deepwater properties (e.g., temperature and carbonate chemistry) related to the formation processes of these water masses in high-latitude seas, ocean circulation, and ice-volume fluctuations through time.  

The middle to late Miocene is still a poorly constrained interval of the geological timescale, mainly because of incomplete recovery in both marine and land-based sections, which has hampered refinement and verification of astronomical tuning and isotope stratigraphy. Although physical property parameters and bulk isotopes can provide useful high-resolution, local climate records, developing a well-constrained benthic stable isotope chronostratigraphy is essential for the correlation of climatic events on a global scale and anchoring the Neogene geological timescale. The northwest Australian Site U1482 and the Eauripik Rise Sites U1488–U1490 recovered reasonably well preserved, extended upper Miocene sediment successions from multiple holes (Figure F29), allowing construction of uninterrupted splices that have high potential for further calibration of the Neogene timescale. Eauripik Rise Site U1490 additionally has a well-defined shipboard magnetostratigraphy over the ${\sim}9$ to ${\sim}19\ \mathrm{Ma}$ interval (Figure F32), offering an outstanding opportunity to directly correlate magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and benthic isotope cyclostratigraphy over this entire interval.

Summary age-depth relationships for Expedition 363 sites color-coded according to geographic area and summary climate history of the Neogene, including global benthic foraminifer oxygen isotope stack (Zachos et al. 2001). More negative isotope ratios represent warmer deep-water temperature s and/or lower global ice volume. The Middle Miocene Climate Optimum and the early Pliocene Warm Period are highlighted, together with an indication o f Antarctic and Northern Hemisphere ice sheet extent.

3. Reconstruct the Miocene to late Pleistocene evolution of the Australian monsoon.  

The forcing and feedback processes that drive and respond t o short- and long-term variability of the Asian-Australian monsoo n system remain controversial. This controversy is largely due to th e fact that this large-scale, low-latitude climate feature consists of several regional subsystems that are intricately linked through the seasonal migration of the ITCZ but exhibit distinct seasonality o f rainfall and wind patterns in response to different forcings (Figur e F36). Sites U1482 and U1483, located off northwest Australia (Figure F7), are suitable to trace the long-term history of the Australia n monsoon subsystem from the late Miocene to late Pleistocene. Th e influence of the warm Leeuwin Current at these sites (Figure F6 ) and their proximity to land will allow assessment of the Australia n monsoon’s sensitivity to changes in climate boundary condition s such as global ice volume and greenhouse gas concentrations, a s well as regional SST changes. These new climate records will also b e used to investigate the temporal and regional coupling between different monsoonal subsystems and, in particular, the timing of majo r reorganizations in wind (driving upwelling and productivity) an d precipitation (altering salinity and terrigenous runoff) patterns. Th e combined records from Sites U1482 and U1488–U1490 will als o shed light on the synchroneity and repercussions of the late Miocene biogenic blooms through the Pacific and Indian Oceans an d linkages with low- and high-latitude climate change. Furthermore, Expedition 363 will provide a Southern Hemisphere perspective, complementing the overarching goal of several Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program and recent IODP expeditions (Expedition 346: Asian Monsoon, Expedition 353: Indian Monsoon Rainfall, Expedition 355: Arabian Sea Monsoon, Expedition 359: Maldives Monsoon and Sea Level, and Expedition 356: Indonesian Throughflow ) to unravel the evolution and variability of Indo-Asian-Australia n monsoon subsystems over multiple timescales.  

# 4. Reconstruct changes in the ITF through the Neogene.  

At present, ITF variability is strongly related to tropical dynamics and in particular to the seasonal reversal of monsoonal wind s driven by the latitudinal displacement of the ITCZ. However, o n millennial and orbital scales, high-latitude processes and sea level changes might have exerted a major influence on ITF variability. O n longer timescales, tectonically driven constrictions in the Indonesian seaways might have altered the balance between Northern an d Southern Hemisphere–sourced water contributing to the ITF (Figure F6), which in turn could have impacted global climate. In th e

Figure F32. NRM intensity (Int.; blue) and azimuthally corrected declination (Dec.; red) after peak AF demagnetization for Expedition 363 sites. Higher intensity values at Sites U1484–U1487 are influenced by greater terrigenous flux (Sites U1484 and U1485) and volcanogenic inputs (Sites U1486 and U1487). Downhole reductions in intensity, most evident at Sites U1488 and U1489 but also occurring at Sites U1482 and U1483, reflect the influence of sediment diagenesis and the dissolution of magnetite at depth. Where NRM intensity values are low and approach the sensitivity of the magnetometer $\left(1\,0^{-5}\,\mathsf{A}/\mathsf{m}\right)$ , declination becomes increasingly scattered and uninterpretable. In the higher NRM intensity intervals, magnetostratigraphic interpretations are made and age is assigned through correlation of declination to the geomagnetic polarity timescale (Cande and Kent, 1995) of the geologic timescale (Hilgen et al., 2012). This figure is available in an oversized format.

modern ocean, the main ITF transport occurs within the thermocline. Therefore, we expect that comparing changes in the thermocline structure of sites located in the heart of the WPWP, the source region for the ITF, and off northwest Australia/Timor Sea, where the ITF exits into the Indian Ocean, will allow reconstruction of changes in the ITF transport on different timescales. Specifically, records of surface and thermocline temperatures from Sites U1482 (northwest Australia) and U1488 (Eauripik Rise) should allow for distinguishing between broad equatorial responses to global climate change and ITF-related response to the tectonic evolution of the Indonesian seaways from the late Miocene to present. Higher sedimentation rates at Sites U1483 (off northwest Australia) and U1486/U1487 (Manus Basin) will allow for a more detailed reconstruction of ITF variability at orbital and millennial timescales through the entire Pleistocene (Figure F30).  

5. Assess the density structure of the western equatorial Pacific during the LGM.  

Because our sites span a large water depth range (Figure F5), we conducted high-resolution interstitial water sampling (one sample per section) from the seafloor to as deep as 150 mbsf at four Pacific sites. The interstitial water samples will be used to assess the density structure of the western equatorial Pacific during the LGM. Highresolution interstitial water sampling at Sites U1485, U1486, U1488, and U1489 (western equatorial Pacific Ocean) and moderate-resolution sampling at Site U1482 (eastern Indian Ocean) will generate density profiles of intermediate and deep waters during the LGM based on precise $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and chlorinity measurements. Shipboard analyses indicate that Sites U1488 and U1489 are the least affected by exchange reactions with basement rocks and clay minerals and show the expected diffusion profile, making them suitable for this purpose. At the other two sites where high-resolution sampling took place (Sites U1485 and U1486), the upper sections seem to recover the LGM profile, although shipboard measurements suggest that interactions with basement rock and/or clay mineral diagenesis have a strong influence on the lower part of the profiles. Measurements of oxygen and strontium isotopes will help us to understand the basement–sediment interactions and diagenetic processes at these sites.

6. Use interstitial water profiles to reconstruct diagenetic processes and their implications for seawater composition.  

The large variability in the geologic settings and lithologies of Expedition 363 sites provides the opportunity to study diagenetic processes under various depositional conditions. Interstitial water profiles at marginal Sites U1484 and U1485 (off northern Papua New Guinea) and Sites U1486 and U1487 (Manus Basin), which are rich in volcanogenic sediment (Figure F29), are strongly influenced by organic matter remineralization and exchange reactions with basement rocks and clay minerals. The interstitial water samples taken at these sites offer the opportunity for investigating diagenetic processes with emphasis on understanding silicate weathering and dissolution using various isotope systems (e.g., Si, S, Sr, and U isotopes). Splits of interstitial water samples were taken from the pelagic, carbonate-rich sediment at Sites U1488–U1490 for the purpose of reconstructing past seawater chemistry and investigating carbonate diagenesis (e.g., by measuring B, Ca, and $\mathrm{Mg}$ isotopes).  

# Additional highlights Late Miocene to Holocene depositional history of the northwest Australian margin  

The ages assigned to the sedimentary successions recovered at northwest Australian Sites U1482 and U1483 (Figures F9, F11, F30) diverge substantially from previous ages estimated from wireline log data calibrated with stratigraphic and lithologic data from well cuttings (see figures AF5–AF7 and AF9–AF11 in Rosenthal et al., 2016). Following regional seismic projections, we anticipated reaching two prominent reflectors corresponding to (1) a middle Miocene unconformity $({\sim}14\mathrm{~Ma})$ at $\mathord{\sim}500$ mbsf at Site U1482 and (2) a late Miocene unconformity $\left(\sim\!6\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ at ${\sim}250$ mbsf at Site U1482 and at $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf at Site U1483. However, the ages at the base of Sites U1482 $\mathrm{\sim}535\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ and U1483 $({\sim}293\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ are ${\sim}10.5$ and ${<}3.6\,M\mathbf{a}$ , respectively (Figure F30). These ages are considerably younger than was expected at these depths, implying that sedimentation rates in this region differ markedly from previous estimates based on seismic stratigraphy. These new ages will trigger reinterpretation of un

conformities  and  depositional  sequences along  the  northwes t Australian margin. Thus, the records from Sites U1482 and U148 3 have high potential to better constrain the Neogene tectonic an d paleoceanographic evolution of the northwest Australian margin, including the causes for the widespread demise of the reef system.  

# Middle Miocene to Holocene carbonate accumulation in the IPWP  

Calcium carbonate records from the eastern equatorial Pacifi c Ocean document substantial changes in the calcite compensatio n depth (CCD) through the Neogene to the present, suggesting extensive changes in ocean carbonate chemistry (e.g., Pälike et al., 2012). The CCD behaved in a highly dynamic way in the eastern Pacifi c Ocean during the MMCO and was generally shallower during th e late Miocene than at present. In contrast, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ mass accumulation rates in the eastern Indian, western equatorial Pacific, an d southwest Pacific Oceans record higher $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ accumulation rate s during the late Miocene (the so called Miocene “biogenic bloom” ) than at present. We have generated $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ records at a resolution o f three per core to document these changes at the northwest Australian Sites U1482 and U1483 (late Miocene to recent) and the Eauripik Rise Sites U1488 and U1489 (early Miocene to recent) to asses s the regional extent and magnitude of changes in their carbonate records. These data will provide the framework for more detaile d shore-based analyses and regional comparisons. The new record s will help to evaluate changes in the oceanic carbonate budget in relation to ocean circulation and global climate trends through th e Neogene.  

# Late Pliocene Admiralty Islands volcanism  

The sediment succession at Sites U1486 and U1487 in the Manus Basin consists of clay-rich biogenic ooze overlying a thick succession of volcanogenic-rich sediment with multiple centimeter- t o decimeter-thick tephra layers and minor biogenic components (Figures F17, F19, F29). The age at the bottom of the holes, when AP C coring reached or came close to refusal, is ${\sim}2.7~\mathrm{Ma}$ (Figures F18, F20, F30), and the age of the underlying basement is estimated to b e $3.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Taylor, 1979). These sites offer the opportunity to examin e the repercussions of this prolonged and intense period of volcanis m for global climate cooling, both indirectly through the chemical alteration of the fresh basalt and the resulting effect on seawater composition and more directly due to their impact on atmospheri c opacity and greenhouse gases.  

# Intercalibration of biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and isotope stratigraphy  

The calibration of nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer datums, which provide the main biostratigraphic framework over th e Neogene geological timescale, is primarily based on previous drilling in the Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and eastern Pacifi c Ocean. However, these calibrations need to be further expanded t o other oceanic regions to test their global applicability. The mostl y excellent to good preservation of calcareous microfossils in continuous, extended Miocene to Pleistocene sediment successions fro m the northwest Australian Sites U1482 and U1483 and the WPW P Sites U1484–U1490 (Figure F35) will allow high-resolution taxonomic and biostratigraphic studies, as well as detailed correlation o f bioevents with isotope stratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. Thes e sites offer the opportunity to improve the calibration of speciation/extinction events and to test the synchroneity/diachroneity o f bioevents in different ocean basins (Atlantic, Pacific, and India n Oceans). Furthermore, these sites are suitable for investigating gradual or abrupt morphological changes, including coiling change s in planktonic foraminifers, that have the potential for stratigraph y and to explore relationships between evolutionary events an d changing ocean chemistry and circulation through most of the Neogene.
