# Introduction  

This introduction provides an overview of operations, dept h conventions, core handling, curatorial procedures, and analyse s performed on the R/V JOIDES Resolution during Internationa l Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 383. The informatio n applies only to shipboard work described in the Expedition Report s section of the Expedition 383 Proceedings of the Internationa l Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigator s for shore-based analyses of Expedition 383 data will be described i n separate individual postcruise research publications.  

# Site locations  

GPS coordinates (WGS84 datum) from precruise site survey s were used to position the vessel at Expedition 383 sites. A SyQwes t Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloo r depth on the approach to each site to confirm the seafloor dept h once on site. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, the thruster s were lowered and a seafloor positioning beacon was prepared fo r deployment in case it was needed. Dynamic positioning control o f the vessel primarily used navigational input from the GPS (Figur e F1); we did not deploy seafloor beacons during this expedition. Th e final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GP S data collected over a significant portion of the time during whic h the hole was occupied.

Drilling operations  

The advanced piston corer (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), and extended core barrel (XCB) systems were used during Expedition 383 (Figures F2, F3). These tools and other drilling technolog y is documented in Graber et al. (2002).  

The APC and HLAPC systems cut soft-sediment cores wit h minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems. After the APC/HLAPC core barrel is lowered through the drill pip e and lands above the bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until the tw o shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation and cuts the cor e (Figure F2). The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke, ” by observing the pressure gauge on the rig floor because the exces s pressure accumulated prior to the stroke drops rapidly.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in one of two ways: (1) th e piston fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from th e pump pressure and recovery reading) because the formation is to o hard, or (2) excessive force $(>\!60,\!000\,\mathrm{{lb})}$ ) is required to pull the cor e barrel out of the formation. For APC cores that do not achieve a ful l stroke, the next core can be taken after advancing to a depth determined by the recovery of the previous core (advance by recovery) o r to a depth of a full APC core (typically $9.5\textrm{m}$ ). When a full strok e could not be achieved, one or more additional attempts were typically made, and each time the bit was advanced by the length of th e core recovered (note that for these cores, this results in a nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ ). When a full or partial stroke is achieved but excessive force is not able to retrieve the barrel, the core barrel can b e “drilled over,” meaning that after the inner core barrel was successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit was advanced to total depth to free the APC barrel.

Figure F3. XCB system used during Expedition 383 (see Graber et al., 2002).  

The standard APC system uses a $9.5\:\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, wherea s the HLAPC system uses a $4.7\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, the HLAPC was deployed after the standard APC had repeated partial strokes and the core liners were damaged. During use of th e HLAPC system, the refusal criteria for the APC system were applied. Use of the HLAPC system allowed significantly greater AP C sampling depths to be attained than would have otherwise bee n possible.  

The XCB is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe that extends below the large rotary APC/XCB bit (Figure F3). The smalle r bit can cut a semi-indurated core with less torque and fluid circulation than the main bit, potentially improving recovery. The XC B cutting shoe typically extends ${\sim}30.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in sof t sediments, but a spring allows it to retract into the main bit whe n hard formations are encountered. Shorter XCB cutting shoes ca n also  be  used.  The  XCB  system  is  typically  used  when  th e APC/HLAPC system has difficulty penetrating the formatio n and/or damages the core liner or core. The XCB system can also b e used to either initiate holes where the seafloor is not suitable fo r APC coring or interchanged with the APC/HLAPC system whe n dictated by changing formation conditions (e.g., Hole U1544A). Th e XCB system was used to advance holes when HLAPC refusal occurred before the target depth was reached or when drilling conditions required it (e.g., Holes U1540D and U1541B).  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) used for APC and XCB coring is typically composed of an $11\%$ inch $({\sim}29.05~\mathrm{cm)}$ roller-con e drill bit, a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered drill collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch transition drill pipe, and a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extends to the surface.  

The RCB system is a rotary coring system designed to recove r firm to hard sediments and basement rocks (Graber et al., 2002), and it was not used during Expedition 383.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for most APC and HLAP C coring. APC cores were oriented with the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool when coring conditions allowed. Formation temperatur e measurements were taken with the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool (see Downhole measurements). Informatio n on recovered cores, drilled intervals, downhole tool deployments, and related information are provided in the Operations, Paleomagnetism, Physical properties, and Downhole measurements section s of each site chapter.  

# IODP depth conventions  

Primary depth scale types are based on the measurement of dril l string length deployed beneath the rig floor (drilling depth belo w rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]), the lengt h of core recovered (core depth below seafloor [CSF] and cor e composite depth below seafloor [CCSF]), and the length of th e logging wireline deployed (wireline log depth below rig floo r [WRF], wireline log depth below seafloor [WSF], and wireline lo g matched depth below seafloor [WMSF]). All depth units are i n meters. The relationship between scales is defined either by protocol, such  as  the  rules  for  computation  of  CSF  from  DSF,  or  b y combinations  of  protocols  with  user-defined  correlations  (e.g., CCSF). The distinction in nomenclature should keep the user awar e that a nominal depth value at two different depth scales usually doe s not refer to exactly the same stratigraphic interval (see Curatoria l procedures and sample depth calculations). For more informatio n on  depth  scales,  see  “IODP  Depth  Scales  Terminology”  a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines. To more easily communicate shipboard results, CSF-A depths are reported in this volume as meters below seafloor (mbsf) unless otherwise noted.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF scale; Figure F1). The depth of the cored interval is reference d to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth of th e hole from the DRF depth of the interval. Standard depths of cores i n meters below the seafloor (CSF, Method A [CSF-A] scale) are determined based on the assumption that the top depth of a recovere d core corresponds to the top depth of its cored interval (at the DS F scale). Standard depths of samples and associated measurement s (CSF-A scale) are calculated by adding the offset of the sample o r measurement from the top of its section and the lengths of al l higher sections in the core to the top depth of the core.  

If a core has ${<}100\%$ recovery, for curation purposes all core d material is assumed to originate from the top of the drilled interva l as a continuous section. In addition, voids in the core are closed b y pushing core segments together, if possible, during core handling. I f the core pieces can’t be pushed together to close the voids, the n foam spacers are inserted and clearly labeled “void.” Therefore, th e true depth interval within the cored interval is only partially constrained. This should be considered a sampling uncertainty in agedepth analysis or in correlation of core data with downhole loggin g data.  

When core recovery is ${>}100\%$ (the length of the recovered cor e exceeds that of the cored interval), the CSF depth of a sample o r measurement taken from the bottom of a core will be deeper tha n that of a sample or measurement taken from the top of the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated with the two core intervals overlap at the CSF-A scale). This can happen when a soft to semisof t sediment core recovered from a few hundred meters below the seafloor expands upon recovery (typically by a few percent to as muc h as $15\%$ ). Therefore, a stratigraphic interval may not have the sam e nominal depth at the DSF and CSF scales in the same hole.  

During Expedition 383, all core depths below seafloor were initially calculated according to the CSF-A depth scale. Unless otherwise noted, all depths presented are core depths below seafloo r calculated as CSF-A.  

CCSF depth scales are constructed for sites with two or mor e holes to create a stratigraphic record as continuous as possible. Thi s also helps mitigate the CSF-A core overlap problem and the corin g gap problem. Using shipboard core logger–based physical propert y data verified with core photos, core depths in adjacent holes at a sit e are vertically shifted to correlate between cores recovered in adjacent holes. This process produces the CCSF depth scale. The correlation process results in affine tables, indicating the vertical shif t of cores on the CCSF scale relative to the CSF-A scale. Once th e CCSF scale is constructed, a splice can be defined that best represents the stratigraphy of a site by utilizing and splicing the bes t portions of individual sections and cores from each hole. Because o f core expansion, the CCSF depths of stratigraphic intervals are typically $10\%{-}15\%$ deeper than their CSF-A depths. CCSF depth scal e construction also reveals that coring gaps on the order of $1.0{-}1.5\,\mathrm{m}$ typically occur between two subsequent cores despite the apparen t ${>}100\%$ recovery. For more details on construction of the CCS F depth scale, see Stratigraphic correlation.  

# Curatorial procedures and sample depth calculations  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples followed standar d IODP procedure (Figure F1). A full curatorial identifier for a sampl e consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, cor e number, core type, section number, section half, piece numbe r (hard rocks only), and interval in centimeters measured from th e top of the core section. For example, a sample identification of $^{\prime}383.$ - U1539A-2H-5W, $50{-}55\;\mathrm{cm}^{\prime\prime}$ indicates a $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ sample removed fro m the interval between 50 and $55\,\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 5 (working half) of Core 2 ( $^{a}\mathrm{H}^{n}$ designates that this core was taken with th e APC system) of Hole A at Site U1539 during Expedition 383 (Figur e F1). The $\mathrm{^{\omega}U^{\prime}}$ preceding the hole number indicates the hole wa s drilled by the United States IODP platform, JOIDES Resolution. Th e drilling system used to obtain a core is designated in the sampl e identifiers as follows: $\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{APC}$ , $\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{HLAPC},$ , and $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{XCB}$ . Integer s are used to denote the “core” type of drilled intervals (e.g., a drille d interval between Cores 2H and 4H would be noted as Core 31).

ceiving platform (“catwalk”), and a sample was extracted for paleontological (PAL) analysis. Next, the sediment core was extracte d from the core barrel in its plastic liner. The liner was carried fro m the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwalk outside th e core laboratory, where it was split into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections. Blue (uphole direction) and clear (downhole direction) liner caps were glue d with acetone onto the cut liner sections.  

Once the core was cut into sections, whole-round samples wer e taken for interstitial water (IW) chemical analyses. When a wholeround sample was removed, a yellow cap was used identify a wholeround sample had been taken. Syringe samples were taken for ga s analyses according to the IODP hydrocarbon safety monitoring protocol. Syringe and whole-round samples were taken for microbiology contamination testing and postcruise analyses. Toothpic k samples for smear slides were taken from some of the section end s for additional paleontological analysis.  

The core sections were placed in a core rack in the laboratory, core information was entered into the database, and the section s were labeled. When the core sections reached equilibrium with laboratory temperature (typically after $4\,\mathrm{h}$ ), they were run through th e Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) for $P$ -wave velocit y (PWL), magnetic susceptibility (MS), and gamma ray attenuatio n (GRA) bulk density (see Physical properties). The core section s were also run through the Natural Gamma Radiation Logge r (NGRL), and thermal conductivity measurements were taken onc e per core when the material was suitable.  

The core sections were then split lengthwise from bottom to to p into working and archive halves. Investigators should note tha t older material can be transported upward on the split face of eac h section during splitting.  

Discrete samples were then taken for moisture and densit y (MAD) and paleomagnetic (PMAG) analyses and for remainin g shipboard analyses such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), carbonat e (CARB), and inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Samples were not collected when the litholog y was a high-priority interval for expedition or postcruise research, when the core material was unsuitable, or when the core was severely deformed. During the expedition, samples for personal postcruise  research  were  taken  when  they  concerned  ephemeral properties (e.g., IW and amino acid sampling). We also took a limited number of personal or shared “pilot” samples (mostly scrapes ) for two reasons: (1) to find out if an analytical method works an d yields interpretable results, and how much sample is needed, t o guide postcruise sampling, and (2) to generate low spatial resolutio n pilot data sets that can be incorporated in proposals and potentiall y increase their chances of being funded.  

The archive half of each core was scanned on the Section Hal f Imaging Logger (SHIL) to provide line-scan images and then measured for point magnetic susceptibility (MPS) and reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry (RSC) on the Section Half Multisenso r Logger (SHMSL). All of the archive-half core sections were X-ra y imaged. Labeled foam pieces were used to denote missing wholeround intervals in the SHIL images. The archive-half sections wer e then described visually and by means of smear slides for sedimentology. Finally, the magnetization of archive-half sections and working-half  discrete  pieces  was  measured  with  the  cryogeni c magnetometer and spinner magnetometer.  

When all steps were completed, cores were wrapped, sealed i n plastic tubes, and transferred to cold storage space aboard the ship. At the end of the expedition, all the working- and archive-half sections of the cores were sent to the IODP Gulf Coast Repositor y (GCR) in College Station, Texas (USA), where a subset of the archive-half sections were scanned for X-ray fluorescence (XRF) an d samples for postcruise research were taken.  

# Drilling and handling core disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed and contain extraneou s material as a result of the coring and core handling process (Jutzele r et al., 2014). For example, in formations with loose gravel or pebblesized clasts, the clasts from intervals higher in the hole may b e washed down by drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom o f the hole, and be sampled with the next core. The uppermost 10–5 0 cm of each core must therefore be examined critically during description for potential “fall-in.” Common coring-induced deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originall y horizontal bedding. Piston action can result in fluidization (“flowin”) at the bottom of APC cores. The rotation and fluid circulatio n used during XCB and RCB coring can also cause core pieces to rotate relative to each other as well as induce fluids into the cor e and/or cause fluidization and remobilization of poorly consolidated/cemented sediments. In addition, extending APC or HLAP C coring into a deeper, more firm formation can also induce core deformation. Retrieval from depth to the surface can result in elasti c rebound. Gas that is in solution at depth may become free and driv e apart core segments within the liner. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cu t into segments. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the liner, which forces some sediment as well as gas out of the liner. Thes e disturbances are described in each site chapter and graphically indicated on the visual core descriptions (VCDs).  

# Sedimentology  

This section outlines the general procedures for documentin g the sedimentology of cores recovered during Expedition 383 including core description, sediment classification, smear slide preparation and description, X-ray imaging, X-ray diffraction (XRD) of bul k sediment and clay mineral assemblages, and X-ray fluorescence o f section halves. All observations and data were uploaded directl y into the IODP Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS ) using the DESClogik application. DESClogik also includes a graphi c display mode for core data (e.g., digital images of section halves an d measurement data) that was used for quality control of the uploaded data sets.  

# Core preparation and digital color imaging  

Prior to core description and high-resolution digital color imaging, the quality of the split-core surface of the archive half of eac h core was assessed and the surface was scraped lightly with a flexibl e metallic plate or glass microscopic slide. Cleaned core sections wer e then described in conjunction with images obtained using the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL), smear slide analyses, and measurements obtained using the Section Half Multisensor Logge r (SHMSL) (see Physical properties).  

The cleaned archive half was imaged with the SHIL as soon a s possible to avoid sediment color changes caused by oxidation an d drying. In cases of watery or soupy sediment, the surface was allowed to dry sufficiently to avoid light reflection prior to scanning. The SHIL uses three pairs of Advanced Illumination high-curren t focused LED line lights (model CS420) to illuminate the features o f the core. Each of the LED pairs has a color temperature of $6{,}500\;\mathrm{K}$ and emits 200,000 lux at 3 inches. Digital images were taken by a JA I 3CCD line-scan camera (model CV107CL) with a Nikkor $60\ \mathrm{mm}$ AF $1{:}2.8\,\mathrm{D}$ lens at an interval of 10 lines/mm to create a high-resolution TIFF file. The camera height was set so that each pixel image d a $0.1\ \mathrm{mm^{2}}$ section of the core surface; however, actual core widt h per pixel can vary because of slight differences in the section-hal f surface height. A high-resolution JPEG with grayscale and dept h ruler and a low-resolution cropped JPEG showing only the core section surface were created from the high-resolution TIFF files. W e observed that core sections with high carbonate content tended t o overexpose during SHIL imaging. Such sections were reimaged using a lower gain setting only for the purpose of core photos. Not e that all RGB data from Expedition 383 were collected using th e original high gain setting to avoid any RGB data artifacts resultin g from changing gain settings. After acquisition, raw SHIL data wer e processed for core edge and void effects arising from sediment gap s and styrofoam inserts for interstitial water and micropaleontolog y samples. RGB data compromised by nonsediment material were excluded from processed data products. Additional screening for cor e cracks and voids was performed, and RGB data compromised b y cracks or voids were removed from processed data products. Thes e “cleaned” data are used for graphical display only and are not available from the LIMS database but may be obtained from the Sedimentology team.  

# Visual core description  

Macroscopic descriptions of each core section (nominally $_{0-}$ $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ long) were recorded by hand on log sheets that included a n image of the core obtained using the SHIL. All logs were digitall y preserved as PDF files. Sediment color was determined qualitativel y for core intervals using Munsell Soil Color Charts (Munsell Colo r Company, Inc., 2010). Information from hand-annotated visual cor e descriptions (VCDs) for each core section was recorded directl y into the Tabular Data Capture mode of the DESClogik program.  A template was constructed, and tabs and columns were customize d to include relevant descriptive information categories (lithology, sedimentary structures, bioturbation intensity, drilling disturbance, and clast abundance). A summary description was also entered fo r each core.  

A simplified one-page graphical representation of each cor e (VCD) (Figure F5) was generated using the LIMS2Excel applicatio n and a commercial program (Strater, Golden Software). VCDs ar e presented with the core depth below seafloor, Method A (CSF-A), depth scale, split-core photographs, graphic lithology, and column s for core disturbance, sedimentary structures, bioturbation, shipboard samples, gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, magnetic susceptibility (MSP), RGB blue color intensity, and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ colo r reflectance. Graphic lithologies, sedimentary structures, and othe r visual observations are represented on the VCDs using graphic patterns and symbols (Figure F6). Each VCD also contains the summary description for the core. Only major lithologies are shown i n the summary figure for each site chapter.  

![](images/8dfa114fbf902382a08a5470a5d8d4ae10590f722870f82305c2411b152aa433.jpg)  
Smear slides and thin sections  

Smear slide microscopic analysis was used to determine biogenic and terrigenous constituents and abundance to aid in lithologic classification. Toothpick samples were typically taken fro m each lithology at a frequency of at least two samples per core. Fo r these preparations, the sediment was mixed with distilled water o n a glass coverslip or glass slide and dried on a hot plate at $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Th e dried sample was then mounted in Norland optical adhesive Number 61 and fixed in an ultraviolet light box. Smear slides were examined with a transmitted-light petrographic microscope equippe d with a standard eyepiece micrometer. Biogenic and mineral components were identified following standard petrographic techniques a s stated in Rothwell (1989) and Marsaglia et al. (2013, 2015). Several fields of view were examined at $100\times$ , $200\times$ , $400\times$ , and $500\times$ to assess the abundance of detrital, biogenic, and authigenic components. The relative abundance percentages of the sedimentar y constituents were visually estimated using the techniques of Rothwell (1989). The texture of siliciclastic lithologies (e.g., relativ e abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains) and the proportion s and presence of biogenic and mineral components were recorde d on the smear slide worksheet in the microscopic DESClogik template. Components observed in smear slides were categorized as follows:  

![](images/ca10ec73a62b7ec20be06b902328f0a138b385e8bcb5d87874c56e88e4374027.jpg)  
Figure F6. Lithologic key and symbols used for VCDs, Expedition 383.  

• TR $=$ trace $(\le\!1\%)$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(>\!1\%{-}10\%)$ .   
• $C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}25\%)$ ).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!25\%{-}50\%)$ .   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant $(>\!50\%)$ .  

Smear slides provide only a rough estimate of the relative abundance of sediment constituents. Occasionally, the lithologic nam e assigned based on smear slide observation does not match the nam e in the macroscopic lithology description because a small sampl e may not represent the macroscopic description of a much large r sediment interval. Additionally, very fine and coarse grains are difficult to observe in smear slides, and their relative proportions in th e sediment can be affected during slide preparation. Therefore, intervals dominated by sand and larger sized constituents were examined by macroscopic comparison to grain size reference charts. Photomicrographs of some smear slides were taken and uploaded t o the LIMS database. Several thin sections of volcanic glass fragment s were prepared and used to microscopically describe their textur e and petrological properties. Photomicrographs of thin section s were taken and uploaded to the LIMS database.  

# Lithologic classification scheme  

The principal lithologic name was assigned on the basis of th e relative abundances of biogenic and terrigenous clastic grains:  

• The principal name of a sediment with ${<}50\%$ biogenic grains was based on the grain size characteristics of the terrigenous clastic fraction. If the sediment contains no or minor amounts of  

gravel, then the principal name was determined by the relative abundances of sand, silt, and clay (Figure F7; after Mazzullo et al., 1988). • The principal name of a sediment/rock with ${\ge}50\%$ biogenic grains was classified as an ooze and was modified by the most abundant specific biogenic grain type that forms $50\%$ or more of the sediment (Figure F7). For example, if diatoms exceed $50\%$ , then the sediment was classified as a “diatom ooze.” Optionally, similar biogenic grain types were grouped together to exceed this $50\%$ abundance threshold (e.g., if diatoms are $40\%$ of the sediment and sponge spicules are $20\%$ , then the sediment was termed “biosiliceous ooze”).  

Major and minor modifiers were applied to any of the principa l granular sediment/rock names. The use of major and minor modifiers follows the scheme of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 318 (Expedition 318 Scientists, 2011):  

• Minor modifiers (Figure F7) are components with abundances between $10\%$ and $-25\%$ and are indicated by the suffix “-bearing” (e.g., diatom-bearing, silt-bearing).   
• Major modifiers (Figure F7) are components with abundances between $25\%$ and $49\%$ and are indicated by the suffix “-rich” for the biogenic components (e.g., diatom-rich) and by “clayey,” “silty” or “sandy” according to the major terrigenous clastic modifier.   
• If possible, modifiers were assigned based on the most abundant specific grain type (e.g., diatom-rich versus biosilica-rich).

Classification scheme for sediments that are mixtures of pelagic biogenic and terrigenous clastic components (modified from Expedition 318 Scientists, 2011) and ternary diagrams of lithology naming scheme for siliciclastic and biogenic sediment/rock without gravel after Mazzullo et al. (1988) and Dea n et al. (1985).

• Components with abundances ${<}10\%$ were included in the com- abundance in each $\mathrm{\DeltaX}$ -ray image using the categories dominant, ments column in DESClogik (e.g., “with sponge spicule” or “with  abundant, common, rare, and trace and reported these categories i n radiolarians”). the VCDs for this site (see Core descriptions).  

The Wentworth (1922) scale was used to define grain siz e classes. The terms “mixed siliciclastic sediment” and “mixed biogenic ooze” were attributed to intervals of core that contained extreme drilling disturbance usually associated with fall-in and/o r suck-in (see Core disturbance). The terms and associated lithologic symbols in the VCDs were used to avoid inclusion in the splic e (where possible) and sampling.  

# Clast abundance  

Dropstone observations were part of the sediment visual cor e description and provide a preliminary account of the presence an d abundance record of ice-rafted debris (IRD) in the cores. We use d the processed X-ray images to estimate dropstone abundance per Xray image. Each image integrates $12\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ of core, and the dropston e concentration is obtained for the central depth of an image. We assume dropstones appear as dark gray to black very dense define d particles in the X-ray images and counted particles larger than ${\sim}0.5$ mm. Some counting uncertainty may have been introduced by considering spot-like diagenetic iron sulfides as dropstones. Because o f the very high abundance of dropstones at Site U1542 and the shor t period available to process all data, we elected to qualitatively asses s  

# Bioturbation  

Ichnofabric description analysis included evaluation of the extent of bioturbation and notation of distinctive biogenic structures. To assess the degree of bioturbation semiquantitatively, the ichnofabric index from Droser and O’Connell (1992) (from 1 to 5) wa s employed (e.g., $1=$ bioturbation absent, $3=$ moderate bioturbatio n $[10\%{-}40\%$ of the surface], and $5=$ total biogenic homogenization o f sediment). This index is illustrated using the numerical scale in th e Relative bioturbation column of the VCDs (Figure F8).  

# Core disturbance  

Drilling disturbance was classified into four categories:  

• None.   
• Slightly disturbed: bedding contacts are slightly bent.   
• Moderately disturbed: bedding contacts are extremely bowed.   
• Extremely disturbed: bedding is completely deformed and may show diapiric or minor flow structures or is soupy to the degree that the sediments are water saturated and show no traces of original bedding or structure.

When a specific type of drilling disturbance was identified, th e nomenclature of Jutzeler et al. (2014) was used to characterize th e drilling disturbance (Figure F9):  

• Biscuit,   
• Bowed,   
• Brecciated,   
• Crack,   
• Fall-in,   
• Flow-in,   
• Fractured,   
• Gas expansion, • Soupy,   
• Uparching,   
• Washed, and   
• Washed gravel.  

# X-ray diffraction analysis of bulk sediment and clay fraction  

Selected samples for XRD analysis were obtained from th e working halves of the cores at an average spacing of one sample pe r core. When possible, samples were taken adjacent to the carbonat e content and major element samples. XRD analysis was performe d on the clay fraction in most samples. For these preparations, a ${\sim}2~\mathrm{g}$ sample was placed in a $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube with $10\%$ acetic acid, sonicated for $15\,\mathrm{min}$ , and allowed to stand overnight to remove carbonate material. After centrifuging for $15\,\mathrm{min}$ at $1500\;\mathrm{rpm}$ , the acetic acid was decanted, $25\,\mathrm{~mL}$ of distilled water was added, th e sample was centrifuged again, and the water was decanted. Thi s washing procedure was repeated two more times to remove bot h the acid and salts from the sample. After decanting the final wash, $25\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\%$ sodium metaphosphate solution was added to the sample in a $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ beaker. The sample was then placed in an ultrasoni c bath for $5\,\mathrm{{min}}$ to suspend the clays by ultrasonic disaggregation an d then centrifuged for $5\,\mathrm{{min}}$ at $1000\,\mathrm{rpm}$ to settle the ${>}2\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ particles. The clays that remained in suspension were removed from the uppermost ${\sim}1\;\mathrm{cm}$ of the centrifuge tube and pipetted onto two amorphous quartz sample discs. The sample discs were then left to ai r dry in a desiccator. After drying, one disc was analyzed and th e other was solvated with ethylene glycol for ${\sim}8\mathrm{~h~}$ at $65\mathrm{^\circC}$ and analyzed to determine the presence of expandable clays.  

The prepared samples were mounted onto a sample holder an d analyzed by XRD using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor diffractomete r mounted with a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtered $C\mathrm{uK}\alpha$ radiation. The standard locked coupled scan was as follows:  

• Voltage $=35\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
• Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
• Goniometer $\mathrm{scan}=3.5^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}2\Theta$ .   
• Step $\mathrm{size}={\sim}0.0085^{\circ}$ .   
• Scan speed $=1\;{\bf s}/$ step.   
• Divergence slit $=0.3^{\circ}$ .  

The diffractograms of single samples were evaluated with th e Bruker Diffrac-Plus EVA software package. Relative abundances o f the major clay mineral groups were established based on maximu m peak intensity, preferentially from the glycolated analysis. Quantification of mineral contents was not possible because the sample s were not spiked with a defined amount of a mineral standard fo r calibration. Therefore, the shipboard results were interpreted qualitatively based on relative occurrences and abundances of the mos t common clay mineralogical components.  

A small number of selected samples were freeze-dried, ground , and mounted on aluminum holders for bulk XRD analysis. Scans o f these samples were performed with the same instrument settings a s the clay preparations and scanned over a goniometer range of $3.5^{\circ}-$ $70^{\circ}2\theta$ .  

# X-ray imaging  

X-radiograph images were produced from all sites to evaluat e bioturbation intensity, drilling disturbance, sedimentary structures, and clast abundance. Images were obtained from archive-half sections immediately after splitting and imaging. The onboard X-ra y imager (XRI) is composed of a Teledyne ICM CP120B X-ray generator and a detector unit. The generator works with a maximu m voltage of $120\;\mathrm{kV}$ and a tube current of 1 A and has a $0.8\ \mathrm{mm}\times0.5$ mm focal spot. The generator produces a directional cone at a bea m angle of $50^{\circ}\,\times\,50^{\circ}$ . The detector unit is located $65~\,\mathrm{cm}$ from th e source and consists of a Go-Scan $1510~\mathrm{HR}$ system composed of a n array of CMOS sensors arranged to offer an active area of $102\,\mathrm{mm\times}$ $153\;\mathrm{mm}$ and a resolution of $99\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . Core sections were run throug h the imaging area at $12\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals, providing images of $15\;\mathrm{cm}$ ont o the detector and allowing an overlap of $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ .  

![](images/61c1377aad2a131a1a26e47691dc72c5f278f25111e8a3e7611ef7af96b60a29.jpg)  
Figure F9. Annotated examples of types and intensity of coring disturbance index, Expedition 383 (modified from Jutzeler et al., 2014).  

Tests were conducted on archive-half sections to obtain the bes t image resolution for determining the internal structure of cores. The XRI settings were then changed to adjust to the varying lithologies of the cores. The number of images stacked was 20, taken a t exposure times of $300{-}350~\mathrm{ms}$ . The voltage ranged between 60 an d $70\,\mathrm{kV},$ and the current varied from 0.7 to $0.8\;\mathrm{mA}$ .  

The raw images were collected as 16 bit images and were processed with the IODP in-house processing utility in the Integrate d Measurement System (IMS) software (v. 1.3). The software applie s corrections for the detector (gain and offset corrections), compensates for core shape and thickness, and adjusts the image contrast. The Savitzky-Golay FIR filter was chosen to smooth images. The resulting processed images include a masked background, the dept h scale of the section, and the acquisition parameters. The softwar e applies different processing to APC or HLAPC cores and to rotar y cores. Some sections where the processing utility did not give goo d results were reprocessed, first with the LeVay processing softwar e and later with the processing utility.  

# Handheld X-ray fluorescence  

Handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning was performed o n select sections from Site U1540 and U1541 to generate higher resolution element abundance and elemental ratios in bulk sediment. The Olympus Delta Premium handheld XRF device is adapted t o measure K, Ca, Si, Fe, and Mn. Each measurement takes ${\sim}1$ min an d consists of two measurement steps performed with $10\,\mathrm{kV}$ and $_{30\ s}$ integration time for lighter elements and $40\,\mathrm{kV}$ and $_{30\,\mathrm{s}}$ integratio n time for heavier elements. The relative intensity is calculated by internal standard calibrated concentrations. Handheld XRF measurements were conducted to test (1) the comparison bulk sediment  K content derived from NGR and XRF and (2) the relative elemental content changes of Si, Ca, Mn, and Fe in potentially altered sediments from the bottom of Sites U1540 and U1541.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Preliminary shipboard biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental information for Expedition 383 was provided by fossil marine diatoms, radiolarians, silicoflagellates, calcareous nannofossils, planktonic  and  benthic  foraminifers,  and  ostracods.  Shipboard biostratigraphic age assignments were based on analysis of microfossils from mudline and core catcher samples from Hole A at each site. At sites with high recovery or where subsequent holes penetrated deeper strata than Hole A, core catcher samples from Holes B–E were analyzed as necessary to constrain the age of the sequence or as time allowed. Additional toothpick and cylinder samples from split-core sections were analyzed as necessary to refine biostratigraphic boundaries, examine critical intervals, or investigate assemblage composition above and below significant changes in lithology. At least one mudline sample was analyzed for every site to constrain the youngest possible age and to assess the presence of any living benthic microfauna on seafloor. Freeze-dried raw mudline material and ${<}63\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ residue are stored at the IODP Gulf Coast Repository and are available upon request.  

Diatoms, radiolarians, calcareous nannofossils, and planktonic foraminifers provide excellent primary biostratigraphic control for all hemipelagic sites (U1539–U1541 and U1543) and Chilean margin Site U1542, whereas the biostratigraphy of Chilean margin Site U1544 is based solely on diatom and nannofossil occurrences. All microfossil groups aided in characterizing paleoenvironmental conditions such as changes in water masses, water depth, and sea ice presence/absence and identifying intervals of varying marine productivity. Biostratigraphic zonations and the ages of first appearance datums (FADs) and last appearance datums (LADs) of diatoms, radiolarians, and planktonic foraminifers were guided by recent IODP expeditions to the Southern Ocean (e.g., Expeditions 374, 379, and 382) (McKay et al., $2019\mathrm{b}$ ; Gohl et al., 2021b; Weber et al., 2021b) and the 2015 site survey Cruise ANA-05B of the R/V Araon (Ohneiser et al., 2019). Calcareous nannofossil datums were adapted from the biostratigraphic scheme of Expedition 361 (Hall et al., 2017). Biostratigraphic events and biozone boundaries for all late Miocene to recent $({\sim}0{-}8\,\mathrm{Ma})$ intervals cored during Expedition 383 are expressed relative to the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) of Gradstein et al. (2012). Biostratigraphic zonations for microfossil groups are presented individually in the representative sections below (Figure F10).  

Following the convention of recent expeditions (McKay et al., $2019\mathbf{a}$ ; Gohl et al., $2021\mathbf{a}_{\scriptscriptstyle{\perp}}$ ; Weber et al., 2021a), ages assigned to diatom and radiolarian datum levels were guided by the composite ordering  of  events  and  model  age  output  from  constrained optimization (CONOP) analysis of Southern Hemisphere data sets (Cody et al., 2008). Diatom datums follow the Expedition 374 event compilation (Table T1), and additional biostratigraphic information was taken from Harwood and Maruyama (1992), Censarek and Gersonde (2002), Zielinski and Gersonde (2002), Tauxe et al. (2012), Cody et al. (2012), Winter et al. (2012), and Ohneiser et al. (2019). Diatom zonations are adapted from the Miocene–early Pliocene subantarctic zonal scheme of Censarek and Gersonde (2002) and the Pliocene–Pleistocene subantarctic zonal scheme of Zielinski and Gersonde (2002). Radiolarian biostratigraphic zones for the middle Miocene to Pleistocene additionally follow Lazarus (1990, 1992), Florindo et al. (2013), and Ohneiser et al. (2019) (Table T2). Calcareous nannofossil zonation follows the standard schemes o f Martini (1971) and Okada and Bukry (1980), and the calibration o f events is primarily derived from Raffi et al. (2006) and Gradstein e t al. (2012). Ages and calibration sources for calcareous nannofossi l datums are presented in Table T3. Biostratigraphic zones of austra l temperate and subantarctic planktonic foraminifers are based o n Jenkins (1993) and Berggren (1992), and datum ages are derive d from the New Zealand Geological Timescale (Crundwell et al. 2016 ) (Table T4). Correlation to the tropical–subtropical zonation and th e Gradstein et al. (2012) geologic timescale (GTS2012) (Wade et al., 2011) is also provided in Table T4.

Data for each microfossil group are presented in the form o f taxonomic distribution charts that record occurrences withi n each sample examined. Relative abundance and preservation dat a were entered using the DESClogik application into the IOD P LIMS database for all identified microfossil taxa and all paleontological data gathered during shipboard investigations. These dat a are available from the LIMS database in accordance with IOD P policy. Taxonomic occurrence charts also record suspected upsection reworking or otherwise out-of-place species. The first figur e in each Biostratigraphy section in the site chapters presents a summary of biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental informatio n provided by each microfossil group. An age-depth chronostratigraphic composite figure incorporating paleomagnetic data an d showing the locations of unconformities is also provided in eac h site chapter.  

Distribution charts for microfossil groups presented in each sit e chapter are based on shipboard study only. Shipboard biostratigraphic studies focused primarily on the identification of biostratigraphic horizons (biohorizons) in the cores and are biased towar d the reporting of age-diagnostic species and identifying intervals an d ages of reworking. Events reported include the first occurrence (FO ) and/or last occurrence (LO) of a given taxon at a given site and i n some cases the first common occurrence (FCO) or last common occurrence (LCO), events that indicate a change in abundance withi n a taxon’s range and are sometimes more reliable for correlation. Identification of a sequence of biohorizons in stratigraphic order allowed the recognition of biostratigraphic zones and subzones usin g standard schemes. Tables in each site chapter present the depth an d age of important bioevents for use in constructing age-depth plot s in which biostratigraphic information is integrated with the magnetic polarity stratigraphy, if available, to produce an age model fo r each site. These age models are based on preliminary shipboar d data and will be updated postcruise.

# Diatoms  

# Diatom taxonomy  

Taxonomic concepts for Neogene Antarctic diatoms, many o f which are endemic to the southern high latitudes, have develope d largely through the last 45 y of stratigraphic drilling by the Deep Se a Drilling Project (DSDP), Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program in the Southern Ocean and Antarctic shelf (McCollum, 1975; Schrader, 1976; Gombos, 1976; Ciesielski, 1983; Gersonde and Burckle, 1990; Gersonde, 1990, 1991; Fenner, 1991; Baldauf and Barron, 1991; Harwood an d Maruyama, 1992; Mahood and Barron, 1996; Gersonde and Bárcena, 1998; Iwai and Winter, 2002; Censarek and Gersonde, 2002; Zielinski and Gersonde, 2002; Arney et al., 2003; Bohaty et al., 2003; Whitehead and Bohaty, 2003, Taylor-Silva and Riesselman, 2018, Armbrecht et al., 2013). In parallel to the above efforts, ice platfor m drilling on the Antarctic margin recovered neritic diatom floras tha t serve as useful taxonomic references on the Antarctic shelf (Harwood 1986, 1989; Winter and Harwood, 1997; Bohaty et al., 1998; Scherer et al., 2000; Olney et al., 2007, 2009; Winter et al., 2012;  

Riesselman, 2012; Sjunneskog et al., 2012; Riesselman and Dunbar, 2013). Other useful taxonomic references for Neogene and moder n Antarctic marine diatoms include Fenner et al. (1976), Akiba (1982), Harwood et al. (1989), Yanagisawa and Akiba (1990), Medlin an d Priddle (1990), Cremer et al. (2003), and Scott and Thomas (2005).  

# Methods of study for diatoms  

Diatoms and other siliceous and organic-walled microfossil s (endoskeletal dinoflagellates, dinoflagellate cysts [dinocysts], ebridians, chrysophyte cysts, and sponge spicules) were analyzed fro m smear slides and sieved slides. To make smear slides, a toothpic k sample of sediment from the core catcher or another interval wa s mixed with a drop of water and smeared across a $22{\mathrm{~mm}}\times40{\mathrm{~mm}}$ coverslip. Coverslips were dried on a slide warmer, mounted to glas s microscope slides using Norland optical adhesive No. 61 (NOA 61; refractive index $=1.56_{\cdot}$ ), and cured under UV light.  

At Site U1542, where lithology was dominated by silt and cla y particles, diatom valves were diluted to such a degree that marke r taxa were difficult to find in smear slides. At that site, sieved slide s were therefore prepared for all samples with trace or higher diato m abundance to remove clay and concentrate larger valves. About $1\:\mathrm{g}$ of wet sediment was suspended in borax solution for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ an d washed through a $15~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh sieve. The residue was then transferred to a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube, topped off with $10\ \mathrm{mL}$ of deionized water, and left to settle for $1\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . After settling, each tube wa s decanted to $3\;\mathrm{mL}$ , resuspending the biogenic layer at the surface o f the settled sediment column. To prepare slides, a dome of deionize d water was pipetted onto a coverslip on a slide warmer, $1~\mathrm{mL}$ of th e suspended sediment was drawn into a pipette, and two or thre e drops of the suspension were added to the water on the coverslip, which was allowed to dry and mounted as described above.

Samples were examined using a Zeiss Axio Scope.A1 transmitted light microscope. Photomicrographs were taken using a Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Spot digital camera and uploaded to th e LIMS database. Qualitative siliceous microfossil group abundance s were determined from smear slides using $630\times$ magnification. Car e was taken to ensure smear slides were prepared with simila r amounts of sediment. For each sample, the abundance of diatom s was qualitatively estimated by light microscopic observations a t $630\times$ magnification with the examination of five random fields o f view (FOVs) as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( ${>}5$ identifiable valves per FOV).   
• $C=$ common (2–5 identifiable valves per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 identifiable valve in $1{-}5\;\mathrm{FOVs})$ ).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 identifiable valve in $6{-}30\;\mathrm{FOVs}$ ).   
• ${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ trace (very rare valves or diatom fragments).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no diatom valves or fragments observed).

Relative abundances of individual taxa were categorized in reference to their occurrence in FOVs or in reference to a travers e across a $30\,\mathrm{mm}$ wide coverslip $({\sim}55\;\mathrm{FOVs})$ as follows:  

• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant ( ${>}10$ valves per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $^{>5}$ and $^{<10}$ valves FOV).   
• $C=$ common (1 to 5 valves per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 valve in every 10 FOV).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare ${\sqrt{<!5}}$ valves per traverse).   
• ${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ trace ( $_{<1}$ valve per traverse or fragments noted).  

All semiquantitative diatom abundance data produced onboar d were logged in DESClogik. Shipboard observations of diatom assemblages focused on the presence of age-diagnostic species, so th e distribution data do not represent the full diatom assemblage.  

Although the degree of siliceous microfossil fragmentation often mirrors dissolution, the two factors are not always directly correlated.  Diatoms  with  well-preserved  fine  structures  can  b e extensively fragmented resulting from mechanical disturbance suc h as compaction or glacial processes (Scherer et al., 2004). In contrast, dissolution is a wholly chemical process that can influence unbroken frustules (Warnock and Scherer, 2015). Therefore, the preservation of diatoms was assessed independently with regard to th e degree of dissolution and the degree of fragmentation.

The degree of dissolution was assessed qualitatively as follows:  

• $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{low}$ (slight to no apparent dissolution; fine structures preserved).   
• $\mathsf{L}{\mathrm{-}}\mathsf{M}=$ low to moderate.   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (fine structures may be lost).   
• ${\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{-}}{\mathrm{H}}=$ moderate to high.   
• $\mathrm{{H}=\mathrm{{high}}}$ (severe effects of dissolution, including widened areolae and fusion of neighboring areolae, relatively abundant margins and cingula compared with valves, and notably higher proportions of heavily silicified forms).  

The degree of fragmentation was assessed as follows:  

• $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{low}$ ${<}50\%$ of identifiable diatoms are broken).   
• $\mathsf{L}{\mathrm{-}}\mathsf{M}=$ low to moderate.   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate $750\%$ of diatom valves are broken, but most are identifiable).   
• ${\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{-}}{\mathrm{H}}=$ moderate to high.   
• $\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{high}$ (valves highly fragmented and very few complete valves present, hampering identification).  

# Age assignment  

Initial shipboard age assignment of individual Neogene sample s was based on diatom biostratigraphy by applying the biostratigraphic zonation for Southern Ocean sites compiled by David Harwood  for  Expedition  374  (Table  T1),  with  subantarcti c modifications from Zielinski and Gersonde (2002) and Censare k and Gersonde (2002). The Harwood compilation draws extensivel y from Harwood and Maruyama (1992) and Censarek and Gersond e (2002). A wealth of additional biostratigraphic information is available from the drill core–based studies listed in Diatom taxonomy, as well as the integrated biochronological syntheses in the associated volumes for each leg and expedition (e.g., Gersonde et al., 1990; Barron et al., 1991; Harwood et al., 1992). Ages applied to specifi c diatom events and zonal boundaries were guided by successive iterations of the diatom biochronology afforded by CONOP (Cody e t al., 2008, 2012; Florindo et al., 2013) and are in general agreemen t with ages of appearance and extinction of Southern Ocean endemi c planktonic diatoms presented in Barron (2003). Age assignment s for diatom datum levels are presented in Figure F10 and Table T1.  

# Radiolarians  

# Radiolarian taxonomy and zonal schemes  

Radiolarian taxonomic concepts for the late Cenozoic primaril y follow those of Petrushevskaya (1975), Weaver (1983), Nigrini an d Lombari (1984), Lombari and Lazarus (1988), Lazarus (1990, 1992), Caulet (1991), Abelmann (1992), Nigrini and Sanfilippo (2001), an d Vigour and Lazarus (2002). The radiolarian zone scheme for th e Southern Ocean introduced by Lazarus (1990, 1992) and Abelman n (1992) was applied herein, and the composite zonation is shown i n Figure F10.  

The original age estimates for late Cenozoic radiolarian datum s are based on their calibration to magnetostratigraphy according t o Hays and Opdyke (1967), Gersonde et al. (1990), Barron et al. (1991), Caulet (1991), Abelmann (1992), Lazarus (1992), Harwoo d et al. (1992), Shackleton et al. (1995), and Kamikuri et al. (2004). Ag e estimates for radiolarian datums were recalibrated to the GTS2012. Age estimates of radiolarian bioevents for the Southern Ocean ar e presented in Table T2.  

# Methods of study for radiolarians  

A $\mathrm{\sim}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ sediment sample was disaggregated in a beaker containing ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{mL}$ of water by gently warming it on a hot plate in a $10\%$ solution of hydrogen peroxide together with an arbitrary amount o f dilute borax. After effervescence subsided, calcareous component s were dissolved by adding a $10\%$ hydrochloric acid solution, and the n the solution was washed through a $63\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve. Strewn slides wer e prepared by pipetting the residue onto a $22~\mathrm{mm}\,\times\,50~\mathrm{mm}$ microscope coverslip that was dried on a hot plate. Twelve drops of NO A 61 mounting medium was applied to a $25\ \mathrm{mm}\times75\ \mathrm{mm}$ slide. Th e coverslip was then inverted and gently placed on the slide. Th e mounting medium was fixed by placing the slide under a UV lam p for ${\sim}15$ min. Species were identified and their abundances estimated using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with bright field illumination at $100\times$ and $200\times$ magnification. Photomicrographs were take n using a Spot digital camera and uploaded to the LIMS database.  A Hitachi TM3000 tabletop scanning electron microscope (SEM) wa s used for higher magnification micrographs of selected specimens.  

For each sample, the total abundance of radiolarians was qualitatively estimated by light microscopic observations at $100\times$ magnification along one horizontal traverse of the slide and recorded a s follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $>\!100$ specimens/slide traverse).   
• $C=$ common (51–100 specimens/slide traverse).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ frequent (11–50 specimens/slide traverse).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1–10 specimens/slide traverse).   
• $\mathrm{Tr}=$ trace (1–10 specimens per slide).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (absent).  

Shipboard observations of radiolarian assemblages logged i n DESClogik focused on the presence of age-diagnostic species, s o the distribution data do not represent the full radiolarian assemblage. Individual species were recorded as present (P); uncertai n identifications were noted with a question mark (?).  

Preservation of the radiolarian assemblages was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (most specimens complete; fine structures preserved). • $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (minor dissolution and/or breakage). • $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (common dissolution, recrystallization, and/or breakage).  

Silicoflagellate taxonomy follows the systematic summary o f Perch-Nielsen (1985) and updates by Jordan and McCartney (2015). Biozones follow the Southern Ocean silicoflagellate zonation o f Ciesielsky (1975) tied to diatom biozones and paleomagnetic stratigraphy by Ciesielsky and Weaver (1983).  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( $_{>10}$ specimens per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( $^{>5}$ and $^{<10}$ specimens per FOV).   
• $C=$ common (1–5 specimens per FOV).

# Silicoflagellate zonal scheme and taxonomy  

Nannofossil taxonomy follows Bown (1998) and Perch-Nielse n (1985) (Table T3). Bioevent ages were assigned based on the occurrence of calcareous nannofossils (dominant, present, or absent) i n core catcher samples and in additional split core section sample s when necessary.  

# Methods of study for silicoflagellates  

Samples were prepared following standard smear slide techniques and fixed with NOA 61. Silicoflagellate abundance was estimated with a Zeiss Axioskop.A1 polarizing transmitted ligh t microscope at $200\times$ magnification, and specimens were then examined at $1000\times$ for fine-scale taxonomic identification.  

# Silicoflagellates  

The total silicoflagellate abundance within the sediment was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $^{>5}$ specimens per FOV).   
• $C=$ common (2–5 specimens per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per FOV).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen in $6{-}30\;\mathrm{FOVs)}$ .   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no silicoflagellates observed).  

Samples were prepared following standard smear slide techniques and fixed with NOA 61. Calcareous nannofossils were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot polarized light microscope at $1000\times$ magnification. Selected samples were occasionally analyzed using  a SEM (Hitachi tabletop TM3000). Additionally, mudline sample s from the water/seafloor interface were analyzed to assess preservation and biodiversity of recently deposited nannofossils. The mudline suspension was collected in a bucket from which subsample s were taken. Smear slides and stubs were then prepared for SE M analyses. Photomicrographs were taken using the Spot system wit h Image Capture and Spot software as well as with the SEM.  

The total calcareous nannofossil abundance within the sedimen t was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $(\mathrm{>}90\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(50\%-90\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $C=$ common $\underline{{{10\%}}}.50\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $\!\!\:(1\%\!-\!10\%)$ of sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare ${<}1\%$ of sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none present).  

Abundance of individual calcareous nannofossil taxa was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( $>\!100$ specimens per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (10–100 specimens per FOV).   
• $C=$ common (1–10 specimens per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per $1{-}10\,\mathrm{FOVs})$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $\lvert\le\rvert1$ specimen per 10 FOVs).  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils was recorded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ preservation (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization; primary morphological characteristics unaltered or only slightly altered; specimens were identifiable to the species level).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate preservation (specimens exhibit some etching and/or recrystallization; primary morphological characteristics somewhat altered; however, most specimens were identifiable to the species level).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbf{poor}$ preservation (specimens were severely etched or overgrown; primary morphological characteristics largely destroyed; fragmentation has occurred; specimens often could not be identified at the species and/or generic level).  

# Foraminifers Planktonic and benthic foraminifer zonal scheme and taxonomy  

Planktonic foraminifer taxonomic concepts in the Cenozoic selectively follow those of Jenkins (1971), Blow (1979), Kennett an d Srinivasan (1983), Bolli et al. (1985), Toumarkine and Luterbache r (1985), Scott et al. (1990), Pearson (1995), Chaisson and Pearso n (1997), and Olsson et al. (1999). Age estimates for planktonic foraminiferal datums following Gradstein et al. (2012) and additiona l basin-specific dates from Wade et al. (2011) are most appropriat e for sediment intervals deposited under the influence of tropical– subtropical waters. Given the southern high latitude location of Expedition 383 sites, the subantarctic zonal scheme of Berggren (1992; ODP Leg 120, Kerguelen Plateau) and Austral temperate zona l scheme of Jenkins (1993) were preferentially utilized; ages were updated to the GTS2012, and datums by GNS Science (New Zealand ) for planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy (Crundwell et al., 2016 ) were used. The FAD for Truncorotalia crassaformis imbricata wa s added  following  Bylinskaya  (2005),  the  LAD  of  Globoconell a puncticulata puncticuloides is from Hornibrook (1981), and th e FAD of Globoconella inflata follows the date provided by We i (1994) converted to the modern zone. The FAD and LAD for Globorotalia puncticulata were added following Wei (1994) and Scott e t al. (2007). Based on comparisons with the other fossil groups present at our sites, the LADs of Globoconella conomiozea and Hirsutella juanai at Site U1541 best match the dates given by Wei (1994 ) and Chaisson and Pearson (1997), respectively. Ages for planktoni c foraminifer events used here are shown in Figure F10 and Table T4.  

Benthic foraminifer taxonomy systematics for generic assignment follow Loeblich and Tappan (1988). Species identification wa s conducted following Holbourn et al. (2013), Jones and Brady (1994), Thomas  (1990),  and  Nomura  (1995).  Ecological  and  paleobathymetric interpretations are based on a compilation of ecological data including but not limited to van Morkhoven et al., (1986), Singh and Gupta (2004, 2005, 2010), Singh et al. (2012), Verma et al. (2013), and Gupta et al. (2004, 2013). Benthic foraminifers provid e only limited biostratigraphic age control, but they are useful fo r paleobathymetric and paleoenvironmental interpretation. It was assumed that the epifaunal benthic foraminifers that live on surfac e sediments or a few millimeters within the sediments may have generally planoconvex, biconvex, and rounded trochospiral tests or tubular,  coiled  flattened,  milioline,  and  palmate  tests.  Infauna l foraminifers living in the deeper layers of sediment have cylindrica l or flattened tapered, spherical, rounded planispiral, flattened ovoid, globular unilocular, or elongate multilocular tests. Further, the oxic, suboxic, and anoxic species conditions were inferred using th e dominance of species listed in Das et al. (2017). Morphogroup analysis is also used as a proxy for combined oxygenation and food availability in the deep ocean (Jorissen et al., 2007; Das et al., 2017). Antarctic margin species depth information is based on Kennet t (1968), Echols (1971; for agglutinated taxa), Fillon (1974), Anderso n (1975), and Patterson and Ishman (2012). Benthic foraminifer species diversity fluctuates with depth at deeper sites and with glacial– interglacial cycles at shallow sites (Singh and Gupta, 2005; Gupta e t al., 2013). The species diversity index $H$ was calculated using th e Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (Shannon and Wiener, 1949) an d given by the formula  

$$
\mathsf{H}=-\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_{i}\ln p_{i}\,,
$$  

# where  

$S=$ number of species in a given sample, $p_{\mathrm{i}}=$ proportion of the ith species in the sample, and $\ln=$ natural logarithm.  

Paleodepth estimates were based on van Morkhoven et al . (1986) using the following categories:  

• Neritic $=<\!200\,\mathrm{m}$ .   
• Bathyal $=200–2000\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
• Abyssal $=>\!2000\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Methods of study for planktonic and benthic foraminifers  

Roughly $20{-}30~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of sediment from every core catcher wa s washed with tap water over a $63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh sieve to identify the mai n planktonic and benthic foraminifers and datum events. Sample s collected from Chilean margin Site U1543 were first soaked in ta p water and borax to aid washing. Additionally, mudline samples wer e taken from each hole and analyzed for planktonic and benthic foraminifers. Mudline samples were collected by emptying the sediment/water material from the top core liner of the hole into  a bucket and then transferring it to a polyvinyl chloride bottle. A mixture of rose bengal and ethanol solution was added to determin e which specimens had been alive immediately prior to sample collection. The samples were stained for 7–10 days, after which they wer e gently washed over a $63~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ wire mesh sieve, dried in a low-temperature oven at ${\sim}50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and examined under a Zeiss Discovery V 8 stereomicroscope. To avoid contamination of foraminifers betwee n samples, the empty sieves were placed in an ultrasonic bath for several minutes and cleaned with compressed air.  

Samples were split and spread over a microfossil picking tray t o be examined for either planktonic or benthic foraminifers. Planktonic foraminifers were analyzed on the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction, and benthic foraminifers were examined on the ${>}125~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction. When time permitted, the $63{-}125\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction was scanned fo r rare species. Photomicrographs were taken using a Spot syste m with IODP Image Capture and commercial Spot software. We als o used the Hitachi tabletop SEM to create images for verification o f our species assignments and to make photographic plates.  

The dried foraminifer residues were used to estimate the abundance of total planktonic and benthic foraminifers relative to othe r coarse fraction sedimentary components as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant ( $550\%$ of the total coarse fraction particles).   
• $C=$ common $\scriptstyle>25\%-50\%$ of the total coarse fraction particles).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $(5\%-25\%$ of the total coarse fraction particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare ${<}5\%$ of the total coarse fraction particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no examples in the entire sieved sample).  

Because of time constraints, raw samples were not dried an d weighed prior to washing, so we can make only qualitative estimate s of foraminifer abundance relative to other sedimentary components. The relative abundance of planktonic and benthic foraminifer species relative to other members of the foraminifer assemblag e is indicated by the following:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $530\%$ of the planktonic/benthic foraminifer assemblage).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!10\%{-}30\%$ of the planktonic/benthic foraminifer assemblage).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ of the planktonic/benthic foraminifer assemblage).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $.1\%{-5\%}$ of the planktonic/benthic foraminifer assemblage).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present ( ${<}1\%$ of the planktonic/benthic foraminifer assemblage).  

Preservation of planktonic and benthic foraminifers is recorde d as follows:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ ${\sqrt{\it\Delta90\%}}$ of specimens unbroken and only minor evidence of diagenetic alteration).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate $(30\%-90\%$ of specimens are unbroken).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (strongly recrystallized or dominated by fragments and broken or corroded specimens).  

# Ostracods  

Core catcher samples were examined for the presence of ostracods at all sites. Sample preparation and examination for ostraco d assemblage characterization followed the same methods describe d above for foraminifers, and the same sample residues were used. Ostracods were examined from the ${>}125~\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction b y spreading the dry sediment over a metal tray and then picking under a Zeiss Discovery V8 stereomicroscope for taxonomic characterization. Photomicrographs were taken using a Hitachi tableto p SEM to create images for verification of our species assignment s and to make photographic plates. All ostracods present in the samples were picked and identified at all sites except Site U1544, wher e end-of-expedition time constraints did not permit species identification. Ostracod taxonomic assignments follow Whatley et al. (1986), Boomer (1999), Boomer and Whatley (1995), Yasuhara et al. (2013), Stepanova and Lyle (2014), and Alvarez Zarikian (2015).  

Ostracod abundance was defined by the number of valve s (counted as single individuals) per sample as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $_{>50}$ valves).   
• $C=$ common $^{\leftmoon}_{\ast}20\mathrm{-}50\right.$ valves).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (5–20 valves).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare ${\sqrt{<!5}}$ valves).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no specimens in the entire sample).  

Ostracod preservation was estimated using the following definitions:  

• $\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (valves translucent; no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $G=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (valves semitranslucent; little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (common but minor calcite overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, or fragmentation of the valves).  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic studies during Expedition 383 focused on measuring the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) before and afte r alternating field (AF) demagnetization using archive-half core sections and discrete cube samples $({\sim}7~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ ). Remanence measurements and AF demagnetization on archive-half sections were mad e using a computer-controlled (Instrument Measurement Properties, Version 10.2) 2G Enterprises Model-760R-4K superconductin g rock magnetometer (SRM) equipped with direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (DC-SQUIDs) and an in-line, automated AF demagnetizer capable of peak fields of $80~\mathrm{mT}$ . Th e spatial resolution for archive-half section measurements is a function of the integrated response function (following Acton et al., 2017) with effective lengths of $7.30~\mathrm{cm}$ for the $X_{}.$ -axis, $7.30~\mathrm{cm}$ fo r the Y-axis, and $9.00\ \mathrm{cm}$ for the $Z$ -axis. The practical noise level o f the SRM is $\sim\!2\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{Am}^{2}$ , and it is primarily controlled by the magnetization of the core liner and the background magnetization o f the measurement tray.  

NRM measurements of the archive-half sections were made at  2 cm intervals, along with a $14~\mathrm{cm}$ leader and trailer to monitor th e background magnetic moment. Data acquisition was set for no averaging and used fast $10~\mathrm{Hz}$ data filtering with a $250~\mathrm{ms}$ settlin g time, resulting in significant time savings. Experiments employed t o compare these parameters with more standard approaches (averaging three independent measurements and slow $1\ \mathrm{Hz}$ data filterin g with a $1000~\mathrm{{ms}}$ settling time) showed little perceptible difference. We measured the initial NRM and the remanent magnetization remaining after AF demagnetization steps of 5, 10, 15, and occasionally $20~\mathrm{mT}$ peak fields on the first core of each site and until cor e flow dictated faster processing. Low peak fields $\left({<20\;\mathrm{mT}}\right)$ ) were use d at all sites to remove the drill string magnetic overprint and identif y the characteristic remanence while maintaining core flow and preserving the NRM for higher resolution postcruise research. Base d on those observations and needs, a two-step (0, 15, or $20~\mathrm{mT}$ ) o r three-step (0, 10, 15, or $20~\mathrm{mT}$ ) demagnetization sequence was followed for the rest of the site.  

Sample trays were cleaned with deionized water and windo w cleaner at the beginning of every shift, at the start of new holes, o r as deemed necessary. The sample tray was then AF demagnetize d with a peak field of $30~\mathrm{mT}_{i}$ , and its remanence was measured usin g the “Section background” routine to update the background correction values for the empty sample tray.  

One oriented discrete sample per core was collected from th e first complete hole at each site. Discrete samples were collected b y pushing plastic Natsuhara-Giken (“Japanese”) cubes $\mathrm{{2\,cm}}$ external edge length and internal volume of ${\sim}7~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) into working-half sections with the arrow marker on the cube pointing toward the stratigraphic up direction. When the sediment was more indurated,  a hollow metal tube was pushed into the working half and a plunge r was used to extrude the sample into the plastic cube. We typicall y sampled from the center of Section 2, adjusting the location base d on lithology and core disturbance.  

If initial NRM intensities were weak $\mathsf{\left(<}10^{-2}\;\mathrm{A/m}\right)$ , discrete samples were measured on the AGICO JR-6A spinner magnetomete r before and after a manual three-axis AF demagnetization using a DTech AF demagnetizer (Model D-2000). Peak AFs were incremented at 5, 10, 15, 20, (25), 30, 40, (60), and (80) mT. Maximu m peak AF was dependent upon sample behavior or the AF level a t which the remanence intensity dropped below $10\%$ of the NRM. The JR-6A spinner magnetometer was calibrated using the 7.9 9 $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ cube standard with an $8~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ volume. The instrument has  a sensitivity of $\sim\!2\,\times\,10^{-6}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ using Remasoft 3.0 AGICO softwar e control. A holder correction was determined by measuring a n empty Japanese cube inside the rotating specimen holder. If sample s had strong initial NRM intensities $\mathrm{(>}10^{-2}\,\,\mathrm{A/m)}$ , NRM was measured using the SRM on discrete sample mode with in-line AF demagnetization typically at steps of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ .  

# Rock-magnetic analyses  

When time allowed, additional rock magnetic investigation s were used to assess the remanence carriers of NRM. For this purpose, laboratory remanences such as anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) were applied to discrete samples after NR M demagnetization. ARM was imparted using a peak AF of $80~\mathrm{mT_{i}}$ ,  a decay rate of $0.005~\mathrm{mT}$ /half-cycle, and a direct current (DC) bia s field of $0.05\,\mathrm{mT}$ along the sample’s $X_{}.$ -direction using the D-Tech A F demagnetizer.  

# Core collection and orientation  

Cores were collected using nonmagnetic core barrels for th e APC and HLAPC coring systems. The BHA included a Monel (nonmagnetic) drill collar that was required when the Icefield MI5 cor e orientation tool was used and was employed during all APC corin g prior to Site U1544 because it potentially reduces the magnetic fiel d near where the core is cut and within the core barrel.  

The Icefield tool uses three orthogonally mounted fluxgat e magnetometers to record the orientation of the magnetic tool face, which is colinear with the double lines scribed on the core liner wit h respect to magnetic north. The Icefield tool can only be used wit h full-length APC core barrels and was deployed when time constraints allowed.  

# Coordinates  

All magnetic data are reported relative to IODP orientation conventions: $+x$ points into the face of the working half (toward th e “double line”), $+y$ points toward the left side of the working hal f when looking downcore, and $+z$ is downcore. The relationship between the SRM coordinates $(X,\,Y,$ and $Z,$ ) and the sample coordinates $(x,y,$ and z) is $+X=+x,+Y=+y,$ , and $+Z=-z$ for archive halve s and $+X=-x,\,+Y=-y_{:}$ , and $+Z=-z$ for working halves. Data wer e stored using the standard IODP file format and automatically uploaded to the LIMS database using the IMS software for the SR M that was first used during IODP Expedition 362 (McNeill et al., 2017). For discrete samples, positioning in the SRM and the JR-6 A spinner magnetometer can depend upon the collection metho d used (extruder or push-in), which may cause confusion during operation. For this expedition, $+x$ points toward the lid of the cube, which is the same as the push-in method. For the JR-6A spinne r magnetometer, azimuth ${\o}=0$ , dip $=90$ , $\mathrm{P}1=12.$ , $\mathbb{P}2=0$ , $\mathrm{P}3=12$ , an d $\mathrm{P4}\,=\,0$ . The $-z$ arrow points northwest, and the $+x$ arrow point s away from the user (into the holder).  

# Editing archive measurements for coring disturbance  

Sediment disturbance due to coring or geological processe s (downslope processes, faulting, etc.) often leads to distorted an d unreliable paleomagnetic records. The paleomagnetic data in thes e intervals were removed from consideration using evidence provide d from visual core description, X-ray imaging, and other information, which can be automated using PmagPy in the Jupyter noteboo k and/or other methods. These data were systematically filtered a s follows:  

• Measurements within $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ of the section ends were filtered to remove edge effects inherent in all pass-through measurement systems such as the SRM.   
• Data from intervals identified as disturbed during visual core description (see Sedimentology) and/or in the paleomagnetic logbook were excluded during interpretation. These intervals are provided in tables in the site chapters.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Magnetic polarity zones were assigned based on changes in inclination after 15 (or 20) mT peak AF demagnetization. The polarit y stratigraphy of each hole was correlated to the geomagnetic polarit y timescale (GPTS) of the GTS2012 (Gradstein et al., 2012; summarized in Table T5). The GTS2012 includes orbitally tuned reversal s between Chron C1n and the base of Subchron C5r.2n (0–11.65 7 Ma) and between the base of Chron C5ABn and Subchron C5Bn.1 n (13.608–15.215 Ma). The intervals between Chrons C5r.2n an d C5ABn and between C5Bn and C6Cn (11.657–13.608 and 15.215– $23.030\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ , respectively) are calibrated by spline fitting of marin e magnetic anomaly profiles following Lourens et al. (2004) an d Hilgen et al. (2012). We follow the chron terminology of Gradstei n et al. (2012). Stratigraphic correlation enabled assessment of magnetostratigraphic results across holes at each site. Correlation to th e GPTS was assisted by discussion with the shipboard biostratigraph y team.

# Geochemistry  

The Expedition 383 shipboard geochemistry program include d analyses of headspace gases (hydrocarbons), interstitial water (IW ) characteristics and composition (salinity, pH, alkalinity, ammonium, phosphate, silica, and major and minor cations and anions), and bulk sediment composition (total and organic carbon and nitrogen and bulk elemental analysis).  

# Headspace gas geochemistry  

Hydrocarbon gases, namely methane, ethane, and propane, were measured upon retrieval of each core as part of the IODP shipboard hydrocarbon monitoring program to ensure safe drilling procedures.  Headspace  samples  were  collected  from  each  cor e following the methods of Kvenvolden and McDonald (1986). Usin g a brass boring tool, ${\sim}5~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of sediment was collected from Hole  A immediately after retrieval of each core on deck, and other hole s were sampled when depths surpassed those previously drilled. Sediment was then placed in a $21.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass serum vial, sealed with a n aluminum crimp cap fitted with a fluoropolymer septum, and transported to the geochemistry laboratory for headspace gas analyses. The glass serum vial was labeled with the core, section, and interva l from which the sample was collected and placed in an oven at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{min}$ to release hydrocarbon gases from the sediment plug.  

After heating the glass serum sample vial, a gas-tight glass syringe was used to extract headspace gases from the sample. Withi n the headspace, light hydrocarbons including methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, and propylene were quantified by injecting content s of the syringe into an Agilent/HP 6890 Series II gas chromatograp h (GC) equipped with a $2.4\,\mathrm{~m~}\times\,2.00\,\mathrm{~mm}$ stainless steel colum n packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep ${}^{\iota}\mathbf{R}^{\prime\prime}$ and a flame ionization detector (FID). The FID was set to $250^{\circ}C$ . Samples were introduce d into the GC through a $0.25\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample loop connected to the Valc o valve. The valve can be switched automatically to backflush the column. The GC oven temperature was programmed to start at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ , increase to $150^{\circ}C$ for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ at a rate of $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}_{\mathrm{{z}}}$ , an d return to $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ postrun for $15~\mathrm{min}$ . Helium was used as a carrie r gas; it initially flowed into the column at a rate of $30~\mathrm{mL/min}$ an d subsequently ramped to $60\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ after $8.25\,\mathrm{min}$ to accelerate elution of propane and propylene. Data were collected and evaluate d using the Agilent Chemstation software (2001–2006), and chromatographic responses were calibrated against different preanalyzed gas standards with variable quantities of low-molecula r weight hydrocarbons produced by Scott Specialty Gases (Air Liquide). Concentrations of hydrocarbon gases are reported in part s per million by volume (ppmv).  

# Interstitial water chemistry  

IW samples for shipboard determination of salinity, alkalinity , ${\mathsf{p H}},$ , chlorinity, phosphate $(\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\;\;3-})$ , silica, ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}\right)$ , an d major and minor elements were obtained by squeezing $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm}$ whole-round sections cut from cores immediately after core retrieval. Whole-round samples were typically collected at a frequency of three samples per core (i.e., Sections 2, 4, and 6) betwee n 0 and $120\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, two samples per core (i.e., Sections 2 and 5 ) between 120 and $150~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and one sample per core (i.e., Section 4) from $150\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to the bottom of the site. At two sites, whole-round samples were collected at a higher resolution of on e per section in the top two or three cores. After collection, wholeround samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ in bags filled with $\Nu_{2}$ gas until they could be processed. In a nitrogen-filled glove bag, whol e rounds were carefully trimmed with a plastic spatula to remove potential contamination from drilling fluid as well as any sedimen t that was exposed to oxygen. Still in the glove bag, the cleaned sediment rounds were transferred into $^{8}\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ inner diameter titaniu m squeezers that were then placed into Carver hydraulic presse s (Manheim and Sayles, 1974) and squeezed at pressures rangin g from 3,000 to 25,000 force pounds $(1.335\times10^{6}\,\mathrm{N})$ ) depending on th e water content of the sediment and IW retrieval. The squeezed I W was filtered through a $0.45\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ syringe-tip filter and collected in a 6 0 mL acid-washed high-density polyethylene syringe attached to th e squeezing assembly. Sample volume permitting, the IW sample s were split as outlined in the analytical workflow below. Sample volume was generally ${>}20~\mathrm{mL}$ , but if volume was between 20 and $6\,\mathrm{mL}$ , some of the shore-based samples were omitted on a case-by-cas e basis. Any sample volume $<\!6\mathrm{~mL}$ was subjected only to shipboar d analyses.  

The priority list for shipboard analyses and shore-based sample s from IW (from high to low priority) was as follows:  

• Salinity $({\sim}100~\upmu\mathrm{L})$ was determined using optical refractometry immediately after squeezing.   
• pH and alkalinity $\left(\sim\!3\,\mathrm{mL}\right)$ ) were titrated/determined immediately after squeezing.   
• Anions and cations $(\sim\!100\,\upmu\mathrm{L})$ , namely sodium $\left(\mathbf{Na}^{+}\right)$ , potassium $(\mathbf{K}^{+})$ , calcium $(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+})$ , magnesium $(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+})$ , chloride $(\mathbf{Cl^{-}})$ , bromide $\left(\mathbf{B}\mathbf{r}^{-}\right)$ , and sulfate $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ were determined using ion chromatography (IC).   
• Silica $({\sim}200~\upmu\mathrm{L})$ , $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ $\left\langle{\sim}600\,\upmu\mathrm{L}\right\rangle$ , and $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}\left(\mathrm{\sim}200\,\upmu\mathrm{L}\right)$ were determined using spectrophotometry.   
• Major and trace element analyses $\!\!\!\!\sim\!\!2\\\,\mathrm{mL})$ ), namely boron (B), barium (Ba), Ca, copper $(\mathrm{Cu})$ , iron (Fe), K, lanthanum (La), lithium (Li), Mg, manganese $\left(\mathsf{M n}\right)$ , molybdenum (Mo), Na, nickel $\mathrm{(Ni)}$ , rubidium (Rb), sulfur (S), scandium (Sc), silicon (Si), strontium (Sr), titanium (Ti), uranium (U), vanadium (V), yttrium (Y), zinc $(Z\mathfrak{n})$ , and zirconium $(Z\mathbf{r})$ were determined using inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICPOES). (Data produced on the Agilent 5110 ICP-OES were collected in atomic emission spectroscopy [AES] mode and are referred to as “ICP-AES” in the LIMS/LIMS Reports [LORE] database and in this volume.) Samples were preserved by adding 30 $\upmu\mathrm{L}$ concentrated, trace metal clean nitric acid $\mathrm{(HNO}_{3})$ .   
• For shore-based $\delta^{56}\mathrm{Fe}$ and dissolved sulfide (total $\sim\!5\;\mathrm{mL}$ ), Fe isotope samples were preserved in acid-cleaned plastic vials and acidified with trace metal grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to $\mathrm{pH}\!\sim\!2$ . Dissolved sulfide samples were preserved by adding $800~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of zinc acetate (ZnAc).   
• Shore-based samples for chlorinity $\mathrm{5\,mL},$ ) and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ $\mathrm{5\,mL}$ ) were collected in glass vials and subsequently flame sealed.   
• Shore-based samples for dissolved rare earth element (REE) analyses $(\sim\!8\,\mathrm{mL})$ ) were stored in acid-cleaned plastic vials and acidified with optima grade HCl to $\mathrm{pH}\!\sim\!2$ .  

# Shipboard analysis  

Alkalinity, pH, salinity, and chloride  

Salinity of the IW was measured using a Fisher Model S6636 6 refractometer that was calibrated with $18\,{\mathrm{M}}\Omega$ deionized water an d standardized using International Association of Physical Sciences o f the Ocean (IAPSO) standard seawater of known salinity.  

A Metrohm Model 794 Basic Titrino autotitrator was used t o measure alkalinity and pH in the same IW aliquots. The pH wa s first measured with a glass electrode immersed in $3\ \mathrm{mL}$ of constantly stirred IW. Then alkalinity was analyzed by titrating th e same IW sample with $0.1\ M\ H C1$ to an end point $\mathsf{p H}$ of 4.2. Bot h measurements were standardized using an IAPSO standard seawater solution. This standard was analyzed multiple times with ${\sim}2\%$ reproducibility. Here and throughout, reproducibility is given as th e percent relative standard deviation of repeated measurements of  a relevant standard material.  

Chloride concentrations were acquired using a Metrohm 78 5 DMP autotitrator and silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ solution calibrate d against repeated titrations of an IAPSO standard. A $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ aliquo t of sample was diluted with $30\;\mathrm{mL}$ of 0.09 M $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and titrated wit h $0.015\,\mathrm{~M~}$ silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ . Repeated analyses of an IAPS O standard yielded a precision of ${\sim}1\%$ .  

# Ion chromatography  

Concentrations of $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ , $\!\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , ${\mathrm{M}}\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ , $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ , and $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ in th e IW were analyzed by IC using a Metrohm 85 Professional ion chromatograph. Samples were first diluted 1:100 with deionized water. The calibration curve was generated using various dilutions o f IAPSO standard seawater, which was also analyzed several time s during each run for data quality control. As part of quality control, standards were analyzed every 10 samples for each batch run. Thes e standards, analyzed for the entire duration of the expedition, wer e used to calculate reproducibility of the measured ions. The reproducibility was $<\!1.5\%$ for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-},\,\mathrm{Br}^{-}$ , and $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ and $<3.5\%$ for $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ , $\!\mathrm{K}^{+}$ , $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , and $C a^{2+}$ .  

Spectrophotometry (ammonium, phosphate, and silica)  

$\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ , $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ , and dissolved silica were analyzed using an Agilen t Cary 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Analyses of $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ were conducted by phenol diazotization and subsequent oxidization by sodium  hypochlorite $\left(\mathrm{NaClO}\right)$ to  yield  a  blue  color,  measure d spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of $640\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\nm}}$ . Ammoniu m chloride $\left(\mathrm{NH_{4}C l}\right)$ was used for calibration and standardization. Reproducibility of $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ standards was ${\sim}6\%$ .  

$\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ was measured using the ammonium molybdate metho d described by Gieskes et al. (1991) with commensurate dilutions. Approximately $30\,\mathrm{\min}$ following the addition of the mixed reagent, $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ concentration was determined at an absorbance of $885~\mathrm{nm}$ wavelength. The reproducibility for shipboard measurement o f $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ was ${\sim}3\%$ .  

Dissolved silica was measured by reacting samples with ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate solution acidified with HCl to for m molybdosilicic acid. The complex was reduced by ascorbic acid t o form molybdenum blue, which was measured at a wavelength o f $812~\mathrm{nm}$ . Solutions of sodium silicofluoride $\left(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{SiF}_{6}\right)$ at concentrations of $240~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ were used as standards with a reproducibility o f ${\sim}4\%$ .  

Inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy  

Dissolved major (Ca, K, Mg, and Na) and minor (B, Ba, Fe, Li , Mn, P, Si, Sr, and S) elemental concentrations were determined using an Agilent 5110 ICP-OES with a SPS4 autosampler. IW sample s were diluted 1:10 in $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ $(\mathrm{v/v})$ and mixed with an internal standard to correct for drift as well as atomic and ionic interferences. In detail, $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of internal standard solution containing 10 0 ppm beryllium (Be), indium (In), and Sc and $200~\mathrm{ppm}$ antimon y (Sb) was added to $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of IW sample and $4.4\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\%\,\mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ . Fo r calibration, serial dilutions of IAPSO standard seawater $(0\%,\ 1\%,$ $5\%$ , $10\%$ , $25\%$ , $50\%$ , $75\%$ , $100\%$ , and $200\%$ ) were prepared to cove r IW concentrations smaller than or equal to normal seawater. Additional calibration solutions for major and minor element concentrations exceeding that of seawater were prepared with $3.5\%$ sodiu m chloride (NaCl) as a matrix. Calibration solutions for B, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, P, Si, and Sr were mixed with the internal standard i n the same manner as IW samples.  

During each ICP-AES batch run, a complete set of in-house an d IAPSO dilutions were analyzed at the beginning and the end, bracketing sample analyses. Known solutions of in-house standards wer e run every 8–10 samples to monitor instrumental drift, and th e IAPSO standard was run at a similar frequency to monitor accuracy. Reproducibility was better than $1.5\%$ for all elements.  

Comparative analysis of analytical methodologies for interstitial water  

The sampling plan for this expedition generates multiple measurements of the same elements using different methods. Ca, K, Na, and $\mathrm{Mg}$ were measured independently using IC and ICP-AES, Si wa s measured using spectrophotometry and ICP-AES, and $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ was measured using titration and IC. Generally, these data sets are in goo d agreement. Average percent difference between IC and ICP-AES wa s $-4\%$ for K and $\mathrm{Na}$ and ${<}12\%$ for $\mathrm{Mg}$ and Ca. Average percent difference between spectrophotometry and ICP-AES for Si was ${\sim}5\%$ . Average percent difference between titration and IC for $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ was ${\sim}1\%$ .  

# Sedimentary geochemistry  

# Sedimentary inorganic and organic carbon, nitrogen, and carbonate content  

Sediment samples (each about $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ ) were collected from th e working halves of the split cores following identification of majo r lithologies by sedimentologists for on-board bulk sediment analyses. Each sample was freeze-dried for ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{h},$ , crushed to a fine powder using solvent-cleaned agate pestle and mortar, and sampled fo r individual analyses. Average sample resolution was 2–3 samples pe r core.  

Total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents of the sediment samples were determined with a ThermoElectron Corporation FlashEA 1112 CHNS elemental analyzer equipped with  a ThermoElectron packed column CHNS/NCS GC and a therma l conductivity detector (TCD). Approximately $15{-}25~\mathrm{mg}$ of freezedried ground sediment was weighed into a tin cup, but the weighin g method varied slightly between sites. At Sites U1539 and U1540, 1 5 mg of sediment was weighed per sample. At Site U1541, TN concentrations declined below detection limit of the CHNS analyzer, s o a higher mass of $25~\mathrm{mg}$ was weighed for all samples except for 1 0 that were weighed at $15~\mathrm{mg}$ .  

Six of the ten samples that were analyzed with a mass of $15\,\mathrm{mg}$ a t Site U1541 were remeasured with a higher mass of $25~\mathrm{mg}$ . At Site s U1542–U1544, $25~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighed per sample (se e Meth-T1.csv in GEOCHEM in Supplementary material).  

To reduce weighing error in high seas, a counterweight of $25~\mathrm{mg}$ was placed on the tare balance at Sites U1541–U1543 to decreas e the net difference between tare weight and sample weight. Sample s weighed using the counterbalance had a notable reduction in instantaneous standard deviation for a given measurement. Sample s were weighed without a counterbalance at Sites U1539, U1540, U1544, and part of U1541. At Site U1541, 21 samples were run without a counterbalance, and 8 of these samples were remeasured wit h a counterbalance. A comparison between duplicates is recorded i n Meth-T2.csv in GEOCHEM in Supplementary material.  

This difference in methodology at Site U1541 incurs ${<}1\%$ erro r between measurements, and instrumental error accounts for remaining differences in TC/TN between duplicates. Across all sites, standard deviation of internal standards was $\pm0.007\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ for TN an d $\pm0.07\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ for TC, corresponding to a relative standard deviation o f $3.9\%$ for TN and $2\%$ TC.  

Once weighed, samples were introduced automatically in th e system after being loaded into a carousel with a 15 sample capacity. In the system, nitrogen oxides were reduced to $\Nu_{2}$ and the mixtur e of $\Nu_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ gases was separated by gas chromatography an d measured using a TCD. All measurements were calibrated to th e NIST 2704 Buffalo Mountain sediment standard material, whic h was run every 5–10 samples.  

Total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations were determine d using a UIC Inc. CM 5011 $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ coulometer coupled with a UIC Inc. $C\mathrm{M}~5130$ acidification module. An aliquot of around $12\ \mathrm{mg}$ wa s transferred to weighing paper, which was then introduced at the bottom of a glass tube. For Sites U1542 and U1543, around $20~\mathrm{mg}$ o f material was weighed to compensate for the low carbonate content. The glass tube containing the sample capsule was connected to th e acidification module, and 2M HCl was subsequently injected int o the tube, where it reacted with the carbonate fraction of the sediment. Produced $C O_{2}$ gas continuously flowed from the acidificatio n module to the coulometer, where it was absorbed by a solution containing a colorimetric $\mathsf{p H}$ indicator. As $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ was quantitatively an d cumulatively absorbed by the ${\mathsf{p H}}.$ -sensitive solution, the color of th e solution started to fade. A photodetector measured the increase i n transmissivity through the solution. As soon as a change in transmissivity was detected, an electric titration current was proportionall y generated to electrochemically produce a base in the solution tha t neutralized the acidity induced by the constantly added sample $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ .  

Calcium carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ content, expressed as weight percent, was calculated from the TIC content, assuming that all evolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was derived from dissolution of $C a C O_{3}$ , using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%)=\mathrm{TIC}\times8.33(\mathrm{wt}\%).
$$  

Standard $C a C O_{3}$ $^{\leftmoon}{>}99.9\%\;\mathrm{CaCO_{3}};$ Fisher Scientific) was run every 10 samples to check for instrumental accuracy and drift before, during, and after each run. No correction was made for the presence of other carbonate minerals. Relative standard deviation of internal standards was $3.28\%$ for carbonate analyses.  

Total organic carbon (TOC) content was calculated as the difference between TC and TIC:  

$$
\mathrm{TOC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%)=\mathrm{TC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%)-\mathrm{TIC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%).
$$  

# Major and minor elemental analysis  

Major (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, Ti, P, and S) and several minor (Ba, Sr, Zr, Cu, Rb, Mo, Co, Cr, Ni, V, and $Z\mathfrak{n}$ ) elements were analyzed in the bulk sediment using an Agilent 5110 ICP-OES with a n SPS4 autosampler. Several sediment reference materials were analyzed in parallel with the samples to detect sample handling artifacts.  

Homogenized, dried, and ground sediment $(100\,\pm\,0.5~\mathrm{mg})$ wa s placed in a vial and mixed with lithium metaborate $\mathrm{(LiBO_{2})}$ in a 1: 4 sample to $\mathrm{LiBO_{2}}$ ratio $\mathrm{(400\;mg\;LiBO_{2})}$ . This mixture was transferre d to a platinum-gold (Pt-Au) crucible along with $10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $0.172\,\mathrm{M}$ LiBr. Each sample was individually heated for $12\,\mathrm{{min}}$ at $1050^{\circ}C$ in a Bea d Sampler NT-2100 internal-rotating induction furnace. Following fusion, the resulting bead was allowed to cool to room temperature, transferred to an acid-washed high-density polypropylene (HDPE ) Nalgene wide-mouth bottle, and then dissolved in $50~\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\%$ trace metal grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . The bottles were agitated for $90\ \mathrm{min}$ on  a Burrell wrist-action shaker, and then $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ aliquots were diluted i n $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ $2\%$ trace metal grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . Finally, $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of an interna l standard solution $\mathrm{\Delta[100~ppm~Be^{-}}$ , In, and Sc and $200\ \mathrm{ppm}\ \mathrm{Sb}\$ ) wa s added and the samples were analyzed on the ICP-AES. Reproducibility for this method, based on repeated measurement of standar d reference materials, was $-2\%$ for Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, Ti, and V and $+13\%$ for Cr, Sr, P, Rb, and S. Co, Cu, and Ni had reproducibility between $13\%$ and $48\%$ , and the reproducibility for Mo coul d not be calculated because it was not present in the check standard.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property measurements were made during Expeditio n 383 for lithostratigraphic characterization, stratigraphic correlation, and connection of core descriptions to downhole data and primar y seismic reflectors. GRA, magnetic susceptibility (MS), $P$ -wave velocity, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) data were key to generating the first high-resolution continuous data sets for hole-to-hol e and site-to-site stratigraphic correlation, detecting discontinuitie s and inhomogeneities, obtaining information about differences i n the composition and texture of sediment, and identifying majo r seismic reflectors. Discrete measurements for moisture, density, and $P$ -wave velocity were made to check the calibration of thes e data sets. Thermal properties of the recovered material were als o measured and combined with downhole temperature measurements to estimate geothermal heat flow. Specific techniques an d methods used to characterize Expedition 383 cores on wholeround, section half, and discrete samples are described below. Detailed descriptions of methodologies and procedures can be foun d in Blum (1997) and in shipboard user guides available online.  

# General sampling and measurement sequence  

Cores measuring ${\sim}9.5\mathrm{~m~}$ in length were collected and cut int o $1.5\,\textrm{m}$ sections (see Drilling operations and Core handling an d analysis). A core with ${\sim}100\%$ recovery yields six $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections plu s an additional shorter seventh section. All whole-round section s were analyzed with the WRMSL and the NGRL. In addition, fo r holes drilled after Hole A and as requested by the stratigraphic correlators, as soon as catwalk processing and core section sample registration  was  complete,  the  Special  Task  Multisensor  Logge r (STMSL) was used at a $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution to quickly retrieve GRA (1  s acquisition time) and MS (one measurement) data for stratigraphi c correlation. These data were stored as STMSL files to distinguis h between the two different logging data sets. The new 2-D X-ray Imager (XRI) was used later in the core flow to image archive sectio n halves (see $\mathbf{X}$ -ray imaging), but priority was given to using th e STMSL for newly retrieved cores. Usually whole-round section s were equilibrated to $17^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to ensure thermal and barometric homogeneity, protect sensors from damage, and minimize temperatur e effects on MS and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity. The warming rate over $17^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ decreased to $<\!1^{\circ}C$ per hour. This core sequence was adjusted onl y when gas expansion of the sediment was moving sediment withi n the whole-round sections in a way that affected depth-in-sectio n measurements, formed voids, and compromised the integrity of th e sediment as it oozed out the end caps and drilled holes (see Cor e handling and analysis).  

The WRMSL includes a GRA bulk densitometer, an MS loo p sensor, and a compressional $P$ -wave logger (PWL). Whole-roun d sections were typically sampled at a $2.0\ \,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution on th e WRMSL with a $_{3\textbf{s}}$ acquisition time for GRA and three measurements for MS. As WRMSL processing proceeded, the condition o f each whole-round section was noted in the log sheet. Comment s were later entered into the GRA, MS, and PWL data tables using th e following flags:  

• $1=$ coring disturbances such as sediment cracks, and crushed or patched liners;   
• $2=$ liners not filled with sediment, soupy sediment, and/or water or air bubbles present; and   
• $3=$ edge effects such as caused by end caps.  

These flags aided in processing GRA, MS, and PWL data an d can alert future users to potential problems with the data. Whe n cores needed to be split as soon as possible to allow for a larger surface area for gas expansion, the WRMSL resolution was increase d to $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ with one MS measurement and a 1 s GRA acquisition time. (see Core handling and analysis).  

After they were run on the WRMSL, all whole-round section s from all holes were run through the NGRL to collect spectral gamma radiation data at $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution unless core flow time required reducing the resolution to $20~\mathrm{{cm}}$ . When reduced time fo r NGR measurements was required at a site with high terrigenous input, the acquisition time was reduced to $200\,{\sf s}$ . Thermal conductivity was measured on at least one whole-round section per cor e (typically Section 3) after NGRL processing. Sections and/or offset s were chosen that were not watery or soupy, had good contact wit h the liner, and had few cracks. A needle probe was inserted into th e section through a small hole drilled along the split line of the plasti c core liner. Heating powers from 0.3 to $3.0\ \mathrm{W/m}$ were tested in th e first hole. A power of $0.5\:\mathrm{W/m}$ was used for the deep central southern Pacific sites, and a power of $0.7\ \mathrm{W/m}$ was used for the easter n southern Pacific site. For each of the three measurements in a test, the last exponential term and number of solutions was logged. When required by the core flow, thermal conductivity measurements were taken before NGR and the probe hole in the section wa s taped to protect the NGRL.  

Once all whole-round measurements were completed, core sections were split longitudinally. One half was designated as an archive section half; the other half was designated as a workin g section half for sampling and physical properties purposes. X-ra y imaging was performed on the archive section half to determine th e internal structure of the sediments and locate drilling disturbance s (see X-ray imaging). Archive section halves were used for measuring MSP, color reflectance, and colorimetry on the SHMSL, the Bartington MS2 point sensor, and an Ocean Optics spectrophotometer, respectively, at a $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolution. Working section halves underwent $P$ -wave velocity measurements employing the $P$ -wave calipe r (PWC) on the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG). Measurements were made at a resolution of two per core in a variety o f lithologies. Discrete samples were taken for moisture and densit y (MAD) measurements on every section in Hole A at the first sit e and were not taken in subsequent holes at the same site unless th e core depth was not previously sampled. Wet and dry mass, wet an d dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density wer e quantified using the MADMax software. The goal of the MAD sampling distribution was to obtain a representation of all different lithologies  and  transitions  between  lithologies  at  various  depth s throughout the entire site. At subsequent sites, sampling was reduced to two to four measurements per core on the first hole an d subsequently at the same resolution when the core depth was no t previously sampled.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

The WRMSL measures GRA bulk density, MS (on the MSL) , and compressional $P$ -wave velocity logging (on the PWL) (Figure F11). The selected WRMSL sampling intervals were common denominators of the distances between the used sensors $(30{-}50~\mathrm{cm})$ to allow sequential and simultaneous measurements.  

WRMSL measurements were completed on all whole-roun d sections during Expedition 383. Typically, the cores were temperature equilibrated. To optimize the measurement procedure and pro

![](images/06f72cab57f658b0413c1d2f2c54ea71c4f4f0852a4e29803fd8d9b509719b85.jpg)  

vide consistency, the sampling intervals and measurement time s were the same for all sensors on each instrument. In this way, al l sensors measure simultaneously and idle periods are avoided.  A sampling resolution of $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ was generally considered appropriat e for stratigraphic correlation and integration with seismic profile s and allowed for efficient core flow. A $3\ \mathrm{cm}$ resolution was use d when faster core flow was required. Once the measurements wer e finalized for the last section of the core, a deionized water standar d was run through all instruments to keep them calibrated and assur e quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC). The instruments underwent recalibration if the measured standard values deviate d from the range of published tolerances (Blum, 1997).  

# Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

The GRA bulk density instrument is used to measure the wholeround section at discrete and equidistant intervals to provide an average density value. It measures the attenuation of a directe d gamma ray beam through the core. This beam is produced by a $^{137}\!C s$ gamma ray source at $370\ \mathrm{MBq}$ of radiation and an energy level o f $660\ {\mathrm{KeV}}.$ The source is mounted directly above the whole-roun d core track in a lead shield with a $5\,\mathrm{mm}$ collimator at the bottom. Th e beam is directed downward toward the core section during measurement. A scintillation detector with an integrated photomultiplier tube is mounted underneath the core track (and opposite th e $^{137}\!C s$ source) and measures the gamma radiation that passe s through the core sections. The GRA bulk density instrument operates with medium-energy gamma rays $(0.1{-}1\ \mathrm{MeV})$ that interac t with the material of the formation using Compton scattering. Th e measured electron density of the scattering is then used to estimat e the bulk density of the material. For a known thickness of sample, the density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of the attenuate d gamma rays:  

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I/I_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$I=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$I_{0}=\mathrm{gamma}$ ray source intensity,  

# $\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and $d=$ sample diameter.  

$\upmu$ and $I_{0}$ are constants, and $\uprho$ is then calculated from I. The bul k density provided by the GRA is related to the porosity, grain size, consolidation state, mineral composition, and any disturbances o r contrasts present in the formation.  

Generally, GRA bulk density measurements are most accurat e when the core liner is completely filled and has minimal drilling disturbance, cracks, voids, or double liners. Otherwise, measurement s tend to underestimate the true values. The GRA instrument estimates bulk density values based on an internal core diameter of 6 6 mm, which is appropriate for most sediment cores obtained usin g the APC and HLAPC systems. The GRA densitometer is calibrate d with specific calibration cores, one standard core liner filled wit h distilled water, and aluminum cylinders of various diameters (Blum, 1997). The spatial resolution is less than $\pm1\,\mathrm{cm}$ . The instrument wa s recalibrated when the deionized water QA/QC standard deviate d significantly $(>\!2\%)$ from $1~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Additional postprocessing of th e GRA measurements was needed to remove edge effects and singl e data spikes caused by voids or cracks in the core liner. Any value s $<\!1.12\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were also removed. Unreliable measurements that result when the sediment does not fill the core along several to tens o f centimeters, as often occurs in the first section of a core, were als o removed. We flagged the data as indicated above in General sampling and measurement sequence.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

MS was acquired for all whole-round sections using a passthrough loop on the WRMSL. MS $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless paramete r in the metric system that indicates the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic field. $\Upsilon$ is a relative indicator for changes in the formation composition that can also be related to paleoclimate-controlled depositional events or processes. MS is acquired at very low fields generally not exceeding $0.5~\mathrm{mT}$ . Volume susceptibility is defined as  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by the external field of strength $H.$ Accordingly, MS is most sensitive to formations containing high concentrations of ferromagnetic mineral s such as magnetite, pyrite, hematite, and various other iron oxides. In addition, χ can also be related to the origin of the materials in th e core and their subsequent diagenesis. Ferromagnetic minerals ar e characterized by MS values several orders of magnitude higher tha n their alteration products. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic mineral s (e.g., calcite, halite, water, quartz, and plastic) present very small o r even negative MS values. Therefore, calcareous and siliceous biogenic deposits often have values close to the detection limit of th e instrument itself.  

All MS measurements on the WRMSL were taken by a Bartington MS2C loop sensor with a $90\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter. An oscillator circui t in the sensor operates at a frequency of $565\;\mathrm{Hz}$ to avoid any potential interference between instruments, with an automatic softwar e correction factor of 1.174 and a ${\sim}140\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ alternating field. This alternating field is responsible for a low-intensity, nonsaturated alternating magnetic field. Sediment core sections passing through th e influence of this field cause a change in oscillator frequency. Frequency information is returned in pulse form to the susceptometer, and the MS value is estimated. The spatial resolution of the sensor i s  

$20~\mathrm{mm}$ with an accuracy of $2\%$ (Blum, 1997). The output provide d by the sensor is dimensionless in instrument units (IU), equivalen t to $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ units. Estimated values are computed as the mean of thre e discrete measurements in the same location. MS values in text an d figures in this volume are expressed in instrument units unless otherwise noted. Instrument drift should be considered because it ca n occur during the period of a core section scan. The instrument wa s automatically zeroed at the beginning of each run, and a zero-background measurement was taken at the end of each core section t o correct for this drift. All acquired MS data needed postprocessin g to remove edge effects and single data spikes caused by large void s and metal drill fragments, among others. We then flagged the dat a as indicated in General sampling and measurement sequence.  

# Compressional P-wave velocity  

Compressional $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity was acquired for each wholeround section using the PWL. $P$ -wave velocity depends on the lithology, porosity, and bulk density of the formation, as well as the stat e of stress, lithostatic pressure, and/or fabric or degree of fracturin g within the material. The degree of consolidation and lithificatio n and the occurrence and abundance of free gas also control the velocity. The acoustic impedance and reflection coefficients are obtained using the $P$ -wave velocity together with the density values. These parameters can be used to derive synthetic seismograms, which in turn can be used estimate the depth of the main reflector s observed in seismic profiles. $P$ -wave velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is defined by th e time required for a compressional wave to travel a specific distance,  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $^d$ is the length that the wave crosses (i.e., the core section ) and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is the traveltime through the core.  

For $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements using the PWL, the core section is placed between two piezoelectric transducers (a transmitte r and a receiver) mounted in stainless-steel housings. Acoustic coupling through an epoxy resin surface is enhanced by a water fil m supplied by an automated drip system. A $500{\mathrm{-kHz}}$ pulse $2\,\upmu\mathrm{s}$ wav e period; $120\;\mathrm{V}]$ ) is produced at a frequency of $1\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and sent to th e transmitter transducer, which generates an ultrasonic compressional pulse at about $500\;\mathrm{kHz}$ (pulse timing is measured with a resolution of $50\,\mathrm{\ns})$ ). Pressure is applied to the actuators to ensur e coupling between the transducers and the core liner, and the automated drip system maintains wet contacts on the transducers to ensure a reliable coupling is always established. The compressional $P_{-}$ - wave propagates horizontally through the core and is received b y the receiver transducer on the opposite side. Velocity is amplified b y an automatic gain control amplifier to produce the received signal. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity transducers measure total traveltime of the compressional wave between transducers. A calibration of the PWL accounts for errors in the total distance $(d_{\mathrm{total}})$ and the total traveltim e $\left(t_{\mathrm{total}}\right)$ . Errors in $d_{\mathrm{total}}$ were assumed to be related to the laser distance. The obtained discrete data is the average of 100 discrete measurements at the set interval.  

A core liner of assumed thickness (L) covered each core sectio n for all measurements. The traveltime through the core liner $\left(t_{\mathrm{liner}}\right)$ was determined by measuring the total traveltime through a cor e liner filled with distilled water with velocity of ${\sim}1480\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . A correction $\langle{t_{\mathrm{delay}}};$ system delay) was measured using the traveltime throug h a standard block of aluminum with a known thickness and a published velocity of $6295~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Arrival time picks were chosen at th e inflection point of the second lobe of the waveform, giving a secon d correction $(t_{p u l s e})$ from the first arrival. Then, $t_{\mathrm{pulse}}$ and $t_{\mathrm{delay}}$ wer e combined and named $t_{\mathrm{total\_delay}}$ . Therefore, the velocity is compute d as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{total}}-\mathrm{2L})/(t_{\mathrm{total}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}-t_{\mathrm{total}_{-}\mathrm{delay}}),
$$  

where  

$V_{\mathrm{p}}=$ core velocity $\left(\mathbf{k}/\mathbf{s}\right)$ ,   
$d_{\mathrm{total}}=$ measured diameter of the core and the liner (mm),   
$L=$ wall thickness of the liner $(\mathrm{mm})$ ,   
$t_{\mathrm{total}}=$ total time for the pulse to travel through the core and the liner (μs),   
$t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ traveltime through the liner $\left(\upmu\mathrm{s}\right)$ , and   
$t_{\mathrm{total\_delay}}=$ delay related to the combined transducer faces, electronic circuitry, and peak detection procedures (μs).  

The $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ equation above assumes that the core completely fills th e core liner and that there are no gaps or air present. Any measured $P$ - wave signal can degenerate because of an incompletely filled cor e liner, any present voids or cracks, or attenuation caused by microcracks that formed during core recovery. This degeneration is partl y reflected in the gain (signal strength) factor applied to the original signal by the automated gain control. However, signal strength ca n also be affected by the grain size of the sediment, so low-strengt h signals cannot simply be interpreted as proportional to attenuation. Additional postprocessing of the $P$ -wave measurements was neede d to remove edge effects. Single data spikes caused by voids or crack s in the core liner and any values ${<}1460$ were also removed. The upper measurement limit was adjusted according to the site. We the n flagged the data as indicated in General sampling and measurement sequence.  

# Natural Gamma Radiation Logger measurements  

The NGRL measures NGR on whole-round sections using a system designed by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program US Implementing Organization (USIO) at Texas A&M University, US A (Vasiliev et al., 2011). This instrument measures the cumulative radiation emitted during natural decay of three long-lived radioisotopes, potassium (40K), thorium $(^{232}\mathrm{{Th})}$ , and uranium $^{(238}\mathrm{U})$ , whic h have half-lives of $1.3\times10^{9}$ , $1.4\times10^{10}_{\phantom{1}}$ , and $4.4\times10^{9}\:\mathrm{y},$ respectively. These isotopes and their daughter products emit gamma radiatio n at specific energy levels unique to each isotope. NGR is used to estimate the abundance of each isotope based on the strength of th e signal at characteristic energies (Blum, 1997; Gilmore, 2008). In sediments and sedimentary rocks, Th and K are usually associated wit h particular clay minerals, whereas U is often encountered in eithe r clay minerals or organic-rich material (Dunlea et al., 2013). Hig h counts generally reflect the presence of fine-grained deposits, an d relative changes are indicative of stratigraphic details and aid i n core-to-core, core-to-wireline log data, and/or borehole correlations between holes.  

The NGR system consists of eight sodium iodide (NaI) detector s arranged along the core measurement axis at $20~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals surrounding the lower half of the section (Figure F12). The detecto r array is fit with both passive (layers of lead) and active (plastic scintillators) shielding to reduce the background environmental an d cosmic radiation. The overlying plastic scintillators detect incomin g high-energy gamma and muon cosmic radiation above $3~\mathrm{MeV}$ an d cancel this signal from the total counted by the NaI detectors.  

The quality of the core measurements depends on the concentration of radionuclides and the counting time. For Expedition 383,  

Figure F12. Equipment used to measure natural gamma radiation. A. Natura l Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL). B. Interior of the NGRL, with sodiu m iodide (NAI) detectors and photomultiplier tubes.  

![](images/57641fdfbcc132bc1d3361140f44cf87648861db71b5e0e4342f5df71cc20d0b.jpg)  

the measurement run began with two sample positions $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ apar t and a counting period of $300{\mathrm{~s~}}$ . After $300~\mathbf s,$ , the position was advanced downcore by $10~\mathrm{cm}$ and counted again for $300{\mathrm{~s~}}$ . This ru n yielded a total of 16 measurements $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ apart) per $150~\mathrm{cm}$ cor e section. Total acquisition times were ${\sim}5$ min per measurement cycle, or ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{\min}$ per core section. This measurement procedur e yielded statistically significant total counts. To accommodate  a faster core flow when the terrigenous component of the sedimen t was high, the acquisition time could be reduced to $200\,{\sf s}$ .  

The NGR data were then deconvolved to calculate the concentration of potassium (K), uranium (U), and Thorium (Th) (expressed as a fraction of the total weight of the sediment) using  a Matlab script by De Vleeschouwer et al. (2017) that was updated t o the current IODP LIMS extended NGR data files. This calculatio n requires normalizing/correcting for density changes. Density-normalized NGR data help reduce biases that may reflect variability i n parameters such as sediment compaction, porosity, and missin g sediment at some depth in or throughout all of a section liner (Walczak et al., 2015). Density-normalized NGR was calculated usin g the GRA density, to which a Gaussian smoothing was applie d within a range of $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ on either side of the NGR measurement positions.  If  density-normalized  NGR  is  shown,  the  units  ar e $\mathrm{cps}/\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

As a way to validate the K $(\mathrm{wt\%})$ values, shipboard measurements of K were made via ICP-AES and XRF. However, because th e ICP-AES measurements were made on dried discrete samples, th e  

Figure F13. Shipboard station for measuring thermal conductivity on wholeround and section-half cores.  

![](images/cfab0559f3f5f6b1edb39fe6e061609dc080b1006f2fc76756604083d52843e3.jpg)  

NGR-derived K values for those discrete samples needed to be recalculated by normalizing the NGR data relative to dry densit y rather than wet density. Dry density was calculated from the GR A wet density data using a site-specific transfer function, relating dr y to wet density measurements of the MAD discrete samples. Thes e estimated dry density values were then used to normalize the NG R data, which was then deconvolved to extract $\mathrm{K}\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ data that coul d be directly compared to the ICP-AES K wt% data.  

# Thermal conductivity measurements  

Thermal conductivity is an intrinsic property of the materials ; hence, it depends on the chemical composition, porosity, density, structure, and fabric composing them (Jumikis, 1966). Thermal conductivity is the capacity of a material to transfer heat by conduction. Measurements of this parameter in sediments and rock sections combined  with in situ temperature measurements (se e Downhole measurements) are used to estimate local geothermal heat flow. This parameter is an indicator of type and age of oceani c crust, and of geodynamics and tectonic processes of oceanic an d continental lithosphere (Martos et al., 2017, 2018).  

Thermal conductivity was measured immediately after NG R analysis in the case of soft sediments (whole-round sections) an d when reliable measurements were yielded by the probe. One to tw o acquisitions per core were taken, generally in the third section, using the TK04 (Teka Bolin) system. When measuring whole-roun d sections, the needle-probe method in full space configuration wa s used (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959). The needle probe was inserted into a $2~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter hole drilled through the core line r along a split line. Measurement locations were chosen based on th e least amount of fracturing and most homogeneous portions of cor e sections. The core was placed in an enclosed box with insulatin g foam (Figure F13) to avoid interference with airflow in the laboratory and allow for stable thermal conditions during measurements. The calibrated probe heat source was turned on, and the increase i n temperature was recorded over $80\,\mathrm{s}$ for the needle probe. The heating power ranged between 0.3 and $0.7\,\mathrm{\:W/m}$ . The heat equatio n solution for a line source of heat was then fit to the temperatur e measurements to obtain the thermal conductivity. The probe is assumed to be a perfect conductor because it conducts heat more efficiently than sediment or hard rock. Following this assumption, th e linear relationship between the superconductive probe temperatur e and the natural logarithm of time after initiation of the heat is expressed as  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

# where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\left(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathbf{s}\right)$ ), $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of heat (s), and   
$C=$ an instrumental constant.  

To calculate the average thermal conductivity, three measurement cycles were performed separated by $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . A self-test, whic h included a drift study, was carried out at the beginning of each measurement cycle. The heater circuit was closed after the probe temperature stabilized, and the temperature increase in the probe wa s recorded. Thermal conductivity was estimated from the temperature increase rate while the heater current was flowing. Temperatures measured during the first 80 s of the needle probe heatin g cycle were fit to an approximate solution of a constantly heated lin e source (Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Measurement errors wer e $5\%{-}10\%$ .  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

The SHMSL employs multiple sensors to measure bulk physica l properties reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry, magnetic susceptibility, and a laser surface analyzer (Figure F14). Archive sectio n halves were covered with plastic wrap and placed on the SHMS L track, above which an electronic platform moves along a track an d records the height of the core surface. The laser sensor detects th e location of the bottom of the archive section half, and then the instrument progresses along the core making measurements of MS P and color reflectance. Color reflectance and MSP data were collected at a $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution.  

After acquisition, raw SHMSL data were processed for core edg e and void effects principally arising from sediment gaps and styrofoam inserts for interstitial water and micropaleontology samples. Reflectance and MSP measurements compromised by non-sediment material were excluded from processed data products. Additional screening for core cracks and voids was performed, an d reflectance and point magnetic susceptibility measurements compromised by cracks or voids were additionally removed from processed data products.  

# Color reflectance spectrometry  

The color reflectance spectrophotometry of the archive sectio n halves was measured using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer, with an Ocean Optics QE Pro detector integrating spher e and associated light sources, covering wavelengths from the ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Each measurement was taken in $2~\mathrm{nm}$ wide spectral bands from 390 to $732~\mathrm{nm}$ . Data are reported usin g the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{b}^{\ast}$ color space system, which expresses color as a function o f lightness $\left(\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\right)$ and color values $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ , where $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ reflects the balance between red (positive $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ ) and green (negative $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ ) and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ reflects the balance between yellow (positive $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) and blue (negativ e $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ). When $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ are 0, there is no color and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ determines grayscale. Two spectra, pure white (reference) and pure black (dark), were used to calibrate the color reflectance spectrometer. Color calibration was conducted approximately once every $^{6\mathrm{~h~}}$ (twice pe r shift). Accurate spectrophotometry using the SHMSL demands  a direct and level contact between the instrument sensors and th e split core surface. A built-in laser surface analyzer aids the recognition of irregularities in the split core surface (e.g., cracks and voids), and data from this tool were recorded to provide an independen t check on the fidelity of SHMSL measurements.

Additional details regarding measurement and interpretation o f spectral data can be found in Balsam et al. (1997), Balsam and Damuth (2000) and Giosan et al. (2002).  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

MSP was measured with a Bartington MS2 meter and an MS2 K contact probe with a flat $15~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter round sensor that has  a field of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and an operation frequency of $930\;\mathrm{Hz}$ . The instrument averages three measurements from the sensor fo r each offset with an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . The spatial resolution of th e MSP sensor is ${\sim}3.8\;\mathrm{mm}$ and reports values in instrument units (IU), which can be converted to dimensionless SI units by multiplying b y $10^{-5}$ . The instrument was calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on JOIDES Resolution and is quality checked every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ a t the same time as color reflectance sensor calibration.  

# Digital color imaging  

The Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) captures continuou s high-resolution images of the archive section half surface for analysis and description. The instrument was used shortly after cor e splitting in an effort to avoid time-dependent color changes resulting from sediment drying and oxidation. The shipboard system use s a commercial linescan camera lens (AF Micro Nikon; $60\;\mathrm{mm}$ ; 1:2. 8 D), and illumination is provided by a custom assembly of three pair s of LED strip lights that provide constant illumination over a rang e of surface elevations. Each pair of lights has a color temperature o f $6{,}500\,\mathrm{K}$ and emits 90,000 lux at 3 inches. The resolution of the linescan camera was set at 10 pixels/mm. Users set a crop rectangle fo r each image to remove extraneous information. Images were save d as high-resolution TIFF files. Available files include the original

# Section Half Measurement Gantry measurements  

$P$ -wave velocity measurements were performed on working section halves using the SHMG. Two to three measurements were typically made on one section of each core. The number of $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}^{\prime}$ -calipe r measurements was increased when the WRMSL PWL was not abl e to estimate accurate velocity measurements, for example due to internal cracks in the cores. Measurements were taken at varying section  intervals  to  accommodate  lithologic  variations,  drillin g disturbance, fractures, larger clasts, general core quality, and MA D samples.  

# P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity values on working section halves were measured with the PWC, which measures the $P$ -wave velocity vertical t o the sectional plane of the section $\scriptstyle{\left[x\right]}$ -axis) (Figure F15). The syste m uses Panametrics-NDT Microscan delay line transducers, whic h transmit at $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ . During measurement, the signal transmitte d through the core was recorded by the attached computer system, which then used an automated algorithm in the processing softwar e to choose peak $P$ -wave) arrival. In cases of poor contact or wea k signal, the instrument operator manually picked the first arrival. The distance between transducers was measured with a built-in linear voltage displacement transformer (LDVT). Calibrations wer e performed with an acrylic standard of known thickness and a published velocity of $2730\;\mathrm{m/s}$ , whereas an aluminum standard of 629 5 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ was used for compressional $P_{\|}$ -wave measurements on th e WRMSL. The system time delay determined from the calibratio n was subtracted from the chosen arrival time to calculate a $P$ -wav e traveltime through the sample. Sample thickness (calculated b y LDVT in meters) was divided by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P$ -wave velocity in $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ .

# Moisture and density measurements  

Discrete samples from working section halves were selected t o carry out MAD measurements to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, and porosity. For soft-sedimen t cores, $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were collected with a plastic syringe.  

Sediment samples were placed in numbered, preweighed ${\sim}16$ mL Wheaton glass vials to obtain wet and dry sediment mass an d dry volume measurements. Wet sample mass was first measured o n each vial before placing it in a convection oven for ${\sim}24\ \mathrm{h}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm$ $5\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to dry. Once samples were dried, they were cooled in a desiccator for at least $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$ before measuring dry mass and volume. Wet an d dry sample masses were determined to an accuracy of $0.005\:\mathrm{g}$ usin g two Mettler Toledo electronic balances, with one balance acting as  a reference and one acting as an unknown. A standard mass of simila r value to the sample mass was placed upon the reference balance t o increase the accuracy of the unknown sample measurement (Figur e F16). An averaging algorithm in the MADMax software was used t o correct for the motion of the ship. The default measurement settin g of the two balances was 300 measurements over an interval of ${\sim}1.5$ min.  

Dry sample volume was determined using a six-celled, custom-configured Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer (Figure F16). The precision of each cell is $1\%$ o f the full-scale volume. Volume measurements are preceded b y three purges of the sample chamber with helium warmed t o ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run for each sample. Calibration was done for the six chambers between sites. A set of tw o calibration spheres was placed in one of the chambers with eac h set of five samples to check for instrument drift and systematic error. When the results were not within $1\%$ , the chamber was calibrated  again  and  two  calibration  spheres  measured  afte r calibration. The volumes occupied by the numbered Wheaton vials were calculated before the expedition by multiplying th e weight of each vial against the average density of the vial glass. Th e procedures for the determination of these physical propertie s comply with the American Society for Testing and Material s (ASTM) designation 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). The relationships and assumptions for the calculations of the physica l properties parameters are discussed in detail in Blum (1997) an d summarized below. The shipboard program MADMax was use d for computing the displayed MAD properties.  

# Mass and volume calculation  

Wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ wer e measured in the laboratory as detailed in the previous section. Th e ratio of mass $\left(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ is a computational constant of 0.965 (i.e., $0.965\mathrm{~g~}$ of freshwater per $_{\mathrm{~1~g~}}$ of seawater). Salt precipitated in sedimen t pores during the drying process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ in th e sample are given by $M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[{\bf s}/(1-{\bf s})],$ , respectively, where s is the assumed saltwater salinity $(0.035\%)$ corresponding to a pore water density $(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ of $1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (from experimental and empirical relations between salinity and density a t laboratory conditions; Blum, 1997) and a salt density $(\boldsymbol{\rho}_{\mathrm{salt}})$ of 2.2 2 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of pore water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of salt $\left(V_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\left(V_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , and wet volume $\mathrm{~\,~\,~}V_{\mathrm{wet}})$ are defined as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{pe}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dr}})/r_{\mathrm{m}},}\\ &{\quad\quad\quad V_{\mathrm{pe}}=M_{\mathrm{pe}}/p_{\mathrm{pe}},}\\ &{\quad\quad\quad M_{\mathrm{seld}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pe}},}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{seld}}=M_{\mathrm{pe}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dr}}),}\\ &{\quad\quad\quad V_{\mathrm{seld}}=M_{\mathrm{seld}}/p_{\mathrm{sib}},}\\ &{V_{\mathrm{vet}}=V_{\mathrm{dr}}-V_{\mathrm{sh}}+V_{\mathrm{pe}},\,\mathrm{and}}\\ &{\quad\quad\quad V_{\mathrm{seld}}=V_{\mathrm{pe}},}\end{array}
$$  

Wet (or total) volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{t}}\right)$ , dry mass $\mathbf{\Gamma}(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volum e $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ were measured in the laboratory. Total mass, including th e freshwater of the pore water, is calculated using a water density of  1 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ :  

$$
M_{\mathrm{t}}=M_{\mathrm{dry}}+\left(V_{\mathrm{t}}-V_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)\times\uprho_{\mathrm{w}}.
$$  

Assuming a pore water density of $1.024\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , the volume of th e pore water is calculated as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=\left(V_{\mathrm{t}}-V_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)\,\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Finally, the mass of the pore water is estimated as  

$$
M_{\mathrm{pw}}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}\times\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

# Calculation of bulk properties  

Water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as the ratio of the mass of por e water to wet sediment (total) mass,  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grai n density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio $(V R)$ are calculated usin g the following expressions:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{pdry}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{solid}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\end{array}
$$  

$\Phi=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},$  

$$
V\!R=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.
$$  

# Downhole measurements  

# Advanced piston corer temperature tool  

During APC coring operations and generally above $200\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF), the formation temperature wa s measured with an APCT-3 tool that is housed in a specially designed coring shoe that replaces the standard cutting shoe (Heesemann et al., 2006). Normally, these measurements were made whil e coring Hole A at a site; however, if obtained temperature measurements were considered to be unreliable, additional APCT-3 measurements were made in one or more subsequent holes.  

The APCT-3 tool comprises a battery pack, a data logger unit , and a platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over  a temperature range of $0^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This instrument is fitted to be use d in an APC coring shoe (Figures F17, F18). Upon deployment, th e APCT-3 tool first stops at the mudline for $5{-}10\ \mathrm{min}$ to thermall y equilibrate with bottom water before entering the borehole. Frictional heating occurs as the APCT-3 tool moves into the formation. This heat gradually dissipates into the surrounding sediment as th e APCT-3 tool equilibrates to formation temperature while bein g held in place for $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$ , acquiring data every second.  

After retrieval and readout of the data, the equilibrium temperature of the sediment is estimated by applying a mathematical heatconduction model to the temperature decay record (Horai and Vo n Herzen, 1985). The synthetic thermal decay curve for the APCT- 3 tool is a function of the geometry and thermal properties of th e probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). Equilibrium temperature was estimated by applying a fittin g procedure (Pribnow et al., 2000). The nominal accuracy of th e APCT-3 temperature measurements is $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

# Wireline logging  

Wireline logging was planned for Chilean margin Sites U1542– U1544, but downhole measurements were canceled because o f rough weather, high seas, and the resulting lack of sufficient time t o conduct these operations.  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Continuous sedimentary sections cannot be collected from  a single borehole because core recovery gaps occur between successive APC and XCB cores despite $100\%$ (or greater) nominal recover y (Ruddiman et al., 1987; Hagelberg et al., 1995). Consequently, t o meet the scientific objectives of Expedition 383 it was necessary t o drill more than one hole at each site. The construction of a continuous sedimentary section, referred to as a splice, requires the combination of stratigraphic intervals from two or more holes cored at th e same site. To maximize the probability of bridging gaps betwee n successive cores in individual holes, the starting depths below seafloor from which cores are recovered are offset between holes. Thi s practice ensures that most missing sedimentary sections from intercore gaps within a given hole are recovered in one or more adjacen t holes. Usually at least two complete holes and a third partial hol e must be cored to recover a complete section in the interval core d with the APC system at a site. Additional complete holes are core d to allow construction of alternate and secondary splices where possible. During Expedition 383, inclement weather conditions ofte n limited the number of overlapping intervals drilled in multiple hole s at each site. As a result, each splice contains at least one short gap. Only a single hole could be drilled at Site U1544, so no splice i s available for this site.  

The composite section and splice construction methodolog y employed during Expedition 383 follows the basic strategy originally developed during ODP Leg 138 (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995 ) and refined during subsequent legs. This strategy is now commo n practice for all high-resolution paleoceanographic expeditions. Ou r approach used initial MS and GRA bulk density data from th e STMSL as soon as possible after core retrieval to construct initial composites to inform drilling decisions; subsequently a more refined composite scale and splice was developed as more detailed information became available from the WRMSL and NGRL, th e digitized RGB color data from core images acquired with the SHIL, and color reflectance and MSP data from the SHMSL.  

The goals for stratigraphic correlation, in order of priority, wer e to  

1. Guide drilling to ensure recovery of a complete stratigraphic section;   
2. Establish a composite depth scale;   
3. Define a stratigraphically complete and representative sampling splice; and   
4. Evaluate and, if possible, refine shipboard stratigraphic age models by synthesizing all available age information, including the potential for tuning lithologic variations to reference records.  

The procedure for these activities involved consideration o f several different depth scales (Figure F17). The depth scale s used  during  Expedition  383  followed  IODP  conventio n (http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines) and are described in methodological order (Figure F19).  

# Core depth below seafloor (CSF-A) scale  

We began the process of building a composite section by assigning a depth to the top of each core, based initially on the drillin g depth below seafloor (DSF). DSF is a drill string measurement determined as the difference between the length of the drill string belo w the rig floor to the top of the cored interval and the length of the dril l string from the rig floor to the mudline (assumed to be the seafloor). DSF error includes phenomena such as pipe and BHA stretch an d compression, tides, and uncompensated heave. Tidal influence o n this depth measurement might be significant (Hagelberg et al., 1995), and the prediction of tides is generally useful for guiding drilling t o avoid gap alignment (Mix, Tiedemann, Blum, et al., 2003).  

During Expedition 383, ship heave (typically $1{-}4\,\mathrm{m},$ ) contribute d a significant source of error to bit position on the DSF scale. Thi s effect appeared to impact the relative depths of obvious stratigraphic markers between multiple adjacent holes. Significant shi p heave also appears to have increased the occurrence of misfire d cores, which often resulted in short, disturbed, or poorly aligne d sediment recovery that complicated splice construction. Becaus e heave magnitude and direction is unpredictable for the moment  a core is fired, we did not explicitly adjust drilling targets to compensate for heave conditions.  

Figure F19. Interrelationships between cored material and the depth scale s used for Expedition 383. Brown and purple intervals represent recovere d core. Dashed and dotted lines represent equivalent horizons. Red dashe d lines represent tie points aligning specific, easily recognized features. Th e core depth below seafloor, Method A (CSF-A), scale is established by addin g the curated core length to the core top drilling depth below seafloor (DSF ) depth. Core expansion creates apparent overlaps and stratigraphic reversal s when data are plotted on the CSF-A scale. The core composite depth belo w seafloor (CCSF) scale is constructed based on sequential identification of distinct horizons identified in multiple holes at a given site, working from th e top of the section downward (red dashed lines). The primary splice (CCSF) i s constructed by combining selected intervals between tie points (red) so tha t coring gaps and disturbed section are excluded, resulting in a complet e stratigraphic sequence. CCSF depth designations are not necessarily equivalent to CCSF for intervals not included in the splice, which is illustrated b y green dashed lines that symbolize the connection between the same sedimentary unit in all three holes.  

![](images/407019afadcb6b99d4ea095f2b009eb9ff13ea19fb3e02b529ec0b948bb1e5d2.jpg)  

Tidal influence was minimal during Expedition 383, with the exception of Site U1542 and, presumably, Site U1544. At these sites, the tidal range was at times as high as $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ , and this appeared t o impact the size of the core gaps. We did not adjust drilling explicitl y to compensate for changing tide height; instead, we used it to hel p us anticipate whether core gaps would migrate relative to othe r holes that were drilled during a different phase of the tide and adjusted with drill-ahead intervals or short cores (cores fired abov e the bit/sediment interface) when needed.  

The depth to a given position within any core was then determined relative to the DSF core top depth. The CSF-A depth, therefore, combined the DSF core-top depth with the curated length o f the core after retrieval. The CSF-A depth scale is equivalent to th e historical DSDP, ODP, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program meters below seafloor (mbsf) scale and is specific to each hole. It is important to note that the “within-core” position, on the CSF-A dept h scale, of any given sedimentary feature may change after recover y due to various influences such overburden relief, gas-induced expansion, and water loss. Therefore, hole-to-hole differences in th e position of a stratigraphic feature on the CSF-A scale includes bot h drilling effects and core expansion effects. For example, the CSF- A scale permits stratigraphically impossible overlaps between successive cores caused by gas-induced expansion. In principle, the composite depth scale, described below, should rectify such artifacts.  

# Core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF-A) scale  

The construction of a common, composite depth scale for  a given site involves identification of coeval, laterally continuous features in all drilled holes (which will generally occur at differen t depths on the CSF-A depth scale for each hole). Once correlativ e features were identified during Expedition 383, the depth of individual cores was offset relative to the CSF-A depth scale in that hole s o that the features aligned on a common depth scale, which is the cor e composite depth below seafloor, Method A (CCSF-A), scale. Th e CCSF-A scale is equivalent to the historical ODP and Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program meters composite depth (mcd) scale. I n constructing the CCSF-A scale, the depths of individual cores wer e offset by a constant amount (without stretching or squeezing in individual cores). This composite depth scale provided good estimates of the length of coring gaps and formed the basis fo r developing the spliced record (on the CCSF-A scale). The vertical depth offset of every core in every hole was tabulated in an affin e table, one of the principal deliverables of the stratigraphic correlator.  

The CCSF-A scale was built by correlating features downhol e from the mudline. The mudline at one hole was established as th e top of the stratigraphic section, anchoring the entire composit e depth scale for all cores from all holes at a single site. Compositin g proceeded sequentially by establishing specific tie points betwee n the various holes, working from the mudline (anchor) core to th e bottom of the drilled section. The CCSF-A scale very rarely (if ever ) resulted in alignment of all coeval features because of the contrasting effects of coring-induced stretching and squeezing among cores, as well as stratigraphic differences between holes.  

In principle, if core gaps never come into alignment between al l holes at a site and if recovery is sufficiently high, then it should b e possible to correlate each successive core in one hole to a core fro m an adjacent hole all the way to the bottom of a drilled section. However, aligned coring gaps across all holes at a site are often difficul t to avoid. In the case of aligned core gaps, cores below the gap are n o longer tied to the anchor core. They can, however, still be tied t o one another to produce correlated sections that are “floating” on th e CCSF-A scale. Such floating ties were denoted in the affine table a s “APPENDED” or “SET” depending on whether the offset to the to p of that section was estimated by inheriting the absolute offset of th e core above (APPEND) or by assuming a constant growth rate (SET). The second method (SET) is preferable because it produces a mor e realistic estimate of the core gap based on estimates of the expansion of overlying cores from the same hole.  

During the process of constructing the composite section, th e CCSF-A depth becomes systematically larger than the CSF-A dept h for equivalent horizons. This expansion, which typically average d $7\%{-}10\%$ during Expedition 383, has four main causes: (1) decompression of the sediment as it is brought to atmospheric pressure; (2) pore-space gases coming out of solution, warming, and expanding; (3) stretching that occurs as part of the coring process; an d (4) curation of borehole wall sediment that fell downhole and wa s re-cored (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995; Acton et al., 2001).  

# The splice  

Once the CCSF-A scale was developed and the between-cor e gaps were identified, a complete stratigraphic section (splice) wa s constructed by combining selected intervals between the previousl y established tie points. In the case of aligned core gaps across al l holes, any spliced sections below the gap were appended to thos e above and designated as floating splice sections, with the length o f the missing sections in the splice gap estimated based on the percent expansion observed where we had a continuous splice.  

# Intervals outside of splice  

Once the splice was constructed, we mapped into the splic e those intervals not included in the splice itself by treating the splic e as a downhole log. The methodology is based on identifying correlative tie points and using these tie points to make linear adjustments of these cores not used in the splice. This was used to pu t cores not used in the splice on the CCSF-A depth scale. In reality, the CCSF-A depth scale at adjacent holes are equivalent only to th e extent that the correlations are accurate. At core boundaries, wher e evidence of stretching and compression was most prevalent, the detailed depth maps are considered less accurate. Thus, the CCSF- A scale is not precisely the same at all holes at a site except exactl y where the splice tie points were made. See the individual site chapters for additional details and guidance.  

# Measurements and methods for correlation  

For the majority of sites, initial development of composite sections (CCSF-A scale) was based on the stratigraphic correlation o f GRA density or magnetic susceptibility data sets acquired from th e WRMSL and the STMSL as soon as possible after core retrieval. I n many cases, this allowed stratigraphic correlation to take place i n near real time so that bit depth could be adjusted as necessary t o avoid alignment of core gaps between holes. More details about th e effectiveness of real-time stratigraphic correlation are provided i n the site chapters. At all sites, no single variable proved to be universally powerful for stratigraphic correlation or splice construction; thus, correlation proceeded through a combination of WRMSL, STMSL, and NGR data as well as section-half digitized color reflectance (RGB and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast},$ ) and MSP data. Color reflectance data wer e extracted from core images acquired from the SHIL (RGB) and th e SHMSL $\left(\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}\right)$ . Magnetic susceptibility, GRA, and $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ (or $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ an d $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) were measured at 2 or $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals, and RGB values were calculated at $1\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals in the form of $0.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ averages measure d continuously along a $1.5~\,\mathrm{cm}$ wide strip centered on digital colo r SHIL images. Details on instrument calibrations, settings, and measurement intervals are given in Physical properties.  

Compositing and splicing were accomplished using Correlato r software (version 3.0), from which standard affine tables (listings o f the vertical offset $[\mathfrak{m}]$ added to each core to generate the CCSF- A scale) and splice interval tables (listings of the specific core interval s used to construct the splice) were generated. These tables were uploaded into the LIMS database, which then linked the appropriat e depth scale to any associated data set.
