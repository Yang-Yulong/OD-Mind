# Introduction  

This chapter documents the procedures and methods employe d in the various shipboard laboratories on the research vessel (R/V ) JOIDES Resolution during International Ocean Discovery Progra m (IODP) Expedition 366. This information applies only to shipboar d work described in the Expedition Reports section of the Expeditio n 366 Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of Expedition 366 data will be described in separate publications. Thi s introductory section provides an overview of operations, curatoria l conventions, depth scale terminology, and general core handlin g and analyses.  

# Site locations  

The ship’s GPS system was used to position the vessel at site locations determined from pre-expedition site surveys, submersibl e dives, and short core locations. A SyQuest Bathy 2010 compresse d high-intensity radar pulse (CHIRP) subbottom profiler was used t o monitor seafloor depth on the approach to each site to confirm th e depth profiles from pre-expedition surveys. In areas of steep seafloor slopes, this depth is often shallower than the actual depth a t the site because the radar pulse widens with depth and can reflec t from shallower parts of the seafloor not directly underneath th e ship. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters wer e lowered and a positioning beacon was dropped to the seafloor (Figure F1). Dynamic positioning control of the vessel used navigationa l input from the GPS system and triangulation to the seafloor beacon,

weighted by the estimated positional accuracy. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collecte d over a significant time interval.  

# Coring and drilling operations  

All four standard coring systems, the advanced piston core r (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), extended core barrel (XCB), an d rotary core barrel (RCB) systems, were used during Expedition 366. The APC system was used in the upper portion of each hole to obtain high-quality core. The APC system cuts soft-sediment core s with minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems (Figure F2). After the APC core barrel is lowered through th e drill pipe and lands near the bit, the drill pipe is pressured up unti l the two shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the oute r barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation an d cuts the core. The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke, ” from the pressure gauge on the rig floor.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in two ways: (1) the pisto n fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from the pum p pressure reading) because the formation is too hard, or (2) excessiv e force $^{\leftmoon}_{\rightmoon}{}60{,}000$ lb; ${\sim}267\,\mathrm{kN})$ ) is required to pull the core barrel out o f the formation. When a full stroke cannot be achieved, additional attempts are typically made, and after each attempt, the bit is advanced by the length of core recovered. Note that this results in  a nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ based on the assumption that the barre l penetrates the formation by the equivalent of the length of core recovered. Many of the Expedition 366 APC and HLAPC cores di d not achieve full stroke, especially in the unconsolidated but low-porosity serpentinite muds. In some cases, we proceeded using “advance-by-recovery,” starting the next core assuming the recovere d length was a good measure of penetration. More often, we drille d down to the base of what would have been a full HLAPC stroke using an XCB core barrel; cores collected in this way were labeled a s ghost cores, and their depth was assigned to be within the botto m part of the drilled interval. The number of additional attempts a t coring without full stroke was generally dictated by the length of recovery of the partial stroke core and the time available to advanc e the hole by piston coring.  

The APC system contains a $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. The recentl y engineered HLAPC coring system uses a $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. I n most instances, the HLAPC system is deployed after the AP C reaches refusal. During Expedition 366, the HLAPC system wa s used in preference to the APC system because of the greater risk o f bending the APC core barrel, as happened with the first Hol e U1493A core. When using the HLAPC system, the same criteri a were applied in terms of refusal as for the APC system. Use of thi s new technology allowed for significantly greater continuous AP C sampling depths to be attained than would have otherwise bee n possible. Often during Expedition 366, the APC system could no t adequately penetrate the serpentinite mud formations, resulting i n poor recovery and ruptured core liners that severely damaged th e core that was recovered. As a result, we mostly used the HLAP C system.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were initially used during conventional APC and HLAPC coring, up to a pull force of ${\sim}40{,}000$ l b (note that nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all coring system s except where noted). After the first site (U1491) and the loss of th e bottom-hole assembly (BHA), APC cores were not oriented becaus e of risk of damage to the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool and th e need to preserve the available BHA for the next IODP expedition, which required paleomagnetic data. Formation temperature measurements were made with the advanced piston corer temperatur e tool (APCT-3) to obtain temperature measurements from whic h gradients and heat flow were calculated (see Downhole measurements).  

The XCB system is used to advance the hole when APC refusa l occurs before the target depth is reached or when the formation becomes either too stiff for APC coring or hard substrate is encountered. The XCB system is a rotary system with a small cutting sho e (bit) that extends below the large APC/XCB bit. The smaller bit ca n cut a semi-indurated core with less torque and fluid circulation tha n the main bit and thus optimizes recovery. The XCB cutting shoe extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediment but retract s into the main bit when hard formations are encountered. The XC B system was used with moderate success, although HLAPC corin g was preferred.  

The BHA is the lowermost part of the drill string. A typica l APC/XCB BHA consists of a drill bit (outer diameter $=~11\%$ inches), a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, a nonmagnetic drill collar (fo r APC/XCB coring), a number of $8\%$ inch drill collars, a tapered drill collar, six joints (two stands) of $5\%$ inch $({\sim}13.97~\mathrm{cm})$ drill pipe, an d one crossover sub. The nonmagnetic drill collar was replaced with  a regular (magnetic) drill collar after breaking off the lower part of th e BHA in Hole U1491C.

The RCB system is deployed when deeper penetration in consolidated rocks is expected. During Expedition 366, the RCB syste m was only employed at the last site (U1498). The RCB system requires a dedicated RCB BHA and bit. The BHA used for RCB corin g included a $9\%$ inch RCB drill bit, a mechanical bit release (use d when wireline logging is planned), a modified head sub, an oute r core barrel, a modified top sub, and 7–10 control-length drill collar s followed by a tapered drill collar to the two stands of $5\%$ inch dril l pipe. Most cored intervals are ${\sim}9.7\mathrm{~m~}$ long, which is the length of  a standard rotary core and approximately the length of a joint of dril l pipe. In some cases, the drill string is drilled or “washed” ahea d without recovering sediment to advance the drill bit to a targe t depth to resume core recovery. Such intervals are typically drille d using a center bit installed within the RCB bit.  

# Core handling and analysis  

Recovered cores were extracted from the core barrel in plasti c liners ( $62\;\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter; $67~\mathrm{mm}$ outer diameter. These liner s were carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on th e catwalk outside the core laboratory, where they were split into ${\sim}1.5$ m long sections (Figures F1, F3). Liner caps (blue $=$ top, colorless $=$ bottom, and yellow $=$ whole-round sample taken) were glued wit h acetone onto liner sections on the catwalk by the IODP Core Technicians. The length of each section was entered into the database a s “created length” using the Sample Master application. This lengt h measurement was used to calculate core recovery.  

As soon as cores arrived on deck, “headspace” samples wer e taken either by using a syringe in soft formations or taking chips o f harder material for immediate hydrocarbon analysis as part of th e shipboard safety and pollution prevention program. Further syring e samples were immediately taken from the ends of some cut section s for analysis of dissolved gases such as $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ , ${\mathrm{CH}}_{4},$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ . In core s where gas was already coming out of solution, holes were drilled i n the liner and gases were sampled directly. Whole-round sample s were taken from core sections for shipboard and postexpedition interstitial water and microbiological analyses (see Fluid geochemistry and Microbiology) (Figure F3). No core catcher samples wer e taken for biostratigraphic analysis because microfossils are no t found in erupted serpentinite muds.  

Core sections were then placed in core racks in the laboratory . When the cores reached equilibrium with laboratory temperatur e (typically after ${\sim}4~\mathrm{h}$ ), whole-round core sections were run throug h the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL; measuring $P$ - wave velocity, density, and magnetic susceptibility) and the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL). Thermal conductivity measurements were typically taken at a rate of approximately one per cor e (see Physical properties). The core sections were then split lengthwise from bottom to top into working and archive halves. After initial experimentation with the wire cutter used for typical sof t sediments and spatulas used for stiff sediments, the clast-bearin g serpentinite muds proved to be better suited to be split with the diamond-impregnated saw.  

The working half of each sedimentary core was sampled fo r shipboard physical property, paleomagnetic, and geochemical analyses. Personal sampling of soft matrix muds for postexpeditio n analyses then took place at the sample table. Personal sampling o f hard rock clasts took place daily after the midday crossover meetin g after all of the scientists had a chance to view the cores. The archiv e half of all cores was scanned on the Section Half Imaging Logge r (SHIL) and measured for color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). At the sam e time, the archive halves were described visually and by means o f smear slides and thin sections. All observations were recorded i n the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) databas e using DESClogik, a descriptive data capture application. After visual description, the archive halves were run through the cryogeni c magnetometer.  

Both halves of the core were put into labeled plastic tubes tha t were sealed and transferred to cold storage aboard ship. At the en d of the expedition, the cores remained on board for the next 2 mont h expedition before being transported to permanent cold storage a t the Kochi Core Center (KCC) at Kochi University (Japan). The dela y was due to construction work at KCC.

# Drilling disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed as a result of the drillin g process and may contain extraneous material as a result of the coring and core handling processes. Several types of disturbance wer e encountered during the expedition. Material from intervals highe r in the hole may be washed down by drilling circulation, accumulat e at the bottom of the hole, and be sampled with the next core (Figur e F2). The uppermost $10{-}50\;\mathrm{cm}$ of each core was examined criticall y during description for potential “fall-in” or other coring deformation. Common coring-induced deformation includes the concavedownward appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Piston action may result in fluidization (“flow-in” or “suck-in”) of unlithifie d sediment, apparent as tube-parallel banding or concave-downwar d bending. This most often occurs at the bottom of APC cores but ca n occur anywhere in a core. Some Expedition 366 cores contain fining-upward sequences of coarse to fine gravel without matrix. These sequences were probably caused by rock pieces ground up b y the drilling process that were incompletely flushed up out of th e hole before falling to the base of the hole, with the larger pieces settling first, resulting in an apparent graded bed. Multiple sequence s of such grading can form when sea state is especially high becaus e the drill string rises and lowers in the hole.  

Retrieval from depth to the surface may result in elastic rebound. Gas that is in solution at depth may become free and driv e apart intervals of recovered material within the liner. Both elasti c rebound and gas pressure can result in a total length for each cor e that is longer than the interval cored, resulting in a calculated recovery of ${>}100\%$ . If gas expansion or other coring disturbance results i n a void in any particular core section, the void was closed by movin g material. If material could not be moved, then the void was identified by a foam insert. When gas content is high, pressure must b e relieved by drilling holes into the liner for safety reasons before th e cores are cut into segments. These disturbances are described in th e Lithostratigraphy section in each site chapter and are graphically indicated on the core summary graphic reports (visual core descriptions [VCDs]).  

# Curatorial procedures  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples follows standar d IODP procedure. Drilling sites are numbered consecutively fro m the first site drilled by the drilling vessel (D/V) Glomar Challenger in 1968. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Expedition 30 1 began using the prefix $^{\ast}\mathrm{U}^{\prime\prime}$ to designate sites occupied by the JOIDES Resolution. For all IODP drill sites, a letter suffix distinguishe s each hole drilled at the same site. The first hole drilled is assigne d the site number modified by the suffix “A,” the second hole the sit e number and the suffix ${}^{\iota}\mathrm{B},{}^{\prime\prime}$ and so on.  

Cores taken from a hole are numbered sequentially from the to p of the hole downward (Figure F1). Cores taken with the APC syste m are designated with $^{a}\mathrm{H}^{m}$ (APC) or “F” (HLAPC), “X” designates XC B cores, and “R” designates RCB cores. “G” designates ghost cores tha t are collected while washing down through a previously drilled portion of a hole with a core barrel in place or in a cased borehol e where material ascends the base of the casing string. The core barre l is then retrieved prior to coring the next interval. Core numbers an d their associated cored intervals are unique in a given hole.  

Generally, maximum recovery for a single core is $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment (APC; $4.7\,\textrm{m}$ for HLAPC) or $9.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of rock or sedimen t (XCB/RCB) contained in a plastic liner ( $6.6~\mathrm{cm}$ internal diameter ) plus an additional ${\sim}0.2\,\mathrm{m}$ in the core catcher, which is a device at th e bottom of the core barrel that prevents the core from sliding ou t when the barrel is retrieved from the hole. In certain situations, recovery may exceed the 9.5 or $9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ maximum. In soft material, thi s is normally caused by core expansion resulting from depressurization or gas-induced expansion. High heave, tidal changes, and overdrilling can also result in an advance that differs from the planne d $9.5/9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Recovered cores are divided into $1.5\textrm{m}$ sections that are numbered serially from the top downcore. When full recovery is obtained, the sections are numbered 1–7 (or 1–3 for HLAPC) with th e last section usually being $_{<1.5\;\mathrm{m}}$ . Rarely, an unusually long core ma y require more than seven sections. When the recovered core i s shorter than the cored interval, by convention the top of the core i s deemed to be located at the top of the cored interval for the purpos e of calculating (consistent) depths. Samples and descriptions of core s are designated by distance measured in centimeters from the top o f the section to the top and bottom of each sample or interval. In unconsolidated cores, the core catcher section is treated as a separat e section (CC). When the only recovered material is in the cor e catcher, it is placed at the top of the cored interval.  

A full curatorial sample identifier consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, and interval in centimeters measured from the top of the cor e section. For example, a sample identification of $^{\prime}366$ -U1492A-2H-5, $80{-}85~\mathrm{cm},^{\prime\prime}$ represents a sample taken from the interval between 8 0 and $85\;\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 5 of Core 2 (collected using th e APC system) of the first hole (Hole A) of Site U1492 during Expedition 366 (Figure F1).  

# Sample depth calculations  

For a complete description of depths, see IODP Depth Scale s Terminology, v.2 (http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines) . The primary depth scale types are based on the measurement of th e drill string length deployed beneath the rig floor (drilling depth below rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]), th e length of each core recovered (core depth below seafloor [CSF] an d core composite depth below seafloor [CCSF]), and the length of th e logging wireline deployed (wireline log depth below rig floo r [WRF], wireline log depth below seafloor [WSF], and wireline lo g matched depth below seafloor [WMSF]). All units are in meters. Depths of samples and measurements are calculated at the applicable depth scale either by fixed protocol (e.g., CSF) or by combinations of protocols with user-defined correlations (e.g., CCSF). Th e definition of these depth scale types and the distinction in nomenclature should keep the user aware that a nominal depth value a t two different depth scale types might not refer to exactly the sam e stratigraphic interval in a hole.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF scale). The depth of the cored interval is referenced to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth at the time of th e first hole from the DRF depth of the interval. In most cases, the seafloor depth is the length of pipe deployed minus the length of th e mudline core recovered. However, some seafloor depths can be determined in another manner (e.g., by offset from a previous know n measurement of depth or by observing the bit tag the seafloor wit h the camera system).  

Standard depths of cores in meters below the seafloor (CSF- A scale) are determined based on the assumption that (1) the to p depth of a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of its core d interval (DSF scale) and (2) the recovered material is a contiguou s section even if core segments are separated by voids when recovered. When possible, voids in the core are closed by pushing cor e segments together on the catwalk during core handling. This convention is also applied if a core has incomplete recovery, in whic h case the true position of the core within the cored interval is unknown and should be considered a sample depth uncertainty, up t o the length of the core barrel used, when analyzing data associate d with the core material. Standard depths of samples and associate d measurements (CSF-A scale) are calculated by adding the offset o f the sample or measurement from the top of its section and th e lengths of all higher sections in the core to the top depth of th e cored interval.  

A soft to semisoft sediment core from less than a few hundre d meters below seafloor expands upon recovery (typically a few percent to as much as $15\%$ ), so the length of the recovered core ofte n exceeds that of the cored interval. Therefore, a stratigraphic interva l may not have the same nominal depth at the DSF and CSF scales i n the same hole. When core recovery (the ratio of recovered core t o cored interval times $100\%$ ) is ${>}100\%$ , the CSF depth of a sampl e taken from the bottom of a core will be deeper than that of a sampl e from the top of the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated wit h the two core intervals overlap at the CSF-A scale).  

Cored intervals are defined by the core top depth in DSF and th e distance the driller advanced the bit and/or core barrel in meters. The length of the core is defined by the sum of lengths of the cor e sections. The CSF depth of a sample is calculated by adding the offset of the sample below the section top and the lengths of all highe r sections in the core to the core top depth measured with the dril l string (DSF). During Expedition 366, all core depths below seafloo r were calculated according to the core depth below seafloor Metho d A (CSF-A) depth scale. This calculated depth has units of meter s below seafloor (mbsf).  

# Screened casing deployments  

Deployment of 10.75 inch diameter screened casing at thre e sites during the expedition was accomplished using the drill-i n method to target depths between 110 and 220 mbsf. The casing infrastructure included a reentry cone and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) landing platform, with the objective that these holes ca n be revisited by future (non-IODP) research expeditions for deployment of borehole fluid samplers, instruments to monitor tempora l changes in serpentinite mud volcanism, and manipulative experiments. Details of the casing strings and casing operations are give n in the Operations sections of the Site U1492 chapter, the Sit e U1496 chapter, and the Site U1497 chapter (Fryer et al., 2018a, 2018b, 2018c).  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithology of sediment recovered during Expedition 366 wa s primarily determined using observations based on visual (macroscopic) core descriptions, smear slides, thin sections, and occasional use of the scanning electron microscope. In some cases, digital core imaging, color reflectance spectrophotometry, an d magnetic susceptibility analysis provided complementary discriminative information. The methods employed during this expeditio n were similar to those used during IODP Expedition 352 (Reagan e t al., 2015b) and supplemented by methods used during ODP Leg s 125 and 195 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1990, 2002b).  

We used the DESClogik application to record and upload descriptive data into the LIMS database (see the DESClogik user guid e at https://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation). Spreadsheet templates were set up in DESClogik and customized for Expedition 36 6 before the first core arrived on deck. The templates were used t o record visual core descriptions and microscopic data from smea r slides and thin sections, which in turn helped to quantify the textur e and relative abundance of biogenic and nonbiogenic components.  

Because of the unusual nature of serpentinite mud volcano deposits, which are sequential mudflow deposits that incorporat e clasts of mantle peridotites, metavolcanic rocks, volcanic rocks, various types of limestone, chert, and fault rocks, we adopted a hybrid approach to core description. Our approach was to log all materials in the DESClogik Sediment tab (the software does not have  a category for mudflow), including igneous and metamorphic clasts, to produce a continuous log of all recovered core. In addition, clast s of igneous or metamorphic material selected as shipboard sample s for whole-rock analysis and/or thin section preparation were described under the appropriate tab for that material in DESClogi k (Intrusive_mantle, Volcanic_hypabyssal, or Metamorphic). Likewise, drilling disturbances and structures were logged in the appropriate tabs within DESClogik.  

The locations of all smear slide and thin section samples take n from each core were recorded in the Sample Master application. Descriptive data uploaded to the LIMS database were also used t o produce visual core description standard graphic reports (VCDs).  

The standard method of splitting cores into working and archiv e halves (using a spatula, piano wire, or a saw) can affect the appearance of the split core surface and obscure fine details of litholog y and sedimentary structure. When necessary, the archive halves o f cores were gently scraped across, rather than along, the core sectio n using a stainless steel or glass scraper to prepare the surface for unobscured sedimentologic examination and digital imaging. Scrapin g parallel to bedding with a freshly cleaned tool prevented crossstratigraphic contamination. Cleaned sections were then describe d in conjunction with measurements using the SHIL and SHMSL.  

# Visual core descriptions  

After descriptions of the cores were uploaded into the LIMS database, the data were used to produce VCDs, which include a simplified graphic representation of the core on a section-by-sectio n basis with accompanying descriptions of the features observed. A n example VCD is shown in Figure F4. Site, hole, and depth in meter s below seafloor, calculated according to the CSF-A depth scale, ar e given at the top of each VCD, with depths of core sections indicate d along the left margin. Observations of the physical characteristics o f the core correspond to entries in DESClogik, including sedimen t color determined qualitatively using Munsell soil color chart s (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 1994). Because sediment color ma y evolve during drying and subsequent oxidization, color was described shortly after the cores were split and imaged or measured b y the SHIL and SHMSL. Sediment color was especially useful for distinguishing pelagic muds from serpentinite muds and for distinguishing among various types of serpentinite mud. Symbols used i n the VCDs are given in Figure F5. Additionally, the VCDs display th e locations of samples taken for shipboard measurements, color reflectance, natural gamma radiation (NGR), and magnetic susceptibility. Section summary text provides a generalized overview of th e core section’s lithology and features.

# Section summary  

An overview of major and minor lithologies present in the section, as well as notable features (e.g., sedimentary structures), is presented in the section summary text field at the top of the VCD.  

# Section-half imaging  

The flat faces of the archive halves were scanned with the SHI L as soon as possible after splitting and scraping to avoid colo r changes caused by sediment oxidation and/or drying. The SHI L uses three pairs of advanced illumination high-current-focuse d LED line lights to illuminate large cracks and blocks in the core surface and sidewalls. Each LED pair has a color temperature of 6,50 0 K and emits $90,000~\mathrm{lx}$ at 3 inches. A line-scan camera imaged 1 0 lines per millimeter to create high-resolution TIFF files. The camera height was adjusted so that each pixel imaged a $0.1\;\mathrm{mm^{2}}$ sectio n of the core. However, actual core width per pixel varied because o f differences in section-half surface height. High- and low-resolutio n JPEG files were subsequently created from the high-resolution TIF F file. All image files include a grayscale and ruler. Section-half depth s were recorded so that these images could be used for core description and analysis.  

# Graphic lithology  

The primary lithologies in the core intervals recovered are represented on the VCDs by graphic patterns in the Graphic litholog y column using the symbols in Figure F5. The Graphic lithology column plots to scale all beds that are at least $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick. A maximu m of two different lithologies (for interbedded sediments) are show n within the same core interval for interlayers $<\!2\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick. Colors ar e assigned to the graphic lithology pattern as an underlay based o n the Munsell soil color assigned to that core interval. Each color i n the underlay represents a group of similar Munsell colors: redbrown, pale green, pale blue-gray, dark blue-gray, blue-black (all serpentinite variations), and off-white (typically mixed black an d white clasts). The assignment of Munsell colors to these six group s is detailed in Figure F6.  

# Sedimentary structures  

The locations and types of stratification and sedimentary o r mudflow structures visible on the prepared surfaces of the spli t cores are recorded in DESClogik but are not shown on the VCDs. For Expedition 366, the following terminology (based on Stow, 2005) was used to describe the scale of stratification:  

Thin lamination $=<\!3\;\mathrm{mm}$ thick.   
Medium lamination $=0.3–0.6\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thick lamination $=>\!0.6–1\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Very thin bed $={<}1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thin bed $=>\!3\!-\!10\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Medium bed $=>\!10\!-\!30\,\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thick bed $=>\!30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Massive $=>\!100\,\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick or no apparent bedding.  

Descriptive terms for bed boundaries, such as sharp, erosive , gradual, irregular, and bioturbated, are noted in DESClogik.

# Lithologic accessories  

Lithologic, diagenetic, and paleontologic accessories are identified in smear slides and recorded in the DESClogik Microscop y template but are not indicated on the VCDs. The following terminology was used to describe the abundance of lithologic accessorie s in DESClogik and written core descriptions:  

Trace $=1$ observed per section of core.   
Rare $=2{-}10$ observed per section of core.   
Common $=>\!10\!-\!20$ observed per section of core.   
Abundant $=>\!20{-}50$ observed per section of core.   
Dominant $=>\!50$ observed per section of core.  

# Clasts  

When clasts $>\!2\ \mathrm{mm}$ are present, this was noted in the VCD s with the clast lithology, estimated percent abundance, average size, maximum size, and roundness recorded under the appropriate column. If two clasts types were present in the same interval, the sam e information was recorded for the subdominant (second order) clas t type. Where only holes or depressions caused by clasts were observed, the working half was also examined to better estimate clas t abundances. Details of unusual features were noted under th e DESClogik General interval comments column.  

Where different rock types are mixed, the interval was logged a s separate domains with the estimated percent abundance of each domain noted along with its lithology, grain size, color, and other characteristics as discussed above. Clasts ${<}2\ \mathrm{mm}$ were not broken int o domains but were noted under the matrix description.  

# Tephra type  

The occurrence of tephra layers is recorded in DESClogik bu t not noted on the VCDs. The type of tephra is defined visually an d classified as follows:  

$\mathrm{V}=$ vitric (primarily volcanic glass shards).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ pumice (white to yellowish pumice grains).   
${\boldsymbol{S}}=$ scoria (black–dark gray scoria grains).  

Characteristics of tephra layers such as grain size, color, an d sedimentary structures and characteristics of their components, such as glass type (bubble-walled, pumice-walled, or fibrous), glas s morphology, associated heavy minerals, and rock fragments, wer e recorded in DESClogik.  

Drilling disturbance  

Drilling-related disturbances are recorded in the Disturbanc e column using the symbols shown in Figure F5. The style of drillin g disturbance is described for soft and firm sediments or mudflo w units using the following terms:  

• Biscuit: unconsolidated material of intermediate stiffness show vertical variations in the degree of disturbance. Softer intervals are washed and/or soupy, whereas firmer intervals are relatively undisturbed.   
• Soupy or mousse-like: intervals are water saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
• Cracked or fractured: firm unconsolidated materials are broken but not displaced or rotated significantly.   
• Fragmented or brecciated: firm unconsolidated materials are pervasively broken and may be displaced or rotated.   
• Up-arching: disturbances result from weak to moderate coringinduced shear between the recovered material and core liner. These disturbances are easily recognized because layering is uniformly bent upward along the core margins (Jutzeler et al., 2014).   
• Fall-in: out-of-place material at the top of a core has fallen downhole onto the cored surface.   
• Flow-in, coring/drilling slurry, along-core gravel/sand contamination: stretching of soft, unconsolidated material and/or compressional shearing structures are severe and are attributed to coring/drilling. The particular type of deformation may also be noted (e.g., flow-in, gas expansion, etc.).   
• Bowed: layering contacts are slightly to moderately deformed but still subhorizontal and continuous.

The degree of fracturing within indurated recovered materials i s described using the following categories:  

• Slightly fractured: core pieces are in place and broken. • Moderately fractured: core pieces are in place or partly displaced, but original orientation is preserved or recognizable. • Highly fractured: core pieces are probably in correct stratigraphic sequence, but original orientation is lost. • Drilling breccia: core is crushed and broken into many small and angular pieces, with original orientation and stratigraphic position lost.  

# Sediment classification  

The unconsolidated materials recovered during Expedition 36 6 are composed of serpentinite muds, pelagic muds, volcaniclasti c ashes, and carbonate and siliceous biogenic components and are described using a classification scheme derived from Expedition 352 (Reagan et al., 2015b) and Stow (2005). The siliciclastic componen t is dominantly serpentinite mud with additional mineral and roc k fragments derived from igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphi c rocks. Serpentinite mud is classified on the basis of clast compositions, sizes, and abundances, whereas the matrix name is modifie d based on its color and the occurrence of other components (e.g., calcium carbonate or brucite).  

Serpentinite mudflows are named based on their principal lithology (grain size: mud, silt, or pebbly mud) with a prefix indicatin g composition (typically “serpentinite”) and a suffix for additional characteristics (e.g., “with lithic clasts”). “Pebbly mud” and “pebbl y mudstone” refer to unconsolidated and consolidated deposits (respectively) that are matrix-supported diamictons with a clay- t o sand-sized matrix and granule- to cobble-sized clasts. Because th e color of serpentinite mud is diagnostic, Munsell colors are tracke d closely in DESClogik.  

Pelagic sediments recovered from above or below the serpentinite mudflows comprise more typical siliciclastic component s (volcanic ash, clays, and silicate minerals). The biogenic components are found in pelagic sediments that cap the serpentinite mudflows and in volcanic ash deposits under the mud volcano edifices. They are composed of the skeletal remains of open-marine calcareous and siliceous microfauna (e.g., foraminifers and radiolarians), microflora (e.g., calcareous nannofossils and diatoms), and macrofossil fragments (shell fragments). The relative proportion of thes e two components is used to define the major classes of sediment i n this scheme.  

Naming conventions for Expedition 366 follow the genera l guidelines of the ODP sediment classification scheme (Mazzullo e t al., 1988), with the exception that a separate “mixed sediment” category was not distinguished during Expedition 366. As a result, biogenic sediments are those that contain $>\!50\%$ biogenic grains an d ${<}50\%$ siliciclastic grains, whereas siliciclastic sediments are thos e that contain ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ siliciclastic grains and ${<}50\%$ biogenic grains. Sediments containing ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ silt- and sand-sized primary volcani c grains are classified as ash layers. We follow the naming scheme o f Shepard (1954) for the classification of siliciclastic sediments an d sedimentary rocks depending on the relative proportion of sediments of different grain sizes. Sediment grain size divisions for bot h biogenic and siliciclastic components are based on Wentwort h (1922), with eight major textural categories defined on the basis o f the relative proportions of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized particles; however, distinguishing between some of these categories can be difficult  (e.g.,  silty  clay  versus  sandy  clay)  without  accurat e measurements of grain size abundances. The term “clay” is onl y used to describe particle size and is applied to both clay mineral s and all other grains ${<}4\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in size.  

The lithologic names assigned to these sediments consist of  a principal name and prefix based on composition and degree of lithification and/or texture as determined from visual descriptions o f the cores and from smear slide observations.  

For sediments that contain ${>}90\%$ of one component (either th e siliciclastic or biogenic component), only the principal names ar e used. For sediments with ${>}90\%$ biogenic components, the name applied indicates the most common type of biogenic grain. For example, a sediment composed of ${>}90\%$ calcareous nannofossils is calle d a nannofossil ooze/chalk, and a sediment composed of $50\%$ foraminifers and $45\%$ calcareous nannofossils is called a calcareou s ooze/chalk. For sediments with ${>}90\%$ siliciclastic grains, the principal names are based on the textural characteristics of all sedimen t particles (both siliciclastic and biogenic).  

For sediments that contain significant mixtures of siliciclasti c and biogenic components (between $10\%$ and $90\%$ of both siliciclastic and biogenic components), the principal names are determine d by the more abundant component. If the siliciclastic component s are more abundant, the principal names are based on the textura l characteristics of all sediment particles (both siliciclastic and biogenic). If the biogenic components are more abundant, the principa l names are based on the predominant biogenic components.  

If a microfossil group composes $10\%{-}50\%$ of the sediment an d this group is not included as part of the principal name, minor modifiers are used. When a microfossil group (e.g., diatoms, nannofossils, or foraminifers) comprises $20\%{-}50\%$ of the sediment,  a minor modifier consisting of the component name hyphenated wit h the suffix “-rich” (e.g., diatom-rich clay) is used.  

If one component forms $80\%{-}90\%$ of the sediment, the principa l name is followed by a minor modifier (e.g., “with diatoms”), with th e minor modifier based on the most abundant component that form s $10\%{-20\%}$ of the sediment. If the minor component is biogenic, th e modifier describes the group of biogenic grains that exceeds th e $10\%$ abundance threshold. If the minor component is siliciclastic, the minor modifier is based on the texture of the siliciclastic fraction.  

The following terms describe lithification that varies dependin g on the dominant composition:  

• Sediments composed predominantly of siliciclastic materials: if the sediment can be deformed easily with a finger, no lithification term is added and the sediment is named for the dominant grain size (i.e., sand, silt, or clay). For more consolidated material, the lithification suffix “-stone” is appended to the dominant size classification (e.g., claystone), except for gravel-sized sediment, when the terms conglomerate or breccia are used.   
• Sediments composed predominantly of calcareous, pelagic organisms (e.g., calcareous nannofossils and/or foraminifers): the lithification terms “ooze” and “chalk” reflect whether the sediment can be deformed with a finger (ooze) or can be scratched easily by a fingernail (chalk).   
• Sediments composed predominantly of siliceous microfossils (diatoms, radiolarians, and siliceous sponge spicules): the lithification terms “ooze” and “radiolarite/diatomite” reflect whether the sediment can be deformed with a finger (ooze) or cannot be easily deformed manually (radiolarite/diatomite). The term “chert” is applied to lithified, siliceous sediments that are amorphous or have microscopically fine-grained texture.   
• Sediments composed of a mixture of calcareous pelagic organisms and siliceous microfossils and sediments composed of a mixture of siliceous microfossils: the lithification terms “ooze” and “indurated sediment” reflect whether the sediment can be deformed with a finger (ooze) or cannot be easily deformed manually (indurated sediment).  

The subclassification of volcaniclastic sediments followed her e differs from the standard ODP classification (Mazzullo et al., 1988 ) in that we adopted a descriptive (nongenetic) terminology similar t o that employed during ODP Leg 197 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002a) and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 324 (Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010). Unless an unequivocally pyroclasti c origin for volcanogenic particles could be determined, we simpl y described these deposits as for siliciclastic sediment (i.e., sand, silt, etc.).  

Where evidence for a pyroclastic origin was compelling, we adopted the classification scheme of Fisher and Schmincke (1984). I n these instances, we used the grain size terms “volcanic blocks” $_{>64}$ mm), “lapilli/lapillistone” $\mathrm{2-64\mm})$ , and “ash/tuff” ( $^{<2}\,\mathrm{mm})$ . Th e term “hyaloclastite” was used for vitroclastic (i.e., glassy) material s produced by the interaction of water and hot magma or lava (Fishe r and Schmincke, 1984).  

# Spectrophotometry  

Reflectance of visible light from the archive half cores of unconsolidated material was measured using an Ocean Optics USB400 0 spectrophotometer mounted on the automated SHMSL. Freshl y split soft cores were covered with clear plastic wrap and placed o n the SHMSL. Measurements were taken at 1.0 or $2.0~\mathrm{cm}$ spacing t o provide a high-resolution stratigraphic record of color variations fo r visible wavelengths. Spectral data are routinely reduced to th e $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color space for output and presentation, in which $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ is lightness (greater value $=$ lighter) in the range between 0 (black) and 10 0 (white), $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ is the red-green value (greater value $=$ redder) in th e range between $^{-60}$ (green) and 60 (red), and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is the yellow-blu e value (greater value $=$ yellower) in the range between $^{-60}$ (blue) an d 60 (yellow). The color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on tw o spectra, pure white (reference) and pure black (dark). Each measurement was recorded in wide spectral bands from 400 to $900\;\mathrm{nm}$ in $2\,\mathrm{nm}$ steps. Each measurement takes ${\sim}5\;s$ .  

The SHMSL takes measurements in empty intervals and ove r intervals where the core surface is well below the level of the cor e liner, but it cannot recognize relatively small cracks, disturbed area s of core, or plastic section dividers. Thus, SHMSL data may contai n spurious measurements that have to be edited out of the data set b y the user. Additional detailed information about measurement an d interpretation of spectral data can be found in Balsam et al. (1997, 1998) and Balsam and Damuth (2000).  

# Natural gamma radiation  

NGR occurs primarily as a result of the decay of $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ an d $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ isotopes. This radiation is measured using the NGRL (see Physical properties). Data generated from this instrument are used t o augment geologic interpretations.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartington Instruments MS2E point sensor (high-resolution surface-scanning sensor) on the SHMSL. Because the SHMSL demands flush contac t between the magnetic susceptibility point sensor and the split core, measurements were made on the archive halves of split cores tha t were covered with clear plastic wrap. Measurements were taken a t 1.0 or $2.0\,\mathrm{cm}$ spacing. Measurement resolution was 1.0 SI, and eac h measurement integrated a volume of $10.5~\mathrm{mm}\times\,3.8~\mathrm{mm}\times\,4~\mathrm{mm},$ where $10.5\;\mathrm{mm}$ is the length perpendicular to the core axis, $3.8\;\mathrm{mm}$ is the width along the core axis, and $4\,\mathrm{mm}$ is the depth into the core. One measurement was taken at each measurement position.  

# Smear slide observation  

Smear slide samples of the main lithologies were collected fro m the working half of each core when the recovery was not lithified. Additional samples were collected from areas of interest (e.g., laminations, ash layers, and nodules). A small sample of unconsolidate d material was taken with a wooden toothpick and put on a $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}\times$ $7.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ glass slide. The sample was homogenized with a drop of deionized water and evenly spread across the slide to create a very thi n (about $<50\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ ) uniform layer of grains for quantification. The dispersed sample was dried on a hot plate. A drop of Norland optica l adhesive was added as a mounting medium to a coverslip, whic h was carefully placed on the dried sample to prevent air bubbles fro m being trapped in the adhesive. The smear slide was then fixed in a n ultraviolet light box.  

Smear slides were examined with a transmitted-light petrographic microscope equipped with a standard eyepiece micrometer. The textures of siliciclastic grains (relative abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains) and the proportions and presence of biogeni c and mineral components were recorded and entered into DESClogik. Biogenic and mineral components were identified, and thei r percentage abundances were visually estimated according to th e method of Rothwell (1989). The mineralogy of clay-sized grain s could not be determined from smear slides. Note that smear slid e analyses tend to underestimate the amount of sand-sized and large r grains because these grains are difficult to incorporate onto th e slide.  

# Igneous and metamorphic petrology and alteration  

The procedures for core description outlined here were adapte d from ODP Legs 125 and 209 (Fryer et al., 1990; Kelemen, Kikawa, Miller, et al., 2004) and Expedition 352 to the Izu-Bonin-Marian a forearc (Reagan et al., 2015a). All of the igneous and metamorphi c rocks encountered during this expedition occur as clasts in serpentinite mudflow deposits or in fines-depleted gravel deposit s (formed by drilling disturbance). As a result, all igneous and metamorphic rocks were described initially within the Sediment tab i n DESClogik; all clasts sampled for shipboard analysis were also described in the appropriate tab within DESClogik: Intrusive_mantle, Extrusive_hyabyssal, or Metamorphic. Alteration features includin g secondary mineral assemblages and veins were described in the Alteration and Veins_halos tabs. Features cataloged in these tabs include the following:  

• Lithology, modal abundances and appearances, and characteristic igneous or metamorphic textures, and • Alteration assemblages and parageneses, as well as vein and vesicle infillings and halos.  

These macroscopic observations were combined with detaile d thin section petrographic studies of key lithologies and alteratio n intervals.  

Before splitting sections into working and archive halves, eac h hard rock piece large enough to be curated individually was labele d with unique piece/subpiece numbers from the top to the botto m centimeter of each section. If the top and bottom of a piece of roc k could be determined, an arrow was added to the label to indicate th e uphole direction. Archive halves were imaged using the SHIL.  

After imaging, archive halves were analyzed for color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility at $1{-}2.5~\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals using th e SHMSL (see Physical properties). Working halves were sample d for shipboard physical properties, paleomagnetic studies, thin sections, and inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis.  

Each igneous and metamorphic clast was first examined macroscopically and described for petrologic and alteration characteristics, and then structures were described (see Structural geology) . All descriptions during Expedition 366 were made on the archiv e halves of the cores, except for thin sections, which were sample d from the working halves. For macroscopic observations and descriptions, DESClogik was used to record the primary igneous characteristics (e.g., lithology, texture, modal mineralogy, and grain size ) and alteration (e.g., color, secondary minerals, and vein/fracture fillings). Mineral modes, sizes, and textures were estimated by examining the archive halves under binocular microscopes or using han d lenses with graticules of $0.1~\mathrm{mm}$ . For microscopic observations, a s many as 12 thin sections were made daily, and the descriptions wer e entered in DESClogik. Macroscopic features observed in the core s are summarized and presented in the VCDs.  

# Igneous petrology  

Igneous rocks encountered during Expedition 366 include  a range of ultramafic rocks of presumed mantle origin and, muc h more rarely, volcanic or metavolcanic rocks, all as clasts within th e serpentinite mudflow units.  

Plutonic and mantle rocks: primary igneous lithologies and features Igneous rock names were assigned a primary lithology nam e based on the mineral phases present prior to alteration using the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) classificatio n scheme for igneous rocks (LeMaitre et al., 1989), a prefix that includes a grain-size designation or other descriptive feature, and a n optional suffix for special features. Grain sizes, modal mineralogy, textures, and mineral shapes were recorded, and the full rock nam e is concatenated from the primary lithology, prefix, and suffix. Fo r severely altered rocks, the term “primary assemblage” was ofte n used to refer to the estimated prealteration mineral assemblage. Where alteration in ultramafic rocks was so extensive that estimation of the primary phase assemblages was not possible, the protolith  is  called  “serpentinite.” If  primary assemblages  and thei r pseudomorphs and textures could be recognized in ultramafic samples, even though they are partially or completely replaced, the roc k name used was based on the reconstructed primary assemblage an d was termed either “serpentinized” or “altered” (i.e., serpentinize d dunite, altered lherzolite, etc.).  

Ultramafic rocks are by far the most common igneous clast type, and their nomenclature required special attention. The most common ultramafic rocks are classified based on abundance of primar y minerals, grain size, and texture. When modal analyses can be reliably obtained, ultramafic rocks are classified according to th e Streckeisen (1974) classification as follows (Figure F7):  

Dunite $=$ olivine $>90\%$ .   
Lherzolite $=$ olivine $>40\%$ , orthopyroxenite $>5\%$ , clinopyroxenite $>5\%$ .   
Harzburgite $=$ olivine $>40\%$ , orthopyroxenite $>5\%$ , clinopyroxenite $<5\%$ .   
Wehrlite $=$ olivine $>40\%$ , orthopyroxenite $<5\%$ , clinopyroxenite $>5\%$ .   
Orthopyroxenite $=$ orthopyroxenite (enstatite) $>90\%$ .   
Clinopyroxenite $=$ clinopyroxene (diopside) $>90\%$ .   
Websterite $=$ olivine $<5\%$ , orthopyroxenite $>5\%$ , clinopyroxenite $>5\%$ .   
Olivine websterite $=$ olivine $5\%{-}40\%$ , orthopyroxenite $>5\%$ , clinopyroxenite $>5\%$ .   
Olivine orthopyroxenite $=$ olivine $5\%{-}40\%$ , orthopyroxenite $>$ $5\%$ , clinopyroxenite $<5\%$ .   
Olivine clinopyroxenite $=$ olivine $5\%{-}40\%$ , orthopyroxenite $<$ $5\%$ , clinopyroxenite $>5\%$ .   
Serpentinite $=$ any largely serpentinized ultramafic rock in which the primary lithology can no longer be discerned.  

The first four rock types (dunite, lherzolite, harzburgite, an d wehrlite) are often referred to collectively as “peridotites,” wherea s rocks dominated by pyroxene are referred to collectively as “pyroxenites” (websterite, orthopyroxenite, clinopyroxenite, and their olivine-bearing namesakes). Typical accessory minerals may include a n aluminous phase such as spinel (chromite), plagioclase, or garnet. These may be added as a prefix to the primary rock name. Prefixe s are commonly only added when plagioclase or garnet-bearing varieties are present; most peridotites are spinel bearing, and when n o aluminous phase is listed, it can be assumed that spinel or chromit e is present.  

Ultramafic rocks typically have special textural characteristic s that require definition (Mercier and Nicolas, 1975; Nelson Pike an d Schwarzman, 1977) for those who are not specialists in ultramafi c petrology. Some of the more common terms include the following:

Figure F7. Modal classification scheme for plutonic igneous rocks (afte r Streckeisen, 1974).  

• Tectonite: a general term applied to mantle-derived peridotites to distinguish them from cumulate peridotites. Most commonly, these are porphyroclastic.   
• Porphyroclastic: a common peridotite texture with large grains of enstatite and more rarely olivine set in groundmass of finer grained olivine and pyroxene. Olivine is typically kink-banded with small, strain-free neoblasts.   
• Equigranular equant (mosaic): olivine and enstatite are similar in size with smooth curvilinear grain boundaries, and $120^{\circ}$ triple grain boundaries are common, with diopside and spinel scattered throughout, commonly at triple-grain boundaries. Aspect ratios are close to 1.0. This texture resembles that of granulites in high-grade gneiss terranes.   
• Equigranular tabular: identical to equigranular equant but with olivine and enstatite aspect ratios typically 2:1 or larger.   
• Protogranular: olivine and enstatite are large $(3{-}4\,\mathrm{mm})$ and similar in size with curvilinear grain boundaries and no foliation. Spinel occurs as amoeboid-shaped clusters typically associated with diopside and enstatite. The spinel–diopside clusters are interpreted as representing exsolution from primary Al- and Carich enstatite.   
• Cataclastic to ultracataclastic: rock is strongly deformed under brittle conditions. Uniformly small grain size is common, olivine and pyroxene are highly kinked or granulated, and serrated grain boundaries occur.   
• Mylonitic: rock is strongly deformed under ductile conditions. Most grains are small and recrystallized (neoblasts) with less common, highly strained augen of olivine or pyroxene.   
• Decussate: typical of pyroxenites. Blocky-shaped pyroxenes form a brick-like intergrowth where crystal shapes dominate the texture.  

Ultramafic rocks may be highly altered to serpentinite yet stil l retain their primary textural characteristics. Whenever possible, partially or largely serpentinized peridotites that retain their primary textures are referred to by the name consistent with their primary mineralogy, with or without the modifier “serpentinized. ” Where the primary lithology is obscured by deformation or pervasive serpentinization, these rocks were referred to simply as “serpentinites.” There are a number of terms specific to serpentinize d ultramafic rocks that are commonly used and may occur in the cor e descriptions (Figure F8).  

Pseudomorphic textures include the following:  

• Mesh texture: a common texture that results from the serpentinization of olivine. It resembles a fine mesh in thin section, consisting of fibrous mesh rims that surround massive mesh centers. Mesh centers may consist of fine-grained serpentine or may retain primary olivine. This texture typically forms in two or more stages.   
• Hourglass texture: results from serpentinization of olivine in a single stage, such that the fibrous mesh rims extend to the center of the grain.   
• Bastite: a topotaxic (meaning “placement” or “local” arrangement; i.e., of crystallographic orientation) replacement of pyroxene or amphibole by serpentine. Typically, this refers to enstatite grains that are replaced by serpentine without altering the morphology of the original grain; thus, they resemble the unaltered enstatite grains macroscopically.  

Nonpseudomorphic textures include the following:  

• Ribbon texture: an extreme texture from pervasive serpentinization or deformation in which serpentine occurs as zones of parallel serpentine fibers that define thin bands or ribbons. This texture may be elongate parallel to foliation if foliation is present (not shown in Figure F8).   
• Interpenetrating texture: interlocking of mutually interfering, anhedral elongate blades, flakes, or plates that form a tight interpenetrating fabric. It begins as randomly oriented blades in lizardite mesh textures and progresses to massive interlocking texture. It is commonly formed as antigorite crystallizes.   
• Interlocking texture: interlocking texture of irregular equant (or more rarely, spherulitic) grains. It begins in isolated patches that grow together as reaction progresses. It differs from interpenetrating texture by lack of elongate grains and may consist of lizardite or antigorite.  

Macroscopic descriptors include the following:  

• Massive: serpentinite that does not preserve primary features and contains little or no foliation or schistosity. • Phacoidal: a schistose form of serpentine composed of scales or chips of serpentine $1\;\mathrm{mm}$ or larger in size that may have slickensided surfaces and whose long axes define an anastomosing foliation. This foliation may enclose angular to subangular blocks of unsheared serpentinite (1 cm or larger in size) or may be associated with horizontal or vertical convolute bedding.  

Serpentinized ultramafic rocks are commonly associated with  a large range of vein types (e.g., fibrous chrysotile, crack-seal, etc.). Mineral assemblages of such veins often cannot be identified macroscopically; if not stated otherwise, veins referred to as “serpentin e veins” may consist of pure serpentine or of serpentine with accessory minerals (e.g., brucite, magnetite, etc.). Any large serpentin e veins (e.g., width $>0.5\ \mathrm{cm}$ ) were described on DESClogik using th e Veins_halos tab. The descriptions and structures of small veins wer e noted as a texture comment in the appropriate table in DESClogi k (Intrusive_mantle, Volcanic_hypabyssal, or Metamorphic).

# Primary plutonic minerals  

The primary rock-forming minerals recovered were olivine , orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, spinel, plagioclase, Fe-Ti oxide, an d amphibole. For each, the following data are available for each sit e based on thin section examination:  

• Visually estimated modal percent of the primary original minerals;   
• Maximum and average grain size; and   
• Crystal shape, habit, and texture.  

Accessory phases, when present, were also noted. The moda l percentage of the mineral includes both the fresh and altered part s of the rocks interpreted to represent that mineral. Grain size refer s to the average long dimension of the minerals and is given in millimeters, as are the crystal sizes. The shape describes the aspect rati o of the grains and was used when deformation had modified th e original crystal morphology. The aspect ratio is the ratio of th e short to the long dimension of the crystal. The terms “euhedral, ” “subhedral,” “anhedral,” and “interstitial” were used to describe th e shapes of crystals interpreted to preserve their igneous morphology. The shapes are divided into four classes:  

• Equant: aspect ratio $=$ less than 1:2.   
• Subequant: aspect ratio $=1:2$ to 1:3.   
• Tabular: aspect ratio $=1{:}3$ to 1:5.   
• Elongate: aspect ratio $=$ more than 1:5.  

Spinel occurs in various shapes that can be divided into thre e categories:  

1. Equant: the shape is equidimensional with flat and/or curved surfaces.   
2. Interstitial: transitional category between vermicular and equant. The outer surfaces of these spinels are often concave outward and have thin tips departing from the corner of the grain (“holly leaf” habit).   
3. Vermicular or amoeboid: intricate shape forming symplectic (i.e., fine-grained) intergrowths with pyroxenes and/or olivine (typically at their margins). Characteristic of protogranular textures.  

The presence of linear arrays of spinel grains, which sometime s form in peridotite and are termed “trains,” was noted in the comments. Descriptions and estimates are based primarily on handsample inspection with a more limited sample suite also studied i n petrographic thin sections. Thin section observations were used t o refine the hand-sample descriptions.  

Volcanic and basaltic hypabyssal rocks: primary igneous lithologies and features  

Volcanic rock clasts recovered during Expedition 366 are les s common than ultramafic clasts but are not rare, and they rang e from pebble-sized clasts to boulders. They are commonly partiall y altered, but their primary mineralogy and textures are recognizabl e and they often preserve relatively unaltered clinopyroxenes, although plagioclase is generally pervasively altered to sericite. Naming conventions follow those of Expedition 352 (Reagan et al., 2015b). Porphyritic basaltic rocks were named according to majo r phenocryst phase(s) when the total abundance of phenocrysts wa s ${>}1\%$ . The most abundant phenocrysts appear last in the phenocryst-based lithology name. The term “phenocryst” was used fo r any crystal that was (1) significantly larger (typically at least fiv e times) than the average size of the groundmass crystals, $(2)>\!1\;\mathrm{mm}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and (3) euhedral or subhedral. “Skeletal” phenocrysts are phenocrysts that grew as, or have been corroded to, a skeletal framewor k with  a  high  proportion  of  internal  voids.  The  term  “microphenocryst” was used for crystals larger than the modal groundmass grain size but smaller than $1\ \mathrm{mm}$ and was reported in th e Microscopic (thin section) description template in DESClogik an d in the Lithologic unit summary in the Description column on th e VCDs. A prefix was applied as a modifier to the primary litholog y names to indicate the abundance of phenocrysts in the hand samples as follows:  

Aphyric $=-1\%$ phenocrysts.   
Sparsely phyric $=1\%{-}5\%$ phenocrysts.   
Moderately phyric $=>\!5\%{-}10\%$ phenocrysts.   
Highly phyric $=>\!10\%$ phenocrysts.  

Aphyric rocks were not assigned any mineralogical modifier. Likewise, in coarser grained rocks with seriate to equigranular textures, we did not use modifiers unless there was a clear distinction in siz e between phenocrysts and groundmass crystals. The term “dolerite ” was used for fine- to medium-grained basaltic rocks containin g clinopyroxene and plagioclase with ophitic to subophitic texture.  

Groundmass is defined as the finer grained matrix (or the mesostasis) between the phenocryst phases, if the latter are present. Groundmass is generally characterized by its texture and grain siz e with the following standard notation:  

$\mathsf{G}=\mathsf{g l a s s y.}$ $\mathbf{cx}=$ cryptocrystalline $^{<0.1\;\mathrm{mm})}$ ).   
$\upmu\mathrm{x}=$ microcrystalline $(0.1{-}0.2\ \mathrm{mm})$ ).   
fg $=$ fine grained $(>\!0.2{-}1\ \mathrm{mm})$ ).   
$\mathbf{mg}=$ medium grained $\left(>\!1{-}2\,\mathrm{mm}\right)$ .   
${\bf c g}={}$ coarse grained $\scriptstyle>2\;\mathrm{mm})$ .  

An estimate of the average modal groundmass size (in millimeters ) is included in the VCDs, whereas in the reports and descriptio n summaries we used descriptive terms, for example, fine-grained o r coarse-grained groundmasses.  

For volcanic and hypabyssal basaltic rocks, the following term s were used to describe textures when microlites are present in th e groundmass:  

• Variolitic (fan-like arrangement of divergent microlites),   
• Intergranular (olivine and pyroxene grains between plagioclase laths),   
• Intersertal (glass between plagioclase laths),   
• Subophitic (partial inclusion of plagioclase in clinopyroxene), and   
• Ophitic (total inclusion of plagioclase in clinopyroxene).  

Flow textures present in the groundmass were described as follows: • Trachytic (subparallel arrangement of plagioclase laths in the groundmass), • Pilotaxitic (aligned plagioclase microlites embedded in a matrix of granular and usually smaller clinopyroxene grains), and • Hyalopilitic (aligned plagioclase microlites with glassy matrix).  

Rock colors were determined on a wet, cut archive half surfac e using Munsell soil color charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc. , 1994) and converted to a more intuitive color name. Wetting of th e rock was carried out using tap water and a sponge. Wetting wa s kept to a minimum because of adsorption of water by clay mineral s (particularly saponite and celadonite) that could be present in th e core.  

# Metamorphic petrology  

Metamorphic basic rocks encountered during Expedition 36 6 all occur as clasts within the serpentinite mudflows. They mostl y consist of greenschist metabasites and metagabbros. These clast s are typically less than $3~\mathrm{cm}$ in size. The greenschist clasts are assumed to be derived from the subduction channel of the Marian a convergent margin system. All clasts $>\!2\;\mathrm{cm}$ receive a piece numbe r during curation and were categorized using the Metamorphic tab i n DESClogik.  

In general, the major features of metamorphic rocks were use d for their classification (Schmid et al., 2007):  

• Minerals present,   
• Structure of the rock,   
• Nature of the rock prior to metamorphism,   
• Genetic conditions of metamorphism (usually in terms of pressure and temperature, with or without deformation), and • Chemical composition of the rock.  

The considerable diversity of mineralogical names found i n metamorphic rocks are conveyed by the use of mineral names a s prefixes to the root structural term (for example, plagioclase–pyroxene metabasite), with the mineral names arranged in order of increasing modal abundance. The fundamental terms (based on roc k type alone) are placed at the end of compound hyphenated names o f the type described previously. The metamorphic rocks are therefor e named using one of the three fundamental terms (protolith, dominant mineral if $275\%$ , or specific name like greenschist) to conve y the basic rock type, whereas the mineralogical features are given b y prefixing the rock type with the names of the appropriate mineral constituents. A compound hyphenated name may always be applie d and allows a systematic set of names for petrographic descriptions.  

Three terms essentially cover the principal varieties of lithologies found in metamorphic rocks, particularly as seen in han d specimen (and are therefore easily applicable). These three term s are schist, gneiss, and granofels and reflect the degree of fissility o r schistosity shown by the rock (preferred orientation of nonequan t mineral grains or grain aggregates produced by metamorphic processes). If the schistosity in a metamorphic rock is well developed, the rock has a schistose structure and is termed a “schist.” If it i s poorly developed, the rock has a gneissose structure and is termed  a “gneiss.” If the rock has a medium- to coarse-grained granoblasti c texture without or with only indistinct foliation or lineation it i s termed a “granofels.”  

Metamorphic rocks not named by the application of the fundamental terms based on the protolith or a dominant mineral are categorized by specific names like blueschist, greenschist, amphibolite, eclogite, or granulite. Blueschists are metamorphic rocks characterized by the presence of high-pressure metamorphic assemblage s such as jadeite-quartz, lawsonite, phengite, crossite, or glaucophane. Greenschists are metamorphic rocks characterized by intermediate  pressure–temperature  assemblages,  which  typicall y comprise albite, actinolite, chlorite, and epidote. Amphibolites reflect higher temperature metamorphism than greenschists; the y typically contain plagioclase and hornblende, along with other minerals. Eclogites are garnet-omphacite rocks metamorphosed unde r higher pressure conditions than blueschists. Granulites form a t higher temperatures than amphibolites and represent metamorphism at higher temperatures and pressures.  

The description of fault rocks is based on the distinction between  cataclastic  and  mylonitic  (plastic–viscous)  deformatio n mechanisms (Brodie et al., 2007). Mylonites are cohesive and characterized by well-developed schistosity resulting from tectonic reduction  of  grain  sizes  and  commonly  contain  rounde d porphyroclasts and lithic fragments of similar composition to minerals in the matrix. Fine-scale layering is commonly present. Brittl e deformation of some minerals may be present, but deformation i s commonly plastic. Mylonites may be divided according to the relative proportion of finer grained matrix into protomylonite, mesomylonite, and ultramylonite.  

Cataclasites (cataclastic rocks) are cohesive with a poorly developed or absent schistosity or are incohesive, characterized by generally angular porphyroclasts and lithic fragments in a finer graine d matrix of similar composition. Generally, no preferred orientatio n of grains of individual fragments is present as a result of deformation, but fractures may have a preferred orientation. Foliation is no t generated unless the fragments are drawn out or new minerals gro w during deformation. Plastic deformation may be present but is always subordinate to some combination of fracturing, rotation, an d frictional sliding of particles. Cataclasites may be divided accordin g to the relative proportion of finer grained matrix into protocataclasite, mesocataclasite, and ultracataclasite. Fault gouges are incohesive, clay-rich, fine- to  ultrafine-grained cataclasites  that  ma y possess a schistosity and contain ${<}30\%$ visible fragments. Lithi c clasts may be present.  

# Alteration, veins, and halos  

Alteration features including secondary mineral assemblage s and veins were described in the Alteration and Veins_halos tabs. Methods for describing alteration include hand-sample descriptions and inspection of thin sections. These observations provide d information on the alteration of primary igneous features such a s phenocrysts, groundmass minerals, and volcanic glass. In addition, the abundance of veins and vesicles and the succession of infillin g materials were recorded to ascertain the order of mineral precipitation.  

# Alteration  

Alteration minerals are identified by color, habit and shape, association with primary minerals (if distinguishable), and hardness.  

Visual estimates of alteration degree, type, color, and textures (e.g., halos and patches) were recorded, as well as abundance (percentage) of minerals filling veins and vesicles and the proportion of altered groundmass, volcanic glass, and all the different primar y phenocryst phases. Complications arise in identification of secondary phases because many minerals produced during submarine alteration  are  visually  similar,  often  being  microcrystalline  o r amorphous, and are thus indistinguishable in the cores. Hence, identification of some alteration phases remains preliminary pending detailed shore-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies and analyses by electron microprobe, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and so on. The degree of the overall background alteration of groundmas s and glass was defined and reported graphically on the VCDs according to various ranges of intensity in the alteration state. Different patterns were used to indicate slight, moderate, high, complete, or no (fresh) alteration. Alteration color was defined using Munsell soil color charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 1994) and converted to a more intuitive color name (dark blue-gray, red-brown, etc.).  

# Veins and halos  

During Expedition 366, descriptions of veins included location , shape, crosscutting nature, width, color, and the amount (percentage) and nature of filling minerals. Vein orientation data were exclusively taken from veins from their in situ orientation with referenc e to the host rock (see Structural geology). All features were recorded in DESClogik using a series of codes for vein shape (straight, sigmoidal, irregular, pull-apart, and fault vein), connectivity (isolated, single, branched, and network), texture (massive, cross-fiber, slip-fiber, vuggy, and polycrystalline), structure (simple, composite, banded, haloed, and intravenous), and geometry (en echelon, ribbon, and cross fractures) (Figure F5).  

Alteration halos commonly form around hydrothermal vein s and indicate transfer of fluids of varying composition into the surrounding rock. They can be different from the overall backgroun d alteration and vesicle filling in color, secondary mineral composition, and abundance. Color, thickness, and secondary minerals of alteration halos were recorded in the Veins_halo tab of DESClogik. Alteration color was defined using Munsell soil color charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 1994) and converted to a more intuitiv e color name (dark blue-gray, red-brown, etc.).  

# Macroscopic visual core description  

We used DESClogik to document each section of the igneou s cores and their alteration by uploading our descriptions into th e central LIMS database. These uploaded data were then used to produce VCDs, which include a simplified graphical representation o f the core (for each section) with accompanying descriptions of th e features observed. The VCDs display the following items:  

• Description summary for each igneous lithologic unit;   
• Depth in meters below seafloor (based on the CSF-A depth scale);   
• Scale for core section length $(0{-}150\,\mathrm{cm})$ );   
• Sample piece number;   
• Scanned digital image of the archive half;   
• Sample type and position of intervals selected for different types of shipboard analytical studies, such as thin sections (TS), ICPAES (ICP), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), paleomagnetism, and physical properties (PP);   
• Graphical representation of lithology;   
• Igneous lithologic unit number;   
• Dominant and subdominant clast abundance;   
• Drilling disturbance;   
•  Symbolized structural information;   
• Plot of color reflectance with total reflectance $\left(\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\right)$ , red $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\right)$ , and blue $\left(\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)$ data arranged side by side;   
• Plot of NGR;   
• Plot of bulk and MAD densities;   
• Plot of point source and whole-round magnetic susceptibility measurements; and   
• Plot of shear strength.  

# Microscopic thin section description  

Thin section analyses of sampled core intervals were used t o complement and refine macroscopic core observations. Shipboar d thin sections were selected, examined, and logged to represent bot h typical and unusual lithologies as they occurred. To maintain consistency, the same terminology and nomenclature are used for macroscopic and microscopic descriptions. Phenocryst assemblage s (and their modal percentages, shapes, habits, and sizes), groundmass, and alteration phases were determined, and textural feature s were described. All observations were entered into the LIMS database with a special DESClogik thin section template. Downloade d tabular reports of all thin section descriptions can be found in Cor e descriptions.  

Thin section descriptions include both primary (igneous o r metamorphic) and secondary (alteration) features, for example, textural and structural features, grain size of phenocrysts and groundmass minerals, mineralogy, abundance (percentage), inclusions, alteration color, alteration extent (percentage) in the total rock, an d alteration veins (type and number).  

Textural terms used are defined by MacKenzie et al. (1982) an d include the following:  

• Heterogranular (different crystal sizes),   
• Equigranular (similar crystal sizes),   
• Seriate (continuous range in grain size),   
• Porphyritic (increasing presence of phenocrysts),   
• Glomeroporphyritic (containing clusters of phenocrysts),   
• Holohyaline ( $100\%$ glass),   
• Hypo- or holocrystalline ( $100\%$ crystals),   
• Variolitic (fine, radiating fibers of plagioclase or pyroxene),   
• Intergranular (olivine and pyroxene grains between plagioclase laths),   
• Intersertal (groundmass fills the interstices between unoriented feldspar laths),   
• Ophitic (lath-shaped euhedral crystals of plagioclase, grouped radially or in an irregular mesh, completely surrounded with large anhedral crystals of pyroxene), and   
• Subophitic (partial inclusion of plagioclase in pyroxene).  

Textural terms for plutonic and metamorphic rocks include th e following:  

• Equigranular equant (uniform grain size and equant grain shape),   
• Equigranular tabular (uniform grain size and tabular, elongate grain shape),   
• Porphyroclastic (clasts embedded within fine grain matrix),   
• Porphyroblastic (metamorphic blasts embedded within finegrained matrix),   
• Granoblastic (coarse-grained, equigranular fabric),   
• Poikiloblastic (elongate, lozenge-shaped metamorphic blasts embedded within fine-grained matrix),   
• Decussate (interlocking, randomly oriented arrangement of mineral grains), and   
• Nodular (rounded clasts or blasts embedded within fine grained matrix).  

Recovered ultramafic clasts commonly display a high degree o f serpentinization $(>\!80\%)$ and are described in the Intrusive_mantl e tab in DESClogik. Textural terms for these rocks are based o n Wicks and Whittaker (1977). The texture of the clast is first described as “pseudomorphic” or “nonpseudomorphic.” When th e texture is pseudomorphic, the initial mode and the degree of serpentinization of peridotite minerals are given per mineral domai n (e.g., orthopyroxene, olivine, or clinopyroxene) in DESClogik. Serpentine textures are defined as follows (Figure F5):  

• Bastite (serpentine pseudomorph after orthopyroxene),   
• Mesh (serpentine pseudomorph after olivine composed of a fibrous rim and an isotropic core),   
• Hourglass (serpentine pseudomorph after olivine composed of fibrous serpentine),   
• Interpenetrating (serpentine nonpseudomorphic texture of mutually interfering, anhedral elongate blades, flakes, or plates),   
• Interlocking (serpentine nonpseudomorphic texture of irregular equant grains),   
• Fibrous (parallel fibers orientated perpendicularly to the vein footwall), and   
• Crack-seal (banded veins of fibrous serpentine displaying an overall preferred orientation perpendicular to the vein footwall; micrometric interstices separate the different layers) (Andreani et al., 2004).  

Late stages of alteration (e.g., carbonated breccia or ophicarbonate) are described as a second sample domain in DESClogik. To differentiate late stages of alteration from serpentinization, thes e features are described in the Alteration tab in DESClogic.  

Furthermore, for alteration descriptions, thin sections were examined to do the following:  

• Confirm macroscopic identification of secondary minerals;   
• Determine their mode of occurrence in terms of vesicle and void fillings, vein composition, and primary mineral replacement;   
• Determine the chronological relationships between different secondary minerals;   
• Establish the distribution, occurrences, and abundance of secondary minerals downhole;   
• Quantify the overall amount of alteration in the basaltic rocks;   
• Identify mineralogies of vein and vesicle infillings, as well as cement and voids present in basaltic breccia; and   
• Calculate the total alteration (percentage) using the modal proportions of phenocrysts and groundmass minerals and their respective percentages of alteration.  

For structural descriptions, thin sections were examined following Kelemen, Kikawa, Miller, et al. (2004) to determine the following:  

• Anisotropy, including the shape-preferred orientation of minerals and clasts and foliation when possible;   
• Grain shape;   
• Grain boundaries (straight, irregular, sutured, and lobate);   
• Grain internal structures (e.g., undulatory extinction, subgrains, deformation bands, and twins); and   
• Microfractures.  

In some cases, individual thin sections contain multiple domains that required separate description. In DESClogik, the use r can enter multiple records for a single thin section in which mor e than one domain can be recognized. We defined the “domain” concept of DESClogik based on apparent observable differences i n lithology, alteration, vesicle banding and grouping, veining, and, when more than one clast type is present, volcaniclastic lithologies. Thin sections typically are taken so they represent a singular lithology, and thus by definition they encompass a single lithology domain. In some cases, thin sections contain more than one litholog y with a sharp or diffuse boundary splitting the thin section into tw o lithology domains, whereby a diffuse (wider) boundary zone coul d be defined as a separate, third domain. Alteration can result in man y different domains in a rock, including the background alteratio n and various halos surrounding cracks and veins. Multiple generations of veins with different filling patterns were often visible in thi n section; some were therefore assigned different domain names.  

Finally, estimated volume percentages were required to quantif y phase abundances. In DESClogik, the user is required to ente r modal percentages of mineral phases for all rocks. The whole-roc k constituents become the sum of all mineral phases present; vein s and void spaces are ignored in this calculation. In DESClogik, th e user records the percentage of the originally present minera l phases, whenever possible, the replacement phases, and how muc h has been replaced (i.e., altered or filled) ensuring that Original $(\%)=$ Present $(\%)+$ Replaced $(\%)$ .  

# Structural geology  

The methods for documenting structural features encountere d in Expedition 366 cores largely follow those of Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program Expeditions 334 and 344 (see the Structural geology sections in the respective Methods chapters [Expedition 33 4 Scientists, 2012; Harris et al., 2013]. Structures observed on spli t cores were classified and quantified in terms of depth extent an d sense of displacement. Orientation data were only measured o n structures in their original orientation; no orientation data from rotated clasts, fragments, and so on, were documented. Orientatio n data were typed into both an MS Excel spreadsheet and DESClogik.  

# Structural data acquisition and orientation measurements  

Core measurements followed ODP procedures. We used a plastic goniometer for orientation measurements (Figure F9). Using th e working half of the split core provided greater flexibility in removing—and cutting, if necessary—pieces of the core for structura l measurements.  

Figure F9. Protractor used to measure apparent dips, trends, plunges, an d rakes on planar and linear features in a split core, Expedition 366.  

![](images/ae2b5351c3a5c33f46ab52a28d21865c63134be90642b9e48914b2decb58eb76.jpg)  

Orientations of planar and linear features in cores were determined relative to the core axis, which represents the vertical axis i n the core reference frame, and the “double line” marked on the working half of the split core liner, which represents $0^{\circ}$ (and $360^{\circ}$ ) in th e plane perpendicular to the core axis (Figure F10). To determine th e orientation of a planar structural element, two apparent dips of thi s fabric were measured in the core reference frame. These were the n converted using an MS Excel spreadsheet to a plane represented b y dip angle and either a strike or dip direction (Figure F11). One apparent dip was usually represented by the intersection of the plana r feature with the split face of the core and was quantified by measuring the dip direction and angle in the core reference frame $(\upbeta_{1})$ (Figure F12). Typical apparent dip measurements had a trend of $90^{\circ}$ o r $270^{\circ}$ and ranged in plunge from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}\;(\upbeta_{2})$ . The second apparen t dip was usually represented by the intersection of the planar featur e and a cut or fractured surface at a high angle to the split face of th e core. In most cases, this was a surface either parallel or perpendicu

fracturing, faulting, and rotation of fragments in XCB and RC B cores. Where structures were disturbed by flow-in on ${>}60\%$ of th e cross section of the core, we excluded measurements because of th e intense disturbance (bending, rotation, etc.) of these structures.  

For planar structures (e.g., bedding, flow boundaries, fracture s as joints, veins, and faults), two apparent dips on two different surfaces (e.g., one on the working half surface of the split core, which i s east–west vertical, and the other on the horizontal or north–sout h vertical surface of the same split core) were measured in the cor e reference frame as azimuths (measured clockwise from north, looking down) and plunges (Figures F10, F11, F12). A coordinate system was defined so that the positive $x-,y-$ -, and $z$ -directions coincid e with north, east, and vertical downward, respectively. If the azimuths and plunges of the two apparent dips are given as $(\alpha_{1},\beta_{1})$ an d $(\alpha_{2},\beta_{2})$ , respectively (Figure F12), then the unit vectors representin g these two lines, $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2}$ , are  

$$
\nu_{1}\,=\,{\binom{l_{1}}{m_{1}}}\,=\,{\binom{\cos\alpha_{1}\cos\beta_{1}}{\sin\alpha_{1}\cos\beta_{1}}}
$$  

and  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{2}\,=\,\left(\!\!\begin{array}{c}{l_{2}}\\ {m_{2}}\\ {n_{2}}\end{array}\!\!\right)\,=\,\left(\!\!\begin{array}{c}{\cos\upalpha_{2}\cos\upbeta_{2}}\\ {\sin\upalpha_{2}\cos\upbeta_{2}}\\ {\sin\upbeta_{2}}\end{array}\!\!\right)\,.}\end{array}
$$  

The unit vector normal to the plane, $\nu_{\mathrm{n}},$ is then defined as  

$$
\boldsymbol{\nu}_{n}\,=\,\left(\!\!{\begin{array}{l}{l_{n}}\\ {m_{n}}\\ {n_{n}}\end{array}}\right)\,=\,\frac{\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}}{\left|\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}\right|}\,,
$$  

where  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}\,=\,\left(\begin{array}{l}{|m_{1}m_{2}|}\\ {\left|n_{1}n_{2}\right|}\\ {\left|n_{1}n_{2}\right|}\\ {\left|l_{1}l_{2}\right|}\\ {\left|l_{1}l_{2}\right|}\\ {\left|m_{1}m_{2}\right|}\end{array}\right)\hphantom{x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x}}\end{array}

lar to the core axis. In the former, the apparent dip lineation trende d to $000^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$ and plunge trended from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ ; in the latter, th e trend ranged from $000^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ and plunge was $0^{\circ}$ .  

# Description and classification of structures  

We constructed a structural geology template for DESClogi k that facilitates the description and classification of observed structures.  

Structural data can sometimes be disturbed by drilling-induce d structures such as flow-in structures in APC cores and biscuiting,  

The azimuth, $\upalpha_{\mathrm{n}},$ and plunge, $\upbeta_{\mathrm{n}},$ of $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ are given by  

$$
\upalpha_{n}\,=\,\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{m_{n}}{l_{n}}\right),\,\upbeta_{n}\,=\,\sin^{-1}\!n_{n}\,.
$$  

The dip direction, $\upalpha_{\mathrm{{d}}},$ and dip angle, $\upbeta_{:}$ , of this plane are ${\upalpha}_{\mathrm{n}}$ an d $90^{\circ}+\beta_{\mathrm{n}},$ respectively, when $\beta_{\mathrm{n}}<0^{\circ}$ (Figure F13). They are $\alpha_{\mathrm{n}}\pm180^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}-\beta_{\mathrm{n}},$ respectively, when $\beta_{\mathrm{n}}\geq0^{\circ}$ . The right-hand rule strike o f this plane, $\upalpha_{\mathrm{{s}}},$ is then given by $\upalpha_{\mathrm{d}}-90^{\circ}$ .  

# DESClogik structural database  

DESClogik is an interface application used to store data used to produce a visual (macroscopic and/or microscopic) description of core structures at a given depth in LIMS. During this expedition, only the locations of structural features, calculated orientations in the core reference frame, and restored orientations based on the paleomagnetic data were input into DESClogik. Orientation data management and planar fabric analysis were made with a spreadsheet as described above.  

# Rock, mud, and sediment geochemistry  

# Portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer  

Portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF) measurements were conducted on nearly 1000 serpentinite rock and mud samples from all sites during Expedition 366. Most of these analyses were rock surface measurements made to facilitate material identification during core description activities. pXRF measurements were also made on splits of the oxidized sample powders used to prepare solutions for ICP-AES measurements. See Johnston et al. (2018) for detailed information on pXRF and ICP-AES analysis protocols for geological solids.  

# Inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometer  

The current shipboard procedure for digestion of rocks and subsequent ICP-AES analysis is described in Johnston et al. (2018). Here, we outline specific procedures used to prepare the unusual Mg-rich and pore fluid–heavy samples recovered during Expedition 366.  

Serpentinite mud samples were taken from the interiors of cores and were heated in a drying oven at $150^{\circ}C$ for $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ to remove entrained pore waters. All samples were prepared from $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of material for rocks and $10{-}30~\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of interior material for serpentinite muds. Rock samples were cut from clasts in the cores using a diamond-blade rock saw. Outer surfaces of rock samples were ground on a diamond-impregnated grinding wheel to remove saw marks and altered rinds resulting from drilling. Each cleaned rock sample was placed in a beaker containing isopropanol and put in an ultrasonic bath for $15\;\mathrm{min}$ . The isopropanol was decanted, and the samples were then put twice in an ultrasonic bath with nanopure deionized water $(18\ \mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm})$ for $10\ \mathrm{min}$ . The cleaned pieces were then dried for $10{-}12\,\mathrm{h}$ at $110^{\circ}C$ . After drying, rock samples and the more lithified serpentinite mud materials were crushed to $<\!1\ \mathsf{c m}$ between two Delrin plastic disks in a hydraulic press.  

The prepared serpentinite mud samples and the crushed chips of rock were ground to a fine powder using a SPEX ball mill powdering system with an alumina ceramic mill. In rare cases, small samples from critical intervals were crushed in an agate mortar under isopropanol. After powdering, a 2.00 to $5.00\pm\:0.02–0.05\mathrm{\:g}$ aliquot of the sample powder was weighed on a Mettler Toledo balance into pure quartz glass crucibles for oxidation. It was ignited for $^{1\,\mathrm{h}}$ at $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $1025^{\circ}C$ to determine weight loss on ignition (LOI) with an estimated precision of $0.02\mathrm{~g~}(0.4\%)$ . Some samples (metamorphosed mafic igneous rocks and calc-silicate metamorphic rocks [rodingites]) were found to sinter at the $1025^{\circ}C$ maximum furnace temperature, so these materials were reweighed and LOI was determined based on heating to $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ .  

After determination of LOI, each sample and standard was weighed on a Cahn C-31 microbalance to $100.0\,\pm\,0.2\,\mathrm{\mg}$ splits; weighing errors are estimated to be $\pm0.05\,\mathrm{~mg~}$ under relatively smooth sea-surface conditions. Splits of ignited whole-rock powders were mixed with $400.0\pm0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO_{2}}$ flux (preweighed on shore).  

Aqueous LiBr solution ( $10~\mathrm{mL}$ of $0.172~\mathrm{mM}$ ) was added to the flux and rock powder mixture as a nonwetting agent prior to sample fusion to prevent the fused bead from sticking to the crucible during cooling. Samples were fused individually in Pt-Au (95:5) crucibles for ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{min}$ at a maximum temperature of $1050^{\circ}C$ in an internally rotating induction furnace (Bead Sampler NT-2100).  

The fused beads were transferred into $125\,\mathrm{~mL~}$ high-density polypropylene bottles and dissolved in a $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ solution containing $10\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and $10\,\mathrm{ppm\;Y}.$ . The solution bottle was shaken in a Burrell wrist-action shaker until the bead dissolved. Increments of 20 mL of the solution were passed through a $0.45\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ filter into a clean $60\,\mathrm{mL}$ wide-mouth high-density polypropylene bottle. From this filtered solution, between 1.0 and $1.25~\mathrm{mL}$ was pipetted into a sample tube and diluted with $8.75{-}10\ \mathrm{mL}$ of dissolution solution of $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3},$ $10\ \mathrm{ppm\Y,}$ and $1000\ \mathrm{ppm\Li}$ (added as a peak enhancer to improve sensitivity). The proportions of sample to solution were reduced to address ICP-AES calibration issues related to signal saturation for Mg see Johnston et al. (2018) and for Ca in Site U1491 and U1492 samples. The final solution-to-sample dilution factor was 4000:1 in our early runs and 5500:1 in later runs. Within any analytical run, the dilution factor was kept constant for all samples, blanks, and standards. Changing the dilution factor may have impacted the measurement of some of our lowest abundance major elements, K and Ti, although both were above instrument detection limits in only a fraction of our samples in all runs so a clear effect was not evident.  

Major and trace element concentrations of standards and samples were determined using the shipboard Teledyne Leeman Labs Prodigy ICP-AES system. Samples were measured for major elements $\mathrm{(SiO_{2}.}$ , $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ , $\mathrm{MgO_{\mathrm{{.}}}}$ , $C a O$ , MnO, $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ $\mathrm{K_{2}O},$ and $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ ) and selected trace elements that occur in measurable abundances in ultramafic materials (Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Sc, and V). The standards used for ICP-AES calibration were a subset of those used in pXRF calibration, selected to provide the best quantification of the extremely $\mathrm{Mg}$ -rich compositions of our recovered materials (see Table T1 in Johnston et al. (2018). The optical wavelengths used for sample analysis during Expedition 366 are provided in Table T3 in Johnston et al. (2018) and in Table T1. Certified international rock reference materials, calibration and drift solutions, and chemical procedure blanks were included with the unknown samples for each sample run. Limits of quantification for each element, calculated as $10\times$ the reported detection limit, are given in Table T1.

# Fluid geochemistry  

Shipboard geochemical analyses were performed on fluids an d gases from all eight sites cored during Expedition 366. No sample s were collected at Site 1200. Chemical measurements conducte d during Expedition 366 include hydrocarbon, headspace gas, and interstitial water analyses using standard protocols. Additionally, $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ CO, and $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ were measured by gas chromatography and electrochemical sensor methods. Each of the analytes measured during Expedition 366, along with their methods of analysis and limits o f determination, are listed in Table T1.  

# Gas analyses Headspace analysis of hydrocarbon gases for safety monitoring  

One sample per core was routinely collected for headspace hydrocarbon gas analysis as part of the standard shipboard safet y monitoring procedure, as described in Kvenvolden and McDonal d (1986) and Pimmel and Claypool (2001), to ensure that drilled materials did not contain amounts of hydrocarbons above prescribe d safety levels.  

A $3{-}5~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ sample of unconsolidated material was taken from  a freshly exposed end of the core directly after it was brought on deck. The sample was placed in a $20\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass vial and sealed with a Teflon/silicon septum and a crimped aluminum cap. During Expedition 366, headspace samples were typically taken at the top o f Section 5 (below the interstitial water whole-round sample). Eac h sample was placed in an oven at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ . A $5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ aliquot o f the evolved hydrocarbon gases was extracted from the headspac e vial with a standard gas syringe and manually injected into an Agilent/Hewlett Packard 6890 Series II gas chromatograph (GC ) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) set at $250^{\circ}C,$ . Th e column ( $2~\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter [ID]; $6.3~\mathrm{mm}$ outer diameter [OD] ) was packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep (Restek). The GC oven program was set to remain at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ with a subsequent ris e to $150^{\circ}C$ at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ . Analysis required $15\,\mathrm{{min}}$ .  

Results were processed using the Hewlett Packard 3365 ChemStation data software package. The chromatographic response wa s calibrated using nine different gas standards and checked daily. Concentrations of hydrocarbon gases are reported in parts per million by volume (ppmv).  

# Headspace analysis of $\mathsf{H}_{2},\mathsf{\mathbf{C}\mathbf{0}},$ and ${\bf C H_{4}}$  

A separate headspace sample $\mathrm{1\,cm^{3}}$ of unconsolidated material ) was collected from a freshly exposed end of the core after the cor e was brought on deck and sectioned. This sample was placed in a 2 0 $\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ glass vial with $3~\mathrm{mL}$ of distilled water and a small amount o f $\mathrm{HgCl_{2}}$ to prevent microbial activity. The vial was sealed with a Teflon-coated butyl rubber septum and a crimped aluminum cap an d then placed in the oven at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ . A $0.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ aliquot of th e evolved gases was extracted from the headspace vial with a standar d gas syringe and manually injected into a GL Science GC4000 G C equipped with a helium ionization detector (HID) set at $250^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Th e column (2 mm ID; $6.3\;\mathrm{mm}$ OD) was packed with molsieve 5A (Agilent/Hewlett Packard). The GC oven program was set at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ isothermal.  

The chromatographic response was calibrated using two different gas standards and checked daily. The concentration of the analyzed $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ CO, and $\mathrm{CH_{4}}$ was reported as parts per million by volum e (ppmv).  

The GC4000 experienced a power surge during the transit afte r the first site (U1491); thus, this detection method was abandone d for the remainder of the expedition.  

# Electrochemical sensing of $\mathsf{H}_{2}$ and $\mathsf{H}_{2}\mathsf{s}$  

Interstitial water $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentrations were measured using a n electrochemical $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ probe (H2-40N, Unisense, Denmark) on freshl y exposed core after it was brought on deck. The $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ concentration s were calibrated with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ saturated seawater and then measured a t the same temperature as core samples.  

In addition, $1~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of unconsolidated material was collecte d from a freshly exposed end of the core directly after the core wa s brought on deck and sectioned. The sample was placed in a $20\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass vial and slurried in $3~\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\mathrm{~M~HCl}$ solution with a Tefloncoated butyl rubber septum. The slurried sample was measured using an electrochemical $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ probe (H2S-40N, Unisense, Denmark). $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ concentrations were calibrated using seawater containing 1 0 mM $\mathrm{Na}_{2}S$ solution acidified by 1 M HCl seawater at the same temperature as the measurement.  

# Interstitial water analyses  

# Sampling  

A whole-round core sample was taken immediately after cor e sectioning on deck for subsequent extraction of interstitial water. The length of the whole-round core taken for interstitial water analyses varied from $10~\mathrm{cm}$ in the upper part of the core to $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ i n deeper parts where the volume of extracted interstitial water wa s limited. Typically, one whole round per section was collected between 0 and 10 mbsf and two whole rounds were selected every 1 0 m from 10 mbsf to total depth.  

Whole-round samples were processed in a nitrogen-filled glovebag after cooling in a refrigerator for about $1\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . Within the glovebag, the cored material was extruded from the core liner, and the n portions of the material that were potentially contaminated by seawater and smearing were removed by scraping the core’s outer surface with a spatula. For APC cores, about $0.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ of material fro m the outer diameter and the top and bottom faces were removed. I n contrast, XCB cores required additional removal of material; a s much as two-thirds of the recovered material was removed fro m each whole-round sample. The remaining inner core of uncontaminated material $({\sim}150{-}300\,\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ) was placed into a titanium squeeze r (modified after Manheim and Sayles, 1974) and compressed using  a laboratory hydraulic press to extract interstitial water, using a tota l pressure ${<}30\;\mathrm{MPa}$ .  

Fluids extracted from the compressed sample were filtere d through a prewashed Whatman No. 1 filter situated above a titanium mesh screen in the titanium squeezer. Approximately $15-$ $80\;\mathrm{mL}$ of interstitial water was collected in acid-cleaned plastic syringes attached to the squeezing assembly and filtered through  a Gelman polysulfone disposable filter $(0.45\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ . After extraction, the squeezer parts were cleaned with shipboard water, rinsed wit h deionized water, and dried thoroughly.  

# Shipboard interstitial water analyses  

Interstitial water samples were analyzed on board followin g Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000) and, for newer shipboar d instrumentation, IODP user manuals, with some modification s when necessary (see below). Precision and accuracy were tested using International Association for the Physical Sciences of th e Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater with the following composition: alkalinity $(2.325\;\mathrm{mM})$ ),  Ca $(10.55\;\mathrm{mM})$ , $\mathrm{Mg}$ $(54.0\;\mathrm{mM})$ ,   K $(10.44\,\mathrm{mM})$ ,  Sr $(87\;\mathrm{mM})$ ),  sulfate $(28.9\;\mathrm{mM})$ ),  Cl $^{\left(559\mathrm{\;mM}\right)}$ ), N a $(480\;\mathrm{mM})$ , and Li $(27\;\mathrm{mM})$ (Gieskes et al., 1991).  

The interstitial water extracted from the compressed sampl e was  split  into  aliquots  for  the  following  shipboard  analyses: (1) ${\sim}50~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for salinity measurement with a refractometer, (2) $3\;\mathrm{mL}$ for ${\mathsf{p H}}$ and alkalinity, (3) $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for ion chromatography (IC) analysis of major anions and cations, (4) $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for chloride titration, (5) $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for  ammonium  analysis  by  spectrophotometry, (6) $300~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for phosphate analysis by spectrophotometry, (7) $600~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for ICP-AES analysis, (8) ${\sim}4.5~\mathrm{mL}$ for sulfide spectrophotometr y analysis, and (9) $4{-}6~\mathrm{mL}$ for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)/dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis by total organic carbo n (TOC) analyzer.  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately after interstitial water extraction, following Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinit y was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handhel d refractometer (Fisher model S66366). A transfer pipette was used t o transfer two drops of interstitial water to the salinity refractometer, and the corresponding salinity value was manually registered in th e corresponding log book. Error is estimated at $\pm0.25$ .  

$\mathsf{p H}$ was measured with a combination glass electrode, and alkalinity  was  determined  by  Gran titration  with an  autotitrato r (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) using 0.1 M HCl at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Certifie d Reference Material 104 was used for calibration of the acid. Standard IAPSO seawater was used for calibration and analyzed at th e beginning and end of the sample set for each site and after every 1 0 samples. Repeated measurements of IAPSO seawater for alkalinit y yielded a precision better than $0.8\%$ . Precision for $\mathsf{p H}$ was bette r than $0.01\,\mathrm{pH}$ units.  

# Chlorinity  

Chlorinity in interstitial water samples were measured by titration using a Metrohm 785 DMP autotitrator and silver nitrat e $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ solution calibrated against repeated titrations of IAPS O seawater. Where fluid recovery was sufficient, a $0.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of sampl e was diluted with $30\;\mathrm{mL}$ of nitric acid $\left(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\right)$ solution $(92\pm2\mathrm{\mM})$ and titrated with $0.1015\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ . In all other cases, a $0.1\;\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot was diluted with $10\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $90\pm2\mathrm{\mM\,HNO_{3}}$ and titrated wit h $0.1778\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ . Samples of IAPSO seawater were analyzed interspersed with interstitial water samples, yielding a precision bette r than $0.5\%$ . Chloride concentrations were reported based on the liberation of any potential sulfide in solution during the titration wit h dilute acid and the minor amounts of bromide in these samples.  

Chloride, sulfate, bromide, sodium, magnesium, potassium, and calcium  

Major ions in interstitial water samples were analyzed on  a Metrohm 850 Professional II IC equipped with a Metrohm 858 Professional sample processor, an MSM $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ suppressor, and a thermal conductivity detector. For anion $\left(C\right)^{-}$ , $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ , and $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{r}^{-},$ ) analyses,  a Metrosep C6 column ( $100\,\mathrm{\mm}$ long, 4 mm ID) was used, wit h $3.2\;\mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $1.0\;\mathrm{mM}\ \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ solutions used as the eluents. For cation $\left(\mathbf{Na}^{+}$ , $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ ) analyses, a Metrosep  A supp 7 column ( $150~\mathrm{mm}$ long, 4 mm ID) was used, with $1.7~\mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and $1.7\ \mathrm{mM}$ PDCA (pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, $C\mathrm{A}S\#$ 499-83-2) solutions used as the eluents.  

The calibration curve was established by diluting IAPSO seawater by $100\times$ , $150\times$ , $200\times_{:}$ , $350\times$ , and $500\times$ . For interstitial wate r samples with high Ca concentrations, which were encountered a t some sites, a spiked IAPSO solution was prepared with $6\times$ seawate r Ca concentration and then diluted as noted above to generate a calibration curve. Analysis of samples began by taking an aliquot o f $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of sample and diluting it 1:100 with deionized water usin g specifically designated pipettes. For every 10 samples, an IAPS O standard was analyzed as an unknown to ensure accuracy. Repeate d measurement of anion and cation concentrations in IAPSO seawater yielded a precision better than $1\%$ for all the ions listed abov e and an accuracy better than $2.5\%$ for all elements except Ca $(8\%)$ .  

# Ammonium, phosphate, silica, and hydrogen sulfide  

Concentrations of ammonium, phosphate, silica, and hydroge n sulfide in interstitial water were determined using an Agilent Technologies Cary Series 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer equipped wit h a sipper sample introduction system, following Gieskes et al. (1991). The determination of ammonium in $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of interstitial water utilized a method that incorporates diazotization of phenol and subsequent oxidation of the diazo compound by Chlorox to yield a blu e color, measured spectrophotometrically at $640\;\mathrm{nm}$ . Following initia l measurements, which indicated typical ammonium concentration s were low, the method was modified by using $1100\;\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of sample instead of diluting $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of sample with $1000\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of deionized water. Determination of phosphate concentrations was based on th e reaction of orthophosphate with $\mathrm{Mo}(\mathrm{VI})$ and Sb(III) in an acidi c solution that forms an antimony-phosphomolybdate complex tha t is subsequently reduced by ascorbic acid to form a blue color. Th e absorbance  was  measured  spectrophotometrically  at $885~\mathrm{~nm}$ (Gieskes et al., 1991). For phosphate analysis, $300~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of interstitia l water was diluted prior to color development so that the highes t concentration was ${<}1000\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . This method was modified to us e $2000~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of sample with no dilution step because concentrations o f phosphate in Expedition 366 samples are low and generally ${<}10\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . Silica concentrations were determined by ICP-AES; however, when concentrations were below the detection limit, $200~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of interstitial water was used for the spectrophotometry method base d on a reaction with ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate solution t o form a yellow silicomolybdate complex (Gieskes et al., 1991). Thi s complex was then reduced with ascorbic acid, which was prepare d immediately before analysis from a mix of metol sulfite, oxalic acid, and sulfuric acid solutions. The formed complex is molybdenu m blue, which was measured at $812~\mathrm{nm}$ after $4\;\mathrm{{h}}$ . This blue comple x was very stable, enabling delayed reading of the samples.  

Concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (expected to be $\mathrm{H}S^{-}$ or $S^{-2}$ a t the $\mathsf{p H}$ of most interstitial water samples collected during Expedition 366) were analyzed following Cline (1969) with modification s that adapt the technique for small volumes of interstitial fluids (T. Ferdelman et al., unpubl. data). Initially, a $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ sample was fixe d with $40~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a $1\%$ zinc acetate solution. This combination of sample volume/reagents was designed for a range of 6 to $80\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ sulfide. However, because most samples were below detection using thi s mixture, $\mathsf{a4\,m L}$ sample was fixed with $800\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ zinc acetate solution, and analyses were conducted following the lowest range $(1{-}3~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ outlined in Cline (1969), which had a linear range up to $10\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . Th e zinc acetate–fixed sample was vigorously shaken, and $320~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of  a diamine solution consisting of $0.5\mathrm{~g~N},\mathrm{N}.$ -dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate and $0.75\mathrm{~g~}$ ferric chloride $\left(\mathrm{FeCl_{3}{\cdot}6H_{2}O}\right)$ per $500~\mathrm{mL}$ deionized water was added. The solution was shaken and left for 3 0 min in the dark and then measured by spectrophotometry at 67 0 nm. If the blue color of the sample was visually darker than that o f the highest standard $(10~\upmu\mathrm{M})$ , the sample was diluted with deionized water until a lighter color was achieved.  

# Dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved organic carbon  

DIC and DOC concentrations were measured with the OI Analytical Aurora 1030C TOC analyzer, consisting of a syringe module, a sample-stripping manifold, and an infrared $C O_{2}$ analyzer. Por e water samples (1 mL for each injection) were acidified with $0.2~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2~\mathrm{M}$ HCl. The $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ released during this acid addition step wa s stripped and injected into the $C O_{2}$ analyzer. Subsequently, any remaining carbon in the sample was combusted, and the DOC wa s obtained by difference. The $C O_{2}$ Beer-Lambert absorption law wa s integrated to determine the total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ released from the sample.  

# Major and minor elements  

Major and minor elements were analyzed by ICP-AES with  a Teledyne Prodigy high-dispersion ICP spectrometer (Table T1) . The general method for shipboard ICP-AES analysis of samples i s described in ODP Technical Note 29 (Murray et al., 2000) and th e user manuals for new shipboard instrumentation, with modifications as indicated (see table T7 in the user manual). Samples an d standards were diluted 1:20 using $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ spiked with $10\;\mathrm{ppm\;Y}$ for trace element analyses (Li, B, Mn, Fe, Sr, Ba, and Si) and 1:100 fo r major constituent analyses (Na, K, Mg, and Ca). Each batch of samples analyzed on the ICP spectrometer contained blanks and solutions of known concentrations. Each item aspirated into the IC P spectrometer was counted four times from the same dilute solutio n within a given sample run. Following each instrument run, measured raw intensity values were transferred to a data file and corrected for instrument drift and blank. If necessary, a drift correctio n was applied to each element by linear interpolation between th e drift-monitoring solutions.  

Standardization of major cations was achieved by successive dilution of IAPSO standard seawater to $100\%$ , $75\%$ , $50\%$ , $25\%$ , $10\%$ , $5\%$ , and $2.5\%$ relative to the 1:100 primary dilution ratio of the sample. For a subset of interstitial water samples with elevated Ca an d Sr concentrations (encountered primarily at Site U1492), a spike d IAPSO solution was prepared with the equivalent of $6\times$ seawater $\mathrm{Ca}$ and $_{8\times}$ seawater Sr concentrations, and this solution was diluted a s noted above to create a calibration curve. Replicate analyses of $100\%$ IAPSO seawater, analyzed as an unknown throughout each batch o f analyses, yielded estimates for precision and accuracy.  

For minor element concentration analyses, the interstitial wate r sample aliquot was diluted by a factor of 20 ( $\mathrm{0.5\,mL}$ sample added t o $9.5~\mathrm{mL}$ of a $10\;\mathrm{ppm\;Y}$ solution). Because of the high concentratio n of matrix salts in these samples, matrix matching of the calibratio n standards was necessary to achieve accurate results. A matrix solution that approximated IAPSO standard seawater major ion concentrations was prepared according to Murray et al. (2000). A stoc k standard solution was prepared from ultrapure primary standard s (SPC Science PlasmaCAL) in $2\%$ nitric acid solution. The stoc k solution was then diluted in the same $2\%$ ultrapure nitric acid solution to concentrations of $100\%$ , $75\%$ , $50\%$ , $25\%$ , $10\%$ , $5\%$ , and $1\%$ . Calibration standards were then diluted using the same method a s the samples. All calibration standards were analyzed in triplicat e with a reproducibility of $\mathrm{Li}=0.83\%_{\mathrm{.}}$ , $B=1.3\%$ , $\mathrm{Si}=0.91\%$ , and $\textstyle\operatorname{Sr}=$ $0.83\%$ . IAPSO standard seawater was analyzed as an unknow n during the same analytical session to assess accuracy. Relative deviations are as follows: $\mathrm{Li}=1.8\%$ , $\mathrm{B}=4.0\%,$ $\mathrm{Si}=4.1\%_{1}$ , and $\mathrm{Sr}=-1.8\%$ . Because values of Ba, Mn, and Fe in IAPSO seawater are close to o r below the detection limit with this method, the accuracy of the ICPAES determinations cannot be quantified, and reported value s should be regarded as preliminary.  

# Comparative analysis of analytical methodologies for interstitial waters  

IODP standard shipboard analytical protocols produce multipl e data sets for a number of elements (e.g., K, Mg, Ca, Na, and Cl). These data were compared to identify the most effective analytical approach for each species. A series of comparison plots (Figur e F14) shows data from the two methods for K, Ca, Mg, Sr, and Cl.  

![](images/7c3d1babf60533e1a7e248f51e273095799bc2b242857ed3824992e6b3a20fa9.jpg)  
Figure F14. Comparison of ion chromatography and ICP-AES and titration methods used to analyze interstitial water samples, Expedition 366. A. Mg. B. K. C. C a (317.9 nm spectral line). D. Na. E. Cl.  

Each of these elements was analyzed via IC. In addition, K, Ca, $\mathrm{Mg}$ and Na were analyzed by ICP-AES. Cl was also measured as chlorinity via titration (see above).  

Concentrations of K and $\mathrm{Mg}$ have overall good correlations between ICP-AES and IC data, showing a nearly 1:1 correlation wit h slopes near 1.0 and high correlation coefficients $/R^{2}\,{>}\,0.997$ for eac h element). The intercepts for both data sets are within the uncertainties of the determinations (e.g., $\approx\pm5\%$ for the total procedure fo r both ICP-AES and IC). At the lowest concentrations for both elements, a slight shift toward higher values is observed in the IC data, which may indicate that the ICP-AES results are more accurate a t lower abundance levels, but overall, data from both instruments ar e comparable in terms of precision and accuracy.  

Ca measurements were conducted using three spectral lines o n the ICP-AES. Of these, the $317.9\;\mathrm{nm}$ spectral line provides the bes t results $(\ge\!0.998\$ calibration curves), and the correlation between C a data collected on this spectral line and the IC results for Ca is good, with an $R^{2}$ value of ${\sim}0.994$ and a small Y intercept. However, th e other two Ca spectral lines, 393.366 and $396.847\ \mathrm{nm}$ , show poo r correlations, with the lower concentration standards showing a linear correlation and the highest concentration standards showin g nonlinear behavior with no clear variation in intensity with increasing concentration (Figure F15). The general pattern of using thes e Ca spectral lines is also evident in the ICP-AES results using N a lines of 589.592 and $588.995\ \mathrm{nm}$ . As a result, the correlation between ICP-AES Na and IC Na is poor, with a low $R^{2}$ value and a nonzero intercept (Figure F14).  

The pattern of the calibration curves for the two Ca and Na line s in Figure F15 is consistent with signal saturation in the ICP-AES detector array. For most cations, ICP-AES provides a linear dynami c range of 5–6 orders of magnitude, but for many of the alkaline elements, this range can be curtailed substantially due to matrix enhancement or self-enhancement effects (e.g., intensity increases du e to the sum of light-producing species in the ICP analysis solution s and/or greater than normal intensity related to increasing concentration of the analyte; Potts, 1992). The spectral lines for the alkalin e elements, particularly the alkali metals, are particularly sensitive t o matrix effects. Li, Na, and K ICP spectral lines are all susceptible t o matrix enhancement, as are many of the spectral lines for the alkaline earths.  

![](images/c9d5f0e430d353523a5a1d54cb0d6b66715505b47f3354db9bb015ddee55ad2b.jpg)  
Figure F15. Na and Ca intensities from the ICP-AES showing nonlinear correlations related to detector saturation at higher abundance levels $_{\left(0.5\times\right.}$ to $1.0\times$ seawater abundances, diluted 100:1). Intensity increases linearly.  

Using a dilution of 1:100, the concentration of Na in the ICPAES solutions exceeds $100~\mathrm{ppm}$ for seawater, which is beyond th e linear dynamic range of the instrument for Na, taking matrix effect s into account. Based on the curves in Figure F15, solutions containing as little as 50 ppm Na could show signal saturation effects, which would argue for a more substantial dilution for major cation s (possibly 300:1 or 400:1). This level of dilution can create analytica l challenges for $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K, which are considerably lower in abundance than Na in both seawater and interstitial waters.  

The correlation between IC Cl determinations and chlorinit y determined via the titration method outlined in Gieskes et al. (1991 ) (Figure F14) is poor, with a low $R^{2}$ value and a positive Y intercept, raising the possibility of a systematic bias between these two methods. Re-analysis of several Site U1492 interstitial water sample s confirmed the reproducibility of the two methods. Replication o f the IAPSO seawater standard by the titration method is within $\pm1\%$ of the accepted value, and a sample replication for Cl via IC is withi n $1\%{-}2\%$ of accepted values for standards at two different concentration levels. Therefore, both methods appear to be accurate.  

Gieskes et al. (1991) noted the necessity of correcting titratio n Cl values for the presence of Br and like anions that might be present in solution and might also react with $\mathrm{AgNO_{3}}$ . As such, the presence of $S^{2-}$ or other anions could complicate titration readings fo r $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ . It appears that a number of horizons within the Site U149 2 summit cores, from which the data for this analysis was taken, hav e significant sulfide mineralization. Testing for sulfide generally requires using a fixing agent to prevent $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ volatility losses, and because Site U1492 interstitial waters were not initially collected wit h shipboard sulfide determinations in mind, the samples were no t fixed. As a result, primary sulfide could not be measured. The potential for dissolved sulfide adds a potential source of uncertainty t o our titration-based chlorinity determinations that is not a concer n with Cl on the IC. However, given that nitric acid was added befor e the chlorinity titration, the decrease in sample pH should have mobilized volatile hydrogen sulfide, eliminating the need to correct th e chlorinity for these ions.  

For Expedition 366, rather than reanalyzing recovered sample s or institute fundamentally different analytical protocols, we hav e chosen to do the following to address the issues our comparativ e analysis has uncovered:  

• We did not use interstitial water Na data collected by ICP-AES, given the concerns with signal saturation, and instead used Na results determined by IC.   
• Given that Ca interstitial water results with the $317.9\,\mathrm{nm}$ spectral line appear to be as reliable as the IC results, we used these data in our interpretations because the reported precision of ICP-AES data (at less than $\pm5\%$ ) are better than typical precision of Ca by IC. Ca results using the other ICP-AES spectral lines were neglected because signal saturation is a concern for these wavelengths.   
• We used interstitial water Cl results collected using IC in our interpretations, primarily because of the potential for uncertainty in the titration-based chlorinity measurements even though this method has a much better precision.  

# Microbiology  

During Expedition 366, samples for microbiological analysi s were collected from serpentinite muds and pelagic sediments. Th e collective overarching objectives for microbiological study will focus on determining the biomass, activity, and community structur e of these subsurface microbial and viral communities, as well as assessing microbial ecology, diversity, and metabolic potential usin g an array of molecular microbiological applications. Relatively fe w shipboard analyses were performed because most measurement s needed to be made in shore-based laboratories. Accordingly, th e majority of our effort was dedicated to collecting and preserving a n adequate number of samples for subsequent shore-based molecula r biological studies.  

Shore-based analyses will use a number of techniques to achiev e the overall objectives. DNA analyses of small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing will be conducted to address community structure. Metagenomics analysis will be conducted t o reconstruct the metabolic potential and identify entire genome s from microbial populations in the samples. RNA determination using metatranscriptomics will help to establish potential communit y activity (i.e., the genes that are most highly expressed in a given microbial environment). Both functional gene quantification throug h quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and single-cell genomics will provide detailed information about the potential metabolic characteristics of microbes, link those potentials to cellula r identity, and provide clues related to the best environment to cultivate cells from recovered samples. Enrichment for specific group s of organisms will identify the unique physiological properties of th e organisms. A considerable amount of time during the expeditio n was dedicated to collecting samples for quality assurance and quality control to constrain the microbiological quality of the samples.  

Ship- and shore-based microbiologists plan to correlate thes e molecular microbiological and cultivation results with variations i n interstitial water geochemistry to interpret the metabolic potentia l of the microbial communities. Our goal for these comparisons wil l be to test specific hypotheses in the context that such microbial tax a are the residual survivors exposed to ultradeep subsurface serpentinization processes and mud volcanism mass transport encountered in the Mariana subduction system.  

# Microbial core handling and sampling  

Microbiological sampling depends on careful sample handlin g techniques and the use of tracers to assess potential contamination. Microorganisms collected from beneath the seafloor are expecte d to be sensitive to chemical and physical changes that they encounte r when brought to the surface. Changes in oxygen concentration an d temperature are two important factors to be considered whe n bringing cells from cold, anoxic settings to the surface. Accordingly, the following procedures were followed to minimize harm to subsurface microbes without compromising other expedition objectives.  

# Contamination testing  

Considerable potential exists for contamination and cross-contamination by microbes through the drilling process. Accordingly, i t has become common practice to add tracers to the drilling fluids s o that the extent of contamination from the drilling fluids and cor e recovery methods can be effectively evaluated. To check for potential intrusion of drilling fluids from the outside to the center of core s and to confirm the suitability of cored material for microbiologica l research, perfluorocarbon tracers (PFTs) were used while corin g with the APC system, and periodic sampling of the drilling fluids, seawater (used to mix the drilling fluids), and outer surfaces of th e whole rounds was conducted to obtain community data based o n extracted DNA. Comparison of microbial community profiles derived from likely sources of contamination with profiles from th e core interior should yield notable differences; otherwise, there i s reason to believe that the interior of the sample was compromised.  

# Perfluorocarbon tracer  

As a group, PFTs are nontoxic, inert, insoluble in water, and easily detected in a GC with an electron capture detector (ECD). Eithe r perfluoromethylcyclohexane (PMCH) or perfluoromethyldecali n (PFMD) were used, depending upon availability for all drilling operations when microbial samples were collected. PFMD is produce d in Russia and was difficult to secure in sufficient quantities prior t o the expedition; it was therefore used in selected holes, and PMC H was used in the remainder of the holes. PFTs were introduced int o the drilling fluids with a high-pressure liquid chromatograph y pump at a constant concentration of $1~\mathrm{mg/L}$ . PFTs serve as an imperfect tracer for potential contamination of core material by nonindigenous microbes in the drilling fluids because it is much smalle r than microbes; however, it is an efficacious guide for qualitative estimates of contamination.  

Previous expeditions have used PMCH or, more recently, PFM D injected into drilling fluid to try to quantify intrusion of drillin g fluid into the interior of samples (Smith et al., 2000; Lever et al., 2006; Inagaki et al., 2015; Dick et al., 2016). Based on prior report s from Expeditions 329 and 360 (Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011; Dick et al., 2017) and difficulties associated with release of PFT s from core material, we did not attempt to develop the PFT as  a quantitative tracer. Instead, PFT samples were prepared accordin g to previously established methods (Smith et al., 2000; Lever et al., 2006; Inagaki et al., 2015), slightly modified by taking $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of cor e liner fluid or $2~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ mud samples on the catwalk immediately afte r core recovery. Samples were collected at the top of the core, wher e contamination is expected to be highest, and in the interior, halfway, and exterior of all microbiology whole-round samples. All samples were quickly placed into GC vials containing $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of milli Q water, closed with screw caps, and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ for later analysis. Analyses were done on board using an Agilient 6890N GC wit h ECD.  

# Fluid community tracers  

To further evaluate the extent to which contaminating cells ma y have penetrated a sample, a postexpedition comparison will b e made of the microbial community diversity between the serpentinite mud and pelagic sediment samples and the respectiv e drilling fluid collected at the time of coring. This technique was firs t performed with deep continental samples (Lehman et al., 1995) bu t is common for studies of subseafloor samples, in which contamination is ubiquitous and genomic signatures of the contaminating material are subtracted from those of the subseafloor samples (Inagak i et al., 2015). The comparison can be accomplished by obtaining an d preserving an adequate number of samples from the differen t sources of contamination (seawater or drilling fluid) and from th e interior of the cores and then carrying out high-throughput sequencing of the SSU rRNA genes in the respective samples. Subsequent evaluation of the community signatures can help identif y samples that significantly overlap in community structure with th e drilling fluids (deeming them contaminated) or samples that hav e unique community structure when compared to the fluids (deemin g them unlikely to be contaminated). For fluid community tracers, microorganisms were collected on $0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ pore filters by filtering  1 L of seawater or drilling fluid collected from the drilling flui d pumped down the drill string. The filters were frozen $(-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ an d will be analyzed postexpedition to compare the microbial community structures in the drilling fluids with those in the core samples.  

# Microbiological whole-round sampling  

Whole-round cores were collected immediately after the cor e reached the catwalk. Two $20~\mathrm{{cm}}$ long whole rounds were broke n away from the rest of the core to minimize the potential for crosscontamination by breaking or cutting with an ethanol-rinsed spatula when necessary. The cores were handled only with nitrile glove s and capped on both ends with ethanol-rinsed plastic caps. Th e whole-round samples were labeled and transferred to the Microbiology laboratory, where they were stored in the cold room $(4^{\circ}C)$ t o minimize alteration of the microbial communities. Samples wer e partitioned under aseptic conditions.  

As soon as possible, the $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ long whole-round samples wer e sampled into sterile $3\;\mathrm{mL}$ syringes, of which $2\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were transferre d into fixative buffer (see below) for onshore determination of microbial cell numbers. Further sampling was done with sterile $30~\mathrm{mL}$ cut-tip syringes, and then samples were (1) transferred into steril e Whirl-Pak bags or $50\,\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes or (2) sampled into steril e $5\,\mathrm{mL}$ cut-tip syringes and then transferred into sterile $15\;\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes. Samples were then either stored in an ultralow-temperature freezer $(-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ for molecular analyses, in a freezer $(-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ fo r later D:L amino acid determination, or in a refrigerator $(4^{\circ}C)$ fo r cultivation-based analyses and cell counts. The outer portions an d bigger clasts of the cores that remained after microbiological sampling were returned to the Core laboratory.  

# Preservation of samples for total cell counts  

Cells were fixed with a solution $\mathrm{100\;mM}$ CAPS $\mathrm{[pH=10.5]}$ , $2\%$ formaldehyde, and $3\%$ NaCl) and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ until further processing. Quantitative cell counting will be carried out on shore.  

# Preservation of samples for single cell genomics  

Three $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were placed into sterile $5~\mathrm{mL}$ tip-cut syringes and then transferred into sterile $15~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes an d stored in the $4^{\circ}C$ cold room. To each of these samples, we added 1 0 mL of sterile buffer (phosphate-buffered saline). Samples and buffe r were vortexed for $_{30\;s}$ and then centrifuged for $_{30\ s}$ at $2000\times{\mathrm{g}}$ t o remove large particles. Inside a cryovial, $1~\mathrm{mL}$ of the supernatan t was added to 1/10 volume of filtered glyTE buffer, placed in liqui d nitrogen, and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for future analysis.  

# Preservation of samples for metagenomics and metatranscriptomics  

Four to eight $25~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ subsamples were placed into extra heav y duty $50~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes using sterile $30~\mathrm{mL}$ tip-cut syringes a s described above. These were either fast frozen in the $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freeze r for metagenomic analysis or samples had an equal volume o f RNALater reagent added to them. This sample-solution mixtur e was made into a slurry and stored overnight in the $4^{\circ}C$ cold room. After ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , the sample-solution mixture was fast frozen in th e $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer for either metagenomic or transcriptomic analysis o n shore. Larger volumes from whole-round samples were also collected from depths ${>}50$ mbsf and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in an effort to address deep subsurface metagenomics.  

# Preservation of samples for FACS culturing  

Two $5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were placed into sterile $5\,\mathrm{mL}$ tip-cut syringe s and then transferred into sterile $50~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes and store d in the $4^{\circ}C$ cold room. These will be transported unfrozen on ice an d processed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for highthroughput culturing once on shore.  

# Cultivation of potentially piezophilic microbes  

Incubations at high pressure started with $50~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of mud fro m three depths (approximately 5, 100, and $250\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ ). From this subsample, $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of unconsolidated material was sealed anaerobically i n aluminum bags and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for Illumina amplicon sequencing of the time zero communities. The remaining $40\,\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ was turne d into a slurry in an anaerobic glove box (flushed with nitrogen) b y adding equal volumes of alkaline basal salts medium + $\mathrm{NH_{4}C l}$ $\mathrm{(ABS_{N})}$ ) and vortexing the mixture. A portion of the mixture wa s placed into two cryovials, mixed with glyTE buffer, and placed i n the $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer for future culturing. The remaining slurry wa s used for incubations under high pressure. High-pressure experiments used $4\,\mathrm{mL}$ of slurry placed in a $5~\mathrm{mL}$ glass serum vial an d amended with one of the following:  

1. No amendment, $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of slurry supernatant;   
2. 1 mL of $5\times$ Caminibacter medium for thermophilic bacteria;   
3. 1 mL of $5\times$ Alkaline MJYTGL medium for bacteria living at a pH   
of 10.5;   
4. 1 mL of $3\,\mathrm{mM}$ sodium formate; or   
5. 1 mL of $3\,\mathrm{mM}$ sodium acetate.  

These serum vials were then crimp-sealed, and all air bubble s were removed; each of these amendments was duplicated. One se t of these amendments (five vials in total) was stored at atmospheri c pressure in the $4^{\circ}C$ cold room, and the other set of amendments wa s placed in a pressure vessel and pressurized using a hand pump created by the Bartlett laboratory. Samples from 5 and 100 mbsf wer e incubated at 20 or $40\;\mathrm{MPa}$ . Samples from 250 mbsf were incubate d at $90\ \mathrm{MPa}$ . Pressure vessels were stored in the $4^{\circ}C$ cold room fo r incubation.  

Mud samples $(50~\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ were also taken approximately every 1 0 m at each drilling site. From these samples, $10~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ of mud wa s sealed anaerobically in aluminum bags and stored at $-80^{\circ}C,$ . A slurr y was made, as described above, using $2~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of mud and was place d into two cryovials, mixed with glyTE buffer, and placed in the $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer for future culturing. The remaining mud sample was anaerobically sealed in an aluminum bag and stored in the $4^{\circ}C$ cold room.  

# Preservation of samples for virus assessment and quantification  

Samples $(10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ for virus counting were collected as describe d above using sterilized cut syringes and then stored in the $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ freezer. The $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ long whole rounds were anaerobically stored a t $4^{\circ}C$ for viral production analysis. Considering the small amount o f genetic materials in viral particles, $15~\mathrm{cm}$ long whole rounds wer e collected and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for further viral diversity study base d on polymerase chain reaction amplification.  

# Physical properties  

High-resolution physical property measurements were mad e during Expedition 366 to characterize recovered material and lithostratigraphy and tie core descriptions to borehole data and seismi c profiles. In particular, physical property data play a major role in detection of discontinuities and inhomogeneities, revealing information about changes in the composition and texture of muds an d rocks that can indicate different mud volcano flows or distinguis h between pelagic sediments and mud matrix. A variety of technique s and methods were used to characterize Expedition 366 wholeround cores, split section half cores, and discrete samples. Core sections are generally $1.5\,\mathrm{m}$ in length, so a typical coring length (stroke ) of $9.5\,\textrm{m}$ yields six sections plus a shorter seventh section, and  a HLAPC core of $4.7\,\mathrm{m}$ yields three plus a short fourth section if ther e is full recovery. During this expedition, some core sections wer e shorter because of whole-round sampling for microbiology, interstitial water geochemistry, and personal samples.  

Unlithified cores (pelagic sediments and serpentinite muds ) were measured in the following sequence:  

1. Cores were thermally equilibrated to ambient room temperature $(\sim\!3\!-\!4\,\mathrm{h})$ .   
2. Whole-round cores were run on the WRMSL. The WRMSL includes a gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk densitometer, a magnetic susceptibility logger (MSL), and a $P_{\|}$ -wave logger (PWL). The sampling interval was set to $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
3. Whole-round cores were run on the NGRL.   
4. Thermal conductivity was measured on two sections of each core.   
5. Cores were split.   
6. Color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility were measured on archive section halves using the SHMSL.   
7. Undrained shear strength and $P$ -wave velocity measurements were performed on the working halves. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity analyses were conducted with the transducers oriented in the $x-$ and $z$ - axis directions.   
8. Discrete samples of soft and more consolidated materials for MAD analyses were collected typically at $50\,\mathrm{cm}$ in every section. MAD measurements were performed on wet samples and after samples were dried in an oven for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . Bulk density, dry density, grain density, and porosity were calculated from the measurements. Large hard rock serpentinite clasts were collected when possible.   
9. $P$ -wave velocity and MAD measurements were performed on discrete cube samples of the rock material $({\sim}2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2$ cm). $P$ -wave velocity was measured for wet cube samples in three orthogonal directions. (Some samples were first analyzed for paleomagnetism study; see Paleomagnetism).  

Throughout Expedition 366, all raw data were uploaded to th e LIMS database. A comprehensive discussion of methodologies an d calculations used in the JOIDES Resolution Physical Properties Laboratory is presented in Blum (1997).  

# Whole-round measurements  

GRA-derived bulk density, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, and magnetic susceptibility were measured nondestructively with the WRMSL. T o optimize the measurement process, sampling intervals and measurement integration times were the same for all sensors. Samplin g intervals are common denominators of the distances between th e sensors installed on the WRMSL $(30{-}50\,\mathrm{cm})$ ), which allows sequential and simultaneous measurements. After every core, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) were monitored by passing  a calibration core liner filled with deionized water through th e WRMSL. The nominal accuracy of the calibrated instruments wa s between $1\%$ and $2\%$ .  

# Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

Bulk density can be used to estimate the pore volume in unlithified material and evaluate the consolidation state of the material. GRA density is an estimate of bulk density based on the attenuatio n of a gamma ray beam. The beam is produced by a $^{137}\!C s$ gamma ra y source at a radiation level of $370\,\mathrm{MBq}$ within a lead shield with a  5 mm collimator, which is vertically directed through the wholeround core. The gamma ray receiver consists of a $75~\mathrm{mm^{3}}$ sodiu m iodine (NaI) detector located on the top side of the core, opposite t o the source, that records the gamma radiation that passes throug h the core. The input gamma ray peak has a principal energy of 0.66 2 MeV and is attenuated as it passes through the core. The gamma ra y attenuation occurs primarily by Compton scattering, in which th e gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. The degre e of scattering is related to the material bulk density. Therefore, for  a known thickness of sample, density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of the attenuated gamma rays:  

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I/I_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

# where  

$I=$ the measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

The $\upmu$ and $I_{0}$ are treated as constants so $\uprho$ can be calculated fro m $I$ (Harms and Choquette, 1965).  

In general, WRMSL measurements are most accurate whe n taken on a completely filled core liner with minimal drilling disturbance; otherwise, measurements tend to underestimate true values. By default, the instrument reports measurements using the internal diameter of the core liner $.66\;\mathrm{mm}^{\mathrm{`}}$ ) as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for most cores of unconsolidated material obtained by the APC system. The spatial resolution of the GR A densitometer is less than $1~\mathrm{cm}$ . The gamma ray detector is calibrated with a sealed calibration core (one standard core liner fille d with distilled water and a telescoped aluminum bar machined int o discrete diameter steps of various diameters, located at the top o f the core). To establish the calibration curves, gamma ray count s were taken through each of the discrete diameter steps for $60\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ . Recalibration was performed whenever the deionized water QA/Q C standard deviated significantly (more than $0.021\,\mathrm{~g/cm^{3}})$ ) from  1 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magneti c field:  

$$
\mathrm{\boldmath~\cal~X~}\!=\!M/H,
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field of strength $H$ .  

Magnetic susceptibility varies in response to the type and concentration of magnetic grains, such as the ferrimagnetic mineral s (e.g., magnetite and maghemite), making it useful for identifyin g compositional variations. Magnetic susceptibility responds to variations in the magnetic composition of cored materials that are commonly related to variations in mineralogical composition (e.g., terrigenous versus biogenic materials) and diagenetic overprinting. Materials such as clay generally have a magnetic susceptibility several orders of magnitude lower than magnetite or some other iro n oxides that are common constituents of igneous material. Wate r and plastics (such as the core liner) have a slightly negative magneti c susceptibility.  

Measurements were made using a Bartington MS2C loop senso r with a $9.0~\mathrm{cm}$ diameter (Bartington Instruments, 2011). The loo p sensor has a spatial resolution of $23{-}27\,\mathrm{~mm}$ and is accurate t o within $2\%$ . An oscillator circuit in the sensor, which operates at  a frequency of $0.565\ \mathrm{kHz}$ and an alternating field (AF) of ${\sim}140\ \mathrm{A/m},$ produces a low-intensity, nonsaturating alternating magnetic field. Core sections of unconsolidated materials going through the influence of this field cause a change in oscillator frequency. Frequenc y information returned in pulse form to the susceptometer is converted into magnetic susceptibility. The instrument was set to record SI units with an integration period of ${\sim}1\ s_{:}$ , which produced  a sensitivity of $1\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ .  

The along-core response curve of the MS2C coil has a full widt h at half maximum of ${\sim}4~\mathrm{cm}$ (Blum, 1997) and is consistent with th e decay in magnetic intensity with distance from a dipole. Therefore, measurements of susceptibility from core pieces $<\!8\,\mathrm{cm}$ long will significantly underestimate magnetic susceptibility by more than $10\%$ .  

# P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity data can be used to evaluate small-strain modul i and evaluate porosity, compaction, and cementation. $P$ -wave velocity is the rate at which a (compressional) $P$ -wave travels through  a medium per unit time, expressed in meters per second. $P$ -wave velocity is dependent on the composition, porosity, bulk density, fabric, and temperature of the material, which in turn are functions o f consolidation and lithification, state of stress, and degree of fracturing. $P$ -wave velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is defined by the time required for a compressional wave to travel a specific distance:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ i s the traveltime through the core.  

The PWL system on the WRMSL transmits a $500~\mathrm{kHz}~P$ -wav e pulse across the core liner at a specified repetition rate. Pulser an d receiver are mounted on a caliper-type device and are aligned in order to make wave propagation perpendicular to the section’s lon g axis. A linear variable differential transducer measures the $P$ -wav e travel distance between the pulse source and the receiver. Goo d coupling between transducers and core liner is facilitated with water dripping onto the contact from a peristaltic water pump system. Signal processing software picks the first arrival of the wave at th e receiver, and the processing routine corrects for the thickness of th e liner. The total observed traveltime $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is composed of  

$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry, $t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure, $t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner, and $t_{\mathrm{core}}=$ traveltime through the cored material.  

The system is calibrated using a core liner filled with distille d water, which provides control for $t_{\mathrm{delay}},t_{\mathrm{pulse}},$ and $t_{\mathrm{liner}}$ . From these calibrations, $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ can be calculated for the whole-round specimens i n core liners as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{cl}}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{\mathrm{o}}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{cl}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner, $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness, and $t_{\mathrm{o}}=$ measured total traveltime.  

The above equation assumes that the core completely fills th e core liner. The PWL was deemed worthless for cores recovered wit h the XCB system, which often do not fill the core liner.  

A series of acrylic cylinders of varying thicknesses are used t o calibrate the PWL system. The regression of traveltime versus travel distance yields the $P$ -wave velocity of the standard material, whic h should be $2750\pm20\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . The thickness of the calibration samples, corrected for liner thickness, are divided by the travel time to calculate $P.$ -wave velocity in meters per second. The calibration is verifie d by measuring a core liner filled with pure water, and the calibratio n passes if the velocity is within $\pm\ 20\ \mathrm{m/s}$ of the expected value fo r water $\mathrm{1485~m/s})$ ).  

# Natural gamma radiation logger  

Gamma radiation is emitted from the decay series of mineralhosted 238-uranium $^{(238}\mathrm{U})$ , 232-thorium $(^{232}\mathrm{Th})$ , and 40-potassiu m (40K). The system in use was designed and built at the Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program-US Implementing Organization (USIO) a t Texas A&M University (Vasiliev et al., 2011). When $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , an d $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotopes decay, they and their daughter products emi t gamma radiation at specific energy levels unique to each isotope. NGR spectroscopy measures a wide energy spectrum that can b e used to estimate the abundance of each isotope based on th e strength of the signal at characteristic energies. Spectral data wer e collected and can be used for postexpedition processing for U, Th, and K abundance but were not processed on board. Total count s were used on board, with high counts usually identifying finegrained deposits containing K-rich clay minerals and their absorbe d U and Th isotopes. NGR data thus reveal stratigraphic details tha t aid in core-to-core correlations. Serpentinite muds and ultramafi c rocks have very low concentrations of U, K, and Th.  

The main NGR detector unit consists of 8 sodium iodide (NaI ) scintillator detectors arranged along the core measurement axis a t $20~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals surrounding the section. The section is measure d once and then moves $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ and is measured again to provide $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ measurement spacing. The detector array has passive (layers o f lead) and active (plastic scintillators) shielding to reduce the background environmental and cosmic radiation. The overlying plasti c scintillators detect incoming high-energy gamma and muon cosmi c radiation and cancel this signal from the total counted by the Na I detectors. The NGRL was calibrated using $^{137}\!C s$ and $^{60}{\bf C o}$ sources t o identify peaks at 662 and $1330\;\mathrm{keV},$ respectively.  

Total counts are routinely summed over the range of 100–300 0 $\operatorname{keV}.$ The quality of the measured energy spectrum depends on th e concentration of radionuclides in the sample and on the countin g time, with longer counting times providing better counting statistics. A live counting time of 5 min was set in each position (for  a total live count time of about $10\,\mathrm{\min}$ per section). Sections wer e scanned only once.  

# Thermal conductivity  

Thermal conductivity measurements at one location in ever y other section were made using the TK04 (Teka Bolin) system described by Blum (1997). For whole-round soft-recovery cores,  a needle probe in full-space configuration (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959) was used. The probes contain a heater wire and calibrate d thermistor.  

For soft recovery, the needle probe was inserted into a $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter hole drilled along one of the lines that later guided cor e splitting. The location was at around $60{-}70~\mathrm{cm}$ from the top of th e section or in an interval with low disturbance based on visual inspection. To avoid interference from airflow in the laboratory, th e core was placed into an enclosed box insulated with foam.  

A heating power of $0.5{-}2\,\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}$ was typically used in soft recovery. The solution to the heat conduction equation with a line sourc e of heat was then fit to the temperature measurements to obtain th e thermal conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductiv e than sediment or igneous rock, the probe is assumed to be a perfec t conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of the superconductive probe has a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of the time after the initiation of the heat:  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times l\up n(t)+\up C,
$$  

where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\left(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (s), and   
$C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three measuring cycles separated by a cooling interval of 1 0 min were automatically performed to calculate average conductivity. A self-test, which included a drift study, was conducted at th e beginning of each measurement cycle. Once the probe temperatur e stabilized, the heater circuit was closed and the temperature rise i n the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity was calculated fro m the rate of temperature rise while the heater current was flowing. Temperatures measured during the first 60 to ${\bf80\,s}$ of the heating cycle were fitted to an approximate solution of a constantly heated lin e source (for details, see Blum, 1997). Measurement errors were $5\%-$ $10\%$ . Data are reported in watts per meter degree Kelvin.  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

Color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility were measured o n archive section halves using the SHMSL. The archive half wa s placed on the core track, above which an electronic platform move s along a track recording the height of the split-core surface with  a laser sensor. The laser establishes the height of the section half’ s surface and the location of the bottom of the section, and then th e platform reverses the direction of movement, moving from botto m to top making measurements of point magnetic susceptibility an d color reflectance. Intervals where material did not fill the sectio n half or contained foam inserts were excluded from measurement, s o the measured range of values represents that of core material only. Color reflectance and point magnetic susceptibility data were collected at constant intervals of $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ .  

# Color reflectance spectrometry  

At the first two sites (U1491 and U1492), the color reflectanc e spectrometer was equipped with an Ocean Optics USB4000 sensor.  

After Site U1492, the color spectrophotometer sensor was upgraded to an Ocean Optics QEPro model that provides a slightl y larger spectral range and has a significant increase in low-light resolution. Both spectrophotometers used a $30~\mathrm{mm}$ integrating spher e and were illuminated using a combined OceanOptics HL-2000 halogen and the OceanOptics BluLoop LED light sources. The HL2000 provides illumination from 360 to $2400\;\mathrm{nm}$ , and the BluLoop, using four LED sources, provides a balanced output from 400 to 70 0 nm, covering wavelengths from ultraviolet through visible to nea r infrared. Measurements were taken from 380 to $900\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\nm}}$ wavelengths at $2~\mathrm{nm}$ intervals. The ${\sim}3$ s data acquisition offset was applied for the entire scan of the archive half. Data are reported usin g the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\,\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\,\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color system, in which $L^{\ast}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ is redness (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is yellowness (positive ) versus blueness (negative). The color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure white (reference) and pure black (dark). Color calibration was conducted once every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ .  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

Point magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartingto n MS2 meter and an MS2K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diamete r round sensor with a field of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and an operatio n frequency of $930\,\mathrm{Hz}$ . The instrument averages three measurement s from the sensor for each offset, leading to an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . Th e spatial resolution of the point magnetic susceptibility instrument i s ${\sim}3\;\mathrm{mm}$ , higher than that of the whole-round magnetic susceptibilit y measurement $\mathrm{20\mm})$ . As with whole-round measurements, th e output displayed by the point magnetic susceptibility sensor mus t be converted to dimensionless SI units by multiplying by $10^{-5}$ . Th e probe is zeroed in air before each measurement location to avoi d influence from the metal track. The point magnetic susceptibilit y meter was calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on th e ship and is quality checked every $6\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{{z}}}$ , at the same time as color reflectance sensor calibration. The SHMSL magnetic susceptibilit y measurements integrate over a smaller depth than the WRMS L loop measurements.  

# Discrete measurements  

# P-wave velocity  

The $P$ -wave velocity system uses Panametrics-NDT Microsca n delay line transducers (transmitting at $0.5\ \mathrm{MHz})$ . The signal received through the section half or discrete sample was recorded b y the Velocity Gantry 2.0.5.0 IODP software, where the peak of th e first $P$ -wave arrival is automatically or manually chosen. In case of  a weak signal, manual picking of the first arrival was performed.  

The distance between transducers was measured with a built-i n linear voltage displacement transformer. Calibration was performe d daily with a series of acrylic cylinders of differing thicknesses and  a known $P$ -wave velocity of $2750\,\pm\,20~\mathrm{m/s}$ . The determined syste m time delay from calibration was subtracted from the picked arrival time to give a traveltime of the $P$ -wave through the sample. Th e thickness of the sample (calculated by the linear voltage displacement transformer, in meters) was divided by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity in meters per second. It wa s difficult to pick a clean first $P$ -wave arrival from the serpentinit e mud data from this instrument, and measurements were typicall y attempted on only the first few cores at each site. The WRMSL $P_{-}$ - wave instrument, in contrast, produced more reliable $P_{\|}$ -wave data.  

For soft-recovery cores, $P$ -wave velocity measurements wer e performed on the working half before any sampling. Following standard IODP conventions, $P$ -wave velocity measurements used the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ - and $z$ -axis of the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG), wit h several analyses per core. Different positions with respect to lithology were chosen to generate viable data. Rock cube samples wer e oriented following Blum (1997) and placed on a gantry that measures $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity in three orthogonal directions $(x-,\,y-$ and $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ - directions). $P_{\|}$ -wave anisotropy ratios were calculated from thes e multidirectional analyses. Before measurements, the cubes wer e seawater saturated using a vacuum pump for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ .  

# Automated vane shear  

The shear strength of a material describes the point at which  a significant structural failure occurs in response to an applied shea r stress. Shear strength of the mudflow matrix and pelagic sedimen t was measured using the automated vane shear by Giesa because thi s method is suited for measuring the shear strength of very soft to relatively stiff marine sediments. This geotechnical test is useful fo r determining the undrained shear strength of undisturbed clay- o r silt-rich samples; it is not suitable for coarser grained sediments o r sediment containing silt or sand laminations.  

The Giesa system consists of a controller and a gantry for shea r vane insertion. A four-bladed miniature vane was pushed carefull y into the sediment of the working halves until the top of the vane wa s level with the core surface. The vane was then rotated at a constan t rate of $60^{\circ}/\mathrm{min}$ to determine the torque required to cause the cor e material to be sheared (failure torque). All vane shear strength measurements were obtained using a vane with a height of $12.7\,\mathrm{mm}$ an d a blade length of $6.35~\mathrm{mm}$ . Failure torque was determined by measuring the rotation of a torsional spring using a spring-specific relation between rotation angle and torque.  

Then, vane shear strength $\left(S_{\mathrm{u}}[\mathrm{V}]\right)$ can be determined as follows:  

$$
S_{\mathrm{u}}(\mathrm{V})=T/\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{v}}=(\Delta/\mathrm{B})/\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{v}},
$$  

where  

$T\!=$ torque required to induce material failure $\left(\mathsf{N}\mathrm{{\cdot}}\mathsf{m}\right)$ , ${\mathbb K}_{\mathrm v}=$ constant, depending on vane dimensions $(\mathbf{m}^{3})$ , $\Delta=$ maximum torque angle (°) at failure, and $\mathbf{B}=\,$ spring constant that relates the deflection angle to the torque (°/N·m) (Blum, 1997).  

Typically, there was one measurement per core section until th e recovered material became too firm for vane insertion. Measurements were generally taken in undisturbed relatively fine graine d intervals, where possible.  

# Moisture and density  

To perform MAD analysis in working halves, the unconsolidated materials were sampled using plastic syringes or spatulas fo r $\mathrm{\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ volume. Preweighed, numbered $16\,\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vial s were used to process and store the samples. Typically, one sampl e per section was collected. Measured samples were strategically chosen to capture lithologic variations in the core and to correct fo r WRMSL GRA measurements. For hard rock, the discrete cubes initially used for paleomagnetism and $P$ -wave velocity $^P$ -wave calipe r [PWC]) measurements were also used for MAD analyses when possible.  

Mass and volume measurements were made to determine we t and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, and porosity. After measurement of wet mass, samples were dried in a convectio n oven for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Dried samples were then coole d in a desiccator for at least $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ before the dry mass and volume wer e measured.  

# Dual balance system  

The weights of wet and dry sample masses were determined to  a precision of $0.005\ \mathrm{g}$ using two Mettler Toledo (XS204) electroni c balances and a computer averaging system to compensate for th e ship’s motion. A standard weight of comparable value to the sampl e (maximum $=>\!10\%$ of the sample mass) was placed on a referenc e balance to increase accuracy. The default setting of the balances i s 300 measurements. After wet mass determinations and $P$ -wav e measurements (for cube samples), samples were placed in the drying oven and then allowed to cool in the desiccator prior to the determination of dry masses.  

# Hexapycnometer volume measurement  

Dry sample volume was determined using a hexapycnomete r system of a six-celled, custom-configured Micromeritics AccuPy c 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer. The system measure s dry sample volume using pressurized He-filled chambers; the precision of each cell is better than $1\%$ of the full-scale volume whe n properly calibrated and operated. Volume measurements were preceded by three purges of the sample chamber with helium. For eac h measurement, five unknown cells and one cell that contained tw o stainless steel calibration spheres (3 and $7\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) with a total volum e of ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ were run. Calibration spheres were cycled through th e cells to identify any systematic error and/or instrument drift. Spheres are assumed known to within $1\%$ of their total volume. Th e volumes occupied by the numbered Wheaton vials were calculate d before the expedition by multiplying each vial’s weight against th e average density of the vial glass. The procedures for the determination of these physical properties comply with the American Societ y for Testing and Materials (ASTM International, 1990).  

Moisture and density calculations  

The calculations given below are used as an IODP standard i n accordance with Blum (1997). MAD properties reported and plotted in the Physical properties section of each site chapter were calculated with the MADMax shipboard program set with the metho d applicable to saturated, fine-grained sediments called “Method C. ” Method C is based on the measurement of wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dr y mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ . The ratio of mass $(\mathrm{rm})$ is a computational constant of 0.965 (i.e., $0.965\mathrm{~g~}$ of freshwater per $1{\mathrm{~g~}}$ of seawater). Salt precipitated in pores in the samples during the dryin g process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of th e evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $(M_{\mathrm{salt}})$ in the sample are given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}},\mathrm{and}}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}\,[s/(1-s)],}\end{array}
$$  

where s is the assumed saltwater salinity (0.035) corresponding to  a pore water density $(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ of $1.024~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ o f $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of por e water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of sal t $\left(V_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\mathrm{[}V_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},}&{}&\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}},}&{}&\end{array}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},\quad\quad}\\ {M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),}\\ {M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}},}\\ {V_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}},\quad\quad}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

For all samples, water content $(w)$ is expressed as the ratio o f mass of pore water to wet sample (total) mass:  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sample grain density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio (VR) are calculated as  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ {\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{dry}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ {\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ {\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ {\Phi=V_{\mathrm{per}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},\,\mathrm{and}}\\ {\mathsf{V R}=V_{\mathrm{per}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.}\end{array}

An accuracy and precision of MAD measurements of ${\sim}0.5\%$ ca n be achieved with the shipboard devices. The largest source of potential error is the loss of material or moisture during the ${\sim}30{-}48\ \mathrm{h}$ long procedure for each sample.  

# Downhole measurements  

# Temperature measurements  

During Expedition 366, downhole temperature measurement s were made using the APCT-3 and the water-sampling temperatur e probe (WSTP) to characterize transport of heat, fluids, and solute s in active serpentinite mud volcanoes. Fluid flow transports solute s from the subducting slab through the mantle wedge, where the fluids react with mantle rocks before discharging on the seafloor; on e aim of the temperature measurements is to provide constraints o n rates of fluid flow. If sufficiently detailed, the measured temperatur e profiles can be used to estimate flow rates where they are greate r than ${\sim}0.1\:\mathrm{mm/day}$ for equilibrated standard conditions. These rate s can then be compared to those that can be calculated from systematic variations in pore water chemical profiles.  

Formation temperatures were measured using the APCT-3 a t five sites. The WSTP was used to measure temperature profiles an d collect water samples in cased Holes U1496C and U1497D. A temperature dual-pressure tool (T2P) deployment in Hole U1492C wa s canceled at the last minute due to deteriorating borehole conditions. Revisions to the T2P deployment procedure based on Expedition 362 operations (McNeill et al., 2017b) are briefly outline d below.  

# Advanced piston corer temperature tool  

In situ temperature measurements were made with the APCT- 3 when the APC was deployed. The APCT-3 fits directly into the coring shoe of the APC and can therefore be used to measure formation temperatures during regular piston coring. The tool consists o f a battery pack, data logger, and platinum resistance-temperatur e device calibrated over a temperature range from $0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Befor e entering the borehole, the tool is first stopped at the mudline for  5 min to thermally equilibrate and to estimate the bottom water temperature. However, the lowest temperature recorded during the ru n was occasionally used as an estimate of the bottom water temperature instead of the average temperature at the mudline because (1) i t was more repeatable and (2) the bottom water is expected to hav e the lowest temperature in the profile. When the APCT-3 is plunge d into the formation, there is an instantaneous temperature rise fro m frictional heating. This heat gradually dissipates into the surrounding formation as the temperature within the APCT-3 equilibrates t o the temperature of the unconsolidated materials. After the APCT- 3 penetrates the formation, it is held in place for $10\ \mathrm{min}$ while it records the temperature of the cutting shoe every second.  

# Thermal data reduction  

The transient thermal decay curves for formation therma l probes are known to be a function of the geometry of the probe s and the thermal properties of the probe and the formation (Bullard, $1954;$ ; Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). Data analysis requires fittin g the measurements to analytical or synthetic decay curves calculate d based on tool geometry, sampling interval, and tool and formatio n thermal properties. The thermal time constant of the cutting sho e assembly into which the APCT-3 tool is inserted is ${\sim}2{-}3\ \mathrm{min}$ . Dat a reduction for the APCT-3 was performed using the program TP-Fi t (Heeseman, 2008). It is generally not possible to obtain a perfec t match between the synthetic curves and the data because (1) th e probe does not reach thermal equilibrium during the penetratio n period, (2) contrary to ideal theory, the frictional pulse upon insertion is not instantaneous, and (3) temperature data are sampled a t discrete intervals, so the exact time of penetration is uncertain. Thus, both the effective penetration time and equilibrium temperature must be estimated by applying a fitting procedure, which involves shifting the synthetic curves in time to obtain a match wit h the recorded data. Heeseman (2008) suggests that the best fit is obtained from the final third of the data set. Shipboard thermal conductivities were used for calculating heat flow and also input int o the TP-Fit calculation for estimating in situ temperatures. Laboratory thermal conductivity measurements were not corrected for i n situ conditions because the correction would be small at the shallo w depths that were drilled.  

Heat flow was calculated with the same approach used fo r Ocean Drilling Program Site 1200 (Shipboard Science Party, 2002c ) by applying a single thermal conductivity value in the equation  

$$
q=K\times(\Delta\mathrm{T}/\Delta\mathrm{Z}),
$$  

where  

$q=$ heat flow $(\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}^{2})$ , $K\!=$ thermal conductivity $\scriptstyle\left(\mathrm{W}/\left[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}\right]\right)$ , and $\Delta\mathrm{T}/\Delta Z=$ average thermal gradient $(^{\circ}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{m})$  

# Water-sampling temperature probe  

Samples of water and temperature profiles were collected insid e the summit casings at two sites using the WSTP, a passive sample r deployed in the BHA. Before deployment, the overflow chambe r was filled with nitrogen and the fluid path was flushed with nanopure water. A timer was set to open the valve at a fixed time, exposing the sampling line and chamber to ambient pressure. The time r also closes the chamber after a prearranged time interval ha s passed. In operation, the WSTP is mounted inside a core barrel an d lowered within the drill pipe by wireline. The tool was lowered approximately $40\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , with the probe tip extending $1.2~\mathrm{m}$ ahead of th e RCB bit and in the open hole below the APC bit. The tool is the n held in position with the pumps off, and the timer-operated valve i s opened. The valve was left open 5 min. When the valve is open, bottom water is drawn into the sample coils under negative relativ e pressure through the filter and into the sample chamber, displacin g the nitrogen. The chamber contains three sample volumes, a coile d titanium tube, a coiled copper tube (for dissolved helium and hydrogen), and the chamber itself $({\sim}1\,\mathrm{L})$ .  

During both deployments, temperatures were recorded eac h second. The depth of the tool was held constant for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ at th e locations of the water samples. At other selected locations in eac h cased hole, the depth was held constant for $5{-}10\ \mathrm{min}$ .  

# Temperature dual-pressure tool  

For details on the T2P, see the Expedition 362 methods chapte r (McNeill et al., 2017a). Based on Expedition 362 operations, ther e were several recommended revisions to the deployment strategy fo r the T2P during Expedition 366. The most important recommendation was to limit the applied standpipe pressure to less than 750 ps i when driving the tool into the formation to remain below the buckling strength of the tool. Other deployment changes concerned preparing and unlatching the motion decoupled hydraulic deliver y system (MDHDS). A series of steps were added to the deploymen t manual to ensure the MDHDS latch is engaged prior to deploymen t in the drill string. Once the MDHDS is in position, the new recommendation is to raise standpipe pressure to a maximum of 750 ps i for unlatching. The previous value was 1000–1200 psi.

# Wireline logging  

Downhole logs are used to determine physical, chemical, an d structural properties of the formation penetrated by a borehole. Th e data are rapidly collected, continuous with depth, and measured i n situ; they can be interpreted in terms of the stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, and geochemical composition of the penetrated formation. Where core recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log data ma y provide the only way to characterize the borehole section. Wher e core recovery is good, log and core data complement one anothe r and may be interpreted jointly. Downhole logs measure formatio n properties on a scale that is intermediate between those obtaine d from laboratory measurements on core samples and those fro m geophysical surveys. They are useful in calibrating the interpretation of seismic profiles and provide a link for the integrated understanding of physical properties on all scales.  

During wireline logging operations, the logs are recorded wit h Schlumberger logging tools combined into tool strings, which ar e lowered into the hole after completion of coring operations. On e tool string was used during Expedition 366: the triple combo, whic h measures magnetic susceptibility, NGR, resistivity, borehole diameter, and borehole fluid temperature (Figure F16; Tables T2, T3). Th e tool string also contains a telemetry cartridge for communicatin g through the wireline to the Schlumberger data acquisition syste m (multi-tasking acquisition and imaging system [MAXIS] unit) o n the ship. Active sources were omitted from the string due to th e short time before the end of the expedition, so formation densit y was not measured.

In preparation for logging, the boreholes were flushed of debri s by circulating a high-viscosity mud (sepiolite) sweep. The BHA wa s pulled up to about $52\,\textrm{m}$ wireline logging depth below seafloo r (WSF) to cover the unstable upper part of the hole. The tool string s were then lowered downhole on a seven-conductor wireline cabl e before being pulled up at constant speed of ${\sim}275~\mathrm{m/h}$ to provid e continuous measurements of several properties simultaneously.  A wireline heave compensator (WHC) was used to minimize the effect of ship’s heave on the tool position in the borehole, except when ship heave was minimal. During each logging run, incoming data were recorded and monitored in real time on the Schlumberger Minimum Configuration MAXIS (MCM) logging computer.

Logged formation properties and tool measurement principles The logged properties and the principles used in the tools to measure them are briefly described in this section. The main logs are listed in Table T2. More detailed information on individual tools and their geological applications may be found in Rider (1996), Goldberg (1997), and Ellis and Singer (2007). A complete online list of acronyms for Schlumberger tools and measurement curves is available at http://www.apps.slb.com/cmd/.  

# Natural gamma radiation  

The Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS) was used on the triple combo tool string to measure and classify NGR in the formation. It has two bismuth germanate scintillation detectors, and concentrations of K, U, and Th are determined from the characteristic gamma ray energy spectra of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series. An additional NGR sensor is housed in the Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC), run on all tool strings. Its sodium iodide scintillation detector measures the total NGR emission of the formation with no spectral information. The inclusion of a NGR sonde in every tool string allows use of NGR data for depth correlation between logging strings and passes and for core-log integration.  

# Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) provides six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation (including  borehole  mud  resistivity  and  five  measurements  of formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation). The tool sends a focused current into the formation and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constant drop in voltage across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurements. The tool has one central (source) electrode and six electrodes above and below it, which serve alternatively as focusing and returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role of these electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool is designed to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the same time and tool position and to reduce the sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects when crossing sharp beds thinner than the electrode spacing. The design of the HRLA, which eliminates the need for a surface reference electrode, improves formation resistivity evaluation compared to the traditional dual induction tool. The HRLA needs to be run centralized in the borehole for optimal results, so bowspring centralizers were used to keep the HRLA in the center of the borehole, and knuckle joints allowed the density tool to be eccentralized and maintain good contact with the borehole wall (Figure F16). Calcite, silica, and hydrocarbons are electrical insulators, whereas ionic solutions like interstitial water are conductors. Electrical resistivity can therefore be used to evaluate porosity for a given salinity and resistivity of interstitial water. Clay surface conduction also contributes to resistivity values, but at high porosities this effect is relatively minor.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

The magnetic susceptibility sonde (MSS) is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO; Columbia University, USA). It measures the ease with which formations are magnetized when subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetization is ultimately related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magnetic minerals (principally magnetite) in the formation. These measurements provide one of the best methods for investigating stratigraphic  changes  in  mineralogy  and  lithology  because  the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructive and because different lithologies often have strongly contrasting magnetic susceptibilities.  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution measurements with ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ depth of horizontal investigation. The MSS was run as the lowermost tool in the triple combo tool string, using a data translation cartridge to enable the MSS to be run in combination with the Schlumberger tools. Magnetic susceptibility data from the MSS are plotted as uncalibrated units and are affected by temperature and borehole size (higher temperatures lead to higher susceptibility measurements). The high susceptibility variations of the formations drilled during Expedition 366 are much larger than the effects due to temperature and hole size. For quality control and environmental correction, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axis  acceleration,  and  low-resolution  borehole conductivity.  

# Log data quality  

The main influence on log data quality is the condition of the borehole wall. Where the borehole diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts (wide borehole) or ledges made of layers of harder material, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehole wall (i.e., the Formation MicroScanner [FMS], density, and porosity tools) may be degraded. Deep investigation measurements such as NGR, resistivity, and sonic velocity, which do not require contact with the borehole wall, are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions. Very narrow (“bridged”) sections also cause irregular log results. The quality of the borehole is improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling fluid while drilling, flushing th e borehole to remove debris, and logging as soon as possible afte r drilling and hole conditioning are completed. During the expedition, circulation of drilling fluid, necessary to cool the bit and clea r the hole of cuttings, washed out (widened) the borehole in places, particularly in less consolidated materials.  

The quality of the wireline depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determine d from the length of the cable played out from the winch on the ship. The seafloor is identified on the NGR log by the abrupt reduction i n gamma ray count at the water/seabed boundary (mudline). Discrepancies between the drilling depth and the wireline log depth occur. In the case of drilling depth, discrepancies are because of core expansion, incomplete core recovery, or incomplete heave compensation. In the case of log depth, discrepancies between successive run s occur because of incomplete heave compensation, incomplete correction for cable stretch, and cable slip. Tidal changes in sea leve l affect both drilling and logging depths.  

# Wireline heave compensator  

The WHC system is designed to compensate for the vertica l motion of the ship and maintain a steady motion for the loggin g tools. It uses vertical acceleration measurements made by a motio n reference unit (MRU) located under the rig floor near the center o f gravity of the ship to calculate the vertical motion of the ship. It the n adjusts the length of the wireline by varying the distance betwee n two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes. Real-time measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleration are mad e simultaneously by the MRU and the EDTC, respectively.  

# Logging data flow and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real tim e and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. The initial logging data were referenced to the rig floor (wireline depth below rig floor [WRF] scale). After logging was completed, the dat a were shifted to a seafloor reference (WSF scale) based on the step i n gamma radiation at the water/seabed interface. The data wer e transferred to the Borehole Research Group at LDEO, where standardized data reduction took place. The main correction was dept h matching to remove depth offsets between data from different logging runs, which results in a new depth scale, wireline log matche d depth below seafloor (WMSF). The second uplog became the wireline depth reference, and its WSF scale is the same as its WMS F scale. The logs are documented with an assessment of log quality, and the data were converted to ASCII. Schlumberger Geo-Quest’ s Techlog software package is used for most of the wireline log dat a processing. Data were transferred back to the ship within a few day s of logging, and this processed data set was made available to the science party (in ASCII format).  

# Paleomagnetism  

Shipboard paleomagnetic measurements during Expedition 36 6 were investigated to determine the direction and intensity of paleomagnetic remanent magnetization. Routine measurements wer e conducted on archive halves with stepwise AF demagnetization. Discrete cube samples were taken from working halves and measured with stepwise AF demagnetization for selected intervals.  

Magnetostratigraphy was attempted in the ash-rich pelagic sediments that drape most of the sites located on the flanks of the seamounts and in the ash-rich deposits underlying the mud volcan o serpentinite muds close to the toe of slope at Site U1498. In the serpentinite mudflow units, if there is a reversal in the paleomagneti c polarity from one mudflow unit to the next, it could provide a firstorder indication of the time interval between mudflow events an d help distinguish between flows that are otherwise similar in appearance. Because magnetite is produced by the serpentinization process, rock-magnetic properties of serpentinized material will also b e useful to distinguish between mudflows.  

# New superconducting rock magnetometer  

During the port call in Guam, a new 2G Enterprises model 760 R cryogenic magnetometer was installed in the Core laboratory, and i t was used throughout the expedition. The system performed well, and the results are satisfactory, based on comparisons of result s from the JR6 spinner magnetometer and the new 2G cryogeni c magnetometer. However, no comprehensive testing program usin g standard samples was carried out during the expedition. For halfcore sections, we used the factory-supplied geometric correction.  

# Challenges of paleomagnetic measurements on serpentinite mudflow materials  

The materials collected during Expedition 366 present particular challenges for paleomagnetic measurements. First, after the los s of part of the BHA at the first site, it was considered prudent not t o use the remaining nonmagnetic drill collars for the rest of the expedition. This choice resulted in some strong subvertical magneti c overprints imparted to the cores (as well as possible subhorizontal overprints in some cores). Second, unlike pelagic sediments, mudflow units are not deposited steadily over time, and it is not clea r how well the magnetic minerals acquire the magnetic remanenc e when the mud stops flowing. Third, serpentinization is thought t o continue after deposition, which may involve alteration of the magnetic minerals. Fourth, the serpentinite muds contain randomly oriented rock clasts of variable magnetization intensity, which ca n locally dominate the paleomagnetic signal.  

# Coordinates  

Magnetic data are reported relative to the IODP orientatio n conventions: $+x$ is into the face of the working half, $+y$ points toward the left side of the face of the working half, and $+z$ is downhole. The relationship of the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM ) coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ to data coordinates $(x,y,z)$ are $x=X,y=Y,$ an d $z=-Z$ for archive halves and $x=-X,y=-Y,$ and $z=-Z$ for workin g halves.  

# Magnetic measurements  

Remanent magnetization was measured using the 2G Enterprises model 760R SRM equipped with superconducting quantu m interference devices (SQUIDs) and an in-line, automated AF demagnetizer capable of reaching a peak field of $80\,\mathrm{mT}$ . Ocean drillin g cores generally carry secondary overprint remanence components. Common overprints for ocean drilling cores include natural viscou s remanence and a steep downward-pointing component attribute d to the drill strings. To separate them from the characteristic remanence (ChRM), stepwise demagnetization experiments were performed, as described below.  

The calibrated bulk magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ , normalized b y volume, of representative discrete samples from Sites U1496– U1498 was measured with an AGICO KLY 4S Kappabridge instrument using the Sufar (AGICO) software.  

# Archive halves  

We performed successive AF demagnetization using the in-line AF demagnetizer on the SRM (2G Enterprises model 760R-4K) on most of the archive sections. The in-line AF demagnetizer applies field to the $X_{\leftarrow},\,Y_{\leftarrow}$ , and $Z$ -axis of the 2G SRM in this fixed order. We used demagnetization steps up to $30\;\mathrm{mT}$ for demagnetizing tray and sections. AF demagnetization results are plotted individually as vector plots (Zijderveld, 1967) and as downhole variations with depth. The response curve from the SRM sensor coils corresponds to a region ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{cm}$ wide; therefore, only measurements taken every $15\,\mathrm{cm}$ are independent from each other. Measurements on archive sections are conducted using the software (IMS-Version 9.2).  

# Discrete samples  

Oriented discrete samples representative of the lithology were collected from the working section halves. In soft unconsolidated materials, discrete samples are normally taken in plastic “Japanese” Natsuhara-Giken sampling cubes $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample volume). Cubes are pushed into the working half of the core by hand with the “up” arrow on the cube pointing upsection. For indurated intervals, cubes are cut with a table saw and trimmed to fit into the plastic containers. In lithified sediments and hard rocks, minicores $\langle{\sim}11~\mathrm{cm}^{3}\rangle$ ) are taken.  

Paleomagnetic data collected on the pass-through SRM are directly uploaded to the LIMS database.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Expedition 366 sites are located at low latitudes, between $13.8^{\circ}$ and $18.1^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ , corresponding to magnetic inclinations between $25^{\circ}$ and $33^{\circ}$ , assuming an axial geocentric dipole. Transitions between normal and reversed geomagnetic polarity should therefore be detectable. Micropaleontological analysis and biostratigraphy will be conducted postexpedition and will help define age constraints for magnetostratigraphy. If obtained, we would correlate geomagnetic polarity sequences from Expedition 366 pelagic sediments with the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) of Gradstein et al. (2012).
