# Abstract  

Marine gateways play a critical role in the exchange of water, heat, salt, and nutrients betwee n oceans and seas. Changes in gateway geometry can significantly alter both the pattern o f global  ocean circulation and climate. Today, the volume of dense water supplied by Atlantic– Mediterranean exchange through the Gibraltar Strait is among the largest in the global ocean. Fo r the past 5 My, this overflow has generated a saline plume at intermediate depths in the Atlanti c that deposits distinctive contouritic sediments and contributes to the formation of North Atlanti c Deep Water. This single gateway configuration only developed in the Early Pliocene. During th e Miocene, two narrow corridors linked the Mediterranean and Atlantic: one in northern Morocc o and the other in southern Spain. Formation of these corridors followed by progressive restrictio n and closure resulted in extreme salinity fluctuations in the Mediterranean, leading to the precipitation of the Messinian Salinity Crisis salt giant. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP ) Expedition 401 is the offshore drilling component of a Land-2-Sea drilling proposal, Investigatin g Miocene Mediterranean–Atlantic Gateway Exchange (IMMAGE). Its aim is to recover a complet e record of Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange from its Late Miocene inception to its current configuration by targeting Miocene offshore sediments on either side of the Gibraltar Strait. Miocen e cores from the two precursor connections now exposed on land will be obtained by future International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) campaigns.  

# Plain language summary  

Today, Mediterranean–Atlantic seawater exchange takes place exclusively through the Gibralta r Strait. Around 8 million years ago, however, there were another two gateways: one in norther n Morocco and the other through southern Spain. Both connections have subsequently closed an d been tectonically uplifted and preserved on land. Extreme narrowing of these pre-Gibraltar Strai t connections raised salinity in the Mediterranean substantially, leading to the precipitation of mor e than $1\,\mathrm{km}$ of salt on the Mediterranean’s seafloor. This process may have contributed to a majo r episode of global cooling. The chemical and physical properties of the sediments preserved in an d on either side of these corridors are key to understanding and quantifying this global cooling. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 401 is the offshore drilling component of the Land-2-Sea drilling proposal, Investigating Miocene Mediterranean–Atlantic Gatewa y Exchange (IMMAGE). The expedition recovered records of exchange preserved off shore in th e Atlantic and Mediterranean. Future drilling on shore will target the fossil gateway records that ar e now preserved on land.  

# 1. Introduction  

Marine gateways play a critical role in the exchange of water, heat, salt, and nutrients betwee n oceans and seas. The advection of dense waters helps drive global thermohaline circulation, an d because the ocean is the largest of the rapidly exchanging $C O_{2}$ reservoirs, this advection als o affects atmospheric carbon concentration. Changes in gateway geometry can therefore significantly alter both the pattern of global ocean circulation and associated heat transport and climate, as well as having a profound local impact. Today, the volume of dense water supplied by Atlantic– Mediterranean exchange through the Gibraltar Strait is among the largest in the global ocean. Fo r the past 5 My, this overflow has generated a saline plume at intermediate depths in the Atlanti c that deposits distinctive contouritic sediments in the Gulf of Cádiz and contributes to the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). This single gateway configuration only developed i n the Early Pliocene. During the Miocene, a wide, open seaway linking the Mediterranean an d Atlantic evolved into two narrow corridors: one in northern Morocco and the other in souther n Spain. Formation and restriction of these corridors permitted Mediterranean salinity to rise and  a new, distinct, dense water mass to form and overspill into the Atlantic for the first time. Furthe r restriction and closure of these connections resulted in extreme salinity fluctuations in the Mediterranean, leading to the formation of the Messinian Salinity Crisis salt giant. Investigating Miocene Mediterranean–Atlantic Gateway Exchange (IMMAGE) is a Land-2-Sea drilling proposa l designed to recover a complete record of Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange from its Late Miocen e inception to its current configuration. This will be achieved by targeting Miocene offshore sediments on either side of the Gibraltar Strait during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP ) Expedition 401 and recovering Miocene cores from the two precursor connections now expose d on land with future International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) campaigns. Th e scientific aims of IMMAGE are to constrain quantitatively the consequences for ocean circulatio n and global climate of the inception of Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange, to explore the mechanisms for high-amplitude environmental change in marginal marine systems, and to test physica l oceanographic hypotheses for extreme high-density overflow dynamics that do not exist in th e world today on this scale.  

# 2. Background  

Paleoclimate research is often driven by the need to validate various types of climate models unde r boundary conditions different from those of the last 150 y for which an instrumental record o f climate is available (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014). Quantifying past change s in temperature, momentum, and flux in the ocean and atmosphere is therefore a key target fo r geologic research. However, the small size of climate change signals relative to climate proxy measurement uncertainty means this is challenging to achieve (Rohling, 2007). A high signal-to-nois e ratio typically requires amplification of the climate variable, and in the ocean, this is most commonly found in marginal marine basins where exchange with the open ocean is limited so it cannot buffer and diminish the signal of environmental change (Grant et al., 2017). Unfortunately, limited exchange also makes it difficult to use the enhanced marginal basin record to extrapolat e to global-scale oceanographic change (Kaminski et al., 2002). Marine gateways linking the basin t o the open ocean represent a sweet spot where on one side climatic changes are amplified in th e adjoining marginal basin, whereas on the other side their impact on globally meaningful change s in the open ocean can be directly assessed. In addition, the geometric and hydraulic restriction o f the gateway itself places physical limitations on the freedom of the system to change (Nelson et al., 1999). This focuses the deposition of the sedimentologic archive of exchange into a small, wel l defined geographical area, making it possible to constrain quantitatively responses to exchang e that impact global climate (Rogerson et al., 2012b).  

The influence of exchanging heat, salt, and momentum through narrow, shallow straits that lin k the open ocean to marginal basins is profound. The advection of cool or saline waters (Legg et al., 2009) helps drive global thermohaline circulation (Thomas et al., 2004; Álvarez et al., 2005; Rahmstorf, 2006). Because the ocean is the largest of the rapidly exchanging $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reservoirs, this advection also increases the sensitivity of the ocean to atmospheric carbon changes (LaRiviere et al., 2012; Karas et al., 2017; Elsworth et al., 2017; Capella et al., 2019). Although exchange through th e Denmark Strait, Indonesian archipelago, and Gibraltar Strait can all overprint both zonal an d meridional circulation patterns, global ocean surface circulation and associated heat transpor t compensating for water mass transformation on the basinward side of gateways forces substantia l impacts on sea ice and warming or cooling of adjacent continents and the position of the atmospheric front (Ivanovic et al., 2014a). Unsurprisingly, the opening and closure of oceanic gateway s is well recognized as having a profound impact on the Earth’s climate, including its periodi c switching from Greenhouse to Icehouse conditions (Kennett, 1982; Smith and Pickering, 2003; Knutz, 2008; Bahr et al., 2022).  

The impact of regional changes on global-scale processes are generally ideal questions for th e Earth System Models theme. However, because of the inherent small scale of marine gateways relative to global circulation model grid cells, the gateways are either hugely enlarged in the model o r the transport of heat and water through them is parameterized rather than explicitly modele d (e.g., Dietrich et al., 2008; Ivanovic et al., 2013). An excellent example of the problem occurs a t Gibraltar (Figure F1), where model grid cells of ${\sim}400~\mathrm{km}^{2}$ , which are suitable for the long globa l simulations necessary for paleoclimate studies, are ill-equipped to simulate hydraulic control in  a strait ${\sim}15~\mathrm{km}$ in width and consequently generate exchange behavior that differs from observations (Ivanovic et al., 2013; Alhammoud et al., 2010). Consequently, the codependence of ocea n and marginal sea in simulations is reduced, preconditioning models to be insensitive to exchang e driven change. A view of past and future climate derived from global circulation assessments alon e therefore systematically underestimates the role of gateway processes, eliminating a crucial feedback within the Earth system. In summary, exchange through marine gateways is an example of  a key climate process that can only be constrained through interrogation of the record of ocean– marginal basin exchange in a specific sedimentary archive.

# 3. Geologic setting  

# 3.1. Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange now and in the past  

In the Atlantic, several marine overflows (Denmark Strait, Mediterranean, and Weddell Sea) supply dense water that collectively feeds the thermohaline circulation system (Smethie et al., 2000; Bahr et al., 2022). The transportation of dense water from the Mediterranean into the interior o f the Atlantic (Figure F2) is among the largest in the global ocean (Legg et al., 2009), and exchang e also provides a key exit point for Atlantic buoyancy, the underlying driver behind Atlantic dee p convection (Broecker, 1991).  

The dense Mediterranean overflow (MO) is generated as a consequence of its midlatitude settin g where evaporation exceeds precipitation (Peixoto and Kettani, 1973), generating a warm, salt y water mass. The negative hydrologic budget varies in severity through time, amplifying the climate signal transmitted principally through the Mediterranean’s southern catchments and derive d from North African monsoon rainfall (Marzocchi et al., 2015). This subtropical monsoona l climate signal with its strong precessional pulse is then propagated into the Atlantic by densitydriven exchange (Bahr et al., 2015) through the Gibraltar Strait. Water flowing out of the Mediterranean at depth entrains ambient Atlantic water as it goes (Dietrich et al., 2008), generating firs t the Mediterranean Overflow Water (MOW) in the Gulf of Cádiz and the Atlantic–Mediterranea n Water (AMW) in the rest of the Atlantic (Rogerson et al., 2012b) and large depositional an d erosional features including extensive sandy contouritic drifts (Figure F2; Nelson et al., 1999; Expedition 339 Scientists, 2013; Hernández-Molina et al., 2003, 2014a, 2014b). AMW flows north, fueling the Norwegian Sea with higher density water that helps sustain the formation and southward flow of NADW (Khélifi et al., 2009; Rogerson et al., 2012b; Kaboth et al., 2018).  

Despite the challenges of modeling the gateway, the exchange that occurs through the Gibralta r Strait today is a sufficiently influential component of the Earth System for general circulatio n models to capture at least part of its impact (Bigg et al., 2003; Bigg and Wadley, 2001). Experiment s without Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange show that its presence makes Greenland warmer an d Antarctica cooler (Bigg et al., 2003). This in turn is sufficient to shift the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and hence the location of monsoons, storm tracks, and the hyper-ari d zones between them. Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange is also a critical component of Atlanti c Meridional Overturning Circulation, particularly at times of weak NADW formation (Bigg an d Wadley, 2001; Ivanovic et al., 2014a, 2014b; Penaud et al., 2011; Rogerson et al., 2006, 2010; Voelker et al., 2006). Furthermore, the transport of dense water from the Mediterranean int o the interior of the Atlantic entrains ambient Atlantic water en route, contributing significantl y to global carbon drawdown $(2\%-5\%$ of today’s total net ocean carbon sink; Tans et al., 1993; Siegenthaler and Sarmiento, 1993; Dixon et al., 1994). Taken altogether, this makes Atlantic– Mediterranean exchange a key teleconnection that links African monsoon precipitation derive d from the south Atlantic with the northern high latitudes.  

Exchange through a single gateway at Gibraltar is a relatively recent phenomenon (HernándezMolina et al., 2014b; van der Schee et al., 2016; García-Gallardo et al., 2017a, 2017b). As a result o f Africa-Eurasia convergence, westward docking of the Alborán plate, and simultaneous slab retrea t (Jolivet and Faccenna, 2000; Faccenna et al., 2004; van Hinsbergen et al., 2014), the Atlantic– Mediterranean connection evolved from a single, wide open seaway (Figure F3) linking a Mediterranean that was more of an embayment of the Atlantic than a distinct marginal marine syste m (Flecker et al., 2015) to two narrow corridors: one in northern Morocco and the other in souther n Spain (Figure F3; Benson et al., 1991). The onset of episodic organic-rich sedimentation (sapropels) in the Middle Miocene (Hilgen et al., 2005; Taylforth et al., 2014) is the earliest evidence o f the Mediterranean operating separately from the Atlantic. Ongoing progressive restriction of th e marine corridors permitted Mediterranean salinity to rise, and a distinct, dense water mas s formed. This dense water overspill into the Atlantic occurred for the first time at some poin t during the Middle–Late Miocene (Capella et al., 2017, 2019; de Weger et al., 2020, 2021). Ultimately, the narrowing and closure of these connections resulted in extreme salinity fluctuations i n the Mediterranean, leading to the precipitation of more than 1 million $\mathbf{km}^{3}$ of salt, equivalent t o ${\sim}6\%$ of the total dissolved oceanic NaCl (Blanc, 2006; Ryan, Hsü, et al., 1973) in the latest Miocene. This event is known as the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC; Hsü et al., 1973). Ongoing tectoni c convergence coupled with isostatic rebound related to lithospheric mantle dynamics (Duggen e t al., 2003) not only severed these earlier marine connections but also uplifted and exposed them o n land (Capella et al., 2017; de Weger et al., 2021). In the Early Pliocene, two-way exchange wa s established through a single conduit, the Gibraltar Strait (Figure F3).  

During the MSC, the amplified net evaporative flux changed to such an extent that the salinity o f water flowing into the Atlantic varied between near-equality with Atlantic water $(\sim\!36~\mathrm{g/kg})$ t o halite-depositing brine $(>\!360\mathrm{~g/kg})$ and brackish water conditions $(<\!20\;\mathrm{g/kg})$ . Gibraltar exchang e today exhibits one of the largest density contrasts in the modern ocean, but this contrast was up t o two orders of magnitude higher during the acme of the MSC. The water flowing into the Atlanti c at this time was probably the most extremely dense overflow of oceanographic scale in Earth’ s history, and all other aspects of the exchange would have been proportionally exaggerated.

# 4. Scientific objectives  

The target of the IMMAGE drilling proposal is the record of Atlantic–Mediterranean exchang e during the most dynamic and variable period of its history, from inception $({\sim}8\mathrm{\Ma})$ through sal t giant formation $(6{-}5\,\mathrm{{Ma})}$ to the establishment of an exchange configuration similar to today (5– 4 Ma). The sediments on either side of the gateway region, which are preserved both onshore an d offshore, record the changing nature of Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange, allowing quantitativ e evaluation of its role in global-scale climate systems, impact on major climatic events, and influence over extreme environmental change in the Mediterranean. Two of IMMAGE’s scientifi c objectives are therefore paleoclimatic. In addition, a Late Miocene drilling target focused on th e gateway also provides an unparalleled opportunity to test physical oceanographic representation s of extreme high-density overflow dynamics that do not exist in the world today on this scale. IMMAGE’s third objective is therefore testing a physical oceanography hypothesis.  

# 4.1. Objective 1: to document the time at which the Atlantic first started to receive a distinct overflow from the Mediterranean and to evaluate quantitatively its role in Late Miocene global climate and regional environmental change  

Today, dense water $(13^{\circ}\mathrm{C},\,37~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{kg};$ Price et al., 1993) pools on the floor of the Mediterranea n behind a shallow $\left(300\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , narrow $\left(15\,\mathrm{km}\right)$ sill, the Gibraltar Strait. Mediterranean waters overspil l the sill and cascade down the continental slope. The density contrast between Mediterranean an d ambient Atlantic water generates substantial current speed, leading to extensive contouritic drift s (Hernández-Molina et al., 2016). Recent fieldwork in Morocco has revealed that the Rifian Corridor in northern Morocco contains Upper Miocene contouritic sediments (Capella et al., 2017) tha t resemble the Pliocene–Pleistocene contourites in the Gulf of Cádiz (Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Expedition 339; Expedition 339 Scientists, 2013).  

The presence of $7.8{-}6.3\ \mathrm{Ma}$ contourites in Morocco (Capella et al., 2017) indicates that an overspill geometry had already formed in the Late Miocene, ${\sim}2$ My before the MSC, allowing a densit y contrast between the Mediterranean and Atlantic to develop and feeding saline Mediterranea n water into the North Atlantic (Capella et al., 2017, 2019). The outstanding question is whethe r these exposed Rifian contourites are the first products of MO or whether older, buried contourite s exist in either the Rifian and/or Betic Corridors (Figures F2, F3).  

One possibility is that initiation of MO contributed to the cooling that ultimately triggered th e formation of permanent Northern Hemisphere ice by altering the North Atlantic density structur e and increasing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ drawdown through the entrainment of Atlantic surface water and its dissolve d $C O_{2}$ in the dense AMW plume (Capella et al., 2019). Correlation with similarly high-resolutio n sites in the North Atlantic will be required to test this mechanism and assess its importance i n modulating NADW formation.  

Hypotheses that will be tested as part of this scientific objective include the following:  

• Hypothesis 1.1: the earliest contourites formed as a result of Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange and correlate with the onset of Late Miocene sea surface temperature (SST) decline in the mid- and high latitudes. Dating the first Atlantic–Mediterranean contourites will test this hypothesis.   
• Hypothesis 1.2: atmospheric $C O_{2}$ sequestration in the deeper ocean through the initiation and development of AMW can account for the degree and distribution of SST cooling observed. Reconstructing the velocity, density, and flux of AMW through time, quantifying its impact on $C O_{2}$ advection (Capella et al., 2019), and then modeling the resulting SST distribution (e.g., Ivanovic et al., 2014a) tests this hypothesis.   
• Hypothesis 1.3: AMW modulates NADW formation, triggers glacial inception, and influences continental-scale aridification. Model-based testing of this hypothesis requires the correlation of IMMAGE records with existing high-resolution records globally.  

# 4.2. Objective 2: to recover a complete record of Atlantic– Mediterranean exchange before, during, and after the Messinian Salinity Crisis and to evaluate the causes and consequences of this extreme oceanographic event locally, regionally and globally  

Today, Mediterranean seawater flows through the Gibraltar Strait forming a saline plume a t intermediate depths in the Atlantic (Figure F2; Iorga and Lozier, 1999). The plume’s recor d of Pliocene–Quaternary contouritic sediments was recovered from the Gulf of Cádiz (Expeditio n 339) and documents a Mediterranean contribution to Atlantic thermohaline circulation since th e Pliocene (Hernández-Molina et al., 2014b; van der Schee et al., 2016; Garcia-Gallardo et al., $2017\mathbf{a}$ , 2017b). However, there was also a Late Miocene episode of Mediterranean influence on the Atlantic (Capella et al., 2017, 2019), although the conduit for Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange i s unclear because Gibraltar may have already been open alongside marine corridors in norther n Morocco and southern Spain (Figure F3) (Flecker et al., 2015; Martín et al., 2009; Krijgsman et al., 2018), and the Alborán Basin may have been an intermediate system separated from the Mediterranean by the Alborán volcanic arc (Booth-Rea et al., 2018). The sedimentary expression o f restriction and closure of these Miocene connections in the Mediterranean comprises both thic k evaporites (e.g., Roveri et al., 2014) and brackish “Lago Mare” sediments (Iaccarino and Bossio, 1999; Orszag-Sperber, 2006; Rouchy et al., 2007; Guerra-Merchán et al., 2010). Understanding th e causes of high-amplitude salinity change in the Mediterranean and its global consequence s depends on recovering a complete record of Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange before, during, and after the MSC. Hypotheses that will be tested as part of this scientific objective include th e following:  

• Hypothesis 2.1: the Alborán Basin was an intermediate marine system influenced by the Atlantic and separated from the Mediterranean by the Alborán volcanic arc during the MSC. • Hypothesis 2.2: extreme environmental fluctuations in the Mediterranean had negligible impact on AMW.  

# 4.3. Objective 3: to test our quantitative understanding of the behavior of ocean overflow plumes during the most extreme exchange in Earth’s history  

There are ${\sim}20$ major ocean-scale overflow systems in the world today (Legg et al., 2009), includin g some of the most important and sensitive oceanic transport systems (e.g., Denmark Strait an d Weddell Sea). All of these systems are driven by source water density anomalies upstream of th e overflow (Price and O’Neill Baringer, 1994). However, the range of source water density today i s rather small; $27.7\,\upsigma$ units (Red Sea) to $28.95\;\upsigma$ units (Mediterranean Sea). In comparison, the density of Mediterranean water during gypsum and halite deposition would have been enormous (11 0 and ${\sim}300\ \sigma$ units, respectively). This presents an opportunity and a challenge for existing representations of oceanographic overflow physics (e.g., Legg et al., 2009) because we can test hypotheses derived from physical theory through scientific drilling. This is the first experiment of its typ e that we are aware of and is ground-breaking in the field of quantitative paleoceanography. Th e application of physical theory to the paleoceanography of MO is well established (Rogerson et al., 2012a) and suggests the following hypotheses:  

• Hypothesis 3.1: the velocity of the plume is a function of the Atlantic–Mediterranean density contrast, limitation on flow through the strait (Bryden et al., 1994), the gradient of the slope, and the degree of mixing (Price et al., 1993).   
• Hypothesis 3.2: mixing with ambient water causes a strong negative feedback on the size of the plume, limiting the degree of its variability (Price et al., 1993). This means that only minor changes in the physical size of the plume are expected, despite the proportion of plume water derived directly from the outflow varying significantly. As a result, changes in Mediterranean density have little impact on the plume position.   
• Hypothesis 3.3: the main control on the settling depth of MO is the vertical density gradient in the North Atlantic, which is a product of North Atlantic overturning circulation (Rogerson et al., 2012a).  

# 5. Connections to the 2050 Science Framework  

Using  the  newly  obtained  Expedition  401  cores,  we  can  now  describe  the  changes  i n Mediterranean–Atlantic water exchange through geologic time and understand the mechanism s governing those changes and their downstream effects on the Earth’s climate system. This wil l allow us to address the following strategic objectives and initiatives from the 2050 Framework fo r scientific ocean drilling:  

# 5.1. Strategic objectives  

• Earth’s climate system: opening and closure of oceanic gateways is recognized as having a profound impact on Earth’s climate, changing the distribution of heat and salt in the world’s oceans. Dense salty water from the Mediterranean contributes to global thermohaline circulation, NADW formation, and associated carbon drawdown. • Tipping points in Earth’s history: flooding of the Mediterranean basin at the end of the Miocene is one of the most vivid examples of a tipping point in Earth’s history. However, the history of water flow through this gateway remains to be described in detail, and it has consequences not just for the Mediterranean but also for the global ocean. • Global cycles of energy and matter: the Mediterranean–Atlantic gateway has a controlling influence on the distribution of salt, heat, and nutrients in the ocean.  

# 5.2. Flagship initiatives  

• Groundtruthing future climate change: sediment cores from this expedition covered the last ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ of Earth’s climate, including analogs for future warm climates under $C O_{2}$ levels up to ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{\,ppm}$ . In particular, the combination of gateway and climate history recorded in the cores will help us understand global climate from 5 to $8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , a relatively understudied interval compared to the last 5 My.  

# 5.3. Enabling elements  

• Broader impacts and outreach: during the expedition, we reached a broad audience to communicate the expedition’s science and real-time progress (see Outreach). Because of the unusually long duration of this Land-2-Sea drilling project, we have an opportunity to develop a more ambitious outreach endeavor than is typical and will be targeting, in particular, communities that do not normally engage with scientific narratives.   
• Land to sea: this IODP expedition is the first element of the first ever Land-2-Sea drilling project. The onshore ICDP drilling will happen in the years following Expedition 401 at sites in southern Spain and northern Morocco. Integrated results from both the land and sea drilling are necessary to fully understand Late Miocene gateway history and deliver IMMAGE’s scientific objectives. Expedition 401 scientific results provide the foundation and momentum on which the two ICDP projects will build.  

# 6. Site summaries  

During Expedition 401, core was recovered from 7 holes at 4 different sites (Figures F4, F5). A t Sites U1385 and U1609, where two holes were cored at each site and the physical properties dat a showed regular cyclic patterns, splices have been constructed.

Original strategy for these deep holes was to wash down through Pliocene, which had been extensively recovered previously, and core from just above 4.5 Ma bioevent down to target depth of 8 Ma. Logging at each site was planned but proved difficult or impossible to implement fully. However, recovery was excellen t and there was time to drill a second hole at three of the four sites.

# 6.1. Site U1609  

# 6.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1609 $(37^{\circ}22.6159^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , $9^{\circ}35.9119^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; proposed site ALM-03B) is located at 1659.5 meter s below sea level (mbsl) on the continental slope of the Portuguese margin (Figures F6, F7; Tabl e T1). The primary scientific objective of Site U1609 was to recover a distal record of the Lat e Miocene–Pliocene MO plume (Figure F2). The aim was to capture the evolution of the plume’ s equilibrium depth through time, from the earliest evidence of overflow through the Rifian Corridor in present-day Morocco, through the Mediterranean’s MSC (5.97–5.33 Ma), to the Earl y Pliocene $(\sim\!4\mathrm{\Ma})$ . This interval of major gateway and Mediterranean environmental change i s likely to have substantially influenced both the density and the chemistry of the overflow on subprecessional to million-year timescales.  

Site U1609 is $17~\mathrm{km}$ west and downslope from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1391, drilled during Expedition 339, which comprised Pliocene–Quaternary muddy contourites wit h interbedded sands, hemipelagites, and several layers of mass movement deposits. On the seismi c profile linking Site U1391 with Site U1609, packages of the contouritic drift migrate landward wit h time. Site U1609 took advantage of this landward migration and surface erosion, which is als o visible in the seismic profiles, to access the target Miocene–Pliocene strata at relatively shallo w depths. The seismic data also suggest that the Late Miocene succession at Site U1609 is more likel y to provide a more complete record of the MO plume than Site U1610 (proposed Site GUB-02A) i n the Gulf of Cádiz, which is closer to the source of the plume.

Site U1609’s distal location was selected to recover a less clastic, more hemipelagic successio n suitable for high-resolution astrochronological tuning and a strong age framework for subprecessional investigation of the driving mechanisms causing changes in the plume. This record of th e Miocene MO plume also provides an important constraint on the upper part of the northeas t Atlantic water mass structure in the Late Miocene (Figure F2). This record will be correlated wit h a deeper water site to the north, Site U1385 (drilled during Expedition 401), and the Miocene successions recovered along the IODP Expedition 397 depth transect.  

In combination with other Expedition 401 Atlantic sites, the record from Site U1609 also allow s the investigation of more specific objectives including the following:  

• To establish the age of the earliest contourites formed as a result of MO. • To evaluate the impact of extreme environmental fluctuations in the Mediterranean on its overflow plume and the structure of the Atlantic water masses (Figure F2). • To provide quantitative constraints on the mixing behavior of dense overflows by reconstructing the strength and attenuation rate of the Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange signal beyond the gateway.  

# 6.1.2. Operations  

Site U1609 consists of two holes and $983.0\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment collected over a $1046.1\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interva l (Figures F4, F5). Hole U1609A penetrated $610.0\;\mathrm{m}$ with a sedimentary recovered length of 572. 4

m ( $93\%$ recovery). Hole U1609B cored $436.1\;\mathrm{m}$ with a sedimentary recovered length of $410.8\textrm{m}$ $94\%$ recovery).  

# 6.1.2.1. Hole U1609A  

The ship arrived at Site U1609 at $1655~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 December 2023 after completing the $1220\ \mathrm{nmi}$ voyage from Amsterdam (Netherlands) in 4.5 days. All thrusters were down and secure at $1712\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the ship switched to full auto dynamic positioning (DP) mode at $^{1720\,\mathrm{h}}$ , marking the start o f operations at Site U1609. Operations started on the rig floor assembling the bottom-hole assembl y (BHA). We used a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) drill bit for Hole U1609A, and for th e extended core barrel (XCB) cores we used a PDC cutting shoe. This combination had been foun d during recent IODP expeditions, including during Expedition 397 in the same area, to yield ver y good recovery of XCB cores.  

At $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December after one missed mudline, we were successful in starting Hole U1609 A $(37^{\circ}22.6259^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $9^{\circ}35.9120^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ), with the seafloor calculated at 1659.5 mbsl based on the core recovery and mudline depth in Core 1H. Cores 1H–25H penetrated from the seafloor to 224.7 meter s below seafloor (mbsf) and recovered $224.7\mathrm{~m~}(85\%)$ . Advanced piston corer temperature (APCT3) tool measurements were made during Cores 4H, 7H, $10\mathrm{H}$ , and 13H, and all measurement s recorded smooth $10\ \mathrm{min}$ long temperature equilibration curves. At $0300~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 December, w e switched to the half-length advanced piston corer (HLAPC). Cores 26F–37F penetrated fro m 224.7 to 269.7 mbsf and recovered $45\textrm{m}$ $(102\%)$ . At $1430~\mathrm{h}$ at 269.7 mbsf, we changed to XC B coring. Cores 38X–73X penetrated from 269.7 to 610.0 mbsf and recovered $340.3~\mathrm{m}$ $(99\%)$ . Ove r the course of the hole, the driller pumped eight 30 bbl sepiolite mud sweeps from 274.7 to 571. 0 mbsf.  

After confirming that early Tortonian sediments had been reached and thus that we had recovere d the Messinian to late Tortonian target succession, we stopped coring. The last core, 73X, reache d 610.0 mbsf and came on deck at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 December.  

We prepared the hole for downhole logging by sweeping it with $30\,\mathrm{bbl}$ of sepiolite mud to flush ou t any loose sediment, displacing it with 230 bbl of barite-weighted mud to stabilize the borehol e walls, and setting the end of the pipe to 56.4 mbsf. The triple combo downhole logging tool strin g was assembled by $0130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 December, but before it could be run down the pipe, the wirelin e heave compensator control computer was found to be unresponsive. After troubleshooting diagnosed a probable hard drive failure, we decided to log without heave compensation. Ship heav e was around $2.5\;\mathrm{m}$ throughout the day—higher than desirable but not atypical for logging from th e ship. The triple combo logged borehole physical properties data down to within $5\,\mathrm{m}$ of the botto m of the hole. The second tool string, the Versatile Seismic Imager, also reached close to the botto m of the hole for the check shot survey. Concurrently, we observed for protected marine species; none were observed. Only two of the 13 check shot stations gave reliable first-arrival time s because most of the borehole was too wide to achieve good coupling. Fortunately, those two stations were in the lower part of the hole where the data are most useful for tying borehole depth t o the seismic profiles. Because of the wide borehole and the lack of heave compensation, we decide d not to run the Formation MicroScanner tool and instead to run a sonic velocity and natura l gamma radiation (NGR) tool string as the third and final logging run. This tool string also reache d close to the base of the hole. The logging equipment was rigged down by $2230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 December. We raised the pipe, and the bit cleared the seafloor at $2235\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , ending Hole U1609A.  

# 6.1.2.2. Hole U1609B  

The ship was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1609A along the slope, and at $0305\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 December w e started Hole U1609B $(37^{\circ}22.6159^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $9^{\circ}35.9119^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) by drilling down without recovery. The pla n was to drill down without coring to spend more time coring the Early Pliocene to Late Miocen e target interval; however, in these clay-rich sediments, drilling was no faster than taking cores. A t $0930\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{m}}$ , we retrieved the center bit and started taking advanced piston corer (APC) cores at 72. 6 mbsf. Cores 2H–4H penetrated from 72.6 to 101.4 mbsf and recovered $28.5\mathrm{~m~}(95\%)$ , but afte r Core 4H had partial recovery and required 20,000 lb overpull to retrieve, we switched to corin g with the HLAPC coring system at 101.1 mbsf. Cores 5F–32F penetrated from 101.4 to 234.1 mbs f and recovered $133.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(101\%)$ . We ran the Sediment Temperature 2 (SET2) tool after Core 32F a t  

234.1 mbsf to measure formation temperature deeper than had been possible with the APCT- 3 tool in Hole U1609A.  

At $1630~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 December, we switched to the XCB coring system. At $1600~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 December, after taking Core 48X at $389.3\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ we ran the SET2 tool a second time. XCB coring proceede d until cores reached the age of $8.4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , old enough to cover the main events in the history of th e Mediterranean–Atlantic gateways. Cores 33X–61X penetrated from 234.1 to 508.7 mbsf an d recovered $264.9\:\mathrm{m}\;(91\%)$ . At $1700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 December, we set back the top drive and started to pul l up the drill pipe. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1905\,\mathrm{h},$ , and the BHA was on deck by $2345\,\mathrm{h}$ . Th e thrusters were raised, and we started the transit to Site U1610 at $2354\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Site U1609.  

Overall, we spent 10.2 days at Site U1609, about two days shorter than in the original operation s plan because the age targets were shallower than anticipated. For this reason, we were also able t o recover two cored records of the target interval rather than the single core record that originall y had been planned in the expedition Scientific Prospectus (Flecker et al., 2023).  

# 6.1.3. Principal results  

# 6.1.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Three main lithologies are described at Site U1609: calcareous mud, calcareous silty mud, an d clayey calcareous ooze. Minor coarser grained deposits (e.g., calcareous silt, sandy silt, and calcareous sand) are also observed. On the basis of subtle lithologic changes, Holes U1609A and U1609 B are divided into four lithostratigraphic units (Figure F8). Contacts between these units and th e lithologies within them are mainly gradational, characterized by subtle changes in color and grai n size (Figure F9). Only the coarser silts and sandier beds are characterized by sharp to erosive basa l contacts. In Hole U1609A, Unit I ranges 0–344 mbsf and is characterized by alternating calcareous mud and calcareous silty mud. Unit II ranges 344–457 mbsf and consists of alternating calcareous mud and clayey calcareous ooze. Unit III ranges 457.7–531.5 mbsf and contains triplets o f calcareous mud of two different shades (lighter/darker) and clayey calcareous ooze, repeating on  a meter scale. Unit IV ranges 531.5–609.3 mbsf and contains two distinct types of calcareous mud s and clayey calcareous ooze, with brown calcareous muds as the dominant lithology. In this unit, bed thickness is usually $<\!1\;\mathrm{m}$ and the beds occur rhythmically. Coarser sandy and silty deposits a t ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{cm}$ scale are observed primarily in Units II and III.  

The sedimentary facies and facies associations identified at Site U1609 can be mainly attributed t o hemipelagic and bottom current processes. This site recovered part of the Sines drift (middleslope plastered drift) during deposition of Unit I (Pliocene and late Messinian). Beneath this, a fe w early Messinian and the Tortonian turbidite deposits are intercalated (Units II–IV). These coincide with regional tectonic events (Suarez et al., 1989; Riaza and Martines del Olmo, 1996; Sierr o et al., 1996; Maldonado et al., 1999; Ledesma, 2000; Martinez del Olmo and Martín, 2016), bu t relative sea level falls may also have triggered gravity flows during this time interval.  

The regular cyclicity visible in both the sedimentary facies and the physical properties data may b e explained by local precessional climatic fluctuations as well as bottom current variability. Botto m currents during deposition of Unit I were weak but vigorous enough at intermediate depths t o develop a plastered drift along the middle continental slope. On the longer timescale, the Tortonian to Pliocene shallowing identified from trace fossil assemblages may be related to long-ter m sea level regression (landward) and later progradation (basinward) of the margin (Riaza an d Martinez del Olmo, 1996; Sierro et al., 1996; Maldonado et al., 1999; Ledesma, 2000; Martinez de l Olmo and Martín, 2016).  

# 6.1.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

The sedimentary record recovered at Site U1609 is mostly continuous, although minor discontinuities cannot be totally excluded based on the low resolution of the biostratigraphic sampling o n board. Preservation of microfossils is generally good with abundant calcareous nannofossils an d planktonic foraminifers; benthic foraminifers are rare.  

Based on the calcareous nannoplankton assemblage, the top of the sequence recovered in Hol e U1609A is estimated to be ${>}1.24\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , indicating that a significant proportion of the Pleistocen e sequence has been eroded at this location. A continuous series of calcareous nannoplankton an d planktonic foraminiferal events were recorded in this site spanning from the Calabrian to the earliest Tortonian (Figure F8). Some of the calcareous nannofossil bioevents, specifically the highes t occurrence (HO) events, may have been affected by reworking and redeposition. However, th e ages derived from both the nannofossils and the foraminifers suggest that this is not a major issue. Sedimentation rates combined with the oldest bioevent, suggest an age close to the Tortonian/ Serravallian boundary for the base of Hole U1609A.  

During the Pliocene, bioevent-derived sedimentation rates range $37{-}90~\mathrm{m/My};$ , which is in lin e with those estimated from the paleomagnetic records. Miocene successions have lower sedimentation rates $(39{-}71\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My})$ .

# 6.1.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigation of cores from Holes U1609A and U1609B focused on demagnetization of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archive-half core sections and discrete samples of the working-half core sections. The Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool was used to orien t the uppermost 24 cores in the APC section of Hole U1609A. The NRM intensity is very weak, ranging from about $1.4\times10^{-5}$ to $4.0\times10^{-1}\,\mathrm{A/m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , with an average of $2.5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ .  

In Hole U1609A, NRM removed by $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ alternating field (AF) demagnetization is likely relate d to an overprint caused by core drilling. Inclination values after $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization roughl y show polarity reversals, but with a lot of values scattered between expected normal and reverse d values, and with very few of the reversed values reaching the expected geomagnetic axial dipol e inclination at the site $(56.8^{\circ})$ . The weak magnetization and scattered directions may be due to dissolution of most of the original magnetic minerals and precipitation of authigenic iron sulfides. However, after running a $^{1\,}\mathbf{m}$ smoothing window on the inclination values, normal and reverse d polarity intervals can be tentatively recognized and, constrained by the biostratigraphic framework, correlated to the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) from about 1.2 to $8.7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# 6.1.3.4. Geochemistry  

Salinity, $\mathsf{p H}$ , alkalinity, concentrations of major anions and cations, ammonium, phosphate, an d trace elements were measured on 66 interstitial water (IW) samples and a mudline (bottom water ) sample from Hole U1609A. IW was extracted by squeezing a $5{-}7\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole-round sample, and th e squeeze cake residues were then sampled for sedimentary geochemistry. One IW sample was collected in every APC and XCB core (Cores 401-U1609A-1H through 25H and 38X–73X) and on e in every other HLAPC core (Cores 28F–36F). Alkalinity increased from $2.4\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the mudline t o $>\!15\,\mathrm{\mM}$ between 44.8 and 256.1 mbsf, driven primarily by sulfate reduction, and $\mathsf{p H}$ varie d between 7.4 and 7.8. Major ion concentrations, nutrient concentrations, and alkalinity reflect  a variety of subsurface diagenetic processes including sulfate reduction, carbonate mineral precipitation and dissolution, organic matter remineralization, and water uptake into clay minerals. Th e sulfate–methane transition zone occurs around Core 6H at ${\sim}45$ mbsf.

Weight percent total inorganic carbon (TIC), sedimentary carbon (TC), and total nitrogen (TN ) were measured on the squeeze cake residues from the Hole U1609A IW sampling. Headspace ga s was also measured from a discrete sample taken at the top of the core section below each of the 6 6 IW samples. Methane and ethane were commonly detected, whereas ethene and propane wer e detected in trace amounts in $^{<10}$ samples. Methane concentrations ranged 0–42,000 parts pe r million by volume (ppmv), and ethane concentrations ranged 0–3.3 ppmv, with highest abundances between 100 and 300 mbsf. Calcium carbonate content $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\,\mathrm{wt}\%\right)$ was calculated fro m the TIC content, assuming that all inorganic carbon is present as calcium carbonate. Total organi c carbon (TOC) was determined as the difference between TC and TIC. Calcium carbonate varie d between 20 and $75~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , increasing toward the bottom of Hole U1609A, whereas TOC and T N remained low ( ${<}1\%$ and $<\!0.08\%$ , respectively) throughout.  

# 6.1.3.5. Physical properties and downhole measurements  

Analysis of physical properties data allowed us to define four units at Site U1609 with boundarie s at 344, 458, and 531 mbsf that correspond to the lithostratigraphic units defined in Site U160 9 Lithostratigraphy (Figure F8). In general, there is a correlation between magnetic susceptibilit y (MS), NGR, and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, all presenting a slight decrease fro m the top to the bottom of Unit I. The correlation is even better between NGR and MS. Unit II show s an increasing trend for both NGR and GRA toward the bottom of the unit (458 mbsf). Unit II I contains several coarser sandy layers and is followed by greater variations on physical propertie s that present a global decreasing trend toward the bottom of the unit (531 mbsf). Unit IV represents a decrease in all the measured physical properties. This is reflected in the sedimentologi c data by the transition to a less siliciclastic sequence of clayey calcareous oozes and calcareou s muds. Generally, variations in physical properties are associated with color changes in visual cor e descriptions and in the red-green-blue (RGB) and reflectance data. This suggests that colo r changes are associated with changes in grain size and mineralogical composition.  

Logging data from the downhole logging operations in Hole U1609A were processed at LamontDoherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University (USA). The sonic velocity logs and check sho t interval velocity values reached $2.25\ \mathrm{km/s}$ at the base of the logging interval, 578 mbsf. These i n situ velocity data enabled the Hole U1609A stratigraphy to be more accurately tied to the seismi c stratigraphy. Based on downhole temperature measurements (see Site U1609 Operations), th e seafloor temperature is $6.9\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ .  

# 6.2. Site U1610  

# 6.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1610 (proposed Site GUB-02A) is the closest of the expedition’s Atlantic sites to the Gibraltar Strait and by extension to the Mediterranean–Atlantic gateway during the Late Miocene (Figures F1, F10). It is located at 556.3 mbsl in the Gulf of Cádiz $\left(36^{\circ}41.9812^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{:}\right.$ , $7^{\circ}25.8844^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ; Tabl e T1). The aim of drilling at Site U1610 was to provide a proximal record for the proximal–dista l transect along the path of the MO plume during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene (Figure F2).  

There is considerable uncertainty about the Late Miocene timing of opening and closure of th e three different Mediterranean–Atlantic gateways (the Betic corridor through southern Spain, th e Gibraltar Strait, and the Rifian corridor through Morocco; Figure F3; Krijgsman et al., 2018), an d establishing this history is one of the main objectives of the expedition. Site U1610 was positione d in a location that would capture a record of the MO plume, whichever possible gateway it wa s coming from, throughout the ${8-4\,M{\bf a}}$ interval of interest. The Miocene target interval also neede d to be sufficiently shallowly buried $({<}1700\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ and in deep enough water to be accessible to th e R/V JOIDES Resolution drilling capability. However, the Pliocene–Pleistocene succession in th e Gulf of Cádiz derives both from more recent MO and substantial clastic deposition from mainlan d Spain and Portugal, so in many places this Miocene–Pliocene interval of interest is too deeply buried. Additionally, all potential IODP sites need to be in locations where hydrocarbon accumulations are demonstrably absent, which was challenging for the Gulf of Cádiz. Within thes e constraints, there was little choice about the location of Site U1610, and even then the target dept h of 1460 mbsf was very deep for IODP drilling (Figures F4, F11).  

The two-way traveltime (TWT) to depth conversion used for the Pliocene–Pleistocene successio n at Site U1610 was derived from adjacent Expedition 339 Sites U1386 and U1387 (Expedition 33 9 Scientists, 2013), which lie ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{km}$ to the northwest. This indicated that the Pliocene–Pleistocen e succession at Site U1610 was ${\sim}750\;\mathrm{m}$ thick. Our drilling strategy was to drill ahead without corin g the Pleistocene and the top of the Pliocene, casing the hole to 550 mbsf, to increase the chances o f recovering the target interval.  

Site U1610 is located in the Deep Algarve Basin of the Gulf of Cádiz $\mathrm{Ng}$ et al., 2022). Based o n regional correlations to Expedition 339 sites and industry wells, the Late Miocene seismic stratigraphic sequence at the site location was divided into four distinct stages, charting the progradation of a submarine fan (channel/levee/lobes system) influenced by bottom currents. The seismi c packages transition upward from distal submarine lobes (a low-amplitude reflection unit below  2 s TWT) to more proximal, coarser grained (higher amplitude) submarine lobes, overlain by  a transparent unit (Messinian Transparent Unit [MTU]) thought to reflect hemipelagic deposition, and then a Pliocene–Pleistocene MO-derived contouritic drift.

Expedition 339 drilled the top of the MTU at Site U1387 and recovered hemipelagic sediment s (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2013). Beneath this we anticipated a migrating channel fill succession, below which is an unconformity and a succession of dipping bright reflectors $\mathrm{Ng}$ et al., 2022). Beneath this is a package of parallel-bedded, lower amplitude reflectors that is thought to be o f Tortonian age. At around 2.1 s TWT is a wedge-shaped unit that is interpreted to be the toe of  a seismic unit with irregular internal reflections that thickens to the southeast and is thought to b e an olistostrome, equivalent to the olistostrome seen in outcrop in southern Spain. The $8\,\mathrm{Ma}$ targe t age was anticipated to lie just below this chaotic interval.  

# 6.2.2. Operations  

Site U1610 consists of one hole, U1610A, and $751.2\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was collected from over a 933. 5 m cored interval ( $81\%$ recovery). The upper $501.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hole was cased to prevent caving an d make it easier to flush cuttings out of the borehole (Figure F4), with the aim of increasing th e chances of coring and logging successfully to the target depth of 1460 mbsf. The Pleistocene an d Late Pliocene stratigraphy, which was not recovered in the top $501\,\textrm{m}$ at Site U1610, is alread y known from nearby Expedition 339 Site U1387, located ${\sim}27\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest.  

# 6.2.2.1. Hole U1610A  

The ship completed the 122 nmi voyage to Site U1610 at a speed of $11.5\;\mathrm{kt}.$ , arriving at $1010\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 28 December 2023. The hydraulic release tool (HRT) and casing was prepared, consisting of th e HRT assembly, HRT base, and $498~\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing. The rig team then made up the BHA, including the bit, underreamer bit, and mud motor. The BHA and drill pipe were lowered dow n through the casing until the bit and underreamer extended below the casing by $3\textrm{m}$ . The HR T running tool was attached to the casing, and the funnel was welded on; then, the entire casin g system was lowered down through the moonpool and the ship was positioned over the hole coordinates.  

Hole U1610A started at $1200~\mathrm{h}$ when the seafloor was tagged at $561.7~\mathrm{mbsl}$ . The funnel’s bas e landed on the seafloor with the casing shoe at 501.9 mbsf. After the casing was released, the bi t was raised, clearing the seafloor at $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 December and clearing the rotary table at $0302\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 December, completing casing operations.  

We elected to start coring in Hole U1610A with the XCB coring system because it had recovere d good quality cores at equivalent depths in Hole U1609A. The nonmagnetic drill collar was left ou t of the assembly to improve the robustness of the BHA, and a lockable float valve was included fo r potential downhole logging.  

Hole U1610A was reentered at $0940\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 December, and during this process the depth to th e seafloor was found to be $556.3\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , identical to the precision depth recorder (PDR) reading bu t shallower than the previous estimate of 561.7 mbsl. The bit was lowered to the base of the hole, 505.2 mbsf, and the first science activity at the site was to run the SET2 tool. At $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ , we starte d coring Core 2X and continued into the new year.  

At $0340\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 January 2024, we started a more rigorous headspace gas sampling protocol for th e depth interval 754–960 mbsf at this site, following the recommendation by the IODP Environmental Protection and Safety Panel and Texas A&M University Safety Panel. Beginning with Cor e 27X at 747.7 mbsf, the headspace gas results from each core were analyzed before advancing th e bit to collect the next core. This protocol was in effect because a detailed preexpedition analysis o f 3D seismic data showed that there is a nonzero, but very low, risk of finding gas at the Site U161 0 location. Headspace gas results from all XCB cores were found to be in the normal (safe) range o f methane/ethane ratios and absolute methane values. Cores 2X–36X penetrated from 505.2 t o 827.8 mbsf and recovered $322.6\;\mathrm{m}\;(93\%)$ .  

At $0700~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 January, there was a failure in the top drive brake system, causing the brake t o engage and overheat. We stopped coring and pulled up Core 36X, which had advanced $3\textrm{m}$ . Th e bit was raised to $793.5~\mathrm{mbsf},$ the top drive was racked to allow repair, and the bit was raised t o 495.2 mbsf just inside the casing. The first interval of top drive inspections and repair ran fro m 0945 to $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ . The cause for the failure appeared to be the exhaust valve on the brake. A portio n of the diaphragm in the exhaust valve had broken off, lodged in the valve, and kept air pressure t o the energizing bladder behind the brake bands. This kept the brake engaged. There was significan t damage to the brake and bladder assembly from the resultant overheating, and the entire brak e assembly needed to be replaced with the spare unit from the warehouse.  

Meanwhile, we decided to change the coring system from XCB to rotary core barrel (RCB) for th e remainder of the hole. We raised the bit to the ship, clearing the seafloor at $1423\,\mathrm{h}$ and the rig floo r at $1630~\mathrm{h}$ . Repairs to the top drive continued and were complete by $0215~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 January. The ri g floor team then assembled the RCB BHA with a new $9\%$ inch PDC bit, and Hole U1610A wa s reentered at $0548~\mathrm{h}$ . Core 50R marked the end of the special headspace gas protocol, and result s were within the normal range for the interval where the enhanced gas safety protocol was in effect. The procedure resulted in a delay of ${\sim}45\ \mathrm{min}$ per core across 23 cores.  

Coring continued with very good recovery until Core 95R, which recovered just $15~\mathrm{cm}$ of har d dolostone rock pieces. Core 96R was empty, so we ran the bit deplugger to remove any potentia l obstructing rock lodged in the bit. Although the drilling rate indicated that we were drilling recoverable sediments and had passed below the hard lithified sediments that had been partly recovere d in Core 95R, no sediments were recovered; therefore, we stopped coring at $0515\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 Januar y with Core 100R. Cores 37R–100R penetrated from 827.8 to 1438.7 mbsf and recovered $610.9\mathrm{~m~}$ $(74\%)$ .  

We prepared for downhole logging by releasing the bit at the bottom of the hole, filling the hol e with 354.3 bbl of heavy $\left(10.5\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}\right)$ barite mud, and raising the pipe. When the end of the pip e reached 779.4 mbsf, the drill pipe became stuck. After an overpull of 60,000 lb would not free th e pipe, the circulating head was attached so that fluid could be pumped and the top drive was picke d up so that the pipe could be rotated. After several attempts, the pipe came free at $1215~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 1 January with 90,000 lb overpull and a pump pressure of 600 psi. The end of the pipe was set a t 516.6 mbsf for logging, $14.7~\mathrm{m}$ below the casing shoe.  

At $1415\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{{r}}}$ , we started to assemble the quad combo tool string, including NGR, density, resistivity, and sonic velocity tools. The tool string was lowered down the hole, passing out of the casing int o the open hole at $1640\,\mathrm{h}$ . At ${\sim}726$ mbsf, the tool string encountered an obstruction and after eigh t attempts, could not pass any further down the hole. This is the same depth interval at which th e drill pipe was stuck earlier in the day. However, useful log data were acquired from the ${\sim}208\mathrm{~m~}$ open hole logged interval.  

The inclinometer in the cable head of the quad combo logging tool string showed that Hol e U1610A was inclined between $13^{\circ}$ and $15^{\circ}$ from vertical in the logged interval. The hole had bee n suspected to deviate from vertical from observations of inclined beds in the cores.  

The downhole logging equipment was rigged down by $0045~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 January, and the pipe wa s raised, clearing the seafloor at $0130~\mathrm{h}$ and the rig floor at $0300~\mathrm{h}$ . The rig floor was secured fo r transit, we raised the thrusters at $0336\;\mathrm{h},$ , and we started the sea passage to Site U1385 at $0348\;\mathrm{h}$ , ending Site U1610.  

# 6.2.3. Principal results  

# 6.2.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Seven primary lithologies were described in Hole U1610A: calcareous clay, calcareous mud, calcareous silty mud, calcareous (sandy) silt(stone), calcareous (silty) sand(stone), clayey calcareou s ooze, and dolostone. Minor coarser grained lithologies were also observed. Based on these lithologic descriptions, Site U1610 is divided into five lithostratigraphic units (Figure F12). Contact s between lithologies are predominantly gradual, with subtle color and grain size changes; however, some contacts are sharp to erosive.  

Unit I ranges 505.2–699.4 mbsf and is composed of alternating calcareous mud and calcareou s silty mud, with minor coarser, sandy intervals. Unit II ranges 699.2–831.7 mbsf and consists o f calcareous mud and calcareous clay. Unit III ranges 837.5–934.8 mbsf and consists of interbedde d calcareous mud and clayey calcareous ooze to calcareous silty mud, with minor coarser, sand y intervals. Unit IV ranges 934.8–1388.8 mbsf and is divided into three subunits (Figure F12). Subunit IVa consists of alternating calcareous silty mud, calcareous sandy silt, calcareous mud, an d coarser grained sand and silty sand intervals (Figure F13), with minor clayey calcareous ooze t o calcareous clay (934.8–1112.7 mbsf). Subunit IVb consists of calcareous mud, calcareous silt y mud, calcareous sandy silt, and calcareous sand (very fine, fine, and medium), with some claye y calcareous ooze to calcareous clay, and minor lithified siltstone, sandstone (fine to medium), an d conglomerate (1112.7–1220.3 mbsf). Subunit IVc consists of alternating calcareous mud, calcareous silty mud, calcareous sandy silty, and coarser grained sand and silty sand intervals, with mino r clayey calcareous ooze to calcareous clay and calcareous clay (1220.3–1388.8 mbsf). Unit V range s 1388.6–1388.8 mbsf and consists entirely of dolostone. Cores 401-U1610A-96R through 100 R (1388.6–1438.7 mbsf) had $0\%$ recovered sediments and are not included in the unit definition.

Hole U1610A is located in the southern part of the Deep Algarve Sedimentary Basin, within th e Gulf of Cádiz. During deposition of Unit IV in the early to late Messinian (<6.9–7.1 Ma to aroun d $5.78\;\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ), there was an interplay of gravity processes, (contouritic) bottom currents, an d pelagic/hemipelagic deposition that determined the evolution of a mixed (turbidite-contourite ) depositional system, where turbiditic deposits were reworked by bottom currents. The botto m current processes are associated with an intermediate water mass flowing along the middle slop e of the margin. This mixed depositional system underwent a long-term evolution from Subunit IV c to IVa, with a wide spectrum of features and deposits formed under synchronous and asynchronous interactions of gravity and contouritic processes. Turbidite deposits have been described i n both the Guadalquivir Basin and the Deep Algarve Basin during the Messinian and are associate d with continental margin progradation, tectonic instability, and relative sea level variations.  

During deposition of Units III and II in the latest Messinian–Early Pliocene (5.78 to ${>}4.52\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ), a n important change in the depositional style with respect to Unit IV took place, with the development of hemipelagic deposits, and with very occasional, very fine grained turbidites not affecte d by bottom currents. This result agrees with the previous interpretation for the upper part of th e Messinian in the Gulf of Cádiz that proposed hemipelagic sedimentation during the late Messinian and no significant MOW influx during the earliest Pliocene (e.g., Llave et al., 2011; Expeditio n 339 Scientists, 2013; Hernández-Molina et al., 2016, van der Schee et al., 2016), but at Site U161 0 it appears that this change happened earlier than previously documented based on seismic dat a from the same area ( $\mathrm{Ng}$ et al., 2022). However, this hypothesis for the lack of bottom water curren t reworking and contourite deposition is contrary to other authors who consider a MOW influenc e since the Miocene/Pliocene boundary (e.g., Nelson et al., 1999).

During deposition of Unit I later in the Pliocene $(4.6{-}3.57\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ), bottom water current (contouritic ) and pelagic/hemipelagic sediments dominated the succession. Similar Pliocene sequence s observed elsewhere in the Gulf of Cádiz are considered to result mainly from MOW bottom currents (e.g., Nelson et al., 1999; Rodrigues et al., 2020).  

# 6.2.3.2. Biostratigraphy  

Based on the calcareous nannoplankton and foraminifer assemblage, an age between 3.61 and 3.5 7 Ma is estimated for the top of the recovered sequence (510.3 mbsf). Below this, a continuous serie s of calcareous nannoplankton and planktonic foraminifer events were recorded. The presence o f Globorotalia miotumida and Reticulofenestra rotaria at the bottom of the hole constrains the ag e to between 6.38 and ${\sim}7.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Figure F12). The Miocene/Pliocene boundary is placed at $\mathord{\sim}800$ mbsf (the Subunit IIb–IIc transition) based on the HO of Orthorhabdus rugosus. However, thi s bioevent is used with caution because of the scarcity of the specimen in the core catcher (CC ) sample analyzed. The subsequent highest common occurrence of Neogloboquadrina incompta (sinistral) recorded at ${\sim}939\;\mathrm{m}$ indicates a Messinian/Miocene age.  

During the Pliocene, sedimentation rates determined from biostratigraphy are on the order o f ${\sim}160~\mathrm{m/Ma}$ and were higher during the Miocene, reaching up to $240\ \mathrm{m/Ma}$ . The preservation o f microfossils is generally good with abundant calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers, but the concentration and preservation of planktonic foraminifers decreases with depth in th e Late Miocene samples. The benthic/planktonic ratio is indicative of intermediate water depth s during the Miocene and Pliocene.  

# 6.2.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetism measurements of NRM were performed on all the archive-half core section s from Hole U1610A on the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM). AF demagnetization wa s performed at 5, 10, 15, and $20\;\mathrm{mT}_{:}$ , with measurement of the remaining NRM being taken at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution after each step. A drilling overprint was mostly removed by $10\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization.  

In addition, NRM was measured on 134 cube samples on the AGICO JR-6A spinner magnetometer. The samples were then AF demagnetized. The NRM of discrete samples is significantly stronger than at Site U1609, with an average of $10\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . In general, steps of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and $60\;\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and in some cases up to $100\;\mathrm{mT}$ , were added to fully demagnetize the characteristi c magnetic component.  

Results from 501 to 540 mbsf clearly show normal inclinations in both SRM and JR-6A records. Between 540 and 1010 mbsf, reversed directions are dominant and many SRM inclination value s approach the expected antipodal geocentric axial dipole (GAD) inclination at the site $(57^{\circ})$ . Som e short $\left(<\!20\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ normal polarity depth intervals are present, but they are not clear, and only a fe w show successive inclinations with the expected GAD value. Normal polarities dominate from 101 0 to 1390 mbsf. Correlations to the GPTS are tentative, but the lack of reversals in the lower 1010– 1390 mbsf are consistent with the high sedimentation rates observed by biostratigraphy.  

We measured the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and bulk MS of all the discret e samples using the MFK2 KappaBridge instrument. Results show that all the $\kappa_{\mathrm{min}}$ axes have a tilt o f ${\sim}15^{\circ}{-}17^{\circ}$ deviating from the vertical. Because $\upkappa_{\mathrm{min}}$ is generally perpendicular to the sedimentar y bedding plane, this value indicates that drilling was not vertical but must have occurred with a n angle of $15^{\circ}{-17^{\circ}}$ and is consistent with the observation of inclined beds in the visual core descriptions and the logging data. In principle, we think it should be possible to reconstruct the strike o f the dipping borehole, provided the paleomagnetic signal is robust enough, which will allow AM S results to be interpreted in terms of current flow direction.  

# 6.2.3.4. Geochemistry  

In Hole U1610A, the safety protocol for drilling between 740 and 960 mbsf required the methan e concentration in headspace gases and methane/ethane ratios to be reported to the drilling tea m prior to advancing to drill the next core. In all headspace samples in this interval, the methan e concentrations remained $^{<12,000}$ ppmv (well below the 100,000 ppmv safety threshold), ethan e concentrations were ${<}12$ ppmv, and the minimum ratio of these two gases $(C_{1}/C_{2})$ was 406. Thes e low concentrations of methane and ethane and the dominance of methane (low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratio) presented no concerns for drilling safely as they indicate a microbial rather than petrogenic source. Methane and ethane were commonly detected, whereas ethene, propane, isobutane, and isopropane were detected in trace amounts.  

Void space was also sampled directly when gas pockets appeared in the core. In void spaces, th e absolute concentrations are not meaningful because they are essentially methane pockets (measured methane is close to $100\%$ ), but we found similar trace constituent composition to that measured with the standard interstitial headspace gas protocol. In void spaces, the $C_{1}/C_{2}$ rati o minimum was 1930, indicative of microbial rather than petrogenic sourcing.  

Two bottom water samples and 54 IW samples were collected from Hole U1610A for salinity, ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , and alkalinity measurements. One IW sample was collected from every core, except where recovery was limited ( $<\!3\,\mathrm{m}$ core) or poor quality (abundant fractures), in which case the IW sample wa s not taken. Approximately $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ of IW was extracted initially, which decreased to ${\sim}6\;\mathrm{mL}$ of wate r during RCB coring. Sampling continued until water yields decreased below ${\sim}1~\mathrm{mL}$ at Core 401- U1610A-61R. An additional IW sample was obtained from Core 72R with insufficient yield fo r most measurements. Alkalinity ranges $1.4–4.8\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}$ , pH varies between 7.5 and 8.0, and salinity i s 32–35 in IW samples. Major and trace elements in the IW samples were measured by ion chromatography (IC) and inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Th e bottom water samples each have an elevated salinity of 36, indicating we were sampling MOW.  

Overall, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ ranges $25.4–79.8~\mathrm{wt}\%$ , with a mean of $35.3~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and a standard deviation of 7. 3 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Standard reproducibility was $1.12\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\left(n=13\right)$ ). $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ is generally relatively invariant at Sit e U1610, with most samples falling within $28{-}40~\mathrm{wt\%}$ downcore. This included some selected fo r color variations, implying that color variations are driven by changes in components other tha n carbonates, likely the siliciclastic fraction.  

# 6.2.3.5. Physical properties and downhole measurements  

In the upper part of the cored interval, 510–685 mbsf, $\sim\!2\;\mathrm{m}$ scale cycles are evident in the MS an d NGR data (Figure F12) and they have higher amplitude in the underlying interval, 685–975 mbsf. The 975–1130 mbsf interval is characterized by a downhole increase in MS values by two orders o f magnitude and a decrease in NGR values. From 1130 to 1295 mbsf, MS and NGR return to lowe r values and lower amplitude variations, with longer wavelength changes and less-evident cyclicity. Below 1295 mbsf, shorter wavelength variability is again seen in the MS and NGR data sets.  

Downhole logging in Hole U1610A unfortunately did not reach deeper than 726 mbsf. Caliper log s show that the hole was alternately washed out to greater than 15 inches and closed in to narrowe r than the bit diameter. However, the $220\textrm{m}$ long open hole logged interval shows cyclic variatio n that can be used to cover stratigraphic gaps in Lithostratigraphic Unit I. The density log is strongl y affected by borehole conditions, but in narrower borehole intervals, the readings are probabl y valid and reach a maximum of $2.0\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Perhaps the most important logging result is quantifyin g that the hole is inclined from vertical by $13^{\circ}{-15^{\circ}}$ in the logged interval. Hole inclination will hav e to be considered in calculating bed thicknesses and depths to seismic reflectors because corin g depth along the borehole overestimates true vertical depth.  

The SET2 probe results gave a temperature of $24.8^{\circ}C$ at 505.2 mbsf. Using this result and the seafloor temperature of $12^{\circ}C$ (measured during the Conductivity-Temperature-Depth tool deployment), the geothermal gradient at the site is $25.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

# 6.3. Site U1385  

# 6.3.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1385 $(37^{\circ}34.2849^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $10^{\circ}7.5616^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ ) (Figures F6, F14) was first drilled during Expedition 33 9 to provide a marine reference section of Pleistocene millennial climate variability. Five holes wer e cored (Holes U1385A–U1385E) to a maximum penetration of 151.5 mbsf using the APC syste m (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2013). The record extends to $1.45\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Marine Isotope Stage 47) wit h an average sedimentation rate of $11\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ (Hodell et al., 2015).  

Site U1385 $37^{\circ}34.0128^{\prime}\mathrm{N};$ , $10^{\circ}7.6580^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) was reoccupied during Expedition 397 (2022) to deepe n the sequence to $400~\mathrm{{mbsf},}$ just above the Miocene/Pliocene boundary ( ${\sim}5.3\mathrm{\Ma}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; Hodell et al., 2023). Five more holes were cored (Holes U1385F–U1385J) ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ from the Expedition 33 9 location, using the APC system to about 110 mbsf and the XCB system beneath that depth (Tabl e T1). During Expedition 397, Site U1385 was part of a four site depth transect designed to captur e and reconstruct water mass changes during the Pliocene and Pleistocene (Hodell et al., 2023). Th e two deeper water sites, U1587 and U1586, also recovered Late Miocene successions. Results fro m Site U1385 demonstrate that the Iberian margin yields long, continuous records of millennia l Pliocene–Pleistocene climate variability permitting detailed land–sea comparisons (Hodell et al., 2023).  

Expedition 401 used the same site designation for this site, coring Holes U1385K and U1385L, an d we distinguish between the intervals recovered by the different expeditions by prefixing the expedition number to the site (i.e., 339-U1385, 397-U1385, and 401-U1385). Site 401-U1385 is locate d ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ from Site 397-U1385 at a water depth of $2590\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , placing it in the core of Lower Northeast Atlantic Deep Water (NEADW). Seismic data indicate the stratigraphy is continuous betwee n the locations.  

# 6.3.2. Objectives  

Extending this remarkable sediment archive back into the Late Miocene was one of the primar y goals of reoccupying Site U1385 during Expedition 401. Equivalent aged sediments recovered a t the deeper Site U1587 (Hodell et al., 2023) can be traced upslope on the seismic profile to Sit e U1385. These Late Miocene sediments at Site U1587 display well-developed precessional cyclicity. However, the poor carbonate preservation at this greater water depth $\left.3480\:\mathrm{m}\right.$ water depth) mean s that high-resolution carbonate-based proxy records cannot be generated (Hodell et al., 2023). Th e shallower water depth of Site U1385 ( $2590\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth) means it was likely to have bette r carbonate preservation, making these essential proxy records viable.

Site U1385 is Expedition 401’s deepest site. It is located on an elevated ridge, minimizing th e chances of disturbance by downslope transport (Figure F6). In combination with Site U1609 an d the two deeper water Expedition 397 sites, U1587 and U1586, the Late Miocene records from Sit e U1385 complete a Miocene depth transect equivalent to the Pliocene–Pleistocene transect generated by Expedition 397. The initial objective in the expedition’s scientific prospectus was t o recover the deeper part of the section at Site 397-U1385 up to a maximum depth of 873 mbsf. However, the late Tortonian to Messinian age interval of interest was likely not to require that ful l depth.  

The specific objectives of coring Site 401-U1385 are as follows:  

• To document the nature, amplitude, and pacing of climate cycles in the Atlantic before, during, and after the MSC and   
• To examine water mass variability during this time period characterized by extreme regional changes in oceanographic context.  

# 6.3.3. Operations  

Holes U1385K and U1385L were cored after drilling down to start coring a little shallower than th e 400 mbsf depth reached at this site during Expedition 397 (Figures F4, F14).  

# 6.3.3.1. Hole U1385K  

The $154\;\mathrm{nmi}$ voyage from Site U1610 to Site U1385 took $12.8\;\mathrm{{h}}$ at a speed of $12.0\,\mathrm{kt}$ . We lowere d the thrusters at $1622\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 12 January 2024, and switched to DP mode at $1652~\mathrm{h}$ . Site U1385 wa s cored to 151 mbsf during Expedition 339 in 2011 and to 400 mbsf during Expedition 397 in 2022. The APC/XCB BHA was assembled with a PDC bit and was lowered toward the seafloor, and  a pipe-cleaning “pig” was pumped down to clean the inside of the drill pipe. The ship was positione d $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole 397-U1385J.  

Hole U1385K was started at $0035~\mathrm{h}$ on 13 January and was drilled ahead, reaching 385.0 mbsf a t $1615\,\mathrm{h}$ . The center bit was retrieved, and we started coring. Cores 2X–6X returned nearly empty, so we ran the bit deplugger to ensure that the bottom of the BHA was free from loose sediment, which may have entered during the preceding drill down. Recovery improved in subsequent cores, and we continued coring until Core 21X at $1035\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 January, having reached the age target o f $^{8\mathrm{~Ma~}}$ . Cores 2X–21X penetrated from 385.0 to 552.5 mbsf and recovered $127.9\mathrm{~m~}$ $(76\%)$ . W e pulled up the pipe, clearing the seafloor at $1328\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 January and ending Hole U1385K.  

# 6.3.3.2. Hole U1385L  

The ship was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ north, and we started Hole U1385L at $1455\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 January 2024, drillin g ahead without coring to 376 mbsf. Coring began at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 January, and Cores 2X–8X penetrated from 376.0 to 443.9 mbsf, recovering $58.4\;\mathrm{m}\;(86\%)$ . We stopped coring at $1645\,\mathrm{h}$ because o f the high wind and wave conditions forecast for the evening and next day. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1835\,\mathrm{h}$ and was pulled up to a depth of $332\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ while the ship began waiting on weathe r (WOW). (After coring Hole U1385K, we had a choice between going directly to the next site o r staying to core Hole U1385L; we prioritized collecting core from Hole U1385L, knowing that i t would mean WOW the following day.)  

The ship began WOW at $2315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 January. At midmorning on 17 January, the average win d speed reached $35\,\mathrm{kt}$ , gusting to $65\,\mathrm{kt}$ , and then it eased throughout the day. After WOW for 28.2 5 h, we were able to resume operations at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 January. The BHA was raised, disassembled, and stowed. The thrusters were raised at $0720\,\mathrm{h},$ , and at $0736\,\mathrm{h}$ we started the transit to Site U161 1 (proposed Site WAB-03A), ending operations at Site U1385.  

# 6.3.4. Principal results  

# 6.3.4.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Four lithostratigraphic units are defined at Site U1385, and they are characterized by alternatin g light-colored (light greenish gray) and dark-colored (greenish gray and gray) beds composed o f clayey calcareous ooze and calcareous clay with lighter and darker shades and gradational an d sharp boundaries (Figures F15, F16). Minor lithologies include clay- and pyrite-rich intervals an d horizons exhibiting multiple hues, including shades of orange-brown and blue-green. Trace fossil s include Chondrites, Planolites, Thalassinoides, and Zoophycos, and rare Asterosoma, Palaeophycos, and Schaubcylindrichnus. Pyrite nodules and shell fragments are disseminated throughout. Sediments are initially interpreted to be deepwater hemipelagic deposits.  

Unit I extends from 385 to 430 mbsf in Cores 401-U1385K-2X and 7X–9X and from 376 to 430. 5 mbsf in Sections 401-U1385L-2X-1 to 7X-4, and comprises clayey calcareous ooze (light greenis h gray) and calcareous clay (greenish gray). Unit II extends from 436 to 458.5 mbsf in Sections 401- U1385K-10X-1 to 12X-2 and from 430.5 to 442.6 mbsf in Sections 401-U1385L-7X-5 to 8X-CC. Unit III extends from 458.5 to 519.6 mbsf in Sections 401-U1385K-12X-3 to 18X-4. Units II and II I contain clayey calcareous ooze (light greenish gray) and calcareous clay (variable greenish gra y and gray). Unit IV extends from 519.6 to 552.65 mbsf in Sections 401-U1385K-18X-5 to 21X-C C and is dominated by calcareous clay (variable greenish gray and gray) with minor clayey calcareou s ooze (light greenish gray).

Site U1385 is located on a plateau (Promontório dos Príncipes de Avis) below the water depth o f the present-day Mediterranean outflow plume. This area is protected from sedimentary inpu t from slope deposition or submarine canyons. The Miocene sediments recovered from Site U138 5 are dominated by pelagic clayey calcareous ooze and calcareous clay deposits, consistent with thi s setting. Precessional-scale variability in the Miocene and late Tortonian sediments recovered ma y have resulted from fluctuations in carbonate and/or siliciclastic input, generating pelagic deposit s with color-carbonate cycles. This may be driven either by local climatic variability or result fro m nepheloid layers higher in the water column (e.g., associated with MOW; Abrantes et al., 2000; Ambar et al., 2002; Magill et al., 2018) containing significant quantities of suspended sediment.

Future research will evaluate the influence of regional water masses on the dominant pelagic sedimentation at Site U1385. The interplay between NEADW and Antarctic Bottom Water (van Aken, 2000; Hernández-Molina et al., 2011; Glazkova et al., 2022) would have been particularly important during the latest Miocene when Atlantic intermediate and deepwater circulation evolved int o a pattern similar to the one observed today (Sykes et al., 1998; Billups, 2002; Nisancioglu et al., 2003; Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 2017; Hernández-Molina et al., 2017).  

# 6.3.4.2. Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous microfossils are typically abundant with moderate and good preservation, an d planktonic foraminifers are well preserved with evidence of fragmentation in only a few samples. The age of the succession is constrained by eight nannofossil events and four foraminifer events. The HO of O. rugosus $(5.23\mathrm{~Ma})$ and the lowest occurrence of Ceratolithus acutus $(5.36\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ar e recorded between Sections 401-U1385L-4X-CC and 5X-CC at ${\sim}409$ mbsf, constraining th e Messinian/Pliocene boundary to Core 5X (Figure F15). The oldest bioevent identified wa s the base of the paracme of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus $\left(8.8\,\mathrm{\Omega}\,{\cal M}\mathrm{{a}}\right)$ between Sections 401- U1385K-19X-CC and 20X-CC at ${\sim}517$ mbsf. CC samples were also analyzed for benthi c foraminifer content; the assemblage seems well preserved. Nannofossil smear slides from Sit e U1610 were reexamined for minerals and reworked coccoliths.  

# 6.3.4.3. Paleomagnetism  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements were performed using the SRM to investigate th e NRM on a total of 132 archive-half sections (91 sections from Hole U1385K and 41 sections fro m Hole U1385L). AF demagnetization was performed on the SRM by applying stepwise peak field s of 5, 10, 15, and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ , with measurement of the remaining magnetization taken at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolution. In addition, we collected and measured 117 discrete samples of the working-half sections, using 3–7 discrete samples from each core. First, the AMS and bulk MS were measured on al l samples using the MFK2 KappaBridge instrument. Next, the NRM of 61 cube samples, 47 sample s from Hole U1385K and 14 samples from Hole U1385L, was measured on the AGICO JR-6A spinner magnetometer. Stepwise AF demagnetization was performed at successive peak fields of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and $70\;\mathrm{mT}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , up to a maximum of $80~\mathrm{mT}$ for samples from Hole U1385 K and a maximum of $40~\mathrm{{mT}}$ for samples from Hole U1385L where the magnetic signal was weaker. When magnetization became erratic, demagnetization was stopped.  

Constrained by stratigraphic correlation to Hole 397-U1385J, the topmost core of Hole U1385L i s $<\!5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . We then correlated the reversal pattern in inclination values of SRM measurements afte r $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ and JR-6A measurements after $20\,\mathrm{mT}$ to the most recent GPTS. Based on this magnetostratigraphy, the base of Hole U1385K is slightly older than $8.2\,M{\bf a}$ , and the average sediment accumulation rate is ${\sim}5\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ for the Messinian part of the record.  

The AMS results of Holes U1385K and U1385L show an overall vertical direction of the $\kappa_{\mathrm{min}}$ axis, in agreement with a sedimentary fabric and a vertically drilled hole.  

# 6.3.4.4. Geochemistry  

For Hole U1385K, one headspace gas sample and IW sample were taken per core. Gas content i n Hole U1385K was within the safety range; only methane and ethane were detected, but no highe r hydrocarbons. IW samples from Hole U1385K were measured for salinity, $\mathsf{p H}$ , and alkalinity. Salinity remained invariant at 32 throughout the cored interval. IW major and trace elements wer e measured by IC and ICP-AES. Sediment samples were obtained from the IW squeeze cake residues in Hole U1385K and one sample per core from Hole U1385L to understand geochemica l variations. Sediment samples were dried, ground, and weighed to measure C, N, and $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ . Calcium carbonate abundance varies from 39 to $69\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ and correlates well with NGR, showin g that mixing of carbonate and siliciclastic fractions is controlling the observable cyclicity at thi s location. Carbonate geochemistry shows lithology-dependent variations and signs of carbonat e diagenesis.  

# 6.3.4.5. Physical properties and downhole measurements  

The full suite of physical properties measurements was made on cores and samples from Hole s U1385K and U1385L. Moisture and density measurements show a compaction trend with depth: bulk density increases from ${\sim}1.9~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ at 378 mbsf to $2.0~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ at 548 mbsf, and porosit y decreases from $50\%$ to $43\%$ over the same depth interval. NGR and MS records contain cycli c alternations on a meter to submeter scale throughout the cored interval (Figure F15), with relatively higher amplitude cycles from ${\sim}420$ to 505 mbsf. No downhole measurements were made a t Site U1385.  

# 6.4. Site U1611  

# 6.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1611 (proposed Site WAB-03A) is located inside the Mediterranean just to the east of th e Strait of Gibraltar, in the Alborán Sea (Figure F10). It marks the eastern end of Expedition 401’ s transect of sites that track MOW from its source, through the Atlantic–Mediterranean gatewa y into the Gulf of Cádiz (Site U1610), and around to the west of the Iberian margin (Sites U1609 an d U1385) (Figure F2). Today, the Alborán Basin is a relatively narrow ( $150\,\mathrm{km}$ wide, north to south), shallow (maximum depth of $1800\,\mathrm{\m})$ ), elongate $350~\mathrm{km}$ long, east to west) area that links th e deeper parts of the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic. Atlantic water flows into the Mediterranea n through the Gibraltar Strait at the surface as a coherent layer of warm and relatively fresh marin e water, while deeper cooler and more saline water generated in the Mediterranean flows throug h the Alborán Sea and out into the Atlantic at depth (Figures F17, F18). The stratified water mas s structure in the Alborán Sea reflects this exchange as well as the densities of the different wate r masses generated within the Mediterranean, principally the Levantine Intermediate Water an d Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW; Ercilla et al., 2016). Site U1611 is located on th e north side of the basin on the Spanish continental slope at a water depth of $810~\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F10). Today, this area is bathed in WMDW with a temperature of ${\sim}12.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and a salinity of ${\sim}38.45$ (Figure F19). It is directly impacted by westward flowing currents that produce contourite depositio n along the Spanish margin (Figure F17) as well as receiving the input of gravity deposits from upslope (Ercilla et al., 2016).  

Exchange through a single gateway at Gibraltar is a relatively recent (Pliocene–Pleistocene) phenomenon (Hernández-Molina et al., 2014a; van der Schee et al., 2016; García-Gallardo et al., 2017a; Flecker et al., 2015). As a result of Africa-Eurasia convergence, westward docking of th e Alborán plate, and simultaneous slab retreat (Jolivet and Faccenna, 2000; Faccenna et al., 2004; va n Hinsbergen et al., 2014), the Atlantic–Mediterranean connection evolved from a single, wide ope n seaway in the Tortonian (Figure F3) linking a Mediterranean that was more of an embayment o f the Atlantic than a distinct marginal marine system (Flecker et al., 2015) to two narrow corridor s

Martín et al., 2014).  

Ongoing restriction of the marine corridors permitted Mediterranean salinity to rise, and a distinct, dense water mass formed. Ultimately, the narrowing and closure of these connection s resulted in extreme salinity fluctuations in the Mediterranean, leading to the precipitation of mor e than 1 million $\mathbf{km}^{3}$ of salt, equivalent to ${\sim}6\%$ of the total dissolved oceanic NaCl (Blanc, 2006; Ryan, Hsü, et al., 1973) in the latest Miocene. This event is known as the MSC (Hsü et al., 1973). Progressive tectonic convergence coupled with isostatic rebound related to lithospheric mantl e dynamics (Duggen et al., 2003) not only severed these earlier marine connections but also uplifte d and exposed them on land (Capella et al., 2017). In the Early Pliocene, two-way exchange wa s established through a single conduit, the Gibraltar Strait. This reconnection event is known as th e Zanclean deluge. Many authors suggest that catastrophic failure of the Atlantic-Mediterranea n barrier at Gibraltar led to the swift refilling of the Mediterranean Sea associated with major erosion in the Alborán Basin (Estrada et al., 2011; Lofi, 2018; Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2020).  

# 6.4.2. Objectives  

Site U1611 targets one of the few thick late Messinian sedimentary successions in the Alborá n Basin. The record recovered from this location will provide key constraints on the chemistry an d physical properties of MO during the Late Miocene. The major objective for Site U1611 was t o recover an $8{-}4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ succession that records the evolution of the Alborán Sea before, during, an d after the MSC. This information will then be used to test the following hypotheses:  

• The Alborán Basin was an intermediate marine system influenced by the Atlantic and separated from the Mediterranean by the Alborán volcanic arc during the MSC, • Mediterranean–Atlantic exchange occurred through the Gibraltar Strait before the start of the MSC, and

# 6.4.3. Operations  

On the morning of 19 January 2024, JOIDES Resolution sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar, on e of the Mediterranean–Atlantic gateways in the title of Expedition 401. The $333\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit fro m Site U1385 to Site U1611 in the Alborán Basin of the Mediterranean Sea took $29.8\,\mathrm{h}$ at an averag e speed of $11.2\,\mathrm{kt}$ . We arrived on site at $1315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 January, lowered the thrusters, and started t o unstow the BHA. At $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ , high winds made it unsafe for the derrickman to work at the monke y board in the derrick, so we waited until $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ for the wind to drop before resuming operations ( a $2.5\,\mathrm{h}$ delay).  

The rig floor team assembled ${\sim}650\ \mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing, hung it below the ship, and made up th e casing stinger BHA, including the bit, underreamer bit, and mud motor. The BHA and drill pip e were lowered down through the casing until the bit and underreamer extended below the casin g by $3\textrm{m}$ . The HRT running tool was attached to the casing, and the funnel was welded on. Th e funnel was lowered through the moonpool at $1540\,\mathrm{h},$ and the whole casing system was lowered t o 792.1 mbsl before installing the top drive. Hole U1611A was started at $1730\,\mathrm{h}$ , and we continue d to drill the casing into Hole U1611A until the reentry cone base landed on the seafloor at 810. 1 mbsl with the bit at 654.6 mbsf and the casing shoe at 652.6 mbsf. The subsea camera wa s deployed to observe the release of the casing, and at $0405\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 January the casing assembly wa s released from the pipe and BHA. The bit was raised back to the ship, clearing the rig floor at 110 3 h and completing the casing portion of operations in Hole U1611A. The RCB BHA was the n assembled with a PDC bit and lowered to $584.9\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , and the subsea camera was deployed agai n to guide reentry into the hole.  

Hole U1611A was reentered at $1832\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the top of the cone was confirmed to be at $807.3\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ and the seafloor was confirmed to be at $810.1~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , very close to the PDR estimate of seafloo r depth at $810.2\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ . The bit was lowered down the casing to 613 mbsf, where it took weight, probably because it met sediments that had come up into the casing. The top drive was installed, an d the bit was washed down to $656.3~\mathrm{mbsf}_{:}$ followed by a 30 bbl mud sweep to clear any remainin g loose sediment from the casing. At $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January, the core line winch electrical controlle r failed, specifically the Veeder-Root counter in the controller. It was replaced, and the winch wa s back online by $0545~\mathrm{h}$ . The first run on the core line was the SET2 tool. The Icefield MI-5 tool, usually run to orient APC cores, was run by piggybacking on the SET2 tool deployment to estimate any deviation of the casing from vertical. It showed a small angle at the top of casing, deviating to $10^{\circ}$ at the base of casing. This result was subsequently confirmed by the downhole loggin g inclinometer data. Coring started at $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ with Core 2R, but it recovered only $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ of sediment, so we ran the bit deplugger. Recovery improved for subsequent cores. Cores 2R–24R penetrate d from 656.3 to 879.4 mbsf and recovered $223.1\:\mathrm{m}\:(74\%)$ . Cores 25R and 26R returned nearly empty, probably because coarse-grained sediments in the formation entered the base of the pipe. The bi t deplugger was deployed again. We made five $30~\mathrm{bbl}$ mud sweeps per day to flush cuttings an d loose sediment out of the borehole, and coring continued with moderate to good recovery. At 081 5 h on 26 January, following Core 44R, we switched to half-core advances, which improved cor e recovery (on 26 January full-core advances yielded $69\%$ recovery and half-core advances yielde d $87\%$ ).  

We switched from half-length to full-length RCB core advances with Core 77R. Core 79R returne d empty, so we ran the bit deplugger again and switched back to half-length advances for Core s 80R–83R, each of which recovered less than $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ . Because hole conditions were difficult, at 194 5 h we started a wiper trip to clear bridges in the hole prior to further coring and downhole logging. Overpulls of 20,000–30,000 lb were observed at 1104.9, 949.4, 881.7, and 872.0 mbsf before the bi t could be raised to the casing shoe. On washing down, 12 tight spots were encountered and $6\,\mathrm{m}$ o f fill was found at the base of the hole. From 0730 to $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 January, we washed out the fill an d swept the hole with 30 bbl sepiolite mud in preparation for coring. Cores 84R–86R penetrated t o 1281.9 mbsf, the final depth of the hole, and recovered $13.2\textrm{m}$ $(68\%)$ . Cores 2R–86R penetrate d from 656.3 to 1281.9 mbsf and recovered $625.6~\mathrm{m}$ of core $(69\%)$ .  

At $1545\,\mathrm{h}$ , we started to prepare the hole for downhole logging. The bit was released at the base o f the hole, the hole was displaced with barite-weighted mud, and the end of pipe was raised to 672. 7 mbsf. The rig floor team assembled the triple combo logging tool string, without the source, an d started lowering it down the pipe at $2145\,\mathrm{h}.$ . The tool string reached an impassable obstruction a t 909.6 mbsf and made a repeat and main pass, which together cover the open hole interval fro m 672.7 to 909.6 mbsf. Borehole diameter varied between narrower than 6 inches to wider than th e maximum extent of the caliper measurement, 17 inches, and the logged interval of the borehol e was inclined from the vertical by between $10^{\circ}$ and $15^{\circ}$ . The triple combo tool string was back o n deck at $0410\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January, and a sonic-inclinometry tool string was assembled for the secon d logging run. This tool string was lowered into the borehole but could not pass below 743.6 mbsf. I t recorded data for the short interval up to the bit and was back on deck by $0910\,\mathrm{h},$ and the loggin g equipment was disassembled by $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ . The BHA was raised back to the ship, clearing the rotar y table at $1400~\mathrm{h}$ and ending Hole U1611A. A new mechanical bit release and PDC RCB bit wer e added to the BHA and were lowered back down close to the seafloor.  

The ship was offset $1316\;\mathrm{m}$ northwest and Hole U1611B was started at $1725\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January at  a water depth of $784~\mathrm{mbsl}$ . The relatively large offset was made to core part of the seismic profil e where reflectors had greater horizontal continuity than in Hole U1611A. We drilled ahead fro m 211.6 to 744.9 mbsf and pumped 30 bbl sepiolite mud sweeps after adding every two stands of pip e to keep the hole clear. When the center bit was retrieved, $1.7\,\mathrm{m}$ of sediment was found behind it i n the core barrel, which was curated as a wash core, 2W. Coring started at $1830~\mathrm{h}$ on 31 January. Cores 3R and 4R had $91\%$ recovery, but the following two cores, 5R and 6R, returned nearly empty, so we ran the bit deplugger and then switched to half-core RCB advances. Coring proceeded wit h half-core advances for the next 3 days, until operations needed to stop to start preparing for th e transit to Napoli, Italy. Core 66R arrived on the catwalk at $2330~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 January and was the las t core of the site and the expedition. Cores 3R–66R penetrated from 744.9 to 1069.9 mbsf an d recovered $77.3\;\mathrm{m}\;(89\%)$ .  

# 6.4.4. Principal results  

# 6.4.4.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Four main lithologies were described in Site U1611: (calcareous) mud, (calcareous) silty mud, sandy silt, and silty sand. Minor lithologies include sandy mud, conglomerate, breccia, an d cemented carbonate (e.g., dolostone and limestone). On the basis of lithologic changes, Hole s U1611A and U1611B are divided into three lithostratigraphic units (Figure F21). Contact s between these units and the lithologies within them are mainly gradational in Unit I (Early Pliocene), characterized by subtle changes in color and grain size, and become more commonly shar p in Units II and III (Messinian), associated with distinct color changes and frequent laminations. The coarser silts and sandier beds typically have sharp to erosive basal contacts.  

Unit I ranges 656.3–820.4 mbsf in Hole U1611A and 746.4–814.2 mbsf in Hole U1611B. In Hol e U1611A, Unit I comprises three subunits, consisting of alternating calcareous mud and calcareou s silty mud. The 733.9–772.3 mbsf interval contains more occurrences of coarser lithologies including conglomerates and calcareous sandy silt (Figure F22). In Unit I in Hole U1611B, calcareou s muds also alternate with calcareous silty muds, with the frequency of coarser lithologies increasing with depth.  

Unit II ranges 820.4–996.5 mbsf in Hole U1611A and 814.2–996.9 mbsf in Hole U1611B. In Hol e U1611A, it is characterized by the presence of laminated beds alternating with nonlaminated an d sometimes coarse graded beds. Unit II consists of two subunits. Subunit IIa (820.4–964.3 mbsf) i s composed of lithologies with variable carbonate content, including mud, calcareous mud, calcareous silty mud, sandy silt, and silty sand, with minor aragonite, cemented carbonate, breccia, an d conglomerate (Figure F22). Subunit IIb (971.5–996.5 mbsf) is composed of similar lithologies a s Subunit IIa, but with a lower carbonate content, with beds of calcareous muds and calcareous silt y muds alternating with muds, sandy silts, and sands. In Hole U1611B, Unit II mostly consists of th e same lithologies as those in Hole U1611A, typically with a lower calcareous content with increasing depth. However, in Hole U1611B more silty muds were described in the deeper part of Unit II, and in general there are more coarser beds.  

Unit III ranges 1000.6–1275.9 mbsf in Hole U1611A and 997.1–1069.69 mbsf in Hole U1611B. I n Hole U1611A, Unit III consists of two subunits. Subunit IIIa (1000.6–1144.9 mbsf) consists of frequent alternations of silty mud and calcareous silty mud in the shallower parts, with numerou s intervals of sandy silt and silty sand. The proportion of calcareous silty mud is lower in the deepe r part of Subunit IIIa. There is also minor conglomerate typically associated with contorted, slumplike sediment deformation, and cemented carbonate. Subunit IIIb (1146.1–1275.9 mbsf) consist s of similar lithologies to Subunit IIIa, except that Subunit IIIb lacks the rapid interbedding o f calcareous silty mud and silty mud and contains more frequent occurrences of coarser graine d intervals (e.g., sandy silt and silty sand). In Hole U1611B, Unit III is similar to the upper part o f Subunit IIIa in Hole U1611A, except that there is a notable thick conglomerate $(8.5~\mathrm{m})$ that wa s not recovered in Hole U1611A. Unit III is characterized by the presence of laminated beds alternating with nonlaminated and normally graded beds, but the laminations appear subtler than i n Unit II (Figure F22).

During the Messinian, particularly in Unit III, there is evidence of an interplay of gravitational an d pelagic/hemipelagic processes. This produced a complex depositional system, where the slumps, debrites, and turbiditic deposits are volumetrically the most important deposits in the succession, resulting in a high sedimentation rate. Unit II is characterized by the development of lamination s throughout, along with the presence of thin aragonite layers, dark muds, etc. During this time, th e basin likely became more restricted, and the relatively high sedimentation rate and low botto m water oxygenation led to a benthic-poor habitat, limiting macrobenthos trace-fossil maker community sufficiently to prevent bioturbation, preserving the finely laminated sediments (Schimmelmann et al., 2016). These processes and the precipitation of aragonite are possible in stratifie d “marine lakes” with restricted seawater access and water column stratification (Schimmelmann e t al., 2016). Turbidite and debrite deposits are also present in Unit II, and according to the literatur e on this sector of the Alborán Sea, these deposits are considered to be chaotic mass transpor t deposits that accumulated during the Messinian Salinity Crisis (Martínez del Olmo and Comas, 2008; Estrada et al., 2011; Martínez del Olmo, 2012; Bulian et al., 2021). Based on the results fro m this expedition, Unit II has thinner and finer gravitational deposits that occur less commonly tha n Unit III.  

The Pliocene sediments of Unit I display clear evidence of bottom water currents (contouritic) an d pelagic/hemipelagic sedimentation. Similar Pliocene sequences observed elsewhere in th e

Examples of lighter colored laminations reflecting variable carbonate content (401-U1611A-36R-1 and 401-U1611B-30R-3), white lamination s composed of aragonite that are parallel (401-U1611A-30R-4 and 401-U1611B-31R-4), and deformed (contorted an d faulted), parallel, and cross laminations (401-U1611A-41R-1).  

Alborán Basin are considered to result mainly from the regional circulation of the deep, intermediate, and surface Mediterranean water mass currents (e.g., Juan et al., 2016, 2020; Ercilla et al., 2016; Llave et al., 2020). The transition from the low-oxygen finely laminated sediments of Unit I I to the well-oxygenated contouritic sediments of Unit I occurs over a $2\textrm{m}$ interval that was no t recovered in either Hole U1611A or U1611B. Dating of the uppermost Miocene and lowermos t Pliocene sediments on either side of this recovery gap is necessary to determine the duration o f this transition, which may be associated with the catastrophic refilling of the Mediterranean at th e Miocene/Pliocene boundary (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2020).  

# 6.4.4.2. Biostratigraphy  

This site is characterized by some intervals poor in microfauna, particularly planktonic foraminifers. However, despite some core catchers being barren in foraminifers, they were rich in fish teet h and scales, wood fragments, and shell fragments, providing valuable information about the site’ s paleoenvironment.  

Both holes were designed to start retrieving cores in the Early Pliocene, and this age was confirmed by the calcareous nannoplankton and foraminifer assemblages recovered in the uppermos t core catcher samples ( $656\,\mathrm{~m~}$ in Hole U1611A and $744\,\textrm{m}$ in Hole U1611B). Below Sample s 401-U1611A-18R-CC (821.2 mbsf) and 401-U1611B-14R-CC (815.7 mbsf), close to the Lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary, planktonic foraminifers are absent (with rare exceptions) in th e fraction larger than $150\;\upmu\mathrm{m},$ , although they continue to be present in the $63{-}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction. W e interpret this change to be the Messinian/Zanclean boundary. There is also a significant change i n the composition of the sediments below this boundary, with almost no biogenic particles in th e coarse fraction except for fish and wood fragments. The near total absence of ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ planktoni c foraminifers continues to Sample 401-U1611A-42R-CC (1037.2 mbsf). Beneath this, to the bottom of Hole U1611A the sediments typically contain some planktonic foraminifers in the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction but few benthic foraminifers. The presence of calcareous nannofossils $R$ . pseudoumbilicus and Nicklithus amplificus in the lowermost sample from Hole U1611A (1281.9 mbsf) constrain s the age at the base of the hole to be between 6.82 and $7.10\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . (Figure F21).  

# 6.4.4.3. Paleomagnetism  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements were performed using the SRM to investigate th e NRM of all the archive-half sections of Holes U1611A and U1611B. AF demagnetization was performed on the SRM by applying stepwise peak fields of 5, 10, 15, and $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ , with measurement o f the remaining magnetization taken at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution.  

In addition, we collected discrete samples of all the working-half sections of Hole U1611A. W e measured the AMS and bulk MS using the MFK2 KappaBridge unit and the NRM on the AGIC O JR-6A spinner magnetometer. Stepwise AF demagnetization was performed at successive pea k fields of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and $30\;\mathrm{mT}$ up to a maximum of $60\,\mathrm{mT}$ . In addition, we performed stepwis e thermal demagnetization up to a maximum temperature of $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ on six sawed samples. Th e paleomagnetic intensities are weak, and inclinations are scattered between expected normal an d reversed polarities. This makes it unclear if it was the primary magnetic signal or a pervasiv e overprint that was measured. Thermal demagnetization experiments show the presence of iro n sulfides in the sediment.  

The AMS results from Hole U1611A show an overall vertical direction of the $\kappa_{\mathrm{min}}$ axis with a scatter on the order of $10^{\circ}$ , in agreement with observations of subhorizontal strata in the split cores.  

# 6.4.4.4. Geochemistry  

Headspace gas samples and IW in Hole U1611A were taken at one per recovered core or one ever y other half advance. Gas contents in both holes remained within a safe range, and the downhol e pattern of methane/ethane ratios and absolute methane values are similar between the holes, despite a horizontal separation of $1361\;\mathrm{m}$ . IW salinities reached a maximum of 70 at ${\sim}1050$ mbs f and then decreased below that level. Major ion chemistry was used to interpret the origin of thes e saline IW to be a possible remnant of late Messinian brine. Partly because of this observation, w e consulted with onshore microbiologists and took $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ whole-round samples from Hole U1611B a t $20\textrm{m}$ intervals using clean equipment and immediately froze them at $-80^{\circ}C$ for possible futur e microbiological analysis.  

$\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ varies from 5.0 to $92.0~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at Site U1611, with a mean of $28.3~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . $C a C O_{3}$ is generall y between 30 and $60\:\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the Pliocene Unit I. In Unit II, carbonate decreases to between 14 an d $36\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and in Unit III it decreases further to the range of $15{-}25\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . In Unit III, these low carbonate concentrations are interrupted by decimeter-scale dolomitic or cemented carbonate bed s with high values, typically greater than $60\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ (7 samples).  

# 6.4.4.5. Physical properties and downhole measurements  

Large-scale downhole patterns in the whole-round physical properties data of Holes U1611A an d U1611B typically match well, but the same horizons are approximately $5{-}15\;\mathrm{m}$ shallower in Hol e U1611B compared to Hole U1611A. Coarser lithologies tend to have lower NGR values. Cemented carbonate layers are distinguished by low NGR and MS values and relatively high GR A density values (Figure F21).  

Downhole logging in Hole U1611A was only partially successful, with the triple combo tool strin g reaching 909 mbsf, logging a $236\,\mathrm{~m~}$ open hole interval. However, this interval includes th e Messinian/Zanclean boundary at ${\sim}820$ mbsf, providing stratigraphic continuity there, and als o covers some poorly recovered Messinian intervals. The sonic-inclinometry tool string reached 74 3 mbsf before the hole became impassible. The borehole was characterized in the caliper borehol e diameter log by washouts, bridges, and ledges. According to both the General Purpose Inclinometry Tool logs, at the end of the pipe the borehole was inclined at ${\sim}9^{\circ}$ from vertical and th e inclination increased with depth to more than $12^{\circ}$ at 750 mbsf.  

# 7. Preliminary scientific assessment  

# 7.1. Objective 1: to document the time at which the Atlantic first started to receive a distinct overflow from the Mediterranean and to evaluate quantitatively its role in Late Miocene global climate and regional environmental change  

• Hypothesis 1.1: the earliest contourites formed as a result of Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange and correlate with the onset of Late Miocene SST decline in the mid- and high latitudes. Dating the first Atlantic–Mediterranean contourites will test this hypothesis.   
• Hypothesis 1.2: atmospheric $C O_{2}$ sequestration in the deeper ocean through the initiation and development of AMW can account for the degree and distribution of SST cooling observed. Reconstructing the velocity, density, and flux of AMW through time, quantifying its impact on $C O_{2}$ advection (Capella et al., 2019), and then modeling the resulting SST distribution (e.g., Ivanovic et al., 2014a) tests this hypothesis.   
• Hypothesis 1.3: AMW modulates NADW formation, triggers glacial inception, and influences continental-scale aridification. Model-based testing of this hypothesis requires the correlation of IMMAGE records with existing high-resolution records globally.  

Hypothesis 1.1 will require the coring of the fossil corridors in Spain and Morocco to test entirely. However, the records in the Atlantic also hold part of the story. The information collected that i s relevant to this hypothesis is as follows:  

• Site U1385: no contourites were recovered. This is consistent with its water depth, which is substantially below the core of the MOW plume today. However, the Miocene successions here, like the even deeper records cored during Expedition 397 at Sites U1586 and U1587 (Hodell et al., 2023), do record strong precessional cyclicity in NGR that does appear to correlate very precisely with the timing of major changes occurring in the Mediterranean during the MSC that have direct implications for Atlantic–Mediterranean exchange (Flecker et al., 2015). • Site U1609: fine-grained silty mud contourites were recovered from the surface to a depth of 320 mbsf in Hole U1609A and 352 mbsf in Hole U1609B. The gradational nature of the transitions between subtle grain size differences make it difficult to be sure exactly where the onset is, and this will need resolving with detailed grain size analysis after the expedition. However,  

the identified onset corresponds broadly to the onset of the MSC in the Mediterranean (5.97 Ma). There is no evidence of contourites deeper in the succession.   
• Site U1610: the top $200\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered from Hole U1610A (500–700 mbsf) comprised silty mud contourites. These beds were both siltier (e.g., coarser) and thicker than the equivalent-aged Early Pliocene contourites at Site U1609. This is consistent with their more proximal position relative to the Gibraltar Strait. At Site U1610, however, there is an interval between 700 and 935 mbsf where no contourites were recovered, nor is there any clear evidence of bottom water current activity of any sort, although again this will need testing with high-resolution grain size analysis. Between 935 and 1030 mbsf, there are clear contourites. This interval is Messinian and is equivalent to the period just before and during the lower part of the MSC. More detailed correlation and dating will be required to ascertain exactly when these contouritic sediments start and end here. The succession from 1030 mbsf to the bottom of the hole (1400 mbsf) is dominated by sandstones deposited by turbidity currents and mass flows. However, there is almost always evidence of reworking by bottom currents.   
• Site U1611: the Pliocene succession recovered at this site in the Mediterranean is dominated by silty mud contourites. There is no evidence of contourite deposition below the Miocene/Pliocene boundary.  

In summary, Site U1609 will be the best location for evaluating the timing of the initial onset o f bottom water currents in the Tortonian when MO is thought to have started. It will also be necessary to establish that the bottom current features are not generated by other water masses. Th e contouritic information derived from the other sites is Messinian–Pliocene in age and provide s interesting insights into bottom current variability through time.  

Testing Hypotheses 1.2 and 1.3 will require detailed postcruise analysis and modeling. However,  a critical first step was to recover successions that could be tuned to the insolation curve as a mean s to achieving precessional-scale correlation between Expedition 401 sites and far-field locations o f the same age. Given the depth our succession was buried, we anticipated $30\%{-}40\%$ recovery, consistent with typical RCB recovery rates. However, not only was the recovery much better than thi s $(>\!82\%$ overall), but in addition because our 8 Ma target was not buried as deeply as we had though t there was time to drill not one but two holes at Site U1609, generating a splice that is nearly complete. We also have a close to complete record at Site U1385 that can be correlated peak-to-peak t o the adjacent orbitally tuned NGR records from Sites U1586 and U1587 (Hodell et al., 2023). Finally, although the recovery of the single hole at Site U1610 was only $80\%$ , most of the poo r recovery is toward the bottom of the hole. The upper part of the succession is strongly cyclic, making it likely that it will be possible to tune the record to the insolation curve.  

Taken together, the cores recovered during Expedition 401 place us in a far better position to tes t these hypotheses than could ever have been anticipated before the expedition.  

# 7.2. Objective 2: to recover a complete record of Atlantic– Mediterranean exchange before, during, and after the Messinian Salinity Crisis and to evaluate the causes and consequences of this extreme oceanographic event locally, regionally, and globally  

• Hypothesis 2.1: the Alborán Basin was an intermediate marine system influenced by the Atlantic and separated from the Mediterranean by the Alborán volcanic arc during the MSC. • Hypothesis 2.2: extreme environmental fluctuations in the Mediterranean had negligible impact on AMW.  

Cores recovered at Site U1611 in the Alborán Sea record a thick succession of organic-ric h laminated fine-grained sediments interbedded with turbidites, debrites, and slumps, overlain b y Pliocene contourites. The fauna and ichnofossils identified in the pre-Pliocene sequence indicat e that subaqueous deposition occurred throughout but that the water mass was highly stratifie d with low oxygen or anoxic conditions at the sediment/water interface. The bottom of the hole i s probably around $6.8\mathrm{~Ma}$ , and this sequence continues with these same features right up to th e Miocene/Pliocene boundary. We drilled two holes at this site, and Hole U1611B in particular i s largely complete $(78\%)$ because of the drilling configuration we employed (half-advance corin g using the RCB coring system and a PDC bit). The majority of what was not recovered was in th e Pliocene, so the record from the Miocene–Pliocene downward (with the exception of a $2~\mathrm{m}$ ga p just below the Miocene/Pliocene boundary) is close to continuous. This will make testing Hypothesis 2.1 possible with additional postcruise analysis.  

Hypothesis 2.2 requires the tuning of both Mediterranean and Atlantic records to the insolatio n curve to compare the timing of changes in the physical properties reflecting Late Miocene wate r mass and sedimentation changes. Although the details of this tuning require refinement, particularly in Site U1611, the changes in the physical properties records at times consistent with majo r changes in the Mediterranean associated with gateway changes are clear. Exploration of the mechanisms for achieving these synchronous changes can now be implemented through postcruis e empirical and modeling studies.  

# 7.3. Objective 3: to test our quantitative understanding of the behavior of ocean overflow plumes during the most extreme exchange in Earth’s history  

• Hypothesis 3.1: the velocity of the plume is a function of the Atlantic–Mediterranean density contrast, limitation on flow through the strait (Bryden et al., 1994), the gradient of the slope, and the degree of mixing (Price et al., 1993).   
• Hypothesis 3.2: mixing with ambient water causes a strong negative feedback on the size of the plume, limiting the degree of its variability (Price et al., 1993). This means that only minor changes in the physical size of the plume are expected, despite the proportion of plume water derived directly from the outflow varying significantly. As a result, changes in Mediterranean density have little impact on the plume position.   
• Hypothesis 3.3: the main control on the settling depth of MO is the vertical density gradient in the North Atlantic, which is a product of North Atlantic overturning circulation (Rogerson et al., 2012a).  

Testing these physical oceanography hypotheses will require detailed physical and chemical analysis and modeling. However, this is only possible because of the high recovery rates with clear an d tunable cyclicity enabling site-to-site correlation down the MO plume on a precessional timescale. The cores we have recovered will permit us to test whether the representations of overflows withi n general circulation models are effective when overflow density is higher than the range of validation provided by the modern ocean. If general circulation model representation of these Messinia n high density overflows are inadequate, this casts doubt on all modeling experiments in which par t of the ocean-atmosphere system is outside the range exhibited today.  

# 8. Outreach  

Expedition 401 had two Education and Outreach Officers: Erin Winick Anthony, a science communicator and founder of STEAM Power Media based out of Texas (USA), and Kellan Moss,  a freelance artist and scientific illustrator based out of Washington (USA). Both officers conducte d outreach from aboard JOIDES Resolution, communicating the science objectives of the expeditio n to students and the general public across the world through numerous platforms. These include d live ship-to-shore events, digital portraits, pastel drawings, social media, videos, media interviews, and blog posts.  

# 8.1. Tours  

The Outreach Officers hosted live ship-to-shore video tours on Zoom for formal and informa l groups all over the world. These events introduced students and members of general audiences t o the scientific goals of Expedition 401 and the broader history, significance, and process of scientific ocean drilling.  

Broadcasts began with an introduction to JOIDES Resolution, an explanation of the importance o f scientific ocean drilling, and a description of the scientific goals of the expedition. In some cases,  a scientist who shared a non-English language with the audience hosted the tour. Participant s received a 45 min tour of the ship that included the bridge, lifeboats, derrick, rig floor, catwalk, an d laboratories. Viewers learned about the core flow process from scientists in each laborator y including physical properties, core description, paleomagnetism, biostratigraphy, and geochemistry. Tours ended with question-and-answer sessions with scientists and the Onboard Outreac h Officer.  

Over the course of the expedition, the Onboard Outreach Officers facilitated 75 Zoom tours t o many international groups, including primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities, podcasts, museums, after school programs, and informal public groups. These tours were completed in 15 different countries in 6 different languages to about 465,000 people.  

Some special occasion tours were given to groups such as Centro Ciência Viva do Algarve, whic h also hosted a Portugal based exhibit about the exhibition; the Smithsonian National Museum o f Natural History, which reached visitors to the institute; and CBS Mission Unstoppable, which liv e streamed the tour on Twitch. Student audiences ranged from Pre-K to graduate university level.  

The Expedition Project Manager, both Co-Chief Scientists, and every member of the science part y assisted with the tours. Many of the scientists recruited tour audiences in their home countries. Two Chinese scientists worked with IODP China to arrange a live tour with primary school s around the country. That connection was facilitated by the Xinhua official Chinese news agency, which live streamed the event, reaching an audience of approximately 460,000 people in China. Multiple members of the science party recorded tours with their universities for later use, including a PhD student who will use the recording for a seminar at their weekly Geology and Geophysics Department meetings.  

The following includes some of the feedback sent by groups who received tours:  

• “It was hard to believe we were at sea, the images looked so stable, clean, beautiful and undisturbed, they were. The audio was also so good, and everyone was so excited.” —Yukari Kido, Women for One Ocean, Japan.   
• “Seriously the best ship to shore I have ever seen. And I have seen a lot.” —Sarah Kachovich, Australia-New Zealand IODP Consortium, Australia.   
• “The tour was so informational, and they loved every moment of it. I really liked the time allowed for asking questions, too!” - Taryn Page, Charlotte Country Day School, United States.   
• “That was really interesting, and pitched just right for my class. They are buzzing right now, having some more great questions and chatting to each other about what they saw and even talking about what they want to do with science when they grow up.” —Margaret Tokunaga, Cutthrope Primary, United Kingdom.   
• “The link has really stimulated some interesting discussions and I think we might have one or two who want to follow in similar careers-I suspect applications for earth sciences at university will be quite popular $\circleddash$ Evie is still asking questions! Even the lady from our marketing department who took a few photos stayed to listen as she found it so fascinating.” —Jacky Gill, Woodbridge School, United Kingdom.   
• “The kids really enjoyed it! We had about 150 people in attendance total. While my new department members were dubious at first about the relevance, they really see the importance of this type of interaction now!” —Jennifer Field, Weston High School, United States.   
• “THANK YOU SO MUCH! That was so fun and they have not stopped talking about how much fun they had.” —Peyton Early, Hallsville Middle School, United States.  

A letter from the CEO of National Youth Science Forum (NYSF), Dr. Melanie Bagg GAICD, wa s also sent to the outreach officers, thanking them for the tour and their efforts to the NYSF program.  

Additionally, eight of the tours from the expedition have been or will be posted publicly, furtherin g the impact of the events. A sampling can be viewed at the following links:

# 8.2. Social media  

The Outreach Officers maintained six online platforms during the expedition: Facebook, Instagram, X, Threads, YouTube, and the JOIDES Resolution Expedition 401 web page.  

The Outreach Officers posted 100 Facebook posts, 254 Facebook stories, 79 Instagram posts, 61 1 Instagram stories, 108 Tweets, 10 short YouTube videos, and 35 Threads posts on the JOIDE S Resolution accounts over the course of Expedition 401. Across all platforms, these posts reache d approximately 2.3 million impressions and received nearly 100,000 interactions (e.g., likes, shares, and comments).  

One Outreach Officer used their own social media accounts with a following of more than 100,00 0 to reach an additional audience during the expedition. More than 110 posts were published acros s their professional Facebook and Instagram accounts. These posts achieved millions of impression s and directed this audience to the JOIDES Resolution accounts.  

Because of the success of posts on both sets of accounts, JOIDES Resolution gained more tha n 1200 new Facebook followers, 500 Instagram followers, and 150 X followers.  

Expedition 401 content also performed exceptionally well on the platform Threads. Although th e platform does not yet offer analytics tools, the JOIDES Resolution account gained at least 700 ne w followers from the success of these posts.  

More than 50 of the social media posts were vertical videos created as one of the outreach officer’ s shipboard projects. These videos covered topics ranging from sleep shifts on the ship to scienc e highlights of the expedition. Some of the top performing videos included the following:  

• Time-lapse of thrusters descending at the third drilling site (1.1 million views on Facebook), • Sleep schedule explainer (780,000 views on Facebook and 13,700 views on Instagram), • Explainer of the black bag signals on ship (64,000 views on Facebook), • Guide to how to make a shrunken Styrofoam cup at sea (30,800 views on Instagram), and • Favorite geology movies of the science team (23,300 views on Instagram).  

The Science in 60 Seconds video series featured nearly half of the science party taking on the challenge to explain their work in 60 s or less. This video series received more than 65,000 views an d will be packaged together for future educational use.  

Three videos created during the expedition have been or will also be shared by CBS Missio n Unstoppable, a women in STEM focused television show and social media platform. The Nationa l STEM Challenge also reposted the video created about shrinking cups using ocean pressures. Xena Workwear, a women’s steel toe boot company, will feature a day in the life vlog created by on e of our Outreach Officers after the end of the expedition.  

A total of 11 blog posts were written and published on the JOIDES Resolution web page durin g Expedition 401. These blogs covered topics including scientific explainers, expedition new s updates, and questions-and-answers with scientists. One of these blogs was also adapted into  a sharable infographic for social media.  

# 8.3. Media coverage  

Expedition 401 received coverage by several high-profile organizations including the BBC and th e Weather Channel. The Outreach Officers pitched Expedition 401 to climate and STEM focuse d media outlets, resulting in coverage in outlets such as the Weather Channel, CBS Mission Unstoppable, and Solve It for Kids. The Weather Channel team also requested that a follow up live interview is done after the expedition to share the initial results.  

The ship’s proximity to and visibility from Malaga, Spain, resulted in additional news coverag e from local publications. After this coverage, the science team reached out to the outlet that firs t covered the ship, resulting in the featuring of the three Spanish scientists aboard the ship.  

Additional articles were written by the science party for publications such the UK-IODP newsletter and U.S. Science Support Program’s Drilling Dispatch newsletter. Multiple universities including Princeton and the University of Bristol published articles covering the participation of thei r respective scientists in the expedition.  

Links to a sampling of news clippings covering the expedition are in Table T2.  

# 8.4. Visual art  

An Onboard Outreach Officer completed over a dozen original pieces of artwork that were share d to the various JOIDES Resolution social media pages. Currently, at least 12 more pieces are scheduled to be completed postcruise, half in digital format and half traditional chalk pastel. Coordination to feature this artwork at an exhibit or conference is in progress for the next fiscal year.  

# 8.4.1. Traditional artwork  

Six original pieces of artwork were completed during the duration of Expedition 401 using chal k pastels and colored pencils (Figure F23). Each piece is based on a photo taken by the artist an d sketched onto roughly $30\,\mathrm{cm}\times42\,\mathrm{cm}$ colored cotton paper. Firm, vivid chalk pastels were used t o color these drawings and a fixative was used to prevent smearing. Colored pencils were used fo r finer details. Each piece was completed in $6{-}14\,\mathrm{h}$ . Four of these pieces featured specific scientist s at work, and the other two pieces featured the SIEM Offshore drilling crew. Each piece featured  a different area of work from various fields of study. Once completed, the artwork was turned into  a social post, either in picture or video format.  

Two of these pieces were featured in the SIEM Offshore newspaper.  

In additional to these six pieces, the onboard artist also completed warm-up sketches of variou s equipment around the ship. These were also posted to the JOIDES Resolution social media page s as a photo set and a video.  

# 8.4.2. Digital artwork  

Six original portraits of various members of the Science Party were completed during the duratio n of Expedition 401 using a digital software program. These portraits took between $4{-}10\,\mathrm{h}$ to complete and were shared to the JOIDES Resolution social media pages in video format. After th e expedition, these same members will be redrawn, showcasing any physical or emotional change s each of them underwent during the 2 month cruise.  

Additional warm-up sketches were completed for this medium. These warm-ups were also turne d into a video for the JOIDES Resolution social media pages.

# 8.5. Additional outreach projects  

The Education and Outreach Officers each undertook additional side projects to share the scientific objectives of Expedition 401.  

# 8.5.1. A picture from space  

Through coordination with the Crew Earth Observation team at Johnson Space Center, the outreach officers arranged for a picture to be taken of JOIDES Resolution from the International Spac e Station. The image taken by NASA astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli shows the ship as a tiny dot in th e North Atlantic. Given that the space station and the ship are both major international collaborations and remote floating laboratories, a product is being created to show the similarities betwee n the two missions.  

# 8.5.2. 3D printing at sea  

An Outreach Officer used the 3D printer on the ship to create a portable model of one of th e coring bits. Smaller versions of the model were also turned into necklaces and earrings. Thes e served as models used in the ship-to-shore events to better explain the technology of the ship.  A video was created about this project to share the manufacturing tools on the ship online.  

# 8.5.3. Documentary coordination  

Expedition 403 will have a documentary crew sailing on JOIDES Resolution. This crew is also planning to include part of the story of Expedition 401. The Onboard Outreach Officers coordinate d with this team to set up interviews with the Expedition 401 science team and record any additiona l shipboard footage that the documentary crew needs.  

# 8.5.4. Article writing  

Before sailing, one of the outreach officers coordinated with Beanz: The Kids STEAM Magazin e and Engineering.com to write articles covering the expedition. An article written for Beanz covered the preparations for the expedition (https://kidscodecs.com/preparing-ocean-expedition). The Engineering.com article will cover the topic of remote manufacturing and the tools availabl e on the ship. The Outreach Officer performed interviews on the ship for this article and will writ e it upon return to shore.

# 8.5.5. Photography  

One of the Outreach Officers took over 5000 photos of the various scientists and crew members. These photos were used to highlight specific events and members at work as social media posts. I n addition, they were used in various videos produced for social media and for the Family & Friend s page for the expedition. There are future plans for these photos to be made into a mixed medi a animation by said photographer after the expedition.  

Recreation photos of Leg 13 staff and scientists with Expedition 401 staff and scientists were als o taken. These photos showcased the similarity between the two expeditions while highlighting th e women-centric party we sailed with today.
