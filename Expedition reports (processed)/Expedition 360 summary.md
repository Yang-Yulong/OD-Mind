# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 360 was the first leg of Phase I of the SloMo (shorthand for “The nature of the lower crust and Moho at slower spreading ridges”) Project, a multiphase drilling program that proposes to drill through the outermost of the global seismic velocity discontinuities, the Mohorovičić seismic discontinuity (Moho). The Moho corresponds to a compressional wave velocity increase, typically at ${\sim}7~\mathrm{km}$ beneath the oceans, and has generally been regarded as the boundary between crust and mantle. An alternative model, that the Moho is a hydration front in the mantle, has recently gained credence upon the discovery of abundant partially serpentinized peridotite on the seafloor and on the walls of fracture zones, such as at Atlantis Bank, an 11–13 My old elevated oceanic core complex massif adjacent to the Atlantis II Transform on the Southwest Indian Ridge.  

Hole U1473A was drilled on the summit of Atlantis Bank during Expedition 360, $1{-}2\ \mathrm{km}$ away from two previous Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) holes: Hole 735B (drilled during ODP Leg 118 in 1987 and ODP Leg 176 in 1997) and Hole 1105A (drilled during ODP Leg 179 in 1998). A mantle peridotite/gabbro contact has been traced by dredging and diving along the transform wall for $40\;\mathrm{km}$ . The contact is located at ${\sim}4200\mathrm{~m~}$ depth on the transform wall below the drill sites but shoals considerably $20\,\mathrm{km}$ to the south, where it was observed in outcrop at $2563\,\mathrm{m}$ depth. Moho reflections, however, have been found at ${\sim}5{-}6\,\mathrm{km}$ beneath Atlantis Bank and ${<}4\,\mathrm{km}$ beneath the transform wall, leading to the suggestion that the seismic discontinuity may not represent the crust/mantle boundary but rather an alteration (serpentinization) front. This in turn raises the interesting possibility that methanogenesis associated with serpentinization could support a whole new planetary biosphere deep in the oceanic basement. The SloMo Project seeks to test these hypotheses at Atlantis Bank and evaluate the processes of natural carbon sequestration in the lower crust and uppermost mantle.  

A primary objective of SloMo Leg 1 was to explore the lateral variability of the stratigraphy established in Hole 735B. Comparison of Hole U1473A with Holes 735B and 1105A allows us to demonstrate a continuity of process and complex interplay of magmatic accretion and steady-state detachment faulting over a time period of ${\sim}128\ \mathrm{ky}.$ . Preliminary assessment indicates that these sections of lower crust are constructed by repeated cycles of intrusion, represented in Hole U1473A by approximately three upwardly differentiated hundreds of meter–scale bodies of olivine gabbro broadly similar to those encountered in the deeper parts of Hole 735B.  

Specific aims of Expedition 360 focused on gaining an understanding of how magmatism and tectonism interact in accommodating seafloor spreading, how magnetic reversal boundaries are expressed in the lower crust, assessing the role of the lower crust and shallow mantle in the global carbon cycle, and constraining the extent and nature of life at deep levels within the ocean lithosphere.  

# Summary  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 360 was the first leg of Phase I of the SloMo (shorthand for “The nature of the lower crust and Moho at slower spreading ridges”) Project, a multiphase drilling program that proposes to drill through the outermost of the global seismic velocity discontinuities, the Mohorovičić seismic discontinuity (Moho). The Moho corresponds to a compressional wave velocity increase from ${\sim}6.7~\mathrm{km/s}$ to between 7.6 and $8.6~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s},$ , typically at ${\sim}7~\mathrm{km}$ beneath the oceans. Since the work of Adams and Coker (1906), Adams and Williamson (1923), and Wrinch and Jeffreys (1923), the Moho has generally been regarded as the boundary between crust and mantle; however, an alternative model, that the Moho is a hydration front in the mantl e (Hess, 1960, 1962), has recently gained credence upon the discover y of abundant partially serpentinized peridotite on the seafloor an d on the walls of fracture zones. One such location is Atlantis Bank, an 11–13 My old elevated oceanic core complex massif adjacent t o the Atlantis II Transform on the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR).  

IODP Hole U1473A was drilled on the summit of Atlantis Ban k during Expedition 360, $1{-}2\ \mathrm{km}$ away from two previous Ocea n Drilling Program (ODP) holes: Hole 735B (drilled during ODP Le g 118 in 1987 and ODP Leg 176 in 1997) and Hole 1105A (ODP Le g 179 in 1998). A mantle peridotite/gabbro contact has been trace d for $15~\mathrm{km}$ at ${\sim}4200\mathrm{~m~}$ depth along the transform wall ${\sim}11.5~\mathrm{km}$ t o the west. Moho reflections have, however, been found at ${\sim}5–6~\mathrm{km}$ beneath Atlantis Bank, leading to the suggestion that the seismi c discontinuity may not represent the crust/mantle boundary bu t rather an alteration (serpentinization) front (Muller et al., 2000). This in turn raises the interesting possibility that methanogenesi s associated with serpentinization could support a whole new planetary biosphere deep in the oceanic basement. The SloMo Projec t seeks to test these hypotheses at Atlantis Bank and evaluate the processes of natural carbon sequestration in the lower crust and uppermost mantle.  

Located on the north-central part of Atlantis Bank, $2.2\ \mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of Hole 735B, Hole U1473A was drilled $789.7\,\textrm{m}$ drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) into massive gabbro cut by isolated dikes. The shallower part of the hole has been affected b y faulting: in the upper $469\mathrm{~m~}$ , seven distinct fault systems were encountered, ranging from $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick cataclasite bands to a $50\,\mathrm{m}$ thic k carbonate-veined chlorite-rich fault zone. Over this interval, we obtained $44\%$ recovery under relatively poor drilling conditions. Fro m $469\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF to the bottom of the hole, however, drilling condition s were excellent, similar to Hole 735B, with $96\%$ recovery in the lowermost $212~\mathrm{m}$ interval cored $(577.5\mathrm{-}789.7\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF). Hole U1473A i s the deepest hole ever drilled from the seafloor into ocean crus t during a single 2 month expedition. The hole is in good conditio n overall and, after minor remediation operations carried out durin g IODP Expedition 362T (July 2016), can be reoccupied.  

A primary objective of SloMo Leg 1 was to explore the latera l variability of the stratigraphy established in Hole 735B. Compariso n of Hole U1473A with Holes 735B (Dick et al., 2000) and 1105A (Casey et al., 2007) allows us to demonstrate a continuity of process an d complex interplay of magmatic accretion and steady-state detachment faulting over a time period of ${\sim}128\,\mathrm{ky}$ . Preliminary assessmen t indicates that these sections of lower crust are constructed by repeated cycles of intrusion, represented in Hole U1473A by approximately three upwardly differentiated hundreds of meter–scal e bodies of olivine gabbro broadly similar to those encountered in th e deeper parts $_{>500}$ meters below seafloor [mbsf]) of Hole 735B.  

The gabbro bodies in Hole U1473A are transposed by intens e locally pervasive ductile deformation, with extensive intervals o f sheared porphyroclastic to ultramylonitic gabbro (often Fe-Ti oxid e rich) forming a $600\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick crystal-plastic shear zone. Notably, shear sense is both normal and reversed in the upper section of th e hole but predominantly reversed in the lower part. Similar relationships are also seen in Hole 735B; all are probably a response of th e Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex to flexure during exhumation. Deformation is noticeably less intense toward the bottom of Hol e U1473A, with primary subophitic igneous textures often well preserved in the lowermost $200\;\mathrm{m}$ . Overall, the presence of such extensive crystal-plastic deformation in Hole U1473A and elsewhere a t Atlantis Bank demonstrates that magmatic accretion took place in  a highly dynamic environment, beginning while the gabbros wer e partially molten and continuing as they cooled and were exhume d tectonically from beneath the rift valley floor.  

The average composition for Hole U1473A is very similar t o Hole 735B, with $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ of 71 and $0.7~\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ . However, $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ contents averaging $1.0\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , even in petrographically fresh samples, ar e much higher than expected for pristine gabbro cumulates. Most o f the gabbros drilled in Hole U1473A are olivine gabbro, with lesse r but still significant proportions of gabbro and oxide-bearing gabbro. The relationship between these rock types is complex and range s from simple interlocking igneous contacts between undeforme d gabbros with subparallel coarse to pegmatitic oxide gabbro layers, to isolated patches of oxide- and pyroxene-rich gabbro intercalate d with the olivine gabbro, to oxide concentrations that indicate local migration of late Fe-Ti oxide–rich melts along active shear zones. The  Fe-Ti–rich  oxide  gabbro  and  gabbronorite  occurrences, whether in layers and patches or within shear zones, appear to hav e crystallized from evolved interstitial melt compacted out of the olivine gabbro cumulates and record the migration of these melt s through the section. Evidence for percolation of more primitiv e melts through the section is also ubiquitous, with fine-grained microgabbros intruding or replacing the coarse olivine gabbro. Approximately $1.5\%$ of the section consists of late magmatic felsi c veins ranging in composition from diorite to trondhjemite. Thes e may represent the final stages of fractionation of the melts intrude d to form the gabbros or may instead be produced by reheating an d partial anatexis of the section by successive intrusive events. Several diabase dikes intruded gabbros that had been altered under conditions ranging from granulite to greenschist facies. These includ e granoblastic hornblende diabase dikes that appear to have partiall y melted the crystal-plastically deformed gabbro host to form trondhjemite. Overall, the bulk of the gabbros are too fractionated to be i n equilibrium with the mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) exposed o n the hanging wall (e.g., Natland et al., 1991; Robinson et al., 1996 ) and scattered over the detachment fault surface, reflecting a complex evolution beyond initial intrusion of basaltic melt.  

The Hole U1473A section has undergone static hydrotherma l alteration, extensive recrystallization associated with crystal-plasti c deformation, and alteration associated with veining and with lat e cataclastic deformation. Static alteration occurs throughout th e hole, ranging from $-3\%$ to $90\%$ , with locally intense veining an d characterized by colorless amphibole, talc, serpentine, and cla y minerals after olivine; however, away from fault zones, much of th e section is very fresh ( $78\%$ with ${<}30\%$ replacement minerals). Formation of near-ubiquitous brown hornblende and secondary clinopyroxene  reflect near-solidus  conditions,  whereas  othe r assemblages reflect amphibolite to sub-greenschist facies. Cla y minerals are the last alteration products, reflecting temperature s $<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Amphibolite facies alteration and overprinting clay mineral formation are significant largely at shallow depths, whereas intervals displaying greenschist facies alteration are found sporadicall y throughout the hole. Carbonate with or without clay and oxidativ e reddish clay replacement of olivine is also more conspicuous in intervals disturbed by faulting, whereas deeper in the hole micro vein s filled with chlorite, with or without amphibole, are more typical.  

Felsic veins in Hole U1473A often have high abundances of secondary sulfides and clay minerals as well as replacement of primar y plagioclase by albitic and occasionally secondary quartz, showin g that these were pathways for large volumes of hydrothermal fluids. This observation was also made for Hole 735B. A key similarity between Holes U1473A, 735B, and 1105A is the occurrence of amphibole veins, which is largely limited to the shallower sections of th e holes.  

Specific objectives of SloMo Leg 1 included drilling through  a magnetic reversal that was projected to lie several hundred meter s below seafloor at Site U1473: from reversely polarized at the surfac e to normally polarized at depth. Virtually all intervals drilled in Hol e U1473A have positive inclinations, indicating, in the Souther n Hemisphere, a reversed polarity magnetization that places the hol e within geomagnetic polarity Chron C5r.3r, as in Hole 735B. Magnetizations are sufficient to account for the observed sea-surfac e anomalies at Atlantis Bank. A clear reversal boundary was no t reached during Expedition 360; however, thermal demagnetizatio n revealed characteristic remanence with negative inclination (normal polarity) in narrow altered intervals in the lower part of th e hole, leading us to suggest that we are entering a reversal transitio n near the bottom of Hole U1473A. Three intervals with statisticall y significant differences in inclination downhole may document differential block rotations due to faulting.  

# Background and objectives  

Expedition 360 constituted the first leg of the multiphase SloM o Project that aims ultimately to drill through the Moho seismic discontinuity at Atlantis Bank at the ultraslow-spreading SWIR (Figur e F1). By penetrating this fundamental seismological boundary, th e SloMo Project will test the hypothesis that the Moho, at least a t slow- and ultraslow-spreading ridges, represents an alteratio n boundary such as the lower limit of mantle lithosphere serpentinization rather than the igneous crust–mantle transition (Figure F2). If the latter, the igneous crust/mantle boundary could lie at an y depth above the seismic boundary.  

The site chosen for this deep drill hole is Atlantis Bank, an elevated flat-topped massif at ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth on the east flank o f the north-south–trending Atlantis II Transform (Figures F1, F3 ) (Dick et al., 1991b). The Moho here lies at ${\sim}5.5~\mathrm{km}$ below the platform summit (Figure F4) (Muller et al., 2000). The principal aim o f Expedition 360 was to drill as deep as possible through lower crusta l gabbro and leave a hole open and ready to be deepened during subsequent expeditions. A target depth of 1300 mbsf was originally estimated, derived from prior experience of drilling conditions a t Atlantis Bank and assuming a nominal 4 days contingency time fo r weather and operational issues; however, this depth was no t achieved largely because the number of days available for corin g during Expedition 360 was substantially less than planned (see Operations in the Site U1473 chapter [MacLeod et al., 2017b]).  

On the basis of local geological knowledge from site survey investigations, it was thought unlikely that the igneous crust/mantl e boundary would be encountered or a significant amount of peridotite recovered during Expedition 360 itself. The aim of future SloM o expeditions is to reoccupy and deepen the hole with the overall goa l of penetrating the crust–mantle transition, which is believed to b e as much as ${\sim}2.5~\mathrm{km}$ above the Moho (see below). Additional drilling, potentially using the riser D/V Chikyu, is likely to be necessar y to penetrate the Moho itself at $\sim\!5\,\mathrm{km}$ below seafloor (Figure F4).  

The SloMo Project is not simply focused on the ultimate goal o f drilling the crust/mantle boundary; equally important is what w e learn on each step of the journey on the way there. By recovering  a substantial section of the igneous lower crust at Atlantis Bank, Expedition 360 was designed to address specific key challenges set ou t in the IODP Science Plan 2013–2023 (http://www.iodp.org/aboutiodp/iodp-science-plan-2013-2023).

ing the consensus of the global ocean drilling community, posit s that in order to understand the inherent connections between th e Earth’s interior and its surface environment we must address fundamental questions about basic plate tectonic processes. Central among these questions are how seafloor spreading and mantle melting lead to the creation of oceanic lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges,

and what controls the architecture of the ocean crust thus forme d (IODP Science Plan Challenge 9). Constraining the composition, diversity, and architecture of the lower ocean crust and shallow mantle  is  critical  to  understanding  the  global  geochemical  cycle, particularly the exchange of heat, mass, and volatiles between th e Earth’s interior, oceans, and atmosphere.  

At  slow-  and  ultraslow-spreading  ridges,  the  lower  crus t uniquely preserves that critical link where magmatic and tectoni c processes directly reflect plate dynamics, melt input, and the mantl e flow pattern. We now know that at such ridges a substantial portio n of plate spreading is accommodated in the lower crust by tectoni c extension due to faulting and, in places, ductile deformation (e.g., Mutter and Karson, 1992). Large-offset “detachment” normal fault s exert a strong control on melt distribution and transport in th e lower crust and its delivery to the seafloor. This is in marked contrast to fast-spreading ridges, where it is accepted that the crus t principally undergoes magmatic accretion by the injection of mel t into the lower crust, diking, and eruption of magmas on the seafloor. Rollover and corner flow by ductile flow accompanying mantle upwelling and plate spreading is believed to be mostly limited t o the mantle; however, at slower spreading ridges, which are coole r and support only ephemeral magma chambers, the lower crust ca n potentially support a shear stress. As a consequence, with lowe r rates of magma supply and colder, stronger lithosphere formed directly beneath the ridge axis, slower spreading ridges have very different morphologies and crustal architectures. Thus, as stated i n IODP Initial Science Plan Challenge 9, a full picture of crustal architecture and accretion can only be drawn if both fast- and slowspreading environments are investigated.  

Specific aims of Expedition 360, the first leg of Phase I of th e SloMo Project, therefore focused on gaining an understanding o f how magmatism and tectonism interact in accommodating seafloo r spreading, how magnetic reversal boundaries are expressed in th e lower crust, assessing the role of the lower crust and shallow mantl e in the global carbon cycle, and constraining the extent and nature o f life at deep levels within the ocean lithosphere. These are explaine d further in Scientific objectives below.  

# Geological setting  

With a full spreading rate of $14\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ the SWIR lies at the slo w end of the mid-ocean-ridge spreading-rate spectrum. The ridg e trends approximately southwest–northeast for most of its length. Between ${\sim}52^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ and $60^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ , the ridge spreads almost due north–south, and it is offset by a series of closely spaced large-offset transfor m faults. One of these, the Atlantis II Transform at $57^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ (Fisher an d Sclater, 1983), offsets the SWIR sinistrally by $200~\mathrm{km}$ (Dick et al., 1991b) (Figure F1). Between this transform and the Novara Transform ${\sim}140\,\mathrm{km}$ to the east, the spreading axis is divided into two segments, AN-1 and AN-2, separated by a $17\,\mathrm{km}$ offset nontransfor m discontinuity at $57^{\circ}40^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ (Mendel et al., 1997; Hosford et al., 2003; Baines et al., 2007). The spreading rate here is asymmetric: at th e short westerly Segment AN-1 adjacent to the northern ridge/transform intersection of the Atlantis II Transform, magnetic anomalie s reveal rates of $8.5\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ to the south and $5.5\:\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ to the north, an d the transform has been lengthening by $3\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ for at least the pas t $20\ \mathrm{My}$ (Dick et al., 1991b; Hosford et al., 2003; Baines et al., 2007). At ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , a $10^{\circ}$ counterclockwise change in regional spreading direction put the Atlantis II Transform into transtension for a perio d of ${\sim}12$ My (Dick et al., 1991b, Hosford et al., 2003; Baines et al., 2007, 2008).  

Immediately to the east of the Atlantis II Transform, parallel t o it and on a flow line directly south of spreading Segment AN-1, is a n elevated transverse ridge (Figure F1). It consists of a series of uplifted blocks connected by saddles that rise to as little as 700 meter s below sea level (mbsl) (Dick et al., 1991b). Atlantis Bank $(32^{\circ}43^{\prime}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $57^{\circ}17^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ forms the shallowest and northernmost portion of thi s ridge, $95\,\mathrm{km}$ south of the SWIR axis (Figures F1, F3). The bank consists of a raised dome ${\sim}40~\mathrm{km}$ long by ${\sim}30~\mathrm{km}$ wide, rising fro m $5700~\mathrm{mbsl}$ at the base of the transform wall to 700 mbsl on a ${\sim}25$ $\mathrm{km^{2}}$ flat-topped wave-cut platform at its crest and then drops t o 4300 mbsl on its eastern flank across two prominent transform-parallel east-dipping normal faults (Dick et al., 1991b; Baines et al., 2003; Hosford et al., 2003).  

Site surveys of the Atlantis Bank area included multibeam, magnetics, and gravity surveys, as well as rock sampling using seabe d rock coring, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), submersible dives, and dredging (Dick et al., 1991b; MacLeod et al., 1998; Arai et al., 2000; Kinoshita et al., 1999; Matsumoto et al., 2002). A high-resolution bathymetric map of the ${\sim}25\,\mathrm{km^{2}}$ summit region compiled fro m narrow-beam echo soundings (Dick et al., 1999) shows the platfor m consists of a broadly flat surface ranging from ${\sim}750$ to $689\;\mathrm{m}$ wate r depth (Figure F5). ROV survey results show the central pavement t o be bare rock, locally knobbly igneous outcrop (largely gabbro) surrounded on its periphery and locally on its surface by limestone, i n some places ripple marked, and carbonate-cemented pebble conglomerate. Morphologically the platform is interpreted as a set o f partially eroded sea stacks surrounded by beach gravel and limestone pavement (see below).

![](images/295dfa8218f3ca7fe769ff14990ccdb98d8875e86c4c6d979b1c32e8a0dfba47.jpg)  

Hole 735B is located at the southwest corner of the relatively fla t surface of the Atlantis Bank platform $(32^{\circ}43.395^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $57^{\circ}15.959^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , 73 1 m water depth) (Figures F3, F5). During Legs 118 and 176, the hol e was drilled to a total of 1508 mbsf with $87\%$ core recovery, all in ${\sim}11$ Ma gabbro (sensu lato) (Robinson, Von Herzen, et al., 1989; Dick e t al., 2000). Subsequently, $158~\mathrm{m}$ deep Hole 1105A was drilled durin g engineering Leg 179 in the center of the platform $(32^{\circ}43.13^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $57^{\circ}16.65^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999), also in gabbro an d with similar overall core recovery rates.  

Employing the British Geological Survey’s $5\,\textrm{m}$ diamond roc k drill and $^{1\mathrm{~m~}}$ “BRIDGE”-oriented corer, RRS James Clark Ross Cruise JR31 drilled 42 successful cores on the surface of this platform region, recovering igneous rocks in 33 of them (Figure F5 ) (MacLeod et al., 1998). The cores reveal continuous gabbro outcro p on the platform surface, with diabase at two locations and serpentinized peridotite along with pillow-basalt breccia drilled at it s southern tip. The latter two cores were drilled where the flat platform narrows into a north–south spine $(32^{\circ}44.5^{\prime}\mathrm{S})$ . Many of th e gabbroic rocks in the shallow drill cores and seen in ROPOS RO V images from the surface of the platform are mylonitic or porphyroclastic, displaying intense crystal-plastic deformation with shallo w fabrics. In Hole 735B, crystal-plastic deformation of oxide gabbr o and olivine gabbro was likewise found to be strong in the uppermost $500\;\mathrm{m}$ but diminished markedly downsection (Robinson, Vo n Herzen, et al., 1989; Cannat et al., 1991; Dick et al., 1991a; Mirand a and John, 2010).  

Considered together, it is apparent that the upper surface of Atlantis Bank represents a detachment fault damage zone representing a high-temperature “plutonic growth fault” active during th e accretion of the gabbroic lower crust and responsible for its exhumation. This “hot” detachment must have rooted at the top of  a continuously replenished crystal mush zone close to the midpoin t of the AN-1 spreading ridge (Dick et al., 1991a, 2000; Natland an d Dick, 2001, 2002). Numerous inliers of dikes intercalated with gabbro occur across the eastern side of the bank (Figure F3), demonstrating that the detachment footwall passed through the zone o f active diking beneath the rift valley (Dick et al., 2008). Magneti c anomalies hosted within the gabbro massif indicate it was expose d on a $38.9\,\mathrm{km}$ continuously slipping fault over 2.7 My, beginning ${\sim}13$ Ma and coinciding with accelerated spreading to ${\sim}17\ \mathrm{mm/y},$ wit h sharply increased asymmetry of $14.1\ \mathrm{mm/y}$ to the south (Baines e t al., 2008). Paleomagnetic remanence inclinations from Holes 735 B and 1105A and JR31 seabed drill cores are consistently ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ steepe r than expected for the latitude of Atlantis Bank and are interprete d on the basis of the oriented BRIDGE drill cores as indicating  a southward tilt of this magnitude subsequent to cooling of the section through the Curie temperature of magnetite $(580^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ (Kikaw a and Pariso, 1991; Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999; Allerton and Tivey, 2001).  

Submersible observations at Atlantis Bank (Kinoshita et al., 1999; Matsumoto et al., 2002) show that the detachment fault surface is preserved over large regions in the deeper waters on bot h sides of the platform. The damage zone and underlying gabbro ar e well exposed by high-angle normal faulting on the eastern side o f the complex and in headwalls of large landslips on the wester n flank. Here, lower temperature fault rocks are present in addition t o the amphibolite facies mylonite. These chloritized and weathere d fault gouge and talc-serpentine schists, preserved locally on th e fault surface (Dick et al., 2001; Miranda and John, 2010), are ver y similar to fault rocks found on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge core complexes (e.g., MacLeod et al., 2002; Escartín et al., 2003, Schroede r and John, $2004;$ Dick et al., 2008).  

The absence of the low-temperature fault rocks on the flat surface of the Atlantis Bank platform compared to its flanks suggest s they may have been removed, a deduction entirely consistent wit h the long-held supposition that Atlantis Bank was once an ocean island and that its flat top results from erosion at sea level followed b y subsidence to its present level (Dick et al., 1991b; Palmiotto et al., 2013). Shallow drilling and dredging on the summit and uppermos t flanks of the Atlantis Bank platform have amply verified this supposition. Indurated carbonates were drilled at 24 sites from the periphery of the platform and were also recovered in dredges from it s flanks (MacLeod et al., 1998, 2000; Palmiotto et al., 2013). Althoug h some (recent) carbonate sand was recovered, most of the sediment s are indurated bioclastic limestone (skeletal packstone to wackestone; MacLeod et al., 2000) of Miocene to Pleistocene age (Palmiotto et al., 2013). The sediments contain abundant macrofauna, primarily bryozoans, mollusks, algal nodules, and echinoids, bu t also some solitary corals. Benthic and, in some instances, larg e planktonic foraminifers are common. Palmiotto et al. (2013) found  a water depth of ${\sim}100{-}200\ \mathrm{m}$ based on assemblages in dredged carbonates from the flanks of the platform, whereas green algal (dasyclad) assemblages in drill cores from the platform summit (G. Dell a Porta and V.P. Wright, pers. comm., 1999; MacLeod et al., 2000) indicate water depths at wave base or shallower, demonstrating tha t the platform was at sea level and probably above. How much material has been removed by subaerial erosion is not known, potentiall y $100{-}200~\mathrm{m}$ with reference to the inferred thickness of the detachment fault damage zone. ROV observations of steep-sided outcrop s on the platform summit and its flanks up to $10\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , locally even $50\,\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ likely represent coastal cliffs and small sea stacks resulting from th e dispersal of wave energy on the flanks of the island during erosion.  

The Atlantis II Transform transverse ridge, on which Atlanti s Bank lies, is clearly analogous to oceanic core complex massif s found on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (e.g., Cann et al., 1997; Tucholke e t al., 1998; MacLeod et al., 2002, 2009; Smith et al., 2006; Dick et al., 2008), although here, as elsewhere along the SWIR (Cannat et al., 2006; Sauter et al., 2013), the prominent spreading direction–parallel corrugations that are characteristic of the flat surfaces of the Atlantic oceanic core complexes are not so obvious and are potentiall y present only on the down-dropped terrace on the eastern side of Atlantis Bank (Figures F1, F3); furthermore, the Atlantis II Transfor m transverse ridge was clearly uplifted far above the surrounding seafloor. Whereas flexural uplift of detachment fault footwalls to for m oceanic core complexes is typically $1\pm0.5\,\mathrm{km}$ relative to surrounding seafloor of similar age (Tucholke et al., 1998; Lavier et al., 1999), the Atlantis II transverse ridge has been uplifted by $3\,\mathrm{km}$ (Baines e t al., 2003). Dick et al. (1991a) and Baines et al. (2003) propose tha t the original detachment-related uplift at the ridge/transform intersection was accentuated by an additional phase of flexural uplift, a s transtension was imparted upon the transform in response to  a spreading direction change on the SWIR at $19.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

One consequence of the Atlantis II transverse ridge relative uplift is that the crust/mantle boundary, as mapped by dredging an d submersible traverses, is exposed along its western wall for a distance of nearly $40\;\mathrm{km}$ (Figure F3). This boundary was encountere d at several locations during Shinkai 6500 dives in landslip headwall s and debris slopes. The boundary lies at ${\sim}4660\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth wes t of the drill sites but shoals considerably $20\,\mathrm{km}$ to the south, where i t was located in outcrop by a Shinkai 6500 dive at $2563\,\mathrm{m}$ water dept h (Kinoshita et al., 1999; Matsumoto et al., 2002). Upslope to the eas t of these dives, Dives 467 and 459 crested the landslip headwalls an d encountered the more gently sloping detachment fault footwall a t 3000 and $1755\ \mathrm{m},$ respectively, potentially indicating gabbro laye r thicknesses as low as 1500 and $2895\;\mathrm{m}$ . Elsewhere along the wester n flank of Atlantis Bank, serpentinized peridotite was recovered i n dredges from as shallow as $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Dredge JR31-DR8), though in other nearby places only at $>\!3000\;\mathrm{m}$ depth. At the southern end of the platform summit itself, serpentinized harzburgit e was drilled at a water depth of $839\;\mathrm{m}$ (Site JR31-BGS12). Highly altered peridotite sampled at several locations above the peridotite/gabbro contact on the transform wall consists largely of talcserpentine schist that likely overlies the gabbro massif. This and th e presence of serpentinized peridotite pebbles in sedimentary (beach ) conglomerates lying on gabbro near the edge of the platform suggest that a discontinuous talc-serpentine sheet was intruded alon g the detachment fault from where the fault cut massive peridotite i n the transform fault zone (Dick et al., 2001). This sheet is now preserved locally on the detachment surface. The serpentinite drilled a t Site JR31-BGS12 on the southern end of the platform, however, i s relatively massive harzburgite with well-preserved pseudomorph s of pyroxene. Possible origins of this particular serpentinite outcro p include a peridotite screen in gabbro similar to those drilled at Atlantis Massif in Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Hole U1309 D (Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006), an enclave of less deformed and altered serpentinized peridotite in the original detachment fault shea r zone, or juxtaposition via a north-dipping ridge-parallel norma l fault that demarcates the southernmost end of the flat platform a t $32^{\circ}44.4^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ .  

A wide-angle seismic refraction survey of the Atlantis II Transform region found the Moho at $5\,\pm\,1\,\,\mathrm{km}$ beneath Atlantis Ban k (Muller et al., 1997, 2000; Minshull et al., 1998) (Figure F4). The direct geological constraints outlined above offer strong support t o the inference that the Moho cannot represent the (petrological ) crust/mantle boundary in this region. Whereas Muller, Minshull, and colleagues also concluded that it could be a serpentinizatio n front, they based this conclusion on the geochemical argument tha t the igneous crustal thickness there was originally ${\sim}4~\mathrm{km}$ (base d upon rare earth element inversions), and with the basaltic carapac e removed by detachment faulting, the remainder was likely to be ${\sim}2$ to $2.5~\mathrm{km}$ thick. However, they admit this interpretation is nonunique, primarily because of the overlap in $P$ -wave seismic velocit y between gabbro and ${\sim}20\%{-}40\%$ partially serpentinized peridotit e (e.g., Miller and Christensen, 1997).  

At what level is the (petrological) crust/mantle boundary likel y to lie beneath Atlantis Bank? Projecting the detachment surface t o the locations of the traversed crust/mantle boundary describe d above indicates that the crustal thickness at these points prior t o mass wasting on the transform wall was significantly $<3\ \mathrm{km},$ whereas the depth to the Moho below the transform wall remain s approximately constant (Figure F4). Assuming that the elevate d core complex massif is produced by flexure during uplift into th e rift-mountains because of a spreading direction change (Baines e t al., 2003), it seems reasonable to conclude that the mapped boundary is most likely to project approximately subhorizontally or eve n be elevated beneath the center of Atlantis Bank, consistent with th e igneous crustal thickness of $2{-}2.5~\mathrm{km}$ suggested by Minshull et al. (1998).  

# Scientific objectives  

Previous ODP operations at Atlantis Bank drilled the $1508\,\mathrm{~m~}$ deep Hole 735B and $158\;\mathrm{m}$ deep Hole 1105A. Both holes recovere d long sections of gabbro, consisting largely of olivine gabbro, subordinate amounts of oxide gabbro, and minor troctolite and leucocratic veins (Dick et al., 1991a, 2000; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999). On the basis of our previous site survey, we selected Sit e AtBk6, located on the northern edge of the Atlantis Bank platfor m $1.4~\mathrm{km}$ north of Hole 1105A and $2.2~\mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of Hol e 735B, as the most suitable location for a deep-penetration drill sit e (Figures F3, F5).  

Three contingency sites identified at Atlantis Bank were Sit e AtBk4 (serpentinized peridotite Site JR31-BR12) at the souther n end of the platform, Site AtBk5 in gabbro at the northern edge of th e platform, and Site AtBk2 in gabbro and dikes at $1700\;\mathrm{m}$ water dept h on the down-dropped terrace east of the main elevated platfor m (Figures F3, F5). These sites were envisaged not as alternatives t o the deep-penetration site but as single-bit spud-ins in case weathe r conditions were not sufficiently calm to allow the hard rock reentr y system to be deployed at the beginning of the cruise.  

Drilling at our principal Site AtBk6 (now Site U1473) during Expedition 360, in lithologies similar to those at previous drill Site s 735 and 1105, was designed to allow us to tackle a number of specific science questions (see below).  

1. What is the igneous stratigraphy of the lower ocean crust?  

Analysis of drilling results in Hole U1473A should allow us t o determine the extent to which the igneous, metamorphic, an d structural stratigraphy found in Holes 735B and 1105A is laterall y continuous across the wave-cut platform on Atlantis Bank. In combination with Holes 735B and 1105A and the existing surface mapping, new drilling should provide a 3-D and possibly 4-D view of th e lateral continuity and evolution of the lower crust and its emplacement process.  

# 2. How much mantle is incorporated into the lower crust?  

An unanticipated finding in cores from Hole U1309D at the Atlantis Massif on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge was the incorporation o f significant volumes of hybridized mantle peridotite within the gabbro section (Blackman et al., 2011; Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006; Drouin et al., 2009). Comparable screens of mantle rock wer e not found in either Holes 735B or 1105A. Does this reflect a profound difference between the two different mid-ocean ridges, perhaps  due  to different  magma  budgets, thermal structure,  o r accretion mechanisms, or is it simply happenstance that they wer e not encountered during previous drilling at Atlantis Bank?  

3. What are the modes of melt transport into and through the lower crust?  

Several different modes of melt delivery and transport were proposed on the basis of observations from Hole 735B cores. Thes e modes include small intrusive cumulate bodies, larger intrusiv e units on the scale of hundreds of meters, anastomosing channel s produced by focused flow and melt-rock reaction, and compactio n of late iron titanium–rich melts into shear zones where they hybridized olivine gabbro to iron titanium oxide–rich gabbro and gabbronorite. The continuity and scale of these features cannot b e determined from a single deep hole. Results of Expedition 360 drilling should further document the extent and proportion of these features in a younger section of the massif.  

4. How does the lower crust shape the composition of MORB?  

The complex stratigraphies found in Holes 735B and U1309 D differ in significant ways. What common factors, however, influenc e the composition of MORB? As in Hole 735B, recent work on gabbroic sections from the East Pacific Rise shows that the lower crus t acted as a reactive porous filter homogenizing diverse melts tha t were intruded into it and modifying their trace element content s prior to their eruption to the seafloor (Lissenberg et al., 2013). T o what extent does this processes operate uniformly at slower spreading rates?  

# 5. What is the strain distribution in the lower crust during asymmetric seafloor spreading?  

Asymmetric spreading produced by detachment faulting is no w recognized as one of three major accretionary modes at slowspreading ridges (symmetric, asymmetric, and amagmatic rifting). Although each of these is important, little is known of how magmatism and tectonism interact, and hence how lower crustal accretio n differs in these environments. To date we have been able to determine strain distributions with depth in two deep holes (Holes 735 B and U1309D) in two different oceanic core complexes (Atlanti s Bank on the SWIR and Atlantis Massif on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge ) and found them to differ significantly: far more intense crystal-plastic deformation is found in the upper $500\mathrm{~m~}$ of Hole 735B than i n Hole U1309D (Figure F6). We cannot assess the nature, extent,  

Figure F6. Running average $(20\,\mathsf{m})$ of lithologies, crystal-plastic deformation intensity, and whole-rock Mg# $([M\mathfrak{g}\times100]/[\mathsf{M}\mathfrak{g}+\mathsf{F e}])$ for Holes 735B and U1309 D (Mid-Atlantic Ridge at $30^{\circ}\mathsf{N}$ ), modified from Dick et al. (2000), Blackman et al. (2011), and Expedition 304/305 Scientists (2006). Symbols in whole-rock Mg # diagram represent different lithologies based on modal mineralogy; definitions can be found in the Leg 118 and 176 Initial Reports volumes (Robinson, Vo n Herzen, et al., 1989; Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999) and the Expedition 304/305 Proceedings volume (Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, an d the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006). These sections represent descriptions from two different scientific parties, and although both followed America n Geophysical Institute conventions on nomenclature, exact definitions for each lithology described may vary. Lithologic plots differ from those previously presented, as the lithologies from both holes were grouped in the same manner to facilitate comparison. Gray dotted lines at ${\sf M g}\#=80$ emphasize overall chemical differences between the sections. Primary melts emerging from the mantle would be in equilibrium with gabbroic cumulates and dunites with an Mg# $\geq$ 90, largely missing from both sections.

and/or role played by high-temperature deformation during lowe r crustal accretion with isolated 1-D sections. Offsetting and drillin g north of Hole 735B allows determination of the continuity of strai n distribution from Holes 735B and 1105A across the Atlantis Ban k core complex and thereby assessment of the role and broader significance of synmagmatic deformation in this tectonic environment.  

# 6. What is the nature of magnetic anomalies?  

An important goal of Expedition 360 was to drill through a magnetic reversal boundary in oceanic crust for the first time and to determine what controls magnetic anomalies in plutonic rocks.  

Magnetic anomaly “stripes” are detectable across the Atlantis I I transverse ridge, including Atlantis Bank and its wave-cut platfor m (Dick et al., 1991b; Allerton and Tivey, 2001; Hosford et al., 2003; Baines et al., 2007, 2008). Whereas most of the platform is reversel y magnetized, as are the gabbro intervals of Holes 735B and 1105 A (Kikawa and Pariso, 1991), a narrow normal polarity zone ${\sim}2~\mathrm{km}$ wide is present near its northern end. This zone is equated to anomaly Chron C5r.2n (11.592–11.647 Ma; Allerton and Tivey, 2001; Baines et al., 2008) (Figure F7). The zone is detectable in sea-surfac e (Dick et al., 1991b; Hosford et al., 2003) and deep-towed magneti c profiles (Allerton and Tivey, 2001), as well as in the JR31 seabed dril l cores; however, the precise location of the boundary in each case i s slightly offset. Because the sea-surface magnetization signal is derived from a much greater volume of rock than the near-bottom signal in the cores, Allerton and Tivey (2001) deduced from the sens e of offset that the magnetic anomaly boundaries are inclined. The y modeled the southern limit of the anomaly as a planar boundar y dipping ${\sim}25^{\circ}$ toward the south, suggesting that the surface represented either an isotherm corresponding to the Curie point or th e edge of an intrusion. Alternatively, the form of the southern edge o f the anomaly may have been modified by faulting: extensive brittl e deformation and cataclasis is observed in shallow drill cores fro m the location of the southern reversal boundary, possibly corresponding to a north-dipping east-west–striking normal fault at th e kink/narrowing of the platform summit at $32^{\circ}41.8^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ . If so, the reversal boundary is likely to dip more steeply than the $25^{\circ}$ proposed b y Allerton and Tivey (2001). For this reason, Hole U1473A was site d at the northern end of the main platform, just south of this normal fault, to encounter the reversal boundary at as a shallow a depth a s possible.  

# 7. What is the role of the lower crust and shallow mantle in the global carbon cycle?  

Under certain conditions, serpentinization and weathering o f ultramafic rocks as well as alteration of basalts are known to caus e

![](images/0c347d8dd23fda4adcec51c62158de3e3d4b4f4e95b40f5db1a82da2b8edd95b.jpg)  
the formation of carbonates. Such carbonates are present in th e form of extensive veining in serpentinized peridotite at the souther n edge  of the  Atlantis  Bank  platform (shallow  drill Site  JR31- BGS12/contingency drill Site AtBk4) and in partially serpentinize d and weathered peridotite from the southern transform wall a t $32^{\circ}50^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ (Kaiko ROV Dives 173 and 174).  

The extent of these reactions in the lower crust is largely unknown to date. We do not expect that carbon sequestration will be  a significant process in the lower ocean crust based on Holes 735 B and U1309D; however, the possibility exists that Expedition 36 0 may penetrate the base of the lower ocean crust, and thus offer th e first opportunity to determine if carbon sequestration is significan t in the mantle below it.  

# 8. Is there life in the lower crust and hydrated mantle?  

A primary objective of the SloMo Project is to determine the microbiology of the lower crust, the potential serpentinized mantl e above the Moho, and the underlying mantle to address IODP Science Plan Challenge 6 “What are the limits of life in the subseafloor?”  

Starting in the 1990s, microbiologists accompanying ODP an d Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions have documente d the presence of microbial life in deeply buried sediment and the basaltic basement (Fisk et al., 1998; Parkes et al., 1994; Mason et al., 2010). Evidence for active microbial life has been detected as dee p as 2458 mbsf (Inagaki et al., 2015), and the introduction of molecular biology into marine ecology has led to great advances in our understanding of microbial life below the seafloor (Biddle et al., 2008; Cowen et al., 2003; Inagaki et al., 2006; Mason et al., 2010; Edgcom b et al., 2011; Orsi et al., 2013a, 2013b). Much of the microbiolog y performed during ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions has concentrated on sediment (e.g., ODP Leg 201 to th e Peru margin), with the notable exception of expeditions to the Jua n de Fuca Ridge (Cowen et al., 2003; Lever et al., 2013; Jungbluth et al., 2013), Atlantis Massif (Mason et al., 2010), North Pond (Orcutt e t al., 2013), and Louisville Seamounts (Sylvan et al., 2015).  

Because it was never expected that mantle rocks would be encountered during the first phase of SloMo, the aim of microbiolog y sampling during Expedition 360 was to explore for evidence of microbial life at depth within the crystalline lower oceanic crust, abou t which little is known. It is nevertheless possible that indirect inferences may be drawn as to the likely processes at work at greate r depths from a microbial perspective based on postcruise analysis o f gabbros drilled during the expedition. Olivine-rich gabbros can hos t serpentinization, a process that produces hydrogen, which ca n serve as an electron donor for microbial metabolism. Serpentinization can also be an abiotic methanogenic process through Fische r Tropsch type reactions $\mathrm{{CO}_{2}}$ reduction with $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in aqueous solution; Proskurowski et al., 2008), thus potentially providing an additional source of carbon (in addition to carbon dioxide that may be present ) for life in the deep crust. Complex organic matter and lipids in serpentinites suggest microorganisms inhabit mantle rock exhumed a t the seafloor (Delacour et al., 2008; Ménez et al., 2012). In cores fro m Hole U1309D (Atlantis Massif), small subunit ribosomal RNA gen e sequence analyses indicated that heterotrophic microorganisms putatively capable of hydrocarbon oxidation are present in lowe r crustal rocks (Mason et al., 2010). Delacour et al. (2008) point ou t that organics in these systems likely have both biotic and abioti c sources. Abiotic synthesis of organics during serpentinization is  a way of providing energy to deep-seated communities, but inorgani c redox fluid-mineral reactions may also be mined directly for metabolic energy (e.g., Shock, 2009). Apart from energy constraints, permeability  and  the  distribution  of  fluid  flow  impose  stron g constraints on the presence and activity of subseafloor life, an d these factors can only be accurately determined by drilling. Durin g Expedition 360, microbiologists focused on exploring evidence o f life using culture-based approaches, molecular analyses, microscopy, and enzyme assays. Efforts were focused on rock section s showing evidence of alteration or fracturing within all lithologie s encountered.  

# Site survey  

The broad location of the deep-penetration SloMo legacy hol e that was envisaged to be drilled during Expedition 360 was th e north central part of Atlantis Bank, south of the inferred north-dipping fault that coincides with the bathymetric offset of the platfor m at $32^{\circ}42^{\prime}{\mathrm{S}}$ . We believed this location would be away from the influence of the fault zone yet close to the inferred south-dipping magnetic reversal boundary, and it would be sufficiently distant fro m Holes 735B and 1105A to allow us to assess kilometer-scale variability of magmatic and tectonic processes associated with lowe r crustal accretion.  

The site selected for deep drilling (proposed Site AtBk6) wa s cored during the 1998 site survey Cruise JR31 as Site JR31-BR8, determined to be located at $32^{\circ}42.3402^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $57^{\circ}16.6910^{\prime}\mathrm{E},$ , on the basis o f an acoustic transponder network deployed during Cruise JR31 o n the James Clark Ross (MacLeod et al., 1998). From a seafloor photograph taken from the BRIDGE drill camera the site was deemed t o be part of an extensive bare-rock pavement outcrop (Figure F8) . Drill Core JR31-BR8 consisted of $1.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of oxide-bearing olivin e gabbronorite with a thin mylonitic shear zone.  

Following the transit from Sri Lanka, we headed directly for Sit e AtBk6. Once on site, an advanced piston corer (APC)/extended cor e barrel (XCB) bit, bit sub, drill collars, and 5 inch drill pipe assembl y was assembled and lowered to 668 meters below rig floor (mbrf). The subsea camera system was installed and lowered to just abov e the bit to conduct a survey to select a site appropriate for drilling. The survey strategy was to proceed in a square “spiral” pattern increasing at $10\,\mathrm{m}$ intervals away from the Site AtBk6 start point unti l a sufficiently flat bare-rock spot at least $5\textrm{m}$ in diameter was located. The drill pipe and camera were raised and lowered by up t o several meters as required by the seafloor morphology.  

No suitable site was found at Site $_\mathrm{AtBk6}$ or during the initial 5 0 $\mathrm{~m~}\times\,50\mathrm{~m~}$ survey (Figure F9); rather than the bare-rock pavemen t photographed at Site JR31-BR8, we observed white sediment plu s scattered dark (gabbro) blocks on a near-flat surface deepenin g slightly to the northwest (Figures F9, F10A–F10B). The reason fo r the disparity with what was previously observed at apparently th e exact same location is not known but probably indicates some absolute offset of some tens of meters in the navigation of the JR31 transponder survey.  

The initial $50\mathrm{~m}\times50\mathrm{~m}$ survey spiral revealed a dense boulde r field and possible outcrop at the southwestern corner of the box; accordingly, the survey was extended south and southwest by a further $50\,\mathrm{m}$ . Within this area, an irregular steep-sided outcrop of dar k gabbro was identified, north-northwest elongated, ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ wide b y ${>}60\;\mathrm{m}$ long, and rising abruptly by as much as ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m}$ above the surrounding carbonate sediment-covered seafloor. The top of this outcrop was flat and formed either of bare gabbro exposures or by  a thin cap of indurated carbonate. After further investigation of th e flat bare-rock pavement after $5.5\;\mathrm{h}$ of survey, a suitable location fo r Hole U1473A was found (Figure F10E–F10F) at $32^{\circ}42.3622^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $057^{\circ}16.6880^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ $710.2\;\mathrm{mbsl}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ), $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ south of the original start point.

Hole U1473A is located at $32^{\circ}42.3622^{\prime}{\mathrm{S}}~57^{\circ}16.6880^{\prime}{\mathrm{E}},$ , in 710. 2 m water depth on the north central part of Atlantis Bank, $2.2~\mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of Hole 735B and $1.4~\mathrm{km}$ north of Hole 1105A. During Expedition 360, Hole U1473A was drilled to a total depth o f $789.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, recovering $469.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of core with an average of $59\%$ recovery over the entire interval $(\mathrm{>}96\%$ over the lower $200\mathrm{~m~}$ of th e hole; Table T1). This constitutes the deepest igneous rock penetration from the seafloor during a single scientific ocean drilling expedition to date.  

# Igneous petrology  

Hole U1473A cores are composed of a variety of gabbroic lithologies, from primitive olivine gabbros to evolved oxide-rich gabbros, cut by felsic veins $(\sim\!1.5\%$ of the total), as well as a smal l number of diabase dikes. Eight lithologic units were defined withi n the gabbroic sequence, primarily on the basis of changes in minera l modes, grain size, and texture but also based on the presence an d relative importance of other igneous features such as igneous layer  

Primary magmatic textures of gabbros to ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) are heavily modified or in man y cases erased by intense crystal-plastic deformation; when preserved, primary textures are mostly subophitic and locally granular. The main lithology is olivine gabbro $(76.5\%)$ , followed in abundanc e by disseminated-oxide gabbro $(9.5\%$ ; oxide content between $1\%$ an d $2\%$ ), gabbro (sensu stricto; $5.1\%$ ), oxide gabbro $(3.7\%$ ; oxide conten t ${>}5\%$ ), oxide-bearing gabbro $(3.7\%$ ; oxide content between $2\%$ an d $5\%)$ ), and felsic veins $\left(1.5\%\right)$ . Oxide abundance decreases slightl y downhole, with the exception of the lowermost intervals (deepe r than ${\sim}650\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ ) within which a larger proportion of oxide-bearing lithologies was recovered. Oxide-bearing gabbro and oxide gabbro are usually characterized by strong localized crystal-plasti c deformation; however, in contrast, those in the deepest part of Hol e U1473A (Unit VIII) are essentially undeformed. Formation of oxid e gabbro is most likely related to the percolation of late-stage melt s through an existing olivine gabbro framework, an inference that i s supported by the near-ubiquitous presence of interstitial brown am

phibole and rims around clinopyroxene and/or olivine. When located around olivine, brown amphibole is also associated wit h orthopyroxene rims. These late-stage melt-related features are les s abundant in undeformed samples from the deeper levels of the hole. Felsic veins consist of leucodiorite, quartz diorite, diorite, trondhjemite, and rare tonalite, locally containing oxide minerals. The y tend to be concentrated in specific zones or horizons, with trondhjemite predominating deeper than $500\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF.  

Several dikelike bodies of diabase were found at various depth s in Hole U1473A. They intrude gabbros that had experienced previous crystal-plastic deformation under conditions ranging fro m granulite down to amphibolite facies. Most of the dikes have diabasic textures; however, the larger granulite facies dikes have local assemblages  of  granoblastic  brown  amphibole,  plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene near their contacts with the gabbro, reflecting recrystallization, likely at $800^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ or higher. Likely associated  centimeter-scale  dikelets  may  consist  entirely  of  th e granulite assemblage. From textural relationships, some dikes appear to have locally partially melted the adjacent gabbro to form th e felsic veins.

Igneous layering, defined by modal and grain size variation, is well developed in Units II and VII (91.29–175 and $577.68–642\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, respectively). Grain size variability in the layering is generally also accompanied by modal variation. In most cases, contacts between different layers are subparallel to each other, though less commonly irregular contacts are also found. The dominant olivine gabbro is largely coarse grained but locally displays considerable variability, ranging from fine to very coarse grained. Grain size variations in olivine gabbro may be locally associated with igneous layering but are mainly found within irregular olivine gabbro domains with sutured contacts. The degree to which the igneous layering here and in Holes 735B and 1105A can be interpreted in terms of magmatic sedimentation as seen in layered intrusions is problematic and often appears to be the product of processes such as latestage melt-rock interaction, focused melt flow through a crystal mush, or melts migrating along zones of deformation.  

In several respects Hole U1473A displays close similarities to the other two holes drilled at Atlantis Bank (Holes 735B and 1105A;  

Dick et al., 2000; Casey et al., 2007) (Figure F12). Similar igneous processes operated in the genesis of the plutonic section as a whole. Most striking is the first-order observation that the plutonic sections in Holes 735B and U1473A are mainly composed of olivine gabbro $(>\!75\%)$ with numerous intercalations of gabbros containing oxides $.\mathord{\sim}15\%$ of the sections). The level and volume of oxide and disseminated-oxide gabbros vary considerably between the Atlantis Bank drill sites. It is probable that more of the section was removed by erosion at Site U1473 compared to Site 735, making direct correlation of the sections relative to the detachment fault surface difficult. Intensely deformed and/or oxide-rich intervals are abundant in the upper portion of Hole 735B and decrease rapidly deeper than $600~\mathrm{{mbsf}}_{\mathrm{{}}}$ ; they are abundant in $158\,\mathrm{~m~}$ deep Hole 1105A, and although present in Hole U1473A, they occur intermittently downhole with a larger abundance of the related disseminated-oxide gabbro.  

Felsic rocks are also found ubiquitously across Atlantis Bank (e.g., Baines et al., 2008) and at all three drill sites. These rocks are represented by veins or patches that are reported to be associated with oxide gabbros in Hole 735B (Dick et al., 2000) and with olivine gabbro in Hole 1105A (Casey et al., 2007) but are found associated with or cutting both rock types in Hole U1473A. Locally, some dike margins are invaded by felsic melts that were most likely generated by contact metamorphism of the previously hydrothermally altered host gabbro. Other felsic veins may be the product of extreme fractionation of the gabbroic melts or even local anatexis of gabbros due to subsequent gabbro intrusive cycles (e.g., Koepke et al., 2004).  

Troctolite and troctolitic gabbro found in Hole 735B and, in the first case, interpreted as representing injection of primitive melts into the crystallizing olivine gabbros, were not encountered in Hole U1473A.  

Another common feature of the three holes drilled at Atlantis Bank is the occurrence of $100{-}400\;\mathrm{m}$ thick igneous lithologic units defined by variations in texture, grain size, mode, and geochemical composition. These units are mirrored by variations in whole-rock geochemical compositions, which reveal apparent upward-differentiating geochemical trends, as defined by decreases in Mg# and Cr and Ni contents and increases in Y (Figure F13) (see Geochemistry below). Each of the lithologic units is in turn characterized by internal heterogeneity in composition and texture on a meter or even centimeter scale, seen in Hole 735B and U1473A cores. This heterogeneity was likely governed by complex interplay between magmatic  processes,  such  as  new  melt  injections,  fractional crystallization, melt-rock reaction, and late-stage melt migration with deformation. It is not clear, however, whether these units represent progressive fractional crystallization of a melt or simply compaction of late interstitial melts moving up through the section.  

Taken as a whole, the igneous stratigraphies of Holes 735B, 1105A, and U1473A document directly comparable processes that occurred at all three locations over a lateral scale of $>\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ and vertical scale of ${\ge}1.5~\mathrm{km}$ . This leads us to suggest that this portion of the Atlantis Bank plutonic section is relatively homogeneous laterally. Key features are (i) the occurrence of olivine gabbro as the principal lithology; (ii) the ubiquitous presence of disseminated-oxide, oxide-bearing, and oxide gabbros and their greater abundance at the shallower structural levels; and (iii) the presence of ${\sim}100{-}400\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick olivine gabbro units showing upward-differentiated geochemical trends that may represent discrete magma bodies. Whereas the different drill holes display striking similarities between each other overall, we do not attempt to correlate specific igneous units directly from hole to hole; instead, we prefer to emphasize the similarity in overall igneous accretion processes and gross stratigraphy.

How applicable are the conclusions we draw from drilling at Atlantis Bank to other oceanic core complex gabbro massifs or, indeed, plutonic accretion processes at (slow-spreading) mid-ocea n ridges in general? In partial answer to this question, we compare th e igneous architecture documented at Atlantis Bank with that of th e gabbro body drilled at Atlantis Massif, the oceanic core complex a t  

$30^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Hole U1309D; Blackman et al., 2011; Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006). The most striking difference is related to the lithologic variability of the two sections. I n particular, Atlantis Bank is dominated either by olivine gabbro o r oxide-bearing gabbro (only), whereas Atlantis Massif contains  a much broader range of lithologies, with a dominant lithology o f  

Figure F14. Downhole variations in alteration intensity, reddish clay after olivine, magmatic veins, and vein filling minerals, Hole U1473A. A critical point here i s that alteration intensity is the sum of several processes affecting cores. For example, plagioclase alteration includes dynamically recrystallized plagioclas e (neoblasts), as well as that produced by hydrothermal alteration, which cannot be confidently separated macroscopically, whereas pyroxene and olivine alteration does not include secondary clinopyroxene and olivine, as these cannot be easily separated macroscopically. A key point here is that there is almost n o portion of Hole U1473A cores that has not undergone substantial dynamic and/or hydrothermal modification. Alteration intensity: $0=<\!3\%_{\ast}$ , $1=3\%{-}9\%$ , $^{2=}$ $10\%{-}29\%,$ $3=30\%{-}59\%,$ , $4=60\%{-}90\%$ , $5=>\!90\%$ . Vein filling proportion: $0=<\!10\%,$ , $1=10\%{-}29\%$ , $2=30\%{-}59\%_{}$ , $3=60\%{-90\%}$ , $4=>\!90\%$ .

gabbro (sensu stricto; Figure F12) rather than olivine gabbro an d lesser amounts of olivine gabbro and oxide gabbros. An even mor e significant difference is the abundance of troctolite and the presence of relict mantle peridotite horizons in Hole U1309D. Particularly significant are olivine-rich troctolites formed by reaction o f mantle peridotite with basalt melt (e.g., Drouin et al., 2009), as wel l as minor dunite between the gabbro bodies, which were not foun d at Atlantis Bank. These major differences in igneous stratigraphy a t Atlantis Bank and Atlantis Massif demonstrate that significant variability exists in the mode of accretion and internal differentiation o f magmatic bodies in the lower crust between oceanic core complexes, likely reflecting variations in magma supply and accompanying tectonic setting, spreading rate, and thermal regime along ocea n ridges.  

# Metamorphic petrology  

Hole U1473A gabbros show three distinct modes of alteration: (1) static hydrothermal alteration, (2) alteration associated wit h crystal-plastic deformation, and (3) alteration associated with cataclastic deformation. Overall, the mineral assemblages in Hol e U1473A range from a high-temperature granulite to amphibolite facies assemblage, lower temperature greenschist to zeolite facies, and very low temperature alteration principally including carbonates and clays and mixed-layer smectites. In this, the alteration assemblages are very similar to Holes 735B and 1105A (Dick et al., 1991a, 2000; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller et al., 1999).  

Static background alteration in Hole U1473A is pervasive, wit h alteration mineral abundance estimated from macroscopic description ranging from $-3\%$ to $90\%$ (Figure F14). Although alteratio n mineral abundance may locally exceed $60\%$ in intervals of intens e veining or faulting $4\%$ of Hole U1473A cores), in $78\%$ of cores background alteration mineral abundance is ${<}30\%$ . This is very similar t o the figure for Hole 1105A ( $83\%$ of cores contain ${<}30\%$ backgroun d alteration). Holes U1473A and 1105A appear to be more altere d overall than Hole 735B. Although directly comparable quantitativ e data are not currently available for Hole 735B, Dick et al. (2000) report long intervals with $-5\%$ background alteration for the lowe r $1000\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of the hole, and, notably, greenschist facies alteration i s near-absent throughout (Dick et al., 1991a, 2000).  

Static alteration minerals in Hole U1473A consist mainly o f (i) colorless amphibole, talc, serpentine, and clay minerals after olivine; (ii) secondary clinopyroxene and brown to green or colorles s amphibole after clinopyroxene; (iii) colorless amphibole and talc after orthopyroxene; and (iv) secondary plagioclase and chlorite afte r primary plagioclase. These minerals occur in different abundance s in each core or hand specimen and indicate variable temperatur e conditions for alteration. Textural relationships document overprinting of lower temperature over higher temperature assemblage s during the gabbroic sequence cooling. The formation of the secondary clinopyroxene and brown amphibole association most likel y took place at near-solidus temperatures $(>\!800^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Brownish gree n and green amphibole and tremolite/actinolite $^+$ chlorite $\pm$ talc assemblages formed at amphibolite to greenschist facies metamorphic  conditions $(700^{\circ}{-}400^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ .  The  assemblage  of  secondar y plagioclase $^+$ chlorite $^+$ pale green amphibole (actinolite) with minor amounts of zoisite and titanite indicates greenschist facies conditions $(450^{\circ}{-}350^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Serpentinization of olivine most likely too k place at temperatures in the range $350^{\circ}{-}200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (i.e., lower tha n greenschist facies alteration but higher than that of clay mineral formation). Clay minerals are the latest products of alteration at lowes t temperatures $(<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Downhole trends in background alteratio n correlate with the distribution of metamorphic veins outlined below.  

Amphibole veins and amphiboles replacing primary mafic minerals are dominant at shallower levels $(<\!240\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF})$ ), as they are i n Hole 735B, whereas carbonate or carbonate-clay veins are conspicuous at 180–580 m CCSF (Figure F14). Oxidative reddish clay-mineral replacement of primary minerals is also significant from th e seafloor to $580\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ . In these intervals, it is common that millimeter-wide veins have alteration halos that are up to centimeter s wide. At deeper levels $\left(>580\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}\right)$ ), micro veins filled with chlorite $\pm$ amphibole are more abundant than the millimeter-wide veins. Felsic veins are typically more altered than host gabbros. Th e most apparent feature is the replacement of primary plagioclase, and sometimes quartz, by secondary plagioclase, which has a characteristic whitish milky appearance and often has fluid inclusions. Together with association of a relatively high abundance of secondary sulfide and patches of clay minerals in these veins, this implie s that the felsic veins were pathways for large volumes of hydrothermal fluids, as also found in Hole 735B (Dick et al., 1991a), particularly  at  lower  temperatures  (sub-greenschist  facies).  Loca l occurrence of biotite in host gabbros is evidence for metasomati c alteration related to felsic vein intrusion.  

Much of the Hole U1473A gabbroic sequence has been subjected to crystal-plastic deformation. In the upper portion of th e hole, static background alteration of these porphyroclastic and mylonitic rocks tends to be high, with much (green to brown-green ) amphibole, making identification of the synkinematic mineral assemblages difficult. Deeper in the hole, where background alteration is typically much less, the plastically deformed rocks ar e characterized  by  neoblasts  of  olivine,  plagioclase,  and  clinopyroxene with minor brown amphibole and Fe-Ti oxide minerals. This mineral assemblage, effectively granulite facies, indicates deformation at near-solidus temperature conditions $(>\!800^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Lowe r temperature amphibolite facies crystal-plastic deformation tends t o be present in the form of discrete high-strain mylonitic shear zone s largely composed of brown-green hornblende and plagioclase. The y are commonly associated with local concentrations of Fe-Ti oxides. The amphibolite facies mineral assemblage also occurs in halos associated with amphibole veins, some of which themselves displa y evidence of minor crystal-plastic deformation (see below). Amphibolite mylonites and amphibole vein halos show cooling of the gabbroic sequence to temperature conditions around the ductile– brittle transition $({\sim}700^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ .  

Intervals recording intense cataclastic deformation have abundant carbonate and brownish clay mineral(s). Clays and carbonate s show textural relationships indicative of their simultaneous formation, and some of the carbonates show a signature of plastic deformation. These observations show that cataclastic deformation too k place in association with alteration at low temperatures $(<\!150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ .  

# Structural geology  

The internal structure of the Hole U1473A cores reflects a complex interplay of magmatic and tectonic processes that span a broa d range of temperatures, from contemporaneous magmatic intrusio n and high-temperature crystal-plastic deformation down to late lowtemperature brittle faulting. As a whole, Hole U1473A samples  a $600\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick zone of intense crystal-plastic deformation cut by  a later brittle high-angle fault zone with a damage zone that extend s to ${\sim}570\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ . The variety, distribution, and intensity of the preserved structures are consistent with synkinematic exhumation an d cooling in the Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex.  

Undeformed parts of Hole U1473A cores preserve weakly developed magmatic fabrics defined by the shape-preferred orientatio n (SPO) of plagioclase crystals and decimeter-scale igneous layering. The transition from magmatic flow to solid-state crystal-plastic deformation is marked by an increase in plagioclase recrystallizatio n and common development of tapered twins and undulose extinction.  

Crystal-plastic deformation is extensively developed throughou t Hole U1473A, particularly in the top $600\;\mathrm{m}$ . In moderate to intens e crystal-plastic deformation zones, the relationship of magmatic fabrics to crystal-plastic fabrics (CPFs) is obscured. In detail, the deformation is heterogeneous with meter- to 10 meter–scale zones o f dominantly porphyroclastic shear zones (CPF intensity $=3$ ) separated by relatively weakly deformed gabbros. Locally, deformatio n intensity increases and true mylonitic zones (CPF intensity $=4$ ) ca n be found at ${\sim}200{-}210$ and ${\sim}220{-}230\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. Rare thin ultramylonites (CPF intensity $=\,5$ ) are heterogeneously developed an d commonly crosscut the porphyroclastic foliation. The dip of th e CPFs is typically shallow, in the range $10^{\circ}{-}40^{\circ}$ , although, locally, th e dip can progressively increase and steepen to vertical. Folding of th e fabrics is more common in the upper part of the core. Shear sens e indicators are dominantly (apparent) reversed, an observation confirmed by analysis of shear sense indicators in thin sections. Even i n those intervals that display little or no macroscopically visible crystal-plastic deformation, thin sections generally reveal weak crystalplastic overprints in the form of narrow zones of incipient plagioclase recrystallization, especially at the boundaries of pyroxen e crystals, and pyroxene microfracturing.  

Weak to moderate CPFs commonly have strong SPO defined b y large elongated plagioclase and pyroxene crystals. Given the limite d amount of recrystallization observed, it appears unlikely that ductile deformation could have caused the alignment of the larger crystals. Therefore, it is more likely that plagioclase and pyroxene wer e originally aligned by magmatic flow and subsequently overprinte d by localized crystal-plastic deformation. Additionally, the grain siz e layering may have acted as a favored planar anisotropy for subse

quent CPF to nucleate. In some examples, the layering has a stron g crystal-plastic overprint, particularly when the layering has a moderate dip. In other examples, the layering is “necked” and truncate d by ductile shear zones.  

The conditions over which ductile deformation occurred i n Hole U1473A range from near-solidus granulite grade to amphibolite grade (see Metamorphic petrology). The distribution of amphibole within mylonites is not restricted to the top of the hole an d extends to at least ${\sim}670\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ Several examples of multiple generations of CPFs with variations in shear sense, dip magnitude, di p direction, and metamorphic grade can be observed in Hole U1473 A cores. In some examples, the older mylonite has moderate dip an d apparent reversed shear sense, whereas the younger crosscuttin g mylonite has subhorizontal dip and apparent normal shear sense. I n others, moderately dipping reversed sense porphyroclastic fabric s are crosscut by subvertical normal sense mylonites. In each case, amphibole is more prevalent in the younger crosscutting fabric. Th e deformation mechanisms remain the same during granulite an d amphibolite grade deformation and are dominated by subgrain rotation recrystallization. This variability in crosscutting relationship s indicates a changing strain field through time, with the early CPF s primarily preserving granulite conditions, whereas the younger fabrics reflect amphibolite facies conditions. That the differences i n metamorphic facies may be associated with differences in shea r zone orientation and shear sense does not accord with the prediction of simple extension at the ridge axis suggests that the lowe r oceanic crust deformation path is complex and protracted.  

Evidence exists for contemporaneous brittle and crystal-plasti c deformation. Fractures in clinopyroxene in Hole U1473A gabbro s are filled with plagioclase crystals, whereas magmatic ilmenite locally fills cracks in both plagioclase and pyroxene porphyroclasts, indicating that melt was present while fracturing occurred. This ca n reasonably be anticipated where the crystal/melt ratio is high, as  a load-bearing framework can form that can accommodate strain b y brittle deformation (Handy et al., 2007). In other examples, plagioclase porphyroclasts have fractures filled with fine-grained recrystallized plagioclase indicating that plagioclase was capable o f deforming contemporaneously by brittle (i.e., fracturing) and ductile (i.e., recrystallization) deformation mechanisms. These feature s have been described in granitoids (e.g., Blumenfeld and Bouchez, 1988) and are interpreted as the transition from magmatic to crystal-plastic conditions, during which submagmatic to crystal-plasti c foliations may develop.  

Amphibole veins, both brown (hornblende) and pale green (actinolite), exhibit a wide variety of crosscutting relationships wit h CPFs. Amphibole veins commonly cut crystal-plastic foliation a t high angle and may transpose (bend) an older CPF, indicating tha t vein formation occurred at moderate to high temperatures. In othe r cases, older CPFs may be simply offset across an amphibole vein, suggesting relatively lower temperature deformation. The relationship between CPFs and veins is complex (Figures F15, F16). CPF s are overprinted and offset by brittle fractures and local faults wit h dominantly apparent normal shear sense; however, apparent reversed shear sense is also observed in brittle structures. In mos t cases, the fractures and faults within plagioclase and pyroxene ar e filled with amphibole. These microstructural relationships sugges t that the brittle-ductile overprint occurred at lower temperatures, mainly ranging from amphibolite to greenschist facies conditions. Some of the shear zones contain Fe-Ti oxides, which are significantly weaker compared to silicate phases (e.g., Till and Moskowitz, 2013). We suggest that discrete parts of the shear zone were still deforming by ductile deformation mechanisms, whereas other zone s were deforming by fracturing. The resulting microstructures ar e characterized by coeval ductile and brittle deformation mechanism s that were activated by variations in the thermal gradient, composition, and grain size.

Black curve $=11$ -point running average, horizontal dash-dotte d lines $=$ fault zone locations.  

Fe-Ti  oxide–rich  domains  are  heterogeneously  distribute d throughout Hole U1473A, as demonstrated by the distribution o f magnetic susceptibility, which is an approximation for the proportion of Fe-Ti oxide minerals (see Petrophysics). The relationshi p between deformation and the presence of Fe-Ti oxides can be cryptic, with examples of Fe-Ti oxides occurring in both deformed an d undeformed samples. There are 26 ultramylonite shear zone s within Hole U1473A to 789 m CCSF, 18 of which correlate with  a peak in magnetic susceptibility. Most susceptibility peaks that d o not correlate with the presence of an ultramylonite instead correlat e with the presence of a mylonite; however, the two largest contiguou s zones of deformation, the $10~\mathrm{m}$ thick mylonites from 201 to $210~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF and from 219 to $228\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CCSF}$ , do not correlate with peaks i n magnetic susceptibility and are Fe-Ti oxide poor.  

No clear evidence has been found from the cores for crystalplastic deformation having predated or been contemporaneou s with intrusion of the individual geochemically defined coarse olivine gabbro units. However, the felsic veins appear to have been synkinematic: some of the late-magmatic felsic veins were deforme d along with the gabbros, whereas others, themselves undeformed, clearly crosscut plastically deformed gabbro. The dikes that cut th e Hole U1473A section were intruded under a range of condition s likely ranging from upper amphibolite to sub-greenschist facie s conditions; although none exhibited crystal-plastic deformation, the enclosing gabbros generally do. Taken together with the clea r relationship between late evolved oxide gabbros and discrete shea r zones, it may be concluded that deformation commenced almos t immediately after crystallization of the main gabbro body or bodies, whereas late-stage interstitial melts were still present. Continuin g deformation led to the exhumation and cooling during extensio n along a detachment shear zone that formed the oceanic core complex.  

Seven discrete fault systems were identified in Hole U1473 A based on the presence of fault rocks and fractured intervals (Figur e F17). They range from discrete $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick cataclasites at the top o f the hole to a major fault zone at 411–469 m CCSF. An eighth discrete fault may exist at ${\sim}570~\mathrm{m}$ CCSF; otherwise, no faulted intervals were encountered at greater depths. In each case, the faulte d and fractured zones correspond to intervals of borehole enlargement, reduced core recovery, increased penetration rates, and i n some instances to drilling difficulties (see Operations in the Sit e U1473 chapter [MacLeod et al., 2017b]). The $50\;\mathrm{m}$ thick fault zon e at 411–469 m CCSF consists of chlorite-rich and carbonate-ric h breccias and correlates with an increase in carbonate veining. Take n in conjunction with evidence for a negative temperature anomaly i n downhole logs from this depth (see Petrophysics), it appears tha t the fault zone controls an active hydrologic system. Carbonate veining is positively correlated with fault rock intensity in most of th e faulted intervals above and below the $411{-}469\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ fault zon e (Figure F16). The downhole frequency of carbonate veins increase s toward the major fault zone and then decreases below it, correlatin g with the damage zone of the fault as defined by the fracture densit y of the rocks (Figure F17). The background alteration and olivine alteration increases with the degree of carbonate veining, suggestin g that low-temperature olivine alteration is enhanced in the vicinit y of carbonate veins. This is supported by macroscopic core observations displaying the pronounced red-stained (oxidative) alteratio n of olivine in the vicinity of the carbonates (see Metamorphic pe

trology). These smaller fault zones may too be the focus of activ e fluid flow.  

The following are the main structural conclusions from Hol e U1473A:  

• Multiple generations of felsic veins, most with a crystal-plastic overprint, provide evidence for a protracted history of melt generation and deformation.   
• Hypersolidus magmatic fabrics and grain size layering provide anisotropies that preferentially cause the nucleation of CPFs.   
• A $600\,\mathrm{m}$ thick zone of intense crystal-plastic shearing (Figure F15) represents high-temperature deformation related to formation of the Atlantis Bank oceanic core complex and associated detachment fault zone; however, we cannot correlate it directly with the deformed interval at the top of Hole 735B.   
• Multiple generations of CPFs with different orientations, shear sense, and metamorphic grade attest to a protracted history of ductile deformation.   
• Shear sense is predominantly normal in the upper $50\;\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1473A but tends to be reversed at greater depths. This same observation is made in Hole 735B but with the difference that the transition in the latter occurs at ${\sim}450$ mbsf.   
• A strong correlation exists between the presence of Fe-Ti oxides and that of mylonite, ultramylonite, and magmatic contacts; however, the modal abundance of Fe-Ti oxide does not seem to correlate with deformation, and weaker CPFs tend not to correlate with the presence or absence of Fe-Ti oxide.   
• The transition from crystal-plastic to brittle deformation is associated with granulite to amphibolite and, in some cases,  

greenschist facies alteration by way of ductile, semibrittle, and brittle deformation mechanisms. The degree of greenschist grade deformation is, however, much less in Hole U1473A than in Hole 735B and in previously reported sample suites from the surface of Atlantis Bank (e.g., Miranda and John, 2010). Amphibole veins are concentrated in the upper $400\;\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1473A (Figure F16) and either deflect or offset older CPFs at a high angle. Brittle overprint of high-temperature CPFs is relatively limited and restricted to the upper ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hole.  

A $50\,\mathrm{m}$ thick high-angle fault zone, defined by several fault breccias, carbonate vein abundance, enlargement in borehole size, an d reduction of in situ borehole resistivity, occurs from 411 to $469\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. A temperature anomaly associated with this zone suggest s the fault is hydrologically active. Six other smaller fault zones ar e identified at shallower levels within Hole U1473A (Figure F17). All corresponded to lowered core recoveries, increased penetratio n rates, and, in some cases, problematic drilling conditions.  

# Geochemistry  

The Hole U1473A lithologies are dominated by moderatel y evolved olivine gabbro with $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ between 82 and 66. Mg# co-varie s with other petrogenetic indicators such as Ca#, Ti, Y, Cr, and Ni. The variations in Cr and Ni concentrations cannot be explained b y modal mineralogy but are attributed to the composition of pyroxene and olivine in the rock.  

Downhole variation plots show major discontinuities in $\mathbf{{M}}\mathbf{{g}}^{\#}$ , C r and Ni contents, and $C a\#$ at ${\sim}60{-}90\$ , 300, and ${\sim}700\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ (Figur e F13). The discontinuities are interpreted as delineating upwardl y evolving units of magma intruded in individual intrusive events. The nature and scale of the discontinuities are remarkably similar t o those seen in Hole 735B (Figure F6) (Dick et al., 2000) and are interpreted in a similar manner. In addition to these major-scale variations, however, oxide gabbros occur in centimeter-scale interval s throughout the section. These are significantly more evolved tha n the background olivine gabbro and provide evidence for the migration of late-stage melts over minimum distances of tens to hundred s of meters.  

The average composition calculated for Hole U1473A is ver y similar to that of Hole 735B, with $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ of $71\pm3$ and $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ of $0.7\pm0.2$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The average composition of the Atlantis Bank gabbros i s slightly more evolved than that of Atlantis Massif (Hole U1309D; Godard et al., 2009), although their standard deviations overlap. They are both, however, substantially more fractionated than th e bulk lower crust average calculated for Hess Deep (fast-sprea d lower crust) by Gillis et al. (2014), although we note that the Hes s Deep calculation is based on extrapolation from relatively shor t drilled sections and thus is only an approximation of the composition of the East Pacific Rise lower crust.  

Hole U1473A gabbros have $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ contents of $0.2–8.0\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ (mea n $=1.0\pm0.9\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , median $=0.8\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ), much higher than expected i n pristine cumulates. Even petrographically fresh samples (thin section alteration intensity $=0{-}2\$ ) have mean $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ contents of $0.8\pm0.6$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ (median $=0.7\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ). $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ abundance decreases with depth an d is therefore likely to be controlled mostly by deep and near-pervasive infiltration of seawater through the crustal section. Examination of altered and fresh sample pairs indicates that the alteratio n did not significantly alter major or trace element concentrations. This is consistent with the infiltration of low-salinity seawater-derived fluids with limited potential for mobilizing other elements.  

$C O_{2}$ is below detection limit in many of the samples, but concentrations of up to $2~\mathrm{wt\%}$ were obtained for altered rocks in th e carbonate-veining zone $({\sim}210{-}580\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CC})$ SF). An unexpected resul t was that four of the carbonate-rich samples investigated are dominated by up to $0.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ of inorganic carbon rather than $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . Thes e high concentrations are similar to the range reported for clay-ric h alteration of glass on the seafloor and may be related to clay alteration in the gabbros. The amount of organic carbon present is a factor of 10 higher than determined for the majority of serpentinite s investigated previously. This is an intriguing result and may requir e that low-temperature alteration minerals of gabbro be added to th e list of potential microbial habitats in the subseafloor.  

# Microbiology  

Microbiological sampling during Expedition 360 focused on exploring evidence for life in the lower crust and hydrated mantle using  culture-based  and  culture-independent  approaches, microscopy, and enzyme assays. Sampling focused on cores with evidence of alteration or fracturing within all lithologies encountered. In total, 68 whole-round samples $\!\!\!/4\!\!-\!\!22\,\mathrm{cm}$ long) were collected fo r microbiological analysis. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was quantified from all samples and ranged from below detection to $5\,\mathrm{pg}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (mostly ${<}1\mathrm{~pg}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , indicating the presence of a subsurface biosphere in Atlantis Bank. Samples collected for postcruise researc h include fixed samples for cell counts to quantify microbial biomas s and frozen samples for DNA, RNA, and lipid extraction to describ e the diversity (DNA and lipids) and activity (RNA) of the microbia l community. A total of 38 samples were inoculated into as many a s 10 different kinds of microbial media targeting specific prokaryoti c iron-reducing microbes, sulfate-reducing bacteria, sulfur-oxidizin g microbes, archaeal methanogens, and eukaryotic fungi. These wil l be analyzed during postcruise research. In addition, for 12 sample s we established nutrient addition experiments testing nutritiona l constraints on microbial biomass in this environment. Enzyme activity assays were conducted using substrates for alkaline phosphatase, leucine aminopeptidase, and arginine aminopeptidase at 1 5 sample depths in Hole U1473A. These experiments are ongoing, but initial analysis indicates the presence of very low alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas enzyme activity for both peptidase substrates was below detection.  

Finally, a new microbial contamination tracer, perfluoromethyldecaline (PFMD), was used for contamination testing for the firs t time. PFMD was run during coring operations for 10 samples an d was routinely detected in the drilling fluids, usually on the outsid e of uncleaned cores, and rarely above detection on the outside o f cleaned cores. It was below detection on the inside of cores, indicating that penetration of drilling fluids to the interior of whole-roun d drill cores where we collected our samples is unlikely. We ran thre e runs of the commonly used tracer perfluoromethylcyclohexan e (PMCH) at the end of the cruise for comparison. It was more difficult to clean the core exteriors successfully with this more volatil e tracer, and PMCH was detected on occasion on core interiors.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Remanence measurements made on archive section halves fro m Hole U1473A generated demagnetization data at more than 12,00 0 measuring points downhole. Virtually all intervals have positive inclinations indicating that the gabbros hold a reversed polarity magnetization, consistent with the interpretation of marine magneti c anomalies (Allerton and Tivey, 2001) that place Hole U1473 A within geomagnetic polarity Chron C5r.3r (Gradstein et al., 2012). Moreover, the gabbros carry sufficiently strong magnetizations t o account for the observed magnetic anomalies over Atlantis Bank.  

The archive section-half data were subject to principal component analysis (PCA) using a processing and filtering scheme designed to rapidly identify the highest quality highest coercivit y components for subsequent tectonic interpretation. The resultin g principal component data allow division of the hole into upper an d lower zones with statistically different inclinations (Figure F18) . Thermal demagnetization data from discrete samples subject to th e same filtering for reliability support this division. The boundary between major inclination zones corresponds to the fault zone observed at $411{-}469\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, from a mean value of ${\sim}72^{\circ}$ shallowe r than $403\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ to a mean value of ${\sim}61^{\circ}$ deeper than $403\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF}$ A narrow zone of steeper inclinations $(\mathrm{mean}\,=73.3^{\circ})$ is also see n between 734 and $750\,\mathrm{m}$ CCSF. Compared to the expected dipole inclination of $51.3^{\circ}$ , these results imply a significant but variable rotation  of  the  Atlantis  Bank  footwall  since  acquisition  o f magnetization, with the major change across the fault zone likely reflecting differential rotation across this structure.

Although the greater part of Hole U1473A carries reversed polarity magnetization, thermal demagnetization of discrete sample s and alternating field demagnetization of archive section-half piece s reveals characteristic remanences with negative inclinations i n some narrow zones of altered gabbro (around $\mathord{\sim}564$ , 678, and $749\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF). The presence of these zones within broader intervals of reversed polarity indicates (near-) complete remagnetization of thes e rocks during a subsequent normal polarity period. The timing o f the alteration cannot be uniquely determined from these data, bu t the presence of these components in the lower part of the hole suggests that the reversal boundary between reversed geomagnetic polarity Chron C5r.3r and normal polarity Chron C5r.2n may occur i n close proximity to the current bottom of Hole U1473A.  

# Petrophysics  

Core sections were measured using data loggers for magneti c susceptibility, gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density, and natura l gamma radiation (NGR). Magnetic susceptibility was measured o n both whole-round sections and archive halves, using a pass-throug h sensor coil and a contact probe, respectively. The measured magnetic susceptibility varies over the whole instrument range (10,00 0 instrument units [IU]; i.e., ${\sim}0.1$ SI); high magnetic susceptibility values $(>\!1,\!000{\mathrm{~IU}})$ are ubiquitously related to abundant magnetite i n gabbroic lithologies. The dominant olivine gabbro lithology has relatively low susceptibility that does not exceed a few hundred instrument units. At the centimeter to decimeter scale, high values o f magnetic susceptibility indicate oxide-rich intervals, seams, an d patches.  

NGR from the gabbro cores is consistently very low $\backslash{}^{\leq}1$ count/s). Several isolated peaks up to ${\sim}10$ counts/s were observe d in the vicinity of felsic veins. In the lower part of the hole (deepe r than ${\sim}575\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ ), these narrow peaks often correlate with th e highest magnetic susceptibility signals, indicating the presence o f magnetite in the felsic veins.  

GRA density estimates range from 2.1 to $3.2\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and averag e ${\sim}2.65\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Estimates are slightly less variable in the bottom of th e hole (below the major fault zone at ${\sim}411{-}462\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CC}$ SF) than in shallower sections, with an average value of about $2.67\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

Density and porosity were determined for 186 samples. Grai n density ranges from 2.88 to $3.13~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and averages $2.98~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . I t does not vary significantly downhole, except for a slightly highe r variability above the major fault zone at ${\sim}411{-}469\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF. Porosity is generally very low; it ranges from $0.1\%$ to $4.2\%$ and average s $0.6\%$ .  

Compressional seismic velocity was measured at room pressur e and temperature along three mutually perpendicular directions o n $2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2\,\mathrm{cm}\times2$ cm cubic samples. A total of 184 gabbroic sample s from Hole U1473A were measured, $94\%$ of which were olivine gabbro. $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ ranges from 5930 to $7150\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , with an average of $6734\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and an average standard deviation of $25~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Above the major faul t zone at ${\sim}411{-}469\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ shows a modest increasing tren d over the interval $\mathord{\sim}280$ to ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF, from ${\sim}6700$ to ${\sim}7100~\mathrm{m/s}$ . This progressive increase does not continue deeper in the hole. Below the major fault zone, $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ is lower on average $(6646\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ than i n the upper part of the hole $(6795\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ), with a similar range of localscale variability. Local trends of decreasing $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ over a few tens of meters match trends of increasing porosity and correspond to mor e fractured intervals and fault zones. The measured apparent anisotropy of $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ is generally low, ranging from $0.1\%$ to $10.9\%$ and averaging $2.2\%$ ; the slowest average $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ of the three measured directions i s parallel to the core axis $({\sim}6708\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ .  

Thermal conductivity was measured on 86 samples from archive halves. It ranges from 1.77 to 2.52 W/(m·K) and averages 2.2 8 $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ . The standard deviation of the measurements is $-2\%$ $(0.66\%$ on average). Olivine gabbro conductivities are in the sam e range as those measured during previous oceanic crust drilling expeditions. Deeper than ${\sim}450\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF},$ the average thermal conductivity is slightly higher $(2.36\ \mathrm{W/[m.K]})$ than in the upper part (2.2 1 $\scriptstyle\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ . This may partly reflect the general change in backgroun d alteration at the bottom of the hole; deeper than $570\mathrm{~m~CCSF},$ olivine is less altered and secondary clays are absent (Figure F14).  

Downhole logs were successfully acquired at the end of drillin g operations using three tool strings: a modified “triple combo” (NG R spectroscopy, bulk density, bulk resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility), a Formation MicroScanner-sonic string (seismic velocity an d electrical resistivity borehole wall imaging), and an Ultrasonic Borehole Imager string (acoustic borehole wall imaging). Each tool string also measured total NGR and borehole temperature. Th e borehole diameter measured by the triple combo tool string show s significant variations in the upper part of the hole to ${\sim}570~\mathrm{m}$ wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF) and a much more regular an d clean shape deeper, where core recovery averaged $96\%$ . Interval s where the hole diameter is very variable and/or out of gauge correspond to low recovery and/or faulted material identified in the core. The presence of fault zones at ${\sim}411{-}469\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ is indicated b y low electrical resistivity and low bulk density. A negative temperature excursion recorded by the temperature tool on each run als o places the base of a major fault that introduces colder fluid into th e borehole at ${\sim}469\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF.  

In the bottom part of the hole (deeper than ${\sim}570\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ ), $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ averages about $6840~\mathrm{m/s}$ , significantly higher than shallower tha n $570\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF, where it is generally about $6300{-}6400\ \mathrm{m/s}$ away fro m fault zones.  

# Hole 1105A redescription  

During the 11 day transit from Colombo, Sri Lanka, to Sit e U1473 at Atlantis Bank, the Expedition 360 science party reexamined cores drilled during Leg 179 in Hole 1105A (Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999; Casey et al., 2007). This activity involved rigorously describing the cores and many of the accompanying thin sections with the primary purpose of familiarizing the science part y with the material likely to be encountered at the new Site U1473, situated $1.4\,\mathrm{km}$ to the north. The science party developed template s for the description of the igneous, metamorphic, and structural features of the cores and thin sections to establish core descriptio n protocols for Site U1473 cores. An additional benefit of redescribing Hole 1105A cores is that the data generated are in a format directly comparable with those for Hole U1473A.  

In general, our findings were very similar to those produced b y the Leg 179 scientists; however, with a larger science party to wor k on the cores, some of the information collected is new. We includ e this information in the Hole 1105A redescription chapter (MacLeod et al., 2017a), as a basis for direct comparison with the result s of drilling at Site U1473. In addition, we were able to make certai n physical properties measurements on Hole 1105A cores, includin g section-half magnetic susceptibility measurements, that had no t been possible during Leg 179. It is important to note here that th e observations made on the Hole 1105A cores by the Expedition 36 0 scientific party augment rather than replace those made by the Le g 179 scientists.  

# Igneous petrology  

Our observations on the igneous petrology of this section ar e summarized below and then briefly compared with those mad e during Leg 179. The 30 cores recovered from Hole 1105A are composed of gabbroic rocks and related felsic veins (Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999; Casey et al., 2007). The gabbroic rocks are mostl y coarse grained with subophitic to granular textures and are variabl y deformed. Subophitic textures dominate in undeformed samples. The main lithologies are oxide gabbro and olivine gabbro, followe d in abundance by gabbro (sensu stricto). A significant proportion o f the olivine gabbro and gabbro intervals contain small amounts o f oxides and are referred to as disseminated-oxide gabbro $(1\%-2\%$ oxides) and oxide-bearing gabbro $(2\%-5\%$ oxides). On the whole, gabbroic rocks with oxides ${>}1\%$ are dominant deeper than $35\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CCSF, and they tend to be more plastically deformed than othe r lithologies. Oxides are particularly abundant and probably crystallized from percolating evolved melts. In these deformed gabbros, oxides are not obviously affected by plastic deformation, and thu s apparently crystallized after dynamic recrystallization of the silicates. Some rare undeformed oxide gabbros are also observed. Thi n intrusions of fine-grained olivine gabbro occur between 60 and 7 5 m CCSF. Numerous felsic veins occur throughout the core and ar e concentrated at 15–65 and 138–158 m CCSF. Detailed observation s of the corresponding thin sections allow us to document the evolution of late-stage melts within a crystallizing mush and to track th e origin of magmatic oxide minerals where they are particularly enriched.  

When compared with Hole 735B gabbros (Robinson, Von Herzen, et al., 1989; Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999), Hole 1105A i s more enriched in oxide-bearing varieties (disseminated-oxide gabbro, oxide-bearing gabbro, or oxide gabbro) and therefore represents a section of crust that is more evolved overall than tha t recovered in Hole 735B. The oxide-rich section of Hole 1105A i s both thicker and more enriched in oxides than the principal oxiderich portions of Hole 735B (Units III and IV; 170.2–274.1 mbsf). Deformation grade and alteration patterns are also different, and  a downhole differentiation trend similar to that observed for Hol e 735B oxide gabbro is questionable for Hole 1105A whole-rock compositions but may be more evident when considering mineral compositions (Dick, Natland, Miller, et al., 1999; Dick et al., 2002; Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999; Casey et al., 2007). If the Hol e 1105A section is equivalent to any portion of Hole 735B, the mos t likely candidate would be Units III and IV (170.2–274.1 mbsf; Case y et al., 2007). Nevertheless, given the mismatch in comparisons presented above and as discussed in Casey et al. (2007), it is probabl e that Hole 1105A does not represent a single layer connected directl y with Hole 735B; rather, it may instead record the manifestation of  a similar process, dominated by the percolation of evolved melts tha t have the potential to precipitate oxides and concentrate them i n high-porosity regions located in the shallowest levels of the sections. In Hole 735B, these regions clearly correspond to units affected by crystal-plastic deformation; however, such a relationshi p is less evident in Hole 1105A. The shallowest section of Hole 1105 A $^{15-40}\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF})$ is composed of material that is less evolved (olivine gabbro) and less deformed than in the deeper sections and i s similar to several units recovered lower in Hole 735B. In Hole 735B, most felsic veins are associated with oxide gabbro (e.g., Natland e t al., 1991), a relationship that is not observed in Hole 1105A.  

When compared with results of Leg 179 (Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999), we have defined fewer intervals: 108 during Expedition 360 versus 141 during Leg 179. Their modal content estimates are on average also quite different from ours, resulting i n different proportions of rock types (olivine gabbro was $39\%$ durin g Expedition 360 versus $43\%$ during Leg 179, gabbro was $21\%$ versu s $36\%$ , respectively, and oxide gabbro was $41\%$ versus $21\%$ , respectively). Our values as presented above have been adjusted to matc h Leg 179 descriptions, since during Leg 179 disseminated-oxide gabbro (defined as having oxide content from $1\%$ to $2\%$ ) and oxidebearing gabbros (oxide content from $2\%$ to $5\%$ ) were include d within the gabbros.  

The units defined for Hole 1105A during Leg 179 and Expedition 360 are relatively similar to each other. Four units were define d both during Leg 179 (two subunits in Unit II) and during Expeditio n 360. The transition between Units I and II are relatively close $_{<10}$ m difference), the transition between Units IIA and IIB of Leg 17 9 and between corresponding Units II and III of Expedition 360 als o differ by ${<}10\;\mathrm{m},$ , and the transition between Units IIB and III of Le g 179 is $4\textrm{m}$ deeper than the transition between Units III and IV o f Expedition 360. Leg 179 scientists also defined a Unit IV in th e deepest part of Hole 1105A, but this distinction was not mad e during Expedition 360.  

# Metamorphic petrology  

Most gabbros in Hole 1105A $(83\%)$ have $<\!30\;\mathrm{vol}\%$ of secondar y minerals formed by static alteration; intervals of extensive static alteration $(\ge\!60\,\mathrm{vol}\%)$ ) are rare ( $-3\%$ of the total). The intensity of stati c alteration shows no trend with depth in the hole. Olivine and plagioclase are generally the most and the least altered phases, respectively. Plagioclase is substantially altered only where the host roc k shows intense veining or cataclasis. Felsic veins tend to be substantially more altered than their host gabbros.  

High-temperature alteration is largely associated with crystalplastic deformation. The neoblastic minerals (plagioclase, olivine, and clinopyroxene, the latter locally associated with minor brow n amphibole) document crystal-plastic deformation under granulit e to upper amphibolite facies conditions. The high-temperature alteration is also locally manifested by static replacement of magmati c clinopyroxene by secondary clinopyroxene and minor brown hornblende.  

Subsequent phases of metamorphism are recorded in veins an d by static alteration minerals. Veins filled with brownish green hornblende forming up to $1\ \mathrm{mm}$ long crystals are presumed to hav e formed under amphibolite facies conditions. Other veins are characterized by pale green actinolitic amphibole needles associate d with chlorite. These veins likely developed under greenschist facie s conditions.  

The moderate-temperature static alteration minerals vary i n conjunction with the primary mineral. In particular, variable replacement modes were observed for olivine. Olivine is commonl y altered to talc and minor oxide aggregates, frequently with an oute r rim of chlorite where it is in contact with plagioclase. A less frequent mode of olivine alteration is represented by local aggregate s of chlorite and pale green amphibole in coronae along plagioclas e contacts. Clinopyroxene is altered along rims, cleavage surfaces, and micro veins into green to pale green amphibole. Plagioclase hydrothermal alteration is mostly confined to development of chlorit e along the contacts with primary mafic minerals and within micr o veins, in many instances in association with minor secondary plagioclase.  

Abundant veins filled with clay minerals record hydrotherma l alteration under oxidative sub-greenschist facies conditions. Vein s of this type are conspicuous in a few intervals in association wit h significant cataclastic deformation. In these intervals, olivine an d pyroxene are mainly replaced by reddish brown clay minerals or b y mixtures of clay and iron oxyhydroxides. Similar clay and carbonat e veins and brownish clay pseudomorphs after olivine and pyroxen e occur in host gabbros near the cataclastic zones. Low-temperatur e carbonate veins are also present toward the bottom of Hole 1105A.  

# Structural geology  

The distribution and intensity of structures in Hole 1105A— magmatic contacts, veins, and fabrics; CPFs; alteration veins; cataclastic material; and fractures—represent a continuous record o f deformation from ductile to brittle. The proportion and overall intensity of gabbroic rocks displaying CPFs increases downhole, fro m decimeter-thick discrete mylonites in the top $80\mathrm{~m~}\mathrm{CCSF}$ to meterthick gneissic porphyroclastic shear zones deeper than $80\ \mathrm{m}\,\,{\mathrm{CCSF}}$ Intervals of mylonite and ultramylonite, which may overprint earlie r magmatic fabrics, are characterized by elongated bands of plagioclase intercalated with bands of pyroxene and are commonly FeTi oxide rich. CPFs are shallowly to moderately inclined and commonly display reversed shear sense, although normal shear sens e does occur. Fe-Ti oxides are abundant in many samples, rangin g from deformed to undeformed, and concentrate near magmati c contacts. Eighty percent of magnetic susceptibility peaks correlat e with intervals that contain some evidence for crystal-plastic deformation.  

Magmatic  fabrics (shape-preferred primary  orientations  o f elongate crystals) are commonly overprinted and obscured by subsequent CPFs. Where magmatic fabrics are recognized they ar e weakly developed. Typically, they are inclined and better develope d in finer grained rocks and near magmatic contacts. Magmatic contacts range from intrusive to gradational and sheared, with the majority of contacts being gradational, defined by grain size or moda l variations. Magmatic veins are common throughout the top an d bottom of Hole 1105A (15–65 and $138{-}158\ \mathrm{m}$ CCSF) and are absent from the middle part of the section $(65{-}138\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CCSF})$ ). Most o f the magmatic veins crosscut a previous CPF and are not themselve s plastically deformed; however, in a few instances leucocratic gabbroic veins are observed that have a mylonitic overprint. In som e cases, deformation is confined to the vein, whereas the host gabbr o is apparently undeformed. These intrusive relationships indicate a t least two generations of melt input and deformation. The distribution of magmatic vein dips is bimodal, similar to that seen in Hol e 735B.  

Five fractured zones are identified in Hole 1105A, two of whic h are fault zones. These fault zones (at 112 and $127\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ ) are eac h ${\sim}5\textrm{m}$ thick fractured intervals surrounding a core of fault breccia. Discrete fractures are generally planar, some with slickensides. Th e slickenlines have a steep to moderate rake, indicating oblique to dipslip. The dip magnitude distribution is not random.  

Alteration veins vary in orientation as well as mineralogy: amphibole veins tend to be moderately to steeply inclined, wherea s carbonate and clay veins are generally subhorizontal. Amphibol e veins are most common at 40–50, 60–70, and $120{-}130\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF, intervals in which other vein fills are rare. Incomplete fill of calcit e and clay veins and the correlation of these veins with zones of fracturing are indicative of low-temperature, potentially recent flui d flow through the fracture systems. This is consistent with measure d downhole logging temperature anomalies at 104–105 and 135–13 6 mbsf (Pettigrew, Casey, Miller, et al., 1999).  

The relative ages, distributions, and orientations of structures, ranging from magmatic contacts to brittle faults, document a downtemperature continuum of deformation, spanning the entire histor y from magmatic accretion to exhumation. Perhaps the most strikin g observation is the absence in Hole 1105A of a coherent high-strai n porphyroclastic to mylonitic shear zone at the seafloor directl y comparable to that documented in Hole 735B 1.2 km to the eastnortheast (Robinson, Von Herzen, et al., 1989; Dick et al., 1991a). Given the generally accepted interpretation of Atlantis Bank as a n oceanic core complex (see Summary), the apparent absence of detachment fault shearing at the surface of the platform might best b e explained by erosion following the earlier uplift of Atlantis Bank t o sea level. Erosion might also explain the absence of a significan t brittle overprint at the top of the hole. Most likely, the high-temperature deformation exhibited in Hole 1105A represents a slightl y deeper part of the damage zone related to the detachment shea r zone below the ridge axis.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Remanence measurements were made on archive halves fro m Hole 1105A. These had previously been demagnetized at a maximum field of only $20~\mathrm{mT}$ during Leg 179; hence, during Expeditio n 360 we were able to conduct further stepwise demagnetization u p to $50\,\mathrm{\mT}.$ . We thereby generated demagnetization data at $>\!2500$ measurement points downhole. These data were subject to PCA using a processing and filtering scheme designed to rapidly identif y the highest quality demagnetization data for subsequent tectoni c interpretation. Piece-averaged principal components have a mea n inclination of $72.5^{\circ}$ (determined from 346 archive-half pieces). Thi s value is in good agreement with those obtained previously in Hol e 735B (71.1°) and from seabed rock drill samples (Allerton and Tivey, 2001). Compared to the expected dipole inclination of $51.3^{\circ}$ , the results imply a consistent minimum rotation of the Atlantis Ban k footwall of ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ since acquisition of magnetization.  

# Petrophysics  

New physical properties measurements on section halves an d section-half pieces from Hole 1105A were acquired and integrate d with the new shipboard core descriptions. Using equipment no t available to Leg 179 scientists, we measured point magnetic susceptibility on archive halves and thermal conductivity on discrete samples.  

The mean magnetic susceptibility of rocks recovered in Hol e 1105A is 1800 IU (i.e., ${\sim}1800\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}_{.}$ ). Several intervals have susceptibility much greater than the average value for Hole 1105A an d correspond to intervals with a higher abundance of magnetite in oxide or oxide-bearing (olivine) gabbro.  

Thermal conductivity was measured on 28 gabbro pieces take n at irregularly spaced intervals along Hole 1105A. Measured value s range from 1.804 to 2.981 W/(m·K), with an average of 2.1 6 $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ . This limited data set from the shallow portion of the section at Atlantis Bank does not show any relation between rock typ e or alteration and thermal conductivity.
