# Abstract  

Hotspot tracks (quasilinear chains of seamounts, ridges, and other volcanic structures) provid e important records of plate motions, as well as mantle geodynamics, magma flux, and mantl e source compositions. The Tristan-Gough-Walvis Ridge (TGW) hotspot track, extending from th e active volcanic islands of Tristan da Cunha and Gough through a province of guyots and the n along Walvis Ridge to the Etendeka flood basalt province, forms one of the most prominent an d complex global hotspot tracks. The TGW hotspot track displays a tight linear age progression i n which ages increase from the islands to the flood basalts (covering ${\sim}135\,\mathrm{My}.$ ). Unlike Pacific tracks, which are simple chains of seamounts that are often compared to chains of pearls, the TGW trac k is alternately a steep-sided narrow ridge, an oceanic plateau, subparallel linear ridges and chains o f seamounts, and areas of what appear to be randomly dispersed seamounts. The track displays isotopic zonation over the last ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{My}.$ The zonation appears near the middle of the track just befor e it splits into two to three chains of ridge- and guyot-type seamounts. The older ridge is also overprinted with age-progressive late-stage volcanism, which was emplaced ${\sim}30{-}40~\mathrm{My}$ after the initial eruptions and has a distinct isotopic composition. The plan for Expedition 391 was to drill a t six sites, three along Walvis Ridge and three in the seamount (guyot) province, to gather igneou s rocks to better understand the formation of track edifices, the temporal and geochemical evolution of the hotspot, and the variation in paleolatitudes at which the volcanic edifices formed.  

After a delay of 18 days to address a shipboard outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) virus, Expedition 391 proceeded to drill at four of the proposed sites: three sites on the easter n Walvis Ridge around Valdivia Bank, an ocean plateau within the ridge, and one site on the lowe r flank of a guyot in the Center track, a ridge located between the Tristan subtrack (which extend s from the end of Walvis Ridge to the island of Tristan da Cunha) and the Gough subtrack (whic h extends from Walvis Ridge to the island of Gough). One hole was drilled at Site U1575, located o n a low portion of the northeastern Walvis Ridge north of Valdivia Bank. At this location, $209.9\;\mathrm{m}$ o f sediments and $122.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement were cored. The latter comprised 10 submarine lav a units consisting of pillow, lobate, sheet, and massive lava flows, the thickest of which was ${\sim}21\mathrm{~m~}$ Most lavas are tholeiitic, but some alkalic basalts were recovered. A portion of the igneous succession consists of low-Ti basalts, which are unusual because they appear in the Etendeka floo d basalts but have not been previously found on Walvis Ridge. Two holes were drilled at Site U157 6 on the west flank of Valdivia Bank. The first hole was terminated because a bit jammed shortl y after penetrating igneous basement. Hole U1576A recovered a remarkable ${\sim}380\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary section consisting mostly of chalk covering a nearly complete sequence from Paleocene t o Late Cretaceous (Campanian). These sediments display short and long cyclic color changes tha t imply astronomically forced and longer term paleoenvironmental changes. The igneous basemen t yielded 11 submarine lava units ranging from pillows to massive flows, which have composition s varying from tholeiitic basalt to basaltic andesite, the first occurrence of this composition recovered from the TGW track. These units are separated by seven sedimentary chalk units that rang e in thickness from 0.1 to $11.6~\mathrm{m}$ , implying a long-term interplay of sedimentation and lava eruptions. Coring at Site U1577, on the extreme eastern flank of Valdivia Bank, penetrated a $154~\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary section, the bottom ${\sim}108\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of which is Maastrichtian–Campanian (possibl y Santonian) chalk with vitric tephra layers. Igneous basement coring progressed only $39.1\;\mathrm{m}$ belo w the sediment-basalt contact, recovering three massive submarine tholeiite basalt lava flows tha t are 4.1, 15.5, and ${>}19.1\ \mathrm{m}$ thick, respectively. Paleomagnetic data from Sites U1577 and U157 6 indicate that their volcanic basements formed just before the end of the Cretaceous Norma l Superchron and during Chron 33r, shortly afterward, respectively. Biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data suggest an east–west age progression across Valdivia Bank, becoming younge r westward. Site U1578, located on a Center track guyot, provided a long and varied igneous section. After coring through $184.3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of pelagic carbonate sediments mainly consisting of Eocene an d Paleocene chalk, Hole U1578A cored $302.1\textrm{m}$ of igneous basement. Basement lavas are largel y pillows but are interspersed with sheet and massive flows. Lava compositions are mostly alkali c basalts with some hawaiite. Several intervals contain abundant olivine, and some of the pillo w stacks consist of basalt with remarkably high Ti content. The igneous sequence is interrupted b y 10 sedimentary interbeds consisting of chalk and volcaniclastics and ranging in thickness fro m 0.46 to $10.19\,\mathrm{m}$ . Paleomagnetic data display a change in basement magnetic polarity ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ abov e the base of the hole. Combining magnetic stratigraphy with biostratigraphic data, the igneous section is inferred to span $^{>1}$ My. Abundant glass from pillow lava margins was recovered at Site s U1575, U1576, and U1578.  

Although the igneous penetration was only two-thirds of the planned amount, drilling durin g Expedition 391 obtained samples that clearly will lead to a deeper understanding of the evolutio n of the Tristan-Gough hotspot and its track. Relatively fresh basalts with good recovery will provid e ample samples for geochemical, geochronologic, and paleomagnetic studies. Good recovery o f Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic chalk successions provides samples for paleoenvironmenta l study.  

# 1. Introduction  

At ${\sim}3100\ \mathrm{km}$ in length, the Tristan-Gough-Walvis Ridge (TGW) volcanic chain is one of Earth’ s longest linear features on the seafloor. It was one of the first proposed to have been formed by  a hotspot (Wilson, 1963), which Morgan (1971) proposed was a mantle plume, a melting anomaly a t the top of a narrow, buoyant, columnar upwelling of higher temperature mantle material. Unlik e the Hawaiian-Emperor and Louisville Seamount chains in the Pacific, which are mostly simpl e chains of individual volcanic seamounts and considered archetypal plume trails (Clague and Dalrymple, 1989; Koppers et al., 2004), the TGW chain is highly complex in its morphology, isotop e geochemistry, and history.  

Morphologically, the TGW chain includes a continuous ridge (Frio Ridge) with a straight side an d top corrugated with faults, an oceanic plateau (Valdivia Bank), elongated ridges perpendicular t o the ridge trend, chains of guyots, and scattered seamounts (Figure F1). The post-70 Ma volcanis m (called the Guyot Province) can be divided into two distinct tracks of seamounts, one extendin g from the end of Walvis Ridge toward Tristan Island (the Tristan track) and another trendin g toward Gough Island (the Gough track). These two chains are characterized by distinct Pb isotopic compositions, but both have enriched mantle one (EMI)–type geochemistry (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015). This represents the longest-lived hotspot zonation recognized thu s far. Between the two tracks is a ridge called the Center track, but it is not clear whether its isotopi c signature represents mixing of the Tristan and Gough end-members or constitutes a third distinc t geochemical reservoir. The older Walvis Ridge (pre- $\cdot70\;\mathrm{Ma},$ ) has a Gough-type EMI composition. Younger guyot-type seamounts with a different high- $\boldsymbol{\cdot}\boldsymbol{\upmu}$ (HIMU) composition overlie the flattopped and faulted Walvis Ridge basement. Both the TGW chain (EMI-type) and the HIMU seamounts continuing into Africa display remarkably linear age progressions, offset by $30{-}40\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , that are interpreted as reflecting two distinct plumes derived from distinct portions of the larg e low-shear velocity province (LLSVP) at the base of the lower mantle (Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019, 2020). Moreover, the Valdivia Bank Plateau apparently formed on the boundary of a microplate, which may have affected its development along with that of its twin, Rio Grande Rise on th e South American plate (Sager et al., 2021).

The TGW chain is also an important geodynamic indicator. It is nearly antipodal to the HawaiianEmperor chain, which has been the fodder for debates about the fidelity of seamount chains t o define plate motions relative to the underlying mantle. Two phenomena that can cause hotspo t motion are mantle flow and true polar wander (TPW; the shift of the entire mantle relative to th e spin axis). Because they are nearly antipolar, if there was significant TPW during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, the effect should be a coherent shift with Pacific and Atlantic hotspots (nominally, in the opposite direction from Hawaii). If other phenomena, such as plume motion, are th e cause of TGW chain paleolatitude shifts, it is predicted to be in the same direction as Hawai i (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Moreover, the TGW track is the longest and most continuous on th e African plate, so it plays an outsized role in determining the absolute motion of that plate. Thus,  a better definition of the TGW chain age progression and paleolatitude is important for refinin g absolute plate motion models.  

Owing to its complex nature, the TGW track can give important insights into (1) the interaction o f mantle plumes with lithospheric boundaries, (2) plume geochemical zonation, (3) complication s (e.g., morphological and geochemical) related to a second hotspot event superimposed onto th e first, (4) microplate formation, (5) plume movement, and (6) TPW. Expedition 391 sought t o explore these complexities by coring at four locations, one in the Guyot Province and three o n Valdivia Bank (Figure F1).  

# 2. Background  

Most of the background information included here comes from the proposal that was accepted fo r Expedition 391 and related proposals and papers by the proposal authors. The proposal include d drilling at six sites, three on the older Walvis Ridge near Valdivia Bank and three in the Guyo t Province just southeast of the split into two or three separate tracks. Unfortunately, Expeditio n 391 began in Cape Town, South Africa, during a spike in the COVID-19 pandemic and an outbreak occurred onboard. This required a return to Cape Town and a wait at the dock until th e virus was eliminated from the ship. Eventually, this was achieved but at a loss of almost a third o f the allotted ship time. A pared down plan was conceived to visit four of the six sites (Figure F1 ) with reduced time for deep penetration. The focus was to core the three sites on Valdivia Bank t o gain an understanding and timing of the formation of that edifice and to core the Center track i n the Guyot Province because it would be central to addressing geochemical zonation and paleolatitude questions. The original proposal ideas are recounted here, but shortening the cruis e meant having to take a somewhat different approach. The original background information i s included here to explain the original motivation, rationale, and approach.  

# 2.1. Hotspot models and geodynamics  

Early concepts of hotspots were compelling because they seemed to fit nicely with the new paradigm of plate tectonics. Hotspots were explained as a melting anomaly beneath the lithospheri c plates (Wilson, 1963) above a narrow thermal plume arising from the deep mantle (Morgan, 1971, 1972). Eventually, hotspot volcanic chains were widely used as a mantle reference frame (Morgan, 1971, 1972, 1981; Duncan, 1981; Duncan and Clague, 1985; Müller et al., 1993) because the volcanic sources seemed to be fixed relative to the mantle and thus volcanic chains were interpreted a s an indication of absolute plate motion. This view lost favor as studies discovered problems wit h absolute plate motion models. Some studies showed discrepancies between the Pacific and IndoAtlantic hotspot reference frames (Stock and Molnar, 1987; Cande et al., 1995; Raymond et al., 2000). Other studies questioned the fixed hotspot hypothesis because numerical models implie d perturbations by mantle flow (Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998, 2000; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger et al., 2004). Paleolatitude data showed significant latitudinal motion of the Hawaiia n hotspot (Tarduno and Cottrell, 1997; Tarduno et al., 2003), in contrast with limited motion for th e Louisville hotspot (Koppers et al., 2012). Simultaneously, other authors questioned the plum e model and the role of plumes in mantle convection (Foulger, 2005; Foulger et al., 2007). The resul t was a shift of consensus from fixed to mobile hotspots. With renewed scrutiny, researchers hav e found the plume and hotspot hypotheses to be more complicated than was first thought. Althoug h many researchers accept the plume hypothesis, the number, composition, sources, mobility, structure, and geodynamic implications are still debated (e.g., Courtillot et al., 2003; Anderson, 2005; Montelli et al., 2006; Foulger, 2007; Farnetani and Samuel, 2005; French and Romanowicz, 2015; Koppers et al., 2021).  

Hotspot volcanic chains are most clearly expressed in the oceans as quasilinear seamount chains, yet most are poorly sampled and studied, leaving room for uncertainty and speculation. Th e Hawaiian-Emperor chain is the archetypal hotspot track. Its apparent age progression is relativel y simple (Clague and Dalrymple, 1989) and inspired Wilson (1963) to propose the hotspot hypothesis, followed by the mantle plume hypothesis (Morgan, 1971). Many Pacific seamount chains display  a  “string  of  pearls”  morphology  with  largely  individual  volcanic  seamounts,  mos t characterized by relatively flat tops (guyots), in a line recording the motion of the plate relative t o the hotspot (e.g., Clague and Dalrymple, 1989; Koppers et al., 2011). This idea is widely accepte d and applied to other linear seamount chains. In contrast to many Pacific seamount tracks, Atlanti c seamount chains are diffuse and sometimes imply different rates of motion (e.g., O’Connor et al., 1999). Some chains, such as Ninetyeast Ridge and Walvis Ridge, have complex morphologies, containing ridge-like structures, plateaus, multiple tracks, and large offsets, which indicates that thei r shapes are partly a result of interactions with plate boundaries (e.g., Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010; Sager, 2021; Krishna et al., 2012; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b; Hoernle et al., 2016). I n addition, there is evidence that large igneous provinces (LIPs) and mid-ocean ridges can interac t over tens of millions of years (Krishna et al., 2012; Sager et al., 2016, 2019, 2021), suggesting tha t plume and mid-ocean ridge convection may be linked (Whittaker et al., 2015).  

# 2.2. Geologic setting  

The TGW chain, located in the South Atlantic (Figure F1), is one of the most geodynamicall y complex and significant hotspot tracks. It was one of the first proposed plume tracks (Morgan, 1971, 1972) and is considered to have formed by progressive volcanism like Hawaii (O’Connor an d Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a; Homrighausen et al., 2019). It is one of only three hotspot tracks that connect a continental floo d basalt province to active volcanoes (Richards et al., 1989). It is also considered one of only seve n primary (probably from the lower mantle) plumes (Courtillot et al., 2003). Furthermore, it is one o f several South Atlantic hotspots tied to the edge of the Atlantic deep mantle LLSVP, a possibl e plume generation zone (Torsvik et al., 2006; O’Connor et al., 2012; Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019, 2020). Because of its prominence and ${\sim}120$ My duration (Rohde e t al., 2013b; Homrighausen et al., 2019), Walvis Ridge is a keystone in the Indo-Atlantic hotspo t absolute motion reference frame (e.g., Duncan, 1981; Müller et al., 1993; Doubrovine et al., 2012), but with its geologic complexities and the uncertainty of plumes as fixed mantle markers, the geodynamic implications of the TGW track are unclear. Indeed, some authors posit that the TG W chain was formed by nonhotspot-related volcanism along shear zones and structural weaknesse s (Fairhead and Wilson, 2005; Foulger, 2007). Although many researchers think there is strong evidence that Walvis Ridge was formed by a mantle plume, its complexity contrasts with the simpl e Hawaiian-Emperor chain. The TGW chain forms a narrow ridge near the continent after a shar p bend forms a plateau (Valdivia Bank) and then splits into two or three seamount chains farthe r southwest until it reaches a width of $400\;\mathrm{km}$ between the active volcanic island groups of Trista n da Cunha and Gough. This region of guyots and ridge-type seamounts is known as the Guyo t Province. The two outer seamount tracks end in the active volcanic islands (Figure F1). It may b e that the TGW track is an example of a different type of mantle plume, emplaced near a ridg e during its early history and from a more diffuse or multiple upwellings (e.g., O’Connor et al., 2012; Anderson and Natland, 2014; Rohde et al., 2013b). The TGW track also represents the longes t known $({\sim}70\mathrm{~My})$ geochemically zoned hotspot, and the onset of zonation occurs just before th e morphologic split (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Class et al., 2015). Moreover, th e Valdivia Bank section of Walvis Ridge displays age-progressive secondary volcanism with a distinct isotopic composition (HIMU or high time-integrated $\mathrm{^{238}U/^{204}P b}$ type) that lags the origina l volcanism by ${\sim}30$ My, implying a secondary plume (Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2018b, 2019, 2020). For these reasons, knowledge of the TGW track history is important for understandin g hotspot geodynamics and volcanism.  

# 2.2.1. Evolution of the Walvis Ridge: Rio Grande Rise hotspot twins  

Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise (Figure F2) are considered examples of LIPs formed from  a mantle plume located beneath a spreading ridge (Morgan, 1981; O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; Whittaker et al., 2015). While the plume was beneath the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during the Late Cretaceous, eruptions occurred on both the South American and African plates, forming Rio Grand e Rise and Walvis Ridge (O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; Rohde et al., 2013b). Although the TG W chain appears as a quasilinear ridge and seamount chain, LIP eruptions formed two ocean plateau–size edifices, Valdivia Bank $(400\ \mathrm{km}\times550\ \mathrm{km})$ and Rio Grande Rise Massif $^{\prime}500\,\,\mathrm{km}\times950$ $\operatorname{km})$ , at ${\sim}80{-}90$ Ma (Rohde et al., 2013b; Homrighausen et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). Th e hotspot and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge separated at ${\sim}60{-}70\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , and the hotspot erupted on the African plate thereafter. Consequently, volcanism ceased on the South American plate while linea r seamount chains extended southwest from Walvis Ridge. Since these pioneering studies, author s have tried to fit the TGW chain with hotspot models that have a monotonic age progression (Figure F3) (Duncan, 1981; O’Connor and le Roex, 1992; Müller et al., 1993; Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012). Such simple hotspot models do a poor job of fitting the complex Walvis Ridg e morphology. In response, authors have resorted to models with multiple hotspots (O’Connor an d le Roex, 1992), moving hotspots (Doubrovine et al., 2012), hotspot-ridge interaction (O’Conno r and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b), and/or distinct plumelets beneath the Tristan and Gough subtrack s (Rohde et al., 2013b) to explain TGW track morphologic changes, but no hotspot model is entirel y satisfactory. More recent studies, however, show that the TGW chain forms a very good age progression when younger volcanism with a distinct HIMU-type composition is considered separately from the EMI-type basement (Figure F4) (Homrighausen et al., 2019). A seismic tomographic study shows a narrow plume conduit ( ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{km}$ in diameter) extending to a depth of ${\sim}250\,\mathrm{km}$ and then splitting into two smaller conduits to ${\sim}500\ \mathrm{km}$ beneath a point just southwest of the Tristan volcanic island complex (Schlömer et al., 2017). The study did not, however, include the area beneath Gough Island, so this picture is incomplete.

A further problem with the simple plume hypothesis for the older (pre- $\cdot70\mathrm{\Ma},$ ) portion of th e hotspot track is the dramatically different morphologies of Rio Grande Rise and the TGW chain. Rio Grande Rise contains two subrounded plateaus and a north–south ridge oriented parallel t o the paleo–Mid-Atlantic Ridge axis, whereas Walvis Ridge is a curved linear feature whose morphology changes along its length (Figures F1, F2). Both Rio Grande Rise Massif and the southeastern Rio Grande Rise Massif are split by the prominent northwest–southeast oriented Cruzeiro d o Sul rift. The current explanation for these troughs is a failed Eocene rifting event (Camboa an d Rabinowitz, 1984; Mohriak et al., 2010), which occurred in a midplate setting and has no clea r tectonic cause. A similar rift has been observed at Valdivia Bank (Jimenez Garcia, 2017; Sager e t al., 2021), but its origin is still unknown. Notably, similar rifts are observed at other LIPs such a s the Manihiki Plateau (Danger Island and Suvorov Troughs) (Nakanishi et al., 2015). In contrast, the TGW chain changes morphology along its length from ridge to plateau to elongated ridge s leading to several seamount trails. O’Connor and Jokat (2015a) explained the morphology change s by the interaction of the TGW plume and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and proposed that the seamounts on the ridge represented the best estimate of the actual TGW hotspot track. Homrighausen et al. (2018a, 2019, 2020), however, showed that seamounts atop the original TGW chain for m a secondary hotspot track, ${\sim}30{-}40\ \mathrm{Ma}$ younger than the original TGW edifices (see below). The y also point out that extensional faulting appears to postdate substantial erosion of the originall y subaerial Walvis Ridge, which places its relationship to TGW plume-ridge interaction into question. After the Mid-Atlantic Ridge drifted away from the TGW hotspot, individual seamoun t chains of the Guyot Province were created as the plume and Mid-Atlantic Ridge drifted apar t (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a).  

When all recently published radiometric ages for Walvis Ridge are considered, they show a wid e range of ages (up to $50\;\mathrm{My})$ ) at a single location and only display a crude progression of ages tha t becomes older toward Namibia for much of the Late Cretaceous (Figure F4) (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b; Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019). Nevertheless, Homrighausen et al. (2018a, 2019, 2020) showed that the TGW chain volcanism forms two distinct geochemical types. The basement, which has undergone extensive erosion and faulting, has a Gough-typ e EMI type composition characterized by unradiogenic $\mathrm{^{206}P b/^{204}P b}$ isotope ratios. In contrast, th e younger seamounts on the basement have a high time-integrated $\mathrm{^{238}U/^{204}P b}$ (HIMU)–type composition characterized by radiogenic $\mathrm{^{206}P b/^{204}P b}$ isotope ratios. When only the EMI basement volcanics are considered, they show a tight age progression (Figure F4) (Homrighausen et al., 2019). The HIMU seamount volcanism shows a similar age progression but is offset by ${30{-}40\ \mathrm{My}}$ at  a given location from the EMI basement lavas (Figure F4). The HIMU-type seamounts have bee n interpreted to reflect the passage of Walvis Ridge over a secondary hotspot ${\sim}30{-}40~\mathrm{My}$ after formation of the Walvis Ridge EMI basement. The EMI TGW hotspot was derived from the oute r margin of the LLSVP, and the secondary HIMU hotspot was derived from an internal step in th e LLSVP (Homrighausen et al., 2020). Reconstructions (Figure F5) imply that the main edifices o f Rio Grande Rise and Valdivia Bank were formed together at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between ${\sim}80$ and $90\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Few radiometric dates are available from Rio Grande Rise. Tholeiitic basalt sample s from Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 516 produced radiometric ages of $80{-}87~\mathrm{Ma}$ , and  a dredged alkali basalt from the edge of the Cruzeiro do Sul rift yielded an age of $46\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a). Several authors recognized secondary volcanism in seismi c lines and attributed it to a regional tectonic event of unknown cause (Camboa and Rabinowitz, 1984; Mohriak et al., 2010). Although age data thus far define an excellent age progression for Walvis Ridge, the scant age data from Rio Grande Rise and its complexity do not allow us to properl y assess whether this volcanism is also age progressive in the direction of plate motion.  

# 2.2.2. Did Rio Grande Rise Massif and Valdivia Bank form at a microplate?  

Results from a recent study of Rio Grande Rise–Walvis Ridge tectonics, based on tectonic fabric i n satellite gravity and magnetic data (Sager et al., 2015, 2021; Thoram et al., 2019), reveals tectoni c anomalies associated with the formation of the two large igneous provinces. Seafloor fabri c (orthogonal fracture zones and ridge fault blocks) is quite regular in most of the South Atlantic, except for the area between Rio Grande Rise and Walvis Ridge and magnetic Chron 34 $.83.7\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ; anomaly ages from Ogg, 2020) and Chron 30 $66.3\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . The prominent magnetic anomaly o f Chron 33r appears too early in reconstructions of Walvis Ridge and Rio Grande Rise, implyin g extra (older) material between the two. Coupled with discordant seafloor fabric, it is postulate d that a microplate existed between Rio Grande Rise and Valdivia Bank during the Late Cretaceou s (Figure F6) (Thoram et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). Given reconstructions showing a ring of igneous constructs around the proposed microplate, it is possible that microplate formation affecte d volcanism in both provinces. The cause is thought to be a reorganization of a long-offset fractur e zone during the Late Cretaceous. First located north of Frio Ridge in the northeastern Walvi s Ridge, the fracture zone broke apart between approximately 92 and 68 Ma and reformed as multiple fracture zones farther south (Sager et al., 2021).  

The microplate hypothesis potentially changes the way we interpret the TGW chain and Ri o Grande Rise during their most effusive phase. Rather than developing with a simple age progression, volcanism may have occurred in multiple places simultaneously: for example, at plate boundaries along the rim of the microplate or along the middle TGW chain where fracture zones create d elongated ridges at about the time of the Chron C34 to Chron C30 reorganization. Microplate s often rotate (e.g., Schouten et al., 1993; Bird et al., 1998), which could cause misleading tectoni c trends for hotspot models. In many other settings, ridge reorganizations, microplates, triple junctions, and LIPs occur together (Tamaki and Larson, 1988; Sager et al., 1999; Sager, 2005; Taylor, 2006; Chandler et al., 2012), implying possible linkages among these processes.  

# 2.2.3. Paleolatitude and hotspot motion  

Paleomagnetic polar wander is chiefly ascribed to plate motion (e.g., Butler, 1992). Less recognized are contributions from the movement of the spin axis relative to the entire Earth (i.e., TPW ) (Gold, 1955; Goldreich and Toomre, 1969) and time-varying nondipole geomagnetic field components (Coupland and Van der Voo, 1980; Livermore et al., 1984; McElhinny et al., 1996). Althoug h nondipole fields are generally believed to be small ( $+10\%$ of dipole) (Livermore et al., 1984; McElhinny et al., 1996), TPW can be much larger. The maximum principle axis of inertia may eve n suddenly shift ${\sim}90^{\circ}$ (inertial interchange TPW), causing the spin axis to follow (Kirschvink et al., 1997). Smaller spin axis shifts and oscillations probably also occur, controlled by convective currents and viscoelastic relaxation time of the lithosphere and mantle (Creveling et al., 2012).  

![](images/5ba42cc042a5259d2df66359bc29e5a1c3e083265f001c60f1397b3c0689909d.jpg)  
Figure F5. Bathymetry reconstruction of Rio Grande Rise and Valdivia Bank at 88, 83, and $78\;\mathsf{M a}$ . At 88 Ma, the main Ri o Grande Rise and Valdivia Bank formed at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Around 83 Ma, Rio Grande Rise, Valdivia Bank, and part o f East Rio Grande Rise form a volcanic ring surrounding a small basin that may have contained a microplate (Thoram et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). White line $=$ location of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge inferred from existing age models (Müller et al., 2008). This reconstruction shows bathymetry by crustal age, so features that postdate crustal formation appear too early. For this reason, guyots younger than the seafloor are masked. (From Sager et al., 2021.)  

The difficulty with inferring TPW is that it is hard to define because it requires paleomagneti c data to be compared with an independent geographic reference frame. The hotspot referenc e frame was widely used as a basis to separate plate motions from TPW; the standard procedure wa s to subtract plate motion relative to the hotspots (mantle reference frame) from paleomagneti c polar wander (Gordon, 1987; Besse and Courtillot, 2002). The remaining polar drift was interpreted as TPW. When hotspots were considered fixed relative to the mantle, this comparison wa s simple. Recent research suggesting that hotspots may move relative to one another and to th e mantle owing to convection (Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger e t al., 2004) makes the definition of a hotspot reference frame uncertain. Several studies have tried t o revive the hotspot reference frame by computing an average hotspot reference frame that minimizes interhotspot drift (O’Neill et al., 2005; Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012).  

Even with allowance for moving hotspots, differences occur between the average hotspot reference frame and paleomagnetic polar wander, implying TPW (Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine e t al., 2012; Koivisto et al., 2014). Furthermore, these moving hotspot models produce inconsistencies with other kinematic observations related to past ridge-axis positions (Wessel and Müller, 2016) and regional plate motion reorganizations (Seton et al., 2015). A robust mantle referenc e frame is needed to investigate and understand global surface tectonics and mantle geodynamics. To build such a reference frame, the size, direction, and timing of uniform hotspot drift (caused b y TPW) must be firmly established. This requires better understanding of the paleomagneti c records from hotspots.  

# 2.2.4. Paleolatitudes from scientific drilling in the Pacific  

DSDP and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) samples from the Emperor Seamounts show an offse t from the current hotspot latitude of $\mathrm{\sim}14^{\circ}$ to $15^{\circ}$ for the oldest edifices (Kono, 1980; Tarduno an d Cottrell, 1997; Tarduno et al., 2003). At first, the offset was attributed to TPW (Gordon and Cape, 1981; Gordon, 1982). However, discrepancies and misfits with the hotspot reference frame (e.g., Stock and Molnar, 1987; Cande et al., 1995; Raymond et al., 2000) and models of mantle flow (e.g.,  

![](images/e715b165346e33fc071fc7c70b00a83701b3ba316a9f4e221cefd14c0f852532.jpg)

(From Sager et al., 2021.)  

Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998, 2000; Steinberger, 2000; Steinberger et al., 2004) favored the ide a that hotspots are not fixed in the mantle (Steinberger et al., 2004; Tarduno et al., 2009). Paleomagnetic data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 330 to the Louisville Seamount s showed little motion of the Louisville hotspot in contrast to the large change for the contemporaneous Hawaiian hotspot, implying interhotspot motion consistent with mantle flow models (Koppers et al., 2012). Recently, however, Gordon suggested that interpretations of hotspot motion ar e overblown and that part of the Hawaiian hotspot paleolatitude change resulted from a Cenozoi c episode of TPW (Woodworth and Gordon, 2018; Zheng et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019).  

# 2.2.5. Hotspot motion versus true polar wander  

Although varying degrees of interhotspot motion are widely accepted, TPW cannot be dismissed. It has a robust theoretical underpinning (Gold, 1955; Goldreich and Toomre, 1969; Gordon, 1987; Creveling et al., 2012) and is supported by independent evidence of shifts in paleolatitud e (Kirschvink et al., 1997; Prévot et al., 2000; Doubrovine et al., 2012). The debate about the role o f TPW in hotspot latitude shifts continues because of difficulties in defining an absolute referenc e frame and sparse paleomagnetic data sets. Recent moving hotspot absolute plate motion model s show promise in sorting out these phenomena (O’Neill et al., 2005; Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012), yet the uncertainties of such models are large because of combined uncertainties of plate motion and mantle flow, especially for times earlier than the Cenozoic, when mantl e flow model uncertainties become large (Steinberger, 2000). As noted by Doubrovine et al. (2012), “substantial amounts of TPW at rates varying between ${\sim}0.1^{\circ}/\mathrm{Ma}$ and $1^{\circ}/\mathrm{Ma}^{\prime\prime}$ occur in their globa l moving hotspot model. In fact, TPW is the dominant part of motion between the paleomagneti c axis and hotspots in that model. Thus, it is important to determine the paleolatitude history o f primary hotspots for constraints on hotspot motion and TPW. Even when significant paleomagnetic data exist for the same plate (as is the case for Africa), data from the hotspot track itsel f are critical for deciphering the different processes that contribute to its latitude history.  

# 2.2.6. Paleolatitude changes for the Tristan-Gough-Walvis hotspot  

There are few paleomagnetic data from the TGW chain, so we must look to continental paleomagnetic data. Such data imply significant paleolatitude changes for the TGW chain over the pas t 120 My (Figure F7) (Torsvik et al., 2008; Doubrovine et al., 2012). Between the mid-Cretaceou s and early Cenozoic, there was a rapid southward paleolatitude shift, totaling $\mathrm{\sim}18^{\circ}{-}20^{\circ}$ , from ${\sim}10^{\circ}-$ $12^{\circ}$ north to ${\sim}5^{\circ}{-}7^{\circ}$ south of the current hotspot latitude. This was followed by slow drift northward to the current latitude. These trends are unexpected because they are not predicted b y hotspot models. The total ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ of northward motion implied by Walvis Ridge (Figure F7) can b e explained by the ${\sim}7^{\circ}$ southward motion of the hotspot and the ${\sim}13^{\circ}$ northward motion of the African plate relative to the mantle (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Although this is one model, other moving-hotspot models give similar results (O’Neill et al., 2005; Torsvik et al., 2008), and no mantl e flow models predict northward motion of the hotspot as implied by Cenozoic paleomagnetic data. The difference between the absolute plate motion model and observed paleomagnetic data i s interpreted as TPW (Doubrovine et al., 2012), which may account for both the rapid southwar d shift during the Cretaceous and the northward Cenozoic shift (Figure F7).  

The Cenozoic paleolatitude trend is similar to that expected for TPW rotation that causes a southward paleolatitude shift for the Hawaiian hotspot (as observed) and a northward shift for th e TGW chain hotspot. It is true that the amplitude and timing of the shift appear different in the tw o oceans, but a contributing factor could be averaging: the paleolatitude curve in Figure F7 is a 2 0 My running average that smooths and potentially shifts paleolatitude changes, whereas paleolatitude data from Pacific hotspots cover short time intervals. Coring on the TGW track shoul d show a large paleolatitude change $(\mathrm{\sim}10^{\circ})$ from the oldest Cretaceous site to the early Cenozoi c sites. Moreover, the Cenozoic sites should show a significant departure $\langle{\sim}5^{\circ}$ or 6°) from the present latitude. Given that well-averaged paleolatitudes from coring have uncertainties of ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ , th e predicted paleolatitude shifts are within the resolution of coring studies (Tarduno et al., 2003; Koppers et al., 2012). It is difficult to know beforehand the ages of the planned drill sites. According to a fixed hotspot model (Figure F3) (Torsvik et al., 2008), the guyot sites range ${\sim}45\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Sit e U1578) to $56\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (proposed primary Sites TT-4A, GT-4A), and the Valdivia Bank sites range ${\sim}80-$ $85\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Sites U1576 and U1577) to $95\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Site U1575). A moving hotspot model (Doubrovine e t al., 2012) predicts an age of ${\sim}55\,\mathrm{Ma}$ for Site U1578 and ${\sim}64\,\mathrm{Ma}$ for proposed primary Sites TT-4 A and GT-4A but shows a greater age span along the axis of Valdivia Bank, from ${\sim}85$ Ma for Site s U1576 and U1577 and ${\sim}110\ \mathrm{Ma}$ for Site U1575. Reliable radiometric ages are sparse, but Homrighausen et al. (2019) gave an age of $59\ \mathrm{Ma}$ for the southern end of the ridge upon which Sit e U1578 is located, as well as oldest ages of $81{-}84\ \mathrm{Ma}$ on the southern Valdivia Bank (Sites U157 6 and U1577) and ${\sim}109\,\mathrm{Ma}$ on the northwestern scarp of Frio Ridge (Figure F4).

Red line with dots $=$ estimated paleolatitudes calculated from the global average African plate apparent polar wander pat h (Torsvik et al., 2008) based on a plate motion model with moving hotspots (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Thin vertical lines $=$ $95\%$ confidence limits based on paleomagnetic data scatter only. This polar wander path was constructed with a 20 M y window length, averaged every $10\,\mathsf{M a}$ . Blue line with dots $=$ the same paleolatitude curve for a fixed hotspot model (Torsvi k et al., 2008). Pink square $=a$ paleolatitude determined for 60–75 Ma sediments from Site 525 (Chave, 1984). Its departur e from the paleolatitude curve may be a result of inclination shallowing that is common for sediments (Verosub, 1977). Blac k triangle (NPB), white square (CPB), and purple diamond (SPB) $=$ paleolatitudes from the north, central, and south Paran a flood basalts, respectively (Ernesto et al., 1990, 1999). Orange star $({\mathsf{M}}{\mathsf{C}})=$ paleolatitude of Messum gabbros in the Etendek a province (Renne et al., 2002). Blue band $\left({\mathsf{V K}}92\right)=$ hotspot drift estimated by Van Fossen and Kent (1992). Blue arrows $=$ estimated ages of proposed drill sites from an age progression model (Homrighausen et al., 2019, 2020). Top: northwar d drift and TPW. Red line with circles $=$ paleolatitudes estimated from paleomagnetic data (same as lower plot). Black line $=$ the northward drift of a seamount with time if formed at the Tristan hotspot location (Schlömer et al., 2017), assuming  a fixed hotspot model (Torsvik et al., 2008). Blue line $=a$ moving hotspot model (Doubrovine et al., 2012). Green line $=$ th e paleolatitudes of the Tristan hotspot from a mantle flow model (Doubrovine et al., 2012), indicating ${\sim}7^{\circ}$ southward motio n in $120\;\mathsf{M a}$ . Orange line $=$ the northward drift of the African plate in the moving hotspot model (Doubrovine et al., 2012). I t is less than the fixed hotspot model because the Tristan hotspot is modeled as moving south. Adding the hotspot motio n to the moving hotspot model absolute motion equals the total northward motion indicated by the morphology of the TG W chain and the fixed hotspot model. All absolute motion models indicate that the African plate moved nearly monotonicall y northward, so they do not explain the rapid southward shift in paleolatitudes during the Late Cretaceous or the northwar d offset of paleolatitudes during the early Cenozoic. The difference between modeled and observed paleolatitudes implie s significant TPW (purple curve) (Doubrovine et al., 2012).  

# 2.3. Geochemical setting  

# 2.3.1. Geochemistry and isotopic zonation  

Increasingly, spatial geochemical zonation, present as subparallel geographically and geochemically distinct domains, is observed along hotspot tracks, including Hawaii, Galápagos, Samoa, Marquesas, Discovery, and TGW (e.g., Hoernle et al. 2000; Werner et al., 2003; Abouchami et al., 2005; Weis et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011; Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Schwindrofsk a et al., 2016; Harrison et al. 2017; Homrighausen et al., 2019). The TGW hotspot track, whic h includes Walvis Ridge, Guyot Province, and active island groups around Tristan da Cunha an d Gough Islands, has been recognized as the longest lived zoned hotspot system, displaying ${\sim}70$ M y of zonation (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2019), compared t o possibly 6.5 My for Hawaii (Harrison et al., 2017) and ${\sim}20$ My for Galápagos (Hoernle et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003). Between ${\sim}115$ and $70\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and ${\sim}85$ and $6.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , the enriched Gough and mor e depleted Kea components dominated the composition of the TGW and Hawaiian hotspot track, respectively (Portnyagin et al., 2008; Hoernle et al., 2015; Harrison et al., 2017; Homrighausen e t al., 2019). Modeling suggests that a zoned hotspot track reflects bilateral zonation of and lamina r flow within the plume stem, thus preserving evidence for distinct chemical reservoirs in the sourc e region (e.g., Kerr and Mériaux, 2005; Lohmann et al., 2009; Farnetani and Samuel, 2005; Farnetan i et al., 2012). Although most zoned hotspot tracks identified thus far consist of dual distinct chemical domains oriented parallel to the hotspot track, Hoernle et al. (2000) showed that the Galápagos hotspot track displays trilateral zonation and argued for trilateral zonation of the plume bu t noted that the central geochemical stripe may result from mixing of material from the outer tw o stripes. Modeling showed that such zonation is possible if the plume samples three distinct geochemical reservoirs at its base (Lohmann et al., 2009). New isotope data from Guyot Provinc e dredge samples (Class et al., 2014, 2015; Sager et al., 2020) identified a possible third, intermediat e zone in 3D Pb isotopic space (Figures F8, F9), suggesting that the Tristan-Gough hotspot trac k may be formed by a long-lived, triple-zoned plume. If confirmed by drilling that the triple zonatio n does not result simply from mixing of the Tristan and Gough domains at their boundary, it woul d place tight constraints on the possible spatial distribution of components in the plume sourc e (Lohmann et al., 2009). Geochemical zonation has not been found in the older TGW chain (Figur e F9), leading Hoernle et al. (2015) and Homrighausen et al. (2019) to suggest that at ${\sim}70\ \mathrm{Ma}$ th e plume source area either began to suck in Tristan-type material from outside the LLSVP margin, due to having exhausted Gough material near the boundary, or the base of the plume moved s o that it straddled the boundary between LLSVP and surrounding ambient mantle. Plume zonatio n places important constraints on plume dynamics and heterogeneity of the lower mantle at th e LLSVP boundaries.

Figure F8. 3D plot of the Pb isotopic composition of TGW hotspot track samples, Expedition 391. Spatial geochemical zonation indicates a triple-zoned plume (Class et al., 2015) where new data from dredge samples extend the previously identified dual zonation (Rohde et al., $2013\mathsf{a}_{\prime}$ Hoernle et al., 2015). Gough track $=$ red, orange, purple; Tristan track $=$ blue; Cente r track $=$ green. Only high-precision Pb isotope data are shown, and uncertainty is smaller than the symbol size. Sample s from the Tristan track with added depleted component with high $\mathsf{H f},$ high Nd, and low Sr isotopic composition are no t shown for clarity (Figure F11). Data sources: Salters and Sachi-Kocher (2010), Rohde et al. (2013a), Hoernle et al. (2015), an d Homrighausen et al. (2019). New data on Gough, Tristan, and Inaccessible Islands as well as seamounts sampled by MV120 3 and older dredge samples from McNish and RSA by Class (unpubl. data).  

Although dredge data from the TGW chain provide a foundation for identifying the evolution o f source zonation and plume-ridge interaction (Rohde et al., 2013a, 2013b; Hoernle et al., 2015; Class et al., 2014, 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019, 2020), fundamental questions remai n about source geometry, heterogeneity (how many end-members are required to explain the geochemical zonation?), and plume dynamics (O’Connor et al., 2012) that are important to furthe r our understanding of the global spectrum of plume systems. Is zonation of the TGW plum e caused by contributions from the LLSVP to one (or more) of the zones? What can this tell us abou t lower mantle heterogeneity, including LLSVP heterogeneity? Is TGW plume zonation linked t o the split into separate chains, as suggested by Rohde et al. (2013b)? What is the role of plume-ridg e interaction in both the morphology of the plume trail and the geochemically distinct subparalle l trends? To further address these questions, IODP drill core sampling is required.  

Geochemical observations are limited by dredging because we do not know the stratigraphic relationship between different samples in a dredge. Dredges also generally only sample exposed unit s and thus often don’t provide more than a single composition (e.g., same lava flow sampled multipl e times) for individual dredge sites, in this case representing only a single point in compositiona l space. In contrast, sampling of the islands and DSDP Site 527 showed a compositional range (Figure F10, black outlines), representing (temporal/downhole) geochemical variability (e.g., Salter s and Sachi-Kocher, 2010). The potentially triple-zoned TGW plume can possibly be described by  a set of five linear binary mixing arrays in 3D Pb isotopic space, four of which are defined by array s of island or drill site samples, namely Gough (forms two arrays), Tristan-Inaccessible, and DSD P Sites 527 and 528 (Figure F10). Only new drill cores can provide sufficient data to test whethe r there is indeed a geochemically distinct Center track (green in Figures F8, F9, F10, F11) (Class e t al., 2014, 2015) or it simply reflects a mixture the two outer (Tristan and Gough) geochemica l domains, as is also possible for the central track identified in the Galápagos hotspot track (Hoernl e et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003). Furthermore, detailed isotopic studies, including isotopes of Os, rare gases, and other isotope systems for which appropriate material has not yet been recovered b y dredging, could provide evidence that the Center track lavas are derived from a distinct sourc e that cannot be explained by mixing of Tristan and Gough compositional end-members. As note d above, isotope data for the different units at a drill site can form arrays on isotope diagrams, whic h could help distinguish between the aforementioned possibilities. If the arrays from different site s extend from the Gough to Tristan compositional domain, then mixing of Tristan and Gough is th e more likely origin of the central domain. If the central samples form an array that is subparallel t o the Tristan and Gough domains, or if additional isotope systems show that the central domain ha s a composition that cannot be explained by mixing of Gough and Tristan compositions, this woul d argue for a distinct intermediate third domain. Most present models of plume zonation attribut e the zonation to sampling of the LLSVP margin by part of the plume base and sampling of th e ambient mantle surrounding the LLSVP. In the simplest case, this should result in two geochemically distinct compositional fields that are not directly related. Evidence for an additional geochemical zone would place this simple model into question, requiring the presence of three o r more distinct chemical reservoirs at the plume base (Lohmann et al., 2009). Zonation of the Discovery plume, with distinct zones of Gough-type material in the north and even more enriche d and distinct EMI-type material in the south (but no evidence of the Tristan composition), indicates that the model proposed thus far to explain Tristan-Gough zonation may be too simpl e (Schwindrofska et al., 2016). If the Gough and Tristan tracks share a common end-member (e.g., low $\mathrm{^{206}P b/^{204}P b)}$ , defined by the intersection of three main geographic arrays (Figure F10), thi s could also call into question the simple model that the LLSVP is the global cause for plume zonation because it would imply that all three TGW zones share at least one common end-member.

Gough track $=$ red, purple; Tristan track $=$ blue, turquois e (depleted), yellow (plume-ridge); Center track $=$ green. The three tracks are highlighted with transparent lines (that do no t reflect plate motion) that connect most of the samples of each compositional zone and demonstrate the mostly spatiall y well separated zones (though there is some overlap). Only the north prong of the TGW chain after the split shows geochemical evidence for interaction of the plume with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In contrast, Tristan track samples with depleted compositions can be found over the entire length of the Tristan track. The older Walvis Ridge (red circles) shows no chemica l zonation but extends the Gough track signature (Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2019).

Spatial geochemical zonation of the TGW hotspot track in $^{206}{\sf P b}/^{204}{\sf P b}$ vs. ${}^{207}\mathsf{P b}/{}^{204}\mathsf{P b}$ space, justifying the nee d for drilling, Expedition 391. The compositional range is described as linear mixing arrays, and $95\%$ confidence belts ar e shown. Highlighted are DSDP 527 and 528, Tristan Island group, and Gough Island samples, which show that the island s and drill sites show compositional variability that define mixing arrays. In contrast, dredge locations generally give only on e compositional point. The few dredge locations that gave a compositional range are outlined and generally follow mixin g arrays. Drilling can help test the triple-zoned plume model; a drill site in each of the three zones should give arrays that ar e parallel to the proposed mixing arrays. If the Center zone instead shows mixing between the Gough and Tristan end-members (compositional array perpendicular to the Center track), this will support the current model that zoned plumes sampl e the LLSVP margin and the ambient mantle outside of the LLSVP. Gough track $=$ orange, red, purple; Center track $=$ green, purple; Tristan track $=$ blue, purple; DSDP Site $525\mathsf{A}=$ purple dots. Samples from the Tristan track with added deplete d component with high Hf, high Nd, and low Sr isotopic composition are not shown for clarity and not included for confidence belt calculations. All three tracks share the DSDP Site 525 end-member.  

Nevertheless, this could also point to mixing of ambient mantle with three distinct component s with radiogenic $\tt P b$ isotopes from the LLSVP. Being able to define small-scale trends in drill core s (especially if there is deeper penetration of the volcanic sequence, e.g., ${\geq}200~\mathrm{m}$ ) can help us sor t out the origin of the different components.  

The recent identification in $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Pb}}$ isotopic space of zoned plumes containing more than two distinc t chemical zones—Galápagos (Hoernle et al., 2000), Samoa (Jackson et al., 2014), and TGW (Clas s et al., 2014, 2015)—provide an opportunity to further refine our understanding of the dynami c process of source sampling by plumes. For Samoa, the mixing relationship between He and P b isotopic data is best explained by an LLSVP-sourced, high- $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ plume matrix that hosts an d mixes with several distinct low $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ end-members representing subducted slabs that overli e the LLSVP (Jackson et al., 2014). In the case of the TGW, Discovery, and Shona plumes in th e South Atlantic, the Gough composition, the main end-member in all three hotspots, has bee n attributed to the LLSVP, whereas the Tristan and Southern Discovery components could reflect  a heterogenous ambient mantle outside of the LLSVP and/or heterogeneity within the LLSVP (consisting of primarily Gough but also more enriched pockets in Southern Discovery). Unlike Samoa, the Gough compositional domain in the hotspot tracks does not generally appear to serve as  a matrix for the other components such as Southern Discovery and only in a very limited fashion fo r the TGW composition. Galápagos (Hoernle et al., 2000; Werner et al., 2003), Samoa (Jackson et al., 2014), Discovery (Schwindrofska et al., 2016), and the unpublished data for the TGW syste m (Class et al., 2014, 2015) suggested that plume zonation could be considerably more complex tha n models simply explaining dual chemical tracts. To gain further insights as to whether the TG W hotspot consists primarily of two compositionally and geographically distinct compositional field s or it instead consists of multiple distinct binary mixing arrays, we need samples from stratigraphi c sequences of samples at single locations to see whether each such sequence forms a distinct binar y array and/or whether the data fall in distinct compositional fields for a given geographic locatio n or zone. Using additional isotope systems, if appropriate material is recovered, could also she d further light on plume zonation.  

O’Connor and Jokat (2015a, 2015b) proposed that the north side of Walvis Ridge, including th e Tristan track of the morphological split, was formed by plume-ridge interaction, whereas the Center track and Gough track were formed by intraplate plume volcanism. Geochemical signatures o f plume-ridge interaction are only found in dredge samples from the Tristan track (Figure F11, yellow circles) (Class, unpubl. data) and seamounts north of Walvis Ridge (Homrighausen et al., 2019) but not in the rest of Walvis Ridge (Figure F11) (Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2019). The proposed drill sites at Valdivia Bank and Frio Ridge lie toward the north side of Walvi s Ridge and can further test the model of plume-ridge interaction. Because it samples all thre e prongs (on- and off-ridge seamounts), the transect of proposed drill sites across the split will clarify the role of plume-ridge interaction and the end-member compositions from the plume contributing to each of the three seamount trails.

Only the most depleted samples (yellow) are displaced toward Sout h Atlantic MORB compositions (orange $=$ MORB $30^{\circ}{-}55^{\circ}\mathsf{S};$ ; black $=$ MORB $0^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathsf{S})$ , providing geochemical evidence for plume-ridge interaction (also MORB-typ e depleted trace element patterns, not shown here). Data sources: Salters and Sachi-Kocher (2010), Rohde et al. (2013a), Hoernle et al. (2015), and Homrighausen et al., (2019).  

Recently, samples from seamounts in the TGW chain, interpreted by O’Connor and Jokat (2015b ) to represent the Tristan-Gough plume track, were found to have a distinct composition from th e TGW basement (Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019). The eastern TGW basement generally has  a flat top with some graben structures cutting it, and younger seamount volcanoes are located o n top of the flat-topped ridge. This deformation has been related to plume-ridge interactio n (O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a), but it must postdate the erosion of Walvis Ridge, placing plumeridge interaction for the cause of this deformation into question. The EMI (Gough and Tristan)– type basement shows an excellent age progression of about $30\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ (Figure F4). In contrast to th e EMI-type compositions of the Walvis Ridge basement, the younger seamounts, which also sho w an age progression but with ${\sim}30$ My younger ages on average than the EMI basement at a give n location, have compositions extending from end-member St. Helena HIMU to enriched midocean-ridge basalt (MORB)–type mantle (Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019). An important question that might be addressed through drilling is to find a stratigraphic sequence with HIMU-typ e lavas overlying EMI-type lavas or the presence of HIMU dikes/sills within the EMI basemen t sequence.  

Previous scientific drilling has demonstrated that fresh olivine-bearing volcanic rocks and glas s are commonly recovered. Olivines and volcanic glass are highly susceptible to alteration by seawater contact, and thus dredging rarely retrieves such samples, in particular fresh olivine. Fres h glass can provide the liquid composition and preserve accurate abundances of volatile elements, such as $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , S, and Cl. Fresh olivines can be used for a variety of analytical purposes, includin g analyses of He isotopes to test for high $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ and thus a lower mantle origin of the material an d to constrain further the degassing history of the Earth (Class and Goldstein, 2005; Tolstikhin an d Hofmann, 2005; Jackson and Carlson, 2011). Thus far, high $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ ratios above MORB value s $\left(>10\ \mathrm{R/Ra}\right)$ have not been found along the Tristan-Gough hotspot track. In contrast to the othe major plumes that show bilateral zonation (Hawaii, Galápagos, and Samoa), no high $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ signature has been identified for the TGW chain. High $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ isotope ratios, however, have bee n found in samples with Gough-type Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions where the Discovery an d Shona hotspots are interacting with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sarda et al., 2000). If high He isotopi c ratios are found in olivines from drill samples along the TGW hotspot track, they could hel p unravel which components may be derived from the LLSVP. Olivine can also provide importan t information about the contents of primitive (early and deeply trapped) volatile elements in mel t inclusions and of the composition of primitive and in some cases possibly primary melts. They ca n be used to determine O isotopes to evaluate the involvement of continental material in the sourc e of the magmas, which has been postulated for the EMI signature found in Walvis Ridge lavas. Finally, olivine chemistry can help determine the source lithology, constraining the relative role o f pyroxenite versus peridotite in the source of oceanic basalts. This will allow for the assessment o f the role of recycled oceanic crust in plume sources and thus provide insights into the geodynami c evolution of Earth’s mantle (Sobolev et al., 2005).  

It has been proposed that Valdivia Bank and Rio Grande Rise Massif are continental fragment s (van der Linden, 1980; Santos et al., 2019). Continental rocks and zircons have been found in othe r large volcanic provinces, such as Kerguelen Plateau and Broken Ridge (Frey et al., 2002; Ingle et al., 2002), Iceland (Torsvik et al., 2015), and Mauritius (Torsvik et al., 2013). This relationship is uncertain but may reflect the transport of continental slivers into the ocean basins during continenta l rifting (Torsvik et al., 2015). Although gravity fabric within Valdivia Bank implies that its formation is related to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Sager et al., 2021), the continental fragment hypothesi s can be tested by coring Valdivia Bank to see if lavas show geochemical signals of assimilatio n during fractional crystallization.  

During Expedition 391, we drilled the Center track to confirm or dismiss the triple-zoned plum e model versus a mixed center zone model (Site U1578). Core samples from Valdivia Bank (Site s U1576 and U1577) and Frio Ridge (Site U1575) will test the lack of zonation in the older Walvi s Ridge and a possible continental fragment at Valdivia Bank. All sites can potentially provide samples with which we can test the role of lower mantle as the source of the various components, a s well as the geochemical fingerprints of plume-ridge interactions. In addition, the cores will b e used to test for temporal changes in composition during the formation of the TGW hotspot track, whether they are on the scale of a single hole or whether they occur during the longer term histor y of the hotspot. Finally, detailed major and trace element data combined with isotope geochemistr y can be used to evaluate magma system dynamics during the growth of individual volcanic structures in the Guyot Province and the eastern Walvis Ridge, and volcanological studies can be use d to evaluate the detailed growth of parts of these structures through time and magma-water interactions.  

# 2.4. Prior drilling results from Walvis Ridge  

A small number of sites were drilled on Walvis Ridge, and most only cored the sedimentary section. During DSDP Leg 39, Site 359 was drilled atop one of the Walvis Ridge Guyot Province seamounts (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1977), and during DSDP Leg 40, Sites 362 and 363 were core d on Frio Ridge near the continental margin (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1978). Coring at Site 35 9 penetrated only 107 meters below seafloor (mbsf) and ended in Eocene volcaniclastic sediment s and breccia (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1977), whereas coring at Sites 362 and 363 penetrate d 1081 and 715 mbsf, respectively, and ended in Eocene and Aptian limestone, respectively.  

During DSDP Leg 74, five sites (525–529) were drilled across Walvis Ridge between $2^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ . Al l sites recovered Cenozoic to Late Cretaceous carbonate sediments, and three penetrated into igneous crust (Site $525=103\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{z}}$ ; Site $527{=}~43~\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ ; Site $528\mathrm{=}~80~\mathrm{m}$ ) (Moore et al., 1984). At these thre e sites, basement recovery was high (average $=62\%$ ), and basalt flows with intercalated sediment s were recovered. Radiometric dates at the sites range $68{-}72\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , with one exception that was to o young (Rohde et al., 2013b; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b). During DSDP Leg 75, Sites 530 and 53 2 were drilled on or near Frio Ridge, not far from the continental margin (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1984a). Coring at Site 530, which is located in the Angola Basin immediately north of Frio Ridge, penetrated $1121\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sedimentary section, recovering Late Albian sediments atop basalt flow s (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1984a). Coring at Site 532, located atop Frio Ridge at $10.5^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ , penetrated $291\,\textrm{m}$ of sediments, the oldest of which is of Miocene age (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1984a). ODP Leg 208 revisited the Leg 74 transect but cored only the sedimentary section for paleoceanographic studies (Sites 1262–1267) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004).  

Away from the continental margin, most cored sediments are open ocean carbonates. These res t atop shallow water carbonate sediments and basalt at the base of the section. Both Legs 74 and 20 8 recovered Cenozoic nannofossil or foraminifera ooze grading to ooze and chalk at $200{-}300~\mathrm{mbsf}$ (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1978, 2004). This sedimentary section is often $300{-}500\,\mathrm{m}$ thick, ranging in age from Paleocene–Eocene to Neogene. Distinct basal sediments atop igneous basemen t have only been cored at a few sites; volcanic breccia were recovered at Site 359 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1977), and volcanogenic turbidites and carbonate sand were recovered at Sites 526, 528, and 529 (Moore et al., 1984). Cores from Sites 359 and 526, which are both located on guyot tops, suggest the possibility of volcaniclastic sections on seamount summits. At Site 359, shipboard scientists conjectured a volcaniclastic layer ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ thick based on a single core and a poor-qualit y seismic profile (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1977). At Site 526, coring penetrated $114\;\mathrm{m}$ of Eocen e carbonate sands and sandstone that contain $20\%{-}40\%$ volcanic debris (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1984b). Summarizing these prior results, drilling on low-slope seamount flanks should encounte r a thin cover of open ocean calcareous ooze and chalk overlying basalt flows. On seamount summits, open-ocean carbonates may be underlain by a basal layer of shallow water carbonates an d volcaniclastics.  

# 3. Site survey data and site selection  

# 3.1. Site selection  

The proposal for Expedition 391 was based initially on four modern multichannel seismic profile s collected by German scientists on the research vessels (R/V) Meteor and Polarstern. This data paucity is a result of years of underfunding of seismic investigations in the Southern Ocean. Nevertheless, we were lucky to have these data. Without them, the Walvis Ridge proposal would not hav e passed evaluation by the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP). Although the initia l lines had no seismic cross-lines, which are normally done for IODP site surveys, sites wer e approved on the recognition that seamount flanks have relatively simple structure, with gentl y sloping flanks consisting of lava flows covered with a thin layer of sediment. It is possible to infe r the flank slopes and direction, and there are no known safety hazards. The primary sites propose d from these initial data were Sites CT-4A, GT-4A, TT-1A, VB-1B, VB-4B, and FR-1B. These si x primary sites and an additional eight alternate sites were approved at the September 2018 EPS P meeting.  

Subsequently, a site survey proposal was funded by the US National Science Foundation to collec t seismic data over Walvis Ridge. This survey (R/V Thomas G. Thompson, Cruise TN373) was carried out in late 2019. New seismic lines were run across the three previously targeted guyots an d Valdivia Bank. These lines also crossed most of the previously proposed sites. An additional 1 4 new sites were proposed and accepted by the EPSP at the February 2020 meeting. Three of th e previously approved sites were replaced with new sites. Proposed Site TT-4A, on the lower flan k of the TT guyot, replaced proposed Site TT-1A because of the latter’s proximity to a summit cone, revealed by the new seismic data, that may represent later volcanism. Proposed Site VB-12A, o n the east flank of Valdivia Bank, replaced proposed Site VB-1B to provide a site on the east flank o f the plateau. Proposed Site VB-14A replaced proposed Site VB-4B on the west flank of Valdivi a Bank. The new seismic line shows rough basement and diffractions near the old site that may represent a fault zone. The new site is upslope on basement that appears less fractured. Aside fro m the 6 primary sites, the remaining 22 sites were retained as alternates so that if problems arise at  a primary site, there are alternates nearby.  

Of the four sites cored on Expedition 391, two were alternate sites. As planned, Site U1575 wa s cored at proposed primary Site FR-1B, and Site U1576 was cored at proposed primary Site VB14A. Owing to severe time constraints in the revised plan, Site U1577 was cored at alternate Sit e VB-13A and Site U1578 was cored at alternate Site CT-5A. In both cases, the alternate was chose n because it had less sediment cover, which meant less time was devoted to coring sediments.  

# 3.2. Seismic data from the Meteor and Polarstern cruises  

The four initial seismic lines are GeoB01-25, GeoB01-29, AWI-20060650, and AWI-20060660. The GeoB profiles were collected from the R/V Meteor during Cruise 49 Leg 1, which was completed in 2001. Seismic data collected during this cruise were used as site survey data for ODP Le g 208. The two AWI profiles were obtained from the R/V Polarstern during Expedition ANT-XXII I Leg 5 in 2006. Both cruises used GPS for positioning. The Polarstern cruise collected bathymetr y data with a Krupp-Atlas Hydrosweep multibeam echosounder. The multibeam on the Meteor wa s not working at the time of the survey.  

Meteor seismic data were collected with a 48-channel streamer, $600\,\mathrm{m}$ in length, which was kept a t the desired depth by 10 DigiCourse birds. The source had three components: two generator-injector (GI) air guns and a water gun. The GI guns had generator and injector volumes of $0.41\,\mathrm{~L~}$ ( a reduced-volume source) and $1.7\,\mathrm{L}$ and were towed at a depth of $1.4\,\mathrm{m}$ . The water gun volume wa s $0.16\,\mathrm{L}$ , and it was towed at a $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$ depth. Shots were fired at ${\sim}10$ s intervals, producing shot intervals of ${\sim}30{-}35\;\mathrm{m},$ , but the GI guns were alternated.  

Polarstern seismic data were collected as a part of a larger effort that included seismic refraction. The seismic source was therefore large: four air guns with $8.5\,\mathrm{L}$ volume operated at 190 bar pressure. The streamer had a total length of $800\;\mathrm{m}$ , with an active section $600\;\mathrm{m}$ in length, containin g  

96 channels with $6.25\,\mathrm{~m~}$ hydrophone spacing. The shooting interval was $15\ s$ , producing sho t intervals of ${\sim}35\;\mathrm{m}$ . The streamer was towed at a depth of $10\,\mathrm{m}$ , whereas the air guns were towed a t a depth of $5\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

The processing of the seismic data from these two cruises was as follows. As a first step, eac h profile was binned to a common midpoint (CMP) interval of $15\;\mathrm{m}$ , resulting in a fold of up to 1 4 and 18 in GeoB and AWI lines, respectively. The sampling rate of GeoB profiles was reduced to 0. 5 ms to match the frequency content of source signal $(20{-}250\,\mathrm{~Hz)}$ . After removing corrup t traces/channels and adding a recording delay of up to $5\ s$ , a 2D spike removal within individua l channels was performed. Data were then corrected for normal moveout (NMO) with a velocity o f $1500~\mathrm{m/s}$ . A static correction was applied to eliminate wave motion effects, and spike remova l within shot gathers was performed before stacking. CMP stacked data then underwent frequenc y filtering: a Butterworth filter of 10/25/550/860 Hz and an adjustable notch filter aroun d $47/49/51/53\ \mathrm{Hz}$ were applied. Trace interpolation was used to fill missing CMP locations. Whit e noise reduction preceded the final step, which was finite difference time migration $(1500\ \mathrm{m/s},\,1$ ms tau step, and a filtered $45^{\circ}{-}65^{\circ}$ solution). Processing of AWI lines followed a similar sequence. Data manipulation included an initial debias. Static corrections were not performed. Rather tha n frequency filtering, an F-K filter was applied to CMP-stacked data to remove noise stripes withi n the signal frequency range. Because of the lower data sampling rate, time migration was carrie d out with an 8 tau step.  

# 3.3. Site survey data from the Thomas G. Thompson cruise  

New site survey data were collected during R/V Thomas G. Thompson Cruise TN373 in November–December 2019. A total of ${\sim}3015\,\mathrm{km}$ of 2D multichannel seismic profiles were collected wit h the Scripps Institution of Oceanography multichannel seismic system, which consists of a 96- channel Geometrics GeoEel streamer and two Sercel $45{-}105\ \mathrm{in}^{3}$ (0.16–0.37 L) GI air guns as  a source. Swath bathymetry data were obtained with a $30\ \mathrm{kHz}$ Kongsberg EM302 multibeam system. Subbottom profiles were recorded with a Knudsen Model 3260 CHIRP sonar operating at 3. 5 kHz frequency.  

The multichannel system was towed at a speed of $4.5{-}5.0\,\mathrm{kt}$ $(8.3{-}9.3\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h})$ ), and shots were fire d on distance at $25\textrm{m}$ intervals. Because the GeoEel streamer has a group spacing of $6.25\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , thi s speed provided 12-fold coverage, with CMP spacing of $3.125\;\mathrm{m}$ . Data were digitized at an interva l of 1 ms and recorded in SEGD format shot files. The seismic streamer was towed at a depth of $4\,\mathrm{m}$ , and depth was maintained by four depth controllers (birds). Electronic compasses in the bird s were used to calculate the geometry and position of the streamer so that accurate CMP position s could be calculated. The source air guns were towed at a depth of $3\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

Processing was done with GeoEast software from BGP. Preprocessing included removing duplicate shot records, fixing incorrect shot locations, and removing malfunctioning receiver records. For statics correction, the source delay was fixed by adding a constant $50\,\mathrm{m}$ shift to the data. Swell, linear, and wild noise attenuation were applied to lessen swell, linear, and high-amplitude noise, respectively. Deghosting was done to reduce the signal reflected from the ocean surface. Fo r debubbling, a matching filter was determined from the source wavelet and this signal was remove d from the data. Surface multiples were predicted and attenuated using the SRME module i n GeoEast. Root mean square velocity profiles were determined with semblance analysis, typicall y done every 300 CMP but sometimes more often in areas with complex structure. Prior to stacking, NMO was removed along with stretch muting and $8{-}200~\mathrm{Hz}$ bandpass filtering. For poststac k migration, root mean square velocities were converted to interval velocity and finite-differenc e migration was carried out in the x-t domain.  

# 4. Scientific objectives  

Expedition 391 addresses the geodynamic implications of the TGW hotspot track, the most prominent in the Atlantic, to improve our understanding of the global spectrum of hotspot volcanism. Primary questions include the following:  

• Is Walvis Ridge split into two or three seamount chains and isotopic zonation consistent with involvement of two or three distinct plume sources at the LLSVP edge, as proposed for bilaterally zoned Pacific hotspots?   
• Is the chain strictly age progressive, or were there plume pulses, microplates, or continental fragments involved?   
• What do potentially large shifts in paleolatitude reveal about the fixity and geodynamics of the hotspot?  

JOIDES Resolution cored sediments and basaltic lava flows at four sites that aimed at coring $\mathord{\sim}100$ m of lava flows at three sites (U1575–U1577) and ${\sim}250~\mathrm{m}$ at one site (U1578). Basalt samples wil l be analyzed to document the geochemical and isotopic evolution of the TGW hotspot, testing th e hypothesis of geochemical division into two or three distinct geographic geochemical zones beginning at ${\sim}70$ Ma. Research at Site U1578 will test whether a third geochemical reservoir wa s involved in the formation of the younger hotspot track. High-precision geochronology from igneous samples will test models of ridge-hotspot interaction, including a microplate model; examin e the duration of volcanism at individual sites; and further document the age progression. Paleomagnetic measurements on igneous samples will constrain paleolatitude changes of the hotspo t track, allowing for more rigorous testing of models of hotspot motion and TPW.

Many hotspot models assume that Valdivia Bank is an age-progressive segment of Walvis Ridg e that becomes younger to the south (e.g., Doubrovine et al., 2012). Others suggest that this edific e formed along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge crest (O’Connor and Jokat, 2015b), perhaps because of interaction with a microplate (Thoram et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021), which implies that the entir e edifice is nearly the same age. Although there is considerable overlap in ages, when the samples ar e divided based on geochemistry the EMI- and HIMU-type samples form distinct age-progressiv e trends, suggesting that some of the complications may result from late-stage volcanism coverin g much of the older Valdivia Bank structure (Homrighausen et al., 2018a, 2019, 2020). High-precision geochronology data will test whether there is an age progression in the basement lavas alon g the Valdivia Bank, as expected from the plume model, or whether it formed synchronously over  a large area, as implied by the ridge-crest or microplate models. High-precision geochemical dat a will indicate the genetic relationship between Valdivia Bank, Rio Grande Rise, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  

# 4.1.2. Does Valdivia Bank contain a continental fragment?  

Although no longer widely accepted, it has been proposed that Valdivia Bank is a continental fragment (van der Linden, 1980). Evidence of continental material has been found in other oceani c plateaus: Kerguelen Plateau (Frey et al., 2002; Ingle et al., 2002), Mauritius (Torsvik et al., 2013), and Iceland (Torsvik et al., 2015). Furthermore, the same has been suggested for Rio Grande Ris e (Santos et al., 2019), so the idea cannot yet be dismissed. Coring on Valdivia Bank can help test thi s idea, either through direct drilling of continental rocks or by showing continental crustal contamination in the geochemistry of the recovered rocks or as xenocrysts (e.g., quartz or zircon) o r xenoliths of continental crust. If continental material is found, it will indicate that the continenta l fragment hypothesis is correct, although lack of such evidence is unlikely to disprove the hypothesis because it can be argued that such evidence was simply missed by limited coring.  

# 4.1.3. Is Valdivia Bank a product of ridge volcanism?  

Recent magnetic studies of Shatsky Rise found linear magnetic anomalies covering the entire plateau, leading to the conclusion that the plateau was formed by seafloor spreading (Huang et al., 2018; Sager et al., 2019). Geochemical studies indicated that Shatsky Rise rocks have composition s of enriched MORB (Sano et al., 2012) and formed with higher percentage $(15\%{-}23\%)$ of partia l melt than MORB (Husen et al., 2013; Heydolph et al., 2014). Plate reconstructions imply tha t Ontong Java Plateau also formed at or near a spreading ridge (Mahoney and Spencer, 1991; Taylor, 2006) with high degrees of partial melting $(30\%)$ (Fitton and Godard, 2004). Magnetic anomalie s over Valdivia Bank imply that it also formed by spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Thoram et al.,  

2019; Sager et al., 2021). Evidence for the involvement of MORB in the EMI-type basement lavas, however, is not obvious (Hoernle et al., 2015; Homrighausen et al., 2019). Thus, geochemical studies of Valdivia Bank lavas can provide improved knowledge of the process by which oceanic plateaus form in conjunction with spreading ridges. If olivines are recovered, they can be used a s geothermometers to infer the temperature of melting. Major and trace elements can be used t o infer percentages of partial melting involved in forming the basalts.  

# 4.1.4. Does Walvis Ridge split into three distinct isotopic signatures?  

Studies of isotope ratios show that Walvis Ridge splits into two distinct isotopic signatures nea r the location where the chain splits into three separate seamount chains, at an age of ${\sim}70$ M a (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015). Preliminary isotopic studies suggest that the middl e seamount chain may itself have a different signature and that the younger part of the TG W hotspot track possibly displays three distinct geochemical zones (Class et al., 2015). Because isotopic zoning is thought to arise from heterogeneities at the base of a mantle plume (Farnetani an d Samuel, 2005; Farnetani and Hofmann, 2009; Farnetani et al., 2012; Lohmann et al., 2009), perhap s at the LLSVP edge (Rohde et al., 2013a; Hoernle et al., 2015; Schwindrofska et al., 2016), th e answer to this question has important implications for mantle geodynamics. Expedition 391 originally planned to drill all three seamount chains to allow geochemical and isotopic tests of zonation. Of these, only Site U1578 was cored, with the rationale that this site would provide rocks tha t are geochemically unique or contain a mixture of components from Tristan and Gough end-members.  

# 4.1.5. Is the isotopic split related to the morphological split into separate seamount chains?  

The northernmost seamount chain (Tristan track) appears to have formed by hotspot interactio n with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, whereas the other two seamount chains (Center track and Goug h track) formed from (a) hotspot(s) beneath the African plate (O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a). Can th e isotopic differences be explained by on-ridge versus off-ridge formation? This question can b e answered by comparing geochemical and isotopic data from cored igneous rocks on the Trista n track to samples from the Center and Gough tracks.  

# 4.1.6. What is the paleolatitude motion of the hotspot?  

Basaltic rocks are excellent magnetic field recorders and have been used to measure the paleolatitude of other hotspots: Hawaii (Tarduno et al., 2003) and Louisville (Koppers et al., 2012). Coring targeted Walvis Ridge igneous basement with the objective of collecting enough samples t o calculate a precise paleolatitude for the mid-Late Cretaceous (Valdivia Bank; ${\sim}84{-}103\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) an d Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic (guyots; $55{-}65\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). In addition, coring will penetrate a sedimentary section that may contain lithified carbonate sediments that can also be used to estimat e paleolatitude. These paleolatitude data can record changes that can be compared with geodynamic models of hotspot motion and TPW.  

# 4.2. Drilling and coring strategy  

The plan for Expedition 391 included coring at six primary sites on Walvis Ridge in two groups o f three, but that plan was truncated to four sites. Sites U1575–U1577 cross Valdivia Bank from wes t to east and north to south (Figure F1) to test age and formation models for that oceanic plateau. The general approach was to drill as much igneous rock as possible in the time allowed. The Guyo t Province site (U1578) is at the center of the three seamount chains that define the morphologi c split of the TGW track (Figure F1). This site is hopefully positioned to record differences in geochemical and isotopic characteristics from the seamount sources.  

The plan was to use the rotary core barrel (RCB) system at each site to maximize the time spen t coring igneous rock. This system is designed for coring hard formations, so it often does a poo r job of coring poorly lithified sediments. To obtain minimally disturbed sediments, cores are usually obtained with the advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel (XCB) systems, bu t they require a different bit assembly. Typically, use of the RCB system results in moderate to sever e disturbance of unlithified carbonate oozes. In contrast, it often produces good samples from mor e lithified chalk and limestone.  

Initially, four proposed sites were planned to be single-bit holes (VB-12A, VB-14A, TT-4A, an d GT-4A), meaning that coring proceeds into basement until the bit fails. From past drilling of seamount lavas, it was estimated that this would penetrate ${\sim}80{-}100\ \mathrm{m}$ into igneous rock. Three o f the four sites drilled during Expedition 391 represented single-bit holes. Penetration was less tha n expected at Sites U1576 and U1577 because massive lava flows were encountered and led to slo w penetration rates. Two proposed sites were planned to establish two-bit holes (FR-1B and CT-4A), meaning that the hole will be cored first with one bit and that bit will be replaced when it wear s out. Owing to lack of time, only one two-bit hole, at Site U1578, was drilled.  

Changing the bit for drilling a two-bit hole requires raising and taking apart the drill string, whic h requires ${\sim}8\mathrm{~h~}$ , depending on water depth. After the bit is replaced on the bottom-hole assembl y (BHA), it is lowered to the seafloor by reassembling the drill string, which takes about the sam e amount of time as raising it. Hole reentry is possible with a reentry cone on the seafloor. The con e is located with the aid of sonar and a subsea camera, and the ship’s crew positions the ship abov e the cone so that the drill string can be lowered into the hole. Re-entry was accomplished using  a free-fall funnel as the seafloor cone because this device is usually the most economical in terms o f time. This funnel is assembled around the drill string and then dropped to the seafloor.  

# 4.3. Wireline logging strategy  

The wireline logging plan for Expedition 391 aimed to provide continuous stratigraphic coverag e of in situ formation properties at all proposed sites. Two tool string configurations were planne d for each site. Unfortunately, the logging plan was a casualty of severe time limitations caused b y lost time addressing the COVID-19 outbreak aboard JOIDES Resolution.  

# 5. Site summaries  

# 5.1. Site U1575  

# 5.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1575 (proposed Site FR-1B) is located within a low saddle on the northeastern end of Walvi s Ridge between the higher Frio Ridge (near the continental margin) and Valdivia Bank, a larg e ocean plateau edifice (Figures F1, F12, F13). This site was chosen as the eastern (older) end of th e Expedition 391 transect because it represented an opportunity to sample a part of the ridge tha t cannot be sampled by dredging due to sediment cover (Figure F13). It also represents the hotspo t trail shortly after it passed from the African continental margin to oceanic crust. Trace elemen t and isotopic geochemistry can provide insights into the transition from the plume head to plum e tail stage of hotspots, specifically whether both high- $\mathrm{\cdotTiO_{2}}$ (Gough-type) and low- $\cdot\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ (Dorostype) basalts are present in the plume tail, as has been found in the Etendeka (and Parana) floo d basalts (plume head stage) (Zhou et al., 2020). Furthermore, does the Tristan signature, which i s found in the younger chain (seamount chain going from Walvis Ridge DSDP Site 527 to Tristan d a Cunha Island), appear in the older portion of the ridge, extending the geochemical zonation of th e hotspot track further back in time? The drill cores provided samples that show the eruption age o f the main TGW hotspot track in an area that is often overprinted with late-stage volcanism. Furthermore, Site U1575 provided paleomagnetic samples for a time when the hotspot is predicted t o have been ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ north of its current paleolatitude and when the paleolatitude was rapidly changing. The site also recovered sediments deposited near the Benguela Current in a regime that is transitional from continental margin siliciclastic to open-ocean pelagic carbonate deposition, whic h could reveal past marine environmental conditions.  

# 5.1.2. Operations  

A single hole was cored at Site U1575 (Table T1). Hole U1575A is located at $21^{\circ}51.9659^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $6^{\circ}35.4369^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $3231.3\;\mathrm{m}$ as obtained from the precision depth recorder (PDR). I n Hole U1575A, we used the RCB coring system to advance from the seafloor to a final depth o f  

332.3 mbsf and recovered $185.2\;\mathrm{m}$ $(56\%)$ of sediment and igneous rock. Hole U1575A penetrate d $122.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. Coring was terminated to realize the remaining major objectives o f the expedition. The total time spent on Hole U1575A was $137.0\,\mathrm{h},$ , or 5.7 days.  

# 5.1.3. Principal results  

# 5.1.3.1. Sedimentology  

The sedimentary cover at Site U1575 includes three lithostratigraphic units that consist of a thic k Pleistocene to Late Miocene succession of unconsolidated calcareous nannofossil-foraminifer a ooze (Lithostratigraphic Unit I; 0–194.10 mbsf) and a much shorter Miocene to Upper Cretaceou s succession of poorly lithified nannofossil-foraminifera chalk with clay (Lithostratigraphic Units I I and III) to the bottom of the sedimentary succession above the igneous basement (Unit IV) a t 209.92 mbsf (Figure F14). It was not clear whether the contact between the sedimentary cover an d the uppermost lava in the basement (Igneous Unit 1) was recovered, but sedimentological observations and preliminary shipboard biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data do not suggest th e existence of a significant time gap between the deposition of the lavas and the overlying sedimentary sequence. Consistent with an increase in sediment consolidation downhole, core recover y increases from ${\sim}52\%$ in Lithostratigraphic Unit I to ${\sim}73\%$ in Lithostratigraphic Unit III.  

Unit I consists of a ${\sim}195\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession of white nannofossil-foraminifera ooze with mino r radiolarians that represents Pleistocene to Pliocene pelagic sedimentation. Subtle gray and, mor e rarely, white to green centimeter-sized banding occurs throughout due to accumulations of pyrit e framboids and possibly Fe-Mn-rich particles. The succession becomes pale brown in the lowermost $10\;\mathrm{m}$ of the unit, reflecting a minor increase in the clay content.  

Unit II is a much thinner $\left(<\!10\,\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ late Miocene to early Oligocene succession (194.10–198.5 6 mbsf) consisting of a brown nannofossil-foraminifera chalk with minor radiolarians and clays. Th e chalk is commonly bioturbated and includes subtle white to pale brown color changes controlle d by the relative abundance of calcareous (mostly biogenic) components and clays at the centimete r to subcentimeter scale. Rare microscopic particles of palagonite and volcanic minerals o f unknown provenance were also observed. Concentrated foraminifera bands and parallel to crossbedded laminae in the chalk likely indicate local winnowing and reworking by bottom currents.

Unit III represents a ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Campanian sequence (198.56–209.92 mbsf) of predominantl y consolidated brown to pink nannofossil-foraminifera chalk with rare to minor radiolarians an d clays. Bioturbated chalk intervals are interrupted by winnowed bioclastic sand with parallel t o cross-bedded laminae and more rarely normal to inverse grading. Volcaniclastic deposits are rar e and consist of altered volcanic glass, ferromagnesian and Fe oxide minerals and feldspars. Thes e clasts are mixed with a dominant bioclastic fraction composed of foraminifera and fragments o f inoceramid shells. Rare fragments of red algae were encountered, which suggests deposition of th e sequence at $<\!300$ mbsf and/or sediment reworking from a nearby shoal. These observations support pelagic sedimentation under the influence of bottom currents and, possibly, low-density turbidity currents.  

Few structural features were observed in the sedimentary succession above the igneous basemen t of Unit IV. Several intervals of tilted bedding occur in Units II and III. The apparent dips of th e tilted beds in Unit II are around $11^{\circ}$ , whereas those in Unit III are higher, averaging around $39^{\circ}$ . Two thick intervals $\left({\sim}30\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ of sedimentary dikes formed above the tilted beds in Unit III, wher e sediments are strongly disturbed and mixed with coarse angular grains.  

Sedimentary deposits are also present intercalated with the lava succession in the igneous basement (Unit IV). In the upper part of the basement, the sedimentary deposits consist of white azoi c to nannofossil-bearing micrite that occurs in layered infills of cavities and cracks between an d within the lavas. Farther downhole, below the lower pillow lava package, similar thin intercalation s were deposited during hiatuses in volcanic activity.

# 5.1.3.2. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Hole U1575A penetrated $122.4\mathrm{~m~}$ of basement, recovering $71.6~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous rock $(58.5\%)$ . Thi s basement was divided into 10 igneous units, beginning with a succession of four massive submarine flows (Figure F15). Overall, the eruptive style comprised an alternating sequence of submarine lavas involving massive flows (up to $21\;\mathrm{m}$ thick), individual sheet flows, and stacks of pillo w and lobate lavas (Figure F15). All of these units consist of aphanitic to intersertal to holocrystallin e basalt with phenocrysts and glomerocrysts of plagioclase $(3\%{-}15\%)$ and clinopyroxene $(1\%-5\%)$ . Olivine is sparse and only intermittently present $(0\%{-}3\%)$ and is completely altered in $\mathord{\sim}50\%$ of th e lavas. The igneous units show significant overlap in mineralogy but may be summarized as follows: massive flow Subunits 1a and 1b ( $8.04\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) and 2a and 2b ( $18.08\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) consist of pair s of highly plagioclase-pyroxene $\pm$ olivine phyric, holocrystalline basaltic lava flows separated by  a glassy margin. Subunits $3\mathrm{a}{-}3\mathrm{d}$ present a change of eruptive behavior and consist of $12.87\textrm{m}$ o f intercalated succession of sheet flows, lobate flows, and pillow lavas (i.e., pillow lava stack). Moda l compositions vary from sparsely to highly plagioclase-pyroxene-olivine phyric. Basaltic glass an d altered aphanitic material are found in pillow rims and flow boundaries. Unit 4 is a $10.69\;\mathrm{m}$ thic k massive basalt flow with sparse to moderate plagioclase and pyroxene phenocryst abundance, including sparse olivine. Underlying Unit 5, a thick $\left\langle15.00\mathrm{~m}\right\rangle$ succession of pillow lavas show s numerous glassy margins. Phenocrysts consist of plagioclase and pyroxene with trace amounts o f olivine, and the groundmass ranges from glassy to aphanitic to holocrystalline. Units 6–9 rang e from massive flows (Unit $6=4.01\ \mathrm{m};$ ; Unit $8=21.08\;\mathrm{m}$ ) to thinner underlying pillow lavas (Unit  7 $=4.05\mathrm{~m};$ ; Unit $9\,=\,1.92\mathrm{~m})$ ). Mineralogy varies from sparsely to moderately plagioclase-pyroxen e phyric, lacking olivine. This sequence erupted onto a nannofossil-foraminifera chalk substrate tha t is partially preserved at its base and in pillow lobe interstices as disturbed and deformed material. At the bottom of Hole U1575A, Subunits 10a $\mathrm{^{5.06}\ m})$ and 10b $\mathrm{[}3.31\;\mathrm{m})$ consist of one massiv e flow each, separated by chilled margins. They are moderately phyric and consist of variable proportions of plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine with glomerophyric and holocrystalline textures. Alteration in the igneous basement is due to ambient low-temperature seafloor processes. Oxidative alteration likely occurred shortly after eruption as cooling lava units were subjected to seawater ingress, aided by the development of cooling fractures in the brittle outer flow crust, leadin g to calcite precipitation in fractures. Alteration intensity is slight to occasionally moderate throughout, with centers of thicker flows presenting near-fresh primary minerals (except for olivine). Lowtemperature alteration is also reflected by carbonate vein networks, which vary in thickness an d orientation. These veins are frequently observed in the uppermost $20\,\mathrm{m}$ of the volcanic successio n of Unit IV and decrease in abundance downhole. Throughout the igneous basement, the degree o f overall alteration correlates positively with the abundance of carbonate veins.

# 5.1.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Detailed calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera biostratigraphy was performed o n core catcher samples recovered from Hole U1575A. Microfossil examination provided a preliminary chronostratigraphic framework for sediments at Site U1575. First occurrence (FO) and las t occurrence (LO) datums were largely based on Gradstein et al. (2020).  

The sediment succession at Site U1575 spans the Pleistocene to Upper Cretaceous (upper Campanian) time interval $(0.43{-}78\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . An almost continuous Pleistocene to Pliocene pelagic sediment succession was recorded in Lithostratigraphic Unit I, ranging 0.43–4.50 Ma (possibl y excluding the earliest Pliocene [Zanclean]). Key taxa for this time interval for calcareous nannofossils are Pseudoemiliania lacunosa, Helicosphaera sellii, Discoaster tamalis, and Amaurolithu s primus. Key taxa of planktonic foraminifera for this interval are Globorotalia hessi, Globorotali a crassaformis, and Globorotalia margaritae. Uncertainties in the assignment of the Pliocene/Miocene boundary were noted based on shipboard examination and higher resolution studies will b e required to verify this boundary. The interpretation of the Miocene interval in Lithostratigraphi c Unit II was more complex due to possible hiatuses, poor recovery, and the presence of mixe d assemblages. A tentative biostratigraphic framework places this part of the sequence in the uppe r Miocene, and further postexpedition investigation is required. In Sections 391-U1575A-20R-C C through 21R-CC, Unit II shows a time gap and extends to the lowest Oligocene (Rupelian) a s detected by the occurrence of calcareous nannofossil Reticulofenestra umbilicus in Section 21RCC. Farther downhole, a major unconformity separates early Oligocene and late Campanian flor a and fauna recorded in Lithostratigraphic Units II and III, respectively; the latter is the lowermos t part of the cored sedimentary succession. The maximum age detected is ${\sim}78\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Section 20RCC) based on the occurrence of Eiffellithus eximius and Uniplanarius sissinghii along with th e absence of Uniplanarius trifidus nannofossil taxa. Samples were taken from thin sediment layer s interbedded with lava flows within the igneous basement (Lithostratigraphic Unit IV), but preliminary age determination will require postexpedition analysis.  

# 5.1.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Sediments recovered at Site U1575 are weakly magnetic (ranging $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m})$ in Cores 391- U1575A-1R through 20R (0–194.1 mbsf). As such, both the superconducting rock magnetomete r (SRM) and the JR-6A spinner magnetometer failed to produce reliable directions, and n o magnetostratigraphy could be determined for this interval. Lithified basal sediments from Core s 21R and 22R had stronger magnetizations (ranging $10^{-3}$ to $10^{1}\;\mathrm{A/m})$ . Several intervals within th e basal sediments, however, exhibited pervasive tilting, precluding determination of a robus t magnetostratigraphy for Cores 21R and 22R. Nevertheless, we interpret Sections 22R-4 and 22R- 5 to represent reversed polarity Chron 32r.  

Igneous rocks recovered at Site U1575 are characterized by low unblocking temperatures $(\mathrm{\sim}150^{\circ}-$ $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ ) and median destructive field values ranging ${\sim}5{-}125~\mathrm{mT}$ . These unusually high coercivit y values are likely caused by the presence of dendritic iron oxides (most likely titanomagnetite o r titanomaghemite), which can exhibit strong magnetic anisotropy. These phases were observed i n thin sections of Hole U1575A igneous rocks. Thermal demagnetization of some discrete sample s showed evidence of possible partial self-reversal of magnetization. All samples subjected to alternating field (AF) demagnetization displayed a drill string overprint that was typically removed b y $20\;\mathrm{~mT~}$ before revealing a unidirectional origin-trending component. Magnetic inclination s obtained using principal component analysis from discrete samples agree well with inclination s associated with the $20~\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization step in SRM data acquired from archive-half section at corresponding depths. Nearly all measurements are of normal polarity, consistent wit h basement formation during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron (C34n).  

# 5.1.3.5. Geochemistry  

At Site U1575, interstitial water samples were analyzed for $\mathsf{p H}$ , alkalinity, major cation and anio n concentrations, and trace element concentrations. An alkalinity maximum was identified at 1 5 mbsf. Slightly below this depth, at $25{-}30~\mathrm{mbsf}_{:}$ maxima for Ca, K, Sr, and Si and minima for $\mathrm{Mg}$ and Li concentrations were observed. These features are attributable to diageneses of biogenic carbonates and silica. A Mn reduction interval was found at the shallow depth of 10 mbsf. Because o f the hiatus between Lithostratigraphic Units I and II, no signs of interaction between basaltic basement and Lithostratigraphic Unit I were observed, and profiles of many elemental concentration s remained uniform between 50 and 200 mbsf. Sediment samples were also analyzed to determin e the content of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ total carbon, and total organic carbon. In Lithostratigraphic Unit I (dominantly nannofossil-foraminifera ooze), the $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content ranges $93{-}98\;\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . In Lithostratigraphic Units II and III, the $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content declines to 85 and $74~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively. Methan e concentrations measured from the headspace gas are at the atmospheric background level (lowe r than $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{L})$ .  

For the determination of major and trace element concentrations in recovered volcanic rocks, representative samples obtained from the igneous basement were analyzed using inductively couple d plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and portable $\mathrm{X}$ -ray fluorescence (pXRF) o n both rock powders $\left(\mathbf{n}\right)=33,$ ) and surfaces of archive-half section rock pieces $\left(\mathbf{n}=267\right)$ ). Overall, comparison of the ICP-AES and pXRF results of the same samples displays excellent to good correlation. The loss on ignition (LOI), a common indicator for the degree of alteration, is relativel y low overall for such old submarine rocks $\left(\mathrm{LOI}<3\,\mathrm{wt}\%\right)$ ). Nevertheless, K and Sr enrichment due t o seawater interaction and olivine alteration affect the composition of the analyzed lavas to variabl e degrees, which has also been documented by petrographic investigations. All igneous rock samples are basalts and have $\mathrm{Ti/V}$ values similar to MORBs and ridge-centered ocean island basalts. Downhole geochemical variations display an overall increase in $\mathrm{MgO}_{:}$ , possibly reflecting increasing differentiation of the magma reservoir with decreasing age. The most striking geochemica l variability was observed at ${\sim}274$ mbsf. In the upper portions of the recovered interval, the $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content is relatively constant and sharply drops at 274 mbsf at the bottom of Igneous Unit 5. Thereafter, the $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ value remains constant throughout Units 5–8 and slowly increases from Uni t 9 to Unit 10 again to a concentration similar to the upper part of the volcanic sequence (Units $1-$ 5). This Ti evolution correlates with similar patterns for Sr, Y, and Zr. Another geochemical anomaly was identified around 255 mbsf in the lower part of Subunit 4a, which shows an enrichment o f $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},\mathrm{Ni},$ and Cu. Also, Subunits 10a and 10b may be distinguished by differing Ni content.  

# 5.1.3.6. Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were made on recovered whole-round and section half cores a s well as discrete cube and wedge samples, indicating three distinct units that correspond to th e established lithostratigraphic units: (1) calcareous ooze, (2) chalk, and (3) basalt. Within the sedimentary succession, NGR and magnetic susceptibility (MS) peaks at $\mathord{\sim}194$ mbsf correlate to th e calcareous ooze-chalk contact: mean NGR values increase from 3.3 to 16.0 counts/s and averag e MS increases from 1.0 to 38.1 SI. The transition from the sedimentary overburden to igneou s basement is imaged at ${\sim}210$ mbsf by gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, moisture an d density (MAD) bulk density, and NGR average values. Bulk density increases from 1.73 to 2.5 9 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ (GRA) and from 1.89 to $2.85~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (MAD), and NGR decreases from 8.68 to 3.20 counts/ s across the sediment-basement interface. Intervals of low whole-round core and archive-half section surface point MS values appear to correlate with intervals of highly fragmented basalt, an d higher values $[\mathord{\sim}1000$ to ${\sim}3000$ for both instruments) appear to be associated with intervals o f coherent (length $>20~\mathrm{cm}$ ) basalt core pieces. These trends are consistent with GRA bulk densit y and NGR measurements from the same intervals. However, anomalously high MS and NGR values in a rubbly zone appear to correspond to a shift from high to low $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ concentrations in th e volcanic sequence at ${\sim}270$ mbsf.  

# 5.2. Site U1576  

# 5.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1576 (proposed Site VB-14A) is located on the middle west flank of Valdivia Bank, the broa d oceanic plateau that is part of Walvis Ridge (Figures F1, F16, F17, F18). The site was chosen t o obtain samples from buried igneous basement in a location that can only be sampled by drillin g (Figure F18). Valdivia Bank represents a poorly understood edifice of Walvis Ridge that may hav e formed by interaction with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge or a microplate that formed by a plate boundary reorganization. Radiometric age dating is planned to determine the age of the igneous basement at this site. Along with other drill site sampling of Valdivia Bank, age dating will enable us t o test whether there is a north–south age progression, as predicted by hotspot models, or an east– west age progression, as predicted by spreading ridge-formation models. The petrology and geochemistry of the basement basalt samples should elucidate the petrogenesis and mantle sources o f these magmas, including whether the isotopic zonation observed at the DSDP Leg 74 transect,  a few hundred kilometers to the southwest, continues to Valdivia Bank. Paleomagnetic data fro m sediment and basalt samples will help determine the paleolatitude of the hotspot during the lat e Cretaceous. Sediments recovered at Site U1576 will help constrain the age and evolution of th e plateau and provide insights into the paleoenvironmental trends of the midwater column of th e South Atlantic.  

# 5.2.2. Operations  

Two holes were drilled at Site U1576 (Table T1). Hole U1576A is located at $24^{\circ}35.7520^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $5^{\circ}7.3163^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $3032.3\;\mathrm{m}$ as obtained from the PDR. In Hole U1576A, we used th e RCB coring system to advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 398.1 mbsf, and recovere d $309.3\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m\,\left(78\%\right)}}$ of sediment and igneous rock. After attempts to clear a plug in the outer core barre l and bit at the bottom of the hole failed, it was decided to abandon Hole U1576A and offset th e drilling $400\;\mathrm{m}$ along the site survey seismic line at an orientation of $95^{\circ}$ (Figure F17) to start a ne w hole (U1576B). The total time spent on Hole U1576A was $76.25\ \mathrm{h},$ , or 3.2 days. In Hole U1576B, located at $24^{\circ}35.7711^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $5^{\circ}7.5513^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ at a water depth of $3027.2\,\mathrm{m}$ as obtained from the PDR, we firs t drilled without recovery from the seafloor to 365.0 mbsf. The RCB coring system was the n deployed to advance from 365.0 mbsf to a final depth of 450.3 mbsf with a recovery of $66.3~\mathrm{m}$ $(78\%)$ of sedimentary and igneous rock. Coring was terminated early to complete the remainin g major objectives of the expedition. In total, Holes U1576A and U1576B penetrated $17.9\textrm{m}$ an d $64.9\,\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement, respectively. The total time spent on Hole U1576B was $78.75\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , or 3. 3 days. Overall, we spent $155.0\,\mathrm{h};$ , or 6.5 days, at Site U1576.

# 5.2.3. Principal results  

# 5.2.3.1. Sedimentology  

The sedimentary succession at Site U1576 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units. It consist s of a ${\sim}380\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of ooze and chalk on top of a volcanic basement (Figure F19) and si x intercalations of chalk in the volcanic basement for an additional cumulated sediment thickness o f ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ (Figure F20). Two holes were drilled at Site U1576. Hole U1576A recovered the sedimentary cover from 0 to 380.18 mbsf. Hole U1576B recovered the lower ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ of this sedimentar y cover from 365.00 to 380.18 mbsf and then six sedimentary intervals in the volcanic basement t o 441.36 mbsf (Figure F20). Excellent lithostratigraphic correlation was found in the lower ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}$ o f the sedimentary cover retrieved in the two holes. The sedimentary cover is divided into four mai n lithostratigraphic units of ooze (Lithostratigraphic Unit I) and chalk (Lithostratigraphic Units $\mathrm{II}-$ IV) that were deposited on top of the volcanic basement between the Pleistocene and early Campanian. Drilling disturbance is present throughout the ooze of Unit I but is commonly restricted t o the outermost edges of the cores with uparching of the bedding (i.e., beds form an inverted U). Increased consolidation in the chalk of Units II–IV allowed better preservation of sedimentar y detail with only local biscuiting and minor uparching of the bedding. Core recovery ranges fro m ${\sim}75\%$ in Unit I $(0{-}96.83\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ) to ${\sim}89\%$ in Unit II (96.83–124.71 mbsf) and Unit III (124.71– 322.19 mbsf) and ${\sim}52\%$ in Unit IV (Hole U1576A = 322.19–380.18 mbsf; Hole $\mathrm{U}1576\mathrm{B}=365.00-$ 385.28 mbsf).  

![](images/fe14e825bf4a707a11c08b2d8d73ab467ac71b63b90d2dca5f13accc4fd8e82d.jpg)  
Figure F19. Lithostratigraphic summary, Hole U1576A.  

Unit I is a $96.83\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of unconsolidated nannofossil-foraminifera ooze and nannofossil ooze with foraminifera, locally with clay and minor radiolarians, that records pelagic sedimentation between the Pleistocene and Middle Miocene. Three subunits were defined in Unit  I based on a distinct brownish color correlated with minor changes in clay content. The lowe r boundary of the unit is marked by a sharp contact with brown-pink calcareous ooze/chalk wit h clay in Unit II.  

Unit II represents a ${\sim}28\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of unconsolidated to consolidated pale brown to brow n foraminifera-nannofossil ooze/chalk with clay and minor radiolarians that records pelagic sedimentation during the Paleocene. The base of the unit corresponds to the occurrence of a distinctive ferromanganese crust at the top of Unit III, which likely represents a significant reduction o r pause in ooze accumulation very close to or at the Cretaceous/Paleogene $(\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{Pg})$ boundary. Unit I I is almost exclusively composed of layered, slightly to heavily burrowed foraminifera-nannofossi l ooze/chalk with clay with regular color changes that form approximately $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ thick cycle s with more prominent burrowing in the darker intervals. A minor fraction (volume $=<\!1\%$ ) of th e unit consists of partly disaggregated layers and beds of well-sorted foraminifera to volcanic sand, of which the nature and origin(s) remain poorly constrained due to drilling disturbance. Thes e beds could represent winnowing of the ooze by bottom currents as well as volcaniclastic deposition by turbidites and/or tephra fallout.

Figure F20. Igneous stratigraphic column, Holes U1576A and U1576B. Sed $=$ sedimentology.  

Unit III consists of a $\mathord{\sim}197\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sedimentary succession predominantly composed of welldefined cyclical white and reddish brown or greenish gray foraminifera-nannofossil chalk wit h clay that records pelagic sedimentation between the Maastrichtian and the Campanian. Two subunits (IIIA and IIIB) were defined in Unit III based on progressive attenuation of reddish brow n coloring of the chalk and its replacement by a greenish gray color, which may correspond to  a transition from predominantly oxidative to predominantly reducing conditions on the seafloo r starting at ${\sim}275$ mbsf (approximately middle Campanian). The base of the unit is marked b y almost complete attenuation/replacement of the reddish brown color downhole and the firs t appearance of thin centimeter-sized bands of dark green siliceous chalk in Unit IV. Similar to Uni t II, the chalk of Unit III is interbedded or mingled with sparse volcanic to calcareous sand. Thes e are commonly laminated and normally graded and are considered to represent infrequent botto m and/or turbidity currents. Unit III is also characterized by sparse, thin layers of altered ash that ar e interpreted as distal tephra deposits preserved during periods of low sedimentation and/or bioturbation in the pelagic sediment.  

Unit IV is a ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{m}$ (Hole U1576B; 365.00–385.28 mbsf) to ${\sim}58~\mathrm{m}$ (Hole U1576A; 322.19–380.1 8 mbsf) thick sedimentary sequence that is predominantly composed of light green to darker gra y foraminifera-nannofossil chalk with clay and locally faint nuances of pinkish gray intervals. Simila r to Subunit IIIB, the chalk represents pelagic sedimentation in anoxic conditions during the earl y Campanian, possibly reflecting cyclical sedimentation. Calcareous and volcanic sandy deposit s similar to those observed in Units II and III become slightly more important in Unit IV, formin g $5\%$ of the recovered sediment. The lower boundary of Unit IV corresponds to the inferred (i.e., no t recovered) contact with the underlying igneous succession (Unit V) in Holes U1576A an d U1576B. The correlation of Unit IV between Holes U1576A and U1576B is further established b y the occurrence of a ${\sim}1.61\;\mathrm{m}$ thick matrix-supported calcareous conglomeratic deposit that define s a clear stratigraphic marker $\mathord{\sim}18.2$ and $16.0\;\mathrm{m}$ above the igneous basement in Holes U1576A an d U1576B, respectively. This lithology and other calcareous clastic deposits record a turbidite-ric h interval in Unit IV. Tilted beds observed in Unit IV usually show low apparent dip angles of les s than $10^{\circ}$ . Apparent angles of up to ${\sim}55^{\circ}$ are occasionally present close to the sediment/basemen t contact.  

Seven sedimentary interbeds (S1–S7) of variable thickness $\langle{\sim}0.8{-}11.7\ \mathrm{m}\rangle$ ) recovered as intercalations within the volcanic basement in Hole U1576B are a downhole continuation of the lithologies retrieved in the lower sedimentary cover above the uppermost basalt lava (Unit IV). Sedimentation is similarly dominated by pelagic deposition of gray bioturbated foraminiferanannofossil chalk with clay with thin interbeds of calcareous to volcaniclastic turbidites. Locally, lava-sediment interaction led to formation of peperites and hydrothermal alteration of both basal t and sediment. A submeter interval of metalliferous sedimentation occurs at ${\sim}420$ mbsf betwee n lavas, which similarly suggests nearby synvolcanic hydrothermal activity on the seafloor. Interval s of significant deformation were found in two sediment interbeds. Healed fractures and tilted beddings show various dipping angles. Both normal and reversed faults occur. Deformation structure s include conjugate normal faults as well as en echelon and downward splaying normal faults.  

# 5.2.3.2. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Igneous rocks were recovered from Holes U1576A and U1576B. The igneous basement at Sit e U1576 represents Lithostratigraphic Unit V in the overall subseafloor succession, and the tw o holes are stratigraphically correlated (Figure F20). Hole U1576A penetrated $12.62\textrm{m}$ of igneou s basement, recovering $7.56\:\mathrm{m}$ $(\sim\!60\%)$ , and consists entirely of basalt. Two igneous units are identified in Hole U1576A (Figure F20). The first unit is a sheet flow $\left(1.97\,\textrm{m}\right)$ , and the second uni t consists of pillow basalt, in which the hole terminates at $10.65\;\mathrm{m}$ cored thickness. The lavas rang e from glassy and aphanitic to holocrystalline and intersertal. Fresh glass is present in the pillo w sequence and on the tops of some sheet flows. The lavas are slightly vesicular with small $(\sim\!1\;\mathrm{mm})$ round vesicles and, when phenocrysts are present, are highly phyric (plagioclase $=9\%{-}12\%$ ; clinopyroxene $\,=\,6\%{-8\%}$ ). Hole U1576B penetrated $64.9\mathrm{~m~}$ of igneous basement, recovering $51.48\mathrm{~m~}$ $(\sim\!79\%)$ , consisting of $32.79\mathrm{~m~}$ of basalt and $18.69\mathrm{~m~}$ of intercalated chalk and turbidite horizon s (Figure F20). Hole U1576B terminates within a sheet flow with a minimum thickness of $2.56\;\mathrm{m}$ .  A total of 11 igneous units were identified in Hole U1576B, comprising pillow, sheet, and massiv e lava flows, with cumulative total drilled thicknesses of 18.16, 2.56, and $20.02\;\mathrm{m},$ respectively (Figure F20). The top basaltic unit consists of completely altered pillow basalt lava flows that correlat e to the pillow basalts at the base of Hole U1576A. Igneous Units 1–3 (pillow lava flows) and 4– 5 (massive lava flows) represent aphyric basalts with plagioclase microphenocrysts occurring occasionally. Units 6–11 (one massive flow, one sheet flow, and several pillow basalt flows) are sparsel y plagioclase $\pm$ clinopyroxene phyric $(2\%-4\%$ total phenocrysts). Massive and sheet flows contai n both plagioclase and clinopyroxene glomerocrysts and phenocrysts in an intersertal groundmass, showing higher phenocryst abundances $(8\%)$ in the center of the flows. Pillow lavas contain plagioclase and clinopyroxene microlites and small glomerocrysts in their glassy rims. Olivine occur s infrequently $(<\!1\%)$ and is completely altered. Seriate textures are common in massive lava interiors, whereas clear porphyritic textures are found closer to flow boundaries. Fresh glass is presen t at some flow margins, but it is mostly altered and replaced by clay minerals. The lavas are dominantly nonvesicular to slightly vesicular, except for the pillow lavas of Unit 2, which are moderatel y to highly vesicular with vesicles filled by secondary minerals. Alteration in the basalt lava successions in both holes at Site U1576 is significant and pervasive at the tops and bottoms of lava flow s and throughout the interiors of small flows; only the larger massive flow cores contain near-fres h igneous minerals. Chemically reduced hydrothermal fluids dominate alteration processes, whic h caused a pale green discoloration and formation of secondary pyrite in vesicles and in the groundmass. This alteration is distinctive from the pale reddish tan color associated with the oxidativ e alteration at Site U1575. Alteration-derived veins that crosscut each other are common within th e recovered volcanic sequence, indicating multiple phases of hydrothermal fluid percolation.  

# 5.2.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Detailed calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera biostratigraphy was performed on 3 9 and 16 core catcher samples, respectively, from the continuous sediment successions of Hole s U1576A and U1576B. Five additional core catchers were analyzed for calcareous nannofossil s from the interbedded sediments recovered in Hole U1576B. Core catcher samples were analyze d for FO and LO datums, which were based on Gradstein et al. (2012, 2020). Nannofossil and foraminifera datums showed good agreement throughout the cored sediment sequence. Biostratigraphic analysis revealed a succession of Pleistocene through lower Miocene (Lithostratigraphi c Subunits IA–IC) sediments that is likely incomplete. Additional analysis of these units is require d to determine where and how much time is encompassed within the potential hiatuses. A larg e hiatus/unconformity is observed between the oldest Miocene sediments (Langhian) in Sectio n 391-U1576A-10R-CC and lower Paleocene (Danian) sediments in Section 11R-CC, suggestin g that the Lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary corresponds to a major, ${\sim}45$ My hiatus in the uppe r part of the Hole U1576A sediment succession, with both the Oligocene and Eocene missing fro m retrieved cores. Sediments recovered below the unconformity revealed an apparent continuou s section from the lower Paleocene (Danian) through the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian/Campanian). This succession likely contains the $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary and will be closely analyzed postexpedition to determine its exact placement within the cored sequence. The lower part of th e sediments provided a maximum early Campanian basement age of approximately 79.00–81.3 8 Ma. Interbedded sediments recovered from Hole U1576B revealed only Campanian ages. Thes e interbeds likely represent an older continued succession of the basement interval recovered fro m Hole U1576A, with most samples assigned to lower Campanian biozones.  

# 5.2.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Cores 391-U1576A-1R through 10R are primarily composed of weakly magnetic (ranging $10^{-6}$ t o $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m})$ unconsolidated calcareous nannofossil ooze. As such, both the SRM and JR-6A spinne r magnetometer failed to produce reliable directions, and no magnetostratigraphy could be determined for this interval. Lithified sediments were recovered from Cores 391-U1576A-11R throug h  

39R and Sections 391-U1576B-2R-1 through 5R-3. These lithified sediments have stronger magnetizations (ranging $10^{-5}$ to $100\,\mathrm{\A/m})$ and produced higher quality magnetic measurements, which permitted development of a robust magnetostratigraphy for these intervals. Demagnetizations carried out on discrete samples agree well with section-half measurements and suggest tha t magnetization is carried by a mixture of magnetite and hematite. For Hole U1576A, we identifie d 14 polarity chrons that span from the Danian (Chron 26r in Core 11R) to the early Campania n (Chron 33r near the contact with igneous basement). We assigned polarity chrons for sedimentar y cores from Hole U1576B that were consistent with polarity chrons from Hole U1576A. Section s 391-U1576B-2R-1 through 4R-2 are of normal polarity and are consistent with normal Chron 33n. These are underlain by sedimentary Sections 5R-1 through 5R-3 that make contact to basement, exhibiting reversed polarity consistent with Chron 33r. There were no major gaps identified in th e magnetostratigraphy in the Paleocene and older sediments.  

Igneous rocks recovered from Site U1576 span Cores 391-U1576A-40R through 41R and Core s 391-U1576B-5R through 17R. These cores consist of basalts with interbedded chalk betwee n flows. Some of the basalts are considerably altered, particularly close to contacts with sedimen t interbeds, changing their magnetic characteristics. Magnetic intensities range $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ i n the sediment interbeds and heavily altered basalt, and 1 to $10\,\mathrm{A/m}$ in the mostly unaltered basalti c sections. Nearly all igneous cores display a reversed polarity magnetization after AF cleaning to 2 0 mT, which is compatible with the reversed polarity chron assignment of Chron 33r observed at th e top of the igneous basement. Most of the igneous rocks are characterized by unblocking temperatures between $200^{\circ}$ and $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and median destructive field values around $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ . The large rang e of magnetization unblocking temperatures is most likely related to the presence of titanomagnetite with varying Ti concentrations.  

# 5.2.3.5. Geochemistry  

At Site U1576, IW samples from Hole U1576A were analyzed for $\mathsf{p H}$ , alkalinity, and concentrations of major cations, anions, and trace elements. Both alkalinity and pH peaked in Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIA. Across the entire sedimentary succession, we observe linear increases in I W calcium and lithium concentrations and linear decreases in IW magnesium and potassium concentrations. Two maxima of IW silicon concentration, near the top of the sediment and at th e bottom of the sediment succession, are attributable to dissolution of biogenic silica and volcani c sands, respectively. A broad IW manganese peak, found in Subunit IC through the upper part o f Subunit IIIA, indicates the presence of a manganese reduction interval in the upper part of th e sediment succession. In general, IW geochemistry at Site U1576 is affected by diagenetic processes of calcite, silica, and organic matter, as well as interactions of interstitial waters with volcanic basement and volcanic sands. Sediment samples were also analyzed for $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ total carbon , and total organic carbon contents. $C a C O_{3}$ content remains high across Subunits IA–IIIA an d declines in Subunit IIIB and Unit IV as the content of clay increases. Methane concentration s measured from the headspace gas are lower than the atmospheric background level of $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{L}$ .  

At Site U1576, 2 samples from Hole U1576A and 10 samples from Hole U1575B were analyze d using ICP-AES on powders and pXRF on 103 archive-half section pieces of the recovered cores fo r the determination of major and trace elements. Even though the least altered recovered sections o f the distinct lithologies were analyzed, several samples were affected by varying degrees of alteration, as demonstrated by scattered concentration data of fluid-mobile elements (e.g., K). The analyzed rocks from Hole U1576A are classified solely as basalts, whereas the recovered rocks fro m Hole U1576B range from basalt to basaltic andesite. The Ti-V composition of all samples from Sit e U1576 is similar to MORBs and ridge-centered ocean island basalts. Interestingly, V and $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ ar e well correlated at both Site U1575 and Site U1576, but the trend is shifted, and Site U1576 has  a slightly lower V concentration at a given Ti content. On bivariate diagrams with $\mathrm{MgO}$ versus th e other major oxides and trace elements, the Site U1576 rocks lie generally within the compositiona l array of the previously reported dredge and DSDP site samples from Walvis Ridge of the TristanGough hotspot track. Two igneous units are distinguished in Hole U1576A and 11 are distinguished in Hole U1576B. Based on the lithology and geochemical composition, the second unit o f Hole U1576A and first unit of Hole U1576B appear to be indistinguishable and represent mos t likely the same pillow lava flow stack. Therefore, 12 distinct igneous units are present within th e combined volcanic succession at Site U1576. Geochemical downhole variation using pXRF an d  

ICP-AES analysis shows that all lavas in both holes at Site U1576 have high $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ concentration, unlike Site U1575, which contains lavas with both high and low $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ contents.  

# 5.2.3.6. Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were made on 93 cores from Holes U1576A and U1576B. NGR, MS, GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, porosity, and thermal conductivity measurements reveal  a relatively simple succession of sedimentary and volcanic units in Hole U1576A: calcareous ooz e grading into more cohesive chalk and limestone from the seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}380$ mbsf and relativel y altered basalt flows and pillows to the bottom of the hole at $\mathord{\sim}392$ mbsf. In Hole U1576B, the sam e suite of measurements recorded a more complex sequence of interbedded sediment and basal t units below the initial sediment-basement contact at ${\sim}385$ mbsf to the bottom of the hole at ${\sim}451$ mbsf. Localized features within the sedimentary and volcanic intervals of both holes are als o reflected by physical properties data sets, specifically NGR and MS. In Hole U1576A, the highes t MS $(325\times10^{-5}\mathrm{SI})$ recorded in the sediment interval correlates to a ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick turbidite or altere d tuff at ${\sim}135$ mbsf (Section 15R-1), and at the same depth, NGR abruptly increases to 22.2 counts/ s from a background range of ${\sim}6{-}8.5$ counts/s. Other MS and NGR peaks within the sedimen t interval each correlate to a ${\sim}2\;\mathrm{cm}$ turbidite or altered tuff layer at $\mathord{\sim}98$ mbsf $(\mathrm{MS}=150\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ $\mathrm{NGR}=10.1$ counts/s; Section 11R-3) and ${\sim}123~\mathrm{mbsf}$ $(\mathrm{MS}=145\times10^{-5}$ SI; $\mathrm{NGR}=18.8$ counts/s; Section 13R-6). In Hole U1576A, peaks in NGR, MS, and Section Half Multisensor Logge r (SHMSL) logs align with discrete turbidite or altered tuff layers from ${\sim}95$ to 280 mbsf, and all thre e data sets display a broad cyclical trend over the same interval. In Hole U1576B, MS values ar e uniformly low in the upper chalk layer and interbedded limestones, with an overall mean value o f $15.8\,\pm\,24.8\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI},$ , but NGR counts in interbedded chalk and limestone below the uppermos t sediment-basalt contact increase with depth from 4.31 counts/s at 387 mbsf to 30.2 counts/s at 44 1 mbsf. Basalt layers in Hole U1576B show an increase in MS to an overall mean of $986\pm171\times10^{-5}$ SI. Relatively high NGR and MS values in Hole U1576B may be related to pervasive alteration i n interbedded sedimentary and basalt units. Similar trends in MS and GRA bulk density values a t ${\sim}371$ mbsf $(\mathrm{MS}=8.55\times10^{-5}$ SI; $\mathrm{NGR}=18.5\$ counts/s) in Hole U1576A and at ${\sim}374$ mbsf $\mathrm{MS}=$ $8.84\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ ; $\mathrm{NGR}=18.8\$ counts/s) in Hole U1576B correlate to a turbidite or altered tephra laye r at the same depth in each hole. This correlation suggests that Holes U1576A and U1576B ma y sample a common stratigraphic sequence from the seafloor to ${\sim}451$ mbsf.  

# 5.3. Site U1577  

# 5.3.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1577 (proposed Site VB-13A) is located on the extreme eastern flank of Valdivia Bank as  a complement to Sites U1575 and U1576 on the western and northern sides of the edifice, respectively (Figures F1, F21, F22). The site was selected to recover igneous basement samples from  a buried part of the plateau to understand its geologic and geochemical evolution in a location tha t can only be sampled by drilling (Figure F22). Samples from Site U1577 will help determin e whether the isotopic zonation, observed several hundred kilometers farther southwest in th e TGW hotspot track, is found at Valdivia Bank. Geochronology studies of basalts from Site U1577, along with those from other Valdivia Bank sites, will constrain the temporal evolution of the plateau. Specifically, is there a north–south age progression, as predicted by hotspot models, or is th e progression east–west, as predicted by a spreading ridge formation? Paleomagnetic studies of Sit e U1577 basalts will add to those from other sites to examine the paleolatitude of the hotspot durin g the Late Cretaceous. Studies of the sedimentary overburden will add to those from previous site s to understand the sedimentary and paleoenvironmental history of Valdivia Bank.  

# 5.3.2. Operations  

A single hole was drilled at Site U1577 (Table T1). Hole U1577A is located at $25^{\circ}12.1439^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $7^{\circ}29.8140^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ , at a water depth of $3940.2\:\mathrm{m}$ as obtained from the PDR. In Hole U1577A, we used th e RCB coring system to advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 193.9 mbsf and recovered 152. 9 $\mathrm{m}\left(79\%\right)$ of sediment and igneous rock. In total, Hole U1577A penetrated $39.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. Coring was terminated early to complete the remaining major objectives of the expedition. The total time spent on Hole U1577A was $109.5\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 4.6 days.  

# 5.3.3. Principal results  

# 5.3.3.1. Sedimentology  

The sedimentary deposits at Site U1577 are divided into three lithostratigraphic units that rang e in age from the Paleocene (Thanetian) to Late Cretaceous (latest Santonian). The sediments consist of a ${\sim}155\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession of nannofossil ooze and chalk with variable contents of clay an d volcanic tephra (Figure F23). This sedimentary succession overlies the igneous basement, whic h consists of three massive lava flows (4, 12, and $19\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) devoid of sedimentary intercalation o r infillings (Figure F24). The lithostratigraphic division was defined based on macroscopic an d microscopic lithologic observations supplemented with changes in NGR and biostratigraphi c data. Three units of pelagic sediment with a minor component of tephra layers were define d (Units I–III) (Figure F23). Sediment consolidation increases gradually downhole, with ooze dominant in Unit I, and chalk dominant in Units II and III. Drilling disturbance occurs throughout th e ooze of Unit I where the cores commonly display uparching of the bedding (i.e., beds form a n inverted U). The increased consolidation in the sediment deeper in the hole offers better preservation of sedimentary detail, with disturbance limited to less consolidated intervals where localize d biscuiting and minor uparching of the bedding occur. Consistent with the increase in sedimen t consolidation downhole, core recovery is ${\sim}69\%$ in Unit I $\mathrm{(0{-}46.90\ m b s f)}$ , ${\sim}90\%$ in Unit II (46.90– 70.72 mbsf), and ${\sim}82\%$ in Unit III (70.72–154.80 mbsf).  

Unit I is a $46.90\;\mathrm{m}$ thick Paleocene succession of unconsolidated pale brown to white bioturbate d nannofossil ooze with clay. It is irregularly interbedded with minor, brown, altered volcanic as h layers containing sparse crystals of feldspar, biotite, and amphibole. A marked decrease in cla y content and tephra abundance occurs between ${\sim}11$ and 24 mbsf, producing an interval of distinctively lighter sediment. The more clayey ooze intervals at the top and bottom of the unit displa y light brown to brown $10{-}50\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick cycles, and the lowest 3 to $4\,\mathrm{m}$ have an increasingly pink hu e and show ferromanganese layers disaggregated by drilling. Because tephra changes reflect phase s of increased volcanic input rather than changes in background pelagic sedimentation, they wer e not used for stratigraphic division. Instead, the lower boundary of the unit was based on paleontological data supporting a transition to Upper Cretaceous microfossil assemblages in th e underlying units.  

Unit II is a ${\sim}23.82\mathrm{~m~}$ thick (46.90–70.72 mbsf) Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) succession o f slightly to heavily burrowed pinkish brown to pale brown clayey nannofossil ooze to chalk wit h minor interbeds of brown to gray ash to tuff, both of which are commonly altered. The $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary, which is assumed to form the boundary between Units I and II, was not recovered. Uni t II differs from Unit I in that clay content (i.e., brown color) remains high throughout. In addition, Unit II lacks the black ferromanganese layers seen in the lower part of Unit I, and it records th e first appearance of inoceramid shell fragments downhole. The pelagic sediment of Unit II is characterized by cyclical changes in color at a $10{-}60~\mathrm{cm}$ scale that most likely correspond to fluctuation in the relative abundance of clays and Fe oxides relative to carbonates. At least 20 layers o f typically well-defined, brown to dark brown, graded and/or bioturbated tephra occur throughout. The lower boundary of Unit II is taken as the base of the lowermost graded tephra layer, belo w which both biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data suggest a stratigraphic gap or period o f reduced sedimentation of ${\sim}3$ My.

Contours are plotted at $50\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals and labeled in kilometers. Blue line $=$ Seismic Line TN373-VB05, heavy blue line $=$ portion of the seismic line shown in Figure F22.  

Unit III represents over half $(84.08\;\mathrm{m})$ of the sedimentary cover (70.72–154.80 mbsf). It is a Campanian to possibly latest Santonian succession of bioturbated clayey nannofossil chalk with intermittent, commonly burrowed graded tephra interbeds. Overall, Unit III represents a long duratio n of seafloor pelagic sedimentation interspersed with tephra input of differing types. Changes i n color at a $10{-}60~\mathrm{cm}$ scale, similar to those observed in Unit II, are still locally recognized in Uni t III, but these are more commonly obscured by irregular occurrences of slightly to extensively bioturbated tephra layers. Unit III is further divided into three subunits (IIIA–IIIC) based on colo r variation (pinkish to green) that reflects clear variations in the overall preserved oxidation state i n the chalk and also based on attendant changes in the abundance and type of tephra deposits. Subunit IIIA is a $22\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession (70.72–92.23 mbsf) dominated by pinkish brown chalk wit h minor gray tephra layers typically $<\!5\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick. Subunit IIIB is a ${\sim}41\mathrm{~m~}$ thick succession $_{(92.23-}$ $133.53\mathrm{~mbsf})$ ) dominated by greenish gray chalk with slightly more abundant black tephra layer s $({\sim}5{-}15~\mathrm{cm}$ thick). Finally, Subunit IIIB is a $21\textbf{m}$ thick succession (133.53–154.80 mbsf) dominated by pinkish brown chalk with fewer intervals of gray, brown, and black tephra layers (als o ${\sim}5{-}15~\mathrm{cm}$ thick). Rare ${<}15\ \mathrm{cm}$ thick layers of hyaloclastite appear toward the base of the uni t closer to the contact with underlying volcanic basement. This contact is marked by the top of  a massive lava overlain by a $0.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick layer of altered hyaloclastite and bioturbated clayey nannofossil chalk. As previously observed in the sedimentary cover at Site U1576, Unit III at Site U157 7 preserves a detailed record of changes in paleoenvironment at Valdivia Bank (e.g., either cyclica l patterns and possible anoxic versus oxic seafloor conditions or depositional diagenesis) for th e Campanian and Maastrichtian.

# 5.3.3.2. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Hole U1577A penetrated $39.1~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement, recovering $28.0~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous rocks $(80\%)$ representing Lithostratigraphic Unit IV in the overall subseafloor succession (Figure F24). Hol e U1577A terminates within a massive basalt flow with a minimum thickness of $19.07\textrm{m}$ . Igneou s basement was intersected in Sections 391-U1577A-18R-1 through 26R-1. The volcanic successio n consists of a single unit (Igneous Unit 1) made up of highly phyric basalt that is divided into thre e subunits (i.e., massive lava flows) based on features which identify flow boundaries (Figure F24). All subunits are porphyritic, although the groundmass texture grades to aphanitic adjacent to flo w boundaries. The uppermost subunit contains a glassy rim in contact with the overlying pelagi c sediment. The phenocryst proportion amounts to $\mathord{\sim}18\%$ in the massive flows, with $\mathord{\sim}15\%$ plagioclase, $2\%{-}5\%$ pyroxene, and $0\%{-3\%}$ olivine. The lavas are slightly vesicular and contain roun d vesicles that are $1{-}2\ \mathrm{mm}$ in diameter and filled with at least one secondary mineral (e.g., clay, calcite, and/or zeolite). Groundmass in flow interiors consists of fine- to medium-grained clinopyroxene and plagioclase in subophitic textures, often showing late-stage crystallization after olivine and plagioclase. In flow interiors, the groundmass has a seriate texture and coarse crystal siz e distribution that approaches that of the phenocrysts. Mesostasis (quenched melt) forms irregula r globules that consist of microcrystalline plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti oxides. The flo w margins consist of plagioclase-clinopyroxene-olivine phyric basalt. Plagioclase is still the dominant phenocryst phase in the form of similarly blocky or tabular glomerocrysts (up to $2.4~\mathrm{mm}$ i n size) but with much lower abundance than in flow interiors $(\sim\!5\%)$ . Olivine (altered to saponite ) and clinopyroxene are less common and form small anhedral grains (up to $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$ ). The groundmass in samples from flow margins is markedly distinct from flow interiors: plagioclase, clinopyroxene, and Fe-Ti-oxides are very fine grained, showing intergranular textures. Plagioclas e forms small needle-like skeletal crystals $(<\!0.4\,\mathrm{\mm})$ , whereas clinopyroxene $(<\!0.08\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{\mm}})$ form s small blocky crystals. There is no seriate gradation in size, as seen in the flow interiors. Mesostasi s forms distinct regions with microcrystalline textures. Secondary minerals are relatively scarce, bu t those that do occur are disseminated as limited peripheral alteration or oxidative films aroun d crystals, and these changes impart minor color variations from the unaltered blue-gray flow interiors to a light brown hue. Oxidative changes also occur as discolored halos extending $2{-}4~\mathsf{c m}$ away from calcite- and Fe oxyhydroxide-filled fractures and veins.

# 5.3.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera biostratigraphy was performed on cor e catcher sections from Hole U1577A. Nannofossil analysis included 15 core catcher samples an d two toothpick samples, and foraminifera analysis included seven core catcher samples. Foraminifera sample processing was difficult, limiting the number of samples analyzed in the time availabl e for this hole. Planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossil ages show good agreemen t throughout the hole.  

Notably, Section 391-U1577A-1R-CC recovered sediments that were late Paleocene (Thanetia n stage; ${\sim}58.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). Therefore, the shallowest possible sample (i.e., the mudline) was examined t o determine whether this age also corresponded to the top of the sequence or a thin layer of younge r sediment was present. Investigation of the mudline revealed sediments with a maximum age o f latest Pleistocene, indicating present-day sedimentation is not below the carbonate compensatio n depth. This likely indicates a long persistent erosional surface at this site; thus, a major unconformity exists between sediments younger than ${\sim}0.43\mathrm{~Ma}$ and the latest Paleocene-aged sediment s recovered in Core 1R. Additional samples from this core will be analyzed postexpedition to identify the precise location of this unconformity. A nearly continuous succession of late Paleocen e (Thanetian) to Late Cretaceous (Campanian) sediment was recovered in Sections 1R-CC throug h 17R-CC. An apparent unconformity was discovered between Sections 7R-CC and 8R-CC, spanning the Maastrichtian/Campanian boundary and encompassing a time gap of about $5.6~\mathrm{My}$ between $\mathord{\sim}69.0$ and $74.6\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . This observation is corroborated by NGR data measured on wholeround sections and magnetostratigraphic data. Higher resolution sampling through Core 8R i s required to identify the true range of missing time due to this unconformity.  

The age of the oldest sediment in Hole U1577A is unclear. Foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils do not record Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) marker taxa. However, paleomagnetic dat a indicate that the interval of the Cretaceous Normal Superchron was intersected (possibly in Section 17R-3), which is considered to be the boundary between the Campanian and Santonian stage s of the Upper Cretaceous. In Section 17R-CC, foraminifera and nannofossils agree on an earl y Campanian age from ${\sim}79.00$ to 81.38 Ma. However, the poor preservation of planktonic foraminifera limited the complete evaluation of the assemblage. A toothpick sample was taken from jus t above the sediment-basement contact, but confident Santonian markers were not observed. Las t occurrences of foraminifera markers Dicarinella asymetrica, Dicarinella concavata, and Sigali a deflaensis coincide with the Santonian/Campanian boundary $(83.64\,\mathrm{Ma})$ (Gradstein et al., 2012).  

# 5.3.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Sedimentary Cores 391-U1577A-1R through 18R are mostly made up of partially to fully consolidated clay and chalk. Archive-half sections and discrete samples were analyzed using the SRM an d JR-6A spinner magnetometer, respectively. Sediment natural remanent magnetization (NRM) values range $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Most sediments have median destructive fields ranging $10{-}30~\mathrm{mT}$ . Thermal demagnetization spectra of sediment specimens often revealed slow unblocking of magnetization in the $200^{\circ}{-}400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ range, with a sharper drop in magnetic moment close to $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (th e Curie temperature of magnetite). This demagnetization behavior suggests that the dominant magnetization carriers in sediments from Hole U1577A are likely a mixture of titanomagnetite wit h varying Ti concentrations and magnetite. A total of eight polarity chrons were identified in thes e sections that cover the Thanetian (late Paleocene; Chron C26n in Core 1R) to the early Santonia n (Late Cretaceous; Chron C34n near the contact with basement). There are three major breaks i n the magnetostratigraphy probably due to poor core recovery or unconformities: (1) between Core s 4R and 5R, where sediment ages jump from Chron C26r to Chron $C28\boldsymbol{\mathrm{n}}$ ; (2) between Cores 5R an d 6R, where sediment ages jump from Chron C28n to Chron $C30\mathrm{n}$ ; and (3) in Section 8R-3, wher e sediment ages jump from Chron C31r to Chron C33r. All of these gaps are consistent with th e available biostratigraphic markers for these cores.  

Igneous rocks recovered from Site U1577 span Cores 391-U1577A-18R through 26R. Their NR M values range from slightly below 1 to slightly above $10\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Nearly all igneous cores displayed  a positive polarity magnetization after AF cleaning to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ , which is compatible with the assignment of polarity Chron $C34\mathrm{n}$ (Cretaceous Normal Superchron) observed in the sediments abov e the sediment-basalt contact. Occasionally, basalts from sections with large hydrothermal vein s exhibited reversed polarity, which likely reflects secondary remagnetization due to alteration. Most of the igneous rocks had median destructive field values between 5 and $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ and exhibite d a range of thermal demagnetization behaviors. Some igneous specimens exhibited lower maximum unblocking temperatures around $200^{\circ}C_{\imath}$ , whereas others showed higher unblocking temperatures near the magnetite Curie temperature of $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The remainder of specimen s progressively lost their magnetization between $100^{\circ}$ and $350^{\circ}C$ . This wide range of therma l demagnetization behaviors implies the coexistence of several magnetic phases, including pseudosingle domain to multidomain magnetite and titanomagnetite with a large range of Ti concentrations.  

# 5.3.3.5. Geochemistry  

At Site U1577, IW samples were analyzed for ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , alkalinity, and concentrations of major cations, anions, and trace elements. Both alkalinity and pH show narrow ranges except for low alkalinit y and high pH anomalies observed within Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIIB. Across the entire sedimentary succession, overall nonlinear increases of calcium and decreases in magnesium wer e observed. Two maxima of IW silicon were found at the top and bottom of the sediment succession, similar to Site U1576. A broad IW manganese peak was observed in Lithostratigraphic Subunits IIIB and IIIC, corresponding to a slight decrease of sulfate concentration. Compared t o previous sites, IW ammonium and phosphate concentrations are lower by a ratio of nearly 1:1. I n summary, IW geochemistry at Site U1577 indicates slower diagenesis of calcite, silica, and organi c matter than at the other Valdivia Bank sites (U1575 and U1576). Sediment samples were also analyzed for the $\mathrm{{CaCO}_{3}.}$ total carbon, and total organic carbon content. $C a C O_{3}$ content declines i n Unit III, whereas organic carbon content is relatively consistent in the overall sedimentar y sequence. Methane concentrations measured from the headspace gas are lower than the atmospheric background level of $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{L}$ .  

Three igneous subunits of massive lava flows consisting of highly phyric basalt were recovered a t Site U1577. For the determinations of major and trace elements, seven samples were analyze d using ICP-AES. Additionally, 158 measurements were conducted on archive-half section piece s using pXRF spectrometry. LOI represents an indicator for the degree of alteration, and the analyzed samples show a low LOI of ${<}1.35\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ . Overall, Site U1577 samples are extremely homogeneous, showing limited geochemical variation downhole that is less variable in composition tha n the other Valdivia Bank sites (U1575 and U1576). Based on the low LOI and homogeneous composition, we conclude that the brownish discoloration of some samples reflects minor oxidatio n without significant element addition/subtraction. All samples from Site U1577 are classified a s basalts and have a tholeiitic composition. The Ti-V composition of the basalts is similar to th e other Valdivia Bank sites and is comparable to MORBs and ridge-centered ocean island basalts. On bivariate diagrams of Mg# versus the other major and trace elements, Site U1577 samples for m tight clusters that overlap with previous dredge and DSDP drill site samples from Walvis Ridge. Consistent with the absence of olivine, olivine-free Subunit 1b is slightly lower in MgO, Mg#, Ni, and $_\mathrm{Cr}$ relative to Subunits 1a and 1c.  

# 5.3.3.6. Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were made on whole-round cores, section halves, and discret e samples from 26 cores recovered from Hole U1577A. A suite of measurements, including NGR, MS, bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, porosity, and thermal conductivity record two lithostratigraphi c breaks: (1) a boundary between calcareous ooze/chalk units at ${\sim}70$ mbsf and (2) the sedimentbasalt contact at ${\sim}155$ mbsf. The first lithostratigraphic boundary, between Lithostratigraphi c Unit II and Subunit IIIA, is defined by an abrupt shift from relatively high, wide-ranging NG R values to a narrower and lower range of values ( $\lceil\sim\rvert10$ to $\sim16$ counts/s) at ${\sim}70$ mbsf. At the sam e depth, NGR observations are correlated to paleomagnetic measurements: remanent magnetis m indicates a shift from Chron C31n to Chron C33r and suggests that part of the sedimentary recor d is missing. The sediment-basalt contact is clearly imaged at ${\sim}155$ mbsf as an increase in MS an d bulk density (up to $2709\mathrm{~SI}\times10^{-5}$ and $2.95\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively) and an accompanying decrease i n porosity and NGR counts (as low as $2.73\;\mathrm{vol}\%$ and 4.98 counts/s, respectively). Sediments abov e the basalt contact have comparably lower MS and bulk density (up to $647\,\mathrm{SI}\times10^{-5}$ and $2.12\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively), and higher NGR and porosity (up to 31.3 counts/s and $73.2\,\mathrm{vol}\%$ , respectively). Bul k density, MS, and NGR values indicate a continuous package of relatively unaltered basalt with n o interbedded sediments from ${\sim}155$ mbsf to the bottom of Hole U1577A at 193.4 mbsf. Physica l properties measurements also record lithologic variations within the sediment interval that alig n with observations from previous sites. As in Holes U1576A and U1576B, higher MS values (e.g., $547\;\mathrm{SI}\times10^{-5}$ in Section 391-U1577A-8R-3; $\mathord{\sim}71$ mbsf) are associated with tephra layers within th e sediment interval. Additionally, sediments between ${\sim}80$ and ${\sim}90$ mbsf appear to display cycli c variations in NGR that are similar to cycles observed in Hole U1576A.  

# 5.4. Site U1578  

# 5.4.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1578 (proposed Site CT-5A) is the westernmost drilling location for Expedition 391 (Figure s F1, F25, F26, F27), and it is the youngest, with an expected age either in the latest Cretaceous o r earliest Paleocene (Figure F3). It is the only Expedition 391 site in the morphologically distinc t Guyot Province. With ${>}300\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement cored, it is also the deepest basement penetration site of Expedition 391. The site, situated on the Center track ridge between the Tristan an d Gough hotspot tracks, was chosen because the erupted lavas are either likely to be a mixture o f Tristan- and Gough-type components or constitute a distinct third isotopic signature. A majo r objective for this site is to measure the geochemical composition of samples from a deep downhole section of lava flows. The geochemistry should offer clues to the magma source and evolutio n of the Center track ridge. Although there are already many radiometric dates for Walvis Ridg e seamounts, samples from Site U1578 help fill gaps in prior sampling. The expected age for Sit e U1578 basement is a propitious time for understanding the paleolatitude changes of the TG W hotspot because global paleomagnetic data sets suggest that the paleolatitude for the latest Cretaceous and earliest Paleocene TGW hotspot location was south of its current latitude, implyin g northward motion. In contrast, hotspot drift models imply the opposite sense of motion. Moreover, the sense of motion may be opposite to the Hawaiian hotspot, which would confirm TPW. Although the location of Site U1578 was selected to minimize sediment cover, the sedimentar y sequence is expected to provide insights into paleoceanographic conditions at Walvis Ridg e during the Cenozoic.

# 5.4.2. Operations  

A single hole was drilled at Site U1578 (Table T1). Hole U1578A is located at $32^{\circ}19.6836^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $0^{\circ}38.5876^{\prime}\mathrm{W}$ at a water depth of $3793.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ as obtained from the driller’s tag depth. In Hol e U1578A, we used the RCB coring system to advance from the seafloor to a final depth of 486. 4 mbsf and recovered $239.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $(49\%)$ of sediment and igneous rock. The total advance in Hol e U1578A required the deployment of two RCB coring bits through a bit change and reentry into th e hole. In total, Hole U1578A penetrated $302.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement. The total time spent on Hol e U1578A was $244.0\,\mathrm{h}$ , or 10.2 days.  

# 5.4.3. Principal results  

# 5.4.3.1. Sedimentology  

A $\mathord{\sim}184\;\mathrm{m}$ thick succession of calcareous pelagic sediment interbedded with volcaniclastic layer s lies on top of the volcanic basement (Figure F28). Two main lithostratigraphic units, the secon d further divided into two subunits, were recognized based on macroscopic and microscopic (smea r slide, thin section, and scanning electron microscopy) lithologic observations along with change s in MS, NGR, and biostratigraphic data. These overlie the igneous succession, which consists o f lava stacks intercalated with 10 sediment interbeds.  

Unit I forms the uppermost $27\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sedimentary cover (Figure F28). It consists of Pleistocen e to Pliocene white to pale brown foraminifera-nannofossil ooze with clay. Significant drilling disturbance occurs throughout due to poor consolidation of this pelagic sediment, but almost complete $(99\%)$ recovery was achieved. A mass transport deposit occurs toward the boundary wit h Unit II in Section 391-U1578A-3R-6. The boundary itself is marked by the appearance of tephr a and a gradual clay increase in the calcareous ooze/chalk downhole, which correlates with a n increase in MS and NGR values and the occurrence of Eocene-Paleocene foraminifera and nannofossil assemblages, indicating a significant stratigraphic gap.

Figure F28. Lithostratigraphic summary, Site U1578.  

Unit II is a $\mathord{\sim}157\mathrm{~m}$ thick succession of mostly Paleocene calcareous pelagic sediment with rar e volcaniclastic deposits that becomes progressively more consolidated with depth (Figure F28). Relatively limited $(<\!40\%)$ recovery in this unit probably occurred due to significant heave durin g drilling. Two subunits (IIA and IIB) were defined based on changes in clay content and NGR values. Subunit IIA is early Eocene to Paleocene in age (27.00–135.20 mbsf). It consists of white t o pale pinkish brown nannofossil ooze to chalk with clay and rare radiolarians, siliceous spong e spicules, and small foraminifera. The unit also includes minor (commonly disturbed) interbeds o f light to dark gray tephra with colorless to light brown highly vesicular volcanic glass and pumices. Subunit IIB is Paleocene in age (135.20–184.26 mbsf), and continues to the top of the underlyin g volcanic succession. It consists of light gray to greenish gray clayey-nannofossil chalk with rar e radiolarians, siliceous sponge spicules, and small foraminifera. The chalk lithology is darker an d more clayey than that of Subunit IIA, consistent with a gradual increase in NGR in the lower par t of the sedimentary cover. Subunit IIB also includes minor interbeds of dark greenish gray to blac k vitric sandstone/tuff with normal grading that increase in abundance toward the top of the volcanic basement. Volcanic glass shards in the dark sandstone/tuff are fresh to altered with highl y vesicular to pumiceous textures, but they are distinctively browner than glass shards of Subuni t IIA. The texture of the tephra and sedimentary structures of volcaniclastic beds suggest shallo w marine and possibly subaerial volcanism with synvolcanic deposition during pelagic fallout and/o r syn- to postvolcanic reworking by turbidity and/or bottom currents.  

This sedimentary succession overlies the igneous basement, which consists of 12 igneous units. These units consist of massive flows alternating with thick pillow lava stacks, with rare peperiti c intervals and 10 sedimentary interbeds (Figure F29). These interbeds vary in thickness betwee n approximately $>\!0.5$ and ${>}10\ \mathrm{m}$ and occur down to 416.87 mbsf. They are lithologically similar t o the lowermost sedimentary cover and are composed of clayey nannofossil chalk with volcaniclastic layers. The volcaniclastic deposits typically consist of turbidites with variably altered vitri c clasts. The glass shards are highly vesicular in the uppermost six sedimentary intervals an d become slightly vesicular in the lower part of the hole.  

# 5.4.3.2. Igneous petrology and volcanology  

Hole U1578A penetrated $302.12\,\textrm{m}$ of igneous basement (interval 391-U1578A-20R-1, $46\ \mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{;}}$ through 65R-3, $45\;\mathrm{cm}$ ) with $181.26\;\mathrm{m}\;(59.9\%)$ recovery. The igneous basement at Site U1578 represents Lithostratigraphic Unit III in the overall subseafloor succession (Figure F29). Hol e U1578A terminates in a pillow lava unit with a minimum thickness of $67\;\mathrm{m}$ . Twelve igneous unit s were identified in Hole U1578A (Figure F29). They comprise pillow and lobate lava flows, shee t flows, and massive flows with interbedded sediments. The changing eruptive style, changes i n chemistry, and the pelagic sediment interbeds suggest episodic volcanic activity. The uppermos t $96\;\mathrm{m}$ of the succession consists largely of sheet and massive flows intercalated with volcanic sand s and silts; pillow lava flows are present in thin sequences. The dominant unit below that comprise s $96\;\mathrm{m}$ of continuous pillow basalt, followed by $109\,\mathrm{m}$ of pillow lava with two massive flows and on e $6.3~\mathrm{m}$ thick sediment horizon. Glass rims were preserved on many pillow margins. The massiv e flows can be quite voluminous; one massive basalt unit is at least $14.9~\mathrm{m}$ thick. The lavas rang e from highly phyric $(\sim\!8\%{-}15\%$ plagioclase, $0\%{-}4\%$ olivine, and $1\%{-3\%}$ pyroxene) to sparsel y phyric or aphyric basalts. In highly phyric lavas, plagioclase phenocrysts and glomerocrysts can b e up to $15~\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter; pyroxene and olivine are generally much smaller $(1{-}3\ \mathrm{mm})$ . Thicke r massive units present relatively fresh rock, and pillow units are pervasively altered except for ver y fine-grained pillows, which preserve primary modal compositions in their interior. The vesicula r and fractured nature of pillow lava stacks lends themselves to mineralization in the form of vesicl e infilling and veins in fractures. The nature of this alteration changes downhole through the succession with carbonate and calcite, together with Fe-oxyhydroxide dominating the upper igneou s units and pyrite (marcasite), and associated ${\mathrm{Cu}}$ -bearing coatings and zeolite infillings, becomin g more common downhole. Farther within the volcanic sequence there is distinctive epidote mineralization along fractures and within pillow lava vesicles.  

# 5.4.3.3. Biostratigraphy  

Preliminary calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera biostratigraphy was conducted o n core catcher sections from Hole U1578A. A preliminary chronostratigraphic framework for sediments in this hole was obtained from the stratigraphic distribution of the investigated microfossi l groups, referring to biozonations based on Gradstein et al. (2012, 2020). Calcareous nannofossi l analysis was conducted on 18 core catcher sections and on 10 toothpick samples taken fro m within core sections. Planktonic foraminifera were analyzed in a total of 10 core catcher samples t o provide additional key age controls. Foraminifera sample preparation required the use of hydroge n peroxide $(30\%)$ to disaggregate lithified sediments, which limited the time available for shipboar d analysis. Overall, calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera are in good agreement a t Site U1578.  

Calcareous nannofossils show good preservation and high abundances throughout Hole U1578A. Planktonic foraminifera are well preserved and abundant in the upper part of the stratigraphi c sequence (Sections 1R-CC and 2R-CC; Unit I). Conversely, foraminifera abundances decreas e downhole (Sections 3R-CC through 18R-CC) where an increase in radiolarians was noted. Moreover, planktonic foraminifera show a decrease in test size in the same time interval, which possibl y indicates a response to environmental stress. Sections 1R-CC and 2R-CC record late Pliocen e (Piacenzian) to Pleistocene $(<\!0.43\mathrm{{\Ma})}$ sediments. Toothpick samples for calcareous nannofossi l analysis were taken from Section 2R-5 to investigate a lithologic change that was thought to be a n additional age horizon. The examined samples revealed the presence of Oligocene and Eocen e flora mixed with Gelasian (early Pleistocene) assemblages. The occurrence of older taxa within th e Pleistocene deposits may be indicative of sediment remobilization (e.g., slump/landslide). Th e existence of a major unconformity between early Pliocene (Zanclean) and Paleogene deposits a t ${\sim}27.0$ mbsf was confirmed by both calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera data.  A shift in MS and magnetic remanence values was also observed from the same depth interval, supporting the presence of the unconformity. Sections 3R-CC through 18R-CC recovered a continuous Paleogene stratigraphic sequence. Uncertainties in the placement of the Eocene/Paleocen e boundary derived from the analysis of calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifera assemblages. Planktonic foraminifera data indicate a mix of early Eocene (Ypresian) and late Paleocen e (Thanetian) taxa in Section 3R-CC. Calcareous nannofossils suggest a possible early Eocene ag e for the same sample as the late Paleocene marker Ericsonia robusta $^{\prime}56.78\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is not observe d until Section 5R-CC. The bottommost section (18R-CC), at the sediment-basement contact, i s dated between 61.98 and 62.07 Ma based on calcareous nannofossils. Planktonic foraminifera suggest a possibly older age $\left(62.2{-}63.5\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ , but this date is considered unreliable due to the scarc e abundance of foraminifera specimens in the section.  

![](images/09d16536ce9685f8e521a5c8f5c7ee32fc960d8c75a011ae645e589e431ac9b9.jpg)  
Figure F29. Stratigraphic column for igneous basement, Hole U1578A.  

Interbedded sediments within the basement section were investigated using calcareous nannofossils. Preliminary shipboard analyses indicate a possible age of ${\sim}63.25{-}64.81$ Ma. However, high-resolution postexpedition examination is required to better evaluate the age of the intercalated sediments. Preliminary biostratigraphic data from the chalk units of the uppermost fiv e interbeds indicate a Paleocene (Danian) age of deposition.  

# 5.4.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Sediment Cores 391-U1578A-1R through 19R consist of ooze to chalk with varying clay content. Archive halves and discrete samples were analyzed using the SRM and JR-6A spinner magnetometer, respectively. Sediment NRM values range $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-1}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ . Most sediments have media n destructive fields ranging $30{-}50~\mathrm{mT}$ . Thermal demagnetization spectra of sediment specimen s often revealed slow unblocking of magnetization starting from $200^{\circ}C$ and sometimes persisting t o $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This demagnetization behavior suggests that the dominant magnetization carriers in sediments from Hole U1578A are likely a mixture of titanomagnetite with varying Ti concentrations, magnetite, and hematite. We did not assign polarity chrons to Cores 1R–3R because there wa s high dispersion in magnetic inclination values for those cores. However, we were able to assembl e a magnetostratigraphy spanning six polarity chrons starting with Chron $C24\mathbf{r}$ in Core 4R throug h the top of Chron $C27\mathbf{n}$ in Core 19R, which is located just above the contact with basement.  

Igneous rocks recovered from Site U1578 span Cores 391-U1578A-19R through $65\mathrm{R}$ and primarily consist of basalt. Occasionally, layers of sedimentary rocks or hyaloclastites were observe d between basalt flows. The igneous rocks typically have NRM values ranging $10^{1}$ to $10^{10}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . Afte r AF cleaning to $20\;\mathrm{mT},$ , igneous rocks from Cores 20R–45R dominantly displayed a negative inclination magnetization consistent with them having formed during a normal polarity interval.  A brief reversed polarity chron in Core 23R could possibly represent Chron $C27\mathbf{r}$ $63.5{-}62.5\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , but it could also be attributable to secondary chemical remagnetization or unsuccessful removal o f drill string overprints during partial AF demagnetization. Demagnetization of discrete sample s from Cores 38R–44R had an unusually high failure rate. Cores 46R–65R dominantly display a positive inclination magnetization consistent with formation during a reversed polarity interval. Thi s suggests that at least one geomagnetic reversal is recorded in the eruptive sequence at Site U1578. Most of the igneous rocks have median destructive field values between 5 and $25\;\mathrm{mT}$ and exhibit  a range of thermal demagnetization behaviors, with maximum unblocking temperatures rangin g ${\sim}200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (the Curie temperature of magnetite). This wide range of thermal demagnetization behaviors implies the coexistence of several magnetic phases, such as magnetite and titanomagnetite with a large range of Ti content.  

# 5.4.3.5. Geochemistry  

At Site U1578, IW samples were analyzed for ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , alkalinity, and concentrations of major cations, anions, and trace elements. Both alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ show narrow ranges. IW calcium concentration increases downhole to 30 mbsf and slowly decreases below this depth, whereas IW magnesium concentration shows a decreasing trend throughout the sediment succession. IW silico n concentration increases from ${\sim}200~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at the top of the sediment to ${\sim}700~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at ${\sim}50$ mbsf an d maintains a high concentration of $600{-}800~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ throughout the lower sediment succession. I W lithium concentration decreases downhole to 50 mbsf and remains at the low concentration of ${\sim}21$ $\upmu\mathrm{M}$ below this depth, showing a trend generally opposite to IW silicon. IW manganese concentration shows a narrow peak near the top of the sediment and a broad peak close to the bottom of th e sediment succession. In summary, IW geochemistry at Site U1578 is affected by diagenesis of biogenic carbonates at shallow depths and diageneses of biogenic silica at deep depths. Sedimen t samples were also analyzed for the $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ , total carbon, and total organic carbon contents. $C a C O_{3}$ content declines in Unit II, and organic carbon content is consistently low in the sediments. Methane concentrations measured from the headspace gas are lower than the atmospheric backgroun d level of $2.0\,\upmu\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{L}$ .  

Site U1578 recovered 12 igneous lithologic units of aphyric and phyric basalt lava flows. For th e determination of major and trace elements, 16 samples from the first eight units were analyze d using ICP-AES. Additionally, 343 measurements were conducted on archive-half section piece s along the entire igneous section using pXRF. LOI represents an indicator for the degree of alteration, and the analyzed samples show LOI with $<\!3\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ , which is relatively fresh, given that the y represent old submarine rocks. An overall increase in the scatter of $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ data might be due t o limited mobility for potassium during seawater alteration, but there are no other indications fo r element variability due to alteration. All samples from Site U1578 are classified as basalts, excep t one hawaiite sample, and have an alkalic composition. In contrast to the previously drilled Expedition 391 sites, the Ti-V compositions of the basalts from Site U1578 are comparable to the ocea n island basalt array and similar to other alkaline intraplate lavas previously reported from th e Tristan-Gough hotspot track. Based on the $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content, the samples are divided into high-T i with $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ of $3.4–3.9\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ and very high–Ti rocks with $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}>\!3.9\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . In bivariate diagrams, th e major and trace element trends of the high-Ti rocks are generally consistent with olivine, Cr-spinel, and pyroxene fractionation. The very high–Ti rocks are offset relative to the high-Ti rocks t o overall higher $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ , MnO, Sc, V, Co, Zn, and Y values, but they have lower $\mathrm{SiO}_{2},\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3},$ an d $\mathrm{K_{2}O}$ contents for a given $\mathrm{Mg}^{\#}$ . Site U1578 represents the longest basement interval drilled durin g Expedition 391, and significant downhole geochemical variations are observed. The $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content, for example, is relatively low $(2.5{-}3.3\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) in the upper part of the recovered igneous succession. In Unit 8, the rocks are characterized by very high $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ values $(4.0{-}4.5\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ which decrease t o values averaging $3.6~\mathrm{wt\%}$ in Unit 9 and then gradually decreases downhole to Units 11 and 12, where $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ is comparable to the upper part of the basement succession.  

# 5.4.3.6. Physical properties  

Three general lithostratigraphic intervals are identified in Hole U1578A based on physical properties measurements, including NGR, MS/point magnetic susceptibility (MSP), bulk density, thermal conductivity, $P$ -wave velocity, and porosity. The first interval, consisting of calcareous ooz e and chalk, may be further divided into upper and lower units based upon NGR, GRA, and MA D bulk density, and MS/MSP values. At ${\sim}30$ mbsf, a pronounced increase in MS/MSP (up to $79.3~\times$ $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ from background of $\sim\!2.68\times10^{-5}$ to ${\sim}7.23\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI})$ ) and NGR (up to ${\sim}19.5$ counts/s from  a background range of ${\sim}2.25$ to ${\sim}4.14$ counts/s) and a decrease in GRA/MAD bulk density (fro m ${\sim}1.87$ to ${\sim}1.74~\mathrm{g/cm^{2}}$ across the unit contact) define the boundary between Lithostratigraphi c Unit I and Subunit IIA. Below ${\sim}184~\mathrm{mbsf},$ calcareous sediment-basalt contact, basalt units, an d volcaniclastic interbeds are distinguished by porosity $_{\sim34.1}$ and ${\sim}58.3\ \mathrm{vol\%}$ in volcaniclasti c interbeds vs. ${\sim}6.29\$ and ${\sim}15.6\ \mathrm{vol\%}$ in basalts) and thermal conductivity (1.05 to $1.33\;\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K}]$ i n volcanic clastic interbeds vs. 1.66 to $1.77\,\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K}]$ in basalts). Increases in MS/MSP, $P$ -wave velocity, and GRA/MAD bulk density also accompany the shift from volcaniclastic interbeds to basal t units. Physical properties measurements also appear to image mineralogical and compositiona l trends within basalt units. Olivine-phyric lava flows correlate to higher $(>\!3000\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI})$ ) MS/MS P at ${\sim}218$ and ${\sim}253$ mbsf, and an anomalously high NGR count at ${\sim}270$ mbsf appears to correlate t o a high-potassium aphyric basalt at the same depth.  

# 6. Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 391 results must be evaluated while considering that a significant part of the cruise wa s lost. The lost time amounted to a one-third reduction in cruise length. After consultation with th e science party, it was decided to attempt an abbreviated plan with four sites rather than the origina l six. The original six-site plan included three around Valdivia Bank on Walvis Ridge and three i n the Guyot Province. Although all three Valdivia Bank sites (U1575–U1577) were cored, only abou t half of the proposed basement penetration was achieved. The fourth site was on a Center trac k guyot, and it was cored with two bits as planned. The other two guyot sites had to be dropped. Th e Valdivia Bank sites addressed questions about the age progression, tectonic complications, an d geochemical characterization of this large volcanic edifice. We planned to test whether the ag e progression is southwest–northeast, as predicted by hotspot models, east–west, as implied by tectonic models, or more likely a combination of both (east–west along portions of Walvis Ridge suc h as Valdivia Bank but overall southwest–northeast). We also examined the geochemistry to understand the evolution of the hotspot through time and to see whether the geochemical zonation, documented at DSDP Sites 525A, 527, and 528, continues further to the north along Walvis Ridge. In addition, geochemical data will enable us to evaluate whether there are two or three distinc t geochemical zones in the Guyot Province. All three sites on the Walvis Ridge were necessary t o give a broader picture of the development of the Valdivia Bank edifice, which would have bee n impossible with fewer drilling locations. Only one site was drilled in the Guyot Province because i t was considered better to core one deep site instead of one or two shallow basement penetratio n sites. The Center track guyot was chosen because it is in the middle of the three guyot tracks an d potentially shows mixing between guyot source end-members or a distinct (third) plume zone.  

The point of going to these four sites was to address as much of the initial science objectives a s possible. Our reason for going to the three Walvis Ridge sites was that these areas could only b e sampled by drilling due to lack of surface outcrops (i.e., the basement is covered by sediments). W e could have drilled the three Walvis Ridge sites to the planned depth, but then we would not hav e been able to drill any of the Guyot Province sites. Excluding the Guyot Province completely woul d have amounted to giving up on a number of science goals. The along-ridge transect would hav e been cut severely, limiting observations about geochemistry and geochronology to a small are a with less likelihood of a broad understanding of the evolution of the entire hotspot track. Such  a restriction would have also meant dropping the science goals of a significant part of the scienc e party. We chose instead to save the broad view by going to the central guyot site, which was als o the most southwesterly site.  

This four-site plan was ambitious, given the time constraints. It meant that the amount of transi t time would nearly be the same as the six-site plan. As a result, almost every operational decisio n was about time constraints. Logging was dropped entirely to make time for coring. Proposed Sit e FR-1B (U1575) was only drilled with one bit to save time and allow the other sites on Walvis Ridg e to be drilled. Two sites were moved to alternate site locations (proposed Site VB-13A [U1577] wa s substituted for proposed Site VB-12A, and proposed Site CT-5A [U1578] was substituted for proposed Site CT-4A) to drill at shallower water depths at Site U1578 and to reduce the amount o f time spent coring sediment at both sites. Site U1576 was terminated early due to technical issue s and to assure enough time for the remaining two sites. The bit became plugged in Hole U1576A, requiring an unplanned drill string round trip and extra coring in a new hole to get back to basement. Site U1577 was terminated after shallower than planned penetration because the litholog y was massive flows (that cored slowly at ${<}1\ \mathrm{m/h})$ and because weather (heave) did not allow continuing drilling, so coring time could be saved by pulling up the drill string and transiting to th e final site, where the swell was expected to be lower upon arrival.  

When the planned and actual operations are compared (Figure F30), the impact of the expeditio n shortening means a significant reduction in science. The initial plan was about $75\%$ of our expedition time gathering samples and downhole data ( ${\sim}65\%$ coring and $\mathord{\sim}10\%$ logging). Transit time wa s only ${\sim}17\%$ . In the revised plan, logging disappeared entirely. Transit time increased to $30\%$ , mainl y because of the transit back from the first site and then back out to the study area, made necessar y by COVID-19 mitigation. To achieve the maximum progress toward our original goals, the tw o most extreme sites were kept, and thus little transit time was eliminated. Standby time at the doc k in Cape Town consumed $26\%$ , including both the port call and COVID-19 mitigation period. Wit h operations taking up the same amount of time, coring operations (including tripping drill pipe ) were reduced to ${\sim}43\%$ . The actual time available for coring and to recover cores amounted t o ${\sim}35\%$ , decreasing by more than one-fifth compared to the planned schedule $(57\%)$ . The initial pla n called for coring $1506\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and $900\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt. Actual operations managed $949.6~\mathrm{m}$ o f sediment and $546.4~\mathrm{m}$ of basalt, or $63.1\%$ and $60.7\%$ of planned penetrations, respectively.  

Despite this seemingly dire turn of events, Expedition 391 was remarkably successful. After th e initial delay, the expedition spent 39 days at sea, successfully coring and addressing scientifi c objectives. Although severe reductions were necessary, Expedition 391 gathered cores at four site s with the promise of achieving many (but not all) of the objectives. Furthermore, the truncated pla n was a necessary first step for resuming IODP science. Had the expedition been canceled, it coul d have created a domino effect, triggering cancellation or postponement of other IODP expedition s and scientific cruises in general.  

# 6.1. Scientific objectives  

We expect that the samples collected during Expedition 391 will allow progress on most of th e scientific objectives outlined in the scientific prospectus (Sager et al., 2020). Much of the researc h being done in association with the expedition will take time to come to fruition, so it is unclear a s of this writing how impactful the results will be.  

# 6.1.1. What is the basement age progression?  

The age progression of Walvis Ridge and the TGW hotspot track is tightly constrained fro m dredge samples (Homrighausen et al., 2019, 2020), but Expedition 391 had the opportunity t o address several issues that remain unclear. The Valdivia Bank is thought to have formed b y hotspot-ridge interaction within a short period of time when the hotspot was located at the MidAtlantic Ridge (O’Connor and Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a, 2015b). Moreover, th e edifice may have formed at the edge of a microplate, which led to simultaneous volcanism over  a large area (Thoram et al., 2019; Sager et al., 2021). This differs from the traditional hotspot mode l with a linear age progression along the ridge, which suggests a significant age difference betwee n the northern and southern ends of Valdivia Bank. Expedition 391 recovered many fresh basal t samples from three sites on Valdivia Bank (U1575–U1577), which should allow precise radiometric ages to be determined. Preliminary results from first descriptions of core material are quit e interesting. The magnetic anomaly map of Thoram (2021) predicts that Site U1576 is in th e reversed magnetic polarity zone of Chron C33r, whereas Site U1577 is located in the norma l polarity zone of the Cretaceous Long Normal Superchron (Chron C34n). Drilling results bear thi s out, with basement at U1576 having reversed polarity and basement at Site U1577 having norma l polarity. Indeed, at the latter site, the reversed Chron C33r is found in sediments just above basement. These findings suggest that the magnetic anomaly interpretation is correct and that there i s a slight younging of basement from east to west. In addition, Site U1575 basement is also of normal polarity from the Cretaceous Long Normal Superchron, but microfossil dating indicates tha t the sediments resting on basement are Campanian in age, similar to Sites U1576 and U1577, located farther south. This is strikingly different from the expected age of ${\sim}105\ \mathrm{Ma}$ based on th e age progression. It may be that there is simply a hiatus of ${\sim}20$ My at the basement interface, but i f geochronology studies confirmed the younger age, it would indicate widespread simultaneous volcanism, as suggested by ridge-plume interaction and microplate models.

Geochronology studies of Expedition 391 samples will give scientists the opportunity to se e beyond the simple age progression. Most existing ages are from dredges, which often provide  a single age for a seamount. By drilling a succession of lavas from different depths, we can see th e age range of specific sites along the hotspot track, illuminating edifice evolution processes. Because the holes drilled on Valdivia Bank do not provide deep samples, it is unlikely that ther e will be significant temporal variations in these holes. Of the three holes on that edifice, Site U157 5 has the best prospects for addressing this issue because it penetrated deepest into igneous basement $({\sim}122.4\;\mathrm{m})$ . In contrast, Hole U1578A, which penetrated $302.1\;\mathrm{m}$ into basement of the central Guyot Province, has a greater potential in this regard. The section contains 10 sedimen t interbeds, indicating significant time passage. Paleomagnetic results indicate that a magneti c reversal was captured in the lavas, also pointing to significant time passage. Results from the biostratigraphy of interbedded sediments and paleomagnetism suggest a 2 to 3 My history of th e basement section. Combined with significant downhole changes in lava types and major and trac e element composition (pXRF and ICP-AES) measured on board, the biostratigraphic ages indicat e that samples from this site have the potential to provide a picture of the temporal evolution of  a TGW hotspot volcano and its magma supply.  

# 6.1.2. Is Valdivia Bank the product of plume-ridge interaction?  

Hotspots frequently interact with mid-ocean ridges over extended periods (e.g., Whittaker et al., 2015), but the mechanisms are not well understood. This question is important not only fo r understanding the source of hotspot magmas but also for the understanding of hotspot geodynamics and hotspot tracks as markers of absolute plate motion. The TGW hotspot is believed t o have interacted with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge during formation of the Walvis Ridge (O’Connor an d Duncan, 1990; O’Connor and Jokat, 2015a; Whittaker et al., 2015). Valdivia Bank, which form s part of the Walvis Ridge, is an ocean plateau apparently formed at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Sample s from sites drilled on Valdivia Bank will provide geochemical and isotopic data that can be used t o understand the interaction of plume and spreading ridge. Preliminary data, for example, lowe r incompatible element abundances than for magmas in the Guyot Province (regardless of $\mathrm{MgO}$ o r $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ content), indicate that Valdivia Bank lavas are more like MORB than other places on th e TGW hotspot track, implying larger degrees of melting and a contribution from depleted uppe r mantle. All Walvis Ridge sites, in particular Sites U1576 and U1577, will be examined to see if th e hotspot zonation continues north of the DSDP Leg 74 transect (Sites 525A, 527, and 528). Thu s far, only Gough-type isotopic compositions, with one exception, have been found on Walvis Ridge.  

# 6.1.3. Geochemical zonation: are there three distinct geographical, geochemical domains present in the Guyot Province?  

Two distinct geochemical domains have been identified at the younger end of the TGW hotspo t track: a Tristan-type composition of the subtrack going from the western part of Walvis Ridge t o Tristan da Cunha Island and a Gough-type composition of the subtrack going from the easter n part of Walvis Ridge to Gough Island (Rohde et al., 2013a). Preliminary data suggest that a distinc t third geochemical domain may be present between the two tracks. Samples from the drilled Center track guyot (Hole U1578A) will allow us to test whether the central track represents mixin g between the Tristan and Gough tracks or a distinct geochemical composition within the TG W plume.  

# 6.1.4. Plume head to plume tail transition: were low-Ti basalts, similar to those found in the Etendeka volcanism, also involved in the formation of the northeastern Walvis Ridge?  

Both high-Ti (with Gough-type isotopic composition, characterized by MORB-like $\mathrm{^{206}P b/^{204}P b}$ bu t elevated $\mathrm{^{207}P b/^{204}P b}$ and $\mathrm{^{208}P b/^{204}P b)}$ and low-Ti basalts (with MORB-like $\mathrm{^{206}P b/^{204}b}$ and $\mathrm{^{208}P b/^{204}P b}$ but elevated [Gough-like] $\mathrm{^{207}P b/^{204}P b}$ isotopes) have been found in the Etendeka flood basalts i n northwest Namibia. Was the low-Ti component restricted to the plume head? Alternatively, is i t also found in the plume tail (hotspot track) volcanism? Low-Ti-type lavas are present on Mozambique Ridge in the Indian Ocean (Jacques et al., 2019) but not on Walvis Ridge thus far. Preliminary data from Site U1575 indicate the presence of low-Ti basalts for the first time.  

# 6.1.5. What is the paleolatitude motion of the Walvis Ridge hotspot?  

Paleolatitude data from Pacific hotspots have been tremendously influential in studies of hotspo t geodynamics. They suggest that the Hawaiian hotspot moved southward ${\sim}15^{\circ}$ during the formation of the Emperor chain (Tarduno et al., 2003). Drilling of the Louisville hotspot track indicate s far less motion during the same period (Koppers et al., 2012). These results have been interprete d as the result of the Hawaiian plume having moved rapidly southward. Other phenomena can lea d to apparent plume paleolatitude changes, such as TPW, which is the motion of the spin axis relative to the mantle caused by shifting of mass anomalies (e.g., Gordon, 1987). TGW hotspot paleolatitude motion is important because it is nearly antipolar to the Pacific hotspots, so TPW woul d give the opposite shift to that recorded in the Pacific. However, there are few paleomagnetic dat a for the TGW hotspot track, so one objective of Expedition 391 is to provide such data.  

Expedition 391 was planned to core in three general locations for paleolatitudes from basalt cores, which are often considered to be the most reliable paleomagnetic recorders. The northernmos t proposed site (FR-1B) was planned for two-bit penetration (estimated ${\sim}250\ \mathrm{m})$ ) at a location wit h an age of ${\sim}105\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The two proposed southern Valdivia Bank sites (VB-12A and VB-14A) wer e planned to sample ages of ${\sim}80{-}85\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (two holes each ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into basement). The propose d Guyot Province sites (CT-4A, TT-4A, and GT-4A) were planned to sample seamounts ${\sim}60{-}70\,\mathrm{Ma}$ in age. Proposed Site CT-4A site would be a two-bit hole ( ${\sim}250\ \mathrm{m}$ of basement), and Sites TT-4 A and GT-4A would represent one-bit holes ( ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ of basement in each). Unfortunately, basemen t penetration was severely truncated. This poses a problem because paleomagnetic studies of lav a flows must span enough time to average the inclination over a long period of time so that paleosecular variation is averaged. It is difficult to tell how much time is spanned until the samples ar e studied, but basically, the longer the basement section, the better the averaging and the smaller th e uncertainty estimates.  

The best chance for a good paleolatitude is the ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{m}$ basement section from Hole U1578A. Several aspects of the core samples imply that the section encompasses a large time interval: sedimen t interbeds, geochemical trends, and paleomagnetic inclination variations. This site was chosen fo r its geodynamic significance. Prior studies suggest that the TGW hotspot was ${\sim}5^{\circ}$ south of its current location at ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and northward Cenozoic movement of the hotspot is not expected fro m hotspot models. This may be the TPW signal.  

The prospects for the other three sites are not as good. Neither Site U1576 nor U1577 sampled  a long basement section. Data from these holes will be combined, but even so, it is unlikely tha t paleosecular variation will be well averaged. If Site U1575 basement turns out to be closer to ${\sim}85$ Ma than expected, those results can be combined with those from Sites U1576 and U1577. Thus, it may be possible to derive a precise paleolatitude for Valdivia Bank, but this is uncertain.  

# 6.1.6. Does Valdivia Bank contain a continental fragment?  

This question is based on early speculation about the source of Valdivia Bank. It is widely accepte d that Valdivia Bank formed from hotspot volcanism at a spreading ridge (O’Connor and Duncan, 1990). The answer to this question boils down to whether or not we find any continental signatur e in the cored lavas. Evidence of continental material has been found in other oceanic plateaus (Kerguelen Plateau: Frey et al., 2002; Ingle et al., 2002; Mauritius: Torsvik et al., 2013; Iceland: Torsvi k et al., 2015), so it is a possibility. None of the cores showed continental rocks in the basement o r xenoliths of it in the lavas, so that type of finding did not happen. Other studies have interprete d continental components from isotopic compositions and modeling (Torsvik et al., 2015) or fro m finding ancient zircons embedded in the rocks (Torsvik et al., 2013). Samples amenable to bot h types of study were cored from Valdivia Bank, but they will take time to analyze. Prior to the expedition, it was considered unlikely that this question would be answered.  

# 6.2. Other scientific results and surprises  

Although not a priority for Expedition 391 research, it was nonetheless recognized that sediment s recovered from the Walvis Ridge sites can provide important records of paleoceanographic conditions and changes. The sedimentary section in Hole U1576A yielded a thick succession of Paleocene and Late Cretaceous sediments. Moreover, these sediments display color cycles that sugges t astronomically forced climate changes and broad changes in ocean chemistry (e.g., shifting fro m oxic to anoxic conditions). This section is fodder for paleoceanographic studies, and because i t implies that Valdivia Bank has thick sections of easily cored Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoi c sediment, it may well inspire future drilling proposals.  

Sediment sections at several holes displayed lengthy hiatuses. The succession at Site U1575 has  a hiatus of ${\sim}40$ My between the Oligocene and Upper Cretaceous (Campanian). At Site U1576, there is a hiatus of ${\sim}50$ My between mid- to late Miocene and early Paleocene. At Site U1577,  a hiatus of ${\sim}60$ My occurs at the seafloor where the top of the sediment column has a Paleocene age. At Site U1578, there is a hiatus of ${\sim}50$ My between the Pliocene, early Eocene, and Paleocene. Th e reason for the ubiquity of these long Cenozoic hiatuses is unknown, but it suggests changes i n oceanographic conditions and/or late-stage tectonic processes, such as uplift resulting in lack o f deposition and/or erosion.  

Although the goal for paleomagnetic studies was mainly to determine paleolatitude, such measurements discovered a magnetic reversal in the basement section of Hole U1578A. The magneti c polarity of the upper ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ of basement is normal, whereas the lower ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ is of reverse d polarity. Using the magnetostratigraphic progression from the sediment column and biostratigraphic ages from intercalated sediment in the basement section, Expedition 391 paleomagnetist s interpret the basement reversal as the switch from Chron C28r to Chron $C28\boldsymbol{\mathrm{n}}$ . If precise radiometric ages can be derived from the basement lavas bracketing this reversal, the combination o f magnetostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and geochronologic data may provide precise constrain t on the age of a magnetic reversal. Such a result could be used for calibration of the geomagneti c polarity timescale.  

Two very important results from the expedition were the recovery of fresh olivine in a number o f samples, which can be used for rare gas studies, and the recovery of fresh glass. Thus far, the onl y known fresh olivine samples with sufficient abundances for rare gas isotope analyses from th e Tristan-Gough hotspot track come from the subaerial volcanism on Tristan da Cunha and Goug h Islands.  

In contrast to most whole rocks that contain phenocrysts and are altered to some degree (especially submarine samples), fresh glass represents a magmatic liquid composition and preserves th e entire original major and trace element composition of the magmas. To date, there have been n o reliable mobile major and trace element compositions for many of the magma types from th e hotspot tracks (except for the DSDP Leg 74 sites and island samples). A large number $(\mathord{\sim}150)$ o f fresh glass samples were recovered as pillow rinds or the margins of sheet and massive flows. Thi s will without a doubt provide exciting new insights into the geochemistry, as well as geochemica l evolution, of the hotspot track and individual volcanic structures along the track.  

Two geochemical surprises were related to $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content, which could be measured well usin g pXRF. First, low-Ti basalts, previously only found in the Etendeka and Parana flood basalts but no t in hotspot track lavas, were discovered at the most northwestern site (U1575). Second, basalti c andesites were found for the first time in the TGW hotspot track, and these contained unusuall y high $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ contents, generally only found in silica-undersaturated (alkalic) lavas. We expect man y additional new surprises once more detailed geochemical studies can be conducted on the excellent recovered samples.  

# 7. Outreach  

IODP Expedition 391 had one onboard Outreach Officer: a high school teacher from New Yor k City (USA). The officer communicated the objectives and science of the expedition to student s and the general public around the globe through live ship-to-shore broadcasts, social media, videos, blogs, and university news outlets. The officer also developed curriculum and educationa l materials for students in middle and high school.  

# 7.1. Live broadcasts  

The Outreach Officer hosted live ship-to-shore video broadcasts to interact with formal and informal groups all over the world. These events introduced students and members of the general public to the goals, methods, and scientific findings of Expedition 391. Audience sizes ranged fro m tens to hundreds of students, as well as conference attendees and members of public interes t groups.  

The typical broadcast began with an introduction to IODP, JOIDES Resolution, and Expeditio n 391. The scientific context and objectives of the expedition were translated into languages appropriate for each specific audience. Participants then received a tour of the ship that included th e lifeboats, bridge, derrick, rig floor, core-receiving platform, and laboratories. Viewers learne d about the core flow process from scientists in each laboratory, as well as how physical properties, core description, paleomagnetism, biostratigraphy, and geochemistry analyses contribute to th e research and goals of the expedition. Tours ended with extensive question and answer session s with scientists and technicians.  

Over the course of the expedition, the Outreach Officer facilitated 52 broadcast events to 45 institutions (Table T2), including primary and secondary schools, universities, conferences, and informal public groups. Overall, 4 IODP technicians and 15 members of the science party assisted wit h the broadcasts, including the Expedition Project Manager and one Co-Chief Scientist. Studen t audiences ranged from pre-K to graduate university students. Broadcasts were given in five different languages and reached more than 2365 people in 13 nations (Table T2). Demand for broadcasts was very high, with two to four taking place on most weekdays (other than the holiday brea k on shore from 24 December to 1 January), as well as the occasional weekend event. Several broadcasts were recorded by teachers for future use.

Participants were provided with educational materials and useful links from https://joidesresolution.org as well as custom-made Expedition 391 resources prior to their scheduled event. The y were also asked to complete a follow-up survey after the broadcast.  

# 7.2. Expedition activities  

Prior to the expedition, the Outreach Officer opened several lines of communication with institutions in Namibia, the observing country. These conversations included the Geological Survey o f Namibia, the Ministry of Energy and Mines, the University of Namibia, the Museums Associatio n of Namibia, and several schools, resulting in scheduled broadcast events in addition to the creation of a video that was shared as part of the programming for Namibia’s Science Week (“JOIDE S Resolution: mental health and self care”).  

While at sea, the priority for the Outreach Officer was to learn more about the science of Expedition 391, as well as the people involved in the expedition. This approach facilitated not only th e implementation of broadcasts and social media activities but also the drafting of representativ e educational materials at the end of the expedition. This included shadowing scientists, technicians, and crew members; conducting interviews; participating in scientific meetings and discussions; and documenting science and daily life with photographs and videos.  

A total of 13 blog posts were written for the JOIDES Resolution web page: 10 by the Outreac h Officer and three by two scientists. These posts covered topics including the scientific objective s and methods of the expedition, life at sea, and how the expedition was affected by the COVID-1 9 pandemic. Two contests were also hosted through the JOIDES Resolution web page: a researc h vessel design project, which received 15 submissions, and an information scavenger hunt. Websit e page views increased by $102\%$ during the expedition compared to the previous 30 days.  

# 7.3. Social media  

The Outreach Officer maintained four web pages during the expedition: the ship’s Twitter accoun t (at least two posts a day), the ship’s Facebook account (at least one post per day), the ship’s Instagram account (at least four posts per week), and the JOIDES Resolution Expedition 391 web pag e (at least one blog post per week). Around 110 posts were made to Twitter, resulting in over 425,00 0 impressions and ${\sim}18{,}500$ engagements (Table T2). Twitter impressions increased by $370\%$ durin g the expedition compared to the previous 60 days. Seventy posts were made to Facebook, reachin g over 183,000 people and resulting in over 15,000 engagements. Facebook reach increased by $414\%$ during the expedition compared to the previous 60 days. More than 45 posts were made to Instagram, reaching more than 39,000 people and garnering over 4350 reactions. Instagram reac h increased by $277\%$ during the expedition compared to the previous 60 days. The Outreach Office r also coordinated a ship-to-ship broadcast event with the Exploration Vessel Nautilus on Faceboo k Live, which was viewed 722 times.  

# 7.4. Educational materials  

To provide enduring access to Expedition 391 science, the Outreach Officer is developing a serie s of digital resources to be used in formal and informal educational settings. The goal of these materials is not only to immerse students in the science of Expedition 391 but also to make scienc e accessible for students whose demographics are historically underrepresented in the field. Thes e resources include a video compiled of several interviews with a diverse group of scientists discussing their paths to success in the field, lessons to help students develop fundamental science skills, and inquiry-based investigations to engage students in an authentic process of science. The lessons will be fully digital, allowing teachers to modify them as necessary to fit their students’ needs, and they will be appropriate for the postpandemic classroom.
