# Abstract  

The  objective  of  International  Ocean  Discovery  Progra m (IODP) Expedition 384 was to carry out engineering tests with th e goal of improving the chances of success in deep $(>\!1\ensuremath{\mathrm{~km}})$ drillin g and coring in igneous ocean crust. A wide range of tools and technologies for potential testing were proposed by the Deep Crusta l Drilling Engineering Working Group in 2017 based on reports fro m recent crustal drilling expeditions. The JOIDES Resolution Facilit y Board further prioritized the testing opportunities in 2018. The to p priority of all recommendations was an evaluation of drilling an d coring bits because rate of penetration and bit wear and tear are th e prevalent issue in deep crustal drilling attempts, and bit failures often require an excessive amount of fishing and hole cleaning time. The plan included drilling in basalt with three different types of dril l bits: a tungsten carbide insert (TCI) tricone bit, a polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit, and a more novel TCI/PDC hybrid bit. In addition, a TCI bit was to be paired with an underreamer wit h expanding cutter blocks instead of extending arms. Finally, a type o f rotary core barrel (RCB) PDC coring bit that was acquired for th e R/V JOIDES Resolution several years ago but never deployed woul d also be given a test run.  

A second objective was added when additional operating tim e became available for Expedition 384 as a result of the latest schedul e changes. This objective included the assessment and potential improvement of current procedures for advanced piston corer (APC ) core orientation.  

Expedition 384 began in Kristiansand, Norway, on 20 July 2020. The location for tests was based on various factors, including th e JOIDES Resolution’s location at the time, our inability to obtain territorial clearance in a short period of time, and a suitable combination of sediment and igneous rock for the drilling and corin g operations. IODP Expedition 395, which was postponed due to th e COVID-19 pandemic, had proposed sites that were suitable for ou r testing and offered the opportunity to carry out some serendipitou s sampling, logging, and casing work for science.  

We first spent 3 days triple coring the top $70\textrm{m}$ of sediment a t Site U1554 (Proposed Site REYK-6A) to obtain cores for evaluatin g potential problems with the magnetic core orientation tools and fo r assessing other potential sources of errors that might explain prio r anomalous core orientation results. Comparison of the observe d core orientation from magnetic orientation tools to the expecte d orientation based on the paleomagnetic directions recorded in th e cores revealed an $180^{\circ}$ misalignment in the assembly of one of th e tools. This misalignment appears to have persisted over severa l years and could explain most of the problems previously noted. Th e assembly part was fixed, and this problem was eliminated for futur e expeditions.  

We subsequently spent 20 days at Site U1555 (Proposed Sit e REYK-13A) to test the three types of drill bits, an underreamer, an d a coring bit in six holes. The TCI bits were the best performers, th e TCI/PDC hybrid bit did not stand up to the harsh formation, an d the PDC bit did not get sufficient run time because of a mud moto r failure. The cutter block underreamer is not considered able to perform major hole opening in basalt but could be useful for knockin g out ledges. The PDC coring bit cut good quality basalt cores at a n unacceptably low rate.  

In the seventh and final hole (U1555G), we used a regular RC B coring bit to recover the entire $130\;\mathrm{m}$ basalt section specified in th e Expedition 395 Scientific Prospectus and provided the project tea m with shipboard data and samples. The basalt section was successfully wireline logged before the logging winch motor failed, whic h precluded further operations for safety reasons. Additional operations plans in support of Expedition 395, including coring, logging, and casing at Site U1554, had to be canceled, and Expedition 38 4 ended prematurely on 24 August in Kristiansand.  

# Introduction  

# Challenges of crustal drilling  

Advancing fundamental scientific objectives such as investigations of the evolution of oceanic crust, hydrothermal circulatio n and material exchanges between crust and seawater, and the natur e and extent of the deep biosphere requires drilling and coring dee p $(>\!1\;\mathrm{km})$ into oceanic crust. Deep crustal drilling using the R/V JOIDES Resolution continues to face significant challenges in achievin g such deep holes. A major part of these challenges is related to th e level of resources allocated to crustal drilling by the scientific community and funding agencies, including operational time, money fo r equipment, full-time personnel, and long-term planning. Thes e types of challenges are outside the scope of what the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) can address and therefore outside th e scope of this project. The other part of the challenges is related t o the performance and operation of drilling, coring, and casing equipment. This includes primary performance metrics such as the rat e of penetration (ROP) when coring or drilling, hole cleaning, casing, and so forth, as well as the risk of equipment failure, which require s extensive fishing and hole remediation time and is perhaps the mos t detrimental issue facing crustal drilling. The use of real-time dat a collected on the rig or at the bit to optimize drilling operations an d analyze and troubleshoot problems presents an additional ongoin g operational challenge. Some of these engineering and operational challenges can be addressed when engineering expeditions such a s Expedition 384 are placed on the JOIDES Resolution schedule, tes t priorities are established, and adequate funding is allocated.  

The two most recent JOIDES Resolution expeditions attemptin g to core deep holes into oceanic crust were Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 335, Superfast Spreading Rate Crust 4 (1 3 April–3 June 2011; Teagle, Ildefonse, Blum, and the Expedition 33 5 Scientists, 2012; see Expedition 335 Scientists [2012] for a detaile d operational assessment), and International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 360, Southwest Indian Ridge Lower Crus t and Moho (30 November 2015–30 January 2016; MacLeod, Dick, Blum, and the Expedition 360 Scientists, 2017; see Dick et al. [2016 ] for a detailed operational assessment). In May 2017, outcomes fro m these two expeditions motivated the JOIDES Resolution Facilit y Board (JRFB) to recommend that a Deep Crustal Drilling Engineering workshop be held (JOIDES Resolution Facility Board, 2017). That workshop was held in October 2017 (Deep Crustal Drillin g Engineering Working Group, 2017), and the reports from Expeditions 335 and 360 were the main references for its deliberations an d recommendations. The operational and technical challenges o f these two expeditions are therefore briefly summarized here.  

# Expedition 335  

Expedition 335 was the fourth occupation of Ocean Drillin g Program (ODP) Hole 1256D (Guatemala Basin, Cocos plate). Th e objective was to advance the hole from 1507 meters below seafloo r (mbsf) into lower crust gabbroic rocks by as much as several hundred meters. Only ${\sim}4\%$ of the time was spent on coring, and Hol e 1256D was advanced a mere $15\,\textrm{m}$ from 1507 to 1522 mbsf in  4 weeks. Three major issues forced us to spend $93\%$ of operational time with hole remediation and stabilization. First, we encountere d an obstruction in the open hole at 920–950 mbsf, and it took a tota l of 16 days and eight reentries to attempt to drill through, cemen t the interval, drill a fresh hole through the cemented problem interval, and reach the bottom of the hole. After coring ${\sim}13~\mathrm{m}$ in ${<}30\ \mathrm{h}$ with a Rock Bit International (RBI) C9 hard formation coring bit, penetration came to a grinding halt and a problem was suspected a t the bit. Upon recovery of the drill string, we found that the bit wa s ground and honed to a smooth stump with all four cones, four legs, and core guides gone. The following 19 days were spent cleanin g (and reaming) the hole, primarily driven by the need to remov e metal debris before coring could continue. In this process, we encountered a huge amount of rock debris from previous and curren t drilling and coring in Hole 1256D. The debris not only filled jun k baskets deployed with fishing magnets, mill shoes, reverse circulation junk baskets (RCJBs) and flow-through junk baskets, but als o bit subs and up to five drill collars (through the float valve). Th e junk recovery also included cobble-sized rocks from near the bottom of the hole, assumed to have been water-jetted from the borehole wall as a result of the intense cleaning action. After five fishin g trips, we still had not reached the bottom of the hole by a few meter s and decided to ream to the bottom with a tricone (roller cone) bit. Upon recovery of the bit, we found that it had virtually no wear bu t was under gauge, indicating that it had been squeezed into a smalle r diameter hole. After reaming the lowermost ${\sim}3\;\mathrm{m}$ with another tricone bit, six more milling, fishing, and cleaning trips were conducted.  After  a  logging  run,  the  last  of  24  reentries  durin g Expedition 335 was dedicated to coring with a new Ulterra $9\%$ inc h rotary core barrel (RCB) bit for the last ${\sim}6\,\mathrm{h}$ available and advance d the hole $1.4~\mathrm{m}$ to a final depth of 1520.2 mbsf. Hole 1256D finall y seemed clear and ready for further coring.  

# Expedition 360  

Expedition 360 was the second return to Atlantis Bank, and th e objective was to drill a third hole in the vicinity of existing OD P Holes 735B and 1105A with the ultimate multiexpedition goal t o drill and core to the Mohorovicic seismic discontinuity (Moho) a t $\sim\!3\,\mathrm{km}$ depth. Hole 735B was successfully cored to 1508 mbsf durin g two previous expeditions and was terminated only because the entire drill string failed at the rig and fell into the hole, obstructing i t for good. Based on the advice of the scientific advisory panel, th e new hole was to be located a few kilometers away from Hole 735 B and cored from the top to learn about the lateral variability of th e crustal architecture and evolution on Atlantis Bank. IODP Hol e U1473A was established $\sim\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ away from Holes 735B and 1105A. The reentry system was installed efficiently and successfully int o the bare rock seafloor in ${<}2$ days. This was followed by successfu l coring to 410 mbsf in ${\sim}11$ days. Coring at this rate would have allowed us to reach a respectable 1200 mbsf in the remaining time. A t this point, however, three of the four roller cones were lost in problematic hole conditions associated with faults. We deployed tw o fishing magnets followed by two RCJBs for 3 days without recovering any cones. To everyone’s surprise, the last RCJB recovered a n unprecedented $_{0.5\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ ( $18\ \mathrm{cm}$ diameter) core, which made it extremely unlikely that we had roller cones at the bottom of the hole. During intermittent coring and hole remediation for 7 days, we advanced the hole a mere $72\textrm{m}$ to 482 mbsf. Penetration rates whil e coring were high and recovery was low in a highly fractured formation, and we lost another roller cone. The second of two subsequen t RCJB runs recovered one roller cone. We continued coring but soo n came to a grinding halt. Upon recovery of the drill string, the bi t showed damage clearly attributable to having been grinding on  a lost cone. We deployed a fishing magnet and recovered a highl y abraded roller cone. At that point, we decided to drill ahead withou t coring for a couple of days. We advanced the hole to 519 mbsf at  a rate that was not significantly better than coring. The subsequent 1 0 days were spent coring with excellent recovery in less fractured gabbroic rock (similar to Hole 735B), reaching a total depth for Hol e U1473A of 789 mbsf. With a week of operations left, we droppe d the spent coring bit on the seafloor using a mechanical bit releas e (MBR) and conducted two successful logging runs. Our plan was t o spend the remaining time coring; however, when the logging bit arrived back on the rig floor, a retainer sleeve was missing from th e MBR and had to be assumed left in the hole. This situation was indirectly confirmed with a subsequent RCJB fishing run recoverin g two large gravel pieces with characteristic marks.  

Half a year later (July 2016), during a transit from a tie-up perio d in Cape Town, South Africa, to Colombo, Sri Lanka, on a 33 da y transit, JOIDES Resolution passed by Hole U1473A. The JRFB approved a plan in March 2016 to spend 9 days out of that transit t o remediate Hole U1473A (Blum et al., 2017): (1) fish for the lost MB R retainer sleeve, (2) core up to $20\,\mathrm{m}$ to confirm the viability for futur e deepening of the hole, and (3) complete cementing the fault zone s between 420 and 580 mbsf to stabilize the hole for future penetration (a lesson learned from Expedition 335). We quickly determine d that the MBR sleeve was not in the hole; it must have been recovered with the last RCJB fishing trip during Expedition 360 and falle n to the seafloor when the bit was recovered without leaving any operational evidence. Subsequent coring successfully deepened Hol e U1473A to 809.4 mbsf and cleared it for future deepening. The cement job to stabilize the hole was partially completed; the fault zon e accommodated more cement than anticipated. Additional cementing attempts were limited by the quantity of cement on board tha t could be utilized for hole remediation.  

# Two types of challenges of deep crustal drilling  

Based on the experiences with Expeditions 335 and 360, as well as other similar operations, the challenges of deep crustal drillin g must be differentiated into those that can and those that cannot b e addressed with an engineering expedition. The following are critical but nontechnical challenges:  

• Deep crustal drilling takes time and patience and requires a substantial resource commitment by the scientific drilling community. Drilling a new frontier is guaranteed to face known and unknown operational problems. Both Holes 1256D and U1473A could have been deepened further with existing technology if more than 4–6 weeks of operations had been allocated. • Principal investigators tend to expect immediate scientific return from any drilling or coring operations. That expectation may be in conflict with the need to spend time for proper engineering or conditioning of a top hole if deep penetration is the objective, as exemplified by the decision for Hole U1473A. Proper engineering with existing technology may include fast drilling (without coring) or reaming and subsequent casing of a hole, preferably close to an existing pilot hole such as Holes 1256D and 735B, so that deeper coring has a fair chance of success. • IODP Expedition 362T was an example of how to use a cost-effective opportunity to remediate and condition a hole. Few or no scientists are required to be on board to execute such standard operational tasks. The few cores we recovered to establish viability for future deepening were described and analyzed by a science team on shore.  

The challenges that can be addressed with engineering project s such as Expedition 384 include the following:  

• Coring bit failure is by far the biggest problem. It is hard to detect and requires time consuming fishing and milling operations. Better use of rig instrumentation data may (and has been demonstrated to) allow operators to detect bit failure earlier, but in most cases detection still happens after the failure has occurred. The complete destruction of the coring bit in the granoblastic dike formation at the bottom of Hole 1256D in hours may have been the result of a tight hole, or it may point to an absolute limit of what available coring bits are able to do. Bit failures in Hole U1473A were attributed to the more common problem of rubble in fault zones, both ahead of the bit and falling onto the bit from above. Unfortunately, coring bit research and development appear to be vanishing, and we do not know of the existence of suitable alternatives to our coring bits that would alleviate these problems.   
• The tricone drilling bits commonly used on JOIDES Resolution are in general more robust than coring bits but have been shown to be “squeezed” in Hole 1256D in an interval previously cored under gauge. Drilling bits are mainly deployed to open (and potentially case) a hole in the vicinity of a pilot hole that was previously cored in preparation for deep drilling or to remediate various types of problems such as hole collapse (and potential cementing of the interval), coring bit failure follow-up, undergauge intervals, and so forth. Drilling bit alternatives do exist on the market, and an engineering expedition is a good opportunity to evaluate some in a systematic fashion. Identification of better drill bit technology may eventually lead to the development of more robust coring bits.   
• Casing a hole is one principal way to stabilize a hole and minimize the risk of coring bit failure. If Hole 1256D had been cased to 1000 mbsf instead of 263 mbsf (sediment section only), the 2 weeks spent to get past the ledge at 920–950 mbsf during Expedition 335 might have been avoided. We have successfully deployed casing strings from JOIDES Resolution up to $1100\,\mathrm{m}$ long in sedimentary systems. Deploying casing is expensive and time consuming and bears its own operational risk, but it’s a reasonable if not unavoidable trade off for successful deep drilling and coring. Importantly, casing will also improve the hydraulic conditions for hole cleaning.   
• Cleaning debris from the hole will be an increasingly challenging issue the deeper a hole is advanced. The sepiolite and attapulgite used safely in open hole drilling appears to be an adequate agent; however, large quantities are required, and the necessary time must be invested so as not to leave an overwhelming amount of debris for a future expedition (see Expedition 335). Failure to keep up with rigorous hole cleaning will compromise a hole. Casing as much as possible of the top hole is the best way to ensure effective hole cleaning, especially if challenging hole conditions are encountered (e.g., Hole U1473A) at borehole depths where casing can be deployed. Hole cleaning after a problem has already occurred may also have side effects. During Expedition 335, the intense, high-powered cleaning of the lowermost portion of Hole 1256D resulted in water-jetted cobble-sized rocks that had to be fished, ground, and flushed with a large investment of time. The enlarged hole resulting from this operation may compromise future operations in Hole 1256D.  

# Expedition 384 objectives Scoping of Expedition 384 engineering test objectives  

At their May 2017 meeting, the JRFB made the following recommendation (JOIDES Resolution Facility Board, 2017):  

“Consensus 7: The JRFB recommends the immediate formation o f a ‘Deep Crustal Drilling Engineering’ workgroup at the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) with representatives of the JRF B and JRSO, Siem Offshore drilling engineers, and the principal proponents, in order to review the results of Expedition 360 ‘SW India n Ridge Lower Crust and Moho, Leg 1’ and Expedition 355 ‘Superfas t Spreading Rate Crust, Leg $4^{\prime}$ and make recommendations on how t o successfully achieve drilling, coring, and logging deeper than $1.5\,\mathrm{km}$ into ocean crust hard rock environments. . . .”  

The Deep Crustal Drilling Engineering Working Group workshop was subsequently held on 16–18 October 2017 and recommended the following testing opportunities for Expedition 384, which at that time was still scheduled for 2019 (Deep Crustal Drilling Engineering Working Group, 2017):  

“Recommendation 5: Engineering Expedition 2019. This engineering opportunity should be conducted in the shallowest wate r possible in the eastern Pacific region in order to minimize time fo r tripping pipe and retrieving core. This expedition should employ  a Project Coordination Team to develop the protocol for applicatio n to complex drilling expeditions. Technologies to be tested tha t could dramatically improve deep crustal drilling and coring include:  

• Sensor subs at the drill bit   
• Different bits (PDC, hybrid, etc.) for drilling and coring   
• Lined core barrels   
• Expandable casing   
• Biodegradable additives to drilling fluid”  

The workshop recommendation was further prioritized by th e JRFB at their May 2018 meeting (JOIDES Resolution Facility Board, 2018) in light of the available time frame and budget:  

“Consensus 6: The JRFB recommends the following engineerin g tests to be carried out during Expedition 384 by the JRSO in orde r of priority:  

1. New drilling bits for improved advancement, opening and remediation of drill holes in hard rock formations.   
2. New underreamers for opening up holes in hard rock formations.   
3. New coring bits for coring in hard rock formations.   
4. New biodegradable drilling fluid additives for improved hole cleaning.   
5. New bottom-driven XCB based on current Chikyu XCB designs.   
6. Continued testing of the Turbine Driven Coring System (TDC) depending on the outcome of first tests during Expedition 376 and discussions with CDEX.   
7. [Motion Decoupled Hydraulic Delivery System] MDHDS testing in conjunction with the T2P system.”  

Based on the JRFB guidance, the JRSO project team developed  a plan that addressed Recommendations 1 (drilling bits), 2 (underreamers), and to the degree possible, 3 (coring bits) (JOIDES Resolution Facility Board, 2018) (Table T1).  

Recommendation 3 (coring bit design) was addressed with a n existing polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit, with low expectations. Potential design of a new coring bit specifically suite d for basaltic rocks must be postponed. Our hope was that the experience with the drill bits during Expedition 384 might point to a design approach. Recommendation 4 (drilling mud alternatives) wa s considered, but the leading biodegradable mud enhancer, recommended during the deep crustal workshop, is no longer being manufactured. Also, the shallow depths for this expedition would not b e an adequate test for drilling mud alternatives. Recommendation  6 (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology’s turbinedriven coring system) figured in an earlier version of the plan bu t ultimately could not be added because of the travel and shippin g complications associated with multiple expedition rescheduling. Recommendation 5 (bottom-drive extended core barrel [XCB]) wa s dropped because of time considerations and because the tool coul d likely be tested during the course of normal operations or during  a transit. Recommendation 7 (MDHDS) was dropped because th e tool will be replaced by the probe deployment tool (PDT) currentl y under development, and to be tested, by the same third party tea m that developed the MDHDS.  

# Primary objectives  

The following questions were to be addressed by the tests:  

• Can we acquire drill bits that drill holes faster than has been possible in the past, in preparation for logging and casing?   
• Can we acquire bits that last longer in harsh igneous rock formation than in the past?   
• Is it possible to ream an igneous rock hole for casing operations using a different type of reamer than used in the past?   
• Should we take another look at PDC coring bits for better recovery and, less likely, faster coring?  

# Drilling bits  

The first primary objective was to test and compare the performance of three types of drill bits: (1) the conventional tungsten carbide insert (TCI) tricone bit, but a more robust model tha n previously used on JOIDES Resolution; (2) a ruggedized PDC bi t with some “harder rock” success according to the vendor, using  a new, more robust cutter shape; and (3) a TCI/PDC hybrid bit tha t combines roller cone crushing efficiency with fixed cutter elements. We decided to focus on one size ( $12\%$ inches) for bits because the y are industry standard and readily available and because they are suitable to drill holes for deep casing.  

A mud motor was to be used in these drilling tests to increas e the total rotational speed to at least $120\,\mathrm{rpm}$ . Depending on the outcome of these tests, additional deployments of the best performin g drill bit and a regular C7 coring bit would be considered. The tes t holes were to be spaced ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ from each other to ensure comparable hole conditions. After washing through the ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t cover, which serves to stabilize the bottom-hole assembly (BHA), each drill bit was to penetrate up to ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ into basaltic basemen t or as far as the lifetime of the bit allowed, and shorter runs with th e underreamer and coring bits were planned. A small number of cor e samples would be made available to the drilling engineers analyzin g the results, and additional core samples would be made available t o the IODP Expedition 395 science team.  

# Underreamer  

Our second primary objective was to conduct performance test s on an underreamer that could open the $12\%$ inch hole to $14\%$ inches. Vendors and JRSO engineers agreed that the chances of success were minimal; however, one vendor was willing to provide  a newer type of underreamer with expanding cutter blocks instead o f the extending arms used by the JRSO in the past. The underreame r was to be made up with the same type of TCI bit and mud moto r used in the drill bit tests.  

# PDC coring bit  

The third primary objective was to deploy one or more of th e four standard PDC-cutter coring bits available on JOIDES Resolution, which were built for our RCB coring BHA for a project wit h another operator several years ago. These bits have never bee n used, and we were planning to test them during Expedition 384. Depending on the outcome of these tests, deployment of a regular C 7 coring bit would be considered to obtain the desired samples.  

# Site selection  

The locations for the tests were selected based on various factors, including the JOIDES Resolution’s location at the time, our inability to obtain territorial clearance in a short period time, and  a suitable combination of sediment and igneous rock for the corin g operations. Expedition 395, which was postponed because of th e COVID-19 pandemic, included proposed sites that were suitable fo r our testing and offered the opportunity to carry out some serendipitous sampling, logging, and casing work for science (Figures F1, F2, F3, F4). In particular, Proposed Site REYK-13A perfectly met the logistics, water depth, and sediment thickness requirements (Figur e F3). A contingency plan of attempting to drill into the gabbro-dominated formation at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U130 9 was canceled soon after Expedition 384 departed from Kristiansand, Norway, when the arrival port changed from Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, to Kristiansand because of COVID-19 travel restrictions.  

# Secondary objectives  

The main objective of Expedition 384 was to test drilling, reaming, and coring equipment in igneous ocean crust. Operational schedule changes related to some major JOIDES Resolution repair s as well as travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemi c provided an opportunity to conduct other operations. Given th e short notice and preparation time, the JRSO decided to insert an assessment of the advanced piston corer (APC) core orientation tool s and procedures during Expedition 384.  

Azimuthal orientation of APC cores using magnetic orientatio n tools (MOTs) has been routinely performed for many years. Th e tool currently used is the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool; th e FlexIT tool was used in the past and is also available. However, recent experience has shown that these measurements are unreliable, working consistently during some expeditions and failing repeatedly during others. The objective during Expedition 384 was to investigate the origin of the problem by assessing the procedures an d equipment used for orienting the cores under more controlled conditions than is typically possible during expeditions when the focu s is on maximizing core recovery. We planned to recover APC core s in three adjacent holes to 70 mbsf to obtain a sufficient number o f orientation measurements that could be compared with the paleomagnetic measurements in the stratigraphically correlated cores.  

The site chosen for the primary engineering objective, Propose d Site REYK-13A, happened to have a companion site ${<}100\,\mathrm{km}$ away, Proposed Site REYK-6A, that had the requisite young sediments expected to be good paleomagnetic recorders based on results fro m nearby drift sediments cored ${\sim}150\,\mathrm{km}$ to the northeast during OD P Leg 162 (Sites 983 and 984; Figure F2) (Jansen, Raymo, Blum, P., e t al., 1996; Channel 1999). The paleomagnetic declination for thes e Brunhes age sediments were expected to average to approximatel y due north, providing the reference declination against which th e orientation tools could be tested.  

# Site summaries Site U1554  

# Operations  

Operations at Site U1554 (Proposed Site REYK-6A) began afte r the $1100\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Kristiansand, Norway, which ended a t $0629\ \mathrm{h}$ on 27 July 2020 when we established dynamic positioning. The average speed of the transit was $11.6\,\mathrm{kt}$ .  

An $11\%$ inch APC/XCB bit was made up with a $136.8\mathrm{~m~}$ lon g BHA, and the drill string was deployed at $1445~\mathrm{h}$ . The pipe stand s were measured and cleared of rust during deployment. Hol e U1554A was started at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ with a $5.7\;\mathrm{m}$ long mudline core. Th e calculated water depth was $1870~\mathrm{m}$ . We completed APC coring i n Hole U1554A at $0625\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 July with Core 8H to $72.2~\mathrm{m}$ drillin g depth below seafloor (DSF) with a recovery of $74.7\mathrm{~m~}(103\%)$ . Th e ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ east, and Hole U1554B was completed at 151 5 h with Core 8H to $76.0\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF with a recovery of $76.8\:\mathrm{m}\:(101\%)$ . Th e ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south, and we completed Hole U1554C at 233 0 h with Core 8H to $75.0~\mathrm{m}$ DSF with a recovery of $77.0\ \mathrm{m}$ $(103\%)$ . Core orientation was measured on all cores in each hole. On 29 July, the ship was offset once more, this time $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1554C, and coring in Hole U1554D began at $0045~\mathrm{h}$ . Here, we drilled to 1 4 m DSF and cored a single core (2H) from 14 to $23.5~\mathrm{m}$ DSF with  a recovery of $9.72\mathrm{~m~}(102\%)$ . This core was taken for future trainin g and testing purposes on the ship. In total, 25 cores were recovere d at Site U1554 (Table T2). The drill string was retrieved and cleare d the rig floor at $0715\ \mathrm{h},$ ending operations at Site U1554. The ri g floor was secured, and the ship began the transit to Site U1555 (Proposed Site REYK-13A) at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ . Total time spent at Site U1554 wa s 2.0 days.  

# Preliminary results  

# Stratigraphic characterization  

Core logging and stratigraphic correlation. The core orientation tests required a set of stratigraphically correlated cores characterized with the standard set of shipboard measurements an d observations. To that end, all cores from Holes U1554A–U1554 D were first measured for magnetic susceptibility (MS) and gamm a ray attenuation (GRA) on the Special Task Multisensor Logge r (STMSL). The STMSL was configured to perform these measurements as rapidly as possible to allow for real-time feedback to th e driller to ensure that all coring gaps in a hole were covered by core s in at least one of the adjacent holes. Our coring gaps in Hol e U1554A were perfectly covered in cores from both Holes U1554 B and U1554C using that method. We constructed a composite dept h scale to $83.3~\mathrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) and  a splice representative of the complete stratigraphic section (Table s T2, T3; Figure F5). All cores from Holes U1554A and U1554B wer e used except for Core 384-U1554B-5H, which was more disturbe d by the coring process than all other cores. We replaced it with Cor e 384-U1554C-5H for the splice.  

Higher resolution measurements of MS and GRA were made o n the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL), which include d  

$P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements, and all whole-round core section s were also measured on the Natural Gamma Radiation Logge r (NGRL). All cores were subsequently split and imaged with both visual light and X-ray. Color reflectance and MS measurements wer e made using the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). A small set of discrete samples were taken from the working-half section s for moisture and density and magnetic property measurements. Magnetic remanence was measured on all archive-half sections using the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM).  

Paleomagnetic chronostratigraphy. The sediments proved t o be high-fidelity recorders of the Brunhes normal polarity geomagnetic field, with the exception of Core 384-U1554B-5H, which suffered  drilling  disturbance  throughout  (Figures  F6,  F7) . Furthermore, the MS and relative paleomagnetic intensity record s can be correlated with a high degree of confidence to the equivalen t records from nearby Sites 983 and 984, where the records wer e dated with the help of oxygen stable isotopes (Channel, 1999). Based on this correlation, we infer that the sediments in the top 8 3 m CCSF at Site U1554 represent the last ${\sim}0.6\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , yielding an average sedimentation rate of ${\sim}14\;\mathrm{cm/ky}.$ .  

Lithostratigraphy. The sediment section recovered at Sit e U1554 is a fine-grained mixture of clay- to silt-sized siliciclastic s and ash. The fine-grained texture is uniform throughout, with th e exception of two pebbles observed and interpreted to be dropstones. The color transitions between shades of greenish gray an d gray in intervals on the order of a few centimeters to meters. Th e color transitions are generally gradual over a few centimeters an d only sharp in a few cases where a dark greenish gray ash-dominate d layer overlies a light greenish gray or gray layer. The sediment constituents are dominated by silt-sized particles and/or ash in th e greenish gray layers based on smear slide observations and as expected for a drift deposit in a volcanic province. In gray intervals, calcareous nannofossils are abundant or dominant. The silt fractio n in these sediments may largely represent broken down volcaniclastic particles rather than siliciclastic grains. Clay and siliceous microfossils (mainly sponge spicules and diatoms), as well as calcareou s nannofossils in the darker greenish gray layers, are subordinate constituents. The ash is mostly dispersed and mixed with the other constituents and is more concentrated in thin, darker greenish gra y layers. The sediment is intensely bioturbated, as indicated by discrete burrows, particularly at interval boundaries with strong colo r contrast, by ash pods representing remnants of ash layers, and b y pervasive mottling. The greenish gray sediments can be referred t o as silty ash or tuffaceous silt with nannofossils and siliceous microfossils, and the light gray layers can be referred to as tuffaceou s nannofossil ooze. Note that this differs from the Leg 162 descriptions at nearby Sites 983 and 984, which characterize the sedimen t as terrigenous silty clay, clay, clayey nannofossil mixed sediment, and clay with variable amounts of nannofossils and silt (Jansen, Raymo, Blum, P., et al., 1996). We didn’t observe that dominance o f clay at Site U1554 using smear slide observations and primitive settling and remolding tests.  

# Core orientation tests  

Core orientation tests were initiated mainly because multipl e previous expeditions had reported suspect orientation results, wit h large scatter and anomalous core orientation estimates. Thus, ou r study aimed to monitor all steps in the orientation process for  a suite of cores to document where orientation errors might be introduced and provide estimates about the size of the errors associate d with core orientation. We also planned to assess multiple MOTs t o determine if the apparent aberrant results originated from one o r more of the tools.  

To assess whether the core orientation tools were functionin g accurately, different MOTs were deployed while acquiring the 2 5 cores in Holes U1554A–U1554D. Eight cores were collected wit h FlexIT Tool 0937, and the remaining 17 cores were collected wit h three Icefield tools (2007, 2043, and 2052). These tools give an angle, referred to as the magnetic tool face (MTF) angle, that can b e used to determine the azimuthal orientation of the core. The azimuthal orientation that is determined from the MTF angle will b e referred to as the observed orientation.  

The FlexIT and Icefield tools have essentially the same capabilities, but the Icefield tools are newer tools and have more memor y than the FlexIT tools, which are no longer produced. These MOT s have three orthogonal fluxgate magnetometers, three orthogona l accelerometers, and a thermistor. The output includes measurement number/time, MTF angle, total magnetic field strength, horizontal and vertical magnetic field components, dip of the hole an d its azimuth, three accelerometer components, and the temperatur e (Table T4).  

Paleomagnetic data from APC cores provide an independent estimate of the azimuthal orientation of the cores. Based on the geocentric axial dipole (GAD) hypothesis, the mean declination of th e geomagnetic field when averaged over several tens of thousands o f years will be $0^{\circ}$ . The instantaneous or short-term field differs from  a GAD field, but those differences or variations, referred to as paleosecular variation, are averaged out over time. In other words, the average  paleomagnetic  declination  computed  from  sediment s deposited over time will point toward Earth’s spin axis or Nort h Pole if the sediments were deposited during a normal polarity interval. Site U1554 was selected because the normal polarity Brunhe s age $\left(<780\;\mathrm{ka}\right)$ sediments in the Bjorn drift were known to be excellent paleomagnetic recorders (Channell, 1999), allowing the mea n paleomagnetic declination of each core to be accurately determined. The deviation of the in situ core mean declination from $0^{\circ}$ provides an estimate of the azimuthal orientation of the core. Thi s paleomagnetic orientation, therefore, provides very tight constraints on what will be referred to as the expected orientation. Comparison of the MOT observed orientation to the GAD expected orientation provides the basis for determining the accurac y and precision of the MOTs (Table T4).  

We used the paleomagnetic data from archive-half sections, except for the one core collected from Hole U1554D, for which w e used data only from whole-round Section 384-U1554D-2H-7. Th e split-core sections were measured every $1\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ using progressive alternating field (AF) demagnetization up to $25~\mathrm{mT}$ (Figure F6), typically with 7 steps (0, 2, 6, 10, 15, 20, and $25~\mathrm{mT}$ ). Selected section s were progressively demagnetized in more detail using 13 steps $\left(0-\right.$ $22\,\mathrm{mT}$ at $2\:\mathrm{mT}$ steps and $\mathrm{a\,25\,mT}$ step). Section 2H-7 was measure d every $1\ \mathrm{cm}$ using detailed progressive AF demagnetization (0–8 0 mT at $5\;\mathrm{mT}$ steps) (Figure F6C). Demagnetization to $25~\mathrm{mT}$ prove d more than sufficient to resolve the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) very accurately while also retaining enough magnetization for other postexpedition studies.  

The ChRM directions for each hole are plotted in Figure F7. Th e declinations are shown in sample coordinates prior to reorientation, after being corrected using the MOT reorientation angles, and afte r being corrected using the paleomagnetic data assuming a GA D field. It is clear visually that the MOTs corrected the declination s close to the expected values.  

The accuracy of the MOTs can be assessed in detail by comparing the observed reorientation angles measured by the MOT s $(R_{\mathrm{MOT}})$ to the expected reorientation angles determined from paleomagnetic measurements assuming the geomagnetic field corresponds to a GAD $(R_{\mathrm{GAD}})$ (Table T4). These are computed using th e following equations:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{R_{\mathrm{MOT}}=A_{\mathrm{MTF}}+D_{\mathrm{IGRF}},\mathrm{and}}\\ &{}\\ &{R_{\mathrm{GAD}}=-D_{\mathrm{P}}=360^{\circ}-D_{\mathrm{P}},}\end{array}
$$  

where  

$A_{\mathrm{MTF}}=\ensuremath{\mathrm{MTF}}$ angle from the MOT,   
$D_{\mathrm{IGRF}}=$ present-day magnetic declination at the site determined from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model $(-13.6^{\circ})$ , and   
$D_{\mathrm{p}}={}$ core mean declination determined from the paleomagnetic measurements.  

The difference between the expected and observed declinations i s given by  

$$
\Delta R=R_{\mathrm{MOT}}-R_{\mathrm{GAD}}.
$$  

The initially determined $\Delta R$ values for 20 of the 25 cores differe d by $\angle28^{\circ}$ . One core (384-U1554B-5H) had significant coring disturbance throughout, as was evident in the $\mathrm{X}$ -ray images, and was no t used in the assessment. The paleomagnetic directions were clearl y disturbed in this core, and likewise $\Delta R$ was somewhat larger (34.8° ) than observed for the undisturbed cores. The four results obtaine d with Icefield Tool 2043 were all anomalous, with $\Delta R$ values o f 155.3°, $183.6^{\circ}$ , 192.4, and $189.0^{\circ}$ . The average of these happens to b e 180.1°, which indicated that some component in the tool had likel y been inverted.  

We determined these anomalous results were caused by a misaligned internal key for the end seal of the pressure barrel used wit h Icefield Tool 2043, which had been inverted (i.e., it was rotated b y $180^{\circ}$ from its proper position) (Figure F8). This internal key lock s into the T-slot keyhole of the MOT. It must be aligned with the external key of the end seal. The external key is inserted into th e muleshoe keyhole in the sinker bars, thus aligning the MOT wit h the core barrel and liner. We suspect that this had been inverted fo r several years, had been used with other MOTs, and was the primar y reason for the anomalous orientations reported in the past, whic h had sometimes noted orientations that were roughly $180^{\circ}$ off. W e also noted that the internal key for the end seal of the pressure barrel used with FlexIT Tool 0936 was misaligned by about 5°, whic h would have resulted in orientations about $5^{\circ}$ smaller than the y should have been for that tool. All internal keys were checked, an d only minor adjustments of a few degrees were made as needed.  

After correcting the $R_{\mathrm{MOT}}$ values by $180^{\circ}$ for Icefield Tool 2043, the $\Delta R$ values were $\angle28^{\circ}$ for 24 of the 25 cores (Table T4; Figure F9) . Disturbed Core 384-U1554B-5H is the exception and was exclude d from further consideration. For the valid 24 determinations, th e mean $\Delta R$ is $9.1^{\circ}$ and the standard deviation (STDEV) is $13.2^{\circ}$ for all tools. The mean $\Delta R$ is $3.9^{\circ}$ and STDEV is $11.8^{\circ}$ for the 16 Icefiel d tool orientations, and the mean $\Delta R$ is $19.4^{\circ}$ and STDEV is $9.7^{\circ}$ fo r the 8 FlexIT tool orientations. The $95\%$ confidence limits for th e Icefield tool orientations are  

$$
\pm(4.49)^{\%}(13.2^{\circ})/(16)^{\%}=\pm6.2^{\circ}.
$$  

The $95\%$ confidence limits for the FlexIT tool orientations are  

$$
\pm(5.32)^{\%}(9.7^{\circ})/(8)^{\%}=\pm7.9^{\circ}.
$$  

Thus, the Icefield tools accurately measured core orientation s within their uncertainty. FlexIT Tool 0937, however, has a relativel y large bias, with reorientation angles that were on average at leas t $11.5^{\circ}$ smaller than expected. It is possible that FlexIT Tool 093 7 needs to be recalibrated, some other systematic error occurs tha t has yet to be identified, or the bias is related to the fairly small sample size. More measurements would help resolve this issue. Give n that the FlexIT tools have been superseded by the Icefield tools an d the vendor no longer is in business, recalibration or even the opportunity to gather additional data during an upcoming IODP expedition with these tools is not planned.  

Natural questions to ask from the above analysis are why was th e internal key for an Icefield tool misaligned by $180^{\circ}$ and why was thi s misalignment not noticed and fixed. The alignment of the interna l key is adjusted by loosening a jam nut, turning the key to the desire d position, and then tightening the jam nut while holding the key i n its proper position. If one is unfamiliar with the importance of th e alignment of the keys or how the jam nut functions, it would be eas y to overlook aligning the keys in a specific orientation or to misalig n them when loosening or tightening the jam nut. Furthermore, th e key is very similar looking in the proper orientation and when rotated $180^{\circ}$ , with the only difference being a small pin on one side o f the key (Figure F8). Finally, the internal key is not visible when th e tool is in the pressure barrel, which means for most of the time th e tool is handled, no one would be able to note any misalignment o f the internal key.  

It was clear from looking at the service records for the Icefiel d tools that the tools had been sent back to the vendor multiple time s for recalibration because of the anomalous reorientation values th e tools were giving. However, the tools were sent to the vendor without their pressure barrels and end seals, so the vendor could not resolve  the  problem.  They  would  have  noted  the  tools  wer e functioning as intended and done whatever minor recalibration s were needed before sending them back to IODP. After this, one o f these properly functioning tools (not just Icefield Tool 2043) wer e likely used with the end seal with the misaligned internal key, resulting in the recurring anomalous core orientations.  

Although it might seem that the problem was obvious an d would have been easy to catch, multiple paleomagnetists and technicians had conducted tests with the tools over the past severa l years without ever noting the inverted internal key. Given that fou r of the five internal keys were aligned reasonably accurately and al l five tools were functioning properly when not in their pressure barrels, catching the misalignment of one internal key proved deceptively difficult. Even in this study, which had the advantage of havin g sediments ideal for determining the expected core orientation, i t took many tests on the dock with the tools in and out of their pressure barrels before we noted the one misaligned internal key. In th e future, the alignment of the keys will be checked regularly, and eac h Icefield tool will preferably be used with a specific pressure barre l and end seal, all of which will be documented in the data files uploaded into the Laboratory Information Management Syste m (LIMS) database.  

In summary, we concluded that a misaligned internal key on on e of the end seals for an Icefield tool pressure barrel was the probabl e source of the anomalous core orientation results obtained durin g prior expeditions. When that misalignment is accounted for, th e Icefield tools give accurate reorientation angles to within about $\pm12^{\circ}$ (standard deviation) of the expected value for a single core orientation estimate. Given that we only had time to orient 17 cores wit h the Icefield tools, both the accuracy and precision of the tool s should be further evaluated on many more cores from regions wit h paleomagnetic records comparable to the Bjorn drift. Upcomin g Expedition 395 presents an excellent opportunity to enlarge th e sample size by an order of magnitude.  

# Site U1555  

# Operations  

We arrived at Site U1555 at 1541 h on 29 July 2020 after switching to dynamic positioning mode. The ship was positioned $50\,\textrm{m}$ east of the coordinates for Proposed Site REYK-13A along the seismic survey line toward Proposed Site REYK-11A. Additional hole s were planned at $20\textrm{m}$ intervals along this same line. The goal fo r Hole U1555A and subsequent holes was to penetrate ${\sim}210\,\mathrm{~m~}$ o f sediment, as estimated from geophysical site survey data, and the n deepen the hole ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ into the basaltic basement or drill for ${\sim}40$ h, whichever came first. The water depth for Hole U1555A, calculated from precision depth recorder (PDR) readings, was $1516\mathrm{~m~}$ . This water depth was used for all drilling tests for lack of bette r measurements with the drill pipe. A total of five holes were drille d and two holes were cored at Site U1555. A complete set of wirelin e logs was acquired in Hole U1555G. Total time on site was 19.7 days.  

Hole U1555A  

For the first drilling test, a Gemini $12\%$ inch TCI roller cone bit from Schlumberger/Smith Bits was made up with a Baker Hughes  8 inch Ultra XL/VS mud motor. The bit used for this test was simila r to the TCI bits previously used on JOIDES Resolution but was  a much more robust version (IADC Grade 647Y). The motor use d was the same high-torque model used previously on JOIDES Resolution when running casing. The bit and motor assembly was flo w tested before deployment.  

Deployment of the drill string was completed at $0015~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 0 July, and we began drilling Hole U1555A. The seafloor was barel y felt with the drill string at approximately the depth determined b y the PDR. Sediment penetration proceeded at a controlled ROP o f ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m/h}$ . At $0545\,\mathrm{h}$ , with the bit at ${\sim}185\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, the formation stiffened and the ROP slowed by an order of magnitude to typically ${<}5$ $\mathrm{m/h}$ . At $1930\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the bit got stuck at $224\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, and time was spen t trying to free the drill string, including offsetting the ship to be abl e to set the slips and remove a joint of pipe, circulating mud sweeps, and working the pipe free. The bit was raised to $212.6\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF fo r further mud circulation and hole cleaning. On 31 July, the drille r had to pull the bit back two more times by ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ for hole cleanin g with additional mud sweeps at $242.6\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF $(0415\;\mathrm{h})$ and $252.6~\mathrm{m}$ DSF $(0915\,\mathrm{h})$ ). When the bit reached $262.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF $(1045\,\mathrm{h})$ ), the hol e was reamed up to $242.6\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF before the final $20\textrm{m}$ of advancement. We reached the target basement penetration of ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ (97. 4 m exactly) at $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 July at $282.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The drill string wa s retrieved, and the bit cleared the rig floor at $0245~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 August, ending Hole U1555A. The average ROP was $4.2\;\mathrm{m/h}$ over $23.1\,\mathrm{~h~}$ o f bit on bottom. We spent 2.5 days on Hole U1555A.  

Upon recovery, the bit cones, cutters, and bearings were in goo d condition, and the bit was considered reusable for up to $40\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . However, the outer gauge was heavily worn (Figure F10A, F10B).  

# Hole U1555B  

The ship was offset ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1555A in preparatio n for the second test. The second test bit, a $12\%$ inch hybrid TCI/PD C “Kymera” bit from Baker Hughes, was made up to the bottom of th e mud motor and flow tested. The motor started rotating at  5 strokes/min, compared to 30 strokes/min before, indicating that th e bearing assembly was now broken in, but the flow across the moto r seals was still normal. The BHA was made up, and the drill strin g was deployed. Because of heave in excess of $4\textrm{m}$ and winds approaching $40\;\mathrm{kt}$ , the decision was made to suspend operations wit h the bit suspended at $1435\;\mathrm{m}$ below the rig floor or ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{m}$ above th e seafloor.  

At $1200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 August, the heave became safe for operations t o resume. Deployment of the drill string was completed, and drillin g in Hole U1555B began at $1400~\mathrm{h}$ . The sediment was penetrated a t the same controlled ROP of ${\sim}40~\mathrm{m/h}$ used in the first test with th e TCI bit. At $2030\,\mathrm{h},$ we encountered the hard basement formation a t $186.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF, where the ROP dropped by an order of magnitude. A t $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 August, at a bit depth of $210.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF ( $24.2\:\mathrm{m}$ into basement), we decided to terminate drilling based on the low ROP of $^{<1}$ $\mathrm{m/h}$ over $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ . The drill string was retrieved, and the bit cleared th e rig floor at $2225\ \mathrm{h},$ , ending Hole U1555B operations. The averag e ROP was $1.3\;\mathrm{m/h}$ over $19.4\,\mathrm{h}$ of bit on bottom. We spent 2.8 days o n Hole U1555B, of which 1.1 days we spent waiting on weather.  

Upon recovery, the hybrid bit showed significant damage. Several of the PDC cutters were damaged, and pieces of metal wer e missing from the PDC arms (Figure F10C, F10D). The cone bearings appeared to be frozen. The outer diameter (OD; gauge) wa s also significantly damaged. It was later noted that one of the carbid e jet nozzles had come out, which was possibly the cause of the damage to the bit. This bit was not considered reusable.  

# Hole U1555C  

For the third test, the rig floor crew made up a Schlumberge r $12\%$ inch Gemini IAD 647Y (SN RK4875) TCI bit, a Schlumberge r Rhino XS 11625 Series $12\%$ to $14\%$ inch hydraulically expandabl e reamer with StingBlock blades, the mud motor, and the BHA. Th e TCI bit was the same type of bit run during the first test. The mu d motor was the same motor used in the previous tests. The bearin g play on the motor was checked and fell well within the acceptabl e range. The assembly was flow tested at the rig floor. The activatio n ball was placed on the seat in the underreamer because a ball-dro p activation once the reamer is downhole is impossible with a moto r above the reamer. The underreamer cutter blocks shifted at $\mathord{\sim}600$ psi. The cutter blocks opened at ${\sim}45$ strokes/min and were full y open at 50 strokes/min, corresponding to the design parameters o f $220{\-}245\ \mathrm{gal/min},$ , respectively. The drill string was deployed in th e early morning of 4 August, and drilling in Hole U1555C began a t $0650~\mathrm{h}$ using as low a flow rate as possible so as not to engage th e underreamer until necessary. At $1000\;\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{{i}}}$ , the pumping rate was increased to 60 strokes/min to expand the cutter blocks of the reame r with the bit at $130.6\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF. At $1225\ \mathrm{h},$ we reached the top of th e basement at $186.6\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Drilling in Hole U1555C continued unti l $1045~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 August when the underreamer reached $20\;\mathrm{h}$ of operation and the bit was at $225.8\ \mathrm{m}$ DSF $^{39.2\mathrm{~m~}}$ into basement). Th e drill string was retrieved, and the bit cleared the rig floor at $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending the third drilling test and operations in Hole U1555C. Th e average ROP was $1.8\,\mathrm{m/h}$ over $20.0\,\mathrm{h}$ of bit on bottom. We spent 1. 8 days on Hole U1555C.  

Upon recovery, the underreamer had several PDC cutters damaged and the cutter blocks were still extended just over 1 inch (Figure F11A, F11B).  

# Hole U1555D  

For the fourth drilling test, the rig floor crew made up a Smit h Bits/Schlumberger StingBlade (SN 1678) $12\%$ inch PDC bit an d mud motor with the BHA. This was the first time this newer type o f PDC bit with conical-shaped inserts was run on JOIDES Resolution. The mud motor bearings were confirmed to be still in good condition. The ship was offset ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{m}$ east, the drill string was deployed, and drilling in Hole U1555D began at $0245~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 August. The to p of the basement was encountered at $0800~\mathrm{h}$ with the bit at $189.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Drilling continued until $0545\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 August when failure of th e mud motor was indicated by a pressure loss of ${>}200$ psi. The dept h reached with the PDC bit was therefore limited to $222.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DS F $\left.33.9\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ into basement). The drill string was retrieved, and the bi t cleared the rig floor at $^{1040\mathrm{~h},}$ ending Hole U1555D. The averag e ROP was $1.7\,\mathrm{m/h}$ over $20.3\,\mathrm{h}$ of bit on bottom. We spent 1.7 days o n Hole U1555D.  

Once back on the rig floor, the cutters and outer gauge of th e PDC bit were found to be in good condition, and the bit was read y for a follow-up test (Figure F10E, F10F). The mud motor was flo w tested. Rotation started at a higher rate than after the previous run, and the motor appeared to be responding with an intermittent stall in its rotation. The rule of thumb for this type of motor is to perform up to 200 rotating hours under normal operating conditions. Although this motor had only ${\sim}125$ rotating hours, these were i n extreme conditions compared to general oilfield use. The lease d motor will be returned to the vendor for evaluation and refurbishment.  

# Hole U1555E  

The fifth drilling test aimed at advancing the bit that had performed best so far to its performance limit. We altered the pla n slightly by using the Schlumberger Gemini $12\%$ inch TCI bit use d for the third test rather than a third brand new bit but without  a mud motor to preserve the second mud motor on board for upcoming operations. This would also provide information on running th e TCI bit with and without a mud motor. The $20.3\,\mathrm{h}$ of bit on botto m that this bit had accumulated during the third test would be extended by ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{h}$ rather than $20\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to account for the $\sim\!50\%$ lower rotational speed with the top drive alone. The TCI bit and BHA wer e made up and deployed, and drilling in Hole U1555E began at $1650\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 August. The top of the basement was encountered at $2330~\mathrm{h}$ with the bit at $191.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Drilling continued until the maximu m bit depth of $290.6\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF ( $98.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into basement) was reached a t $0300~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 August. The subsequent $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ were spent working tigh t hole conditions, circulating high-viscosity mud sweeps, pulling th e pipe $30\,\mathrm{m}$ off bottom, and attempting to get back to bottom withou t success. At $0500~\mathrm{h}$ , we terminated drilling and retrieved the drill pipe. The bit cleared the rig floor at $1020\ \mathrm{h},$ , ending operations i n Hole U1555E. The bit hours added were ${\sim}24\mathrm{~h~}$ rather than the intended $40~\mathrm{{h}}$ . The average ROP was $4.1~\mathrm{m/h}$ over $23.6~\mathrm{h}$ of bit o n bottom. We spent 2.0 days on Hole U1555E.  

Upon recovery, the bit cones, cutters, and bearings were in generally good condition and considered to be reusable. However, th e outer gauge showed clear signs of wear.  

# Hole U1555F  

The next test was dedicated to the first deployment of one of th e $9\%$ inch RCB PDC coring bits that were acquired several years ag o but never used. The bit and BHA were made up and deployed. Th e drilling line was slipped and cut from 1715 to $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ , and coring i n Hole U1555F began at $2200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 August. Core 1R was an attemp t at establishing the seafloor depth and recovered $2.5~\mathrm{m}$ of sedimen t with a good indication of the mudline. This resulted in a calculate d water depth of $1523\mathrm{~m},7\mathrm{~m}$ deeper than the PDR computed dept h measured for Hole U1555A and used so far at this site. After the recovery of this first core, we drilled ahead without recovery throug h the sediment section with a wash barrel until the basement wa s tagged at $0415\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 August with the bit at $176.3\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. The was h barrel was retrieved, and basement coring began. We retrieved th e core barrel after average advances of just ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{m}$ because the ROP wa s very low. We terminated RCB coring with the PDC bit at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 11 August at a total depth of $184.3\,\mathrm{m}$ DSF. Although the basalt core s we recovered in Hole U1555F were better trimmed than the typica l RCB cores cut with our regular bits, the ROP became unacceptabl y low. We retrieved the drill string, and the bit cleared the rig floor a t $0935\,\mathrm{h},$ ending operations in Hole U1555F. Cores 3R–9R advanced  a total of $8.1\;\mathrm{m}$ in basement over a period of ${\sim}26\,\mathrm{h}$ with a total recovery of $5.81\mathrm{~m~}(72\%)$ (Table T5). The average ROP in basement wa s $0.4~\mathrm{m/h}$ with $20.7\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{h}$ of bit on bottom. We spent 2.0 days on Hol e U1555F.  

Upon recovery, the PDC bit was heavily damaged, with most o f the PDC cutters broken or missing (Figure F11C, F11D). The cutte r pedestals were severely worn, indicating that the bit face itself ha d been turning against the formation. The cutters in the throat of th e bit, where the core trimming takes place, were still fairly intact, explaining the superior core quality compared with regular RCB coring bits.  

# Hole U1555G  

The objective for the final hole was to core and log the $130\mathrm{~m~}$ basalt sequence specified as an Expedition 395 objective. Thi s would provide a few more samples for the drilling test assessment s as well as all the samples needed from this site for the Expeditio n 395 scientific work.  

A standard RCB C7 coring bit was made up with the BHA, including a MBR so we could follow up with wireline logging. Th e drill string was deployed, and drilling in Hole U1555G began a t $1620~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 August. We drilled ahead through the sediment section to $168.6\:\mathrm{m}$ DSF and deployed the first core barrel to recover th e sediment/basement interface. Core 2R advanced from 168.6 t o $178.3~\mathrm{m}$ DSF and recovered $0.66~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment above a $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ lon g piece of basalt. We continued coring the basalt basement in Hol e U1555G and reached the final depth of $309.5\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{DSF}$ at $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 4 August. Basement Cores 3R–27R advanced $131.2\,\mathrm{m}$ and recovered  a total of $59.6~\mathrm{m}$ of basalt $(45\%)$ in $^{70\mathrm{~h~}}$ of coring operations (Tabl e T5; Figure F12). The average ROP was $2.7\;\mathrm{m/h}$ over $48.3\,\mathrm{h}$ of bit o n bottom.  

In preparation for logging, the hole was first swept with 50 bbl o f sepiolite mud. At $2230\,\mathrm{h}_{!}$ , the coring bit was released to the botto m of the hole using the release shifting tool to trigger the MBR. Th e hole was then displaced with heavy mud (barite-weighted to 10. 5 $1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{gal})$ , and the end of the drill pipe was raised to $202.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF ( $[{\sim}24\$ m below the sediment/basalt interface).  

The triple combo tool string was rigged and deployed from 030 0 to $1000~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 August. This tool string measured electrical resistivity, density, porosity, MS, and natural gamma radiation in the formation. The first of two logging passes with the tool string reache d a maximum depth of $305.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline log depth below seafloo r (WSF), where tight hole conditions were encountered.  

The second tool string, including the Dipole Sonic Imager an d Formation MicroScanner (FMS) systems, was deployed from 100 0 to $1545~\mathrm{h}$ . This second tool string was deployed to a maximu m depth of $295.4\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m\,WSF}}$ because of the problems during the first pass.  

The tool string encountered tight hole conditions at $270.4~\mathrm{m}$ WSF, where the calipers had to be temporarily closed to make the tool pass.  

The third tool string included the Versatile Seismic Imager. I t was deployed from 1545 to $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ while maintaining the appropriate marine mammal and protected species observation procedures. Successful recordings were achieved at two depth stations in th e open basement hole.  

The hole was displaced with heavy mud $\mathrm{(10.5\\mathrm{lb/gal)}}$ , and th e end of pipe was raised to $85.4~\mathrm{m}$ DSF in preparation for logging th e sediment section. The triple combo wireline logging tool string wa s rigged up and was being deployed in the early hours of 16 Augus t when at $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ the logging line winch motor failed. Initial troubleshooting indicated that the failure was with one of the motor bearings. The logging line was pulled up using two T-bar clamps until ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ of line were available to be transferred over to the corin g line winch, which was then used to recover the logging tools b y $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

At this point, drilling and coring operations had to be suspende d for safety reasons because a functioning logging winch is require d in case the drill pipe gets stuck and needs to be severed. The drill string was retrieved and cleared the rig floor at $2300\,\mathrm{h},$ ending operations in Hole U1555G. We spent 5.6 days on Hole U1555G.  

# End of Site U1555 operations and Expedition 384  

Shipboard engineers spent 17 August disconnecting and disassembling parts of the failed wireline logging winch motor to asses s its condition. On 18 August, the motor was found not to be repairable on board. This assessment added another 1.4 days to the total time on site for a total of 19.7 days.  

The ship switched from dynamic positioning to cruise mode , and we left Site U1555 at $0812~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 August for the $1174~\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Kristiansand, Norway. We arrived in Kristiansand on 2 4 August. The pilot came on board at $0704\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{r}}$ , and the first line ashor e was at $0839\,\mathrm{h},$ ending Expedition 384.  

# Preliminary results  

# Engineering tests  

Drilling and coring in seven holes at Site U1555 met nearly al l the objectives planned for Expedition 384. The following overvie w is a preliminary assessment, and further analysis will be carried ou t by the bit vendors and JRSO staff.  

Drill bits. The TCI bits deployed in Holes U1555A, U1555C, and U1555E were the best performers, with the highest ROP $[{\sim}4$ $\mathrm{m/h})$ and the best durability. These bits reached the target depth s and were considered reusable after each of the three deployments. The rotational speed did not seem to be a significant factor, at leas t in basalt, based on the ROP comparison in Holes U1555A an d U1555E, which were drilled with and without a mud motor, respectively.  

The traditional (cylindrical) PDC cutters did not perform well . Not surprisingly, nearly all cylindrical cutters on the drill bits (Hole s U1555B and U1555D; Figure F10D, F10F, respectively), the underreamer (Hole U1555C; Figure F11B), and also the coring bit (Hol e U1555F; Figure F11D) returned damaged. The combination of igneous rock, varying weight on bit (WOB), layered formatio n (fresher massive basalt vs. more altered, vesicular, or amygdaloidal basalt), and perhaps the limited rotational speed appears to presen t an insurmountable challenge for these cutters.  

The conical PDC inserts on the PDC bit we used for the firs t time in Hole U1555D fared much better than the cylindrical one s and might point to a path to pursue (Figure F10F). Although th e run for that bit was cut short by the mud motor failure, the bit an d its conical cutters returned in a ready to be rerun condition afte r $20.3\,\mathrm{h}$ on bottom.  

The TCI/PDC hybrid bit (Hole U1555B; Figure F10C, F10D ) did not perform well. Drilling was terminated after only $24.2~\mathrm{m}$ o f basalt penetration because the ROP remained at ${<}1\ \mathrm{m/h}$ over several hours. In addition to the PDC cutters and arms, the cone bearings and the OD showed severe damage. We cannot be certain a t this time whether the carbide jet nozzle that came out contribute d to the problem. However, the totality of the damage suggests tha t this TCI/PDC hybrid bit does not stand up to the demands of th e formation we drilled.  

Our preliminary assessment points to the gauge or OD protection as a critical factor in the harsh igneous rock environment. Thi s was true for the TCI bits that in general performed well and coul d be reused, as well as the TCI/PDC hybrid bit, which was severel y damaged and returned unusable for further drilling. The time-limiting parameter monitored for drill bits is the hours spent on botto m when the hole is being advanced. However, the OD of the bit is i n constant contact with the formation while making connections, circulating off bottom, or performing a short wiper trip. A worn O D leads to a smaller, tapered hole, which puts additional stress on th e bit and can cause coring bit failure, as experienced during Expedition 335. An additional concern is material falling in from the hol e above landing around the top of the bit. For this reason, having  a back-reaming capability is important as well.  

Underreamer. The top-of-the-line underreamer with cutte r blocks used in Hole U1555C arguably worked better than an armtype underreamer would do in this formation. The penetration rat e was a respectable ${\sim}2\ \mathrm{m/h}$ . However, the amount of damage an d wear to the cutter blocks in $^{20\mathrm{~h~}}$ does not render this as a viabl e option for continuous hole opening (Figure F11A, F11B). A cutte r block–type reamer may prove capable of removing ledges in front o f a casing string, however.  

PDC coring bit. The test of our RCB PDC coring bit confirme d that PDC bits are capable of cutting high-quality core pieces, eve n in basalt. However, the ROP and longevity are unacceptably low i n the hard basalt formation. The limited rotational speeds that can b e achieved on JOIDES Resolution may be a contribution factor.  

Other comments. Mud motors are likely too expensive fo r long-term use in deep holes, given the limited run time of ${\sim}125\ \mathrm{h}$ we got with the one motor used. The motor was primarily used t o replicate the rotational speed of the latest generation of top drive s $(120{-}150{+}\,\mathrm{rpm})$ ).  

Adequate heave compensation is critical for bit ROP and durability. The TCI bits used were less affected by the $\pm50\%$ range i n WOB, whereas the WOB variations were likely the major detrimen t in the poor PDC bit performance.  

Hole cleaning, or hydraulics, was purposely minimized as a contributing factor for this testing with the selection of shallow targe t depths. However, the importance of good hole cleaning was demonstrated by the difficulties and eventual termination of drilling i n Holes U1555A and U1555E, the two deepest holes during testing.  

RigWatch, the software that monitors drilling parameters, i s prone to drift producing errors in the depth record for reasons no t yet completely explained. The driller must reset the depth with every connection by up to $20\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , which creates large, vertical offsets i n the depth data and makes postdrilling analysis and interpretatio n difficult. Postprocessing of the data is currently carried out “manually” and therefore is extremely time-consuming and prone to bia s and errors. For example, the operational time spent on connection s and wiper trips had to be removed from the record manually.  

# Support of Expedition 395 objectives  

Coring and sampling. The original coring objective at Sit e U1555 was to obtain a small number of core samples with a regula r RCB coring bit if sampling with the PDC coring bit did not yield an y useful recovery. With significant time becoming available, this objective was expanded to include coring the entire $130\;\mathrm{m}$ basalt section targeted in the Expedition 395 Scientific Prospectus for Sit e U1555. This resulted in the recovery of $59.6~\mathrm{m}$ of basalt from th e $131.2\;\mathrm{m}$ cored section (Table T5; Figure F12).  

The cores consist of massive, (very) fine to medium grained , mostly aphyric, nonvesicular to (sparsely) vesicular or amygdaloidal basalt. Black glassy selvedge on the order of $1\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick are presen t on many rock pieces, likely representing flow unit boundaries. Some intervals are massive and appear fresh, likely representing th e interiors of flow units. Veins and mineralized fracture surfaces ar e among the indicators of alteration, typically in the finer grained an d more vesicular intervals.  

Whole-round and section half images of all cores were sent t o the Expedition 395 science party representatives on shore, wh o marked up selected pilot samples for thin section and chemical analysis. JRSO personnel cut the samples and made thin sections o n board for distribution to the scientists after the expedition. We reserved a few massive and relatively fresh basalt whole-round samples for potential geotechnical testing.  

Logging. A complete set of wireline logs of the basalt sectio n was acquired to complement the incomplete core recovery (Figur e F12). The logs do not cover the entire basalt section; the top of th e section is missing because the pipe had to be placed within the basalt for operational safety, and the bottom of the section is missin g because of the length of the tool strings as well as obstructions encountered near the bottom of the hole. However, the logs provide a n invaluable contiguous record of ${\sim}70{-}90\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt section. Preliminary observations indicate that correlations between borehole diameter based on caliper signals, resistivity, bulk density, $P$ -wav e velocity, and porosity exist. Detailed investigations may find tha t this signature corresponds to particular rock textures, degree of alteration, and deformation.  

Note that the operations report refers to WSF depth, wherea s Figure F12, which is based on the data set processed at the LamontDoherty Earth Observatory Borehole Research Group (LDEOBRG), uses the wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF ) depth scale. The WMSF scale is based on modest depth shifts applied to multiple runs from a tool string. The final WMSF scales fo r the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings appear to be offset b y ${\sim}2\;\mathrm{m}$ relative to one another (Figure F12).
