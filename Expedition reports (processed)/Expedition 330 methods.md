# Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples  

Drilling sites are numbered consecutively from the first site drilled by the D/V Glomar Challenger in 1968. Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 301 began using the prefix ${}^{\prime}\mathrm{U}^{\prime\prime}$ to designate sites occupied by the US Implementing Organization (USIO) vessel (the R/V JOIDES Resolution). For all IODP drill sites, a letter suffix distinguishes each hole drilled at the same site. The first hole drilled is assigned the site number modified by the suffix $^{\prime}\mathrm{A},^{\prime\prime}$ the second hole takes the site number and the suffix $^{\prime}\mathbf{B},^{\prime\prime}$ and so on. Three Expedition 330 sites have only one hole (A). Sites U1375 and U1377 have two holes (A and B).  

The cored interval is measured in meters below seafloor (mbsf). In general, depth below seafloor is determined by subtracting the water depth estimated from the initial drill pipe measurement to the seafloor from the total drill pipe measurement. During Expedition 330, all core depths below seafloor were calculated according to core depth below seafloor Method A (CSF-A) (see “IODP Depth Scales Terminology” at www.iodp.org/programpolicies/). To more easily communicate shipboard results, all depths are reported in this volume as mbsf unless otherwise noted.  

The depth interval assigned to an individual core begins with the depth below seafloor at which coring began and extends to the depth to which coring advanced. Each coring interval is generally ${\sim}9.5\;\mathrm{m}.$ , which is the length of a core barrel; however, coring intervals may be shorter. When applicable, attempts were made during Expedition 330 to core the uppermost soft-sediment succession using a gravity-push technique with little or no rotation of the rotary core barrel assembly. When formation resistance was felt (at varied depths), the core barrel was retrieved before drill string rotation was initiated. In addition, depending on recovery rate and penetration speed in the hard rock portion of the hole, the core barrel was occasionally retrieved after only ${\sim}5\mathrm{~m~}$ of penetration, yielding a half-core.  

Cores taken from a hole are numbered sequentially from the top of the hole downward. Core numbers and their associated cored intervals are unique in a given hole. Generally, maximum recovery for a single core is $9.5\textrm{m}$ of rock or sediment contained in a plastic liner ( $_{6.6\;\mathrm{cm}}$ internal diameter) plus an additional ${\sim}0.2\;\mathrm{m}$ in the core catcher, which is a device at the bottom of the core barrel that prevents the core from sliding out when the barrel is retrieved from the hole. In certain situations, recovery may exceed the $9.5\textrm{m}$ maximum. In soft sediments this is normally caused by core expansion resulting from depressurization. In hard rock cores this typically occurs when a pedestal of rock fails to break off and is grabbed by the core barrel of the subsequent core.  

Recovered cores are divided into $1.5\textrm{m}$ sections that are numbered serially from the top downward. When full recovery is obtained, the sections are numbered 1–7, with the last section usually being ${<}1.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Rarely, an unusually long core may require more than seven sections. When the recovered core is shorter than the cored interval, by convention the top of the core is deemed to be located at the top of the cored interval for the purpose of calculating (consistent) depths. When coring hard rocks, all pieces recovered are placed immediately adjacent to each other in the core tray. Samples and descriptions of cores are designated by distance, measured in centimeters from the top of the section to the top and bottom of each sample or interval. By convention, hard rock material recovered from the core catcher is placed below the last section. In sedimentary cores, the core catcher section is treated as a separate section $(^{\prime\prime}{\mathrm{CC^{\prime\prime}}})$ . When the only recovered material is in the core catcher, it is placed at the top of the cored interval.  

A complete identification number for a sample consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, piece number (hard rock only), and interval in centimeters measured from the top of the section. For example, a sample identification of $^{\prime}330{\mathrm{-U}}1372{\mathrm{A}}{\mathrm{-}}26{\mathrm{R}}{\mathrm{-}}3$ (Piece $5,\;40{-}47\ \mathrm{cm})^{\prime\prime}$ indicates a $7\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ long sample of Piece 5 taken from the interval between 40 and $47~\mathrm{{cm}}$ below the top of Section 3 of Core 26 ( $\mathrm{^{\prime\prime}R^{\prime\prime}}$ means this core was taken with the rotary core barrel assembly) in Hole A at Site U1372 during Expedition 330. All cores were drilled with the rotary core barrel assembly during Expedition 330.  

# Core handling  

All cores recovered during Expedition 330 were extracted from the core barrel in plastic liners. These liners were carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwalk outside the core laboratory. Hard rock pieces were pushed to the bottom of the liner, and total rock length was measured by the curator on the catwalk. The length was entered into the database as “created length” using the Sample Master application. This number was used to calculate recovery. The plastic liner was then cut into ${\sim}1.5\ \mathrm{m}$ sections. Liner caps were placed at both ends of each section (blue $=$ top end, colorless $=$ bottom end).  

The $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections were transferred to the core splitting room. For soft sediment, the plastic liners were split lengthwise to expose the core. Hard rock core pieces were slid out of the liners and placed in order in new, clean sections of core liner that had previously been split in half. Pieces having a vertical length greater than the internal (horizontal) diameter of the core liner are considered oriented pieces because they could have rotated only around their vertical axes. Those pieces were immediately marked on the bottom with a red wax pencil to preserve their vertical (upward) orientations. Pieces that were too small to be oriented with certainty were left unmarked. Adjacent but broken core pieces that could be fit together along fractures were curated as single pieces. The structural geologist on shift confirmed the piece matches and corrected any errors. The structural geologist also marked a split line on the pieces, which defined how the pieces should be cut into two equal halves. The aim was to maximize the expression of dipping structures on the cut face of the core while maintaining representative features in both archive and working halves.  

Microbiology samples from soft sediment were taken as whole-round samples on the catwalk by cutting a ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{cm}$ piece of liner from the end of the core, just above the core catcher. For hard rocks, whole-round samples were taken in the splitting room immediately after the core was slid from the liner. The petrologist on duty monitored the microbiology sampling to ensure that no critical petrographic interval was depleted. All microbiology whole-round samples were photographed from both sides.  

After microbiology sampling was completed, a plastic spacer was secured with acetone to the split core liner between individual pieces or reconstructed contiguous groups of subpieces (hard rock sections only). These spacers may represent a substantial interval of no recovery. The length of each section of core, including spacers, was then entered as “curated length” into the curation database. Curated length commonly differs by a few to several centimeters from the created length measured on the catwalk (depending on the number of pieces/spacers). Accordingly, the assumed depth of each piece is recalculated in the database on the basis of curated length, and all further observations and measurements are taken against this recalculated depth.  

Each section was allowed to equilibrate for ${\sim}3\,\mathrm{~h~}$ to ambient room temperature before being scanned using the shipboard Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (see “Physical properties”). The whole-round core sections  were  next  measured  with  the  Natural  

Gamma Radiation Logger (see “Physical properties”). Each piece of core was then split with a diamond-impregnated saw (for hard rocks) into an archive half and a working half, with the positions of plastic spacers between individual pieces maintained in both halves of the plastic liner. Pieces were numbered sequentially from the top of each section. Separate subpieces within a single piece were assigned the same number but were lettered consecutively (e.g., 1A, 1B, 1C). Pieces were labeled only on the outer cylindrical surfaces of the core. If it was evident that an individual piece had not rotated around a horizontal axis during drilling, an arrow pointing to the top of the section was added to the label. The oriented character of the piece was then recorded in the database using the Sample Master application.  

Digital images of the dry, cut faces of the archive halves were captured with the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL). Images were taken with a line scan camera at intervals of 20 pixels/mm. Measurements of point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance were performed with the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) on the archive halves. This instrument also includes a laser calibration system. Laser data (e.g., locations of core gaps and rubble intervals) were used to aid data filtering of the multisensor measurements (see “Physical properties”).  

The archive half of each core (soft sediment or hard rock) was described for lithologic, sedimentologic, magmatic, and volcanic features, and structural observations and alteration characteristics were noted. All observations were recorded in the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database using the descriptive data capture application DESClogik. Specialized templates and spreadsheets were developed for this application by the individual descriptive laboratory groups (for details, see individual disciplinary sections in this chapter).  

Finally, digital color close-up images (both from dry and wet surfaces) were taken of particular features of the archive or working halves, as requested by individual scientists. During the crossover between night and day shifts, a sample meeting was held at $1200\;\mathrm{h}$ to discuss the sections described and to select key sampling intervals for shipboard analysis. Discrete samples were taken from working halves for shipboard physical property, paleomagnetic, thin section,  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD),  and  geochemical analyses (e.g., inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy [ICP-AES]), as described in the sections below. Nondestructive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses were also conducted on the working halves using a portable XRF instrument (see details in “Geochemistry”). Each sample was logged into the Sample Master application by location, sample type, and intended shipboard study (e.g., thin section, XRD, XRF, etc.). Paleomagnetic measurements with stepwise alternating-field demagnetization were conducted on oriented archive-half pieces (approved by the curator) to guide (and thereby minimize) paleomagnetic discrete sampling of the working halves.  The  microbiology  whole-round  samples taken on the catwalk (sediment) or in the splitting room (hard rock) were used both for shipboard and personal postcruise studies (see details in “Microbiology”). Residual material was returned to the curator and made available for additional shipboard or personal sampling.  

Records of all removed samples are kept by the IODP curator. Sampling for personal postcruise research was conducted during several sampling parties over the course of the expedition. At the end of Expedition 330, all cores were transferred from the ship for permanent storage at the IODP Gulf Coast Repository in College Station, Texas (USA).  

# Sedimentology  

The lithology of the sediment recovered during Expedition 330 was primarily determined using observations based on visual (macroscopic) core description, thin sections, and smear slides. In some cases digital core imaging, color reflectance spectrophotometry, and magnetic susceptibility analysis provided complementary  discriminative  information.  The methods employed during this expedition were similar to those used during IODP Expedition 324 (Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010) to Shatsky Rise. Expedition 330 used the DESClogik application to record and upload descriptive data into the LIMS database (see DESClogik user guide), which was first implemented during IODP Expedition 320T (Expedition 320T Scientists, 2009). Three spreadsheet templates were set up in DESClogik and customized for Expedition 330 before the first core arrived on deck. The spreadsheet templates were used to record macroscopic sedimentologic core descriptions and data from smear slides and thin sections, which were used to quantify the texture and relative abundance of biogenic and nonbiogenic components. The locations of all smear slide and thin section samples taken from each core were recorded in the Sample Master application. Descriptive data uploaded to the LIMS database were also used to produce visual core description (VCD) standard graphic reports.  

# Visual core descriptions  

After descriptions of the cores were uploaded into the central LIMS database, the data were used to produce VCDs, which include a simplified graphical representation of the core (per section) with accompanying descriptions of the features observed (Figs. F1, F2). Depending on the type of material drilled, two VCDs were sometimes produced for the same section: one to describe sediment or sedimentary rocks and the other to describe igneous features.  

Site, hole, and depth in mbsf, calculated according to the CSF-A depth scale, are given at the top of each VCD, with depth of core sections indicated along the left margin. Observations of the physical description of the core correspond to entries in DESClogik, including grain size, bioturbation intensity, fossils, ichnofossils, lithologic accessories, sedimentary structures, and drilling disturbance. Symbols used in the VCDs are given in Figure F2. Additionally, sedimentary VCDs display magnetic susceptibility, color reflectance, paleontological observations, and the locations of samples taken for shipboard measurements. Section summary text provides a generalized overview of the core section’s lithology and features. This summary text and individual columns shown on the VCDs are described below in greater detail, followed by an outline of the lithostratigraphic classification used during Expedition 330.  

# Section summary  

A brief overview of major and minor lithologies present in the section, as well as notable features (e.g., sedimentary structures) and the composition of basalt clasts (if present), is presented in the section summary text field at the top of the VCDs. The summary includes sediment color determined qualitatively using Munsell soil color charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2000). Because sediment color may evolve during drying and subsequent oxidization, color was described shortly after the cores were split and imaged or measured by the SHIL and SHMSL.  

# Section-half image  

The high-resolution scans of each core section (at 20 pixels/ $\mathbf{\dot{mm}},$ ) made by the SHIL are included to provide a continuous image of the whole section.  

# Graphic lithology  

The lithology of the recovered core is represented on the VCDs by graphic patterns. See Figure F2 for an explanation of patterns used during Expedition 330.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

When recovery and core length permitted, the magnetic susceptibility of both whole rounds and split sections of the core was measured, which roughly indicates the concentration of magnetic minerals. A filter was applied to remove spurious data related to gaps between broken pieces of the hard rock cores (see “Physical properties”). Both filtered and raw data are shown on the VCDs.  

# Color reflectance spectrophotometry  

Color reflectance spectrophotometry of visible light (“Reflectance” in the VCDs) was routinely measured on archive halves of sediment (and hard rock) cores using the SHMSL, which was equipped with OceanOptics software for analysis of color reflectance data (see details in “Physical properties”). Cores consisting of soft sediment were covered with clear plastic wrap and then placed on the SHMSL. Hard rock sections were run without the protective plastic cover. Measurements were taken at 1 cm spacing. The SHMSL is set to skip empty intervals in the core liner, but it cannot recognize relatively small cracks, disturbed areas of cores, or plastic section dividers. Thus, raw SHMSL data may contain spurious measurements. Therefore, during postprocessing a filter was applied to the reflective data set (see “Physical properties”). Both filtered and unfiltered data are shown on the VCDs.  

# Grain size  

The Grain size column displays sediment grain size as a block chart. The dominant grain size is represented numerically for each lithologic interval using a range of 1–6:  

$1=$ clay size $(<\!3.9\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ .   
${\displaystyle2=}$ silt size $(3.9{-}62.5\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ .   
$3=$ very fine to fine sand size $(>62.5{-}250\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ ).   
$4=$ medium to very coarse sand size $(>\!250\,\upmu\mathrm{m}\!-\!2$ mm).   
$5=$ granule to cobble size $(>\!2{-}256\ \mathrm{mm})$ ).   
$6=$ boulder size $(>\!256\;\mathrm{mm})$ ).  

Because the bulk of the sediment observed during Expedition 330 is composed of basalt breccia and volcanic sandstone, the size of detrital grains in coarse-grained sediment was estimated during visual description of the cores by measuring the largest grain size per $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ interval. Grains overlapping several intervals were measured only once. Also, the roundness of grains was estimated on the basis of the average roundness of the largest grains in each $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ interval for each lithology. Six categories of roundness were defined with the help of a visual comparison chart (Shepard and Young, 1961): very angular, angular, subangular, subrounded, rounded, and well rounded (no measurement of roundness was made for clasts ${<}1\ \mathrm{\mm})$ ). These measurements are not shown on the VCDs but are available in supplementary tables (see SIZE in SEDIMENT in “Supplementary material”) and are displayed in stratigraphic summary figures in each site chapter. The average maximum grain size of coarse-grained sediments is available in LIMS.  

# Bioturbation intensity  

The degree of bioturbation was determined by observing how intensely the sediments were altered by the action of organisms (Droser and Bottjer, 1986). The following categories were used to describe degree of bioturbation:  

Intense (ichnofabric index 5 and 6): $60\%{-}100\%$ of original bedding disturbed.   
Moderate (ichnofabric index 3 and 4): $10\%{-}60\%$ of original bedding disturbed.   
Minor (ichnofabric index 1 and 2): $0\%{-}10\%$ of original bedding disturbed.  

The Bioturbation column was left blank for intervals composed of volcaniclastic sediments.  

# Fossils/Ichnofossils  

Identifiable fossils (or fossil fragments) and trace fossils (ichnofossils) are identified in the Fossils/Ichnofossils column.  

# Sedimentary structures  

Structures resulting from physical sedimentary processes are represented in the Sedimentary structures column. Identified features include laminations and cross-bedding, contacts between sediment of differing lithologies, and any soft-sediment deformation structures.  

# Lithologic accessories  

Some postdepositional features (e.g., ferromanganese encrustations) and grains of interest (e.g., pumice and coated grains) are recorded in the Lithologic accessories column.  

# Drilling disturbance  

The Drilling disturbance column indicates the mode and type of disturbance (e.g., flow-in or fall-in) caused by the drilling process. The degree of disturbance within soft sediment is characterized using the nomenclature of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 180 (Taylor, Huchon, Klaus, et al., 2000):  

Slightly disturbed: bedding contacts are slightly deformed. Moderately  disturbed:  bedding  contacts  have undergone extreme bowing. Highly disturbed: bedding is completely deformed as flow-in and other soft stretching and/or compressional shearing structures attributed to coring/ drilling.  

Soupy: intervals are water saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
The degree of fracturing within indurated sediments   
is described using the following categories:   
• Slightly fractured: core pieces are in place and broken.   
• Moderately fractured: core pieces are in place or partly displaced, but original orientation is preserved or recognizable. Highly fractured: core pieces are probably in correct stratigraphic sequence, but original orientation is lost. Drilling breccia: core is crushed and broken into many small and angular pieces, with original orientation and stratigraphic position lost.  

# Age  

The nannofossil or foraminiferal zone that defines the age of the sediments was provided by the shipboard biostratigraphers (see “Paleontology”) and is listed in the Age column.  

# Samples  

The exact positions of samples used for microscopic descriptions (i.e., smear slides and thin sections), biochronological  determinations,  and  shipboard analysis of chemical and physical properties of the sediments are recorded in the Samples column.  

# Sediment classification  

Lithologic names, including sediment composition, degree of lithification, and texture, are based mostly on conventions outlined by Mazzullo et al. (1988) in the ODP sediment classification scheme (Fig. F3). The term “mixed sediment” was not used during Expedition 330 because thin-bedded lithologic variations did not occur. Pelagic sediments are defined as ${>}50\%$ pelagic and neritic components and ${<}50\%$ siliciclastic  and  volcaniclastic  components,  with  a higher proportion of pelagic than neritic components. Neritic sediments, on the other hand, are defined as ${>}50\%$ pelagic and neritic components and ${<}50\%$ siliciclastic and volcaniclastic components, with a higher proportion of neritic than pelagic components. Siliciclastic sediments are defined as ${>}50\%$ siliciclastic and volcaniclastic components and ${<}50\%$ neritic and pelagic components, with a higher proportion of siliciclastic than volcaniclastic components. Finally, volcaniclastic sediments are defined as ${>}50\%$ siliciclastic and volcaniclastic components and ${<}50\%$ neritic and pelagic components, with a higher proportion of volcaniclastic than siliciclastic components.  

The nomenclature includes a principal name based on the composition of the major lithology, preceded by major modifiers (in order of increasing abundance) that refer to components making up at least $25\%$ of the sediments. The principal name is followed by minor modifiers for components forming between $10\%$ and $25\%$ of the sediments, in order of increasing abundance. In clastic deposits, components refer to clasts and do not include the matrix. For example, a well-indurated breccia sample containing $40\%$ basalt, $35\%$ bioclasts, $20\%$ cement, and $5\%$ foraminifers would be described as a “bioclast basalt breccia.” The principal name (breccia, in the preceding example) is displayed in the Graphic lithology column of the VCDs with a general descriptive prefix (e.g., volcanic), whereas major and minor components are available from the LIMS database or section summaries of the VCDs. The term “sandy foraminiferal ooze” is applied to the youngest sediments encountered during Expedition 330, which likely represent a winnowed residue of foraminiferal ooze originally richer in nannofossils.  

The subclassification of volcaniclastic sediments followed here differs from the standard ODP classification (Mazzullo et al., 1988) in that we adopted a descriptive (nongenetic) terminology similar to that employed during ODP Leg 197 and Expedition 324 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002; Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010). Unless an unequivocally pyroclastic origin for volcanogenic particles could be determined, we simply described deposits composed of these materials as being of volcanic provenance according to the classification scheme for clastic sediments, noting the dominance of volcanic grains (e.g., volcanic sandstone). We followed the clastic textural classification of Wentworth (1922) to separate the various volcanic sediment types and sedimentary rocks (according to grain size) into volcanic gravel $(>\!2\;\mathrm{mm})$ , volcanic sand $(2{\mathrm{~mm}}{-}62.5{\mathrm{~}}{\upmu}{\mathrm{m}})$ ), volcanic silt $(62.5{-}3.9\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and volcanic clay $(<\!3.9\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ . For coarse-grained, poorly sorted volcaniclastic sediments rich in basalt clasts, such as those produced by gravity currents, we applied the terms “basalt breccia”  (angular  clasts)  or  “basalt  conglomerate” (rounded clasts) and used lithologic or structural modifiers for further description.  

Where evidence for a pyroclastic origin was compelling, we adopted the classification scheme of Fisher and Schmincke (1984). In these instances we used the grain-size terms “volcanic blocks” $\left>64\;\mathrm{mm}\right>$ , “lapilli/lapillistone” $(2{-}64\ \mathrm{~mm})$ ),  and  “ash/tuff”  ( $\scriptstyle<2$ mm). The term “hyaloclastite” was used for vitroclastic (i.e., glassy) materials produced by the interaction of  water  and  hot  magma  or  lava  (Fisher  and Schmincke, 1984). The term “peperite” was applied to a rock formed essentially in situ by disintegration of magma intruding and mingling with unconsolidated or poorly consolidated, typically wet, sediments. The term also refers to similar mixtures generated  by  the  same  processes  operating  at  the contacts of lavas and other hot volcaniclastic deposits with such sediments (Skilling et al., 2002).  

# Smear slide observation  

Smear slides are useful for identifying and reporting basic sediment attributes (texture and composition) in soft sediments, but the results are not quantitative. Similar to the procedure applied during IODP Expedition 315, we estimated the abundances of biogenic, volcaniclastic, and siliciclastic constituents with the help of a visual comparison chart (Rothwell, 1989). Errors can be large, however, especially for fine silt- and clay-size fractions, and reproducibility among different sedimentologists is expected to be poor. Smear slide analysis also tends to underestimate the amount of sand-size grains because they are difficult to incorporate evenly onto the slide. Thus, it would be misleading to report values as absolute percentages. Instead, our descriptive results are tabulated as visual percentage estimates in the LIMS database, with values grouped into the following broad range of categories:  

$\textrm{D}=$ dominant $(>\!50\%)$ .   
$\mathrm{~A~}=$ abundant $(>\!20\%{-50\%})$ ).   
${\mathrm{C}}={\mathrm{common}}$ $(>\!5\%{-}20\%)$ .   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~P~}~}=$ present $(>\!1\%-5\%)$ .   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~R~}~}=$ rare $(0.1\%{-}1\%)$ .   
${\mathrm{~\textit~{~T~}~}}=$ trace $(<\!0.1\%)$ .  

# Semiquantitative $\pmb{\Upsilon}$ -ray fluorescence analysis  

Semiquantitative XRF analysis using a portable XRF spectrometer was applied for some sedimentary intervals, such as ferromanganese encrustation and phosphatized limestone (see “Geochemistry”; see also XL3_EVAL.PDF in XRF in “Supplementary material”).  

# Paleontology  

Preliminary age assignments were based on calcareous microfossils (nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers) in core catcher samples, with additional samples from core sections, as required. The Quaternary, Neogene, and Paleogene timescale constructed for IODP Expedition 320/321 was used for this study (Expedition  320/321  Scientists,  2010).  Biostratigraphic events were correlated to the geomagnetic polarity timescale, which is based on a composite of several timescales (Cande and Kent, 1995; Lourens et al., 2004; Pälike et al., 2006) (Fig. F4A–F4D). The timescales of Gradstein et al. (1995) and Channell et al. (1995) were applied for the early Paleocene (older than $60\,\mathrm{Ma},$ ) and Late Cretaceous (Fig. F4E). Preservation, abundance, and zonal assignments for each microfossil group were entered into the LIMS database via DESClogik software.  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Calcareous nannofossils were examined in smear slides prepared with standard microscope slides and coverslips and mounted with Norland optical adhesive. Slides were observed using standard light microscope techniques on a Zeiss Axiophot with crossed polarizers and transmitted light at $1000\times$ magnification. Following the methods used during ODP Leg 144, the zonation of Okada and Bukry (1980) was used during Expedition 330 for Cenozoic calcareous nannofossils (Table T1, modified from Expedition 320/321 Scientists, 2010). In the upper Cretaceous the zonation of Sissingh (1977) was applied (Table T2, modified from Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004). Taxonomy follows that of Bowen (1998) and PerchNielsen (1985), where full taxonomic lists can be found.  

Estimates of the abundance of calcareous nannofossils were determined as follows:  

$\textrm{D}=$ dominant ${\sqrt{>}}100$ specimens per field of view).   
$\mathrm{~A~}=$ abundant ${>}10{-}100$ specimens per field of view).   
$C\,=$ common (1–10 specimens per field of view).   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~F~}~}=$ few (1 specimen per 1–10 fields of view).   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~R~}~}=$ rare $\langle<\!1$ specimen per 10 fields of view).   
$\textbf{B}=$ barren.  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils was classified as follows:  

${\mathrm{VG}}=$ very good (no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization, no alteration of primary morphological characteristics, and all specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~G~}~}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics only slightly altered, and specimens identifiable to the species level).   
M $=$ moderate (some etching and/or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics somewhat altered, and most specimens identifiable to the species level).   
P $=$ poor (severe etching or overgrowth, primary morphological characteristics largely destroyed, fragmentation has occurred, and  

specimens often unidentifiable at the species and/or generic level).  

# Planktonic foraminifers  

The planktonic foraminiferal zonal scheme used for the Cenozoic follows Berggren et al. (1995), except for the Eocene and Oligocene, which are based on Berggren and Pearson (2005). The mid–late Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary age estimates (0–60 Ma) used in this study follow those used during Expedition 320/321 (Expedition 320/321 Scientists, 2010). Those ages and sources are listed in Table T3. The zonation used for Cretaceous planktonic foraminifers is based on the zonal schemes of Caron (1985), Sliter (1989), and Robaszynski and Caron (1995). The early Paleogene $(>\!60\,\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and Late Cretaceous age estimates, obtained from Erba et al. (1995), Bralower et al. (1997), and Premoli Silva and Sliter (1999), are based on those used during ODP Leg 207 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004) (Tables T3, T4).  

Cenozoic taxonomic concepts used selectively follow those of Kennett and Srinivasan (1983), Bolli and Saunders (1985), Toumarkine and Luterbacher (1985), Loeblich and Tappan (1988), Spezzaferri and Premoli Silva (1991), Chaisson and Leckie (1993), Leckie  et  al.  (1993),  Spezzaferri  (1994),  Pearson (1995), Chaisson and Pearson (1997), Pearson and Chaisson (1997), and Pearson et al. (2006). Cretaceous taxonomic concepts used are based on Robaszynski  and  Caron  (1979), Robaszynski  et  al. (1984), Caron (1985), Nederbragt (1991), and Petrizzo (2000).  

Foraminifers from ooze were spray-washed over a $63\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve. Semilithified ooze and chalk were first partly fragmented by hand and then soaked in a $3\%$ solution of hydrogen peroxide $\textstyle(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2})$ before washing. Hard chalk and limestone were pounded with a hammer into pea-size fragments and boiled on a hot plate for $1{-}2\,\mathrm{\min}$ in a $3\%$ $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ solution. Species identification for planktonic foraminifers was made on ${>}250\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ and ${>}150\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions for the Neogene and Paleogene–Cretaceous, respectively.  

The following group abundance categories were estimated from visual examination of the dried sample for foraminiferal group abundance:  

$\mathrm{~A~}=$ abundant $(>\!50\%)$ .   
$C=$ common $(>\!25\%{-}50\%)$ ).   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~F~}~}=$ few $(\mathrm{>}10\%{-}25\%)$ .   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~R~}~}=$ rare $(1\%{-}10\%)$ .   
${\mathrm{~\textit~{~T~}~}}=$ trace (only a few broken specimens).   
$\textbf{B}=$ barren (no specimens).  

The following species abundance categories were used for foraminiferal species abundance: $\textrm{D}=$ dominant $(>\!30\%)$ .  

$\mathrm{~A~}=$ abundant $(>\!10\%{-}30\%)$ ).   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~F~}~}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%)$ .   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~R~}~}=$ rare $(1\%{-}5\%)$ .   
$\mathrm{~\bf~P~}=$ present $(<\!1\%)$ .  

The preservation status of planktonic foraminifers was estimated as follows:  

${\mathrm{VG}}=$ very good (no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
$\mathrm{~\textit~{~G~}~}=\mathrm{good}$ (little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
$\textrm{\textbf{M}}=$ moderate (calcite overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion are common but minor).   
$\mathrm{~\textbf~{~P~}~}=\mathrm{poor}$ (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).  

In many cases during Expedition 330, foraminifers from consolidated sediments were also examined in thin section. Species identification was made only for axially sectioned specimens, whereas general morphologies were described for all other individuals. Group abundance, species abundance, and preservation were not recorded for thin section analyses.  

# Igneous petrology and volcanology  

The procedures for core description outlined here are essentially those used during Expedition 324 to Shatsky Rise (Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010). The goal of our shipboard studies was to produce an integrated picture of each drill site’s style of volcanism and environmental setting. This goal was achieved by systematically describing rocks and identifying key effusive, volcaniclastic, and igneous textures known to be diagnostic of specific modern physical volcanic processes. Physical description of the volcanic rocks and deposits recovered during Expedition 330 required a multistage process. First, lithologic  unit  boundaries  were  defined  by  visual identification of actual lithologic contacts or by inference of such contacts using observed changes in composition (e.g., phenocryst assemblages), volcanic characteristics, or volcaniclastic features. Then, lithology, phenocrysts, lithologic variation, and characteristic igneous textures and vesicle distributions were described. Finally, these macroscopic observations were combined with those from detailed thin section petrographic studies of key igneous units.  

# Physical characteristics of volcanic units Subaerial lava eruptions  

# A‘a lava flows  

A‘a flows are characterized by angular, spinose clinker at both flow tops and bottoms, in contrast to pahoehoe and pillow flows, which are often characterized by smooth surfaces and clear contacts between successive or adjacent units. Internal disruption during emplacement permits efficient degassing, and the crust, core, and base of a‘a flows are typically sparsely vesicular or nonvesicular. Transitional flow types (e.g., rubbly, slab, or toothpaste pahoehoe; Guilbaud et al., 2005) show some of the characteristics of both pahoehoe- and $\mathsf{a}^{\prime}\mathsf{a}$ -type flows.  

# Pahoehoe lava flows  

Pahoehoe flows are usually vesicular, often highly so, and can exhibit bulk porosities in excess of 20 $\mathrm{vol\%}$ (typical range $=20–60\ \mathrm{vol\%}$ . Thin pahoehoe lobes $(<\!0.5{-}1\ \mathrm{m})$ are often vesicular throughout and exhibit gradual coarsening in vesicle size from the lobe margins toward the interior (Wilmoth and Walker, 1993). During development of subaerial pahoehoe lava fields, gas bubbles can frequently become trapped and entrained in the magma body as it cools from both above and below. Thus, thicker inflated pahoehoe lobes, such as those documented in continental flood basalt provinces, are often characterized by a threefold structure of vesicular upper crust, dense core, and thinner vesicular lower crust (Aubele et al., 1988; Thordarson and Self, 1998). Very close morphological similarity exists between pahoehoe lava formed on land and pillow lava formed under water, though the former typically lacks, or else has only relatively thin, glassy rinds (i.e., glassy surface selvages).  

# Subaqueous lava flows  

Subaqueous lava flows and hyaloclastite associations have been documented where flows from land-based eruptions entered water (e.g., into seas or freshwater lakes) or else erupted in shallow-submarine situations (e.g., ongoing eruption from $\mathrm{Pu^{\prime}u\ O^{\prime}o}$ , Hawaii; Surtsey eruptions of 1963–1967; and around the coasts of the Azores). On entering water or soft unconsolidated sediments, the eruptive style changes fundamentally, and depending on local conditions advancement of the lava front typically generates pillow basalt, hyaloclastites, or peperites (or any combination of these three). Hyaloclastites and peperites are volcaniclastic sediments that form by quench fragmentation (Carlisle, 1963). Pillow basalts are a common product of these environments and can usually be distinguished from pahoehoe flows by their much thicker glassy rinds (a consequence of more efficient aqueous quenching) and by the presence of lacustrine/marine sediments preserved between the pillows. However, although less frequently documented, larger subaqueous flows may also be massive and sheetlike if the local flow rate is high enough, as determined by slope and eruption rate (Walker, 1992; Gregg and Fink, 1995).  

# Submarine lava eruptions  

# Pillow lava flows  

Pillow lavas are subaqueous extrusions resulting from individual budding, inflation, and separation of lava pods from point sources along the advancing lava front. They can accumulate in a variety of styles depending  on  effusion  rate,  number  of  point sources, and internal plumbing architectures within the growing volcanic edifice. However, pillow lavas typically consist of discrete subrounded units of relatively small size ${\sim}0.2–1.0\,\mathrm{m}$ diameter). Characteristically, their exteriors are entirely bounded by glassy rinds as a result of rapid cooling, and their interiors typically  display  internally  radiating  vesicle  and joint patterns.  

# Lobate lava flows  

Larger lobate flows or flow lobes $_{\sim1-2\mathrm{~m~}}$ diameter) can also develop by the same endogenous inflation process as pillow lava flows. Although these extrusions broadly resemble pillow lavas, they differ in that they have massive, coarser grained, and sparsely vesicular cores, often with pipe vesicle domains. Because their larger size permits a slower rate of cooling, these inflation units are characterized by more effective degassing and maturation of internal vesicle patterns. Accordingly, vesicle zoning is more concentrated in the upper regions of the inflation unit and often occurs as a series of vesicle bands that develops through the inward migration of the cooling front. By contrast, the lower part of the inflation unit typically contains either sparse, poorly defined vesicle banding or teardrop-shaped vesicles at, or just above, the basal chill zone. Rather than being spherical or subspherical, these massive inflation units tend to have flattened, oblate, or tubular shapes and are most probably generated as a series of interconnected, semiadjacent inflation units fed simultaneously by internal plumbing. Their size and morphology are considered to be indicative of higher effusion rates than those that generate pillow lavas. Individual units can cover an area of several square meters (or significantly more where adjacent units merge either through internal plumbing or as a result of rupture and coalescence). In those instances where they merge into a single entity, they appear as a lava flow displaying a dominantly botryoidal surface morphology. Recognizing lobate flows in drill core is often very difficult or impossible, especially in the thick volcaniclastic successions drilled during Expedition 330. The terms “lava fragment” or “flow lobe” were used for ${>}30~\mathrm{cm}$ thick continuous intervals of basalt when features diagnostic of lobate flows were lacking.  

# Massive basaltic lava flows  

Massive basaltic lava flows form thick (several meters or more), laterally extensive sheetlike units (van Andel and Ballard, 1979). They have a variety of surface features generated by deformation and disturbance of the solidifying lava crust while in a plastic/semiplastic state. In dimension and internal features they can resemble larger subaerially erupted flows. This type of flow may be fed by lava tubes and develop by internal inflation or marginal budding. These flows often have texturally uniform massive cores as thick as several meters, are characterized by sparse vesicle layering, or have vertical vesicle pipes containing late-stage  melt  segregation  material.  Massive  or sheetlike flows may be a response to particularly high effusion rates or local slope and other controlling topographic conditions. These unit types have been called “sheet flows” in previous ODP and IODP reports, although this term implies a lateral extent that cannot be determined from core alone. Nevertheless, where recovered, these units are significantly thicker than the normal $({\sim}0.2–2\,\textrm{m})$ dimensions of pillow lava or lobate flows observed in drill cores.  

# Volcaniclastic deposits  

Volcaniclastic deposits include a range of materials from rubbly, in situ volcanic debris to resedimented material such as volcanic sand and gravel. Volcanic material of all sizes may be a direct product of eruptive processes (pyroclastic) or an accumulation of processes involving transport, sorting, and deposition (epiclastic). Pyroclastic activity includes hydrovolcanic deposits formed by explosive interaction between magma and water, as well as nonexplosive quench fragmentation processes (e.g., hyaloclastite and peperite).  

# Hyaloclastite  

Hyaloclastite literally means “glass-fragment rock” and includes all glassy fragmental debris formed by eruptions involving water. Environments of hyaloclastite production relevant to the Louisville Seamounts may include shallow-water phreatomagmatic eruptions when the seamounts were emergent volcanic islands and, most probably, volcaniclastic materials associated with the development and advancement  of  submarine  lavas  at  greater  water depths (Clague et al., 2009). Phreatomagmatic conditions can result in the fragmentation of gas bubbles inflated by steam, producing thick layers of glass shards that may be sent into subaerial trajectories or else form suspended plumes within the water column. In either case, they then settle upon the surrounding land or seafloor surface (i.e., on newly formed volcanic material) or are transported and redeposited elsewhere. Depending on the nature of the eruption, welded and unwelded volcanic rubble and breccia may also occur in these environments (Fisher and Schmincke, 1984). Submarine lavas are almost invariably associated with hyaloclastites and a variety of other fragmental volcanic debris, including breccia (Staudigel and Schmincke, 1984; Batiza and White, 2000). Hyaloclastite is common on seamounts, where it may be the product of cooling contraction granulation and surficial spalling of lava flows. Seamounts are also characterized by volcanic breccia and are commonly associated with mass debris flows, especially where the eruption occurs on significant seafloor topography.  

# Peperite  

Peperite is a distinct volcanic sediment facies occurring where subaqueous basaltic lava flows interact with unconsolidated sediment as they erupt into water bodies on land or, more commonly, on the seafloor (Skilling et al., 2002). The mingling of basaltic lava and wet sediment produces distinct volcanic textures resulting from the physical interaction of lava and sediment (entrainment, baking, chilling, etc.), as well as physical and chemical fragmentation and alteration through steam-rock interaction during flash heating of the water. Common features include quenched lava flow margins of basaltic clasts surrounded by sediment, as well as basaltic clasts with a variety of fragment morphologies, including fluidal  (e.g.,  where  fragments  remained  plastic enough to deform after deposition) or jigsaw-fit (e.g., where fragments cracked apart in situ, forming blocky peperite). The presence and texture of peperite may provide important information regarding the nature of the eruptive environment. Importantly, the occurrence of peperite provides evidence that the volcanism and affected sedimentary environment existed contemporaneously.  

Other lava-sediment interactions include features involving the mixing or mingling of molten or plastic lava with sediment (e.g., where lava injects or intrudes into a substrate). In some instances, there is a lack of bedding or lamination in sediment adjacent to pillow lavas or the material surrounding lava injections. A likely explanation is fluidization of the fine-grained sediment, attributable to flash heating and vaporization of sediment pore water during emplacement of the pillow lava (Kokelaar, 1982). Such momentary fluidization causes sediment reconstitution,  localized  transport,  and  redistribution  and hence the destruction of any inherent bedding structures.  

# Definition of lithologic units and volcanic successions  

In recording our observations of the drill core, it was important to avoid nomenclature or terminologies that imply particular styles of basaltic volcanism. Most lava type classifications are based on field observations that consider both lateral and vertical variations of eruptive units and their stacking relationships. Such refined classifications are neither realistic nor justifiable from core observation alone and can only become achievable when additional petrographic,  geochemical, or  downhole logging data  are  available.  In  most  instances,  only  the smaller volcanic unit divisions (i.e., individual cooling units) can be identified in core material, so these are necessarily the basic units of description.  

# Descriptive nomenclature  

# Volcanic succession  

To aid efficient core description and enable later collation of the observed volcanic elements into volcanically meaningful successions, we adopted a simple twofold numerical hierarchy. First, to define lithologic units we looked for lava contacts, chilled margins or identifiable flow tops, changes in phenocryst populations, vesicle distributions, and intercalated volcaniclastic or sedimentary horizons. When considered together, these features typically define the key volcanic cooling, inflation, and depositional units of various sizes and the scales within the eruptive succession. Lithologic units are given consecutive downhole Arabic numerals (i.e., lithologic Units 1, 2, 3, etc.), irrespective of whether they are pillows, massive flows, volcaniclastic deposits, or igneous intrusions. This procedure, therefore, provides a nongenetic cataloging system.  

Stratigraphic units were defined where successions of consecutive cooling, inflation, or depositional units of  similar  or  shared  evolutionary  characteristics could be identified, usually on the basis of phenocryst type. In effect, these stratigraphic units combine similar types of eruptive products and provide a first step toward considering the volcanic stratigraphy in terms of packages of petrologically and genetically related lithologic units and, ultimately, the evolving volcanism. These packages are given consecutive downhole Roman numerals (e.g., stratigraphic Units III, IV, V, etc.) that follow consecutively from the overlying sedimentary units (e.g., Units I and II). Although we made every effort to ensure that the identified stratigraphic unit boundaries reflect individual lava packages or eruptive units, the term “boundary” should not be considered synonymous with an individual lava flow or single eruptive event but rather as indicating a division of core into elements or sections displaying broadly similar volcanic and petrologic characteristics.  

The best evidence for dividing core into lithologic units is the presence of flow/flow contacts. Unfortunately, these are not always preserved in low-recovery sections. Alternatively, the presence of glassy material or finer grained chill zones can be a useful proxy for determining the presence or estimating the position of lithologic unit boundaries. However, grain-size changes close to flow tops are often no greater than those within inflated lava flows, so interpretation of grain-size changes in core can prove difficult. Changes in vesiculation that occur through inflation or cooling units of all sizes are of particular use in sections of poor core recovery. To identify and estimate the position of lithologic unit boundaries using this method we paid special attention to vesiculation characteristics by measuring, estimating, and otherwise recording (1) the percentage volume of vesicles, (2) their modal size range, (3) their shape and sphericity, and (4) changes in vesicle size (i.e., fining- or coarsening-upward) at intervals appropriate for the variability shown in the core (typically $10{-}100\,\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals). The volume fraction of vesicles within the unit or section under consideration, together with the modal shape and sphericity of vesicle populations, was estimated using appropriate comparison charts similar to those used by sedimentologists and derived from the Wentworth (1922) classification scheme (Fig. F5). Maximum and modal sizes were determined using a hand lens with a submillimeter graticule. It proved impractical to measure the minimum size because this was always at or below the limit of visual resolution.  

# Lithology  

Lithologic descriptions followed accepted conventions. Porphyritic basaltic rocks were named according to major phenocryst phase(s), but only where the total abundance of phenocrysts was ${>}1\%$ (e.g., plagioclase-phyric basalt or olivine-augite-phyric basalt). Phenocryst phases were always listed in order of decreasing abundance so that the dominant phase was listed first. The term “phenocryst” was used for any crystal that was (1) significantly (typically five times) larger than the average size of the groundmass crystals, (2) $1>\!1\ \mathrm{mm}$ , and (3) euhedral or subhedral. The term “microphenocryst” was used for crystals larger than the modal groundmass grain size but smaller than $1\ \mathrm{mm}$ . Where macroscopic observation was possible, these microphenocrysts were also described in the DESClogik application under a suitable heading in the phenocryst table. Aphyric rocks were not assigned any mineralogical modifier.  

# Volcaniclastic deposits  

We used “volcaniclastic” as a nongenetic term for any fragmental aggregate of volcanic parentage containing ${>}60\%$ volcaniclastic grains and ${<}40\%$ other types of clastic or biogenic material. This definition is necessarily broader than that for pyroclastic deposits because the term “pyroclastic” strictly applies only to products of explosive volcanic activity, including hydroclastic deposits formed by explosive interaction between magma and water/sediment and nonexplosive quench fragmentation (i.e., hyaloclastite and peperite). Our adopted definition may also include the volcanic detritus produced by erosion or transport of volcanic material (i.e., epiclastic sediment). Accordingly, the term “volcaniclastic” does not necessarily imply active volcanism at the time of deposition.  

In fragmental lava facies we documented volcaniclastic textures using standard sedimentologic techniques (e.g., clast versus matrix modal proportions, clast size, shape, sorting, and lithology). Of particular interest was the presence (or absence) of features diagnostic of viscous or quench fragmentation while the lava was hot. These include clasts engulfing fragments of other (earlier) clasts, welding, glassy margins surrounding the clasts, extensions of the interior of the flow into the breccia, entrained clasts within the interior of the flow, and the presence of basal breccia. We used changes in clast morphology and crystallinity as well as changes in vesicle abundance and shape to identify clast types within breccia.  

Our subclassification of volcaniclastic sediment differs from the standard ODP classification (Mazzullo et al., 1988) in that we adopted a descriptive (nongenetic) terminology similar to that employed during Leg 197 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002). We simply described volcaniclastic sediment according to the classification scheme for clastic sediment, noting the dominance of volcanic grains. We followed the clastic textural classification of Wentworth (1922) to separate the various volcanic sediment types and sedimentary rocks (according to modal grain size) into the following:  

• Volcanic gravel $(>\!2{-}8\ \mathrm{~mm}$ ; equivalent to fine gravel on the Wentworth scale), • Volcanic sand $(>\!0.0625–2\,\mathrm{mm})$ ), • Volcanic silt $(0.0039{-}0.0625~\mathrm{mm})$ ), and • Volcanic clay $(<\!0.0039\;\mathrm{mm})$ .  

Volcaniclastic rocks with grain sizes in the silt and clay ranges were not found in any of the basement successions  drilled  during  Expedition  330.  For coarser-grained (modal grain size ${>}8\,\mathrm{\mm}$ ) volcaniclastic rocks with angular clasts we applied the term “breccia” and used lithologic or genetic modifiers (e.g., volcanic, basalt, and hyaloclastite) for further description.  Thus,  we  divided  the  volcaniclastic rocks  into  volcanic  sandstone $(0.0625{-}2\ \ \mathrm{mm})$ , gravel-size volcanic breccia $(>\!2{-}8\ \mathrm{mm})$ ), and volcanic breccia $\left(>8\mathrm{\mm}\right)$ . For simplicity we used the expressions “volcanic sand” and “volcanic gravel” on the stratigraphic columns. We further classified volcaniclastic rocks by adding additional modifiers to the designated principal name. Relative proportions of vitric (glass), crystal (mineral), and lithic (rock fragment) components (where the proportion exceeds $5\%$ ) were used to determine these modifiers. For example, a volcanic sandstone composed of $75\%$ glass, $5\%$ feldspar crystals, and $20\%$ lithic fragments would be named “vitric-lithic volcanic sandstone.”  

# Core and thin section descriptions  

The first step in describing the recovered core was identifying unit boundaries on the basis of lithologic changes, color, grain size, the presence of volcaniclastic or sedimentary intercalations, volcanological features (e.g., presence of contacts or chilled margins), vesicle distribution patterns, changes in primary mineralogy (occurrence and abundance of plagioclase, augite, and olivine), structure, alteration, and veins. Unit boundaries of volcanic rocks were chosen to reflect different volcanic cooling or volcaniclastic units. In some cases, limited recovery required interpolation to position unit boundaries. Of fundamental importance to core interpretation was the additional use of digital image printouts of the archive core halves. During core processing, these printouts are generated from the archive half of the split core using the digital SHIL. Annotation of these printouts provides a working record onto which observation notes, sketches of key features, or indication of shipboard sampling or analytical requirements can easily be made. This visual record also proved invaluable during the preparation of site reports. These handwritten records were later scanned and are provided as supplementary data to this volume (see SCANS in “Supplementary material”).  

# Macroscopic visual core description  

We used the DESClogik application to document each section of the igneous rock cores and upload these descriptions to the LIMS database (see DESClogik user guide). For consistency, our procedures and database templates closely followed the methods for core descriptions from recent ODP and IODP volcanic basement expeditions, in particular those to the Hawaii-Emperor Seamounts (Leg 197; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002) and Shatsky Rise (Expedition 324; Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010).  

VCD standard graphic reports were generated from data downloaded from the LIMS database to summarize each core section. An example VCD for igneous rocks is shown in Figure F6. The VCD readouts display the following items:  

• Depth in mbsf;   
• Scale for core section length $(0{-}150~\,\mathrm{cm}$ , or as appropriate);   
• Sample piece number;   
• Scanned digital image of the archive half;   
• Upward-pointing arrow indicating oriented pieces of core;   
• Sample type and position of intervals selected for different types of shipboard analytical studies;   
• Lithologic unit number;   
• Symbolized structural information;   
• Structural measurements of dip direction and dip angle;   
• Block chart displaying the percent vesicularity;   
• Stacked line chart displaying phenocryst percentage for plagioclase (pl; red line), olivine (ol; green line), and pyroxene (px; blue line);   
• Block chart displaying variation in crystal size of modal groundmass (in millimeters) and indicating presence of fresh glass (f), slightly altered glass (s), moderately altered glass $(\mathbf{m})$ , or completely altered glass (a);   
• Ornament depicting alteration intensity;   
• Chart displaying point magnetic susceptibility, including both raw (shaded) and filtered (solid) data; and   
• Chart  displaying  color  reflectance,  with  total reflectance $(\mathrm{L}^{\star})$ ,  red $(a^{\star})$ ,  and  blue $(\mathbf{b}^{\star})$ data arranged side by side, again showing both raw (shaded) and filtered (solid) data.  

Additionally, the VCDs contain written descriptions to accompany the schematic representation of the core sections. This information includes the following:  

Expedition, site, hole, core and core type, section number,  and  top  of  core  section  (measured according to the CSF-A depth scale, which directly corresponds to mbsf; see “Procedures”), shown at top of VCD; Unit number(s) (numbered consecutively downhole) and piece numbers belonging to unit (and  

on which piece, or pieces, the description was based);   
• Lithology, rock description, and name;   
• Volcanic description based on type of (partial) unit (e.g., pillow lava, massive flow);   
• Rock texture: aphyric ${\sqrt{<}}1\%$ phenocrysts), sparsely phyric $.1\%{-}2\%$ phenocrysts), moderately phyric $(>\!2\%{-}10\%$ phenocrysts), or highly phyric $(\!>\!10\%$ phenocrysts);   
• Color determined on dry rock surfaces;   
• Phenocryst percentage and type based on minerals identifiable by eye, hand lens, or binocular microscope;   
• Groundmass grain size and texture: glassy, aphanitic (crystalline, but individual grains not discernible with a hand lens), fine grained $(<\!1\mathrm{\mm})$ , medium grained $(1{-}5\ \mathrm{mm})$ , or coarse grained $(>5$ mm);   
• Vesicle percentage by volume;   
• Upper  and  lower  unit  contact  relations  and boundaries,  as  based  on  physical  changes observed in retrieved core material (e.g., presence of chilled margins, changes in vesicularity, and alteration), and information regarding their position within the section. “Not recovered” was entered where no direct contact was recovered (if igneous contact was inferred using proxy observations such as a chilled margin or changes in vesicularity); and   
• Alteration and veins (see “Alteration petrology”) and structural features (described in “Structural geology”).  

# Microscopic visual core description  

Thin section analyses of sampled core intervals were used to complement and refine macroscopic core observations. Typically, one thin section was examined and logged per defined lithologic unit, although this was not possible in volcaniclastic units with frequent alternations of massive and brecciated units. As far as was practically possible, the same terminology and nomenclature hierarchy employed for visual core compositional descriptions were also used for thin section descriptions. The textural terms used are those defined by MacKenzie et al. (1982). Phenocryst assemblages (and their modal percentages and sizes), groundmass, and alteration phases were determined, and textural descriptions were constructed. All observations were entered into the LIMS database via a special DESClogik thin section template. Downloaded tabular reports of all igneous thin section descriptions can be found in “Core descriptions.”  

# Assessing the probability that igneous rocks have remained in situ since emplacement within the volcanic seamount structures  

Determining the paleolatitude of the Louisville Seamounts was one of the primary objectives of Expedition 330, so it was essential that a large number of individual in situ igneous cooling units were collected at each site. It was therefore important to establish that (1) these units were correctly identified and (2) that the identified intervals had not rotated about a horizontal axis since they acquired their remanent magnetization. Both of these facts are easy to establish in the case of subaerial lava flows, but problems arise when the recovered units form part of a submarine succession. Individual pillows and flow lobes may be identified where recovery is high, but establishing that they had retained their cooling orientation was less straightforward. For example, individual lava lobes or pillows in an eruptive stack will probably have remained in situ, but an isolated pillow or small lobe in a volcaniclastic sequence will probably have cooled and rolled before coming to rest. It was therefore necessary to construct a set of objective criteria with which to assess the probability of an individual igneous lithologic unit having remained in situ after emplacement. These criteria, set out below, allowed us to assign to each cooling unit (our lithologic units) of lava or intrusive igneous rock in the core a number (0, 1, 2, 3) or NA (not applicable) that we call the in situ confidence index:  

${\mathrm{~\scriptsize~0~}}=$ unlikely to be in situ (individual isolated pieces ${<}30\;\mathrm{cm}$ long; any piece ${<}30\;\mathrm{cm}$ long separated from its neighbor by a selvage of hyaloclastite or breccia; any section of core of any length where there is compelling evidence that it is not in situ, such as large boulders in a conglomerate).   
$\begin{array}{r l}{1}&{{}=}\end{array}$ could be in situ (discrete lithologically similar pieces that form continuous sections of $30\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ to $1\textrm{m}$ ; continuity is broken if traces of hyaloclastite or breccia are identified between individual pieces).   
${\begin{array}{l l}{2}&{=}\end{array}}\,$ probably in situ (discrete lithologically similar pieces that extend over recovered intervals of ${>}1\textrm{m}$ , provided there are no traces of hyaloclastite or breccia between any individual pieces; core recovery need not be high).   
$\begin{array}{l l}{{3}}&{{=}}\end{array}$ highly likely to be in situ (must satisfy at least one of the following requirements: [1] lava flows with identified flow tops or bottoms; [2] dikes or sills with at least one clearly identified margin; [3] recovered intervals of core ${>}1\textrm{m}$ with pieces that clearly belong together and where core recovery over the interval extending from above to below  

the unit was ${>}60\%$ ; [4] pieces form part of an eruptive lobe or pillow stack within a continuous core showing individual cooling units in contact with each other; [5] clear vertical pipe vesicles or consistent horizontal magmatic foliation).  

NA $=$ not applicable (applied during Expedition 330 to volcaniclastic deposits made of clasts that possibly did not retain their orientation since cooling, although the deposit as a whole may have acquired the ambient magnetic field through alteration processes soon after eruption).  

# Alteration petrology  

Alteration characteristics were described from visual observation of the archive halves, and the general degree of alteration is presented on the igneous VCDs (see “Igneous petrology and volcanology”). Petrographic description of thin sections and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (bulk rock, veins, vesicles, and void infillings) were carried out on samples from the working halves.  

All igneous rocks recovered during Expedition 330 underwent some degree of alteration or weathering in subaerial, shallow-subaqueous, hydrothermal, or deep-marine environments. Primary igneous phases such as glass and olivine have therefore often been altered to a variety of secondary phases, including clays, zeolites, carbonates, and iron oxides that were identified and described by the alteration petrology group. Methods used include hand sample descriptions, inspection of polished thin sections, and XRD spectroscopy. Alteration mineralogy was defined by color, habit and shape, association with primary minerals (if distinguishable), and hardness. Complications arise in the identification and description of the secondary phases because many minerals produced in the different alteration environments (e.g., low-temperature submarine alteration and subaerial weathering) are visually similar and indistinguishable in the cores. Also, some cores may have experienced  multiple  alteration  events  (e.g.,  subaerial weathering overprinted by seafloor alteration), producing a more complex mineral assemblage. Hence the identification of some alteration phases remains tentative, pending more detailed shore-based XRD studies and electron microprobe analyses.  

# Core logging  

The types, forms, and distribution of secondary minerals were determined during core description, as was the abundance of veins and vesicles and their related  infilling  material.  Descriptions  were  based mostly on hand specimen observations of cut, dry, and wet surfaces. These observations provided information on the alteration of primary igneous features, including the alteration of phenocrysts and groundmass minerals and volcanic glass. Information was recorded on the extent of replacement of igneous minerals and groundmass by secondary minerals  and,  where  possible,  the  nature  and approximate modes of secondary mineral assemblages.  

The secondary mineral assemblages were largely composed of clay minerals that were difficult to identify macroscopically; therefore, a general descriptive term such as “brown clay” was used for these cores. Similarly, the specific zeolite and carbonate minerals are not generally distinguished, except when their crystal morphology allowed unequivocal identification. Visual estimates of alteration degree, type, color, and textures (e.g., halos and patches); abundance $(\%)$ of minerals filling veins and vesicles; and the proportion of altered groundmass, volcanic glass, and phenocrysts were recorded.  

The degree of alteration for groundmass and glass is defined and reported graphically on the VCDs according to various ranges of intensity (Fig. F7):  

Fresh $=<\!2\;\mathrm{vol\%}$ .   
Sligh $\cdot=2–10\;\mathrm{vol\%}$ .   
Moderate $=>\!10\!-\!50\;\mathrm{vol\%}.$ .   
$\mathrm{High}=>50–95\ \mathrm{vol}\%$ .   
Complete $=\mathrm{>}95\mathrm{-}100\;\mathrm{vol}\%.$ .  

Note that for some intervals, especially those containing clasts with different degrees of alteration, mixed alterations are defined.  

Alteration color was defined using Munsell Soil Color Charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 1994) and converted to a more intuitive color name (e.g., very dark gray, greenish gray, etc.). Quantification of individual mineral modes was estimated by investigating the archive halves under a binocular microscope  or  using  hand  lenses  with  graticules  of $0.1\;\mathrm{mm}$ . A distinction was made between overprinting alteration assemblages and assemblages localized by preexisting lithology changes.  

During Expedition 330, veins were first recorded by the shipboard structural geologists to identify the location, orientation, and width of the veins; alteration petrologists then recorded the mineralogy of veins and vein halos. All features were recorded in DESClogik  (see  below)  using  a  series  of  codes (Fig. F8) for vein shape (straight, sigmoidal, irregular, pull-apart, and fault vein), connectivity (isolated, single, branched, and network), texture (massive, cross fiber, slip fiber, vuggy, and polycrystalline), structure (simple, composite, banded, haloed, and intravenous), and geometry (en echelon, ribbon, and cross fractures). Likewise, vesicles were first recorded by the igneous petrology group for shape, abundance, size, and density, after which the infilling minerals were identified by the alteration petrologists. Voids were described by the alteration petrologists in terms of size, abundance, and infilling minerals.  

# DESClogik: descriptive data capture  

During Expedition 330 the DESClogik application (see DESClogik user guide) was used to enter data from visual core description, thin section description, and compilation into the LIMS database. Before drilling  operations  began,  spreadsheet  templates were constructed and customized in DESClogik to record alteration characteristics of Expedition 330. These templates were based on the methods and observations of ODP Leg 192 and IODP Expeditions 304/305 and 324 (Mahoney, Fitton, Wallace, et al., 2001; Blackman, Ildefonse, John, Ohara, Miller, MacLeod, and the Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006; Sager, Sano, Geldmacher, and the Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010). A first template was used to record general alteration characteristics observed in the igneous rocks (first column of Table T5), and a second template, shared with the igneous petrologists and structural geologists, was used to record alteration characteristics of veins and vesicles (second and third columns of Table T5).  

# Thin section description  

Thin section descriptions were also recorded using DESClogik and subsequently uploaded to the LIMS database. Secondary mineral assemblages and replacement relations to primary phases were described, as were secondary modes. Mineralogy of veins and vesicles, as well as cement and voids present in basaltic breccia, was also reported. Modal estimates of secondary minerals allowed characterization of alteration intensity. Total alteration $(\%)$ was calculated using the modal proportions of phenocrysts and groundmass minerals and their respective percentages of alteration.  

# X-ray diffraction  

Mineral identification was aided by XRD analyses using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor diffractometer with a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtered CuKα radiation. Instrument conditions were as follows:  

Voltage $=40~\mathrm{kV}$ .   
Current $=40\ \mathrm{mA}$ .   
Goniometer scan (bulk samples) $=4^{\circ}{-}70^{\circ}2\theta$ Step si $\mathrm{ze}=0.0087^{\circ}$ .   
Scan speed $=0.2\ {\mathsf{s}}.$ /step.   
Divergence slit $=0.3^{\circ}$ , $0.6\;\mathrm{mm}$ .  

When available, additional mineralogical evidence from thin section descriptions or $\mathrm{X}$ -ray diffractograms was integrated into the alteration, vein, and vesicle DESClogik template and into the summary text field of the VCDs.  

Clay mineral identification using XRD remains tentative,  notably  because  of  the  absence  of  wellmarked peaks in XRD patterns resulting from the low crystallinity of the clay minerals and the high proportion of associated calcite, which obscures the clay signal. For some samples with high proportions of clay, two other analyses of immediately adjacent material were performed in order to obtain a better resolution for clay mineral peaks. One of the two analyses was conducted after carbonates were dissolved from the sample with diluted hydrochloric acid. The second analysis was performed after ethylene glycolation of the powder $(60^{\circ}\mathrm{C};\;6{-}12\mathrm{~h})$ . This method expands the crystal network of smectite and results in a d-spacing shift toward lower 2θ (Moore and Reynolds, 1997), which allowed better identification of clay minerals that are present mainly in groundmass resulting from the alteration of interstitial glass, in coatings of vesicle walls, and in veins as intergrowths with other secondary minerals such as carbonate or zeolite.  

# Structural geology  

This section outlines the techniques used for macroscopic and microscopic description of structural features observed in Expedition 330 cores. Conventions for these structural studies generally follow those established during recent IODP hard rock drilling expeditions (Expedition 309/312 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010).  

Detailed observations of structures in the recovered igneous basement of the drilled seamounts allowed us to (1) determine if there has been any posteruption orientation change of the lava flows, either by tectonic activity close to the Kermadec subduction zone or by seamount flank collapse; (2) document structures in the core and record evidence for the relative timing of the formation of joints, veins, and other structural features caused by magmatic cooling, tectonic processes, and hydrothermal alteration; (3) where possible, record the three-dimensional orientation of all structures (Fig. F9); and (4) obtain orientations of sedimentary features (bedding, erosional surfaces, and geopetals) that may provide information for sedimentologic studies of these flattopped seamounts. All observations were entered into the LIMS database using the DESClogik application.  

Several features were logged in conjunction with other core describing laboratory groups. The orientation and distribution of veins were first logged by the structural geology group, and subsequently mineral infills and alteration halos were described by the alteration petrology group (see “Alteration petrol$\mathbf{ogy^{\prime\prime}})$ . Hyaloclastites, volcanic breccia, and chilled margins were first identified and described by the igneous petrology and sedimentology groups (see “Igneous petrology and volcanology” and “Sedimentology”),  after  which  the  orientations  of  these structures were entered into DESClogik by the structural geology group. When aligned vesicles occurred because of magma flow, vesicle orientations were recorded in DESClogik after the igneous petrologists had logged the vesicles. Sedimentary bedding was described together with the sedimentologists to ensure consistency in core descriptions.  

# Graphic symbols and terminology  

Material from both the working and archive halves of the core were examined, but structures and orientations were measured exclusively on the archive halves.  

A predefined set of structural features was used to maintain consistency in the core descriptions (Fig. F7). Brittle deformation identifiers include fractures, veins, faults, and breccia. Identification of these features was based on the presence of fractures, filling phases, and evidence of shear displacement. The terminology adopted generally follows that of Ramsay and Huber (1987), Twiss and Moores (1992), and Passchier and Trouw (1996). The terms and symbols used in the structural descriptions are presented in Figures F7 and F8. The features identified include the following:  

1. Igneous contacts (demonstrably extrusive or intrusive contacts).   
2. Fractures (brittle failure with unknown displacement and no secondary infill minerals). Joints were identified as fractures when the two sides showed no differential displacement relative to the naked eye or a $10\times$ hand lens. Faults are fractures with kinematic evidence for shear displacement across the discontinuity. Breaks clearly resulting from drilling were not logged as fractures.   
3. Veins (extensional open fractures filled with secondary minerals).   
4. Shear veins (obliquely opening veins with minor shear displacement, filled with slickenfibers or overlapping fibers).   
5. Lineations (oriented minerals in shear zones or slickenlines on a fault surface).   
6. Magmatic fabrics (magmatic foliations defined by shape-preferred orientations of primary minerals, with no evidence of crystal-plastic deformation).   
7. Aligned vesicles (filled or unfilled primary igneous gas bubbles resulting from the outgassing of the lava).   
8. Sedimentary bedding.   
9. Geopetals (vesicles or voids filled with sedimentary or hydrothermal minerals originally deposited or precipitated horizontally).  

This division of structures does not imply that all features fall into distinct and exclusive categories. The term “vein” is preferably used for all healed fractures, avoiding the usual division based on fracture width (e.g., Ramsay and Huber, 1987).  

Structural features in the cores recovered during Expedition 330 are summarized in the VCDs (Figs. F7, F10; see “Core descriptions”). For some important intervals, more detailed structural information is described and photographed in figures within the respective site reports.  

# Geometric reference frame  

To determine the orientation of a structure in the recovered core, a three-step process was followed. In step one, the attitude of a feature on the archive-half core face frame was recorded with a goniometer (Fig. F11) according to the conventions illustrated in Figure F9. The orientation of planar (Fig. F9A) or linear (Fig. F9B) structures in the core was obtained with the goniometer by rotating and holding its moveable (i.e., hinged) plane parallel to the feature to be measured. In the core face frame, the plane along which the core was split is referred to as the apparent horizontal plane, on which $000^{\circ}$ points downcore on the archive half and $180^{\circ}$ points upcore (Fig. F9A). When looking onto the face of the archive half in this $360^{\circ}$ coordinate system $270^{\circ}$ is on the right and $90^{\circ}$ is on the left (Figs. F9, F10).  

In step two, the orientations of structures were rotated $90^{\circ}$ clockwise about the horizontal $090^{\circ}{-}270^{\circ}$ axis to transform the measurements from the core face frame into the core reference frame (Fig. F9C). These rotation calculations were performed using a Perl script written by Expedition 330 scientist L. Kalnins. In the core reference frame, the cut surface of the core is a vertical plane striking $90^{\circ}{-}270^{\circ}$ , with pseudonorth $(000^{\circ})$ pointing out of the cut surface of the archive half and pseudosouth $(180^{\circ})$ pointing into the cut surface of the archive half (Fig. F9C). The core reference frame used herein is consistent with that used by the paleomagnetism group (see “Paleomagnetism”). All dip and dip direction values listed in the VCDs (Fig. F10) are reported in the core reference frame. It is important to note that the dips in the core reference frame represent the actual dips of the features within the seamount, provided that the drill hole is vertical. Dip directions, however, will have been affected by rotary drilling because the core pieces are free to rotate independently around the vertical axis while inside the core barrel. Regardless of the transformation of the measurements into the core reference frame, dip directions are still referenced relative to the plane upon which the core was split (Fig. F9).  

The full in situ orientation of the core (i.e., both dip and dip direction) can only be obtained when independent constraints are available, specifically from Formation  MicroScanner  downhole  data (see “Downhole logging”). Core reorientation is possible by matching structural features recorded on the core to structures on the borehole wall that are imaged by the Formation MicroScanner tool and measured in the true geographic reference frame. This analysis, which forms step three of the structural orientation process, is a target of postexpedition research. For sites without downhole logging, paleomagnetic measurements may potentially be useful for core reorientation, but because of the high paleolatitude of the seamounts, the uncertainty will probably be large (several tens of degrees).  

# Thin section description  

Thin sections made during Expedition 330 were examined in order to (1) confirm macroscopic descriptions of structures, (2) characterize the microstructure of the rocks, (3) identify timing relationships between magmatic and alteration processes and the relative temporal sequence between different groups of veins and joints, and (4) document downhole variations within structured zones.  

The microstructural notes were entered into the DESClogik thin section description template (see “Igneous petrology and volcanology” for details about template). For the description of microstructures we primarily applied the terminology of Passchier and Trouw (1996). Shipboard thin sections were oriented relative to the core face frame, which was marked on each thin section by an arrow pointing upward. Digital photomicrographs were taken during the expedition to document features described in the thin sections. These photomicrographs were also uploaded into the LIMS database.  

# Geochemistry  

# Sampling and analysis of igneous rocks Sample preparation  

Representative samples of igneous rocks were analyzed for major and trace element concentrations during Expedition 330 using inductively coupled plasma–atomic  emission  spectroscopy  (ICP-AES). Samples ranging in size from $\sim\!\!2$ to $\mathrm{{\sim}}8~\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}$ were cut from the core with a diamond saw blade. A thin section billet was taken from the same or adjacent interval. All outer surfaces were ground on a diamond-impregnated disk to remove altered rinds and surface contamination derived from the drill or saw. Each sample was then placed in a beaker containing tracemetal-grade methanol and washed ultrasonically for $15\ \mathrm{min}$ . The methanol was decanted, and the samples were washed in deionized water for $10\;\mathrm{min}$ and then in Barnstead deionized water $\left({\sim}18\ \mathrm{M}\Omega{\cdot}\mathrm{cm}\right)$ for $10\,\mathrm{\min}$ in an ultrasonic bath. The cleaned pieces were dried for $10{-}12\,\mathrm{h}$ at $110^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

The cleaned, dried samples were crushed to ${<}1\ \mathrm{cm}$ chips between two disks of Delrin plastic in a hydraulic press. The chips were then ground to a fine powder in tungsten carbide in a SPEX 8515 Shatterbox. Some samples were amygdular, so before grinding we handpicked chips under a binocular microscope to obtain material as free of amygdules as possible. After grinding, an aliquant of the sample powder was weighed on a Mettler Toledo balance and ignited to determine weight loss on ignition (LOI). Samples were ignited at $930^{\circ}–960^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $4\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . For samples from Sites U1372–U1374, the amount of sample  weighed  for  the  LOI  measurement  was $1000.0\,\pm\,0.5\,\mathrm{~mg}$ . Estimated relative uncertainty on LOI values for these samples is ${\sim}14\%$ on the basis of duplicate measurements. For samples from Sites U1375–U1377, a $5000.0\pm0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ aliquant was used, and the estimated relative uncertainty on LOI values is ${\sim}4\%$ .  

ODP Technical Note 29 (Murray et al., 2000) describes in detail the shipboard procedure for digestion of rocks and ICP-AES analysis of samples. The following protocol is an abbreviated form of this procedure with minor modifications. After determination of LOI, $100.0\pm0.2~\mathrm{mg}$ splits of the ignited whole-rock powders were weighed and mixed with $400.0\,\pm\,0.5$ mg of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ flux that had been preweighed on shore. Standard rock powders and full procedural blanks were included with unknowns in each ICPAES run (note that among the elements analyzed, contamination from the tungsten carbide mills is negligible; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003). All samples and standards were weighed on a Cahn C-31 microbalance (designed to measure at sea) with weighing errors estimated to be $\pm0.05\ \mathrm{mg}$ under relatively smooth sea-surface conditions.  

To prevent the cooled bead from sticking to the crucible, $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $0.172~\mathrm{mM}$ aqueous LiBr solution was added to the mixture of flux and rock powder as a nonwetting agent. Samples were then fused individually in Pt-Au (95:5) crucibles for ${\sim}12\ \mathrm{min}$ at a maximum temperature of $1050^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in an internally rotating induction furnace (Bead Sampler NT-2100).  

After cooling, beads were transferred to high-density polypropylene bottles and dissolved in $50\,\mathrm{\mL}$ of $10\%$ (by volume) $\mathrm{HNO}_{3},$ , aided by shaking with a Burrell wrist-action bottle shaker for $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$ . Following digestion  of  the  bead,  the  solution  was  passed through a $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ filter into a clean $60~\mathrm{mL}$ widemouth high-density polypropylene bottle. Next, 2.5 mL of this solution was transferred to a plastic vial and diluted with $17.5~\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to bring the total volume to $20~\mathrm{mL}$ . The final solution-to-sample dilution factor was ${\sim}4000$ . For standards, stock standard solutions were placed in an ultrasonic bath for $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$ prior to final dilution to ensure a homogeneous solution.  

# Analyses  

Major (Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na, K, and P) and trace (Ba, Sr, Zr, Y, V, Sc, Cu, Zn, Co, Cr, and Ni) element concentrations of standards and samples were determined with a Teledyne Leeman Labs Prodigy ICP-AES instrument. Wavelengths used for sample analysis during Expedition 330 are provided in Table T6. For several elements, measurements were made at more than one wavelength (e.g., Si at 250.690 and $251.611\;\mathrm{nm})$ ).  

The plasma was ignited at least $30\ \mathrm{min}$ before each run of samples to allow the instrument to warm up and stabilize. A zero-order search was then performed to check the mechanical zero of the diffraction grating. After the zero-order search, the mechanical step positions of emission lines were tuned by automatically searching with a $0.002\;\mathrm{nm}$ window across each emission peak using basalt laboratory standards BAS-140 (Bach et al., 1996) or BAS-206 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003) dissolved in $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . During the initial setup, a BAS-140 solution was used to select an emission profile for each peak to determine peak-to-background intensities and set the locations of background levels for each element. The Prodigy software uses these background locations to calculate the net intensity for each emission line. Photomultiplier voltage was optimized by automatically adjusting the gain for each element using BAS-140.  

The ICP-AES data presented in the “Geochemistry” section of each Expedition 330 site chapter were acquired using the Gaussian mode of the Prodigy software. This mode fits a curve to points across a peak and integrates the area under the curve for each element measured. Each sample was analyzed four times from the same dilute solution (i.e., in quadruplicate) within a given sample run. For elements measured at more than one wavelength, we either used the wavelength giving the best calibration line in a given run or, if the calibration lines for more than one wavelength were of similar quality, used the data for each and reported the average concentration.  

A typical ICP-AES run (Table T7) included  

• A set of 9 or 10 certified rock standards (BCR-2, BHVO-2, BIR-1, JA-3, JGb-1, JR-1, NBS-1c, SCO-1, and STM-1 or MRG-1) analyzed at the beginning of each run;   
• As many as 22 samples (unknowns) analyzed in quadruplicate;   
• A drift-correcting standard (BHVO-2) analyzed in every fifth sample position and at the beginning and end of each run;   
• Blank solutions analyzed near the beginning and end of each run and, in the longer runs, at another point in the middle of the sequence;   
• Two or three “check” standards (BHVO-2 and some combination of BCR-2, MRG-1, BAS-140, or BAS-206) run as unknowns, each also analyzed in quadruplicate; and   
A $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ wash solution run for 90 s between each analysis.  

# Data reduction  

Following each run of the instrument, the measured raw-intensity values were transferred to a data file, corrected for instrument drift, and then corrected for the procedural blank. Drift correction was applied to each element by linear interpolation between the drift-monitoring solutions run every fifth analysis. After drift correction and blank subtraction, a calibration line for each element was calculated using the results for the certified rock standards. Element concentrations in the samples were then calculated from the relevant calibration lines.  

The United States Geological Survey Hawaiian basalt standard BHVO-2 is the closest in composition to the Expedition 330 igneous rocks, and replicate measurements of this standard analyzed as an unknown were used to estimate precision and provide an idea of accuracy for both major and trace elements. Table T8 summarizes the results and compares them with recommended values (Govindaraju, 1994), showing that for most elements, Expedition 330 values agree very well with published values.  

Individual analyses of both standards and samples produced total volatile-free major element weight percentages that vary from $100\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ by as much as several percent. Possible causes include some combination of errors in weighing the sample (particularly in rougher seas) and/or flux powders (although weighed on land, weighing errors are nevertheless possible), variability in the dilutions (which were done volumetrically), and the duration and relatively low temperature of ignition. To facilitate comparison of Expedition 330 results with each other and with data from the literature, we normalized the measured major element values to $100\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ totals.  

# Semiquantitative $\pmb{\Upsilon}$ -ray fluorescence analysis  

A portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer, the Thermo Scientific Niton XL3 Analyzer, was installed aboard the ship for evaluation during Expedition 330. This instrument provides relatively rapid measurement of concentration for a number of elements in either a 3 or $8\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter area of a sample (X-ray “spot” analysis). For a preliminary report of the results of this evaluation, see XL3_EVAL.PDF in XRF in “Supplementary material.” In brief, the usefulness of the instrument for reliably distinguishing between different eruptive units via measurement of sawn core faces, cubes, or slabs is restricted to sites with a fairly large range of compositional variation. However, the instrument was found to be quite valuable for material identification in sedimentary intervals and zones of alteration. Interpretation of several core intervals was aided by the identification of ferromanganese material, phosphate, and Fepoor or Fe-rich carbonates that were present in associations involving two or more phases. These materials could not be identified, or at least not with certainty, by visual or microscopic observation, but the handheld XRF instrument identified them readily.  

# Sedimentary carbon, carbonate, and nitrogen analysis  

Sediment samples were taken from the interiors of cores with autoclaved cut-tip syringes. They were then freeze-dried to remove water and powdered to ensure homogenization. Carbonate content was determined by acidifying ${\sim}10~\mathrm{mg}$ of bulk powder with 2M HCl and measuring the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ evolved, all of which was assumed to be derived from $C a C O_{3}$ . A UIC coulometer was employed for the measurement. The weight percent of total inorganic carbon was calculated by dividing the $C a C O_{3}$ content in weight percent by 8.33.  

We determined total carbon content for the same samples by combusting the sample at an initial temperature of $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in a Flash EA-1112 Series Thermo Electron Corporation CHNS analyzer (CHNS stands for carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur). The total carbon value was then used to calculate weight percent of total organic carbon via subtraction. That is, the weight percent of inorganic carbon derived from the carbonate measured by coulometric analysis was subtracted from the total carbon content obtained with the CHNS analyzer.  

# Physical properties  

Shipboard measurements were performed to characterize the physical properties of the recovered material. The primary objective of Expedition 330 was to recover hard rock, which necessitated a modified approach compared with expeditions focusing on the recovery of soft sediment. The descriptions herein relate specifically to hard rock material; sedimentary material was treated in the same manner, except where otherwise specified.  

Once recovered, whole-round cores were first allowed to thermally equilibrate to ambient room temperature ( $^{\sim3\mathrm{~h~}}$ for both hard rock and sedimentary material). Core sections with continuous intervals of $>\!8\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{~cm~}}$ were run through the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) for measurement of gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density and magnetic susceptibility. The WRMSL also incorporates a noncontact  resistivity  detector  and  a  compressional wave ( $P$ -wave) velocity logger. The noncontact resistivity detector was not used on this expedition, and the $P$ -wave logger was used only for sections where unconsolidated sediment filled most of the core liner because the diameter of hard rock cores is generally too small to make good contact with the core liner. Sections longer than $50~\mathrm{cm}$ were measured with the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL).  

After measurements with the WRMSL and NGRL, the cores were split into archive and working halves. The archive half of the core was passed through the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) for measurement of point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance. The SHMSL uses a laser to create a profile of the archive half of the core, which yields information about the location of gaps and cracks between pieces of the core. This information was used to filter out data from gaps and cracks between pieces in magnetic susceptibility, color reflectance, and GRA data using a custom-designed MATLAB program suite, as described in “Data filtering.” The filtered data were then visually double-checked against images of the core section halves.  

Nondestructive thermal conductivity testing was performed on the working halves of the split cores. Until failure of the thermal conductivity instrument prevented further testing (see “Thermal conductivity”), roughly one measurement was made per core, depending on core recovery and lithologic variability.  

Lastly, discrete samples were taken from the working half of the core with a sampling interval of approximately $2{-}3\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , depending on lithologic variability. Many of these discrete samples were used for paleomagnetic measurements of alternating-field demagnetization (see “Paleomagnetism”), before being used for measurements of compressional wave velocity in three orthogonal directions and moisture and density measurements of wet bulk density, dry bulk density, grain density, water content, void ratio, and porosity. Details about each physical property measurement are given below. A comprehensive discussion of methodologies, calibrations, and calculations used in the JOIDES Resolution physical properties laboratory is presented by Blum (1997).  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

GRA-derived bulk density and magnetic susceptibility  were  measured  nondestructively  with  the WRMSL. To optimize WRMSL performance, sampling intervals and measurement integration times were the same for all sensors. Sampling intervals were set at $2~\mathrm{cm}$ , with an integration time of $5\ s$ for each measurement. These sampling intervals are common denominators of the distances between the sensors installed on the WRMSL $(30{-}50~\mathrm{cm})$ , which allows sequential and simultaneous measurements. After every core, quality control and assurance were monitored by passing a single core liner filled with deionized water through the WRMSL. For Expedition 330, the primary objective was the recovery of hard rock, which is often recovered in pieces rather than intact core. Anomalously low values associated with gaps and cracks in the core were removed using a data filtering procedure (see “Data filtering”).  

# Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

The GRA densitometer on the WRMSL operates by passing gamma rays from a $^{137}\mathrm{C}s$ source through a whole-round core into a $75\ \mathrm{mm}\times75\ \mathrm{mm}$ sodium iodide detector situated directly below the core. The gamma ray peak has a principal energy of $0.662\,\mathrm{MeV}$ that attenuates as it passes through the core. The attenuation of gamma rays occurs primarily by Compton scattering, which is related to the material bulk density; therefore, for a known thickness of sample, the density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of the attenuated gamma rays and can be expressed as  

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I/\mathrm{I}_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$\textit{I}=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$\mathrm{I}_{0}=$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

$\upmu$ and $\mathrm{I}_{0}$ are treated as constants, such that ρ can be calculated from I.  

In general, WRMSL measurements are most accurate when taken on a completely filled core liner with minimal drilling disturbance; otherwise, measurements tend to underestimate true values. By default, the instrument reports measurements using the internal diameter of the core liner $\left(66\mathrm{~mm}\right)$ ) as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for most sediment cores; however, for hard rock the core diameter is usually $<\!58.5\;\mathrm{mm}$ . Following Jarrard and Kerneklian (2007), the density measurements were corrected by multiplying the density values by $66/58=1.138$ to account for this bias.  

The spatial resolution of the GRA densitometer is less than $\pm1$ cm. Calibration of the densitometer was done using a set of aluminum cylinders encased in a core liner filled with distilled water. Recalibration was performed as needed when the deionized water quality control and assurance standard deviated significantly (more than a few percent) from $1\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility $(K)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic field:  

$$
K=M/H,
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field of strength $H$ . Magnetic susceptibility is sensitive to the type and concentration of magnetic minerals within a material, making it useful in identifying compositional variations. Materials such as clay, possibly from alteration of igneous materials, have a magnetic susceptibility several orders of magnitude lower than magnetite and some other iron oxides that are common constituents of igneous material. Water and plastics (e.g., core liner) have a slightly negative magnetic susceptibility.  

The WRMSL incorporates a Bartington Instruments MS2 meter coupled to an MS2C sensor coil. Data from this instrument require a correction factor, which depends on both the instrument and the operating frequency. For Expedition 330, the instrument operated at a frequency of $0.621~\mathrm{kHz}$ , whereas the sensor assumes an operating frequency of 0.595 kHz. The data are multiplied by the appropriate factory-supplied correction factor of 1.099 before being uploaded to the LIMS database. These values, however, must be converted to dimensionless SI units by multiplying by $10^{-5}$ . Measurements from the MS2C sensor are also sensitive to the diameter of the core relative to the diameter of the sensor coil and thus require an additional correction. The true magnetic susceptibility of the core is given by  

$$
K=\alpha K_{\mathrm{rel}},
$$  

with  

$$
\alpha=0.290(D/d)^{3},
$$  

where  

${\cal K}\quad=$ magnetic susceptibility of the core,   
$K_{\mathsf{r e l}}=$ measured magnetic susceptibility,   
${\cal D}\quad=\quad$ coil diameter (i.e., the aperture diameter plus $8\;\mathrm{mm}$ ) (see MS2 Magnetic Susceptibility System operation manual, www.bartington.com/operation-manuals.html), and   
$\begin{array}{r l}{d}&{{}=}\end{array}$ core diameter.  

For the instrument on board the JOIDES Resolution, $D=88~\mathrm{mm}$ , which gives a value of $\alpha=1.0$ for hard rock cores (with $^{d}$ generally between 58 and 58.5 $\mathbf{mm},$ ) and $\alpha=0.687$ for sediment cores (with $d=66$ $\mathbf{mm}$ ). However, for consistency with previous expeditions, we followed Blum (1997) and used $\alpha=0.68$ for intervals containing unconsolidated sediments, corresponding to a core diameter of $66.1–66.2\ \mathrm{mm}$ . Data discussed in the site reports and shown on the VCDs reflect corrected values. However, data in the LIMS database remain uncorrected, with only the factory-supplied correction applied.  

The spatial resolution of the MS2C instrument is $\pm2$ cm; therefore, magnetic susceptibility of core material that is not continuous over a $4~\mathrm{{cm}}$ interval will be underestimated. Data collected near gaps or from pieces ${<}4\ \mathrm{cm}$ in length were removed by a filtering process (see “Data filtering”). The removed data are shown as shaded points in the VCDs but are not shown in the site report figures. Quality control and assurance was performed at the start of the expedition with a factory-provided standard of a homogeneous mixture of magnetite and epoxy (to prevent oxidation of the magnetite) in a $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ long piece of core liner.  

# Natural Gamma Radiation Logger  

The NGRL installed on the JOIDES Resolution was designed and built at the Texas A&M University IODPUSIO facility from 2006 to 2008. Natural gamma radiation (NGR) arises primarily as a result of the decay of $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ isotopes. Data generated from this instrument are used to augment geologic interpretations, including delineation of flow boundaries and alteration zoning throughout the core. The NGRL consists of 8 sodium iodide (NaI) scintillator detectors, 7 plastic scintillator detectors, 22 photomultipliers, and passive lead shielding. The NaI detectors are covered with $8\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ of lead shielding. Half of the lead shielding closest to the NaI detectors is composed of low-background lead $({\sim}3\mathrm{~Bq/kg}$ internal radioactivity rate), and the outer half is composed of regular (virgin) lead $(50{-}200~\mathrm{Bg/kg})$ . Lead separators composed of ${\sim}7\ \mathrm{cm}$ of low-background lead are also positioned between the NaI detectors. In addition to passive lead shielding, the NGRL employs a plastic scintillator that suppresses data collection when high-energy gamma and muon components of cosmic radiation pass through it.  

For reporting purposes, the counts are summed over the range of $100–3000\ \mathrm{keV}$ to be comparable with data collection from previous expeditions and for direct comparison with downhole logging data. Background measurements of an empty core liner were made for a total count time of $11~\mathrm{{h}}$ when moving to new sites located at least $150\ \mathrm{nmi}$ from the previous site ( $^{\sim15\mathrm{~h~}}$ of total transit time); this background radiation was then automatically subtracted from each new measurement. For Site U1377, technical difficulties with the NGRL software meant that background measurements could only be taken for $4.5~\mathrm{h}$ instead of the standard $11~\mathrm{h}$ .  

NGRL measurements are taken at a spatial resolution of $10~\mathrm{cm}$ for a total of 16 measurements on a standard $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ long section of core. Because the detector unit contains eight sensors positioned $20\ \mathrm{{cm}}$ apart, analysis of each section of core consists of two steps: the first set of eight measurements at $20\ \mathrm{cm}$ apart, followed by a shift of the core section by 10 cm for the second set of eight measurements. For each section, the count time was the same at each position. Sections ${<}50\ \mathrm{cm}$ in length were not logged.  

The quality of the NGRL data depends on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample and also on the counting time, with higher times yielding better counting statistics and more accurate measurement of the energy spectra for each detector. It may be possible during postexpedition analyses to separate high-quality energy spectra into $^{40}\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{{a}}}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}_{\cdot}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ contributions, leading to eventual quantification of concentrations of the radionuclide daughters. During Expedition 330, count times ranged from 0.25 to $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$ for each position, resulting in total count times of $0.5{-}2\,\mathrm{~h~}$ per section, depending on core recovery and overall core flow. There was a concerted effort to keep count times as high as possible for future work on total abundance calculations, but ultimately times had to be reduced to keep up with exceptionally  high  recovery,  particularly  at  Site U1374.  For  Sections  330-U1374A-42R-3  through 73R-1, count times were reduced to $60\ \mathrm{min}$ for sections containing potential lava flows or lobes and 30 min for all other sections. For Site U1377 cores, count times were reduced from 60 to $30\,\mathrm{\min}$ , as needed, to ensure core was processed as quickly as possible before the end of the expedition. The counting statistics for these shorter measurement times are still of acceptable quality because the alkalic rocks of the Louisville Seamount Trail contain significantly higher K, U, and Th concentrations than mid-oceanridge basalt oceanic crust.  

The NGRL was calibrated using a $^{137}\mathrm{C}s$ and $^{60}\mathrm{Co}$ source, identifying the peaks at $662\ \mathrm{keV}$ $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ and $1330\;\mathrm{keV}$ $(^{60}\mathrm{Co})$ using calibration materials obtained from Eckert and Ziegler Isotope Products (Valencia, California [USA]).  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

The SHMSL measures color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility on core section halves. The archive half of the split core is placed on the core track, above which an electronic platform moves along a track, recording the height of the split-core surface with a laser sensor. The laser establishes the location of the bottom of the section, and then the platform reverses the direction of movement, moving from bottom to top making measurements of point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance. During Expedition  330,  point  magnetic  susceptibility  and color reflectance data were collected at $1\ \mathrm{cm}$ intervals, the highest possible resolution.  

# Color reflectance spectrometry  

Color reflectance of the core was measured using a color reflectance spectrometer that takes measurements from 380 to $900\ \mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths at $2~\mathrm{nm}$ intervals using an Ocean Optics $30\,\mathrm{\mm}$ integrating sphere and both halogen and LED light sources, covering wavelengths from ultraviolet through visible to near-infrared. The scan of the entire wavelength range takes ${\sim}5\mathrm{~s~}$ per data acquisition offset. From the full reflectance spectra collected, the data are reported using the $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{L}}^{\star}\mathbf{a}^{\star}\mathbf{b}^{\star}$ color system, in which $\mathrm{L}^{\star}$ is lightness, $\mathsf{a}^{\star}$ is redness (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{\star}$ is yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative) of the rock. The color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra: pure white (reference) and pure black (dark). Color calibration was conducted approximately once every $^{6\textrm{h}}$ (twice per shift).  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

Point magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartington MS2 meter and an MS2E contact probe with a flat $3.8\,\mathrm{\mm}\,\times\,10.5\,\mathrm{\mm}$ rectangular sensor with a field of influence of $5\ \mathrm{mm}$ and an operation frequency of $2~\mathrm{kHz}$ . The instrument averages three measurements from the sensor for each $1\ \mathrm{cm}$ offset, leading to an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . The spatial resolution of the point magnetic susceptibility instrument is ${\sim}3.8\ \mathrm{mm}$ , making it better than whole-round magnetic susceptibility for sections containing broken pieces ${<}4\ \ \mathrm{cm}$ in length (the spatial resolution of whole-round  magnetic  susceptibility).  As  with whole-round magnetic susceptibility measurements, the output displayed by the point magnetic susceptibility sensor must be converted to dimensionless SI units by multiplying by $10^{-5}$ . The probe is zeroed in air before each measurement location to avoid influence from the metal track. The point magnetic susceptibility meter was calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on the ship and is quality checked every ${\sim}6\ \mathrm{h}$ at the same time as color reflectance sensor calibration.  

# Thermal conductivity  

Thermal conductivity is the measure of a material’s ability to conduct heat and is sensitive to the material’s  porosity,  composition,  and  microstructure. Measurements of thermal conductivity were made by transiently heating samples with an automatically determined heat flux controlled by the heating power and duration using either half-space or fullspace geometry. The changes in temperature with time after initial heating were recorded using a Teka TK04 instrument system. The temperature of the superconductive probe has a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of the time after the initiation of heating (Blum, 1997).  

For lithified sections, thermal conductivity was measured on the split core with the probe in half-space mode using a needle probe embedded in the surface of an epoxy block with a low thermal conductivity (Vacquier, 1985). Sample surfaces need to be smooth to ensure adequate contact with the heating needle. Silicon gel can be employed to improve sample/needle contact, but this was avoided during Expedition 330 in order to keep the samples clean.  

Cores were measured at irregular intervals at an average of once per core, depending on the availability of homogeneous and relatively vein- and crack-free pieces that were long enough to be measured without edge effects. Pieces should be at least 7 cm long, longer than the instrument needle. Samples were selected from the working half and returned unaltered to the core liner upon completion of the tests. The sample and sensor needle were equilibrated together in seawater in a cooler insulated with extruded polystyrene foam for at least $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$ prior to measurement. Isolation of the sample and sensor needle eliminated the effect of rapid but small temperature changes introduced by air currents in the laboratory.  

Thermal conductivity in unlithified sediment was measured once per core when deemed appropriate, depending on the degree of presumed drilling disturbance. These measurements were taken using a needle embedded in the center of the section, with the probe in full-space mode.  

At the beginning of each measurement, temperatures in the samples were monitored to ensure that the background thermal drift was ${<}0.04^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ . After the background thermal drift was determined to be stable, the heater circuit was closed and the increase in the probe temperature was recorded. Maximum sample temperature during the measurements did not exceed $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ for sediment or hard rock.  

Thermal conductivity values were determined from the average of three repeated measurements. Individual measurements are usually within $1\%$ of the mean for both full- and half-space measurements and thus within a total uncertainty of $5\%$ (Blum, 1997). Measurements were made at room temperature and pressure and were not corrected for subsurface conditions. A MACOR ceramic standard with a certified thermal conductivity of $1.637~\pm~\:0.033~\:\:\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ (TeKa, Version 4.0.2) was tested frequently as a quality assurance check to ensure that readings remained accurate.  

Unfortunately, during thermal conductivity testing on core intervals from Site U1374, the hard rock thermal probe puck began to yield unreliable values, intermittently producing no value at all and then becoming completely nonfunctional. A backup thermal conductivity probe puck was then used, and it yielded one additional reasonable data point before failing as well. The probes were thoroughly dried and then used with the MACOR ceramic standard to check for accuracy. Each puck produced results for several tests but returned values significantly lower than the standard $1.637\,\pm\,0.033\,\,\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m\cdotK})$ value before failing completely once again. These probe malfunctions are attributed to water seeping into the electronic wiring, thus shorting out the device and corroding the wiring. This corrosion changed the resistivity of the wiring (to which these measurements are very sensitive), and thermal conductivity measurements could not be made for the remainder of the expedition.  

# Discrete samples  

Cubic samples were cut from the working halves of split cores at an interval of approximately one sample for every two sections. These ${\sim}8\ \mathrm{{cm}}^{3}$ samples were selected to best represent the major stratigraphic units and any variation in lithology. To minimize core depletion, most discrete samples were used for paleomagnetic measurements of alternating-field demagnetization (see “Paleomagnetism”) before being used for compressional wave velocity and moisture and density measurements, as discussed below.  

# Moisture and density  

Several rock properties (water content or moisture, bulk density, dry density, porosity, and void ratio) were determined through precise mass and volume determinations on discrete samples. Moisture and density data were also used for comparison with GRA-derived bulk density data from the WRMSL. The shipboard moisture and density facility on the JOIDES Resolution for hard rock coring consists of a vacuum water saturator, a dual balance system, and a pycnometer.  

# Sample preparation  

Determination of a precise and accurate wet mass of sparsely porous material requires that the pore space of the sample be completely saturated. To do this, we placed the samples in individual plastic vials filled with seawater and used a vacuum chamber. A vacuum pump removed the air from the chamber to a pressure of ${\sim}40–50~\mathrm{kPa}$ below atmospheric pressure, forcing the seawater into the samples. The samples were kept under saturation for at least $24~\mathrm{h}$ . After removal from the saturator, the cubes remained in the plastic vials filled with seawater to help prevent evaporation of pore water. Next, the cube surfaces were patted dry with a paper towel and wet mass was immediately determined using the dual balance system. Compressional wave $P$ -wave) velocities were then measured on the wet sample. Following the velocity measurements, the samples were dried in a convection oven for at least $24~\mathrm{h}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Dried samples were then cooled in a desiccator for at least $60\;\mathrm{min}$ before the dry mass was measured.  

# Dual balance system  

The dual balance system was used to measure both wet $(M_{\mathsf{W}})$ and dry $\left(M_{\mathsf{D}}\right)$ masses. Two analytical Mettler-Toledo XS204 balances were used to compensate for ship motion: one acting as a reference and the other for simultaneously measuring the unknown. A standard weight with similar mass to the sample $\left(\pm1\ \mathrm{g}\right)$ was placed on the reference balance to increase accuracy, giving a precision of better than $0.005\textbf{g}$ (Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010). The default setting of the balances is 300 measurements, which takes ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{\min}$ . However, in rough seas and during transit we found that longer measurement times of 400–1500 counts, depending on sea state, were required to keep the error range at or below $0.001\mathrm{~g~}$ . In addition to electronic records, the final masses and count, if different from 300, were also recorded on data log sheets, hard copies of which are stored at IODP at Texas A&M University.  

# Pycnometer system  

The pycnometer system measures dry sample volume $\left({V_{\mathrm{D}}}\right)$ with a nominal precision of $\pm0.04\,\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ . Constant-volume gas pycnometers allow volume measurements to be made by evaluating gas pressures between two sealed chambers: a sample chamber and an expansion chamber. The sample chamber is pressurized to an initial pressure $(P_{1})$ , and then the gas is allowed to expand into the second chamber. The sample volume, $V_{\mathsf{S}},$ is then given by  

$$
V_{5}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathsf{C}}+[\mathrm{V}_{\mathsf{E}}(P_{\mathsf{A}}-P_{2})]/(P_{1}-P_{2}),
$$  

where  

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathsf{C}}={\mathsf{\Omega}}$ known volume of sample chamber when empty,   
$\mathrm{V_{E}}={}$ known volume of expansion chamber,   
$P_{\mathsf{A}}\ =$ ambient pressure, and   
$P_{2}\;=\;$ pressure after gas is allowed to expand into both chambers.  

For Expedition 330, the pycnometer system on board the JOIDES Resolution had five working sample chambers, each with its own expansion chamber, allowing as many as four samples to be measured per run.  

At the start of the expedition and midway through when the helium gas tank was changed, shipboard technicians performed a calibration using stainless steel spheres of known volume to determine the volume of the sample and expansion chambers. During both acquisition and measurement, the three data acquisition cycles were preceded by three purges of the sample chambers with research-grade $99.995\%$ or better) helium gas heated to $28^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$ . These purges help remove any volatiles that could affect chamber pressure. A batch of samples consisted of four cells with unknowns and one cell with two stainless steel spheres (3.2 and $7.0\ \mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ), assumed to have a total volume known to within $1\%$ . The spheres were routinely cycled through the different cells to identify any systematic error or instrument drift. The final volume for each sample was recorded on the data log sheets together with mass information.  

# Moisture and density calculations  

Following physical measurements of wet mass $(M_{\mathsf{W}})$ , dry mass $(M_{\mathsf{D}})$ , and dry volume $(V_{\mathsf{D}})$ , the physical properties shown in Table T9 were calculated. During Expedition 330, moisture and density Method C was used to increase the accuracy of the wet mass measurements (Blum, 1997).  

# Compressional wave velocity  

Using the same discrete cube samples as were used for moisture and density measurements, the compressional wave ( $P$ -wave) velocity of hard rock samples was measured immediately after determination of wet mass. The system uses Panametrics-NDT Microscan delay line transducers, which transmit at 0.5 MHz. To maximize contact with the transducers, deionized water was applied to sample surfaces before the transducers were placed on the sample. Measurements used $x$ -axis caliper-type contact probe transducers on the $P$ -wave velocity gantry, and oriented samples were rotated manually to measure the other two axes. The three orthogonal axes form a righthanded coordinate system and are defined as follows: the $x_{\mathrm{{}}}$ -axis is normal to the split-core surface and pointing into the working half, the $\gamma_{}$ -axis is horizontal and parallel to the split-core surface, and the $Z\cdot$ -axis is downcore. The reference frame is identical to that used for paleomagnetism and structural geology analyses (see “Structural geology” and “Paleomagnetism”).  

The signal received through the sample was recorded, and the peak of the initial arrival was chosen with  automatic-picking  software.  The  complete waveform was automatically stored by the system, should reanalysis be deemed necessary; however, shipboard visual checks of the picks appeared satisfactory. The distance between transducers was measured with a built-in linear variable differential transformer (LVDT).  

Calibration was performed before measurements were made at least once a day using a series of acrylic cylinders of differing thicknesses and known $P$ -wave velocities of $2750\,\pm\,20~\mathrm{m/s}$ . The system time delay determined from calibration (i.e., the delay observed using the acrylic standards) was subtracted from the picked arrival time to give the traveltime of the $P$ -wave through the sample. The thickness of the sample (calculated by the LVDT in meters) was divided by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate a $P$ -wave velocity in meters per second.  

# Data filtering  

To remove spurious data in hard rock core sections related to gaps and piece breaks, magnetic susceptibility, GRA-derived bulk density, $\operatorname{L}^{\star},\,a^{\star},\,b^{\star}.$ , and point magnetic susceptibility data were filtered using a MATLAB program suite. These programs were written by Expedition 330 scientists L. Kalnins and P. Fulton and were inspired by a similar procedure written  by  A.  Harris  (Expedition  324  Scientists, 2010). This program uses sample height data collected with the laser attached to the SHMSL to identify cracks between pieces and gaps where plastic spacers were inserted between pieces. These gaps and cracks will, in general, provide anomalously low GRA-derived bulk density and whole-round and point magnetic susceptibility values, as well as irrelevant color reflectance values. The NGR whole-round data were not filtered because of the large sampling interval.  

Cracks and gaps in the core were detected using a combination of the curated piece lengths and positions, a minimum laser height, and the gradient of the laser height. Starting from the curated piece divisions, the filter attempts to find a gap matching each division, defined as a region bounded by gradients in excess of $40\%$ (the piece edges) or falling below the minimum laser height. If a gap cannot be detected (for example if the pieces are pressed against the plastic divider), the curated piece division is used. Pieces are then further divided using two criteria: first, any gaps detected above (bounded by gradients in excess of $40\%$ or falling below the minimum laser height) that did not correspond to a curated piece division and, second, smaller cracks with a gradient of ${>}10\%$ and an extent of ${<}1\ \mathrm{cm}$ . Limiting the extent of this second detection threshold to $1\ \mathrm{cm}$ prevents removal of pieces that are not horizontal in the core liner. Finally, pieces $<\!2\ \mathrm{cm}$ in length were removed and the subdivisions were checked against core photographs  to  remove  spurious  piece  breaks  (e.g., breaks due to large vesicles, which are indistinguishable from cracks using a single laser profile). Data measured in the spaces between pieces, as well as measurements taken near piece edges, were then removed. Finally, remaining outliers were removed using an iterative implementation of the Grubbs test (Grubbs, 1969).  

The gradient thresholds to test for both gaps and cracks, as well as minimum piece length, can be set by the user. The values used here were experimentally tuned to balance the number of divisions not detected with the number of spurious piece breaks introduced, based on laser profiles with a measurement every $0.1\ \mathrm{mm}$ (accurate to $\pm0.02\ \mathrm{mm}$ ). In the filtering program, the edge effect (i.e., how far a measurement must be from a gap or crack to remain unaffected by the missing material) associated with each instrument may also be set by the user, together with the minimum length that a piece must be to provide an acceptable measurement, typically twice the edge effect. Parameter settings used to create filtered data sets for this expedition are listed in Table T10.  

Data that were filtered out appear in the VCDs as shaded points, whereas data that met the criteria described above (e.g., GRA-derived bulk density measurements that were at least $1\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ away from a gap or crack and that were measured on pieces that were at least $2{\mathrm{~cm~long}})$ ) are plotted as solid colored points according to the legend. Only data that met the filtering parameters are shown on the figures in the site  reports.  For  GRA-derived  bulk  density  and whole-round magnetic susceptibility data, the corrections to account for the average core diameter were applied even to data that were filtered out, because these corrections resulted from instrumentation design and are not related to the filtering process.  

The major benefit of filtering GRA-derived bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and color reflectance data is that actual variations can be discerned from data trends. Data that are filtered out of the GRAderived bulk density and magnetic susceptibility data sets are underestimates of real values because of edge effects. However, caution should be used because filtering parameters have been set to remove a minimum amount of data, so some data affected by discontinuities in the core may remain.  

# Paleomagnetism  

During Expedition 330, routine paleomagnetic and rock magnetic experiments were carried out aboard the JOIDES Resolution. Remanent magnetization was measured on archive core halves and on discrete cube samples taken from working core halves. All continuous archive halves were demagnetized in an alternating field (AF), whereas discrete samples were subjected to either stepwise AF or thermal demagnetization. Since the azimuthal orientations of core samples recovered by rotary drilling are not constrained, all magnetic data are reported relative to the sample core coordinate system. In this system, $+x$ is perpendicular to the split-core surface and points into the working half (i.e., toward the double line), $+Z$ is downcore, and $+y$ is orthogonal to $x$ and $Z$ in a right-hand sense (Fig. F12).  

# Archive-half remanent magnetization data  

Remanent magnetization of the archive halves, including any undisturbed sediment, was measured at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals using the automated pass-through direct-current superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) cryogenic rock magnetometer (2G Enterprises model 760R). An integrated in-line AF demagnetizer (2G Enterprises model 600) capable of applying peak fields up to $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ was used to progressively demagnetize the core. Demagnetization steps were typically (5), 10, (15), 20, (25), 30, 40, 50, (60), and (70) mT, where the fields in parentheses were not always performed.  

With strongly magnetized materials, the maximum intensity that can be reliably measured (i.e., with no residual flux counts) is limited by the slew rate of the sensors. At a track velocity of $2\;\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s}$ , it was possible to measure archive-half cores with a magnetization as high as ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{A/m}$ . Where even this slow measurement speed still resulted in residual flux counts, the data were nonetheless archived because they provide some indication of the character of the magnetization. Caution is therefore warranted in using archive-half data from strongly magnetized intervals. Although the baseline values measured just prior to and just after archive-half measurements were not saved in the database, the baseline drift, and thus the number of residual flux counts, can be determined indirectly from the archived directional and intensity data. We developed LabView software (WebTabularToMag) to reconstruct the baseline drift, allowing the residual flux counts to be logged while the data were converted for further processing.  

A noise test was conducted on the magnetometer on a relatively calm day on station to assess the practical resolution of the instrument. This test was performed with a modified version of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography LabView code in order to allow more rapid communication with the magnetometer and therefore capture an unaliased record of wave noise. All three axes were sampled simultaneously every ${\sim}0.5\mathrm{~s,~}$ in contrast with the existing magnetometer software that sequentially accessed these data at a slower rate of ${\sim}3.5~\mathrm{s}.$ . The spectra from these magnetic noise measurements (Fig. F13) revealed a peak at the dominant period (8–12 s) of wave motion, corresponding to a moment of a $\sim\!1\,\times\,10^{-9}\;\mathrm{Am}^{2}$ and therefore a practical resolution of $\sim\!1\times\,10^{-5}\;\mathrm{A/m}$ for a core half.  

The most recent compiled version of the LabView software (SRM_SAMPLE) is Build 1.0.0.3. However, an uncompiled version of this program (BETA with speed control) was used throughout the expedition because this allowed the track speed to be adjusted, a critical parameter for hard rock expeditions. Two modifications to the program and the Galil motor system were made during the expedition. First, the speed at which the archive halves were moved when not measuring was increased to $20\;\mathrm{cm/s}$ . Second, the simultaneous sampling of the magnetometer axes described above was also incorporated into the magnetometer software midway through measurements on archive halves from Hole U1374A (a more rapid measurement routine was implemented on 14 January 2011 with Section 330-U1374A-31R-3). Together, these changes resulted in substantial time savings (on the order of $0.5\;\mathrm{h}$ per section with 6–8 demagnetization steps) and also allowed multiple measurements at each interval for weakly magnetized cores.  

The response functions of the pick-up coils of the SQUID sensors have a full width of $7{-}8\ \mathrm{cm}$ at half height (Parker and Gee, 2002). Therefore, data collected within ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{\cm}$ of piece boundaries (or voids) are significantly affected by edge effects. Consequently, all data points within $4.5\ \ \mathrm{cm}$ of piece boundaries (as documented in the curatorial record) were  filtered  out  prior  to  further  processing.  It should be noted that edge effects may also occur in a contiguous core piece if substantial heterogeneity (in intensity or direction) is present in the piece. Such artifacts are more difficult to filter out, but calculating the average direction (using Fisher statistics) for each core piece provides a means of identifying these problems (see below).  

# Automated calculation of best-fit directions  

Remanent magnetization directions were calculated for each $2~\mathrm{cm}$ measurement using principal component analysis (PCA; Kirschvink, 1980). Manual selection of principal component directions was not practical given the substantial amount of data. Rather, we used an automated procedure to select the most linear segment of the demagnetization data. PCA was conducted for each permutation of four or more consecutive demagnetization steps (typically 6–8 steps). The following criteria were then used to calculate a single misfit value that could be minimized to select the best-fit direction and to assign a reliability index to this selection. First, the range of demagnetization steps must yield a fit with low scatter (e.g., Fig. F14A), as defined by the maximum angular deviation (MAD, as used in equations below) of the PCA fit. Second, the selected direction should trend toward the origin. Deviation from the origin (e.g., Fig. F14B, F14F) may indicate that an unresolved higher coercivity component is present or that a spurious magnetization was acquired during demagnetization. Deviation of the fit from the origin is calculated from the solid angle $(\upalpha)$ between the unconstrained PCA fit and the fit anchored to the origin. Third, a particular fit is generally judged to be more reliable if a large percentage of the remanence $(f)$ is used for the calculation (e.g., Fig. F14A, F14C). We use the vector difference sum (the cumulative sum of the magnetization vector removed at each demagnetization step) to characterize the percentage of the remanence, as this is monotonically decreasing. By selecting target values $(\alpha_{\circ},\,\mathrm{MAD}_{\circ},$ and $f_{\mathrm{{o},}}$ ) for each of these criteria, a single misfit value may be calculated for each trial PCA fit:  

$$
\mathrm{misfit}=\{(\alpha/\upalpha_{\mathrm{o}})+[(1-f)/(1-f_{\mathrm{o}})]+(\mathrm{MAD/MAD_{\mathrm{o}})\}.\nonumber
$$  

Although minimizing the above misfit value finds a suitable best-fit direction in many cases, two additional constraints were introduced. Selecting the largest percentage of the remanence has the unfortunate side effect of preferentially excluding particularly high coercivity intervals (which in fact may provide the highest quality remanence data). We therefore allowed a best-fit direction to be anchored to the origin if the anchored fit represents a significant improvement (enforced through a penalty, arbitrarily set at 1.5, on anchored fits). The misfit for such anchored fits is given by  

and U1374A. The histograms in Figure F15 illustrate the distributions of MAD, $\upalpha,$ , and $f$ values for the $40\%$ of the data with misfit values below the cutoff value.  

This automated selection routine generally provides a reasonable fit to the demagnetization data (Fig. F14). Low-coercivity overprints, such as drilling-induced remanent magnetization, are ignored whether they constitute a small or substantial percentage of the natural remanent magnetization (Fig. F14C, F14D, F14F, F14G). The program does not find a satisfactory straight line fit for samples exhibiting curvilinear behavior, as one would expect (Fig. F14B). Anchored PCA fits constitute $12\%$ of the directions with misfits less than the cutoff value. Although some high-coercivity samples with apparently reliable directions are excluded (Fig. F14H), any inclination bias due to such anchored fits is minimized.  

Note that the intensity reported for such PCA directions represents the length of the projection of the lowest- and highest-treatment vectors used in the PCA calculation onto the best-fit direction. Because the origin is not included in the PCA calculation and the remanence remaining after the highest treatment may be significant, the resulting characteristic remanent magnetization intensity values are systematically lower than those derived from the remanence at the lowest demagnetization step adopted for the PCA calculation.  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{misfit_{A}}=\{(\mathrm{CSD}/\alpha_{\mathrm{o}})+[(1-f)/(1-f_{\mathrm{o}})]+(\mathrm{MAD}/\mathrm{MAD}_{\mathrm{o}})\}}\\ {\times\ 1.5,\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}\end{array}
$$  

where the circular standard deviation (CSD) of the remanence vectors used for the fit replaces $\upalpha$ for the unconstrained fit. Finally, where a substantial lowcoercivity component (e.g., from drilling) is present, the natural remanent magnetization step, and optionally the first demagnetization step, may be eliminated prior to finding the lowest misfit.  

The best-fit PCA was calculated using target values of $\alpha_{\circ}\,=\,5^{\circ}$ , $\mathrm{MAD}_{\circ}\,=\,3^{\circ}$ , and $f_{\mathrm{o}}\,=\,0.6$ , unless otherwise noted. The values of the misfit parameters provide a qualitative measure of reliability and have been used to filter out less reliable data. If all three parameters contributing to the misfit equal the target values, the misfit value will be equal to 3.0 for a free (not anchored) PCA fit. The minimum misfit distributions for the three data sets from Holes U1372A, U1373A, and U1374A are shown in Figure F15. The three cumulative distribution curves intersect at a misfit value of ${\sim}3.4$ , and for each data set ${\sim}40\%$ of the data have misfit values lower than this value. We elected to retain only the most reliable $40\%$ of the data for further analysis, which corresponds to a cutoff value of 3.40 for Hole U1372A and 3.42 for Holes U1373A  

# Piece-average directions  

The mean remanent magnetization of individual archive-half pieces ${>}9$ cm was calculated as an additional internal reliability check. All $2~\mathrm{cm}$ individual PCA directions with sufficiently low misfits (see above) were averaged using Fisher statistics; the reported PCA intensity is the vector mean. Heterogeneous magnetization directions in a single piece can be identified from high values of the associated CSD. Figure F16 shows the data from a single piece and illustrates two aspects of the adopted piece-averaging approach that should be kept in mind. First, the piece average is calculated using the curated piece lengths assuming that all subpieces have the same relative orientation. Thus, any subpieces that have rotated relative to one another may adversely affect the mean direction (e.g., the break between subpieces at ${\sim}65~\mathrm{cm}$ in Section 330-U1372A-9R-2 [Piece 1] in Fig. F16). Second, when boundaries separating flows or lithologic units with different directions or intensities occur within a piece, the average direction may be erroneous. Conversely, if they are sufficiently different, inclination variations in a piece may facilitate recognition of unit boundaries. Hence, piece averages with $\mathrm{CSD}\,>\,20^{\circ}$ were excluded from further shipboard analysis. However, it is likely that careful analysis of changes at subpiece boundaries would allow some of these rejected data to be retained in later shore-based analysis of the data.  

# Discrete sample data  

All discrete samples taken from the working halves for shipboard magnetic analysis were $8~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ cubes. Although standard $2.5\ \,\mathrm{cm}$ diameter minicores are more commonly used, the cubic samples were preferred because they should have a more reproducible vertical reference (based on a double-bladed saw cut perpendicular to the core length) than the minicores (where the fiducial arrow on the split-core face must be transferred to the long axis of the sample). Discrete samples for shipboard analysis were selected on the basis of identified flow boundaries, the in situ confidence index (see “Igneous petrology and volcanology”), and results from archive-half stepwise AF demagnetization.  

The remanent magnetization of discrete samples was measured exclusively with the JR-6A spinner magnetometer following tests of discrete sample measurements on the cryogenic magnetometer (described below). For samples measured on the spinner magnetometer, the automated sample holder was used, providing the most accurate discrete sample remanent magnetization directions and intensities. A set of four standard samples (previously measured in the shielded room at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and archived as SIO 1, SIO 2, SIO 6, and SIO 8) was measured on the spinner magnetometer. The directions obtained were typically within $1^{\circ}{-}2^{\circ}$ of the known  values,  and  intensities  were  accurate  to within a few percent.  

The current version of the software for discrete sample measurements on the cryogenic magnetometer (SRM_DISCRETE, Build 1.0.0.1) allows for measurement in 24 separate orientations. The four SIO standards were measured in all orientations (Fig. F17). These  experiments  revealed  considerable  scatter among these 24 positions, ranging from ${\sim}10^{\circ}{-}15^{\circ}$ for strongly magnetized samples $({\sim}1{-}10\;\mathrm{A/m})$ up to and exceeding $30^{\circ}$ for weaker samples. The origin of this scatter is unknown. For this reason, all discrete samples were measured using the spinner magnetometer. The archive-half data measured on the cryogenic magnetometer agree with discrete sample data, and we have no reason to question their validity.  

Discrete samples were subjected to stepwise AF demagnetization  using  a  DTech  AF  demagnetizer (model D-2000) capable of peak fields as high as $200\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Typically 12–15 AF demagnetization steps were used, with the peak field values selected according to sample coercivity. The residual magnetic field at the demagnetizing position in this equipment was ${5-50~\mathrm{nT}},$ , with the higher value apparently associated with vessel headings that are nearly east–west (the ambient field in this case is parallel to the mu-metal shield housing the instrument). Despite this low residual field, spurious magnetizations were nonetheless observed at high peak fields for some samples. At peak fields of ${>}40~\mathrm{mT},$ samples were therefore typically demagnetized and measured twice (once after demagnetization along the sample $+x,\ +y,$ and $+Z$ directions and again after demagnetization along the $-x,-y,$ and $-Z$ directions) to identify and compensate for any spurious remanent magnetization acquisition caused by a bias field in the demagnetizing coil. An alternative method in which the last axis demagnetized was systematically varied was also used for some discrete sample demagnetizations.  

Discrete samples were thermally demagnetized using a  Schonstedt  Thermal  Specimen  Demagnetizer (model TSD-1) capable of demagnetizing specimens up to $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Each sample boat for thermal demagnetization included as many as nine samples, and sample orientations were varied at alternative steps to allow any interactions between adjacent samples to be identified. Samples were held at the desired temperature for $40\;\mathrm{min}$ and then cooled in a chamber with a residual magnetic field of ${<}30\ \mathrm{nT}.$ . Magnetic susceptibility was measured using a Bartington MS2F point magnetic susceptibility meter after every heating step to monitor thermal alteration of magnetic minerals during heating.  

In addition to standard paleomagnetic measurements, the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility was determined for all discrete samples using the KLY 4S Kappabridge with the software AMSSpin (Gee et al., 2008). The susceptibility tensor and associated eigenvectors and eigenvalues were calculated off-line following the method of Hext (1963). All bulk susceptibility values reported for discrete samples are based on a nominal $8\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ volume.  

# Inclination-only analysis  

For azimuthally unoriented cores the simple arithmetic mean of inclination data will be biased to shallower values (e.g., Kono, 1980; McFadden and Reid, 1982; Arason and Levi, 2010). To compensate for this bias, we used the inclination-only statistics of Arason and Levi (2010) to calculate the overall mean inclination from discrete sample demagnetization data from each drill site, as well as the mean inclinations for each lithologic unit from the more abundant archive-half data. As one estimate, we simply calculate the inclination-only mean and associated $\upalpha_{95}$ uncertainties (Arason and Levi, 2010) from all $2~\mathrm{cm}$ PCA directions (with misfit below the cutoff value) from a single lithologic unit. Alternatively, the same inclination-only technique may be applied by averaging all Fisher piece-average inclinations from a single lithologic unit. These two approaches provide similar results, differing primarily in the uncertainty estimates where $_n$ is small: the $\upalpha_{95}$ values for the pieceaverage data are necessarily larger than those calculated from the greater number of $2\ \mathrm{cm}$ measurements. The former error estimate is likely more realistic because the individual $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ data points are not all statistically independent.  

Although the Arason and Levi technique is more robust than previous inclination-only methods (e.g., Kono, 1980; McFadden and Reid, 1982), this technique nonetheless fails to converge under certain circumstances. For example, if inclinations are steep and the scatter is substantial or if dual polarities (also with steep inclination) are present, no maximum likelihood estimate is possible. If initially no solution was found, we recalculated with only the dominant polarity data if ${<}10\%$ of the data were of opposite polarity (splitting the data set arbitrarily at an inclination of $0^{\circ}$ ). For unit average inclinations based on $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ archive-half data, means are reported only for units with more than one inclination measurement. In the case of piece-average directions, single inclination measurements were retained because each typically represents the mean direction from multiple samples.  

# Downhole logging  

Downhole logs are used to determine the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the formation penetrated by drilling. The data are rapidly collected, continuous with depth, and measured in situ; they can then be interpreted in terms of stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, magnetic characteristics, and geochemical composition of the penetrated formation. Where core recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log data may provide the only way to characterize the borehole section. Where core recovery is good, log and core data complement one another and may be interpreted jointly.  

Downhole logs are sensitive to formation properties on a scale that is intermediate between those obtained from laboratory measurements on core samples and geophysical surveys. They are useful in calibrating the interpretation of geophysical site survey data (e.g., through the use of synthetic seismograms) and provide a necessary link for the integrated understanding of physical properties on all scales.  

During Expedition 330, downhole measurements were taken in Holes U1374A and U1376A.  

# Wireline logging  

During wireline logging, logs were made with a variety of Schlumberger logging tools and the thirdparty  Göttingen  Borehole  Magnetometer  (GBM) (Steveling et al., 1991). These tools were combined into several tool strings that were run down the hole after coring operations were completed. Four wireline tool strings were used during Expedition 330 (Fig. F18; Table T11):  

1. The triple combination (triple combo), which recorded density, porosity, electrical resistivity, and gamma ray;   
2. The Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic, which recorded gamma ray, microresistivity images of the borehole wall, and compressional and shear wave velocities;   
3. The Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI), which recorded transit times, amplitudes, and borehole radii; and   
4. The GBM, which logged a three-component magnetic field.  

The first three tool strings also contained a telemetry cartridge for communicating through the wireline to the Schlumberger data acquisition system on the drillship. The GBM communicates with its own dedicated acquisition unit on the drillship through the standard logging wireline.  

In preparation for logging, the boreholes were flushed of debris by circulating viscous drilling fluid (sepiolite) mud mixed with seawater (approximate density $\approx1.08\ \mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ ) through the drill pipe to the bottom of the hole. The boreholes were reamed and displaced with heavy (approximate density $\approx\,1.26\$ $\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ mud (barite). The bottom-hole assembly was pulled up to $\mathord{\sim}130$ mbsf in Hole U1374A and ${\sim}80$ mbsf in Hole U1376A. The tool strings were then lowered downhole by a seven-conductor wireline cable during sequential runs. A wireline heave compensator was employed to minimize the effect of ship heave on tool position in the borehole (see “Wireline  heave  compensator”).  During  each Schlumberger logging run, incoming data were recorded and monitored in real time on the MCM MAXIS logging computer. The tool strings were then pulled up at constant speed, typically 250–300 $\mathrm{m/h}$ , to provide continuous measurements as a function of depth of several properties simultaneously.  

# Logged formation properties and tool measurement principles  

The logged properties and the methods by which they are measured are briefly described below. The main logs taken by the tools are listed in Table T12.  

More detailed information on individual tools and their geological applications may be found in Serra (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989, 1994), Rider (1996), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), Ellis and Singer (2007), and Robinson et al. (2008). A complete list of acronyms for Schlumberger tools and measurement curves is available at www.slb.com/modules/ mnemonics/index.aspx.  

# Natural radioactivity  

The Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS), a spectral gamma ray tool, uses two bismuth germanate scintillation detectors and five-window spectroscopy to determine concentrations of $^{40}\mathrm{K},$ $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ in the formation. The isotopes of these elements dominate the natural radiation spectrum. The HNGS filters out gamma ray energies $<\!500$ $\mathrm{keV},$ eliminating sensitivity to bentonite or KCl in the drilling mud and improving measurement accuracy. The computation of the elemental abundances uses a least-squares method of extracting thorium, uranium, and potassium elemental concentrations from the spectral measurements.  

# Density and photoelectric effect  

Formation density was determined with the Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS), which contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source $(622\;\mathrm{keV})$ and far and near gamma ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid that is pressed against the borehole wall by a hydraulically activated decentralizing arm. Gamma rays emitted by the source undergo Compton scattering, which involves the transfer of energy from the gamma rays to the electrons in the formation via elastic collision. The number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detectors is directly related to the density of electrons in the formation, which is in turn related to bulk density. Porosity may also be derived from bulk density if the matrix density is known.  

The HLDS also measures photoelectric absorption as the photoelectric effect. Photoelectric absorption of gamma rays occurs when their energy is reduced below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ after being repeatedly scattered by electrons in the formation. Because photoelectric effect depends on the atomic number of the elements in the formation, it also varies according to the chemical composition of the minerals present and therefore can be used to identify some minerals (for example, the photoelectric effect of calcite is 5.08 barns per electron $[\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{e}^{-}]$ and that of quartz is $1.81\,\,\mathrm{b/e^{-}})$ . Good contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential for good logs. Poor contact typically results in underestimation of density values.  

# Porosity  

Formation porosity was measured with the Accelerator Porosity Sonde (APS), which incorporates a minitron neutron generator that produces fast (14.4 MeV) neutrons and five neutron detectors (four epithermal and one thermal) positioned at different spacings from the minitron. The tool’s detectors count neutrons that arrive at the detectors after being scattered and slowed by collisions with atomic nuclei in the formation. The near detector is centered in the tool and is used to normalize the count rates for differences in the minitron source. The remaining detectors are decentered, and neutron backshielding is used to focus them toward the formation to minimize the effect of the borehole environment.  

Neutrons leaving the tool travel through the surrounding borehole and formation and interact primarily with hydrogen atoms present in the common formation fluids. Because neutrons and hydrogen atoms have about the same mass, successive collisions rapidly reduce the energy of the neutrons to the thermal energy level of the formation $(0.025\;\mathrm{eV})$ . Because water contains about the same quantity of hydrogen per unit volume, the detector count-rate ratios  can  be  calibrated  in  terms  of  liquid-filled porosity in clean formations. However, because hydrogen bound in minerals such as clay or in hydrocarbons also contributes to the measurement, the raw porosity value is often an overestimate.  

A mineral’s ability to absorb thermal neutrons is defined as its capture cross section, Sigma $(\Sigma_{\mathsf{f}})$ . Formations and formation fluids containing chlorine atoms are the most effective capturer of thermal neutrons. Thus, the rate of thermal neutron decay in the formation can be measured and used to differentiate between hydrocarbons in the pore space and salt  water.  Sigma  is  measured  in  capture  units. Higher values of Sigma equate to a greater ability to capture thermal neutrons.  

# Electrical resistivity  

The phasor Dual Induction Tool (DIT) was used to measure electrical resistivity. This tool provides three measures of electrical resistivity, each with a different depth of investigation into the formation. The two induction devices (deep and medium depths of penetration)  transmit  high-frequency  alternating currents through transmitter coils, creating magnetic fields that induce secondary currents in the formation. These currents produce a new inductive signal, proportional to the conductivity of the formation, which is measured by the receiving coils. The measured conductivities are then converted to resistivity (in units of ohm-meters). For shallow-penetration resistivity, the current necessary to maintain a constant drop in voltage across a fixed interval is measured, which is a direct measurement of resistivity. Typically, igneous minerals found in crustal rocks are electrical insulators, whereas sulfide and oxide minerals, as well as ionic solutions like pore water, are conductors. Electrical resistivity, therefore, can be used to evaluate porosity (via Archie’s law) and fluid salinity.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The Dipole Shear Sonic Imager (DSI) measures the transit times between sonic transmitters and an array of eight receivers. It combines replicate measurements, thus providing a direct measurement of sound velocity through formations that is relatively free from the effects of formation damage and an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989). Along with the monopole transmitters found on most sonic tools, it also has two crossed-dipole transmitters, which allow the measurement of shear wave velocity in addition to compressional wave velocity. Dipole measurements are necessary to measure shear velocities in slow formations whose shear velocity is less than the velocity of sound in the borehole fluid. Such slow formations are typically encountered in deep ocean drilling (e.g., for Expedition 330 the sediments overlying igneous basement).  

# Formation MicroScanner  

The FMS tool provides high-resolution electrical resistivity–based images of borehole walls. The tool has four orthogonal arms and pads, each containing 16 button electrodes that are pressed against the borehole wall during the recording. The electrodes are arranged in two diagonally offset rows of eight electrodes each. A focused current is emitted from the button electrodes into the formation, with a return electrode near the top of the tool. Resistivity of the formation at the button electrodes is derived from the intensity of current passing through the button electrodes.  Processing  transforms  these  measurements into oriented high-resolution images that reveal the geologic structures of the borehole wall. Further analysis can provide measurements of dip and direction (azimuth) of planar features in the formation.  

The development of the FMS tool has added a new dimension to wireline logging (Luthi, 1990; Salimullah and Stow, 1992; Lovell et al., 1998). Features such as vesicles, veins, fractures, and volcaniclastic breccia can be resolved, and the fact that the images are oriented means that fabric analysis can be carried out and structural feature (e.g., fracture) orientations can be measured. If the same features in these high-resolution electrical images can be identified in the recovered core samples, individual core pieces can be reoriented with respect to true north.  

The maximum extension of the caliper arms is 38.1 cm (15 inches). For holes with a diameter larger than $38.1~\mathrm{cm}$ , pad contact at the end of the caliper arms will be inconsistent, and the FMS images may appear out of focus and too conductive. Irregular (rough) borehole walls will also adversely affect the images if contact with the wall is poor. Standard procedure is to make two full passes up the borehole with the FMS to maximize the chance of getting full borehole coverage with the pads.  

# Ultrasonic Borehole Imager  

The UBI features a high-resolution transducer that provides acoustic images of the borehole wall. The transducer emits ultrasonic pulses at a frequency of 250 or $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ (low and high resolution, respectively) that are reflected at the borehole wall and then received by the same transducer. The amplitude and traveltime of the reflected signal are determined. Continuous rotation of the transducer and the upward motion of the tool produce a complete map of the borehole wall. The amplitude depends on the reflection coefficient of the borehole fluid/rock interface, the position of the UBI tool in the borehole, the shape of the borehole, and the roughness of the borehole wall. Changes in the borehole wall roughness (e.g., at fractures intersecting the borehole) are responsible for the modulation of the reflected signal. Therefore, fractures or other variations in the character of the drilled rocks can be recognized in the amplitude image. The recorded traveltime image gives detailed information about the shape of the borehole, which allows calculation of one caliper value of the borehole from each recorded traveltime. Amplitude and traveltime are recorded together with a reference to magnetic north by means of a magnetometer (General Purpose Inclinometry Tool [GPIT]), permitting the orientation of images. If features (e.g., fractures) recognized in the core are observed in the UBI images, orientation of the core is possible. The UBI oriented images can also be used to measure stress in the borehole through identification of borehole breakouts and slip along fault surfaces penetrated by the borehole (Paillet and Kim, 1987). In an isotropic, linearly elastic rock formation that is subjected to an anisotropic stress field, drilling a subvertical borehole causes breakouts in the direction of the minimum principal horizontal stress (Bell and Gough, 1983). Because of time constraints, the UBI was only run in Hole U1374A.  

# Borehole inclination and magnetic field measurement  

Three-component acceleration and magnetic field measurements were made with the GPIT. The primary purpose of this tool, which incorporates a three-component accelerometer and a three-component magnetometer, is to determine the acceleration and orientation of the FMS-sonic and UBI tool strings during logging. This information allows the FMS and UBI images to be corrected for irregular tool motion and the dip and direction (azimuth) of features in the images to be determined. The GPIT was also run on the triple combo tool string in order to provide data to optimize the wireline heave compensator before logging began and to acquire the best possible downhole data. The GPIT is run with other tools on the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings that can carry remanent or induced magnetization; therefore, its magnetic measurements can be affected. However, on the FMS-sonic tool string the GPIT has greater nonmagnetic insulation from the other tools, which greatly reduces the effects on its magnetic measurements.  

# Göttingen Borehole Magnetometer  

The GBM was designed and developed in 1989 by the Geophysical Institute of the University of Göttingen, Germany (Fig. F19A). The tool consists of three fluxgate sensors that log the horizontal $x$ and y) and the vertical (z) components of magnetic flux density (Steveling et al., 1991). In the first version of the tool, orientation was determined by two inclinometers, which still can be used to measure deviation of the tool from vertical. In 2001 the first fiber-optic gyro was installed in the GBM to measure rotations around the vertical axis of the tool. Since then, two additional angular rate sensors have been added to the tool to monitor variations around the tool’s $x-$ and $\gamma$ -axes during a logging run.  

The tool connects directly to the Schlumberger cable head and is deployed with a centralizer and two sinker bars (a Schlumberger sinker bar and a new virtually nonmagnetic aluminum sinker bar, the latter being especially developed for Expedition 330 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography). The nonmagnetic sinker bar was found to be essential following extensive tests in August 2010 in Houston, Texas. The tests revealed that the Schlumberger sinker bar and the centralizer both carried nonnegligible remanent  magnetization  (with  the  centralizer  being much more magnetic than the sinker bar) and, together with induced magnetization, caused an error of up to $350~\mathrm{nT}$ in the magnetic measurements of the GBM when used in a common tool string configuration. The truly nonmagnetic aluminum sinker bar reduced this influence to ${<}50~\mathrm{nT}$ by almost doubling the distance of the magnetometers from the other parts of the tool string. The Schlumberger sinker bar had to be deployed in conjunction with the nonmagnetic aluminum sinker bar to increase the weight of the tool string, and the centralizer was necessary to both center the tool in the borehole and reduce tool rotation. The GBM housing is made of low-magnetic monel and is not affected by pressures or temperatures up to $70\ \mathrm{MPa}$ and $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ , respectively. Specifications are listed in Table T13.  

The GBM was deployed during Expedition 330 because the tool’s fiber-optic gyros allow independent determination of both inclination and declination of the magnetic field in the borehole (and hence estimation of declination and inclination of the magnetization of penetrated lava flows). In addition, the better quality of the GBM magnetic data, especially the low magnetic influence of the other parts of the tool string (thanks to the aluminum sinker bar), can possibly help to better orient the FMS and UBI data (postexpedition). The fluxgate magnetometers incorporated in the GPIT are sufficient for orienting the FMS tool string; however, these sensors have relatively poor sensitivity $(50\,\mathrm{\nT})$ and, more importantly, substantial $({\sim}1000~\mathrm{nT})$ offsets that limit interpretation of the data (e.g., Ito et al., 1995). The fluxgate magnetometers in the GBM have better resolution $(12\;\mathrm{nT})$ and are well calibrated. For example, when the ambient field was measured with the GBM above the HSDP-2 drill hole on Hawaii (Steveling et al., 2003), the inclination of $36.5^{\circ}$ compares well with the International Geomagnetic Reference Field inclination of $36.6^{\circ}$ , and the measured total field was compatible with that determined by aeromagnetic surveys.  

# GBM angular rate sensors  

LITEF miniature fiber-optic rate sensors were used to provide angular rate output during the entire run (downlog and uplog) of the GBM. The tool contains three of these gyros, each of which has a small volume and low weight and requires very little power (2 VA) (Fig. F19B). Free from gravity-induced errors and with no moving parts, the sensors are insensitive to shock and vibration. The rate sensors are unconventional gyros because they do not have a spinning wheel. The sensor detects and measures angular rates by measuring the frequency difference between two contra-rotating light beams. The light source is a superluminescent diode, and its broad spectrum provides light with a short coherence length to keep the undesirable backscattering effects in the optical path to sufficiently low levels. The beam is polarized, split, and phase modulated. The output light travels through a $110\mathrm{~m~}$ long fiber coil. The light travels to the detector, which converts the light into an electronic output signal. When a gyro is at rest, the two beams have identical frequencies. When the gyro is subjected to an angular turning rate around an axis perpendicular to the plane of the two beams, one beam then has a greater optical path length and the other beam has a shorter optical path length. Therefore, the two resonant frequencies change, and the frequency differential is measured by optical means, resulting in a digital output. Readings are output at $1\;\mathrm{Hz}$ . The angular rate, sampled at $5\:\mathrm{Hz}$ , is a function of time and corresponds to the accumulated angle.  

The angular rate measured by the sensor is influenced by the Earth’s rotation, which depends on latitude (ø) and varies from $15.04^{\circ}/\mathrm{h}$ at the poles to $0^{\circ}/\mathrm{h}$ at the Equator (Fig. F19C). From Equator to pole, Earth’s measured rotation increases by $\sin(\phi)$ . To obtain the rotation rate about an inertial system, the effect of Earth’s rotation must be eliminated. To do so, the orientation of the tool relative to the Earth’s reference frame at the beginning of a measurement has to be known exactly. The $x$ -gyro of the GBM was aligned with the axis of the ship using a scope mounted to the tool and a sighting plate positioned in the center of the helideck at the aft of the ship. Knowing that the tool was identically oriented with the ship, information from the ship’s gyro and two GPS antennas was then used to determine the heading of the ship (at the time of sighting) and thus the orientation of the tool at the start of logging. This procedure was repeated at the end of each logging run to compare the true heading of the gyro with the heading calculated by the data-processing algorithm. This was done to check for errors in the reorientation procedure. If the corrected rotation rate around each axis is known, the orientation of the tool can be derived as a function of depth from the rotation history, and thus the three components of the magnetic field can be calculated for every data point collected by the GBM.  

The maximum operation temperature for the fiberoptic gyros is $70^{\circ}\mathbf{C}$ . The gyros have a temperaturedependent drift that is lowest between $35^{\circ}$ and $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ so the gyros were heated. The temperature of the gyros was measured during the logging run, and the temperature drift was corrected for during data processing. However, depending on the resistance of the wireline, the voltage received by the tool is not sufficient to heat against the cold seawater. As a result, during Expedition 330 the temperature of the gyros typically decreased to values below $35\mathrm{^\circC}$ but never fell below $28^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ , which is still an acceptable temperature range (Fig. F20). Data were acquired from the tool using GBMlog software (written by E. Steveling,  

University of Göttingen) and processed with GBMdatenverarbeitung software (developed by S. Ehmann, University of Braunschweig).  

# Logging data quality  

The principal influence on log data quality is the condition of the borehole wall. If the borehole diameter is variable over short intervals (resulting from washouts during drilling or ledges caused by layers of harder material) the logs from some tools (e.g., FMS, density, and porosity tools) may be degraded. Deep $(0.23–1.5\textrm{m})$ investigation measurements such as resistivity and sonic velocity, which do not require contact with the borehole wall, are generally less sensitive  to  borehole  conditions.  Very  narrow bridged sections also cause irregular log results. The quality of the borehole is improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling fluid while drilling, flushing the borehole to remove debris, performing a full wiper trip, and logging as soon as possible after drilling and conditioning are completed.  

The quality of the depth determination depends on a series of factors. The depth of the wireline-logged measurement is determined from the length of the logging cable played out at the winch on the ship. The seafloor is identified on the natural gamma ray log by the abrupt decrease in gamma ray count at the sediment/water interface (“mudline”). Discrepancies between drillers and core depth and wireline log depth occur because of core expansion, incomplete core recovery, incomplete heave compensation, and drill pipe stretch, in the case of drillers depth. In the case of log depth, discrepancies occur because of incomplete heave compensation, incomplete correction for cable stretch, and cable slip. Tidal changes in sea level also have an effect. To minimize the wireline tool motion caused by ship heave, a hydraulic wireline heave compensator (see below) was used to adjust the wireline length for rig motion during wireline logging operations.  

# Wireline heave compensator  

The new wireline heave compensator system installed during the recent refit (first used during Expedition 320T in February 2009) is designed to compensate for the vertical motion of the ship and maintain a steady motion of the logging tools. It uses vertical acceleration measurements made by a motion reference unit located under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertical motion of the ship. It then adjusts the length of the wireline by varying the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes. Realtime measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleration are made simultaneously by the motion reference unit and the GPIT tool, respectively. A software package developed by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory allows these data to be analyzed and compared in real time, displaying the actual motion of the logging tool string and enabling monitoring of the efficiency of the compensator. In addition to an improved design and smaller footprint compared to the previous system, the location of the wireline heave compensator with the winch unit on the starboard side of the derrick contributes to a significant reduction in the time necessary to prepare for logging operations.  

# Logging data flow and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real time and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. The initial logging data were referenced to the rig floor (wireline log depth below rig floor). After logging was completed, the data were shifted to a seafloor reference (wireline log depth below seafloor), which was based on the step in gamma radiation at the sediment/water interface. These data were made available to the science party as a provisional data set.  

The data were transferred on shore to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, where standardized data processing took place. The main part of the processing is depth matching to remove depth offsets between data from different logging runs, which results in a new depth scale (wireline log matched depth below seafloor). In addition, corrections are made to certain tools and logs, documentation for the logs (with an assessment of log quality) is prepared, and the data are converted to ASCII for the conventional logs and GIF for the FMS images. Schlumberger Geo-Quest’s GeoFrame software package is used for most of the processing. The data were transferred back to the ship within a few days of logging, and this processed data set was made available to the science party (in ASCII and DLIS formats) through the shipboard IODP logging database.  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

GeoFrame’s  IESX  seismic  interpretation  software package was available during Expedition 330 to display site-survey seismic sections acquired before the expedition. Velocity and density logs, together with equivalent measurements made on core in the physical properties laboratory, can be used to create synthetic seismograms. The depth-traveltime relation must be adjusted until the features in the synthetic seismogram match the features in the seismic section. In this way, lithostratigraphic units in the core may be correlated with reflectors and sequences in the seismic section. Should the quality of the shipboard sonic and density logs be sufficient, synthetic seismograms can be produced postexpedition.  

# Microbiology  

Starting in the 1990s, microbiologists participating in ODP and IODP expeditions have documented the presence of microbial life in deeply buried sediment and the basaltic basement (Fisk et al., 1998; Parkes et al., 1994). Active microbial life has been detected as deep as 1626 mbsf (Roussel et al., 2008), and the introduction of molecular biology into marine ecology has led to great advances in our understanding of microbial life below the seafloor (Biddle et al., 2008; Cowen et al., 2003; Inagaki et al., 2006; Mason et al., 2010). Much of the microbiology performed during ODP and IODP expeditions has concentrated on sediment (e.g., ODP Leg 201 to the Peru margin), with the notable exception of expeditions to the Juan de Fuca Ridge (Cowen et al., 2003; Lever et al., 2006) and Atlantis Massif (Mason et al., 2010). Sampling for microbiological studies during Expedition 330 focused primarily on the microbiology of basement rocks. Differences in microbial population between the overlying sediment and volcaniclastic layers and the basaltic basement were also targeted. Drilling during Expedition 330 provided a unique sample set because at several sites there is a thin layer of sediment overlying volcaniclastic breccia, followed by igneous basement. As much as $505\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of basement was drilled at Site U1374, providing one of the most complete sets of igneous basement samples to date for microbiological investigation  

# Sediment sampling  

Whole-round core samples are required for microbiological studies to avoid contamination introduced by sample handling before and during the core splitting process. For sediment samples, whole rounds were sampled on the catwalk. After the core liner was cut, whole-round sediment samples were cut off with a sterile spatula, transferred onto a precombusted ( $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $2\;\mathrm{h}$ ) aluminum foil sheet, and immediately transported to the cold room in the microbiology laboratory, where they were processed.  

Sediment samples were collected for molecular biology and cell counts. One of the goals of this sampling was to trace the change, if any, in microbial community composition across the sediment/basement transition. The sampling was carried out on unconsolidated sediment recovered from the uppermost $\sim\!10\!-\!20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ at each drill site where such sediment was recovered.  

One $5\,\textrm{c m}$ whole round of sediment was collected from each core in the $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ interval immediately adjacent to the core catcher. Once the samples were transported to the microbiology cold room, a sterile syringe with the top cut off (creating a cookie cutter type of coring device) was used to collect $2~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for cell counts, $2\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur and total organic carbon analyses (see “Geochemistry”), and ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for molecular biological work. For cell counts, $2~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment was added to $8~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\%$ formalin in $3\%$ NaCl (sterile filtered) in a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ Falcon tube.  

Molecular biology samples were collected in sterile $5~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes and frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shorebased analysis. After microbiology sampling, an extruded polystyrene foam plug was placed in the void left in the center of the whole round, preventing the collapse of its outer rim (which was likely contaminated by drilling fluids and therefore not used for microbiological analysis) and allowing it to be returned to the curator for further sampling by other laboratory groups.  

# Igneous rock sampling  

For volcaniclastic breccia and basement samples, whole rounds were selected in the core splitting room and collected from the core liner onto precombusted ( $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $^{2\,\mathrm{h}}$ ) aluminum foil before the core was cleaned with water. Samples were chosen with a petrologist present to ensure that no samples critical to the main objectives of the cruise were lost because of microbiological sampling, which destroys nearly the entire sample. Before samples were transported to the microbiology laboratory, photographs of each side of the whole-round sample were taken while the sample was on the combusted foil. During sampling and photography, samples were handled with gloved hands only.  

Prior work has shown that the interiors of rock cores are generally free from contamination (Lever et al., 2006). Therefore, efforts were taken to sample only the core interiors. Sections that showed some sign of alteration or fluid flow conduits were specifically chosen because these are likely locations for microbial life. Microbiology samples on average were 5–10 cm long. All samples were divided into subsamples for cell counts, molecular biological analyses (DNA and RNA extraction, to be carried out on shore), and in situ stable isotope analysis $\mathrm{\Delta}^{\leftmoon4}\mathrm{S}$ and $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C})$ . For some samples, stable isotope addition bioassays and cultivation experiments were also performed.  

The undisturbed whole round was washed three times with artificial seawater in a fresh, resealable storage bag before subsampling to avoid contamination from drilling fluids. Next, the rock was split with a sterile chisel and sampled from the interior. For those samples on which culturing or stable isotope bioassays were to be performed on board, a portion of the sample was sectioned off immediately, and placed in a $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ environment in a glove bag or the anaerobic chamber to minimize exposure of anaerobic cells to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ while the rock was being processed. These precautions were taken because basement rocks at Sites 801, 1272, and 1274 have been shown to be anaerobic based on detection of sulfate reduction, a strictly anaerobic process (Alt et al., 2007; Rouxel et al., 2008). Therefore, we assumed that the basement rocks here were also anaerobic. Whenever pieces of the whole round remained, including the outer portions of the rock, they were returned to the curator to be placed back into the working and archive sections of the core.  

# Molecular biology  

Samples were placed in $5~\mathrm{mL}$ autoclaved centrifuge tubes and immediately stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for DNA analysis or were placed in 15 or $50~\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes with LifeGuard Soil Preservation Solution (MoBio Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and held at $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ overnight before freezing at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for RNA analysis. LifeGuard protects the viability of microbial cells while keeping them in stasis, allowing for efficient DNA and RNA extractions from samples collected in the field. These samples will be analyzed during postexpedition research.  

# Stable isotope analysis  

Analysis of in situ $\delta^{34}\!S$ fractionation in the rocks can indicate the presence of microbially mediated sulfate reduction (Alt et al., 2007; Rouxel et al., 2008), even in basalts older than $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Analysis of in situ $\delta^{13}C$ fractionation provides insight into the production mechanism of carbon present in the rocks (Mason et al., 2010). Samples for stable isotope analysis were subsamples of the whole round sampled for molecular biology. At least $20\;\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of rock chunks were placed in Whirl-Pak bags and set in the anaerobic chamber in the cold room for a few hours, after which the bags were sealed in the chamber (so that the atmosphere of the closed bag remained anaerobic) and stored at $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Isotopic analysis will be carried out as part of postexpedition research. Alteration rims were specifically targeted for this work because they are more likely to harbor microbes (Fisk et al., 1998).  

# Cultivation experiments  

Based on prior work with both subsurface and surface-exposed basalts, the functional groups of microbes likely to be found in the subsurface basalts along the Louisville Seamount Trail include sulfur oxidizers, sulfate reducers, methanogens, iron reducers, and iron oxidizers (Cowen et al., 2003; Mason et al., 2009, 2010; Santelli et al., 2009). Media targeting enrichment of these groups were prepared prior to the expedition and used to culture subsurface microbes. Details of the media recipes can be found in Table T14. Samples used for culturing were maintained in an anaerobic environment following collection and splitting of whole rounds into rock fragments for culturing and molecular biology sampling. Rock fragments were placed in $5\,\mathrm{\mL}$ serum vials filled with different media and sealed. The vials were kept at $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (the assumed temperature of the volcanically inactive subsurface seamount environment) until the end of the expedition and then were shipped in refrigerated containers for onshore assessment of growth. If any enrichments prove successful, further steps will be taken to isolate and characterize  pure  cultures  of  microorganisms  during postexpedition research.  

# Stable isotope bioassays  

$^{13}\mathrm{C}_{}$ -labeled bicarbonate was used to measure incorporation rates of inorganic carbon into subsurface microbes as an indicator of autotrophic production in this environment. In addition, $^{13}\mathrm{C}_{}$ -labeled glucose and acetate were used to measure incorporation rates of organic carbon by heterotrophic microbes, $^{15}\mathrm{N}\!\cdot$ labeled ammonia and nitrate were used to estimate rates of N uptake by subsurface microbes, and $^{34}\!S$ elemental sulfur was used to measure rates of sulfur cycling.  

In each experiment, $100\,\mathrm{\mL}$ of artificial seawater (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, Missouri [USA]) modified with $50~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ sodium nitrate, $3~{\upmu\mathrm{M}}$ potassium phosphate, and $0.5~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ ammonium chloride was added to a precombusted serum vial. We herein refer to this as the basic seawater medium. Sigma sterile seawater is collected from surface water in the Gulf Stream, which is low in N and P. However, deep seawater has N and $\mathrm{P}$ concentrations closer to those of the modified Sigma sterile seawater. Note that the composition of pore water in the subsurface rocks collected during Expedition 330 is unknown, so we chose to simulate typical deep seawater. Enough rock chips were added to cover the bottom of the vial. This amount depended on the amount obtained during sample processing.  

A more persuasive “enhanced extraction” method for obtaining large amounts of uncontaminated rock samples for these bioassays was developed during sample processing of Sample 330-U1374A-15R-2, 79–  

$89~\mathrm{cm}$ . For all other (nonstable isotope addition bioassay)  microbiology  sampling  during  Expedition 330, subsamples were retrieved only from the centermost portion of the whole-round sample to avoid potential contamination from drilling fluids on the outside of the whole-round sample. This method provided enough uncontaminated sample suitable for cell counts, culturing experiments, and molecular biology analysis. However, analysis of stable isotope addition bioassays requires more rock than can be collected solely from the center of the whole-round sample. Therefore, the following enhanced extraction method was carried out on all samples for stable isotope analyses from Holes U1374A–U1377A:  

1. The whole-round sample was rinsed three times with sterile filtered seawater in the same manner as all other microbiology samples.   
2. The outside of the rock was flamed with a propane blowtorch by laying the whole round on its side in the rock box, flaming it for $5\;{\mathsf{s}}_{.}$ , and then rotating it. All four quadrants of the rock were flamed to ensure the entire outside of the whole round was sterilized. The top and bottom of the whole round were also flamed for $5\;s$ .   
3. An ethanol- and flame-sterilized chisel was used to remove the outer portion of the whole round, and rock chips from the inside of the rock were selected and preserved for cell counts and molecular biological analysis. Sections of the whole round were also preserved for shore-based analysis of in situ $^{34}\!S$ and $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ .   
4. The remainder of the rock was broken into rock chips ${\sim}2{-}3\ \ \mathrm{cm}$ in diameter with the sterilized chisel. These chips were then placed in unused Whirl-Pak bags.   
5. The Whirl-Pak bags were placed between two autoclaved polytetrafluoroethylene Delrin plugs inside an autoclaved section of core liner ${\bf\left\langle{\sim}20\ c m\right.}$ long) and crushed using a Spex 3624B X-Press hydraulic press, with pressure not exceeding 2 tons.   
6. The rocks were removed from the bags and collected in unused $50\,\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes for transportation to the radiation van, where they were used in the stable isotope addition bioassays.  

The advantages of the enhanced extraction method are twofold. First, sterilizing the outside of the entire whole round allows samples from all parts of the rock to be collected with minimal fear of contamination, which allows collection of a greater volume of rock than that which could be obtained solely from the interior of the whole-round sample. Although some of the rock chips collected (those pieces containing portions of the outside of the whole round)  

will contain no live microbes because of the sterilization, the gain of volume versus the loss of cells makes this a valuable sampling method. Second, using the hydraulic press allows a large volume of small rock chips to be collected, which is important because the mouth of the serum vial used for these incubations is only $17~\mathrm{mm}$ wide. Enough rock material was collected using the enhanced extraction method to add $15{-}30\ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ per serum vial for bioassays, starting with Site U1374.  

Following sampling using the enhanced extraction method, two different sets of treatments were prepared for the stable isotope bioassays: (1) $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ bicarbonate, $^{15}\mathrm{N}$ ammonia, and $^{34}\!S$ sulfate, which targeted metabolic rates specifically among autotrophic microbes, and (2) $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ glucose, $^{13}\mathrm{C}$ acetate, $^{15}\mathrm{N}$ nitrate, and $^{34}\!S$ , which targeted metabolic rates among heterotrophic microbes. Varying concentrations of each stable isotope were added during the expedition as experimental strategies were adjusted. For the range of concentrations for each label, see Table T15.  

After a stable isotope label was added to each vial, the vials were sealed with a rubber stopper and crimped. Incubations were kept at $4^{\circ}\C$ until termination. At the end of each incubation, $5\ \mathrm{mL}$ of fluid was removed from each vial with a syringe and transferred to a crimp-sealed $20~\mathrm{mL}$ serum vial containing $1~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\ \mathrm{g}/30\ \mathrm{mL}$ NaOH solution (for dissolved inorganic carbon), and the excess fluid was poured into a $50\,\mathrm{\mL}$ Falcon tube. The remaining rock chips were collected in a separate Falcon tube.  

For each stable isotope bioassay, there were four time points $(t_{0}{-}t_{3})$ . The first $(t_{0})$ was when the rock was collected  during  routine  microbiology  sampling, which provided the background stable isotope fractionation value. No manipulation of this rock was performed  after  sampling.  The  remaining  time points were taken from the incubation vials as described above. The second time point $(t_{1})$ was taken after 2 weeks (most were processed on the ship), the third time point $(t_{2})$ was taken after 2 months, and the fourth time point $\left(t_{3}\right)$ was taken after 6 months. Both $t_{2}$ and $t_{3}$ were sent to shore, and the incubations will be terminated during shore-based research. The long duration of the experiments allows for detection of potentially slow metabolisms of subsurface microbes.  

# Cell counts  

During Expedition 330, we attempted to enumerate cell abundances for the basaltic rock samples to determine biomass concentrations in the subsurface basalt environment. Crushed and powdered basalt $(1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ samples were fixed with $4~\mathrm{mL}$ of $4\%$ paraformaldehyde in $3\%$ NaCl at $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ overnight. The fixed basalt suspensions were then subjected to cell counting according to the following protocol:  

1. After vigorous stirring of the paraformaldehydefixed slurry, $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of the suspension was immediately dispensed in $10~\mathrm{mL}$ of filtered $1\times$ phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer $(\mathrm{pH}\,7.4)$ .   
2. The second suspension was placed in an ultrasonic bath for $30\;s$ .   
3. The ultrasonically treated suspension was filtered through a $25\,\mathrm{\mm}$ diameter, $0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ pore size black polycarbonate filter underlain by $25\,\mathrm{\mm}$ diameter, $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ pore size cellulose.   
4. Cells on the polycarbonate filter were stained with filtered $1\times\,\mathrm{SYBR}$ Green I (Invitrogen; Ann Arbor, Michigan [USA]) DNA stain in filtered $1\times$ tris-EDTA (TE) buffer for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ .   
5. The stained filter was washed twice with $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of filtered $1\!\times\!\mathrm{PBS}$ buffer.   
6. The washed filter was mounted on a slide with one drop of immersion oil and covered with a cover glass.   
7. The SYBR-stained cells were directly observed by using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope with a band-path filter slit (excitation at $470\,\mathrm{nm}$ ; fluorescence $>515\;\mathrm{nm}$ ) at $1000\times$ magnification ( $100\times$ objective; $10\times$ eyepiece).  

For each cell count, at least 20 microscopic fields were observed, and cell-shaped forms that produced bright green fluorescence were enumerated as cells.  

The minimum detection limit was estimated by counting blank filter samples that were treated with $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of filtered $1\!\times\!\mathrm{PBS}$ with $4\%$ paraformaldehyde, as described above. Cell numbers in the blank filters were calculated as the average of all blanks processed during the expedition. The minimum detection limit was set to be the blank value plus three times the standard deviation. For completely negative control samples, crushed basalt pieces were combusted at $500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $3\,\mathrm{~h~}$ and then counted using the same method.  

Unfortunately, shipboard cell counts on rock samples proved impossible because of a combination of fluorescence from the rocks themselves and focusing difficulties caused by ship movement. These two factors made it extremely difficult to distinguish between microbial cells and rock particles. We will endeavor to develop successful counting methods for subsurface rock samples during postexpedition research.  

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), a modification of classic PCR, is essentially a fluorogenic assay used to quantify the number of target genes, and hence cells, in a given environmental sample. During postexpedition research, qPCR will be applied to the samples collected. Then the two biomass estimation methods (cell counts and qPCR) will be compared (Einen et al., 2008; Santelli et al., 2008).  

# Contamination testing of drilling fluids  

As part of the drilling process, a huge amount of surface seawater is injected into each borehole and is the major source of contamination with microorganisms in the cores collected. As a check for contamination, the microbial composition of the drilling fluid (surface ocean water) was assessed, and organisms present in both the drilling fluid and rock samples will be considered a sign of contamination. These organisms will be presented as contaminants, not subsurface residents. If there are any samples in which all of the organisms detected were also detected in the drill fluid, these samples will not be included in further analyses. Although it is possible that some species may be present both in surface seawater and the subsurface biosphere, we feel it will be more informative and conclusive to focus on microbes known to be present in subsurface samples only. Water samples were collected directly from the injection pipe in sterile bottles with screw caps and were handled using sterile equipment. Microorganisms present in the drilling fluid were extracted by filtration using a vacuum pump through $0.2\,\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ pore polycarbonate filters. Filters were frozen in cryotubes at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shored-based DNA extraction and analysis.  

# Fluorescent microsphere contamination testing  

Bags of yellow-green fluorescent microspheres (Fluoresbrite carboxylate microspheres; Polysciences, Inc., 15700) with a diameter of $0.52\pm0.01~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ were occasionally used (i.e., for 1–2 cores per site) as a particulate tracer that mimics the movement and dispersal of microbial cells in the drill pipe during coring. The microspheres were then counted in core samples, in drill fluid caught as the drill core arrived on the rig floor, and in each of three sterile seawater rinses of the whole-round samples.  

The concentration of microspheres was set at $10^{10}$ spheres $^\prime\mathrm{mL}$ (Smith et al., 2000), and the microspheres were deployed in Whirl-Pak bags containing $40\;\mathrm{mL}$ of microsphere suspension in deionized water $(2\times10^{11}$ microspheres in a $40~\mathrm{mL}$ bag). The bag was then heat-sealed, leaving some extra plastic (not filled with beads) at each end. By attaching the loose plastic ends using para-aramid synthetic cord, the bag was wedged into a shim above the core catcher and stretched across the throat of the core barrel. Cores were consequently forced to burst through the bead bag when a core was taken.  

The microspheres are highly fluorescent ( $458\;\mathrm{nm}$ excitation; $540~\mathrm{nm}$ emission) and appear bright green when they are observed by epifluorescence microscopy (Smith et al., 2000). Concentrations of fluorescent microspheres in core samples were quantified using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope fitted with a mercury lamp (HBO 100 W), a blue filter set, and a 100 Å Plan-NEOFLUAR oil-immersion objective. Nonfluorescent immersion oil was used for all observations. Aliquots $(100~\upmu\mathrm{L})$ of the crushed rock suspension or sediment slurry were resuspended in $10~\mathrm{mL}$ of filtered $1\times$ PBS solution and filtered onto black, $25\,\textrm{m m}$ diameter polycarbonate filters $.0.2\;{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ pore size) in a filtration tower. The filters were then mounted on microscope slides with a drop of nonfluorescent immersion oil and covered with a coverslip. The microspheres on the filter were then counted using the epifluorescence microscope. Microsphere abundance on the filters was determined by averaging the total number seen in at least 20 randomly selected fields of view.
