The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) is a multidisciplinary investigation of fault mechanics and seismogenesis along subduction megathrusts and includes reflection and refraction seismic imaging, direct sampling by drilling, in situ measurements, and long-term monitoring in conjunction with laboratory and numerical modeling studies. The fundamental objectives of NanTroSEIZE are to characterize the nature of fault slip and strain accumulation, fault and wall rock composition, fault architecture,  and  state  variables  throughout  an  active  plate boundary system. As part of the NanTroSEIZE program, operations during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 348 were planned to extend and case riser Hole C0002F, begun during IODP Expedition 326 in 2010 and continued during Expedition 338 in 2012, from 860 to 3600 meters below the seafloor (mbsf).  

Riser operations during Expedition 348 were carried out and deepened the hole to 3058 mbsf, a new maximum depth record in scientific ocean drilling. Operations included installation and cementing of $13\%$ inch casing to 2008.9 mbsf and an $11\%$ inch liner to $2922.5~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , stabilizing the borehole for future deepening. Reaching this depth required two sidetracking operations from the original Hole C0002F, resulting in the designation of Holes C0002N and C0002P for the successively deeper sidetracks. During drilling, a suite of logging-while-drilling (LWD) and measurement-while-drilling (MWD), mud-gas, and cuttings data were collected over the interval from 2162.5 to 3058.5 mbsf in Hole C0002P, and a partial suite was collected in Hole C0002N. The interval from 2163 to 2218 mbsf was cored with the rotary core barrel (RCB). Planned future riser drilling operations will deepen the hole to penetrate the plate boundary fault at \~4600–5200 mbsf.  

Additionally, a test hole for a prototype slimhole small-diameter RCB (SD-RCB) coring system, Hole C0002M, was drilled in riserless mode near Hole C0002F. The hole was advanced to 475 mbsf, where four cores were collected to 512.5 mbsf.  

Overall, Expedition 348 sampled and logged a deep interval in Holes C0002N and C0002P within the inner accretionary wedge, from 856 to $3058.5~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , including a never-before sampled zone in the lowermost ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{km}$ of drilling. Cores were collected over a $55.5\;\mathrm{m}$ interval from 2163 to 2218.5 mbsf. The sampled sedimentary rocks are composed of hemipelagic sediment and fine turbidites with rare ash. The entire interval from ${\sim}2145.5$ to 2945.5 mbsf has an apparent depositional age of 9.56–10.73 Ma based on nannofossil first and last occurrence data. These ages are consistent with accretion of a middle Miocene section of either lower Shikoku Basin equivalent or Miocene-age trench fill; facies analysis suggests the former. Bedding attitudes were ubiquitously steep, measured at $60^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ}$ in both cores and resistivity image logs. A range of structural fabrics was sampled, including common development of scaly clay fabrics with polished and slickensided clayey surfaces at many depths throughout the drilled interval. Structural fabrics became progressively stronger with depth, and carbonate cement and veins became prevalent below 2100 mbsf. In the cored interval, a well-developed foliated fault zone was identified at 2204.9–2205.8 mbsf, with unknown overall displacement sense or amount. This zone contains abundant carbonate cement and vein fill. Log data interpretation suggests at least one additional significant fault zone at ${\sim}2220$ mbsf based on fracture intensity and bedding dip anomalies, including apparent broad folds and overturned bedding. Log data also show that resistivity follows a trend of increasing with depth to $\mathord{\sim}1600$ mbsf but varies little from this depth to the bottom of the hole. $P$ -wave velocity $(V_{\mathsf{P}})$ also increases to $\mathord{\sim}1600$ mbsf and then decreases slightly with depth to the bottom of the hole, perhaps due to progressively increasing clay content with depth, increased fracturing or rock damage, or pore fluid overpressure.  

# Introduction  

The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) is a multiexpedition, multistage project focused  on  understanding  the  mechanics  of seismogenesis and rupture propagation along subduction plate boundary faults. The drilling program includes a coordinated effort to sample and instrument the plate boundary system at several locations offshore of the Kii Peninsula (Kinoshita, Tobin, Ashi, Kimura,  Lallemant,  Screaton,  Curewitz,  Masago, Moe, and the Expedition 314/315/316 Scientists, 2009) (Figs. F1, F2). The main objectives are to understand:  

The mechanisms and processes controlling the updip aseismic–seismic transition of the megathrust fault system,   
The processes of earthquake and tsunami generation,   
The mechanics of strain accumulation and release,  

The absolute mechanical and elastic strength of the  plate  boundary  fault  and  surrounding upper and lower plate crustal material, and The potential role of a major upper plate fault system (termed the “megasplay” fault) in seismogenesis and tsunamigenesis.  

Along the Nankai margin, high-resolution seismic reflection imaging across the inner and outer wedge tectonic domains of the accretionary prism shows that, above ${\sim}10~\mathrm{~km}$ depth, the plate boundary (megathrust) fault separates the wedge from a zone of underthrust sediments (Moore et al., 2007, 2009; Bangs  et  al.,  2009;  Strasser,  Dugan,  Kanagawa, Moore, Toczko, Maeda, and the Expedition 338 Scientists, 2014). Furthermore, a large out-of-sequence splay thrust system described as the “megasplay fault”  in  Tobin  and  Kinoshita  (2007)  (Fig.  F2), branches from the plate boundary décollement close to the updip limit of inferred coseismic rupture in the 1944 Tonankai Mw 8.2 earthquake (Fig. F1) into a fanning system of thrusts that reach the near-surface (Park et al., 2002). Based on recent 3-D reflection and wide-angle refraction seismic interpretation (Bangs et al., 2009; Kamei et al., 2013), the high-amplitude reflector beneath Site C0002 previously identified as the megasplay fault is now believed to be the main plate boundary fault (Figs. F2), with the fault splay point up-dip of this location. Several lines of evidence indicate that faults of this megasplay system are geologically active (Kimura et al., 2011) and may participate in coseismic slip (e.g., Sakaguchi et al., 2011). However, the partitioning of strain between the outer décollement zone and the megasplay system (Fig. F2) and the nature and mechanisms of fault slip as a function of depth and time on the megasplay and the plate boundary fault are not understood. One of the main objectives of the NanTroSEIZE project is to document the role of the megasplay and deeper plate boundary faults in accommodating plate motion (both seismically and interseismically) and to characterize the mechanical and hydrologic behavior of the margin.  

NanTroSEIZE Stage 1 comprised IODP Expeditions 314, 315, and 316, which were carried out as a unified drilling program in 2007–2008 (Tobin et al., 2009a). Eight sites were selected for riserless drilling to target the frontal thrust region, the midslope shallow portion of the megasplay fault region, and the Kumano forearc basin (Figs. F1, F2). Holes C0002A– C0002D (Figs. F3, F4) were the pilot LWD and coring holes for planned deeper riser drilling and operations, whereas the other sites primarily targeted fault zones in the shallow, presumed aseismic portions of the accretionary complex (Kinoshita, Tobin, Ashi,  

Kimura,  Lallemant,  Screaton,  Curewitz,  Masago, Moe, and the Expedition 314/315/316 Scientists, 2009). Expedition 314 was dedicated to in situ measurement of physical properties and borehole imaging through logging while drilling (LWD) (Tobin et al., 2009b). Expedition 315 was devoted to core sampling and downhole temperature measurements at sites in the megasplay region and in the forearc basin (Ashi et al., 2009). Expedition 316 targeted the shallow frontal thrust and megasplay fault (Screaton et al., 2009).  

Stage 2 of NanTroSEIZE comprised four IODP expeditions (319, 322, 332, and 333), with the aims of building on the results of Stage 1, characterizing the subduction inputs from the Philippine Sea plate, and preparing for later observatory installations for longterm monitoring of deformation at the updip limit of the seismogenic zone (Saffer, McNeill, Byrne, Araki, Toczko, Eguchi, Takahashi, and the Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010; Underwood et al., 2010; Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011; Henry, Kanamatsu, Moe, and the Expedition 333 Scientists, 2012).  

NanTroSEIZE Stage 3 started with IODP Expedition 326, during which a 20 inch casing string was installed in Hole C0002F to 860.3 mbsf (Expedition 326 Scientists, 2011) and continued with Expedition 338 (Strasser, Dugan, Kanagawa, Moore, Toczko, Maeda, and the Expedition 338 Scientists, 2014), which  was  originally  planned  to  deepen  Hole C0002F to 3600 mbsf. However, operations were aborted because of mechanical and weather-related events after drilling to $\sim\!2010$ mbsf. Additional casing was not installed during the expedition, and Hole C0002F was suspended with drilling mud left in the open hole below the 20 inch casing shoe at 860.3 mbsf. The original objective of Expedition 338 was to investigate the properties, structure, and state of stress within the hanging wall above the locked plate boundary at Site C0002 and advance the hole for further deepening during a later expedition. These remained the primary goals of Expedition 348. During Expedition 348, the hole was sidetracked below the 20 inch casing shoe, and the interval to 2300 mbsf (renamed Hole C0002N) was drilled with measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools and cased. It was then sidetracked again (creating Hole C0002P) and drilled  with  limited  coring  and  LWD/MWD  to 3058.5 mbsf. An $11\%$ inch liner was emplaced to 2922.5 mbsf and cemented in to conclude the Expedition 348 operations.  

Site C0002 is the centerpiece of the NanTroSEIZE project, as it is planned to access the plate interface fault system at a location where the fault system is believed to be capable of seismogenic locking and slip and to have slipped coseismically in the 1944 Tonankai earthquake (e.g., Ichinose et al., 2003). This zone also coincides with the location of repeated clusters of very low frequency earthquakes (Ito and Obara, 2006; Sugioka et al., 2012) and of the first tectonic tremor recorded in an accretionary prism setting (Obana and Kodaira, 2009). To access, sample, and monitor these zones along the plate interface, Hole C0002F/N/P was deepened with the ultimate goal of penetrating the plate boundary fault and for the future installation of a long-term observatory (Fig. F5).  

# Background and objectives  

# Geological setting  

The Nankai Trough is formed by subduction of the Philippine Sea plate to the northwest beneath the Eurasian plate at a rate of ${\sim}4.1{-}6.5\ \mathrm{{cm/y}}$ (Fig. F1) (Seno et al., 1993; Miyazaki and Heki, 2001). The convergence direction is slightly oblique to the trench, and Shikoku Basin sediment is actively accreting at the deformation front. The Nankai Trough has been one of the focus sites for studies of seismogenesis by both IODP and the U.S. MARGINS initiative, based on the wealth of geological and geophysical data available. A better understanding of seismic and tsunami behavior at margins such as Nankai is relevant to assessment of hazard to heavily populated coastal areas globally.  

Subduction zones like the Nankai Trough, where most great earthquakes $(\mathrm{Mw}\,>8.0)$ ) occur, are especially favorable for study because the entire downdip width of the seismogenic zone ruptures in major events, suggesting that the zone of coseismic rupture in future large earthquakes may be more predictable than for smaller earthquakes. The Nankai Trough region has a $1300\,\mathrm{y}$ historical record of recurring great earthquakes that are typically tsunamigenic, including the 1944 Tonankai Mw 8.2 and 1946 Nankai Mw 8.3 earthquakes (Fig. F1) (Ando, 1975; Hori et al., 2004). The rupture area and zone of tsunami generation for the 1944 event are now reasonably well understood (Ichinose et al., 2003; Baba et al., 2005). Land-based geodetic studies suggest that currently the plate boundary thrust is strongly locked (Miyazaki and Heki, 2001). Similarly, the relatively low level of microseismicity near the updip limits of the 1940s earthquakes (Obana et al., 2001) implies significant interseismic strain accumulation on the megathrust. However, recent observations of very low frequency earthquakes within or just below the accretionary prism in the drilling area (Obara and Ito, 2005; Sugioka et al., 2012) demonstrate that strain release along the megathrust is not restricted to great earthquakes. Slow slip phenomena, including episodic slow slip events and nonvolcanic tremor (e.g., Schwartz and Rokosky, 2007), are also known to occur near the downdip edge of the great earthquake rupture zone (Ito et al., 2007). In the subducting Philippine Sea plate below the rupture zone, weak seismicity is observed (Obana et al., 2005). Seaward of the subduction zone, deformation of the incoming oceanic crust is suggested by microearthquakes as  documented  by ocean-bottom seismometer studies (Obana et al., 2005).  

The region offshore the Kii Peninsula on Honshu Island was selected for seismogenic zone drilling for several reasons. First, the rupture area of the 1944 Mw 8.2 Tonankai event is well constrained by recent seismic  and  tsunami  waveform  inversions  (e.g., Tanioka and Satake, 2001; Kikuchi et al., 2003). Slip inversion studies suggest that only in this region did past  coseismic  rupture  clearly  extend  shallow enough for drilling (Ichinose et al., 2003; Baba and Cummins, 2005), and an updip zone of large slip has been identified and targeted. The reflector previously identified as the megasplay is now believed to be the main plate boundary fault, with the splay fault branching point up-dip of this location (Fig. F2, F5). Therefore, there may not be a décollement at a deeper position. The so-called megasplay is therefore the primary plate boundary drilling target. Second, ocean-bottom seismometer campaigns and onshore high-resolution geodetic studies (though of short duration) indicate significant interseismic strain accumulation (e.g., Miyazaki and Heki, 2001; Obana et al., 2001). Finally, the drilling targets are within the operational limits of riser drilling by the D/V Chikyu (i.e., maximum of $2500\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth and $7000\mathrm{~m~}$ subseafloor penetration).  

# Seismic studies and site survey data  

A significant volume of site survey data has been collected in the drilling area over many years, including multiple generations of 2-D seismic reflection (e.g., Park et al., 2002), wide-angle refraction (Nakanishi et al., 2002), passive seismicity (e.g., Obana et al., 2001, 2005), heat flow (Yamano et al., 2003), side-scan sonar, swath bathymetry, and submersible and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dive studies (Ashi et al., 2002). In 2006, Japan and the United States conducted a joint 3-D seismic reflection survey over an ${\sim}11~\mathrm{km}\times55~\mathrm{km}$ area, acquired by Petroleum GeoServices (Moore et al., 2009). This 3-D data volume is the first deep-penetration, fully 3-D marine survey ever acquired for basic research purposes and has been used to  

1. Refine selection of drill sites and targets in the complex megasplay fault region,  

2. Define the 3-D regional structure and seismic stratigraphy,   
3. Analyze physical properties of the subsurface through seismic attribute studies, and   
4. Assess drilling safety (Moore et al., 2007, 2009).  

These high-resolution 3-D data are being used in conjunction  with  petrophysical  and  geophysical data obtained from core analyses and both wireline logging and LWD to allow extensive and high-resolution integration of core, logs, and seismic data (e.g., Bangs et al., 2009; Kitajima and Saffer, 2012).  

# Site C0002 summary  

# Scientific objectives  

The primary drilling plan for Expedition 348 was to extend the riser hole at Site C0002 from 860 mbsf to a target depth between 3600 and 4400 mbsf. Because of the unknown condition of the open hole below 860 mbsf left after Expedition 338, a plan was made to sidetrack below the 20 inch casing shoe at 860.3 mbsf and redrill the interval parallel to, but $10{-}20\;\mathrm{m}$ laterally away from, Hole C0002F and then set $13\%$ inch casing and $11\%$ inch liner successively.  

From previous drilling (Fig. F3), it was known that the Kumano forearc basin sedimentary package comprises the interval from 0–940 mbsf and is underlain by deformed sediment of the inner accretionary wedge (e.g., Ashi et al., 2009). The entire zone from \~940 mbsf to the plate boundary reflector at $\mathord{\sim}5200$ mbsf exhibits few coherent seismic reflections that would indicate intact stratal packages, in contrast to the outer accretionary wedge seaward of the Kumano Basin region (Figs. F2, F5; see also Moore et al., 2009). This seismic character was thought to indicate complex deformation within the inner wedge, perhaps best characterized as a subduction mélange or protomélange.  

The main research objectives for this interval were to drill and sample the interior of the accretionary complex in the midslope region beneath the Kumano forearc basin with collection of cores, drill cuttings, and mud gas; collect an extensive suite of LWD logs to characterize the formation; and utilize leak-off test (LOT) and downhole pressure and mudweight data to constrain in situ stress state. Sampling and recording downhole data from this previously unsampled interval was driven by the following specific questions:  

1. What is the thermal, diagenetic, and metamorphic history of the sedimentary rock below the Kumano Basin?   
2. What is the dehydration budget for hydrous minerals (e.g., smectite group clays) and the extent of dehydration reaction progress as a function of depth?   
3. What is the mechanical and structural evolution of the inner wedge?   
4. Are there indicators of zones of low effective stress and/or high pore fluid pressure?   
5. How do the properties of the inner wedge sediments compare with the Shikoku Basin and trench sediments that are input to the wedge?   
6. What are the horizontal stress orientations and magnitude within the deep interior of the inner wedge? How does the stress orientation relate to the current state of the earthquake cycle?   
7. What is the mechanical state and behavior of the formation and how does it relate to the current state of the upper plate above the seismogenic plate boundary thrust?   
8. What are the dominant faulting processes and deformation mechanisms, and how do they vary with depth?  

# Operational results  

During Expedition 348, this plan was carried out with overall success, overcoming numerous borehole stability challenges. Hole C0002N was successfully sidetracked from Hole C0002F at 860.3 mbsf and drilled and cased with $13\%$ inch casing to 2009 mbsf, short of the original 2300 mbsf objective. A stuck and severed bottom-hole assembly (BHA) in the $13\%$ inch casing shoe (see “Operations summary”) necessitated a second sidetrack operation, this time through casing, which was successful. The borehole was then extended to 3058.5 mbsf, including a coring interval of $55.5\mathrm{~m~}$ (reduced from $100\;\mathrm{m}$ because of time constraints) and cased with $11\%$ inch liner to a depth of 2922.5 mbsf, $677.5\mathrm{~m~}$ shallower than the originally planned target. A full suite of LWD logs were collected, as well as cuttings at ${\sim}5$ m intervals and cores from a $55.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interval with overall recovery of $56.7\%$ .  

# Planned operational strategy  

The interval from 860.3 mbsf to the target depth of 3600 mbsf (or as deep as 4400 mbsf, depending on drilling conditions and available time) was to be drilled in riser mode with collection of continuous LWD resistivity, sonic, gamma ray, and annular fluid pressure  logs.  During  riser  drilling,  mud  return would allow for a comprehensive analysis of drill cuttings and mud gas, as was performed at Site C0009 and Hole C0002F and described by Saffer, McNeill, Byrne, Araki, Toczko, Eguchi, Takahashi, and the Expedition 319 Scientists (2010) and Moore et al. (2013), respectively. Coring $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ total) was also planned to sample the inner wedge but was restricted to one interval from 2300 to $2400\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , just below the intended $13\%$ inch casing shoe. After installing the $13\%$ inch casing string to $2400\,\mathrm{\mbsf},$ , planned operations were to conduct a LOT and then drill to 3600 mbsf or more and install $11\%$ inch liner. At the end of Expedition 348, the borehole was to be suspended for reentry and further deepening to the planned plate boundary target during later riser drilling operations.  

Additionally, as a test of the in-development smalldiameter rotary core barrel (SD-RCB) system, a separate riserless hole (C0002M) was to be spudded and drilled to 475 mbsf and cored to 512.5 mbsf (see “Operations summary”; Tables T1, T2). These cores were planned as an engineering test and to compare the core quality to standard RCB cores previously cut from the same interval in Hole C0002B (Ashi et al., 2009); they were to be described and subjected to standard shipboard analysis by the Expedition 348 Scientific Party.  

# Scientific results Lithology  

During Expedition 348, four lithologic units were identified at Site C0002 based on geological and geochemical characteristics of core and cuttings samples (Fig. F4):  

• Unit II (475–512.5 mbsf in Hole C0002M),   
• Unit III (875.5–975.5 mbsf in Hole C0002N), Unit IV (975.5–1665.5 mbsf in Hole C0002N), and Unit V (1665.5–2325.5 mbsf in Hole C0002N and 1965.5–3058.5 mbsf in Hole C0002P).  

Lithologic Unit II is only described in core from Hole C0002M and is dominated by fine-grained turbiditic deposits. Silty claystone is the main lithology, with subordinate fine-grained sandstone and sandy siltstone. Similar to the equivalent interval (also designated Unit II) in nearby Holes C0002B, C0002K, and C0002L, this unit is composed of lower Kumano forearc basin sediment and is dominated by the hemipelagic mud of distal turbidites (Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009).  

Lithologic Unit III, sampled in Hole C0002N (previously  sampled  in  Holes  C0002B,  C0002F,  and C0002J) (Figs. F4, F6A) is dominated by silty claystone with trace amounts of very fine, loose sand containing common glauconite grains. Like Unit II, this unit is also composed of lower Kumano forearc basin sediment.  

Lithologic Unit IV, sampled only in Hole C0002N during Expedition 348 but equivalent to Unit IV sampled and/or logged in Holes C0002A, C00002B, C0002F, C0002H, and C0002J, is dominated by silty claystone, with sandstone as a minor lithology. Sandstone cuttings in this unit are generally very weakly  consolidated  and  occur  as  disaggregated loose sand. Lithologic Unit IV is divided into five subunits based on sand content (Fig. F6A). Lithologic Unit IV is interpreted as the upper accretionary prism, composed of accreted Shikoku Basin hemipelagic deposits or trench fill sediment.  

Lithologic  Unit  V  was  sampled  in  both  Holes C0002N and C0002P (Fig. F6) and is dominated by silty  claystone.  Fine-grained  and  moderately  cemented  sandstone  is  rarely  observed.  In  Hole C0002P, visual estimates of clay content in the silty claystone increase throughout Subunit VA, and the sediment has a finer texture than material sampled nearby in Hole C0002N. The boundary between Subunits VA and VB (2625.5 mbsf) is defined by a fining of grain size and is located at a depth where the dominant lithology changes from silty claystone to fine silty claystone. This unit is interpreted as accreted Shikoku Basin hemipelagic deposits or trench fill sediment of the middle Miocene age trench.  

# Structural geology  

Several key observations were made on cuttings in Holes C0002N and C0002P, along with structural analyses  of  the  limited  cores  retrieved  in  Hole C0002P. Structures observed in intact cuttings (Fig. F7) include slickenlined surfaces, scaly fabric, deformation bands, minor faults, and mineral veins. Slickenlines are observed throughout the entire drilled interval, but scaly fabric is increasingly observed below ${\sim}2200~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . The other types of structures are scattered throughout the section.  

The limited cored interval exhibits steep bedding dips (Fig. F8) ranging from ${\sim}45^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}.$ , consistent with the observation of steep bedding in borehole resistivity image log data (see “Logging”) throughout the interval from 2100–3000 mbsf. A fault zone, 90 cm thick with $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ angular clasts, is present in one of the cores (2204.9–2205.8 mbsf; Fig. F9). In its present position, the brittle fault zone is associated with a normal faulting sense based on kinematic indicators; however, given the very steep bedding dip documented in cores and throughout the hole in log images, it is plausible that this represents an early thrust rotated after its development or a late normal fault developed at or near its present orientation.  

The overall character of the deformation throughout the drilled interval (independent particulate flow with limited evidence for cataclastic deformation) suggests that deformation occurred in a relatively shallow environment $({\sim}0{-}4~\mathrm{~km}$ in burial depth), consistent with the present-day depth of this interval in the inner wedge but not precluding modest structural exhumation.  

Scanning electron microscope observation of cuttings from the upper part of Hole C0002N indicates little evidence for opal diagenesis, implying maximum temperature $(T)<\!60^{\circ}–80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 1225.5 mbsf. In Hole C0002N, the fabric lacks a strongly preferred orientation in clay-rich materials, except along striated microfaults formed by clays. These zones are extremely localized, with a thickness of a few micrometers or less. In Hole C0002P below 2200 mbsf, development of a regularly spaced fabric in sandstones is characterized by thin $({<}0.1–1\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ claydominated shear planes. Below 2625 mbsf, compaction fabrics in clay-rich materials can be observed; this fabric is cut by very thin shear zones with almost no wall damage zone.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Preliminary  biostratigraphy  for  Holes  C0002M, C0002N, and C0002P is based exclusively on the examination  of  calcareous  nannofossils  (Fig.  F10). There is a general pattern of well- to moderately preserved nannofossils in the upper part of the site (475.09–985.50 mbsf) and moderate to poor preservation below 985.50 mbsf. Assemblages recovered from 475.09 to 506.68 mbsf (Hole C0002M) are Pleistocene in age, whereas between 875.50 and 3055.50 mbsf (Holes C0002N and C0002P), assemblages indicate late Pliocene to late Miocene age.  

Calcareous nannofossils were examined in 25 core samples from interval 348-C0002M-1R-1, $9\,\mathrm{\Omegacm}$ , to 4R-3, $86\,\mathrm{cm}$ , and 287 cuttings samples (348-C0002N3-SMW through 327-SMW and 348-C0002P-9-SMW through 300-SMW) were examined. A further 25 core samples from interval 348-C0002P-1R-CC, 20 cm, to 6R-CC, $10\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ , were examined.  

# Hole C0002M  

Cores taken from Hole C0002M from 475.00 to 512.50 mbsf yield very well preserved and abundant calcareous nannofossils, indicating Pleistocene age for the upper part of the section. Assemblages suggest Biozone NN20 and a maximum age of $1.67\ \mathrm{Ma}$ based on the last occurrence of Gephyrocapsa spp. $(<\!3.92\,\mathrm{Ma})$ .  

# Holes C0002N and C0002P  

Cuttings and core samples from Holes C0002N and C0002P between 875.50 and 3055.5 mbsf have assemblages ranging from the late Pliocene to late Miocene. Abundance is lower than in Hole C0002M, and assemblages are less well preserved. Assemblages from Holes C0002N and C0002P show an age range from at least $2.06\ \mathrm{Ma}$ to a maximum of $10.734~\mathrm{Ma}$ , based mainly on the last occurrence and first occurrence, respectively, of Discoaster brouweri. Samples obtained from between 2955.5 and 3055.5 mbsf did not yield any calcareous nannofossil zonal marker species;  therefore,  the  deepest  section  of  Hole C0002P was not dated.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Remanent magnetization of archive-half sections from Hole C0002P was measured at demagnetization levels of 0, 5, 10, 15, and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ peak fields to identify characteristic directions. Demagnetizations of $10{-}15~\mathrm{mT}$ successfully removed low-coercivity components, and magnetic directions after demagnetizations indicate stable constant directions (Fig. F11). Declination, inclination, and intensity profiles after demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ are shown in Figure F12. The declination profile represents widely scattered directions, indicative of “biscuiting” of cores during RCB coring operations. The inclination profile reveals dominantly positive inclinations, and the magnitude of inclination is not constant downhole. For example, the calculated mean inclinations using the method proposed by Arason and Levi (2010) are $34.22^{\circ}$ for  2172.45–2174.955  mbsf, $61.83^{\circ}$ for 2194.005–2196.985 mbsf, and $36.50^{\circ}$ for $2210.0-$ 2215.0 mbsf. Some sections exhibit steep negative inclinations, which occur in relatively short intervals. Interestingly, the 2205.195–2205.515 mbsf interval, which shows a clear negative inclination, corresponds to the brittle fault zone (see “Structural geology”). This result suggests different timing of magnetization for this interval than that of the intervals above and below. In order to elucidate the timing of lock-in of these magnetizations, careful evaluation referencing structural analysis (e.g., bedding) results are required during postcruise study.  

# Geochemistry  

Broadly, geochemical data from Holes C0002N and C0002P support possible important clay-water reactions controlling dissolved cation abundances, the presence of secondary carbonate in faulted sediments, an increase of thermogenic methane with increasing depth, and overall dominance of methane in the gas fraction.  

# Interstitial water analyses  

One $20~\mathrm{cm}$ long whole-round sample for interstitial water was collected from each of the four Hole C0002M cores. Interstitial water samples were obtained  with  a  new $55~\mathrm{~mm}$ diameter Manheim squeezer to conduct tests aimed at defining protocols for maximum squeezing pressure to use on future cores (i.e., to avoid possible stress-induced dehydration of smectite group clays; Fitts and Brown, 1999). Because these cores had been stored in core liner for several weeks, the likelihood of contamination by drilling fluid was very high, and only chlorinities were determined. Step-wise increasing pressures (up to $112\;\;\mathrm{MPa})$ were applied to assess the effect of squeezing on measured chlorinity, and interstitial water was sampled at several different time intervals. Chlorinity values are higher than those observed at the same depth interval $(470.5–500.5\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ during Expedition 338 (average $=377.8\ \mathrm{mM})$ , likely due to contamination, but the range in chlorinity was still low $(397{-}419\,\mathrm{\mM})$ relative to seawater $(559\,\mathrm{\mM})$ . Results from the squeezing experiments show freshening of interstitial water when the same sample was squeezed at higher pressure and for a longer time (Fig. F13). The mechanism that induces the freshening of interstitial water at high pressure is not yet understood, and later shore-based experiments will be conducted.  

Five whole-round samples $(10{-}41.5~\,\mathrm{cm}$ in length) were  collected  from  Hole  C0002P  (Cores  348- C0002P-2R through 6R; 2176.28 to 2211.31 mbsf). Perfluorocarbon tracer data indicate that only Section 348-C0002P-2R-3 had appreciable contamination $(\sim\!5\%)$ by drilling fluid. Samples were processed to obtain pore water using the ground rock interstitial normative determination (GRIND) method as was used during Expedition 338 (Strasser, Dugan, Kanagawa, Moore, Toczko, Maeda, and the Expedition 338 Scientists, 2014). Salinity and chlorinity alternate between high and low values downhole (Fig. F14), a pattern that is paralleled by several other major and minor ions, including $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{r}^{-}.$ , $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ , $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ , $K^{+}.$ , $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ , $C a^{2+}$ , Li, Mn, Ba, Sr, and to a lesser extent Rb and Cs. Although the possibility of localized brines in the formation cannot be excluded, it is unlikely that such large fluctuations in concentrations could occur in samples taken only $^{10\textrm{m}}$ apart. It is more likely that the variations in concentrations are related to interaction between interstitial water and rock during core retrieval and sample processing with the GRIND method, perhaps related to variations in clay mineralogy among samples. Two sections (348-C0002P-3R-2 and 5R-2) yielded ion concentrations within interstitial water ranges observed at shallower depths in Holes C0002B and C0002J, with chlorinities of 428 and $387~\mathrm{mM}$ , respectively. If correct, the very low values observed in Hole C0002P require substantial freshening relative to typical seawater values $\langle556~\mathrm{mM})$ , and at these depths and in situ temperatures the only likely potential source is dehydration of clay-bound waters or opaline silica.  

Further analysis is necessary to evaluate the significance of the GRIND data.  

# Carbonate, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and carbon/nitrogen ratios  

Carbonates (as ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3})$ ), total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) were analyzed on 15 samples from the four cores from Hole C0002M. ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ ranges from 4.26 to $13.67\:\mathrm{\Delta~wt^{0}/o}$ , and the median $(6.24\;\mathrm{wt\%})$ is higher than the two values determined in the same interval from Hole C0002L during Expedition 338 (6.1 and $1.4~\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). TOC is low (0.46–0.82 $\mathrm{wt\%})$ ) and decreases slightly with depth. TOC and TN are similar to those reported from Expedition 338; the low TOC/TN ratio values in Hole C0002M indicate a marine origin for the organic matter.  

In Holes C0002N and C0002P, ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}.$ , TOC, and TN were determined from the 1–4 and $>\!4\mathrm{\mm}$ cuttings size fractions (Fig. F15). Excluding intervals contaminated by artificial cement derived from the area around the casing shoe, ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ varies from 0.46 to $9.6~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (median $=3.2~\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Carbonate abundance generally decreases downhole. A prominent maximum is observed around 1920.5 mbsf, where ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ is as high as $7.94\:\mathrm{\wt\%}$ . A broader maximum at 2620.5 mbsf shows ${\mathrm{CaCO}}_{3}$ values as high as 5.80 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Cuttings from these depth intervals contain fragments of carbonate veins and sediment with veins, suggesting the local increases in carbonate are associated with fault or fracture zones. The abundant carbonate observed in the fault zone in Core 348- C0002P-5R, however, was not evident in the cuttings from the same interval, likely because the signal from the thin fault zone was diluted by mixing of cuttings over a ${\sim}5{-}10\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interval. Increases in CaO and MnO observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) data at both carbonate maxima are consistent with the observed increase in $C a C O_{3}$ and possibly the presence of Mn-bearing carbonate.  

In Hole $\mathrm{C}0002\mathrm{M}$ core samples, TOC is low (0.46– $0.82\mathrm{\,\wt\%}$ ) and decreases slightly with depth. TOC and TN are similar to Expedition 338. The low TOC/ TN ratio values indicate a marine origin for the organic matter. In Holes C0002N and C0002P, TOC values range from 0.47 to $2.07\,\mathrm{\,\,wt\%}$ (median $=0.9$ wt%) and gradually decrease with depth (Fig. F15). TOC values at the bottom of Hole C0002N (2040– 2320 mbsf) do not overlap those at the beginning of Hole C0002P, even though data for $C a C O_{3}$ and TN do match in the overlapping interval. Data from core samples in Hole C0002P are in closer agreement with those of cuttings from Hole C0002P than with cuttings from Hole C0002N. The relatively high TOC/  

TN ratios (7.58–35.58; median $=17.53\$ ) suggest most of the organic matter is of terrestrial origin. In contrast, TOC/TN in Hole C0002P core samples tend toward a marine origin except for two samples from Sections 348-C0002P-2R-4 and 6R-4. Thus, the high TOC/TN ratios in cuttings might reflect contamination by drilling fluid.  

# Headspace gas and mud-gas results  

Drilling mud-gas monitoring took place continuously while drilling Holes C0002N (838–2330 mbsf) and C0002P (1954–3058 mbsf). The drilling mud-gas was analyzed for alkanes (methane, ethane, propane, etc.) and nonhydrocarbon $(^{222}\mathrm{{Rn}}$ , He, $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ Xe, $\Nu_{2}.$ , $\mathrm{O}_{2},$ etc.) gases by GeoServices and by using the scientific drilling mud-gas monitoring system onboard the Chikyu (SciGas system). In Hole C0002N, measurements from the SciGas system yielded lower hydrocarbon gas concentrations compared to the data from GeoServices. Before starting Hole C0002P, the SciGas system was improved, leading to relatively higher gas concentrations and better detection of relative changes in the gas composition in that hole. Headspace gas samples from Hole C0002M and C0002P cores were dominated by methane, which was as high as 7,354 and $23,455~\mathrm{ppm}$ , respectively. Concentrations found in headspace gas samples were up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the drilling mud-gas samples from the same interval, indicating underestimation of formation hydrocarbon abundances by the real-time mud-gas monitoring.  

Total mud-gas concentrations were dominated by methane, with maximum concentrations of ${\sim}8\%$ at around 1305 mbsf (see Fig. F71 in the “Site $C0002^{\prime\prime}$ chapter [Tobin et al., 2015]). Downhole gas concentrations steadily declined to $<\!0.2\%$ and rose again at \~2184 mbsf. Overall, ethane and propane were only present in minor concentrations, and higher homologs (i.e., $_n$ -butane, $i$ -butane, $_n$ -pentane, and $i\-$ -pentane) typically remained ${<}0.01\%$ . Starting at 2200 mbsf, ethane and propane steadily increase with depth. Over the same interval, the Bernard parameter $\left(\mathrm{C}_{1}/[\mathrm{C}_{2}\;+\;\mathrm{C}_{3}]\right)$ showed an overall decline with depth and when combined with the methane carbon isotope ratio, indicated the onset of a thermogenic regime at $\mathord{\sim}1700$ mbsf (see Fig. F80 in the “Site $C0002^{\prime\prime}$ chapter [Tobin et al., 2015]). A clear thermogenic signature was reached at \~2325 mbsf.  

Nonhydrocarbon gases were dominated by atmospheric components $(\mathrm{N}_{2}+\mathrm{O}_{2}=98.3\%)$ , which is consistent with an overall $\mathrm{N}_{2}/\mathrm{Ar}$ ratio ${<}100$ . Hydrogen was detected at values up to $0.78\%$ at $\mathord{\sim}3043$ mbsf, and $^{222}\mathrm{Rn}$ values typically remained below $450\;\mathrm{Bq}/\mathrm{m}^{3}$ .  

# Physical properties  

Shipboard physical property measurements, including moisture and density (MAD), electrical conductivity, $P$ -wave velocity, natural gamma radiation, and magnetic susceptibility, were performed on cuttings samples from 870.5 to 3058.5 mbsf and on core samples from 2163 and 2218.5 mbsf.  

MAD measurements were conducted on seawaterwashed cuttings (“bulk cuttings”) in two size fractions, ${>}4$ and $1{-}4\,\mathrm{~mm}$ from 870.5 to 3058.5 mbsf and handpicked intact cuttings from the ${>}4~\mathrm{mm}$ size fractions from 1222.5 to 3058.5 mbsf (Fig. F16). The bulk cuttings show grain density of $2.68{-}2.72\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , bulk density of $1.9{-}2.0~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and porosity of $50\%-$ $35\%$ . The intact cuttings show almost the same grain density $(2.66{-}2.70~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ but have higher bulk density $(2.05{-}2.41~\mathrm{~g/cm^{3}})$ and lower porosity $(37\%-$ $18\%)$ ) than the bulk cuttings. The grain density agreement suggests that the measurements on both bulk cuttings and intact cuttings are of good quality, and the differences in porosity and density are real. It is likely that the values from the bulk cuttings are affected strongly by artifacts of the drilling process. Thus, the bulk density and porosity data on intact cuttings probably better represent true formation properties. Combined with MAD measurements on handpicked intact cuttings and discrete core samples from previous expeditions, porosity generally decreases from ${\sim}60\%$ to ${\sim}20\%$ from the seafloor to 3000 mbsf at Site C0002.  

Electrical conductivity and $P$ -wave velocity of discrete samples, which were prepared from both cuttings and core samples from 1745.5–3058.5 mbsf, range between 0.15 and $0.9\ \mathrm{S/m}$ and 1.7 and $4.5~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}_{\cdot}$ , respectively. The electrical resistivity (a reciprocal of conductivity) of discrete samples is generally higher than the LWD resistivity data, but the overall depth trends are similar. The $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocity of discrete samples is lower than the LWD $P$ -wave velocity (see “Logging”) between 2200 and 2600 mbsf, whereas the two are in close agreement deeper than 2600 mbsf.  

# Logging  

# Log data acquisition  

The LWD data included natural gamma ray, electrical resistivity logs, electrical resistivity images, sonic velocity, and sonic caliper logs (Fig. F17). These data were collected together with MWD data from 859.5 to 2329.3 mbsf (2827.0–4296.8 m below rotary table (BRT) in Hole C0002N and from 2162.5 to 3058.5 mbsf (4130–5026 m BRT) in Hole C0002P. Data from the two runs overlapped between 1962.6 and 2008.5 mbsf (between 3930.2 and $3976\,\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT). In Hole C0002P, LWD data were collected after coring was conducted from 2163 to 2218.5 mbsf (4130.5–4186 m BRT). The cored interval was logged as the borehole was reamed and enlarged from $10\sqrt{8}$ to $12\%$ inch diameter, and then the formation below was logged as the borehole was newly drilled.  

There were four major occurrences of long exposure times during the drilling of Hole C0002N (1205– 1221, 1662–1678, 1992–2008, and 2022–2038 mbsf). Resistivity values at these depth ranges are both noisy and anomalously low. In Hole C0002P, resistivity data in the cored interval show possible signs of minor mud filtrate invasion and/or wellbore failure.  

# Hole C0002N  

# Log data characterization and interpretations  

Log Units I–III were identified during Expeditions 314 and 332 for Hole C0002A and C0002G (Expedition 314 Scientists, 2009; Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011). During Expedition 338, the bottom of Unit III was identified in Hole C0002F (Strasser et al., 2014); this was also the first unit drilled during Expedition 348 in Hole C0002N (Fig. F17A).  

Log Unit III (859.5–915.0 mbsf) (Fig. F18) has an average gamma ray value of $61.6\,\mathrm{\gAPI}$ and shows a general trend of gamma ray increase of ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{\gAPI}$ down to the basal boundary at 915.0 mbsf. There, a drop of ${\sim}25~\mathrm{gAPI}$ is interpreted as a change in lithology from clay-dominated sediment at the base of Unit III to sandier hemipelagic sediment at the top of Unit IV.  

Gamma ray and resistivity data show the largest variability in log Unit IV, with average gamma ray values of $66.5~\mathrm{gAPI}$ . We defined five subunits based on overall trends in log response and comparison with the subunits defined during Expedition 338 in Hole C0002F. The base of Unit IV shows a sharp change in the average natural radioactivity to higher values.  

Log Unit V (1656.3–total depth) is interpreted to be homogeneous and clay rich overall, based on the relatively small fluctuation of log responses and the uniformly high gamma ray values, in agreement with the descriptions of core and cuttings lithologies (see “Lithology”). Three subunits were defined in Log Unit V based on variations in log responses that reflect the amount of silt and (occasionally) sand. Gamma ray values average around 86 gAPI throughout Unit V, with variations of up to $28\ {\mathrm{gAPI}}$ . The log Unit IV/V boundary at 1656.3 mbsf is marked by a shift of ${\sim}20~\mathrm{gAPI}$ in the gamma ray data and a local spike in resistivity.  

# Correlation with previous Site C0002 LWD data  

We correlated LWD data from Hole C0002F with Hole C0002N, with a vertical offset (depth shift) of $\sim\!16\,\textrm{m}$ . Different tools were used, however, leading to potential differences in data quality, resolution, and accuracy. The comparison and correlation is based on natural gamma radioactivity and resistivity. Previously  collected  resistivity  images,  including bedding and structural interpretation, were only available for Holes C0002A and C0002F. Comparison with preliminary analysis of Hole C0002P images confirms that log Units IV and V are highly deformed. The log Unit III/IV boundary was correlated between Holes C0002A and C0002F (Fig. F19). Measurements of bedding in both holes suggest that the boundary between Units III and IV is an unconformity, as reported previously (Moore et al., 2013). Because Unit IV has more variability in log response, due to the complex geology and relatively variable lithology (from predominantly claystone to silt and sand), it was difficult to match in detail, but overall trends were consistent in all data sets. The top of logging Unit V is a very sharp boundary in both Holes C0002N and C0002F. Both holes are marked by a ${\sim}20~\mathrm{gAPI}$ shift in gamma ray values and changes in resistivity response. The boundary is offset by $18.3\;\mathrm{m}$ between the two holes. Image logs reveal a heavily deformed section around this boundary, suggesting that the offset may be structurally related.  

# Hole C0002P  

# Log data characterization and interpretation  

No major or abrupt change was identified in the log data acquired over the Hole C0002P interval; therefore, changes in trends of log response and values are interpreted as relatively minor in terms of lithology. Only subunits, likely caused by tectonic structure rather  than  lithologic  variability,  were  defined within this interval of logging Unit V.  

From the top to the bottom of the section, LWD tools recorded an increasing trend in gamma radiation $(75{\-}95~\mathrm{\gAPI})$ , with decreasing resistivity followed by an increasing trend toward the bottom of the borehole. Compressional acoustic slowness (or velocity) shows constant or slightly decreasing velocity from top to bottom. Within shorter intervals, the overall decrease in velocity is the result of discrete steps in velocity (Fig. F20). The most prominent drops in velocity can be identified toward the bottom of logging Subunit Ve.  

The logging subunit boundaries we define in Hole C0002P are based on the log character and relative values for the same depth intervals and in the absence of significant compositional changes described from cuttings (see “Lithology”). We interpreted the background lithology as hemipelagic silty claystone with relatively constant gamma ray values. Variations in the overall trend seen as excursions and spikes in log values are interpreted as permeable sands, cemented sands or veins, or potential ash layers. The depth intervals for log subunits are shown on Table T3 together with the average, minimum, and maximum values of gamma radioactivity, resistivity, and acoustic slowness/velocity.  

# Resistivity image interpretation  

# Bedding and structures  

Bedding orientations could be measured and characterized throughout the logged interval, with gaps in coverage only at strongly deformed zones where bedding planes are not recognizable in the image logs. Bedding dips predominantly steeply $\mathrm{^{60^{\circ}}}$ to $90^{\circ}$ ) to the northwest (Fig. F21). Locally, south- to southeast-dipping beds are also noted, especially between 2600 and 2750 mbsf. Due to the severity of dip changes and high density of fractures and faults, we interpret this section to be strongly structurally deformed. A decrease in dip angle was observed from 2860 mbsf $(\mathrm{-}90^{\circ})$ to 3040 mbsf $(\mathord{\sim}60^{\circ})$ at the bottom of the logged section.  

The overall structure defined by bedding and structure interpretation suggests that the drilled interval intersects several faulted blocks. Fractures and faults are generally steeply dipping with a range of dips between ${\sim}30^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ and a wide range of orientations. Fracture density varies with depth, with the highest concentration in the lower section of logging Subunit Vd. Numerous faults with minimal throw or microfaults were also observed.  

# Wellbore failures  

The most obvious and prominent wellbore failures were concentrated in the upper $67~\textrm{m}$ of Hole C0002P, where the borehole experienced a long exposure time from previous drilling and coring (Fig. F22). From 2150 to 2163 mbsf, the borehole is nearly washed out, although resistivity images indicate a preferential  development  of  northwest–southeast breakouts. This section was drilled for coring operations and was then drilled out and widened during LWD recording. Breakout widths (defined as the full angular width of one breakout of the pair) average $95^{\circ}$ and reach a maximum of $140^{\circ}$ . In the cored section between 2163 and $2218.5~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\cdot}$ , clear continuous breakouts were observed in the same northwest– southeast direction as higher in the hole but with moderate angular widths (average $=\,70^{\circ},$ ). Here, a borehole  cross-section  from  sonic  caliper  data showed enlargement of borehole diameter in an orientation consistent with the breakouts identified in the image log. For the upper cored section (shallower than $2218.5~\mathrm{\mbsf{)}}$ , the length-weighted average value of the breakout azimuths is in the $\mathrm{N}35^{\circ}\mathrm{W}/\$ $S35^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ direction. This suggests that the direction of the maximum horizontal principal stress $\left(S_{\mathsf{H m a x}}\right)$ in the upper $68.5\mathrm{~m~}$ of the imaged well is likely northeast–southwest,  although  the  interplay  between wellbore failure and mechanical anisotropy caused by steeply dipping bedding requires more detailed postcruise analysis.  

Below $2163\,\mathrm{\mbsf}$ , the occurrences of wellbore failures were sparse, and where present their widths are much smaller (average $=23^{\circ}$ ) compared to the depth ranges above. With the exception of several features identified shallower than 2600 mbsf, it was not possible to conclusively classify these features as breakouts even with the aid of sonic caliper data, although their orientations are consistent with those observed shallower in the hole. Some narrow wellbore failures observed toward the bottom of the hole appear different from the breakouts above and may possibly be drilling-induced tensile fractures.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Because the primary scientific target of the Site C0002 riser drilling is the plate boundary fault zone at depth, the most important objectives of Expedition 348 were a hybrid of (1) technical milestones in the form of achieving a depth and casing target for future deepening and (2) scientific goals of investigating the structure, lithology, physical properties, fluid content, and state of stress in the middle of the inner wedge.  

# Technical objectives  

The highest priority requirement for this expedition was to deepen the hole and set the stage so that the main target reflector at ${\sim}4600{-}5200$ mbsf could be reached in future riser drilling. Toward this end, we had a goal to extend the cased borehole from 860 to $3600\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , bypassing the uncased zone from Expedition 338 drilling of Hole C0002F (2006 mbsf total depth) through a sidetrack below the 20 inch casing shoe (Fig. F5), and install $13\%$ inch casing and $11\%$ inch liner to reach that intermediate total depth with a stabilized borehole. Despite multiple operational difficulties and, at times, unstable borehole conditions, the $13\%$ inch casing was successfully cemented into place at 2008.9 mbsf, slightly shallower than the planned 2300 mbsf target. A stuck and severed BHA in the $13\%$ inch casing shoe (see “Operations summary”) necessitated a second sidetrack operation,  this  time  through  casing,  which  was successful. The borehole was extended to 3058.5 mbsf and cased with $11\%$ inch liner at $2922.5~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , $677.5\mathrm{~m~}$ shallower than the planned target. Cementing of this liner was a challenge and required a cement squeeze job, but indications are that the liner was successfully cemented into place.  

While it was a disappointment that the full depth objective was not met, it is a substantial achievement that the main borehole was extended and cased more than $2060\ \mathrm{m}$ beyond its previous depth. Holes C0002F, C0002N, and C0002P now constitute the deepest hole ever drilled (and cased) in scientific ocean drilling. With the $11\%$ inch shoe shallower than 3000 mbsf depth, reanalysis of the casing plan to reach total depth will be required, but we believe the 5200 mbsf target can still be met in this hole. For these well engineering aspects, the expedition can therefore be deemed a strong partial success.  

# Scientific objectives  

Our goals included characterizing the materials, architecture, and ambient conditions (stress, pore pressure, and chemistry) of the interior of the inner wedge with a suite of LWD logs including images, cuttings analysis, and ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{m}$ of core samples. In reality, a comprehensive LWD suite was obtained, and high-quality logs were recorded that have yielded a wealth of information on bedding and fracture orientation, formation seismic velocity, resistivity, natural gamma radiation, and borehole shape via the novel continuous ultrasonic caliper. These data sets have been (or are being) used to address all planned goals. Cuttings analysis was carried out in greater detail, with refined techniques relative to all previous scientific ocean drilling efforts and has yielded lithologic, structural, and physical properties information at ${\sim}5{-}10\ \mathrm{m}$ resolution. This effort succeeded beyond initial expectations; in particular, the analysis of physical properties such as porosity and $P_{\cdot}$ -wave velocity on cuttings yielded better than expected results owing to refined techniques used with care by a skilled team. The detailed analysis of structural fabrics in cuttings by optical and scanning electron microscopy methods was also a somewhat unexpected bright spot. Overall, experience has greatly improved the handling of cuttings since Expeditions 319 and 338. Collection of annular pressure-while-drilling data LOTs at the upper casing shoe and just below the $13\%$ inch casing sidetrack and analysis of drilling mud data from riser operations provided additional valuable constraints on in situ stress magnitudes and rock properties and, with additional analyses, may potentially constrain in situ pore fluid pressure.  

Because of time lost to operational delays, coring was limited to ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and six cores. More cores would have been preferable to provide material needed for high-priority postexpedition studies of rock properties to best address both scientific and well engineering objectives, but the cores still afforded a wealth of information on the geology of the inner wedge. It was hoped that the cores would yield usable pore water for geochemical analysis; however, the sediment proved to be too strong and low in porosity to yield water. The GRIND method produced mixed results (see “Geochemistry”) and overall was clearly inferior to direct pore water analysis. This was somewhat disappointing  and  suggests  that  the  utility  and methods of pore water analysis will need to be reevaluated for future deep drilling.  

In summary, during Expedition 348, we met our goals of characterizing the deep interior of the inner accretionary wedge in full over the (somewhat reduced) interval that was drilled and sampled. The operational goal of advancing the borehole and leaving it in a stable cased state ready for further deepening also was completed, albeit ${\sim}677\,\mathrm{~m~}$ shallower than initially planned.  

# Operations summary  

# Transit from Shimizu (port)  

Expedition 348 began on 13 September 2013 and ended on 29 January 2014. The Chikyu left the port of Shimizu en route for Site C0002. Typhoon Manyi’s approach on 14 September sent the Chikyu into waiting on weather (WOW) status; the Chikyu remained in WOW status until 16 September and then returned to Site C0002, arriving on 17 September. Upon return to Site C0002, operations began with an ROV dive in Hole C0002F, and then preparation for coring tests with the new coring tool began.  

# Hole C0002M  

Pressure tests of the riser joints were required, so the riser running equipment was rigged down to prepare for testing the SD-RCB assembly. Although designated the “small-diameter” coring tool, the SD-RCB core is actually larger than standard RCB cores (7.3 versus $6.6\ \mathrm{cm}$ inner diameter); the bit itself has a smaller diameter, $8\%$ inch versus the standard $10\%$ inch (or larger) drill bits. The coring BHA (Table T4) was run into the hole on 19 September 2013. Hole C0002M drilling began from 30.5 mbsf $1996.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT). By 21 September, the BHA had drilled ahead to 475 mbsf, and coring began from that depth (Tables T1, T2), cutting four cores and ending at 512.5 mbsf (final total depth). After coring operations were complete, the BHA was pulled out of hole and recovered to the surface on 22 September.  

# Hole C0002F  

The rig up for riser running began, and the ROV dove to deploy transponders. Pressure tests of riser joints continued until all were secured for another standby at Shionomisaki for WOW until 25 September. The Chikyu returned to the Site C0002 blow-out preventer (BOP) running point, $15\ \mathrm{mi}$ northwest of Site C0002 and prepared to run the BOP and riser. From 26 September 2013, the BOP was run down while low-pressure $(300\,\mathrm{\,psi})$ tests of the auxiliary line (kill and choke lines) began. The tests failed and troubleshooting began; it was not until 28 September that all the lines passed low-pressure and highpressure (5000 psi) tests. The BOP, however, was landed on the BOP cart for transit to Mikawa Bay on 29 September to pick up the repaired riser joint. The Chikyu returned to the Site C0002 BOP running point once loading was completed. On 1 October, however, the approach of Tropical Storm Fitow returned the Chikyu to WOW status until the storm track and an unrelated weather front were observed. The LWD tools were loaded from supply boat during WOW.  

Full operations resumed on 5 October; however, two typhoons (Wipha and Francesco) passed by the site, requiring standby and standoff with the disconnected lower marine riser package (LMRP) from the wellhead. Operations resumed on 26 October, when the LMRP was run into the water. The vessel moved to the well center (water depth $=1967.5\;\mathrm{m}$ BRT, 1939 m mud depth below sea level [MSL] and successfully landed and locked the LMRP on the BOP by 31 October. BOP Yellow control pod (POD) pressure tests and Blue POD function tests were conducted on 1 November. The 17 inch LWD and GeoPilot BHA was made up and run in the hole on 2 November, drilling through the two cement plugs. Drilling continued to 850.5 mbsf, when a pressure test of the 20 inch casing was conducted.  

# Hole C0002N  

After circulation for hole cleaning, the sidetrack for Hole C0002N began at 860.3 mbsf on 4 November 2013. Sidetracking continued until the drilling inclination and azimuth reached $5^{\circ}$ and $0^{\circ}$ , respectively. On 5 November at 1191.5 mbsf, inclination was changed to $0^{\circ}$ . There were many occurrences of mud loss, overpull, and WOW while drilling both Holes C0002N and C0002P (Table T5). Drilling halted on 9 November (at ${\sim}1856~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) when the real-time MWD signal was lost. After several attempts to recover the signal, it was decided to continue drilling without real-time monitoring to 2008.5 mbsf. On 10 November, the LWD BHA was pulled to the rig floor to remove the GeoPilot from the BHA, dump the LWD memory data, replace the MWD pulser, and perform maintenance on the mud pump. The new 17 inch LWD BHA was run into the hole, and drilling resumed from 2008.5 mbsf on 11 November. Target depth was reached at 2330 mbsf on 13 November. On 15 November the LWD BHA was pulled out of the hole, laid down, and LWD memory data were downloaded. Preparations to run and cement the $13\%$ inch casing began. On 18 November, the casing hanger joint was picked up and the $13\%$ inch casing was run in hole (RIH). Running $13\%$ inch casing continued to 1993.5 mbsf without observing significant drag. Tight spots were encountered while running the casing string, and the casing became stuck at 2024.5 mbsf. Despite all efforts, the casing needed to be pulled back and shortened by 25 casing joints, and a new pressure-assisted drill pipe running tool assembly was made up on 21 November. Running the shortened $13\%$ inch casing began; no drag larger than $100~\mathrm{{kN}}$ was observed while running to 1502 mbsf. However, minor mud loss was observed at 1994.5 mbsf. The casing hanger was landed onto the wellhead on 22 November with the $13\%$ inch casing shoe set at 2010 mbsf. The casing was cemented, followed by a 5500 psi pressure test. The BOP Blue POD function and pressure tests were completed by 24 November.  

The $12\%$ inch drill-out cement BHA was made up, run into the hole, and tagged the top of cement at 1897.7 mbsf on 25 November. After a short halt in operations for WOW, operations resumed with 1.13 specific gravity (sg) drilling mud. Top of cement was tagged, mud was circulated bottoms up, and a casing pressure test began. The pressure test was completed, and preparations for drilling out cement started. On 27 November, drilling confirmed the presence of cement at $2008.5\ \mathrm{mbsf}_{\cdot}$ , and rig up for the shoe bond test began. The test was successful, and the drill string was pressurized to an equivalent mud weight of $1.25~\mathrm{sg}$ for 5 min. Drilling out cement continued, but when drilling reached 2028.4 mbsf, weight on bit (WOB) and the Hydralift power swivel (HPS; National Oilwell Varco) torque became unstable, fluctuating and suddenly increasing. The pipe was stuck, and attempts to free the pipe by jarring began, pausing only for derrick inspection. The Schlumberger free point indicator tool was rigged up to test for the exact stuck point in preparation for freeing the drill pipe by controlled explosion to allow the pipe to be backed off at a specified joint. The back-off tool broke the drill pipe at 1886.35 mbsf. The colliding tool was recovered, the drill string was pulled to the surface on 30 November, and the back-off point was confirmed and examined. Although seemingly undamaged, the pipe joint was marked and removed from use. Recovery attempts by fishing for the remaining portion of the BHA began from 1 December. After the fish had been jarred 724 times up and 173 times down with no signs of success, the Schlumberger free point indicator tool was rigged up again and confirmed the free pipe point at 1963 mbsf. The colliding tool was run into the hole to $1960.58\,\mathrm{\mbsf},$ calibrated the firing depth, and fired. Circulation and bottom-up circulation from 4 December was completed while the Schlumberger wireline tools were rigged down. The collided drill collar was recovered on deck on 5 December, and a quick examination of the drill collar pin end found that its outer diameter had expanded by 9/16 inch (from $8\%$ to $9\%_{6}$ inches); the pin thread also expanded and cracked.  

The decision was made to kick off through the $13\%$ inch casing and begin a new sidetrack to continue drilling. The casing was scraped with a scraper BHA and then pulled out of the hole and laid for Schlumberger cement bond log wireline runs to confirm cement levels outside the casing, which is required for the window sidetrack milling. The cement bond log was run on 7 December and confirmed cement to 1352.5 mbsf. Time was spent with a milling BHA to certify the fish depth (1948 mbsf) before setting a bridge plug and whipstock, and beginning window cutting in the $13\%$ inch casing. Testing with a wireline run found a slight discrepancy $(\sim\!2\textrm{m})$ in bridge plug depths, so another run with the casing collar locator wireline confirmed the top of plug depth at 1949.5 mbsf. Wireline recovery and rig down was completed early on 9 December.  

Between 9 and 11 December, the Chikyu performed an emergency disconnect sequence and dismantled the HPS for a magnetic particle inspection of the main shaft of the main power unit. On 11 December, the Chikyu returned to the well to land the LMRP and return to milling out with the whipstock BHA. Once it was set at 1945.5 mbsf on 14 December, window milling in the $13\%$ inch casing began.  

# Hole C0002P  

Hole C0002P begins at $1936.5\ \mathrm{mbsf}_{.}$ , the top of the milling window. Milling out continued to 1954.5 mbsf, stopping to ream and dress the window so that the BHA could freely pass through. After dressing, two LOTs were run. After completion, mud weight was increased to $1.18~\mathrm{sg}$ . The milling BHA was pulled from the hole, and the kick-off BHA was made up and run into the hole on 16 December 2013. The $12\%$ inch sidetrack kick-off BHA began alternate rotation and sliding forward to increase inclination and offset from Hole C0002N, while mud weight was raised to $1.23~\mathrm{sg}$ . As with Hole C0002N, several short periods of stuck pipe and WOW occurred during drilling (Table T5). Mud weight was raised to $1.28\;{\mathrm{sg}},$ as the kick-off inclination finally reached $3.9^{\circ}$ by $2107.5\,\mathrm{\mbsf}$ (sensor depth, $16.35\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the bit) and dropped off by 2162.5 mbsf. After sweeping out the hole, the kick-off BHA was pulled to the rig floor on 21 December. RCB coring operations (Table T1) ran from 22 to 24 December (2163.0–2218.5 mbsf; 6 cores; Tables T2, T4). The RCB BHA was pulled from the hole and laid down on 25 December and replaced with a $12\%$ inch LWD BHA that was run into the hole on 26 December. However, on 27 December, when the bit reached 2263 mbsf, MWD data telemetry stopped. All troubleshooting attempts failed, so from 28 December it was decided to drill ahead without real-time monitoring. Drilling (with short wiper trips) proceeded to 3058.5 mbsf by 31 December.  

Hole C0002P was advanced with relatively little trouble during drilling to total depth, but had numerous overpulls and packoffs during wiper trips and hole cleaning operations (Table T5); each time, the pipe was freed after dropping pumping pressure and working the drill pipe. Drilling of the hole to 3058.5 mbsf was completed by 1 January 2014; a heavy load of cavings continued to arrive at the shale shakers even when not making new hole. The HPS stalled three times while working pipe while making connections, and mud weight was increased to 1.32 sg. On 2 January, the LWD BHA was recovered on deck and memory data were downloaded. Gamma ray, annular pressure-while-drilling, and resistivity data were recovered by $0545\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , and azimuthal sonic data were recovered by $0615\;\mathrm{h}$ , but the azimuthal focused resistivity data recovery port was damaged, preventing data download. Data download required shipping the azimuthal focused resistivity tool to the Halliburton base in Thailand.  

Reaming out the open hole to $14\%$ inches was performed with the Anderreamer underreamer BHA from 2 January. No logging tools were part of this BHA. The underreamer began reaming open the $12\%$ inch hole to $14\%$ inches from 1963.5 mbsf. Reaming down occasionally paused for mud pump maintenance. Hole opening continued, with nothing more than traces of gas and cavings encountered throughout this period of drilling. From 8 January, several episodes of HPS stalling at 2867.5 mbsf from heave increase were noted. Another cold front weather system required pulling out of the hole for WOW to above the BOP for standby. The cold front passed, and WOW continued until 9 January. On 10 January, reaming up and down encountered frequent HPS stalls, tight spots, and one hole pack-off at 2902.5 mbsf. The pack-off initially had no mud return, but continuously working the pipe and reducing pumping pressure eventually freed the pipe by $1500\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . Backreaming and hole opening operations continued to 12 January, when the Anderreamer underreamer BHA was recovered on deck; the reamer cutters were excessively worn and damaged. A new underreamer BHA was rigged up and run into the hole. Once the BHA reached 1957.5 mbsf, the Anderreamer was activated. A series of issues with the mud pumps impacting drilling, with frequent pauses in drilling to swab out and replace cylinders of the mud pumps. Reaming downhole resumed and by 14 January had reached 2960.5 mbsf. Hole opening had progressed $4\textrm{m}$ when the hole packed off, leaving the drill pipe stuck in the hole. Operations to free the pipe began immediately, with firing jars, spotting lube, and pulling until the pipe was freed. Sweeping the hole began and circulation and bottoms-up was finished by 15 January. The BHA continued in a series of wiper trips and reaming, reaching 2964.5 mbsf by $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ . Circulation and bottoms-up to clean the hole began and continued until 16 January. It was decided to spot Hi-vis mud $(30\;\mathrm{m}^{3})$ and pull the underreamer to the surface; the BHA was laid down by $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

With reaming and drilling complete, running and cementing the $11\%$ inch liner began. On 18 January, the liner was run to $966.5\mathrm{~m~}$ MSL while setting the guide shoe joint, float collar joint, landing collar joint, and the $3\%$ inch ball in the float collar joint. No drag was observed while running casing. Slack was checked and weight picked up before circulating after breaking pipe to drop the $1\%$ inch ball. Setting the liner hanger began; the first three attempts to set the hanger failed. After picking up $1\textrm{m}$ and applying pressure, it was confirmed that the hanger had been released. However, it soon became clear that the liner-casing packer had also set when circulation attempts failed. Pressure tests confirmed that the annulus pressure was holding (up to $7.8\;\mathrm{\:MPa})$ ), and there was no communication with the formation below. Two LOTs were performed, the second ending in an injection test. The liner packer was pressure tested at 5000 psi for 5 min and then at 4000 psi for 15 min; both tests passed. After the LOTs the liner hanger running tool was pulled to surface, laying out the cement stand on 19 January. The first of two cement “squeezes” was completed early on 20 January. After squeezing, the diverter was pulled from the hole and Hi-vis mud was spotted. The diverter assembly was pulled to surface, and the cement plug was pressure tested on 21 January.  

Riser recovery began, and the BOP was disconnected from the wellhead on 22 January while the ROV set the corrosion cap and recovered transponders. By 23 January, the gooseneck and termination joints had been recovered and riser joints proper began to be recovered; the BOP was recovered and set on the BOP cart by 25 January. The ROV dove to complete transponder recovery. Once complete, the ROV was recovered to the surface while riser-handling tools were rigged down and general rig equipment services were performed. The Chikyu left the site on 29 January for facilities in Irago, Aichi Prefecture (Japan).

Figure F7. A, B. Depth distribution of percentage of deformation structures in intact cutting samples, Holes C0002N and C0002P. For each depth, this percentage is obtained by dividing the number of cuttings that show any deformation structures by the number of investigated cuttings. In turn, the relative contribution of slickenlines, veins, deformation bands, scaly fabric, and minor faults is represented as a percentage of the deformed cuttings along the bar that represents each sample. Dashed line is the mean value of percentage of deformation structures calculated from samples with ${>}20$ cuttings of retrieved intact cuttings ( $16\%$ for Hole C0002N and $21\%$ for Hole C0002P).

Figure F10. Nannofossil ranges presented as age-depth chart. Bedding dips vary between $60^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ and sediment is strongly deformed, so this information does not imply a mass accumulation rate. In Hole C0002P, diagnostic information is very limited, with poor preservation of calcareous fossils, perhaps because steep dips mean little stratigraphy was traversed; however, this data is broadly consistent with depositional ages between 9.56 and $10.73\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .

Figure F19. Correlation of log units and subunits between Holes C0002F and C0002N. Log units and subunits defined in Hole C0002F were correlated to Hole C0002N based on the gamma ray and resistivity log response in Hole C0002N. The definition and characterization of units and subunits in Hole C0002F is based on a more complete data set including resistivity images and acoustic logs. Major boundaries and changes in trend or character were identified and correlated. Gamma ray values in Hole C0002N are higher throughout, which may be an artifact (see text for discussion of data quality).
