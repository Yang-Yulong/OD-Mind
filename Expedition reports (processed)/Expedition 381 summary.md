# Abstract  

The primary objective of International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 381 was to retrieve a record of early continenta l rifting and basin evolution from the Corinth rift, central Greece. Continental rifting is fundamental for the formation of ocean basins, and active rift zones are dynamic regions of high geohazar d potential. However, the detailed spatial and temporal evolution of  a complete rift system needed to understand rift development fro m the fault to plate scale is poorly resolved. In the active Corinth rift, deformation rates are high, the recent synrift succession is preserved and complete offshore, and earlier rift phases are preserve d onshore. Additionally, a dense seismic database provides high-resolution imaging of the fault network and seismic stratigraphy aroun d the basin. As the basin has subsided, its depositional environmen t has been affected by fluctuating global sea level and its absolute position relative to sea level, and the basin sediments record thi s changing environment through time. In Corinth, we can therefor e achieve an unprecedented precision of timing and spatial complexity of rift-fault system development, rift-controlled drainage syste m evolution, and basin fill in the first few million years of rift history. The following are the expedition themes:  

• High-resolution fault slip and rift evolution history,   
• Surface processes in active rifts,   
• High-resolution late Quaternary Eastern Mediterranean paleoclimate and paleoenvironment of a developing rift basin, and   
• Geohazard assessment in an active rift.  

These objectives were and will be accomplished as a result o f successful drilling, coring, and logging at three sites in the Gulf o f Corinth, which collectively yielded $1645\;\mathrm{m}$ of recovered core over  a $1905~\mathrm{m}$ cored interval. Together, these cores provide (1) a long rif t history (Sites M0078 and M0080), (2) a high-resolution record o f the most recent phase of rifting (Site M0079), and (3) the spatial variation of rift evolution (comparison of sites in the central an d eastern rift). The sediments contain a rich and complex record o f changing sedimentation, sediment and pore water geochemistry, and environmental conditions from micropaleontological assemblages. The preliminary chronology developed by shipboard analyses will be refined and improved during postexpedition research, providing a high-resolution chronostratigraphy down to the orbital timescale for a range of tectonic, sedimentological, and paleoenvironmental studies. This chronology will provide absolute timing of key rift events, rates of fault movement, rift extension an d subsidence, and the spatial variations of these parameters. The cor e data will also allow us to investigate the relative roles of and feedbacks between tectonics, climate, and eustasy in sediment flux, basin evolution, and basin environment. Finally, the Corinth rif t boreholes will provide the first long Quaternary record of Mediterranean-type climate in the region. The potential range of scientifi c applications for this unique data set is very large, encompassing tectonics, sedimentary processes, paleoenvironment, paleoclimate, paleoecology, geochemistry, and geohazards.  

# Introduction  

How rifting initiates and evolves to continental breakup an d ocean basin formation is a major unanswered solid earth/plate tectonics question; continental rifting is the first stage of this process. Numerical models indicate that strain rate is a key parameter controlling the style and magnitude of extension, but spatial and temporal patterns in strain rate are very poorly known for mos t extensional systems because of scarce chronological constraints, other than over short (earthquake-cycle) timescales. Key question s include the following: What controls rift geometry and evolution ? How does activity on faults change with time? What does rift evolution and fault activity tell us about crustal rheology? What are th e implications of changing fault activity for earthquake activity in  a developing rift fault system? Over the last ${\sim}15$ years, important insights have been derived from numerical models (e.g., Burov an d Poliakov, 2001; Lavier and Buck, 2002; Lavier and Manatschal, 2006; Huismans and Beaumont, 2007, 2011; Olive et al., 2014) and fro m observations at mature, magma-poor passive margins where activity has ceased (e.g., Manatschal et al., 2001; Whitmarsh et al., 2001; Osmundsen and Ebbing, 2008; Van Avendonk et al., 2009; Bayrakc i et al., 2016). However, early synrift stratigraphy is often difficult t o image and sample because of deep burial and tectonic overprinting, making it difficult to examine the earliest stages of rifting.  

Instead,  this  project  studies  the  young,  seismically  activ e Corinth rift with a unique existing data set to resolve at high temporal and spatial resolution how rift faults initiate and link and ho w strain is distributed over time. The rift is currently a closed, smallscale sedimentary system, and the last ${\sim}1\mathrm{-}2$ My of the synrift stratigraphic record is preserved offshore, with earlier rift sediments preserved onshore, providing a clear spatial and temporal record o f fault and rift activity. The Corinth rift is also an ideal target fo r studying rift processes because it is opening broadly orthogonall y (perpendicular to the rift axis) at high strain rates (e.g., Briole et al., 2000), extension is localized, it lacks volcanism, and almost no tectonic overprinting occurs. Thus, the number of variables contributing  to  rift  development  are  reduced,  and  a  study  here  wil l complement research in other active rift systems that are more mature, oblique, and/or characterized by significant magmatism (e.g., East Africa and the Gulf of California).  

Constraining the contributions of tectonics and climate to landscape evolution and sediment delivery in active basins and ho w surficial processes influence tectonics remains a major challenge i n Earth science. Uplift and subsidence associated with rift faults ca n strongly modify landscapes, creating and destroying sediment delivery pathways into rift basins (e.g., Gawthorpe and Leeder, 2000), but a detailed record of a complete sedimentary system in a young, active rift is lacking. For example, how do strain rate and strain distribution control landscape development and sediment flux int o rifts? Climate is clearly another dominant control on sediment flux. Isolated and semi-isolated active basins are particularly sensitive t o climate and sea level change (e.g., Collier et al., 2000; Scholz et al., 2007; McHugh et al., 2008; Lyons et al., 2015); thus, active rift basin s are ideal targets both for assessing how changing climate impact s sedimentation and for examining changes in paleoenvironment a s basins repeatedly become isolated and reconnected to the globa l oceans as a result of glacial–interglacial cycles. Where strain rate s are high, such as at the Corinth rift, high basin sediment accumulation rates provide a very high resolution record of regional climate, basin paleoenvironment, and change in sediment source and flu x into the basin through time. Recent models predict that surface processes will also influence rift development by modifying the thermal structure (Bialas and Buck, 2009) and by redistributing mas s through erosion and deposition (Olive et al., 2014), all of which ca n influence fault evolution and strain localization. Resolving the interplay between these processes requires a detailed record of climate, tectonics, and sedimentation in a young rift basin. The Corinth rif t is an excellent location to tackle these questions. In this region, glacial–interglacial cycles are characterized by changes in climate, se a level, and vegetation (e.g., Tzedakis et al., 2009; Sadori et al., 2016), allowing us to examine the impact of both climatic change and tectonics on surface processes. Sedimentation rates are high, and th e geology around the Corinth rift is well studied, enabling a comprehensive study of the complete synrift sedimentary system.  

During International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 381, a significant part of the synrift sequence of the Corinth rif t was drilled, sampled, and logged to constrain in space and tim e (1) the deformation rate, (2) the absolute timing of rifting processes, (3) subsidence and sediment flux, (4) changing paleoenvironmen t and depositional conditions, and (5) the interaction of rift development and climate on surface processes and sediment flux.  

# Background Corinth rift  

The Aegean Sea represents a natural laboratory for the study o f rapid continental extensional tectonics. Extension began here in th e Oligocene–Miocene (e.g., McKenzie, 1978; Le Pichon and Angelier, 1981; Jolivet et al., 1994; Armijo et al., 1996; Jolivet, 2001). In the lat e Pliocene–early Pleistocene, deformation became strongly localize d across a few zones, and the Corinth rift was the most prominen t zone (Figure F1). Debate continues on the origin of extension in th e broader Aegean and focusing of strain at the Corinth rift, with models typically combining gravitational collapse of thickened crust, subduction-driven rollback, westward extrusion of Anatolia, an d propagation of the North Anatolian fault (e.g., Armijo et al., 1996; Jolivet et al., 2010). Regional lithospheric structure, includin g crustal thickness and structure of the underlying subducting African plate, is constrained by wide-angle seismic and teleseismic tomographic techniques and gravity data (e.g., Tiberi et al., 2000; Sachpazi et al., 2007; Zelt et al., 2005); thicker crust $({\sim}40{-}45\ \mathrm{km})$ runs northwest–southeast along the orogenic Hellenide/Pindo s mountain belt in the western Corinth rift.  

The active Corinth rift is a ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{km}\times30{-}40\,\mathrm{km}$ domain experiencing north–south extension, and the entire rift system is $\sim\!70\!-\!80$ km wide. Geodetically measured extension rates over the last $25\ \mathrm{y}$ reach $10{-}15\ \mathrm{mm/y}$ (e.g., Clarke et al., 1998; Briole et al., 2000; Bernard et al., 2006), some of the highest in the world, giving strai n rates of ${\sim}5\,\times\,10^{-7}/\mathrm{y}.$ The Corinth rift is also one of Europe’s mos t seismically active areas.  

# Rift evolution and stratigraphy  

Corinth rifting began at ${\sim}5$ Ma with three main phases (1–3 ) identified by integration of onshore depositional records and offshore seismic stratigraphy (Figure F2) (e.g., Higgs, 1988; Armijo e t al., 1996; Sachpazi et al., 2003; Ford et al., 2007, 2016; Bell et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2011; Nixon et al., 2016; Gawthorpe et al., 2017). During Phase 1 (Pliocene), the initial basinal deposition (from onshore preserved sediments) was continental, varying from alluvial fans in the west to lacustrine in the east (Ford et al., 2007, 2013; Rohais et al., 2007; Hemelsdaël et al., 2017; Gawthorpe et al., 2017). The transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 is marked by increased sub

sidence rates and sediment supply, depocenter deepening an d northward migration, and fault linkage and/or migration, wit h deposition of large marginal fan deltas (locally as thick as $800\ \mathrm{m},$ ) during Phase 2 (“Middle Group” onshore; lower synrift unit [seismi c Unit 1] offshore). These deltas are now uplifted and exposed onshore (Backert et al., 2010). The Phase 1–2 transition appears t o have occurred at different times along the rift (e.g., ${\sim}2.2$ Ma in th e Alkyonides Gulf [eastern rift], ${\sim}3.0\,M\mathbf{a}$ in the central rift [Leeder e t al., 2008, 2012], and ${\sim}1.8\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in the western rift [Ford et al., 2013]).  

During Phase 2, the rift was controlled by both south- and northdipping faults (Bell et al., 2009; Ford et al., 2013, 2016; Nixon et al., 2016).  

At ${\sim}0.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (hypothesized age prior to drilling), at the onset o f Phase 3, fault activity again stepped northward and propagate d westward, thus establishing the modern rift asymmetry with southern boundary north-dipping faults dominating subsidence (Figur e F3). These southern boundary faults apparently grew and linke d rapidly (Nixon et al., 2016). New fan deltas developed along th e

southern gulf margin (“Upper Group” onshore; upper synrift unit [seismic Unit 2] offshore). The rift environment during Phase 3 has long been hypothesized to alternate between isolated/semi-isolated (nonmarine) and marine between glacial and interglacial periods, respectively, as eustatic sea level fluctuated relative to the boundaries of the basin (e.g., Heezen et al., 1966; Sachpazi et al., 2003) (west: Rion sill; east: Isthmus of Corinth; Figure F2). The exact timing of onset of true marine deposition is not known but is hypothesized to correlate with the distinct seismic stratigraphy of the offshore upper synrift unit, seismic Unit 2 (Sachpazi et al., 2003; Bell et al., 2009; Nixon et al., 2016). However, earlier limited marine incursions have also been described (e.g., Bentham et al., 1991; Ford et al., 2007, 2013).  

Overall, the Corinth rift appears to have migrated northward and possibly narrowed as it evolved (strain localization) (Figure F2). Geodetic and microseismicity data indicate that the highest modern strain rates are focused in the western rift (e.g., Avallone et al., 2004; Bernard et al., 2006), which is the youngest part of the rift (Ford et al., 2016). However, long-term extensional strain (on geological timescales) is greatest in the central rift (e.g., Bell et al., 2009, 2011). The extension rate may have increased at specific times over rift history (Ford et al., 2013, 2016), suggesting a deviation from models with relatively constant net strain and increasing, gradual localization (McLeod et al., 2000; Sharp et al., 2000; Gawthorpe et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2004).  

# Offshore rift architecture and synrift stratigraphy  

Patterns of extension in the offshore rift change along axis and with time, with changing polarity and symmetry of fault networks, single versus multiple active faults, and complex and changing depocenter geometry offshore (Figures F1, F3). Clear, traceable unit boundaries (possible unconformities or sequence boundaries) mark major changes in rift development in seismic reflection data, but their age is unknown.  

The synrift succession offshore is locally as thick as ${\sim}2.5\,\mathrm{km}$ and divided into two seismic stratigraphic units (the older, lower amplitude seismic Unit 1 and the younger, well-stratified, and higher amplitude seismic Unit 2) separated by a unit boundary (U) that is locally angular and potentially unconformable (e.g., Figures F4, F5, F6, F7). Seismic Unit 1 includes two different seismic facies that may or may not be stratigraphically distinct: Subunit 1a (below), nonstratified (limited weak reflections) and mainly found on the southern basin margin, and Subunit 1b (above), more widespread and stratified (although weakly in places) (see Nixon et al., 2016). Seismic Unit 2 has been interpreted to record glacial–interglacial cycles on the basis of marine and lacustrine conditions detected in short cores (Moretti et al., 2004; Collier et al., 2000), clinoform sequences on some basin margins (e.g., Leeder et al., 2005; McNeill et al., 2005; Lykousis et al., 2007; Bell et al., 2008), and alternating lowamplitude/high-amplitude seismic sequences interpreted to be lowstand lacustrine/highstand marine sequences, respectively (e.g., Sachpazi et al., 2003; Lykousis et al., 2007; Bell et al., 2008, 2009; Taylor et al., 2011) (e.g., Figure F5). The integrated sequence stratigraphic interpretations of the seismic reflection data network suggest the base of seismic Unit 2 is ${\sim}0.6$ Ma (Nixon et al., 2016). The onshore Middle Group is thought to be time-equivalent to seismic Unit 1 offshore, with the onshore Upper Group equivalent to seismic Unit 2 offshore. The onshore “Lower Group” is likely of minimal thickness offshore, if present at all, because the primary locus of rifting at that time lay south of the present-day gulf (e.g., Figure F2). However, other Phase 1 rift depocenters (such as the Megara Basin; Figure F1; e.g., Bentham et al., 1991) may have extended northwestward into the present-day Alkyonides Gulf at the eastern end of the rift (Figure F1).  

Depth to basement maps (Bell et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2011) show a single depocenter below the current central gulf, with reduced subsidence in the eastern (Alkyonides Gulf) and western rift. Isochore maps of the synrift sediments (Figure F3; Bell et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2011; Nixon et al., 2016) indicate that before the ${\sim}0.6$ Ma unit boundary/unconformity separating seismic Units 1 and 2, two primarily symmetric depocenters existed, but since ${\sim}0.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , these depocenters have linked into a single depocenter, coincident with transfer of strain from south- to north-dipping faults (increased asymmetry). Specifically, a change in rift polarity was fol

lowed by depocenter linkage. The switch to dominant northdipping faults appears to be broadly synchronous along the entir e rift. Since ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{\ka}$ , these north-dipping faults appear to hav e evolved by linkage of smaller fault segments into longer fault segments and have increased in displacement and activity with equivalent changes to the associated depocenters. The actual timing an d rate of switch in rift polarity and of fault and depocenter linkage ca n only be constrained by combining constraints on chronostratigraphy from drilling with the existing dense seismic network.  

# Changing paleoenvironment in the Corinth area  

Prior to Expedition 381, minimal information was available o n the impact of climate variations and resulting sea level changes o n sedimentation and paleoenvironment in the Corinth rift. Existin g constraints came from onshore studies (e.g., Andrews et al., 2007), piston cores as long as $30\textrm{m}$ (e.g., Moretti et al., 2004), and highresolution geophysical imaging (e.g., Perissoratis et al., 2000; Bell e t al., 2009). Late Quaternary interglacial cycles in southeastern Europe are characterized by Mediterranean, sub-Mediterranean, an d temperate forests, whereas glacial cycles are characterized by ope n woodland and steppes (e.g., Tzedakis et al., 2009; Sadori et al., 2016). Systematic fluctuations in marine microfossil assemblage s and in the isotopic composition of their shells depict long- an d short-term climatic changes in the region (Cita et al., 1977; Capotondi et al., 2016). In addition, these fluctuations provide valuabl e information regarding the impact of both African monsoon variability and higher latitude climate processes on the climatic an d oceanographic evolution of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (e.g., Rohling et al., 2015). Glacial–interglacial cycles appear to be associated with changes in sedimentary processes and environment in th e Corinth basin (e.g., Perissoratis et al., 2000). For example, long piston cores that sample the most recent transition reveal changes i n sediment facies and micropaleontological assemblages (Moretti e t al., 2004). The cores and data collected during Expedition 381 will provide unique constraints for examining the impact of both climatic  change  and  tectonics  on  sedimentation  and  paleoenvironment in the gulf and improving understanding of regional climate in the Quaternary.  

# Objectives Primary objectives  

1. Fault and rift structural evolution in an active continental rift: to establish the distribution of tectonic strain in time and space and the timescales of fault evolution in a young rift at high resolution (20–50 ky and one to tens of kilometers).  

We will determine the growth and development of a rift-scal e normal fault network, timescales of rift segment establishment, basin evolution in terms of strain localization, rift propagation an d migration, and the impact of crustal structure and composition o n strain rate and distribution. What are the controlling parameters o n strain localization? How and when does a “mature” fault networ k emerge? How does fault evolution impact subsidence patterns an d depocenter development?  

2. Surface processes in active rifts: to determine the evolution of a rift-controlled, closed drainage system in time and space at high temporal resolution $(20{-}50\,k y)$ and the relative impact of tectonics and climate on sediment flux.  

What are the relative contributions of millennial to orbital periodicity Quaternary climate fluctuations (global and regional) an d fault activity/rift evolution in controlling the supply of sedimen t into a rift basin? We will assess changes in sediment flux at a rang e of timescales and analyze the paleoenvironment of the rift basi n through time. These results will be used to evaluate the response o f sediment supply to fault birth, death and migration, rift flank uplift, and changes in strain rate and to better understand feedbacks between climate, sea level fluctuation, erosion, sediment transport, and depositional and tectonic processes.  

# Secondary objectives  

3. To resolve reliable active fault slip rates to improve regional assessment of hazards due to earthquakes and secondary tsunami and landslides.  

The Gulf of Corinth has high levels of seismicity and damagin g historic secondary hazards, such as slope failure and tsunami, in  a region of high coastal population density. Fault slip rates currentl y rely on paleoseismological and tectonic geomorphological studie s with dated materials of very recent fault slip (the last ${\sim}200~\mathrm{ky}$ o r less) and estimated horizon ages for longer timescales. These sli p rate estimates include significant uncertainties, and slip rates remain unquantified on many faults. Ocean drilling allows us to determine fault slip rates on timescales of $10{-}100\,\mathrm{ky}$ to 1 My. We wil l integrate fault slip rates with shorter timescale data (paleoseismological, geodetic, and seismicity) to more fully understand the seismic hazard potential of individual faults. Cores may also allow us t o assess the frequency of major slope failures (integrated with seismically identified mass transport deposits offshore), an indication o f secondary hazards and of possible seismicity.  

4. To generate a new high-resolution record of the Quaternary paleoclimate of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea with respect to global climate and the paleoenvironment of the Corinth basin as a semi-isolated basin controlled by changing base level and climate.  

Details of the Corinth basin’s changing environment from glacial to interglacial times are poorly known, and the precise timin g and nature of transitions between isolated and marine conditions i s unconfirmed, as is the relationship to the interacting controls of basin subsidence, sill elevation, and eustatic sea level. Offshore drillin g of synrift sediments should provide a record of regional Quaternar y paleoclimate and basin paleoenvironment by sampling and analyzing pollen, micro- and macrofossils, stable isotopes, and sedimen t physical and chemical properties. Long cores from the Gulf o f Corinth should also provide the opportunity to generate (1) the firs t high-resolution relative paleointensity (RPI) record in the Mediterranean Sea correlated with global RPI stacks (e.g., Valet et al., 2005; Channell et al., 2009) and the pattern of the magnetic excursion s (Stott et al., 2002; Lund et al., 2005; Channell et al., 2008) to hel p understand the dynamics of the geomagnetic field and (2) a linke d terrestrial pollen and marine $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ record in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (at least for interglacial intervals) to establish a record o f paleoenvironment and vegetation and to help constrain age model s for existing Eastern Mediterranean long pollen records.  

# Operational strategy  

Based on seismic and bathymetric data acquired in the Gulf o f Corinth prior to the expedition, three primary and three alternat e drill sites were proposed to satisfy the objectives of the proposal. The three primary (and ultimately drilled) sites (Figure F1) were selected based on the likelihood of recovering key stratigraphic unit s to achieve the expedition scientific objectives, the ability to correlate with horizons in the seismic reflection data network, and, i n combination, to resolve both temporal and spatial rift evolutionar y history.  

Site M0078 (proposed Site COR-02A) is located in the centra l basin on a horst block where a relatively condensed section is expected. This site allows recovery of a long synrift record, including  a significant part of seismic Unit 1 below, a near-complete seismi c Unit 2 above, and the regional unit boundary or unconformity between them (Figures F4, F5). Site M0079 (proposed Site COR-01A ) allows sampling of a complete seismic Unit 2 at very high resolutio n (Figures F4, F6). Site M0080 (proposed Site COR-04B) was selecte d because the uppermost basement and early seismic Unit 1 sediments can be sampled at this location because of the relatively thi n seismic Unit 2 section (Figures F4, F7). The location of Site M008 0 in the eastern part of the rift (Alkyonides Gulf; Figure F1) also provides an opportunity to test along-axis variation in rift processes.  

All holes were sited in a $20\textrm{m}$ radius of the proposed drillin g sites approved by the IODP Environmental Protection and Safet y Panel, with Holes M0078A, M0079A, and M0080A all situate d within $5\,\mathrm{m}$ of the specified coordinates. The general locations of th e sites drilled are shown in Figure F1. As with all mission-specifi c platform expeditions, no cores were split during the offshore phase; therefore, a comprehensive onshore phase complemented the offshore phase. Table T1 summarizes the descriptions and measurements made during Expedition 381 and indicates whether they wer e conducted offshore or onshore.  

# Offshore operations  

Mobilization of the vessel began on 3 October 2017 in Falmouth, UK, with the D/V Fugro Synergy sailing for the Port of Valletta, Malta, on 7 October. On 16 October, the vessel arrived at th e Port of Valletta, and European Consortium for Ocean Researc h Drilling (ECORD) Science Operator (ESO) personnel joined th e vessel to continue the mobilization of science facilities before arrival in Greece. Following refueling, the Fugro Synergy continued th e transit to the Port of Corinth, Greece, and was alongside on $19\;\mathrm{Oc}.$ - tober.  

The offshore phase took place from 19 October to 18 December . The vessel sailed from Corinth on 22 October and returned to por t on 18 December. Following completion of operations at Site M0078, a ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{h}$ port call was made in the Port of Corinth on 13 Novembe r for Fugro/ESO crew change and to load supplies and equipment. Demobilization also took place at the Port of Corinth, where th e ESO refrigerated (reefer) containers, containerized laboratories, Multi-Sensor Core Logger (MSCL) laboratory container, and offic e containers were offloaded from the vessel in preparation for roa d transport  to  the  Center  for  Marine  Environmental  Science s (MARUM), University of Bremen (Germany), and transfer t o Pireás, Greece, for shipping by sea to the British Geological Surve y (UK). The University of Montpellier logging container was transported by sea to Falmouth (UK) and then over land to Montpellier. ESO staff departed by 19 December following completion of demobilization.  

The cores, core catcher samples, headspace gas samples, and interstitial water splits collected offshore were transported under refrigeration to the IODP Bremen Core Repository at MARU M (University of Bremen, Germany).  

In total, 52.5 days of Expedition 381 were spent operational o n station, 0.5 days were spent in transit between sites, 0.8 days wer e spent in port during the expedition, 0.2 days were spent on standb y at station because of weather, and 2.3 days were spent on equip

# Onshore Science Party  

Thermal conductivity measurements were carried out ever y ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ on the cores from all sites before the start of the Onshor e Science Party (OSP).  

During the Expedition 381 OSP from 31 January to 28 Februar y 2018, the cores were described in detail and IODP standard sampling and measurements and postexpedition scientific researc h sampling were undertaken (Table T1). Analytical laboratories an d equipment were used at MARUM (nondestructive core logging, marine geotechnics, inorganic geochemistry, and microscopes) an d the Department of Geosciences at the University of Bremen (paleomagnetism and hydrofluoric acid laboratories and the carbon/sulfur analysis system).

# Site M0078  

Site M0078 is located in the central Gulf of Corinth (Figure F1 ) on a fault-bounded horst block (Figure F5) with the aim of recovering a long, condensed record of synrift sedimentation. Two hole s (M0078A and M0078B) were drilled at water depths of 859.5 an d 864.0 meters below sea level (mbsl), respectively. Hole M0078A wa s drilled and cored to 610.43 meters below seafloor (mbsf) using th e Fugro WEP system (piston), the Fugro Corer in push and percussiv e modes, and the FXMCB (rotary corer). Core recovery was $87\%$ . Downhole logging was attempted in Hole M0078A, but successful data collection was not possible. Hole M0078B was drilled an d cored to 55.85 mbsf using the Fugro Corer in push mode to captur e material not recovered in Hole M0078A. Core recovery was $93\%$ . Downhole logging was not conducted in Hole M0078B because i t was a relatively shallow hole.  

# Site M0079  

Site M0079 is located in the central Gulf of Corinth (Figure F1 ) with the aim of drilling a complete and expanded stratigraphic section of the most recent rift phase and the uppermost section of sediments from the penultimate phase to provide a high-resolutio n temporal record (Figure F6). Hole M0079A (water depth of 857. 1 mbsl) was drilled and cored to 704.9 mbsf using the Fugro Corer i n push and percussive modes and the FXMCB. Core recovery wa s  

$87\%$ . Downhole logging was conducted with a limited suite of logging tools, primarily in the upper 295 mbsf.  

# Site M0080  

Site M0080 is located in the Alkyonides Gulf (Figures F1, F7) i n the eastern part of the Corinth rift with the aim of testing spatia l variation in rift evolution history and to sample earlier phases o f rifting. Hole M0080A (water depth of $348.8~\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was drilled an d cored to 534.1 mbsf using the Fugro Corer in push and percussiv e modes and the FXMCB. Core recovery was $84\%$ . Downhole loggin g was conducted with a full suite of standard logging tools, with mos t depth intervals covered.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

The drilled sequences of Expedition 381 comprise an upper section (lithostratigraphic Unit 1 at Sites M0078 and M0079; lithostratigraphic Units 1 and 2 at Site M0080) that records the mos t recent phase of synrift deformation and deposition (equivalent t o seismic Unit 2), a lithostratigraphic unit boundary (of possible unconformable nature in places), and an underlying unit or unit s (lithostratigraphic Unit 2 at Sites M0078 and M0079; lithostratigraphic Units 3 and 4 at Site M0080; equivalent to seismic Unit 1 ) that record(s) earlier rift history and represents a variable time period of deposition. The lithostratigraphic units for all sites were defined based on lithologic, micropaleontological, and select physica l properties. To characterize the lithostratigraphy, a series of facie s associations (FAs) were defined based on physical and biogenic features of the sediment, including bedding and lamination style, grai n size, color, and body and trace fossils. The facies associations are defined in Table T3 and described in the Expedition 381 facies associations chapter (McNeill et al., 2019).  

# Site M0078  

The lithostratigraphy of Site M0078 is divided into two unit s with a boundary at 385.14 mbsf. Unit 1 (the upper unit) is divide d into 16 subunits (Figure F8); micropaleontological data define thes e subunits as marine and isolated/semi-isolated intervals that appea r to be primarily controlled by changing eustatic sea level with respect to sills at the entrance to the Corinth basin.  

Unit 1 sediments are dominated by detrital clay- and silt-grad e carbonate. Background sedimentation consists of hemipelagic an d turbiditic muds with occasional thin, coarser (fine silt to mediu m sand) beds and turbidite–homogeneous mud couplets. Bioturbatio n is primarily present in the marine subunits. Calcite is the mos t abundant mineral, with common to abundant quartz, feldspars, an d micas. Biogenic material is common (in particular in the marin e subunits), as are organic components and framboidal pyrite. Wellsorted, silt-sized aragonite needles are dominant in some laminate d intervals. Marine subunits in Unit 1 (odd numbers) are dominate d by homogeneous to poorly bedded, often greenish gray mud (FA 1 and FA6; see Table T3) with some laminated muds (e.g., FA3) an d sparse thin silty and sandy beds. Isolated/semi-isolated subunit s (even numbers) include laminated muds, thin mud beds, greenis h gray mud with homogeneous thick mud beds, and dark gray t o black organic-rich beds (FA4, FA3, and FA5) with sparse thin silt y and sandy beds. Submillimeter- to millimeter-scale laminations, commonly gray to white, also occur in these isolated/semi-isolate d subunits (FA3). Throughout Unit 1, interbedded mud–silt and centimeter-thick sand beds are present, but overall sand is a mino r component and decreases with depth (Figure F8).  

Unit 2 has a composition similar to that of Unit 1, with calcit e the dominant mineral. This unit is composed almost entirely of ligh t gray or buff weakly laminated to homogeneous highly bioturbate d mud (FA12; Figure F8). Minor darker gray mud with faint beddin g and black laminations also occurs. The Unit 1/2 boundary is shar p and marked by an abrupt change from laminated greenish gra y muds to homogeneous light gray muds downhole.

# Site M0079  

The lithostratigraphy of Site M0079 is divided into two unit s with a boundary at 677.23 mbsf (Figure F9). Unit 1 is divided into 1 6 subunits that micropaleontological data define as alternating marine and isolated/semi-isolated intervals. As at Site M0078, Unit  1 sediments are dominantly fine grained and carbonate rich. Detrital calcite predominates, with subordinate quartz, feldspar, and phyllosilicates. Biogenic material is common, particularly in the marin e subunits. Depositional processes were dominated by fine-graine d turbiditic and hemipelagic deposition. Marine subunits in Unit  1 (odd numbers) are moderately to highly bioturbated and dominate d by homogeneous to poorly bedded greenish gray muds (FA1 an d FA6; see Table T3). Isolated/semi-isolated subunits (even numbers ) are dominated by laminated to thinly bedded gray and greenish gra y muds, some with black, organic-rich laminations and beds (FA2, FA4, and FA5) with no or sparse bioturbation. Higher energy depositional processes are indicated by intervals of soft-sediment deformation and mud-supported conglomerates (FA13) and sand– homogeneous mud couplets that occur in both marine and isolated/semi-isolated units. Overall, occurrence of slumped and mudsupported conglomerates increases with depth in Unit 1, with a particularly thick slumped interval occurring in Subunit 1-11.  

Unit 2 has a composition similar to that of Unit 1 and is dominated by light gray to buff weakly laminated to homogeneous highl y bioturbated mud (FA12; Figure F9). It is also dominated by fine silt– sized detrital calcite, similar to Site M0078, with lower concentrations of siliciclastic grains compared with Unit 1. In contrast to Sit e M0078, Unit 2 contains fining-upward sands (FA10), many mor e sand and homogeneous mud couplets, and large decimeter- to meter-scale slump structures and mud-supported intraclast conglomerates (FA13).

# Site M0080  

The lithostratigraphy of Site M0080 is divided into four unit s with boundaries at 136.96, 256.85, and 458.40 mbsf (Figure F10). Units 1 and 2 are dominated by moderately sorted, clay-grade calcite. Other minor terrigenous components include quartz, mica, and feldspar mineral grains. Occasionally, both calcite and aragonite occur in equal proportions. Biogenic components and framboidal pyrite are common throughout.  

Unit 1 has characteristics similar to those of Unit 1 at Site s M0078 and M0079 and is divided into 11 subunits based on alterna

tions between dominantly bioturbated homogeneous and poorl y bedded greenish gray and gray mud (FA1 and FA6) and bedded an d laminated mud (FA2, FA3, FA4, and FA5) (Figure F10). These sediments are interpreted to be dominantly deep-water turbiditic an d hemipelagic deposits. The alternating subunits are interpreted t o represent alternating marine (homogeneous mud; FA1 and FA6 ) and isolated/semi-isolated (bedded and laminated mud; FA2, FA3, FA4, and FA5, and in lower even-numbered subunits light gray t o buff weakly laminated to homogeneous highly bioturbated mu d [FA12]) environments. Unit 2 is divided into an upper part dominated by light gray bioturbated mud (FA12) and a lower part wit h greater variability of facies and grain size, including ophiolitic-ric h conglomerates, highly bioturbated mudstones with shallow-wate r foraminifer assemblages, and occasional paleosols. The lower par t of this unit reflects a transition downhole in paleoenvironmen t from subaqueous to subaerial, marking the top of a significant interval of subaerial deposition in Unit 3.  

The upper half of Unit 3 has a high proportion of coarse clasti c sediments, with clasts including mafic/ultramafic lithologies, limestone, and chert (FA7; Subunit 3-1), that pass down into distinctiv e red-brown fine-grained muds and silts (FA8; Subunit 3-2; Figur e F10). The very fine sand to mud fraction commonly contains abundant clay-sized Fe oxides that may be responsible for the reddis h brown to pale yellow color of the sediments. The base of the uni t (Subunit 3-3) comprises homogeneous muds of FA1 passing dow n into FA17 shelly bioturbated muds and sands. The character of th e conglomerates and dominance of calcrete soils in Unit 3 suggest a n ephemeral alluvial setting subject to a fluctuating water table.  

Unit 4 at Site M0080 is dominated by shelly laminated to bedde d carbonates (FA15 and FA16) that suggest a reduction in clastic input and most likely formed in a low-energy nearshore setting. Th e basal two cores of Unit 4 consist of polymict pebble–cobble conglomerates featuring abundant limestone clasts with minor re d chert and mafic/ultramafic clasts, reflecting a high-energy alluvia l (fan) environment.  

Units 3 and 4 include ophiolitic-derived grains and clasts in al l grain size fractions but most obviously in the coarser grain siz e range (sand to pebble grade). Carbonate minerals are most commonly calcite, whereas the ophiolitic-derived mafic/ultramafic sediment grains largely comprise pyroxenes, serpentinized olivine, an d plagioclase.  

# Structural geology  

Both natural and drilling-induced deformation were recorded i n the cores. Natural faults were distinguished from drilling-induce d faulting or other forms of drilling-induced deformation (DID) b y their planar geometries and lack of influence by proximity to eithe r the core liner or core axis (i.e., by not curving to become parallel t o the core axis, forming conjugate pairs with an intersection at th e core axis, or curving into the core liner). DID intensity and styl e were recorded to determine the state of cores for interpretation an d analysis and for potential postexpedition analysis of sediment physical properties variations.  

# Site M0078  

At Site M0078, bedding attitude is horizontal to subhorizonta l with local tilting and apparent bedding dips increasing downhole t o as high as $24^{\circ}$ (slightly higher than estimated dips in coincident seismic reflection data; Figure F5). Small-scale natural faulting was observed sporadically throughout the hole, including frequent norma l faults and less common strike-slip faults. Faulting intensity generally increases with depth but with faulting concentrated in discret e intervals, in particular in the 329.4–447.33 mbsf interval around th e lithostratigraphic Unit 1/2 boundary. The apparent lack of faults i n the deeper part of Unit 2 may be related to destruction by rotar y drilling–induced biscuiting. Normal fault displacements range fro m $1~\mathrm{mm}$ to $35~\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and orientation measurements on selected fault s indicate that they may form conjugate sets. The sampled normal fault dips show true dips ranging from $42^{\circ}$ to $82^{\circ}$ with a modal average of $60^{\circ}{-}70^{\circ}$ and a mean of $66^{\circ}$ . The general abundance and geometry of observed small normal faults is in agreement with the overall extensional nature of the rift deformation.  

A range of drilling-induced structures was observed, includin g biscuiting, arching bedding, tilted panels, lensing, smearing/flow o f sediment along the core lining, voids, and open fractures. In general, DID increases downhole. Piston coring generated sporadi c slight to moderate DID. Rotary coring from 224.34 mbsf downhol e is associated with a marked increase in intensity (moderate to high ) in DID, and deformation is dominated by biscuiting and inflow o f sediment and drilling fluid between biscuits.  

# Site M0079  

Bedding attitude is generally horizontal to subhorizontal despit e a gentle increase in dip of reflection horizons with depth in seismi c data at Site M0079 (Figure F6). Small-scale natural faulting was observed sporadically throughout the hole, and concentrated faultin g was observed in discrete intervals at 48–62, 259–278, 472–548, an d 686–698 mbsf. More significant faulting with larger displacement s occurs below 547 mbsf. Faulting intensity varies downhole from 0. 7 to $10\;\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ . All natural faults in Hole M0079A have apparent normal offset, with displacements of $1~\mathrm{mm}$ to ${>}14~\mathrm{cm}$ . Faults sampled fo r orientation analysis appear to form a conjugate set around an average north–south strike in the core reference frame, but sampling i s biased to surfaces that intersect the split-core face. The abundanc e and geometry of small normal faults are consistent with those observed at Site M0078 and with the extensional rift deformation.  

A wide range of drilling-induced structures was observed, mos t commonly biscuiting, shear fractures, arching and disturbed bedding, smearing/flow of sediment along the edges of the core, voids, and open fractures; the intensity and style of drilling-induced structures vary downhole. Overall, DID intensity is markedly lower tha n in Hole M0078A (most likely due to changes in drilling and corin g methods). Biscuiting is regularly present below 300 mbsf. Below 57 4 mbsf, cores are more intensely deformed, with biscuiting dominant. Well-developed, drilling-induced shear fracturing is a characteristi c feature of Hole M0079A (not observed in Hole M0078A) and is  a regular feature below 276 mbsf. Fractures often form as conjugat e pairs typically intersecting in the center of the core or steepenin g toward the center of the core.  

# Site M0080  

Bedding attitude is generally horizontal to subhorizontal, despite a gentle increase in dip of reflection horizons in seismic data a t depth at Site M0080 (Figures F7, F10). Small-scale natural faultin g was observed in lithostratigraphic Unit 1, Subunit 3-2, and Unit 4, with no faults between 101 and 368 mbsf (Unit 2 and Subunit 3-1). The lack of faulting in this interval may be related to lithologic an d rheological properties. In Unit 1, faulting intensity varies from 1. 4 to $10.5\,\mathrm{~m^{-1}~}$ , and all faults have apparent normal offsets with displacements of $0.2\;\mathrm{mm}$ to $3.2\;\mathrm{cm}$ . In Subunit 3-2 and Unit 4, faultin g intensity varies from 0.7 to $4~\mathrm{m^{-1}}$ . Some faults have apparent displacements larger than their length in the core and have faul t gouges and mineralized mirror surfaces with slickenlines. Fault s sampled for orientation data illustrate a conjugate fault set strikin g NNE–SSW in the core reference frame in Unit 1, but samplin g tends to be biased to surfaces that intersect the split-core face. I n Subunit 3-2 and Unit 4, orientations are more variable, and slickenlines indicate oblique slip and strike-slip motion. The geometries o f faults in Unit 1 are consistent with those at Sites M0078 and M007 9 and the extensional rift deformation; however, the wider range o f motion senses and geometries in Subunit 3-2 and Unit 4 suggest  a more complex history of faulting here.  

A wide range of drilling-induced structures was observed, mos t commonly biscuiting, shear fractures, arching bedding, smearing/flow of sediment along the edges of the core, and voids; the intensity and style of drilling-induced structures vary downhole. Significant lengths of core with little or no DID may be related to  a combination of drilling technique and strength of the materials. Below 15 mbsf, DID associated with piston coring is pervasive wit h soupy textures, flow along the core liner and axis, and even complete mobilization and destruction of bedding in some cores. Biscuiting is dominant between 156 and 244 mbsf with the onset of rotar y coring and again between 314 and 530 mbsf, where it is associate d with intense brecciation between biscuits. Overall, shear fracturin g is less common than at Site M0079.  

# Micropaleontology  

Micropaleontological analysis included calcareous nannofossils, marine and nonmarine diatoms, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and palynomorphs (terrestrial and aquatic pollen and spores, dinoflagellate cysts, green algae coenobia and spores, fungal remains, foraminifer test linings, and microscopic charred particles). The combined examination of microfossil groups in the younges t synrift sediments revealed variations between marine, mixed (marine with nonmarine), nonmarine, and indeterminate (e.g., barren ) microfossil assemblages constructed by complex environmenta l and depositional settings in the Corinth basin; alternating paleoenvironment was particularly evident in the most recent rift phase. Each microfossil group contributes unique information to the regional/basinal paleoenvironmental interpretation. Additionally, calcareous nannofossils contributed to the chronostratigraphic mode l for the stratigraphic sequence. Diatoms provided critical information about depositional environments, especially in isolated intervals. Planktonic and benthic foraminifers were used to interpret th e evolution of the paleoceanographic conditions in the basin durin g marine phases. Palynology provided a link between the terrestria l and aquatic realms and an assessment of changes in terrestrial paleovegetation and aquatic ecosystems.  

# Site M0078  

The micropaleontology at Site M0078 revealed a high level o f complexity both in individual microfossil groups and collectively. I n the 16 subunits of lithostratigraphic Unit 1, micropaleontologica l assemblages alternate primarily between marine and undetermine d assemblages but also include several mixed and nonmarine assemblages. Lithostratigraphic Unit 2 is devoid of marine calcareous an d siliceous microfossils, containing only nonmarine diatoms and terrestrial and aquatic pollen, dinoflagellate cysts, green algae coenobia  and  spores,  fungal  remains,  and  foraminifer  test  linings. Calcareous nannofossils were observed in almost all Unit 1 sample s but with significantly lower abundances and diversity in the isolated/semi-isolated subunits. In general, Gephyrocapsa is the mos t dominant genus. Late Quaternary age control in Unit 1 is provide d loosely by three biostratigraphic events: (1) the last occurrence (LO ) of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa $(0.43\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , supported by the co-occurrence with Umbilicosphaera sibogae; (2) the first occurrence (FO) o f Emiliania huxleyi $\left(0.29\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ ; and (3) a crossover in dominance between $E_{\mathrm{{*}}}$ . huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa “small” $\left(<3\,\upmu\mathrm{m}\right)$ , documented t o be ${\sim}70\ \mathrm{ka}$ in the Mediterranean Sea (Anthonissen and Ogg, 2012). Because of the punctuated nature of marine environments here, it i s important to keep in mind that the depth precision of these biohorizons is low. Unit 2 is nearly devoid of in situ calcareous nannofossils. Marine diatoms were observed in the majority of the full y marine subunits. Nonmarine diatoms were most commonly observed in the isolated/semi-isolated subunits but were also sometimes observed in low abundance with marine microfossils wher e they were poorly preserved. The assemblages are not diverse an d are dominated by species of the Pontosphaera ocellata group. Th e assemblages in the underlying Unit 2 are more diverse but are still dominated by the planktonic $P_{\star}$ ocellata complex. Benthic an d planktonic foraminifers are well preserved but have highly variabl e abundances and compositions in Unit 1. Foraminifers tend to be absent or in low abundances in isolated/semi-isolated subunits an d abundant to trace in the marine subunits. In general, benthic foraminifers tend to be more abundant than planktonic foraminifers. Planktonic and benthic foraminifers are absent from Unit 2 samples. From palynological analysis, the trees versus herbs percentag e curve shows alternating periods dominated by forests or herb vegetation that correlate with marine and isolated/semi-isolated intervals, respectively. The interpreted aquatic ecosystem ranges fro m marine to brackish to evidence for freshwater influx. Highly divers e marine dinoflagellate assemblages correlate with the fully marin e intervals, and low dinocyst diversity samples with low salinity indicators suggest deposition under low-salinity (brackish) conditions.  

# Site M0079  

The micropaleontology at Site M0079 revealed a high level o f complexity both in individual microfossil groups and collectively, a s at Site M0078. In the 16 subunits of lithostratigraphic Unit 1, micropaleontological assemblages alternate primarily between marin e and undetermined assemblages but also include some mixed an d nonmarine assemblages. Lithostratigraphic Unit 2 is nearly devoi d of marine and terrestrial microfossils. Calcareous nannofossils wer e observed in almost all Unit 1 samples but with significantly lowe r abundances and diversity in isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Gephyrocapsa is the most dominant species. Late Quaternary age control in Unit 1 is provided loosely by the three biostratigraphic event s that were also observed at Site M0078: (1) the LO of $P_{\star}$ lacunosa $(0.43\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , (2) the FO of $E$ . huxleyi $\left(0.29\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ , and (3) a crossover i n dominance between $E$ . huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa “small” $(<\!3{\mathrm{~}}\mu{\mathrm{m}})$ $(\sim\!70\,\mathrm{ka})$ . Because of the punctuated nature of marine environment s here, it is important to bear in mind that the depth precision o f these biohorizons is low. Unit 2 is completely devoid of in situ calcareous nannofossils. As at Site M0078, marine diatoms were observed in the majority of the fully marine subunits. Nonmarin e diatoms were most commonly observed in the isolated/semi-isolated subunits, typically in combination with low abundances o f marine microfossils. On occasion, nonmarine diatoms were observed in low abundance in marine intervals; however, because o f poor preservation, they are not interpreted to be in situ. The nonmarine diatom assemblages are dominated by several morphotype s of the P. ocellata complex. Benthic and planktonic foraminifers ar e well preserved but have highly variable abundances and compositions in Unit 1. Eight intervals with relatively high abundances o f benthic and/or planktonic foraminifer species in Unit 1 suggest th e prevalence of marine conditions. In these intervals, benthic foraminifer abundance is generally higher than that of planktonic foraminifers. Foraminifers tend to be absent or in low abundances i n isolated/semi-isolated subunits, although intervals with higher foraminifer abundance were also observed. Planktonic and benthic foraminifers are absent from Unit 2 samples. The majority of th e pollen assemblages corresponding to marine intervals in Unit 1 ar e characterized by high tree abundances, suggesting the occurrenc e of forested landscapes in the surroundings of the Gulf of Corinth, whereas in pollen assemblages corresponding to isolated/semi-isolated intervals, herb and tree abundances are nearly equal. As at Sit e M0078, dinoflagellate assemblages show alternating periods of marine and brackish paleoenvironments correlating with marine an d isolated/semi-isolated intervals, respectively.  

# Site M0080  

At Site M0080, the microfossil assemblages in lithostratigraphi c Unit 1 indicate alternation primarily between marine and undetermined/barren assemblages but also include a few mixed and nonmarine assemblages toward the base of the unit. Unit 2 alternate s between nonmarine and undetermined/barren assemblages. Unit  3 is devoid of microfossils except palynomorphs because it is almos t entirely terrestrial. Unit 4 is nearly devoid of the microfossil group s analyzed, with the exception of three samples that contain calcareous nannofossils in very low concentrations. Calcareous nannofossils similar to those observed at Sites M0078 and M0079 wer e observed in all marine intervals in Unit 1. Late Quaternary age control in Unit 1 is loosely provided by two biohorizons: (1) the crossover in dominance between $E_{i}$ . huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa “small ” $(<\!3\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ and (2) the FO of $E$ . huxleyi (see Sites M0078 and M007 9 for age details). As at Sites M0078 and M0079, the true FO of $E$ . huxleyi was probably not observed. Units 2 and 3 are devoid of i n situ calcareous nannofossils, and nannofossils are rarely present i n Unit 4, where their implications for age are being investigated. Initial investigations suggest marine diatoms are present in significantly lower abundances than at Sites M0078 and M0079. Th e nonmarine diatom assemblages show better preservation an d greater diversity of benthic taxa, indicating a shallower environment compared with the other two sites. Benthic and planktoni c foraminifers are present only in Units 1 and 2, with highly variabl e abundances and compositions. Planktonic foraminifers similar t o those observed at Sites M0078 and M0079 were observed in all marine intervals in Hole M0080A. The benthic foraminifer assemblages in the lower part of Unit 1 and in Unit 2 imply shallowmarine depositional environments. Pollen assemblages in Units  1 and 2 corresponding to interpreted marine intervals show high tre e abundances, suggesting the occurrence of a forested landscape surrounding the Alkyonides Gulf, whereas in isolated/semi-isolated intervals, herb and tree abundances are nearly equal. Dinoflagellat e assemblages indicating marine and brackish paleoenvironment s were observed in Units 1 and 2, whereas Units 3 and 4 were devoi d of dinocysts.  

# Geochemistry  

Pore water was collected directly from cores offshore using Rhizons or squeeze cakes. Offshore, these samples were analyzed fo r alkalinity, ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$ ), pH, and salinity. During the OSP,  a combination of methods was applied to pore water samples to measure anions, cations, phosphate $(\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\;3-})$ , and dissolved inorgani c carbon (DIC). Solid samples were selected and processed during th e  

OSP and were measured for X-ray fluorescence elemental composition, X-ray diffraction (results were incorporated into Lithostratigraphy), total carbon, and total organic carbon.  

# Site M0078  

At Site M0078, 82 pore water samples were analyzed from Hole s M0078A and M0078B, and 127 bulk sediment samples were processed during the OSP. Pore water and solid-phase chemical result s follow very similar trends in Holes M0078A and M0078B. Pore water composition in the uppermost ${\sim}50$ mbsf at Site M0078 reflects  a diffusion profile of dissolved elements from the water column int o the sediments (sodium $\left[\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}\right]$ , chloride $\left[{{\bf{C}}{\bf{l}}-}\right]$ , and sulfate $[\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}]$ ) an d ions produced during the degradation of organic matter $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ , bicarbonate $\mathrm{[HCO_{3}^{\ -}]}$ , $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ , iron, and manganese). Comparison o f salinity values with those of $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $C1^{-}$ indicate that the major sal t contributing to the pore water is $\mathrm{NaCl}$ . Significant changes betwee n the pore water above and below the lithostratigraphic Unit 1/ 2 boundary were observed; higher concentrations of $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ an d ions associated with carbonates (calcium $[\mathbf{Ca}^{2+}]$ , magnesium $[\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}],$ and strontium $\left[S\mathbf{r}^{2+}\right])$ were observed below the boundary. Change s in pore water composition below the Unit 1/2 boundary may reflec t the change in sediment composition, which is evident from the elemental composition of the solid sediment. Although solid sedimen t samples are carbonate rich throughout Hole M0078A, below th e Unit 1/2 boundary an increase in the dominance of carbonate i s clear from higher calcium concentrations. Organic carbon is lo w throughout Site M0078, ranging from 0.07 to $0.89\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

# Site M0079  

At Site M0079, 77 pore water samples were analyzed, and 11 1 bulk sediment samples were processed during the OSP. From th e seafloor to ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , pore water composition shows decreasing salinity (from 38.17 to 10.48) alongside decreasing pore fluid $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ , Cl−, and $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ concentrations. Dissolved $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ ranges between 7.82 an d $610.49\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ varies from 51.65 to $541.73~\mathrm{mM}$ ; their highes t values are in the upper 0.5 mbsf at the sediment/water interface.  

Dissolved iron $(\mathrm{Fe^{2+}})$ , which varies between 0.17 and $220.63\,\upmu\mathrm{M},$ and manganese, which ranges from $_{<0.02}$ to $62.71~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ both increase in the uppermost 8.65 mbsf, most likely due to generation o f these ions during microbial oxidation of organic matter. Other ion s generated during the degradation of organic matter $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ , $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{}^{-}$ , and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}{}^{3-}$ ) also show this increase in the uppermost part of the hol e but fluctuate with depth, reflecting the complex nature of the geochemical environment. Ions commonly associated with carbonate s $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}\left[m e a n=3.82\ m M\right]}$ ], ${\mathrm{M}}\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ [mean $=17.41\;\mathrm{mM}]$ ], and $S\ensuremath{\mathbf{r}}^{2+}$ [mea n $=0.11\;\mathrm{mM}]$ ) also vary with depth and, similar to Hole M0078A, increase at the base of Hole M0079A. These observations are simila r to solid phase results for these same elements.  

Analysis of solid sediment samples (total inorganic carbo n [TIC] and calcium) suggests that the sediment is predominantl y composed of carbonate, which generally increases with depth $\mathbf{\check{C}a=}$ $175.0\mathrm{-}228.0\,\mathrm{g/kg;\,TIC}=3.95\mathrm{-}10.52\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ . Elements associated wit h detrital material (silicon, aluminum, zircon, and potassium), in contrast, decrease with depth.  

# Site M0080  

At Site M0080, 62 pore water samples were analyzed, and 6 8 bulk sediment samples were processed during the OSP. Pore wate r profiles in the uppermost section of Hole M0080A show change s that most likely reflect diffusion profiles. Decreases in salinity fro m close to seawater values (35.74) to much lower values (12.38) a t  

49.45 mbsf, along with decreases in $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ , $C1^{-}$ and $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ concentrations, are likely linked to diffusion from seawater into the sediment. The highest concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ and manganese (a s high as 166.74 and $31.45\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ , respectively) at the top of the hole decrease to relatively stable state concentrations deeper than ${\sim}30$ mbsf. This trend is likely due to generation of these ions during oxidation of organic matter. Concentrations of other ions linked to organic matter degradation $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ , $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ , alkalinity, and DIC) als o increase in the uppermost $\mathord{\sim}20$ mbsf (with maxima of $2.1\;\mathrm{mM}$ , 21.4 4 $\upmu\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{{}}}$ , $13.87\,\mathrm{~mM}$ , and $12.59\,\mathrm{~mM}$ , respectively). Deeper than $\mathord{\sim}20$ mbsf, these ions continue to be present in variable concentrations, possibly relating to the loci of organic matter degradation.  

Below the lithostratigraphic Unit 2/3 boundary, ions relating t o organic matter degradation are generally present in low concentrations, whereas ions related to marine seawater appear to be high, comparable to modern day local seawater. $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ and $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ concentrations, which are typically related to carbonate, also increase in Uni t 3. Average $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ and $M\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ concentrations are 8.16 and $38.86~\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{}}$ , respectively, throughout the hole but reach maxima of 34.65 an d $86.85\;\mathrm{mM}$ , respectively, in Unit 3.  

Bulk geochemical results from solid sample analyses indicat e that lithostratigraphic Units 1, 2, and 4 are dominated by calciu m carbonate, with inorganic carbon averaging $8.34~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and calciu m averaging $237.77~\mathrm{g/kg}$ . In Unit 3, silicon dominates with an averag e of $172.68~\mathrm{g/kg}$ compared with $83.63~\mathrm{g/kg}$ in Units 1, 2, and 4. Thi s switch in dominance, alongside higher values of aluminum, potassium, rubidium, and zirconium, suggests a change to more siliciclastic  sediment  in  Unit  3,  supported  by  lithostratigraphi c interpretations (see Lithostratigraphy). Organic carbon content i s low throughout, averaging $0.24\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , and is lowest in Unit 3 (averag e $=0.06\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ).  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties data acquired offshore and onshore o n whole cores, split cores, and discrete samples exhibit coherent variations with depth and between different lithologies. Shear strengt h was estimated with handheld penetrometer measurements o n whole cores and in situ cone penetration tests offshore and from fal l cone and shear vane tests on split cores during the OSP. MSCL density data were acquired on whole cores offshore, and moisture an d density (MAD) density and porosity were measured on discret e samples during the OSP. MSCL magnetic susceptibility, resistivity, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) data were acquired offshore o n whole cores, and color reflectance data were acquired on split core s during the OSP. Attempts were made to collect $P$ -wave velocity dat a on whole cores, half cores, and discrete samples. At Sites M007 8 and M0079, reliable velocity measurements were only obtained i n restricted intervals, primarily in the upper parts of the core, but reliable results were obtained for a large part of Site M0080. Betwee n the offshore phase and the OSP, thermal conductivity measurements were conducted on whole cores prior to splitting.  

# Site M0078  

At Site M0078, MAD, MSCL density, MSCL resistivity, an d shear strength data indicate increases in sediment density an d strength and a reduction in porosity with depth, consistent wit h compaction (Figure F8). Thermal conductivity also increases wit h depth. Sharp increases in density and shear strength were observe d at 225 mbsf, near the transition to rotary coring. Overall, low NG R values at Site M0078 indicate low potassium (K), uranium (U), an d thorium (Th) concentrations.  

Physical properties vary between the two defined lithostratigraphic units and within Unit 1. In Unit 1, physical properties sho w clear variation between the marine and isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Marine subunits (odd numbers) are characterized by highe r NGR values and lower and less scattered magnetic susceptibilit y values than isolated/semi-isolated subunits (even numbers; Figur e F8). Lower density values are commonly associated with marin e subunits and/or with transitions from these subunits into thos e above and below. Marine subunits have lower mean $L^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ value s and higher mean $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ values compared with the means for the hole. Unit 2 is characterized by lower NGR values, scattered magneti c susceptibility values, and lighter colors, resulting in relatively highe r mean $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ values and lower $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ values compared with Unit 1. Density values are less scattered in Unit 2 but show in-core trends i n MSCL data related to coring and drilling.  

# Site M0079  

Overall, as at Site M0078, MAD, MSCL density, MSCL resistivity, and shear strength data at Site M0079 indicate increases in sediment density and strength and a reduction in porosity with depth, consistent  with  compaction  (Figure  F9).  However,  low  shea r strength, density, and velocity values and high porosity values in th e upper $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf suggest relatively little compaction in this interval. Comparison between $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity values from discrete measurements, those from the downhole logging data, and those predicted by core-log-seismic integration (CLSI) suggests that velocit y values from discrete core measurements in the upper ${\sim}225$ mbsf ar e realistic but that velocity values are anomalously low deeper tha n ${\sim}225$ mbsf.  

Also similar to Hole M0078A, significant variations in Hol e M0079A were observed in many physical properties between th e marine and isolated/semi-isolated subunits in Unit 1, althoug h some of these differences are less pronounced in Hole M0079A. Marine subunits tend to have higher NGR values and lower and les s scattered magnetic susceptibility values than isolated/semi-isolate d subunits (Figure F9). Lower density values are commonly associated with marine subunits and/or with transitions at the boundarie s of these subunits. Conversely, shear strength and velocity appear t o increase in some marine subunits. Some of the marine subunit s have lower mean $L^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ values and higher mean $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ values compared with means for the hole from color reflectance data.  

The lithostratigraphic Unit 1/2 boundary does not have a clea r expression in physical properties measurements.  

# Site M0080  

Physical properties from Hole M0080A cores show more variability than at Sites M0078 and M0079, reflecting the greater diversity of lithologies and depositional environments encountered. Most lithostratigraphic unit boundaries have a clear signature in th e physical properties data. A change was also observed in the majorit y of physical properties data sets at the boundary between Subunit s 3-1 and 3-2 at $\mathord{\sim}350$ mbsf. Density values increase steadily wit h depth, consistent with compaction and strengthening (Figure F10) . Resistivity shows slightly more complex variation with depth, with  a pronounced increase in values downhole at the Unit $3/4$ boundary.  

Variations in physical properties reflecting environmental variation in Unit 1 were observed, as at Sites M0078 and M0079. In Uni t 1, density and magnetic susceptibility increase and porosity an d NGR decrease in isolated/semi-isolated intervals relative to the marine intervals. Marine subunits have lower mean $L^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ value s and higher mean $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ values compared with means for the hole fro m color reflectance data. Density, color reflectance, and porosity values become more scattered in the lower part of Unit 2 and transitioning into Unit 3. NGR decreases and then increases in Unit 3, followed by a sharp decrease into Unit 4 (Figure F10). Magnetic susceptibility increases in Unit 3, with a slight decrease with depth an d a sharp reduction into Unit 4. These trends are thought to reflec t the varied composition of the changing subaqueous and subaeria l sequences in these units (see Lithostratigraphy).  

Velocity data from discrete measurements in Units 1 and 2 ar e relatively low, but some values are consistent with sonic data acquired by downhole logging. In Units 3 and 4, both discrete an d MSCL $P$ -wave data appear to be more reliable. Velocity values average $2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ in the lower part of Unit 3. Unit 4 is characterized b y increased velocity values but with variations between the two cor e velocity data sets (discrete and MSCL).  

# Paleomagnetism  

# Site M0078  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured on 501 discrete cubi c samples from Holes M0078A and M0078B, and the results show  a good match with MSCL magnetic susceptibility. Above ${\sim}300~\mathrm{mbsf},$ magnetic susceptibility variations are relatively small and exhibi t different patterns in marine and isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Much higher variability in magnetic susceptibility was observed below $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf. Overall, magnetic susceptibility and natural remnant magnetization (NRM) exhibit similar variations with depth, suggesting that susceptibility is primarily controlled by the concentration of magnetic minerals in the sediment.  

Thermal variation of magnetic susceptibility was determined o n five representative samples at the University of Hawaii prior to th e OSP. Most samples show a primary Curie temperature of $518^{\circ}-$ $577^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , indicating the occurrence of Ti-poor titanomagnetite, although a couple of lower Curie temperatures were also identifie d and may indicate the additional occurrence of greigite.  

The direction and intensity of NRM were determined on al l samples from Holes M0078A and M0078B. The inclination value s are dominantly positive (normal polarity) in Unit 1, which correspond to the Brunhes Normal Chron $(0{-}0.773\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . Anomalousl y low inclination of the remanence of few samples from this uppermost interval may represent excursions of the geomagnetic fiel d within the Brunhes Chron. Below the Unit 1–2 transition, inclination values are dominantly negative (reversed polarity), althoug h several samples with normal polarity are also present. According t o these data, the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary appears to be locate d at 385.99 mbsf, although both the occurrence and precise depth o f this boundary remains highly speculative at this stage, and furthe r postexpedition analysis will be needed.  

# Site M0079  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured on 542 samples fro m Hole M0079A, and the results show a good match with MSCL magnetic susceptibility. Above $\mathord{\sim}540$ mbsf, magnetic susceptibility variations are relatively small and exhibit different patterns in marin e and isolated/semi-isolated subunits. Much higher variability i n magnetic susceptibility was observed below $\mathord{\sim}540$ mbsf. Overall, magnetic susceptibility and NRM exhibit similar variations wit h depth, suggesting that susceptibility is primarily controlled by th e concentration of magnetic minerals in the sediment.  

Thermal variation of magnetic susceptibility was determined o n eight representative samples at the University of Hawaii prior to th e  

OSP. The results of the thermomagnetic experiments reveal a wid e range of Curie temperatures between $364^{\circ}$ and $595\mathrm{^\circC}$ . However, most of the samples show a primary Curie temperature betwee n $502^{\circ}$ and $585\mathrm{^\circC_{:}}$ , which is typical of Ti-poor titanomagnetite. Othe r Curie temperatures between $364^{\circ}$ and $486^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ suggest the additional occurrence  of  iron  sulfides  (likely  greigite)  or  Ti-rich  titanomagnetite.  

The direction and intensity of NRM were determined on al l samples from Hole M0079A. The inclination values are dominantl y positive (normal polarity) in Unit 1, with the exception of two samples that show a negative inclination (reversed polarity). This uppermost  normal  polarity  interval  to  667.13  mbsf  appears  t o correspond to the Brunhes Normal Chron $(0{-}0.773\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ), with th e two reversed polarity samples possibly representing excursions o f the geomagnetic field (Singer, 2014). The occurrence and precis e depth of the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary and excursions at thi s stage remain highly speculative, and further postexpedition analyses will be needed. Furthermore, the inclination values show a wide r variability from negative to positive below 667.13 mbsf throughou t Unit 2, making the interpretation of the magnetostratigraphy fo r this interval challenging.  

# Site M0080  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured on 379 samples fro m Hole M0080A, and the results show a good match with MSCL susceptibility. Above ${\sim}250$ mbsf, magnetic susceptibility variations ar e relatively small. A much higher variability, with overall higher values of susceptibility, was observed between ${\sim}250$ and ${\sim}460$ mbsf, likely related to the occurrence of mafic ophiolitic clasts in Unit 3. Magnetic susceptibility and NRM exhibit similar variations wit h depth, suggesting that susceptibility is primarily controlled by th e concentration of magnetic minerals in the sediment.  

Thermal variation of magnetic susceptibility was determined o n six representative samples at the University of Hawaii prior to th e OSP. The results of the thermomagnetic experiments reveal a wid e range of Curie temperatures between $116^{\circ}$ and $646^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , indicating th e occurrence of mixtures of Ti-rich titanomagnetite, iron sulfide s (likely greigite), and likely oxidized titanomagnetite (i.e., titanomaghemite).  

The direction and intensity of NRM were determined on 37 9 samples from Hole M0080A. The inclination values are dominantl y positive (normal polarity) in Units 1 and 2 and the uppermost par t of Unit 3, with six samples showing a negative inclination (reverse d polarity). At greater depths, samples have a dominantly negative inclination (reversed polarity) that become positive again toward th e bottom of the hole. The polarity transition observed in Unit 3 likel y corresponds to the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary $(0.773\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , an d the reversed polarity intervals observed in the uppermost normal polarity interval may represent excursions of the geomagnetic fiel d during  the  Brunhes  Normal  Chron.  However,  further  postexpedition analyses are needed to confirm these hypotheses.  

# Downhole logging  

Because of hole stability problems and the loss of tools in on e hole, only partial logging of the three sites was conducted. At Sit e M0078, logging operations were conducted, but data are probabl y not usable. At Site M0079, a limited suite of logging tools was deployed, primarily in the upper ${\sim}295\mathrm{~m~}$ of the hole. At Site M0080,  a full suite of standard logging tools was used to collect data throug h almost the entire borehole.  

# Site M0079  

Downhole logging data were collected through the pipe (gamm a ray) from the bottom of Hole M0079A to the seafloor and in the upper part of the open hole with logs recording magnetic susceptibility and conductivity $\leftmoon297$ to ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wireline log depth belo w seafloor [WSF]), sonic velocity ( $\mathord{\sim}230$ to ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ WSF), and dual resistivity ( ${\sim}290{-}50\ \mathrm{m}$ WSF). Gamma ray values, even though measured through the pipe, compare well with MSCL data collected o n cores. The overall trend shows some correspondence to the marin e and isolated/semi-isolated intervals. The slumped interval described in the deeper part of Unit 1 (484.48–506.40 mbsf; see Lithostratigraphy) is associated with a clear drop in gamma ray count s from the through pipe data. Resistivity values derived from the conductivity data (magnetic susceptibility and conductivity tool) an d collected with the dual resistivity log compare well with each othe r and with MSCL resistivity data acquired on cores, and the value s indicate low resistivity in the formation (typically $<\!5\,\Omega\mathrm{m})$ ). Trends i n the magnetic susceptibility log acquired downhole mirror thos e from MSCL data on cores, with a clear variation associated wit h changing basin environment: magnetic susceptibility tends to b e lower in marine intervals/subunits and higher and more scattere d in the isolated/semi-isolated intervals/subunits. Sonic data sugges t low velocity, typically between 1500 and $1700\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ from 50 to $190\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF and increasing to values as high as ${\sim}1900\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ from 190 to 23 0 m WSF.

Hole M0080A logging operations were very successful, wit h most of the hole (0 to ${\sim}530~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) covered with a suite of standar d logging tools: spectral gamma ray through pipe and magnetic susceptibility and conductivity, dual induction resistivity, sonic, an d spectral gamma ray in the open hole. Spectral gamma ray data wer e acquired through the pipe from the bottom of the hole to the seafloor and in the open hole principally from ${\sim}370$ to $50\,\mathrm{m}$ WSF. Magnetic susceptibility and conductivity data cover most of the hole, with gaps from ${\sim}220$ to ${\sim}230~\mathrm{m}$ WSF and at $430\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. Dual induction (resistivity) data cover the hole from ${\sim}370$ to $50\textrm{m}$ WSF, with a gap from ${\sim}220$ to ${\sim}230\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. Sonic data cover from th e bottom of the hole to $50~\mathrm{m}$ WSF, with gaps from ${\sim}430$ to ${\sim}370\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF and from ${\sim}230$ to ${\sim}220\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ .  

The collected logs reflect the main lithostratigraphic units identified in Hole M0080A. In particular, magnetic susceptibility lo g data clearly respond to the changing depositional environments an d sediment composition. Unit 1 is characterized by gamma ray count s of 50–100 counts/s, low magnetic susceptibility values, and relatively low velocity values between 1500 and $1600~\mathrm{m/s}$ , consisten t with some of the discrete velocity measurements. Gamma ray increases in marine subunits, and magnetic susceptibility shows locally higher values in the isolated/semi-isolated subunits of Unit 1. In Unit 2, the gamma ray counts are lower than in Unit 1 and magnetic susceptibility remains low with local increases in Subunits 2- 4 and 2-5. Velocity values increase to $1700{-}2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ in Unit 2. Magnetic susceptibility increases significantly in Unit 3, associated wit h increased scattering, and then progressively decreases downhole i n Units 3 and 4. Similar scattering was observed in the resistivity data. Sonic velocity increases to values $>\!2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Data in this unit ma y be affected by poorer and variable borehole conditions. At th e boundary between Subunits 3-1 and 3-2, magnetic susceptibilit y decreases, gamma ray increases, and resistivity and sonic velocit y sharply increase. In Unit 4, gamma ray (through pipe) drops to it s lowest values, magnetic susceptibility remains low with little variation, and sonic velocity increases abruptly to values close to 300 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ .  

Velocity data acquired on whole-round cores (MSCL) and discrete samples and from downhole logs show similar trends, but values differ slightly in some parts of the hole. In particular, in th e deeper part of the hole (Unit 4) MSCL data indicate velocity value s that are ${\sim}500{-}1000\ \mathrm{m/s}$ slower than sonic velocity values, and discrete core measurement values sit between these two data sets.  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

The goal of CLSI during Expedition 381 was to tie data and observations from each of the sites to the extensive seismic reflectio n database available in the Gulf of Corinth (e.g., Sachpazi et al., 2003; Zelt et al., $2004;$ Taylor et al., 2011; McNeill et al., 2005; Bell et al., 2008, 2009; Lykousis et al., 2007; Sakellariou et al., 2007; Collier e t al., 2000; Leeder et al., 2002, 2005; Stefatos et al., 2002; Charalampakis et al., 2014; Nixon et al., 2016) (e.g., Figure F3). Synthetic seismograms were calculated with MSCL and MAD density and, wher e available, with velocity information from downhole logging, cor e physical properties, or existing pre-expedition velocity profiles derived from seismic data.  

# Site M0078  

Synthetic seismograms for Site M0078 (Figure F5) were calculated from MSCL density data from Holes M0078A and M0078 B and a linear velocity function estimated from seismic data befor e the expedition. Unfortunately, neither core MSCL nor discrete $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ measurements produced reliable velocity data for Site M0078, an d no downhole logging data were collected. Nonetheless, the synthetic seismograms can be reliably tied to the seismic data using th e pre-expedition velocity function. Minor adjustments to the velocit y function were made to match prominent reflections in the syntheti c seismogram to those in the coincident seismic data. Above 25 0 mbsf, the main high-reflectivity horizons in lithostratigraphic Uni t 1 (seismic Unit 2) correspond to marine subunits, confirming th e interpretations of Nixon et al. (2016) and other previous authors. However, the marine intervals are sometimes thinner than estimated from the reflection data prior to the expedition. In the lowe r part of Unit 1 (below ${\sim}250~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), correlating seismic reflector s with subunit boundaries becomes more challenging because thi s part of the section is condensed and parts of the section may b e missing. In this depth range, observed marine and isolated/semiisolated subunits sometimes correspond to the seismic phases bu t sometimes differ. The lower reflectivity sequences of lithostratigraphic Unit 2 (seismic Unit 1; Figure F5) proved to be more challenging to match to seismic reflection data because of the lack o f impedance contrasts in the core and seismic records. However, a t least two low-reflectivity horizons in Unit 2 can be potentiall y traced in the synthetic seismogram and tied to seismic data.  

# Site M0079  

MSCL density data were combined with an integrated velocit y function to calculate synthetic seismograms at Site M0079. The velocity function was created from discrete velocity values and soni c data from downhole logging in the upper part of Hole M0079A an d a velocity function based on preliminary offshore CLSI in the lowe r part of the hole, where other velocity data were not available.  A comparison of all available velocity information indicates that th e upper $\mathord{\sim}200$ mbsf is characterized by relatively low velocity value s that suggest limited compaction, consistent with other physical properties. Further minor adjustments to the velocity function wer e made to match prominent reflections in the synthetic seismogra m to those in the coincident seismic data. Synthetic seismograms exhibit patterns of high and low reflectivity similar to those observe d in seismic data crossing the site (Figure F6). Intervals of high reflectivity in synthetic seismograms correspond to marine subunits fro m lithostratigraphic Unit 1, confirming the interpretations of Nixon e t al. (2016) and previous authors. In detail, CLSI demonstrates tha t the tops of marine intervals correspond to the onsets of high-reflectivity intervals. In the lower part of Unit 1, the relationship betwee n bright reflections and marine subunits is more complex, likely owing to the small thicknesses of marine subunits in this part of th e hole. The deepest reflection, interpreted to be the unit boundary i n seismic data, may in fact correspond to the deepest marine interva l in lithostratigraphic Unit 1.  

# Site M0080  

For Site M0080, MSCL density data were combined with a velocity function created from discrete velocity values, sonic dat a from downhole logging, and velocity values from offshore MSC L data to calculate synthetic seismograms. A comparison of all available velocity information indicates that the upper $\mathord{\sim}140$ mbsf i s characterized by relatively low velocity values that suggest limite d compaction, consistent with other physical properties. From $\mathord{\sim}150$ to ${\sim}450\,\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ an increase in velocity corresponds, on average, to th e velocity function estimated from seismic data before the expedition. Below ${\sim}450$ mbsf, a significant difference in average MSCL velocit y values and the downhole logging velocity values occurs, with th e former suggesting a lower range of ${\sim}2000{-}2500~\mathrm{m/s}$ and the latte r varying from ${\sim}2500$ to $3500\ \mathrm{m/s}$ . Both velocity scenarios were utilized for synthetic seismogram generation to determine sensitivit y to uncertainty in the input velocity profile.  

Synthetic seismograms at Site M0080 match the coincident seismic data remarkably well. The four lithostratigraphic units identified from the cores have visibly different expressions in the seismi c data around the site (Figure F7). Lithostratigraphic Unit 1, a succession of relatively thin marine and isolated/semi-isolated subunits, exhibits a series of continuous reflectors with a very pronounce d positive phase, likely produced by the change to lower density in th e marine intervals. Select subunit boundaries can be reliably trace d from the cores to the seismic data. Lithostratigraphic Unit 2 is characterized by a series of continuous reflectors with equally pronounced positive and negative phases. Lithostratigraphic Unit 3 ha s a more complex reflectivity signature characterized by discontinuous reflectors and some gaps in reflectivity, corresponding to th e conglomerates in Subunit 3-1 and potential faults at the base o f Subunit 3-2.  

Below ${\sim}450~\mathrm{mbsf_{\mathrm{:}}}$ , the synthetic seismogram and its correlatio n with lithostratigraphic Unit 4 varies significantly depending on th e input velocity model, making correlations significantly more uncertain. For the case of lower input velocity values derived from MSC L data, the top and bottom of Unit 4 are marked by two distinct reflectors, the shallower of which was previously attributed to the to p of acoustic basement (Nixon et al., 2016) but could now be interpreted to be the transition into basal conglomerates. Alternatively, using the higher velocity values derived from the downhole log data, the whole of Unit 4 maps onto the upper of these two reflectors, an d subunit boundaries in Unit 4 cannot be resolved. In this case, th e reflector interpreted to be the top of acoustic basement would b e intersected at the very bottom of Hole M0080A. Based on the properties of the cored materials, the latter interpretation is favored, bu t further work will be required to distinguish between these two endmembers.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

The overarching objective of Expedition 381 was to drill, sample, and analyze the synrift sedimentary sequence that records a n extended period of the early stage continental rifting process in th e Corinth rift, Greece. This is the first time a record of this length an d resolution has been recovered in an active rift system. In th e Corinth rift, part of the rift depositional record is preserved onshore, but the most recent sequence is only present offshore. Onshore, only limited dating of the sedimentary sequence has bee n possible; therefore, there is little constraint on timing and rates o f geological processes. Obtaining this new drilled record will make i t possible to develop the chronostratigraphy, determine the environment of the basin through its rift development history, quantif y changes in depositional processes and sediment flux in the basin, and determine the rates and timings of rift and fault development, fault slip, and fault activity history.  

Expedition 381 was extremely successful. The drilling and coring objectives were almost completely achieved, and a total of 164 5 m of core was recovered from three sites over a $1905\;\mathrm{m}$ cored interval. At Site M0078, the borehole depth was shortened slightly because of projected time constraints; therefore, an intended part o f the older synrift section was not recovered. At Site M0080, the drilling target was to reach acoustic basement (the older sedimentar y sequences underlying the synrift sequence). Basal conglomerate s interpreted to immediately overlie basement were recovered, bu t insufficient time remained to continue to basement itself. Becaus e of hole stability problems and the loss of tools in one hole, only partial logging of the three sites was conducted. At Site M0078, loggin g operations were conducted, but data are probably not usable. At Sit e M0079, a limited suite of logging tools was deployed, primarily i n the upper ${\sim}295\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hole. At Site M0080, a full suite of standar d logging tools was used to collect data through almost the entir e borehole. In spite of these (relatively minor) changes to the operational program, the combined coring and logging data sets collecte d will fully enable us to address the objectives of the expedition. Cor e recovery was excellent (average $=\,86\%$ ), and core quality is goo d overall. Changes to coring and drilling methods during the expedition significantly improved subsequent core quality and increase d rates of progress, enabling the three sites to be completed ver y nearly as planned in the time available.  

The potential range of scientific applications for this uniqu e data set is very large, encompassing tectonics, sedimentary processes, paleoenvironment, paleoclimate, paleoecology, geochemistry, and geohazards. We anticipate exciting and important result s from both the postexpedition research and from research endeavor s beyond the science party for many years to come.  

# Active rift sedimentary processes  

The three drill sites of Expedition 381 capture a long and highresolution record of sedimentation in the center of the Gulf o f Corinth and Alkyonides Gulf, with primarily fine grained, distal sediment gravity flow and hemipelagic deposits. The core material s show a clear link to the changing environment of the basin in th e most recent synrift succession, namely an alternation between  a marine environment during global sea level highstands and an isolated/semi-isolated environment during global sea level lowstand s (Unit 1). In the marine intervals, sediments are predominantly homogeneous bioturbated muddy sediments with a marine biogeni c assemblage. In the isolated/semi-isolated intervals, sediments ten d to exhibit clearer bedding and fine-scale lamination, with coarse r laminations and beds apparently more pronounced. Sediment composition, primarily carbonate, shows a clear correlation with onshore drainage basins and sediment sources, and grain analyses wil l be used in postexpedition research to assess changes in provenance. Organic components are common in the sediments, possibly wit h both marine and terrestrial sources, and these components in tur n affect the geochemistry of the sediments and pore waters. In th e deeper and older rift sequences of the sites in the central gulf (Uni t 2; Sites M0078 and M0079; Figure F1), sediments become more homogeneous and lack the clear cyclical signature related to th e changing environment of the basin driven by global sea level, a s seen in the overlying sequence. Slump and debris flow deposits appear to be more common at depth in the sequence, in particular a t Site M0079, and may reflect a change in rift faulting activity and/o r sediment flux.  

In the Alkyonides Gulf at Site M0080 (Figure F1), the sedimentary sequence is more variable than at sites in the central gulf (Site s M0078 and M0079). These differences may reflect the smalle r drainage systems feeding the basin, the shallower water depth of th e site, closer proximity to the shoreline, and/or greater variability o f onshore basement lithology. At depth at Site M0080, terrestrial alluvial–fluvial sequences and deposits indicative of a shallow ephemeral  basin  fluctuating  between  a  subaqueous  and  subaeria l environment are preserved. These deposits predate the most recen t phase of deeper water deposition affected by changing global se a level. The exact age of these older deposits is not yet clear, but the y may include a record of an earlier phase of Corinth rifting than tha t penetrated by the boreholes in the central gulf (Sites M0078 an d M0079). Correlation of the earliest deposits at all three sites wit h the onshore exhumed synrift sequences will be a crucial element o f postexpedition research to generate a complete history of Corint h rift evolution and deposition and to identify any along-axis variations in rift evolutionary history.  

# Paleoenvironment of the Corinth rift basin  

Sediments from the most recent rift phase reveal substantia l temporal variations in paleoenvironment in the Gulf of Corinth tha t appear to be controlled by sea level fluctuations with respect to th e topographic sills bounding this semi-isolated basin and the suppl y of riverine water to the basin (McNeill et al., submitted). Thes e changes are manifest in varying microfossil assemblages, sedimen t lithology, physical properties, and the chemistry of the basin sediments and pore fluids. During marine periods when the gulf wa s connected to the global oceans, typical assemblages of marin e microfossils were observed, including combinations of benthic an d planktonic foraminifers, marine diatoms, calcareous nannofossils, and marine dinoflagellate cysts; however, the abundance and diversity of microfossil groups vary between sites and with time. Durin g isolated/semi-isolated periods when the gulf appears to have bee n fully or partially cut off from the global ocean, microfossil assemblages  are  often  complex,  suggesting  multifaceted  paleoenvironmental conditions. The transitions between the marine an d isolated/semi-isolated  intervals  expressed  in  the  micropaleontological and sedimentary record are particularly comple x and varied in their length and character. Pollen analysis of the deposits also provides a link between the terrestrial and aquatic environments. The sea level–driven paleoenvironmental change in th e late Quaternary basin is also recorded in the lithology and geochemistry of the most recent synrift sediments. The volume an d mode of sediment delivery into the rift basin appear to change between marine and isolated/semi-isolated intervals (McNeill et al., submitted). Variations in the geochemistry of the sediments an d pore fluids were also observed over this part of the drilled interval, with apparent links to the paleoenvironmental changes (C.M. Mille r et al., unpubl. data).  

At greater depths in the boreholes, older parts of the synrift sedimentary fill (Unit 2; Sites M0078 and M0079) appear to be dominantly nonmarine, suggesting that at least the central gulf wa s primarily isolated during this earlier phase. Although extended intervals are devoid of microfossils, likely as a result of poor preservation (e.g., dissolution, scavenging, etc.), significant bioturbation wa s observed; therefore, the environmental conditions in these period s are less clear. In the Alkyonides Gulf of the eastern rift (Site M0080), the recovered synrift sediments from earlier phases of basin development indicate both terrestrial and subaqueous conditions.  

Further postexpedition research and integration of micropaleontological, sedimentological, and geochemical observation s and analyses will be needed to more fully understand the comple x changes in paleoenvironment over the history of the Corinth rif t and how these changes relate to its tectonic and climatic evolutio n and its connectivity to the Mediterranean. Comparisons with othe r basins with varying paleoenvironments, such as the Sea of Marmar a and the Black Sea, will form part of this process. The Corinth rif t cores will also provide a new, long Quaternary record of Mediterranean-type climate in the region, complementing long records farther north in the southern Balkans–Greece, such as from Lak e Ohrid, Lake Kopais, Lake Ioannina, Tenaghi Philippon (e.g., Tzedakis et al., 2009; Sadori et al., 2016), and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Sea.  

# Chronostratigraphy  

One of the primary objectives of Expedition 381 was to obtai n age constraints on synrift sediments that can be used to quantif y rates of tectonic and sedimentary processes at high temporal resolution in this young and active rift. Shipboard characterization o f the recovered cores indicates that this objective will be achievabl e by using a suite of complementary dating and paleoenvironmental characterization methods, although this process will take time an d will be challenging. Shipboard analyses have already yielded important age constraints that will be greatly expanded by postexpedition research efforts.  

Shipboard  efforts  included  biostratigraphy,  magnetostratigraphy, and, less directly, identification of alternating basin conditions linked to past sea level fluctuations and glacial–interglacial cycles (McNeill et al., submitted). Two key calcareous nannofossil markers were observed in the sedimentary record of the most recent rifting phase: E. huxleyi (FO at $0.29\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) and $P\!\!\!\!/$ lacunosa (LO a t $0.43\mathrm{\Ma})$ . However, because the basin alternates between marin e and isolated conditions and thus does not possess a continuous record of marine microfossils, interpreting these biohorizons must b e undertaken  with  care.  Magnetostratigraphy  provides  baselin e chronological ties for the drilled section, including probable identification of the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary at all sites and potential  correlations  with  other  earlier  chrons.  With  furthe r postexpedition research, the opportunity to identify excursions o f the geomagnetic field and to develop and correlate with the global RPI record should further improve the resolution of the chronostratigraphy.  Finally,  pinpointing  changes  in  basin  paleoenvironment linked to glacial–interglacial cycles also provide s indirect age constraints. These data indicate that the most recen t phase of rift deformation is late Quaternary and that pre-expeditio n correlations with glacial–interglacial cycles are broadly correct. Th e penultimate phase of rift deformation also appears to be Quaternary in age, but further analysis is required to pinpoint ages mor e precisely and to examine any spatial variations in rift history.  

The cores clearly contain a rich trove of material that can b e used to provide further age constraints. To develop a final ag e model for each site, shipboard results will be complemented by  a series of postexpedition research efforts, including radiocarbon dating of the youngest sediments, stable isotope analyses from the marine intervals, magnetic RPI, and tephrochronology. The results wil l be crucial for studies of rift evolution, sedimentary processes, an d paleoenvironment.  

# Structure and deformation  

The three drill sites were purposely located away from majo r seismic-scale faulting to maximize recovery of a complete stratigraphic sequence and to avoid the challenges of drilling throug h faults. However, small-scale conjugate normal faulting, compatibl e with the present-day extensional regime, was observed in the core d sequence at all three sites.  

Faults are also common in the deeper part of Site M0080 in th e Alkyonides Gulf of the eastern Corinth rift where they record  a more complex deformation history that reflects the probable longe r sedimentary record captured here. Quantification of the core-scal e structures and their integration with seismic-scale structures imaged throughout the extensive seismic reflection database will contribute toward characterizing subseismic strain in an active rif t environment. This is an elusive but significant parameter for reliably calculating strain and for estimating the integrity of petroleu m reservoirs and traps.  

# Rift evolution  

Expedition 381 objectives on rift evolution will be principall y achieved during postexpedition research. Postexpedition analyse s will build on the shipboard analyses to develop a high-resolutio n chronology for the synrift sequence sampled (e.g., biostratigraphy, tephrochronology, magnetostratigraphy, magnetic RPI, radiocarbon, and stable and radiogenic isotopes). Core and log velocity an d density data will be the basis for improved CLSI, enabling correlation of the drill cores with the extensive seismic data set, in particular increasing the precision of seismic reflector ties and time-dept h conversion.  These  new  sedimentary,  physical  properties,  an d chronological data sets will be used to provide considerably improved constraints on ages of synrift seismic stratigraphic horizon s and hence fault displacements, sediment thicknesses, volumes an d compaction history, and the timing of major rift events. Thus, w e will be able to determine rift fault activity and slip rates in space an d time, including in the very recent past for the purposes of hazar d assessment, the timing and rate of development of the rift fault network, and the longer term rift evolution, including discrete rif t phases and changes in rates of extension and subsidence. Analysis o f the stratigraphic sequence, including sediment provenance and calculation of sediment fluxes in space and time, and its integratio n and correlation with the onshore elements of the rift sequence wil l allow for building a model of rift basin and sedimentary development. By tying these data with existing data and new data fro m drilling on the regional paleoclimate and vegetation cover and th e paleoenvironment of the basin, the relative roles of climate, tectonics, and sea level/water depth on sediment flux into the basin an d the history of basin filling can be unraveled (see preliminary result s in McNeill et al., submitted). The integration of drilling data, seismic network, and preserved sequences onshore will provide  a unique opportunity to model the temporal and 3-D spatial tectoni c and sedimentological development of a young rift basin.
