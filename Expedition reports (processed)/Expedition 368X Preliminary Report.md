# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditio n 368X is the third of three cruises that form the South China Se a Rifted Margin program. Expeditions 367, 368, and 368X share th e common key objectives of testing scientific hypotheses of breaku p of the northern South China Sea (SCS) margin and comparing it s rifting style and history to other nonvolcanic or magma-poor rifte d margins. Four primary sites were selected for the overall program: one in the outer margin high (OMH) and three seaward of th e OMH on distinct, margin-parallel basement ridges informally labeled Ridges A, B, and C from north to south. The ridges are locate d in the continent–ocean transition (COT) zone ranging from th e OMH to the interpreted steady-state oceanic crust (Ridge C) of th e SCS. The main scientific objectives include  

1. Determining the nature of the basement in crustal units across the COT of the SCS that are critical to constrain style of rifting,   
2. Constraining the time interval from initial crustal extension and plate rupture to the initial generation of igneous ocean crust,   
3. Constraining vertical crustal movements during breakup, and   
4. Examining the nature of igneous activity from rifting to seafloor spreading.  

In addition, sediment cores from the drill sites targeting primarily tectonic and basement objectives will provide information on th e Cenozoic regional environmental development of the Southeas t Asia margin.  

Expedition 368X was planned to reoccupy a site started durin g Expedition 368. Because of repeated breakdowns of the low clutc h diaphragm in the drawworks, Hole U1503A was abandoned afte r installing casing to $991.5~\mathrm{m}$ . Despite this setback to Expedition 36 8 and the South China Sea Rifted Margin program, Hole U1503A wa s completed during Expedition 368X. The overarching scientific goa l of IODP Expeditions 367 and 368 was to unveil the mechanisms o f continental breakup at the northern SCS margin from riftin g through steady-state spreading. A key operational objective of Sit e U1503 was to sample the lowermost ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediments on top o f basement to constrain the age and subsidence history of the crust a t this location, the timing of normal faulting, and the environment o f the early half-graben fill. A second important goal was to sample a t least ${100}\,\mathrm{m}$ of the igneous basement. Deep representative samplin g of the igneous material at this site will provide an important reference frame for the modeling of breakup and early ocean spreading.  

In Hole U1503A, the sediment sequence was cored with the rotary core barrel (RCB) system from 995.1 to $1597.84\mathrm{~m~}$ $\left(602.74\mathrm{~m~}\right)$ penetration; $128.01\,\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $21\%$ ) and then the underlyin g basement was continuously cored from 1597.84 to $1710.1~\mathrm{~m~}$ $\left\langle112.26\:\mathrm{m}\right.$ penetration; $47.91\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $43\%$ ). Although loggin g deeper than $991.5\;\mathrm{m}$ (bottom of casing) was not possible because o f unstable hole conditions, Hole U1503A was logged with the Vertica l Seismic Imager in the cased portion of the hole. No days were los t to waiting on weather, and the only mechanical downtime was  a $1.5\,\mathrm{h}$ period when an electrical malfunction caused the top drive t o shut down for repairs.  

Expedition 368X successfully completed the operational objectives in Hole U1503A that were abandoned during Expedition 368. In the SCS margin science program, material recovered durin g Expedition 368X will contribute toward meeting the four specifi c objectives of Expeditions 367 and 368. Postexpedition research o n the sediments and basalt recovered from Hole U1503A will allo w for determination of emplacement age and geochemical analyses o f rock composition and assessment of melting processes and age o f crystallization. The combination of such analyses will contribute t o geochemical or thermomechanical modeling that will constrai n mantle origin and melting processes leading to the formation o f these basalts.  

# Introduction  

The South China Sea (SCS) margin (Figures F1, F2, F3) is a n accessible and well-imaged location where drilling of synrift sediments and underlying basement will provide key constraints on th e processes of rifting and eventual rupturing of the continental lithosphere during breakup at a highly extended rifted margin. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditions 367, 368, an d 368X were based on drilling Proposals 878-CPP, 878-Add, 878- Add2, and 878-Add3. This project was implemented as a single science program, initially with 114 days of drilling operations sprea d across two IODP expeditions, as outlined in the Expedition 367/36 8 Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Deep representative sampling of the basaltic material at Site U1503 would have provided a n important reference frame for the modeling of breakup; however, planned operational objectives in Hole U1503A were not achieve d during Expedition 368.  

Expedition 368 installed a reentry system and $991.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of casin g $10\%$ inch) in Hole U1503A but the hole could not be deepene d because of mechanical problems with the drawworks, including  a fourth clutch diaphragm failure and a breakdown of the aft shaf t bearing on one of the Elmagco brakes. The continuing failures o f the low clutch diaphragm and the lack of available spares to las t until the end of the expedition limited the operation of the ship’ s drilling equipment to shallower than $3400\;\mathrm{m}$ . Therefore, Site U150 3 was abandoned without achieving the scientific objectives. Befor e departing Site U1503 during Expedition 368, the reentry system i n Hole U1503A was inspected by subsea camera. The cone appeare d to be $1\mathrm{-}2\;\mathrm{m}$ below the seafloor but was clearly visible and expecte d to be available for reentry at a later date. Expedition 368X was abl e to take advantage of a unique opportunity in the R/V JOIDES Resolution schedule that resulted from forced equipment repairs. Expedition 368X adds an additional 20 days of drilling operations to th e South China Sea margin science program. The drilling strategy fo r Expedition 368X was to finish the Expedition 368 Hole U1503 A operational objectives, including coring the lowermost sedimen t and basement and logging the hole. During Expedition 368X, th e sediment sequence was cored with the rotary core barrel (RCB ) system from 995.1 to $1597.84\mathrm{~m~}$ $\left(602.74\mathrm{~m~}\right)$ penetration; $128.01\textrm{m}$ recovered; $21\%$ ) and then the underlying basalt was continuousl y cored from 1597.84 to $1710.1\mathrm{~m~}$ $112.26\mathrm{~m~}$ penetration; $47.91\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered; $43\%$ ). Although logging deeper than $991.5\;\mathrm{m}$ (bottom o f casing) was not possible because of unstable hole conditions, Hol e U1503A was logged with the Vertical Seismic Imager (VSI) in th e cased portion of hole.  

# Background  

Global questions regarding formation of rifted margins  

The Ocean Drilling Program (ODP; 1985–2003) made a majo r effort to understand the processes of continental breakup along th e rifted margins of the North Atlantic (ODP Legs 103, 104, 149, 152, 163, 173, and 210). This effort resulted in the recognition of tw o end-members of rifted margins (see summary of observations i n Sun et al., 2016a, 2016b).  

The first recognized end-member is volcanic rifted margins, examples of which are characterized by massive igneous activity in  a relatively short period of time $_{\sim1-3}$ million years) during breaku p and initial seafloor spreading; the pair of conjugate margins o f Greenland and northwest Europe is an example of this type. In thes e locations, the asthenospheric mantle may have been anomalousl y hot (e.g., close to mantle plumes), which led to thermal weakenin g of the continental lithosphere followed by rapid plate rupture.  

The second recognized end-member is magma-poor rifted margins, which are interpreted to endure hyperextension of the continental crust, with tectonic extension at the distal margin eventuall y exhuming the subcontinental mantle lithosphere and leading to serpentinization of the mantle. The Newfoundland and Iberia pair o f conjugate margins, where serpentinite occupies a broad zone in th e COT zone, is an example of this type of margin and is the only conjugate margin pair where this interpretation has been confirmed b y scientific drilling. The introduction of water into the subcontinenta l lithospheric mantle is interpreted to have taken place through deep, crust-cutting faults, causing serpentinization that profoundly weakens the mantle lithosphere and facilitates plate rupture. The subsequent ultraslow spreading led to the formation of additiona l serpentinite on the seafloor (e.g., Dick et al., 2003) until sufficien t magma production allowed for the formation of normal oceani c crust.  

Elsewhere, other examples of highly extended rifted margin s have been identified in seismic reflection data (e.g., Brune et al., 2017; Doré and Lundin, 2015), but it is not known if serpentinize d mantle plays a critical role in all cases. Modeling by Huismans an d Beaumont (2008, 2011) suggests several scenarios for the formatio n of rifted margins in the absence of anomalously hot asthenospheri c mantle. One scenario (Type I of Huismans and Beaumont, 2011) i s the Iberia-Newfoundland-type margin described above. In thi s case, lithospheric thinning initially occurs in the (upper) crust, an d extensional faults profoundly thin the continental crust (hyperextension) and eventually reach the mantle and cause serpentinizatio n (Whitmarsh et al., 2001; Pérez-Gussinyé and Reston, 2001; PérezGussinyé et al., 2006; Reston, 2009; Sutra and Manatschal, 2012). The schematic model of this type of margin development (Figur e F4) guided the drilling strategy of Expeditions 367, 368, and 368X. Huismans and Beaumont (2008, 2011) also suggest, however, tha t final plate rupture can occur without exhumation of the subcontinental mantle and can be followed rather quickly by igneous ocea n crust formation, a scenario that our chosen drilling strategy als o tested. Therefore, the highly extended northern margin of the SC S is an excellent location to examine whether this margin endure d magmatism during breakup or whether its development is closer t o the Iberia-type, amagmatic margin.  

# Geological setting  

The SCS is a modestly sized young ocean basin that forme d along the eastern boundary of the Eurasian plate during the mid- t o late Cenozoic (Figure F1). Expeditions 367, 368, and 368X core d and logged a transect of drill sites across the COT in the norther n SCS (Figure F5).  

The continental crust that was rifted to form the SCS wa s accreted to the Asian margin during the Mesozoic (Zhou and Li, 2000; Zhou et al., 2008; Li et al., 2012a, 2012b). Starting about 8 0 million years later, this relatively young continental lithospher e underwent extensive rifting during the Paleogene, in the Eocene t o early Oligocene (Figure F3). Seafloor spreading in the eastern par t of the SCS started during the Oligocene, and the oldest magneti c anomaly in the area of the drilling transect is interpreted to b e Anomaly C11 $({\sim}29.5\,\mathrm{Ma})$ or $C12\mathrm{n}$ $\langle{\sim}31\,\mathrm{Ma}\rangle$ (Briais et al., 1993; Li e t al., 2013, 2014; Franke et al., 2013). Seafloor spreading in the southwest SCS started at ${\sim}23\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and even later in the most southwestern basin (Briais et al., 1993; Barckhausen and Roeser, $2004;$ Li et al., 2012a, 2012b; Franke et al., 2013).  

The initial half-spreading rate was ${\sim}3.6~\mathrm{cm/y}.$ It later slowed t o $1.2\;\mathrm{cm/y},$ and seafloor spreading eventually ceased by ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (e.g., Li et al., 2014). The initial spreading rate in the SCS basin therefor e appears to be higher than the ultraslow spreading off the IberiaNewfoundland margin (Dick, 2003). Subduction of the eastern par t of the SCS basin started at or before ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ along the Manil a Trench (Li et al., 2013). For a more complete review of the regiona l setting and tectonic development of the SCS, see Shi and Li (2012), Li et al. (2013), Sun et al. (2014), and Franke et al. (2013).  

The Expedition 367, 368, and 368X drilling transect is locate d ${\sim}50~\mathrm{km}$ west of IODP Site U1435 (Figures F1, F4, F5) (Li et al., 2015a, 2015b), along a segment of the northern SCS margi n bounded to the west by a transform fault. This margin segment exhibits a broad zone of extended crust (COT) (Figure F5) that ma y end to the east somewhere between IODP Sites U1432 and U1435. East of this segment, continental crust seems to thin into ocea n crust in a narrower COT.  

The segment of the SCS margin addressed during Expedition s 367, 368, and 368X is therefore characterized by a broad CO T $({\sim}150\,\mathrm{km})$ resulting from intense crustal stretching and extensio n prior to breakup. A deep sag basin (midslope basin [MSB]) of presumed Eocene to Oligocene age is present in the midslope area (Figure F5) and is bounded seaward by an outer margin high (OMH ) forming a quite persistent structure along the margin to the east. Three distinct ridges (A, B, and C from north to south in Figures F2, F5) are found seaward of the OMH in the more distal margin, representing progressively thinner continental crust in the COT or ocea n crust. We refer to the continent/ocean boundary (COB) as the narrow zone in which the outermost, highly thinned continental lithosphere is replaced seaward by new crust that formed at a narro w spreading ridge in a steady-state fashion. The latter can include continuous tectonic exhumation of lithospheric mantle (e.g., Dick et al., 2003), accretion of normal igneous oceanic crust, or a mixture o f these two processes. The nature and precise location of the COB a t the SCS cannot be interpreted with confidence from the seismi c data, and interpretation therefore requires drilling control.  

The clear seismic reflections from the Mohorovičić seismic discontinuity (Moho) show distinct thinning of the continental crus t (Figure F5) across the COT with a thickness of ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}$ around it s seaward end. Separate layers hypothesized to be upper, middle, an d lower crust are distinguished in the landward part of the seismi c profiles. The lower crust is acoustically transparent and may be a s thin as ${\sim}6~\mathrm{km}$ in places. Lower crust with a similar thickness an d seismic appearance is reported from the northeastern SCS margi n (McIntosh et al., 2013, 2014; Lester et al., 2013). The seaward continuation of this crustal layering into the COB zone is ambiguous, however, and prevents us from interpreting the exact location an d detailed nature of the COB.  

The upper crust shows numerous extensional faults soling out a t low-angle detachment faults in the midcrustal level. This fault system generated a number of deep half-grabens filled with synrift sediments which were subsequently covered by postrift sediments. Th e boundary between synrift sediments and postrift sediments mos t often follows the T70 seismic stratigraphic unconformity (Figur e F5). Results from distant industry wells, as well as those of IOD P Site U1435 suggest a breakup unconformity age of ${\sim}34\mathrm{~Ma}$ . However, the time of crustal extension is not necessarily synchronou s across the margin and could be younger toward the outer margin.  A younger, widely distributed unconformity (T60) is also observe d (Figure F5). The T60 unconformity corresponds to a hiatus a t ${\sim}23\,\mathrm{Ma}$ found at ODP Site 1148 (Wang, Prell, Blum, et al., 2000 ) and IODP Site U1435 and is approximately synchronous with  a southward jump and change in kinematics of the SCS spreadin g axis, and with the breakup in the southwest part of the basin (Briai s et al., 1993).  

The OMH hosts a number of relatively shallow half-grabe n basins on top of this broad basement high. The stratigraphy of thes e smaller basins can be traced seismically into the deeper, central basin sag below the MSB (Figure F5). The normal faults bounding th e OMH basins are clearly imaged and, for the main part, dip landward. The small rift basins therefore offer an opportunity to sampl e the stratigraphy covering the entire period of rifting and postrif t subsidence. The MSB itself is bounded landward by major, seawarddipping normal fault(s) that seemingly form major detachment s soling out at middle to lower crustal levels but not penetratin g through the lower crust. If true, this suggests that decouplin g between the upper and lower crust, and that at least in this mor e landward part of the margin, faults never penetrated the lower crus t (remained ductile?).  

The interpretation of some seismic profiles suggests that th e lower crust in the COT may thicken seaward but this observation i s not well constrained (Figure F5). Likewise, seismic imaging of th e low-angle faults and detachments in the landward part of the CO T cannot, with confidence, be traced into the distal margin regime. One possibility is that the main detachment zone was located abov e what later became Ridge A, effectively implying that Ridge A is  a core complex consisting of lower continental crust or subcontinental mantle depending on how deeply detachments exhumed th e lithosphere in the distal margin. Alternatively, if the main detachment underlies Ridge A, the latter would represent upper plat e material of upper crustal origin.  

Ridge A is domelike, for the most part, and shows neither normal faults nor clearly developed synrift half-grabens like the OMH. Excluding sediment and using the ocean-bottom seismomete r (OBS) velocity constraints of Yan et al. (2001), Wang et al. (2006), and Wei et al. (2011), the crust below this outermost basement hig h is estimated to be only ${\sim}6{-}8\ \mathrm{km}$ thick. Seaward of Ridge A, th e crust has a fairly uniform thickness of $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{km}$ , which could be consistent with oceanic crust (Yan et al., 2001; Li et al., 2014). The projection on the seismic profile of the magnetic lineation interprete d to be Anomaly C11 (Briais et al., 1993) coincides with the seawar d part of Ridge A (Figures F2, F3, F5).  

Both Ridges B and C consist of fault blocks rotated landwar d along seaward-dipping normal faults, some of which may be seismically traced to near the base of the crust. Ridge B shows seismi c features along strike and in the uppermost crust that could be consistent with a volcanic origin. However, these features could also b e consistent with a rotated fault block of upper continental crust (i.e., a distal extensional rider of upper plate origin), in which case prerif t deposits could be present beneath the seismic unconformity defining the top of acoustic basement at Ridge B. The seismic layere d structure of Ridge B makes it less likely to consist of lower crust o r serpentinized mantle. Ridge C, in many ways, is seismically simila r to Ridge B. However, the significant amplitude of the magneti c anomalies strongly suggests that Ridge C is indeed partial, if not full, igneous ocean crust.  

Sampling the basement at Ridges A, B, and C was therefor e essential for the SCS margin science program to distinguish between different tectonic models for breakup along highly extende d margins. Ridges A and B help constrain the style of rifting. In contrast, Ridge C is assumed to represent the early igneous crust, an d the material recovered here will address another key objective of th e SCS margin science program: to constrain the nature of early oceanic crust formation, specifically to determine how quickly a robus t igneous system was established, what mantle source is involve d (e.g., composition, temperature), what conditions of mantle meltin g (degree and depth of melting) were present, and what continenta l crustal contamination of the igneous material, if any, derived fro m the asthenospheric mantle.  

# Expedition objectives  

By drilling a transect across the SCS margin, expedition scientists set out to understand the timing and process of rifting, eventual rupturing of the continental crust, and onset of igneous oceani c crust at a highly extended rifted margin (Figure F4). Four primar y and sixteen alternate drill sites across a ${\sim}150~\mathrm{km}$ wide COT zon e were defined in the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Th e four primary sites were planned to target the four main tectonic features: the OMH (and its small rift basins) and the three basemen t ridges (A, B, and C) in the distal margin. At each of these sites, th e nature of the acoustic basement and the record of synrift an d postrift deposits were key targets.  

As part of the SCS margin science program, Expedition 368 X was planned to complete operations at Hole U1503A. The primar y operational objective at Site U1503 was to sample the lowermos t ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediments on top of basement and at least $100\;\mathrm{m}$ of th e igneous basement. The sedimentary target will constrain the ag e and subsidence history of the crust at this location, the timing o f normal faulting, and the environment of the early half-graben fill. The basement objective will provide deep representative samplin g of the basaltic material at this site and an important reference fram e for the modeling of breakup. Although logging (triple combinatio n [triple combo], Formation MicroScanner [FMS]-sonic, and VSI tool strings) into the basement was originally planned, the condition o f Hole U1503A deeper than ${\sim}1300\mathrm{~m~}$ was unstable and not suitabl e for logging. Logging deeper than $991.5\mathrm{~m~}$ (bottom of casing) wa s not possible because of unstable hole conditions, but Hole U1503 A was logged with the VSI in the cased portion of hole.  

# Coring and logging strategy  

Drilling operations were based on the original plans for Expedition 368, which were designed to core and log through thick sediment sections and, significantly, into underlying basement usin g casing in the upper, unstable part of the sedimentary section. Th e operational approach was to reenter Hole U1503A using the reentr y system and $991.5~\mathrm{m}$ of $10\%$ inch casing installed during Expeditio n 368 (Figure F6).  

Hole U1503A was designed for coring using the RCB system t o extend from the base of the casing through the sediments and int o the underlying basement. Multiple pipe trips to replace hard roc k RCB bits would be required by the depth of target within basement. Upon completion of the coring objectives, the RCB bit was to b e dropped either in the bottom of the hole or on the seafloor befor e downhole wireline logging data could be collected. For this deepe r logging, we planned to use the triple combo and FMS-sonic too l strings and the VSI tool string to conduct check shots.  

During Expedition 368X, we had to modify this general operational plan in response to borehole conditions and the need to focu s our operations time to achieve our highest priority basement objective. The reentry cone installed during Expedition 368 was observe d to be slightly below the level of the seafloor and full of debris fro m previous drilling in Hole U1503A. Thus, we installed a secondar y free-fall funnel (FFF) with a $2.7~\mathrm{m}$ extension into the reentry syste m to ensure our ability to reenter Hole U1503A during multiple pip e trips to replace RCB bits (see Operations). RCB coring fro m $995.1\;\mathrm{m}$ (below the casing) to $1710.1\;\mathrm{m}$ penetrated $602.74\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediments and $112.26\;\mathrm{m}$ of basement. We then tripped pipe out of th e hole, dropped the bit on the seafloor, and reentered Hole U1503A. Logging deeper than $991.5~\mathrm{m}$ was not possible because of unstabl e hole conditions, so Hole U1503A was logged with the VSI in th e cased portion of hole (end of casing at $991.5\;\mathrm{m}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ).  

# Site summary Site U1503  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1503 (proposed Site SCSII-9B) is located at $3867.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth near the top of the structural high named Ridge C (Figures F4, F7; Table T1). Ridge C is the most seaward ridge of th e three margin-parallel basement ridges that characterize the lowe r continental slope underlain by thin $(5{-}7\;\mathrm{km})$ crust and possibly th e oldest oceanic crust. Ridge C is believed to represent at least partial, if not full, igneous crust and therefore to have formed after the completion of continental breakup along this margin segment of th e northern SCS.  

A key operational objective of Site U1503 was to sample the lowermost ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediments on top of basement to constrain th e age and subsidence history of the crust at this location, the timing o f normal faulting, and the environment of the early sediment infill. The other critical goal was to sample the igneous stratigraphy to a t least $100\;\mathrm{m}$ below the acoustic basement. Deep representative sampling of the basaltic material at this site will provide an importan t reference frame for the modeling of breakup. With an estimate d sediment thickness of $1640~\mathrm{m}$ overlying basement, obtaining basement samples and log data at this site represented a challengin g operation.  

# Operations  

Operations were conducted in one hole at Site U1503 (Tabl e T1). In Hole U1503A, the reentry system and $10\%$ inch casing (t o $991.5~\mathrm{m})$ installed during Expedition 368 were used to reenter th e existing hole. The RCB system cored from 995.1 to $1597.84\,\mathrm{~m~}$ $\left(602.74\:\mathrm{m}\right)$ penetration; $128.01\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered; $21\%$ ) and then continuously cored $112.26\,\mathrm{~m~}$ into the underlying basalt from 1597.84 t o $1710.1\,\mathrm{m}$ $\mathrm{47.91\,m}$ recovered; $43\%$ ). Logging with the VSI tool strin g was conducted within the casing only.  

# Lithostratigraphy, igneous and metamorphic petrology, and structural geology  

Site U1503 is divided into four lithostratigraphic units (Figur e F8); three units are composed of sediments and one unit consists o f igneous basement. The uppermost $995.1~\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediments wer e drilled without coring during Expedition 368. Lithostratigraphi c Unit I (995.10–1484.74 m) is a $489.6~\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of well consolidated to lithified brownish gray, moderately bioturbated claystone with greenish gray sandstone and siltstone interbeds (Figur e F9). Some of the coarser intervals have high carbonate content an d multiple sedimentary structures (mud clasts, a fining-upwar d sequence, and parallel and convolute laminations) that are potentially related to deep-sea turbiditic flows. The relatively low recovery $(21\%)$ of Unit I is attributed to the presence of thick sandston e layers that are inferred from the high-amplitude reflectivity of seismic section. Unit II (1484.74–1542.77 m) is divided into Subunit s IIA $(1484.74{-}1533.60\mathrm{~m})$ ) and IIB $^{1533.60-1542.77\ m)}$ ) based o n carbonate and nannofossil contents. Subunit IIA has a recovery o f $36\%$ and consists of lithified dark reddish brown massive claystone s with greenish gray intervals containing heavier bioturbation. Subunit IIB has extremely low recovery $(3\%)$ and consists of lithifie d reddish brown clay-rich chalk. The separation of Subunits IIA an d IIB is also based on geochemical data. Subunit IIA has low carbonate content and high Sr, Fe, Ni, $Z\mathbf{n},$ and Al concentrations, wherea s Subunit IIB is carbonate rich and low in Sr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Al. Uni t III $1542.77{-}1597.84~\mathrm{~m})$ contains  heavily  bioturbated  lithifie d greenish gray nannofossil-rich claystone, greenish gray claystone, light greenish gray siltstone, and dark gray banded claystone. Recovery in Unit III is extremely low $(5\%)$ . A $4~\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick greenish blac k interval in Unit III is likely composed of highly altered volcanoclastic material.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit IV (1597.84–1710.10 m) is an igneou s unit that samples the uppermost part of the SCS basement. Th e boundary between the sediment of Unit III and the underlying basalt of Unit IV is at $1597.84\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , but it is unfortunately disturbed b y drilling and corresponds to the separation between claystone an d basalt rubble at the bottom of the core. Unit IV continues throug h $112.26\;\mathrm{m}$ of basement, of which $47.91\mathrm{~m~}$ was recovered. Unit IV i s composed primarily of sparsely plagioclase to plagioclase phyric basalt with no vesicles to high vesicle content (Figure F10). Basalt s have  mostly  an  ophitic  to  subophitic  texture  with  euhedra l phenocrysts of plagioclase. This basalt unit contains chilled margin s with preserved fresh glass and occasional hyaloclastites with brecciated glass fragments imbricated with clayey sediments or recrystallized  carbonate.  Veins  occur  throughout  Unit  IV  and  ar e predominantly filled with carbonates, Fe oxides, chlorites, and zeolites. Alteration of these basalts remains generally low, as evidence d by the minimal alteration of interstitial glass and the good preservation of plagioclase. The textures, contacts, and structures of Unit I V suggest an emplacement as pillow or lobate lava flows in subaqueous environment.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Between Sections 368X-U1503A-2R-1 and 368X-U1503A-48RCC, a $5\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ whole-round sample from the core catcher was collecte d on the catwalk by JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO ) IODP technical staff. The sample was vacuum sealed and stored fo r shipment to the Gulf Coast Repository (GCR) in College Station, TX, at the end of the expedition. Exceptions to this sampling strategy occurred in particularly low-recovery cores. Deeper tha n $1441.7\:\mathrm{m}$ in lithified sediments and basement, no samples wer e collected for biostratigraphy.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The intensity of the natural remanent magnetization in sediments at Site U1503 is higher in the reddish claystone $\left(10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}\right)$ o f Unit II than in the brownish, greenish, and gray sediments of bot h lithostratigraphic Units I $\left(10^{-3}\,\mathrm{\A/m}\right)$ and III $\left(10^{-4}\,\mathrm{\A/m}\right)$ ; in th e basalts (Unit IV), average initial intensity is at least two to fou r orders of magnitude higher than in sediments $(1\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m})$ .  

Both sediments and basalts can show two components of magnetization: a component isolated at lower fields that, at least in sediments, shows steep positive inclination and can be correlated t o drilling overprinting and a characteristic component of magnetization (ChRM) that shows both reversed and normal polarities an d can be isolated in different field ranges depending on the coercivit y of the magnetic carries. In sediments, the presence of both norma l and reverse polarities and a mean ChRM inclination of $26.4^{\circ}\pm8.0^{\circ}$ (close to the $25^{\circ}$ inclination expected at the coordinates of Hol e U1503A) support a primary nature of the magnetization. However, the observed inclinations (Figure F11) cannot be correlated with  a reference geomagnetic polarity timescale because of the extremel y low recovery rate.  

The anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility shows strong oblat e shape and horizontal planar fabric in sediments, which is consisten t with deposition in a calm pelagic environment. An inclined plana r fabric is present in lithostratigraphic Units II and III and shows  a foliation inclined by ${\sim}30^{\circ}$ . In basalts, a prolate shape of the ellipsoi d and an intermediate fabric indicate the presence of a flow; however, the flow direction cannot be determined because samples are no t oriented.  

# Geochemistry  

Geochemical analyses were conducted for headspace gas safet y monitoring in all sediment cores and in two basement cores. Methane content is low $(<\!30\mathrm{\ppmv})$ in the sediment sections shallowe r than $1394\mathrm{~m~}$ . Deeper than $1404\mathrm{~m~}$ , methane content in sediment s gradually increases $(\mathrm{average}\,=\,1249\mathrm{~ppmv})$ before reaching a maximum of 5066 ppmv very near the sediment/basement boundary. Quantification of sediment $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ , inorganic and organic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur contents was made for 43 samples (Figure F12). Samples with carbonate content ${>}30\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ , from near the top of th e cored sediments, correspond to sandstones in lithostratigraphi c Unit I. With three exceptions, total organic carbon (TOC)/tota l nitrogen (TN) ratios at Site U1503 range from ${<}1$ to 6.4 (average $=$ 4.3; Figure F12), suggesting that the majority of the organic matte r is likely from a marine source. Source rock analysis (SRA) was performed on three sedimentary samples. Samples collected for $\mathrm{\DeltaX}$ -ra y diffraction (XRD) analysis (Sun et al., 2018) were retained for shorebased analysis of major element oxides and several trace element s using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscop y (ICP-AES).  

# Physical properties  

We  measured  physical  properties  on  whole-round  cores, working-half sections, and discrete samples. These measurement s included gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, natural gamma radiation (NGR), $P$ -wave velocity, moisture and density (MAD) and porosity, and thermal conductivity. The variations in physical property values led us to define physica l properties (PP) Units 1–9, each of which has specific characteristic s (Figure F13). Lithostratigraphic Unit I includes PP Units 1–5. Subunit IIA includes PP Units 6 and 7. Subunit IIB and Unit III correspond to PP Unit 8. Unit IV corresponds to PP Unit 9. In PP Unit I, variations of physical properties are mostly related to the nature o f the sediment; NGR, magnetic susceptibility, and porosity ar e higher, and density, $P$ -wave velocity, and thermal conductivity ar e lower in the claystone and siltstone than in the sandstone. $P$ -wav e velocity of the claystone and siltstone also increases slightly wit h depth because of lithification. In PP Unit 7, magnetic susceptibilit y increases markedly in the red clay of Subunit IIA. The nannofossilrich claystone of Unit III, which corresponds to PP Unit 8, displays  a clear decrease in bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P.$ -wav e velocity with depth. Such variations, which are opposite to those expected from lithification or compaction effects, are possibly due t o the abundance of nannofossils in the sediment. Magnetic susceptibility in the basalts is very high but shows some variations tha t might correspond to changes in the nature of the magnetized minerals or the grain size. Compared to the sedimentary rocks abov e the basement, $P.$ -wave velocity in the basalts is quite high. NGR $_{<10}$ counts/s) and porosity are quite low in the basalts, whereas densit y is much higher than in sediment. The high magnetic susceptibilit y values in Cores 368X-U1503A-87R and 88R correspond to basalt s that display more massive textures than those from the other core s and are likely to have distinct magnetized minerals or grain size.  

# Downhole measurements and seismic correlation  

A VSI tool string was deployed to collect a vertical seismic profile at 18 stations with intervals of $50\,\textrm{m}$ from 974.9 to $124.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ within Hole U1503A. To avoid potentially deteriorated condition s in the open hole, the VSI tool string did not pass into the open hole; all check shots were conducted inside the casing. The VSI too l string was first lowered to near the end of the casing at ${\sim}991\;\mathrm{m}$ . Th e logging string was then pulled up and stopped at 18 stations. Th e VSI tool string was combined with telemetry and gamma ray tools. Following  data  collection,  logging  specialists  at  the  LamontDoherty Earth Observatory provided corrected two-way traveltimes. The combined VSI and $P_{\|}$ -wave measurements were used t o calculate the velocity-depth relationship for Hole U1503A using th e interval velocity from the VSI experiment for the top part and th e average $P$ -wave velocity of sediment cores. Seismic waveforms i n Hole U1503A were then extracted from seismic data and converte d to depth using the composite depth-velocity relationship for th e hole (Figure F14). The boundaries of multiple PP and Lithostratigraphic Units are connected to the prominent reflectors in the seismic image.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

In this section, we assess the achievements of Expedition 368 X in terms of meeting the four specific objectives of Expeditions 36 7 and 368 as stated in the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Based on the reentry system and casing installation complete d during Expedition 368 and the need to address uncompleted operational objectives, Expedition 368X operated exclusively in Hol e U1503A. The drilling strategy for Expedition 368X was to finish th e operational objectives of Expedition 368 in Hole U1503A, includin g coring the lowermost sediments and basement and logging the hole.  

1. To determine the nature of the basement within critical crustal units across the COT of the SCS rifted margin to discriminate between different competing models of breakup at magma- poor rifted margins. Specifically, to determine whether the subcontinental lithospheric mantle was exhumed during plate rupture.  

This objective was partly achieved during Expedition 368X wit h the potential for completion following postcruise research.  

Site U1503 was a priority deep site on distal Ridge C, as stated i n the Scientific Prospectus (Sun et al., 2016b). Expedition 368X penetrated $112.26\mathrm{~m~}$ into the basalt basement of Hole U1503A and recovered $47.91\mathrm{~m~}$ $(43\%)$ . Although the age of crustal material fro m  

Hole U1503A is not yet determined, onboard igneous and metamorphic petrology and structural geology observations were made. The textural and structural features of the basalts suggest an emplacement as pillow or lobate lava flows at seafloor. Basement i n Hole U1503A is composed primarily of sparsely plagioclase to plagioclase phyric basalt. Vesicles are apparent in some intervals, an d most samples are ophitic in texture. The basalts contain hypohyaline to holohyaline chilled margins with preserved fresh glass an d occasional hyaloclastites with glass fragments imbricated wit h clayey sediments. No indication of subcontinental mantle or igneous continental rocks is apparent at Site U1503. Even if the emplacement age of these basalts is not determined yet, we infer tha t they represent the incipient or steady-state formation of an oceani c crust.  

2. To determine the time lag between plate rupture and asthenospheric upwelling that allowed decompression melting to generate igneous ocean crust.  

This objective was partly achieved during Expedition 368X, with the potential for completion following postcruise research.  

The recovery of igneous basement rocks at Site U1503 is idea l for geochemical analyses to determine the rock composition, melting process, age of crystallization, or mantle fertility. The combination of such analyses and further geochemical or thermomechanica l modeling will constrain the mantle origin and melting processe s that lead to the formation of these basalts and potentially reveal i f they were emplaced at a steady-state, mature seafloor-spreadin g ridge. Expeditions 367, 368, and 368X sampled basalts at three site s (U1500, U1502, and U1503) that form a $36~\mathrm{km}$ transect across th e COT. The accurate measurement of the absolute age of basemen t formation at each of these sites will be crucial to determine the velocity of continental breakup processes from the first occurrence o f mid-ocean-ridge basalt (MORB) to the steady-state accretion. Comparison of the composition of these basalts with those sample d at Sites U1431 and U1433 during IODP Expedition 349 will als o constrain the scenario of breakup to steady-state igneous crus t emplacement. These observations and future studies form a uniqu e data set representing a benchmark for a rifted margin with moderate magmatism that can be compared to the Iberia-Newfoundlan d magma-poor margin, where a time lag between crustal rupture an d onset of seafloor spreading of ${>}15$ million years has been determined.  

3. To constrain the rate of extension and vertical crustal movements.  

This objective was partly achieved during Expedition 368X, with the potential for completion following postcruise research.  

The inability to pursue coring at Site U1503 prevented Expedition 368 from extending subsidence studies seaward of Ridge B (Sit e U1500). With the recovered material of Expedition 368X, when th e basalts are dated, we will be able to calibrate magnetic models an d better identify magnetic isochrons and determine the spreadin g rate.  

4. To improve the understanding of the Cenozoic regional tectonic and environmental development of the Southeast Asia margin and SCS by combining Expedition 367 and 368 results with existing ODP/IODP sediment records and regional seismic data.  

This objective was partly achieved during Expedition $368\mathrm{X}$ , with the potential for completion following postcruise research. Contributions include  

• The recovery of sandstone that may contain zircons useful for provenance studies to determine the sediment origin (China, Palawan, Taiwan and associated uplift, and Luzon).   
• The recovery of red clays that have been observed at most regional sites and record an episode of open-sea, deep-marine conditions. When the Luzon arc started to close the SCS in the east, the SCS was no longer connected with the Pacific Ocean and became a marginal oceanic basin with a different oceanic circulation and sedimentation.   
• The observation that the chalk layer of lithostratigraphic Subunit IIB may be regionally correlated.   
• The observation that sediments just above the basement are tilted, which can contribute to the dating of faulting at Ridge C.   
• Information regarding the composition and age of formation of the basalts at Site U1503 that, along with results of the previous IODP expeditions, provides unique information on the regional mantle processes during the formation of the SCS and therefore on the geodynamics of Southeast Asia.  

# Operations  

# Hong Kong port call  

Expedition 368X began at $0800~\mathrm{h}$ (all times are ship local time; $\mathrm{UTC}+8\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 15 November 2018 at the China Merchants Wharf i n Hong Kong. The IODP JRSO technical staff (14 additional), Expedition Project Manager, and seven of nine scientists boarded the vessel on 15 November. The remainder of the science party moved o n board on 16 November. The scientists began expedition preparations that included introductions and an orientation to shipboar d computing resources.  

On the first day of the port call, we loaded hazardous freight, 155 short tons of potable water, and 404 short tons of drill water, al l of which were loaded from a barge on the starboard side of the vessel. On the second day of the port call, 71.9 metric tons of marin e gas oil were pumped on board from a barge on the starboard side. The Schlumberger active heave wireline compensator hydraulic system was repaired by the Schlumberger mechanic with parts tha t were air freighted to the port call. The system was tested in por t after the repairs were completed.  

During the 2 day port call, a reentry funnel extension was prepared to extend the reentry system in Hole U1503A. Additionally, the outer core barrel was prepared and the RCB core barrels wer e spaced out. The coring assembly was laid out on the piperacke r skate track for a quick deployment on arrival at Site U1503. Th e passage plan for the expedition was completed, and arrangement s were made with the agent and immigration for a departure at $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November. All port call–generated trash was offloaded to th e pier, the pier was cleaned, and all equipment was secured for sailing. During the second day of port call, the science party continued expedition preparations that included an orientation to life at sea, general safety introductions and tours, and introductions to the laboratories. The Expedition Project Manager gave a presentatio n about expedition expectations, tasks, and reports. The science part y also received shipboard safety introductions by the Captain, Firs t Mate, and Physician.  

At $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November 2018, immigration personnel arrive d on board and cleared the personnel and vessel for departure. Shortly before $0800~\mathrm{h}$ , the pilot arrived on board. With the assistance from two harbor tugs, Hai Tong and Hai Hoi, the vessel wa s underway, and the last line was released at $0824\,\mathrm{h}$ . The vessel proceeded to the pilot station, and the pilot departed the vessel a t  

$0854\,\mathrm{h}$ . While underway, the science party continued training in th e laboratories, which included introductions to the handheld portabl e X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, curation, and description software. The science party also received a lifeboat safety orientatio n and tours of the bridge and dynamic positioning system. The transi t was completed in $24.6\,\mathrm{h}$ and ended at the expedition’s first and onl y hole, U1503A. The average vessel speed was $11.5~\mathrm{kt}$ over the 28 4 nmi distance. The vessel arrived at Site U1503 at $0900\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 1 8 November, and the thrusters were lowered.  

# Site U1503  

# Hole U1503A  

After arriving at Site U1503, the vessel shifted to dynamic positioning mode at $0953\,\mathrm{h}$ and the drill floor was cleared to begin operations in Hole U1503A. We did not deploy an acoustic positionin g beacon but prepared one for immediate deployment, if required.  

The upper guide horn was removed, and a reentry funnel extension was lowered and secured in the moonpool. A four-stand RC B bottom-hole assembly was assembled and lowered to 2990 meter s below rig floor (mbrf). The subsea camera was deployed and ru n down the drill string while the drill string was deployed to 387 4 mbrf. The search for the reentry system was quickly successful. Th e reentry cone was observed to be slightly below the level of the seafloor and full of debris from the previous drilling in Hole U1503A. The vessel was positioned for reentry, and the bit was lowered int o the reentry cone at $0014~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 November 2018. After several attempts to reenter the casing, the bit passed into the casing at $0039\,\mathrm{h}$ . The subsea camera system was recovered, and a FFF was welded t o the top of the reentry funnel extension. The reentry FFF and extension were deployed down the outside of the drill pipe (Figure F15).  

The upper guide horn was reinstalled, and the bit was lowere d into the $10\%$ inch casing. The drill string was filled every 20 stand s as the string was lowered toward the bottom of the casing. Th e driller tagged hard fill inside the casing at $956\;\mathrm{m}$ . The top drive wa s picked up, and the driller washed down while pumping with slo w rotation to $995.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Total depth was reached at $1600\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 1 9 November. A 30 bbl high-viscosity sweep was circulated, and a nonmagnetic core barrel was deployed to begin RCB coring in Hol e U1503A. Cores 2R through 40R $(995.1{-}1364.9\mathrm{~m})$ ) were cored at  a rate of just over $100\;\mathrm{m/day},$ and recovery was generally poor $(17\%)$ . Recovery began to improve in Cores 41R through 51R (1364.9– $1470.5\:\mathrm{m};38\%$ ), and the penetration rate dropped to ${<}4\,\mathrm{m/h}$ .  

Coring continued until $0400~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 November and reached  a depth of $1528.0\ \mathrm{m}$ with Core 57R. With $50.8~\mathrm{h}$ on the bit, the hol e was circulated clean with a $30\,\mathrm{bbl}$ sweep of high-viscosity mud. Th e bit was raised to $1383~\mathrm{m}$ in the open hole (casing extends to 991. 5 m), and $200~\mathrm{bbl}$ of $10.5~\mathrm{lb/gal}$ heavy mud was displaced into th e borehole. The heavy mud was used to increase the hydrostatic pressure on a very unstable section of hole. The top drive was set back, and the drill pipe was pulled back to just above the casing sho e $(953.0\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ). The upper guide horn was pulled up, and the subse a camera system was deployed.  

While running the subsea camera system to just above the seafloor, a slip and cut of the drilling line was performed. The bit wa s pulled out of the hole at $1247\,\mathrm{h}$ , and it cleared the secondary funne l without issue. The measurement to the top of the cone was confirmed at 3879.7 mbrf. The subsea camera system was pulled bac k to the surface and secured on board. The remainder of the dril l string was recovered, and the bit cleared the rig floor at $2045~\mathrm{h}$ o n 26 November. The outer core barrel was disassembled and inspected, and a new C-4 bit was picked up and installed with  a mechanical bit release (MBR).  

The drill pipe was lowered to 3855 mbrf, and at $0545\,\mathrm{h}$ the subsea camera was deployed. Hole U1503A was reentered at $0830\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 27 November after $30\;\mathrm{min}$ of maneuvering. The subsea camera system was pulled back to the surface, and the trip back to bottom continued until the driller encountered a bridge at $1345.0\ \mathrm{m}$ . The to p drive was picked up, and the driller washed and reamed from 1345. 0 m back to bottom at $1528.0\;\mathrm{m}$ . After reaching total depth, the hol e was circulated clean with high-viscosity mud. A nonmagnetic cor e barrel was dropped, and coring resumed at $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 November.  

Coring with the second bit began with Core 58R and continue d through Core 75R ( $1528.0–1633.0\,\textrm{m}$ ). Basement was reached a t $1597.84\mathrm{~m~}$ . After reaching basement, half cores were used to improve recovery. Basement recovery from 1605.0 to $1633.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wa s $33\%$ . With $42.2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on the bit, the hole was circulated clean with thre e 50 bbl sweeps of high-viscosity mud. The bit was raised to $1355.7\;\mathrm{m}$ in the open hole, and $200\,\mathrm{bbl}$ of $10.5\,\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ heavy mud was displace d into the borehole with the intent of increasing the hydrostatic pressure on the unstable section of the hole. The top drive was set back, and the drill pipe was recovered and cleared the seafloor at $1050~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 December. After recovering the remaining drill pipe, the bi t cleared the rig floor at $1725\,\mathrm{h}$ . The outer core barrel was disassembled, cleaned, and inspected, and a new C-7 bit was picked up an d installed with an MBR. The drill pipe was lowered to the seafloor, and the subsea camera system was deployed. After $60\ \mathrm{min}$ of maneuvering, Hole U1503A was reentered at $0439~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 December, and the subsea camera system was pulled back to the surface.  

The trip back to the bottom of Hole U1503A continued unti l $1375.0\ \mathrm{m}_{}$ , where the driller experienced a hard tag of the bit on  a bridge. The top drive was picked up, and the driller washed an d reamed from 1375.0 to 1517.0 mbsf, where an electrical proble m caused the top drive to stop operating. The problem was resolved, and $1.5~\mathrm{h}$ later we began washing back to total depth. A wash cor e barrel was deployed at $1615\ \mathrm{m},$ and washing and reaming continued. Total depth $\left(1633.0\mathrm{~m}\right)$ was reached, and the hole was circulated clean with $40\;\mathrm{bbl}$ of high-viscosity mud. The wash barrel wa s retrieved by wireline, and a nonmagnetic core barrel was dropped. Coring began again at $2100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 December.  

Basement coring with the third bit began with Core 76R fro m $1633.0\;\mathrm{m}$ and continued through Core 77R to $1657.3\;\mathrm{m}$ before hig h torque and excessive overpull forced the driller to work the dril l string back to $1566.0\;\mathrm{m}$ to regain good circulation and rotation. Th e core barrel, which had been dropped for Core 78R, was retrieved, and the driller washed and reamed back to bottom $(1657.3\;\mathrm{m})$ . A 4 0 bbl mud sweep was pumped down the drill string and circulated ou t to the seafloor. A core barrel was dropped, and half-coring began a t $1657.3\;\mathrm{m}$ and continued through Core 88R to a final total depth o f $1710.1\mathrm{~m~}$ . All cores after Core 85R were full cores. High-viscosit y mud sweeps were pumped frequently to help improve the hol e conditions. The last core on deck was recorded at $0625\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on  5 December.  

The hole was circulated clean, and we began pulling back wit h the top drive installed. High torque and overpull were observe d while pulling back and reaming to ${\sim}1600\mathrm{~m~}$ . Backreaming continued to $1383~\mathrm{m}$ while we continued to experience high torque an d overpull. The hole was displaced with 200 bbl of high-viscosit y mud, and the bit was pulled back to $1355\;\mathrm{m}$ . The top drive was se t back, and the drill pipe was pulled back to the casing shoe and occasionally experienced overpull as the hole collapsed around the dril l string. After reaching the casing shoe at $991.5\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the remainder o f the pipe trip to the seafloor was normal. The bit cleared the seafloo r at $1450\,\mathrm{h}$ and was pulled $12.7\;\mathrm{m}$ above the reentry cone. The subse a camera system was installed, and while running the camera syste m to bottom, the drilling line was slipped and 115 ft of line was cut off. The top drive was picked up, and the sinker bars were inserte d through the blocks. The rotary shifting tool was run to the bit an d engaged to shift the retaining sleeve, which activated the MBR. Th e subsea video camera recorded the bit release at $1920\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 December. The wireline was pulled back to the surface, and the top driv e was racked.  

Hole U1503A was reentered for the fourth time at $2155~\mathrm{h}$ on  5 December. The end of the pipe was set at $71.0\;\mathrm{m}$ in preparation fo r logging. After reentry, the subsea camera system was recovered t o the surface at 0000 on 6 December. A short delay was required t o time the VSI experiment for daylight hours. Logging activities began at $0400~\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December. The rig floor had been prepared fo r logging during the down period needed for seismic work to be don e in daylight hours. The tools were rigged up, tested, and lowered int o the pipe at $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Because the cable on the winch was new, it was necessary t o conduct standard cable seasoning/detorquing by pausing every 50 0 m while the tools were lowered into the pipe and pulling up a shor t distance before continuing running in the hole. Upon reaching 385 0 mbrf, a downlog was started for a rough depth reference. No othe r logs exist to tie into, so there was marginal uncertainty about th e exact depth at which a gamma ray signal might begin to register, given that the original casing/cone sunk into the sediment ${\sim}5.1\mathrm{~m~}$ and the cuttings stacked up to almost the top of the secondary cone. Lacking any better reference and prior to shooting any seismic stations, the log depth was adjusted in such a way that the top gamm a ray reading occurred at the driller’s seafloor depth of 3879 mbrf. The only logging run for this expedition was with the VSI tool strin g in the cased section of Hole U1503A. Open-hole conditions wer e highly adverse, so no logs were conducted in the open-hole portio n of this site. The work of taking seismic measurements through th e casing began, as always, with a toolbox talk/safety meeting on th e drill floor with the rig crew on duty. It was also noted that highpressure air would be in use near the fantail for the air guns and tha t the fantail should therefore be avoided during seismic shooting.  

Just prior to logging, the average heave was estimated at $0.3~\mathrm{m}$ . The active heave compensator was turned on when the VSI too l string reached 3965 mbrf and was utilized during each VSI station. The protective species watch began at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ . After an hour of observation, the soft start began. The seismic air gun cluster $\phantom{-}2\times250$ inch3 G-guns in a horizontal array) was turned over to the Schlumberger wireline engineer at $0820\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the seismic survey began.  

The single tool string consisted of the following tools:  

• VSI, • Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC), and • Logging equipment head-Q tension (LEH-QT).  

The initial shots were taken at $975\ \mathrm{m},$ and additional station s were shot every $50\;\mathrm{m}$ thereafter to $125\;\mathrm{m}$ . No further stations coul d be recorded because the pipe was set inside casing at $70\textrm{m}$ . All 1 8 viable stations were successfully shot and recorded. Moderate nois e was present in some areas, and most of the shots required manua l transit time picking. However, overall the data quality was quite reasonable and fit for interpretation.  

A continuous gamma ray log was recorded from the bottom o f the casing upward past the seafloor. This log is the only depth reference for the expedition, and it was planned and recorded in rea l time so that the uppermost gamma ray activity corresponds wit h the driller’s seafloor, thus tying the station measurements to th e coring data as closely as possible under the circumstances. Once th e gamma ray log was completed at ${\sim}3860\,\mathrm{m}$ at $1055\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December, the tools were pulled out of the hole and reached the surface at 133 0 h. The tools were rigged down by $1400\;\mathrm{h},$ , thus concluding the logging run.  

The drill string was pulled out of the hole to the surface, and i t cleared the seafloor at $1450\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 December. By $2345\,\mathrm{h},$ , all rig floo r equipment was secured, ending operations in Hole U1503A and a t Site U1503. The thrusters and hydrophones were raised, and th e vessel began the transit to Hong Kong at $0030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 December.  A total of $444.25\,\mathrm{h}$ (18.5 days) were recorded during Expedition 368 X while in Hole U1503A. One downtime incident occurred; an electrical malfunction caused the top drive to shut down for $1.5~\mathrm{h}$ whil e the problem was repaired. After the $284\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Hong Kon g averaging $9.4~\mathrm{kt}$ , the vessel arrived at the pilot station. The pilo t arrived on board at $0654\,\mathrm{h},$ and the first line ashore was at $0754\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 8 December, thus ending Expedition 368X.

Figure F2. Two-way traveltime to (A) acoustic basement (Tg reflector) and (B) Unconformity T60 with Expedition 367, 368, and 368X sites. Proposed drillin g transect (thick black line) was located approximately at the center of a margin segment bounded to the southwest by a transform fault. Northeastern boundary of the margin segment is located around IODP Expedition 349 Site U1435. In this location, the outer margin high (OMH) and Ridge A seem to coalesce, an d Ridges B and C of the continent–ocean transition become indistinct toward the northeast in the next margin segment. Note that the OMH is slightly oblique t o the more parallel Ridges A, B, and C.

Figure F5. Deep crustal time-migrated seismic reflection data without and with interpretation. Note the rather thin lower crust (two layers) above a stron g Mohorovičić seismic discontinuity (Moho) reflector that can be followed oceanward. Moho reflection is weak to absent seaward from around the interprete d continent–ocean boundary (COT). Wide-angle seismic data (Yan et al., 2001) confirm ${\sim}6\;\mathsf{k m}$ thick ocean crust (OC) seaward of the COT. A large detachmen t fault $\sim\!150\;\mathsf{k m}$ inland of the COT separates more stable crust landward from that of highly extended crust seaward. An outer margin high (OMH) is a fairl y consistent feature along this margin segment. Key seismic unconformities are shown in purple $(\mathsf{T}70;{\sim}32$ Ma breakup unconformity?) and blue (T60; $^{\sim23}$ M a regional basin event). These ages are inferred from long distance $(>\uparrow00\ \mathsf{k m})$ correlation of seismic unconformities with industry holes and ODP Leg 184 Sit e 1148 (T60). They need confirmation by coring and are only tentative. Tg reflector (green) $=$ basement. Arrows $=$ approximate position of seafloor magneti c anomalies with chron numbers.
