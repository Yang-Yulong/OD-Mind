# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 37 2 combined two research topics, slow slip events (SSEs) on subduction faults (IODP Proposal 781A-Full) and actively deformin g gas hydrate–bearing landslides (IODP Proposal 841-APL). Ou r study area on the Hikurangi margin, east of the coast of New Zealand, provided unique locations for addressing both research topics.  

SSEs at subduction zones are an enigmatic form of creepin g fault behavior. They typically occur on subduction zones at depth s beyond the capabilities of ocean floor drilling. However, at th e northern Hikurangi subduction margin they are among the bestdocumented and shallowest on Earth. Here, SSEs may extend clos e to the trench, where clastic and pelagic sediments about $1.0{-}1.5\,\mathrm{km}$ thick overlie the subducting, seamount-studded Hikurangi Plateau. Geodetic data show that these SSEs recur about every 2 years an d are associated with measurable seafloor displacement. The northern Hikurangi subduction margin thus provides an excellent settin g to use IODP capabilities to discern the mechanisms behind slow sli p fault behavior.  

Expedition 372 acquired logging-while-drilling (LWD) data a t three subduction-focused sites to depths of 600, 650, and $750~\mathrm{me}-$ ters below seafloor (mbsf), respectively. These include two site s (U1518 and U1519) above the plate interface fault that experience s SSEs and one site (U1520) in the subducting “inputs” sequence i n the Hikurangi Trough, $15\,\mathrm{km}$ east of the plate boundary. Overall, w e acquired excellent logging data and reached our target depths at tw o of these sites. Drilling and logging at Site U1520 did not reach th e planned depth due to operational time constraints. These loggin g data will be augmented by coring and borehole observatorie s planned for IODP Expedition 375.  

Gas hydrates have long been suspected of being involved in seafloor failure; not much evidence, however, has been found to dat e for gas hydrate–related submarine landslides. Solid, ice-like gas hydrate in sediment pores is generally thought to increase seafloo r strength, as confirmed by a number of laboratory measurements. Dissociation of gas hydrate to water and overpressured gas, on th e other hand, may weaken and destabilize sediments, potentiall y causing submarine landslides.  

The Tuaheni Landslide Complex (TLC) on the Hikurangi margin shows evidence for active, creeping deformation. Intriguingly, the landward edge of creeping coincides with the pinch-out of th e base of gas hydrate stability on the seafloor. We therefore hypothesized that gas hydrate may be linked to creep-like deformation an d presented several hypotheses that may link gas hydrates to slow deformation. Alternatively, creeping may not be related to gas hydrates but instead be caused by repeated pressure pulses or linke d to earthquake-related liquefaction.  

Expedition 372 comprised a coring and LWD program to tes t our landslide hypotheses. Due to weather-related downtime, the ga s hydrate-related program was reduced, and we focused on a set o f experiments at Site U1517 in the creeping part of the TLC. We conducted a successful LWD and coring program to 205 mbsf, the latte r with almost complete recovery, through the TLC and gas hydrat e stability zone, followed by temperature and pressure tool deployments.  

# Introduction  

Slow slip events  

Slow slip events (SSEs) involve transient aseismic slip across  a fault (lasting weeks to months) at a rate intermediate between th e plate boundary displacement rate and the slip velocity required t o generate seismic waves. Only since the advent of dense, plat e boundary–scale geodetic networks in the last decade has the importance of these events as a significant mode of fault slip been recognized.  The  observation  of  SSEs  and  associated  seismi c phenomena at subduction megathrusts worldwide (see review i n Schwartz and Rokosky, 2007) has ignited one of the most dynami c fields of research in seismology today (e.g., Rubinstein et al., 2010; Peng and Gomberg, 2010; Wech and Creager, 2011). Although SSE s appear to bridge the gap between typical earthquake behavior an d steady, aseismic slip on faults, the physical mechanisms that lead t o SSEs and their relationship to destructive, seismic slip on subduction thrusts are poorly known. This deficiency in our understanding of SSEs is partly due to the fact that most well-studie d subduction zone SSEs (Cascadia, southwest Japan) occur at to o great a depth for high-resolution imaging or direct sampling of th e source region. A notable exception is the northern Hikurangi subduction margin (HSM), New Zealand (Figure F1), where well-characterized SSEs occur every 2 years over a period of 2–3 weeks a t depths ${<}5{-}15\ \mathrm{km}$ below the seafloor (Wallace and Beavan, 2010; Wallace et al., 2016). The close proximity of SSEs to the seafloor a t northern Hikurangi makes it feasible to drill into, sample, collec t logs, and conduct monitoring within and around the source area i n the near-field. Their regularity and well-characterized short repea t interval allow monitoring over multiple SSE cycles, with the potential to document the spatial and temporal distribution of strain accumulation and release, as well as any associated hydrogeologi c phenomena.  

The objectives of the International Ocean Discovery Progra m (IODP) Expedition 372 program include the collection of loggingwhile-drilling (LWD) data at three sites across the northern HSM. The LWD tools employed provided data on lithology, sonic properties, porosity, tectonic and formation hydrogeology, fault and wall rock microstructure, and stress conditions. Integration of the LW D data with seismic reflection data and with core data from IODP Expedition 375 will enable us to characterize the compositional, structural, thermal, hydrogeological, chemical, and diagenetic states, a s well as the stress regime of the sedimentary and upper volcanic “inputs” section of the incoming plate, the shallow plate boundary faul t near the trench, and the upper plate above the SSE source region. The data from the subduction inputs and frontal thrust sites will constrain the protolith and conditions in the updip part of the subduction fault zone associated with SSEs at greater depth.  

The integrated log-core-seismic data will be used to identif y borehole depth targets at the upper plate and frontal thrust sites fo r the installation of CORK observatories during Expedition 375 i n 2018 (for further details, see Saffer et al., 2017). These observatorie s will span across the entire SSE source region and be used to monito r deformation, temperature, and fluid flow related to SSE cycles.  

# Gas hydrates and submarine landslides  

Submarine landslides constitute a significant geohazard an d modify seafloor morphology (Mulder and Cochonat, 1996). Although progress has been made in studying their causes (Solheim e t al., 2005), the processes that control the evolution of submarin e slides are still only partially understood.  

It is generally thought that submarine slides occur as single catastrophic events leading to mobilization and downslope transpor t of source material (Mulder and Cochonat, 1996). The submarin e Tuaheni Landslide Complex (TLC) east of New Zealand’s North Island, however, exhibits features typical of active, slow-moving terrestrial earthflows that appear to be creeping rather than failing i n single events (Mountjoy et al., 2009). Such creeping behavior is observed on shore in mudslides (or earthflows) in weak clay-bearin g rock (Baum et al., 2003) and in rock glaciers in ice-bounded sediments (Martin and Whalley, 1987). Intriguingly, at the TLC th e creeping appears to be linked to the feather edge of gas hydrate stability (FEGHS) where the base of gas hydrate stability (BGHS ) pinches out at the seafloor (Mountjoy et al., 2014b). Based on th e curvature of bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) in the study are a and BSR pinch-outs in the vicinity of the slides (Chiswell, 2005; Pecher et al., 2005, 2008), the FEGHS is predicted to be between 58 5 and $640\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth, which coincides with the upper limit o f creeping interpreted from structural and geomorphic data.  

At the FEGHS, gas hydrates, seafloor failure, and ocean chang e are critically intertwined (Phrampus and Hornbach, 2012). Becaus e gas hydrate is known to strengthen sediments in short-term deformation tests, seafloor destabilization has been linked to hydrate dissociation, although there is no solid evidence for this process. W e now suggest that the presence of gas hydrate itself may be implicated in creeping during long-term seafloor deformation.  

# Background  

# Tectonic setting  

At the northern Hikurangi margin, the Pacific plate subduct s beneath eastern North Island, New Zealand, at a rate of 4.5–5. 5 $\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Wallace et al., 2004; Figure F1). The oceanic subducting plat e comprises the Hikurangi Plateau, a rough-crust, seamount-studde d large igneous province of Cretaceous age $(120\mathrm{-}90\mathrm{\;Ma)}$ ). The platea u is overlain by a Cenozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary sequence tha t thickens from ${\sim}1{-}1.5\,\mathrm{km}$ at northern Hikurangi (Figures F2, F3) t o $>\!5\,\mathrm{km}$ thick at southern Hikurangi, south of ${\sim}40^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . Thus, the northern Hikurangi margin is relatively sediment starved. This part of th e margin is characterized by a mixed mode of spatially varying tectonic accretion and frontal tectonic erosion associated with subducting seamounts (Lewis et al., 1998; Collot et al., 2001; Pedley e t al., 2010). The past subduction of seamounts may have an effect o n fluid pressures at the plate interface (Bell et al., 2010; Ellis et al., 2015). A number of seamounts are present on the Pacific plate approaching the deformation front (e.g., Tūranganui Knoll [formerl y Gisborne Knolls] and Puke Seamount). Where accretion occurs a t northern Hikurangi, the margin is characterized by a narrow, stee p $\mathrm{>}10^{\circ}$ taper angle) wedge geometry (Figure F3; Barker et al. 2009). The Hikurangi subduction thrust is identified as a décollement between an undeformed subducting sequence and a thrust-imbricate d wedge. Barker et al. (2009) show that the interface lies $<5{-}6\;\mathrm{km}$ below the seafloor $15\mathrm{-}40~\mathrm{km}$ from the trench. At the deformatio n front, the plate interface thrust is developed at about $5\,\mathrm{km}$ below se a level and about $2\;\mathrm{km}$ below the seabed, at least locally in the uppe r part of the Hikurangi Basement Sequence, which is thought to comprise volcaniclastics and/or chert/limestone rocks (Davy et al., 2008). The décollement position at northern Hikurangi is stratigraphically deeper than at the southern Hikurangi margin, where i t is believed to occur in the inferred pelagic sequence above Paleogene carbonates (Barnes et al., 2010; Ghisetti et al., 2016).  

# Slow slip events on the Hikurangi subduction margin  

SSEs at the northern Hikurangi margin occur offshore of Gisborne township every 18–24 months and typically involve $1{-}2\ \mathrm{cm}$ of southeast surface displacement at continuously operating GP S (cGPS) sites (Figure F4) (Wallace and Beavan, 2010). The portion o f the subduction interface that undergoes slow slip is completel y “locked” between the SSEs, and this locking or “slip deficit” is essentially fully recovered by slip in repeating SSEs (Wallace and Beavan, 2010). Inversion of cGPS displacements from these SSEs indicat e that the equivalent moment magnitudes are typically Mw 6.5–7.0, with average slip of ${\sim}7{-}15~\mathrm{cm}$ on the plate interface. These large r SSEs are punctuated by more frequent, smaller events (one or mor e per year) that are not as well characterized (cGPS time series inse t in Figure F4). SSE slip near Gisborne predominantly occurs beneat h the offshore region, with the downdip limit of slip near the coastlin e and repeated SSE rupture of the same areas of the interface (Wallac e and Beavan, 2010). A recent seafloor geodetic experiment ha s shown that slow slip occurs to within at least $2~\mathrm{km}$ of the seafloo r beneath the Expedition 372 drilling transect, and it is possible tha t slow slip continues all the way to the trench (Wallace et al., 2016).  

Multichannel seismic (MCS) data reveal regions where the interface (between ${<}5$ and $>\!8\;\mathrm{km}$ depth) follows the top of a $1{-}2~\mathrm{km}$ thick high-amplitude reflectivity zone (HRZ) in the subductin g plate (Figure F3) (Bell et al., 2010). The January–February 2010 SS E coincided with the HRZ, whereas the subsequent March–April 2010 SSE source region lies within an intervening lower amplitud e reflection zone. The high-amplitude reflectivity may be the result o f high fluid concentrations within sediments entrained betwee n downgoing seamounts. Alternatively, the reflections may resul t from altered oceanic basaltic lavas and volcaniclastics of the subducted Hikurangi Plateau. If the former interpretation is correct, then the correlation between the HRZ and SSEs suggests that fluid s exert an important control on the generation of slow slip (Bell et al., 2010) by reducing effective stress (e.g., Kodaira et al., $2004;$ Liu an d Rice, 2007; Audet et al., 2009; Song et al., 2009).  

# Geologic setting of the Tuaheni Landslide Complex  

The TLC is situated on the upper slope of the Hikurangi margi n (Figures F2, F5). The outer shelf and upper slope are underlain b y Quaternary shelf edge clinoform sequences (Pedley et al., 2010). These clinoforms consist of wedge-shaped sedimentary package s characteristic of sea level cycle–controlled progradational deposit s (e.g., Posamentier and Vail, 1988; Van Wagoner et al., 1988). Th e clinoform sequences are fine grained at the surface (Alexander e t al., 2010) but are likely to contain a significant sand fraction at dept h like similar sequences in the vicinity (Barnes et al., 1991). Miocen e and older rocks have been documented beneath the Quaternar y sections; these sequences have been exposed at places followin g erosion and/or tectonic uplift (Field et al., 1997; Barnes et al., 2002; Mountjoy and Barnes 2011).  

Dissociation of gas hydrates has long been proposed to be involved in seafloor failure, mainly because of (1) “melting” of a potentially frame-supporting or cementing solid to water and (2) ne t volume expansion leading to elevated pore pressure due to the generation of free gas (Kvenvolden, 1993; Mienert et al., 1998). Conversely, it has been implied that gas hydrate itself would strengthe n sediments, as observed in a number of laboratory experiments (e.g., Winters et al., 2004; Priest et al., 2005). Most studies into the role o f gas hydrates in seafloor instability have thus focused on the BGHS. A few recent findings, however, indicate that gas hydrates may directly or indirectly contribute to seafloor weakening. Rock Garden, a ridge on the Hikurangi margin with a flat top flanked by BSRs, appears to be eroded at the predicted top of gas hydrate stability in th e ocean (Pecher et al., 2005). It has been proposed that gas hydrat e indirectly causes seafloor weakening because a reduction of permeability due to the presence of gas hydrate may lead to the buildup o f overpressure and hydrofracturing of the seafloor (Crutchley et al., 2010; Ellis et al., 2010). Furthermore, although earlier laborator y tests suggest that gas hydrate itself, unlike ice, does not exhibit an y viscous behavior (Durham et al., 2003), laboratory measurement s on sands from the Nankai Trough indicate that gas hydrates may facilitate long-term deformation (Miyazaki et al., 2011). At the TLC, we see evidence that gas buildup and fracturing or viscous processe s may occur in nature.  

The TLC is thought to have initially formed as a catastrophi c submarine slide (the parent slide) followed by ongoing slow deformation of the slide mass. The flanking by elongated strike-slip fault s is evidence for slow deformation. The lower edge of the slide mass i s unconfined. Morphology of faults in seismic data show compressional features in the upper part of the slide mass, whereas the lowe r part shows extensional features. These observations point toward  a conveyor-belt model for sediment movement through the slides, where sediments are being supplied into the upper slide mass, leading to compression, and are being removed at the toe of the TLC, similar to mudslides and rock glaciers on land (Mountjoy et al., 2009).  

It was originally suggested that slow deformation in the TLC reflects repeated small-scale seafloor failure associated with localize d charging and discharging of pore pressure (Mountjoy et al., 2009 ) without involvement of gas hydrates. This process would lead t o successions of small-scale compressional and extensional features.  

We have, however, observed a general switch from compressional to extensional regimes at about $600\,\mathrm{m}$ water depth with compression above it and extension, indicating creeping, beneath i t (Figure F6). This water depth coincides with the predicted FEGHS. We therefore hypothesize that gas hydrates may cause creeping i n the TLC (Mountjoy et al., 2014b). The three proposed mechanism s behind creeping include sliding at the BGHS following gas hydrat e dissociation, repeated “breaching” of a permeability boundary at th e BGHS leading to transmission of pressure pulses beneath the creeping part of the slides (“hydrate pressure valve”), and viscous behavior of gas hydrate–bearing sediments (“hydrate glacier”) (Mountjo y et al., 2014b) (Figure F7).  

# Seismic studies/site survey data  

The key MCS data set available in support of the TLC drillin g program was a P‐Cable 3-D seismic reflection survey collecte d during Survey TAN1404 (Mountjoy et al., 2014a). Interpretation o f these data, which were collected after publishing the hypotheses fo r active deformation, confirmed that the transition from a compressional to extensional (creeping) regime generally coincides with th e predicted FEGHS. A possible décollement for creeping was identified 0.043 s two-way traveltime (TWT) beneath the seafloor (3 7 meters below seafloor [mbsf] assuming an average velocity of 170 0 $\mathrm{m/s}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ; Mountjoy et al., 2016) (Figure F8).  

These data were augmented by deep penetration high-fold seismic sections (Survey 05CM; up to $12\,\mathrm{km}$ streamer), low-fold (up t o 48 channel) data collected by New Zealand research institute s during two surveys in 2011 (TAN1114) (Barnes and TAN 1114 Scientific Party, 2011) and 2012 (TAN1213), and low-fold high-resolution 2-D multichannel data acquired using the P‐Cable seismi c streamers collected during Survey TAN1404 (Mountjoy et al., 2014a). A long-offset seismic profile, which should provide improved velocity information across Site U1517 (proposed Site TLC04B), was collected by the R/V Marcus Langseth (Cruise MGL 1708 ) as part of the SHIRE project shortly before Expedition 372.  

# Previous drilling of the Tuaheni Landslide Complex  

Two sites were drilled in April–May 2016 in the TLC to ${\sim}80$ mbsf during the R/V Sonne Voyage SO-247 using the MeeresbodenBohrgerät 200 (MeBo) robotic drilling system (Site GeoB20803 nea r proposed Site TLC‐01D and Site GeoB20831 at Site U1517) (Huhn, 2016).  

Site U1517 (Figure F8) was drilled to 80 mbsf with the MeBo i n 2016 (Site GeoB20831) (Huhn, 2016), encountering deforme d clayey silt in the upper $28\textrm{m}$ and stiff clayey silt beneath 60 mbs f with good recovery. Between 28 and 60 mbsf, however, recover y with MeBo drilling was poor, yielding disturbed very fine sand y coarse silt. A second MeBo site was drilled ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ from our proposed alternate Site TLC-01D (Site GeoB20803), yielding simila r lithologies with poor recovery in the upper part of the hole. MeB o drilling was not successful at recovering material across the interpreted décollement at ${\sim}40$ mbsf in the seismic data. However, lithologies in the upper and lower parts of the MeBo cores wer e different, suggestive of a lithologic change across this interprete d décollement. Poor core recovery precluded pore water analysis fo r chlorinity as a gas hydrate proxy. MeBo drilling allowed borehol e data to be tied to seismic reflections, particularly confirming th e presence of intact sequences below landslide debris.  

# Objectives  

# Hikurangi subduction margin: hypotheses and scientific objectives  

Drilling, downhole logging, coring, and instrumenting key site s will resolve competing hypotheses and key questions regarding th e generation of SSEs and the mechanics of subduction interfac e thrusts. The major hypotheses that will be tested during Expeditions 372 and 375 are as follows:  

• SSEs propagate to the trench. They are not confined to a specific (narrow) pressure or temperature range.   
• Pore fluid pressure is elevated in the source region of SSEs. The elevated pore pressures are driven by mineral dehydration reactions that occur as sediments, and altered igneous crust on the incoming plate is buried by subduction or by disequilibrium compaction of low-permeability subducting sediments.   
• SSEs occur in regions of conditional frictional stability. A single SSE fault patch can fail by multiple slip behaviors (e.g., steady creep, episodic slow slip, and seismic slip).   
• There is a continuum of duration and magnitude characteristics of SSEs and slow seismic behavior on the shallow, updip section of the subduction zone.   
• SSEs drive fluid flow along faults and throughout the upper plate.  

To test these hypotheses, Expeditions 372 and 375 collectivel y will undertake the following coordinated strategy to accomplish th e primary scientific objectives:  

• Document the in situ conditions, material properties, and composition of the subduction inputs and the shallow plate boundary near the trench. These rocks comprise the protolith and reveal the initial conditions of fault rocks within the slow slip zone at greater depth. In the case of the shallow fault zone, these materials may in fact host SSEs if they propagate to the trench (Figure F4) (e.g., Wallace et al., 2016).  

• Characterize the stress regime, temperatures, rock physical properties, lithologies, fluid pressures, fluid geochemistry, flow pathways, and structure of the upper plate above the SSE source. • Install an array of borehole observatories across the upper plate that spans from the trench across the SSE source region to monitor hydrogeology, temperature, and pressure changes related to SSEs.  

1. HSM Objective 1: characterize the compositional, thermal, hydrogeological, frictional, geochemical, structural, and diagenetic conditions associated with the SSE source area.  

To achieve this goal, characterization of the incoming stratigraphy and upper oceanic basement rocks, together with the shallow most active strand of the frontal thrust system, is essential.  A combination of LWD at Sites U1520 (proposed Site HSM-05A) an d U1518 (proposed Site HSM-15A), located in the Hikurangi Troug h and at a splay thrust fault, respectively, during Expedition 372 an d coring during Expedition 375 will be used (Figures F9, F10). Thes e activities will be followed by a strategy of carefully coordinated sampling and postexpedition laboratory analyses (e.g., Screaton et al., 2009; Underwood et al., 2010). Site U1520 will target the entire sediment package on top of the Hikurangi Plateau. If conditions allo w at Site U1520, drilling will penetrate into the top of the basaltic lav a and/or volcaniclastic sequence. Site U1518 will provide LWD dat a and material from a frontal thrust in the updip region of the plat e interface at low temperature and low effective stress. LWD durin g Expedition 372 will document continuous downhole trends in sediment properties and structure and will characterize stress conditions through analysis of wellbore failures (e.g., Chang et al., 2010). After LWD, coring during Expedition 375 will provide samples an d data sets for sediment and rock physical properties, mineral composition, pore fluid composition, and downhole temperature, with  a focus on hydrogeology and fault mechanical processes. In additio n to Site U1520 in the Hikurangi Trough, Expedition 375 will also dril l and core a second inputs site (proposed Site HSM-08A; see Saffer e t al. [2017]) to target the upper $\left(<\!200\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ altered basaltic basement o f the Tūranganui Knoll Seamount massif (Figure F10). The LWD an d core data from all inputs sites are also critical for refined depth conversion of the existing 2-D seismic data and 3-D seismic data collected by the Marcus Langseth shortly after Expedition 372. Thes e data will also extend knowledge of in situ conditions (stress, faul t zone properties, and pore pressure) away from the boreholes over  a much broader region (Bangs and Gulick, 2005; Tobin and Saffer, 2009). Overall, this objective will constrain (1) the composition an d frictional properties of subduction inputs updip of the shallow plat e interface, (2) the hydrologic and thermal conditions of the incomin g plate and shallow fault, and (3) the structural character, stress conditions, and mechanical properties of the main active thrust an d subduction inputs.  

# 2. HSM Objective 2: characterize the properties and conditions in the upper plate overlying the SSE source region.  

The LWD data acquired during Expedition 372 will provide ke y information about fracture and faulting patterns and will allow us t o evaluate the relationship between fractured intervals and any geochemical or thermal evidence of fluid flow in the upper plate abov e the SSE source region (e.g., Kopf et al., 2003). These data will als o document borehole breakouts and/or drilling-induced tensile fractures, if present, to determine maximum and minimum horizonta l stress orientations. In combination with rock physical propertie s data, this will be used to constrain stress magnitudes that may reflect variations in absolute strength of the plate boundary belo w (e.g., Zoback et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2010). Downhole temperature will constrain thermal models of the margi n needed to estimate the temperature structure and its relationship t o slow slip and, ultimately, to estimate the loci of thermally driven dehydration reactions relative to SSE source regions (e.g., Saffer et al., 2008; Peacock, 2009). During Expedition 375, core samples collected from Site U1519 will enable measurements of rock elasti c and physical properties needed to interpret observatory data an d wellbore failures. Pore fluid analysis at Site U1519 will help to evaluate the source of fluids above and surrounding the region of SSE, which may flow upward and escape through the fractured an d structurally disrupted upper plate (e.g., Kopf et al., 2003; Hensen e t al., 2004; Ranero et al., 2008; Barnes et al., 2010). Core samples an d downhole data from Site U1519 will provide critical physical an d elastic properties information for the refined depth conversion o f seismic data.

# Tuaheni Landslide Complex: hypotheses and scientific objectives  

We planned to test the following hypotheses that may link ga s hydrates to creeping:  

• Hypothesis 1: overpressure may lead to slow sliding at the BGHS, in a modification of conventional models linking gas hydrates to seafloor instability (Phrampus and Hornbach, 2012; Figure F7A).   
• Hypothesis 2: overpressure at the BGHS causes hydrofracturing, facilitating transmission of overpressure into the hydrate zone and sediment weakening, similar to mechanisms proposed for seafloor erosion on Rock Garden south of the TLC (Pecher et al., 2005; Crutchley et al., 2010) (hydrate pressure valve; Figure F7B).   
• Hypothesis 3: interstitial gas hydrates in sediments within the TLC slide mass may cause creeping deformation, perhaps because of ice-like viscous behavior of hydrates (hydrate glacier; Figure F7C).  

Antitheses (i.e., mechanisms that do not involve gas hydrates ) include the following:  

• Antithesis 1: creeping in the TLC could be caused by repeated small-scale failure associated with buildup and release of overpressure, the originally proposed mechanism behind creeping (Mountjoy et al., 2009).   
• Antithesis 2: earthquake-related liquefaction of coarse silt beds, as detected during recent MeBo drilling, facilitates downslope movement.  

Our program was designed to distinguish between the propose d hypotheses based on their following key manifestations:  

• Hypothesis 1 (sliding at the BGHS): the key process controlling creeping would be elevated pressure at the BGHS. Temperature profiles will be important to reconstruct past pressure-temperature disturbances that may be causing ongoing gas hydrate dissociation and resulting overpressure. • Hypothesis 2 (hydrate pressure valve): overpressure is present at the BGHS and transmitted into the gas hydrate stability zone.  

The presence of a fracture network above the BGHS allows transmission of overpressure to the décollement, which facilitates creeping. No such fracture networks would be expected in the compressional part of the TLC. • Hypothesis 3 (hydrate glacier): gas hydrate saturation would be expected to change across the décollement. Compressional and extensional parts of the slides would not show any significant differences in terms of pore pressure or fractures.  

The antitheses would not predict any anomalies linked to ga s hydrate saturation, in particular no pressure disruption at th e BGHS or fracture networks related to gas hydrates. The two proposed mechanisms would otherwise have different signatures:  

• Antithesis 1 (repeated small-scale seafloor failure): elevated pore pressure would be expected in the compressional regime (pressure charging) compared to the extensional zone (discharged). • Antithesis 2 (liquefaction of coarse silt beds): cores might reveal localized shearing and liquefaction within the shear zone.  

We planned to obtain the necessary data for distinguishing between our proposed creeping mechanisms by achieving the following objectives through drilling the TLC.  

1. TLC Objective 1: obtain lithologic information within the creeping slides, in particular across the proposed décollement of creeping.  

Coring was planned to obtain information on the litholog y within the creeping, extensional part of the TLC and the underlyin g sediments. Recovering cores across the proposed décollement fo r creeping, from which MeBo drilling did not obtain any cores, was  a high priority using the R/V JOIDES Resolution’s advanced pisto n corer (APC) and half-length APC (HLAPC) systems. Lithologic information will be extrapolated using the seismic data.  

2. TLC Objective 2: collect samples for shore-based laboratory studies.  

The microscopic distribution of gas hydrate in sediments and it s interaction with the sediment frame may be highly dependent o n porosity distribution and mineralogy, such as clay minerals. W e planned to test whether and how creeping may be linked to viscou s behavior of the hydrate-sediment mix by conducting laborator y measurements on material recovered from the TLC. Sediment s from APC, HLAPC, and, potentially, pressure cores at our site in th e extensional regime (Site U1517) may be reconstituted followed b y formation of gas hydrates. Alternatively, intact samples from th e APC and HLAPC systems may be used for hydrate formation.  

3. TLC Objective 3: constrain in situ gas hydrate saturation and composition.  

Gas hydrate saturation with depth is a key parameter for al l three proposed hydrate-related creep mechanisms. We planned t o constrain profiles of gas hydrate saturation with depth based o n LWD data and pore water chlorinity data from APC and HLAP C cores. Degassing of pressure cores was planned for additional calibration of gas hydrate saturation and for determination of the hydrate-forming gas composition. The gas composition is importan t for hydrate stability calculations and improved understanding of th e general gas and gas hydrate system at the TLC. Furthermore, por e water profiles would provide information on fluid sources.  

4. TLC Objective 4: obtain pore pressure and temperature profiles. The hydrate pressure valve model and the model of sliding at th e BGHS both involve pore pressure anomalies. Furthermore, the antithesis of repeated small-scale sliding at the BGHS without gas hydrate involvement is predicted to have a characteristic pressur e signature. Pore pressure profiles are particularly important in th e creeping extensional regime, where we planned a program using th e temperature dual-pressure tool (T2P) to calibrate pore pressure. Emphasis will be on pore pressure changes across the propose d décollement and the BGHS. Temperature profiles are needed t o constrain gas hydrate stability. Furthermore, changes in paleo–bottom water temperatures are a likely cause for gas hydrate dissociation leading to overpressure and sliding at the BGHS. Such botto m water changes would be reflected in anomalous temperature profiles with depth. We planned to measure subseafloor temperature s with the third generation advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3).  

# 5. TLC Objective 5: search for evidence of fracturing.  

The hydrate pressure valve model predicts transmission of por e pressure through fractures from hydraulic or pneumatic fracturing. We planned to constrain sediment fracturing as a function of dept h at all three sites based on LWD data, particularly the resistivity images.  

# 6. TLC Objective 6: calibrate seismic data.  

Further quantitative analysis of the 3-D seismic data will aim a t constraining potential lateral pressure variation along the décollement and deeper layers. Results from LWD sonic logs, tied wit h pressure profiles, will allow calibration of the seismic data. Furthermore, the LWD data may also provide critical shear wave calibratio n for long-offset seismic lines (MacMahon, 2016) and ocean-botto m seismometer site survey data (Wild, 2016) with the aim of extractin g subsurface S-wave velocities using amplitude versus offset and $P_{\|}$ -toS converted waves.  

# Principal results Site U1517  

Site U1517 is located in the extensional, creeping part of th e TLC at ${\sim}720~\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figures F5, F6). The primary drillin g objective was to use LWD and sample through the landslide mas s and the gas hydrate stability zone to understand the mechanism s behind creeping.  

Predrilling interpretation was based largely on high-resolutio n 3-D seismic site survey data collected in 2014. Initial data interpretation confirmed that, in general, the transition from a compressional to extensional (creeping) regime coincides with the predicte d landward edge of the gas hydrate stability zone. The 3-D seismi c cube provided detailed images of the architecture of the TLC, particularly a horizon within the debris mass that is interpreted t o mark the décollement for the slowly deforming part of the TLC.  

The following horizons were interpreted beneath the site (Figure F8):  

• A possible décollement for creeping at 0.043 s TWT beneath the seafloor (37 mbsf for subseafloor interval velocity of $1700\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ), • The base of the debris mass at 0.069 s TWT (59 mbsf), and • The BGHS at 0.190 s TWT (162 mbsf).  

The latter is mostly defined by the termination of high-amplitud e reflections, although BSRs appear in patches along the level of th e BGHS.  

Site U1517 was previously drilled to 80 mbsf with the MeBo system (Site GeoB20831) during Sonne Voyage SO-247. The MeB o core revealed deformed clayey silt landslide debris between 0 and 2 8 mbsf with good core recovery. Between 28 and 60 mbsf, recover y was poor, yielding disturbed very fine sandy coarse silt in section s up to $1.5\textrm{m}$ long (per $_{3.5\mathrm{~m~}}$ stroke length). The cores were highl y disturbed by the drilling process and mixed with seawater. From 6 0 to $78.8~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , stiff clayey silt was sampled from within the bedde d sedimentary sequence underlying the landslide complex with goo d core recovery.  

Site-specific objectives include the following:  

• Obtain lithologic information within the creeping slide. In particular, this includes material across the interpreted décollement for creeping and the lower part of the landslide debris.   
• Collect samples for shore-based laboratory studies. Potential laboratory studies include long-term deformation tests on gas hydrate–bearing sediments and geotechnical and hydrogeological investigations of hydrate-bearing and hydrate-free sediments.   
• Constrain in situ gas hydrate saturation and composition to better understand the local gas hydrate system and to calibrate seismic data.   
• Analyze pore water profiles to improve calibration of gas hydrate saturation and to study possible fluid sources and chemical disequilibria.   
• Obtain pore pressure and temperature profiles to investigate possible overpressure and search for evidence of non-steadystate fluid and heat flux.   
• Identify fracturing and determine whether fracture patterns change across the BGHS or within the slide mass.   
• Calibrate seismic data. Beyond stratigraphic tie ins, calibration of both 3-D and long-offset 2-D seismic data will improve constraints for extending profiles of gas hydrate saturation and pore pressure away from the borehole.  

Hole U1517A was drilled to 205 mbsf with LWD starting on 1 6 December 2017. The vessel was offset by $20\textrm{m}$ for Hole U1517B, which was abandoned because of uncertainties in the position of th e mudline. Hole U1517C was drilled at the same location as U1517 B for APC/HLAPC coring, reaching 188.5 mbsf. The vessel then lef t Site U1517 for completion of the remaining LWD program befor e returning to the site on 31 December to drill Hole U1517D fo r T2P/SETP deployments.  

# Core lithology and structure  

The lithostratigraphy in Hole U1517C is characterized as claye y silt with sandy intervals (Figure F11). We defined five lithostratigraphic units (I–V) based on visual description of core material, smear slide analysis, and red-green-blue (RGB) color and magneti c susceptibility logs. Smear slide analysis shows that Units I–IV hav e distinct characteristics with an overall decrease in grain size downcore from Unit I to IV, whereas Unit V includes a broad distributio n of grain sizes. A variety of drilling-related core disturbance occurred, making robust interpretation of sedimentary structure challenging. Sedimentary structures, including sharp upper contact s and irregular basal contacts in graded beds, suggest that significan t postdepositional modification of has taken place. Overall, we interpret this stratigraphic succession as including bedded turbidite sequences,  mass  transport  deposits  (MTDs),  and  backgroun d hemipelagic sedimentation. The upper ${\sim}67\$ mbsf are within th e TLC and appear to be primarily an intact block that likely mobilize d from the upper slope sedimentary sequences.  

# Physical properties  

Physical properties were characterized through a set of measurements on whole cores, split cores, and discrete samples. Th e magnetic susceptibility profile generally corresponds to the lithostratigraphic units, with sequences of sand and mud showing mor e variable magnetic susceptibility than laminated clay and silt or massive silty clay. Moisture and density (MAD) measurements on discrete samples from cores indicate relatively low porosity $\left({\sim}0.44\right)$ starting a few meters below the seafloor. A porosity shift occurs a t 66 mbsf, with values increasing to 0.48. $P$ -wave velocity an d strength measurements on cores were compromised or prevente d by expansion due to gas disturbance below 20 mbsf. Thermal conductivity measurements yield values averaging $1.2\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ in th e cored section. Fluctuations in thermal conductivity are small an d appear inversely related to porosity, as expected based on the highe r thermal conductivity of solids.  

# Downhole measurements  

The APCT-3 was deployed seven times in Hole U1517C. Fou r successful deployments between 81 and 132 mbsf define a linea r temperature-depth profile with a gradient of $39.8^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ . This gradient, combined with the average thermal conductivity measured o n cores, yields an estimate of vertical conductive heat flow of 4 9 $\mathrm{{mW/m^{2}}}$ .  

Four attempts were made to measure in situ formation pressur e and temperature in Hole U1517D. The T2P was deployed at 80 an d $120\,\mathrm{\mbsf}.$ The first deployment took a good formation pressur e measurement. The second deployment may have collected goo d data, but it could not yet be retrieved because the electronic s flooded. The SETP was deployed at 130 and 168.7 mbsf. Tool deployment and recovery went smoothly; however, the data file of th e first measurement was erased from the memory card and the dat a file of the second measurement was corrupted. Efforts continue t o convert the native data into a clean ASCII file.  

# Logging while drilling  

Hole U1517A recorded LWD data to the target depth of 20 5 mbsf (Table T1). Five LWD tools (NeoScope, SonicScope, TeleScope, proVISION, and geoVISION) were deployed on the bottomhole assembly (BHA) while drilling Hole U1517A. These provide d both real-time and recorded mode data through the TLC, below th e décollement, and through the BSR. Based on the LWD measurements, five main logging units were identified that closely correspond to the lithostratigraphic units defined for Hole U1517C. Several significant features were interpreted from the logs, such a s the compacted base of the debris flow from 54 to 60 mbsf and natural gas hydrate occurring in $10{-}30~\mathrm{cm}$ thick turbidite sands fro m 110 to $150~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . Both conductive and resistive fractures were als o identified throughout the hole; however, a higher fracture densit y occurred within the landslide complex.  

# Geochemistry  

We collected 75 whole-round samples for characterization o f the pore water in Hole U1517C. Samples were collected on the catwalk at a frequency of four samples per core in the upper $15.2\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ and two samples per core from 15.2 to $112.4\,\mathrm{mbsf}.$ Below this depth, sample selection was guided by cold anomalies observed in infrare d camera images that suggested the potential for gas hydrate occurrence. Additional samples were taken away from the cold anomalie s to establish the in situ background chloride concentrations. Dissolved chloride measurements indicate the presence of discrete ga s hydrate occurrences between ${\sim}135$ and 165 mbsf, with gas saturation $(S_{\mathrm{h}})$ values ranging from $2\%$ to $68\%$ . This distribution is consistent with inferences on gas hydrate saturation based on resistivit y data obtained by LWD. When it was possible to isolate thin dar k coarse silt layers from the background fine clay matrix, we analyze d each lithology separately. Within these separated samples, gas hydrate in the fine clay layers that were immediately in contact wit h the gas hydrate–bearing, coarse-grained layers ranged from nondetectable to $2\%$ , whereas the thin coarse layers within the whol e round host gas hydrate at saturations ranging from 5 to $50\%$ . Thi s illustrates the preferential occurrence of gas hydrate in the coarsegrained material.  

Pore fluid composition reflects the combined effects of microbially mediated organic matter degradation coupled to carbonat e and silica diagenetic changes. The sulfate–methane transitio n (SMT) is well defined at 16.6 mbsf by depletion of dissolved sulfat e and a marked increase in methane concentration in headspace samples. Alkalinity, calcium, and magnesium show distributions tha t are typical for reactions occurring at the SMT.  

Below the SMT, methane concentrations rapidly increase to a s much as $1\%$ , indicating ongoing methanogenesis. The measure d methane concentrations below the SMT are close to or above por e water saturation at ambient conditions. These values are qualitativ e estimates only because they reflect the amount of gas remaining i n the sediment after core recovery and handling rather than the original values.  

Ethane was not detected in the headspace samples above 14 6 mbsf, but it was repeatedly measured at very low concentrations o f 1–2 parts per million by volume (ppmv) between 146 and 166 mbsf, a depth range that coincides with the inferred presence of gas hydrate from the chloride data.  

Pore water profiles in the methanogenic zone suggest a combination of reactions that may include silicate weathering and formation of authigenic minerals that remove iron, manganese, calcium, and potassium from the pore water.  

Analyses of the solid phase yielded $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ values ranging fro m 4.63 to $8.99~\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{{mean}\,=\,6.52\,\pm\,1.13~w t\%}$ . Total organic carbo n concentrations are generally ${<}1\%$ with slightly higher concentrations in lithostratigraphic Unit IV $(\mathrm{mean}=0.71\pm0.16\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ organi c carbon within this unit) and a few measurements that reached 1.6 8 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ in Unit V. The C/N ratios ranged from 3.78 to 31.34 (mean $=$ $9.46\pm3.52)$ ) with variations that suggest higher heterogeneity of th e organic matter in lithostratigraphic Units II and V.  

# Log-seismic integration  

LWD logs were tied to seismic profile In-line 1778 of the Tuaheni 3-D seismic volume through a set of synthetic seismogram s (Figure F11). Two sets of synthetics were constructed. One set edited the LWD density and sonic logs to calculate acoustic impedance logs that were convolved with a wavelet derived from th e seafloor of the seismic data. The other set used a log-lithologi c model of the main lithostratigraphic units and physical properties. Washouts due to silty/sandy lithologies led to relatively poor qualit y density and sonic logs. Therefore, the synthetic seismograms di d not match well. However, the main lithostratigraphic and loggin g units were tied to the primary seismic reflection units and thei r boundaries. The mismatches in depth between the seismic and lo g data allowed us to refine the velocity profile at the drill site in orde r to reconvert the depth section.  

# Core-log integration  

By integrating LWD data taken in Hole U1517A and cores fro m Hole U1517C, we compared lithologic indicators (natural gamm a radiation [NGR], sonic $P$ -wave velocity, porosity, and bulk density ) and independent estimates of gas hydrate accumulation (pore wate r geochemistry and resistivity-porosity relationships). Whole-roun d NGR measurements are in agreement with those taken throug h LWD. Additionally, core sample–derived MAD porosities agre e well with measured LWD nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) LW D porosities, but MAD measurements are consistently lower than th e LWD neutron porosity measurements (Figure F11). Furthermore , there appears to be a slight mismatch in the depths at which significant changes in measurement responses occur: in the shallow section  above  70  mbsf,  excursions  from  baseline  values  appea r approximately $5\,\mathrm{m}$ lower in core data than LWD data. This observation is consistent across both the NGR and porosity measurements, but the trend is difficult to distinguish deeper in the wells. Hydrat e saturation was estimated using LWD-based methods and core geochemistry analysis. These techniques agree in their assessment o f the most probable areas of hydrate occurrence but disagree in thei r predictions of hydrate saturation magnitude, likely due to differences in sampling resolution and formation heterogeneity.  

# Site U1518  

Site U1518 is located on the lower continental slope approximately $62\,\mathrm{km}$ from shore (Figures F2, F9). The site lies on the frontal accretionary wedge about $6.5~\mathrm{km}$ west of the deformation fron t at $2636\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth. Site U1518 targeted a major west-dippin g thrust fault that ramps from the interplate thrust and reaches th e seafloor along an escarpment about $500{-}1000\;\mathrm{m}$ east of the drillin g site (Figure F3). The geological and contemporary rate of activity o n the thrust has not yet been established, but predrilling estimate s suggest it may accommodate a significant proportion of the plat e convergence across the margin. Seafloor geodetic data indicate tha t SSEs on the interplate thrust farther west extend off shore (trenchward) into the vicinity of Site U1518.  

The primary objective at Site U1518 during Expedition 372 wa s to acquire LWD data to help characterize the structure and locatio n of the shallow part of the fault and the nature of the sedimentar y sequences that host it. These data will be integrated with propose d cores from this site planned for Expedition 375, and both types o f data will be used to identify suitable formations and fault rock fo r hosting a borehole observatory planned for installation during Expedition 375. With very shallow SSEs on this northern segment o f the Hikurangi margin recurring every 1.5–2.0 years, it is anticipate d that the borehole observatory will record pressure, temperature, and fluid flow transients associated with SSE-propagated strain s within the frontal accretionary wedge.  

Based on predrilling interpretation of the seismic data at Sit e U1518, the thrust fault was expected to lie between 295 and 32 5 mbsf. The hanging wall sequence (i.e., the sediment above the fault ) was expected to include $65{-}82\,\mathrm{m}$ of moderately reflective sediment, overlying a relatively weakly reflective interval characterized by irregular reflections and assumed to be Plio–Pleistocene in age. Th e hanging wall sequence apparently dips easterly within the forelim b of an anticlinal fold associated with the thrust fault. The footwall sequence (i.e., below the fault) to the 600 mbsf target drilling dept h was expected to include a relatively strongly reflective interval a t least $70\;\mathrm{m}$ thick immediately below the fault that overlies a relativ e weakly reflective lower sequence. The entire footwall sequenc e drilled has an apparent westerly dip on the seismic profile, and a t depths above $600~\mathrm{mbsf},$ it is inferred to be Plio–Pleistocene in age. The entire borehole was expected to encounter predominantly tectonically accreted muddy and sandy lithologies, including turbidites.  

Site-specific objectives include the following:  

• Identify the location of the primary thrust fault, including the distribution and density of fractures visible in borehole resistivity images, and any associated structure that can be inferred from bedding dips. These data will help to constrain fracture permeability and kinematic models of thrust and fold development.   
• Characterize the lithologic composition and geophysical properties of the footwall and hanging wall sedimentary sequences, including their density, resistivity, porosity, NGR, sonic velocity, consolidation state, and gas hydrate content.   
• Acquire downhole temperature data that will inform interpretations of future borehole observatory measurements and help to constrain the loci of thermally driven dehydration reactions and their relationship to SSE source regions.   
• Identify the present maximum and minimum stress orientations from borehole breakouts. In combination with rock physical properties data, these data will be used to constrain stress magnitudes that may reflect variations in absolute strength of the plate boundary fault.   
• When cores are collected, as is currently planned for Expedition 375, they will provide additional information on meso- and microscale structure, lithology, porosity, permeability, density, shear strength, age, thermal conductivity, NGR, sonic velocity, and geochemical compositions of present and past pore fluid. Pore fluid analysis of samples will help to evaluate the source of fluids above and surrounding the region of SSEs, whereas geotechnical measurements undertaken on core samples will provide information on fault and host formation permeability, consolidation state, frictional properties, and strength.  

# Logging while drilling  

Six LWD tools were deployed on the BHA (NeoScope, SonicScope, TeleScope, proVISION, geoVISION, and StethoScope) whil e drilling Holes U1518A (118 mbsf) and U1518B (600 mbsf), providing both real-time and recorded mode data to the targeted dept h (Table T1). Based on the LWD physical properties measurements , six main logging units were identified and were divided into subunits based on the observed physical properties characteristics o f the sediments (Figure F12). Numerous significant features were interpreted from the logs, such as the thrust fault zone and associate d sand/silt units. The fault zone, interpreted at about 320 mbsf, is associated with a reduction in resistivity and density and an increas e in porosity with depth. Details of the fault location and slip distribution are expected to be derived from coring during Expedition 375. The hanging wall of the thrust fault is characterized by high $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ an d $V_{\mathrm{{S}}},$ and the footwall is characterized by relatively low velocity.  A high-amplitude seismic reflection interval in the footwall sequenc e is associated with interpreted sandy sediments characterized by increased borehole washout beneath 350 mbsf. Within this interval, an abrupt change in physical properties occurs close to $370~\mathrm{mbsf},$ where a deeper fault possibly occurs. Clusters of both resistive an d conductive fractures were observed in the resistivity images, mor e commonly in the fault hanging wall sequence. Borehole breakout s can be observed toward the base of the hole. The StethoScope tool was deployed six times at two stations; however, none of the por e pressure measurements were successful because the tool was unable to make a seal with the borehole wall.  

# Log-seismic integration  

Site U1518 LWD measurements were integrated with seismi c Line 05CM04 (Figure F12), which crosses the site at common dept h point (CDP) 4319. Five seismic units (SUs), defined from reflectio n characteristics, were correlated with logging units through a timedepth relationship derived from the high-quality sonic $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ data. O f particular interest, the ${\sim}70\mathrm{~m~}$ thick highly reflective SU 3 (300–37 0 mbsf) encompasses the major thrust and the rock units in the hanging wall and footwall directly adjacent to the fault zone. The stron g reflections in this SU are likely caused by the large impedance variations among the lithostratigraphic units, the possible fluid-rich interval, and the units with increased bed thickness and coarse r sediments.  

# Site U1519  

Site U1519 (proposed Site HSM-01A) is located on the uppe r continental slope approximately $35\,\mathrm{km}$ from shore (Figure F2). Th e site is located on regional seismic Profile 05CM-04 at the landwar d edge of a $12\,\mathrm{km}$ wide midslope sedimentary basin at $1000\;\mathrm{m}$ wate r depth (Figures F2, F5). The basin is officially unnamed but is referred to here as the North Tuaheni Basin. The slope west of the basin rises to the edge of the continental shelf and hosts the Nort h Tuaheni Landslide. This landslide and other landslides immediatel y to the north that are geomorphically more juvenile delivered lat e Quaternary MTDs directly into the basin. The seafloor in the basi n is underlain by these deposits and is approximately horizontal, wit h localized relief of ${<}20\;\mathrm{m}$ in the area of the drilling site.  

Active thrust faults of the upper plate reach the seafloor on th e shelf west of Site U1519 and on the mid–lower slope to the southeast. No active thrust faults are recognized directly beneath th e North Tuaheni Basin; however, an apparently inactive northwestdipping thrust lies $1.1\,\mathrm{km}$ below Site U1519 (Figure F3). This fault i s associated with a northwest-dipping eroded hanging wall sequence. The plate interface thrust characterized by SSEs lies about $5\,\mathrm{km}$ below the basin floor.  

The primary objective at Site U1519 was to acquire LWD data t o 650 mbsf to help characterize the nature of the sedimentary sequences before a planned borehole observatory is installed durin g Expedition 375. Coring operations at Site U1519 are also planne d for Expedition 375. The objective of the borehole observatory is t o record measurements of pressure and temperature over multipl e SSE cycles at a site on the inner margin approximately above the loc i of large SSE displacements modeled from geodetic data. In additio n to assisting in the planning of observatory targets, LWD logs an d core from Site U1519 will provide constraints on the evolution o f the upper slope and basin environment, as well as the timing of apparent thrust cessation across this section of the inner continental slope.  

Site-specific objectives include the following:  

• Characterize the lithologic composition and geophysical properties of the basin above the SSE source region to assist in the selection of stratigraphic targets for the borehole observatory installation. This includes characterizing the formation density, resistivity, porosity, NGR, sonic velocity, consolidation state, and gas hydrate content.  

• Identify the distribution and density of fractures visible in borehole images to evaluate deformation of the basin at a subseismic scale.   
• Identify the present maximum and minimum stress orientations from borehole breakouts and compare these with data from the other sites to evaluate regional variations in contemporary stress across the margin.   
• When cores are collected, as is currently planned for Expedition 375, they will provide additional information on meso- and microscale structure, lithology, porosity, permeability, density, shear strength, age, thermal conductivity, NGR, sonic velocity, and geochemical compositions of present and past pore fluid. Pore fluid analysis of samples will help to evaluate the source of fluids above the region of SSEs, whereas geotechnical measurements undertaken on core samples will provide information on formation permeability, consolidation state, frictional properties, and strength.  

# Logging while drilling  

Hole U1519A was logged to the target depth of 650 mbsf. Si x LWD tools were deployed on the BHA (NeoScope, SonicScope, TeleScope, proVISION, geoVISION, and StethoScope) while drilling Hole U1519A, providing both real-time and recorded mod e data. Based on the LWD measurements, three main logging unit s and ten subunits were identified (Figure F13). From 140 to 22 0 mbsf, significant low values of gamma ray, resistivity, and velocit y due to washout of the borehole are associated with an inferred increase in sand content. Other similar intervals are recognized nea r 300 and 450 mbsf. Below 550 mbsf, resistive layers are well identified in the imaged interval. The intervals are characterized by th e spikes of high resistivity (tens of ohm meters) and velocity. Borehol e breakouts are identified in the interval from 597 to 650 mbsf. Bedding features show various direction and angles throughout th e borehole. The fractures occur sparsely throughout the borehole an d include a notable high-density cluster just below the sandy interva l (around 230 mbsf).  

# Log-seismic integration  

LWD logs were correlated to a depth-converted version of seismic Line 05CM-04 and high-resolution seismic Line TAN1404- P3106 (Figure F13). The quality of the LWD data was sufficient fo r correlation, except for some gaps in compressional velocity an d missing density at the top of the site. The three main logging unit s were tied to the boundaries of the three seismic stratigraphic units. In particular, the image data matches very well with the amplitude s and architecture of the reflections in the high-resolution seismi c data. Mismatches in depth between the seismic and log data will allow us to refine the velocity profile at the drill site in order to bette r convert the depth section.  

# Site U1520  

Site U1520 is located on the floor of the Hikurangi Trough between the deformation front and Tūranganui Knoll (Figures F2, F10). The site lies approximately $95\;\mathrm{km}$ from shore and $16\,\mathrm{km}$ eas t of the deformation front at $3521\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figure F2). Th e seafloor in this location is a flat plain, and in the vicinity of Sit e U1520, it is underlain by about $1\;\mathrm{km}$ of sediment overlying the inferred volcanic rocks of the Hikurangi Plateau (Figure F3). This sequence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks collectively represent s the inputs to the subduction zone. The cover sedimentary sequenc e in this area is condensed relative to the southern Hikurangi margin, where up to $9\,\mathrm{km}$ of the total sedimentary section, including 6 km o f Miocene to recent turbidites, overlies the plateau.  

Regional bathymetric data show that the Tūranganui Knoll i s one of numerous seamounts that characterize the northern Hikurangi Plateau. Predrilling interpretations of regional seismic reflection lines and gravity anomaly data indicate irregular crustal relie f also beneath the Hikurangi Trough, with seamounts and ridges o f various scales buried beneath the sedimentary sections to varyin g degrees. At the deformation front west of Site U1520, practically th e entire sedimentary cover sequence is accreting, with the plate interface décollement located close to the top of the plateau volcanics.  

The primary objective at Site U1520 was to acquire LWD data t o 1200 mbsf to constrain the accreting sequence and upper part of th e subducting volcanic section. This site represents the first ever drilling in the Hikurangi Trough. Through correlation of the sequence s away from the drilling site to the deformation front on seismic sections, it was expected that the LWD data would provide insight int o the lithologies and conditions at the shallow part of the subductio n plate interface where SSEs are believed to occur close the trench. The site was intentionally located adjacent to Tūranganui Knoll, where the turbidite trench section is relatively condensed compare d to farther west, closer to the deformation front. In addition to LW D data acquired during Expedition 372, coring at the site is als o planned for Expedition 375.  

Based on predrilling interpretation of the Hikurangi Troug h seismic data, consideration of regional Hikurangi Plateau seismi c stratigraphy, and previous drilling at Ocean Drilling Program Sit e 1124 (Leg 181) on the eastern side of the plateau, the sequence a t Site U1520 was expected to include the following:  

• About $610{-}640\;\mathrm{m}$ of clastic sediments, including turbidites, MTDs, hemipelagic sediments, and volcanic ash, all likely to be Pliocene–Quaternary in age. This sequence includes the Ruatoria avalanche MTD.   
• About $210{-}230\;\mathrm{m}$ of predominantly pelagic sedimentary sequence of Late Cretaceous (?) to Miocene age. This interval may include nannofossil chalk, mudstone, tephra, and unconformities.   
• The top of the volcanic rocks of the Hikurangi Plateau at about 840 mbsf.   
• Basalts and volcaniclastic rocks, including breccia, chert, and/or limestone rocks, immediately below 840 mbsf.  

Site-specific objectives include the following:  

• Characterize the lithologic composition and geophysical properties, such as formation density, resistivity, porosity, NGR, and sonic velocity, of the Hikurangi Trough inputs sequence “protolith” to provide insights into possible interplate thrust fault zone and host rock properties.   
• Identify the distribution and density of fractures visible in borehole images to evaluate deformation and stress state of the input section east of the deformation front at subseismic scale.   
• Identify the present maximum and minimum stress orientations from borehole breakouts and compare these with data from the other sites to evaluate regional variations in contemporary stress across the margin.   
• When cores are collected, as is currently planned for Expedition 375, they will provide additional information on lithology, porosity, permeability, density, meso- and microscale structure, shear strength, age, thermal conductivity, NGR, sonic velocity, and geochemical compositions of present and past pore fluid  

and information on the sediment source and depositional process. Pore fluid analysis of samples will help to evaluate the source of fluids, whereas geotechnical measurements undertaken on core samples will provide information on fault zone protolith host formation permeability, consolidation state, frictional properties, and strength. The combined LWD and core data from all inputs sites will enable refined depth conversion of the existing 2-D and planned 3-D seismic data. They will also extend knowledge of in situ conditions (stress, fault zone properties, and pore pressure) away from the boreholes over a much broader region.  

Overall, these objectives will constrain (1) the composition an d frictional properties of subduction inputs and the shallow plate interface, (2) the hydrologic and thermal conditions of the incomin g plate and shallow fault, and (3) the structural character, stress conditions, and mechanical properties of the main active thrust an d subduction inputs.  

# Logging while drilling  

Time constraints due to downtime during Expedition 372 mean t that drilling to the target depth of 1200 mbsf was not achievable. The site was drilled to a total depth of 750 mbsf. Six LWD tool s (NeoScope, SonicScope, TeleScope, proVISION, geoVISION, an d StethoScope) were deployed in Holes U1520A and U1520B, providing both real-time and recorded mode data (Table T1). In bot h holes, the resistivity image quality suffers from slip and stick as  a result of the high drilling penetration rate.  

References to major reflection units determined from seismi c sections were used to help define logging units relevant to the stratigraphic architecture of the sedimentary section in the Hikurang i Trough. Nine logging units were identified in Hole U1520B, reflecting significant changes in the sediment physical properties recorde d by the logs (Figure F14). The uppermost $100\;\mathrm{m}$ is interpreted to b e relatively sandy sediment, mainly turbidities, associated with borehole washouts. These overlie approximately $^{110}\,\mathrm{m}$ of finer graine d sediments of the Ruatoria MTD. The sediments beneath the Ruatoria MTD comprise alternating fine- and coarser grained sedimentary packages that show progressive compaction associated wit h increasing density and decreasing porosity with depth to a boundary at around 510 mbsf. At this depth there is a marked change t o sediments that have a different acoustic character, higher density, and significantly lower gamma ray. Several further units with distinct logging characteristics are identified in the lower $150\;\mathrm{m}$ of th e borehole. Although the logs do not enable direct identification o f the rock type, the petrophysical characteristics and the tie to seismic reflectivity indicate that the pelagic sequence overlying th e Tūranganui Knoll was partially drilled. Owing to generally poo r hole conditions and a fast rate of penetration, the image logs ar e poor quality through much of the drilled section in both Hole s U1520A and U1520B. Dipping beds, however, were identified i n many of the logging units. Above approximately 510 mbsf, beddin g dip inclination and azimuth appear to be variable, particularly in th e Ruatoria MTD. In the underlying sequence, the bedding dips ar e most commonly at low angles to the northwest, west, and southwest. Several high-angle resistive fractures were identified in th e sediments between 100 and 150 mbsf and between 660 and 71 0 mbsf in Hole U1520B.  

# Log-seismic integration  

The seismic data available for Site U1520 allows correlation wit h the LWD data from Holes U1520A and U1520B (Figure F14). Seve n seismic stratigraphic units were defined based on the reflection geometry and amplitude patterns. Several of the unit interfaces correspond to either erosion by landslides or unconformities. At this site, there is a very good correlation between the LWD logging units an d the seismic stratigraphic units, with density, gamma ray, and resistivity curves showing pronounced shifts in their curve trends a t depths concordant with seismic unit boundaries. The upper 40 6 mbsf is generally characterized by relatively low seismic amplitudes. The upper 102 mbsf is characterized by strong reflections, wherea s the underlying Ruatoria MTD stands out as a $126~\mathrm{m}$ thick packag e composed of chaotic, mottled, and weaker reflections. The sequences below 406 mbsf are characterized by markedly higher amplitudes associated with inferred sandy (turbidite) deposits that di p gently northwest. The lower part of Hole U1520B coincides with a n increasing occurrence of irregular high-amplitude seismic reflections. The basin-filling strata generally onlaps a low-amplitud e package with chaotic reflections located along the flank of th e Tūranganui Knoll. Prominent changes in density, porosity, an d gamma ray occur at about 630 mbsf, close to the expected transitio n from hemipelagic basin fill to pelagic sediments. Synthetic seismograms produced from the density and velocity logs generally sho w good correlations with the seismic data analyzed.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 372 combined two research topics, SSEs on subduction faults (IODP Proposal 781A-Full) and actively deformin g gas hydrate–bearing landslides (Proposal 841-APL). Our study are a on the Hikurangi margin east of New Zealand provided a uniqu e location for addressing both research topics within the same area o f continental margin.  

# Hikurangi subduction slow slip  

The northern HSM, New Zealand, offered us a globally uniqu e opportunity to use ocean floor drilling technology within IODP t o study SSEs on a subduction thrust fault. SSEs at northern Hikurang i are among the best-documented from land-based and offshore geodetic monitoring and are the shallowest known SSEs on Earth. The y recur about every 2 years and appear to extend close to the trench, where clastic and pelagic sediments about $1.0{-}1.5~\mathrm{km}$ thick overli e the subducting Hikurangi Plateau. These attributes made the northern Hikurangi margin amenable to an ambitious scientific drillin g program involving LWD, coring, and installation of borehole observatories. To achieve this program, IODP scheduled this work acros s two expeditions on the JOIDES Resolution (Expeditions 372 an d 375; Saffer et al., 2017). Drilling during Expedition 372 represente d the first IODP scientific drilling ever targeted at SSE phenomena.  

The overall goal of Expeditions 372 and 375 collectively is to acquire data that will help determine the physical processes associate d with SSEs on subduction megathrusts and identify the factors tha t lead to slow slip occurring on some faults, whereas others faults o r parts of the same remain interseismically strongly coupled. Th e strategy devised across the two expeditions was to acquire LW D data and cores from two sites above the slow slipping plate boundary and up to two sites on the subducting Hikurangi Plateau. Th e former sites will have observatories installed to monitor pressure, temperature, and fluid flow transients expected through the uppe r plate in association with SSE cycles. The eastern Hikurangi Troug h and Hikurangi Plateau sites target sequences that are either subducting or accreting at the deformation front and may host the slo w slipping interplate thrust at shallow depths. These sequences are referred to as the subduction inputs. Drilling and coring the complet e sediment package in the Hikurangi Trough is aimed at providing insights into the geological, geophysical, and mechanical properties o f the décollement host rocks further west and downdip. Laboratorybased geotechnical experiments on samples to be collected durin g Expedition 375 will furthermore reveal frictional and strength properties of rocks thought to lie in the SSE source region of the interplate thrust.  

Three sites were targeted for LWD during Expedition 372, th e first phase of the Hikurangi subduction program:  

• Site U1519 in an upper margin slope basin in which an observatory installation is planned for Expedition 375; • Site U1518 into one of the frontal thrusts at the toe of the accretionary wedge, updip of the SSE source region, and a target for the second observatory installation during Expedition 375; and • Site U1520 in the Hikurangi Trough about $15\,\mathrm{km}$ east of the deformation front.  

A range of LWD tools were successfully deployed at the subduction sites during Expedition 372. These included the geoVISION,  providing  electrical  imaging;  the  NeoScope,  providin g propagation resistivity and neutron porosity; the SonicScope, providing compressional, shear, and Stoneley wave slowness; the TeleScope,  providing  measurement-while-drilling  data;  and  th e proVISION Plus, for NMR. The LWD data were collected t o (1) monitor in real time for gas entering the borehole or formatio n overpressures, (2) help identify targets for in situ pressure measurements, (3) facilitate lithologic interpretation, (4) guide interpretation of faults and fractures, (5) determine the maximum an d minimum stress directions, (6) estimate hydrate saturation, (7) hel p constrain elastic moduli for integration with seismic data, an d (8) provide guidance for observatories to be installed during Expedition 375. Another downhole measurement plan for Expeditio n 372 included using the StethoScope tool to determine formatio n pressure. This tool uses a probe inserted into the formation wall a t selected depths and has never been deployed by IODP, although  a similar wireline measurement was made using the Modular Formation Dynamics Tester during Integrated Ocean Drilling Progra m Expedition 319 (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). During Expedition 372, the StethoScope was deployed at Site U1518 six times a t two stations but failed to record pressure measurements due to  a lack of mud seal at the borehole wall.  

Overall, the drilling depths achieved at the three subductio n sites were reasonably successful considering Expedition 372 suffered time constraints due to two bad weather events that passe d through the region and to operational delays departing Australia related to biosecurity requirements in New Zealand waters. Targe t drilling depths were reached at both Sites U1518 $\left(600\ \mathrm{mbsf}\right)$ an d U1519 (650 mbsf; Table T1). At Site U1520 in the Hikurang i Trough, we achieved 750 mbsf of the total planned depth of 120 0 mbsf as a result of advised operational rescheduling to complet e other aspects of the expedition.  

Some general drilling highlights are outlined below for each site.  

# Site U1518: frontal accretionary wedge thrust fault  

The primary objective at Site U1518 during Expedition 372 wa s to log to 600 mbsf through one of the primary thrust faults tha t emerge from the plate interface in the SSE source region. The goal was to acquire LWD data to help characterize the structure and location of the shallow part of the fault and the nature of the sedimentary sequences that host it. These data will be integrated wit h proposed cores from this site planned for Expedition 375, and bot h types of data will be used to identify suitable formations and faul t rock for hosting a borehole observatory planned for installatio n during Expedition 375.  

We drilled two holes (U1518A and U1518B) because ba d weather interrupted Hole U1518A. Hole U1518B produced excellent quality logging data and exciting on board science. We successfully drilled to the target depth of 600 mbsf and infer that w e penetrated the thrust fault zone at about 320 mbsf. This depth i s very close to that predicted from various depth-converted seismi c reflection data made available to us prior to drilling. Not unexpectedly, the logs reveal a sequence above the fault with different physical properties than those below the fault (Figure F12), partl y resulting from inferred relatively older material being thrust ove r relatively younger material. In addition, changes in seismic reflection character within the drilled interval, thought to be related t o lithology during predrilling interpretation of seismic data, produce d closely aligned changes in logging parameters with depth. The logging data reveal detailed insights into the likely lithologies in th e borehole and physical properties that will enable advanced analyse s of deformation, bedding attitude, thrust mechanics, stress state, an d hydrogeology. We successfully identified the distribution and density of fractures visible in borehole images and associated structure s that can be inferred from bedding dips. These data will help to constrain fracture permeability and kinematic models of thrust and fol d development. We also observed borehole breakouts that will allo w us to identify the present maximum and minimum stress orientations. Another important success at Site U1518 is the geophysical resolution provided by the logging data, which will be valuable t o assist in selecting depth targets for the borehole observatory installation planned for Expedition 375.  

# Site U1519: upper margin slope basin  

The primary objective at Site U1519 was to log to 650 mbsf t o help characterize the nature of the sedimentary sequences before  a planned borehole observatory installation during Expedition 375. We successfully acquired generally good quality logging data to th e target depth. We found an excellent correlation between changes i n logging parameters and three major sedimentary sequences tha t were interpreted on seismic reflection profiles prior to drilling (Figure F13). In addition, a remarkably good match occurs betwee n subunits recognized in the logs and complex subunits that were inferred to correspond to changes in lithology in the seismic data. Shipboard analysis indicates that the logs provide information o n bedding thicknesses and dips, fracture orientations, and density. The lower part of the borehole successfully penetrated a west-dipping sedimentary sequence beneath the seafloor that lies on th e landward (back limb) side of an apparently inactive thrust fault. Borehole breakouts in the lower part of the hole will provide indications of current stress directions, whereas logging properties, suc h as compressional and shear wave velocity and density data, will improve analysis of seismic refection data away from the borehole site.  

As with Site U1518, an important success at Site U1519 is th e geophysical resolution that is provided by the logging data, whic h will assist in planning the bore observatory installation during Expedition 375.  

# Site U1520: Hikurangi Trough, subduction inputs sequence  

The primary objective at Site U1520 was to acquire LWD data t o 1200 mbsf to constrain the accreting sequence and upper part of th e subducting volcanic section. This site represents the first ever drilling in the Hikurangi Trough. Through correlation of the sequence s away from the site to the deformation front on seismic sections, i t was expected that the LWD data would provide insight into th e lithologies and conditions at the subduction plate interface wher e SSEs are believed to occur close the trench.  

We drilled two holes (U1520A and U1520B) because ba d weather interrupted Hole U1520A (Table T1). Hole U1520 B reached a total depth of 750 mbsf and was then abandoned to undertake other work at Site U1517. Consequently, we did not reac h our predrilling objective of drilling through the oldest sedimentar y sequences and penetrating the inferred volcanic rocks corresponding to the lower flank of Tūranganui Knoll. Acquisition of LW D data to 750 mbsf, however, will provide Expedition 375 with operational flexibility when returning to the site for coring. Coring operations planned for Expedition 375 at this site and possibly a t proposed Site HSM-08A (Saffer et al., 2017) will be critical t o achieve the outcomes of the combined science program.  

Because the turn-around time for shore-based processing o f LWD data was typically about three days and this site was drille d close to the end of the expedition, our shipboard interpretations fo r this site are based on some unprocessed LWD data.  

The LWD logs at this site reveal numerous changes in physica l properties downhole that match very well against depth-converte d seismic reflection data (Figure F14). As at the other sites, we foun d that changes in borehole conditions revealed by the ultrasonic caliper and other logging properties, such as density, resistivity, porosity, and gamma ray, coincide well with changes in seismic reflectio n amplitudes and packages of seismic stratigraphy. In the upper an d mid-reaches of the borehole, we drilled through sequences we infe r to be predominantly turbidites and the distal reaches of the Ruatori a MTD. Although the shipboard data are preliminary, based on drilling depths and logging signatures, and consideration of the seismi c sections, we believe we drilled beneath the base of the Hikurang i Trough clastic sequence and into the inferred pelagic cover sequence of the Hikurangi Plateau.  

# Tuaheni Landslide Complex  

The primary drilling goal for the TLC was to understand th e mechanisms behind the slow deformation of the landslides an d their proposed links to gas hydrates by logging and samplin g through the landslide mass and the gas hydrate stability zone. T o achieve this goal, we planned to obtain lithologic informatio n within the creeping slides, collect samples for shore-based laboratory studies, constrain in situ gas hydrate saturation and composition,  analyze  pore  water  profiles,  obtain  pore  pressure  an d temperature profiles, study fracturing, and calibrate seismic dat a from our study area.  

Operationally, we originally planned to conduct LWD surveys a t three sites, the main Site U1517 in the extensional, creeping part o f the TLC, a site in the compressional part of the TLC above th e BGHS pinch-out (proposed Site TLC-02C), and a reference site outside the slide mass (planned primary Site TLC-03B). We planned t o core Site U1517 with the APC/HLAPC system and deploy th e T2P/SETP to measure pore pressure and temperature and the pressure core sampler (PCS) to collect sediment cores under pressur e for calibration of gas hydrate saturation and for gas hydrate composition. This plan allowed a comprehensive study of the creeping par t of the TLC and comparison with both its compressional part an d gas hydrates in the vicinity but outside the slide mass. Because o f significant downtime, we focused all our operations on the main sit e (U1517), conducting LWD, coring, and a reduced number o f T2P/SETP stations, skipping the other two sites. This compromis e aimed to minimize the impact of reduced operational time on addressing our scientific goals.  

# Meeting the objectives of the expedition: Tuaheni Landslide Complex  

We consider the TLC program overall successful in terms of allowing us to test our hypotheses and antitheses despite the significant downtime we experienced. Importantly, we were able t o complete almost the entire planned program at the main sit e (U1517). We were not, however, able to log either a site in the compressional part of the slides (proposed Site TLC-02C) or a referenc e site outside the slide mass (proposed Site TLC-03B). Results fro m gas hydrate occurrences in the deeper preslide mass interval at Sit e U1517, combined with the detection of gas hydrates at Site U1519, should allow us to interpret results from Site U1517 without a reference site. Extension of results from Site U1517 based on recently acquired long-offset 2-D seismic data should also alleviate the lack o f LWD in the compressional part of the slide. Although we were fortunate to still be able to successfully deploy the T2P and SET P within a very limited time window, we could not deploy the PCS. The objectives of pressure coring were to constrain gas hydrate saturation and composition. We are confident that we were able to ge t accurate and continuous profiles of gas hydrate saturation becaus e of the high quality of the LWD data. A number of chloride measurements provide independent and robust saturation measurements i n the $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ range. Pressure cores would have yielded average saturations over $1\;\mathrm{m}$ , closer to the resolution of LWD data and thus bette r suited for calibration. We may be able to improve calibration o f LWD data using planned laboratory experiments. We are confiden t we will obtain sufficient information on gas composition in hydrate s from the recovered hydrate samples.  

We have largely achieved the scientific objectives, listed below:  

• TLC Objective 1: obtain lithologic information within the creeping slides, in particular across the proposed décollement of creeping. We had ${>}90\%$ core recovery with the only major gaps occurring below the BGHS, probably due to gas expansion. • TLC Objective 2: collect samples for shore-based laboratory studies. This objective relates to gas hydrate studies: 13 whole rounds that, based on infrared images, are likely to contain gas hydrates were stored in liquid nitrogen and will be shipped for laboratory studies to the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (Germany), the Qingdao Institute of Marine Geology (China), and the British Geological Survey. Additional whole rounds and other samples of gas hydrate–free sediment were collected for laboratory studies involving gas hydrate formation followed by geomechanical measurements. • TLC Objective 3: constrain in situ gas hydrate saturation and composition. Because of the high quality of logs and excellent core recovery, including gas hydrate samples, we are confident this objective has been achieved for Site U1517. Proposed LWD Site TLC-02C in the compressional part of the slides is outside the hydrate stability zone, and thus hydrates are not expected to be present there. We do not have available any LWD-based gas hydrate saturation from a reference site outside the slide mass (proposed Site TLC-03B). However, we are confident we have sufficient information from Site U1519 and from the preslide interval at Site U1517 to not require the reference site for future evaluation.  

• TLC Objective 4: obtain pore pressure and temperature profiles. This objective was aimed at Site U1517. We were able to measure the temperature gradient above the BGHS. We successfully measured formation pressure at a critical depth near the base of the landslide debris. At the time of writing, we have not been able to retrieve data from a second deployment because of issues with the data logger—we are hopeful we will be able to recover the data. Given the novel design of the T2P probe, we consider this deployment a significant success.   
• TLC Objective 5: search for evidence of fracturing. Resistivity images from LWD will allow us to detect fracturing at Site U1517. Although we will not be able to compare fracture patterns with those in the compressional region of the slides, we may still be able to gain some information on changes in any fracture patterns from the seismic data.   
• TLC Objective 6: calibrate seismic data. The excellent logs should provide full calibration of the short-streamer 3-D seismic site survey at Site U1517. Canceling two additional wells within the 3-D cube will increase uncertainties in inversion approaches away from Site U1517, but this effect is partly alleviated by the acquisition of a long-streamer seismic line across Site U1517 by the Marcus Langseth in November and December 2017, which will enhance constraints away from the borehole.  

In a much broader sense, the nearly full recovery of core s through the landslide and the gas hydrate zone provides us with a n excellent record of sedimentology, lithology, physical properties, and geochemistry. The LWD data are high quality, providing important structural and geophysical information, as well as calibration for the various seismic data sets covering the TLC. Combine d with achieving most of the objectives listed above, we are confiden t that postexpedition analyses will allow us to illuminate the processes leading to “creeping” of the TLC—the primary goal of Proposal 841-APL. Some highlights of our findings are summarize d below.  

# Gas hydrates  

Gas hydrates are inferred to be present in the preslide interva l from ${\sim}110$ mbsf to the BGHS at $\mathord{\sim}160$ mbsf based on LWD data, chlorinity profiles, and direct sampling. They appear to be absen t within the landslides. Gas hydrates appear to be mostly present i n thin, coarser grained layers that have hydrate saturations reachin g up to $68\%$ , based on pore water chlorinity. Gas in headspace samples consists almost entirely of methane with only small fractions o f ethane in a limited depth interval. Furthermore, a number of gas hydrate occurrences can be inferred from LWD data at Sites U151 8 and U1519.  

# Submarine landslide processes  

LWD- and laboratory-based physical properties indicate consistent variation between the landslide debris mass and underlyin g sediment.  Disequilibrium  profiles  from  geochemical  result s through the TLC reflect temporal elements of the depositiona l structure of the system. Core lithologies are dominated by grade d fine sandy beds and clayey silts, including many turbidites. Thes e results, combined with core-log and seismic integration that provides petrophysical properties within the slide mass and surrounding lithologies, provide an exceptional framework for analyzin g active landslide processes.  

# Logging while drilling  

In Hole U1517A, five LWD tools were deployed on the BHA , providing both real-time and recorded mode data through the TLC, below the décollement, and through the BSR. Based on the LW D measurements, five main logging units were identified that closel y correspond to lithostratigraphic units defined for cores from Hol e U1517C (Figure F11). Several significant features were interprete d from the logs, such as a compacted, low-porosity base of the debri s flow from 54 to 60 mbsf and natural gas hydrate occurring in 10–3 0 cm thick turbidite sands from 110 to 150 mbsf. Both conductive an d resistive fractures were also identified throughout the hole; however, the highest fracture density occurred within the landslide. Expedition 372 provided the rare opportunity of a comprehensiv e LWD program in, by industry standards, relatively shallow sediments. Subsequently, postexpedition research projects include development of LWD methodology.  

# Operations  

During Expedition 372 we conducted LWD, piston coring, an d formation temperature and pressure operations in nine holes at fou r sites. A total of $2589.4\mathrm{~m~}$ was either drilled for LWD or advance d without recovery for selected probe measurements. A total interval of $197.9\,\mathrm{m}$ was cored at Site U1517, and $186.84\;\mathrm{m}$ of core was recovered ( $94\%$ total core recovery) (Table T1). Here, we describe the operations at each of the sites. The overall time distribution for the 3 9 day expedition included 7.3 days in port, 14.2 days in transit, an d 17.5 days on site. The vessel transited a total of $3928\ \mathrm{nmi}$ .  

# Fremantle port call  

Expedition 372 began at $0742~\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+8\h)}$ ) on 26 Novembe r 2017 with the first line ashore at Victoria Quay in Fremantle, Australia. The IODP JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) technical staff and chief scientists boarded the vessel at $0930\;\mathrm{h},$ and th e Expedition 369 science party disembarked at $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ . Port call activities started with IODP JRSO staff crew change and crossover. Th e off-going technical staff departed the vessel at $1530~\mathrm{h}$ . The shi p crew change and crossover occurred on 27 November. The Schlumberger LWD and measurement-while-drilling tools were loade d onto the ship along with other Schlumberger supplies and a ne w wireline.  

To comply with the New Zealand ship biofouling regulations , the ship scheduled a 2 day hull cleaning operation at anchorage outside of Fremantle. The vessel departed Victoria Quay with the las t line away at $1148\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 December. After a $10\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit, the shi p arrived at anchorage at $1311\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . The hull cleaning barge arrived a t around $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ and commenced work immediately.  

Hull cleaning concluded at $1610\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 December, and the pilo t came aboard the vessel at $1652~\mathrm{h}$ . After pulling up the anchor a t $1706\,\mathrm{h}$ , the vessel began the sea passage to Site U1517 at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

# Transit to Site U1517  

After a 3419 nmi transit, the ship arrived at Site U1517 at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+13\,h)}$ on 16 December 2017. The voyage took $291.9\,\mathrm{h}$ (12. 2 days) at an average of $11.7\,\mathrm{kt}$ .  

# Site U1517  

Site U1517 consisted of four holes ranging in depth from 9.4 t o 205.0 mbsf. Operations at Site U1517 included LWD, piston coring, and formation pressure and temperature measurements. In total, 3 7 cores were recorded for Site U1517.  

LWD operations with continuous safety monitoring advanced t o 205 mbsf in Hole U1517A. A total of $186.84\;\mathrm{m}$ of core over a 197. 9 m interval was recovered from Holes U1517B and U1517C usin g the APC and HLAPC systems $94\%$ core recovery). Hole U1517 D was drilled to 168.7 mbsf with probe deployments at four locations. The total time spent on site at Site U1517 was 5.1 days.  

# Hole U1517A  

Once the vessel arrived on site the thrusters were lowered, an d the ship moved to the site coordinates at 0247 h on 16 Decembe r 2017. The APC/extended core barrel (XCB) BHA was put togethe r in preparation for Hole U1517B. The LWD tool string was assembled and contained the geoVISION, SonicScope, NeoScope, TeleScope, and proVISION tools. The entire LWD BHA was $190.72\:\mathrm{m}$ i n length.  

The precision depth recorder (PDR) placed the seafloor at 722. 5 meters below sea level (mbsl), and the BHA was lowered to 67 2 mbsl for flow and pressure testing of the LWD tools to determin e the flow rates at which the tools activate. The subsea video camer a was deployed to observe the drill bit tag the seafloor, which occurred at $1755~\mathrm{h}$ . The seafloor depth for Hole U1517A was 725. 4 mbsl. The camera system was retrieved, and drilling in Hol e U1517A commenced at $1935~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 December. The bit advance d at an average rate of $20\,\mathrm{\m/h}$ . LWD in Hole U1517A continue d through 17 December, reaching the total depth of 205 mbsf at 111 5 h. After a 30-barrel mud sweep, the drill pipe and LWD BHA wer e pulled from the hole with the logging tools continuing to recor d sonic measurements. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1245\,\mathrm{h}$ and th e rotary table at $1840\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 December, ending Hole U1517A.  

# Hole U1517B  

The vessel was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ southeast (heading of 155°) for corin g operations in Hole U1517B. The APC/XCB BHA was assemble d and run to 704 mbsl. The bit was spaced out, and the first core wa s shot at 720 mbsl. Hole U1517B began at $0130~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 Decembe r 2017, and Core 1H recovered $9.4\textrm{m}$ of sediment. The mudline i n this core could not be identified with certainty. The decision wa s made to abandon Hole U1517B and attempt to recover a mudlin e core at the same hole location.  

# Hole U1517C  

The bit was raised $4\textrm{m}$ , and coring in Hole U1517C began a t $0210\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December 2017. APC Cores 1H and 2H were drilled t o 15.2 mbsf before switching to the HLAPC to recover a silt-rich interval. Cores 3F through 14F (15.2–71.6 mbsf) were taken befor e switching back to the APC for Cores 15H through 18H (71.6–108. 3 mbsf), all of which had partial strokes and were advanced by recovery. The HLAPC was redeployed for Cores 19F through 36F (108.3– $188.5~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ). Of these, Cores 19F, 20F, 22F, 23F, 25F through 28F, and 30F through 36F all recorded partial strokes and were advance d by recovery, with the exception of Cores 34F through 36F, whic h were advanced by $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ . All of the APC cores were oriented usin g either the FlexIT tool (Cores 1H and 2H) or the Icefield MI-5 cor e orientation tool (Cores 15H through 18H). The APCT-3 was run o n Cores 15H, 17H, 20F, 23F, 26F, 29F, and 34F. A total of $177.44\mathrm{~m~}$ o f core was recovered from the $188.5\;\mathrm{m}$ interval $(94\%)$ . Six APC core s were taken over a $51.9~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $52.66\mathrm{~m~}$ recovered $(101\%)$ . Thirty HLAPC cores were taken over a total interval of $136.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ with $124.78\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered $(91\%)$ .  

After reaching the total depth of 188.5 mbsf, the drill pipe wa s pulled out of the hole and the bit cleared the seafloor at $1015\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 19 December and the rotary table at $1220\ \mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1517C. The ship was secured for the $20\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1518 at $1310\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 December.  

# Hole U1517D  

The vessel returned to Site U1517 at $2300~\mathrm{h}$ on 31 Decembe r 2017 following a $32\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ transit from Site U1520. The BHA wa s made up, and the drill string was assembled in preparation for formation temperature and pressure measurements. Hole U1517D began at $^{0720\mathrm{~h~}}$ on 1 January 2018 and was drilled to $80~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . Th e center bit was retrieved, and the motion decoupled hydraulic delivery system (MDHDS) and T2P probe were deployed to make measurements of in situ formation pressure and temperature. The shea r pins failed to shear on the first attempt, and a second attempt wa s made ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{h}$ later. This time, the shear pins sheared and the T2P wa s inserted into the sediment. The tool could not be recovered usin g the Electronic Release System (ERS) on the Schlumberger wirelin e and had to be picked up using the coring winch. Upon retrieval, i t was noted that the T2P probe tip was damaged, having lost th e thermistor in the tip; however, it did record a good pressure measurement. The center bit was installed, and the hole was drilled t o 120 mbsf. After the center bit was retrieved, a second T2P prob e was deployed. After sitting in the formation for ${\sim}45~\mathrm{min}$ , the ERS, again could not retrieve the tool, and the core winch was used. Upon recovery to the rig floor, it was noted that the second T2P wa s also damaged upon recovery, this time missing the entire tapere d probe tip, and the electronics had been flooded. This damage likel y occurred during tool recovery. The hole was drilled to $130~\mathrm{mbsf},$ and the sediment temperature pressure tool (SETP) was successfully deployed using the colleted delivery system. The hole wa s drilled to a total depth of 168.7 mbsf, and a final SETP measuremen t was made. The drill string was pulled from the hole and the bi t cleared the seafloor at $1030~\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table at $1315~\mathrm{h}$ . Th e ship was secured for transit, and Site U1517 ended at $1536~\mathrm{h}$ on  2 January when the ship began the transit to Lyttelton, New Zealand.  

# Site U1518  

Site U1518 consisted of two LWD holes that were drilled t o 117.8 and 600 mbsf (Table T1). Continuous LWD safety monitorin g was performed during operations at both holes. The total operational time at Site U1518 was 3.4 days with $21~\mathrm{h}$ of that time spen t waiting on weather.  

# Hole U1518A  

The vessel arrived at Site U1518 at $1635~\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 1 9 December 2017 after a $20\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1517. The LW D BHA and drill pipe were run to $300~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , and the LWD tools wer e flow tested. After the test, drill string assembly continued. Th e LWD tool string for Site U1518 contained the geoVISION, NeoScope, StethoScope, TeleScope, SonicScope, and proVISION tools.  

The LWD tools and drill string were run to $2460~\mathrm{mbsl},$ , and th e subsea camera was deployed to determine the depth of the seafloor. While the camera descended, 115 ft of drill line was cut off. The seafloor was tagged at 2636.4 mbsl. The camera was brought to the surface, and the top drive was installed. Hole U1518A began at $0855\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 December. Weather conditions and sea state deteriorate d over the next few hours, and the logging tools were pulled out of th e hole at $1605\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1518A. LWD data was collected fro m 0 to 117.8 mbsf. The ship began waiting on weather and was offse t $20\;\mathrm{m}$ southeast of Hole U1518A.  

# Hole U1518B  

At $1310\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 December 2017, an attempt was made to begi n Hole U1518B; however, sea conditions were still too rough and prevented the start of the hole. After an additional $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ of waiting o n weather, Hole U1518B successfully began at $1600~\mathrm{h}$ . In total, $21~\mathrm{~h~}$ was spent waiting on weather. LWD operations continued to 372. 7 mbsf. After logging a portion of the inferred thrust fault zone, th e tools were pulled up to 334.7 mbsf. Three pore pressure measurements were attempted using the StethoScope tool, and all failed t o provide formation pressure measurements. The tools were the n pulled up to 234.0 mbsf to try three additional StethoScope measurements, which were unsuccessful as well. The tools were lowere d back to the bottom of the hole, a mud sweep was used to clean th e hole, and the tools advanced to 372.7 mbsf. LWD continued to a total depth of 600 mbsf. After finishing the hole, a 30-barrel mu d sweep was used to clean out the hole. The LWD tools and dril l string were pulled out of the hole with the bit clearing the seafloo r at $1825\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 December. The ship was secured for transit at 025 7 h on 24 December, ending Site U1518. The seafloor depth for Hol e U1518B was 2634.6 mbsl based on the LWD logs.  

# Site U1519  

The ship arrived at Site U1519 at $0530~\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}\,+\,13\ \mathrm{h})$ on 2 4 December 2017 after a $15.4\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1518. The LW D BHA was assembled and contained the geoVISION, NeoScope, StethoScope, TeleScope, SonicScope, and proVISION tools. Th e LWD tools and drill string were deployed to $952\;\mathrm{mbsl},$ , and the tool s were tested before starting the hole. Hole U1519A began at $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 December and continued to 26 December. LWD safety monitoring proceeded during all LWD operations. After logging to 65 0 mbsf, a 30-barrel mud sweep was used to clean the hole. The LW D tools and drill string were pulled out of the hole and the bit cleare d the seafloor at $0425\,\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table at $0855\,\mathrm{h}$ . The ship bega n the transit to Site U1520 at $0910~\mathrm{h}$ on 26 December, ending Sit e U1519. The seafloor depth for Hole U1519A was 1000.7 mbsl base d on the LWD logs.  

# Site U1520  

Site U1520 consisted of two LWD holes that were drilled to 97. 9 and 750 mbsf (Table T1). The total time spent at Site U1520 was 2. 9 days, with $45.75\,\mathrm{~h~}$ of that time waiting on weather. LWD safet y monitoring was employed while operating in both holes.  

# Hole U1520A  

The vessel arrived at Site U1520 at $1302\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ on 2 6 December 2017. The $210.30~\mathrm{m}$ long LWD BHA was assembled, including the geoVISION, NeoScope, StethoScope, TeleScope, SonicScope, and proVISION tools. The BHA was deployed to $390~\mathrm{mbsl}$ and flow tested to determine the appropriate flow rates. The proVISION tool was not sending real-time data, and the drill string wa s recovered so that the spare proVISION tool could be deployed. Th e tools and drill string were set at $390~\mathrm{{mbsl}}$ for a second LWD too l test. Again, the proVISION tool failed to send real-time information. The tool string was deployed to the seafloor $(3527.4\,\mathrm{mbsl})$ ), an d Hole U1520A began at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 December. The proVISION began sending real-time data once the tool was turned on. Th e weather and sea conditions began to deteriorate, and the drill strin g had to be pulled out of Hole U1520A after reaching 97.9 mbsf. Hol e U1520A ended when the bit cleared the seafloor at $1410~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 7 December. Based on the LWD data, the seafloor depth for Hol e U1520A was 3521.3 mbsl.  

# Hole U1520B  

The vessel waited on the weather to clear for $45.75\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.91 days) . During this time, the ship was offset $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ northwest of Hol e U1520A at a bearing of $300^{\circ}$ . Hole U1520B began at $1245~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 9 December. The seafloor depth was 3520.1 mbsl based on the LW D data. The hole was washed down to $80~\mathrm{mbsf},$ and LWD measurements were taken from 80 to 750 mbsf. After reaching the total depth of 750 mbsf at $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 December, the hole was cleane d with a 30-barrel mud sweep and the drill string was pulled out of th e hole. The bit cleared the seafloor at $0715~\mathrm{h}$ and the rotary table a t $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ . The LWD tools were broken down, and the vessel began th e $32\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1517 at $1954\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Site U1520.  

# Transit to Lyttelton  

The $404\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Lyttelton, New Zealand began at $1536\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+13\,h)}$ ) on 2 January 2018 after completing operations in Hol e U1517D.  

The vessel reached the pilot station at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 January 2018 , and Expedition 372 ended with the first line ashore at $0706~\mathrm{h}$ i n Lyttelton, New Zealand.  

# Education and outreach  

Expedition 372 had two Education and Outreach Officers fro m the United States and New Zealand who communicated the scientific operations and objectives with audiences of all ages around th e world. The educators conducted a series of live ship-to-shor e broadcasts with classrooms, meetings, offices, workshops, and families throughout the duration of the expedition. Additionally, th e Outreach Officers produced online content highlighting aspects o f ship life; ship operations; science goals; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) career paths; and other career s at sea in the form of blog posts, YouTube videos, and social medi a content (Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram).  

# Webcasts  

Using iPads and the Zoom video conferencing software, the Education and Outreach Team conducted 35 live broadcasts wit h shore-based groups that lasted 30–70 min. During these broadcasts, the educators provided an introduction to the JOIDES Resolution and Expedition 372 science objectives; presented a tour of the forecastle, core, and bridge decks; and arranged for the students to as k questions of JOIDES Resolution technicians and expedition scientists. Over the course of the expedition, these live broadcast s reached a total of approximately 1460 people in 6 countries. Audiences included school-aged children from Years 2 $(\mathbf{a}\mathbf{g}\mathbf{e_{\mathrm{~}}}=\ 6{-}7)$ ) through 13 $\mathbf{\dot{a}g e}=17{-}18)$ ), university classes, and public events wit h groups of scientists and the general public.  

In advance of broadcasts with classrooms, the Outreach Officers provided the teachers with educational materials about the JOIDES Resolution and Expedition 372. The officers also coordinate d with the teachers regarding broadcast content to ensure it fit withi n the educational content and goals for each classroom. Topics included ocean-related and sea-going careers, STEM careers, expedition objectives and science, basic marine geology concepts, sitespecific tectonics and geology, natural hazards, and expedition motivations and impacts. After the broadcasts, the Education and Outreach Team received numerous thank you emails and social medi a posts (through Twitter and Facebook).  

Because Expedition 372 spanned major world holidays, the Outreach Officers hosted a series of broadcasts geared toward friend s and family members of shipboard technicians, crew, and scienc e party members. Through these broadcasts, expedition participant s had the opportunity to show their friends and family around th e ship and talk about the science objectives and shift duties. Additionally, the Outreach Officers helped facilitate live broadcasts for science  party  members  with  the  media  and  with  professiona l workshops.  

# Social media  

The Education and Outreach Team maintained an expeditio n blog (http://joidesresolution.org/expedition/372), Facebook pag e (@joidesresolution),  Twitter  feed $\left(\varpi\mathrm{The}\right)\mathrm{R})$ ,  YouTube  channe l (https://www.youtube.com/user/theJOIDESResolution), and Instagram account $@]$ JOIDES_resolution) throughout the expeditio n to communicate events and activities occurring on the JOIDES Resolution on a daily basis. The Outreach Officers produced a total o f 45 blog posts, including 3 guest blogs written by science party members. Through the JOIDES Resolution Facebook account, the Outreach Officer created over 60 posts, and the number of follower s increased by $1\%{-}2\%$ during the expedition. A total of 52 Expeditio n 372 Twitter posts and retweets were made with an average of approximately 1,550 impressions, 66 engagements, 4 retweets, and 1 3 likes per tweet. Furthermore, approximately 80 new Twitter followers were added. A total of 24 videos were uploaded to the JOIDE S Resolution YouTube channel and were cross-promoted across othe r social media platforms. A total of 15 posts were also made on th e JOIDES Resolution Instagram account, garnering dozens of new followers.  

and 375 web pages. Though geared toward secondary school students, the material from these modules will be easily adaptable t o most any age group.  

Another postexpedition project is a publication to be submitte d to the peer-reviewed Journal of Science Education and Technology. This paper will focus on case examples of telepresence and “ship-toshore” programs, including the education and outreach programs o f the JOIDES Resolution, E/V Nautilus, and NOAA’s Okeanos Explorer. Specific details on the content are still being determined, bu t the article will generally focus on discussing the ship-to-shore an d telepresence aspects of the programs, as well as the types of education and outreach work being done and their impacts on promotin g STEM fields.  

An ocean-related “career map” will be created to illustrate th e many different potential career options in which someone can wor k with the ocean and/or have a sea-going career. The goal in creatin g this career map is to help people better understand the many different ocean-related career options that exist and to provide information on how they can achieve those careers. It is intended to be use d by students or others to learn about different potential career options and the education and training they will need to achieve tha t career. This career map will include information from and tie together the blogs, interviews, and other activities that occurred whil e at sea during Expedition 372, which will also be incorporated int o the final product.  

A presentation is also planned for a session at the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2018 in February 2018 in Portland, Oregon. Thi s meeting is sponsored by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, American Geophysical Union, and Th e Oceanography Society and will feature a wide range of attendee s from academia, industry, research institutions, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and education and outreac h programs.  

# Media  

The Education and Outreach Officers helped facilitate communication between science party members and various media outlets. This effort included helping to set up interviews for print media i n Ireland and New Zealand, audio interviews for a Futureproof podcast in Ireland, and a video creation for the Irish Times. An event fo r the New Zealand media was also held on the final day of the expedition at the Lyttelton, New Zealand, port call. The Co-Chief Scientists summarized the preliminary results from the expedition, media interviews were conducted, and members of the media wer e given tours of the ship.  

# Postexpedition projects  

Both Outreach Officers will continue their educational activitie s on shore with several planned projects. One project involves producing a mini online course for teachers and students with fiv e modules related to the Expedition 372 and 375 scientific objectives. The modules will focus on New Zealand tectonics, marine geology, and geomorphology and cover the following topics: plate tectonic s with a New Zealand focus, subduction zone dynamics, submarin e landslides and tsunami hazards, gas hydrates, and SSEs/shallow seafloor structure. These models are being created in consultation wit h the Expedition 375 New Zealand Outreach Officer and will be use d as post-Expedition 372 and pre-Expedition 375 resources. Thes e modules will be hosted on the JOIDES Resolution website under th e “For Educators” page and will be linked to both the Expedition 37 2
