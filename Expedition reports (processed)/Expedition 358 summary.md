# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 358 was carried out from October 2018 through March 2019 on the D/V Chikyu in an attempt to reach a plate boundary fault zone at seismogenic depths for the first time in scientific ocean drilling. The goal was to extend Hole C0002P from ${\sim}2900$ to ${\sim}5200$ meters below seafloor (mbsf) and cross the seismically interpreted main décollement fault zone with logging while drilling, downhole stress measurements, cuttings sampling, mud gas sampling, and partial coring by drilling a sidetrack to create a new hole (C0002Q). Although drilling reached $3262.5~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , the deepest to date in all of scientific ocean drilling, the effort to drill to and sample the target—the megathrust fault zone—was not successful. Operational challenges in establishing sidetrack holes and advancing them at reasonable rates of penetration limited the new cased hole interval to less than $60\;\mathrm{m}$ total at a depth shallower than the previously established casing depth of 2922 mbsf. Combined, the cuttings, logs, and ${\sim}60~\mathrm{cm}$ of recovered core from sidetrack Holes C0002Q–C0002T revealed hemipelagic sediments and fine silty turbidites consistent in lithology and physical properties with those recovered in the same depth interval at the same site during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 348. Cuttings revealed evidence of only weakly deformed rock, with relatively common calcite veins but few other structural indicators.  

Because no downhole leak-off tests were made and very little borehole imaging was performed, no further insight into the tectonic context was acquired.  

After riser drilling at Site C0002 was terminated, drilling at alternate contingency Sites C0024 and C0025 was carried out. Site C0024 targeted the frontal thrust region to sample and log hanging wall rocks and the shallow portion of the décollement zone, and Site C0025 accessed sediments in the Kumano fore-arc basin. At Site C0024, a dedicated logging hole was drilled and a very complete suite of logs were acquired from 0 to 869 mbsf. Preliminary interpretation of log response and images suggests the frontal thrust zone was encountered from about 813 mbsf to the base of the hole, with a zone of notably low resistivity and steep bedding from 850 mbsf to the bottom of the hole. Core samples revealed lithologic units interpreted to be hemipelagic and turbiditic basin fill, trench fill, and Shikoku Basin sediments and encountered deformation potentially associated with a back thrust imaged in seismic reflection data. However, coring had to be terminated at about 620 mbsf, well short of the frontal thrust zone. Site C0025 recovered fore-arc basin sediments underlain by those interpreted to have been deposited in a trench-slope basin setting; no clear transition into older, inner accretionary wedge material was identified during the preliminary analysis. Coring from 400 to 571 mbsf yielded datable material and possible evidence for diapiric intrusion of sediments.  

# Introduction and background  

The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) program is a coordinated, multiexpedition drilling projec t designed to investigate fault mechanics and seismogenesis along th e Nankai subduction megathrust (Figure F1) through direct sampling, in situ measurements, and long-term monitoring in conjunction with allied laboratory and numerical modeling studies (Tobi n and Kinoshita, 2006; Tobin et al., 2015a, 2019). The fundamenta l scientific objectives of the NanTroSEIZE project include characterizing the nature of fault slip and strain accumulation, fault and wal l

rock composition, fault architecture, and state variables throughou t the active plate boundary system. Eleven previous expeditions hav e established a transect of sites from the incoming (subducting) plat e through fault zone and accretionary wedge characterization an d into the central fore-arc basin (Figure F2). For reviews of many o f the principal results from these sites, see Underwood and Moor e (2012), Ujiie and Kimura (2014), and Tobin et al. (2015b, 2019).  

Site C0002 is located in the Kumano fore-arc basin above th e seismogenic, partially locked portion of the plate boundary thrus t system (Figures F1, F2, F3). The Kumano Basin sedimentary sequence and uppermost part of the accretionary prism were drilled, logged, and sampled during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 314 (logging while drilling [LWD] to 1401.5 meters belo w seafloor [mbsf]), 315 (coring to 1057 mbsf), 338 (LWD to 2005 mbs f and coring to 1120 mbsf), and 348 (LWD to 3058.5 mbsf, with limited coring from 2163 to 2218.5 mbsf) (Expedition 314 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009; Strasser et al., 2014; Tobin e t al., 2015b).

The principal goal of International Ocean Discovery Progra m (IODP) Expedition 358 was to reach and sample the reflector identified as the likely plate boundary fault at Site C0002 by extendin g the riser borehole (Hole C0002P) established during previous Integrated Ocean Drilling Program NanTroSEIZE expeditions (Figur e F3). This drilling target is also in close proximity to the location o f very low frequency (VLF) earthquakes and the first tectonic tremo r recorded in any accretionary prism setting (summarized in Obar a and Kato, 2016), all of which suggest that fault processes related t o the updip limit of megathrust seismogenic mechanics are activ e here. Recent results from the NanTroSEIZE long-term borehol e monitoring systems and Dense Oceanfloor Network System fo r Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) seafloor observations furthe r suggest that the plate boundary at this location is partially locke d and partially releasing plate convergence strain in these slow sli p events accompanied by low-frequency tectonic tremor and VL F earthquakes (Araki et al., 2017).  

A detailed drilling plan was developed by the Center for Dee p Earth Exploration after careful analyses of the Expedition 338 an d

348 drilling experiences (Figure F4). It involved sidetracking fro m near the bottom of the Hole C0002P casing pipe at 2880 mbsf t o begin Hole C0002Q and then advancing in three casing stages, alternately drilling and then cementing in successive casing strings t o reach the zone just ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ above the anticipated plate boundar y fault zone. A comprehensive suite of LWD measurements wer e planned, along with detailed cuttings analysis, to monitor progres s and characterize the lower accretionary wedge/hanging wall of th e fault zone. The final stage of operations was planned to drill acros s the high-amplitude seismic reflector identified as the main plat e boundary fault zone with LWD and then drill an open hole sidetrack for a second pass to core $100{-}200\,\mathrm{m}$ in total from the hangin g wall across the fault and into the footwall (Figure F4).  

For the ${\sim}2000\,\mathrm{~m~}$ interval of planned drilling above the targe t zone, the primary scientific objectives were to (1) determine th e composition, stratigraphy, and deformational history of the Miocene accretionary wedge; (2) reconstruct its thermal, diagenetic, and metamorphic history; (3) determine horizontal stress orientations and magnitudes; and (4) investigate the mechanical and hydrological properties of the upper plate of the seismogenic plat e boundary. In the target zone, comprehensive structural, lithologic/petrologic, and physical property characterization of the faul t zone and wall rocks was planned using cuttings, logging, and continuous core sampling. The final objective was to leave the borehol e in a condition that would allow for design and deployment of a longterm in situ borehole observatory system subsequent to the expedition.  

Previous major riser drilling efforts during Expeditions 338 an d 348 advanced the main riser hole at Site C0002 (Holes C0002F, C0002N, and C0002P) to 3058.5 mbsf, and casing was installed i n that hole to 2922.5 mbsf (Figures F3, F4A). Extensive downhole logging data, continuously sampled drill cuttings, and limited interval s of core were collected during those expeditions.

Summary of planned Site C0002 riser operations for Expeditio n 358:  

• Employ the riser drilling technique, kick off from at or above the existing $11\%$ inch casing shoe at 2922.5 mbsf and open a new hole to ${\sim}5200$ mbsf or the maximum achievable depth within time and budget limits, setting $9\%$ inch (expanded to $11\%$ inch) casing, $9\%$ inch steel liner, and $7\%$ inch (expanded to $9\%$ inch) casing to ${\sim}4700$ mbsf and open hole drilling with an $8\%$ inch diameter bit below that to total depth (TD).   
• Use a suite of LWD/measurement-while-drilling tools and measurements to include gamma ray, sonic, and resistivity logs and images. Analyze lithology, physical properties, and geochemistry of cuttings from the entire drilled interval at a suitable spacing (nominally every $10\;\mathrm{m}$ ).   
• At casing set points and other opportunities, conduct downhole tests—formation integrity test, extended leak-off tests (XLOTs), leak-off tests (LOTs), and other formation tests—to evaluate in situ stress, pore fluid pressure, permeability, and rock strength conditions.   
• Core about $100\,\mathrm{m}$ : ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ from 4650 mbsf and ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ from 5150 mbsf or at a depth selected as we penetrate the fault zone.  

sidetracks and advancing the boreholes plagued the operation fro m the outset and continuously as a series of mitigation strategies wer e attempted (Figures F4C, F5). A more complete history of the operations appears below (Tables T1, T2). In summary, riser drilling i n Hole C0002Q advanced only to 3262.5 mbsf ( $204\mathrm{~m~}$ deeper tha n Hole C0002P) before it had to be abandoned. Cuttings were obtained from this hole, but only a very basic LWD data set was acquired, including gamma ray and a resistivity log, rather than th e full planned suite that was to include resistivity imaging logs an d sonic and check shot seismic data. A second sidetrack was established at 2790 mbsf, and Hole C0002R advanced to 3085 mbsf (Figure F5), again with only cuttings and basic logs acquired. Hol e C0002S was sidetracked and met a fate similar to that of Hol e C0002R, ending at 2933 mbsf. The final sidetrack Hole C0002T wa s made, and three cores with minimal recovery were collected fro m 2836.5 to 2848.5 mbsf before riser operations came to an end.  

Unfortunately, these technical setbacks resulted in only ver y modest scientific achievements at Site C0002. New cores were obtained ${\sim}600\;\mathrm{m}$ deeper than any previous cores from Expedition 34 8 and before. Cuttings and limited logs were obtained from ${\sim}204\,\mathrm{m}$ o f new drilling depth but came $2000\;\mathrm{m}$ short of the target. No downhole measurements related to in situ stress conditions were obtained.  

Scientific results from cuttings, logs, mud gas monitoring, an d cores of sidetrack Holes C0002Q–C0002T are reported in this section (Figure F6A).  

# Lithology  

We analyzed cuttings from four overlapping holes (Hole s C0002Q–C0002T) and three cores from Hole C0002T. The combined depth interval for those samples extends from 2812.5 t o 3257.5 mbsf. We found four rock types with gradational lithologi c attributes. Fine silty claystone is light gray to gray in color. Its poorl y

consolidated cuttings are typically rounded and sticky. Silty claystone is gray to olive-black and more lithified, and its cuttings ar e angular and fissile. Siltstone shows a higher degree of lithification, and its cuttings are angular. There are two varieties of sandstone: (1) gray, very fine grained, and angular and (2) light gray, fin e grained, less consolidated, and more rounded. Silty claystone is th e dominant lithology in Holes C0002Q–C0002T, composing $35\%-$ $80\%$ of the total cuttings (Figure F6A). All other lithologies are subordinate, and fine silty claystone decreases to minor amounts. Collectively, all sedimentary rocks correlate with Lithologic Unit V a s defined during Expedition 348 (Figure F6B; Tobin et al., 2015b).  

$\mathrm{\DeltaX}$ -ray diffraction (XRD) shows that clay minerals (smectite $^+$ illite $^+$ chlorite $^+$ kaolinite) are the most abundant mineral constituent, with normalized percentages of ${\sim}40{-}55\,\mathrm{\wt\%}$ (Figure F6A) . Proportions change somewhat with grain size; values for quartz an d feldspar are about $5{-}10~\mathrm{wt}\%$ larger in handpicked sandstone an d siltstone samples, and abundances of total clay minerals in coarse r lithologies are smaller by about $10{-}20\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Calcite is usually belo w the detection limit by XRD $(<\!1\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ). When compared to bulk cuttings at corresponding depths from Hole C0002P, we notice a systematic shift toward modestly higher proportions of quartz an d feldspar. Those variations in bulk mineralogy are probably a reflection of natural heterogeneity in a steeply dipping succession o f interbedded silty claystone, siltstone, and fine sandstone. Overall, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) results exhibit no significant depth-dependent trends in bulk sediment geochemistry except for a sligh t increase in $\mathrm{MgO}$ with depth. The chemical uniformity within an d among the individual holes is consistent with relatively homogeneous proportions of rock types.  

The depth interval assigned to Lithologic Subunit VB in Hol e C0002P is characterized by abundant fine silty claystone and rar e sandstone (Tobin et al., 2015b). The facies was interpreted to be  a hemipelagic depositional environment punctuated by sporadic finegrained turbidity currents (Tobin et al., 2015b). The same depth interval in Holes C0002Q–C0002T appears to contain more fin e sandstone and siltstone. These deposits are likewise consistent wit h mostly hemipelagic deposition but contain modestly higher occurrences of silt and fine-sand turbidity currents. The environment o f deposition is therefore likely to have been a trench or an abyssal plain seaward of the trench.

# Structural geology  

Very few identified deformation-related features $(\!\!\!\!\!-1\%\!\!\!\!)$ of tota l cuttings exhibit them) occur between 2827.5 and 3262.5 mbsf. Granular and dogtooth calcite veins occur throughout the interval; slickenlines and stepped striae are rare. No scaly fabrics, mino r faults, or cataclastic bands were recovered in cuttings from Hole s C0002Q–C0002T. The low abundance of deformation structure s suggests that the sections of Holes C0002Q–C0002T betwee n 2827.5 and 3262.5 mbsf are weakly deformed.  

Mineral veins record different modes and phases of vein formation; crack-seal veins document repeated episodes of extensiona l fracturing potentially driven by fluctuations in pore fluid pressur e or prevailing stress state. Extensional fracturing can be followed b y shear deformation as recorded by shear veins and/or slickenline s partially overprinting crack-seal veins and vice versa.  

# Geochemistry  

At Site C0002, mud gas was analyzed from Holes C0002Q– C0002T and compared to earlier drilling in Hole C0002P during Expedition 348 (Tobin et al., 2015b). In addition, cuttings and core s were analyzed for headspace gas content and $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ total organi c carbon, and total nitrogen. Mud gas composition reveals trend s similar to the shallower riser drilling during Expedition 348, wit h decreasing $\mathrm{CH_{4}}$ and $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios downhole, whereas the $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C-CH_{4}}$ values remain largely between about $-50\%_{00}$ and about $-40\%_{\mathrm{{2}}}$ , characteristic of thermogenic gas. Spikes toward higher methane concentrations at ${\sim}2950$ , ${\sim}3050$ , and $\mathord{\sim}3200$ mbsf are accompanied b y elevated $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $^{222}\mathrm{{Rn}}$ in the mud gas. In contrast, no such elevate d concentrations were found in these depth intervals when analyzin g the cuttings. All hydrocarbons as well as CO decrease with depth, and $_n$ -butane and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ are particularly low from ${\sim}3050$ mbsf downhole. We suspect that the spikes in real-time mud gas monitorin g reflect fluid migration in minor fault zones that would likely not b e evident when analyzing cuttings.  

# Biostratigraphy and paleomagnetism  

Preliminary  age  determination  for  cuttings  from  Hole s C0002Q–C0002T is based exclusively on the examination of calcareous nannofossils. The abundance and preservation of calcareou s nannofossils varies throughout the sequence. Different states o f abundance and preservation are recognized even in different piece s from the same cuttings sample. Nannofossil assemblages from th e four holes all contain Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus $(\ge\!7\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , except for a single piece from Slide C of Sample 358-C0002Q-365- SMW (3022.5–3027.5 mbsf). R. pseudoumbilicus $(\ge\!7\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ has a n age range of 12.8–3.63 Ma with an absence interval of $8.8{-}7.09\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . R. pseudoumbilicus together with the presence of Discoaster prepentaradiatus (Zones NN9–NN10A; ${\sim}10.5{-}8.3\ \mathrm{Ma}_{}^{}$ ) in some samples from the four holes (2847.5–3257.5 mbsf) are likely assigned a n age of 10.5–8.8 Ma. An assemblage from Slide C of Sample 365- SMW (3022.5–3027.5 mbsf) that lacks R. pseudoumbilicus $(\ge\!7\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ is indicative of an age of $8.8{-}7.09\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Radiolarians  and  foraminifers  were  also  found  in  Hole s C0002Q–C0002S but were not used for age determination becaus e of very rare occurrences. All radiolarians are possibly reworked.  

Remanent magnetizations of archive-half sections from Hol e C0002T were measured but did not yield useful results regardin g magnetic polarity because of poor core quality and recovery.  

# Physical properties  

In Holes C0002Q–C0002T, physical property measurement s were conducted mostly on cuttings samples augmented by a fe w core samples from Hole C0002T. Moisture and density (MAD) measurements show that porosity of handpicked intact cuttings decreases from about $19\%$ at 2800 mbsf to about $17\%$ at $3250~\mathrm{mbsf}$ (Figure F6A), which is in good agreement with the trend found fo r Hole C0002P during Expedition 348 (Figure F6B). The porosity fo r bulk cuttings from Hole C0002Q was $10\%{-}20\%$ higher than that o f intact cuttings at depths overlapping Hole C0002P, which is agai n consistent with results from Hole C0002P, but the difference became smaller, or nonexistent, toward the deeper section of Hol e C0002Q and in the remaining Holes C0002R–C0002T. The therma l conductivity measured on a core sample from Hole C0002T follow s the trend suggested from previous expeditions.  

# Logging  

In Hole C0002Q (logging interval $=2888–3262\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ , phase resistivity remains almost uniform over most of the logged interva l and ranges between 2 and $3\,\Omega\mathrm{m}$ (Figure F6A). Gamma ray i s slightly more variable, suggesting a mostly uniform lithology wit h short excursions to lower values that could indicate fine sandy intervals or other minor lithologies. These logging responses fit the characteristics of Logging Subunit Ve identified in the deeper section o f  

Hole C0002P (Tobin et al., 2015b), suggesting that the entire logge d interval belongs to the same subunit.  

In Hole C0002Q at 2907–2916 mbsf, borehole failures are observed in a northwest–southeast orientation. The southeastern conductive zone has a larger width $(\sim\!93^{\circ})$ than the northwestern zon e $(\sim\!61^{\circ})$ . Because the southeast and northwest azimuths are approximately equivalent to the upper and lower sides of the deviated borehole, respectively, the wider low resistivity zone in the southeas t orientation, or at the top of the hole, indicates that the tool was separated from the upper side of the borehole. In contrast, the narrower low resistivity zone on the northwest, or bottom, side of th e hole indicates that the tool was largely in contact with the botto m side of the borehole. Therefore, the narrower low resistivity zone i n the northwest is considered to reflect the actual occurrence of th e borehole failure.  

# Site C0024  

With 28 days remaining in the expedition after the terminatio n of riser operations at Site C0002, drilling was conducted at two alternate contingency sites (Tables T1, T2). Site C0024 is located  a few kilometers landward (northwest) of Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Site C0006 in the frontal anticline overlying the frontal thrust (Figure F7). It targeted the hanging wall geology and th e main frontal thrust at ${\sim}820$ mbsf. An LWD hole was drilled into an d penetrated the frontal thrust, which is interpreted to be a comple x zone of fault strands and imbrication of thrust slices. Coring was attempted in the zone below 500 mbsf, as well as in several shallowe r intervals, but had to be abandoned because of deteriorating borehole conditions before reaching the main fault zone as identified i n log and seismic data. Results from all holes at Site C0024 are summarized in this section (Figure F8).  

# Lithology  

The stratigraphic section at Site C0024 is divided into four lithologic units (Figure F8A). Lithologic Unit I is composed of silty cla y

to clayey silt. We set the base of Unit I at the top of the uppermos t turbidite in Hole C0024B at 3.76 mbsf. No age-diagnostic nannofossils were identified in this interval, so the Holocene age is onl y inferred. The base of Unit I is a prominent unconformity.  

Most of Lithologic Unit II is composed of four lithologies in  a continuum of gradational attributes: silty clay to clayey silt, fine t o coarse silt, sandy silt to silty sand, and very fine to coarse sand. Scattered beds of volcanic ash are also present. The sand- and silt-ric h beds typically display normal size grading, and most such beds ar e thin $\langle{<}5\ \mathrm{cm}\rangle$ . We recorded 1112 event beds, including 30 layers o f volcanic ash and 1081 inferred turbidites. A coarsening-upwar d trend is evident from ${\sim}320$ to 230 mbsf, and a prominent cluster o f thick to very thick beds occurs between ${\sim}270$ and $230\ {\mathrm{mbsf}}.$ Th e trend fines upward from ${\sim}230$ to 58 mbsf and coarsens upwar d from ${\sim}40$ mbsf to the seafloor. The overall facies character is consistent with a trench-wedge environment punctuated by frequent influxes by turbidity currents. Most of the accretionary prism at Sit e C0024 is represented by Lithologic Unit II. Although Unit II yield s calcareous nannofossils suggesting an age of $1.34{-}1.67\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in th e Matuyama Chron of reversed magnetic polarity, paleomagneti c data indicate dominantly normal magnetic polarity in this unit. Further chronological information is necessary to resolve this inconsistency.  

The Lithologic Unit II/III boundary appears to be conformabl e and is defined by a paucity of sand beds below. Nannofossils date d as 2.06–2.45 Ma reveal no contrast in age across the unit boundary. The dominant lithology in Unit III is silty claystone to clayey siltstone. Minor lithologies include very fine sandstone, siltstone, an d volcanic ash or tuff. The mud deposits originated from sustaine d hemipelagic settling in an outer trench-wedge setting. Silt bed s were deposited from entrained layers of turbidity currents tha t lapped onto or spilled over the seaward slope of the trench.  

The Lithologic Unit III/IV boundary appears to be conformabl e and is defined by the last occurrence (moving downsection) o f trench-related silty turbidites. Nannofossils reveal no change in ag e $\!2.06{-}2.45\ \mathrm{Ma})$ across the unit boundary. The boundary’s positio n at 555 mbsf matches the top of an anomalous trend in porosity values and the top of a well-defined trend in XRD mineralogy, belo w which total clay minerals increase with depth (Figure F8A). Th e dominant lithology is bioturbated silty claystone to clayey siltstone; we also recovered six thin beds of light gray poorly lithified tuff. Sedimentation was dominated by slow hemipelagic settling in a n environment that was isolated from sediment gravity flows. Thes e environmental conditions are commonplace across the Shikoku Basin.  

# Structural geology  

Bedding dips vary $0^{\circ}{-30^{\circ}}$ (38–316 and 510–618.9 mbsf) and ar e slightly steeper in the shallowest part $(\mathrm{\sim}10^{\circ}{-}37^{\circ}$ at $0{-}38\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ . Steep minor normal faults dipping toward the southwest and northeast are common at $0{-}38\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , whereas the dip direction shifts toward the northwest and southeast below 100 mbsf. Deformatio n bands are generally dipping to the northwest or southeast, an d healed faults and sediment-filled vein structures are commonly observed at 510–618.9 mbsf. A brecciated zone and a shear zone potentially corresponding to a back thrust that was imaged in th e seismic reflection sections (Figure F7) were recovered at 243.5–24 7 and 295 mbsf, respectively.

# Geochemistry  

At Site C0024, the chlorinity profile displays two different trend s separated by the gap in coring (Figure F8A). In the upper $300\,\mathrm{m}_{}$ , th e trend in interstitial water (IW) is from a chlorinity value similar t o bottom water to one that is $2.5\%$ less fresh at the base of this profil e segment. This behavior almost certainly reflects alteration to cla y minerals of reactive volcanic matter disseminated in the sediment. Below the coring gap, the trend is reversed so that a $4\%$ freshenin g occurs over a narrower depth interval from 500 to 620 mbsf. Th e lower chlorinity profile segment suggests connection at depth wit h a source of lower chloride water. Another tracer of the deep fluid i s the ratio of methane to higher hydrocarbons, the $\mathsf C_{1}/(\mathsf C_{2}+\mathsf C_{3})$ ratio. This ratio decreases with depth driven in part by an increase i n higher hydrocarbons (Figure F8A). Taken together, these tracer s suggest a fluid reservoir at depth sourced from a deeper portion o f the prism where clay mineral diagenesis releases freshened water s and thermogenic hydrocarbons are beginning to form. Unfortunately, samples from the décollement and below were not availabl e to characterize the deeper fluids.  

# Physical properties  

At Site C0024, physical property measurements were conducte d on core samples collected from 0 to 317.93 mbsf, 510 to 618.1 3 mbsf, and 652.04 mbsf. MAD measurements on discrete core samples show porosity decreases from about $55\%{-}75\%$ close to the seafloor to about $35\%$ at 550 mbsf (Figure F8A). A sharp increase i n porosity to $45\%{-}50\%$ at 550–577 mbsf corresponds to the boundar y between Lithologic Units III and IV, marking the transition into th e Shikoku Basin sediments underneath. A decrease in magnetic susceptibility from $5\,\times\,10^{-3}$ to $1.5\,\times\,10^{-4}$ SI measured by the multisensor core logger (MSCL) is also observed around this lithologi c boundary, which is consistent with the trend observed at Site C000 6 upon entering the upper Shikoku Basin sediments (Expedition 31 6 Scientists, 2009). $P$ -wave velocity and electrical resistivity measure d on discrete samples also show a gradual decrease in velocity and resistivity around the unit boundary, which is consistent with the increase  in  porosity  at  the  unit  boundary.  Measured  thermal conductivity values generally agree with those measured at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0006 and C0011 (Expeditio n 316 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 333 Scientists, 2012).  

# Logging  

Logging data for Site C0024 were acquired in Hole C0024A wit h a full bottom-hole assembly (MicroScope, arcVISION, TeleScope, SonicScope, and seismicVISION) in the interval from seafloor to  a depth of 869 mbsf (Figure F8B). Good data quality for most of th e logged interval allows definition of three logging units with distinc t characteristics. Resistivity, gamma ray, and $P$ -wave velocity increas e with depth in Logging Unit 1 $(0{-}538.6~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), and then resistivit y and $P$ -wave velocity show constant trends with some significan t negative spikes in Logging Unit 2 (538.6–851.7 mbsf). Logging Uni t 3 (851.7 mbsf to TD) is characterized by a significant decrease i n resistivity. Both button and propagation resistivity show a large separation of shallow and deep resistivities over this unit, which may b e affected by poor borehole conditions.  

Bedding planes and fractures can be identified on resistivity images. Bedding dips mainly toward the northwest–northeast with di p angles of ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ above 809 mbsf. Below 809 mbsf to TD, the overal l bedding dips sharply increase with a mean value around $40^{\circ}$ and  a maximum close to $90^{\circ}$ at 851 mbsf. Fractures exhibit various dip angles over the logged interval either to the north-northeast or th e north-northwest. At 813 mbsf, a pair of faults dipping $15^{\circ}$ and $20^{\circ}$ toward the north coincide with a further drop in gamma ray, resistivity, and $P$ -wave velocity values (Figure F9). In addition to th e above log response and image observation, a synthetic seismogra m using $P.$ -wave velocity and vertical seismic profile data indicates tha t the decrease in $P$ -wave velocity values at ${\sim}806$ to $\mathord{\sim}819$ mbsf likel y corresponds to the interpreted fault reflection in the seismic reflection volume. Our preliminary interpretation is that the onset of deformation at ${\sim}806$ to ${\sim}819$ mbsf marks the top of the plat e boundary fault zone. Borehole breakouts were also identified on th e resistivity images throughout the hole. The orientation of the breakouts is generally consistent at $070^{\circ}$ . Between 530 and 630 mbsf, w e observed a slight shift in breakout orientation to higher azimuths.  A shift in breakout orientation to an azimuth of $\mathrm{\sim}100^{\circ}$ is also apparen t at 810 mbsf.  

# Site C0025  

Site C0025, the second riserless contingency site drilled durin g Expedition 358, was chosen to address questions about the timin g of development of the Kumano fore-arc basin and the tectonic history of the inner accretionary wedge. The site is located where th e fore-arc basin sediments are underlain by a more deformed doma l or antiformal (based on seismic reflection interpretation; Figur e F10) formation that is hypothesized to represent either (1) early inner wedge thrust sheet material or (2) diapiric mud rising buoyantl y into place. Rotary core barrel (RCB) drilling was carried out afte r first washing down to 400 mbsf where coring commenced, with th e objective of dating and characterizing the lower fore-arc basin an d upper underlying wedge to discriminate between these hypothese s and elucidate the basin’s tectonic history. Nineteen RCB cores wer e collected to a TD of 580.5 mbsf, and results from this site are summarized in this section (Figure F11; Tables T1, T2).  

# Lithology  

We documented the lithologic character of 18 cores from Hol e C0025A and defined two lithologic units starting at 400 mbsf. Th e dominant lithology in Lithologic Unit I is mottled silty claystone t o clayey siltstone, which we interpret to be hemipelagic mud. Thi n interbeds (interpreted to be turbidites) are composed of medium t o fine sandstone, silty sandstone, sandy siltstone, and siltstone. Th e base of Unit I at 441.93 mbsf coincides with the deepest inferre d turbidite. The age range of nannofossil assemblages from Unit I i s consistent with early Pleistocene deposition. The deposition of Uni t I occurred during the initial stages of infilling of the Kumano forearc basin.  

Bioturbated silty claystone and clayey siltstone are also commo n in Lithologic Unit II but are distinguished by a diverse host of secondary attributes: scattered dark green clay-rich bands; concentra

Glauconite is distinctive as dispersed grains and in concentrated clusters. CaO (from XRF analysis) and calcite (from XRD ) values increase significantly in Unit II because of higher propor

Nannofossils fro m equal mixtures of fine sand-, silt-, and clay-sized particles (sand y Unit II span an age range of late Pliocene to early Pleistocene $\left(1.34-\right.$ mudstone to muddy sandstone).

# Structural geology  

The structural characteristics at Site C0025 are subhorizonta l bedding planes, incohesive normal faults and cohesive (healed ) faults, and sediment-filled vein structures. Inclined thick $:>\!1\ \mathrm{mm}$ ; sometimes ${>}10~\mathrm{cm}$ ) healed faults characterized by weak clay mineral orientation and densification are observed in the lower par t (Cores 358-C0025A-18R through 19R; 561.5–580.5 mbsf) (Figur e F12). Unique sediment-filled vein structures with arrays oriente d parallel to and sometimes continuous with the thick faults coexist.  

# Geochemistry  

An important characteristic of the IW at Site C0025 is freshening by $18\%{-35\%}$ as observed in the salinity and chlorinity profile s (Figure F11). The minimum chlorinity value is centered at 450. 3 mbsf, which coincides with the depth of the bottom-simulating reflector inferred to represent the base of the gas hydrate stabilit y zone, but low chlorinity extends to at least 572 mbsf. Most dissolve d ions at Site C0025 do not greatly vary in concentration with depth. An important exception is boron. Boron concentrations show  a broad maximum from 450.3 to 489.2 mbsf with values 2.5 times seawater. High boron coupled with freshened waters is a common signature of mud diapirs located along tectonic strike to the northeas t (Kopf et al., 2003). Planned shore-based boron isotope studies ma y distinguish between processes related to hydrate dissociation o r fluid flux from depth causing the observed chemical anomalies.

On X-ray CT images, cohesive healed faults are brighter than surrounding matrix and correspond t o higher CT number and density. Normal fault displaces array vein structure s (X-ray CT images). Sediment-filled vein structures are generally resolved o n X-ray CT images and occur as bright features filled with higher density material. Thinner sediment-filled vein structures by MSCL are not resolved by Xray CT.

ments on discrete core samples show an overall constant porosit y trend scattering between $38.5\%$ and $54.5\%$ (Figure F11). Interval s with sandier formations show relatively lower porosity between $40\%$ and $43\%,$ , and the occurrence at 544 mbsf coincides with the boundary between Lithologic Subunits IIA and IIB. Although penetrometer measurements indicate a marked increase in induration at abou t $465~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , only a slight decrease in porosity $(\sim\!3\%)$ occurs aroun d this depth. However, a pronounced spike in natural gamma ra y count measured by MSCL occurs at this depth because of the presence of glauconite-bearing clasts found in the core. Also, the vertical anisotropy in electrical resistivity (positive when more resistiv e in the horizontal direction) changes from overall positive to negative at this depth (465 mbsf). Magnetic susceptibility decreases rapidly from $4\times10^{-4}$ to $1\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{SI}$ between 442 and $450~\mathrm{mbsf},$ whic h corresponds to the Lithologic Unit I/II boundary. Measured thermal conductivity values are negatively correlated with porosity an d generally agree with those measured on the Kumano Basin sediments at Site C0002 (Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009; Strasser et al., 2014).  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 358 had extraordinarily ambitious scientific goals , representing many firsts in scientific ocean drilling: the first sampling and in situ measurements in a plate boundary fault zone a t seismogenic depths of more than $4\,\mathrm{km}$ to investigate and documen t the geology, physical and geochemical properties, and stress conditions of a plate boundary fault zone. Operationally, this require d drilling ${\sim}2200\mathrm{~m~}$ of new depth in an existing cased hole that ha d already reached ${\sim}2900~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , installing and cementing casing alon g the way, and collecting a suite of LWD logs, cuttings, downhol e pressure tests, and $100{-}200\,\mathrm{m}$ of core at selected intervals. Preparation for the potential challenges of geological and stress or flui d pressure conditions in the planned borehole was intense, with several years of planning including the drill well on paper (DWOP) exercise, the implementation of a real-time geomechanics (RTG ) team, and external consulting on the mud program and other parameters.  

Unfortunately, we were unable to even begin to address the primary scientific objectives because of the operational difficulties encountered continuously throughout the first 4 months of rise r drilling. The maximum depth achieved of 3262.5 mbsf is a new record depth for scientific ocean drilling, yet it represents only $10\%$ o f the planned advance. Even that $10\%$ is only a partial achievement, a s only cuttings and very basic logs (gamma ray and resistivity curves ) were acquired to this depth. No LOTs or other downhole measurements relevant to stress and pore fluid pressure were conducted because they were planned for locations just below installed an d cemented casing shoes that were not installed. Hole C0002T cores, similarly, are the deepest ever collected, which is an operational achievement; however, they were not taken from a prioritized targe t zone and yielded little to no new scientific insight. Because Sit e C0002 riser drilling was the only primary plan for the expedition, the near-complete lack of success in achieving any scientific objectives was a striking disappointment.  

Alternative contingency Sites C0024 and C0025 had specific scientific goals that were met with at least partial success. At Sit e C0024, the objective was to log and sample the frontal décollemen t zone (shallow plate boundary). The dedicated logging hole appear s to have intersected at least the upper fault boundary and as much a s $40\,\mathrm{m}$ of the fault zone was imaged and logged. It is not clear whethe r the base was reached or not. These logs add to a growing global dat a set of physical properties in active plate boundary fault systems. The high-resolution resistivity image log enabled analyses of borehole breakouts and orientations of planar structures in the plat e boundary fault zone and overlying frontal prism. In Holes C0024 E and C0024F, coring efforts to reach this zone failed, unfortunately, because of hole stability issues. However, sediments recording th e transition between Shikoku Basin and trench fill sediments wer e successfully recovered from Hole C0024E. Shallow sediments wer e recovered in cores from Holes C0024B–C0024D and C0024G. Th e tectonic evolution of the frontal thrust system and strain partitioning between the frontal thrust and splay fault will be elucidated b y stratigraphic analysis of these cores and logs, together with the results from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0006 an d C0007.  

At Site C0025, the principal scientific objectives were to obtai n age control on the onset of Kumano fore-arc basin filling and th e nature of the deformed zone beneath it, testing alternative hypotheses of its formation through tectonic thrust faulting processes o r mud diapirism. Coring from 400 to 571 mbsf yielded datable material and possible occurrence for diapiric intrusion of sediments, although there is no involvement of basement rocks. Geochemica l and other evidence suggests that older accreted material was no t reached in the drilled interval.  

In summary, this expedition enjoyed modest successes, mostl y during the riserless contingency operations, but unfortunately di d not achieve essentially any of the scientific objectives of the primar y deep riser drilling plan or really get into position to tackle those objectives. This was not a result of unanticipated geological condition s such as mistaken interpretation or encountering a highly challenging drilling target; rather, the scientific hypotheses were not teste d because the primary zone of interest was never reached for operational and engineering reasons.
