# 1. Introduction  

This chapter outlines the procedures and methods employed for coring and drilling operations a s well as in the various shipboard laboratories of the R/V JOIDES Resolution during Internationa l Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 396. The laboratory information applies only t o shipboard work described in the Expedition reports section of the Expedition 396 Proceedings o f the International Ocean Discovery Program volume that used the shipboard sample registry, imaging and analytical instruments, core description tools, and the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database. The shipboard workflow followed standard IODP procedures (a s previously described by, e.g., Huber et al., 2019; Sutherland et al., 2019; Wallace et al., 2019), wit h revisions and refinements as described in this chapter. Methods used by investigators for shorebased analyses of Expedition 396 data will be documented in separate publications.

This introductory section provides an overview of drilling and coring operations, core handling, curatorial conventions, depth scale terminology, and the sequence of shipboard analyses. Subsequent sections of this chapter document specific laboratory instruments and methods in detail.  

# 1.1. Operations  

The IODP Environmental Protection and Safety Panel (EPSP) approved the primary (9) and alternate (14) drilling sites for Expedition 396 described in the expedition Scientific Prospectus (Plank e et al., 2021). The proposed sites encompass a combination of Paleogene sedimentary and igneou s rock formations below some tens to a few hundreds of meters thick younger biogenic ooze–ric h and terrigenous sediments. The sites were located using primarily a very extensive database o f industry-standard 2-D and 3-D seismic reflection data (e.g., Zastrozhnov et al., 2020; Gernigon e t al., 2021). Subsequently, academic high-resolution 2-D, P-Cable 3-D, subbottom profiler, multibeam echo sounder, and seabed coring data were acquired across five of the primary sites i n August 2020 (Bünz et al., 2020; Lebedeva-Ivanova et al., 2021). The first hole of each site wa s drilled as close to the location set out in the prospectus as operationally possible. The location o f subsequent holes at the Modgunn, Mimir, and Skoll sites were optimized using high-resolution PCable and conventional 3-D seismic data constrained by the initial drilling results (up to $1772\;\mathrm{m}$ from the main location; e.g., Hole U1570B).  

For historical reasons, all Norwegian governmental and industry seismic and well data are specified using the ED50 datum, whereas IODP uses the WGS84 datum. Therefore, the origina l positions of all Expedition 396 were originally defined using the ED50 datum and later transformed to WGS84 (Planke et al., 2021). The difference in location of the sites between the tw o datums is about $230\;\mathrm{m}$ . Transformation from ED50 to WGS84 datum can be done using numerous software applications, including web-based solutions such as ToolOnline (https://toolonline.com/en/coordinate-converter.php).  

The shipboard GPS navigation system (WGS84 datum) was used to position the vessel at th e Expedition 396 sites. A SyQwest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloor depth during the approach to each site to confirm the seafloor depth once on site. Time t o depth conversion was done using the Echo-Sounding Correction Tables (Carter, 1980). Once th e vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters were lowered. Dynamic positioning control of th e vessel was constrained by navigational input from the GPS system (Figure F1). No seafloor positioning beacons were deployed during the expedition. The final hole position was calculated as th e mean position of at least 1000 GPS position fixes since the beginning of the time the hole wa s occupied. The ship’s position is better than $1\textrm{m}_{\phantom{}}$ , but the exact position of the hole is less wel l known because of the deviation of the pipe below the ship, which can vary depending on wate r currents, tides, and water depth; the hole position is thus known typically within $10\;\mathrm{m}$ accuracy.

Figure F1. IODP convention for naming sites, holes, cores, sections, and samples. Ship positioning while coring was primarily accomplished with only GPS data; seafloor beacons were only prepared and ready for deployment if needed.  

Drilling sites were numbered according to the series that began with the first site drilled by th e D/V Glomar Challenger in 1968. Starting with Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 301, the prefix $^{\ast}\mathrm{U}^{\prime\prime}$ designates sites occupied by JOIDES Resolution. When drilling multiple holes at  a site, hole locations are typically offset from each other by ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}$ . During Expedition 396, we offse t holes at an average of $115\;\mathrm{m},$ except for Site U1570, where holes were offset as far as $1772\;\mathrm{m}$ . Sit e U1570 was approved by EPSP as a $2\,\mathrm{km}$ long “ribbon” or transect west of Site U1569 with start an d end coordinates. This ribbon provided an alternate coring strategy to Site U1569, where dee p stratigraphic targets were outcropping at shallower subseafloor depths. A letter suffix distinguishes each hole drilled at the same site. The first hole drilled is assigned the site number modified by the suffix “A,” the second hole takes the site number and the suffix “B,” and so forth. Durin g Expedition 396, 21 holes were drilled at 10 sites (U1565–U1574; see Figure F4 in the Expeditio n 396 summary chapter [Planke et al., 2023a]).  

# 1.2. JOIDES Resolution standard coring systems  

The advanced piston corer (APC) and half-length APC (HLAPC) coring systems cut soft-sediment cores with minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems and are suitable for the upper portion of each hole (Figure F2). After the APC core barrel is lowered throug h the drill pipe and lands near the bit, the inside of the drill pipe is pressured up until one or tw o shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel the n advances into the formation at high speed and cuts a core with a diameter of $66~\mathrm{mm}$ (2.6 inches).  

![](images/bfa778e1ac5dae9604ed2f586e65e7386992b97fddc527bb33c7aa070b1fbab8.jpg)  
Figure F2. Coring systems used during Expedition 383 (see Graber et al., 2002). A. APC system. ID $=$ inside diameter, $\mathsf{O D}=$ outside diameter. (Continued on next two pages.)  

The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke,” from the pressure gauge on the rig floor. Th e depth limit of the APC system, often referred to as APC refusal, is indicated in two ways: (1) th e piston fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from the pump pressure reading) becaus e the formation is too hard, or (2) excessive force $^{\leftmoon}_{\rightmoon}60{,}000$ lb; ${\sim}267\,\mathrm{kN})$ ) is required to pull the cor e barrel out of the formation. When a full stroke is not achieved, typically additional attempts ar e made. The assumption is that the barrel penetrated the formation by the length of core recovere d (nominal recovery $=\sim\!100\%\`$ ), so the bit is advanced by that length before cutting the next core. Typically, nonmagnetic core barrels are used, and a downhole orientation tool is deployed, excep t when refusal appears imminent. Formation temperature measurements can be taken with th e advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool, embedded in the APC coring shoe, at specifie d intervals. These measurements can be used to obtain temperature gradients and heat flow estimates. During Expedition 396, formation temperature measurements were taken in Holes U1572 B and U1574C.  

The extended core barrel (XCB) rotary system has a small cutting shoe that extends below th e large rotary APC/XCB bit (Figure F2). The smaller bit can cut a semi-indurated core with les s torque and fluid circulation than the main bit, optimizing recovery. The XCB cutting shoe (bit ) extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediment but retracts into the main bit when har d formations are encountered. It cuts cores with a nominal diameter of $5.87\ \,\mathrm{cm}$ (2.312 inches), slightly less than the $6.6~\mathrm{cm}$ diameter of APC cores. XCB cores are often broken (torqued) int o “biscuits,” which are disc-shaped pieces a few to several centimeters long with remolded sedimen t (including some drilling slurry) interlayering the discs in a horizontal direction and packing th e space between the discs and the core liner in a vertical direction. This type of drilling disturbanc e may give the impression that the XCB cores have the same thickness $,66~\mathrm{mm})$ as the APC cores.  

![](images/7a95dc10e3f8ae8eb0c96782599602ab48b0fc40709c4780eb30c69d1c3d4ce3.jpg)  
Figure F2 (continued). B. XCB system. (Continued on next page.)  

Although both XCB and rotary core barrel (RCB) recovery (below) generally lead to drilling disturbance in similar sedimentary material, switching from an APC/XCB bottom-hole assembl y (BHA) to an RCB BHA requires a pipe trip.  

The RCB system is the most conventional rotary coring system and is suitable for lithified roc k material. During Expedition 396, it was the coring system of choice for most sites because th e depth objectives targeted semilithified and lithified material (claystone, siltstone, etc.) and basement, which were out of reach of the XCB system. Like the XCB system, the RCB system cuts  a core with a nominal diameter of 5.87 cm. RCB coring can be done with or without the core liner s used routinely with the APC/XCB soft-sediment systems. Coring without the liners is sometime s done when core pieces seem to get caught at the edge of the liner, leading to jamming and reduce d recovery. During Expedition 396, all RCB cores were drilled with a core liner in place.  

The BHA is the lowermost part of the drill string and is typically ${\sim}130{-}170\;\mathrm{m}$ long, depending o n the coring system used and total drill string length. A typical APC/XCB BHA consists of a drill bi t (outside diameter $=11$ inches), a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified to p sub, a modified head sub, a nonmagnetic drill collar (for APC/XCB coring), a number of 8 inc h $({\sim}20.32~\mathrm{cm})$ drill collars, a tapered drill collar, 6 joints (two stands) of $5\%$ inch $({\sim}13.97~\mathrm{cm})$ dril l pipe, and a crossover sub. A lockable flapper valve was used to collect downhole logs withou t dropping the bit when APC/XCB coring. A typical RCB BHA consists of a drill bit, a bit sub, a n outer core barrel, a top sub, a head sub, 8 joints of $8\%$ inch drill collars, a tapered drill collar,  2 joints of standard $5\%$ inch drill pipe, and a crossover sub to the regular 5 inch drill pipe.  

Cored intervals may not be contiguous if separated by intervals drilled but not cored. Durin g Expedition 396, we drilled ahead without coring using a center bit with the RCB system in fou r holes: $0{-}26\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1567B, $0{-}30\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1567C, $0{-}30\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1568B, and $0{-}300\;\mathrm{m}$ i n Hole U1573A. Drilling ahead was necessary during Expedition 396 to accelerate penetratio n because (1) an interval had already been cored in an adjacent hole and/or (2) the stratigraphicall y lower interval was of higher priority. Thus, these holes consist of a sequence of one drilled interva l or advancement followed by coring. Drilling advancements are numbered sequentially from th e top of the hole downward. Numbers assigned to physical cores correspond to advancements an d may not be consecutive.

# 1.3. Drilling disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed by the drilling process and contain extraneous materia l because of the coring and core handling process. In formations with loose granular layers (sand, ash, foraminiferal ooze, chert fragments, shell hash, etc.), granular material from intervals highe r in the hole may settle and accumulate in the bottom of the hole as a result of drilling circulatio n and be sampled with the next core. The uppermost $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ of each core must therefore b e examined critically for potential “fall-in.”  

Common coring-induced deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originall y horizontal bedding. Piston action may result in fluidization (“flow-in”) at the bottom of, or sometimes in, APC cores. Retrieval of unconsolidated (APC) cores from depth to the surface typicall y results to some degree in elastic rebound, and gas that is in solution at depth may become free an d drive core segments in the liner apart. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved fo r safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. Holes are drilled into the liner, which force s some sediment and gas out of the liner. As noted above, XCB coring typically results in biscuit s mixed with drilling slurry. RCB coring typically homogenizes unlithified core material and ofte n fractures lithified core material. During Expedition 396, the main drilling disturbance observe d was XCB coring-induced “biscuiting,” which was pervasive in some intervals at Sites U1567 an d U1568. Drilling disturbances are described in the Lithostratigraphy section of each site chapte r and are indicated on graphic core summary reports, also referred to as visual core description s (VCDs).  

# 1.4. Downhole measurements  

# 1.4.1. Formation temperature  

During APC coring operations in Holes U1572B and U1574C, the formation temperature wa s measured with an APCT-3 tool that replaces the normal coring shoe. Normally, these measurements were made while coring Hole A; however, Hole U1572A was cored with the RCB corin g system, and APCT-3 measurements could not be taken.  

# 1.4.2. Wireline logging  

During wireline logging operations, the logs are recorded with Schlumberger logging tools combined into tool strings, which are lowered into the hole after the completion of coring operations. All four tool strings were used during Expedition 396: the modified triple combination (tripl e combo), the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI), the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic, and th e Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI). The modified triple combo tool included the Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS), Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS), Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC-B), High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA), Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde (MSS-B), and Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI). These tools measur e gamma radiation, porosity, density, resistivity, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and $P.$ - and $S_{}$ -wav e velocity. Each tool string contains a telemetry cartridge for communicating through the wireline t o the Schlumberger multi-tasking acquisition and imaging system (MAXIS) on the ship.  

In preparation for logging, the boreholes were flushed of debris by circulating drilling fluid an d were at least partially filled with seawater-based logging gel (sepiolite mud mixed with seawate r and weighted with barite; density $=\sim\!1258\ \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{3})$ to help stabilize the borehole walls in section s where instability was expected from drilling and coring disturbance. To improve the performanc e of the UBI logging tool, the hole was cleaned with twice the hole volume with surface salt wate r after circulating the mud through the hole. The BHA was pulled up to ${\sim}80\;\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth belo w seafloor (DSF), where it protected the unstable upper part of the hole. The tool strings were the n lowered downhole on a seven-conductor wireline cable before being pulled up at a constant spee d of $550\;\mathrm{m/h}$ to provide continuous log measurements of several properties simultaneously. Furthe r details on the logging operations are described in Downhole measurements.  

# 1.5. Core and section handling  

# 1.5.1. Whole core handling  

All APC, XCB, and RCB cores recovered during Expedition 396 were extracted from the core barrel in plastic liners. These liners were carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on th e catwalk outside the core laboratory and cut into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections (Figure F3). The exact sectio n length was noted and entered into the database as “created length” using the Sample Master application. This number was used to calculate core recovery. Subsequent processing differed for sediment and igneous rock material.  

# 1.5.2. Sediment section handling  

Headspace samples were taken from selected section ends (typically one per core) using a syring e for immediate hydrocarbon analysis as part of the shipboard safety and pollution prevention program. Whole-round samples for interstitial water (IW) analysis were also taken immediately afte r the core was sectioned. Core catcher samples were taken for biostratigraphic analysis. When catwalk sampling was complete, liner caps (blue $=$ top, colorless $=$ bottom, and yellow $=$ top of  a whole-round sample removed from the section) were glued with acetone onto liner sections, an d sections were placed in core racks for analysis.  

![](images/dba87d5624fc0b99011768421e473f97bccb531fe74e9e9420cd91720d768a3b.jpg)

For sediment cores, the curated length was set equal to the created length and was updated ver y rarely (e.g., in cases of data entry errors or when section length kept expanding by more than ${\sim}2$ cm). Depth in hole calculations are based on the curated section length (see Depth calculations).  

After completion of whole-round section analyses, the sections were split lengthwise from botto m to top into working and archive halves. The softer cores were split with a wire, and harder core s were split with a diamond saw. Investigators should note that older material can be transporte d upward on the split face of a section during splitting.  

# 1.5.3. Rock piece handling  

At Sites U1565, U1566, and U1571–U1574, we performed “hard rock curation,” whereby pieces ar e separated with dividers and logged separately. Rock pieces were washed and arranged in sectio n half liners. Plastic dividers made from core liner caps were inserted between core pieces to kee p them in place for curation, which typically led to curated section lengths that exceeded create d section lengths. Note that curated core lengths, defined by the sum of curated section lengths, ca n exceed the length of the cored interval, resulting in recovery rates ${>}100\%$ . Adjacent core piece s that could be fitted together along fractures were curated as single pieces. The spacers may represent substantial intervals of no recovery. Core pieces that appeared susceptible to crumbling wer e encased in shrink wrap.  

A splitting line was marked on each piece with a red wax pencil so that the piece could be split int o representative working and archive halves, ideally maximizing the expression of dipping structures on the cut face of the core in addition to maintaining representative features in both archiv e and working halves. To ensure a consistent protocol for whole-core imaging, the splitting line wa s drawn so that the working half was on the right side of the line with the core upright. The workin g half of each piece was marked with a “W” to the right of the splitting line. Where fabrics wer e present, cores were marked for splitting with the fabric dipping to the east $(090^{\circ})$ in the IODP cor e reference frame. This protocol was sometimes overridden by the presence of specific features (e.g., mineralized patches) that were divided between the archive and working halves to ensure preservation and/or allow shipboard or postexpedition sampling.  

Once the split line was drawn, the plastic spacers were secured with acetone, creating bins tha t constrained movement of pieces during core transport. Spacers were mounted into the liners wit h the angle brace facing uphole, ensuring that the top of each piece had the same depth as the top o f the curated interval for each bin. The top and bottom offsets of each bin were entered into Sampl e Master. Based on the calculated bin lengths, the cumulative length of all bins, including spacers, was computed as the curated length of the section. The empty split liner with spacers glued in wa s then placed over the split liner containing the pieces, and the two halves were taped together in  a few places for temporary storage until core pieces were dry and equilibrated to laboratory conditions (usually $<\!1\,\mathrm{h}$ after arrival from the catwalk).  

# 1.6. Sample naming  

# 1.6.1. Editorial practice  

Sample naming in this volume follows standard IODP procedure. A full sample identifier consist s of the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, section half, and offset in centimeters measured from the top of the core section. For example, a sample identification of “396-U1567A-1H-2W, $10{-}12\,\mathrm{cm}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ,” represents a sample taken from the interva l between 10 and $12\,\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of the working half of Section 2 of Core 1 ${}^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^{\prime\prime}$ designates tha t this core was taken with the APC system) of Hole U1567A during Expedition 396.  

When working with data downloaded from the LIMS database or physical samples that wer e labeled on the ship, three additional sample naming concepts may be encountered: text ID, labe l ID, and printed labels.  

# 1.6.2. Text ID  

Samples taken on JOIDES Resolution are uniquely identified for use by software applications usin g the text ID, which combines two elements:  

• Sample type designation (e.g., SHLF for section half) and   
• A unique sequential number for any sample and sample type added to the sample type code (e.g., SHLF30495837).  

The text ID is not particularly helpful to most users but is critical for machine reading and troubleshooting.  

# 1.6.3. Label ID  

The label ID is used throughout the JOIDES Resolution workflows as a convenient, human-readable sample identity. However, a label ID is not necessarily unique. The label ID is made up of tw o parts: primary sample identifier and sample name.  

# 1.6.3.1. Primary sample identifier  

The primary sample identifier is very similar to the editorial sample name described above, wit h two notable exceptions:  

• Section halves always carry the appropriate identifier (396-U1567B-11X-2-A and 396- U1567B-11X-2-W for archive and working half, respectively).   
• Sample top and bottom offsets, relative to the parent section, are indicated as $^{\ast}35/37^{\ast}$ rather than $^{\prime\prime}35{-}37\,\mathrm{cm}$ .”  

# 1.7. Depth calculations  

Sample and measurement depth calculations were based on the methods described in IODP Dept h Scales Terminology v.2 (https://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines/142-iodp-depth-scalesterminology-april-2011/file) (Table T1). The definition of multiple depth scale types and their distinction in nomenclature should keep the user aware that a nominal depth value at two different dept h scale types (and even two different depth scales of the same type) generally does not refer to exactl y the same stratigraphic interval in a hole. The SI unit for all depth scales is meters (m).  

Depths of cored intervals were measured from the drill floor based on the length of drill pip e deployed beneath the rig floor and referred to as drilling depth below rig floor (DRF); it is traditionally referred to with custom units of meters below rig floor (mbrf). The depth of each core d interval, measured on the DRF scale, can be referenced to the seafloor by subtracting the seafloo r depth measurement (on the DRF scale) from the cored interval (on the DRF scale). This seafloorreferenced depth of the cored interval is reported on the DSF scale, and the traditionally used custom unit designation is meters below seafloor (mbsf). In the case of APC coring, the seafloo r depth was the length of pipe deployed minus the length of the mudline core recovered. In the cas e of RCB coring, the seafloor depth was estimated by the length of pipe deployed when torque wa s experienced or when weight on bit was reduced while lowering the drill string. In the case of Hol e U1572A, which was rotary cored, the initial seafloor depth was corrected based on the depth calculated for Hole U1572B, which was APC cored, because the precision depth recorder (PDR ) depth estimated for both holes was the same, as was their depth on the seismic line.

The two fundamenta l rules for this scale are that (1) the top depth of a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of it s cored interval (top DSF depth $=$ top CSF-A depth) regardless of type of material recovered or drilling disturbance observed and (2) the recovered material is a contiguous stratigraphic representation even when core segments are separated by voids when recovered, the core is shorter than th e cored interval, or it is unknown how much material is missing between core pieces. When void s were present in the core on the catwalk, they were closed by pushing core segments togethe r whenever possible. The length of missing core should be considered a depth uncertainty whe n analyzing data associated with core material.  

When core sections were given their curated lengths, they were also given a top and a botto m depth based on the core top depth and the section length. Depths of samples and measurement s on the CSF-A scale were calculated by adding the offset of the sample (or measurement from th e top of its section) to the top depth of the section.  

Per IODP policy established after the introduction of the IODP Depth Scales Terminology v.2, sample and measurement depths on the CSF-A depth scale are commonly referred to with th e custom unit mbsf, just like depths on the DSF scale. The reader should be aware, though, that th e use of mbsf for different depth scales can cause confusion in specific cases because different “mbs f depths” may be assigned to the same stratigraphic interval. For example, a soft-sediment core fro m less than a few hundred meters below seafloor often expands upon recovery (typically by a fe w percent to as much as $15\%$ ), and the length of the recovered core exceeds that of the cored interval. Therefore, a stratigraphic interval in a particular hole may not have the same depth on the DS F and CSF-A scales. When recovery in a core exceeds $100\%$ , the CSF-A depth of a sample taken fro m the bottom of the core will be deeper than that of a sample from the top of the subsequent cor e (i.e., some data associated with the two cores overlap on the CSF-A scale). To overcome the overlap problem, core intervals can be placed on the core depth below seafloor, Method B (CSF-B), depth scale. The Method B approach scales the recovered core length back into the interval cored, from $>\!100\%$ to exactly $100\%$ recovery. If cores had ${<}100\%$ recovery to begin with, they are no t scaled. When downloading data using the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) LIM S Reports pages (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/LORE), depths for samples and measurements are b y default presented on both the CSF-A and CSF-B scales. The CSF-B depth scale can be useful fo r data analysis and presentations at sites with a single hole.  

Wireline logging data are collected at the wireline log depth below rig floor (WRF) scale, fro m which a seafloor measurement is subtracted to create the wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF ) scale. For Expedition 396, WSF depths were only used for preliminary data usage on the ship. Immediately after data collection was completed, the wireline logging data were transferred to th e Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory Borehole Research Group (LDEO-BRG), where multipl e passes and runs were depth matched using the natural gamma radiation (NGR) logs. The dat a were returned to the ship at the wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) scale, whic h is the final and official logging depth scale type for investigators.  

# 1.8. Shipboard core analysis  

After letting cores thermally equilibrate for at least $^{1\mathrm{~h~}}$ , whole-round core sections were ru n through the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL), which measures $P.$ -wave velocity, density, and MS, the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL), and the $\mathrm{X}.$ -ray Multisensor Logge r (XMSL) (Figure F3). Thermal conductivity measurements were also taken before the cores wer e split lengthwise into working and archive halves. The working half of each core was sampled fo r shipboard analysis, routinely for biostratigraphy, paleomagnetism, physical properties, and geochemistry and more irregularly for thin sections. The archive half of each core was scanned on th e Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) and measured for color reflectance and MS on the Section Hal f Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). The archive halves were described macroscopically and microscopically in smear slides, and the working halves were sampled for thin section microscopic examination. Finally, the archive halves were run through the cryogenic magnetometer. Both halves of th e core were then put into labeled plastic tubes that were sealed and transferred to cold storage spac e aboard the ship.  

A total of 11,359 samples were taken for shipboard analysis during Expedition 396. At the end o f the expedition, all archive halves and thin sections were shipped to the Gulf Coast Repository i n preparation for programmatic X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning from 11 January to 1 1 March 2022. All working halves of the core sections were sent to the Bremen Core Repositor y (BCR) in preparation for a shore-based sampling party planned for 21–28 April 2022. All the core s from Expedition 396 eventually will be stored permanently at the BCR.  

# 2. Lithostratigraphy  

The lithostratigraphy group mostly followed the workflow used by previous IODP expedition s that recovered sedimentary (e.g., Sutherland et al., 2018; Tamura et al., 2015b; Norris et al., 2014a ) and igneous rocks (e.g., Sun et al., 2018; Arculus et al., 2015; Expedition 352 Scientists, 2014; Expedition 345 Scientists, 2014). This involved describing, sampling, and analyzing core sections following core splitting, utilizing both archive and working halves. Here, we outline the details of th e procedure, providing a description of the workflow and approaches applied to sedimentary an d igneous rock description and analysis.  

# 2.1. Core description workflow  

The core description workflow is illustrated in Figure F4. Different procedures were followed fo r unconsolidated sediments, sedimentary rocks, and igneous rocks.  

![](images/faed8c79f70c28746af7385decf11e03f962486f5d43b16cf26e62cc4e64d7a2.jpg)  
Figure F4. Core description workflow, Expedition 396.  

Sediments and rocks recovered during Expedition 396 were described macroscopically fro m archive-half sections and microscopically using stereoscopy, smear slides, and thin sections. Digital color images of all archive-half sections were produced using the SHIL, and visual color determination was performed using Munsell soil color charts (Munsell Color Company, 2010). Observations were entered in separate macroscopic (drilling disturbance, sediments, intrusiv e mantle, extrusive hypabyssal, alteration, veins, halos, and structure) and microscopic (thin sectio n description)  DESClogik  templates  (version  x.16.1.0.14;  see  the  DESClogik  user  guide  a t http://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation). Selected data are presented in VCD forms (Figur e F5), and synthesized descriptions and lithostratigraphic units are presented in the Lithostratigraphy section of each site chapter.  

Finalized lithostratigraphic columns were generated for all holes to document defining feature s and variability across lithostratigraphic units. Proximal sites are normally combined into one sit e report, and lithostratigraphic unit definitions are shared for the area (i.e., Sites U1567 and U156 8 [Modgunn hydrothermal vent complex], Sites U1569 and U1570 [Mimir High], and Sites U157 1 and U1572 [Skoll High]). Where applicable, holes are preliminarily correlated using lithostratigraphic unit boundaries. These ties are supported by physical properties and biostratigraphi c observations.

# 2.2. Core images and archive-half scans  

The archive halves were scanned using the SHIL. Three pairs of advanced illumination high-current, focused LED line lights with adjustable angles to the lens axis illuminated any large crack s and blocks in the core surface and sidewalls. Each of the LED pairs has a color temperature of 650 0 K. Digital images were taken using a linescan camera at an interval of 10 lines per millimeter t o create a high-resolution TIFF file. The camera height was set so that each pixel imaged a $0.1\;\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ section area. Compressed JPEG files were created from the TIFF files. One set of image files show s a grayscale and a depth ruler. The second set is cropped to include only the section-half surface.  

# 2.2.1. Imaging of the sediments and sedimentary rocks  

Standard core splitting can affect the appearance of the split core surface, obscuring fine details o f lithology and sedimentary structures. Therefore, when appropriate, the archive-half sections wer e scraped parallel to bedding using a stainless steel or glass scraper. After cleaning the core surface, the archive half was scanned as soon as possible to avoid color changes brought on by oxidatio n and drying of sediment. Very dark gray, dark brown, and black sediments were occasionally briefl y dried to avoid reflections in images.  

# 2.2.2. Imaging of the igneous rocks  

Prior to splitting the core into working and archive halves, each core was imaged using the SHI L on a wet outside surface at four different angles $(0^{\circ},\,90^{\circ},\,180^{\circ})$ , and $270^{\circ},$ ) that were combined t o form a $360^{\circ}$ whole-round image. The coherent hard rock sections and/or hard rock pieces wer e then split using a diamond-impregnated saw along lines drawn by a petrologist or a structura l geologist to preserve significant compositional and structural features in both the archive an d working halves. Fragmented pieces of hard rock that fit together were assigned a joint number an d labeled with a letter in consecutive order downsection (e.g., 1a, 1b, and 1c). Plastic spacers wer e used to separate pieces with different numbers. An arrow added to the labels of single pieces tha t showed no evidence of rotation indicates the orientation by pointing to the top of the section. Scanning the cut dry and wet archive-half surfaces using the SHIL produced high-resolution colo r images and measured red-green-blue (RGB) color values at $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution.  

Once imaged using the SHIL, sedimentary and igneous cores were scanned through the SHMS L to obtain discrete point magnetic susceptibility (MSP) measurements and light parameters $(\mathbb{L}^{*},\mathbf{a}^{*}$ , and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ ) at $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ resolution. $L^{*}$ defines the lightness of a color, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ denotes the red/green value, an d $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ denotes the yellow/blue value.  

Shipboard samples were taken from working halves for thin section and X-ray diffraction (XRD ) analyses (see Geochemistry).  

# 2.3. Thin section preparation  

Billets were ground for mounting using a Buehler MetaServ 250 grinding and polishing wheel wit h 200, 400, and 600 grit polishing paper. The billets were left to dry on a hot plate $(\sim\!50^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ prior t o mounting. Drying time varied depending on the porosity/vesicularity of each sample. The billet s were then mounted on $27\:\mathrm{mm}\times46\:\mathrm{mm}$ frosted slides using Epo-Tek epoxy and placed back on th e hot plate, and light pressure was applied to help the epoxy set overnight.  

A Buehler Petrothin was used to cut off the billet from the glass slide and grind the remainin g mounted sample to ${\sim}50~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ above optical thickness $(30~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ . The remaining $50~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ was remove d using a glass plate and a slurry of 600 grit silica carbide powder mixed with ethylene glycol. Onc e optical thickness was achieved, the sample was hand polished using a slurry of 1000 grit silica carbid e and ethylene glycol before receiving a final polish on the Logitech PM-5. Polishing time on the PM- 5 varied depending on the hardness of the sample (basalts $=25\;\mathrm{min}$ ; clays or soft sediments $=15\;\mathrm{min}]$ ).  

# 2.4. Visual core description and lithostratigraphic columns  

Sediment lithology, structures, accessories, disturbances, and other observations recorde d through DESClogik as well as physical properties data obtained during the shipboard analysi s were used to produce graphic summaries for each hole. These graphic summaries, also known a s VCDs (Figure F5), were produced by the publication office using the Strater software package. VCDs include core numbers, core recovery, core images, graphic lithology (as in Figure F6), lithostratigraphic units, unit descriptions, MS, NGR, and RGB plotted versus depth on a CSF-A scale.  

Subsequently, VCDs were updated into lithostratigraphic columns to better reflect the primary representative lithologies without including line-by-line information recorded in detailed DESClogi k descriptions. Graphic lithology intervals are plotted in Kaleidagraph or Excel, and graphics ar e designed in Adobe Illustrator. Graphic lithologies follow the simplified lithologic key shown in Figure F7. For holes dominated by sediments of variable texture, a grain size profile (clay to gravel) i s included in the graphic lithologies. Distinguishing characteristics are highlighted in the graphic lithologies and placed on a CSF-A depth scale. Ages, confirmed with biostratigraphy (i.e., dinocys t zones, or “dino zones”) based on Bujak and Mudge (1994), Mudge and Bujak (1994), and Mudge an d Bujak (1996a, 1996b), are plotted. Core number, core recovery, lithostratigraphic units and descriptions, and core image are included in these finalized lithostratigraphic columns. A column indicatin g intervals of ash or ash-rich (i.e., ${\ge}25\%$ ) sediments is provided for holes with extensive ash deposits.

Figure F6. Graphic lithology and symbols used for VCDs and hole summaries, Expedition 396. (Continued on next page.)  

If multiple holes from one site or area (i.e., combination of two sites) are correlative with lithostratigraphic unit boundaries, an additional figure is included in the site report that shows simplified lithostratigraphic columns with preliminary ties on vertical (CSF-A) and horizontal (meter ) scales. The simplified lithostratigraphic columns include ages, core numbers, lithostratigraphi c units and descriptions, and graphic lithologies, as well as ties (black lines) and an indication of th e bearing of the drilled transect of holes.

Figure F6 (continued).  

# 2.4.1. Core summaries  

Core summaries are written to briefly describe the primary lithologic observations for each core. This includes principal lithologies, a description of lithologic variability (if any), Munsell-derive d colors, and notable sedimentary structures and features. VCDs are also available online (see Cor e descriptions) but were not utilized in site reports.  

# 2.5. Definition of lithostratigraphic units  

Lithostratigraphic units (e.g., I, II, and III) are defined based on major changes in the principa l lithology, degree of lithification, or shift in dominant sedimentary structure or features. Often, these boundaries correspond to changes in physical properties, although this was not a requirement for defining a lithostratigraphic unit. Physical properties and biostratigraphic observation s are used to aid in the identification of lithologic transitions and unconformities. Unit description s are based on the overall lithology observed through the interval and across correlative holes an d sites, taking into consideration a degree of lateral and vertical variability. Units are present in a t least one hole, and often at multiple holes in an area, and mostly span tens of meters. When mor e subtle shifts are observed in lithology downhole, especially when they occur over an interval les s than $10\;\mathrm{m}$ , subunits are defined (e.g., IIa and IIb).  

# 2.6. Drilling disturbance  

Drilling-related disturbances are recorded where applicable (in the Disturbance column in DESClogik). The type of drilling disturbance for soft and firm sediment and igneous rocks was describe d using the following terms:  

• Fall-in: out of place material at the top of a core that has fallen downhole onto the cored surface.   
• Uparching: material retains its coherency, and material closest to the core liner is bent downward.   
• Void: empty space appears within the cored material (e.g., caused by gas expansion during core retrieval; note that voids related to partial strokes during the coring process are curated on the catwalk and do not appear in any core description).   
• Flow-in, coring/drilling slurry, along-core gravel/sand contamination: soft-sediment stretching and/or compressional shearing structures occur when severe.   
• Soupy: intervals are water saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
• Biscuited: sediment of intermediate stiffness shows vertical variations in the degree of disturbance, whereas firmer intervals are relatively undisturbed.   
• Fractured: firm sediment is broken during drilling but not displaced or rotated significantly.   
• Fragmented or brecciated: firm sediment is pervasively broken by drilling and may be displaced or rotated.

Figure F7. Graphic lithology used for finalized lithostratigraphic columns, Expedition 396.  

The degree of drilling disturbance is included for each noted disturbance and include the following:  

• Slight: core pieces are in place but broken.   
• Moderate: core pieces are in place or partly displaced, but original orientation is preserved or recognizable.   
• High: core pieces are probably in correct stratigraphic sequence, but original orientation is lost.  

# 2.7. Sediment, sedimentary rock, and volcaniclastic rock classification  

# 2.7.1. Sedimentary classification  

Three main sedimentary lithologic classes are defined based on the primary origin of the sedimen t constituents (but not the depositional process):  

• Biogenic: ${>}50\%$ carbonate, chemical, and biogenic particles. • Siliciclastic: ${>}50\%$ siliciclastic particles, $<\!25\%$ volcanic particles, and ${<}50\%$ biogenic particles; therefore, nonvolcanic siliciclastic particles dominate chemical and biogenic particles. • Ash and volcaniclastic: ash is applied to fine-grained (smaller than gravel) volcanic sediments that contain ${>}50\%$ volcanic particles. The volcaniclastic prefix is applied to biogenic and siliciclastic sediments that contain $>\!25\%$ volcanic clasts and grains mixed with nonvolcanic particles (either nonvolcanic siliciclastic, biogenic, or both). Note that the term “volcaniclastic” is used sensu Fisher (1961) and therefore includes both volcanic and tuffaceous lithologies.  

These lithologic classes form the basis of the principal name of the described sediments and rocks, with appropriate prefixes and suffixes that may be chosen for mixed lithologies (see Principa l names and modifiers).  

Sediments and sedimentary rocks recovered during Expedition 396 are classified using a modifie d scheme initially developed during IODP Expedition 350 (Tamura et al., 2015a). This scheme integrate s volcanic particles into the sedimentary descriptive scheme typically used (e.g., Norris et al., 2014b) t o describe siliciclastic and biogenic sediments during IODP expeditions. The methodology allows a comprehensive description of mixed sediments, including volcaniclastic, biogenic, and siliciclastic sedimen t and sedimentary rocks (Figure F8). The purposes of this classification scheme are to (1) include volcanic particles in the assessment of sediment and rock recovered in cores, (2) make rock informatio n accessible to scientists with diverse research backgrounds and experiences, (3) allow relatively quic k and smooth data entry, and (4) display data seamlessly in graphical presentations. In this scheme, inferred fragmentation, transport, deposition, and alteration processes are not part of the lithologi c name. Observations implying those processes are recorded in the relevant columns (bedding, lamination, grain size, sedimentary structures, etc.) and as comments in the macroscopic DESClogik template. Therefore, sizes of volcanic grains inferred to have formed by a variety of processes (i.e., pyroclasts, autoclasts, epiclasts, and reworked volcanic clasts) (Fisher and Schmincke, 1984) are classified using  a common grain size terminology that allows for a more descriptive (i.e., nongenetic) approach.  

# 2.7.2. Principal names and modifiers  

The principal name is based on the most abundant sediment class. Principal names for the siliciclasti c class are adapted from the grain size classes of Wentworth (1922), and principal names for the volcaniclastic class are adapted from the grain size classes of Fisher and Schmincke (1984) (Figure F9). Thus, the Wentworth (1922) and Fisher and Schmincke (1984) classifications are used to refer to particle type (siliciclastic versus volcanic, respectively) and the maximum size of the particles (Figure F9). For the biogenic class sediments, commonly used terms are used (e.g., ooze or chalk) and do not hav e  

Figure F8. Sedimentary (siliciclastic and biogenic) and volcaniclastic lithology naming conventions based on relative abundances of grain and clast types, Expedition 396. Principal lithologic names are required for all intervals. Prefixes and suffixes ar e optional and can be combined with any principal name. First-order division is based on amount of carbonate, chemical, an d biogenic components present. If ${>}50\%$ of the sediment is carbonate, chemical, or biogenic, the corresponding principal name s are used (blue boxes). For sediments with ${<}50\%$ carbonate, chemical, or biogenic components (yellow boxes), a second-orde r division is applied based on abundance of volcanic-derived grains and clasts. For volcanic sediments with ${>}50\%$ volcanic clast s and grains, the principal name “ash” is used, or they are described as extrusive (see Figure F10). When nonvolcanic siliciclasti c sediment dominates, Wentworth (1922) grain size classification is used to determine the principal name. For siliciclastic sediments, the prefix “volcaniclastic” refers to sediments with $25\%{-}50\%$ volcanic clasts and grains, and the suffixes “with lapilli, ” “with ash,” and “with volcanic clasts” may be applied to siliciclastic sediments with $10\%{-}25\%$ volcanic clasts and grains.

a separate size or texture notation. As such, nannofossil and foraminiferal ooze imply the dominan t grain size is clay and sand, respectively. Note the principal name is thus purely descriptive and doe s not include interpretive classifications relating to fragmentation, transport, depositional, or alteratio n processes.  

Observations associated with those processes are recorded in the relevant columns (Layer/Bedding, Lamination, Grading, Grain Size, etc.) and as comments in the macroscopic DESClogik template. Sorting is entered into DESClogik for all sediments and sedimentary rocks. For eac h principal name, both a consolidated (i.e., semilithified to lithified) and a nonconsolidated ter m exists; they are mutually exclusive (e.g., clay or claystone; ash or tuff). For some descriptions o f variable texture (e.g., lithostratigraphic unit descriptions), Wentworth’s clay and silt sizes are combined in a “mud” class; similarly, fine, medium, and coarse sand are combined in a “sand” class.  

For all lithologies, the principal lithologic name can be modified by prefixes and/or suffixes fo r secondary components as follows (Figure F8):  

• Prefixes describe a secondary component with an abundance between $25\%$ and $50\%$ (corresponding to “abundant” in smear slide descriptions).   
• Suffixes are secondary or tertiary components with abundances of $10\%{-25\%}$ (corresponding to “common” in smear slide descriptions) and are indicated by the suffix “with” (e.g., “with clay” or “with radiolarians”) in order of decreasing abundance.  

For example, a nonlithified sediment containing $45\%$ nannofossils, $30\%$ clay, and $10\%$ radiolarian s is described as “clay-rich nannofossil ooze with radiolarians.”  

When the mineralogic, chemical, or structural composition of the sediments or sedimentary rock s have been altered or changed from their original form, the prefix “meta-” is used in conjunctio n with principal lithology (e.g., metasandstone). These rocks are described under the Metamorphi c tab in DESClogik. In many cases, however, no clear distinction of boundary between well-lithifie d sediments and metasedimentary rock exists. Furthermore, extensive alteration by veins, fractures, and other structural features requires special treatment, particularly when a sedimentary rock i s crosscut by a mesh network of veins. For this reason, the name “breccia” is applied in several different ways (see also Igneous petrology).  

The degree of lithification is determined by observing the amount of deformation the sedimen t can accommodate and the level of sediment consolidation. Sediment is considered lithified whe n the sediment is not deformed easily with a finger, toothpick, or metal scraper. Lithification i s ranked using a qualitative scale: slightly consolidated, moderately consolidated, well consolidated, and lithified. The degree of lithification is expressed in the principal name using alternate term s common in geology:  

• Siliciclastic class: if the sediment can be easily deformed with a finger, no term is applied. If the sediment cannot be easily deformed with a finger, the suffix “-stone” is added to the grain size identifier (e.g., claystone). Exceptions are for gravel-sized sediments where the terms “conglomerate” or “breccia” are used for rocks with well-rounded and angular clasts, respectively. The principal names “conglomerate” and “breccia” are modified using the terms “matrix-supported” and “clast-supported,” depending on the matrix to clast ratio. • Biogenic class: if the sediment can be easily deformed with a finger, the nonlithified term “ooze” is used in conjunction with the most abundant component (e.g., nannofossil ooze or radiolarian ooze). If the calcareous sediment cannot be easily deformed with a finger but can be easily scratched with a fingernail, the semilithified term “chalk” is used for calcareous sediments (e.g., nannofossil chalk) and the terms “radiolarite,” “diatomite,” and “porcellanite” are used for siliceous sediments. If the sediment cannot be easily scratched with a fingernail, the lithified term “limestone” is used for calcareous sediments (e.g., nannofossil limestone). If siliceous sediment cannot be scratched with a fingernail and displays a glassy luster, the term “chert” is used. Note that in this volume, the terms “porcellanite” and “chert” do not imply crystallinity of silica, in contrast to other usages of those terms.  

# 2.7.3. Sedimentary structures, stratification, and lithologic features  

The locations and types of stratification and sedimentary structures visible on the prepared surfaces of the section halves are respectively entered in the Bedding and Sedimentary structures columns of the macroscopic DESClogik worksheet. Locations and scales of interstratification and th e locations of individual bedding and sedimentary features, such as scours, graded bedding, paralle l laminations, imbrication, flame structures, flute casts, patches, or blebs, are recorded in DESClogik. Where visible, bottom contact type and attitude, macroscopic fossils (e.g., echinoderm, gastropods, and bivalves), and secondary mineralization (diagenetic constituent and composition; e.g., pyrite and glauconite) are noted in the corresponding columns in DESClogik. The followin g terminology (based on Stow, 2005) was used to describe the scale of stratification:  

• Thin lamination $=<\!3\;\mathrm{mm}$ thick.   
• Medium lamination $=0.3–0.6\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Thick lamination $=0.6–1\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Very thin bed $=1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Thin bed $=3–10\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Medium bed $=10{-}30\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Thick $\mathtt{b e d}=30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
• Very thick bed $=>\!100\,\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.  

# 2.7.4. Bioturbation intensity  

Four degrees of bioturbation intensity are reported in the Bioturbation intensity column using th e following numeric scale. If no bioturbation is observed, this is kept blank.  

• Slight bioturbation $(10\%{-}30\%)$ , • Moderate bioturbation $(30\%{-}60\%)$ , • Heavy bioturbation $(60\%{-}90\%)$ , and • Complete bioturbation $(>\!90\%)$ .  

# 2.7.5. Smear slide descriptions  

Size, composition, and abundance of sediment constituents are estimated microscopically usin g smear slides. Smear slide samples of the main lithologies were collected from the archive-half sections unless lithification made sampling impossible.  

For each smear slide, a small amount of sediment is removed from the section half using a woode n toothpick and put on a $25~\mathrm{mm}\times75~\mathrm{mm}$ glass slide (Marsaglia et al., 2013). A drop of deionize d water is added, and the sediment is homogenized and evenly spread across the glass slide. Th e dispersed sample is dried on a hot plate at a low setting $(50^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . A drop of adhesive (Norland optica l adhesive Number 61) is added as a mounting medium for a glass coverslip, which is carefull y placed on the dried sample to prevent air bubbles from being trapped in the adhesive. The smea r slide is then fixed in an ultraviolet light box for $5\,\mathrm{min}$ to cure the adhesive.  

Smear slides are examined using a transmitted-light petrographic microscope equipped with  a standard eyepiece micrometer. Biogenic and mineral components are identified following standard petrographic techniques as stated in reference manuals Rothwell (1989a) and Marsaglia et al. (2013). Several fields of view are examined at $10\times$ , $20\times$ , and $40\times$ to assess the abundance of detrita l (e.g., quartz, feldspar, clay minerals, mica, and heavy minerals), biogenic (e.g., nannofossils, othe r calcareous bioclasts, diatoms, foraminifers, and radiolarians), and authigenic (e.g., carbonate, iro n sulfide, iron oxides, and glauconite) components. Average grain size of clay $(<\!4{\mathrm{~}}\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , silt (4–6 3 $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , and sand $(>\!63\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ is estimated for sediments dominated by siliciclastic material. The relativ e percent abundances of the sedimentary constituents are visually estimated using the techniques o f Terry and Chilingar (1955) and Rothwell (1989b). The texture of siliciclastic lithologies (relativ e abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains) and the proportions and presence of biogenic an d mineral components are recorded in the smear slide worksheet of the microscopic DESClogi k template. Components observed in smear slides are categorized as follows:  

• $\mathrm{T}=\mathrm{trace}\;(<\!1\%)$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(1\%{-}10\%)$ . • $C=$ common $(\mathord{>}10\%{-}25\%)$ .   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!25\%{-}50\%)$ .   
• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant $(>\!50\%)$ .  

Smear slides provide only a rough estimate of the relative abundance of sediment constituents. O n occasion, the lithologic name assigned based on smear slide observation does not match the nam e in the macroscopic lithology description. This is because a small sample may not represent th e macroscopic description of a much larger sediment interval. Additionally, very fine and coars e grains are difficult to observe in smear slides, and their relative proportions in the sediment can b e affected during slide preparation. Therefore, intervals dominated by sand and larger size constituents are examined by macroscopic comparison to grain size reference charts.  

# 2.8. Igneous petrology  

Expedition 396 core description procedures for igneous rocks are based on those from IOD P Expeditions 367/368 (Sun et al., 2018), 351 (Arculus et al., 2015), and 349 (Expedition 352 Scientists, 2014), Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 345 (Expedition 345 Scientists, 2014), and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 104 (Eldholm et al., 1987).  

Units and subunits are divided on the basis of significant lithologic changes. The groundmass texture and color, as well as the primary modal composition, based on the International Union o f Geological Sciences (IUGS) system (Le Maitre, 1989), were used to give a principal lithology nam e to a given igneous rock.  

# 2.8.1. Volcanic (extrusive and hypabyssal) rocks  

Four main volcanic rock categories were observed and defined during Expedition 396 (Figure F10):  

• Basalt: black to dark gray rock containing plagioclase, pyroxene, and rare olivine (replaced by iddingsite and saponite) in the size range glassy to fine grained. When presenting a fragmented aspect, the prefix “brecciated” is used (i.e., clast-supported basaltic breccia associated with a lava flow). Picrite is a subdivision of basalt characterized by high-olivine phenocryst (typically replaced by saponite) content $(>\!20\%)$ .   
• Andesite: a dark to light gray rock with a microcrystalline groundmass dominated by plagioclase that can also contain pyroxenes and amphibole but is devoid of olivine and quartz.   
• Dacite: light gray to tan rock, usually plagioclase-phyric, that can contain pyroxenes $\pm$ quartz ± hornblende with a glassy to cryptocrystalline groundmass.   
• Peperite and hyaloclastite are distinguished based on their fragmented aspect: peperite is defined by White et al. (2000) as a rock formed by disintegration of magma intruding and mingling with unconsolidated or poorly consolidated, typically wet sediments. Hyaloclastites are  

![](images/05354af6c9857f0f15f9e67f3dc352a89123b3701e0cb83e20a9b853ecdec7aa.jpg)  
Figure F10. Igneous lithology naming conventions, Expedition 396. Principal lithologic names are required and based o n the IUGS system (Le Maitre, 1989). Prefixes and lithologic unit types are optional.  

defined as glass-rich volcanic rocks formed by lava-water (and lava-sediment) interaction where the lava is shattered into small angular glassy fragments.  

Matrix-supported breccias not related to lava flows are described in the Sedimentary tab i n DESClogik. Large $(>\!1{\mathrm{~cm}})$ volcanic clasts in sediments and sedimentary rocks were classified i n the LITH 1 Clast 1 igneous columns.  

A prefix can indicate the phenocryst assemblage and total phenocryst abundances:  

• Highly $=>\!10\%$ .   
• Moderately $=>\!5\%{-}10\%$ .   
• Sparsely $=1\%{-}5\%$ .   
• Aphyric $=-1\%$ phenocrysts.  

If present in a given sample, multiple phenocryst minerals were used as modifiers appearing in th e order of increasing abundance. For example, in plagioclase-olivine phyric basalt, olivine is th e most abundant phenocryst mineral.  

The prefix can also indicate the following:  

• A compositional distinction: the prefix “basaltic” is sometimes used with the primary lithology “andesite” to highlight the association of clinopyroxene and plagioclase in the groundmass. This naming convention was also corroborated using inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) geochemical analyses (see Geochemistry). • A fragmented aspect: when presenting a fragmented aspect, the prefix “brecciated” was used with the primary lithology (i.e., clast-supported breccia associated with a lava flow).  

# 2.8.2. Lithologic unit type  

The lithologic unit type indicates the nature of the volcanic body. We applied the classificatio n scheme used during Leg 104 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1987):  

• Discrete: usually small $(<\!1\;\mathfrak{m})$ lava flow generally bounded by chilled margins but also by faults or sharp textural and color changes.   
• Lava flow: core/section with flow structure and/or brecciated or vesiculated flow top and bottom, $>\!1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick.   
• Massive: core is little affected by drilling, is recovered in long and intact pieces, and is usually non to sparsely vesicular.   
• Pillow lava: core is $0.1{-}1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and defined by curved chilled margins, spherulitic textures, glassy margins and/or hyaloclastites, and microcrystalline to cryptocrystalline groundmass grain size, as well as decreasing crystal abundances and sizes (phenocrysts; groundmass) toward the glassy rims.   
• Volcaniclastic: fragmented volcanic rocks.  

# 2.8.3. Contact types  

Margins and contacts of flows were described by observing the features of the chilled sections tha t indicate a possible hiatus between two flows/pillows. A chilled contact, with or without glass, wa s recognized by observing the terminal end of the margin for sediment that was not entrenched int o the rock but rather baked or cooked onto the rock, indicating a baked or chilled contact with th e rock.  

A chilled margin was recognized through identification of a sudden change in groundmass over  a very short distance. Unlike a chilled contact, sediment at the terminal end of the unit was no t required to determine its nomenclature.  

Glassy margins, chilled margins, and contact boundaries were inserted individually for the top an d bottom of each section where they could be determined to discriminate individual flows and allo w for a greater level of precision in the descriptions.  

The following contact types were defined:  

• Baked contact: contact with sediments that were baked by proximity of lava.  

• Chilled contact: chilled contact with sediments, with or without glass, in direct contact with sediments. “Bottom” or “top” was added as a prefix where the orientation could be determined.   
• Chilled margin: chilled contact without sediments, without glass, determined by cryptocrystalline groundmass, typically found quenched adjacent to the chilled contact. “Bottom” or “top” was added as a prefix where the orientation could be determined.   
• Glassy margin: a margin between two pillows that has no sediment and the pillows have fused together. There is no clear indication of the boundary between the pillows as originally deposited.  

# 2.8.4. Degree of crystallinity  

For the degree of crystallinity description, the following terms were used:  

• Holohyaline $=100\%$ glass.   
• Hypohyaline $=\mathbf{glass}>$ crystals.   
• Hypocrystalline $=$ glass $<$ crystal.   
• Holocrystalline $=100\%$ crystals.  

# 2.8.5. Igneous texture and grain size distribution  

For the textural description of volcanic rocks, the following nomenclature was applied to describ e the groundmass, predominantly at the macroscopic level:  

• Aphanitic: crystalline but individual grains not discernible with a hand lens.   
• Phaneritic: crystals are discernible with a hand lens.   
• Glomeroporphyritic: containing clusters of phenocrysts.   
• Intergranular: plagioclase crystals surrounded by interstitial granular pyroxene, olivine, and/or oxide minerals.   
• Interstitial: glass, crypto-, or microcrystalline material between coarser grained crystals.   
• Porphyritic: increasing presence of phenocrysts.   
• Spherulitic: fan-like arrangement of divergent microlites.   
• Vitrophyric: phenocrysts in a glassy groundmass.  

Terms used to describe the grain size distribution are bimodal (two dominant mineral sizes), equigranular (principal minerals are in the same size range), inequigranular (principal minerals hav e different grain sizes), and seriate (continuous range in grain size).  

# 2.8.6. Vesicularity  

Vesicularity is characterized by the abundance of vesicles:  

• Nonvesicular $=-1\%$ vesicles.   
• Sparsely vesicular $=1\%{-}5\%$ vesicles.   
• Moderately vesicular $=>\!5\%{-}20\%$ vesicles.   
• Highly vesicular $=>\!20\%$ vesicles.  

The description of the size, shape, and roundness of vesicles is based on the classification chart s from Expedition 367/368 (Sun et al., 2018) (Figure F11). An estimate of the percentage abundanc e of vesicles is included in the VCDs (see Core descriptions).  

![](images/a9f55936b8586a8ae7f8bdb1b23379c975cd9e6d7af7b2c9c41321190c4225a7.jpg)  
Figure F11. Comparison chart for describing vesicle sphericity and roundness in volcanic rocks, Expedition 396. After Su n et al. (2018); modified from Wentworth (1922).  

# 2.8.7. Intrusive rocks  

Weathered granitic basement was drilled at Sites U1565 and U1566. We used the quartz-alkal i feldspar-plagioclase-feldspathoid (QAPF) Streckeisen classification (Streckeisen, 1974) to nam e the principal lithology: monzogranite. The prefix “biotite” is used for the least altered sections. The prefix “decomposed” is used for sections showing intense alteration.  

# 2.8.8. Alteration  

Low-temperature and low-pressure (i.e., seafloor) mineralization, veins, and background alteration are defined as alteration. Alteration description includes primary alteration mineralogy an d infilling of vesicles (when applicable) and halos. Textures used to define groundmass alteration ar e patchy, corona, pseudomorphic, and recrystallized. Levels of background alteration are recorde d as follows:  

• Fresh $=<2\,\mathrm{vol}\%$ .   
• Slight $=2–10\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ .   
• Moderate $=>\!10\!-\!50\;\mathrm{vol\%}$ .   
• $\mathrm{High}=>50-95\;\mathrm{vol}\%.$ .   
• Complete $=>\!95\,\mathrm{vol}\%$ .  

An estimate of the level of alteration is included in the VCDs (see Core descriptions).  

# 2.8.9. Veins  

We used the term “vein” to refer to any later crosscutting feature formed by sediment injection o r precipitation from hydrothermal fluids and reserved the word “dike” to describe any later crosscutting feature that formed by introduction of magma. The density (i.e., the percentage of vein s within a piece or an interval estimated visually), mineralogy, width, color, vein type (e.g., banded, composite, en echelon, haloed, intravenous, and uniform), connectivity (isolated, single, branched, and network), texture (cross-fiber, slip-fiber, massive, polycrystalline, and vuggy), and contact s with host rocks (diffuse, irregular, and sharp) were described, modified from the criteria fro m ODP Leg 209 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004) (Figure F12). The length, width, and orientation o f representative veins in a section were measured.  

# 2.8.10. Microscopic (thin section) description  

The characterization of thin sections was used to complement and refine macroscopic core observations for igneous rocks. All thin section observations were entered into the LIMS databas e through a DESClogik microscopic template. Thin section descriptions include primary (igneous ) rock-forming minerals (including phenocrysts, groundmass, etc.) and secondary (alteration) mineral phases (in veins, vesicles, groundmass, etc.). When applicable, vesicles size, abundance, an d filling were also documented.  

![](images/91737a9724ab5e4a0c96d173faf85579e3094fc8587147860b82256dbc993e3f.jpg)  
Figure F12. Vein description scheme, Expedition 396. Modified from Sun et al. (2018).  

Thin section descriptions include the following terms:  

• Sample domain: if there is more than one domain on the slide, each domain is described separately. For example, a slide that shows a large sedimentary vein $25\%$ of the slide) in a basaltic matrix ( $75\%$ of the slide) is described as two slides (samples): one sample domain is described as “vein” and the second one as “host rock.” Other possible domains include sharp change of mineralogy, grain size, or texture.   
• Lithology prefix: lithology prefix for the described sample domain.   
• Principal lithology: refers only to the lithology of the described sample domain, which includes picrite, basalt, basaltic andesite, andesite, and granite.   
• Texture: volcanic rock is described as holohyaline $100\%$ glass) to holocrystalline ( $100\%$ crystals). The terms “phyric” and “glomeroporphyritic” indicate the presence of phenocrysts and clusters of phenocrysts, respectively. “Seriate” texture indicates a continuous range in grain size. The presence of flow textures is also added in texture comments. In cases where there is no significant grain size difference between groundmass crystals and somewhat larger and more euhedral crystals, which do not adhere to the definition of phenocrysts, the larger crystals are described in the groundmass. When glass is present in the lithology, the percentage of fresh glass is indicated.  

The following terms are used for grain size:  

• Average groundmass grain size modal name: grain sizes follow Neuendorf et al. (2005) using the divisions glass, cryptocrystalline, microcrystalline, and fine, medium, and coarse grained (as defined in Volcanic (extrusive and hypabyssal) rocks). • Maximum grain size modal name: analogous to “average groundmass grain size modal name.”  

The following terms are used for mineralogy:  

• Mineral phenocryst shape: euhedral, subhedral, or anhedral.   
• Mineral phenocryst habit: elongate, equant, subequant, or tabular.   
• Clinopyroxene (cpx) and orthopyroxene (opx) phenocryst exsolution: blebs and lamellae.   
• Vesicle shape: see Figure F11.  

For plagioclase, a qualifier for zoning was recorded following the convention used during Expedition 345 (Expedition 345 Scientists, 2014):  

• $0=\mathrm{none}$ .   
• $^{1=}$ zoning is rare and weakly developed.   
• $2=$ abundant zoning that can range from weak to strong.   
• $3=$ nearly ubiquitous, generally strong zoning.  

The type of zoning in plagioclase was also documented as follows:  

• Continuous: zoning is optically continuous from core to rim.   
• Discontinuous: zoning occurs from core to rim, but with distinct break(s).   
• Patchy: zoning occurs in patches randomly throughout the grain.   
• Oscillatory.  

# 2.8.11. Geochemical observations  

Our petrographic observations were corroborated with ${>}450$ analyses on the archive halves of th e core (see Geochemistry) performed using an Olympus Delta handheld portable XRF (pXRF ) spectrometer. Rock samples that were small enough and could be removed from the core withou t damage were placed in a specially made shielded sample analysis assembly (Figure F13). Core sections that were too large to be removed were analyzed in situ using a shielded sleeve analyze r mount (Figure F13). In this case, core sections were raised using core holders to ensure good contact between the handheld spectrometer and the sample.  

Real-time pXRF measurements proved invaluable for characterization of extrusive rocks at Site s U1566 and U1571–U1573, where igneous rocks are dominated by aphyric basalts, thus hinderin g more traditional initial unit definition based on petrographic variation. Chemical stratigraph y obtained from pXRF analyses will be used postcruise to identify and define discrete magmati c events in the basaltic sequence.  

Finally, we also used ICP-AES analyses (see Geochemistry) performed on discrete sample s selected from the working halves (Figure F13) to (1) confirm the results of the pXRF analyses an d (2) confirm the lithology compositional names (i.e., picrite, basalt, basaltic andesite, and andesite).  

# 2.9. Structural geology  

This section outlines the methods for documenting structural features observed in cores such a s faults, fractures, fault rocks, shear zones, folds, bedding, and veins. The structural geology observations are directly integrated into the Lithostratigraphy section of each site chapter.  

Structural features observed on the archive half are documented using the following:  

• Identifying structural features and classifying their structural types;   
• Determining the top and bottom location of structural features in the core;   
• Measuring the orientation of a structural feature where applicable;   
• Determining the sense of displacement on a structural feature where applicable;   
• Determining the temporal relation between structures (especially for crosscutting structures and shear zones); and   
• Assessing the role of fluids in deformation processes.  

Our methods largely follow those used by the structural geologists for Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Expedition 344 and Expeditions 349 and 367/368/368X (Harris et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2018). The types of structural measurements and key parameters (either observed o r calculated) are recorded on a spreadsheet (Figure F14). These data are then input into the LIM S database using DESClogik.  

# 2.9.1. Graphic symbols and terminology  

A predefined set of commonly observed structural features was used in the structural descriptio n of cores. The terminology and graphic symbols used are presented in Figure F6. The major structural features identified include the following:  

• Joints and fractures: brittle failure with no displacement and no secondary infill minerals. Breaks clearly resulting from drilling were logged separately as drilling-induced fractures in the Drilling disturbance spreadsheet in DESClogik.   
• Veins: fractures filled with secondary minerals; veins were described in both the Structure and Veins/halos tabs in DESClogik.   
• Fault rocks: brittlely deformed rocks such as fault breccia and fault gouge. For the sake of simplicity, the term “fault breccia” is defined as a clast-supported fault rock with angular clasts, and the term “fault gouge” is defined as a matrix-supported fault rock with rounded clasts in this report.   
• Hydrothermal breccia: fluid-assisted deformation leading to the fragmentation and brecciation of the rocks.   
• Shear zones: zones affected by ductile crystal-plastic deformation, surrounded by less deformed rocks.   
• Folds: folded sedimentary or rock layers.   
• Sedimentary bedding: layering of sediments and sedimentary rocks and igneous contacts were respectively described in the Sediment and Extrusive_hypabyssal tabs in DESClogik.

# 2.9.2. Structural observation and description  

Structural features were described from the top to bottom of each section of the core.  

For fractures, we examined and measured the following parameters:  

• Location: where a fracture occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section.   
• Morphology: morphological shape of a fracture (e.g., straight, curved, banded, irregular, composite, isolated, single, or branched).   
• Displacement: lateral offset and/or opening of a fracture measured in centimeters; a closed fracture with no lateral offset is recorded as $0\,\mathrm{cm}$ of displacement.   
• Orientation: dip angle, strike, and dip direction of a fracture measured in degrees; where applicable, reorientation of a fracture to geographic coordinates (i.e., relative to true north) was done to determine the real dip direction (see Orientation measurements and correction).   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of fractures per section.   
• Types: type of deformation of a fracture (e.g., normal, reverse, dextral, sinistral displacement, or a combination of the above).  

For veins, we examined and measured several parameters (Figure F12):  

• Location: where a vein occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section.   
• Morphology: morphological shape of a vein.   
• Orientation: dip angle and dipping direction of a vein.   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of veins per section.   
• Mineral infill and alteration: these features are recorded as described by petrologists.  

For fault rocks and shear zones, we examined and measured the following parameters:  

• Location: interval where a shear zone occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section. • Nature: type of shear zone (e.g., mylonite, cataclasite, fault gouge, or fault breccia).

• Morphology: morphological shape of the deformed zone and the clasts.   
• Orientation: dip angle and dip direction of the preferred orientation of the clasts, where applicable.   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of shear zones per section.   
• Mineral and alteration: matrix and clasts as described by petrologists.  

For sedimentary bedding, we described the following parameters:  

• Location: where a nonsubhorizontal bedding occurs in a core $(\mathrm{dip}>3^{\circ})$ ), measured in centimeters from the top of the section.   
• Type of contacts: type of sedimentary contact boundary.   
• Orientation: dip angle, strike, and dip direction of sedimentary bedding.  

For folds, we described the following parameters:  

• Location: where a fold contact occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section.   
• Type: type of fold.   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of fold axis per section.  

For igneous contacts, we described the following parameters:  

• Location: where an igneous contact occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section.   
• Type of contacts: type of igneous contact boundary.   
• Orientation: dip angle and dip direction of an igneous contact.   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of igneous contacts per section.   
• Mineral infill and alteration: these features are recorded as described by petrologists.  

All measured data were manually typed into the log sheet together with the measured depths i n the core section and descriptive information (Figure F14). The occurrence frequency of a structure per section is normalized on a $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ section.  

# 2.9.3. Orientation measurements and correction  

# 2.9.3.1. Orientation measurements  

We used a plastic goniometer for orientation measurements. For sealed structures, we wrapped  a transparent plastic protractor template around the core to determine the true dip (Figure F15). Orientations of planar and linear features in a core section were determined relative to the cor e reference frame (Figure F16). The vertical axis of the core reference frame is aligned with th e upcore direction of the core section, and the double line marked on the archive half of the cor e liner is defined as $180^{\circ}$ in the cross-sectional plane perpendicular to the core vertical axis.  

![](images/0585e77ff6cc37ba62fdb7d47c61ee9df695f45ee3be9ddcc431e5b2da66463b.jpg)  
Figure F15. Goniometer and plastic protractor template used to measure dip and dip direction of structures, Expedition 396.  

To determine the orientation of a planar structural element (shaded plane in Figure F16), tw o apparent dips of the element were measured in the core reference frame. The first apparent di p measures the intersection angle between the planar structural element and the split face of th e core $\mathrm{[\beta_{1}}$ in Figure F16); it is determined by measuring the dip direction and angle of the plana r structural element in the core reference frame. A planar structural element could have a trend o f $90^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ and a plunge angle ranging $0^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ}$ . The second apparent dip measures the intersectio n angle between the central line of the planar structural element and the split face of the core $\mathrm{[\beta_{2}}$ i n Figure F16). In most cases, this was a plane either parallel or perpendicular to the core axis. In th e former case, the apparent dip would trend $0^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$ with plunge angle ranging $0^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ}$ ; in the latte r case, the trend would range $0^{\circ}{-}360^{\circ}$ with a plunge angle of $0^{\circ}$ .  

A linear feature observed in the surface of a split core is often associated with a planar structura l element (e.g., a fault plane) in the core; the orientation of the planar structural element is determined by measuring either the rake (or pitch) of the associated plane or the trend and plunge o f the planar element in the core reference frame.  

# 2.9.3.2. Plane orientation calculation  

For a planar structural element (e.g., a bedding or fault plane), two apparent dips on two differen t surfaces (e.g., one being the split core surface, which is east–west vertical, and the other being  a horizontal or north–south vertical surface) were measured in the core reference frame. The tw o apparent dips are the azimuth (measured clockwise from north, looking down) and plunge. An $_{\mathscr{x}}$ , y, $\boldsymbol{z}$ coordinate system was defined in such a way that the positive $x_{\mathrm{-}},y_{\mathrm{-}}$ , and $z$ -directions coincid e with north, east, and vertical downward, respectively. If the azimuths and plunges of the tw o apparent dips are given as $(\alpha_{1},\beta_{1})$ and $(\alpha_{2},\beta_{2})$ , respectively, as in Figure F16, the unit vectors representing these two lines, $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2},$ are given by the following expression:

where $l,m$ , and $_n$ represent the $x_{\mathrm{-}},y_{\mathrm{-}}$ , and $z$ -components of the vectors.  

For any plane, the direction of the normal to the plane can be found by taking the cross product o f two (nonparallel) vectors that lie within the plane. Using the above equations for $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2},$ therefore, the unit vector normal to plane $\left(\nu_{\mathrm{n}}\right)$ (Figure F17) is then defined as follows:

$$  

where

$$

$$

# 3. Biostratigraphy  

Microfossils were examined for most sedimentary core catcher samples, as well as mudline samples from each site and notable intervals from split cores. Organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst s (dinocysts), other categories of palynomorphs, planktonic foraminifers, diatoms, and silicoflagellates provided preliminary shipboard biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental informatio n during Expedition 396. Occurrences of other groups were documented, including ostracods, radiolarians, ebridians, calcareous nannofossils, benthic foraminifers, and ichthyoliths. These wer e utilized for their paleoenvironmental significance. Postcruise analysis of some of these groups b y approved shore-based colleagues to refine biostratigraphic control is likely. Several microfossi l groups will be analyzed in the postcruise period as carriers of important geochemical signals, especially in key intervals.  

Shipboard paleontologists also documented occurrences of transported terrestrially derive d microfossils, including pollen, spores, and associated terrestrial kerogen debris and siliceous phytoliths and freshwater diatoms. Fossils identifiable as brackish water or coastal taxa were also documented. Additional microfossil groups encountered during shipboard analysis were noted, a s were known older microfossils reworked into younger strata.  

Methods employed for each group are described below, including sample processing, taxonomi c frameworks, and literature sources and calibrations used to establish preliminary age assessments. Working with the shipboard paleomagnetic data, we establish tentative correlations to the timescale of Gradstein et al. (2012) (GTS2012). Age assignments were based on analyses of microfossil s from all mudline and core catcher samples. Additional discrete samples from split core section s were analyzed to refine biostratigraphic boundaries (e.g., across lithologic transitions).  

The Paleogene epochs are in this publication divided into Early/Middle/Late intervals as follows: Oligocene (Early: Rupelian; Late: Chattian), Eocene (Early: Ypresian; Middle: Lutetian, Bartonian; Late: Priabonian), and Paleocene (Early: Danian; Middle: Selandian; Late: Thanetian). Similarly, the series are divided into Lower/Middle/Upper intervals.  

The Biostratigraphy section in each site chapter presents a summary of biostratigraphical information, paleoenvironmental interpretation provided by each microfossil group, and information regarding approaches and literature used to guide taxonomic identifications. Data for each microfossil group are presented in the form of abundance and taxonomic distribution charts that record occurrences of key taxa observed in samples from each hole. Taxonomic occurrence charts also record suspected upsection reworking or other stratigraphic displacement such as erosion and downslope transport.  

Occurrences of biostratigraphically important taxa, as well as relative abundance and preservation data, were entered through the DESClogik application into the IODP LIMS database for identified microfossil taxa and paleontological data gathered during shipboard investigations. These data are available from the LIMS database in accordance with IODP policy.  

Distribution charts for microfossil groups presented in each site chapter are based exclusively on shipboard analysis. Shipboard biostratigraphic studies focused primarily on the identification of biostratigraphic events in the cores and are biased toward the reporting of age diagnostic species and identifying intervals and ages of reworking. Events reported include the first occurrence (FO) and last occurrence (LO) of a taxon’s stratigraphic range, in some cases with modification to identify the last common/abundant appearance datum (LCAD/LAAD) or first common/abundant appearance datum (FCAD/FAAD) to identify an abundance change within a taxon’s range. Where possible, identification of a sequence of biohorizons in stratigraphic order were used to assign biostratigraphic zones and subzones to previously established schemes. A summary table of the main microfossil occurrences at each site is presented in the site chapters. The chronostratigraphic compilation provides a framework for estimating sediment accumulation rates, identifying hiatuses, guiding correlation between holes, and assessing recovery as compared with the Scientific Prospectus. All age models presented in this volume are preliminary and will be subject to revision following postcruise research updates.  

Biochronologic age assessments were shared with the paleomagnetism team and utilized in stratigraphic correlation and the construction of age-depth plots to assess sediment accumulation rates and hiatuses.  

# 3.1. Siliceous microfossils  

# 3.1.1. Taxonomy and dating  

Diatoms, silicoflagellates, ebridians, endoskeletal dinoflagellates, and other small biosiliceous phytoplankton fossils (excluding radiolarians and sponge spicules) were analyzed from the same sample preparations for preliminary age control and paleoenvironmental interpretation.  

Taxonomic concepts and biostratigraphic constraints for these groups, many of which may be endemic to the high-latitude North Atlantic, have developed through 50 y of stratigraphic drilling and more than $100{\mathrm{~y~}}$ of analysis of some Paleogene diatomites exposed in several land sections. Scherer et al. (2007) summarized regional and global Cenozoic diatom biostratigraphic schemes and zonations for the major ocean basins, but chronostratigraphic dating of many these events was still largely in development until recently, with efforts to calibrate both Neogene and Paleogene diatom events and zones to the GTS2012 and subsequent updates to the timescale of Gradstein et al. (2020) (GTS2020). The most up-to-date correlations to the GTS2012 is an ongoing database maintained by Dr. John Barron (J. Barron, pers. comm., 2021), built and continuously revised  from that published by Lazarus et al. (2014; available via the JANUS database [http://www-odp.tamu.edu/database]). The most up-to-date version of this database has been provided to the LIMS database (September 2021), and updates will be published in the JANUS database (J. Barron, pers. comm., 2021). This database currently contains 475 FO and LO diatom datums. It is focused on the Southern Ocean but contains many global datums.  

Recent detailed taxonomic work with biostratigraphic correlations by Witkowski (2018) and colleagues (Witkowski et al., 2020a) have significantly advanced Lower Paleogene diatom biostratigraphy. Unfortunately, many of the taxa discussed in these recent works are absent from the  

Norwegian Sea deposits recovered during Expedition 396, indicating that there is more provincialism in the Paleogene than has often been assumed (Scherer et al., 2007; Witkowski, 2018).  

For Expedition 396, we drew heavily on results of prior regional drilling on the Vøring Plateau, including work on Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 38 Sites 336–342 by Schrader and Fenner (1976), who developed the first regional diatom zonation based on spot cored and often poorly recovered sections. This work was augmented by Dzinoridze et al. (1978). Later drilling on the Vøring Plateau as part of ODP Leg 104 yielded biostratigraphic research on Neogene silicoflagellates and ebridians (Ciesielski and Case, 1989; Ciesielski et al., 1989; Locker and Martini, 1989), but little detailed stratigraphic work on diatoms has been published. Other diatom research from the circum-North Atlantic and beyond helped construct diatom zonations for the Neogene (Koç and Scherer, 1996) and late Paleogene (Scherer and Koç, 1996), but these stratigraphic sections are also incomplete and do not extend into strata older than latest Eocene (Scherer and Koç, 1996).  

Recent advances in Atlantic biostratigraphy include extending calibration into the Paleogene, like the work of Barron et al. (2015), who compiled global distributions of Eocene diatoms and silicoflagellates. Witkowski et al. (2020a) focused on the western North Atlantic (Blake Nose) for calibration of Eocene datums, and Renaudie et al. (2018) presented a brief compilation of the global distribution of key Paleocene marine diatoms.  

Recognized Lower Paleogene diatom assemblages and species successions of Paleocene and Lower Eocene (including the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum [PETM]) in recovered materials most closely correspond to exposures and wells on the Russian Platform (Oreshkina and Aleksandrova, 2007; Oreshkina and Radionova, 2014) and the Fur Formation of Denmark (Homann, 1991; Fenner, 1994). These publications proved very useful during recovery of similar aged materials of Expedition 396, but most of these are not closely calibrated to independent timescales, although such efforts are underway, especially with regard to new dating of ashes in the Fur Formation.  

# 3.1.2. Methods for diatoms, silicoflagellates, ebridians, and other siliceous flagellates  

Smear slides provide a useful guide to subsequent sediment processing because they provide unadulterated views of the sediment. Smear slides were used for initial characterization of occurrences of biosiliceous components and calcareous nannofossils and were prepared at every interval analyzed, including core catchers and split core samples. They were used both for initial biostratigraphic analysis and as a guide to methods to be employed to concentrate and enhance production of biostratigraphic data. A toothpick sample of sediment was placed on a $22{\mathrm{~mm}}\times40$ mm coverslip, coated to break surface tension, as described by Scherer (1994), wetted with deionized water, disaggregated as much as possible, and spread in a thin coating and dried on a hot plate. When dried, each sample was permanently affixed to a microscope slide using Norland optical adhesive Number 61 (refractive index $=1.56)$ and cured under ultraviolet light. Samples included all sedimentary core catchers and numerous samples from intervals of interest from the split cores.  

Most sediment core catchers that contain biosilica were processed to concentrate biosiliceous components. Most samples, which typically have an ${\sim}2~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ initial size, were processed in 125 or $250~\mathrm{mL}$ beakers. Indurated sediments were initially crushed to granule-sized components and placed in the beakers with $10\%$ hydrogen peroxide $(\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2})$ to oxidize organics and disaggregate sediments. Carbonate was rare in most samples, so there was no need to use HCl. Likewise, the use of dispersing salts (e.g., sodium hexametaphosphate $(\mathrm{Na}_{6}[(\mathrm{PO}_{3})_{6}])$ or sodium tetraborate [borax] $(\mathrm{Na_{2}[B_{4}O_{5}(O H)_{4}]{\cdot}8H_{2}O)}$ ) was mostly not needed with Expedition 396 sediments. Several samples contained no remaining biosilica but did include diatoms replaced by pyrite. To prepare these, clays were dispersed with Calgon solution and then sieved as described below. When the $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{2}$ reaction was complete and the sample was chemically neutralized by dilution and decanting, strewn slides of unsieved material were prepared. Aliquots of selected samples were then sieved using either a $15~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ nylon, $20~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ stainless steel, or $38~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ stainless steel sieve to remove fragmented diatoms and concentrate biostratigraphic markers.  

We acknowledge that this approach likely increased the presence of larger, more heavily silicified species and reduced numbers of potentially biostratigraphically important, smaller diatoms from these slides. However, this approach was deemed essential for providing a sufficient number of specimens to allow rapid age interpretation of core catcher samples. Furthermore, both smear and strewn slide preparations were analyzed. All slides were mounted on cover glasses and permanently fixed to labeled glass slides using Norland adhesive and cured under an ultraviolet lamp.  

Samples prepared for diatom analysis were examined using a Zeiss Axioskop transmitted-light microscope. Photomicrographs were taken using a SPOT Flex $64~\mathrm{Mp}$ digital camera. A Hitachi TM3000 tabletop scanning electron microscope (SEM) was utilized to analyze sedimentary microstructure in a laminated diatomite. Qualitative siliceous microfossil group abundances were determined from smear slides using $630\times$ magnification. Care was taken to ensure smear slides were prepared with similar amounts of sediment to ensure consistency.  

Visual estimates of percentages followed standard guidelines (e.g., Rothwell, 2012) (Table T2). For each sample, the following abundances of diatoms were qualitatively estimated by light microscopic observations with the examination of five random fields of view (FOVs):  

• $\mathbf{B}=$ barren: no diatom debris.   
• $\mathrm{T}=$ trace: trace quantities $(<\!1\%)$ occur. Trace quantities generally means that there is some evidence that diatoms had been present, but because of recrystallization or extreme fragmentation they are of no use for biostratigraphic interpretation.   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(1\%-5\%$ diatoms). Some biostratigraphic application may be possible, but only with further processing.   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $(5\%{-}10\%$ diatoms). Typically, only heavily silicified diatoms are present, but they may provide some biostratigraphic information.   
• $C=$ common ( $10\%{-}20\%$ diatoms). Biostratigraphic analysis is possible.   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $520\%$ diatoms).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ mass abundance (nearly pure diatoms, usually with strong dominance of a single species). Mass occurrence can exist with excellent preservation or may include partial recrystallization of the assemblage, which may limit identification.  

The following relative abundances of individual taxa (including diatoms and silicoflagellates) were categorized in reference to their occurrence in FOVs or to a traverse across a $40\,\mathrm{mm}$ wide coverslip $_{\sim100\;\mathrm{FOVs}}$ at $630\times$ magnification):  

• $\mathrm{T}=$ trace $_{<1}$ specimen per 5 average horizontal transects $[40\;\mathrm{mm}]$ ).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen within 1–5 transects).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few (1–5 specimens per transect).   
• $C=$ common (1–5 specimens per ${\sim}5$ FOVs).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (2 or more specimens per FOV).   
• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant (the taxon represents ${>}50\%$ of all diatoms in diatom-rich samples).  

Preservation of diatoms and silicoflagellates was qualitatively assessed with regard to both the degree of dissolution and fragmentation. The degree of siliceous microfossil fragmentation often mirrors dissolution, but the two factors are not always directly correlated. Diatoms with wellpreserved fine structures can be highly fragmented. Dissolution is a wholly chemical/diagenetic process (Warnock and Scherer, 2015), but fragmentation can be dominantly or entirely due to mechanical processes (Scherer et al., 2004). Fragmentation of finely silicified diatoms can occur in sediments as a result of digestion by grazers and deposition in fecal pellets or by compaction of diatomite from overburden.

The degree of diatom dissolution was qualitatively graded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{low}$ (slight to no apparent dissolution and fine structures generally preserved). • $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (some dissolution and fine structures generally lost). • $\mathrm{{H}=\mathrm{{high}}}$ (severe effects of dissolution, including widened areolae, relatively abundant margins and cingula compared with valves, and notably higher proportions of heavily silicified forms).  

The degree of fragmentation was graded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{low}$ (a majority of valves are unbroken).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate $(>\!50\%$ of diatom valves are broken, but most are identifiable).   
• $\mathsf{H}=\mathrm{high}$ (valves highly fragmented with very few complete valves present, hampering identification).  

Shipboard data for the initial report integrate fragmentation and dissolution and report diatom preservation as good (G), moderate (M), and poor (P) for samples containing identifiable diatoms.  

# 3.1.3. Diatom age assignment  

Initial shipboard diatom age assignment of individual Paleogene and Neogene samples was based on identification of primary and secondary diatom datum events, many of which are calibrated for the Neogene, and fewer for the Paleogene. The best calibrated occurrences are for the Southern Ocean and low latitudes; thus, a degree of uncertainty currently exists for these datums. Consequently, shipboard age assignments based on diatoms, especially for the Paleogene, are considered supplementary to better calibrated dinocyst biostratigraphy. Published diatom biostratigraphic zones were informally assigned, where possible, but postcruise analysis will lead to modification of existing schemes.  

No continuous, published, well-dated stratigraphic succession of biosiliceous sediments exists for the high-latitude North Atlantic. Schrader and Fenner (1976) developed an Eocene through Miocene high-latitude North Atlantic diatom zonation for the Vøring Plateau based on poorly dated and discontinuous materials recovered during Leg 38, much of which was spot cored. Dzinoridze et al. (1978) added additional biostratigraphic and taxonomic data on these cores. Scherer and Koç (1996) and Koç and Scherer (1996) updated the zonation of Schrader and Fenner (1976) to include 11 Neogene and 13 upper Paleogene diatom zones based on cores from ODP Leg 151 Site 908 on the Hovgård Ridge, Fram Strait, and Site 913 on the East Greenland Margin. Much of the Cenozoic record is missing and none of the pre-Pleistocene section from these cores included a good paleomagnetic record at the time, so dating of these zones is relative. More recently, Suto (2003, 2004) and Suto et al. (2008, 2009, 2011) contributed new biostratigraphic data based on resting spores, expanding on similar studies from the North Pacific. Diatomaceous Eocene sediments have been recovered from the Lomonosov Ridge in the high Arctic with taxa comparable to some Norwegian Sea assemblages (Suto et al., 2009). Additionally, there are some notable terrestrial exposures of diatomaceous Lower Eocene sediments from Denmark’s Fur Formation (Homann, 1991; Fenner, 1994) and Paleocene and Lower Eocene deposits on the Eurasian Plateau (Strelnikova, 1992; Oreshkina and Radionova, 2014; Oreshkina and Aleksandrova, 2007; Aleksandrova et al., 2012; Radionova and Khokhlova, 1994, 2000). These assemblages mostly reflect neritic plankton with abundant resting spores (Suto, 2003, 2004, 2005; Suto et al., 2011). Recent work by Witkowski (2018) and Witkowski et al. (2012, 2015, 2020a, 2020b) added significant detail to dating key Eocene intervals in the North Atlantic, with improvements in both dating and taxonomic definition of key species, but many of the identified datums could not initially be applied to Expedition 396 materials.  

# 3.2. Palynology  

# 3.2.1. Sample processing  

Several processing methods may be employed depending on, for example, biogenic or detrital silica concentrations, the relative compaction and silicification, and/or whether conditions on th e ship were deemed safe enough (e.g., no rough seas) to use hydrofluoric acid (HF).  

# 3.2.1.1. Simple non–hydrofluoric acid method with HCl only  

Approximately $10{-}20~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ $({\sim}10{-}20\ \mathrm{g})$ of soft, clay-rich material is treated with $10\%$ HCl to dissolve the bulk of the carbonate using a disaggregation/sieving method described in Riding an d Kyffin-Hughes (2011), specifically, density separation in an ultrasonic bath.  

# 3.2.1.2. Hydrofluoric acid method  

Approximately $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ $\left({\sim}10\ \mathrm{g}\right)$ of material is taken for HF processing, for which we followe d standard palynological laboratory protocols (Brinkhuis et al., 2004). Carbonate-rich samples wer e first treated with HCl to dissolve the bulk of the carbonate before further digestion with HF. Carbonate-lean samples were digested with cold $48\%$ HF to dissolve carbonates and silicates, followe d by a step with $30\%$ HCl to remove silicate gels. Finally, the samples were rinsed with demineralize d (or deionized or tap) water to neutralize any remaining acids. After each of these steps, sample s were centrifuged and supernatants were decanted. The organic residues were then sieved t o remove large (phytoclasts and palynodebris) and small particles (amorphous organic matter an d minor amounts of clays, usually phyllosilicates) using 250 and $15~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ nylon sieves and an ultrasonic bath. The ${>}250\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction was used for cuticle analysis where feasible, and the smaller fraction $(15{-}250~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ was concentrated again using a centrifuge and mounted on glass microscop e slides using glycerine jelly (refractive index $=1.47^{\circ}$ ) as the mounting medium. Finally, the cove r slides were sealed with nail varnish for more permanent conservation.  

# 3.2.2. Marine palynological associations (palynofacies)  

The acid-resistant residue, or palynofacies, of a given sample after the processing described above, incorporates (1) palynodebris, specifically, fragments of larger multicellular entities or related elements (e.g., from bits and pieces of plant tissue to remains of resin droplets) and (2) palynomorphs, identifiable (semi)complete elements, or remains of uni- or multicellular biota. The latter are composed of both aquatic elements (freshwater and/or marine derived) and terrestrial component s such as elements related to higher plants (spores, gymnosperm pollen, and angiosperm pollen), sometimes including remnants of freshwater plants (e.g., the massulae and glochidia of freshwate r ferns like those from Azolla spp.) (e.g., Brinkhuis et al., 2006; Barke et al., 2011), various funga l remains, or even animal-derived bits and pieces (e.g., jaws of marine worms, so-called scolecodonts, and various insect remains). The aquatic fresh- to brackish water elements may include single-celled palynomorphs such as Cymatiosphaera, Pterospermella, and Tasmanites spp.; cysts o f freshwater dinoflagellates; and multicellular (colonial) forms such as Pediastrum, Palambages, an d Botryococcus spp. The marine portion typically consists of organic-walled dinocysts of either gonyaulacoid or (proto)peridinioid dinoflagellates and various organic-walled microfossils of unknow n affinity (so-called Acritarchs), but it may also yield remains of many other marine microbiota, including, but not limited to, the inner linings of benthic foraminifers and tintinnid loricae.  

# 3.2.2.1. (Semi)quantitative palynofacies analysis  

Palynofacies analysis and data collection was carried out using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope wit h brightfield illumination at $400\times$ , $630\times$ (oil), and $1000\times$ (oil) magnification. For each sample, one 2 2 $\mathrm{mm}\times40\,\mathrm{mm}$ slide was scanned and semiquantitatively ( $^+$ to $+++,$ ) characterized for palynodebri s categories (see below) and counted to ${\geq}200$ palynomorphs (Table T3).  

Photomicrography was conducted using a SPOT Flex digital camera, and images were uploaded t o the LIMS database.  

The following broad palynodebris categories were employed:  

• Black phytoclasts, • Brown phytoclasts, • Plant tissue general, • Leaf/cuticle remains, • Amorphous organic matter (aggregates), • Amorphous organic matter (filaments), • Transparent filaments/fungal affinity, • Opaque elements of unknown affinity, • Pyritized microfossils, and • Indeterminable elements (palynomorphs).  

The following palynomorph categories were employed:  

• In situ dinocysts $(\ge\!0.5$ cyst) (determined to group to species level), • Operculae of dinocysts,   
• Indeterminable (likely) remains of dinocysts (fragments),   
• Reworked marine dinocysts (and ages),   
• Organic linings of (benthic) foraminifers,   
• Acritarchs (various groups),   
• In situ pollen and spores,   
• Reworked pollen and spores,   
• Massulae and seeds/eggs of Azolla spp.,   
• Single-celled brackish/freshwater palynomorphs,   
• Multicelled brackish/freshwater palynomorphs, and   
• Indeterminable elements (palynomorphs).  

Palynomorph preservation, focused on the in situ dinocysts, was qualitatively classified as one o f the following levels:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (little or no evidence of degradation or oxidation).   
• $M=$ moderate (some evidence of degradation or oxidation).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbf{r}$ (major degradation or oxidation has occurred).  

The palynomorph categories are counted to a total of (a minimum of) 200 specimens and are reported in percentages of the total palynomorph count. If the first 200 palynomorphs containe d fewer than 100 in situ identifiable dinocysts, palynomorph counting continued until a minimum o f 100 in situ identifiable dinocysts were found.  

Above the (minimum of) 200 palynomorph and 100 in situ dinocyst count, remaining materia l were entirely scanned for rare and stratigraphically important taxa, and these are reported irrespective of their abundance (present [p]). Furthermore, the abundance of taxa, genera, and group s were employed for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. It is common practice (cf. Pross an d Brinkhuis, 2005; Sluijs et al., 2005) to group taxa that are morphologically related and/or have similar ecological affinities into “ecogroups” (see Environmental reconstructions using dinocyst s and palynofacies). Like the palynomorph assemblage, we report the relative dinocyst abundanc e in percentages for select groups. Grouping of taxa to their ecological preference and morpholog y is based on extensive previous work (e.g., Brinkhuis, 1994; Pross and Brinkhuis, 2005; Sluijs et al., 2005; Sluijs and Brinkhuis, 2009; Frieling and Sluijs, 2018).

# 3.3. Organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst taxonomy and age assignments  

The dinocyst taxonomy generally follows that cited in Williams et al. (2017a), except for member s of the subfamily Wetzelielloideae (see Williams et al. [2015], comments by Bijl et al. [2017], an d reply by Williams et al. [2017b]).  

Mesozoic–Cenozoic chronostratigraphically important dinocyst events, mostly FOs and LOs o f genera and species, have been widely documented, and over the past decades these events hav e been relatively well calibrated against meaningful chronostratigraphic information (for an overview see, e.g., Williams et al., 2004). Many of these FO/LO events have global significance, bu t others have been shown to be hemispheric or more regional in nature. It is therefore important t o compare shipboard generated data with the large body of previous dinocyst work from the Nort h Atlantic region, including the Norwegian Margin, and palynological studies using core materia l from earlier expeditions to the Vøring Plateau (e.g., Boulter and Manum, 1989; Mudie, 1989; Eldrett et al., 2004). Here, we employ the latest global and regional compilations (Bijl, 2022), wherein dinocyst events are calibrated against the GTS2012.  

Available Neogene North Atlantic regional “oceanic” dinocyst events and (informal) zonations are, at best, tied to magnetic reversals and a limited number of nannofossil datums (de Schepper an d Head, 2009; Schreck et al., 2012). More nearshore accounts were established for the Danish (Dybkjær et al., 2021) and Dutch North Sea area (Munsterman and Brinkhuis, 2004), but these are eve n less well calibrated compared to the oceanic records. For the Paleogene, an extensive range o f North Atlantic and North Sea dinocyst events has been documented (e.g., Mudge and Bujak, 1994; Mudge and Bujak, 1996a, 1996b; Bujak and Brinkhuis, 1998; Eldrett et al., 2004; Eldrett and Harding, 2009; Eldrett et al., 2019; Vieira et al., 2020), many of which, notably Eocene and younger, ar e well calibrated against magnetostratigraphy, nannofossil, and foraminifer datums (e.g., Eldrett e t al., 2004, 2019). The various transient, globally approximately synchronous, stable carbon isotop e excursions provide tight constraints on the absolute and relative datums of dinocyst events, notably during the early Paleogene hyperthermals, including the PETM (Crouch et al., 2001; Sluijs an d Brinkhuis, 2009; Harding et al., 2011; Kender et al., 2012).  

Aside from biochronostratigraphic purposes, shipboard quantitative marine palynological analysis included palynofacies assemblage characterization in terms of paleoenvironment.  

# 3.4. Environmental reconstructions using dinocysts and palynofacies  

Both dinocysts and the general composition of the palynofacies present useful insights for reconstruction of paleoenvironments (e.g., Brinkhuis, 1994; Batten, 1996). Organic-walled cyst-producing dinoflagellates are sensitive to even minor changes in their physical and biochemica l environment, and assemblage characteristics can be used to qualitatively and semiquantitativel y reconstruct a range of ancient environmental parameters and conditions, including salinity, shor e proximity (paleodepth), productivity, upwelling, and temperature. Ecological preferences of extan t species are well documented using modern core-top data (Zonneveld et al., 2013; Marret et al., 2020), whereas, for extinct species, researchers have utilized independent proxy data and fiel d observations to assign groups of taxa (ecogroups) to specific paleoenvironmental condition s (Pross and Brinkhuis, 2005; Sluijs et al., 2005; Barke et al., 2011; Hennissen et al., 2017; Frieling an d Sluijs, 2018). These studies allowed us to make coarse, low-resolution, environmental reconstructions for all cores that yielded sufficiently well preserved dinocyst assemblages and palynofacies.  

# 3.5. Thermal alteration  

Thermal alteration indexes (TAIs) based on progressive discoloration of palynomorphs fro m transparent to yellow, brown, and black are useful first-order estimators of sedimentary organi c matter maturity. Various factors contribute to organic matter thermal maturation, but most ofte n thermal alteration of organic matter results from deep burial. However, sediments in the clos e vicinity of erupting (flood) basalts and intruded volcanic rocks may also undergo rapid maturatio n (Pross et al., 2007; Aarnes et al., 2011). We monitored the thermal alteration of recovered palynomorphs, both in situ and reworked dinocysts and pollen. The influence of thermal alteration o n the palynomorphs from intrabasalt sediments, such as those recovered from ODP Site 642 E (Boulter and Manum, 1989; Abdelmalak et al., 2016), and the subbasalt sediments on the Kolg a High (Sites U1565 and U1566) show short-term interactions between volcanic and sedimentar y deposits. Lastly, reports have shown the presence of mature organic matter in the hydrotherma l crater sediments (Svensen et al., 2004; Frieling et al., 2016). For these sites (U1567 and U1568), th e TAIs provided a first line of evidence for when the main thermal alteration of the sediments, as  a result of hot fluid or gas venting, took place.  

# 3.6. Foraminifers  

# 3.6.1. Planktonic foraminiferal taxonomy and biozonation schemes  

Quaternary and Neogene planktonic foraminifer taxonomy follow Kennett and Srinivasan (1983), Spiegler and Jansen (1989), and Spiegler (1996). Paleogene planktonic foraminifer taxonomy follow Wade et al. (2011) modified from Pearson et al. (2006) and Wade et al. (2018).  

High-latitude planktonic foraminiferal associations comprise low-diversity and long-ranged species (Spiegler and Jansen, 1989; Spiegler, 1996). Because of this, local zonation schemes of OD P Legs 104 and 162 are utilized for the Miocene to Quaternary (Spiegler and Jansen, 1989; Spiegler, 1996). Wade et al. (2011) modified from Pearson et al. (2006) zonation schemes are utilized for th e Paleocene–Oligocene.  

# 3.6.2. Foraminifer sample preparation and analysis  

Sediment samples $({\sim}10{-}20~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ ) were placed in a $200~\mathrm{mL}$ beaker of water, disaggregated, washe d over a $63~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ sieve, and then dried in an oven at ${\sim}45^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . A $10\%$ hydrogen peroxide solution wa s used to aid in the disaggregation of the sediment because of the abundance of clay in samples. Th e dried sand fraction was weighed and then sifted through a USA Standard Sieve Series $150{-}250\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ to separate the dry material into the desired size range needed for identification and classification. All size fractions will be preserved for further exploration of the processed sediment material.  

The samples were observed under a binocular light microscope after drying. Specimens wer e picked using a 0000 brush and mounted on a gridded micromount slide. A sieved sample, including mineral matter (sand and larger clasts) was made available to the lithostratigraphy team afte r foraminifers were picked. Specimen images were taken using either SEM or the digital camer a attached to the binocular microscope.  

# 3.6.3. Microscopy and identification  

A Zeiss Discovery V8 binocular light microscope was used for foraminifer species identification. Images were taken using SPOT Idea digital camera and uploaded to the LIMS database. Foraminifer species identifications utilized the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction. Time permitting, an analysis of th e $38{-}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction was conducted for small or rare species.  

The preservation states of planktonic foraminifers are defined by evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, abrasion, and fragmentation (Table T4):  

• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}=}$ excellent (specimen have little to no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, abrasion, or fragmentation). • $\mathrm{VG}=$ very good (some minor evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, abrasion, or fragmentation).

• $\mathbf{G}=$ good (little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, abrasion, or fragmentation).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (common but minor calcite overgrowth, dissolution, abrasion, or fragmentation).   
• $\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbf{r}$ (considerable overgrowth, dissolution, abrasion, or fragmentation).  

Abundances of total planktonic foraminifers are categorized as follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $550\%$ foraminifers).   
• $C=$ common $(25\%{-}50\%$ foraminifers).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ frequent $10\%{-}25\%$ foraminifers).   
• $\mathrm{T}=$ trace $(5{-}10\%$ foraminifers).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(5\%$ foraminifers).   
• $\mathbf{B}=$ barren (no foraminifers found in sample).  

# 3.7. Ostracods  

Dry samples prepared for foraminifer examination also were examined for the presence of ostracods at selected sites. Ostracod assignments follow Ducasse and Peypouquet (1979), Coles an d Whatley (1989), Malz (1989), Coles et al. (1994), Guernet and Bellier (2000), Aumond et al. (2009), Alvarez Zarikian (2009, 2015), Yamaguchi (2018), Yamaguchi and Norris (2012), and Yamaguchi e t al. (2017a, 2017b). Species identification was made routinely on core catcher samples and occasionally on samples taken from selected working-half sections.  

# 3.7.1. Ostracod abundance estimates  

The following ostracod abundance categories relative to total sediment particles ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ wer e estimated from visual examination of the dried sample (Table T5):  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant ( $530\%$ of total sediment particles).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!10\%{-}30\%$ of total sediment particles).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few $>\!5\%$ to $c10\%$ of total sediment particles).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(>\!1\%$ to ${<}5\%$ of total sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $1\%$ of total sediment particles).   
• $\mathbf{B}=$ barren.  

The number of individuals of each ostracod species was categorized as follows:  

• $\mathbf{D}=$ dominant $530\%$ of benthic assemblage).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!10\%{-}30\%$ of benthic assemblage).   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{F}}=$ few ${\times}1\%$ to $c10\%$ of benthic assemblage).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ present $1\%$ of benthic assemblage).  

Ostracod preservation was estimated using the following definitions:  

• $\mathrm{VG}=$ very good (valves translucent; no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{G}=$ good (valves semitranslucent; little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (common but minor calcite overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ poor (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, or fragmentation of the valves).

# 4. Paleomagnetism  

Shipboard paleomagnetic investigations were conducted on both the archive and working halve s of cores recovered during Expedition 396. The primary objectives were to determine directions o f natural remanent magnetization (NRM) components, including magnetic polarity, and downhol e variation of magnetic properties. The goal of these experiments was to place chronological constraints on the timing of magnetization as a function of stratigraphy.  

Shipboard paleomagnetic investigations combined three complementary approaches: (1) NR M measurement and in-line alternating field (AF) demagnetization of the NRM of archive-half sections on the pass-through 2G Enterprises (Model 760R-4K) superconducting rock magnetomete r (SRM), (2) measurement and AF demagnetization of oriented discrete samples on the spinne r magnetometer (AGICO Model JR6), and (3) measurement of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) in low field $\left(300\,\mathrm{A/m}\right)$ on discrete samples using the AGICO KLY 4S Kappabridge.  

The discrete sampling strategy was adjusted based on lithology (sediments versus basement), typ e of drilling used (e.g., soft sediments can be disturbed by RCB and XCB coring to the point of bein g unusable for magnetic inclination), and recovery rate. For hard materials, discrete cube sample s $(\sim\!20\ \mathrm{mm})$ were collected from the central part of working-half sections to reduce the effect o f drilling disturbance. For soft materials, plastic boxes were used to extract sediment from the core. For basement rocks, at least one cube was collected per major lithostratigraphic unit (as define d by petrologists) to characterize the magnetic properties, magnetic grain size distributions, an d deformation of these units. These data were used to construct the shipboard magnetostratigraphi c timescale. Because of the relatively low recovery in basement, hard rock samples were used t o measure porosity and moisture (i.e., discrete samples were shared with the physical propertie s team during this expedition).  

Section-half and discrete data, collected using the pass-through SRM and spinner magnetometer, respectively, were uploaded to the LIMS database. We then analyzed the stepwise demagnetization data of the discrete samples using principal component analysis (PCA) to define the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) (Kirschvink, 1980). Data visualization (Zijdervel d demagnetization plots and equal area projections) and PCA were conducted using the Remasof t 3.0 software (Chadima and Hrouda, 2006).  

# 4.1. Archive-half section magnetic measurements  

The remanent magnetization of archive-half sections was measured using a pass-through SR M equipped with direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (DC-SQUIDs) an d an in-line, automated three-axis AF demagnetizer capable of reaching a peak field of $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ .  

Measurement of archive halves was conducted using the SRM software (IMS-SRM Version 10.2 ) and assumed a sample area of $17.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for conversion to volume-normalized magnetization unit s $(\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m})$ . The interval between NRM measurement points was $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ , and measurements occurre d at a speed of $10\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s}$ . The response functions for the pick-up coils of the DC-SQUID sensors hav e a full width of $7.25{-}8.8\,\mathrm{cm}$ at half height. Therefore, data collected within less than ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{cm}$ of piec e boundaries (or voids) can be significantly affected by edge effects and must be treated with caution.  

We performed successive AF demagnetizations using the SRM in-line AF demagnetizer on al l archive-half sections. The in-line AF demagnetizer applies a field to the $x_{\mathrm{~}},\,y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ , and $z\cdot$ -axes of th e SRM in this fixed order (Figure F19). Considering this limitation, we only used demagnetizatio n steps up to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ to demagnetize the sections. For most of the sediment sections we performe d 3–6 steps from NRM up to 15 or $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ depending on time constraints imposed by the rate of cor e recovery. For basement rocks, we adopted a set of narrower AF steps of $2\,\mathrm{mT}$ from NRM to $10\,\mathrm{mT}$ and steps of $5~\mathrm{mT}$ from 10 to $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ . AF demagnetization results were plotted individually as vector plots (Zijderveld, 1967) and as downhole variations with depth. We inspected the plots visuall y to evaluate whether the remanence after demagnetization at the highest AF step reflects th e ChRM and geomagnetic polarity sequence. We used the directional and intensity data of archivehalf sections (measured at $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ ) to determine magnetic polarity along the core. Directional an d intensity data from discrete samples were used to validate the polarities inferred from sectio n measurements. Directional data were analyzed using Zijderveld diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967). Th e ChRM direction(s) were determined using the Remasoft 3.0 software.  

Low-field MS (κ) measured on whole-round sections using the WRMSL and archive-half section s using the SHMSL (see Physical properties) were used to assess the concentration of magneti c minerals and determine the downhole relative paleointensity $\mathbf{\left(NRM/\kappa\right)}$ . These whole-roun d records of MS were compared to visual features in the section halves to identify possible artifacts.  

The magnetic intensity of marine sediments generally reflects the intensity of the geomagneti c field at the time of deposition, the nature and concentration of magnetic minerals (e.g., magnetit e versus hematite), and any possible postdepositional disturbance due to drilling or bioturbation.  

# 4.2. Discrete sample magnetic measurements  

Discrete samples were measured on the spinner magnetometer. These samples were subjected t o AF demagnetization treatments using both the 2G in-line AF demagnetizer (as described above ) and the standalone DTECH (Model D-2000) AF demagnetizer. Because the resultant demagnetization behavior of the discrete samples becomes noisy at higher AFs, measurement using the SR M is not recommended for discrete samples. The routine AF demagnetization treatment was performed using the DTECH (Model D-2000) AF demagnetizer. In addition, to avoid contaminatio n by the ambient magnetic field during shipboard measurements, two cylindrical mu-metal shield s provided a suitable low-field environment for temporary sample storage.  

Oriented discrete samples were collected preferentially in fine-grained sedimentary interval s where drilling deformation was minimal. In soft sediment, oriented discrete samples were taken i n plastic Natsuhara-Giken sampling cubes (sample volume $=~7~\,\mathrm{{cm}}^{3},$ ) (Figure F19). Cubes wer e pushed into the working half of the core with the “up” arrow on the cube pointing upsection in th e core, occasionally using a rubber mallet. In lithified sediments and hard rocks, $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ cubes (sampl e volume $=8\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ ) were cut using the parallel saw.

Measurement positions in AGICO JR-6A spinner magnetometer. E. Example of sawn discrete cube sample and discrete sample in plastic Natsuhara-Giken sampling box.  

Incremental AF demagnetization of discrete samples was performed using the DTECH A F demagnetizer (Model D-2000) at fields up to 45 or $50~\mathrm{mT}$ for low-coercivity samples and 120 o r $200\;\mathrm{mT}$ for high-coercivity samples. The ratio of magnetization remaining after AF demagnetization to $20~\mathrm{mT}$ and NRM $(I_{20\mathrm{mT}}/\mathrm{NRM})$ was used as a proxy for degree of coercivity. Samples wit h $I_{20\mathrm{mT}}/\mathrm{NRM}>1.0$ were not included in the graphs. AMS was measured on an AGICO KLY 4S Kappabridge at a field of $300\,\mathrm{A/m}$ using the SUFAR (AGICO) software. The KLY 4S Kappabridge measures AMS by rotating the sample along three axes, stacking the data, and calculating the best-fi t second-order tensor. It also measures the volume-normalized calibrated bulk susceptibility (χ).  

# 4.3. Coordinates  

All magnetic data are reported relative to the IODP orientation conventions: $+x$ is into the face o f the working half, $+y$ points toward the left side of the face of the working half, and $+z$ points downsection. The relationship of the SRM coordinates $(x-,y-$ , and $z_{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ -axes) to the data coordinates $(x-,y-,$ and $z_{\cdot}$ -directions) is as follows: for archive halves, $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}.$ -direction $=x.$ -axis, $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ -direction $=-y$ -axis, and $z_{\cdot}$ - direction $\r=z$ -axis; for working halves, $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction $=-x$ -axis, $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ -direction $=y$ -axis, and $z$ -directio n $\r=\ z$ -axis (Figure F19). The coordinate systems for the spinner magnetometer and NatsuharaGiken sampling cubes are shown in Figure F19.  

# 4.4. Core orientation  

Paleomagnetic study of marine sediment cores is greatly enhanced if the angle between magneti c north and the double line marked on the core liner can be determined. The ChRMs can provide  a reference frame to reorient cores. Provided that the reference magnetic pole is known, the orientation of the paleomagnetic vector could be used to restore the azimuth of the $+x$ core axis (e.g. , Fuller, 1969).  

# 4.5. Magnetostratigraphy reference scale and interpretations  

The magnetostratigraphy at each site was constructed by correlating observed polarity sequence s with a reference geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) in combination with biostratigraphic biohorizons. The GPTS used for Expedition 396 is the GPTS2020 synthesis of astronomical tuning o f Cenozoic through latest Cretaceous polarity zones updated in Ogg (2020).  

We applied the following protocol to establish magnetozones:  

1. Pass-through measurements on long coherent core sections after AF demagnetization up to 20 mT must display a near- $180^{\circ}$ shift in declinations and significant changes in inclinations. The observed magnetozones are then validated with the ChRM directions of the discrete samples from the corresponding intervals.   
2. The inclination trends with predicted paleolatitudes of the drill sites are compared with the absolute plate motion of the European plate on global plate circuit reconstructions (e.g., Scotese, 2014a, 2014b).  

Whenever possible, we provide an interpretation of the magnetic polarity, including a namin g convention which includes correlative chron and anomaly numbers prefaced by the letter C (e.g., Ogg, 2020). Normal polarity subchrons are referred to by adding suffixes (n1, n2, etc.) that increase with age. For the younger part of the timescale (Pliocene–Pleistocene), where possible, w e use traditional names to refer to the various chrons and subchrons (e.g., Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, etc.). In general, polarity reversals occurring at the end of core sections have been treated wit h extreme caution.  

# 5. Geochemistry  

The shipboard geochemistry program for Expedition 396 included the following measurements:  

• Headspace gas content;   
• IW composition;   
• Bulk geochemical parameters, including total inorganic carbon (TIC), total organic carbon (TOC), total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulfur (TS), and organic matter source rock analyses;   
• Bulk elemental composition of igneous and sedimentary rocks (ICP-AES);   
• XRD analysis of mineralogic composition;   
• pXRF spectrometer analysis of bulk geochemical composition; and   
• Deconvolution of NGR data to obtain geochemical composition.  

These analyses were carried out to satisfy routine shipboard safety and pollution prevention requirements, characterize the diagenetic regime by IW analysis, and provide bulk sediment geochemistry data for shipboard interpretation and guiding the sampling strategy for shore-base d research. All methods were adapted from those of Norris et al. (2014b) and Sutherland et al. (2019).  

# 5.1. Headspace gas content and composition  

Hydrocarbon gas concentrations and distributions were routinely monitored from headspac e samples to ensure safety and prevent any potential contamination. Sediment plugs of $\{{\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}}$ wer e collected from each core immediately after retrieval on deck using a brass boring tool. The headspace samples were collected from the top of a section from the middle of a core, adjacent to an I W sample where possible. The headspace sample was placed in a $21.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass serum vial that wa s sealed with an aluminum crimp cap fitted with a Teflon septum. Each vial was labeled with th e core, section, and interval from which the sample was taken. The vial was heated at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for ${\sim}35$ min to evolve hydrocarbon gases from the sediment plug. In the case of lithified or consolidate d samples, chips of rock equaling $\{{\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}}$ were placed in the headspace vial and processed as above.  

The hydrocarbons that were analyzed using this procedure included methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethylene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propylene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ . To detect and quantify these light hydrocarbons, samples were extracted from the sealed sample vial by piercing the septum with a gas-tight glas s syringe. The samples were then injected into an Agilent/HP 6890 Series II gas chromatograp h (GC) equipped with a $2.4\:\mathrm{m}\times2.00\:\mathrm{mm}$ stainless steel column packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSe p R and a flame ionization detector set to $250^{\circ}C$ . Samples were introduced into the GC through  a $0.25\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample loop connected to the Valco valve, which can be switched automatically to backflush the column. The starting oven temperature for the GC was set to $80^{\circ}C$ for $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ , followe d by a progressive increase to $150^{\circ}C$ at a rate of $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ and finally a return to $100^{\circ}C$ postrun for  a total of $15\,\mathrm{min}$ . The initial helium flow that was used as the gas carrier was set to $30\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ . Flo w was then increased to $60\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ after $8.25\,\mathrm{min}$ to accelerate elution of $C_{3}$ and $C_{3=}$ at the end of th e run. The GC was also equipped with an electronic pressure control module to monitor the overal l flow into the GC. Data were collected and evaluated using the Agilent Chemstation softwar e (2001–2006), and the chromatographic response was calibrated against different preanalyzed ga s standards with variable quantities of low–molecular weight hydrocarbons, as stipulated by Scot t Specialty Gases (Air Liquide). Concentrations of hydrocarbon gases are reported in parts per million by volume (ppmv).

# 5.2.1. Collection and processing  

Alkalinity, $\mathsf{p H}$ , salinity, chlorinity, phosphate $\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\;\;3-}\right)$ , ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$ , sulfate $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-})$ , an d major and minor trace elements in IW were determined by squeezing whole-round core sample s that were cut, collected, and capped on the catwalk immediately after core retrieval. The wholeround samples were $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ long but increased to $10~\mathrm{cm}$ as water content decreased downhole t o yield enough fluid for both shipboard and shore-based analyses.  

Shipboard IW analyses were performed on three whole-round samples per core (typically the bottom of Sections 2, 4, and 6) between 0 and $50\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and one whole-round sample per cor e (typically the bottom of Section 3) between $50\mathrm{\;m\,CSF-A}$ and roughly $30\,\mathrm{m}$ above basement. Belo w this point, samples were taken at a frequency of three samples per core. All collected samples wer e split, transferred to storage vials (either sealed glass ampoules or acid-washed $8~\mathrm{mL}$ tubes), an d archived for shore-based analysis following protocols for sampling priority in Table T6. At eac h site, a ${\sim}50{-}100\ \mathrm{mL}$ sample was taken from the mudline of the first section to allow comparison o f bottom waters with the pore space.  

Upon recovery on the catwalk, whole-round samples were brought to the geochemistry laborator y for immediate processing. The outer surface of each sample was scraped off with a pallet knife t o remove contaminants from seawater, drilling, and oxidation that might have occurred durin g transfer. The remaining sample was placed in an $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ titanium squeezer and transferred to Carve r hydraulic presses (Manheim and Sayles, 1974), where gauge forces as high as 35,000 lb wer e applied to extract interstitial fluid from the squeeze cakes. The squeezed IW was washed throug h a Whatman Number 1 filter $(11\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ placed in the hydraulic press. The fluid was filtered through  a $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ syringe-tip filter and collected in acid-washed polyethylene syringes attached to th e squeezing apparatus.  

# 5.2.2. Shipboard interstitial water analysis  

IW samples were analyzed in the shipboard geochemistry laboratory following the protocols outlined in Gieskes et al. (1991) and Murray et al. (2000).  

# 5.2.2.1. Alkalinity, pH, and salinity  

Alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured using an autotitrator (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) equippe d with a glass pH electrode and stirrer (Model 728 stirrer). The $\mathsf{p H}$ was recorded directly into th e LabView Alkalinity program. Alkalinity was measured by titrating $3\,\mathrm{mL}$ of sample with a $0.1\,\mathrm{N}\,\mathrm{HCl}$ solution to reach an end point at about $\mathrm{pH}=4.2$ . The International Association for the Physica l Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) seawater standard was used to ensure accuracy of alkalinity measurements. Salinity was analyzed with a Fisher Model S66366 refractometer calibrated using 1 8 MΩ Millipore deionized water. The known salinity of the IAPSO seawater standard was used as  a check value. Salinity was measured on untreated IW samples.

# 5.2.2.2. Ion chromatography  

IW concentrations for select anions $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{\ 2-}$ , $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ , and $C\mathrm{l^{-}}$ ) and cations $(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{a}^{2+},\,\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , and $\!\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ) wer e measured using a Metrohm 850 professional ion chromatograph (IC) after aliquots were diluted a t 1:100. The IAPSO seawater standard was used for QC, and standards were prepared in the sam e manner as samples.  

# 5.2.2.3. Spectrophotometer  

Phosphate $\mathrm{(PO}_{4}^{\;3-})$ and ammonium $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right)$ were measured in IW samples via spectrophotomete r using an Agilent Cary 100 UV-Vis instrument. Phosphate was measured after reaction of orthophosphate with Mo(VI) and Sb(III) in acid to form an antimony phosphomolybdate complex. Thi s was then reduced using ascorbic acid to form a blue solution, the absorbance of which was measured at a wavelength of $885~\mathrm{nm}$ . A calibration curve was created using a range of dilutions of  a solution containing potassium phosphate monobasic $\left(\mathrm{KH}_{2}\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)$ , and this solution was also used a s an internal standard. For analysis, $600\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of IW was diluted with 18 MΩ Millipore deionized wate r and $\mathrm{KH}_{2}\mathrm{PO}_{4},$ with a final dilution of 1:10.  

Ammonium was measured after phenol diazotization and oxidation by sodium hypochlorite. Thi s solution was then measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of $640\:\mathrm{nm}$ . Ammonium chloride $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{Cl}\right)$ was used to produce a calibration curve and as an internal standard. Both IW samples and standard solutions were diluted at 1:31 with $18~\mathrm{M}\Omega$ Millipore deionized water an d prepared reagent.  

# 5.2.2.4. Major and minor elements by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry  

A range of selected elements (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Li, Sr, B, Si, Mn, Fe, and Ba) were analyzed using a n Agilent 5110 ICP-AES with an SPS 4 autosampler. Samples were analyzed following the method s in Murray et al. (2000), and major and trace elements were measured separately. IW samples wer e diluted prior to analysis with a dilution factor of 1:10. The diluent was $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ spiked with 1 0 ppm Y. The IAPSO seawater standard was used as a standard for major elements. Standards fo r minor elements were prepared separately following the same protocol. Standards were diluted a t the same ratio as IW samples.  

Samples were run in batches; each sample was analyzed five times, and the average of these fiv e runs was taken as the reported measurement. Each batch (of ${\sim}50$ samples) contained six artificia l standards with known concentrations of all elements of interest. Two further standards were regularly measured to monitor instrumental drift. All raw intensity data were downloaded after analysis and converted to concentration values based on the standards data using the ICP-AE S software. Replicate analyses of standard solutions were used to estimate precision and accuracy. These values were typically lower than $5\%$ . Results from any samples with an error higher than $5\%$ were discarded and not used.  

# 5.2.3. Interstitial water samples for shore-based analysis  

Any IW remaining after shipboard analyses was split into aliquots for shore-based analyses, including $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ , δD, $\delta^{13}C$ , $\delta^{26}\mathrm{Mg}$ , $\delta^{41}\mathrm{K}$ , $\delta^{56}\mathrm{Fe}$ , $\delta^{30}\mathrm{Si}$ and $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\mathrm{Sr}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; sample and analysis priority is indicated in Table T6. Squeeze cake samples were also split for shore-based major element and isotopic analysis. Any remaining IW and squeeze cake sediments were archived in $15\;\mathrm{mL}$ Falcon tubes.  

# 5.2.4. Sediment samples for shore-based microbiological analysis  

Samples for shore-based microbiological community analysis, consisting of RNA and DNA analysis, and cell counting were taken using cutoff $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ syringes. Ash-containing horizons and the sediments  directly  above  and  below  these  horizons  were  specifically  targeted,  along  wit h basalt/sediment interfaces. Samples were immediately frozen aboard ship and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  A small number of horizons were also sampled for shore-based iron reduction experiments. Collected sample material was placed into a rubber-stoppered glass bottle, which was then flushe d with nitrogen to prevent further microbial degradation. These samples were also immediatel y transferred to a freezer and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# 5.3. Bulk sediment geochemistry  

# 5.3.1. Elemental analysis  

# 5.3.1.1. Collection and processing  

Sediment samples were collected from IW squeeze cakes and intervals with distinct lithologies o f interest. Samples were freeze-dried for ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{h}$ , crushed using an agate pestle and mortar, and the n analyzed for TIC, TOC, TS, and TN. TC, sulfur, and nitrogen were determined using a ThermoElectron Corporation FlashEA 1112 carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS) analyzer equippe d with a ThermoElectron packed column CHNS/nitrogen-carbon-sulfur (NCS) GC and a therma l conductivity detector (TCD). A $10{-}15\,\mathrm{mg}$ subsample was weighed into a tin cup and combusted a t $950^{\circ}C$ under a constant stream of oxygen. The reaction gases were passed through a reductio n chamber to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and were then separated by the GC before detection by the TCD. All measurements were calibrated to a standard (Soil Reference Materia l [NIST2704]), which was run every 10 samples. The peak areas from the TCD were calculated t o determine the TC and TN of the samples.  

TIC was determined using a Coulometrics $5015\,\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Between 10 and $20~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighed into glass vials and acidified with $2\,\mathrm{N}$ HCl. The liberated $C O_{2}$ was titrated, an d the corresponding change in light transmittance in the coulometric cell was monitored using  a photo-detection cell. The weight percent of calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ ) was calculated from th e inorganic carbon content using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\left(w t\%\right)\times100/12.}
$$  

A pure $C a C O_{3}$ standard $(>\!99.9\%$ ; Fisher Scientific) was used to confirm accuracy. TOC conten t was calculated by subtraction of inorganic carbon from the TC obtained from CHNS analysis o r using the source rock analyzer (SRA) for selected intervals (see below). The former calculatio n relies on two methods that are dependent on the accuracy of sample masses measured at sea, so i t should be taken as a rough estimate of TOC content.  

# 5.3.1.2. Organic matter characterization with pyrolysis  

The type and quantity of organic matter in intervals of specific interest at Sites U1567–U157 0 were evaluated by pyrolysis assay using an SRA (Weatherford Laboratories). Between 60 and 18 0 mg of freeze-dried, crushed sediment was weighed into SRA crucibles. Each sample was heated i n stepwise fashion. The first heat step was at $340^{\circ}C$ for $3\,\mathrm{min}$ to measure volatile hydrocarbon (HC ) as the S1 peak $(\mathrm{mg}\,\mathrm{HC}/\mathrm{g}$ rock). The second temperature step was $640^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $25^{\circ}C/\mathrm{min}$ , which yield s hydrocarbon release through the pyrolysis of kerogen (area S2 peak; mg $\mathrm{HC}/\mathrm{g}$ rock). The positio n of the maximum of the S2 peak represents the $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ . The S3 peak constitutes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ( $\mathbf{a}s\;\mathbf{m}\mathbf{g}\,\mathbf{C}/\mathbf{g}$ rock ) released during pyrolysis between $340^{\circ}$ and $390^{\circ}C$ . The S4 peak is $C O_{2}$ (as $\mathrm{mg}\,\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{g}$ rock) produce d by oxidizing the pyrolysis residue at $580^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , but this value is estimated rather than directly measured. $\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}$ (to distinguish SRA-based TOC from calculated TOC derived from the elementa l analyzer) was calculated from S1, S2, and S4, assuming that S1 and S2 are $83\%$ carbon:  

$$
\mathrm{wt}\%\ \mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}=(0.83\times\left[{\mathrm{S1}}+{\mathrm{S2}}\right]+{\mathrm{S4}})/10.
$$  

The carbon-normalized hydrogen index (HI) $(\mathrm{mg~HC}/\mathrm{g}$ TOC) and the oxygen index (OI) (m g $C O_{2}/\mathrm{g}$ TOC) were calculated from pyrolysis values:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathrm{HI}=\left(100\times S2\right)/\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}},\,\mathrm{and}}}\\ {{{\mathrm{OI}=(100\times S3)/\mathrm{TOC}_{\mathrm{SRA}}}.}}\end{array}
$$  

Production index (PI) was calculated with the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{PI}=\mathrm{S}1/(\mathrm{S}1+\mathrm{S}2).
$$  

All measurements were preceded by a blank and then calibrated to a rock standard from Weatherford Laboratories (533; PN:810-141-B). The same standard was used for QC every 10 samples.  

# 5.4. Elemental analysis of igneous samples  

# 5.4.1. Sample collection and preparation  

During Expedition 396, chemical analyses of rock samples were performed using ICP-AES fo r major and trace element analyses using the Leeman ICP-AES. Samples were prepared from ${\sim}2$ t o ${\sim}8~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of rock for basalts. The solid rock samples were cut from the core with a diamond sa w blade. Thin or thick sections (dependent upon sample) were taken from the same or an adjacen t interval for petrographic analysis (see Lithostratigraphy). Outer surfaces of rock samples wer e ground on a diamond-impregnated disk to remove saw marks and altered rinds resulting fro m drilling. Each cleaned sample was then placed in a beaker containing acetone and washed ultrasonically for $15\;\mathrm{min}$ . The acetone was decanted, and the samples were then sonicated in deionize d water $\left(18\,\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm}\right)$ twice for $10\;\mathrm{min}$ . The cleaned pieces were dried for $10{-}12\,\mathrm{h}$ at $110^{\circ}C$ .  

The cleaned, dried samples were crushed to $^{<1}$ cm chips between two disks of Delrin plastic in  a hydraulic press. The rock chips were then ground to a fine powder in a tungsten carbide mill in  a SPEX 8515 Shatterbox. After grinding, a $5.0\pm0.5\mathrm{\g}$ aliquot of the sample powder was weighed o n a Mettler Toledo balance and ignited at $1025^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to determine loss on ignition (LOI) with a n estimated precision of $0.02\:\mathrm{g}\:(0.4\%)$ .  

The standard shipboard procedure for digestion of rock and subsequent ICP-AES analysis i s described in detail in Murray et al. (2000). The following protocol is an abbreviated form of thi s procedure with minor modifications. After determination of LOI, $100.0\,\pm\,0.2\,\mathrm{\mg}$ splits of th e ignited whole-rock powders were weighed and mixed with $400.0\pm0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ of lithium metaborat e $\mathrm{(LiBO_{2})}$ flux that was preweighed on shore. Standard rock powders and full procedural blank s were included with unknowns in each ICP-AES run (note that among the elements analyzed, contamination from the tungsten carbide mills is negligible) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003). Al l samples and standards were weighed on a microbalance (designed to measure on a moving platform) with weighing errors estimated to be $\pm0.05~\mathrm{mg}$ under relatively smooth sea-surface conditions.  

A $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ aliquot of $0.172~\mathrm{mM}$ aqueous LiBr solution was added to the mixture of flux and roc k powder as a nonwetting agent to prevent the cooled bead from sticking to the crucible. Sample s were then fused individually in $\mathbf{P}\mathbf{t}{-}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{u}$ (95:5) crucibles for ${\sim}12$ min at a maximum temperature o f $1050^{\circ}C$ in an internally rotating induction furnace (Bead Sampler NT-4100). After cooling, bead s were transferred to $125~\mathrm{mL}$ high-density polypropylene (HDPE) bottles and dissolved in $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ o f $10\%$ (by volume) dilution of concentrated trace-metal grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ (hereafter referred to as $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3})$ ), aided by shaking with a Burrell wrist-action bottle shaker for $^{1\,\mathrm{~h~}}$ . After digestion of th e glass bead, the solution was passed through a $0.45\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ filter into a clean $60\,\mathrm{mL}$ wide-mouth HDP E bottle. Next, $1.25~\mathrm{mL}$ of this solution was transferred to a plastic vial and diluted with $10\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to a total volume of $10~\mathrm{mL}$ . The final solution-to-sample dilution factor was ${\sim}4000\times$ . Dilution s were made using a Brinkman Dispensette.  

# 5.4.2. Inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy  

# 5.4.2.1. Analyses  

Major (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, and Ti) and trace (Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Sc, Sr, V, Zn, and Zr ) element concentrations of standards and samples were determined using a Teledyne Leeman Lab s Prodigy ICP-AES instrument. The analyzed elements and the wavelengths used for sample analysis during Expedition 396 are provided in Table T7. The plasma was ignited at least $30\;\mathrm{min}$ befor e each run of samples to allow the instrument to warm up and stabilize.  

The ICP-AES data presented in the Inorganic geochemistry section of each site chapter wer e acquired using the Gaussian mode of the Prodigy software. This mode fits a curve to points acros s a peak and integrates the area under the curve for each element measured. Each sample was analyzed four times from the same dilute solution (i.e., in quadruplicate) within a given sample run. For elements measured at more than one wavelength, we either used the wavelength that gave th e best calibration line in a given run or, if the calibration lines for more than one wavelength were o f similar quality, we used the data from all wavelengths and reported the average concentration.  

# The ICP-AES run included the following:  

• Certified rock standards, analyzed twice during each run, chosen to cover a wide range of compositions to calibrate the analyses (peridotite: JP-1; basalt: BIR-1, BHVO-2, and BCR-2; gabbro: MRG-1; andesite: AGV-1; and granodiorite: JG-1A);   
• Samples (unknowns) analyzed in quadruplicate;   
• A drift-correcting standard (BHVO-2) analyzed in every eighth sample position and at the beginning and end of each run;   
• A blank solution analyzed near the beginning;   
• Two or three “check” standards run as unknowns, each also analyzed in quadruplicate; check standards were chosen for their compositions similar to that of the analyzed material (ultramafic: DTS-1; basalt: JB-1a, JB-2; and felsic rocks: JG-2, JG-3, etc.); and   
• A $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ wash solution run for 60 s between each analysis.  

# 5.4.2.2. Data reduction for inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy  

Following each run of the instrument, raw intensities were transferred to a data file, and all analyses were corrected for instrument drift and then corrected for the procedural blank. Drift correction was applied to each element by linear interpolation between the drift-monitoring solution s run in every eighth sample position. After drift correction and subtraction of procedural blank,  a calibration line for each element was calculated using the results for the certified rock standards. Element concentrations in the samples were then calculated from the relevant calibration lines. Individual analyses of both standards and samples produced total volatile-free major elemen t weight percentages that vary from $100\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ by as much as several percent. Possible causes includ e some combination of errors in weighing the sample and/or flux powders (although even whe n weighed on land, weighing errors are possible), variability in the dilutions (which were done volumetrically), and the duration and relatively low temperature of ignition.  

Estimates of accuracy and precision of major and trace element analyses were based on replicat e analyses of check standards compared to values published in Govindaraju et al. (1994) and the GeoReM database (http://georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de) for international rock standards and to values published in Puchelt et al. (1996) (Table T8). Expedition 396 experienced some analytical issue s with silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$ ) concentration being slightly overestimated, and we therefore considered all oxid e values as semiquantitative and did not recalculate totals to $100~\mathrm{wt\%}$ so as not to distort the othe r oxide values. However, the excellent match between the ICP-AES analyses and pXRF data suggest s that the issue only affects silica and the results obtained on other elements are robust.  

# 5.4.3. X-ray diffraction  

Bulk XRD analysis was performed at a resolution of roughly one sample per core to attain information on bulk mineralogy of the sediments. Additional sampling of clay-rich layers was carrie d out intermittently to investigate the mineralogic composition of the clay fraction. Sampling locations are noted on the VCDs. Bulk XRD samples were freeze-dried and homogenized using th e SPEX 8515 Shatterbox. Samples for clay analysis XRD were initially treated with acetic acid t o remove carbonates prior to the addition of Borax and suspension using a sonic dismembrator; th e samples were then left to settle. The clay fraction was then removed by sampling the top of th e settled solids with a pasteur pipette before being dried. Powders were mounted on a sample holde r and analyzed using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor diffractometer mounted with a Vantec-1 detector usin g nickel-filtered CuKα radiation. Analysis was completed under the following conditions:

Shipboard results consist of qualitative information regarding the primary composition of th e sample mineralogy. For this, diffractograms were processed, which included baseline removal, an d interpreted using the software package EVA. Processed files include d-spacing values, diffractio n angles, and peak intensities with background removed. D-spacing results were compared to expected values of d-spacing for minerals in the EVA database using a range of standards to monito r data quality. Muscovite/illite/glauconite and kaolinite/chlorite have similar diffraction pattern s and could not be distinguished in the shipboard results.  

# 5.4.4. Portable X-ray fluorescence analysis  

For the rapid identification of elemental composition of layers of interest or changes in lithology, a n Olympus Delta handheld pXRF spectrometer was used. Analysis was carried out mostly on har d rocks and archive halves of split cores. For these measurements, rock samples that could be remove d from the core without damage were placed in a specially made shielded sample analysis assembly. Samples that were too fragile to be removed were analyzed in situ using a shielded sleeve analyze r mount. A few additional analyses were performed on selected sediments from the archive halves. When these sediments were wet or unconsolidated, a $4\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ film of 3525 Ultralene $0.16\,\mathrm{mil}$ was place d over the core to prevent contamination and/or damage to the X-ray analyzer on billet residues use d for thin section preparation and on cuvettes collected from the working halves for XRD analysis.  

We followed the analytical procedure described in Johnston et al. (2018). We utilized the “geochemistry” correction protocol in the “geochemistry and soil” submenu, which analyzes for elements in three energy ranges (low = Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cr, P, S, and Mg; main $=C\mathbf{a}$ , Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Sr, Rb, Zr, Zn, and others; $\mathrm{high}=\mathrm{Sr},$ Rb, Zr, Ba, La, and Ce). A powder-mounted standar d reference material (BHVO-2) was analyzed every 8–10 analyses to track instrument performanc e over time. No drift was observed with time (Figure F20). The total variation among individua l measurements of the same sample was always well within the measurement uncertainties reporte d by the instrument. Day-to-day variation in results for BHVO-2 indicated variability between $0.8\%$ and $8.8\%$ over the course of the expedition (Table T9).

# 5.4.4.1. Portable X-ray fluorescence calibration of geologic materials  

Calibration curves for the different elements measured via pXRF were determined using the sam e suite of standard reference materials used for ICP-AES analyses to improve interinstrument dat a comparisons (Table T8). Powder mounts for each of the reference materials were analyzed t o develop the calibration lines. Slope and intercept values from the calibration lines were used t o correct concentration results for unknowns (Figure F21). Analyses of reference materials wer e repeated at the end of the expedition to detect potential drift with time. No significant change wa s observed. Both rock and powder samples were analyzed using powder-based working curve s because past results indicated no differences in instrument performance between rocks and powders (Ryan et al., 2017; Reagan et al., 2015). Following the approaches taken during IODP Expeditions 352 and 366, we made interpretive quantitative use of $\mathtt{p X R F}$ data for elements wit h calibration curves with high correlation r values $\left(>\!0.95\right)$ and good intercepts. These elements wer e Ca, K, Ti, and Mn (calibrated as oxides: CaO, ${\mathrm{K}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}},$ , $\mathrm{TiO}_{2},$ and ${\mathrm{MnO}}_{,}$ ) and Fe, Ni, Cr, Cu, Zn, Sr, Rb, Zr, and Y. For MnO and Ni, two calibrations curves were built: one for samples with $>\!1\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ Mn O and ${\it\Delta}{\sim}1000\mathrm{\ppm\Ni}$ (red dashed lines in Figure F20), and one for samples with ${<}1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ MnO an d $<\!1000$ ppm Ni (orange dashed line). An insufficient number of standards were available with sulfur data to produce a reasonable working curve. Analyses of P, Nb, and V were only considered a s qualitative. For Si, Mg, and Al (i.e., elements that produce low-energy $\mathrm{X}.$ -rays that are readil y absorbed in air), we used the pXRF results to aid in lithologic identification prior ICP-AES analyses.

Figure F20. Calibration curves for elements analyzed using pXRF, Expedition 396.  

Unknown samples were measured manually for $60\;\mathrm{s}$ , and three measurements per unknown constituted a single analysis. On sites where alternating sequences of basalts and sediments wer e observed (Sites U1566, U1571, U1572, and U1573), at least one analysis per core was performed. When multiple flows were observed (defined by the presence of a chilled margin or the presenc e of interbasaltic sediments), one analysis per flow was performed. Analyses performed on standar d BHVO-2 as an unknown show that $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ and $_\mathrm{Cr}$ are slightly underestimated and $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ and Rb ar e slightly overestimated. All other elements overlap with the preferred value (Table T8) (Jochum e t al., 2016).

# 5.4.5. Deconvolution of natural gamma radiation spectra  

To attain an estimate of the amount of K, Th, and U in the samples, we used the approach of D e Vleeschouwer et al. (2017) to deconvolve the NGR spectra (see Physical properties). Briefly, thi s approach utilizes an algorithm to first remove the background data from the spectra and isolat e the characteristic gamma ray (GR) peaks of the three decay series $\big(^{40}\mathrm{K},{}^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ ). The algorithm then integrates the counts over these specific spectral regions to attain estimates of concentration for each of the measured samples. For this deconvolution, we used the raw spectral outpu t of the NGR measurements and the bulk density estimates of the GR attenuation (GRA) metho d (see Physical properties). The algorithm code, published in De Vleeschouwer et al. (2017), wa s run in Matlab R2021a.  

# 6. Physical properties  

Physical properties measurements were made utilizing a variety of techniques applied at variou s stages of the core recovery and archiving process to aid lithostratigraphic characterization, magnetostratigraphy, core-log-seismic integration, and hard rock reservoir characterization. Physica l properties include NGR; $P.$ -wave velocity; bulk, grain, and dry density; porosity; MS; thermal conductivities; and X-ray and photo imaging. Measurements were taken on whole-round and sectionhalf cores and various discrete samples to integrate all available scales.  

# 6.1. General sampling and measurement sequence  

Prior to sampling and analyses, whole-round cores were allowed to equilibrate at ambient roo m temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and pressure for at least $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . X-ray images of the whole rounds were typicall y taken with the XMSL during this equilibration period. After thermal equilibration, core section s were run through the WRMSL for GRA bulk density, MS, and compressional wave ( $P$ -wave) velocity using the $P$ -wave logger (PWL).  

Thermal conductivity was measured on at least one whole-round section per core (typically chosen from a section central to the retrieved core) for sediment cores and on one or more hard roc k intervals per core according to lithofacies variations. For soft sediments, thermal conductivity wa s measured using a needle probe inserted into the section through a small hole drilled into the plastic core liner in the middle of the section. Where sediment cores were too hard to insert the needl e probe, and for hard rock samples, a contact probe was used on the section-half surface after cor e splitting. The contact probe was not used on section halves that were heavily disturbed (e.g., biscuited).  

MSP and color reflectance were measured on the archive-half sections using the SHMSL. $P$ -wav e velocity measurements were made on every working-half section and were typically chosen fro m undisturbed areas close to moisture and density (MAD) samples, along with other sections o f interest based on lithology variations, and for sections that were not measured adequately on th e whole round by the PWL. Discrete samples were collected from the working halves at a samplin g density of one per section to one per core depending on lithology variations and section samplin g history (i.e., a reduced number of samples were taken for the secondary holes that drilled overlapping sections previously sampled with Hole A). These samples were then used to measure wet an d dry mass, volume, and $P$ -wave velocities. Wet and dry mass and volume were used to calculate we t bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density with MAD procedures. I n addition, selected whole-round samples and minicores (diameter $=2.5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ ; perpendicular to th e core axes) of hard rock were sampled for specific postcruise research objectives requiring large r samples. In such cases, the core sections were scanned using the WRMSL and $360^{\circ}$ images wer e taken prior to minicore drilling.  

Details on the analytical protocols and performance, including variations for sedimentary an d hard rock cores, are described in the relevant sections below (Figure F22; Table T10). Only ra w data as retrieved from the physical properties instruments have been deposited in the LIMS database. Processing the data according to the information in Processing and data availability is recommended to retain only high-confidence data. Details on the physical properties measuremen t systems and theory in this chapter benefited significantly from the extensive previous IODP expedition methodologies (including Tamura et al., 2015a; Sun et al., 2018; Sutherland et al., 2019).  

# 6.2. Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

GRA bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and MS were measured nondestructively using the WRMS L (Figure F23). To optimize the measurement process and for consistency, uniform sampling intervals $(2.5\ \mathrm{cm})$ and measurement integration times $\textrm{\ensuremath{5s}}/$ measurement) were set for all sensors. These sampling intervals are common factors for the distances between the sensors installed o n the WRMSL $(30{-}50~\mathrm{cm})$ , which allows sequential and simultaneous measurements. QC wa s ensured by running a single core liner filled with deionized water through the WRMSL after ever y core run. Where deviations from expected values were observed, recalibrations were applied a s needed.  

# 6.2.1. Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

Bulk density is a fundamental rock property that can be used to estimate the pore volume in rock s where grain density is either measured or can be reasonably estimated. It is integral to rock physic s and core-log-seismic applications. GRA bulk density is an estimate of bulk density based on th e attenuation of a GR beam. The beam is produced by a $^{137}\!C s$ GR source at a radiation level of 37 0 MBq within a lead shield with a $5~\mathrm{mm}$ collimator that is directed through the whole-round core. The GR detector on the opposite side of the core from the source includes a scintillation detecto r and an integral photomultiplier tube to record the gamma radiation that passes through the core. The attenuation of gamma rays occurs primarily by Compton scattering, in which gamma rays ar e scattered by electrons in the sample, with the degree of scattering related to the material bulk density. Therefore, for a known thickness of sample, the density (ρ) is related to the intensity of th e attenuated gamma rays and can be expressed as follows:

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I_{0}/I)/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$I=$ measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample, $I_{0}=\mathrm{GR}$ source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

$\upmu$ and $I_{0}$ are treated as constants, such that $\uprho$ can be calculated from I.  

The spatial resolution of the GRA densitometer is less than $\pm1\;\mathrm{cm}$ . The GR detector is calibrate d with sealed calibration cores (one standard core liner filled with distilled water and aluminum cylinders of various diameters). To establish the calibration curves, GR counts were taken throug h each aluminum cylinder for $60\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ . Each aluminum cylinder has a density of $2.7\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and $^d$ is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The relationship between $I$ and $\upmu d$ is as follows:  

$$
\ln(I)=\mathrm{A}(\upmu d)^{2}+\mathrm{B}(\upmu d)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where A, B, and C are coefficients determined from the calibration. Recalibration was performe d as needed when the deionized water QC standard density deviated significantly (more than a fe w percent) from $1\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# 6.2.2. Magnetic susceptibility  

MS $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by a n external magnetic field:  

$$
\mathrm{{X}}=M/H,
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field of strength $H.$ MS i s primarily sensitive to the concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g., magnetite and maghemite). MS can also give insights into magnetic mineral origins and subsequent diagenetic processes, and in igneous rocks, MS may be reduced by orders of magnitude due to extensiv e alteration, for example from magnetite to maghemite or to hematite.  

![](images/580c4025654fd1f2e6209f858f184f0d34a83b06b144a98a85e535e539484db5.jpg)  
Figure F23. WRMSL. The water standard measured at the end of each core is for QA/QC purposes.  

MS was measured using a Bartington MS3 susceptometer coupled with a Bartington MS2C loo p sensor with an $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ internal diameter that comes precalibrated. An oscillator circuit in the sensor, which operates at a frequency of $0.565~\mathrm{kHz}$ and an AF of ${\sim}140~\mathrm{A/m}$ , produces a low-intensity, nonsaturating alternating magnetic field. Sediment or hard rock core sections passing through thi s field cause a change in oscillator frequency. Frequency information returned in pulse form to th e susceptibility meter can then be converted into MS.  

# 6.2.3. Compressional $\bar{P}$ -wave velocity  

Core measurements of sonic $P$ -wave velocity data forms a vital link for core-log-seismic integration and for the associated scaling up of lithofacies inferences. $P$ -wave velocity can also be used t o estimate porosity, especially where downhole conditions are poor, such as caved sections, an d forms a vital component of geomechanical and stress state calculations. $P$ -wave velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ i s defined by the time required for a compressional wave to travel a specific distance:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d_{\mathrm{core}}/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $d_{\mathrm{core}}$ is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is the traveltime through the core. $P$ -wave velocity was measured on whole-round cores using the PWL. The $P$ -wave velocity system s use Panametrics-NDT Microscan delay line transducers, which transmit a $500\;\mathrm{kHz}$ pulse.  

The PWL measures the traveltime of $500~\mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasonic waves horizontally across the wholeround core at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals with the core still in the liner. Waves are transmitted to the core b y transducer contacts connected to linear actuators. Pressure is applied to the actuators to ensur e coupling between the transducers and the core liner, and the space between the core liner an d transducers is kept wet to ensure good coupling. $P$ -wave velocity transducers measure total traveltime $\r(t)$ of the compressional wave between transducers separated by the total distance $(d)$ measured using a laser beam. By measuring the traveltime through a standard block of aluminum wit h a known velocity $(6295\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ , a system delay correction $(\delta t)$ is defined. The core is surrounded by  a core liner of known thickness $(\delta L)$ , and a traveltime correction $(\delta t_{\mathrm{L}})$ is determined by measurin g through the core liner filled with distilled water of known velocity, which is corrected for the influence of temperature. Arrival times are taken for the second lobe of the waveform, requiring a correction $(\delta t_{\mathrm{pulse}})$ to get the first arrival. The velocity in the core is as follows:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d-2\delta L)/(t-\delta t-2\delta t_{\mathrm{L}}-\delta t_{\mathrm{pulse}}).
$$  

$P$ -wave measurements are not typically made on the WRMSL for cores drilled with the XCB an d RCB systems because the smaller core diameters generally result in poor contacts and noise results. However, we made the decision to keep logging the $P$ -wave velocities for sediments whenever possible and quality check the signal by measuring discrete samples using the $P.$ -wave caliper s (PWC) and $P$ -wave bayonets (PWB). For lithified sediments and hard rock samples, the PWL wa s turned off and $P$ -wave velocity was instead measured using the PWC on section halves or discret e cube samples prior to MAD analyses.  

# 6.3. Natural Gamma Radiation Logger measurements  

NGR data are critical for several aspects of borehole studies, including identification of variou s lithostratigraphic units, stratigraphic correlation, core-log calibration, and chemical/mineralogi c appraisal. For sedimentary sequences, NGR data often give important insights into grain size. Fine-grained sediments often contain NGR attenuating isotopes of K, Th, and U. For volcani c rocks, NGR data give important insights into igneous differentiation (basic rocks $=$ low NGR; evolved rocks $=$ high NGR) and alteration processes. In sedimentary successions, NGR can als o reveal important constraints on the presence and composition of volcanic ash layers.  

NGR is emitted from the decay of $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ in the core sample. The NGRL measure s gamma emissions on whole-round cores using a system designed and built at Texas A&M University (USA) (Vasiliev et al., 2011; Dunlea et al., 2013) (Figure F24). When $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotopes decay, NGR is emitted at specific energy levels. NGR spectroscopy measures a wid e energy spectrum that can be used to estimate the abundance of each isotope based on the strengt h of the signal at characteristic energies (Blum, 1997; Gilmore, 2008). Spectral data were collecte d and can be used for processing for U, Th, and K abundance calculations (see Geochemistry).  

The main NGRL detector unit consists of eight sodium iodide (NaI) detectors arranged along th e core measurement axis at $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals surrounding the lower half of the section (Vasiliev et al., 2011). The detector array has passive (layers of lead) and active (plastic scintillators) shielding t o reduce the background environmental and cosmic radiation. The overlying plastic scintillator s detect incoming high-energy NGR and cosmic radiation and cancel this signal from the tota l counted by the NaI detectors. The quality of the energy spectrum measured in a core depends o n the concentration of radionuclides in the sample but also on the counting time, with higher time s yielding better spectra. Therefore, a measurement run consisted of $10~\mathrm{cm}$ spaced, 300 s interva l counts on each core. Calibration of the NGRL was done in January 2021 according to standar d IODP protocols. No calibration of NGRL spectra for analyses of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , and $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ concentrations was conducted during Expedition 396.  

# 6.4. Thermal conductivity measurements  

After NGR measurements were completed, thermal conductivity was measured with the TK-0 4 (Teka Bolin) system Figure F25). Thermal conductivity defines how material conducts heat and i s essential to determine heat flow and geothermal gradient. Thermal conductivity was measured fo r all types of rocks recovered during Expedition 396. A needle probe tool was used on the soft sediments of whole-round cores if the material was soft enough to be penetrated effectively (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959). The probes contain a heater wire and a calibrated thermistor. For sof t sediments, the needle probe was inserted into a $2~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter hole drilled through the line r along one of the lines that guided later core splitting. To avoid interference from air flow in th e laboratory, the core was placed in an enclosed foam insulated box.  

A contact probe method with the puck tool was used on section-half cores for lithified sediment s and hard rock samples that were selected from the working-half sections and returned unaltere d to the core liner upon completion of the measurements. The contact probe was embedded in th e surface of an epoxy block with a low thermal conductivity (Vacquier, 1985) and was maintained i n contact with the sample. For igneous rock samples, both the rock and probe were equilibrate d together in a bath of seawater at room temperature in a cooler insulated with extruded polystyren e foam.

The calibrated heat source of the probe was then turned on, and the increase in temperature wa s recorded over $^{80\,s}$ . A heating power of $2.5\:\mathrm{W/m}$ was typically used. The solution to the heat conduction equation with a line source of heat was then fitted to the temperature measurements t o obtain the thermal conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductive than sediment o r hard rock, the probe is assumed to be a perfect conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of the superconductive probe has a ( linear relationship with the natural logarithm of the tim e after the initiation of the heat:  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where  

$T=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\left(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (s), and   
$C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three measuring cycles were automatically performed to calculate average conductivity. A sel f test, which included a drift study, was conducted at the beginning of each measurement cycle. Once the probe temperature stabilized, the heater circuit was closed and the temperature rise i n the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity was calculated from the rate of temperature ris e while the heater current was flowing. Temperatures measured during the first 80 s of the heatin g cycle were fitted to an approximate solution of a constantly heated line source (Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Measurement errors were typically $5\%{-}10\%$ . Thermal conductivity measurement s were routinely taken in one section per core (usually the third section of each core).  

# 6.5. X-Ray Multisensor Logger  

X-ray imaging provides a powerful tool for appraising internal features of core samples from eithe r whole-round or section-half cores. X-ray images can give insights into features such as fractures, bedding, shells, dropstones, clast variations, and burrows in sediments and features such as jointing, vesicles, clast morphology, and alteration in igneous samples. The XMSL aboard JOIDES Resolution (Figure F26) is composed of a $120\,\mathrm{kV},$ 1 mA constant potential X-ray source and a detecto r unit. The source is a Teledyne ICM CP120B portable X-ray generator with a $0.8\ \mathrm{mm}\times\,0.5\ \mathrm{mm}$ focal spot. The beam angle is $50^{\circ}\times50^{\circ}$ , generating a directional cone onto the detector, which i s located $65\;\mathrm{cm}$ from the source. The detector is a Go-Scan $1510\;\mathrm{H}$ unit composed of an array o f complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensors with an active area of $102\ \mathrm{mm}\times153$ mm and a resolution of $99\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . A voltage is established between the filament and the material use d for X-ray generation $({\bf k}{\bf\nabla}\mathrm{p})$ , and a current is run through a filament, heating it up and emittin g electrons. The number of electrons is controlled by the current (mA), and the electrons collid e with the anode material (e.g., Rh or W), leading to the generation of broad-spectrum X-rays tha t exit the tube through a window of thin metal (typically Be) to minimize absorption. The XMSL i s run by the Integrated Measurement System (IMS) XMSL software application, which can optimize acquisition and image processing. Typically, 20 images are collected and stacked to create  a composite 2-D image. These images are processed using the Image Processing Utility to optimiz e observed features.

# 6.6. Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

Color reflectance and MS were measured on the archive-half sections using the SHMSL. Th e archive half of the split core was placed on the core holder under a track-mounted electronic platform that moves along the core recording the height of the split-core surface with a laser sensor. MSP and color reflectance are measured. All foam inserts were removed from the section-hal f cores before measurement to restrict the measurements to the core material only. MSP and colo r reflectance data were collected at constant intervals of $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ for each core.  

The color reflectance spectrometer uses an Ocean Optics $30\ \mathrm{mm}$ integrating sphere with bot h halogen and LED light sources covering wavelengths from ultraviolet through visible to near infrared. Measurements were taken from 380 to $900\ \mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths at $2~\mathrm{nm}$ intervals. The approximate 3 s data acquisition offset was applied for the entire scan of the archive-half section. The dat a are reported using the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color system, in which $L^{*}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is redness (positive) versu s greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ is yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative) of the rock. Th e color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure white (reference) and pure blac k (dark). Color calibration was conducted automatically approximately once every $^{6\mathrm{~h~}}$ (twice pe r shift).  

# 6.6.1. Point magnetic susceptibility  

MSP was measured with a Bartington MS2 meter and an MS2K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter round sensor with a field of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and an operation frequency of $930\;\mathrm{Hz}$ .  

![](images/b762c02bc1262ce36e944c93bf893f320750bbf906883738459b7531bf2e8748.jpg)  
Figure F26. XMSL.  

The instrument averages three measurements from the sensor for each offset, leading to an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . The spatial resolution of the MSP instrument is ${\sim}3.8~\mathrm{mm}$ , significantly higher tha n that of the whole-round MS at $23{-}27~\mathrm{mm}$ . This resolution is useful for core sections containin g smaller broken pieces. The output displayed by the MSP sensor must be converted to dimensionless SI units by multiplying by $10^{-5}$ . The probe was zeroed in air before each measurement locatio n to avoid influence from the metal track. The MSP meter was calibrated by the manufacture r before installation on the ship and is quality checked approximately every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ simultaneously wit h color reflectance sensor calibration.  

# 6.7. Digital color imaging  

The SHIL captures continuous high-resolution images of the archive-half surface to aid analysi s and description. The system was used to image both dry and wet sections and uses a commercia l linescan camera lens (AF Micro Nikon; $60\ \mathrm{mm};\ 1{:}2.8\ \mathrm{D})$ . Illumination is provided by a custo m assembly of three pairs of light-emitting diode strip lights that provide constant illumination ove r a range of surface elevations. Each pair of lights has a color temperature of $6{,}500\mathrm{~K~}$ and emit s $90,000\ \mathrm{lux}$ at 3 inches. The resolution of the linescan camera was set at 10 pixels/mm. The focu s area for analyses is targeted by cropping the analytical field to optimize operations. Images ar e saved as high-resolution TIFF files along with a gray scale and ruler and reduced JPEG image s cropped to show only the section-half surfaces.  

# 6.8. Section Half Measurement Gantry measurements  

For soft-sediment cores, $P$ -wave velocity measurements were performed on working-half core s before any samples were taken. $P$ -wave velocity measurements were taken using the $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}.$ -axis PW C and $z_{\cdot}$ -axis PWB contact probe transducers on the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG ) (Figure F27), and typically one analysis was completed every other section. The $y$ -axis PWB wa s collected for the first two holes, but because of consistently poor coupling of the probes to th e sample and generally poor or erroneous results, this measurement was dropped from the analytical program. For the same reason, the $z_{\cdot}$ -axis PWB measurements were not taken for hard sediments and rocks. Measurements were usually taken from the least disturbed parts of the sectio n depending on core recovery because good core/transducer coupling is a requirement for viabl e data. XCB cores sometimes did not provide usable data because of bad sediment/liner contact an d disturbed sediment.  

![](images/547f765f331eec3005c3eaaf4d31b808d39a8a42cf4c6af4408e774b3e234a43.jpg)

Velocity variations within the hard rock volcanic sequences are crucial for the scientific objective s of Expedition 396, and as such, high-resolution $P$ -wave measurements were taken using the PW C throughout the cored sections. Early in the process of measuring $P$ -wave velocities it was realize d that removing half-round hard rock sections (individual core pieces typically $5{-}30\;\mathrm{cm}$ long) fro m the core liner for PWC $P$ -wave measurements returned superior signal-to-noise ratios and in tur n enabled significantly more measurements per core section than with the in-liner method.  

Providing wet and dry results, $P$ -wave velocities in $x-,y-,$ and $z_{\mathrm{\cdot}}$ -orientations using the PWC wer e also measured on the discrete $\{\sim}8\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ cubes chosen for both physical properties (MAD) and paleomagnetic measurements. Cubes were first saturated with seawater in a vacuum cell for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ prio r to the first $P$ -wave velocity measurement, and a second measurement was made after drying for 2 4 $_\mathrm{h}$ at $105\mathrm{^\circC}$ during standard MAD procedures.  

The PWC measures the traveltime of $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasonic waves vertically across the section hal f while still in the half liner at selected intervals or on discrete sample cubes cut from the sectio n halves. The distance between transducers is measured with a built-in linear voltage displacemen t transformer and regular calibration was performed using acrylic cylinders of differing thicknesse s with a known $P_{-}$ -wave velocity of $2730\,\pm\,20~\mathrm{m/s}$ . The calibration-derived system time delay wa s subtracted from the picked arrival time to give a traveltime of the $P_{-}$ -wave through the sample. Th e thickness of the sample after appropriate subtraction of the liner thickness was divided by the traveltime to calculate $P$ -wave velocity in meters per second. All first arrival picks for $P$ -wave measurements were manually quality controlled and revised from the automatic picking function, whic h often underestimated the first-break arrival by ${\sim}50{-}300\ \mathrm{m/s}$ for fresh samples with a good signa l and often became unreliable for noisier signals (e.g., within interlava sediments).  

# 6.9. Discrete sample measurements  

Discrete samples were collected from the working-half sections to measure wet and dry mass an d dry volume and to calculate wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grai n density using MAD procedures (Figure F28). Soft-sediment samples were collected in ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ volume plastic syringes. Samples were typically taken from every other core section (e.g., Section s 1, 3, and 5). Lithified sediment and hard rock lithologies were also sampled via minicores or smal l pieces from the working-half sections for physical properties measurements, and samples fro m igneous basement were also used for paleomagnetic measurements.  

Soft-sediment samples were placed in numbered, preweighed, $\sim\!16\,\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for we t and dry sediment weighing, drying, and dry volume measurements. To accurately determine th e wet mass of minicore samples, the pore space of the samples must be completely saturated wit h seawater. To achieve this, samples were placed in individual plastic vials filled with seawater in  a vacuum chamber. Air was removed from the chamber using a vacuum pump at pressures of ${\sim}40-$ $50\ \mathrm{kPa}$ below atmospheric pressure, forcing seawater into the samples. Samples were kept saturated for at least $24\,\mathrm{h},$ , and the vacuum was maintained in the chamber by turning the pump on fo r $30\ \mathrm{min}$ every $^{5\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ . Minicores were patted dry with a paper towel after removal from the saturato r before the wet mass was determined immediately afterward using the dual balance system. $P$ -wav e velocities were then also measured on the wet samples. Samples were then dried in a convectio n oven for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ , followed by cooling of the dried samples in a desiccator for a t least $4~\mathrm{h}$ before the dry mass and the volume were measured. $P$ -wave velocities were then measured on the dry samples to appraise saturation effects on velocity.

Figure F28. MAD analyses equipment. A. Desiccator and dual balance system. Drying oven is located below the desiccator. B. Pycnometer used for volume measurements of dry samples.  

Weights of wet and dry sample masses were determined to a precision of $0.005\,\mathrm{g}$ using two Mettle r Toledo electronic balances, with one acting as a reference. A standard weight of similar value t o the sample was placed upon the reference balance to increase accuracy. The ship’s motion was als o compensated for using a computer averaging system, with the default setting of the balances collecting 300 measurements and taking approximately $1.5\;\mathrm{min}$ .  

The volume of porous samples that cannot be confidently saturated, such as vesicular basalts, wa s determined by caliper measurements, resulting in a wet volume. Each dimension was either measured manually (i.e., the mean of at least three measurements) with an EZCal Fractional Digita l Caliper (precision $=0.01\;\mathrm{mm}$ ) or extracted from the PWC measurements on discrete wet samples. Height, width, and length were measured for cubes, and length and diameter were recorded fo r cylinders (e.g., minicores).  

The volume of dry samples was determined using a hexapycnometer system of a six-celled, custom-configured Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer. The precisio n of each cell is $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. The sample chamber was purged three times wit h helium warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ prior to volume measurement, and three measurement cycles were ru n for each sample. A reference volume (a set of two calibration spheres) was placed sequentially i n one of the chambers to check for instrument drift and systematic error. The volumes occupied b y the numbered Wheaton vials were calculated before the cruise by multiplying each vial’s weigh t against the average density of the vial glass. The procedures for the determination of these physica l properties comply with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) designation (D ) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). The fundamental relation and assumptions for the calculation s of all physical properties parameters are discussed by Blum (1997) and summarized below.  

MAD properties reported and plotted in the physical properties section of the site chapter wer e calculated with the MADMax shipboard program (v 2.0.0.7). Two submethods (C and D) wer e applied to calculate mass and volume, depending on suitability of the sample, and are explained i n greater detail below.  

Submethod C is only suitable for fine-grained, saturated sediments or fine-grained igneous materials. It requires known wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $\mathbf{\Gamma}(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volume $\big(V_{\mathrm{dry}}\big)$ to calculate densities and porosities. Salt precipitated in sediment pores during the drying process is included in th e $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ in the sample ar e given as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}},\mathrm{and}}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[s/(1-s)],}\end{array}
$$  

where $_s$ is the assumed saltwater salinity $(35\%)$ corresponding to a pore water density $\left(\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}\right)$ o f $1.024\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ of $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volum e of pore water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of salt $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , volume of solid s excluding salt $\left(V_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , and wet volume $\left<V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right>$ are as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},}\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}},\quad}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},\quad\quad}\\ {M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),}\\ {V_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}},}\end{array}
$$  

$V_{\mathrm{wet}}=V_{\mathrm{dry}}-V_{\mathrm{salt}}+V_{\mathrm{pw}}^{},$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Submethod D is suitable for porous rocks that cannot be confidently saturated. The submetho d requires known dry mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)$ , wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , and dry volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)$ , from which saturate d wet mass, porosity, and densities can be calculated. Total $\left(M_{\mathrm{t}}\right)$ , wet $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ and pore water mas s $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , and pore water volume $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ are calculated as follows:  

$$
M_{\mathrm{t}}=M_{\mathrm{dry}}+M_{\mathrm{wet}},
$$  

$$
M_{\mathrm{wet}}=\big(V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{dry}}\big)\uprho_{\mathrm{water}},
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}/\mathrm{r}=\big(V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{dry}}\big)/\mathrm{rv},:
$$  

$$
M_{\mathrm{pw}}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}\times\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}},
$$  

where the volume ratio (rv) is a computational constant of 0.988 (corresponding to $0.988~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ o f freshwater per $1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of seawater), and $V_{\mathrm{pw}},\,\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}},$ and $\uprho_{\mathrm{water}}$ are the volume and density of the por e water and water $(1\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , respectively. The water density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ is a computational constant of 1. Pore water density is a computational constant and assumes a salinity of $35\%0$ . The mass and volume of the solids is then calculated as follows:  

$$
M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{dry}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},\,\mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Regardless of the chosen submethod, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as the ratio of mass of por e water to wet sediment (total) mass:  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\rho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grain density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity $\left(\varphi\right)$ , and voi d ratio $\left(V_{\mathrm{R}}\right)$ are calculated as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{pdry}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ {\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{R}}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.
$$  

# 6.10. Processing and data availability  

All acquired data and metadata have been archived in the LIMS database without further processing aside from instrument-specific acquisition parameters. Data appraisal and filtering of these dat a were applied to the results described in the site chapters. Data appraisal did not include removal o f data associated with intervals interpreted as fall-in (see Lithostratigraphy). The outlined dat a appraisal was automated through use of custom Python scripting (Betlem et al., 2022) that take s LIMS data (in CSV format) and exports statistics (in Microsoft Excel format) and LAS files compatible with Advanced Logic Technology WellCAD and Schlumberger Petrel/TechLog software.  

Hard rock whole-round cores are separated into different segments during sample curation prio r to whole-round scanning, and extra space is added between core pieces. The raw measurement s on sections dominated by hard sediments and rocks (in XCB or RCB cores) should therefore b e taken with caution because the void space in the core liner affects density values as exemplified b y increased scatter in whole-round core scanning data and the recording of untenably low values o f GRA bulk density and $P$ -wave velocities.  

WRMSL measurement accuracy is affected by both the core diameter and competence (degree o f core disturbance/breakages), with thin diameter or damaged cores often leading to measuremen t underestimates compared to true values. As a standard, the instrument reports measurement s using the internal diameter of the common core liner $\left(66\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for typical sediment cores obtained by the APC system. However, fo r sediment and/or hard rock cored by the XCB or RCB systems, core diameter is often around 5 8 mm or less. Following Jarrard and Kerneklian (2007), the GRA bulk density measurements o f cores obtained using the XCB or RCB system may be corrected by multiplying the density value s by $66/58=1.138$ to account for this bias. Caliper measurements of whole-round core diameters a t Site U1565 were taken to appraise this factor (see Physical properties in the Site U1565 chapte r [Planke et al., 2023b]), confirming its applicability; this liner correction was then applied for GR A bulk density values as part of the processing procedures.  

To address scatter in the WRMSL data, any values measured within $\pm~1.5~\mathrm{cm}$ of the core piec e dividers (recorded during curation; see LIMS database) were filtered out of the WRMSL GRA bul k density and $P.$ -wave velocity data. Unlike the GRA density sensor and $P$ -wave velocity caliper, th e MS meter can still deliver important information about sample properties even with a very lo w core-to-liner volume ratio. For example, if a small recovered core volume has high MS, it still give s a clear signal. MS values were therefore not filtered based on bin proximity but were screened t o remove all negative values.  

Because of the larger integration volume of the NGR compared to the WRMSL, no standard dat a removal was undertaken based on hard rock core piece spacers. However, all NGRL data wer e screened to remove clearly anomalous negative values, along with those values with errors above $20\%$ .  

As a final standardized quality assurance step, the acquired data were screened against propertyspecific thresholds, as reported in the site chapters. WRMSL and PWC $P$ -wave velocity dat a implemented a lower cutoff of $1480~\mathrm{m/s},$ , below which values were removed during processing. GRA bulk density data screening typically implemented a lower threshold of $1.2\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , $1.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ for certain hard rock successions (as reported in the site chapters), corresponding in each case to  a value significantly below realistic minimum bulk density for the encountered lithologies; as such, these thresholds are regarded as conservative.  

Discrete sample MAD data were filtered based on realistic minimum bulk and grain density values of  1 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ . MAD data calculated by Submethod A were removed in line with IODP recommended practice.  

The LIMS database reports calculated thermal conductivity values that should be ignored becaus e they are calculated regardless of whether robust measured values were obtained. Instead, mea n measured thermal conductivity readings at identical intervals (typically up to three are take n during a single measurement) are provided and should be used for further analyses. Special caution should be given to measurements consisting only of a single reading, which have failed th e triplicate measurement that is in place to ensure repeatability.  

# 7. Downhole measurements  

Wireline logging tools were deployed in eight holes during Expedition 396 to determine the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the drilled formations. Wireline deployed logging tool s collect continuous data series at logging speeds up to several hundreds of meters per hour an d measure the in situ properties of the drilled formations. Wireline logging data have several advantages over core measurements because the core recovery is often incomplete and the cores ar e variably damaged and nonuniformly spaced because of partial recovery. In addition, core s undergo changes due to extraction such as pressure release, cooling, and drying, which can have  a potentially significant influence on surface measurements. Together with core-based data calibration, logging data enables drilled holes to be interpreted in terms of the continuous stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, magnetic characteristics, and geochemical composition of the penetrate d formation along with assessments of in situ stress states in holes where image logs are acquired. Logging data are also integral to the accurate depth matching and stratigraphic interpretation o f boreholes with incomplete core recovery.  

Downhole logs measure formation properties on a scale that is intermediate between thos e obtained from laboratory measurements on core samples and those from geophysical survey s such as seismic-gravity-magnetics and therefore form a critical component for accurate core-logseismic integration. Details on the wireline logging tool instrumentation and background measurement theory in this chapter are compiled based on extensive previous IODP expedition methodologies (including Tamura et al., 2015a; Sun et al., 2018; Sutherland et al., 2019).  

# 7.1. Logging tool strings  

During wireline logging operations, data were collected with Schlumberger logging tools combine d into several tool strings and lowered into the hole after completion of coring operations. Four IOD P tool string configurations were used (Figure F29). The modified triple combo tool string was typically run first to measure borehole fluid temperature, NGR, bulk density, and photoelectric effec t (PEF), electrical resistivity, and MS. The FMS-sonic tool string was typically run next to measur e sonic velocity ( $P_{-}$ -wave $[V_{\mathrm{p}}]$ and S-wave $[V_{\mathrm{S}}])$ ) and FMS resistivity images of the borehole wall. Th e UBI, which gives acoustic amplitude images of the borehole wall, was run in Holes U1566A an d U1571A only. The VSI tool string, which is used to generate a vertical seismic profile (VSP), was ru n in Hole U1566A only. Each tool string also contains an EDTC for communicating through the wireline to the Schlumberger data acquisition system (i.e., MAXIS on the drillship). The main too l strings, their measurements, and their typical resolutions are summarized in Table T11. A summar y of the tool acronyms and measurement units for the deployed logging tools is given in Table T12.

# 7.2. Wireline logging operations  

In preparation for logging, the boreholes were reamed in their lower sections, flushed of debris b y circulating drilling fluid, and filled with seawater-based logging gel (i.e., sepiolite mud mixed wit h seawater and weighted with barite) to help stabilize the borehole walls. The BHA was pulled up t o a logging depth determined by the borehole conditions (typically between 50 and $85\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF). Too l handling, deployment, and field data collection were undertaken by the onboard Schlumberge r wireline logging engineer prior to the data being sent onshore for processing. GR log data wa s typically collected while running the tool string into the hole from just above seafloor for QC an d in case of any downhole logging problems, such as a stuck tool, which could render the main logging pass impossible. The bottom of the open hole was confirmed during the first triple comb o logging run and was typically a few meters higher than the final coring depth because of cave-in s and the onset of hole collapse above. The first upward triple combo logging run also served t o assess the hole conditions using the single arm HLDS caliper. In some cases, the borehole ha d already collapsed or bridged off by the time logging tools could be run into the hole, resulting i n limited logging recovery. The primary data logging run was collected while raising the tool strin g upward at a constant speed, typically at around $300\;\mathrm{m/h}$ for the triple combo and $130{-}600\,\mathrm{m/h}$ fo r the FMS-sonic and UBI. A partial repeat logging run was also acquired for all tool strings to ai d depth matching and logging data QC, often prior to the main run.  

During wireline logging operations, the ship’s heave and ocean conditions affect the wireline tension and tool position in the well. A wireline heave compensator (WHC) system is used in conditions of increased swell to maintain a steady motion of the logging tools and to ensure high-qualit y logging data acquisition (Liu et al., 2013; Iturrino et al., 2013). The WHC was used for all open hol e logging operations regardless of sea state. The WHC uses a vertical accelerometer (motion reference unit [MRU]) positioned under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate th e vertical motion of the ship with respect to the seafloor. The length of the wireline is adjusted b y varying the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes to minimiz e downhole tool motion. Real-time measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleratio n are made simultaneously by the MRU and the EDTC, respectively, and software analyzes and compares the real-time data to monitor the efficiency of the compensator.  

# 7.3. Data processing  

Collected wireline data were sent for onshore processing by the LDEO-BRG. All original loggin g data was first depth matched to the total GR logging value from the main pass of the triple comb o logging run. Prominent features were matched manually between GR within all tool runs and th e reference GR log, and then all logging data within the same tool run were depth shifted by th e same set of corrections. All depth-matched logs were then shifted to the seafloor $\left(0\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ as define d by the clear increase in GR for this transition, resulting in the common depth reference WMSF i n meters. The Schlumberger Techlog software package was used for most of the wireline log dat a processing.  

Standard borehole size environmental corrections were applied to the HNGS (GR), HRLA (resistivity), and HLDS (density/photoelectric) of the triple combo tool string automatically durin g acquisition and quality checked by the Schlumberger wireline technician on board. The DSI wa s operated in the monopole $P$ -wave/S-wave, upper and lower dipole, and Stoneley modes durin g acquisition for all passes.  

FMS image log data were processed by applying speed corrections, equalization, button corrections, and depth shifting. Processing transforms the current intensity measurements into highresolution gray or color images of variable intensities. Intensity reflects the microresistivity variations of the formation. The darker colors reveal more conductive rock such as porous or deepl y altered zones along with fractures, whereas the lighter colors reveal more resistive units such a s dense crystalline units or cemented horizons. The integrated General Purpose Inclinometry Too l (GPIT) provides accelerometer and magnetometer data for constraining the tool position and spatial orientation relative to north, enabling features such as fractures to be measured for in sit u orientations.  

UBI image log data were processed by applying GPIT speed corrections, transit time radius conversions, amplitude eccentering corrections, transit time eccentering correction, radius eccenterin g correction, azimuth equalization, image rotation, depth adjustments, and image normalization. Data were delivered as processed digital log information standard (DLIS) format image log files.  

# 7.4. Quality control and data presentation  

The quality of the wireline data was assessed during both acquisition and processing by checkin g recorded values against reference values for the logged lithologies, evaluating repeatabilit y between different passes of the same tool (down, main, and repeat), and assessing the correspondence between logs affected by the same formation property (e.g., the resistivity log should sho w similar features to the sonic velocity log). In general, very good correlation exists between the density, resistivity, and compressional velocities for logged intervals. Wireline GR and the MSS als o generally reveal good quality data, in most cases matching well with equivalent core-based values. GR logs recorded through the BHA and drill pipe are influenced by significant attenuation of th e incoming signal, resulting in reduced absolute GR values that should be used only qualitatively. Detailed comparison between these sections and the open hole data are restricted for this reason.  

A wide $_{>12}$ inches) or irregular borehole affects most wireline logging recordings, in particula r those that require eccentralization and good contact with the borehole wall such as the HLDS an d FMS.  

Mechanical caliper arms in the triple combo HLDS (LCAL) and FMS-sonic (C1 and C2) loggin g runs were often closed from 3 to $10\;\mathrm{m}$ or sometimes greater distances below the end of the dril l string casing. Closure of the calipers causes nongeological changes in caliper-calibrated wirelin e measurements such as density, PEF, and GR. Furthermore, the depth at which the calipers close d is often not the same between the FMS-sonic and triple combo logging runs; therefore, data comparisons between these runs and the rest of the borehole and the core data are integral for robus t integration.  

Data received back on board by the downhole logging scientist group were uploaded into the WellCAD software along with associated core-derived physical properties data. WellCAD template s were developed for consistent data presentation and used for all Expedition 396 sites.  

FMS image log data is in general very good with high-resolution images returned for all interval s where the logging tool was deployed. Minor sticking artifacts were recorded and flagged, wherea s for intervals with good imaging, key geological and structural features such as fractures, beddin g planes, and vesicles were recorded.  

The UBI acoustic image log tool delivered mixed results with generally lower image resolutio n than overlapping FMS images. However, the fact that the UBI gives an image of the entire borehol e wall rather than the thin strips of the FMS pads proved useful for appraising the presence an d continuity of subvertical fractures and contacts in certain cases.  

# 7.5. Measurement principals  

# 7.5.1. Natural gamma radiation  

The HNGS measures the NGR of a formation. Standard (total) GR is reported as total spectral G R (HSGR) in American Petroleum Institute gamma radiation units [gAPI] throughout the Downhol e measurements section in each site chapter. The HNGS response is influenced by borehole diameter and requires borehole diameter corrections (caliper derived) during acquisition. Two bismut h germanate scintillation detectors in the HNGS tool string measure potassium (weight percent), thorium (parts per million), and uranium (parts per million) concentrations from the characteristic GR energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series that dominate th e natural radiation spectrum.  

In addition to the HNGS, the EDTC also houses a total GR sensor. The inclusion of a GR tool i n every tool string allows the use of GR data for precise depth matching between logging runs, aid s core-log integration, and enables precise identification of the seafloor.  

# 7.5.2. Density and photoelectric effect  

Formation density is measured using the HLDS. The HLDS contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ GR source $(622\;\mathrm{keV})$ and far and near GR detectors mounted on a shielded skid that is presse d against the borehole wall by a decentralizing arm. The tool emits gamma radiation, which undergoes Compton scattering, and the GR signal received by the detectors is proportional to the density of electrons in the formation, which is in turn related to bulk density. Throughout this report, wireline bulk density is presented as the HLDS corrected bulk density (RHOM) in grams per cubi c centimeter. The density log is commonly the best downhole tool for assessing porosity where th e matrix (grain) density is known or can be accurately estimated and is particularly important fo r volcanic and clay-bearing rocks, which suffer from poor neutron porosity determinations becaus e of clay-bound water (Broglia and Ellis, 1990).  

PEF gives a measure of the photoelectric absorption of low-energy gamma radiation and is als o measured using the HLDS. Photoelectric absorption occurs when the energy of the gamma ray s falls below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of scattering by electrons in the formation. PEF is determined b y comparing the counts from the far detector in the high-energy region, where only Compton scattering occurs, to those in the low-energy region, where count rates depend on both reactions. Because PEF depends on the atomic number of the elements in the formation (heavier element s have higher PEF), it also varies according to the chemical composition of the minerals present an d can aid assessment of the matrix mineralogy. The PEF delivers data in barn/e− units and require s good contact between the tool and the borehole wall; poor contact results in underestimation o f density values. Both the density correction and caliper measurement of the hole are used to chec k hole conditions and assess likely contact quality. Barium in the logging mud can distort PEF signals even with corrections for mud effects and should therefore be treated with extra caution i n poor hole conditions.  

# 7.5.3. Electrical resistivity  

The HRLA tool records six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigatio n (including the borehole fluid resistivity and five progressively deeper measurements of formatio n resistivity). The HRLA tool sends a focused current into the formation and measures the intensit y necessary to maintain a constant drop in voltage across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivit y measurement. Three depths of investigation, including shallow (RLA1), medium (RLA3), and tru e (RT_HRLT) resistivity measurements are presented in the Downhole measurements section i n each site chapter, with RT_HRLT representing an estimate of the true formation from the are a least influenced by drilling fluid invasion. The tool is designed to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the same time and tool position and to reduce the sensitivity to “shoulder bed ” effects when crossing beds thinner than the electrode spacing. The HRLA is run centralized in th e borehole for optimal results. Knuckle joints are used to centralize the HRLA while allowing th e density tool to maintain good contact with the borehole wall. The HRLA gives an effective measurement of formation resistivity, allowing the full range of resistivity to be measured, from highporosity brine saturated sediments (low resistivity) to hard dense basalt formations (high resistivity).  

# 7.5.4. Acoustic velocity  

The DSI generates acoustic pulses from various sonic transmitters and records the waveform s with an array of eight receivers. The waveforms are then used to calculate sonic $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ velocities in the formation. The omnidirectional monopole transmitter emits high-frequency (5–1 5 kHz) pulses to extract the $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ of the formation, as well as $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ when it is faster than the sound velocity in the borehole fluid. The DSI also has two cross-dipole transmitters that allow an additiona l measurement of shear wave velocity in slow (e.g., poorly consolidated) formations, where $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ i s slower than the velocity in the borehole fluid. The waveforms produced by the two orthogona l dipole transducers can be used to identify sonic anisotropy that can potentially be associated wit h variations in the local stress regime.  

# 7.5.5. Formation MicroScanner  

The FMS imaging sonde is used to map bedding features, fractures, faults, igneous jointing, an d large pore structures such as volcanic vesicles and alteration features and can aid in the correlatio n of coring and logging depths. High-resolution FMS data can also substantially improve lithofacie s assessments for intervals where poor or incomplete core recovery prevails. The sonde consists o f four imaging pads each with 16 microelectrode buttons that must be in direct contact with th e borehole wall during recording. The four pads emit a focused electric current into the formation. The button array on each pad is spaced at $2.5~\mathrm{mm}$ intervals to measure current intensity variations. In smooth boreholes with homogeneous bedding, the depth of investigation is about $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ (10 inches). The vertical resolution is typically $5\;\mathrm{mm}$ (0.2 inches). The FMS log delivers four pa d traces that give approximately $25\%$ borehole wall coverage for a 10 inch diameter hole and ar e oriented north to enable oriented feature mapping.  

# 7.5.6. Ultrasonic Borehole Imager  

The UBI features a high-resolution transducer that provides acoustic images of the borehole wal l including amplitude and transit time. The UBI, similar to the FMS tool, gives important information about bedding planes, fractures, dips, etc., along with important information on borehol e conditions, drilling-induced fractures, and breakouts. Unlike the FMS, the UBI gives a complet e $360^{\circ}$ image of the borehole wall and can therefore significantly help in facies appraisal and corelog-seismic integration. The rotating transducer incorporated in the UBI is both a transmitter an d a receiver. The UBI is logged with the transducer operating at either 250 or $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ with associated implications for both image quality and operational timings (e.g., $\mathrm{250\kHz;648\m/h;1.02\cm}$ vertical resolution compared to $500\,\mathrm{kHz}$ ; $130\,\mathrm{m/h}$ ; 0.51 cm vertical resolution).  

The tool is relatively insensitive to eccentralization as high as $0.6\,\mathrm{cm}$ and can yield high-resolutio n images where borehole conditions are good and on gauge. Processing software further enhance s UBI images by correcting amplitude and transit time information for the effects of logging spee d variations and tool eccentering and by applying noise filtering. UBI images are oriented with inclinometry data from the combinable GPIT. Both static and normalized images are generated, an d each gives different insights into the drilled formation.  

# 7.5.7. Magnetic susceptibility  

The MSS uses a single-coil sensor to measure borehole MS in approximate SI units referred t o here as noncalibrated instrument units (IU) at a vertical resolution of ${\sim}12~\mathrm{cm}$ with shallow $\langle\sim\!3$ cm) depth of penetration. A lower resolution $(\sim\!36\,\mathrm{cm})$ but greater depth of penetration $\left(36\thinspace\mathrm{cm}\right)$ i s also collected (LSUSR), which provides a quality check for the higher resolution reading. MS is th e ease with which formations are magnetized when subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetization is related to the size, distribution, and composition of magnetic minerals in the formation (e.g., magnetite). These measurements are extremely useful both for correlation an d stratigraphic analyses and give critical insights into the presence and nature of volcanic ash layers, which is important for Expedition 396. The MSS is run as the lowest logging tool in the tripl e combo tool string and therefore collects one of the largest open hole coverages of all the loggin g tools. The sensor is an electric inductor constructed such that when positioned against the borehole wall, its inductance is affected by the volume susceptibility of the formation within the measured formation rock volume.  

The tool is calibrated to a $9\%$ inch borehole diameter, and larger or washed out holes will result i n lower susceptibility measurements, whereas higher temperatures lead to higher susceptibilit y measurements. Temperature measurements were not run alongside the MSS. For QC and environmental corrections, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $z_{\cdot}$ -axis acceleration, an d low-resolution borehole conductivity.  

# 7.5.8. Acceleration and inclinometry  

The GPIT was also run as part of the FMS-sonic and UBI tool strings. The GPIT uses a three-axi s inclinometer and a three-axis magnetometer to determine tool deviation, tool azimuth, and relative bearing. It relies on the accurate measuring of the tool system axis with respect to the Earth’ s gravity (G) and magnetic field (F). A relation between the tool and the Earth system can then b e defined because both $\mathrm{G}$ and F are well defined. The MAXIS computes deviation, azimuth, an d relative bearing from the magnetometer $(\mathsf{F}x,\,\mathsf{F}y_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and $\mathrm{F}z$ ) and inclinometer $(\mathsf{A}x,\mathsf{A}y$ , and $\mathrm{A}z_{.}$ ) readings at a vertical resolution of $15.24\;\mathrm{cm}$ and accuracy of $\pm2\%$ .  

# 7.5.9. Versatile Seismic Imager  

The VSI consists of three parts (a measurement sonde, power cartridge, and control cartridges). The configuration of the tool, including the number of sensor packages, sensor spacing, and typ e of connection, can all be varied to optimize acquisition for specific hole targets.  

The tool collects seismic data by anchoring itself in the hole at the desired depth using a calipe r arm. The accelerometer package is then pressed firmly against the formation while remainin g decoupled acoustically from the body of the shuttle. Air guns are deployed at the surface from th e ship by crane, and the resulting acoustic wave is recorded downhole on three axes. The anchoring, size, and acoustic isolation of the sensors allow for suppression of the tool's harmonic noise an d removal of tube waves from the borehole-seismic band. A single shuttle comprising in total on e measurement sonde, one power cartridge, and one control cartridge was employed during Expedition 396. The VSI tool was run with the standard HNGS GR tool, which enabled GR reading s from deeper in the well section of Hole U1566A because GR has to be run at the top of the too l string in the triple combo so as not to be affected by active sources.  

# 7.5.10. Downhole temperature measurement  

In situ temperature measurements were made using the APCT-3 tool when the APC system wa s deployed in Holes U1572B and U1574C. The APCT-3 tool fits into the APC coring shoe an d includes a battery pack, data logger, and platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over  a temperature range of $0^{\circ}{-}30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . During deployment, the tool is first stopped at the mudline to thermally equilibrate with bottom water for 5 min. When the APC system is deployed into the formation, there is an instantaneous temperature rise from frictional heating. This heat graduall y dissipates into the surrounding formation as the temperature at the APCT-3 tool equilibrate s toward the temperature of the sediment. After the APC system penetrates the sediment, it is hel d in place for 5 min while the APCT-3 tool records the temperature of the cutting shoe every second.  

A preliminary APCT-3 tool measurement evaluation was carried out aboard ship using the TP-Fi t v.3 software (Heesemann, 2008). This involved picking the entry time and two points on the temperature equilibration path to capture the temperature decay after the frictional heating caused b y lance entry and the second frictional heat pulse caused by lance retrieval. APCT-3 tool temperature data is combined with thermal conductivity measurements on the core (see Physical properties) to retrieve heat flow values.
