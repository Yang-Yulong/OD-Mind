# Acknowledgments  

The Scientific Party of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 328 would like to express their appreciation to the IODP shipboard technical, operations, and engineering personnel and shore-based support staff. Master Terry Skinner, the Transocean officers, and the crew on the R/V JOIDES Resolution provided exceptional shipboard service. We benefited during Expedition 328 from the hard work, ingenuity, experience, and good humor of these multitalented personnel. We are particularly grateful for the concerted effort from Transocean rig floor personnel and IODP technical and engineering staff that allowed rapid assembly and trouble-free emplacement of the Advanced CORK (ACORK). Support for the design and construction of the wellhead instrumentation prior to the expedition was provided by Robert Macdonald, Robert Meldrum, James Guenther, John Bennest, Jonathan Schmidt, and David Miles.  

# A Cascadia ACORK caper  

Two decades have passed since a beer-prompted brainstorm To plug holes in the ocean that leaked every rainstorm. CORKs they were called, and corking they did Very well; seafloor Champagne was kept under lid.  

Until one October, the weather was rough... It made that first trip here frustratingly tough. Formation squeezed in, the seal was broken Now we’ve come back again, trepidation unspoken.  

In the years that have passed we’ve found some new tricks We can use to decipher our subduction fault’s ticks. Seafloor spreading won’t stop, nor chronic plate motion, But we’ll watch as things happen down under the ocean.  

Cascadia’s fault is building up stress, Squeezing water from rock, doing things not yet guessed. But please not the big ’quake, we’re not ready for that Let’s all cross our fingers for a long-delayed snap.  

Now a toast: To the JR, always eager, on call, To the funders who trust us to not drop the ball, To NEPTUNE, the sea god who’ll give us some power And time syncs more frequent than once every hour, To the schedulers who found us a window of time For our little CORK caper, no cores, how sublime!  

# Abstract  

The operational objective of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 328 was the installation of a new permanent hydrologic borehole observatory near Ocean Drilling Program Site 889. The format of the new installation followed the Advanced CORK design, which will facilitate pressure monitoring at multiple formation levels on the outside of a $10\%$ inch casing string. The observatory was successfully installed during the expedition and will allow documentation of the average state of pressure in the frontal part of the Cascadia accretionary prism, the pressure gradients driving flow from the consolidating sediments, the mode of formation of gas hydrates, the influence of gas hydrates and free gas on the mechanical properties of their host lithology, the response of the material to seismic ground motion, and the magnitude of deformation at the site caused by secular strain and episodic seismic and aseismic slip in this subduction setting. The casing was sealed at the bottom, leaving the inside available for future installation of additional monitoring instruments. At a later date, the observatory will be connected to the NEPTUNE Canada fiber-optic cable for power and real-time communications from land.  

# Introduction  

Operations carried out during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 328 were devoted to the installation of a hydrologic observatory near Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 889, the location chosen for a CORK (circulation obviation retrofit kit) observatory installation during ODP Leg 146 in 1992 (Westbrook, Carson, Musgrave, et al., 1994; Davis et al., 1995). In that early attempt, the relatively unstable sediments of the formation rapidly intruded through the perforations and bottom of an open-ended casing liner and prevented proper sealing of the hole. The new installation utilizes the Advanced CORK (ACORK) design, developed initially for installations at the Nankai subduction zone during ODP Leg 196 to permit pressure monitoring at multiple formation levels on the outside of a $10\%$ inch casing string. The casing is sealed at the bottom, leaving the inside available for future installation of additional monitoring instruments.  

A broad range of objectives will be addressed with monitoring over the decades to follow, some the same as those to have been addressed by the installation at Site 889, including documenting the average state of pressure and the vertical component of fluid flow from the consolidating sediments in the frontal part of the Cascadia accretionary prism and investigating the mode of formation of gas hydrates. Other objectives have been added subsequently as a result of the multiple discrete monitoring levels provided by the ACORK configuration, advances in measurement resolution, and knowledge gained from other monitoring experiments. These include determining the influence of gas hydrates and free gas on the mechanical properties of their host lithology, the response of the formation to seismic ground motion, and the magnitude of strain at the site caused by episodic seismic and aseismic slip in this subduction setting. Instrumentation deployed at the time of drilling includes autonomously recorded seafloor and formation pressure sensors and seafloor temperature sensors. Sensors planned for deployment inside the sealed casing at a later date will measure temperature, tilt, and seismic ground motion. It is planned that all instruments will soon be connected to the NEPTUNE-Canada fiber-optic cable for power and real-time communications from land. This will permit sensor sampling rates, time accuracy, and monitoring lifetime that are much greater than would be possible with autonomous operation using battery power and locally stored data. The program grew from an ODP Letter of Intent submitted by E. Davis and Roy Hyndman and IODP Ancillary Project Letter 734 by E. Davis and Keir Becker.  

# Geologic context  

IODP Site U1364 lies roughly $20\;\mathrm{km}$ landward of the toe of the Cascadia subduction zone accretionary prism, where much of the thick section of turbidite and hemipelagic sediments deposited on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge are scraped off the underthrusting oceanic crust (Fig. F1). Convergence of the Juan de Fuca oceanic plate relative to the North American continental plate occurs in a direction roughly normal to the continental margin and at a rate of roughly $42\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ (DeMets et al., 1990). A topographic trench at this subduction zone is absent as a consequence of the extremely high rate of glacial sediment supply from the continent during the Pleistocene. The majority of the supply has been impounded by the elevated igneous crustal topography of the Juan de Fuca Ridge to form what is called Cascadia Basin. At the accretionary prism toe (also referred to as the deformation front, where the thrust-fault interplate interface intersects the seafloor), the sediments of Cascadia Basin are $>\!2\;\mathrm{km}$ thick; at Site U1364 the accreted sedimentary section is roughly twice this thickness (Fig. F2). With tectonic thickening and compaction, pore fluids are expelled, and gas—primarily biogenic methane—is transported upward to contribute to the formation of gas hydrates in the upper few hundred meters of the sediment section. The location for Site U1364 was chosen on the same basis as that for Site 889. It lies at a position landward of the prism toe where the fluid expulsion rate, estimated on the basis of the rates of compaction and vertical growth of the prism, reaches a cross-margin maximum and where a clearly developed bottom simulating reflector marks the base of the gas hydrate stability field (Davis et al., 1990). Other holes drilled earlier during ODP Leg 146 and IODP Expedition 311 (Westbrook, Carson, Musgrave, et al., 1994; Riedel, Collett, Malone, et al., 2006) documented the nature of the incoming undeformed sediments, the compaction history during accretion, the details of the sediment lithology, and the distribution and composition of gas hydrates across the area. This information, along with extensive site survey studies (Schwerwath et al., 2006; Riedel et al., 2010) provided an excellent basis for planning the depth, location, and other details of the ACORK installation at Site U1364 and will provide a valuable context for anticipated ACORK observations.  

Seafloor morphology in the vicinity of Site U1364 (Fig. F3) reveals an active and heterogeneous accretional, depositional, and erosional geologic regime. The deformation front/prism toe is marked by uplifted anticlinal ridges, thrust fault traces, and local slope failures with accompanying debris deposits on the adjacent Cascadia Basin abyssal plain. In several places, the uplifted frontal structures are cut by canyons that funnel gravity-driven sediment transport from sources higher on the continental slope and outer shelf. Large scours and sand waves can be seen where these empty into Cascadia Basin. Headless canyons are common high on the slope, terminating at the shelf-slope break.  

A closer look in the area of Site U1364 (Fig. F4) shows seafloor manifestations of focused fluid discharge. Seafloor seeps and vents discharge water expelled from the thickening prism, and in many instances free gas is transported across the $250\,\mathrm{m}$ thick zone of gas hydrate stability by relatively rapid focused upward flow. No vents have been observed in the immediate vicinity of Site U1364, but those that are present in the area (e.g., “Bullseye vent” and other locations where pock-marks, carbonate mounds, and gas hydrates are present at the seafloor) demonstrate that super-hydrostatic pore-fluid pressure and free gas are present beneath the seafloor.  

A simplified schematic cross section in Figure F5 illustrates one way gas hydrates are believed to accumulate in accretionary prisms. Pore-fluid expulsion, driven by tectonic thickening and consolidation, is rapid near the prism toe and diminishes landward. Vertical migration of water from the prism delivers small amounts of dissolved methane produced in the sediment by biological $C O_{2}$ reduction to the level of gas hydrate stability (a weak function of pressure and strong function of temperature), where gas hydrates accumulate primarily in permeable fractures and coarse-grained layers. The boundary between sediments containing free gas and sediments containing gas hydrate in the sediment pore volume may be enhanced as a result of methane recycling at the phase boundary from vertical tectonic motion, sedimentation, and erosion (Haacke et al., 2007). This boundary is seen in seismic profiles throughout the Site U1364 area as a bright reflection (the bottom-simulating reflector) at a generally uniform depth below the seafloor (a consequence of its depth being primarily temperature controlled), with a polarity opposite to that from the seafloor (Fig. F6).  

Seismic reflection profiles crossing Site U1364 (Fig. F6) (Riedel, 2001) also provide a clear image of the local sediment structure, which comprises a gently deformed sequence of slope-basin deposits draped over highly deformed accretionary prism sediments. Accreted and deformed sediment occurs close to the seafloor or in outcrop in the high-standing area southeast of Site U1364 (Fig. F4); this lithology plunges northwest and is buried by a veneer of gently deformed locally deposited slope-basin sediments roughly $100\;\mathrm{m}$ thick at the location of Site U1364. These lithologic units have been characterized in detail by coring and logging at the numerous holes drilled in the immediate vicinity of Site U1364 (Fig. F4) (Westbrook, Carson, Musgrave, et al., 1994; Riedel, Collett, Malone, et al., 2006; Riedel et al., 2010; see next section). The gas/gas hydrate interface responsible for the extensive bottom-simulating reflector was intersected by these holes at a depth of roughly 225 meters below seafloor (mbsf), well within the deformed prism unit. Gas hydrates above the interface appear to be virtually absent in fine-grained sediments; most of the gas hydrate is concentrated in permeable coarse-grained units and massive gas hydrate lenses that mark present or past pathways of focused fluid flow.  

# Lithostratigraphy at Site U1364  

# Site 889  

Core and log data from Site 889 showed three major lithostratigraphic units within the uppermost 400 mbsf. Lithostratigraphic Unit I was divided into Subunits IA and IB. Subunit IA (seafloor to 87 mbsf in Hole 889A) comprises mostly clayey silts and silty clays with interbedded thin sand layers. This unit is characterized by subhorizontal to gently dipping beds with little deformation and was interpreted to be turbidites and pelagic sediments deposited in a slope basin. Subunit IB (91–128 mbsf in Hole 889A) is also mainly silty clay but with fewer sand layers. It was interpreted that the sediments in Subunit IB represent a series of sediment gravity flow deposits caused by tectonic uplift at the deformation front and thus a transition between the abyssal plain sedimentation of lithostratigraphic Units II and III to the subsequent deposition of Subunit IA, which represents slope basin sedimentation.  

Units II and III consist of mainly clayey silt with a low abundance of sand layers and are distinguished only by an increase in glauconite in Unit III. No structural differences between these two units were observed. They were interpreted as typical abyssal plain sediments that were heavily deformed and fractured during the accretion process. Seismic profiles show that Subunit IB has also suffered deformation, and the boundary between accreted and slope sediments was placed at ${\sim}90$ mbsf within Unit I.  

# Site U1327  

Five holes were drilled at Site U1327 (Riedel, Collett, Malone, et al., 2006), and the section was divided into three main lithostratigraphic units that differ from those defined at the time of Leg 146. Unit I $\mathrm{0{-}90\ m b s f}$ ; age ${<}0.3\mathrm{\;Ma}$ ) comprises dark greenish gray and dark gray clay and silty clay, often interbedded with silt, clayey silt, sandy silt, sand, and gravel layers. It is characterized by fine-grained detrital sediments (clay and silty clay) with abundant coarse-grained layers as thick as $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ that indicate turbidity flow deposition. Some carbonate cement is present. The boundary between Units I and II is marked by a sharp decrease in sand and silt layers and a sharp increase in the abundance of diatoms. The average rate of sedimentation was estimated to be $22\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ .  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II (90–170 mbsf; age $>\!0.3–1.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) comprises dark greenish gray and dark gray clay; clay with diatoms; and silty clay, silty clay with diatoms, and diatom silty clay locally interbedded with sandy silt and sand layers and lenses. Very few carbonate cements are present. Soupy and mousselike sediment textures correlated with cold sections in the core imaged with an infrared scanner; these were inferred to be the consequence of the dissociation of interstitial gas hydrate during recovery. The average sedimentation rate for Unit II is estimated at ${\sim}16\;\mathrm{cm/k.y}$ . Intervals with a high ratio of nonmarine versus marine diatoms indicate an increased contribution of terrigeneous detrital sediments from land sources by turbidites. The great abundance of marine diatoms along with spores suggests initial deposition beneath a coastal upwelling environment followed by reworking by turbidity currents.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit III (170–300 mbsf; age ${>}1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ) comprises dark greenish gray and dark gray silty clay, with some exotic rock clasts. Diatoms are absent immediately below the Unit II/III boundary, although diatoms reappear below 248 mbsf. Unit III is distinguished from Unit II by a higher degree of induration of the sediments compared to lithostratigraphic Unit II. Carbonate cements are rare. The depositional environment for Unit III was interpreted to have been dominated by low-energy turbidity currents in an abyssal plain environment. The biostratigraphically estimated average sedimentation rate in this section is $12\;\mathrm{cm/k.y.}$ .  

# Site U1327 logging data  

Physical property variations defined by logging at Site U1327 (Fig. F7) do not reflect the lithostratigraphy described above in any obvious way, but they provide valuable contextual information about the section spanned by the Site U1364 ACORK. General trends of increasing bulk density, electrical resistivity, and sonic velocity and decreasing porosity with depth are defined, with porosity ranging from roughly 0.7 at the seafloor (measured on cores) to ${\sim}0.50$ at 300 mbsf. A major anomaly is seen in the logging-while-drilling (LWD) data between 120 and 145 mbsf. This is inferred to reflect a localized massive hydrate horizon (defined only in Hole U1327A). At 230 mbsf, a decrease in resistivity is seen in the resistivity logs and the resistivity-at-the-bit (RAB) image, as are sharp decreases in density and sonic velocity and an increase in porosity. These changes, and the change in character of the RAB image, are consistent with gas hydrates being present in discrete layers above 230 mbsf and gas being present below. The ACORK screens are distributed roughly symmetrically around this boundary; screens 1 and 2 lie at 74 and $14\;\mathrm{m}$ below and screens 3 and 4 lie at 27 and $74\,\mathrm{m}$ above the boundary, respectively.  

# Seismotectonic context  

Much of the motivation for establishing a borehole observatory at Site U1364 derives from a need to understand the nature of deformation across the full width of a subduction zone like Cascadia that hosts infrequent but very large (Mw ${\sim}9$ ) earthquakes generated along the subduction thrust interface. Recent events include Kamchatka (1952), southern Chile (1960), eastern Aleutians (1964), and Sumatra (2004). The most recent “megathrust” earthquake at Cascadia is known from tsunami records in Japan to have taken place in 1700 (Satake et al., 1996), and the interval between large events estimated from sequences of tsunami deposits in coastal and offshore areas ranges from 200 to 800 y (Goldfinger et al., 2003; Leonard et al., 2010). Very large subduction earthquakes are known to be generated by rupture propagating along segments ${\sim}1000\ \mathrm{km}$ long, but the precise width and position of the seismogenic rupture surface is only modestly well constrained. Updip and downdip limits of rupture are controlled by factors including rock mechanical properties (influenced by temperature and composition), fluid pressure, and interface roughness; observationally, the limits are typically estimated on the basis of seismic radiation patterns of great earthquakes and vertical and horizontal coseismic and postseismic deformation where it can be measured in adjacent subaerial areas. Slow interseismic deformation also provides information about seismogenic deformation, as they are very approximate mirror images of one another. The zone of seismic coupling is offshore in most subduction zones, so constraints from land-based observations provide an incomplete and biased view; observations like those to be made at Site U1364 are bound to add invaluable insight into both interseismic and seismogenic behavior of subduction zones. We anticipate that slow interseismic strain accumulation may be resolved, and it is possible that aseismic deformation events may be present, as have been observed along the subduction thrusts at Costa Rica (Davis and Villinger, 2006; Davis et al., submitted) and the Nankai Trough (Davis et al., 2009) (e.g., Fig. F8).  

In addition to the Cascadia subduction zone being host to occasional giant thrust earthquakes, local plate motions generate frequent earthquakes with smaller magnitudes (Fig. F9). To the northwest of Site U1364, strike-slip events are concentrated along the Nootka fault, the strike-slip boundary between the Juan de Fuca and Explorer oceanic plates. Along the continental margin, intraplate events occur within the overriding continental crust and within the oceanic crust of the subducting Juan de Fuca and Explorer plates (Fig. F9A). Further landward, seismic tremor occurs episodically along and above the top of the subducting plate, downdip of the thrust seismogenic zone (Kao et al., 2009) (Fig. F9B). Strain associated with local seismic events is known to be detectable as pressure transients (e.g., Fig. F10), and the comparison of the strain estimated from pressure with the strain estimated from seismic moments will provide invaluable information about seismic rupture processes in the oceanic crust and upper mantle, the continental crust, and the more consolidated parts of the accretionary prism. The possible frequency of occurrence of events that can be resolved in the CORK pressure records at Site U1364 is illustrated in Figure F11, which shows the seismic recurrence relationship for the region around the drill site. The known sensitivity to strain produced by earthquakes of magnitudes as low as $\mathrm{Mw}=5$ at a range of up to $100~\mathrm{km}$ (Fig. F10) suggests that strain transients of one or more events per year should be resolved at Site U1364.  

Beyond these scientific considerations, a number of technical factors added to the motivation to establish a geophysical observatory at this site. High reliability of CORK instrumentation has been demonstrated through successful long-term operations at many sites. Instruments deployed during Leg 196 (Nankai Trough) have been operating for ${>}8\,\mathrm{y},$ and those deployed during ODP Legs 168 and 169 have been in operation for ${>}13$ y. Improvements in power consumption, memory capacity, and resolution now permit detection of much subtler signals than were previously possible. And in this instance, connection to the NEPTUNE-Canada cabled observatory infrastructure will open new opportunities. Much higher sampling frequency will be achieved, allowing observations to reach into the seismic frequency band (Fig. F12) and to be placed in the context of collocated seismic and hydrologic records that are currently being collected with a broadband seismometer and a variety of seafloor vent monitoring instruments roughly $3.5\,\mathrm{km}$ from the Site U1364 ACORK borehole observatory, as well as those that will be collected with additional instrumentation planned for Hole U1364A.  

# The Site U1364 ACORK observatory configuration  

# Background  

Starting in the late 1980s, ODP engineers and scientists developed the CORK hydrologic observatory system to seal cased boreholes at the seafloor and allow the formation state to be monitored continuously for years after drilling (Davis et al., 1992). In 1991, the first CORKs were installed in two holes drilled through sediment and into igneous basement in the Middle Valley rift of the northernmost Juan de Fuca Ridge (Davis and Becker, 1994), with the goal of determining the natural hydrologic state of this hydrothermally active setting (i.e., after the large perturbations from drilling and open-hole conditions had dissipated). Other sites followed, including two in the Cascadia accretionary prism (Davis et al., 1995), two in the Barbados accretionary prism (Becker et al., 1997; Foucher et al., 1997), four on the eastern Juan de Fuca Ridge flank (Davis and Becker, 1998, 1999), one on the western Mid-Atlantic Ridge flank (Davis et al., 2000; Becker et al., 2001), and one in a Mariana forearc serpentinite diapir (Salisbury, Shinohara, Richter, et al., 2002; Wheat et al., 2008). Although the specific objectives of these installations have differed, all of the monitoring experiments have made use of the basic CORK capabilities to monitor seafloor and formation temperatures and pressures over long periods of time. Beginning with the Barbados installations, fluid samplers were added to some of the temperature sensor cables to allow continuous sampling of deep-formation water. At several of the CORK sites, additional sampling and hydrologic testing experiments have been completed using valves that allow controlled access to the sealed sections (e.g., Screaton et al., 1995, 1997).  

These original CORKs succeeded in preventing borehole flow, allowed formation pressures to be measured accurately, and allowed temperatures to be determined at multiple depths. However, use of only a single seal meant that the formation pressure observed and fluid samples collected reflected averages over the open sections of the holes (i.e., either the entire length of open hole beneath casing in igneous basement or the length of perforated casing within sediments). Determinations of local pressure gradients were not possible. This limitation, along with the success of the initial CORK design, stimulated interest in enhancing the capabilities to include monitoring of multiple zones in a single hole and to permit a greater range of sensor capabilities.  

These objectives were addressed with the ACORK (Mikada et al., 2002; Becker and Davis, 2005), designed for a variety of applications and installed for the first time during Leg 196 for a long-term monitoring experiment in the Nankai subduction zone. Other variations of the CORK system followed (e.g., Jannasch et al., 2003; Becker and Davis, 2005; Fisher et al., 2005). All take greater advantage of individual boreholes by utilizing packers and screens to allow pressures to be observed at multiple levels, just as is often done in terrestrial hydrologic experiments. The ACORK system consists of a 10.75 inch outer diameter, 10.05 inch inner diameter casing string with modular screened monitoring elements positioned at desired depths. The initial ACORKs included hydraulically inflated packer elements to isolate screens, although experience from Nankai monitoring showed that collapse of the formation provided good hydrologic isolation in intervals where no packers were used and experience elsewhere demonstrated that hydraulically inflated packers were ineffectual for long-term use. Pressure monitoring and/or fluid sampling is done via a multiline hydraulic umbilical strapped to the outside of the casing. Hydraulic lines from each level pass successively through packers and screens above and are then plumbed into a seafloor framework that houses sampling and testing ports, pressure sensors, and data loggers. Once the casing with its packers and screens is in place and a bridge plug is installed to seal the casing at its deepest point, the inside of the ACORK string becomes hydrologically isolated from the formation. In this way, access to the hole inside the sealed casing is provided for downhole instruments to the total depth of the installation without perturbing the pressure monitoring.  

Most CORK installations to date have been configured to meet a broad suite of requirements, including passive geophysical monitoring, active hydrologic testing, and formation-fluid chemical and microbiological sampling (see reviews by Kastner et al., 2006; Becker and Davis, 2005; Fisher et al., 2005). Unfortunately, large perturbations can occur when fluids are produced from the formation, particularly when monitoring screens are situated in low-permeability material. Direct effects arise from any pressure drop associated with production, and indirect effects arise from thermal perturbations caused by flow (see discussion in Davis and Becker, 2007). The latter can be caused by the anomalous buoyancy of the water in the umbilical that connects the screens to the seafloor sensors and from transient thermal expansion of the fluid in the umbilical and screens that is confined by the low-permeability material surrounding the screens. To avoid these problems, the observatory at Site U1364 will be devoted to passive geophysical monitoring exclusively; fluid sampling and other formation-interactive experiments devoted to gas hydrates are being planned in separate devoted holes roughly $3\;\mathrm{km}$ to the southeast.  

# Site U1364 ACORK details  

The primary components of the ACORK system deployed in Hole U1364A are shown in Figs. F13–F16. Four screens are centered at 156.3, 203.2, 243.6, and 303.6 mbsf, two above and two below the gas/gas hydrate boundary at $\sim\!230$ mbsf and all within the accretionary prism lithologic unit (Fig. F7). Details of the various components are described as follows:  

# Screens  

Hydrologic access to the formation was provided by $2.03\:\mathrm{m}$ long screen filters on 6.08 m long casing joints (Fig. F13). Carbolite granulate is packed in a $1.55~\mathrm{cm}$ annulus between the outside of a solid section of $10\%$ inch casing and a screen formed of wire wrapped on radial webs. Hydraulic lines leading to deeper intervals pass straight through the filters. The monitoring line accessing each filter is perforated along its length within the corresponding screen. Carbolite, an aluminum oxide ceramic, was used for the filter fill, with a grain size of $400{-}800\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ , a porosity of ${\sim}30\%$ , and a permeability of $5\times10^{-10}\;\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . The screen was wound with triangular 316 stainless steel wire with a surface width of $2.8\;\mathrm{mm}$ and a gap width of $0.4~\mathrm{mm}$ , providing an effective open cross section of $12.5\%$ . The design was intended to provide good hydrologic communication to the formation, with maximum effective contact area and permeability, while preventing sediment from invading and clogging the sampling or monitoring lines.  

# Hydraulic tubing  

Formation pressure signals are transmitted to seafloor sensors via $\%$ inch outer diameter 0.035 inch wall 316 stainless steel hydraulic tubes laid in a flat format and jacketed with polyurethane to form a single, robust umbilical (Fig. F14). Swaged connections were made during deployment between the umbilical and the tubes leading through or from each screen. Unused tubes in each section of umbilical between screens were capped at their bottom ends to prevent hydraulic communication between screens and left open at their tops to prevent collapse and damage to the rest of the umbilical. The umbilical was banded to the outside of the casing sections at roughly $4\textrm{m}$ intervals. The tubing was chosen on the basis of what was felt to be a reasonable compromise between hydraulic capacitance, resistance, and robustness. Capacitance and resistance of the formation (the inverse of the product of these being equivalent to the hydraulic diffusivity) are likely to be high in parts of the sediment section. Hence, to transmit pressure variations over a broad range of frequency with no distortion requires the observation system to have very low resistance and capacitance. The quartz pressure sensors are essentially incompressible, and the compressibility of the thick-walled tubing can also be ignored; the water filling the tubing is the primary source of the observing system compliance. Reducing the internal diameter of the tubing is advantageous in that lesser amounts of water are required to flow in and out of the formation to transmit pressure signals, but only up to the point when the translation of fluid begins to be frictionally influenced by the tube wall. Given expected formation signal amplitudes, the dimension of the tubing chosen is much larger than necessary; the limiting factor was the size that could be handled without fear of clogging with either fine sediment that might invade the screens or grease and constrictions at the tube joints that might occur at the time of deployment. A quantitative discussion of the transmission of signals in context of formation permeability is provided in Davis and Becker (2007).  

# Wellhead configuration  

The ACORK head is a 30 inch diameter cylindrical frame fabricated from $\%$ inch steel around a section of $10\%$ inch casing. It provides space for instruments, wiring, and plumbing in each of three $120^{\circ}$ wide, 78 inch high bays bounded at the top and bottom by circular horizontal bulkheads and divided from one another by radial webs (Fig. F15). All components are contained in a single bay in the Hole U1364A installation, including the sensor/logger/underwater-mateable connector assembly on its demountable frame and three-way pressure sensor valves (Fig. F16). The lowermost bulkhead is positioned $\mathord{\sim}16$ inches above a submersible landing platform that covers the main $4.5\;\mathrm{m}$ diameter reentry cone. The ACORK running tool receptacle fitting at the top of the ACORK head doubles as a $23\%$ inch diameter reentry funnel for bridgeplug and wireline instrument installations. A larger auxiliary reentry funnel was deployed to facilitate reentry into the $10\%$ inch ACORK casing, but it failed to seat and fell to the seafloor after the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was removed (see “Operations summary”).  

Pressure monitoring instrumentation was installed in the wellhead frame on the ship and deployed with the ACORK casing string (Fig. F16). Pressure-balanced underwatermateable hydraulic connectors allow the instrument package to be removed and replaced by submersible or remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the event that repairs or service are ever required. Three-way valves connect the umbilical lines to the instrumentation. In the “interval” position, these connect the formation to the sensors; in the “seafloor” position, the formation lines are closed and the sensors are connected to the ocean, allowing periodic checks on drift. A critical step in the assembly operation of every deployment is to purge air from all lines. In quantities too large to be absorbed by the local volume of water, trapped air will greatly increase the compressibility of the system and thus reduce the fidelity of the response to high-frequency formation pressure variations. Purging is done through lockable check valves at the highest point of the wellhead plumbing by submersing the fully assembled ACORK system below the moonpool immediately prior to deployment. Lines and couplers between the sensors and the three-way valves were purged when the instrument system was mounted to the wellhead frame. Pressure tests were carried out to test against leakage; results of those tests are shown in Figure F17.  

# Sensors and logging electronics  

The logging instrumentation includes individual sensors (Paroscientific 8B4000-2 and 8B4000-1 quartz depth sensors) to monitor pressures at the seafloor and at each of the formation screens (Table T1). Frequency signals from these sensors are digitized with high-resolution ( $\left[\sim\!1\right.$ ppb frequency or 10 ppb full scale pressure $=0.4\ \mathrm{Pa}$ , equivalent to $0.04\ \mathrm{mm}$ of water head) low-power Precision Period Counter (PPC) cards (Bennest Enterprises, Ltd.). The records shown in Figure F17, collected during a plumbing leakage test prior to deployment, give a sense of measurement resolution.  

Absolute accuracy is limited by sensor calibration and drift. Experience from previous multiyear deployments shows that drift is typically ${<}0.4\mathrm{~kPa/y}$ . Drift and calibration inaccuracy $(\sim\!5\times10^{-4}$ of total pressure or roughly $10\;\mathrm{kPa}$ at Site U1364) are dealt with by intergauge hydrostatic checks immediately prior to installation and later at times of submersible visits using the wellhead three-way valves. Bottom water temperature is measured by a temperature-sensitive quartz oscillator of one of the Paroscientific sensors, as well as with a highly stable platinum thermometer. Time-tagged frequency and temperature data are stored by a MT-01 (Minerva Technologies, Ltd.) data logger that utilizes a low-power SanDisk 512 megabyte flash memory card. On-board power is supplied by $12~\mathrm{DD}$ lithium-ion batteries having a total capacity of $210\ \mathrm{A-h}$ , sufficient to power the system for roughly $10\;\mathrm{y}$ at a sampling period of 1 min (user programmable). An onboard voltage detection circuit will automatically switch the system into a high-rate $(1\ \mathrm{Hz})$ sampling mode and idle the batteries when external power from a NEPTUNE connection is made (anticipated within the first year of operation). Serial RS422 communications with the instrument and an external power feed is accommodated via a seven-contact Teledyne ODI underwater-mateable connector (Fig. F16). The instrument pressure case is built of 4130 alloy heat-treated steel, pressure tested for use to a $2800\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth following deep submersible research vessel (DSRV) Alvin certification specifications. The total weight of the instrument assembly is ${\sim}43~\mathrm{kg}$ in water.  

Other downhole instruments planned for future installations will be wireline-deployed inside the $10\%$ inch casing using a submersible or remotely operated vehicle. These will include a thermistor cable, tilt sensors, and a seismometer.  

# Data format and calibration  

The CORK’s MT-01 data logger is configured to make real-time data from the RTC/PPC (real-time clock $^+$ controller/precision period counter) measurement system available via an RS-422 serial interface and concurrently to store all readings in memory. Data transmission rates for real-time access as well as data download are configured to be 115,200 baud. Parameter files documenting the instrument’s configuration can be reviewed at the CORK Observatory Software repository (www.corkobservatories.org/). Software packages mentioned below can also be downloaded.  

An example of the real-time data as it will be received by NEPTUNE Canada once a cable connection is established is provided in Table T2. Binary data records, containing a timestamp, the logger ID, the logger housing temperature, the readings from the pressure sensors, and a trailing zero byte, are written to compact flash memory. These are converted to hexadecimal and sent to the RS-422 interface as lines of ASCII characters.  

Data stored in the logger can be downloaded using a conventional communications terminal program, but for speed and ease of use reasons we highly recommend the use of the “mlterm” software available at the Web site given above. The downloaded \*.raw files contain the complete custom file system of the logging unit, which must be stripped from the data records prior to any further processing. This is done using the “mlbin” software also available from the Web site.  

Given the complex CORK setup, with four Type I (pressure only) and one Type II (pressure and temperature) Paroscientific pressure sensors, the “mldat” software that is usually used to convert raw data to engineering units cannot be used. Python code, which can handle the necessary calibrations of more complex CORK setups, was developed for this purpose (see the CORK Observatory Software repository). To ensure the usability of the data in the future, all necessary information to convert the raw data to engineering units is given below:  

# Timestamp (4 bytes)  

Times are recorded in seconds since 1-Jan-1988 00:00:00.  

# Logger ID (1 byte)  

The ID (08) is the hexadecimal representation of the ID byte; it is associated with the RTC electronics.  

# Internal temperature (logger housing) temperature (3 bytes)  

The logger/RTC/PPC pressure housing temperature is measured using a platinum sensor mounted to one endcap with thermal contact compound. The conversion from readings $(\mathbf{x})$ to housing temperatures $(T_{\mathsf{h}})$ in degrees Celsius is done using  

$$
T_{\mathsf{h}}=\mathsf{a}^{\star}\,\mathbf{x}+\mathsf{b}.
$$  

For the sensor used (serial number 92), the calibration coefficients are $\mathsf{a}=-2.95416\mathrm{e}-$ – $006^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and ${\sf b}=40.1418^{\circ}{\sf C}.$ .  

# Pressure sensor temperature (4 bytes)  

Pressure sensor temperature data are recorded for the seafloor sensor. The sensors for the formation are capable of recording only pressures; this provides enhanced pressure resolution, reduced power consumption, and reduced stored data quantity. The conversion of AD counts $\mathtt{X T F}$ from the pressure sensor temperature channel is done in three steps. First, the counts are converted into the period X (µs) of the temperature oscillator (a conversion that is the same for all PPC measurement devices):  

$\mathrm{X}=(\mathrm{x}_{\mathsf{F T}}+4294967296)$ (4.656612873e–9/4) µs.  

In a second step, the difference U between the measured period X and the period U0 at $0^{\circ}C$ is computed:  

$$
\mathrm{U}=\mathrm{X}-\mathrm{U}_{0}.
$$  

$\mathrm{{U}}_{0}$ is a calibration coefficient that differs for each pressure sensor (Table T3). The differential period U is used to compensate the pressure channel of the same sensor (see below) and to compute the sensor temperature $(\mathrm{T}_{\mathsf{p}})$ using the calibration coefficients $\mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (Table T3):  

$$
\mathrm{T}_{\mathsf{p}}=\mathrm{Y}_{1}\mathsf{U}+\mathrm{Y}_{2}\mathsf{U}^{2}.
$$  

# Formation pressures $\langle\pmb{4}\times\pmb{4}$ bytes)  

Formation pressures measured at screen #1 (deepest) to screen #4 (shallowest) are measured using Type I Paroscientific pressure sensors (no temperature-dependent frequency signal). For the temperature compensation of the pressure signal from these sensors, an external temperature measurement must be supplied. For this purpose, we use the temperature measured by the seafloor pressure sensor, which is collocated with the other pressure sensors and should have a similar thermal time constant. From our experience, the logger pressure housing temperature has a much smaller time constant than the pressure sensors—the quartz oscillators (both pressure and temperature) are by design thermally well isolated within the Paroscientific pressure sensor housings. Therefore, use of the logger housing temperature for temperature compensation would induce high-frequency noise in the calculated pressures. For Type I sensors, the compensation factor U equals the temperature in degrees Celsius we wish to compensate for. Otherwise, the same calibration procedure as for Type II sensors (see below) applies.  

# Seafloor pressure (4 bytes)  

The seafloor pressure sensor is the only Paroscientific Type II sensor (temperature and pressure channel) of the CORK. The temperature compensation factor U for this sensor is the differential period $\mathrm{X}-\mathrm{U}_{0}$ and not the temperature in degrees Celsius as for Type I sensors (see above). If the temperature period for a Type II sensor is not available, U can be computed from an externally provided probe temperature $\mathrm{T_{p}}$ using the following equation (cf. Table T3 for calibration coefficients):  

$$
\mathrm{U}=-[\mathrm{Y}_{1}+\mathrm{sqrt}(\mathrm{Y}_{1}{}^{2}+4\mathrm{~Y}_{2}\mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{p}})]/(2\mathrm{~Y}_{2}).
$$  

Given a temperature compensation factor U, the conversion of logged PPC counts xPF from a sensor pressure channel is done in three steps. First the counts are converted into periods $\uptau$ (µs) of the pressure oscillator, a conversion that is the same for all PPC pressure channels:  

τ = 4.656612873e–9 $\mathrm{(x_{FP}+4294967296)\;\upmu s}.$ .  

Next, a set of three compensation factors (C, D, and $\mathrm{T}_{0}$ ) is computed based on the calibration coefficients $\mathrm{C_{\mathrm{{i}}},\,D_{\mathrm{{i}}}},$ and $\mathrm{{T}_{i},}$ which are provided by Paroscientific Inc. for each pressure sensor (Table T3):  

$$
\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}_{1}+\mathrm{C}_{2}\,\mathrm{U}+\mathrm{C}_{3}\,\mathrm{U}^{2},
$$  

$$
\mathrm{D}=\mathrm{D}_{1},
$$  

and  

$$
\mathrm{T}_{0}=\mathrm{T}_{1}+\mathrm{T}_{2}\;\mathrm{U}+\mathrm{T}_{3}\;\mathrm{U}^{2}+\mathrm{T}_{4}\;\mathrm{U}^{3}.
$$  

Finally, the temperature-compensated pressure $\mathrm{P}$ (in psia) is computed from the factors above:  

$$
\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{C}(1-\mathrm{T}_{0}^{2}/\tau^{2})\,\left[1-\mathrm{D}(1-\mathrm{T}_{0}^{2}/\tau^{2})\right].
$$  

To convert the compensated pressures into dBar or kPa, they must be multiplied by 0.6894757 dBar/psia or $6.894757~\mathrm{kPa}/_{\mathrm{l}}$ psia, respectively.  

# Trailing zero (1 byte)  

As shown in Table T2, each sample record in the binary data is terminated by a zero byte. In the ASCII RS-422 output the records are terminated by carriage-return linefeed characters and thus appear on separate registered lines. The constant number of bytes between the ID byte and the trailing zero byte helps to identify the start and end points of data records, in the event that the structure of the binary data is disrupted (e.g., by incomplete data records).  

# Screen spacing  

At the simplest level, the four monitoring points enumerated above will allow determinations of the average vertical pressure gradient generated by prism thickening and driving vertical fluid flow, along with the contrast in gradient between the section above and below the level of gas hydrate stability associated with a contrast in permeability if one exists. The combination of the $2.03\mathrm{~m~}$ length of the screens and their ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ separation should make such gradient determinations relatively insensitive to localized heterogeneities associated with fractures, turbidite layering, and lenses of massive gas hydrate accumulation.  

Data from below and above the gas/gas-hydrate boundary will also constrain the contrast in mechanical properties of gas- and gas hydrate–bearing sediments and provide independent information about the effective permeabilities of the sections above and below the boundary. The way this can be done is summarized in Figure F18, which begins with a schematic illustration of how variable loading either at the seafloor (e.g., tides and ocean waves) or within the formation (tectonic strain and seismic waves) is transmitted to formation pore water and how local contrasts in loading response causes transient pressure gradients to be established (Fig. F18A). The instantaneous (elastic) response to seafloor loading $=\upgamma$ (referred to as the loading efficiency) (Fig. F18B) depends on porosity, Poisson’s ratio, the compressibility of the solid grain constituents, the compressibility of the sediment or rock framework, and the compressibility of the interstitial fluid or fluid $+\,\mathrm{gas}$ mixture. With the first three of these being well known, absolute values and contrasts in observed loading efficiency can be used to constrain the effects of gas on the elastic properties of the fluid (and hence gas content) and the effect of gas hydrates on the elastic properties of the matrix (and hence average gas hydrate content).  

In simple cases where a sharp mechanical properties contrast is present (e.g., at the seafloor or at the gas/gas hydrate boundary), a transient pressure gradient will be established and interstitial water will flow (Fig. F18A). A damped diffusional wave will propagate away from the boundary, adding a component to the signal (Fig. F18B) that decays with distance (Fig. F18C). At large distances, the response is purely elastic (γ) and constrains such things as the matrix compressibility, the gas content (Fig. F18D), and the coefficient that defines how tectonic deformation loads the interstitial water (Fig. F18E). At intermediate distances, the characteristic diffusion scale length, l (Fig. F18C), depends on the hydraulic diffusivity of the formation, η, and the period of the loading signal, $P,$ as  

$$
l=(\uppi\upeta\left.P\right)^{\ast_{2}}\!.
$$  

The broad bandwidth of ocean wave and tidal loading, for which periods range from seconds to weeks, combined with the distribution of the screens around the gas/gas hydrate boundary, should allow much to be learned about variations in formation elastic and hydrologic properties.  

# Operations summary  

During Leg 146, two attempts were made to establish CORK hydrologic observatories, one at Site 889 and the other in a similar setting at ODP Site 892 off central Oregon (Westbrook, Carson, Musgrave, et al., 1994; Davis et al., 1995). These were equipped with sensors to monitor temperatures at multiple formation levels and pressure at the level of perforations in a liner extending below casing. The installation in Hole 892B was successful and operational for roughly 2 y before the instrumentation was removed to facilitate fluid sampling. Owing to unstable formation conditions and deteriorating weather, the installation in Hole 889C did not succeed. Instability of the formation caused sediment to be squeezed into the casing through the perforations, the open end of the liner, and/or the annulus between the liner and the casing. This prevented the thermistor cable from reaching its intended depth, which in turn precluded a pressure-tight seal of the pressure logging system at the top of the hole. The total hole depth was 385 mbsf; the bottom of the liner was at $323~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . After two aborted attempts to deploy the thermistor cable, a sinker-bar run indicated fill had reached 253 mbsf. The failed third attempt with a cable shortened to $240\,\mathrm{m}$ suggested that sediment had progressively intruded the casing up to this depth. The CORK was never refurbished.  

Expedition 328 began at $0836\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 September 2010 when the first line was passed ashore at Ogden Point Pier A in Victoria, British Columbia (Canada). After completing port call public relations, logistical, and maintenance activities, we departed Victoria for Site U1364 (CAS-01CORK) when the last line was released at $1606\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 September. After maneuvering away from the pier, the vessel began the $145\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to the site at $1700\mathrm{~h~}$ . The ship arrived on location $\!\left(48^{\circ}41.9962^{\prime}\mathrm{N}_{\iota}\right.$ , $126^{\circ}52.3291^{\prime}\mathrm{W})$ ) at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 September, concluding a transit that averaged $11.2\;\mathrm{kt}$ .  

Our first objective was to perform a jet-in test to verify the water depth and establish the conductor casing length to be deployed with the reentry cone, followed by jetting the casing and reentry cone (Fig. F19). The vibration-isolated television (VIT) frame was deployed to observe the bit contacting the seafloor at 1329.0 meters below rig floor (mbrf), and the jet-in test was completed to 55 mbsf. Based on this result, the conductor casing was assembled consisting of three joints of 16 inch casing and a casing shoe joint for a total length of $53\mathrm{~m}$ , which was latched into a standard reentry cone. Once the drilling BHA equipped with a $11\%$ inch advanced piston corer (APC)/ extended core barrel (XCB) bit was latched into the casing hanger, the reentry cone was deployed, and the jetting of the reentry cone and casing was initiated at $0600\;\mathrm{h}$ on 12 September while being monitored via the VIT. The $53\;\mathrm{m}$ assembly was jetted in and landed by $1435\;\mathrm{h}$ , and the drill string was tripped back to the rig floor.  

The next operation was to drill a $14\%$ inch hole to accommodate the $10\%$ inch casing string (Fig. F19). A drilling BHA with a $14\%$ drilling bit was made up and deployed, reentering Hole U1364A at $0905\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September. The VIT was recovered, and drilling advanced without incident to a final depth of $336.0~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . Penetration rate and weight on bit were fairly constant throughout the history of drilling below the $\mathord{\sim}100$ m thick unit of slope basin sediments, although a drop in weight on bit and a significant increase in penetration rate were observed over a $\sim\!20\,\mathrm{m}$ interval below the limit of gas hydrate stability (Fig. F20). High-viscosity mud sweeps (20 bbl each) were circulated at 164, 193, 222, 278, 307, and 336.0 mbsf. A large high-viscosity 50 bbl flush was pumped at the conclusion of drilling. The hole was then displaced with $250\;\mathrm{bbl}$ of $10.5\,\mathrm{ppg}$ barite-loaded mud. The drill string was recovered with the bit clearing the rotary table at $1435\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September.  

The next step was to make up the ACORK assembly. The construction of the ACORK, which includes making connections to the hardware, strapping and taping the umbilical to the casing, and making the plumbing connections to the screens and ACORK, began at $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September and continued to $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September.  

The ACORK assembly included a custom ACORK head, a $10\%$ inch casing hanger, 20 joints of $10\%$ inch casing, two pup joints of $10\%$ inch casing, a TAM Freecap 10 inch $\times\,14$ inch dual-element swellable packer, and four screen joints of $10\%$ inch casing and one shoe joint. The length of the entire assembly was $329.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . Because $6.0\;\mathrm{m}$ of ACORK head extended above the hang-off point in the reentry cone, the effective depth of the assembly into the hole was $323.1\;\mathrm{m}$ . This left a $12.9\;\mathrm{m}$ rat hole between the bottom of the casing shoe and the bottom of the hole at 336.0 mbsf. The next phase of rigging up was to make up a reaming BHA, which included a $9\%$ inch tricone bit, a 9.5 inch HOC DTU950 underreamer, a 9.5 inch Ultra XL mud motor, and the cam-actuated drill-ahead (CADA) casing running tool. The total length of this BHA was $418.9\;\mathrm{m}$ . As the BHA was being assembled, it was lowered incrementally into the ACORK suspended in the moonpool until the CADA running tool landed into the ACORK at $1345\mathrm{~h~}$ on 15 September. The ACORK and reaming assembly were then lowered into the water with the ACORK head ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ beneath the surface for 5 min to purge any entrapped air. The four purge valves were then manually turned to the closed position, the ACORK and reaming BHA were deployed, and Hole U1364A was entered for the second time at $1930~\mathrm{h}$ . The ACORK was gradually lowered into the open hole until it was successfully landed in the reentry cone at $0025\mathrm{~h~}$ on 16 September. The hole appeared to have remained open, possibly because of the presence of the $10.5\;\mathrm{ppg}$ mud that was pumped into the hole at the conclusion of the drilling process, so no circulation or underreaming was required. It is anticipated that the barite (specific gravity $=4.2$ ; average grain size $\sim44~\upmu\mathrm{m})$ ) contained in the mud probably settled out to fill the lower few tens of meters of the hole and annulus around the lower screen within days. The mud remaining in the remainder of the annulus would have had a density little different than seawater, and thus not impede hole collapse.  

The ROV platform was tethered to the VIT frame and deployed at $0400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September. The platform was successfully deployed when the mechanical release activated upon contacting the CADA top hat at $0515\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . The VIT frame was then recovered.  

A Hammer Drilling System (HDS) cone, adapted to fit over the 16 inch casing hanger at the top of the ACORK to facilitate reentry, was made up and free-fall deployed at $0820~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September. However, the cone was dislodged while retrieving the drill string and fell to the seafloor. The drilling string was tripped back to the rig floor.  

The final operation was the deployment of a hydraulic packer to seal the bottom of the $10\%$ inch casing. The packer assembly was deployed, and Hole U1364A was reentered for the third time at $2320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September. Although the $23\%$ inch diameter throat of the ACORK presented a smaller target than the HDS cone, the reentry was made in ${<}1\mathrm{~h~}$ . The packer was positioned at 319 mbsf or $4~\mathrm{m}$ above the casing shoe with a circulating head in place. Prior to activating the packer, the inside of the casing was displaced with one volume of seawater while maintaining pressure below 200 psi to ensure that the packer would not inflate prematurely. At $0230~\mathrm{h}$ , the activating steel ball was dropped into the pipe and seated inside the bridge plug. The pressure was gradually increased until the packer set at ${\sim}1300{-}1400$ psi. The packer was released at $0335\,\mathrm{h}$ when $\mathord{\sim}2700$ psi was applied. The driller pulled back in the hole, circulated seawater while waiting for the cement to be mixed, and then pumped ${\sim}4$ bbl of 16 ppg cement, covering the packer with ${\sim}14\;\mathrm{m}$ of cement. The inside of the casing was then flushed with three volumes of seawater. At $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ , the driller began to recover the drill string, which was back onboard at $1400\ \mathrm{h},$ , ending operations at Site U1364.  

The ship was secured for transit, the thrusters raised, and the ship departed for port. The JOIDES Resolution arrived at Esquimalt Graving Dock in Victoria at $0804\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September 2010, concluding Expedition 328.

Figure F10. Pressure transients observed at CORKed ODP Hole 1027C revealing strain associated with seismogenic slip at the time of two regional earthquakes in 1996 and 1999 $(\mathrm{Mw}=6.3$ and 4.6, respectively). The sense of strain (expansional in 1996, contractional in 1999) is in each case consistent with that predicted on the basis of the earthquake moment tensors. The CORK observatory in this hole is completed in highly permeable oceanic crust; lateral fluid flow beneath the extensive low permeability sediment cover causes eventual drainage of the anomalous pressure. Transients associated with these events were observed at the other CORKed boreholes in the area as well (Davis et al., 2001; Kastner et al., 2006).

Figure F17. A. Results from plumbing leak test done prior to deployment of the Site U1364 ACORK instrument for lines leading from the umbilical line connections through the wellhead valves to the pressure sensors (see Fig. F16). Declines in pressure were the consequence of a slow $({\sim}0.1\ \upmu\mathrm{L/h)}$ leak in the test supply system. Effects of ship’s heave on the ship’s water supply are seen prior to closing the supply valve. Response to the quasi-stepwise pressure change at the beginning and end of each test (sole transitional points shown in expanded view in B) demonstrates system frequency response to better than 1 Hz. B. Expanded view of A.

Schematic illustration showing response of fluids at pore and formation scales. B. Response to loading can be broken into elastic (instantaneous) and diffusive components. C. Transients propagate away from a boundary between regions of contrasting elastic properties as a damped diffusive wave with a characteristic scale that depends on permeability.

Figure F18 (continued). D. Elastic response expressed as loading efficiency (γ in B) depends on the compressibility of the sediment framework and the compressibility of the interstitial water that may contain free gas. E. Response of pressure to volumetric strain in sediment depends primarily on porosity because the compressibility of the matrix is greater than that of water (dotted lines $=$ grain and water compressibilities).
