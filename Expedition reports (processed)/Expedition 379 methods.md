# Introduction  

This introduction provides an overview of operations, depth conventions, core handling, curatorial procedures, and analyses performed on board the R/V JOIDES Resolution during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 379. The information applies to shipboard work described in the Expedition Reports section of the Expedition 379 Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of Expedition 379 data will be described in separate individual postcruise research publications.  

# Site locations  

GPS coordinates (WGS84 datum) from precruise site surveys were used to position the vessel at Expedition 379 sites. A SyQwest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloor depth on the approach to each site to confirm the seafloor depth once on site. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters were lowered and a seafloor positioning beacon was prepared for deployment in case it was needed. Dynamic positioning control of the vessel primarily used navigational input from the GPS (Figure F1); we did not deploy seafloor beacons during this expedition. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over a significant portion of the time during which the hole was occupied.  

Figure F1. IODP convention for naming sites, holes, cores, sections, and samples, Expedition 379. Ship positioning while coring was primarily accomplished with only GPS data; seafloor beacons were only prepared and ready for deployment if needed.

# Drilling operations  

The advanced piston corer (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), extended core barrel (XCB), and rotary core barrel (RCB) system s were available during Expedition 379 (Figures F2, F3, F4). Thes e tools and other drilling technology are documented in Graber et al. (2002).  

The APC and HLAPC systems cut soft-sediment cores wit h minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems. After the APC/HLAPC core barrel is lowered through the drill pip e and lands above the bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until the tw o shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation and cuts the cor e (Figure F2). The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke, ” by observing the pressure gauge on the rig floor because the exces s pressure accumulated prior to the stroke drops rapidly.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in one of two ways: (1) th e piston fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from th e pump pressure and recovery reading) because the formation is to o hard or (2) excessive force $\left(>60,\!000\;\mathrm{lb}\right)$ ) is required to pull the cor e barrel out of the formation. For APC cores that do not achieve a ful l stroke, the next core can be taken after advancing to a depth determined by the recovery of the previous core (advance by recovery) o r to the depth of a full APC core (typically $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ ). When a full strok e could not be achieved, one or more additional attempts were typically made, and each time the bit was advanced by the length of th e core recovered (note that for these cores, this results in a nominal recovery of ${\sim}100\%$ ). When a full or partial stroke is achieved but excessive force is not able to retrieve the barrel, the core barrel can b e “drilled over,” meaning that after the inner core barrel was successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit was advanced to total depth to free the APC barrel.  

![](images/3df7588c2f2c0b4e883bbe74beb3ed9a7ef03586b9b8fe28c4605d886a534f47.jpg)  
Figure F2. APC system used during Expedition 379 (Graber et al., 2002). Th e HLAPC system has the same design but is $4.7\;\mathrm{m}$ long.  

The standard APC system uses a $9.5\:\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, wherea s the HLAPC system uses a $4.7~\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, the HLAPC was deployed after the standard APC had repeated partial strokes and the core liners were damaged. During use of th e HLAPC system, the same criteria were applied in terms of refusal a s for the APC system. Use of the HLAPC system allowed for significantly greater APC sampling depths to be attained than would hav e otherwise been possible.  

The XCB system is typically used when the APC/HLAPC system has difficulty penetrating the formation and/or damages th e core liner and/or core. The XCB system can also either be used t o initiate holes where the seafloor is not suitable for APC coring or b e interchanged with the APC/HLAPC system when dictated b y changing formation conditions. The XCB system was used to advance the hole when HLAPC refusal occurred before the targe t depth was reached or when drilling conditions required it. The XC B is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe that extends below th e large rotary APC/XCB bit (Figure F3). The smaller bit can cut  a semi-indurated core with less torque and fluid circulation than th e main bit, potentially improving recovery. The XCB cutting sho e typically extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediments, but a spring allows it to retract into the main bit when hard formations are encountered. Shorter XCB cutting shoes can also be used.

Figure F4. RCB system used during Expedition 379 (Graber et al., 2002).  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) used for APC and XCB coring is typically composed of an $11\%$ inch $({\sim}29.05\;\mathrm{cm})$ drill bit, a bi t sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub,  a modified head sub, $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapere d drill collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch transition drill pipe, and a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extends to the surface. A differen t APC/XCB bit, a $9\%$ inch APC/XCB polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit, was used at Site U1533 so that it could pass throug h $10\%$ inch casing.  

The RCB system is a rotary system designed to recover firm t o hard sediments and basement rocks. The BHA, including the bi t and outer core barrel, is rotated with the drill string while bearing s allow the inner core barrel to remain stationary (Figure F4).  

A typical RCB BHA includes a $9\%$ inch drill bit, a bit sub, a n outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, a variable number of $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered dril l collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe, and a crossover sub to th e drill pipe that extends to the surface.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all APC, HLAPC, an d RCB coring. APC cores were oriented with the Icefield MI-5 cor e orientation tool when coring conditions allowed. Formation temperature measurements were taken with the advanced piston core r temperature tool (APCT-3; see Downhole formation temperatur e measurements). Information on recovered cores, drilled intervals, downhole tool deployments, and related information are provide d in the Operations, Paleomagnetism, and Physical properties sections of each site chapter.  

# IODP depth conventions  

The primary depth scales used during Expedition 379 are base d on the length of the drill string deployed (e.g., drilling depth belo w rig floor [DRF] and drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]) or th e length of core recovered (e.g., core depth below seafloor [CSF]) (se e IODP Depth Scales Terminology at http://www.iodp.org/top-resources/program-documents/policies-and-guidelines). All unit s are in meters. The relationship between scales is defined either b y protocol, such as the rules for computation of CSF from DSF, or b y user-defined correlations, such as core-to-core or core-to-log correlation. The distinction in nomenclature should keep the reade r aware that a nominal depth value in different depth scales usuall y does not refer to the exact same stratigraphic interval.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF scale). The depth of the cored interval is referenced to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth of the hole fro m the DRF depth of the interval. Standard depths of cores in meter s below the seafloor (CSF, Method A [CSF-A] scale) are determine d based on the assumption that the top depth of a recovered core corresponds to the top depth of its cored interval (at the DSF scale). Standard depths of samples and associated measurements (CSF- A scale) are calculated by adding the offset of the sample or measurement from the top of its section and the lengths of all higher sections in the core to the top depth of the core.  

If a core has ${<}100\%$ recovery, for curation purposes all core d material is assumed to originate from the top of the cored interval as a continuous section. In addition, voids in the core are closed b y pushing core segments together, if possible, during core handling. I f the core pieces cannot be pushed together to get rid of the voids, then foam spacers are inserted and clearly labeled “void.” Therefore, the true depth interval within the cored interval is only partiall y constrained. This should be considered a sampling uncertainty i n age-depth analysis or correlation of core data with downhole logging data.  

When core recovery is ${>}100\%$ (i.e., the length of the recovere d core exceeds that of the cored interval), the CSF-A depth of a sample or measurement taken from the bottom of a core will be deepe r than that of a sample or measurement taken from the top of the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated with the two core interval s overlap at the CSF-A scale). This can happen when a soft to semisoft sediment core recovered from a few hundred meters below th e seafloor expands upon recovery (typically by a few percent to a s much as $15\%$ ). Therefore, a stratigraphic interval may not have th e same nominal depth at the DSF and CSF scales in the same hole.  

During Expedition 379, all core depths below seafloor were initially calculated according to the CSF-A depth scale. Unless otherwise noted, all depths presented are core depths below seafloo r calculated as CSF-A and are reported as $^{\ast}\mathbf{m}$ .”  

# Curatorial procedures and sample depth calculations  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples followed standar d IODP procedures (Figure F1). A full curatorial identifier for a sample consists of the following information: expedition, site, hole, cor e number, core type, section number, section half, piece numbe r (hard rocks only), and interval in centimeters measured from th e

top of the core section. For example, a sample identification of $^{\prime}379.$ - U1532A-2H-5W, $80{-}85\;\mathrm{cm},^{\prime}$ ” indicates a $5\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ sample removed fro m the interval between 80 and $85\ \mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section  5 (working half) of Core 2 ( $^{\ast}\mathrm{H}^{\prime\prime}$ designates that this core was take n with the APC system) of Hole A at Site U1532 during Expeditio n 379 (Figure F1). The “U” preceding the hole number indicates th e hole was drilled by the US IODP platform, JOIDES Resolution. Th e drilling system used to obtain a core is designated in the sampl e identifiers as follows: $\mathrm{H}\,=\,\mathrm{APC}$ , $\mathrm{\DeltaF}\,=\,\mathrm{HLAPC}$ , ${\mathrm{~R~}}={\mathrm{~RCB~}}$ , and $\mathrm{~X~}=$ XCB. Integers are used to denote the “core” type of drilled interval s (e.g., a drilled interval between Cores 2H and 4H would be denote d by Core 31).  

# Core handling and analysis  

The overall flow of cores, sections, analyses, and sampling implemented during Expedition 379 is shown in Figure F5.  

When the core barrel reached the rig floor, the core catche r from the bottom of the core was removed and taken to the corereceiving platform (“catwalk”), and a sample was extracted for paleontological (PAL) analysis. Next, the sediment core was extracte d from the core barrel in its plastic liner. The liner was carried fro m the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwalk outside th e core laboratory, where it was split into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ sections. Blue (uphole direction) and clear (downhole direction) liner caps were glue d with acetone onto the cut liner sections. Laboratory gloves wer e worn by all core handlers.  

Once the core was cut into sections, whole-round samples wer e taken for interstitial water (IW) chemical analyses. When a wholeround sample was removed, a yellow cap was used to indicate  a whole-round sample had been taken. Syringe samples were take n for gas analyses according to the IODP hydrocarbon safety monitoring protocol. Syringe and whole-round samples were taken for microbiology  contamination  testing  and  postcruise  analyses. Toothpick samples for smear slides were taken from some of th e section ends for additional paleontological analysis.  

The core sections were placed in a core rack in the laboratory . After the core information was entered into the database and th e sections were labeled, X-ray imaging of all core sections was conducted. When the core sections reached equilibrium with laboratory temperature (typically after $4\mathrm{~h~}$ ), they were run through th e Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) for $P$ -wave velocit y $P$ -wave logger [PWL]), magnetic susceptibility (MS), and gamm a ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density (see Physical properties). Th e core sections were also run through the Natural Gamma Radiatio n Logger (NGRL), and thermal conductivity measurements wer e taken once per core when the material was suitable.  

Core sections were then split lengthwise from bottom to to p into working and archive halves. Investigators should note tha t older material can be transported upward on the split face of eac h section during splitting. Sediment sections or intervals too indurated to be cut with wire, including hard rock clasts and concretions, were split with a diamond saw.  

Discrete samples were then taken for moisture and density (MAD) and paleomagnetic (PMAG) analyses and for remaining shipboard analyses such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) and carbonate (CARB) from the working-half sections. Samples were not collected when the lithology was a high-priority interval for expedition or postcruise research, the core material was unsuitable, or the core was severely deformed. During the expedition, the only samples taken for personal postcruise research were those concerning ephemeral properties (e.g., IW, organic geochemistry, and microbiology) or for analyses required to plan for sensible postcruise sampling. Following shipboard sampling, oriented $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements were performed using the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG).  

The archive half of each core was scanned on the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) to provide line-scan images and then measured for point magnetic susceptibility (MSP) and reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). Labeled foam pieces were used to denote missing wholeround intervals in the SHIL images. The archive-half sections were then described visually and by means of smear slides for sedimentology. Occasionally, additional toothpick samples were extracted from key intervals for micropaleontologic smear slides from either the working or archive halves. Finally, the magnetization of archivehalf sections and working-half discrete pieces was measured with the cryogenic magnetometer and spinner magnetometer. Certain critical intervals were approved for shipboard sampling for clast, geochemical, or paleontologic analysis from the working half.  

When all steps were completed, cores were wrapped, sealed in plastic tubes, and transferred to cold storage space aboard the ship. At the end of the expedition, the cores were sent to the IODP Gulf Coast Repository (GCR; Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA). After the cores arrived at the GCR, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) data were collected at the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator XRF facility. These data are included as part of the initial datasets along with other shipboard data. Later, samples for individual scientists' postcruise research were taken.  

Gas that is in solution at depth may become free and drive apart core segments in the liner. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the liner, which forces some sediment as well as gas out of the liner. These disturbances are described in each site chapter and graphically indicated on the visual core descriptions (VCDs).  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Sediments and rocks recovered during Expedition 379 were described macroscopically from archive-half sections and microscopically from smear slides and thin sections. Observations were recorded in separate macroscopic and microscopic DESClogik templates  (version  x.16.1.0.19;  see  the  DESClogik  user  guide  at http://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation). While the cores were equilibrating to room temperature prior to whole-core WRMSL and NGRL scanning, each whole-core section was X-rayed. These methods along with color spectrophotometry and MSP data are described in detail in Physical properties. Percent carbonate and percent organic matter (carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur analyzer [CHNS]) measurements on shipboard sediment and sedimentary rock samples are described in Geochemistry and microbiology.  

# Core preparation  

The technique used for splitting cores into working and archive halves (using either a piano wire or a saw and splitting from the bottom to the top; see Lithostratigraphy in the Site U1532 chapter and Lithostratigraphy in the Site U1533 chapter [Wellner et al., 2021a, 2021b] for the depth at which the change was made in each core) affects the appearance of the split-core surface. Prior to core description and high-resolution digital color imaging, the quality of the split-core surface of the archive half of each core was assessed, and the split-core surface was scraped lightly with a glass microscope slide or stainless steel plate to even the surface when necessary (e.g., the surface was irregular or smeared).  

# Drilling and handling core disturbance  

Occasionally, cores may be significantly disturbed and contain extraneous material as a result of the coring and core handling process (Jutzeler et al., 2014). For example, in formations with loose sand layers, sand from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down by drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom of the hole, and be sampled with the next core. The uppermost $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ of each core must therefore be critically examined during description for potential “fall-in.” Common coring-induced deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Piston action can result in fluidization (“flow-in”) at the bottom of APC cores. Extending APC or HLAPC coring into deeper, firmer formation can also induce significant core deformation. The rotation of the drilling and coring hardware (drill string, bit, core barrel) during XCB and RCB coring can transfer rotary torque to the core, causing core pieces to rotate relative to each other as they enter the core barrel. The resulting deformation is called “biscuiting.” The seawater circulated during XCB and RCB coring combined with the rotational biscuiting of core pieces can also introduce fluids into the core and/or cause fluidization and remobilization of poorly consolidated/cemented sediments. This often creates short intervals of coherent core pieces that alternate with intervals of a completely fluidized sediment-fluid mix (slurry). Retrieval from depth to the surface can result in elastic rebound.  

# Section-half images  

After cleaning the core surface, the archive half was imaged with the SHIL as soon as possible to avoid sediment color changes caused by oxidation and drying. In cases of watery or soupy sediment, the surface was dried sufficiently to avoid light reflection prior to scanning. The SHIL uses three pairs of Advanced Illumination high-current focused LED line lights to illuminate the features of the core. Each of the LED pairs has a color temperature of $6{,}500\,\mathrm{K}$ and emits 200,000 lux at 3 inches. Digital images were taken by a JAI line-scan camera at an interval of 10 lines/mm to create a high-resolution TIFF file. The camera height was set so that each pixel imaged a $0.1\,\;\mathrm{mm^{2}}$ section of the core surface; however, actual core width per pixel can vary because of slight differences in the sectionhalf surface height. A high-resolution JPEG with grayscale and depth ruler and a low-resolution cropped JPEG showing only the core section surface were created from the high-resolution TIFF files.  

# Visual core description  

Macroscopic descriptions of each section (nominally $0{-}150~\mathrm{cm}$ long) were recorded on handwritten VCD forms generated from the SHIL (Figure F6). All handwritten sheets were digitally preserved as PDF files (see LITH in Supplementary material). Standard sedimentological observations of lithology, boundaries, primary and secondary (i.e., syn- and postsedimentary deformation) sedimentary structures (including bioturbation intensity), drilling disturbance, pebble abundance (number of grains with a long axis $>\!4\;\mathrm{mm}$ per $10~\mathrm{{cm}}$ core interval), and shipboard sample types and depth s were recorded in individual columns. Shape and petrology characteristics of coarse pebbles $(>\!2\ \mathsf{c m})$ and macroscopic biogenic remains (i.e., shell fragments, shells, etc.) were recorded as comments. Color was also recorded for each interval, aided by Munsell soi l color charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2010).  

![](images/2c9bba737e80aa7b0e65da403669f473ad226ebb809dbd5636e3b5e3bbd7165a.jpg)  

# DESClogik data capture software  

Data from the handwritten core description sheets were compiled and entered into the IODP Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) database using the DESClogik software.  A macroscopic spreadsheet template with the following five tabs wa s constructed and customized for Expedition 379:  

• Drilling disturbance (type and intensity), • General (major lithology, degree of consolidation, color, bioturbation intensity, diagenetic constituents/composition, macroscopic biogenic material, etc.),  

• Sedimentary structures,   
• Clasts (number of pebbles $>\!4\;\mathrm{mm}$ counted at $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals and characteristics of coarse pebbles $>\!2\,\mathsf{c m}$ ), and   
• Core summary (written description of major lithologic findings by core).  

A microscopic template with two tabs to capture texture and relative abundance of biogenic/mineralogic components was configured and used to record smear slide and thin section data, respectively. Data entered into DESClogik were then uploaded t o the LIMS database and used to produce VCD standard graphical reports.  

# Standard graphical report  

A one-page VCD of each core was generated using the Strate r software package (Golden Software) (Figure F7). Hole, core, and interval are included at the top of each VCD, along with a summar y core description. VCDs display the core depth below seafloor (CSFA; in meters), core length (in centimeters), sections, location o f shipboard samples, and the SHIL digital color image to the left o f the graphic lithology column. Columns to the right of graphic lithology include type and intensity of drilling disturbance, bioturbation intensity, biogenic material (Holes U1532A and U1532B only), diagenetic constituents (Holes U1532C–U1532G and U1533A– U1533D), sedimentary structures, type of lower boundary, pebbl e abundance (when appropriate for a given site), and physical property data (magnetic susceptibility and GRA bulk density collecte d by the WRMSL and NGR) (see Physical properties) (Figure F7) . Graphic lithologies, sedimentary structures, and other visual observations shown on the VCDs by graphic patterns and symbols are explained in Figure F8.  

# Lithologic classification scheme  

Lithologic descriptions were based on the classification scheme s used during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 178 (Shipboar d Scientific Party, 1999), the Cape Roberts Project (CRP; Hambrey e t al., 1997), the Antarctic Drilling Project (ANDRILL; Naish et al., 2006), Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 318 (Expedition 318 Scientists, 2011) and 341 (Jaeger et al., 2014), and IOD P Expedition 374 (McKay et al., 2019).  

# Principal names and modifiers  

The principal lithologic name was assigned based on the relativ e abundances of siliciclastic and biogenic grains (Figure F9). Th e principal name is purely descriptive and does not include interpretive classifications relating to fragmentation, transport, deposition, or alteration processes. Only the principal name for a nonconsolidated lithology was entered in DESClogik, and an entry in an additional column clarifies whether the sediment is consolidated o r unconsolidated.  

The principal name of a sediment/rock with ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ siliciclasti c grains is based on an estimate of the grain sizes present (Figur e F9A). The Wentworth (1922) scale was used to define size classes o f clay, silt, sand, and gravel. If no gravel was present, the principal sediment/rock name was determined based on the relative abundances of sand, silt, and clay (e.g., silt, sandy silt, silty sand, etc.; Naish et al., 2006, after Shepard, 1954, and Mazzullo et al., 1988 ) (Figure F9B). For example, if any one of these components exceed s $80\%$ , then the lithology is defined by the primary grain size clas s (e.g., sand). The term “mud” is used to define sediments containin g a mixture of silt and clay (these are difficult to separate using visual  

Figure F7. Example VCD summarizing data from core imaging, macroscopic description, and physical property measurements, Expedition 379. A biogeni c material column was used for VCDs of cores from Holes U1532A and U1532B but was replaced with a diagenetic constituents column for VCDs of cores fro m Holes U1532C–U1532G and U1533A–U1533D.  

![](images/fb0d8591c213986aa2c245abc966873ed57ea05f33c24393d009e0d739a1cf93.jpg)  

macroscopic inspection) in which neither component exceeds $80\%$ . Sandy mud to muddy sand describes sediment composed of a mixture of at least $20\%$ each of sand, silt, and clay (Figure F9B). For sediment consisting of two grain size fractions that each exceed $20\%$ (e.g., clay and silt or sand and mud), the prefix was determined b y the fraction with the lower percentage (Figure F9B).  

If the sediment/rock contains siliciclastic gravel, then the principal name was determined from the relative abundance of grave l $\left(>2\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ and the sand/mud ratio of the clastic matrix, following th e textural classifications of Moncrieff (1989) (Figure F10), and grave l percent was estimated using the comparison chart of Terry an d  

Chilingar (1955). The term “diamict” is used as a nongenetic ter m for unsorted to poorly sorted terrigenous sediment that contains  a wide range of particle sizes. Accordingly, a clast-poor muddy diamict includes $1\%{-}5\%$ gravel $(>2\mathrm{\mm})$ and $25\%{-}50\%$ sand in matrix, whereas a clast-rich muddy diamict includes $5\%{-}30\%$ gravel an d $25\%{-}50\%$ sand in matrix. A clast-poor sandy diamict has $1\%{-5\%}$ gravel and $50\%-75\%$ sand in matrix. For a clast-rich sandy diamict, gravel content is $5\%{-}30\%$ , sand content is $50\%{-}75\%$ , and the remainder is mud. The terms “gravel,” “conglomerate,” and “breccia ” are used when the matrix includes ${>}30\%$ gravel. “Conglomerate” describes a sediment with dominantly rounded to well-rounded gravel grains, and “breccia” describes a sediment with dominantly angular to very-angular gravel grains (Figure F10).  

![](images/58f884bb7c24ed8f791a36665c46a2b3aa9558f2a695f3b0b4e6affaf2f0378a.jpg)  
Figure F8. Symbols used for VCDs, Expedition 379.  

The principal name of sediment with ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ biogenic grains is “ooze” modified by the most abundant specific biogenic grain type (Figure F11A). For example, if diatoms exceed $50\%$ , then the sediment is called “diatom ooze.” However, if the sediment is composed of $40\%$ diatoms and $15\%$ sponge spicules, then the sediment is termed “biosiliceous ooze.” The same principle applies to calcareous microfossils. For example, if foraminifers exceed $50\%$ , then the sediment is called “foraminifer ooze,” whereas a mixture of $40\%$ foraminifers and $15\%$ calcareous nannofossils is termed “calcareous ooze.” The lithologic name “chert” is used to describe biosiliceous rocks recovered from below the opal-CT transition, where the main biogenic component is not identifiable. The lithologic name “carbonate” is used for consolidated and nonconsolidated sediments consisting predominantly of calcareous material that do not allow identification of calcareous microfossils. Voids within a core section were captured under Principal lithology.  

For all lithologies, major and minor modifiers were applied to the principal sediment/rock names with the following modified scheme from Expedition 318 (Expedition 318 Scientists, 2011) (Figure F11A):  

• Major biogenic modifiers are those components that comprise $25\%{-}50\%$ of the grains and are indicated by the suffix “-rich” (e.g., diatom-rich).   
• Minor biogenic modifiers are those components with abundances of $10\%{-}25\%$ and are indicated by the suffix “-bearing” (e.g., diatom-bearing).   
• Siliciclastic modifiers in biogenic oozes are those components with abundances of $10\%{-}50\%$ and are indicated by the suffix “-y” (e.g., silty, muddy, or sandy).  

Modifiers for sediments containing mixtures of siliciclastic components and volcanic grains were determined according to Figure F11B.

For intervals in which two lithologies are interbedded or interlaminated (individual beds or laminated intervals are $_{<15\mathrm{~cm}}$ thic k and alternate between one lithology and another), the term “interbedded” or “interlaminated” is recorded in the General tab unde r Comments in the macroscopic DESClogik template and noted as  a sedimentary structure in the Sedimentary structures tab. This terminology is for ease of data entry and graphic log display purpose s for VCDs (Figures F7, F8). When beds are distributed throughout  a different lithology (e.g., centimeter- to decimeter-thick sand bed s within a mud bed), they are logged individually and the associate d bed thickness and grain size ranges are described.  

# Lithostratigraphic units  

At each site, units were assigned to highlight major lithologi c changes downhole. Lithostratigraphic units were established base d on prominent changes in principal lithology, sedimentary structures, biogenic components, or pebble counts. Units are numbere d from the top of the stratigraphic succession using Roman numerals. When more subtle significant changes were observed, units wer e divided into subunits. Subunits are distinguished from the mai n lithostratigraphic units by adding a letter to the unit number (e.g., IA would indicate Subunit A of Unit I).  

# Sedimentary structures  

The locations and types of sedimentary structures visible on th e prepared surfaces of the archive halves were entered in the Sedimentary structures tab in the macroscopic DESClogik template. Basal boundaries between different lithologies are classified a s sharp, gradational, inclined, contorted, undulating/wavy, or chaotic. The following bedding and lamination definitions are from Mazzullo et al. (1988):  

• Thinly laminated $\leq\!3\,\mathrm{mm}$ thick), • Laminated $3\;\mathrm{mm}$ to $1\,\mathrm{cm}$ ), • Very thinly bedded $(1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm})$ , • Thinly bedded $(3{-}10\,\mathrm{cm})$ , • Medium bedded $(10{-}30\,\mathrm{cm})$ ), • Thickly bedded $(30{-}100\;\mathrm{cm})$ , and • Very thickly bedded $^{\leftmoon}{>}100\,\mathsf{c m}\right)$ ).  

The presence of graded beds was also noted. “Normal grading ” corresponds to layers with an upward decrease in grain size,

whereas “reverse grading” corresponds to layers with an upward increase in grain size.  

Deformation of the core identified as unrelated to drilling wa s also recorded in the Sedimentary structures tab of the macroscopi c DESClogik template and the VCDs (Figures F7, F8), including bot h synsedimentary structures and postdepositional deformation features (e.g., microfaults). When it was possible to determine apparent motion sense for faults with certainty, direction of displacemen t (i.e., reverse or normal) was recorded; otherwise “fault (general) ” was noted. Interval thickness was recorded from the uppermost t o the lowermost extent of the described feature. It is also recorded i n the comments column of the core description sheet.  

Where sediments are diagenetically altered (e.g., mottling o r staining or the presence of pyrite, concretions, or cement), the diagenetic constituent was entered in the Diagenetic constituent composition column of the General tab in the macroscopic DESClogi k template. We define mottles (millimeter to centimeter scale) a s spots or smears where material has a different color than the surrounding sediment.  

# Bioturbation  

Ichnofabric description included the extent of bioturbation an d notation of distinctive biogenic structures. To assess the degree o f bioturbation semiquantitatively, the Droser and Bottjer (1986) ichnofabric index (0–4) modified by Savrda et al. (2001) was used (Figure F12):  

• $0=\mathtt{n o}$ apparent bioturbation $(\le\!10\%)$ .   
• $1=$ slight bioturbation $(>\!10\%-30\%)$ .   
• $2=$ moderate bioturbation $(>\!30\%{-}60\%)$ .   
• $3=$ heavy bioturbation $(>\!60\%{-90\%})$ .   
• $4=$ complete bioturbation $(>\!90\%)$ ).  

We note that massive muds may be deposited rapidly in glacia l environments and record no evidence of bioturbation; they were assigned a value of 0. However, mud may also lack sedimentary structures because of complete bioturbation (e.g., 4 on the ichnofabri c index), which may be accompanied by color mottling. This scenari o is more likely for deepwater sites than for shallower continenta l  

Figure F12. Ichnofabric index legend, Expedition 379 (modified from Drose r and Bottjer, 1986, and Savrda et al., 2001).  

![](images/1e144d26934cd1f9ffacd7e2457dc1dfce8036b722b34ac8397e7f9338bf8366.jpg)  
shelf sites. The ichnofabric index was graphed using the numerical scale in the bioturbation column of the VCD. When identifiable, ichnofacies (Ekdale et al., 1984) were noted and logged in the General interval comment column of the General tab of the macroscopic DESClogik template.  

# Macroscopic biogenic components and diagenetic features  

Paleontologic and diagenetic features other than those delineated above were entered in the corresponding columns of the General tab and depicted as symbols in the VCDs (Figures F7, F8) . These features include macroscopic biogenic remains (e.g., shells, sponge spicules, etc.) and concretions. When possible, concretion s were described by composition.  

# Pebble abundance and characteristics  

Coarse gravel abundance was determined by counting the pebbles visible on the surface of the archive half. Where only holes o r depressions caused by lithic or diamict clasts were observed, th e working half was also examined to determine pebble abundance. Pebbles $(4\ \mathrm{mm}{-}6\ \mathrm{cm}$ long axis diameter) were counted in $10~\mathrm{{cm}}$ depth intervals. If between one and nine individual pebbles wer e counted per $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ depth interval, the number of pebbles per interval was entered into DESClogik under the Clasts tab. If 10 or mor e pebbles were present in a $10~\mathrm{cm}$ interval, the number 10 was entered into DESClogik. Details on lithology, size, shape, and rounding of pebbles with a long axis $>\!2\ \mathrm{cm}$ were provided in the cor e description sheets and the Coarse pebbles $(>\!2\ \mathsf{c m})$ comment column under the Clasts tab.  

The coarse components of prominent clast-rich intervals in cor e sections were closely examined to obtain sedimentary provenanc e information. For coarse silt to pebble sized grains, the mineral/roc k types were determined from direct observation of individual grain s using a hand lens and binocular microscope. Grain/pebble type s were identified according to mineral and rock type, and the abundances by type were determined by counting grains for selected representative core intervals. Counts were made from cut faces of th e archive halves and/or washed, sieved material from core catche r sections that were prepared for micropaleontology. In general, th e grain size range of these residues is 0.25 to $2.0\;\mathrm{mm}$ . When available, material from “ghost” cores and material removed (scraped) fro m slightly disturbed surfaces of split cores were used. The mineral/rock type counts were converted to percent and reported in table form and/or ternary plots.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Core disturbance from the drilling process may alter the core s slightly (e.g., bent/bowed bedding contacts) or greatly (e.g., complete disruption of the stratigraphic sequence) (see Jutzeler et al., 2014, for examples). The style of drilling disturbance is describe d using the following terms:  

• Fall-in: out-of-place material at the top of a core has fallen downhole onto the cored surface.   
• Bowed: bedding contacts are slightly to moderately deformed but still subhorizontal and continuous.   
• Flowage: severe soft-sediment stretching and/or compressional shearing attributed to coring/drilling. The particular type of deformation may also be noted (e.g., flow-in).   
• Soupy: intervals that are water saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
• Gas expansion: a part of the core is partitioned into pieces and voids due to expansion of interstitial gas. The particular type of deformation may also be noted (e.g., mousse-like).   
• Biscuited: sediments of intermediate stiffness show vertical variations in the degree of disturbance. Softer intervals are washed and/or soupy, whereas firmer intervals are relatively undisturbed.   
• Fractured: firm sediments are broken but not displaced or significantly rotated (including cracks).   
• Fragmented: firm sediments are broken into pieces and rotated, and their stratigraphic position may not be preserved.   
• Brecciated: firm sediments are pervasively broken into small and angular pieces with original orientation and stratigraphic position lost and are often completely mixed with drilling slurry.   
• Washed gravel: fine material was probably lost during drilling, and only washed coarse material, commonly gravels or pebbles, remains. Washed gravel often results when coring unsorted or poorly sorted, unconsolidated sediments with considerable coarse-grained content (e.g., diamict).   
• None: No obvious drilling disturbance is observed.  

The intensity of drilling disturbance was also described in th e Drilling disturbance tab of DESClogik and displayed graphically o n the VCDs. Intensity of drilling disturbance of unconsolidated an d consolidated sediments was classified into the three categories: slight, moderate, and high.  

In unconsolidated sediments, the three categories imply the following:  

• Slightly disturbed: bedding contacts are slightly bent or bowed in an upward-arching appearance.   
• Moderately disturbed: bedding contacts are bent or bowed in an upward-arching appearance but are still visible.   
• Highly disturbed: bedding is completely deformed and may show diapiric or flow structures.  

In harder sediments (i.e., consolidated by compaction or cementation), the three categories stand for  

• Slightly fractured: core pieces are in place and have very little drilling slurry or brecciation.   
• Moderately fractured or biscuited: core pieces are from the cored interval and are probably in correct stratigraphic sequence (although the entire section may not be represented). Intact core pieces are broken into rotated discs (or “biscuits”) as a result of the drilling process, and drilling mud has possibly flowed in.   
• Highly fractured or brecciated: pieces are from the cored interval but may not occur in correct stratigraphic sequence within the core.  

In addition to drilling-related artifacts, disturbance also occurred during core handling. If a core liner shattered during coring, the pieces were brought onto the catwalk and transferred to a ne w core liner for curation. This process may result in pieces of core tha t are out of stratigraphic order or inverted relative to their original position. These cores should be considered highly disturbed. Additionally, the split-core surface of lithologies with relatively high porosity was occasionally disturbed after core description and imagin g were completed because of excess pressure applied by the MSP instrument.  

# Microscopic descriptions  

# Smear slides  

To aid in lithologic classification, the size, composition, an d abundance of sediment constituents were estimated microscopically using smear slides (Figure F13). Toothpick samples were take n mostly from the primary lithologies at a frequency of at least on e sample per section. For each smear slide, a small amount of sediment was removed from the archive half using a wooden toothpic k and put on a $22\ \mathrm{mm}\times30\ \mathrm{mm}$ coverglass. A drop of deionized wate r was added, and the sediment was homogenized and evenly sprea d across the coverglass. The dispersed sample was dried on a hot plat e at a moderate setting $(150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . A couple of drops of Norland optical adhesive Number 61 was added to a glass microscope slide that wa s then carefully placed on the dried sample to prevent air bubble s from being trapped in the adhesive. The smear slide was then place d in an ultraviolet light box for $15\;\mathrm{min}$ to cure the adhesive.  

Smear slides were examined with a transmitted-light petrographic microscope equipped with a standard eyepiece micrometer. Biogenic and mineral components were identified following standard petrographic techniques as stated in Rothwell (1989) and Marsaglia et al. (2013, 2015). Several fields of view were examined a t $100\times$ , $200\times$ , $400\times$ , and $500\times$ to assess the abundance of detrital, biogenic, and authigenic components. The relative abundance percentages of the sedimentary constituents were visually estimated usin g the techniques of Rothwell (1989). The texture of siliciclastic lithologies (e.g., relative abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains ) and the proportions and presence of biogenic and mineral components were recorded in the smear slide worksheet of the microscopic DESClogik template.  

![](images/b8fa46ff326d26cdeda2f3dcef22332e26990a2a13ecf74ae5199b36786d6576.jpg)  

Components observed in smear slides were categorized as follows:  

• TR $=$ trace $(\le\!1\%)$ .   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(>\!1\%{-}10\%)$ .   
• $C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}25\%)$ ).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!25\%{-}50\%)$ .   
• $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant $(\mathrm{>}50\%)$ .  

Smear slides provide only a rough estimate of the relative abundance of sediment constituents. Occasionally, the lithologic nam e assigned based on smear slide observation does not match the nam e in the macroscopic lithology description because a small sampl e may not represent the macroscopic description of a much large r sediment interval. Additionally, very fine and coarse grains are difficult to observe in smear slides, and their relative proportions in th e sediment can be affected during slide preparation. Therefore, intervals dominated by sand and larger sized constituents were examined by macroscopic comparison to grain size reference charts. Photomicrographs of some smear slides were taken and uploaded t o the LIMS database.  

Sample residues obtained from shipboard paleontologists (PA L samples) were also analyzed. Samples were wet-sieved at 45 and 15 0 $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ (see Biostratigraphy) and dried. Biogenic components (radiolarians and foraminifers) were removed, and the sieve residues wer e systematically analyzed.  

# Thin sections  

Descriptions of both consolidated and unconsolidated sediments were complemented by shipboard thin section analyses. Standard thin section billets $\langle20\ \mathrm{mm}\times15\ \mathrm{mm}\rangle$ ) were cut or sawe d from selected intervals or features as needed from core section intervals that were either undisturbed or slightly disturbed by drilling. Samples were initially sprayed with isopropyl and left to dry for 1 0 min before being placed in Epo Tek 301 epoxy for $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ under vacuum. Samples were then placed in molds before being sanded to obtain a flat, smooth surface that was adhered to a glass slide wit h epoxy. Next, samples were first cut and then ground down to $\mathord{\sim}150$ $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ thickness. Coverslips were placed on thin sections using Immersol immersion oil, and initial analysis including collection of thi n section images and photomicrographs was completed. This proces s was repeated for selected thin sections that were further groun d down to ${\sim}80\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ thickness and to ${\sim}30\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ thickness where possible. The process of photographing and examining the thin section at different thicknesses was essential to preserve sedimentary structure s in unlithified sediments that could be easily destroyed before reaching the desired sample thickness of $30~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ . Particularly for unconsolidated sediments, it was not always possible to get samples $_{<100}$ $\upmu\mathrm{m}$ thick. Thin sections were examined with a transmitted-light petrographic microscope equipped with a standard eyepiece micrometer. Data were entered into the Thin section tab of the DESClogi k microscopic template.  

# Spectrophotometry and colorimetry  

The SHMSL employs multiple sensors to measure bulk physica l properties in a motorized and computer-controlled section-hal f logging instrument. The sensors included in the SHMSL are a spectrophotometer, an MSP sensor, and a laser surface analyzer. Th e resolution used for the SHMSL during Expedition 379 was $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ . Both the MSP sensor and the spectrophotometer require flush contact with the split-core surface, so the archive halves were covere d with clear plastic wrap prior to measurement. A built-in laser surface analyzer aids in the recognition of irregularities in the splitcore surface (e.g., cracks and voids), and data from this tool wer e recorded to provide an independent check on SHMSL measurement fidelity. Magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartington Instruments MS2 meter and a MS2K contact probe. Instrumen t details are given in Physical properties. Reflectance spectroscop y (spectrophotometry) was carried out using an Ocean Optics Q E Pro detector that measures the reflectance spectra of the split cor e from the ultraviolet to near-infrared range. Each measurement wa s recorded in $2\,\mathrm{nm}$ spectral bands from 390 to $732\,\mathrm{nm}$ . The data wer e converted to the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color space system, which expresses color a s a function of lightness $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}.$ ; grayscale) and color values $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ , where $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ reflects the balance between red (positive $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ ) and gree n (negative $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ ) and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ reflects the balance between yellow (positive $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) and blue (negative $\mathfrak{b}^{\ast}$ ).  

# X-ray fluorescence analysis  

An Olympus Vanta M series handheld portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF) was used to measure elemental composition on selected intervals of split-core sections from Site U153 2 and the residual “cakes” resulting from IW measurements for Sit e U1533. Measurements were performed with a $10{-}50\,\mathrm{kV}$ $(10{-}50\,\upmu\mathrm{A})$  

Rh X-ray tube and a high–count rate detector with a count time o f $60\,s$ . The instrument data correction packages solve a series of nonlinear equations for each analyzed element. The “Geochem” mod e was used to examine the relative abundance of major and trace elements. pXRF measurements of standards were performed once pe r day to track instrument drift, but standardization using synthetic o r natural standards (e.g., Lemière, 2018) was not performed. In som e instances, other analyses such as XRD were coordinated with th e pXRF measurements. The pXRF measurements were acquired as a n aid to core description using pXRF measurement methods suitabl e for each interval of interest. Observational criteria such as lithologi c variability, presence of cement, or color banding aided the identification of intervals of interest. At Site U1532, major and trace elements for selected intervals were measured on the archive halve s with the analyst holding the Vanta XRF “gun” vertically with the detector pointed downward (McKay et al., 2019). Two transects wer e conducted to compare compositional variations between adjacen t lithofacies; these entailed single pXRF point measurements systematically spaced at $10~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals. The pXRF analysis served to acquaint shipboard scientists with instrument use, data acquisition, and data quality, a process that led to the development of the pXR F approach used at Site U1533.  

At Site U1533, the Vanta XRF gun was placed securely in a tabl e mount with the measurement beam directed upward into a leadshielded box where homogenized samples of 60 to $100~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ wer e placed. The sample material consisted of the mostly clayey cake residues that remained after the extraction of IW for shipboard geochemical analyses. The measurements were performed at thre e different points on the flat surface of the IW cake, the results wer e averaged, and error was determined to be 1σ.  

Compared to in situ measurements on the archive halves, th e use of high-pressed IW cakes for pXRF analysis presents the following advantages:  

• The effect of light element (LE; elements having atomic mass lighter than sodium [Na]) variability, arising from volatile phases (including $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ ), on major and trace element abundances is minimized.   
• The IW cake material is more texturally homogeneous than stratified sediment that may have a shape-preferred orientation of minerals that affects the pXRF results.   
• Multiple points on the same IW cake can be collected quickly by slight repositioning of the samples within the stationary measurement chamber.   
• The pXRF gun maintains an extremely stable position in its mount throughout data acquisition, and the surfaces of IW cakes are smooth, resulting in a consistent distance between sample and X-ray source for all measurements.  

Although fine-scale lithologic information was lost for the I W cake material, it still could be recovered in part from the X-radiographs taken of the core sections before the IW whole-round sample was selected.  

The qualitative pXRF geochemical information, systematicall y obtained at low spatial resolution to the full depth of continuou s core recovery, reveals trends and associations corresponding t o bulk sediment chemical variations.  

# XRD analysis  

XRD analysis was carried out on clay separates $<\!2\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction). On average, one sample $({\sim}5\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ per core was taken from the working halves for XRD analysis. The samples, chosen to characteriz e different lithologic intervals and facies, were selected based on visual core observations (e.g., color variability, visual changes in lithology, texture, etc.) and smear slide investigations.  

The sample was placed in $10\%$ acetic acid for at least $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on a n agitator to remove carbonate and then centrifuged for $15\,\mathrm{\min}$ a t $1500~\mathrm{rpm}$ . The acid was decanted, and $25~\mathrm{mL}$ of nanopure wate r was added to wash out remaining acid and salt before the sampl e was centrifuged for $15\,\mathrm{\min}$ at $1500\ \mathrm{rpm}$ . This procedure was repeated two more times. The clay plug resulting from the centrifugation was placed in $25\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\%$ borax solution and disaggregated fo r $1\,\mathrm{\min}\,\mathrm{~5~s~}$ . Afterward, the sample was centrifuged for $4\,\mathrm{\min}$ a t $750\;\mathrm{rpm}$ to remove the $>\!2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction, and the suspended liqui d was decanted into a separate centrifuge tube. The remaining cla y fraction was treated again with $25~\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\%$ borax solution, disaggregated once more to separate out any remaining ${<}2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ clay fraction, and centrifuged again for $4~\mathrm{min}$ at $750~\mathrm{rpm}$ . The suspende d fraction was decanted and added to the first ${<}2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ clay separate. The entire $<\!2\ensuremath{\,\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ fraction was then centrifuged for $15\,\mathrm{\min}$ a t $1500\;\mathrm{rpm}$ to remove the borax solution. The borax was decante d and replaced with $25~\mathrm{mL}$ of nanopure water. The sample was the n centrifuged for $60\ \mathrm{min}$ at $3000~\mathrm{rpm}$ , and the liquid was decanted. Thereafter, each sample was loaded with a pipette onto a zero-background silica disk using isopropyl alcohol. This method was applie d to all APC core samples. Samples taken from XCB and RCB core s were freeze-dried for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and placed into $10\%$ acetic acid. The samples were then sonicated for $2\,\,\mathrm{h}$ before being agitated overnight. The preparation then followed the method described above, starting with the first wash step in $25\;\mathrm{mL}$ of nanopure water.  

After the borax decanting step, $1~\mathrm{\mL}$ of $0.4\%$ molybdenit e $\left(\operatorname{MoS}_{2}\right)$ solution was added to all samples from Site U1532 that wer e taken above Core 379-U1532G-37R. The $M0S_{2}$ solution was adde d in an attempt to use the $M0S_{2}$ peak at $6.15\,\mathrm{\AA}$ as an internal standar d for aligning diffractograms and calculating peak area and height ratios between the $M0S_{2}$ standard and individual clay minerals. However, the $M0S_{2}$ solution was not added to samples taken from Core s 37R–47R and from all cores recovered at Site U1533 because th e $M0S_{2}$ peak heights and areas showed considerable variability in th e diffractograms of samples spiked in this way. The diffractograms o f samples from Cores 37R–47R and from all cores from Site U153 3 were aligned using the $3.34\,\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ peak of quartz.  

Following methods described by Moore and Reynolds (1989),  a small number of subsamples from Sites U1532 and U1533 wer e chosen for testing the presence of the clay minerals chlorite and kaolinite, whose peaks overlap in diffractograms. The samples wer e chosen based on the presence of only a single $3.5\textup{\AA}$ peak in diffractograms (in contrast, a characteristic kaolinite-chlorite double pea k was observed at $3.5\,\mathrm{\AA}$ in the high-resolution diffractometer scans o f most other samples) and underwent additional treatment.  

To test a sample for the (sole) presence of chlorite, an aliquo t was placed on a hot plate in $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\lor\mathrm{HCl}$ at $300^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ; this sampl e was kept at a boil for $2\;\mathrm{{h}}$ . Additional HCl was added as needed t o keep the sample saturated, and a stir bar was used at 60 rpm to kee p the sample in solution. Afterward, the sample was washed thre e times with nanopure water before it was loaded for XRD analysis. I f no peak or only a reduced peak at $3.5\mathrm{~\AA~}$ could be observed afterward, it proved the presence of chlorite in the untreated sample. T o test a sample for the presence of kaolinite, the same or another aliquot was placed in a furnace and heated at a controlled rate $\left(1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\right.$ increase per minute) to $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and maintained at this temperatur e for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ before allowing it to cool to room temperature and loading i t for XRD analysis. If the residual $3.5\textup{\AA}$ peak in the HCl-treated sample vanished or if a reduced and shifted peak in the heated-only sample was observed, it proved the presence of kaolinite in the original sample.  

Samples were analyzed on a Bruker D4 Endeavor diffractometer with a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtered $C\mathrm{uK}\alpha$ radiation (volt$\mathrm{{age=40\,kV,}}$ current $=40\,\mathrm{mA}$ , and divergence slit $=0.3\;\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{`}$ ). Prior to measuring all samples, a corundum standard was scanned from $20^{\circ}$ to $130^{\circ}2\theta$ . Three separate goniometer scans were performed on each sample. The first scan was performed on air-dried samples from $3.5^{\circ}$ to $15.5^{\circ}2\theta$ at a step size of $0.01658092^{\circ}$ per second. The second and third scans were performed after the sample was placed in an ethylene glycol atmosphere for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $65^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The second scan was run from $3.5^{\circ}$ to $40^{\circ}2\theta$ at a step size of $0.01658092^{\circ}$ per second to measure the main peaks of the major clay mineral groups smectite, illite, chlorite, and kaolinite. The third scan from $24.5^{\circ}$ to $26.0^{\circ}26\$ at a step size of $0.00829451^{\circ}$ per second was run to resolve the $3.54\,\mathrm{\AA}$ peak of kaolinite and the $3.58\,\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ peak of chlorite. At the beginning of the expedition, the third scan was conducted from $24.5^{\circ}$ to $26.5^{\circ}26\$ , but it was then realized that a narrower range was sufficient to resolve the kaolinite-chlorite double peak at $3.5\,\\mathrm{\breve{A}}$ , and subsequent goniometer scans were limited to $24.5^{\circ}$ to $26.0^{\circ}26\$ . Sample aliquots that had been heated to $550^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ or treated with HCl were scanned two additional times. The first scan was performed from $3.5^{\circ}$ to $40^{\circ}2\theta$ at a step size of $0.01658092^{\circ}$ per second, and the second scan was run from $12.5^{\circ}$ to $26.0^{\circ}26\$ at a step size of $0.01658092^{\circ}$ per second and from $24.5^{\circ}$ to $26.0^{\circ}26\$ at a step size of 0.00829451° per second.  

The diffractograms of the samples were evaluated with the Bruker DIFFRAC.EVA software package (version 4.2.1). The DIFFRAC.EVA manual available on board (and also the manual emailed to the ship by the manufacturer on request during the expedition) was actually for v. 3.0, which has a different user interface. As a consequence, some essential functions in DIFFRAC.EVA, such as baseline  correction  and  peak  subtraction,  could  only  be  applied insufficiently to the diffractograms. Therefore, clay mineral percentages presented in the site reports (see Lithostratigraphy in the Site U1532 chapter and Lithostratigraphy in the Site U1533 chapter [Wellner et al., 2021a, 2021b]) are preliminary results.  

Relative abundances of the major clay mineral groups were established on the basis of quantifying integrated peak areas and maximum peak intensities, preferentially from the analysis of the ethylene glycol–solvated samples. Contents of the clay mineral groups smectite, illite, chlorite, and kaolinite (in percent) were determined semiquantitatively following the methods described in Petschick et al. (1996) using empirically estimated weighting factors (Biscaye, 1964, 1965; Brindley and Brown, 1980). In addition, illite chemistry was evaluated by calculating its $5/10\,\mathrm{\AA}$ peak intensity ratio (Esquevin, 1969).  

# X-ray imaging  

All of the whole-round cores and a few archive halves were Xrayed for a preliminary assessment of core quality/drilling disturbance, sedimentary structures, and clast occurrence. Specific core sections were also X-rayed to identify depths for taking IW samples without destroying any key sediment intervals. The IODP X-ray system is composed of a $120\ \mathrm{kV},\ 1\ \mathrm{mA}$ constant potential X-ray source and a detector unit. The X-ray source is a Teledyne ICM CP120B portable X-ray generator with a $0.8\ \mathrm{mm}\,\times\,0.5\ \mathrm{mm}$ focal spot. The beam angle is $50^{\circ}\times50^{\circ}$ and generates a directional cone onto the detector, which is $65\;\mathrm{cm}$ from the source. The detector is a Go-Scan $1510\;\mathrm{H}$ unit composed of an array of CMOS sensors with an active area of $102{\mathrm{\,mm}}\times153{\mathrm{\,mm}}$ and a resolution of $99\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ .  

Each of the core sections passed through the imaging area at $12\,\mathrm{cm}$ increments with the working-half base facing upward, projecting ${\sim}15~\mathrm{cm}$ of core length onto the detector and providing a $3\,\mathrm{cm}$ overlap between individual images. The ideal parameters used during Expedition 379 were as follows:  

• 20 image stacks, • 300–400 ms exposure time, • Voltage $=100{-}110\,\mathrm{kV}$ , and • Current $=0.6–0.7\mathrm{\mA}$ .  

The X-radiograph raw images from Holes U1532A–U1532D were collected using Teledyne Go-Scan Sherlock software as 14 bit and then saved as 16-bit TIFF images, resulting in dark raw images prior to image corrections. The X-radiograph raw images from Hole U1532G and Holes U1533A–U1533D were collected as 16-bit images using the Integrated Measurement System (IMS) software (version 10.2) with LabView (version 17.0). The raw image outputs from both software packages already had the calibration for the detector (gain and offset corrections) applied. Image processing was completed using IODP in-house software that detects the location of the core in the image, compensates for core shape and thickness, and can be used to adjust the image contrast. Images were X-rayed by section, and therefore in most cases each X-radiograph for a specific section has a common grayscale. During Expedition 379, findings from X-radiographs merely assisted visual core description. Because of time constraints, X-ray images could not be routinely examined in detail and therefore observational results were not integrated in the VCDs.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifers, and dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) provided preliminary shipboard biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental information during Expedition 379. Occurrences of other microfossil groups such as calcareous nannofossils, ostracods, miospores, silicoflagellates, ebridians, endoskeletal dinoflagellates, and ichthyoliths were noted and, where possible, used to further refine shipboard biostratigraphic age control and for understanding of key paleoenvironmental or depositional changes. All micropaleontologists shared information regarding observations they made that are potentially important though ancillary to their primary task. For example, sieved residues from the radiolarian and foraminifer specialists’ preparations included other fossil groups plus rock and mineral components of value to geochemists or sedimentary petrologists.  

Shipboard biostratigraphic age assignments were based on analyses of microfossils from all mudline and core catcher samples, which were shared among the micropaleontology groups. Where appropriate, additional samples from split-core sections were analyzed, mostly as smear slides, to refine biostratigraphic boundaries, examine critical intervals, or, working with the lithostratigraphy team, investigate significant lithologic transitions or analyze sedimentary clasts. Core catcher samples from all holes were examined, including sites where two or more holes recovered overlapping stratigraphic intervals.  

Biostratigraphic methods for each microfossil group are presented individually in the representative sections below. All biostratigraphic events and zonal boundaries were compiled in reference to the Gradstein et al. (2012) geological timescale (GTS2012) and are presented in Figure F14. Diatoms and radiolarians provided the most biostratigraphic control for Miocene to re

cent intervals cored during Expedition 379. Ages assigned t o datum levels for these two groups largely followed the conventio n used during Expedition 374 (McKay et al., 2019), which utilize d age calibrations developed by the composite ordering of event s and model age output from constrained optimization (CONOP ) analyses of Southern Hemisphere data sets (Cody et al., 2008). These included, among others, results from the ANDRILL AND1B drill core (Cody et al., 2012), Leg 178 (Iwai et al., 2002; Winte r and Iwai, 2002) and Expedition 318 (Tauxe et al., 2012). Element s of the diatom biostratigraphic zonations for the Southern Ocea n (Harwood and Maruyama, 1992; Censarek and Gersonde, 2002; Zielinski and Gersonde, 2002) and Antarctic continental shelf (Olney et al., 2007; Winter et al., 2012) were also integrated in Figur e F14. The radiolarian biostratigraphic zones follow the middl e Miocene to Pleistocene zonation defined and refined by Lazaru s (1990, 1992) (Figure F14).  

An effort to utilize biostratigraphic zones of austral temperat e planktonic foraminifers was based on Jenkins (1993) and datu m ages derived from the New Zealand Geological Timescale and correlated to New Zealand Series and Stages from Crundwell et al. (2016), but foraminifers were too rare throughout the recovered sequences to apply a foraminifer-based biostratigraphic scheme. Neogene  dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) biostratigraphy  is  currentl y developing, and tentative placement of selected biostratigraphic datums for southern high latitudes is drawn mainly from Bijl et al. (2018) (Figure F14).  

Reworking and recycling of older microfossils into younger deposits is a particular problem for age dating in glacial proximal depositional settings. Every effort was made to recognize displace d fossils before depositional age assignments were made because reworked zonal markers may imply an age older than the actual age o f deposition. Significant reworking is often obvious (e.g., Paleozoi c pollen in Quaternary marine sediment or Oligocene diatoms i n Pliocene diamicton), but recycling of, for example, early Pliocene diatoms into late Pliocene sediments can be difficult to recognize. Fo r this reason, we put much heavier weight on first stratigraphic occurrences than last, especially where fossils are relatively rare o r poorly preserved. When recognized as such, reworked fossils, especially in glacial sediments, can provide information regarding sediment transport and provenance and can act as important record s that document subglacial or otherwise inaccessible sedimentary deposits.  

The Biostratigraphy sections in the site chapters present  a summary of biostratigraphic information plus limited paleoenvironmental interpretation provided by each microfossil group an d information regarding approaches and literature used to guid e taxonomic identifications. Data for each microfossil group ar e presented in abundance and taxonomic distribution charts tha t record occurrences of key taxa observed in samples from eac h hole. Relative abundance and preservation data were entere d through the DESClogik application into the LIMS database for al l identified microfossil taxa and all paleontological data gathere d during shipboard investigations. These data are available fro m the LIMS database. Taxonomic occurrence charts also recor d suspected upsection reworking or otherwise out-of-place species.  

Distribution charts for microfossil groups presented in each sit e chapter are based exclusively on shipboard analysis. Shipboard biostratigraphic studies focused primarily on the identification of biostratigraphic horizons (biohorizons) in the cores and are biase d toward the reporting of age-diagnostic species and identifying intervals and ages of reworking. Events reported include the last appearance datum (LAD) or first appearance datum (FAD) of a taxon’ s stratigraphic range, in some cases with modification to identify th e last common/abundant appearance datum (LCAD/LAAD) or firs t common/abundant appearance datum (FCAD/FAAD) to identif y an abundance change within a taxon’s range if these are more reliable for correlation. Where possible, identification of a sequence o f biohorizons in stratigraphic order was used to define biostratigraphic zones and subzones using standard schemes. A summar y table of the main biostratigraphic events identified at each site i s presented in each site chapter. The chronostratigraphic compilatio n provides a framework for estimating sediment accumulation rates, identifying hiatuses, guiding correlation between holes, and assessing recovery as compared with the Scientific Prospectus (Gohl et al., 2017). All age models presented in this volume are preliminary an d may be subject to moderate or significant revision following postcruise research updates.  

# Diatoms  

# Diatom taxonomy  

Taxonomic concepts for Neogene Antarctic diatoms, many o f which are endemic to the southern high latitudes, have develope d largely through the last nearly $50~\mathrm{y}$ of stratigraphic drilling in th e Southern Ocean and Antarctic shelf by the Deep Sea Drillin g Project (DSDP), ODP, the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, an d IODP (McCollum, 1975; Gombos, 1976; Schrader, 1976; Ciesielski, 1983; Gersonde, 1990, 1991; Gersonde and Burckle, 1990; Baldauf and Barron, 1991; Fenner, 1991; Harwood and Maruyama, 1992; Mahood and Barron, 1996; Gersonde and Barcena, 1998; Censarek and Gersonde, 2002; Iwai and Winter, 2002; Zielinsk i and Gersonde, 2002; Arney et al., 2003; Bohaty et al., 2003; Whitehead and Bohaty, 2003). Parallel to the above efforts, ice platfor m stratigraphic drilling programs on the Antarctic margin recovere d neritic diatom floras that serve as useful Antarctic continenta l shelf taxonomic and biostratigraphic references. These program s include the Dry Valley Drilling Project (DVDP; Brady, 1979), McMurdo Sound Sediment and Tectonic Studies (MSSTS; Harwood, 1986), Cenozoic Investigation in the Western Ross Sea (CIROS; Harwood 1989; Winter and Harwood, 1997), the Cape Robert s Project (Bohaty et al., 1998; Scherer et al., 2000; Olney et al., 2007, 2009) and ANDRILL (Sjunneskog et al., 2012; Winter et al., 2012). Other useful taxonomic references for Neogene and modern Antarctic marine diatoms include Fenner et al. (1976), Akiba (1982), Harwood et al. (1989), Medlin and Priddle (1990), Yanagisawa an d Akiba (1990), Cremer et al. (2003), and Scott and Thomas (2005).  

# Methods for diatom sample preparation and analysis  

With a primary focus on core catcher samples, smear slides wer e examined on a routine basis for diatom stratigraphic markers. Fo r samples in which diatoms were very rare or highly fragmented, additional  preparation  steps  were  undertaken.  These  involve d (1) making strewn slides from raw sample material disaggregated i n deionized water and/or (2) concentrating larger specimens throug h sieving at ${>}10~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with polyester mesh or ${>}20~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ with a stainles s steel sieve. Examination of the sieved fractions or differentially settled strewn slides allowed recovery of identifiable diatom specimen s in samples characterized by low concentration and high fragmentation of diatoms. We acknowledge that this approach likely increase d the presence of larger, more heavily silicified species and remove d many potentially biostratigraphically important, smaller diatom s from these slides. However, this approach is deemed essential fo r providing a sufficient number of specimens to allow rapid age interpretation of core catcher samples. Both smear and strewn slid e preparations were mounted on cover glasses and permanently fixe d to labeled glass slides using Norland optical adhesive Number 6 1 (refractive index $=1.56\AA$ and cured under an ultraviolet lamp.  

Samples prepared for diatom analysis were examined usin g Zeiss Axioskop transmitted-light microscopes. Photomicrograph s were taken using a SPOT Flex $64~\mathrm{Mp}$ digital camera. A Hitach i TM3000 tabletop scanning electron microscope (SEM) was available for higher magnification micrographs of selected specimen s when deemed advantageous to taxonomic identification and dat a production but was not utilized for diatom analysis during Expedition 379 because of the persistent ship movement related to weathe r and sea state. Qualitative siliceous microfossil group abundance s were determined from smear slides using $630\times$ magnification. Car e was taken to ensure smear slides were prepared with simila r amounts of sediment. For each sample, the following abundances o f diatoms were qualitatively estimated by light-microscopic observations with the examination of five random fields of view (FOVs):  

• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no diatom debris).   
• $\mathrm{~T~}=$ trace (trace quantities $<\!2\%$ ).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(2\%-5\%$ diatoms).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $(5\%{-}10\%$ diatoms).   
• $C=$ common $\underline{{{10\%-20\%}}}$ diatoms).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(20\%{-}40\%$ diatoms).   
• $\mathrm{V}=$ very abundant $(40\%{-}60\%$ diatoms).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ mass abundance $560\%$ diatoms).  

Trace quantities $(<\!2\%)$ may include very rare, heavily degraded , and unidentifiable fragments, possibly including pyritized, recrystallized, or partially dissolved diatoms that indicate nothing mor e than the prior occurrence of diatomaceous debris impacted b y heavy dissolution or diagenesis. Visual estimates of percentages followed standard guidelines (e.g., Rothwell, 1989).  

The following relative abundances of individual taxa were categorized in reference to their occurrence in FOVs or to a travers e across a $40\;\mathrm{mm}$ wide coverslip ( $\mathord{\sim}100$ FOVs at $630\times$ magnification):  

• $\mathrm{~T~}=$ trace ( $_{<1}$ specimen per 5 average horizontal transects [40 $\mathrm{mm}]$ ).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen within 1–5 transects).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few (1–5 specimens per transect).   
• $C=$ common (1–5 specimens per ${\sim}5$ FOVs).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (2 or more specimens per FOV).   
• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant (the taxon represents $>\!50\%$ of all diatoms in diatom-rich samples).  

The counting concept of Schrader and Gersonde (1978) was applied for the above. Shipboard observations of diatom species occurrences logged in DESClogik focused on the presence of agediagnostic species, so the distribution data may not accurately characterize the true nature of the full diatom assemblage, which is typically dominated by non–age diagnostic (e.g., long ranging) taxa.  

Preservation of diatoms was qualitatively assessed with regar d to both the degree of dissolution and fragmentation. The degree o f siliceous microfossil fragmentation often mirrors dissolution, bu t the two factors are not always directly correlated. Diatoms wit h well-preserved fine structures can be highly fragmented. Dissolution is a wholly chemical process (Warnock and Scherer, 2015), bu t fragmentation can be dominantly or entirely due to mechanical processes such as compaction or subglacial shear strain (Scherer et al., 2004). Fragmentation of finely silicified diatoms can occur in sediments as a result of digestion by grazers and deposition in fecal pellets.  

The degree of dissolution was qualitatively graded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{low}$ (slight to no apparent dissolution [fine structures generally preserved]).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (moderate dissolution [fine structures generally lost]).   
• $\mathrm{{H}=\mathrm{{high}}}$ (severe effects of dissolution, including widened areolae, relatively abundant margins and cingula compared with valves, and notably higher proportions of heavily silicified forms).  

The degree of fragmentation was graded as follows:  

• $\mathrm{L}=\mathrm{low}$ (a majority of valves are unbroken). • $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate $750\%$ of diatom valves are broken, but most are identifiable). • $\mathrm{{H}=\mathrm{{high}}}$ (valves highly fragmented with very few complete valves present, hampering identification).  

# Diatom age assignment  

Initial shipboard diatom age assignment of individual upper Paleogene and Neogene samples was based on identification of primary and secondary datum events that are well calibrated a t Southern Ocean sites. Biostratigraphic zones were also define d where possible using the Neogene zonal schemes derived fro m Southern Ocean sites by Harwood and Maruyama (1992), Zielinsk i and Gersonde (2002; Oligocene to recent) and Censarek and Gersonde (2002; Miocene) and for Antarctic continental shelf sites b y Winter et al. (2012). A wealth of biostratigraphic information i s available from the drill core–based studies listed in Diatom taxonomy and the integrated biochronological syntheses in the associated volumes for each leg/expedition (e.g., Gersonde et al., 1990; Barron et al., 1991; Harwood et al., 1992; Iwai et al., 2002; Tauxe e t al., 2012). Ages applied to specific diatom events and zonal boundaries were guided by successive iterations of the diatom biochronology afforded by CONOP (Cody et al., 2008, 2012; Florindo et al., 2013). These ages are in general agreement with ages of appearanc e and extinction of Southern Ocean endemic diatoms presented i n Barron (2003), although some offset of latest Miocene to early Pliocene datums were noted by Iwai et al. (2002) and Tauxe et al. (2012). Age assignments for diatom datum levels used during Expeditio n 379 are presented in Figure F14 and Table T1. This data set i s adapted from the working data set of Expedition 374 in the Ross Se a (McKay et al., 2019). Minor adjustments have been made based o n current knowledge and recent observations and calibration. It is important to note that data sets like this, although currently state o f the art, are in continual revision as more data and analyses becom e available, including from this expedition.  

# Radiolarians  

# Radiolarian taxonomy  

The main taxonomic concepts for the Neogene radiolarian s studied here are based primarily on Popofsky (1908), Riedel (1958), Petrushevskaya (1967, 1975), Lombari and Lazarus (1988), Lazaru s (1990, 1992), Caulet (1991), Abelmann (1992), Nigrini and Sanfilippo (2001), Vigour and Lazarus (2002), Lazarus et al. (2005), an d Renaudie and Lazarus (2012, 2013, 2015, 2016). All radiolaria n semiquantitative abundance data produced on board were logged i n DESClogik and are available for each site (see DESC_WKB in Supplementary material).  

# Methods for sample preparation and analysis of radiolarians  

To minimize paleontological preparation time, the followin g protocol was adopted for combined preparation of samples for radiolarians, foraminifers, and ostracods. These preparations also provided residues for the analysis of other fossil groups, as well as roc k and mineral fragments. A $5{-}20\ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sediment sample, generall y from core catchers but also from other samples as they becam e available, was placed in a beaker with $50~\mathrm{mL}$ of water (per $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ o f sediment), a $15\%$ solution of hydrogen peroxide, and a small quantity of diluted borax. The beaker was then warmed on a hot plat e with a magnetic automatic stirrer. When effervescence was finishe d (typically approximately between $30\;\mathrm{min}$ and $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$ ), the solution wa s washed through two sieves, 150 and $38~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ . The $<\!38\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ fractio n was preserved for further exploration for smaller phytoplankto n such as diatoms, nannofossils, and so forth and for quality control o f the sieving procedure. The $38{-}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ residue and the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ residue were placed in separate bowls. Using a pipette, several drop s of each was placed on two $25\ \mathrm{mm}\times75\ \mathrm{mm}$ microscope slides an d allowed to dry. Once dried, a few drops of Norland optical adhesiv e Number 61 were added and covered by a $22\:\mathrm{mm}\times50\:\mathrm{mm}$ coverslip. The microscope slides were then placed under the ultraviolet lam p to cure for $15~\mathrm{min}$ . The rest of the 38–150 and ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction s were reserved for foraminiferal and other analyses (see Foraminifers).  

# Microscopy and identification  

Radiolarian species were identified and their abundance estimated using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with bright field illumination at $100\times$ , $200\times$ , and $400\times$ magnification. Photomicrograph s were taken using a SPOT Flex 64 Mp digital camera and uploade d to the LIMS database.  

For each sample, the total abundance of radiolarians was qualitatively estimated by light-microscopic observations at $100\times$ magnification along one horizontal traverse of the slide and recorded a s follows:  

• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $_{>100}$ specimens per traverse).   
• $C=$ common (51–100 specimens per traverse).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ frequent (11–50 specimens per traverse).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1–10 specimens per traverse).   
• $\mathrm{Tr=}$ trace (1–10 specimens per slide).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (absent).  

Qualitative estimates of individual species abundances were als o recorded by scanning through both slides at $100\times$ magnification a s follows:

# Radiolarian biostratigraphy and age assignment  

The Southern Ocean zonation used here was based on Lazaru s (1992; for the middle Miocene to Pleistocene). The original age estimates for radiolarian datums for the early Miocene to Pleistocen e were based on their calibration to magnetostratigraphy accordin g to Hays and Opdyke (1967), Gersonde et al. (1990), Lazaru s (1990), Spieß (1990), Barron et al. (1991), Caulet (1991), Harwoo d et al. (1992), Lazarus (1992), and Ramsey and Baldauf (1999). Ag e estimates were recalibrated to the GTS2012 using the Neptune database (http://www.nsb-mfn-berlin.de). Some additional age estimates from Florindo et al. (2013) were added as secondar y datums for the Miocene and Pliocene (Table T2) when appropriat e and when consistent with the stratigraphic ranges found in Renaudie (2012).

et al. (2017) and is augmented by circum-Antarctic taxonomic wor k by Fillon (1974), Anderson, (1975), Osterman and Kellogg (1979), Ishman and Domack (1994), Igarashi et al. (2001), and Majewsk i (2005, 2013). Few occurrences of foraminifers were noted in prePleistocene sediments, and no detailed systematic analysis was performed on these materials during shipboard study. The classification of Loeblich and Tappan (1988) was followed for determination s at the genus level.  

# Methods for sample preparation and analysis of foraminifers  

Most sediment samples $(10{-}20~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ were placed in a beake r with $100~\mathrm{mL}$ of water, a $10\%$ solution of hydrogen peroxide, and  a small quantity $\mathrm{(<}5\;\mathrm{mL})$ ) of diluted borax (depending on the presenc e of clay). For Site U1533, however, hydrogen peroxide and bora x were not used so that the isotope signal of the foraminifers would b e preserved. As described for radiolarians, the beakers were warme d on a hot plate with a magnetic stirrer. When effervescence was finished $\left({\sim}30\mathrm{\min}\right)$ , the solution was washed through two sieves: 15 0 and $38\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ . The $<\!38\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction was preserved for further exploration for smaller phytoplankton. The 38–150 and ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ residue s were placed in separate bowls and placed in an oven at $45\mathrm{^\circC}$ unti l dry (minimum ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{h}$ ).  

The dried residues were then weighed and observed under  a binocular light microscope. Each of the individual specimens wer e picked from the sample using a very fine brush and mounted on  a gridded cardboard slide coated with a thin layer of water-solubl e paste made from gum tragacanth powder. Tephras and ichthyolith s were also picked for postcruise isotopic or radiometric dating. Afte r foraminifer picking, sieved residues that included mineral matter, including sand and larger clasts, were made available to the lithostratigraphy team.  

# Microscopy and identification  

Foraminifer species were identified using a Zeiss Discovery V 8 binocular light microscope. Photomicrographs were taken using  a SPOT Idea digital camera and uploaded to the LIMS database.  

Species identifications were generally made on the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ siz e fraction. Time permitting, the $38{-}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction was scanne d for small or rare species.  

The preservation state of planktonic and benthic foraminifer s was estimated as follows:  

• $\mathrm{E}=$ excellent (totally glassy specimens with no to very little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (some minor evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (common but minor calcite overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
• $\mathbf{P}=$ poor (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, or fragmentation).  

The planktonic to benthic foraminifer ratio (P/B) was calculate d using the relative abundance of each group and then was used as  a first approximation of carbonate dissolution.  

# Foraminifer biostratigraphy and age assignment  

Given the southern high-latitude location of Sites U1532 an d U1533, the Subantarctic zonal scheme of Berggren (1992; DSDP Le g 120, Kerguelen Plateau) and austral temperate zonal scheme of Jenkins (1993) were utilized with ages updated to the GTS2012, as wel l as planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphic datums of Crundwell e t al. (2016). The scarcity of foraminifers in recovered sediments precluded application of biostratigraphic schemes in the pre-Pleistocene strata. The foraminifer biostratigraphic ages that were use d during Expedition 379 are summarized in Table T3.

Late Paleogene–Neogene dinocyst taxonomy follows that presented in Hannah et al., (2001), Clowes et al. (2016a), Williams et al. (2017), and Bijl et al. (2018). No complete integrated stratigraphi c dinocyst framework currently exists for the younger Neogene of th e Southwest Pacific, although the recent (core top) distribution ha s been documented in southern high latitudes (Esper and Zonneveld, 2007; Prebble et al., 2013). Antarctic miospores (terrestrial polle n and spores) of Neogene age are generally of insufficient diversit y and abundance to support biostratigraphic studies (Cantrill an d Poole, 2012). Furthermore, biogeographic provincialism is likely t o further reduce the utility of extrapolating occurrence datum s around the Antarctic margin, for example from the (relatively) better seafloor-documented western Ross Sea (Askin and Raine, 2000; Raine and Askin, 2001; Prebble et al., 2006; Kulhanek et al., 2019).  

# Methods for palynology study  

Approximately $_{5-10~\mathrm{g}}$ of each sediment sample was processe d for shipboard palynology analysis (e.g., Prebble et al., 2013). Tw o sample processing methods were employed. Most samples wer e processed using a disaggregation/sieving method described in Riding and Kyffin-Hughes (2011). Samples were disaggregated by soaking and agitation in $1\%$ borax solution followed by $10\%$ sodiu m hexametaphosphate and then sieved through a $10~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh. Th e light (organic rich) fraction was concentrated by swirling and decanting. Samples were put in an ultrasonic bath for ${\sim}30\;s$ when required to further disaggregate and remove clays. For most samples, a variation of the Riding and Kyffin-Hughes (2011) method wa s used, whereby disaggregation was achieved using only water rathe r than sodium hexametaphosphate. Samples with high concentrations of biogenic silica were subsequently processed using a secon d method with hydrofluoric acid (HF) described below.  

Samples were digested with $10\%$ HCl and cold $48\%$ HF to dissolve carbonates and silicates followed by $30\%$ HCl to remove silicate gels. Centrifuging and decanting were carried out after eac h step. Residues were filtered through a $10\,\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh and sieve d through a $250\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh when required. The processing method applied to each sample is recorded in the site chapters. Where duplicate samples were processed, palynological results from the tw o methods were found to be comparable in these nonindurated sediments. All samples were mounted on glass microscope slides usin g Norland optical adhesive Number 61 as the mounting medium. Species identification and data collection were carried out with  a Zeiss Axio microscope using bright field illumination at $400\times$ , $630\times$ (oil), and $1000\times$ (oil) magnification. Photomicrography was conducted using a SPOT Flex $64\,\mathrm{Mp}$ digital camera.  

# Palynomorph abundance and preservation  

Palynomorph abundance and palynofacies schemes applied her e followed those reported for the Ross Sea (McKay et al., 2019) to facilitate future comparison. Palynofacies categories are described i n Clowes et al. (2016b).  

Palynofacies were grouped into the following broad categories:  

• In situ marine organic-walled dinocysts, • Reworked marine organic-walled dinocysts, • Foraminifer test linings,   
• Prasinophytes,   
• Acritarchs,   
• In situ miospores (pollen and spores),   
• Reworked miospores (pollen and spores), • Black phytoclasts,   
• Brown phytoclasts,   
• Fungal spores, and   
• Amorphous organic matter.  

For semiquantitative estimates of the abundance of these palynofacies groups, the following scale was used:  

• $\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( ${\mathrm{\left[}{\sqrt{\frac{}{}90\%}}\right.}$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!50\%{-}90\%$ of palynomorphs).   
• $C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathrm{F}=$ few $\!\!\:(1\%\!-\!10\%)$ of palynomorphs).   
• ${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(\!\!\!\!\!-1\%\!\!\!\!)$ of palynomorphs).   
• $\mathbf{BR}=\mathbf{\partial}$ barren to rare (few specimens identified in two slides).   
• $\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (not present).  

Dinocysts in each sample were identified at genus or specie s level. The following qualitative indication of their occurrence i s given in the tables of each site chapter:  

• ${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ present.   
• ${\mathrm{XX}}=$ common to abundant.  

For biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental purposes, shipboard analysis of palynomorphs focused primarily on determinin g the presence of age-diagnostic dinocyst taxa and characterizing th e palynological assemblage in terms of paleoenvironment. When possible with given dinocyst yields and time, dinocyst counts were carried out per sample. For each sample, one $22\:\mathrm{mm}\times10\:\mathrm{mm}$ slide wa s scanned and counted.  

Miospores identified during these counts were also quantitatively registered and attributed to the following four broad categories:  

• Saccate pollen, • Nothofagus pollen, • Other pollen, and • Spores.  

Where possible, miospores were identified to genus and specie s level using Askin and Raine (2000), Raine and Askin (2001), Prebbl e et al. (2006), Raine et al. (2011), Prebble (2016), and reference s therein.  

Palynomorph preservation was qualitatively classified as one o f the following levels:  

• $\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of degradation or oxidation).   
• $\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (some evidence of degradation or oxidation).   
• $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{poor}$ (major degradation or oxidation has occurred).  

# Palynology-based paleoenvironmental analysis  

Three palynomorph groups were used to infer aspects of th e depositional environment: total palynofacies, dinocyst assemblages, and miospore assemblages. In suitable depositional settings, tota l palynofacies data can provide relative information about source, transport distance, and reworking of the organic carbon fractio n (e.g., Tyson, 1995; Clowes et al., 2016b; Prebble et al., 2018).  

The use of dinocysts as paleoenvironmental indicators derive s from information on their present-day global distribution, includin g in southern high latitudes (Esper and Zonneveld, 2007; Prebble e t al., 2013; Zonneveld et al., 2013). These studies show dinoflagellat e distribution in the modern ocean is strongly influenced by sea-surface temperature and surface productivity. Because many of th e modern species were apparently extant during the Neogene an d Quaternary, these observations may be used with caution (e.g., D e Schepper et al., 2011) to infer past surface ocean conditions. Othe r aquatic palynomorphs, in particular acritarchs and prasinophytes, were used to infer information on meltwater input/water stratification. Miospore assemblages can provide quantitative and semiquantitative information about terrestrial conditions at the time th e source vegetation grew (e.g., Warny et al., 2009; Prebble et al., 2017), again with caveats arising from the appropriateness of the analog s (Jordan et al., 2011).  

# Other fossil occurrences  

Other fossil groups were also noted during Expedition 379. These included rare ostracods encountered during foraminifera l preparation and other fossil groups noted and utilized when possible during smear slide analysis for diatoms, including calcareou s nannofossils, silicoflagellates, ebridians, endoskeletal dinoflagellates, chrysophyte cysts, sponge spicules, and ichthyolith fragments. When possible, these fossils, notably silicoflagellates and ebridians, were identified and utilized informally in the biostratigraphic assessment. Calcareous nannofossils were specifically sought as par t of routine smear slide analysis by diatom paleontologists.  

# Paleomagnetism  

We conducted paleomagnetic studies primarily to determine directions of remanence components. Routine measurements wer e completed on almost all archive-half sections with stepwise alternating field (AF) demagnetization. In a very few instances where th e intensity of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) exceeded th e maximum magnetic flux change that the superconducting roc k magnetometer (SRM) is capable of measuring, only NRM was save d and the archive-half sections were not demagnetized. Discrete cub e samples were taken from selected working-half sections and measured with stepwise AF demagnetization. These data were used fo r magnetostratigraphic dating and complemented by rock magneti c measurements. Paleomagnetic data were integrated with biostratigraphic data to develop shipboard age models. Icefield MI-5 cor e orientation tool data were acquired for all APC cores, but these dat a were not applied to shipboard interpretation of paleomagnetic data. The orientation data will help to improve postcruise interpretatio n of paleomagnetic measurements.  

# Magnetic measurements  

Remanent magnetization was measured using a SRM (2G Enterprises model 760R-4K, $\#121$ ) equipped with direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and an in-line, automated AF demagnetizer capable of reaching a peak field o f $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Ocean drilling cores generally carry secondary remanenc e components (overprints) that include natural viscous remanenc e and sometimes a steep downward-pointing component attribute d to the drill string. To separate the overprints from the characteristi c remanence (ChRM), stepwise demagnetization experiments wer e performed.  

# Archive-half sections  

Measurements of archive-half sections were conducted usin g the SRM IMS 10.2 software. The nominal sample-area paramete r was $13.4\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for RCB archive-half sections and $17.5\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for HLAP C and XCB archive-half sections. The measurement interval an d speed were $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ and $10\;\mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s}_{\mathrm{{z}}}$ , respectively. The spatial resolutio n is determined from the integrated response function (following Acton et al., 2017) with effective lengths of $7.3\,\mathrm{cm}$ for the $x-$ - and $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ -axe s and $9.0\;\mathrm{cm}$ for the $z\cdot$ -axis. The practical noise level of the SRM is ${\sim}2$ $\times\:10^{-9}\:\mathrm{Am^{2}}$ and is primarily controlled by the magnetization of th e core liner and the background magnetization of the measuremen t tray.  

At the beginning of every working shift (approximately every 1 2 h), we cleaned the sample tray. It was then AF demagnetized with  a peak field of $30~\mathrm{mT},$ and its remanence was measured to monito r any changes to the sample tray during the course of the expeditio n and to ensure accurate tray correction values.  

NRM measurements of archive-half sections were made at 2. 5 cm intervals with a $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ trailer and leader interval to monitor th e background magnetic  moment.  Previous reports suggest tha t higher AF demagnetization fields produce significant anhystereti c remanent magnetization (ARM) along the $z$ -axis of the SRM. Wit h this limitation, we measured the initial NRM and the NRM after A F demagnetization with peak fields of 5, 10, 15, and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ using th e 2G Enterprises Model 2G600 in-line demagnetizer.  

AF demagnetization results were plotted individually as vecto r plots (Zijderveld, 1967) and as downhole variations with depth. W e inspected the plots visually to judge whether the remanence afte r demagnetization at the highest AF step reflects the ChRM and geomagnetic polarity sequence. Usually, the $20~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetizatio n step was assumed to represent the ChRM and was therefore use d for further interpretation.

Section-half data collected on the pass-through SRM were uploaded to the LIMS database.  

# Discrete samples  

Depending on characteristics such as lithologic changes or t o refine the magnetostratigraphy, we typically collected one or tw o oriented discrete samples per core. These discrete samples wer e used for measurements of mean (bulk) magnetic susceptibility, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), and NRM and its stepwise AF demagnetization. We collected discrete samples from eac h site by pushing plastic Natsuhara-Giken (“Japanese”) cubes (with a  2 cm external edge length and an internal volume of ${\sim}7~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) int o working-half sections with the arrow marker on the cube pointin g upcore. The sample $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis is toward the double lines on the working-half sections, and the up arrow marks the negative $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axis (toward core top; Figure F15A, F15C). When the sediment was mor e indurated, the sediment was extruded onto a clean cutting boar d and the cube was placed on top. When the sediment (or hard rock ) was too lithified to use the extruder, oriented cubes $({\sim}8~\mathrm{cm^{3}})$ wer e cut and trimmed using a dual-blade saw.  

For discrete samples, we performed successive AF demagnetization up to a field of $100\,\mathrm{mT}$ with the DTech AF demagnetizer (Model D-2000). Remanence was measured after each demagnetization ste p on the AGICO JR-6 spinner magnetometer. We analyzed the stepwise demagnetization data of the discrete samples by principal component analysis (PCA) to define the ChRM (Kirschvink, 1980).  

AMS and mean (bulk) magnetic susceptibility of the discret e samples were measured on a KLY 4S Kappabridge. To ensure accurate susceptibility values, we calibrated the KLY 4S at least prior t o each site using the standard provided by AGICO. The Kappabridg e SUFAR software measures AMS by rotating the sample along thre e axes, stacking the data, and estimating the best-fit second-orde r tensor. The mean (bulk) magnetic susceptibility is calculated as th e average of the magnetic susceptibilities in all three orientations, an d we referred to this as mean magnetic susceptibility throughout Expedition 379. We only use the directions and (relative) amplitude s of the three principal axes of the susceptibility tensor, $\upkappa_{\mathrm{max}}$ (maximum susceptibility axis), $\upkappa_{\mathrm{int}}$ (intermediate axis), and $\kappa_{\mathrm{min}}$ (minimum axis), to approximate magnetic fabric (i.e., grain shape an d orientation). When sediments are deposited in an undisturbed environment, sedimentary fabrics are oblate and the vertical axis ha s minimum susceptibility. Disturbance by slumping or other deformation often yields triaxial fabrics. Hence, we use the AMS as a n indicator of disturbance to complement the information on drillin g disturbance given by the core description.  

Discrete data collected on the KLY 4S Kappabridge and on th e JR-6 were uploaded to the LIMS database.  

# Coordinates  

All magnetic data are reported relative to IODP orientatio n conventions: $+x$ points into the face of the working-half core section, $+y$ points toward the left side of the working-half core sectio n when looking downcore, and $+z$ is downcore (Figure F15A). Th e relationship between the SRM coordinates $(X,\,Y,$ and $Z_{.}$ ) and th e sample coordinates $(x,\,y,$ and $z_{.}$ ) is $+X=+x,\,+Y=\,+y,$ and $+Z=-z$ for archive-half sections and $+X=\;-x,\;+Y=\;-y_{:}$ , and $+Z=-z$ fo r working-half sections (Figure F15). Note that the orientation o f the SRM axes forms a left-handed coordinate system that is converted to a right-handed system in the SRM software by multiplying the calibration constant for the $y$ -axis by $^{-1}$ . The orientation o f discrete samples depends on how the sample is collected. For samples collected by pushing the Japanese cube into the working-hal f section, the arrow on the sample points upcore along the $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axi s and is along the face of the working-half core section as in Figur e F15A and F15C. The orientation of sawed cubes and cubes place d on top of extruded sediment follows the orientation of the Japanese cubes. The discrete samples were placed in the AGICO JR- 6 spinner magnetometer as shown in Figure F16. We entered value s of $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ for azimuth and dip, respectively, in the JR-6 software. Data for inclination and declination consistent with thos e from the SRM were saved as geographic coordinates in the JR- 6 data files.

# Core orientation  

Cores were collected using nonmagnetic core barrels for the APC, HLAPC, and RCB coring systems. These nonmagnetic core barrels are weaker than the steel core barrels and cannot be used with the XCB system because its rotation is driven from the top of the barrel. When APC/XCB coring, the BHA included a Monel (nonmagnetic) drill collar. The Monel drill collar is required when the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool is deployed. When an APC core is taken, the Icefield tool is positioned so that it is within the Monel drill collar so that the tool is not within the more intense magnetic field of the normal drill collars.  

The Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool can only be used with APC core barrels. It uses three orthogonally mounted fluxgate magnetometers to record the orientation of the double lines scribed on the core liner with respect to magnetic north. The tool declination, inclination, total magnetic field, and temperature are recorded internally at a regular interval until the tool’s memory capacity is filled. For the measurement interval of 10 s used during Expedition 379, the tool can typically be run for more than a day, although we aimed to switch tools more frequently than that. Prior to firing the APC, the core barrel is held stationary (along with the pipe and BHA) for several minutes. During this time, data are recorded (while the Icefield tool is within the Monel drill collar) to constrain the core orientation. When the APC fires, the core barrel is assumed to maintain the same orientation. An antispiral key keeps the core barrel from rotating as it is fired, but the core may rotate and/or the core liner can twist as it penetrates the sediments.  

The Icefield MI-5 core orientation data collected during Expedition 379 are given along with the observed core mean paleomagnetic directions in a table in each site chapter. The mean direction of each core is computed using Fisher statistics from the paleomagnetic archive-half section measurements.  

All directions with positive inclinations were inverted to their antipodal position by multiplying the inclination by $^{-1}$ and adding $180^{\circ}$ to the declination. We then computed the mean by using all directions with inclinations between $-40^{\circ}$ and $-90^{\circ}$ .  

The orientation correction that converts the observed declination $\left(D_{\mathrm{obs}}\right)$ to a true declination $(D_{\mathrm{true}})$ is given by  

$$
D_{\mathrm{true}}=D_{\mathrm{obs}}+\mathrm{MTF}+D_{\mathrm{amb}},
$$  

where MTF is the magnetic tool face angle from the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool and $D_{\mathrm{amb}}$ is the ambient geomagnetic field declination  obtained  from  geomagnetic  field  models.  Using $69^{\circ}\mathrm{S}/109^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ as mean coordinates, the World Magnetic Model 2015 gives a value of ${\sim}45^{\circ}$ for the drill sites. Given that the Antarctic plate has not moved significantly over the past 20 My (Torsvik et al., 2012), the expected true declination is roughly $0^{\circ}$ .  

Neither the core mean directions nor the Icefield MI-5 observations are ideal for use in core orientation but may help to improve the interpretation of the paleomagnetic data at a later stage. The steepness of the paleomagnetic field (with an inclination generally ${\sim}70^{\circ}$ ) and the present-day geomagnetic field (inclination ${\sim}70^{\circ})$ result in the horizontal component (declination) being only a very small part of the total vector field. For example, when the inclination is $80^{\circ}$ , a measurement error of only $20^{\circ}$ in angular distance of the geomagnetic field can yield a declination of $0^{\circ}$ versus $180^{\circ}$ .  

Indeed, the corrected declinations cluster around the expected value of $0^{\circ}$ but exhibit a bias to westerly directions (see data presented in the respective site chapters). During Expedition 379, we did not use the correction for shipboard interpretation, but we intend to apply it during further postcruise data processing.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Magnetic polarity zones were predominantly assigned based on changes in inclination after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ peak AF demagnetization that occur in undisturbed cores recovered by all coring devices. Sediment disturbance caused by coring or geological processes (e.g., slumping or faulting) often leads to distorted and unreliable paleomagnetic directional records and largely altered sediment fabric. We used the classification of drilling disturbance made during the shipboard core description to mark disturbed intervals and avoided using paleomagnetic data from those intervals.  

Once a magnetostratigraphy was established for a given hole, we correlated the pattern to the GTS2012 (Table T5). The GTS2012 includes orbitally tuned reversals between Chron C1n and the base of Subchron $C5\mathrm{r}.2\mathrm{n}$ (0–11.657 Ma) and between the base of Chron C5ABn and Subchron C5Bn.1n (13.608–15.215 Ma). The intervals between Subchron C5r.2n and Chron C5ABn and between Chrons C5Bn and C6Cn (11.657–13.608 and 15.215– $23.030\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively) are calibrated by spline fitting marine magnetic anomaly profiles following Lourens et al. (2004) and Hilgen et al. (2012). We follow the chron terminology of Gradstein et al. (2012) and list several rarely observed polarity changes that were not formally classified as subchrons in the GTS2012 (Remarks column in Table T5). The shipboard age model for each site, based on paleomagnetic results and biostratigraphic datums, is presented in Chronostratigraphy in the Site U1532 chapter and Chronostratigraphy in the Site U1533 chapter (Wellner et al., 2021a, 2021b).

# Geochemistry and microbiology  

The shipboard geochemistry program for Expedition 379 included measurements for headspace gases (light hydrocarbons; $C_{1}-$ ${C}_{3})$ , interstitial water, and bulk sediment geochemical compositions. Samples for geomicrobiological analyses were collected on boar d and fixed for culture experiments and shore-based measurement s of metagenomics, intact polar lipids (IPLs), and cell counts.  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

# Sampling protocol  

The surface seawater used as drilling fluid was filtered throug h $0.20\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ polysulfone disposable filters from Whatman and collecte d in HCl-prewashed $24~\mathrm{mL}$ syringes. It was also distributed in HClprewashed plastic or glass bottles for shipboard and postcruis e analyses.  

The samples for interstitial water geochemistry were obtaine d according to two general procedures. Interstitial water samplin g varied with depth and started with a frequency of approximately three whole-round samples per core between 0 and $^{10\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ , two whole-round samples per core between 10 and $100\,\mathrm{~m~}_{\mathrm{a}}$ , and one whole-round sample per core below $100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ from cores obtaine d with the APC, HLAPC, and XCB systems. Where recovery was sufficient, one whole-round sample was taken every three RCB cores t o the bottom of each hole; samples were taken at greater spacin g when recovery was limited. The whole-round samples started wit h $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ lengths in the shallowest cores and increased with depth depending on interstitial water recovery, shipboard and shore-base d sample volume needs, and other expedition priorities.  

# Interstitial water collection  

For interstitial water analyses, whole-round samples were cut o n the catwalk, capped, and taken to the laboratory for processing. After extrusion from the core liner and under atmospheric condition s in the laboratory, the surface of each whole-round sample was carefully scraped with a spatula or ceramic knife to remove potential contamination from seawater and sediment smearing along the inside of the core liners. For APC cores, ${\sim}0.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ of material from th e outer diameter, top, and bottom faces was usually removed, wherea s in XCB and RCB cores, where borehole contamination may be mor e substantial, as much as two-thirds of the sediment was remove d from each whole-round section. The cleaned sediment $({\sim}150{-}300$ $\mathsf{c m}^{3},$ was placed into a $9~\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter titanium squeezer that wa s then placed in a Carver hydraulic press (Manheim and Sayles, 1974 ) and squeezed at pressures no higher than ${\sim}20{,}000$ lb $(\sim\!10\;\mathrm{MPa})$ t o prevent release of interlayer water from clay minerals durin g squeezing. The squeezed interstitial water was filtered through  a prewashed Whatman Number 1 filter placed in the squeezers abov e a titanium screen. The squeezed fluids were collected in an acidcleaned, 24 or $60\;\mathrm{mL}$ high-density polyethylene syringe attached t o the squeezing assembly and subsequently filtered through a $0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ polyethersulfone membrane disposable filter.  

Sample distribution was determined based on the recovered interstitial water volume and analytical priorities based on the objectives of the expedition. Priorities for the interstitial water sampl e distribution and analyses during Expedition 379 were in the following order:  

1. Salinity and Cl (shipboard),   
2. Anions and cations (shipboard),   
3. Major and trace element analyses (shipboard),   
4. $\delta\mathrm{D}/\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ isotopes (postcruise),   
5. pH and alkalinity (shipboard),   
6. Nutrients (shipboard),   
7. $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{DIC}}$ (postcruise), and   
8. Unconventional isotopes $(^{87}\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\mathrm{Sr},\mathrm{\mathrm{7Li}/^{6}\mathrm{Li}},\mathrm{\mathrm{~^{10}B/^{11}B}};$ ; postcruise).  

Data produced on the Agilent 5110 inductively coupled plasma– optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was collected in atomi c emission spectroscopy (AES) mode and is referred to as “ICP-AES ” in the LIMS/LORE database. Hereafter in this document, ICP-AE S is used to refer to this data.  

Aliquots for ICP-AES and unconventional isotope analyses wer e acidified by adding trace metal–grade concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ $\langle{\sim}10\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ per $1\,\mathrm{mL}$ sample), and samples for $\delta^{13}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{DIC}}$ analysis were treated wit h $30~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a saturated $\mathrm{{HgCl}_{2}}$ solution. Individual interstitial wate r samples were stored at refrigerator $({\sim}4^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ or freezer $(-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ temperatures. After interstitial water extraction was completed, sediment squeeze cakes were sealed in plastic bags for postcruis e analyses.  

# Shipboard interstitial water analyses  

Interstitial water samples were analyzed on board following the protocols in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation (http://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation), which were updated during this expedition.  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately afte r squeezing and following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinity was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handheld refractometer (Model S66366). pH was measured with  a combination glass electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gra n titration with a Metrohm 794 basic Titrino autotitrator using $_{0.1\,\mathrm{{N}}}$ HCl at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The International Association for the Physical Science s of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater was used for calibration. The IAPSO standard was analyzed at the beginning and end of a se t of samples for each site and after every 10 samples.  

# Chloride by titration  

High-precision chloride concentrations were acquired using  a Metrohm 785 DMP autotitrator and silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ ) solutions that were calibrated against repeated titrations of the IAPS O standard seawater $({\sim}559~\mathrm{mM})$ . A $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of sample dilute d with $30~\mathrm{mL}$ of $90\pm2\mathrm{\mM\HNO_{3}}$ and titrated with a $0.0153~\mathrm{N}$ Ag$\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ of the IAPSO standard seawater yielded a standard error o f $<\!0.2\%$ .  

Sulfate, chloride, bromide, sodium, magnesium, potassium, and calcium  

Sulfate, chloride, bromide, sodium, magnesium, potassium, an d calcium concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatograph y (Metrohm 850 Professional IC) using aliquots of $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ that wer e diluted 1:100 with deionized water $\left(18\,\mathrm{\:M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm}\right)$ . For anion $(\mathrm{Cl}^{-},$ $\mathrm{{SO}_{4}^{2-}}$ , and $\mathbf{B}\mathbf{r}^{-}$ ) analyses, a Metrosep C6 column ( $100\,\mathrm{\mm}$ long;  

$4\,\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter [ID]) was used with $3.2\;\mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ an d $1.0\:\mathrm{mM}$ $\mathrm{NaHCO_{3}}$ solutions used as eluents. For cation analyse s $(\mathrm{Na}^{+},\,\mathrm{K}^{+},\,\mathrm{Mg}^{2+};$ , and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ ), a Metrosep A supp 7 column ( $150~\mathrm{mm}$ long; $4\;\mathrm{mm}\;\mathrm{ID}]$ ) was used with $1.7~\mathrm{mM}$ of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and pyridine-2,6- dicarboxylic acid (PDCA) solutions as eluents. The standards use d were based on IAPSO dilutions of $50\times,\,67\times,\,1$ $100\times$ , $150\times$ , $200\times$ , an d $350\times$ . Reproducibility was checked based on the standard sampl e (IAPSO) dilution of $100\times$ run after every 10 sample. The reproducibility of chloride, sulfate, sodium, magnesium, and potassium wa s better than $1\%$ , whereas in the case of bromide and calcium it wa s better than $3\%$ . All concentrations were calculated based on comparison of peak areas of the analyzed components corresponding t o that of the respective standards.  

# Ammonium and phosphate  

Ammonium concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry using an Agilent Technologies Cary Series 100 UV-Vi s spectrophotometer with a sipper sample introduction system following the protocol of Gieskes et al. (1991). Samples were dilute d prior to color development so that the highest concentration was always below $1000~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . The solution was kept at room temperatur e for ${\sim}6.5~\mathrm{h}$ to develop color after adding the reagents. Ammoniu m concentrations were determined at an absorbance wavelength o f $640\;\mathrm{nm}$ . The reproducibility of the analysis was better than $2.0\%$ .  

Phosphate was measured using the ammonium molybdat e method described in Gieskes et al. (1991) and appropriate dilutions. The phosphate concentration was determined at an absorbance o f $885~\mathrm{nm}$ wavelength ${\sim}30$ min after adding the mixed reagent solution. The reproducibility was better than $2.0\%$ .  

# Major and minor elements  

Major and minor elements (Na, Ca, Mg, K, S, Li, B, Si, P, Ba, Fe , and Mn) were analyzed by an Agilent 5110 ICP-OES instrumen t with a SPS4 autosampler. The general method for shipboard ICPAES analysis of samples is described in ODP Technical Note 29 (Murray et al., 2000) and in the user manuals for shipboard instrumentation with modifications as indicated. Samples and standard s were diluted 1:10 in $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and spiked with an internal standar d to correct for atomic and ionic interferences. In detail, $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ o f spike solution containing $100\;\mathrm{ppm}$ Be, In, and Sc and $200\ \mathrm{ppm\Sb}$ was added to $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of interstitial water sample and $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . Each batch of samples analyzed on the ICP spectromete r contained blanks and solutions of known concentrations. Each ite m aspirated into the ICP spectrometer was counted three times fro m the same dilute solution in a given sample run. Following each instrument run, the measured raw-intensity values were transferre d to a data file and automatically corrected for instrument drift an d blank values by ICP Expert software (version 7.3.0.1.9507).  

Standardization of major cations $(\mathbf{Na}^{+},\,\mathbf{K}^{+},\,\mathbf{Mg}^{2+},$ and $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ ) wa s achieved by successive dilution of IAPSO standard seawater t o $200\%$ , $150\%$ , $100\%$ , $75\%$ , $50\%$ , $25\%$ , $10\%$ , $5\%$ , $1\%$ , and $0\%$ . Analytical reproducibility based on repeated analyses of the $100\%$ dilutio n standard over the two-month expedition was $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}<2.0\%$ , $M\mathrm{g}^{2+}\,<$ $2.5\%$ , $\mathrm{Na}^{+}\,<\,2.0\%$ , and $\mathrm{K^{+}}\,<\,2.0\%$ . Major cations were also determined by ion chromatography at 1:100 dilutions.  

For minor element concentration analyses (Li, B, Si, P, Ba, Fe , Mn, and Sr), matrix matching the standard solution with the interstitial water is necessary to achieve accurate results by ICP-AES.  A matrix solution that approximated IAPSO standard seawater majo r ion concentrations was prepared following the protocol of Murra y et al. (2000). A stock standard solution was prepared from ultrapur e primary standards (1000 ppm SPEX CertiPrep reference standards ) in a $2\%$ nitric acid solution. The stock solution was then diluted i n the same $2\%$ ultrapure nitric acid solution to concentrations o f $100\%$ , $75\%$ , $50\%$ , $25\%$ , $10\%$ , $5\%$ , and $0\%$ . For consistency, the calibration standards were then diluted using the same method as the samples. The $100\%$ standard was repeatedly analyzed with each batch o f samples over the two-month expedition as a check of analytical reproducibility. The average reproducibility of the minor and trace element (Li, B, Ba, Si, P, Fe, Mn, and Sr) analyses was better than $1\%$ .  

# Organic geochemistry  

# Headspace gas analysis  

Headspace gas analysis was conducted on sediment core material as part of the routine IODP shipboard hydrocarbon monitorin g program following the procedures described by Kvenvolden an d McDonald (1986). For this analysis, a $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ bulk sediment sampl e was collected from the freshly exposed top end of a core section an d adjacent to the interstitial water sample immediately after core retrieval using a brass boring tool. Each sediment plug was extrude d into a headspace vial, which was sealed with an aluminum crim p cap fitted with a polytetrafluoroethylene septum. The vials wer e then heated at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{min}$ to evolve hydrocarbon gases fro m the sediment plug. When consolidated or lithified samples were encountered, material equal to $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were placed in the headspac e vial, which was sealed and processed as outlined above.  

For the detection and quantification of light hydrocarbons, including methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethylene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , an d propylene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ , a $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ volume of headspace gas was extracte d from the sealed sample vial using a standard gas-tight syringe an d analyzed by an Agilent HP 6890 Series II gas chromatograp h equipped with an $8\ \mathrm{ft}\times2.00\ \mathrm{mm}\ \mathrm{ID}\times{}\%$ inch outer diameter (OD ) stainless steel column packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep R and  a flame ionization detector (FID). Helium was used as the carrier ga s at an initial flow in the column of $30~\mathrm{mL/min}$ . After $8.25\ \mathrm{min},$ , th e flow was increased to $60\;\mathrm{mL/min}$ to accelerate the elution of $C_{3}$ an d $C_{3=}$ . The FID was set to $250^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The gas chromatograph oven temperature was programmed to hold for $8.25\,\mathrm{\min}$ at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , ramp a t $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ to $150^{\circ}C,$ hold for $5\,\mathrm{\min}$ , and then return to $100^{\circ}C$ postrun for a total of $15~\mathrm{min}$ . Concentrations of hydrocarbons ar e reported in parts per million by volume (ppmv).  

# Sediment geochemistry  

Sediment samples (each $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ ) for the required shipboard geochemical analyses were collected from the working-half sections. Each sample was freeze-dried for ${\sim}12\ \mathrm{h}_{:}$ , crushed to a fine powde r using a solvent-cleaned agate pestle and mortar, and subsampled t o determine total carbon (TC), inorganic carbon (IC), total organi c carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total sulfur (TS) contents a s well as sedimentary TOC/TN ratios.  

# Elemental analysis  

TC, TN, and TS contents of the sediments were determine d with a ThermoElectron Corporation FlashEA 1112 CHNS elemental analyzer equipped with a ThermoElectron packed colum n CHNS/NCS. Approximately $25~\mathrm{mg}$ of freeze-dried, ground sediment was weighed into a tin cup, and the sample was combusted a t $950^{\circ}C$ in a stream of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ . The reaction gases were passed through  a reduction chamber to reduce nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and the n separated by gas chromatography before detection by a therma l conductivity detector. All measurements were calibrated to the Buffalo Mountain soil standard, a reference material for TC, TN, an d TS detection (Thermo), and calibrations were run every tenth sample for verification. Repeated $(N=\,43)$ ) analyses of the standar d yielded a reproducibility of ${<}0.04\mathrm{\wt\%}$ for TC, $<\!0.02\mathrm{\wt}\%$ for TN, and ${<}0.02\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ for TS. Sedimentary TOC/TN ratios were calculate d on an atomic basis.  

Inorganic and organic carbon content  

Ion chromatography concentrations were determined using  a UIC 5011 $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ coulometer. Approximately $25~\mathrm{mg}$ of freeze-dried , ground sediment was weighed and reacted with $2\,\mathrm{N}$ HCl. The liberated $C O_{2}$ was titrated, and the end point was determined by a photodetector. Calcium carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ content,  expressed  a s weight percent, was calculated from the IC content, assuming tha t all evolved $C O_{2}$ was derived from dissolution of $C a C O_{3},$ by usin g the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%)=\mathrm{IC}\times8.33\;(\mathrm{wt}\%).
$$  

No correction was made for the presence of other carbonat e minerals. Accuracy during individual batches of analyses was determined by running a $C a C O_{3}$ standard $(100\;\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{CaCO}_{3})$ every tent h sample. Reproducibility based on replicate analyses of the carbonat e standard was $0.8\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The TOC content was calculated as the difference between TC and IC:  

$$
\mathrm{TOC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%)=\mathrm{TC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%)\ –\ \mathrm{IC}\;(\mathrm{wt}\%).
$$  

# Microbiology  

# Microbiology sampling  

Microbiology sampling was carried out for shore-based IPL an d metagenomics analyses, cell counting, and culture experiments. Immediately after APC core retrieval and curation into single sections, samples were collected from the freshly exposed bottom end surfaces of centrally located core sections to minimize the risk of contamination by drilling fluids. For XCB and RCB cores, $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ lon g whole rounds were collected on the core receiving platform an d transferred to the chemistry laboratory for subsampling, as outline d above, in a cleanbench. Two $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ autoclaved cut-off syringes wer e used to collect sediments for metagenomics and culturing work. The sediment-filled syringes for the former analysis were transferred to sterile sample bags, sealed and immediately stored a t $-86^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Sediments for culture experiments were extruded in steril e $15~\mathrm{mL}$ Sarstedt tubes and kept refrigerated at $+4^{\circ}C$ . An additional autoclaved $5\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ cut-off syringe was used to collect a $2\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ plug o f sediment, which was transferred to a $15\,\mathrm{mL}$ Sarstedt tube filled wit h $7.5~\mathrm{mL}$ of filter-sterilized $(0.2\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ $2\%$ (v/v) formaldehyde in $2.7\%$ sodium chloride solution. The slurry was thoroughly vortexed t o ensure complete mixing and then stored at $+4^{\circ}C$ for optimal preservation of the fixed cells and later onshore cell counting. Samples fo r IPL analysis $(\sim\!5\mathrm{{-}}10\ \mathrm{cm^{3}})$ were scooped out of the central part o f split core sections or whole-round samples using a sterile spatula, wrapped in precombusted aluminum foil, and immediately store d in silver wine bags at $-86^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# Contamination testing  

The assessment of sediment core contamination by fluids (carrying microbial cells) used during drilling operations is critical t o confirm the suitability of cored material for microbiological analyses. To monitor the degree of contamination during coring, perfluorocarbon (PFC) tracers were introduced into the stream of drillin g fluid following well-established methodologies applied during previous IODP expeditions (Smith et al., 2000; Lever et al., 2006). Th e  

PFC tracer used at Site U1532 was perfluoromethylcyclohexan e (PMCH), which was injected into the drilling fluid using a high-performance liquid chromatography pump at a constant concentratio n of $1\ \mathrm{mg/mL}$ (the maximum solubility of PMCH in water). PMC H was also used in Holes U1533A, U1533C, and U1533D. No tracer s were used during APC coring in Hole U1533B. With the start o f HLAPC coring at $187~\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1533B, PMCH was replaced b y perfluoromethyldecalin (PFMD), which was introduced at the sam e concentration as PMCH and continuously injected into the drillin g fluid for the remainder of the coring operations at Site U1533, including both XCB and RCB coring.  

To monitor and quantify intrusion of drilling fluids into core s (and thus potential contamination), two $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sediment sample s were taken using sterile cut-off syringes, one in close proximity t o the core liner, where contamination was expected to be highest, an d another one in the center of the core. These samples were taken either in the core retrieving area or immediately after the $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ wholeround samples were transferred to the chemistry laboratory. The y were taken from each core obtained during the first ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ of AP C coring, which usually shows no or only minor sample contamination, and continuously for every second to third core during XC B and RCB drilling operations. Each time, the tracer samples were collected at the top of the section located closest to the microbiolog y samples or on the same sediments in the case of whole-round sampling. For quality control, samples of both the drilling fluid an d drilling mud amended with tracer were also collected at regular intervals throughout the drilling process. All PFC samples were immediately placed into $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ headspace vials containing $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ MilliQ water and stored upside down at $+4^{\circ}C$ for later analysis on boar d using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to an electro n capture detector. The analytical protocol followed the technica l specifications outlined by Smith et al. (2000) but included an additional preincubation step $\,\cdot\,2\,\mathrm{h}$ at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{.}$ ) of the tracer samples prio r to measurement to ensure full PFC recovery from sediments, as wa s done during other IODP expeditions (Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Andrén et al., 2015). PFC tracer analysis was carried out a s soon as possible and no later than 3 to 4 days after sample collection. Absolute abundances of tracers were calculated using fivepoint calibrations of different tracer concentrations.  

# Physical properties  

During Expedition 379, physical property measurements wer e made to aid lithostratigraphic characterization and to tie core descriptions to borehole data and seismic profiles. Physical propert y data were crucial for tasks such as correlating hole-to-hole and siteto-site stratigraphy, detecting discontinuities and inhomogeneities, obtaining information about differences in the composition an d texture of sediment, identifying major seismic reflectors, and constructing synthetic seismic traces. A variety of techniques an d methods were used to characterize Expedition 379 cores on wholeround, section-half, and discrete samples.  

# General sampling and measurement sequence  

Procedures for measuring soft sediments versus harder, mor e lithified sediments differ slightly and are explained for individua l property methods below. Prior to measurement, whole-round cor e sections were equilibrated to ambient room pressure and temperature $({\sim}19^{\circ}{-}22^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ for $4\,\mathrm{h}$ to ensure thermal and barometric homogeneity to minimize any effects on physical property measurement s and to protect sensors from damage.  

Prior to splitting, whole-round sections were analyzed wit h three whole-round physical properties core-logging systems: th e WRMSL, the NGRL, and the thermal conductivity logger (for sof t sediments). Previous IODP expeditions have also used the Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL), but for Expedition 379 this trac k was replaced with a new onboard whole-round X-ray imaging system (see Lithostratigraphy). The WRMSL incorporates a GR A bulk densitometer, a magnetic susceptibility loop sensor, and a compressional PWL. For the WRMSL, all whole-round sections from all holes were measured at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolution. The PWL requires consistent and unbroken contact between sediments and core liner t o make accurate measurements. This is generally the case for the AP C system; however, cores recovered from the XCB or RCB system s typically consist of a gap between recovered material and the cor e liner, leading to measurements outside the accepted velocity rang e $1000{-}4500\;\mathrm{m/s})$ ). Thus, the PWL was not utilized for any measurements on cores recovered using the XCB or RCB systems. Followin g measurements on the WRMSL, all whole-round sections from all holes were run on the NGRL to collect spectral gamma ray data at  a $10~\mathrm{{cm}}$ interval. Following measurements on the NGRL, thermal conductivity was measured on one section per core. For soft sediments, a needle probe was inserted into the section through a small hole drilled along the split line near the center of the section. Fo r lithified sediments, a contact probe was used on the working hal f (see Thermal conductivity measurements).  

After whole-round measurements were completed, core sections were split longitudinally; one half was designated as an archiv e section and the other as a working section for sampling. Archiv e halves were measured with the SHMSL at $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ resolution using  a Bartington probe for magnetic susceptibility and an Ocean Optic s spectrophotometer for color reflectance and colorimetry. From th e working halves of soft sediments, $P$ -wave velocity measurement s were made at a resolution of approximately three $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -caliper contac t probe measurements per core, along with one measurement fro m each of the $y_{-}$ and $z$ -axis bayonets per core, on the SHMG. Discret e samples were also taken for MAD measurements (approximatel y three per core) to quantify wet and dry masses, wet and dry bul k densities, water content, porosity, and grain density using th e MADMax software.  

Full descriptions of methodologies and calculations can b e found in Blum (1997) as well as shipboard user guides available online. An overview of the sampling strategies for Expedition 37 9 physical properties can be found in Table T6, and any variability i n sampling schemes are noted in individual sections below along wit h detailed methods for each property measurement.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

The WRMSL (Figure F17) is a logging system for physical properties that is used for automatically conveying and positionin g whole-round cores to record the following distinct measurement s in each core section (see also Blum, 1997):  

• GRA densitometry,   
• Magnetic susceptibility logging (with the magnetic susceptibility loop [MSL]), and   
• Compressional $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity logging (with the PWL).  

During Expedition 379, GRA bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P.$ -wave velocity were measured nondestructively with th e WRMSL for each whole-round section. To optimize and streamlin e measurement procedures on the WRMSL and to better match othe r instrument measurement settings within the core processing line,

sampling intervals (centimeters) and periods (seconds) were synchronized across all measurement sensors. For optimized sampling, it is critical that parameter settings are such that intervals and periods are multiples of each other. This ensures that the idle time o f sensors is minimized and that the data quantity and quality ar e maximized for a given total core section scan period. When selecting sampling intervals, consideration was also given to the thicknes s interval that each sensor can resolve. Here, to achieve high-resolution measurements over the longest practical sampling period tha t would not negatively impact the overall flow of the core processin g line, sampling intervals were set at $2.0\;\mathrm{cm}$ for each instrument measurement. Following the measurement of each final core section,  a deionized water standard was run through the WRMSL to keep th e instruments calibrated and to maintain quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). All instruments were recalibrated if thei r measured standard values were outside the range of published tolerances (Blum, 1997).  

# Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

Figure F17. WRMSL. The water standard measured at the end of each core i s for QA/QC purposes.  

GRA bulk density is an overall measurement of density take n through a whole-round core at discrete intervals and the first measurement made on the WRMSL (Figure F17). This bulk densit y measurement relates to the physical properties of a formation suc h as porosity, grain size, consolidation state, mineral composition, and other disturbances or contrast. Here, the GRA instrument estimates bulk density through the measure of attenuation of a directe d gamma ray beam through the core. The beam is produced by a $^{137}\!C\mathbf{s}$ gamma ray source at radiation and energy levels of $370\ \mathrm{MBq}$ an d $660\mathrm{~KeV},$ respectively. The source is mounted within a lead shiel d with a $5~\mathrm{mm}$ collimator directly above the whole-round core trac k such that the beam is directed downward through each core sectio n during measurement. A scintillation detector with an integrate d photomultiplier tube is mounted underneath the core track (an d opposite the $^{137}\!C\mathbf{s}$ source) and measures the gamma radiation tha t passes through the core sections as they advance on the track. Th e principle behind the measurement of GRA bulk density is that medium-energy gamma rays $(0.1{-}1\;\mathrm{MeV})$ interact with the material o f a formation mainly by Compton scattering and that the measure d electron density of that scattering can be inverted to a material bul k density. For a known thickness of sample, the density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of the attenuated gamma rays and can be expressed as  

![](images/e4a9438150050ebc03d8d08c08033d7a4631eab7f7a6b4475ba0e52bd47ba634.jpg)  

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I/I_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$I=$ the measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

The $\upmu$ and $I_{0}$ are treated as constants, such that $\uprho$ can be calculate d from $I_{\star}$ .  

GRA bulk density measurements are most accurate when mad e on a completely filled core liner with minimal drilling disturbanc e or discontinuities. When cores do not completely fill the core line r or are disturbed, measurements tend to underestimate true values. By default, the GRA instrument reports all measurements assumin g that the sample diameter matches the internal diameter of the cor e liner $\left(66\mathrm{\mm}\right)$ ). This assumption is appropriate for most sedimen t cores obtained by the APC; however, for sediment cored by the XC B or RCB systems, core diameter is usually only $58~\mathrm{mm}$ (or less). N o correction for sample diameter has been applied for XCB and RC B core GRA measurements, so GRA bulk densities for these interval s are underestimated compared to true values. The spatial resolutio n of the GRA densitometer is less than $\pm1\,\mathrm{cm}$ , and it is calibrated wit h specific sealed calibration cores (one standard core liner filled wit h distilled water and aluminum cylinders of various diameters; se e also Blum, 1997). Recalibration was performed as needed when th e deionized water QA/QC standard deviated significantly $(>\!2\%)$ fro m $1~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ . As previously noted, to maintain synchronized samplin g across the WRMSL instruments, the sampling interval for the GR A densiometer was set at $2.0~\mathrm{cm}$ with an integration time of $_{3\textbf{s}}$ . All collected GRA bulk density data were postprocessed for edge effects by “clipping” the first and last $4~\mathrm{{cm}}$ of each section. Singlepoint outliers caused by drilling artifacts (e.g., voids, cracked cor e liners, or metal drill fragments) and any values ${<}1~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ were als o removed.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility was measured on each whole-roun d core section using a pass-through loop on the WRMSL immediatel y following the GRA bulk density measurement (Figure F17). Magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree t o which a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic fiel d and is generally used as a relative proxy indicator for changes i n composition, which can also be linked to paleoclimate-controlle d depositional processes. Because magnetic susceptibility is measured at very low magnetic fields generally not exceeding $400\;\mathrm{A/m},$ it is also often referred to as “low-field” susceptibility. If the ratio o f the magnetization is expressed per unit volume, volume susceptibility is defined as  

# Compressional P-wave velocity  

Compressional $P$ -wave velocity was measured on each wholeround section using the PWL instrument on the WRMSL, immediately following the magnetic susceptibility measurement (Figur e F17). $P$ -wave velocity varies with the lithology, porosity, and bul k density of the measured material. In addition, the velocity can als o be affected by the state of stress, lithostatic pressure, and/or fabri c or degree of fracturing within the material. Velocity values are als o controlled by the degree of consolidation and lithification or occurrence and abundance of free gas. Together with measurements o f density, a $P$ -wave sonic velocity can be used to calculate acousti c impedance, and with that, reflection coefficients. These calculations can then be used to derive synthetic seismograms to help estimate the depth of reflectors observed in seismic profiles. $P$ -wav e velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is defined by the time required for a compressional wave to travel a specific distance,  

$$
\mathrm{\boldmath~\cal~X~}\!=\!M/H,
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an externa l field of strength $H.$ . Magnetic susceptibility is most sensitive to formations containing a high concentration of ferromagnetic mineral s (e.g., magnetite, hematite, and various other iron oxides). In addition, it is also sensitive to magnetic mineralogy and can be related t o the origin of the materials in the core and their subsequent diagenesis. Ferromagnetic minerals typically have magnetic susceptibilit y values several orders of magnitude greater than their alteratio n products, such as clay. Diamagnetic minerals such as calcite, halite, or kaolinite, as well as water and plastic (core liner), have small o r negative magnetic susceptibility values. Therefore, calcareous an d siliceous biogenic deposits with very small amounts of clay an d iron-bearing minerals often have values approaching the detectio n limit of the magnetic susceptibility instrument sensor.  

All measurements were made using a Bartington MS2C loo p sensor with a $90\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter. On the WRMSL, an oscillator circuit in the sensor operates at a frequency of $565~\mathrm{Hz}$ to avoid an y potential interference between instruments (with an automati c software correction factor of 1.174), and a ${\sim}140\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ AF produce s a low-intensity, nonsaturating alternating magnetic field. Sediment sections going through the influence of this field cause  a change in oscillator frequency. Frequency information is returne d in pulse form to the susceptometer and converted into a magneti c susceptibility value. The loop sensor has a spatial resolution of 2 0 mm and a published accuracy of $2\%$ (see also Blum, 1997). Th e output of the magnetic susceptibility sensors is set to dimensionless instrument units (IU), which are equivalent to $10^{-5}~\mathrm{SI}$ units. All returned values represent the mean of three discrete measurements. Magnetic susceptibility values reported in the text and figures of site reports will be in $10^{-5}\:\mathrm{SI}$ units unless otherwise noted. The magnetic susceptibility instrument was automatically zeroe d at the beginning of each run before the core entered the measurement loop. Also, instrument drift can occur during the period of  a core section scan, so to correct for this drift, a zero-backgroun d measurement was taken at the end of a core section scan. As previously noted, to maintain synchronized sampling across th e WRMSL instruments, the sampling interval for magnetic susceptibility was set at $2.0\;\mathrm{cm}$ . All collected magnetic susceptibility dat a were postprocessed for edge effects by “clipping” the first and las t $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ of each section. Single-point outliers caused by drilling artifacts (e.g., voids, cracked core liners, or metal drill fragments ) were also removed.  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is th e traveltime through the core.  

During measurement by the PWL, the core section travels between two piezoelectric transducers mounted in stainless steel housings (a transmitter and a receiver). Acoustic coupling throug h an epoxy resin surface is enhanced by a water film supplied by a n automated drip system. A $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ pulse $2\:\upmu\mathrm{s}$ wave period; $120\;\mathrm{V}]$ ) is produced at a repetition rate of $1\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and sent to the transmitte r transducer, which then generates an ultrasonic compressional puls e at about $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ (pulse timing is measured with a resolution of 5 0 ns). Pressure is applied to the actuators to ensure coupling betwee n the transducers and the core liner, and the automated drip syste m maintains wet contacts on the transducers to ensure a reliable coupling is always established. The compressional $P$ -wave then propagates horizontally through the core, is received by the receive r transducer on the opposite side, and is then amplified by an automatic gain control amplifier to produce the received signal. $P$ -wav e velocity transducers measure total traveltime of the compressional wave between transducers. A calibration of the PWL accounts fo r errors in the total distance $(d_{\mathrm{total}})$ and the total traveltime $\left(t_{\mathrm{total}}\right)$ . Errors on $d_{\mathrm{total}}$ were assumed to come from the laser distance. The reported value represents the average of 100 discrete measurement s at the set interval.  

During measurement, a core liner of assumed thickness (L) surrounded each core section. The traveltime through the liner $\left(t_{\mathrm{liner}}\right)$ was determined by measuring the total traveltime through a cor e liner filled with distilled water of known velocity $({\sim}1480~\mathrm{m/s})$ .  A correction $\boldsymbol{\lambda}_{\mathrm{delay}}^{\mathrm{~\,~}}\,$ system delay) was measured using the traveltim e through a standard block of aluminum with a known thickness an d a published velocity of $6295\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Arrival time picks were chosen a t the inflection point of the second lobe of the waveform, giving a second correction $(t_{\mathrm{pulse}})$ from the first arrival. During Expedition 379, $t_{\mathrm{pulse}}$ and $t_{\mathrm{delay}}$ were combined and represented simply as ttotaldelay. Therefore, the velocity of the core is  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{total}}-2\mathrm{L})/(t_{\mathrm{total}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}-t_{\mathrm{totaldelay}}),
$$  

where  

$V_{\mathrm{p}}=$ velocity of the core $(\mathrm{km}/\mathbf{s})$ , $d_{\mathrm{total}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner $(\mathrm{mm})$ , $\mathrm{L}=$ liner wall thickness (mm),  

$t_{\mathrm{total}}=$ total measured traveltime for pulse to travel through core and liner (μs),   
$t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ traveltime through liner (μs), and   
$t_{\mathrm{totaldelay}}=$ delay related to combined transducer faces, electronic circuitry, and peak detection procedures (μs).  

The above equation assumes that the core completely fills th e core liner. The WRMSL PWL was turned off for cores recovere d with the XCB or RCB systems, which generally do not completel y fill the core liner. Any measured $P$ -wave signal can degenerate du e to an incompletely filled core liner, any voids that are present, or attenuation caused by microcracks that formed during core recovery. This degeneration is partly reflected by the gain (signal strength ) factor applied to the original signal by the automated gain control. However, signal strength also represents the grain size of the sediment, and low-strength signals can therefore not simply be interpreted as proportional to attenuation. As previously noted, t o maintain synchronized sampling across the WRMSL instruments, the sampling interval for the PWL was set at $2.0\,\mathrm{cm}$ .  

# Natural Gamma Radiation Logger measurements  

The NGRL measures the cumulative radiation emitted durin g natural decay of three long-lived radioisotopes: $^{40}\mathrm{K},\,^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ (which have half-lives of $1.3\times10^{9}$ , $1.4\times10^{10}$ , and $4.4\times10^{9}\,\mathrm{;}$ y, respectively). These isotopes adsorb to mainly clay minerals and are th e primary source of the NGR in sediments or sedimentary rocks measured by the NGRL (Blum, 1997). Thus, high counts generally reflect the presence of fine-grained deposits, and relative changes ar e indicative of stratigraphic details and aid in core-to-core, core-towireline log data, and/or borehole correlations between holes.  

The NGRL measures NGR on whole-round cores using a syste m described by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program US Implementing  Organization  (USIO)  (Texas  A&M  University,  USA; Vasiliev et al., 2011; Dunlea et al., 2013) (Figure F18). The syste m consists of eight sodium iodide (NaI) detectors arranged along th e core measurement axis at $20~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals surrounding the lowe r half of the section (Figure F18B). The detector array is fitted wit h both passive (layers of lead) and active (plastic scintillators) shielding to reduce the background environmental and cosmic radiation. The overlying plastic scintillators detect incoming high-energ y gamma and muon cosmic radiation and cancel this signal from th e total counted by the NaI detectors.  

Quality of the measured energy spectrum in a core depends no t only on the concentration of radionuclides but also the countin g time. For optimization, a measurement run began with two sampl e positions $10~\mathrm{cm}$ apart and a counting period of $300{\mathrm{~s~}}$ . After $300~\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , the position was advanced downcore by $10~\mathrm{cm}$ and counted agai n for $300{\mathrm{~s~}}$ . A run yielded a total of 16 measurements $\mathrm{[0\cm}$ apart ) per $150\,\mathrm{cm}$ core section. Measurement times were ${\sim}5\;\mathrm{min}$ per measurement cycle or ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{\min}$ per core section. This measuremen t scheme yielded statistically significant total counts. All collecte d NGR data were postprocessed for edge effects by clipping the firs t and last ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm}$ of each section to remove artifacts caused by th e processing software. Single-point outliers caused by drilling artifacts (e.g., voids or cracked core liners) were also removed.  

# Thermal conductivity measurements  

The coefficient of thermal conductivity represents the rate a t which heat flows through a material, which is dependent on th e chemical composition, porosity, density, structure, and fabric of th e material (Blum, 1997). Thermal conductivity profiles of sedimen t

and rock sections, along with in situ temperature measurements, are used to determine geothermal heat flow. Geothermal heat flo w is an indicator of type and age of ocean crust, fluid circulation processes from various depths, and young magmatic and tectonic processes of continental crust (Dziadek et al., 2019).  

After NGR measurements were completed, thermal conductivity was measured on one section per core with the TK04 (Tek a Bolin) system (Table T6). A needle-probe method in full-space configuration for whole-round cores was used for soft sediments (Vo n Herzen and Maxwell, 1959), and a contact probe method in halfspace configuration was used on split cores for harder, more lithified sediments. The probes each contain a heater wire and calibrated  thermistor.  For  soft sediments,  the  needle probe wa s inserted into $\phantom{+}2\,\mathrm{mm}$ diameter hole drilled through the liner along  a split-line. To avoid interference from airflow in the laboratory, th e core was placed in an enclosed box outfitted with insulating foa m (Figure F19). For harder or lithified sediments, half sections displaying the least amount of fracturing and most homogeneous portion s of core were chosen for measurement. The sections were prepare d for a puck-style contact probe by applying a small amount of deionized water onto the sediment surface and then gently wiping it wit h a sponge. This ensured proper contact between sediment and th e probe. The puck probe was placed directly on the sediments and secured in place with a strap to ensure proper contact pressure. Th e entire section half was then placed in the insulated box to stabiliz e thermal conditions during measurements.  

Figure F19. Shipboard station for measuring thermal conductivity on wholeround and section-half cores.

The calibrated heat source of the probe was then turned on, an d the increase in temperature was recorded over $^{80\mathrm{~s~}}$ for the needl e probe (soft sediments) and $60\;{\mathsf{s}}$ for the contact probe (hard or lithified sediments). A heating power of $0.8{-}2.5\ \mathrm{W/m}$ was typicall y used in soft sediments, and $0.5{-}2.5\;\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}$ was used for lithified material. The solution to the heat conduction equation with a lin e source of heat was then fit to the temperature measurements to obtain the thermal conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductive than sediment or hard rock, the probe is assumed to be  a perfect conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of th e superconductive probe has a linear relationship with the natura l logarithm of the time after the initiation of the heat:  

![](images/e5f7376af9803899171bf2e4f5546feede2986a3a68d79ca7c8d60b5ddedc31d.jpg)  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},

# where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\mathbf{\left(J/m/s\right)}$ ), $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (s), and   
$C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three measuring cycles were automatically performed to calculate average conductivity. A self-test, which included a drift study, was conducted at the beginning of each measurement cycle. Onc e the probe temperature stabilized, the heater circuit was closed an d the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity was calculated from the rate of temperature rise while the heate r current was flowing. Temperatures measured during the first $80\,{\sf s}$ o f the needle probe heating cycle and $60\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ of the contact probe heatin g cycle were fit to an approximate solution of a constantly heated lin e source (for details, see Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Measurement errors were $5\%{-}10\%$ .  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

Color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility were measured o n the archive-half cores using the SHMSL (Figure F20). Archive-hal f cores were covered with plastic wrap and placed on the SHMS L core track, above which an electronic platform moves along a trac k and records the height of the core surface. The laser sensor detect s the location of the surface of the archive-half core, and then the instrument progresses along the core making measurements of MSP and color reflectance. During Expedition 379, color reflectance an d MSP data were collected at 2 cm spacing.  

# Color reflectance spectrometry  

The color reflectance spectrometry of the archive-half cores wa s measured using an Ocean Optics QE Pro detector integratin g sphere and associated light sources covering wavelengths from U V through visible to near infrared. Each measurement was taken in  2 nm wide spectral bands from 390 to $732\,\mathrm{nm}$ . The data are reporte d using the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{b}^{\ast}$ color system, where $L^{\ast}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is rednes s (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative). The color reflectance spectromete r calibrates using two spectra, pure white (reference) and pure blac k (dark). Color calibration was conducted approximately once every  6 h (twice per shift). Additional details regarding measurement an d interpretation of spectral data can be found in Balsam et al. (1997), Balsam and Damuth (2000), and Giosan et al. (2002).  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

MSP was measured with a Bartington MS2 meter and an MS2 K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter round sensor with a fiel d of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and an operation frequency of $930\;\mathrm{Hz}$ . Th e instrument averages three measurements from the sensor for eac h offset with an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . The spatial resolution of the MSP sensor is ${\sim}3.8\,\mathrm{\mm}_{}$ , and values are reported in instrument unit s (which can also be converted to approximate dimensionless SI unit s by multiplying by $10^{-5}$ ). The MSP meter was calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on JOIDES Resolution and is qualit y checked every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ at the same time as color reflectance sensor calibration.

$P$ -wave velocity measurements were performed on working-hal f cores using the SHMG. Measurements were typically made with th e $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -caliper on every other section of each core. Bayonet measurements in the $y$ and $z$ orientations were taken once per core, typicall y in Section 6 (Table T6). The bayonet measurements were discontinued when good contact in brittle sediments was no longer possible. $X$ -caliper measurements were increased to once per section fo r XCB and RCB cores when the PWL on the WRMSL was not able t o provide accurate velocity measurements. Measurements were take n at varying section intervals to accommodate lithologic variations, drilling disturbance, fractures, larger clasts, and general core quality.  

# P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocities on working-half cores were measured wit h the $P$ -wave caliper (PWC) and the $P_{-}$ -wave bayonets (PWBs). Th e PWC measures the $P$ -wave velocity vertically to the sectional plan e of the core ( $\boldsymbol{x}$ -axis), whereas the PWBs measure the cross-sectio n $y$ -axis) and the long axis $\overrightharpoon{z}$ -axis) of the core (Figure F21). The system uses Panametrics-NDT Microscan delay line transducers tha t transmit at $500~\mathrm{KHz}$ . During measurement, the signal transmitte d through the core was recorded by the attached computer system, and the peak ( $P$ -wave arrival) was chosen via an automated algorithm in the processing software. In cases of a weak signal, the instrument operator manually picked the first arrival. The distanc e between transducers was measured with a built-in linear voltag e displacement transformer (LVDT). Calibration was performe d with an aluminum standard with a known thickness and a published velocity of $6295\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ that matches the compressional $P_{\|}$ -wav e measurements on the WRMSL. The determined system time dela y from calibration was subtracted from the picked arrival time t o give a traveltime of the $P$ -wave through the sample. The thicknes s of the sample (calculated by LVDT in meters) was divided by th e traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P$ -wave velocity in meters pe r second.

# Moisture and density measurements  

MAD measurements were collected on discrete samples fro m working halves to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, and porosity. In soft sediments, ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample s were collected with a plastic syringe. Approximately three sample s were collected from each core, typically from Sections 1, 3, and 5 a t an offset of ${\sim}75\,\mathrm{cm}$ . In some cases, samples were moved to adjacen t sections within cores to avoid disturbed sediments or avoid/targe t particular features in the core. In more lithified sediments, sample s were taken adjacent to the samples that were cut and prepared fo r paleomagnetic measurements.  

Sediment samples were placed in numbered, preweighed ${\sim}16$ mL Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment weighing, drying, and dry volume measurements. Wet sample mass was first measured on each vial before placing it in a convection oven for approximately $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm\,5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to dry. Once dried, samples were the n cooled in a desiccator for at least $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ before dry mass and volum e were measured. The weights of wet and dry sample masses were determined to a precision of $0.005\mathrm{~g~}$ using two Mettler Toledo electronic balances, with one balance acting as a reference (Figur e F22A). A standard weight of similar value to the sample was place d upon the reference balance to increase accuracy. A computer averaging algorithm was used to compensate for the motion of the ship. The default measurement setting of the two balances was 300 measurements over an interval of ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{min}$ .  

![](images/85bc34418c4ee7b0fa3d7f10982667c2227e90f14da2cef01063be6533bb3848.jpg)  

Dry sample volume was determined using a six-celled, customconfigured Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer (hexapycnometer) (Figure F22B). The precision of each cell is $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. Volume measurements are preceded by three purges of the sample chamber with helium warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run for each sample. A reference volume (set of two calibration spheres) was periodically placed in each chamber to check for instrument drift and systematic error. The volumes occupied by the numbered Wheaton vials were calculated before the expedition by multiplying the weight of each vial against the average density of the vial glass. The procedures for the determination of these physical properties comply with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) designation (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 2019). The fundamental relation and assumptions for the calculations of all physical property parameters are discussed by Blum (1997) and summarized below. MAD properties reported and displayed in Physical properties in the Site U1532 chapter and Physical properties in the Site U1533 chapter (Wellner et al., 2021a, 2021b) were calculated using the MADMax software.  

# Mass and volume calculation  

Wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ were measured in the laboratory. The ratio of mass $\left(\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ is a computational constant of 0.965 (i.e., $0.965\:\mathrm{g}$ of freshwater per $1\,\mathrm{g}$ of seawater). Salt precipitated in sediment pores during the drying process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ in the sample are given by  

Assuming a pore water density of $1.024\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , the volume of the pore water is calculated as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=(V_{\mathrm{t}}-V_{\mathrm{dry}})\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Finally, the mass of the pore water is calculated as  

$$
M_{\mathrm{pw}}=V_{\mathrm{pw}}\times\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

# Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as the ratio of mass of pore water to wet sediment (total) mass:  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grain density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio $(V R)$ are calculated as  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ {\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{dry}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ {\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ {\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ {\Phi=V_{\mathrm{pe}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},\,\mathrm{and}}\\ {V R=V_{\mathrm{pe}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{water}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}\;\mathrm{and}}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[s/(1-\mathrm{s})],}\end{array}
$$  

respectively, where s is the assumed saltwater salinity $(0.035\%)$ corresponding to a pore water density $(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ of $1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (from experimental and empirical relations between salinity and density at laboratory conditions; Blum, 1997) and a salt density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ of $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of pore water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of salt $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\mathrm{~\bigcup_{solid}^{\prime}})$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are, respectively,  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{r_{m}},}\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{ww}}},\ \ }\\ {M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},}\\ {M_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),}\\ {V_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{solit}}/\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{salit}}},}\end{array}
$$  

# Downhole formation temperature measurements  

In situ temperature measurements were made with the APCT-3 (Heesemann et al., 2006) in Holes U1532A and U1532B. The APCT3 fits directly into the APC coring shoe and consists of a battery pack, a data logger, and a platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over a temperature range from $0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}\mathbf{C}.$ . Before entering the borehole, the tool is first stopped at the mudline for $5~\mathrm{min}$ to thermally equilibrate with bottom water. When the APCT-3 moves into the formation, frictional heating causes an instantaneous temperature rise. This heat gradually dissipates into the surrounding sediment as the APCT-3 equilibrates to the temperature of the sediment. Thus, after the APCT-3 enters the formation, it is held in place for ${\sim}10$ min while the APCT-3 records the temperature of the cutting shoe every 1 s.  

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment is estimated by applying a mathematical heat-conduction model to the temperature decay record (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The synthetic thermal decay curve for the APCT-3 is a function of the geometry and thermal properties of the probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). Equilibrium temperature is estimated by applying a fitting procedure (Pribnow et al., 2000). However, if the APC system does not achieve a full stroke or if the ship has pulled the APC up from full penetration, the temperature equilibration curve is disturbed and the temperature determination is less accurate. The nominal accuracy of the APCT-3 temperature measurements is $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Wet (or total) volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{t}}\right)$ , dry mass $\mathbf{\Gamma}(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ were measured in the laboratory. Total mass, including freshwater in the pores, is calculated using a water density of $1\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ by  

$$
M_{\mathrm{t}}=M_{\mathrm{dry}}+\left(V_{\mathrm{t}}-V_{\mathrm{dry}}\right)\times\uprho_{\mathrm{w}}.
$$  

APCT-3 temperature data were combined with measurements of thermal conductivity (see Thermal conductivity measurements) collected from whole-round core sections to obtain heat flow values. Heat flow is calculated according to the Bullard method to be consistent with the synthesis of ODP heat flow data by Pribnow et al. (2000).
