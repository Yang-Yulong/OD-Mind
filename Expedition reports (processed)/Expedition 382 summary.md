# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 382, Iceberg Alley and Subantarctic Ice and Ocean Dynamics, investigated the long-term climate history of Antarctica, seeking to understand how polar ice sheets responded to changes in insolation and atmospheric $C O_{2}$ in the past and how ice sheet evolution influenced global sea level and vice versa. Five sites (U1534–U1538) were drilled east of the Drake Passage: two sites at $53.2^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ at the northern edge of the Scotia Sea and three sites at $57.4^{\circ}{-}59.4^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ in the southern Scotia Sea. We recovered continuously deposited late Neogene sediments to reconstruct the past history and variability in Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) mass loss and associated changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation.  

The sites from the southern Scotia Sea (Sites U1536–U1538) will be used to study the Neogene flux of icebergs through “Iceberg Alley,” the main pathway along which icebergs calved from the margin of the AIS travel as they move equatorward into the warmer waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). In particular, sediments from this area will allow us to assess the magnitude of iceberg flux during key times of AIS evolution, including the following:  

• The middle Miocene glacial intensification of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet,   
• The mid-Pliocene warm period,   
• The late Pliocene glacial expansion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,  

• The mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT), and • The “warm interglacials” and glacial terminations of the last 800 ky.  

We will use the geochemical provenance of iceberg-rafted detritus and other glacially eroded material to determine regional sources of AIS mass loss. We will also address interhemispheric phasing of ice sheet growth and decay, study the distribution and history of land-based versus marine-based ice sheets around the continent over time, and explore the links between AIS variability and global sea level.  

By comparing north–south variations across the Scotia Sea between the Pirie Basin (Site U1538) and the Dove Basin (Sites U1536 and U1537), Expedition 382 will also deliver critical information on how climate changes in the Southern Ocean affect ocean circulation through the Drake Passage, meridional overturning in the region, water mass production, ocean–atmosphere $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ transfer by windinduced upwelling, sea ice variability, bottom water outflow from the Weddell Sea, Antarctic weathering inputs, and changes in oceanic and atmospheric fronts in the vicinity of the ACC.  

Comparing changes in dust proxy records between the Scotia Sea and Antarctic ice cores will also provide a detailed reconstruction of changes in the Southern Hemisphere westerlies on millennial and orbital timescales for the last $800~\mathrm{ky}$ Extending the ocean dust record beyond the last $800\,\mathrm{ky}$ will help to evaluate dust-climate couplings since the Pliocene, the potential role of dust in iron fertilization and atmospheric $C O_{2}$ drawdown during  glacials, and whether dust input to Antarctica played a role in the MPT.  

The principal scientific objective of Subantarctic Front Site s U1534 and U1535 at the northern limit of the Scotia Sea is to reconstruct and understand how intermediate water formation in th e southwest Atlantic responds to changes in connectivity between th e Atlantic and Pacific basins, the “cold water route.” The Subantarcti c Front contourite drift, deposited between 400 and $2000\,\mathrm{~m~}$ wate r depth on the northern flank of an east–west trending trough off th e Chilean continental shelf, is ideally situated to monitor millennial - to orbital-scale variability in the export of Antarctic Intermediat e Water beneath the Subantarctic Front. During Expedition 382, w e recovered continuously deposited sediments from this drift spanning the late Pleistocene (from ${\sim}0.78\ \mathrm{Ma}$ to recent) and from th e late Pliocene $({\sim}3.1{-}2.6\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ). These sites are expected to yield a wid e array of paleoceanographic records that can be used to interpre t past changes in the density structure of the Atlantic sector of th e Southern Ocean, track migrations of the Subantarctic Front, an d give insights into the role and evolution of the cold water route ove r significant climate episodes, including the following:  

• The most recent warm interglacials of the late Pleistocene and • The intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation.  

# Introduction  

Several decades of research on the paleoceanography and paleoclimatology of the Scotia Sea using short cores and remote-sensin g data have revealed a wealth of information on late Pleistocene ic e sheet–ocean climate interactions. However, only deep drilling wil l enable us to understand the evolution and sensitivity of these interactions over longer timescales, in particular during periods o f Earth’s history that were significantly warmer and characterized b y higher sea levels than today. Drilling deep sites in the Pirie and Dov e Basins allows us to decipher the geological history of the Antarcti c region back to the Miocene and to test competing hypotheses in thi s important yet undersampled region. In particular, recovery of lon g records will improve our understanding of how the coupled Antarctic ice-ocean-atmosphere system evolved to the present state an d how  it  behaved  across  major  climate transitions  and  durin g warmer-than-present times. We will also test how Seismic Reflectors $\mathbf{a}{-}\mathbf{c}_{:}$ , which divide four main regional units, relate to ke y changes in Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) history, oceanic currents, and/or climate evolution. These changes could include the middl e Miocene glacial intensification of the East Antarctic Ice Shee t (EAIS), the mid-Pliocene warm interval, the late Pliocene glacial enhancement of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), the mid-Pleistocene  transition  (MPT),  or  more  recent  glacial–interglacial changes. Using a variety of proxies and modeling approaches, th e sediments recovered during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 382 will be used to address key topics discussed in the following sections.  

# Past Antarctic Ice Sheet behavior  

The Scotia Sea sites are strategically located in two areas of “Iceberg Alley,” the major Antarctic gateway to lower latitudes wher e Antarctic icebergs generally exit to the Southern Ocean (Figure F1) . Weber et al. (2014) revealed that times of enhanced iceberg-rafte d debris (IBRD) recorded in Scotia Sea sediments correspond to time s of AIS instability. Accordingly, with material collected during Expedition 382 we should be able to generate the first spatially integrate d and long-term reconstruction of AIS variability and its relation t o sea level and climate change. A recent proof-of-concept study re

vealed that, at least for the late Pleistocene, sedimentation rates a t these sites are high enough to record climate and ice sheet change s on decadal-to-centennial timescales. The discovery that massiv e episodes of iceberg discharge begin abruptly, ramping up fro m background levels to peak values within decades (Weber et al., 2014), has fundamental implications for projections of future AI S behavior in a warming world. In addition, IBRD provenance is abl e to differentiate circum-Antarctic events from regional AIS events, and sea level, ice sheet, and iceberg modeling will be used to improve  our  understanding  of  AIS  dynamics,  especially  durin g warmer-than-present periods and glacial terminations. Also, expanded sea ice could enhance thermal isolation and AIS expansio n and vice versa.  

# Regional atmospheric circulation and dust transport  

Our two drilling areas in the Scotia Sea are located to monito r the history of prevailing Southern Hemisphere westerlies (SHW ) located between Patagonian dust sources to the north and Antarcti c ice-core dust records to the south (e.g., EPICA Community Members, 2006) (Figure F1). We will reconstruct dust transport histor y in the Pirie (Site U1538) and Dove Basins (Sites U1536 and U1537 ) with attendant implications for the SHW in more northerly (proximal; e.g., Sites U1534 and U1535) and southerly (distal; e.g., Antarctic ice cores) positions relative to the dust source. We will als o investigate whether marine and ice-core dust proxies are couple d over the last $800~\mathrm{ky}$ similar to the last glacial cycle (Weber et al., 2014). Such coupling can provide chronostratigraphic control an d allow us to infer whether and how dust covaried with orbital cycle s prior to the late Pleistocene.  

# Drake Passage throughflow and deepwater history  

The Scotia Sea sites, complemented by the Subantarctic Fron t sites, are located to reconstruct the variability in the strength of th e Drake Passage throughflow immediately east of this major geographic bottleneck constraining the flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) (McCave et al., 2014). Using proxy records, w e should be able to identify times of stronger ACC influence (highe r proportions of Circumpolar Deep Water [CDW]) from times o f stronger Weddell Sea influence (higher proportions of Weddell Se a Deep Water [WSDW]) (Figure F1), specifically at the southern Scotia Sea sites. Finally, because the sites stretch across major latitudinal ocean and atmosphere fronts (Figure F1), we should be able t o reconstruct past changes in ocean productivity, sea ice extent, an d regional wind patterns for the key periods described above, including late Quaternary glacial–interglacial and millennial-scale cycles.  

# Background  

# Geological setting  

The formation of the Scotia Sea is linked to the opening of th e Drake Passage since the Eocene. The Drake Passage is proposed t o be the final stage in the Gondwana breakup, resulting in the onset o f the ACC and the initiation of the thermal isolation of the Antarcti c continent (e.g., Lawver and Gahagan, 2003). In addition to being responsible for the onset of the ACC, the Drake Passage is considere d (Alvarez, 1982) and has been demonstrated to be an asthenospheri c gateway (Martos et al., 2014, 2019). The Scotia Sea is underlain b y two main tectonic plates, Scotia and Sandwich (e.g., Dalziel et al., 2013; Eagles and Jokat, 2014). In the Scotia plate, a series of smal l basins have developed that are bounded by the South Scotia Ridg e on their southern part (e.g., Maldonado et al., 2006) (Figure F1).  

Sediments located in the Scotia Sea and its southern basins hav e recorded the history and evolution of the tectonics and oceanic currents in the area (e.g., Martos et al., 2013; Pérez et al., 2017). Fiv e main seismic units (Figures F2, F3) separated by distinct stratigraphic discontinuities can be regionally traced among the small southern basins and north of the Weddell Sea (Maldonado et al., 2006). The ages of these regional units have not been established t o date; however, interpretation of the sedimentary record in th e southern Scotia Sea basins (Pérez et al., $2014{\bf a}$ , 2014b, 2017) an d long-distance correlation of seismic records to the Weddell Sea continental margin (Lindeque et al., 2013) indicate an early Pleistocen e age near the base of the top unit and a mid-Miocene age near th e bottom of the lowermost unit. The seismic reflections are mostl y subparallel in the three upper units, although internal transparen t or chaotic facies indicate localized disturbances and downslop e deposition (e.g., Pérez et al., 2016; Ruano et al., 2014), a general phenomenon present at all Expedition 382 drill sites.  

In addition to tectonically induced downslope transport, th e sedimentary record in the southern Scotia Sea basins is shaped b y bottom currents along the pathway of the ACC and WSDW (e.g., Orsi et al., 1999; Naveira Garabato et al., 2002). Contourite deposit s dominate the southern Scotia Sea, especially in the upper thre e units or from Reflector c upward (e.g., Maldonado et al., 2006; Martos et al., 2013; Pérez et al., 2014b, 2017). Previous studies have proposed that deposition in the southern Scotia Sea basins wa s influenced by the action of the ACC in the lower units and by th e action of the WSDW flows in the upper three units (e.g., Martos e t al., 2013; Pérez et al., 2014a). Reflector c (Maldonado et al., 2006) i s regionally identified in the Scotia and Weddell Seas and shows  a northward progradational pattern (Lindeque et al., 2013). Tectoni c movements during the middle Miocene opened the Jane Basin,  a gateway in the South Scotia Ridge that allowed northward flow o f WSDW (Maldonado et al., 2006) and also initiated the uplift of th e Shackleton Fracture Zone (Martos et al., 2013). These tectoni c events may have forced the ACC to shift north, thereby contributin g to the thermal isolation of Antarctica (Martos et al., 2013). Thes e changes could also be the cause of EAIS expansion and establishment of full-glacial conditions in both the Scotia and Weddell Sea s (Lindeque et al., 2013). Unit I, a contourite drift in Dove Basin wit h basal Reflector a, represents the youngest regional sedimentary uni t and was possibly deposited in concert with the intensification o f Northern Hemisphere glaciation and/or postulated WAIS expansion (McKay et al., 2012). All of these hypotheses will be tested wit h material recovered during this expedition.  

For Dove Basin, Galindo-Zaldívar et al. (2014) provide estimated basement ages of 24–21 Ma (late Oligocene to early Miocene) constrained by spreading magnetic anomaly models an d $^{40}\mathrm{{Ar/^{39}A r}}$ dating from dredge samples from the spreading ridge. Fo r Pirie Basin, estimated basement ages range from 43 (Barker et al., 2013) to $14\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Galindo-Zaldívar et al., 2006) based on geothermal heat flow measurements and spreading magnetic anomalies, respectively.  

Recent seismic interpretations for the Dove (Pérez et al., 2017 ) and Pirie Basins (Pérez et al., 2014b) added Reflector $\mathbf{a}^{\prime}$ in Unit I. Fo r Dove Basin, three seismic lines indicate a basin-like structure wit h several small-scale ridges and continuous reflectors in the central part (Figure F1). Site U1536 (proposed Site SCO-13) is locate d along Seismic Line 10/04, which runs to the deepest part of the basin in the north. This site provides the best compromise betwee n

East–west runnin g Seismic Lines 13/13 and 11/08 indicate a north–south oriented basin. Site U1538 (proposed Site SCO-11) shows very thick and plana r strata of Units I and II in the center of the small basin to the north.  

Topographic parametric sonar (TOPAS) was used along Profil e Lines 2004_SCAN_TOPAS_L10C and 2004_SCAN_TOPAS_L07 F in Dove Basin (Sites U1536 and U1537) to allow a high-resolutio n characterization of the two dominant sedimentary features. First, disturbed sedimentary sequences likely indicate mass transport deposits (MTDs) caused by continued tectonic activity (Ruano et al., 2014) (Figure F4). Second, interbedded layered deposits for m mounds with wavy morphologies and elongated erosional feature s that were likely formed by bottom currents (Ruano et al., 2014).  

In Pirie Basin, TOPAS Profile Line 2013_SCAN_TOPAS_L1 3 over Site U1538 does not show evidence of MTDs, but it display s the same mounded and wavy morphologies that suggest oceanographic control of the sedimentation, which is in agreement wit h the interpretations from high-resolution studies in neighboring basins (Dove and Scan Basins; Ruano et al., 2014; García et al., 2016). A comparison of all three Scotia Sea sites is shown in Figure F4.  

During Expedition 382, we also cored two sites below the Subantarctic Front: Sites U1534 and U1535 (proposed Sites SFSD-03 A and SFSD-02A, respectively). The sediments targeted are part of  a

# Scientific objectives  

1. Reconstructing the history of AIS growth and decay  

Marine records of IBRD provide a nearly continuous history o f variability in ice sheet mass loss. The majority of large icebergs $^{?}{>}5$ km long) that calve from the AIS margin (Stuart and Long, 2011) ar e routed through Iceberg Alley after traveling counterclockwise aroun d Antarctica in the coastal current (Figure F1). Melt rates increas e when icebergs reach the warmer ACC in our study area (Silva et al., 2006). Because icebergs currently account for $\sim\!50\%$ of the total AI S mass loss (Gladstone et al., 2001), the Scotia Sea IBRD record will, for the first time, capture a spatially integrated signal that is representative of variability in the flux of icebergs released by the AIS o n million-year timescales.  

IBRD records of the last deglaciation demonstrate the outstanding opportunity for developing well-dated, long records of AIS discharge history. Based on X-radiograph counts, Weber et al. (2014 ) identified eight events of increased AIS discharge (AID1–AID8 ) that occurred between 19 and $9\,\mathrm{ka}$ . These records provide the firs t robust evidence for centennial- to millennial-scale variability in deglacial mass loss from the AIS. Specifically, AID6 $\left({\sim}15{-}13.9\,\mathrm{ka}\right)$ ha s the largest IBRD flux, which peaks at $14.76\mathrm{-}14.4\,\mathrm{ka}$ and is synchronous with the timing $(14.65{-}14.31\,\mathrm{ka})$ ) and duration (340 y) of Meltwater Pulse 1A (MWP-1A) (Deschamps et al., 2012). It provides th e first direct evidence for an Antarctic contribution to MWP-1A.  

This interpretation is supported by novel modeling and ice-cor e studies (Fogwill et al., 2017; Golledge et al., 2014) but is in marke d contrast to reconstructions arguing for a minor and later (after ${\sim}14$ ka) AIS retreat (e.g., Bentley et al., 2010; Conway et al., 1999; Mackintosh et al., 2011, 2014; Peltier, 2004). However, those studies rel y on temporally and geographically restricted terrestrial and shallowmarine near-field sequences (Anderson et al., 2014; Heroy and Anderson, 2007; Hillenbrand et al., 2013).  

The contribution of the AIS to past sea level change remain s poorly constrained, yet it is important for assessing the sensitivity o f the AIS to climate change and its contribution to future sea leve l rise (Church et al., 2013). Thus, large uncertainties remain in ou r understanding of the interactions between the AIS, Southern an d Northern Hemisphere climate, and global sea level. Studying the integrated variability in AIS volume change through critical periods o f Earth’s history has the potential to substantially advance our knowledge on several fronts. Even for the mid- to late Holocene, a time o f relative AIS stability, the IBRD record from Iceberg Alley reveal s substantial decadal- to centennial-scale variations in ice mass los s that have far-field effects and significant implications for future AI S development (Bakker et al., 2016).  

With the highly resolved and continuous sediment record obtained during Expedition 382, we should be able to address important questions about past AIS discharge history and associate d changes in climate and sea level related to the following:  

• The mid-Miocene EAIS glacial intensification, which is the widespread discontinuity believed to mark the onset of WSDW flow into the Scotia Sea (Maldonado et al., 2006; Martos et al., 2013; Pérez et al., 2014a, 2017) and the transition to full-glacial conditions in the Weddell Sea (Lindeque et al., 2013); • AIS expansion and climate cooling during the late Pliocene as reconstructed for the WAIS (McKay et al., 2012); • Potentially significant WAIS volume changes during mid-Pliocene warm intervals (Naish et al., 2009);  

• The size of the AIS during warm periods (e.g., the mid-Miocene climate optimum and the mid-Pliocene warming); and • The AIS contribution to sea level highstands during previous warm periods (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013).  

Is the AIS mass loss history involved in the MPT, and if so, wil l we observe abrupt or gradual changes in IBRD flux? How simila r are previous glacial terminations to the last deglaciation? Does th e more northerly located Pirie Basin contain a higher percentage o f IBRD from WAIS icebergs that escaped the generally counterclockwise circulation around Antarctica and instead were routed throug h the Drake Passage? Can we link the delivery of icebergs to Milankovitch orbital cycles, and if so, how do these links evolve with time?  

X-radiographs obtained on board and grain size measurement s that will be obtained postcruise will be used to identify periods o f enhanced AIS mass loss throughout the Expedition 382 records. T o simulate dynamics and changes in ice volume associated with circum-AIS instabilities, ice sheet climate models will also be utilize d postcruise (e.g., Levermann et al., 2012; Winkelmann et al., 2012).  

# 2. Chronology and dust-climate couplings  

We will follow the approach of Cody et al. (2008) to establish  a coherent low-resolution chronology by combining diatom biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and tephrostratigraphy. Also, oxyge n isotopes $(\delta^{18}\mathrm{O})$ on biogenic silica could help constrain the timin g and related changes in global ice volume and deep-ocean circulation. Sediment physical and optical properties as well as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanner data will be used for orbital tuning an d identification of tephra layers, followed by microscopic identification and $^{40}\mathrm{{Ar/^{39}A r}}$ dating of the tephras. Prominent volcanic source s of ash layers are located to the west (e.g., Deception Island; Moreto n and Smellie, 1998).  

In addition to magnetostratigraphic dating using the magneti c reversal history (Opdyke et al., 1966), relative paleointensity offer s the potential for suborbital magnetic stratigraphy between polarit y boundaries (Channell et al., 2009; Stoner et al., 2000; Valet, 2003; Valet et al., 2005; Ziegler et al., 2011). Calibration of relative paleointensity with the dust/ice-core chronology could be used fo r stratigraphic correlation to sedimentary records throughout th e Southern Ocean and beyond, as has been done with the intercalibration of benthic $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ and relative paleointensity (Channell et al., 2009, 2016). Because magnetic susceptibility (MS) has been show n to look like ice-core dust records (e.g., Weber et al., 2012), a bette r understanding of MS should be derivable through particle size specific (magnetic) measurements (Hatfield and Stoner, 2013; Hatfiel d et al., 2013).  

Correlating dust proxies such as MS, Ca, and Fe with the Antarctic ice-core dust flux should provide high-resolution chronological control (Weber et al., 2012) at least for the late Pleistocene an d allow us to reconstruct atmospheric circulation. The correlation o f marine dust records to well-dated ice-core dust records has been  a major step forward in developing Southern Ocean chronologies fo r the subantarctic Pacific (Lamy et al., 2014), subantarctic Atlanti c (Martínez-Garcia et al., 2011, 2014), and Scotia Sea (Weber et al., 2012, 2014). This correlation is possible because dust deposition appears to be coherent and synchronous across much of the Souther n Ocean and the AIS. Age models developed for Cores MD07-313 3 and MD07-3134 followed this correlation strategy by synchronizin g marine (MS and XRF-based counts of Ca and Fe) to ice-core dus t proxies (e.g., non–sea salt Ca fluxes) (McCave et al., 2014; Pugh e t al., 2009; Weber et al., 2012).  

We will correlate marine and ice-core dust proxies for the las t $800\;\mathrm{ky}$ (the maximum age of ice-core records) and evaluate the robustness of the strategy used by Martínez-Garcia et al. (2011), wh o correlated ocean dust proxies with the LR04 stack (Lisiecki an d Raymo, 2005) back to the base of the Pleistocene.  

Martínez-Garcia et al. (2011) suggested that dust plays a majo r role in intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation since th e mid-Pliocene, with a distinct and abrupt increase in dust flux at th e start of the MPT at $1.25\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (see also Rodríguez-Sanza et al., 2012). In contrast, Elderfield et al. (2012) inferred an abrupt increase i n AIS volume at ${\sim}900\ \mathrm{ka}$ attributed to the onset of the MPT. Finally, Raymo et al. (2006) proposed that the MPT was associated with th e establishment of largely marine-based ice margins around Antarctica. In any of these scenarios, drilling the Scotia Sea sites provides  a unique opportunity to investigate iceberg-dust-climate interaction s and their possible role in AIS behavior, as well as to help evaluat e the role of dust in the evolution of Pliocene–Pleistocene glacial cycles, atmospheric $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ and iron fertilization (Martínez-Garcia et al. , 2011, 2014).  

Relative paleointensity and magnetic reversal determination s will be used in tandem to obtain further age control for Pliocene an d Pleistocene sediments. Relative paleointensity records have previously been developed and used as a stratigraphic tool in the Southern Hemisphere (Channell et al., 2000; Mazaud et al., 2002; Stone r et al., 2002, 2003) and on the Antarctic margin (Guyodo et al., 2001; Sagnotti et al., 2001). Stacked relative paleointensity templates ar e well correlated with $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ for at least the last $2.2\;\mathrm{My}$ (NARPI-220 0 [Channell et al., 2016], PISO-1500 [Channell et al., 2009], SINT2000 [Valet et al., 2005], and PDAM2M [Ziegler et al., 2011]), an d individual relative paleointensity and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ records extend to the lat e Pliocene (e.g., Channell et al., 2016).  

# 3. AIS mass loss and regional-to-global sea level change  

Sea level changes originating from the AIS show a complex spatial variability that is sensitive to the geometry and timescale o f mass loss. For example, a rapid mass loss causes local sea level fal l adjacent to the former ice source, a fall that can be an order of magnitude greater than the associated globally averaged (eustatic) se a level rise. At progressively greater distances from the region of mas s loss, the amplitude of sea level rise increases, peaking at $\mathord{\sim}15\%$ abov e eustatic in the far field. Thus, any rapid AIS mass loss would drive  a local, large-amplitude sea level fall that could stabilize the ice shee t to further retreat (Gomez et al., 2010, 2013). In contrast, rapid mas s loss from Northern Hemisphere ice sheets will lead to a sea leve l rise adjacent to the AIS with a strong geographic gradient and maximum amplitudes in the Atlantic sector. This far-field sea level ris e will impact AIS stability, and the gradient will make the Atlanti c sector particularly susceptible to collapse (Clark et al., 2002; Webe r et al., 2011).  

The peak IBRD flux of AID6 corresponds to the time of MWP1A, with a six-fold increase in flux relative to the Holocene steadystate average (Weber et al., 2014). This peak flux suggests that th e IBRD record of Iceberg Alley may provide a proxy for the relativ e amount of mass released by the AIS and its associated contributio n to global sea level rise for previous warm times in the late Neogene. Through development of long IBRD records from Iceberg Alley, w e will evaluate whether meltwater pulses occurred and estimate thei r possible contribution to global sea level as well as the possible rol e of regional sea level in modulating AIS mass loss.  

For past warm periods detected at all sites (e.g., Marine Isotop e Stages [MISs] 5.5, 11, and 31 and potentially others further back i n time), it would be of specific interest to identify the source and relative timing of AIS mass loss. For instance, was there a late sea level highstand during MIS 5.5 (O’Leary et al., 2013)? Is there physical evidence for an AIS trigger? Investigations will be accompanied b y deglacial simulations for iceberg transport around Antarctica, focusing on the last two deglaciations (e.g., Siddall et al., 2006) an d warmer-than-present periods to better understand high-latitud e climate processes and AIS dynamics and their impact on sea level.  

To explore the impact of ice mass changes on sea level in th e near and far field, we will adopt a state-of-the-art sea level model that incorporates all deformational, gravitational, and rotational effects of glacial isostatic adjustment (Kendall et al., 2005). Thi s model also takes account of shoreline migration associated with local onlap/offlap of water and changes in the extent of grounded, marine-based ice. Sensitivity studies will be performed using Maxwell viscoelastic Earth models, in which Earth’s structure varies wit h depth through the lithosphere. We will also perform calculations incorporating lateral variations in viscosity structure using a finite element numerical model (Latychev et al., 2005). This model may b e particularly important given seismic inferences of large difference s in mantle structure below the WAIS and EAIS (Danesi and Morelli, 2001) and their impact on dynamic topography (Austermann et al., 2015).  

# 4. Water mass changes and ocean thermal forcing  

The Southern Ocean plays an important role in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) because it controls, through upwelling, the rate of heat and carbon exchange with th e surface (Marshall and Speer, 2012), which is a major driver of climate change. This interhemispheric teleconnection shows that a reduction in the AMOC and attendant decrease in northward hea t transport leads to warming of the Southern Hemisphere and t o changes in the relative contributions of North Atlantic Deep Wate r (NADW) to Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), as well as th e amount of CDW that is formed through mixing. Our goal is t o study the changes in water mass properties that lead to atmospheri c and oceanic reorganizations and associated changes in wind fields, sea ice, marine productivity, atmospheric $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ surface ocean an d atmosphere temperatures, and AIS mass loss.  

The radiogenic isotope composition of authigenic neodymiu m $(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Nd}})$ provides important information on past changes in deepwate r mixing (e.g., Gutjahr et al., 2007, 2008; Piotrowski et al., 2005, 2008; Goldstein and Hemming, 2003; van de Flierdt et al., 2006). The isotopic signal of seawater-derived $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Nd}}$ will be separated from othe r sedimentary components following the method of Blaser et al. (2016), seawater-derived Nd will be extracted from fish teeth following the method of Scher and Martin (2004), and the method o f Roberts et al. (2010, 2012) will be used for foraminifer-rich sediments. The Nd isotope composition in the modern water column i s well resolved in the Drake Passage (Stichel et al., 2012; Struve et al., 2017) and the Pacific (Carter et al., 2012; Rickli et al., 2014) and Atlantic (Stichel et al., 2012) sectors of the Southern Ocean.  

Based on Piotrowski et al. (2004), Robinson and van de Flierd t (2009), and Skinner et al. (2013), CDW was very likely much mor e radiogenic (higher $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Nd}}$ ) during glacials because of lower admixing o f NADW relative to CDW. In combination with modeling efforts, w e will (1) assess past changes in water mass composition using authigenic neodymium isotopes to test the ocean thermal forcing hypothesis for previous terminations (e.g., Böhm et al., 2015; How e and Piotrowski, 2017) and (2) test whether changes in NADW, CDW, and WSDW are associated with the formation of Reflector s a, b, and c (Pérez et al., 2014b, 2017, 2019). Another sensitive prox y that should provide information on water mass sourcing is authigenic Pb isotope compositions, for which records will be generate d alongside the Nd isotopic reconstructions (e.g., Kurzweil et al., 2010).  

Given the importance of ocean thermal forcing to the dynamic s of AIS marine margins and grounding lines, we will also evaluat e the relationship between sea-surface temperature (SST) and IBR D flux. Because the alkenone unsaturation index $\left(\mathrm{U}^{\mathrm{k^{\prime}}}{}_{37}\right)$ is likely no t applicable (Shevenell et al., 2011), we will extract isoprenoid an d branched glycerol diether glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids to measure the $\mathrm{TEX}_{86}$ ratio (Schouten et al., 2002) and convert it to SS T using published calibrations (e.g., Kim et al., 2008).  

# 5. Provenance studies  

Identifying the regional sources of individual IBRD events i s crucial to assess past AIS evolution. In particular, does the IBR D signal at any given time reflect an ice sheet–wide contribution, o r were different iceberg discharges associated with specific sectors o f the AIS? The diverse geology of the Weddell embayment and Eas t Antarctica provides distinct isotope geochemical sources that wil l be distinguished in IBRD and the fine sediment fraction. For example, the $^{40}\mathrm{{Ar/^{39}}\mathrm{{Ar}}}$ age of a single hornblende (or mica) IBRD grai n allows it to be traced to a source on the continent with a simila r $^{40}\mathrm{{Ar/^{39}A r}}$ age, and a population of ${\sim}30$ hornblende grains shoul d show which sources are most actively exporting debris in icebergs, which is information critical to reconstructing the past history o f the AIS (e.g., Williams et al., 2010; Pierce et al., 2014). Similarly, P b isotopic signatures and $^{40}\mathrm{{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{{Ar}}}$ in feldspars (e.g., Flowerdew et al., 2013), U-Pb in zircons (e.g., Pierce et al., 2014), and other thermochronometers (e.g., reviewed in Licht and Hemming, 2017) can distinguish  input  from  different  source  areas.  Combining  thes e mineral tracers should lead to more accurate identification of provenance and hence the spatial history of AIS glaciation.  

The provenance of glacially eroded fine sediment will also be assessed using detrital radiogenic isotope systems. For example, SmNd isotopes, which reflect the “crustal extraction” bedrock age, hav e been widely used for AIS provenance studies (e.g., Roy et al., 2007). Recent studies on the Wilkes Land margin also indicate extensiv e EAIS retreat during Pliocene sea level highstands (Cook et al., 2013). Overall, East and West Antarctic bedrock have distinctly different Nd isotopic compositions, so $\scriptstyle\mathrm{Sm-Nd}$ isotope results shoul d let us gauge the balance of sediment input between East and Wes t Antarctica. Although some overlap occurs between the radiogeni c isotopes from East and West Antarctica (Roy et al., 2007), broadl y there is considerably older crust (and thus lower $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Nd}}$ and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{Hf}}$ an d higher $^{87}\mathrm{Sr}/^{86}\mathrm{Sr}$ ) from East Antarctic sources. In some cases, th e provenance information from sand and fine fractions can provid e contrasting evidence (e.g., Cook et al., 2017; Licht and Hemming, 2017), so it is important to examine both. Other geochemical tracers, especially radiogenic isotopes systems such as Rb-Sr, U-Th-Pb, Lu-Hf, and K-Ar are likely to provide greater clarity in the assessment of mixing from difference sources.  

Finally, provenance studies may help to resolve a longstandin g issue by constraining the source of the high sea level during MIS 5, which was $5\mathrm{-}9\mathrm{~m~}$ higher than today (Dutton and Lambeck, 2012; Kopp et al., 2009). Greenland contributed from 1 to $4\textrm{m}$ (NEE M Community Members, 2013), implying an additional contributio n from the AIS was necessary (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013). Although the WAIS is commonly invoked as the most likely source, n o data support this assumption, and additional sources from the EAI S should also be considered, particularly with the growing recognition that it also has substantial areas of marine-based ice that ma y play an increasing role in future AIS mass loss and global sea level scenarios.  

# 6. Glacial–interglacial sea ice shifts and the carbon cycle  

Changes in sea ice extent influences the flux of heat and carbo n between the deep ocean and the atmosphere (Schmitt et al., 2012 ) and the degree of primary production (Anderson et al., 2009). Se a ice is recognized as an important amplifier of high-latitude climat e anomalies, and of particular interest is the role of sea ice variabilit y on glacial–interglacial climate. Expanded Antarctic sea ice durin g glacials increases export of AABW/WSDW and limits mixing an d ventilation of the deep ocean, possibly causing ${\sim}20\%{-}60\%$ of th e glacial–interglacial $C O_{2}$ change according to carbon cycle model s (Ferrari et al., 2014; Sigman et al., 2010; Stephens and Keeling, 2000). However, there are few proxy constraints to test these models, and large uncertainties remain. Little is known about the areal extent and duration of summer and winter sea ice during previou s glacials and interglacials. Similarly, the primary controls on changing sea ice distribution and associated feedbacks are also poorl y constrained. In combination with modeling efforts, seasonal sea ic e changes will be investigated over multiple glacial cycles to help she d light on the processes that cause changes in ocean circulation, ventilation, and $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ sequestration.  

We hypothesize that changes in Antarctic winter and summe r sea ice extent are driven by migration of the SHW and fluxes of glacial meltwater to the surface ocean. The sea salt $\mathrm{N}\mathbf{a}^{+}$ flux record o f the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dronning Maud Land (EDML) ice core suggests that sea ice extent underwent large fluctuations during the last deglaciation (Wolff et al., 2006), which has been simulated by modeling studies (Menviel e t al., 2011). Similarly, models suggest that ocean thermal forcin g during the last deglaciation induced increased freshwater at the onset of MWP-1A, causing consecutive sea ice expansion during th e Antarctic Cold Reversal and retreat thereafter at the beginning o f the Younger Dryas (Weber et al., 2014). Based on findings for th e last glacial (Allen et al., 2011; Collins et al., 2013), we hypothesiz e that previous glacial expansions of summer and winter sea ice in th e Scotia Sea will reach their maximum extents at ${\sim}59^{\circ}$ and ${\sim}55^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ , respectively.  

Fogwill et al. (2014) modeled a $9^{\circ}$ poleward shift of the SHW an d a $0.2^{\circ}{-}0.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warming in the upper $500\;\mathrm{m}$ of the subpolar gyres tha t persisted for millennia during deglaciation. Associated AIS drawdown might also have induced large-scale sea ice expansion an d IBRD increase (Fogwill et al., 2017). Reconstructing these Antarcti c sea ice conditions and dust-climate couplings will provide muc h needed empirical data to assess whether changes in sea ice cover ar e driven by the position of the southern SHW and/or flux of glacial meltwater.  

The Scotia Sea core sites are ideally located to record past variations in both summer and winter sea ice boundaries. To determin e the latter, we will use diatom assemblages (Allen et al., 2011) and  a new biomarker-based method that uses highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs) (Collins et al., 2013). The biomarker $\mathrm{IP}_{25},$ a monounsaturated HBI biomarker derived from sea ice diatoms, has bee n used to reconstruct sea ice conditions in Arctic regions for Quaternary to Pliocene timescales (Belt et al., 2007; Belt and Müller, 2013; Müller et al., 2009; Stein and Fahl, 2013). HBIs have been used as  a corresponding proxy for seasonal sea ice in the Southern Ocea n (Massé et al., 2011). Importantly, the source organism of HBIs foun d in Antarctica, the diatom Berkeleya adeliensis, has now been identified (Belt et al., 2016). B. adeliensis is endemic to Antarctic sea ic e only, and the HBI it produces has been named biomarker $\mathrm{IPSO}_{25}$ . Because $B$ . adeliensis flourishes in platelet ice, the sedimentar y abundance of $\mathrm{IPSO}_{25}$ is sensitive to nearby glacial or ice-shelf settings, likely explaining its occurrence in glacial Scotia Sea sedimen t (Collins et al., 2013). Also, Belt et al. (2015) and Smik et al. (2016 ) demonstrated enhanced production of a different HBI biomarke r within a retreating ice-edge environment. Combined analysis o f $\mathrm{IPSO}_{25}$ with other HBIs should therefore provide insights into seasonal sea ice dynamics.  

Analysis of sea ice diatoms (Fragilariopsis curta, Fragilariopsi s cylindrus, and Fragilariopsis obliquecostata) (Gersonde and Zielinski, 2000) and sea ice diatom morphology (Allen, 2014) has als o been successfully used to reconstruct Pleistocene sea ice extent i n the Southern Ocean (Allen et al., 2011; Gersonde et al., 2005), an d the same approach will be implemented here to complement th e HBI analysis. In addition, novel sedimentary ancient DNA (aDNA ) analyses (Armbrecht et al., 2019) will be used to complement bot h diatom and HBI data to achieve a broader picture of sea ice–associated paleocommunities.  

These methods $\mathrm{IPSO}_{25}$ and sea ice diatom analysis; dependin g on preservation also aDNA) will be applied to piston cores along th e north–south transect of the southern Scotia Sea sites to determin e the presence/absence of permanent and/or seasonal sea ice, the position of the marginal ice zone, and associated wind mixing an d ocean stratification for the last $60\ \mathrm{ky}.$ . We will apply these sam e methods to older intervals. To further strengthen our investigatio n of the silica inventory, we will also include $\delta^{30}\mathrm{Si}$ and $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ studies o n diatoms.  

Reconstructions of sea ice and paleotemperature will be accompanied by transient climate model simulations (e.g., Timmerman n et al., 2014). To study Southern Hemisphere climate change s throughout past glacial–interglacial cycles, the global earth syste m model for studying the long-term evolution of climate (LOVECLIM) (Menviel et al., 2008, 2010; Timmermann et al., 2009) will b e used, based on a dynamical atmosphere coupled to an ocean genera l circulation model and dynamic/thermodynamic sea ice and diagnostic vegetation models. This model has been used to simulate th e transient evolution of the past four glacial–interglacial cycles (Timmermann et al., 2014). Numerical experiments are also underwa y with the Pennsylvania State University AIS model (Pollard and DeConto, 2009), forced by the LOVECLIM transient model output o f the past $408\,\mathrm{ky},$ which will allow future investigations of climate–ic e sheet interactions on orbital timescales and comparisons with paleoproxy data generated from Iceberg Alley drill cores. Climate–ic e sheet interactions can also be studied with the Consortium fo r Small Scale Modeling (COSMOS) climate model, a state-of-the ar t comprehensive coupled general circulation model that has been extensively used to study past climate (Knorr et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). The COSMOS model is now coupled to a n ice sheet model that includes ice-shelf and grounding-line dynamic s (Barbi et al., 2013; Thoma et al., 2014).  

# 7. ACC flow speed reconstruction  

The SHW are crucial for the Drake Passage throughflow (e.g., Marshall and Speer, 2012; Toggweiler and Samuels, 1995), atmospheric $C O_{2}$ release (Denton et al., 2010; Lamy et al., 2007; Sigma n and Boyle, 2000), and paleoproductivity (Anderson et al., 2009; Lamy et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2016; Sprenk et al., 2013). For th e last glaciation, a northward shift of oceanic fronts is suggested fo r the southeast Pacific (Lamy et al., 2007; Moreno et al., 1999), Sout h Atlantic (e.g., Barker et al., 2009; Park and Latif, 2008), and southwest Pacific/Indian Ocean regions (e.g., De Deckker et al., 2012; Lorrey et al., 2012). Modeling studies suggest a reduction of AC C transport volume during glacial stages and an increase during glacial terminations (Knorr and Lohmann, 2003, 2007), during whic h the ACC and associated fronts shifted south.  

Based on grain size analyses on 12 cores from a north–sout h transect across the Scotia Sea, McCave et al. (2014) examined th e frontal system of the ACC and concluded that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), near-bottom current velocities were essentially the same as they are today, except for the sea ice zone south o f ${\sim}56^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ where they were slower. A recent study found a glacial reduction and millennial timescale variability in the ACC throughflo w (Lamy et al., 2015). Our drill sites are located in the southern half o f this transect. Using a similar methodology, we will reconstruct paleocurrents to evaluate the long-term evolution of current speeds i n the ACC and whether changes in the Drake Passage throughflo w and shifts in frontal systems are associated with Seismic Units I–I V in the long term and with glacial–interglacial and/or millennial timescales in the short term. Analyses will be made in conjunctio n with modeling efforts and compared to other Southern Ocean regions.  

Drilling in the more southerly Dove Basin should also provid e insights into the evolution of the WSDW overflow through the Orkney Passage. As a working hypothesis, this process could hav e started with Reflector c during the mid-Miocene and strengthene d after Reflector a during the late Pliocene according to Maldonado e t al. (2006). Both Dove Basin and isolated basins in the South Scoti a Ridge show complex contourite systems (Maldonado et al., 2003). Could this imply that Dove Basin was generally more dominated b y WSDW whereas Pirie Basin was under higher influence of CDW ? Today, WSDW flows northwest at a relatively high speed $(\le\!0.6\;\mathrm{m/s})$ at the southern limit of Dove Basin (Naveira Garabato et al., 2002).  

8. Pliocene–Pleistocene ice age climate cycles and underlying causes The global cooling trend observed over the last $3{-}5\,\mathrm{My},$ , with th e initiation of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at ${\sim}2.6$ Ma, has bee n attributed to the interplay of changes in orbital configuratio n (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005), $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ decrease (Lunt et al., 2008; Raym o et al., 1988), tectonic development (Cane and Molnar, 2001; Raym o et al., 1988), intensification of Antarctic glaciation (McKay et al., 2012), and the emergence of the cold tongue in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Martínez-Garcia et al., 2010). Prevalent theories fo r subsequent glacial–interglacial changes propose that fluctuations i n global ice volume are caused by variations in the amount of insolation received at critical latitudes and seasons due to variations i n Earth’s orbital parameters. In particular, it is widely agreed that variations in ice volume over the last 700,000 y at the precessional ( $^{\sim23}$ ky) and obliquity $(41\,\mathrm{ky})$ frequencies are directly forced by and coherent with Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, whereas th e ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{ky}$ eccentricity component of the ice age cycle results fro m nonlinear amplification mechanisms (e.g., Abe-Ouchi et al., 2013; Imbrie et al., 1993, 1992). However, during the late Pliocene–earl y Pleistocene interval from ${\sim}3$ to $1\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , only weak variance at 100 an d $23\ \mathrm{ky}$ periods was observed in proxy ice-volume records such a s benthic $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ (e.g., Raymo and Nisancioglu, 2003). Instead, the records are dominated by the 41 ky obliquity cycle (Figure F5). So wh y is there no strong precessional signal as predicted by the Milankovitch model?  

Figure F5. Age-depth relationship for the last 6 My, Expedition 382. Except for Sites U1534 and U1535, all sites show continuous deposition in this interva l based on preliminary biomagnetostratigraphy. Site U1536 extends to middle Miocene (not shown in figure). Late Pleistocene sedimentation rates are highes t in Pirie Basin (Site U1538), decrease slightly to southern Dove Basin (Sites U1536 and U1537), and lower substantially to northern Subantarctic Front (Site s U1534 and U1535). Ages according to GPTS2012 (Gradstein et al., 2012). Lower curves are $\delta^{18}0$ records (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). Colored bars in lower pane l indicate temporal extent of MPT, Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, and mid-Pliocene warm period.  

![](images/63795e13a1a82529cd98f569a743645aca3983e706b766bdf21e7037234d99fd.jpg)  

Hypotheses presented to explain this conundrum point to th e Southern Hemisphere and its important role in contributing to th e observed global climate signal (Raymo and Nisancioglu, 2003; Raymo et al., 2006; Huybers and Denton, 2008). However, only a fe w records are available from the Southern Ocean (e.g., Ocean Drillin g Program [ODP] Site 1090; Martínez-Garcia et al., 2011), East Antarctica (e.g., Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1356 a t Wilkes Land; Cook et al., 2013; Patterson et al., 2014), and Wes t Antarctica (e.g., ANDRILLL Core AND-1B; McKay et al., 2012) t o test these various hypotheses. For instance, McKay et al. (2012) suggested that the intensification of Antarctic cooling strengthene d SHW, invigorated circulation in the Southern Ocean, reduced th e AMOC, and thereby contributed to Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Raymo et al. (2006) proposed that the precession cycle shoul d be present in both Northern Hemisphere and Antarctic ice-volum e variations prior to the MPT but is absent in globally integrated records such as $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ because precession is out of phase between th e Northern and Southern Hemisphere ice sheets. Because our proposed sites are located in a region key to reconstructing the evolution of the Southern Ocean and AIS, the climate and ice shee t signals we find should help in solving this Neogene puzzle.  

# Scientific objectives for Subantarctic Front sites  

We anticipated that Sites U1534 and U1535 from the contourit e drift deposited beneath the Subantarctic Front would allow us to extend reconstructions of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) variability and migrations of the Subantarctic Front (Figure F1) to a t least $1\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Existing short $(\sim\!7\;\mathrm{m})$ cores from the area demonstrat e the potential of these sediments to yield paleoceanographic record s that document past changes in surface and intermediate waters. Deposited beneath the jet of the Subantarctic Front, the drift sediments are sensitive to velocity changes associated with frontal migration. Roberts et al. (2017) compared sortable silt records fro m the same drift with records from Drake Passage to infer a mor e northerly position of the Subantarctic Front during the last glacial. The Subantarctic Front is inferred to have shifted to its current position during the deglaciation, effectively opening up the “cold wate r route” and enhancing throughflow of Pacific-sourced intermediat e waters into the South Atlantic. Stable isotope and elemental analyses of benthic foraminifers in these cores were also used to reconstruct the history of intermediate–deep density stratification in th e Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean since the LGM (Roberts e t al., 2016).  

The cores collected at Sites U1534 and U1535 will enable us t o better understand the role of the cold water route on millennial, orbital, and longer timescales. Calcareous benthic foraminifers suitable for geochemical analysis were found in the drift sediment s throughout the last glacial cycle. We anticipated that persistent occurrence of calcareous foraminifers and tuning of benthic $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ t o the LR04 stack would provide an orbital-scale age model for the longer drift records recovered during Expedition 382. Accurately resolving interhemispheric phasing will help identify interaction s between the cold water route and the AMOC (Barker et al., 2011). In addition, new records from the Subantarctic Front drift will complement the “warm route”/Agulhas leakage records of the southeas t Atlantic (e.g., Marino et al., 2013; Martínez-Méndez et al., 2010; Peeters et al., 2004), as well as the records generated from ODP Le g 177 (e.g., Caley et al., 2013; Martínez-Garcia et al., 2011) and emerging records from IODP Expedition 361 (Hall et al., 2017).  

Additional objectives for coring the drift site include providin g the first long-term marine perspective on the evolution of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS) and its interactions with the southwest Atlantic and generating the first long-term SST records from th e subantarctic southwest Atlantic.  

# Broader implications  

Deep drilling in Iceberg Alley provides an outstanding opportunity to understand late Neogene AIS variability, to identify regiona l sources of ice mass loss, and to deliver an important historical context for future projections of AIS behavior in a warmer world. Recent novel findings (Bakker et al., 2016; Fogwill et al., 2017; Weber e t al., 2014) and the hypotheses developed for this proposal addres s AIS stability and its relation to climate change. In particular, the y challenge scenarios in which the AIS made only a relatively smal l contribution to the LGM sea level lowstand (e.g., Whitehouse et al., 2012) and made virtually no contribution to MWP-1A (e.g., Bentle y et al., 2010, 2014; Mackintosh et al., 2011, 2014). A better understanding of the Antarctic sea level contribution is critical to understanding late Neogene changes and projecting sea level rise in  a future warming world. Global mean sea level could rise $>\!1\,\textrm{m}$ b y 2100, and large uncertainties remain in projecting AIS contributions to sea level rise beyond that time (Church et al., 2013). Recently appreciated ice-loss mechanisms such as ice-cliff failure an d hydrofracturing (DeConto and Pollard, 2016) may increase the possible contribution of the AIS to future sea level rise substantially, specifically on the multicentennial timescale. Understanding th e role of ocean thermal forcing and the resulting changes in wate r masses and sea ice extent, as well as their influence on past AIS behavior, will help constrain projections of future sea level rise.  

By reconstructing past variability back to the mid-Miocene i n sea ice, SSTs, water masses, dust-climate couplings, and deepwate r current speeds in this major Antarctic gateway, our expeditio n holds the potential to provide important new understanding of th e relation between AIS volume changes, shifting SHW, ocean fertilization, and associated changes in $C O_{2}$ .  

# Principal results Site U1534  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1534 is located at $53^{\circ}11.38^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $58^{\circ}45.65^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ in $605\;\mathrm{m}$ of water (Table T1). The site is situated on the northern flank of a larg e trough ${\sim}660~\mathrm{km}$ east of the Strait of Magellan at Common Dept h Point (CDP) 10005 on Seismic Reflection Profile SGFI93. Sit e U1534 is the first of a pair of sites. The second site (U1535), which i s $8\,\mathrm{km}$ to the east, targeted an expanded copy of the unit between Reflectors A and B of the Site U1534 stratigraphy, to 120 mbsf.  

The primary objective at Site U1534 was to recover a continuou s ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ sedimentary section from a contourite drift where the cres t is currently being deposited beneath the Subantarctic Front in 60 0 m of water. The drift is bathed with AAIW as it begins its northwar d flow into the Atlantic Ocean. The principal scientific motivation t o core this drift is to better understand the role of AAIW in climat e change on millennial, glacial–interglacial, and longer timescales.  

AAIW is one of the primary water masses characterizing th e northward-flowing upper limb of the AMOC. Counterbalancin g the southward flow of NADW, AAIW currently penetrates as far a s $20^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ in the Atlantic Ocean. Despite a recent surge in research effor t (e.g., Voigt et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2017; McClymont et al. 2016), a consensus on contributions of AAIW to AMOC variability ha s not been reached.  

Today, AAIW is primarily formed in the southeast Pacific an d southwest Atlantic Oceans. AAIW and its precursor, Subantarcti c Mode Water, are advected eastward through the Drake Passag e along the Subantarctic Front. This injection of cold, low-salinity Pacific water into the South Atlantic Ocean is commonly referred to a s the cold water route. Variability in the connectivity between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans via this cold water route may modify th e physical properties of AAIW forming in the southwest Atlanti c Ocean, in turn affecting the heat and salinity budget of the AMOC. Proxy records from Sites U1534 and U1535 will provide the firs t constraints on past variability in end-member physical and geochemical properties of AAIW as it enters the upper limb of th e AMOC.  

Site U1534, located at the thickest part of the contourite drift , targeted the highest sediment accumulation rates to optimize th e temporal resolution of subsequent reconstructions. Four laterall y offset sedimentary units indicate that the drift was deposited unde r an evolving bottom current regime (Koenitz et al., 2008; Pérez et al., 2015). Seismic interpretation of drift deposits throughout the Scoti a Sea area suggests that drift deposits began forming beneath th e ACC in the early Miocene and that unconformity-bounded sedimentary units represent deposition under different oceanographi c configurations. To test hypotheses about the conditions unde r which these units were deposited, a key objective at Site U1534 wa s to core all three of the reflectors and determine the ages of the unconformities. Furthermore, confirming whether these reflectors ar e synchronous with their proposed counterparts in the Scotia Sea will enable a regional reconstruction of oceanographic evolution of th e ACC in this sector of the Southern Ocean.  

# Operations  

Expedition 382 started on 20 March 2019, and the science part y boarded on 21 March. The vessel left Mardones Pier at $2135\,\mathrm{h}$ local time to make way for a commercial vessel and moved to anchorag e close to Punta Arenas, Chile. On 25 March at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ , we started th e $19.5\;\mathrm{km}$ transit to the Cabo Negro Oil Terminal, arriving at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ . Overnight, 1300 metric tons of arctic-blend diesel were loaded. However, the ship was not permitted to depart because winds remained above the pier’s operating limit until the evening of 2 7 March. The ship pushed off at $2230\,\mathrm{h},$ and the pilot disembarked a t $0535~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 March, beginning the sea voyage to Site U1534. Th e

461 km transit was completed in $39\,\mathrm{h}$ at an average speed of $11.8\,\mathrm{kt}$ We arrived at Site U1534 at $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March.  

The first core of Expedition 382 was taken in Hole U1534A a t $2250\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March in $605.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of water. We used the advanced piston corer (APC) system to take Cores 382-U1534A-1H through 14 H (to $115.7\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), drilled through a hard layer, and switched to halflength APC (HLAPC) coring for Cores 16F–44F (to 256.7 mbsf). The extended core barrel (XCB) system was used to take the fina l cores (46X and 47X). Overall, Cores 1H–47X penetrated from th e seafloor to 266.3 mbsf and recovered $271.7\;\mathrm{m}$ $(102\%)$ .  

Hole U1534B started at $0245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 April. Core 382-U1534B-1 H recovered $1.5\textrm{m}$ of sediment, but the core liner shattered and n o clear mudline was observed, so we ended the hole.  

Hole U1534C started at $0345~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 April. Cores 382-U1534C1H through 19H penetrated from the seafloor (606.3 meters belo w sea level [mbsl]) to 168.0 mbsf and recovered $159.6\mathrm{~m~}(95\%)$ .  

Hole U1534D started at $0045~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April. The purpose of thi s hole was to fill a stratigraphic gap and provide more material fo r sampling in the upper part of the stratigraphy. Cores 382-U1534D1H through 3H penetrated from the seafloor to 28.5 mbsf and recovered $29.6\:\mathrm{m}\:(104\%)$ .  

# Principal results  

Mid- to late Pleistocene strata $(0{-}83\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ are characterized b y interbedded foraminifer-bearing greenish gray silty clay and claye y silt. A distinctly lighter colored sediment interval spanning severa l sections in Core 382-U1534C-5H contains almost $50\%$ carbonat e (composed of nannofossils and foraminifers) and likely represent s interglacial MIS 11. Centered at 40 mbsf, this biogenic-rich interva l with anomalously low $P$ -wave velocity likely accounts for Reflecto r A in the seismic profile. Other intervals where planktonic foraminifers are more abundant are tentatively assigned to interglacial MIS s  

5e, 9, and 17, as supported by paleomagnetic and biostratigraphi c data and by cyclicity in physical property data such as natural gamma radiation (NGR) and bulk density, with interglacials exhibiting lower NGR and bulk density values.  

The most common biogenic components, sponge spicules an d diatoms, generally compose between $10\%$ and $25\%$ of the sediment. Calcareous microfossils such as foraminifers, ostracods, and coccoliths are concentrated in meter-scale layers that correspond to interglacial periods to ${\sim}83$ mbsf. Several well-preserved macrofossil s were found throughout the cores, including solitary cold-water corals, gastropods, and mollusk shell fragments. Ice-rafted clasts ar e present but rare.  

A downhole transition from mid-Pleistocene to late Pliocen e radiolarian and diatom species occurs across ${\sim}83$ mbsf (Sectio n 382-U1534A-10H-3). The depth of this 1.8 My hiatus in sedimen t accumulation corresponds to the expected depth for Reflector B. The absence of a clear magnetic reversal from 0 to ${\sim}83$ mbsf suggests that the age above the unconformity is no older than $0.78\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Below Reflector B, paleomagnetic normal polarity extends to 23 3 mbsf and may constrain most of this interval to Gauss Subchro n C2An.1n $2.58–3.03\;\mathrm{~Ma})$ , implying late Pliocene sedimentatio n rates of at least ${\sim}35{-}40\ \mathrm{cm/ky}.$ . Green-gray silty clay continues t o dominate below Reflector B. Carbonate remains ${<}1\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ from 110 t o 233 mbsf and increases to as high as $5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ below 233 mbsf. Smea r slides suggest that foraminifers are rare to common below 233 mbsf.  

Diatom and radiolarian biostratigraphy indicate a second hiatu s at ${\sim}257$ mbsf that is interpreted to be associated with Reflector C. Below Reflector C, diatom and radiolarian biostratigraphic marker s date the two lowermost cores of Hole U1534A (257–266 mbsf) a s early Pliocene $(4.1{-}4.7\,\mathrm{Ma})$ . Samples for the analysis of aDNA wer e collected from the upper $91\ \mathrm{m},$ including high-resolution samplin g throughout the Holocene in the upper $9\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Interstitial water (IW) and headspace gas samples were take n from all APC cores and every second HLAPC core from Hol e U1534A and have a normal headspace gas depth profile. Salinity i s relatively low from ${\sim}30$ to $150~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and the highest alkalinity (a s high as $30\,\mathrm{mM}$ ) is at 20–30 mbsf, coinciding with the methane–sulfate transition zone.  

Four formation temperature measurements were made with th e advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) while takin g Cores 382-U1534A-4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H. The geothermal hea t flow was estimated using formation temperature measurement s and laboratory thermal conductivity measurements.  

In summary, cores collected at Site U1534 will give new insight s into the evolution of the contourite drift deposit and ice sheet– ocean climate interactions in the southwest Atlantic Ocean, an are a where long paleoclimatic records are relatively sparse. Dating th e seismic reflectors and the sediment units between these unconformities will allow us to reassess the local ice sheet and oceanic regimes  under  which  sediment  supply  and  ocean  curren t configuration led to drift deposition. High sediment accumulatio n in the late Pliocene interval will provide insights into the history o f the PIS in addition to AAIW export as Northern Hemisphere glaciation intensified. Mid- to late Pleistocene sedimentation rates o f ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ will allow millennial-scale reconstructions of the position of the Subantarctic Front as well as AAIW export to be extended back to at least MIS 17. The prominence of MIS 11 at Sit e U1534 and all the other sites cored during Expedition 382 provide s an opportunity to reconstruct a transect across the ACC during thi s superinterglacial in unprecedented temporal resolution. Comparison of the records from Site U1534 with recent records fro m Amundsen Sea and Ross Sea IODP Expeditions 379 and 374 wil l provide a critical link between processes on the Antarctic continent, South American glaciations, and the upper limb of the AMOC. Interhemispheric and interbasin comparison of these records will determine how variable transport via the cold water route may affec t AAIW export in the South Atlantic and the rate of AMOC on multiple timescales.  

# Site U1535  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1535 is located on the northern flank of an east–wes t trending trough ${\sim}668~\mathrm{~km}$ east  of  the  Strait  of  Magellan  a t $53^{\circ}11.49^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $58^{\circ}38.60^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ in $647\;\mathrm{m}$ of water (Table T1). The site is situated at CDP 9220 on Seismic Reflection Profile SGFI93-107. Sit e U1535 is the second of a pair of sites, with the first site (U1534) located $8\,\mathrm{km}$ to the west. The scientific motivation to core this drift i s identical to that of Site U1534 (see Site U1534 for detailed information about the objectives at this pair of sites). The more extensiv e coring program at Site U1534 targeted the more expanded unit s above Reflector A and below Reflector B, and Site U1535 was selected to exploit the thicker lateral extension of the sedimentar y unit between Reflectors A and B. The primary objective at Sit e U1535 was, therefore, to recover a continuous $120\ \mathrm{m}$ sedimentar y section from the upper sequences of the contourite drift deposite d on the northern flank of the east–west trending trough.  

# Operations  

After completing the $8~\mathrm{km}$ transit east from Site U1534 in dynamic positioning (DP) mode, we arrived at Site U1535 at $0930~\mathrm{h}$ local time on 2 April 2019. Hole U1535A started at $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on  2 April. The seafloor was determined by the Core 382-U1535A-1 H mudline to be at 646.9 mbsl. Cores 9H–11H were difficult to remove from the core barrel, so we switched to HLAPC coring fo r Core 12F at 88.5 mbsf. Cores 1H–17F penetrated from the seafloo r to 117.3 mbsf and recovered $112.4\mathrm{~m~}(96\%)$ . Having achieved sufficient stratigraphic coverage and considering the overall time constraints for the expedition, we concluded operations at Subantarcti c Front Sites U1534 and U1535 and started pulling up the drill strin g at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 April. The bit cleared the rotary table at $0840\,\mathrm{h}$ on  3 April, ending Hole U1535A, and the rig floor was secured for th e sea voyage to the Scotia Sea sites.  

# Principal results  

Hole U1535A contains several sequences of silty clays interbedded with clayey silts and clay layers. The most common biogeni c components (sponge spicules and diatoms) generally compose between $10\%$ and $25\%$ of the sediment. Intervals containing high concentrations of calcareous nannofossils and other microfossils ar e interpreted to be interglacial sediments, with MIS 11 inferred to occur at ${\sim}26$ mbsf. Several well-preserved macrofossils were foun d throughout the cores, including solitary cold-water corals, gastropods, and mollusk shells and shell fragments. Ice-rafted clasts ar e present but rare.  

Species assemblages and biostratigraphic age markers similar t o those at Site U1534 were observed at Site U1535. We identified 1 7 diatom, radiolarian, and palynomorph biostratigraphic age events. Unlike at Site U1534, a hiatus in sedimentation was not observe d between ${\sim}0.78$ and ${\sim}2.58\,\mathrm{~Ma~}$ . Early to mid-Pleistocene biostratigraphic markers were recovered to the base of Hole U1535A.  A downhole paleomagnetic transition from reversed to normal polarity above the two lowermost cores may represent the transitio n from the Matuyama Chron (C2r) to Gauss Chron (C2An.1n), whic h is consistent with biostratigraphic constraints and the seismi c stratigraphic relationship to Site U1534 because we likely penetrated Reflector B toward the base of Hole U1535A.  

IW analyses show a typical diagenetic profile similar to observations made at neighboring Site U1534, with the characteristic signal of sulfate reduction in the uppermost $_{20\textrm{m}}$ and increasing ammonium, alkalinity, and barium concentrations below. Total organi c carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and calcium carbonate content s range from 0.4 to $1.4\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , from 0.02 to $0.15\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , and from 0.1 to 4 9 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively.  

Two formation temperature measurements were made wit h Cores 382-U1535A-4H and 7H. The geothermal heat flow was estimated using formation temperature measurements with thermal conductivity core measurements.  

The mid- to late Pleistocene interval is more condensed at Sit e U1535 than at Site U1534; a $^{3\textrm{m}}$ thick light green-gray carbonat e ooze interpreted to be MIS 11 occurs at ${\sim}25$ mbsf at Site U153 5 compared with ${\sim}40$ mbsf at Site U1534. This depth is consisten t with Seismic Reflector A representing the foraminifer ooze of MI S 11 also observed at Site U1534. Visual core descriptions noted tha t transitions in and out of the MIS 11 foraminifer ooze and other interglacial intervals at Site U1535 are abrupt relative to those at Sit e U1534, suggesting the presence of multiple hiatuses. Biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic interpretation is limited by these hiatuses but is consistent with a mid- to early Pleistocene age of th e sediments between Reflectors A and B. Reflector B occurs at 9 8 mbsf at Site U1535 based on the correlation to seismic profiles an d changes in the physical properties records at this depth. At Sit e U1534, the oldest sediments recovered above Reflector B are likel y no older than $0.78\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , so the recovery of older sediments above Reflector B at Site U1535 shows that the uppermost unit of the drif t onlaps Reflector B. It is also noted from the seismic data that th e most distal part of the uppermost unit of the drift is truncated, which is consistent with the more common occurrence of hiatuse s at Site U1535.  

Records from Site U1535 will be most useful for understandin g the dynamics of the evolution of the drift. The more continuous, generally higher resolution records from Site U1534 will be preferred for paleoceanographic studies from the drift.  

# Site U1536  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1536 is located $235\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the South Orkney Islands at $59^{\circ}26.46^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $41^{\circ}3.66^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ in $3220\;\mathrm{m}$ of water (Table T1). Sit e U1536 is the first of two sites drilled in Dove Basin in the souther n Scotia Sea. This site was targeted to recover a complete Neogen e record of Antarctic ice and ocean dynamics, examine the characte r and age of regionally correlative seismic horizons/discontinuities, and date the acoustic basement to constrain the tectonic origin o f Dove Basin.  

Previous piston coring at Site MD07-3134 in a small subbasin i n the northeastern part of Dove Basin recovered a $58\;\mathrm{m}$ long, high accumulation rate sediment record covering the last glacial cycle (Weber et al., 2012). Site U1536 is located $23\;\mathrm{km}$ east of that site in th e deeper part of a broad basin and on the western flank of a north– south ridge.  

Sediments in the southern Scotia Sea are primarily deposited b y contourite currents along the pathway of the ACC and AABW. Specifically in Dove Basin, contourite deposition is also assumed to b e influenced by WSDW flowing from the south through bathymetri c gaps around the South Orkney Plateau after exiting the Weddell Se a (Maldonado et al., 2003). The contourites are lens-shaped in seismi c profiles, as thick as $1\,\mathrm{km}$ in the center of small troughs (Maldonad o et al., 2006), and thin toward the edges of the troughs.  

Three seismic lines indicate a basin-like structure with severa l small-scale ridges and continuous reflections in the central t o northern part of Dove Basin. Site U1536 is located at Shotpoint (SP ) 1709 on Multichannel Seismic (MCS) Reflection Profile SCA N 10/04. The five seismic units that encompass deposition abov e acoustic basement (Maldonado et al., 2006; Pérez et al., 2017 ) served as a framework for drilling. The seismic reflections sho w parallel lamination with occasionally undulating structures, whic h is indicative of minor synsedimentary downslope transport (Figur e F3). This downslope movement is a fairly common feature in th e basin (Pérez et al., 2016), and none of the Expedition 382 propose d sites were able to avoid these disturbances completely. Site U153 6 provided the best compromise between a relatively thick and undisturbed stratigraphic sequence for climate studies and access t o acoustic basement, which was located at a relatively shallow dept h of ${\sim}900$ mbsf.  

At Site U1536, the main objective was to obtain a complete lat e Neogene record of ice and ocean dynamics in the center of Iceber g Alley in the more southerly of our two drilling areas in the Scoti a Sea. Specific objectives include (1) the reconstruction of past variability in AIS mass loss and its related sea level history, (2) a study o f the water mass composition of the Drake Passage throughflow an d WSDW inflow, and (3) a study of north–south shifts of the fronta l systems in response to changing climate conditions, includin g changes in water mass properties, ocean temperature, and sea ic e extent. An additional goal was to reconstruct changes in dust-climate couplings between Patagonia and Antarctica as well as relate d atmospheric circulation changes throughout the Pliocene–Pleistocene in a more distal location relative to the source (e.g., Patagonia). A final science objective at Site U1536 was to drill through th e deeper units/discontinuities, specifically the basin-wide Reflector c, to determine the age of this unconformity. This determinatio n would allow us to date the regional change in bottom water flow, which probably led to the formation of the discontinuity. We wer e not able to reach acoustic basement at ${\sim}900$ mbsf to determine it s nature and age.  

# Operations  

We arrived at Site U1536 at $0430~\mathrm{h}$ local time on 6 April 201 9 (Figure F6) after making two $3.5\:\mathrm{kHz}$ survey profiles over the site i n a cross shape, each $4~\mathrm{nmi}$ long along the site survey seismic lines. The start of coring was delayed by bad weather and mechanical difficulties with the APC bottom-hole assembly (BHA) that starte d when the “pig” pipe-cleaning device was not fully pumped out of th e bottom of the pipe, which caused a series of misfires of the pisto n corer necessitating a pipe trip back to the ship to inspect the BHA.  

Hole U1536A started at $0005\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 April. Cores 382-U1536A1F through 53F penetrated from the seafloor to 354.4 mbsf and recovered $364.3\mathrm{~m~}(103\%)$ (Figure F7). At $2115~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 April, an iceberg approached within $5.7\ \mathrm{nmi}$ of the ship, so we stopped corin g and raised the drill string to 50 mbsf. When the iceberg was $1.7\;\mathrm{nmi}$ away, we raised the drill string above the seafloor and moved ${\sim}1$ nmi east-northeast to avoid its path, ending operations in Hol e U1536A.  

Hole U1536B started at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 April. Cores 382-U1536B1H through 25H penetrated from the seafloor to 226.1 mbsf and recovered $230.7\;\mathrm{m}$ $(102\%)$ . At $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 April, we started to rais e the drill string because of a large iceberg and a flotilla of smaller icebergs around it. At $1325\,\mathrm{h}$ , the drill string cleared the seafloor, ending Hole U1536B.  

Hole U1536C started at $2035\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 April. Cores 382-U1536C1H through 40F (and drilled intervals 31, 91, 111, 131, 161, and 271, which advanced $144.0\,\mathrm{~m~}$ without recovery) penetrated from th e seafloor to 352.0 mbsf and recovered $187.4~\mathrm{m}$ $90\%$ of the cored interval). The aim of Hole U1536C was to spot core the upper sectio n to fill gaps in the stratigraphy recovered in Holes U1536A an d U1536B and then core continuously from 224 mbsf down. After taking Core 37F (341 mbsf) late on 15 April, coring was interrupted fo r $^{8\,\mathrm{h}}$ by an iceberg passing through the red zone. We were able to advance to 352.0 mbsf, but then another iceberg entered the red zon e and we had to end Hole U1536C.  

Hole U1536D started at $1940\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 April. Core 382-U1536D1H penetrated from the seafloor to 6.9 mbsf. The core liner shattered, and the core had to be pumped out of the barrel, so it coul d not be used for the intended purpose of IW sampling. We ende d Hole U1536D and raised the drill string to the ship to change to th e rotary core barrel (RCB) BHA.  

Hole U1536E started at $2140~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 April. We drilled withou t recovery to 312 mbsf, and at $0850\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 April we deployed a freefall funnel (FFF). We then continued to drill down to 340 mbsf, jus t shallower than the depth reached in Holes U1536A and U1536C.  

We started coring Hole U1536E at $2000~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 April. Core s 382-U1536E-2R through 33R penetrated from 340.0 to 645.4 mbs f and recovered $113.3\mathrm{~m~}$ $(36\%)$ . Coring was interrupted four times, three times by icebergs and once by bad weather conditions. Two o f the icebergs forced us to pull out of the hole and then reenter guide d by the subsea camera. At $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 April, after recovering Cor e 33R $\mathrm{(645.4\mbsf)}$ , we decided to stop coring and log the hole. Th e “quad combo” logging tool string consisted of tools to measure MS,

NGR, electrical resistivity, sonic velocity, and density of the formation. Starting at $0830~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 April, we made downlog and uplo g passes with the tool string, reaching 643 mbsf $\left[\sim\!3\;\mathrm{m}\right]$ above the bottom of the hole). Ship heave was ${\sim}2.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ during logging, whic h caused depth discrepancies of a similar magnitude in the loggin g data. The logging tools were disassembled by $1515~\mathrm{h},$ , and the dril l string was raised to the ship, which completed operations in Hol e U1536E.  

# Principal results  

APC cores from Holes U1536A–U1536C provide near-continuous stratigraphic coverage to 354 mbsf, and RCB cores from Hol e U1536E provide $\sim\!36\%$ coverage from 340 to 645 mbsf (Figures F5, F8). Based on the recovered sediments, three major lithostratigraphic units (I–III from top to bottom) were identified (Figure F8). Unit I (seafloor to ${\sim}250\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) consists of interbedded diatom ooze s and silty clays. Diatom oozes dominate the sediment from the seafloor to 120 mbsf. The terrigenous component in the oozes is generally below $25\%$ , and the biogenic component (mainly diatoms) in th e silty clays typically exceeds $25\%$ of the sediment. Unit II $({\sim}250{-}550$ mbsf) is almost exclusively silty clay with varying amounts of biosilica. Lithification increases downhole. Unit III ( $\mathord{\sim}550$ mbsf to th e base of Hole U1536E at 643 mbsf) consists of semi- to fully lithifie d mudstone, some with biosilica, and beds of limestone, some o f which are nannofossil bearing to nannofossil rich. Throughout th e cores, gravel- to pebble-sized IBRD is rare to common and clearl y visible in the core X-ray images. A noticeably higher abundance o f dropstones was observed from ${\sim}435$ to 568 mbsf.  

Diatom, radiolarian, foraminifer, and palynomorph biostratigraphic results are consistent for all samples from Holes U1536A, U1536C, and U1536E. We recorded 81 biostratigraphic events, based on which we estimate sedimentation rates of ${\sim}15\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ fro m the seafloor to 250 mbsf $(\sim\!1.5\,\mathrm{{Ma})}$ and ${\sim}5.4\;\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from 250 to 62 0 mbsf $({\sim}8.4\mathrm{\Ma})$ . A hiatus between Samples 382-U1536E-30R-C C and 31R-CC $({\sim}620~\mathrm{mbsf})$ leaves a biostratigraphic gap spannin g ${\sim}13.2{-}8.4\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . No hiatuses were observed in the Pleistocene (seafloor to $320~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) or Pliocene $320{-}450~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) stratigraphic sections. Samples for the analysis of aDNA were collected from th e upper $178~\mathrm{m}$ with high-resolution Holocene sampling in the uppe r $15\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

All paleomagnetic polarity zones of the 2012 geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS2012) were identified in the APC-cored intervals of Site U1536 through the lower Gauss Chron (C1n– $\mathrm{C2An.3n;\;3.3{-}3.6\ M a_{.}}$ ), and polarity transitions were recovered fo r all polarity zone boundaries except the upper Kaena boundar y (C2An.1r) (Figures F5, F9). Despite discontinuous recovery in th e RCB cores, we used initial biostratigraphic data to make tentativ e ties to the GPTS2012 for intervals between Chrons C2Ar and C3A n  

Figure F7. Drilling plan, Expedition 382. After transiting from Punta Arenas to Subantarctic Front, Sites U1534 and U1535 were drilled over 5 operational days a t beginning of expedition. After transiting to southernmost working area at Dove Basin, Site U1536 was drilled. It took 21 days to achieve APC/HLAPC and RC B coring as well as logging. Site U1537 was then drilled in 7 days. After transiting north to Pirie Basin, Site U1538 was drilled over 10 days. A total of $3228\;\mathrm{m}$ ove r 18 holes was cored during Expedition 382 with an overall core recovery of $2810\,\mathsf{m}$ .

$(3.60{-}6.03\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). Below this range, we observed intervals of norma l and reversed polarity that may potentially be correlated with th e GPTS2012 in postcruise work.  

Samples for headspace gas, IW chemistry, and bulk sedimen t geochemistry were analyzed from Holes U1536A and U1536E. Headspace methane concentrations are generally low (2–4.6 part s per million by volume [ppmv]) throughout the sedimentary sequence. Ethane, propane, and other higher molecular weight hydrocarbons are below the detection limit. Site U1536 is characterize d by moderately reducing sedimentary conditions, as indicated by th e disappearance of dissolved sulfate concentrations at ${\sim}100$ mbsf an d a reappearance of resolvable dissolved sulfate at $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf. The reducing conditions associated with this microbially mediated sulfat e reduction in the upper section exert strong control over the IW profiles of several parameters measured on board, including alkalinity, Ca, $\mathrm{PO}_{4}.$ , Ba, Sr, and Mn. Bulk sediment TOC and TN contents ar e generally low, with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to $0.8\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ an d from 0.02 to $0.09\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively.  

Physical property records reflect the lithology of the sediments. Silty clay–bearing diatom ooze, interpreted to be interglacial sediment, shows high $P.$ -wave velocity $P_{\|}$ -wave logger [PWL]) value s and low gamma ray attenuation (GRA) density, NGR, and MS values. Also, the color reflectance component $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ (the variability between yellow and blue) shows more yellowish colors for the diatomrich interglacial periods. Variability in $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ has been shown to be  a good indicator for temporal variability of biogenic opal over the las t glacial cycle in sediments from the Scotia Sea (Sprenk et al., 2013). The glacial–interglacial cyclicity of $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ reveals high-amplitude variations since the mid-Brunhes transition (MBT) around ${\sim}0.43\mathrm{~Ma}$ , thus following a global pattern of higher amplitude climate variability post-MBT (Barth et al., 2018) above ${\sim}90$ mbsf. $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ shows medium-amplitude variability between ${\sim}90$ and 181 mbsf (\~1.1–0.4 3  

Ma) and low-amplitude, higher frequency variability below tha t back to $3.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The combination of robust biomagnetostratigraphy and highresolution records of MS, GRA, NGR, and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is used to assign glacial and interglacial periods, providing a strong time-stratigraphi c framework for this site. Furthermore, MS, a presumed dust proxy a t the sites from Iceberg Alley (Weber et al., 2012, 2018) shows distinc t $100~\mathrm{ky}$ peaks representing glacial periods that can be correlated i n great detail with the dust record of Antarctic ice cores (e.g., to th e EPICA Dome C record of Lambert et al. [2008]) over the last $800\,\mathrm{ky}$ . An excellent late Pliocene–middle Pleistocene section was recovered that will allow in-depth study of the impact of the initiatio n of Northern Hemisphere glaciation on the Southern Ocean. An extended record of the early Pleistocene will allow us to assess th e provenance and flux of IBRD prior to the MPT. Although limite d carbonate material is available to work with, the rich record of IBR D and biosiliceous fossils combined with an excellent magnetostratigraphy should make this sequence suitable for in-depth paleoceanographic  studies.  Although  discontinuously  cored  and  heavil y disturbed, the Miocene sequence should also provide an importan t window into the earlier glaciation history of Antarctica.  

A continuous spliced record was constructed from Hole s U1536A–U1536C for the top $243\mathrm{~m~}$ core composite depth belo w seafloor, Method A (CCSF-A) (Figure F9). Three intervals appear t o contain slumped sediment. Two occur at ${\sim}40{-}50$ and 95–100 mbsf, and one occurs below the splice at about 299–301 mbsf.  

A quad combo tool string was used for downhole logging i n Hole U1536E to obtain as much data as possible in a single tool string run because of deteriorating sea conditions and the risk o f icebergs. The logging tools measured MS, gamma ray spectra, electrical resistivity, $P_{-}$ and $S{\mathrm{.}}$ -wave velocity, and density. These in sit u measurements successfully cover data gaps in core recovery an d  

Figure F8. Principal lithology, Expedition 382. Hole U1536E reached middle Miocene strata. All other holes cover Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments. Lithology i s dominated by silty clays with interbedded diatom ooze (Scotia Sea) or nannofossil ooze (Subantarctic Front). APC/HLAPC core recovery was almost complete.

complement the core measurements made in the laboratory. Bot h core and downhole density and $P$ -wave velocity values generally increase with depth, reflecting downhole sediment compaction.  

Integrating the core stratigraphy with the MCS profiles usin g the core and log velocity data to transform depths to two-wa y traveltimes, we identified Reflector $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{b}}$ at $\mathord{\sim}365$ mbsf in Core 382- U1536E-4R. This reflector corresponds to relative minima in PW L and GRA. We were also able to identify Reflector c, a central objective of the expedition, at ${\sim}530$ mbsf in Core 22R. It is characterize d by a sharp increase in PWL values. Determining ages for these basin-wide reflectors will be important in the assessment of the geodynamic history of the Scotia Sea.  

# Site U1537  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1537 is located $265\;\mathrm{km}$ northwest of the South Orkney Islands at $59^{\circ}6.65^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $40^{\circ}54.37^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ , in $3713\mathrm{~m~}$ of water (Table T1). Th e site lies in the northeast part of Dove Basin in a ${\sim}1\,\mathrm{km}$ thick contourite drift and is situated at SP 4900 on MCS Reflection Profile SCA N $2014/07$ (Figure F3) $5~\mathrm{km}$ west-northwest of Crossing Line SCA N 10/04. The objective at Site U1537 was to obtain a second sedimentary record in Dove Basin with a similar overall seismic structur e (Units I–V) but with less stratigraphic disturbance than observed a t Site U1536. This site was originally an alternate site but was selecte d for drilling because the uppermost $\mathord{\sim}150\mathrm{~m~}$ of the stratigraphy appeared to be uninterrupted by the thin slumped intervals observe d at the other possible sites in Dove Basin (as seen in the seismic an d echo sounder profiles). The goals were to reach Reflector b at ${\sim}350$ mbsf and to reconstruct the Pliocene–Pleistocene ice and ocean dynamics.  

Sediments in the southern Scotia Sea are primarily deposited b y contourite currents along the pathway of the ACC and AABW. Specifically in Dove Basin, contourite deposition is also assumed to b e influenced by WSDW flowing from the south through bathymetri c gaps around the South Orkney Plateau after exiting the Weddell Se a (Maldonado et al., 2003). The contourites at Site U1537 are len s shaped in seismic profiles, as thick as $800\mathrm{~m~}$ in the center of th e small trough, and thin toward the eastern edge.  

Interpretation of Seismic Line $2004/07$ identified Reflectors a, b , and c (Pérez et al., 2017) (Figure F3). In Dove Basin, three seismi c lines indicate a basin-like structure with several small-scale ridge s and continuous reflections in the central to northern part of the basin. The seismic reflections show overall parallel lamination wit h occasionally undulating structures, indicative of minor synsedimentary downslope transport (Pérez et al., 2016). This downslop e movement is a fairly common feature in the basin, and none of th e Expedition 382 proposed sites were able to avoid these disturbance s completely.

At Site U1537, the main objective was to obtain a late Neogen e record of ice and ocean dynamics from the center of Iceberg Alley i n the more southerly of our two drilling areas in the Scotia Sea. Specific objectives include (1) the reconstruction of past variability i n AIS mass loss and the related sea level history, (2) a study of the water mass composition of the Drake Passage throughflow an d WSDW inflow, and (3) a study of north–south shifts of the fronta l systems in response to changing climate conditions includin g changes in water mass properties, ocean temperature, and sea ic e extent. An additional goal was to reconstruct changes in dust-climate couplings between Patagonia and Antarctica as well as relate d atmospheric circulation changes throughout the Pliocene–Pleistocene in a distal location relative to the source (e.g., Patagonia).  

# Operations  

We arrived at Site U1537 at $0515~\mathrm{h}$ local time on 26 April 201 9 (Figure F6). We started to make up the APC BHA, but high heav e and roll forced us to pause operations for ${\sim}7\,\mathrm{h}.$ . Additionally, we ha d to move ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{nmi}$ northwest to allow an iceberg to pass over the sit e location. Operations resumed at $1430~\mathrm{h}$ , and we lowered the dril l string to the seafloor.  

We started Hole U1537A at $0140~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 April at 3712.9 mbsl, as calculated from the mudline. Cores 382-U1537A-1H through 31 F penetrated from the seafloor to 264.0 mbsf and recovered $268.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(102\%)$ (Figure F7). After Core 26H was difficult to pull out of th e formation and had to be drilled over, we switched to HLAPC corin g for Core 27F at 240.0 mbsf. An iceberg moved into the red zone a t $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 April, so we raised the drill string to 38 mbsf. At 202 0 h after further encroachment of the iceberg, we ended Hol e U1537A. Although we could not core at depth in Hole U1537A, w e could take a mudline core because this operation does not requir e the drill string to be below the seafloor and the iceberg was not clos e enough to be in the termination zone.  

Hole U1537B started at $0010~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 April and consisted of  a single core taken for high-resolution IW sampling. Core 382- U1537B-1H penetrated from the seafloor to 7.4 mbsf.  

Hole U1537C started at $0135~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 April, and Cores 382- U1537C-1H and 2H penetrated from the seafloor to 15.3 mbsf an d recovered $11.9\mathrm{~m~}(78\%)$ . After the Core 2H liner shattered and tw o large icebergs entered the red zone at $0400\ \mathrm{h}_{:}$ , we decided to en d Hole U1537C. We raised the drill string clear of the seafloor an d moved aside in DP mode to let the icebergs pass. By $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ we wer e able to move back to the site location.  

Hole U1537D started at $1945\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 April. Cores 382-U1537D1H through 50F penetrated from the seafloor to 354.3 mbsf and recovered $349.0\ \mathrm{m}$ $(99\%)$ . We took two HLAPC cores (20F and 21F )  

across a hard layer in Hole U1537A at $\mathord{\sim}182$ mbsf before returnin g to full-length APC coring for Cores 22H–27H. Below 244 mbsf, th e formation was too hard for APC coring, so we used HLAPC corin g from that point to the bottom of the hole. Icebergs were monitore d on 30 April and 1 May, but none of them posed a hazard to operations. From 1345 to $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 May, we paused coring while monitoring an iceberg that was at the edge of the red zone, but it turne d away from the ship and we resumed coring. Because high winds an d swell were forecast for 3 May, we decided to end Hole U1537D i n the early evening of 2 May to leave enough time to raise the dril l string to the ship and also leave sufficient time for the coring an d logging program at the next site (U1538) in the Pirie Basin area. Th e bit cleared the seafloor at $2140\,\mathrm{h}$ and was raised to the ship by 103 0 h on 3 May, which completed operations in Hole U1537D.  

# Principal results  

Piston cores from Holes U1537A and U1537D provided nearcontinuous stratigraphic coverage to 264 and 354 mbsf, respectivel y (Figures F5, F8). Based on these cores, three major lithostratigraphic units were identified (Figure F8). Unit I (seafloor to $\mathord{\sim}180$ mbsf) consists of interbedded diatom ooze and silty clay. It is divided into three subunits depending on the relative abundance o f diatom ooze and silty clay. Unit II ( $\mathord{\sim}180$ to ${\sim}260~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) is almos t exclusively silty clay with varying amounts of biosilica and contain s discrete color-banded intervals. Unit III ( $\sim\!260$ to ${\sim}354~\mathrm{mbsf})$ i s more lithified and consists of interbedded silty clay and diato m ooze. It contains a series of slumps with inclined and folded bed s interbedded with horizontally layered sediment. Throughout th e cores, IBRD is rare to common and particularly visible in the cor e X-ray images as granule- to pebble-sized shapes with sharp edges. Bioturbation is also rare to common with abundant thin (millimete r thick), pyritized burrows visible in the X-ray images.  

Diatom, radiolarian, foraminifer, and palynomorph biostratigraphic results are consistent for all samples from Holes U1537 A and U1537D and show 61 biostratigraphic events. Based on thes e events, we estimate sedimentation rates of ${\sim}14.8~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ betwee n the seafloor and 180 mbsf $({\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and ${\sim}6.1\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from 180 mbs f to the base of Hole U1537D at 354 mbsf ${\sim}4.45$ to ${\sim}5.0\,M\mathbf{a}$ ). Diato m and radiolarian biostratigraphy indicates that Site U1537 has a continuous stratigraphy from the early Pliocene to the Holocene because no major hiatuses were detected. Diatoms and radiolarian s are considerably reworked, especially from 287 to 311 mbsf. Overal l preservation is relatively good in all samples, and fragmentation i s more common than dissolution in diatoms. Palynomorphs (dinocyst, acritarch, prasinophytes, pollen, spores, copepod, and fung i remains) were identified in the 23 samples processed for palynology. Dinocyst diversity is generally low with relative abundance varyin g from abundant/common in the upper $155~\mathrm{m}$ to few/barren in th e lower half of Holes U1537A and U1537D. An exception is Sample s 382-U1537D-38F-CC to 42F-CC (296–316 mbsf), which have a relatively high dinocyst abundance. A small number of samples (five ) were collected for the analysis of aDNA at Site U1537 with the primary purpose of investigating spatial variability in the genetic signals between this site and nearby Site U1536.  

All paleomagnetic polarity zones of the GPTS2012 were identified in the combined paleomagnetic records from Holes U1537 A and U1537D spanning the Brunhes Chron (C1n) to the base of th e Mammoth Subchron (C2An.2r; 3.33 Ma) (Figures F5, F9). Deepe r than Subchron C2An.2r, we measured $\sim\!5\;\mathrm{m}$ of normal polarity before slumped sediments become common, an interval we interpre t to be the early Gauss Chron (C2An.3n). This interpretation place s the base of sediment recovery at Site U1537 that is predominantl y not slumped between 3.33 and $3.60\,M{\bf a}$ on the GPTS2012. Interval s of slumped sediments underlie this normal polarity zone, but th e intervening flat-lying sediments include a polarity transition an d ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ of reversed directions, which we interpret to be the late Gilbert Chron (C2Ar). The two lowermost cores from Hole U1537 D (Cores 382-U1537D-49F and 50F) have scattered paleomagnetic directions and cannot be assigned to a polarity zone at this time. Thi s suggests that the base age for Hole U1537D above these two cores i s between 3.6 and $4.2\,M{\bf a}$ .  

Samples were collected for headspace gas and IW chemistr y analyses in Hole U1537A. Downhole profiles of headspace gas an d bulk inorganic and organic carbon at Site U1537 are very similar t o those from Site U1536. Methane concentrations in headspace ga s are low in all cores, and concentrations of ethane and propane ar e below the detection limit throughout the hole. Hole U1537A ha s relatively low contents of TOC, TN, and calcium carbonate. Sit e U1537 has comparable trends to Site U1536 but with some subtl e differences. The sulfate-depleted zone is significantly less expande d than at Site U1536, encompassing ${<}80\mathrm{~m~}$ . Dissolved Ba contents a t those depths are significantly lower than at Site U1536, and alkalinities reach $<\!30\;\mathrm{mM}$ (compared with almost $40\;\mathrm{mM}$ at Site U1536). Ammonium concentrations are also lower. Systematic Mg and K depletion downhole suggests that continuous authigenic clay formation  occurs  throughout  the  sediment  column.  Calcium  i s precipitated from IW in the upper section and replenished belo w the sulfate reduction zone. Other major and trace elements, such a s B, Si and Sr, increase downhole. Fe contents are generally low, whereas Mn is somewhat elevated in the uppermost $30\;\mathrm{m}$ . Overall, the observed geochemical patterns suggest only moderate diagenesis, which is encouraging for a variety of planned postcruis e geochemical analyses.  

Distinct cyclic changes were observed in physical property records in Holes U1537A and U1537D, especially for NGR and M S (Figure F9). These cycles are as long as $10~\mathrm{m}$ in the upper $180\textrm{m}$ . Below 180 mbsf, cycles are shorter, have lower amplitude, and ar e superimposed on longer scale changes. Cyclic changes are likel y controlled by insolation-driven climate variations and are useful fo r stratigraphic correlation. Downhole sediment compaction is reflected in the overall increasing trend in density and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocit y with depth. Step changes in the physical property records line u p with main discontinuities in seismic and echo sounder profiles. I n particular, a baseline increase in GRA density, MS, and NGR a t $\mathord{\sim}180$ mbsf is associated with Reflector b in the preexpedition seismic interpretation. Additionally, an increase in velocity and densit y observed at 230 mbsf is coincident with an increase in reflectivity i n the seismic data.  

# Site U1538  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1538 is located $365\;\mathrm{km}$ north-northeast of the South Orkney Islands at $57^{\circ}26.52^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $43^{\circ}21.47^{\prime}\mathrm{W},$ in $3131\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of water (Tabl e T1). The site lies in Pirie Basin and is situated at SP 4900 on Seismi c Reflection Profile SCAN 2013 13 9 km east of Crossing Line SCA N 2013 11 (Figure F2). Site U1538 is located in the center of a small basin and provides the most undisturbed stratigraphy among the si x potential drill sites in Pirie Basin. The seismic presite survey wa s conducted with a three-channel SPARKER system (Maldonado e t al., 2013), so the depth penetration and resolution of the profile i s limited compared to the MCS records of Dove Basin Sites U153 6 and U1537 and it is more difficult to follow prominent reflection s and assign seismic units. However, extended Pliocene–Pleistocen e sections (Seismic Units I and II) are expected. Identification of Reflector d and acoustic basement is questionable.  

Previous piston coring in Pirie Basin was conducted $9\;\mathrm{km}$ wes t of Site U1538 at Site MD07-3133 (alternate proposed Site SCO-01 ) along Seismic Line SCAN 2013 13. Site MD07-3133 recovered a 3 6 m long sediment core that reaches back to MIS 3, which implies tha t the high sedimentation rates observed at Dove Basin Sites U153 6 and U1537 could be doubled in Pirie Basin. However, Site MD07- 3133 is located at a rather marginal position of the small basin in th e northern Pirie Basin with potential seismic discontinuities belo w $\mathord{\sim}160$ mbsf. Therefore, Site U1538, in the central part of that basin, was chosen for drilling to achieve a mostly undisturbed recover y and the thickest Pleistocene section.  

Sediments in the southern Scotia Sea are primarily deposited b y contourite currents along the pathway of the ACC and AABW. Piri e Basin is located further north than Dove Basin closer to the core o f the ACC and is expected to be less influenced by WSDW. The contourites are generally lens shaped and have a total thickness of a s much as $1\ \mathrm{km}_{\ }$ , similar to the sediment deposition observed abov e basement in Dove Basin (Maldonado et al., 2006).  

At Site U1538, the main objective was to obtain a complete record of ice and ocean dynamics in the center of Iceberg Alley sinc e the late Neogene in the more northerly of our two drilling areas i n the Scotia Sea. Specific objectives in Pirie Basin include (1) the reconstruction of past variability in AIS mass loss and the related se a level history at a site with potentially more IBRD derived directl y from the Pacific side of the WAIS through clockwise transport i n the ACC; (2) the capture of the northern, more CDW-dominate d part of the Drake Passage throughflow and associated north–sout h shifts of frontal systems, water mass properties, ocean temperature, and sea ice extent; and (3) the reconstruction of changes in atmospheric circulation and dust-climate couplings between Patagoni a and  Antarctica  and  related  atmospheric  circulation  change s throughout the Pliocene–Pleistocene in a more proximal locatio n relative to the dust source (e.g., Patagonia).  

# Operations  

We arrived at Site U1538 at $0240~\mathrm{h}$ local time on 4 May 201 9 after the 127 nmi northwest transit from the Dove Basin area (Figure F6).  

We started Hole U1538A at 1615 h on 4 May. The seafloor dept h was $3130.6~\mathrm{mbsl},$ , as calculated from the mudline. Over the next  6 days, full-length APC/XCB Cores 382-U1538A-1H through 75 X penetrated from the seafloor to 676.0 mbsf and recovered $476.4~\mathrm{m}$ $(70\%)$ (Figure F7). Formation temperature measurements wer e made while taking Cores 6H, 9H, 12H, 15H, and 18H.  

At $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 May, after taking Core 382-U1538A-17H, an iceberg and a bergy bit entered the red zone, so we raised the dril l string to 45 mbsf and offset $35\;\mathrm{m}$ northwest to allow it to pass. Th e larger of the two icebergs was clear of the red zone at $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ , and w e lowered the drill string back to 159.8 mbsf and resumed coring. Because Core 30H was difficult to extract from the formation and required a drillover to retrieve it, we switched to HLAPC coring fo r Cores 31F–34F, reaching 294.4 mbsf.  

At that point, the hole was deep enough that we would want t o reenter it if forced off the site by an iceberg, so at $^{1720\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 6 Ma y we deployed a FFF to enable reentry. We resumed coring at $1830\,\mathrm{h}$ and took Core 382-U1538A-35F, which also required a drillover, s o we switched to XCB coring for the rest of Hole U1538A. From 130 0 to $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 May, we waited for a large iceberg to pass the edge o f the red zone (3 nmi from the ship) with the drill bit close to the bottom of the hole. After taking Core 66X (597.9 mbsf), coring was interrupted from 0415 to $0900~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 May when an iceberg passe d through the red zone. We raised the drill string to 45 mbsf an d waited until after it passed, as close as $1.2\,\mathrm{nmi}$ from the ship, befor e resuming coring. From 1930 to $2100\;\mathrm{h},$ , ship heave was about $4\textrm{m}$ which was too high to maintain a consistent weight on bit, so w e stood by and waited for heave to subside. The final cores from Hol e U1538A (Cores 69X–75X) were recovered without interruption. We stopped coring at $1315\ \mathrm{h}$ on 10 May after reaching the maximum depth of 676 mbsf permitted by the IODP Environmental Protection and Safety Panel for this site.  

We decided to forgo downhole logging in Hole U1538A becaus e ship heave exceeded $3\;\mathrm{m}$ and was forecast to become higher, whic h would pose a risk to the downhole logging tools and increase uncertainty in the depth registration of the logging data. Because the hol e has a FFF, it was possible to return to log it if sea and heave conditions became calmer before the end of operations at this site. W e displaced the hole with $10.5\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ heavy mud to help stabilize th e borehole walls in case we were able to log.  

We started Hole U1538B at $1900\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 10 May. Core 382- U1538B-1H recovered $7.8~\mathrm{m}$ and was sampled for IW at high resolution. We then offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to the south.  

We started Hole U1538C at $2135\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 10 May. Cores 382- U1538C-1H through 12H penetrated from the seafloor to 105. 9 mbsf and recovered $98.9\;\mathrm{m}\;(93\%)$ . One HLAPC core (6F) was take n to adjust the depth offset to splice over core breaks in Hole U1538A. At $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 May, the sea and wind conditions had deteriorate d to the extent that we could not safely handle the core barrel on th e rig floor. We waited with the drill string in the hole, but it was apparent that conditions would not improve soon, so at $1500~\mathrm{h}$ w e raised the drill string clear of the seafloor, ending Hole U1538C. The next $28.5\,\mathrm{h}$ were spent waiting on weather. The ship’s heave (th e maximum peak to peak heave over a $10\,\mathrm{\min}$ interval) remaine d above $5\textrm{m}$ until $1930~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 May. At that time, we were able t o resume rig floor operations.  

Hole U1538D started at $2145\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 May. Cores 382-U1538D1H through 14H penetrated from the seafloor to 126.4 mbsf and recovered $114.6\:\mathrm{m}\:(91\%)$ . A formation temperature measurement wa s made while taking Core 12H. We had to stop coring to leave time t o raise the drill string and secure the BHA for transit before storm y weather and high seas arrived early on 14 May. The last core cam e on deck at $1240\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 May, and the bit was clear of the seafloor a t $1430\,\mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1538D.  

Having completed operations at Site U1538, we started the se a voyage to Punta Arenas, Chile, at $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 May. We had to leav e Site U1538 earlier than originally planned because of deterioratin g weather and sea conditions. Our course took us over the first tw o sites of the expedition (Sites U1534 and U1535), but headwind s slowed our progress to the extent that no time was available for further coring at Site U1534 (average speed was $3.7~\mathrm{kt}$ on $14\mathrm{\May})$ . However, we had time to make a single-line $3.5\,\mathrm{kHz}$ subbottom profiler survey east–west over the two sites on 17 May. We then continued to Punta Arenas. The $1088\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ voyage took 5.6 days at a n average speed of $7.7\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The pilot boarded at $0754\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 May nea r the entrance to the Strait of Magellan, and we arrived at Prat Terminal in Punta Arenas, Chile, at $1530\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , ending Expedition 382.  

# Principal results  

The lithology at Site U1538 is divided into two units (Figure F8). Lithostratigraphic Unit I (seafloor to 308 mbsf) consists of dar k  

Figure F10. Examples of major lithologies of sediments from Iceberg Alley, Site U1538. (C) Interbedded silty clays and (A) diatom oozes change with lithificatio n to (B) diatomite and (D) lithified silty clay. Pliocene deposits contain more (E) IBRD layers and (F) laminations.  

![](images/b9b33a2ecca01a61b73e83a19c93210b30fd2ac71a340081e80a7bdd25b88625.jpg)  

greenish gray silty clay–rich and silty clay–bearing diatom ooze alternating with diatom-rich and diatom-bearing silty clay (Figur e F10). Some intervals of diatom ooze are over $^{20\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick. IBR D dropstones are small and rare on the split core surface, but more o f them are evident in the core X-ray images, illustrating the value o f the $\mathrm{\DeltaX}$ -ray technique. From $\mathord{\sim}38$ to 39 mbsf and from $\mathord{\sim}122$ to 12 4 mbsf, dispersed diagenetic carbonate occurs in layers $>\!50\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick. Similar diagenetic carbonate was found at Sites U1536 and U153 7 as discrete millimeter- to centimeter-thick layers. Unit II is distinguished by increased compaction (semilithified silty clay and diatomite) and an increase in the abundance, size, and lithology o f gravel- and pebble-sized IBRD. In Unit II, distinct layers of enriche d IBRD were observed. Thin $(<\!5\;\mathrm{cm})$ diagenetic carbonate layers an d lenses are present at ${\sim}351$ and $\mathord{\sim}504$ mbsf.  

Diatoms and radiolarians were found in all core catcher samples, and additional samples were collected from selected depths (Figur e F11), allowing us to identify 75 biostratigraphic events. Based o n these events, we estimate sedimentation rates of ${\sim}22\ \mathrm{cm/ky}$ between the seafloor and 432 mbsf $({\sim}1.75\,\mathrm{\Ma})$ , followed by ${\sim}2.5$ $\mathrm{cm/ky}$ from 432 to 469 mbsf $\left(\sim\!3.6\,M\mathbf{a}\right)$ , and finally ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{cm/ky}$ fro m 447 mbsf to the base of Hole U1538A. The deepest sample reveale d that sediments recovered at this site date back to ${\sim}4.2{-}4.7\,\mathrm{\Ma}$ . Overall preservation is relatively good in all samples, and only limited reworking of diatoms was detected.  

Palynomorphs  (dinocyst,  acritarch,  prasinophytes,  pollen, spores, copepod, and fungi remains) were identified in all 30 samples processed for palynology. Dinocyst diversity is generally lo w with varying abundance throughout. Reworked pollen and spore s were found throughout, whereas in situ specimens were only detected in certain intervals. Samples for the analysis of aDNA wer e also collected from the upper $84\,\mathrm{m}$ and are anticipated to record th e Holocene and the last interglacial.  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1538 involved measurement of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archiv e halves from all holes before and after demagnetization to a peak alternating field (AF) of $15~\mathrm{mT}$ . All discrete samples from Site U153 8 were subjected to AF demagnetization at 5, 10, and $15~\mathrm{mT}$ to verif y the archive-half measurements. Directional data agree well betwee n archive-half and discrete samples in APC and HLAPC cores. XC B cores often have a large amount of scatter in archive-half measurements, making those data difficult to interpret. However, discret e samples taken from large, intact pieces in the XCB cores appear t o reliably record the polarity and can be used for magnetostratigraphy. We identified polarity zones from the Brunhes Chron (C1n ) to the middle Gilbert Chron (C3n; tentatively the Sidufjall Subchron, $4.8–4.9\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) (Figure F9). However, not all polarity zones o f the GPTS2012 were identified, including subchrons in Chron s C2An (Gauss Chron) and C3n (middle Gilbert Chron). This is probably a result of discontinuous recovery and the slow sedimentatio n rate between ${\sim}1.75$ and $3.6\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The presence of the iron sulfid e mineral greigite is suspected in some intervals and likely complicates the paleomagnetic record in intervals of the middle Pleistocene.  

In Hole U1538A headspace gas analyses, methane is the dominant hydrocarbon and is present only in low concentrations $(2.0-$ ${5.4\,\mathrm{ppmv}})$ , whereas ethane $\left({\sf C}_{2}{\sf H}_{6}\right)$ concentration is below the detection limit. Also, we found relatively low inorganic carbon (0.2–0.7 5 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ), TN $(0.04{-}0.23\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ , and $C a C O_{3}$ $(0.02\mathrm{-}4.2\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ ) contents.  

IW geochemical data were generated on 40 samples from Hol e U1538A to 671 mbsf. The inorganic geochemical data from Sit e U1538 fall at the more extreme end of IW properties observe d during Expedition 382. Although the cores are not methanogenic, sulfate is depleted below 60 mbsf. Minor dissolved sulfate concentrations were detected below $500~\mathrm{mbsf}$ $(\mathrm{SO}_{4}<\!1.5\ \upmu\mathrm{M})$ . Significan t organic matter degradation is apparent in the upper $120\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , with elevated phosphate concentrations and a pronounced $\mathrm{Br/Cl}$ gradient. Barite dissolution is evident at depths without resolvable sulfate between 60 and 445 mbsf, resulting in the highest dissolved bariu m concentrations of the Expedition 382 sites. The spatial evolution o f Ba enrichment also differs from the previous sites in that Ba concentrations are above $600~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ from 250 to 500 mbsf before mor e rapidly decreasing within a few tens of meters underneath this zone.

Dissolved Mn enrichment is observable in the uppermost $50\textrm{m}$ a t Site U1538, followed by Fe enrichment below, suggesting Mn-Fe oxide mobilization in the upper $260\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Calcium concentrations decrease significantly from 11.7 to $1.9\ \mathrm{mM}$ in the sulfate reductio n zone, recover to stable intermediate concentrations throughout th e upper half of Site U1538, and become enriched deeper in the hole. Together with equally increasing B and Sr concentrations, this enrichment suggests increasing exchange reactions between the dissolved and solid phases in the older sediments. Although chlorid e concentrations decrease with depth together with IW salinity, sodium concentrations increase. Authigenic clay formation is apparent in decreasing potassium and magnesium concentrations in th e deeper parts of Site U1538. In comparison to the IW profiles fro m Scotia Sea Sites U1536 and U1537, these data highlight the more exotic character of the profiles from Site U1538.  

The Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) was used t o measure GRA bulk density, MS, and $P$ -wave velocity at $1\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals, which is a higher spatial resolution than the $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ spacin g used at the other sites. Section halves were scanned on the X-Ra y Imager (XRI). Discrete measurements collected in section halves included at least three $P.$ -wave velocity measurements per core an d 150 thermal conductivity measurements (two to three per core). Moisture and density measurements were made on 145 discret e samples from Hole U1538A. Light reflectance and MS point measurements were collected at $1~\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals on section halves fro m Cores 382-U1538A-1H through 35F and at $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ from the remaining cores from this site. Formation temperature measurement s taken with Cores 6H, 9H, 12H, $15\mathrm{H}$ , and 18H with the APCT- 3 yielded temperatures of $4.85^{\circ}{-}13.8^{\circ}C$ .  

In the upper $220\,\mathrm{~m~}$ , physical property records have $10{-}20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long amplitude cycles (e.g., bulk density values cycle from lows o f $1.2\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to highs of $1.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and NGR values cycle from lows o f $10\;\mathrm{count/s}$ to highs of $40\;\mathrm{count/s)}$ ) (Figure F9). Below 220 mbsf, th e cycles have shorter periods and slightly lower amplitudes but are superimposed on longer scale baseline changes. An exception is th e high-amplitude MS cycles from 310 to 450 mbsf underlain by lo w baseline MS values from 450 to 550 mbsf. The overall cycles an d patterns are comparable in amplitude and thickness to those seen a t Sites U1536 and U1537 in Dove Basin to the southwest. Downhol e sediment compaction is reflected in increased density and $P$ -wav e velocity with depth. An increase in baseline values of NGR, density, and $P$ -wave velocity is associated with a change in the seismic facie s at ${\sim}370$ mbsf. A spliced record for Site U1538 was constructed for the uppermost $124\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF-A from Holes U1538A, U1538C, and U1538D. I t is based predominantly on correlation of MS and GRA density data. Integrating the core stratigraphy with the seismic profiles usin g discrete sample caliper velocity data to transform depths to twoway traveltime, we identified Reflector $\mathbf{a}^{\prime}$ at $\mathord{\sim}77$ mbsf in Core 382- U1538A-10H. This reflector separates the higher variability of physical properties above from lower variability below. A more detaile d acoustic to core correlation based on data obtained with the TOPA S subbottom profiler was possible in the upper ${\sim}135\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of Hol e U1538A (Figure F4). Accordingly, besides identifying Reflector $\mathbf{a}^{\prime}$ , additional reflectors could be correlated with changes in physica l properties at ${\sim}13$ , 45, and 90 mbsf. Assuming a depth to two-wa y traveltime conversion based on the caliper velocity measurements, Reflector a was identified by a decrease in GRA density at $\mathord{\sim}371$ mbsf in Core 43X. Reflector b was observed at ${\sim}513$ mbsf in Cor e 57X. We were also able to identify Reflector c by a sharp increase i n WRMSL $P$ -wave velocity at ${\sim}575$ mbsf in Core 64X. Determinin g ages for these basin-wide reflectors will be important in the assessment of the geodynamic history of the Scotia Sea.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Operational considerations related to the science objectives  

The operations plan for Expedition 382 laid out in the Scientifi c Prospectus (Weber et al., 2018) considered the maximum amount o f possible coring if no hazards occurred. However, operating east o f the Drake Passage in the center of Iceberg Alley and near the Antarctic sea ice edge involves a number of potential hazards, in particular icebergs and bad weather. Indeed, high waves and consequen t high ship heave were a major challenge when drilling in both th e Dove and Pirie Basins and prohibited coring for $62~\mathrm{~h~}$ (2.6 days ) while waiting on weather. This calculation, however, does not include the time necessary to reenter a hole. An overview of the actua l operations times and activities is given in Figure F6.  

Another potential hazard was sea ice. Detailed analyses of dail y sea ice maps for the years 2012–2017 indicated that Antarctic se a ice advances north during the months of April and May. Reassessment during coring operations at the Subantarctic Front site s showed that the sea ice edge was ${\sim}300~\mathrm{km}$ south of Site U1536 i n early April 2019 and moving north at more than $10~\mathrm{km}$ per day. Hence, we changed plans and went directly to the southernmos t Dove Basin rather than drilling first in the more northerly locate d Pirie Basin, knowing that we would need at least 16 operational day s at Site U1536 and ${\sim}12$ days to drill a second site in Dove Basin. I n the end, the sea ice edge did not approach close enough to influenc e our operations in Dove Basin.  

The biggest potential threat and also the most unpredictabl e were icebergs. Naturally, with the main focus on reconstructin g Antarctic iceberg flux in the center of Iceberg Alley, this hazard wa s expected. However, icebergs do not break off the Antarctic continent at a preferred time of the year, nor do they travel in a seasonal pattern north. The fact that there is also interannual variability i n iceberg shedding made it impossible to predict iceberg concentrations for the time of the drilling operations in Iceberg Alley befor e the expedition. Also, the real-time information available from satellite data during the expedition was not of sufficient resolution to allow for detailed planning. Therefore, during the expedition, iceber g observation relied almost entirely on visual and radar observations. This limited our ability to plan ahead more than $10{-}15\,\mathrm{h}$ when icebergs were in radar range and required us to adapt our operation s continuously. When icebergs entered a red zone (less than 3 mile s from the ship or less than twice the time required to raise the bi t clear of the seafloor), drilling operations stopped and the drill strin g was pulled up to 50 mbsf. When an iceberg entered a 1 mile radiu s and was heading toward the ship, we pulled out of the hole; thi s happened three times. During Expedition 382, we spent $159~\mathrm{h}$ (5. 3 days) waiting on ice, which does not include the time required t o reenter and return to the bottom of a hole (Figure F6). Additionally , there was a 2 day delay related to strong winds that prohibited fueling at the begin of the expedition.  

# Preliminary assessment of scientific objectives  

The scientific objectives of Expedition 382 center around fou r thematic investigations of the late Neogene: the ice mass loss history of the AIS, the regional atmospheric circulation and dust transport, the flow of deep water through the Drake Passage, and th e AAIW transport beneath the Subantarctic Front. Based on a preliminary analysis of the core material and data collected during th e expedition, we assess the nine specific objectives that were formulated in the Scientific Prospectus (Weber et al., 2018).  

The majority of these objectives require continuous and highresolution sediment records for their investigation. We obtaine d continuous records reaching back to the Pliocene at three sites (Figure F8). The number of identifiable biostratigraphic events (firs t and last occurrences of microfossil species; Figure F11) ranges between 12 (Site U1534) and 81 (Sites U1536 and U1537), and the detection of all magnetic reversals since the mid-Pliocene indicat e robust stratigraphic continuity at the Scotia Sea sites for this tim e interval. Sedimentation rates are also generally high, ranging from  5 to $25~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ depending on the time interval and site (Figure F5) . This means that the majority of high-resolution physical and optical properties measured during the expedition (Figure F5) have a temporal resolution of several decades to a few centuries. This combination of stratigraphic continuity and highly resolved sedimen t records obtained for the first time in an important yet undersampled region with respect to past changes in AIS dynamics an d Southern Ocean paleoceanography is a very encouraging first resul t of our expedition. It is also an important prerequisite to fulfillin g the majority of our scientific goals.  

# 1. Reconstructing the history of AIS calving through time  

A reconstruction of AIS calving through time requires continuous records of IBRD. Using the new XRI, we took continuous images along all core sections, resulting in an impressive collection o f over 25,000 images. Initial counting of IBRD on these images confirmed that previous glacial terminations document AIS mass los s events similar to the last deglaciation (Weber et al., 2014). This i s very promising for postcruise research on glacial terminations, ove r glacial–interglacial cycles, and with respect to the long-term, Pliocene–Pleistocene ice mass loss history. Also, IBRD was observe d and documented in the lithologic descriptions at all sites. The X-ra y images will be used to direct the postcruise sampling of IBRD-ric h layers to study provenance (the potential source regions of IBR D and the icebergs that carried it). The available core material will als o be used for detailed grain size studies to obtain a further indicato r of IBRD variability. Equipped with such core material and data sets, we are confident we will be able to provide the first qualitative bu t detailed and long-term history of AIS mass loss via calving of icebergs.  

# 2. Chronology and dust-climate couplings  

The correlation of marine dust records to well-dated ice-cor e dust records has been a major step forward in developing high-resolution Southern Ocean chronologies (see Scientific objectives) . According to Weber et al. (2012), MS should provide such high-resolution chronological control at least for the late Pleistocene. At al l our Scotia Sea sites, highs in MS (i.e., more terrigenous material ) occur consistently during glacial periods for at least the last 3 My. Because our sites extend much further back in time than Antarcti c ice cores, we should have the ability to study dust-climate coupling s also during the Pliocene–Pleistocene. At Site U1538, the MS signa l is likely influenced by diagenetic overprint in deeper parts of th e sedimentary sections. Further dust proxies such as Ca and F e counts obtained through XRF scanning will be investigated postcruise for their stratigraphic potential. Also, higher values in colo r component $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ (i.e., more yellowish colors) are systematically associated with diatom-rich interglacial periods in the late Pleistocene. This relation, first established by Sprenk et al. (2013), will be teste d postcruise for its stratigraphic and paleoclimatic application.  

An important stratigraphic approach will be to correlate th e Scotia Sea sites before putting them on a common timescale. Variations in NGR provide reliable records that can be correlated in grea t detail between our sites in the given biomagnetic stratigraphic control (Figure F9). Also, GRA density records show distinct glacial– interglacial variability that was used for site-to-site and hole-to-hol e correlation. Time control provided by bio- and magnetic stratigraphy, possibly in combination with oxygen isotope stratigraphy, should allow us to put sediment physical property data older tha n the range of ice cores onto a robust chronology.  

# 3. AIS mass loss and regional-to-global sea level change  

This scientific objective requires the identification of glacial terminations that led to warmer-than-present times such as MISs 5, 11, 31, and so on. Our preliminary assessment of the core materia l shows that we have recovered a sedimentary record of these important times, and we should therefore be able to study the relatio n of AIS mass loss and global sea level change across terminations i n great detail. However, this specific objective also requires evaluatin g IBRD records in the context of near- and far-field geophysical se a level effects, such as glacial isostatic adjustment (see Scientific objectives), and will be pursued postcruise in collaboration with se a level modelers.  

# 4. Water mass changes and ocean thermal forcing  

Because we obtained long and continuous sediment records i n all three key regions (Subantarctic Front, Pirie Basin, and Dove Basin; Figure F1), we should be able to address past changes in th e AMOC and ocean temperature over the Pliocene–Pleistocene. However, these studies rely on a variety of biogeochemical investigations that will be conducted postcruise.  

# 5. Provenance of glacially eroded material  

The documentation of IBRD in $\mathrm{X}$ -ray images and sedimentologic descriptions provides IBRD concentration records to identif y IBRD-rich intervals that are suitable for postcruise research. Sand - to pebble-sized IBRD will be characterized using a variety of mineralogical, geochemical, and isotopic techniques for the purpose of establishing its provenance, which will provide valuable knowledge o f the sectors in Antarctica that previously underwent sustained ic e mass loss via calving.  

# 6. Glacial–interglacial sea ice shifts and the carbon cycle  

A prerequisite to conducting investigations on past sea ice shift s and potentially associated changes in the carbon cycle was to obtai n sediment records from different latitudes. We obtained sedimen t records that stretch from the Subantarctic Front in the north t o Dove Basin in the south (spanning ${\sim}6^{\circ}$ latitude). Also, the preservation of microfossils that can be used for such reconstructions is ver y good at our sites. In addition, we know rather precisely where glacial–interglacial transitions occur in the sediment record at least fo r the late Pleistocene. Therefore, we are optimistic that we will be abl e to reconstruct glacial–interglacial sea ice shifts.  

# 7. ACC flow speed reconstruction  

Core material was obtained to address this topic at three different locations. At the Subantarctic Front sites, grain size analysis an d orientation of the magnetic fabric will be used as proxy records o f past changes in flow speed and will inform us about changes in th e AAIW and the position of the front. In Pirie Basin, cores will provide information on changes associated with the core region of th e ACC. In the southern Dove Basin, the potentially higher influenc e of northward-flowing WSDW can be studied.  

8. Pliocene–Pleistocene ice age climate cycles and underlying causes All our sites, from the Subantarctic Front to the southern Scoti a Sea, will provide material that can be used to study Pliocene–Pleistocene climate evolution in the Southern Hemisphere and allow u s to test hypotheses about how orbital variations control global climate and ice volume. As described above, most of the physical property data sets obtained during the expedition have a sufficien t resolution and show distinct cyclicity that is likely to be related t o orbital changes. Initial bio- and magnetostratigraphy suggest tha t continuous high sedimentation rate sections were recovered.  

# Scientific objectives for the Subantarctic Front sites  

Recovering the MPT was highly anticipated at Sites U1534 an d U1535. Biostratigraphic markers and the absence of a magnetic reversal indicate that the silty clay deposits above Reflector B at Sit e U1534 are no older than $0.78\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Mid- to early Pleistocene sediments were recovered at deeper Site U1535, reflecting the onlapping nature of the uppermost sediment unit onto Reflector B; however, sediments were more condensed than at Site U1534, an d abrupt lithologic boundaries suggest multiple hiatuses at this mor e distal site. Despite providing a shorter time interval, mid- to lat e Pleistocene sedimentation at Site U1534 appears to be continuou s and on the order of $10\;\mathrm{cm/ky},$ and it would be the preferred site fo r high-resolution paleoceanographic study through the mid- to lat e Pleistocene. Although time did not allow three full-depth holes t o be cored, a fully spliced record was achieved above Reflector B a t Site U1534. The benthic foraminifer Uvigerina spp. is persisten t throughout the mid- to late Pleistocene and will yield stable isotop e and elemental ratio records to constrain an age model and reconstruct water mass properties at the site. Nannofossil-rich foraminifer oozes characterize MISs 5e and 11. There is high potential t o yield multiproxy, millennial-scale paleoceanographic reconstructions throughout the last ${\sim}0.78$ My at Site U1534.  

Paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic markers indicate that th e $170\,\textrm{m}$ of silty clay recovered between Reflectors B and C at Sit e U1534  is  of  late  Pliocene  age.  Seismic  interpretation,  paleomagnetics, and biostratigraphic markers indicate that sediments beneath Reflector B are contemporaneous at both Sites U1534 an d U1535. With sedimentation rates as high as $40~\mathrm{cm/ky}$ and prominent cyclicity evident in the physical properties, these late Pliocen e sediments will provide key insights into the evolution of the PIS an d dynamics of the cold water route while Northern and Souther n Hemisphere glaciation was intensifying.  

# Assessment of seismic reflectors  

During Expedition 382, we drilled through three structural seismic reflectors at the Subantarctic Front sites and through four of th e five reflectors that were previously used to classify and describe th e long-term history of the Scotia Sea. However, none of these reflectors were dated before the expedition. Postcruise work will refin e the preliminary ages of the reflectors determined during the expedition, compare them among the sites, and reevaluate the long-ter m depositional history.
