# Sites and holes  

GPS coordinates from precruise site surveys were used for th e general position of the vessel at Expedition 376 sites. Markers wer e deployed previously by remotely operated vehicles on the seafloo r at the three primary sites and three of the four alternate sites a t Brothers volcano. A SyQwest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor the seafloor depth during the approach t o the site to reconfirm the depth profiles from precruise surveys. Once the vessel was positioned at the site, a camera survey was conducted to locate the marker, to ensure no proximal animal communities were present, and to confirm suitable locations for spuddin g several holes, should they be needed (Table T1). A positioning beacon was deployed on the seafloor only at Site U1527. While on site, ship location over the hole was maintained using the Neutronic s 5002 dynamic positioning (DP) system on the JOIDES Resolution. DP control of the vessel used navigational input from the GPS (an d triangulation to the seafloor beacon at Site U1527). The final hol e position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over a significant portion of the time the hole was occupied.

The site was numbered according to the series that began wit h the first site drilled by the Deep Sea Drilling Project D/V Gloma r Challenger in 1968. Starting with Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 301, the prefix “U” designates sites occupied by th e JOIDES Resolution. For all IODP drill sites, a letter suffix distinguishes each hole drilled at the same site. The first hole drilled i s assigned the site number modified by the suffix “A,” the second hol e takes the site number and the suffix “B,” and so forth. During Expedition 376, five sites were drilled: Site U1527 (Holes U1527A– U1527C), Site U1528 (Holes U1528A–U1528D), Site U1529 (Hole s U1529A and U1529B), Site U1530 (Hole U1530A), and Site U153 1 (Holes U1531A–U1531E).  

# Drilling and coring operations  

The drilling strategy for Expedition 376 was to drill, core, an d log three primary sites: one situated on the northwest rim of the caldera at Brothers volcano, another on the floor of the caldera nea r the western caldera wall, and a third at the summit of the Uppe r Cone. Operations at each site began with attempts to drill a pilo t hole to ascertain conditions for casing. Except at Site U1530, thes e attempts were followed by the deployment of casing of differen t lengths (depending on the site conditions) and an attached reentr y funnel drilled-in using a mud motor and underreamer. We used th e rotary core barrel (RCB) system for all of the drilling and coring except for two brief tests of a prototype turbine-driven coring system (TDCS) brought on board by Center for Deep Earth Exploratio n (CDEX) engineers. The RCB system is the most conventional rotar y coring system and is suitable for lithified rock. It cuts a core as lon g as $9.5\textrm{m}$ with a nominal diameter of $5.87~\mathsf{c m}$ . RCB coring can b e conducted with or without core liners. Liners are sometimes omitted with the RCB system in an attempt to prevent core pieces fro m getting caught at the edge of the liner, which could lead to a jam an d lack of recovery. During Expedition 376, plastic liners were used fo r all of the cores. Nonmagnetic core barrels were used throughout.  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is the lowermost part of th e drill string and is configured to provide appropriate strength an d tension in the drill string. A typical RCB BHA consists of a $9\%$ inc h $({\sim}25.1\;\mathrm{cm})$ drill bit, a bit sub, an outer core barrel, a top sub, a hea d sub, ten stands of $8\%$ inch $({\sim}21.0~\mathrm{cm})$ drill collars, a tapered dril l collar, two stands of standard 5.5 inch $_{\left({\sim}14.0\ \mathrm{cm}\right)}$ drill pipe, and  a crossover sub to the regular 5 inch $({\sim}12.7\,\mathrm{cm})$ drill pipe.  

During most IODP expeditions, cored intervals are $9.6{-}9.8\mathrm{~m~}$ long, which is the length of a core barrel. The length of the recovered core varies based on a number of factors. In igneous rock, th e length of the recovered core is typically less than the cored interval. A common cause of poor recovery is core jamming in the bit or i n the throat of the core barrel, which prevents additional core fro m entering the core barrel. This problem can be partly mitigated b y extracting cores at shorter coring intervals; half cores were collecte d during Expedition 376 in all holes after two or three full-lengt h cores were extracted following initial spud-in of the holes.  

Cored intervals may not be contiguous if separated by interval s drilled but not cored. Drilling ahead without coring may be necessary or desired because certain intervals are hard or impossible t o recover or need to be reamed to the diameter required for coring o r because the cored interval is set to target a specific stratigraphic interval. For example, during Expedition 376, we drilled ahead without coring using a tricone bit for a $22\,\mathrm{m}$ interval from the seafloor i n Hole U1528C (see Operations in the Site U1528 chapter [de Rond e et al., 2019a]). Holes thus consist of a sequence of cored and drille d intervals, or advancements. These advancements are numbered sequentially from the top of the hole downward. Numbers assigned t o physical cores recovered correspond to advancements and may no t be consecutive.  

Recovery rates for each core were calculated based on the tota l length of a core recovered divided by the length of the cored interval (see Core curatorial procedures and sampling). In igneous rocks, recovery rates are typically ${<}100\%$ .  

# Core curatorial procedures and sampling Whole-round section preparation  

To minimize contamination of the core with platinum group elements and gold, all personnel handling and describing the cores o r other sample material removed jewelry and wore nitrile gloves.  

Cores recovered in core liners were extracted from the core barrel by rig personnel and carried to the catwalk by JOIDES Resolutio n Science Operator (JRSO) technicians. Technicians cut the liner an d the core, if necessary, into ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{m}$ long sections. The sections wer e temporarily secured with blue and colorless liner end caps to denot e top and bottom, respectively, a convention that was used throughout the curation process. The sections were transferred to the cor e splitting room, where the core liners were emptied and the piece s were transferred into split core liners for processing.  

In cases where core recovery was minimal (i.e., a few small fragments), JRSO technicians waited with a $1.5\,\textrm{m}$ long presplit cor e liner at the end of the catwalk. Once the core barrel was lowere d horizontally, each rock piece was removed from the core barrel on e by one and placed in consecutive order in the split plastic liner (Figure F1). If a core catcher sample was present, it was taken to th e splitting area separately and added to the bottom section of the recovered core. Once all core material was removed from the cor e barrel, the split liner sections were transferred to the core splittin g area, where the pieces were transferred into split core liners, thi s time from top to bottom for processing.  

The total length of all rock material in each section was measured and entered into the SampleMaster application as recovere d length. The sum of all recovered lengths in a core was used to compute core recovery as a percentage of the cored interval.  

Microbiology samples were taken from selected pieces according to the expedition sampling plan under supervision of the assigned Sample Allocation Committee (SAC) representative. Onl y the necessary 4–5 people wearing face masks and nitrile gloves wer e in the room for microbiology sampling to minimize contamination, and the samples were immediately transferred to the microbiology preparation laboratory (see Microbiology for information on microbiology sample handling and preparation).  

Plastic dividers made from core liner caps were then inserted between core pieces to keep them in place for curation. The spacer s may represent substantial intervals of no recovery, to the point of creating a curated core that is longer than the cored interval (see Dept h computations). Adjacent core pieces that could be fitted togethe r along fractures, or where other continuous features were observe d (e.g., volcanic clast or fabric), were curated as single pieces. JRSO personnel marked the bottom of all oriented pieces (i.e., pieces with  a greater length than diameter; approximately $>\!5\,\mathrm{cm}$ ). Core pieces tha t appeared susceptible to crumbling were encased in shrink-wrap.  

At least one designated scientist (usually the structural geologist) then checked and approved the binning and reconstruction o f fractured pieces. The scientist marked a splitting line on each piec e with a wax pencil so that the piece could be split into representativ e working and archive halves, ideally maximizing the expression o f dipping structures on the cut face of the core while maintaining representative features in both archive and working halves. To ensure  a consistent protocol for whole-core imaging, the splitting line wa s drawn so that the working half was on the right side of the line looking in the upcore direction. The working half of each piece wa s marked with a $\mathbf{\Delta}^{a}\mathbf{W}^{m}$ to the right of the splitting line (Figure F2) . Where magmatic/volcanic fabrics or crystal-plastic fabrics (CPFs ) were present, cores were marked for splitting with the fabric dipping east $(090^{\circ})$ or west $(270^{\circ})$ in the IODP core reference fram e (CRF) (see Core reference frame for sample orientation) (Figur e F2). This protocol was sometimes overridden by the presence o f specific features (e.g., mineralized areas, filled vugs, or veins) tha t were divided between the archive and working halves to ensur e preservation and/or allow shipboard or postcruise sampling.

Once the split line was drawn, JRSO technical personnel secured the plastic spacers permanently with acetone between individual pieces into matching working and archive half split-cor e liners. Spacers were mounted into the liners with the angle brac e facing uphole. This spacing ensured that the top of each piece ha d the same depth as the top of the curated interval for each bin. Th e top and bottom offsets of each bin were entered into SampleMaster. Based on the calculated bin lengths, the cumulative length of al l bins, including spacers, was computed as the curated length of th e section (Figure F1). The empty split liner with spacers glued in wa s then placed over the split liner containing the pieces, and the tw o halves were taped together in a few places for temporary storage until core pieces were dry and equilibrated to laboratory condition s (usually ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{h}$ after arrival from the catwalk).  

# Whole-round section measurements  

Once the core sections were deemed thermally equilibrated, th e following whole-round measurements were taken:  

• Whole-round surface imaging (i.e., four surface quarter image scans orthogonal to angles of $000^{\circ}$ , $090^{\circ}$ , $180^{\circ}$ , and $270^{\circ}$ relative to the CRF) using the Section Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) configured for whole-round sections;  

• Logging using the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) with the magnetic susceptibility loop (MSL) sensor, the gamma ray attenuation (GRA) detector, and the $P$ -wave velocity logger (PWL); and   
• Natural gamma radiation (NGR) logging using the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL) when the length of an individual section was ${>}40\;\mathrm{cm}$ .  

$P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements using the $P$ -wave caliper (PWC ) were also made on discrete whole-round pieces of fractured har d rock cores (that could not be measured using the PWL), which wer e then returned to the whole-round core prior to splitting. See Physical properties for further discussion of these measurements.  

# Section-half preparation  

After the completion of whole-round measurements, each piec e of core was split into archive and working halves with the position s of plastic spacers between pieces maintained in both halves. Piec e halves were labeled sequentially from the top of each section, beginning with number 1 (Figure F1). Pieces were labeled only on th e outer cylindrical surfaces of the core with a plastic label sealed wit h epoxy.  

# Archive-half measurements  

The following archive-half measurements were taken:  

• Imaging of the dry faces of archive halves using the SHIL;   
• Automated compilation of a core composite image in which all sections of a core are displayed next to each other in a one-page layout;   
• Logging using the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) with reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry (RSC) and the point magnetic susceptibility (MSP) contact probe (see Physical properties);   
• Macroscopic core description using the DESClogik data capture program (see Igneous petrology and volcanology, Alteration, and Structural geology);   
• Remanent magnetization logging using the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) (see Paleomagnetism);   
• Close-up images of particular features for illustrations in the summary of each site, as requested by individual scientists; and   
• Handheld portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) measurements on some core pieces and on crushed rock powders (see Igneous petrology and volcanology and Geochemistry).  

# Working-half sampling and measurements  

The following working-half samples and measurements wer e taken:  

• Dry faces of working halves were imaged using the SHIL and also logged using the SHMSL for RSC and MSP. • Thin section billets (TSBs) were cut to prepare thin sections for microscopic observations (see Igneous petrology and volcanology, Alteration, and Structural geology). • Cube samples $(\sim\!8\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ were taken and shared for paleomagnetism measurements, moisture and density (MAD) tests, and $P$ -wave velocity measurements using the PWC mounted on the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG) (see Paleomagnetism and Physical properties). • Slabs or chips were taken and powdered for inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), total carbonnitrogen-sulfur (CNS) elemental analyzer (EA) tests, carbonateassociated carbon contents, loss on ignition (LOI), and pXRF  

measurements (see Geochemistry and Igneous petrology and volcanology).   
• Fragments were scraped off or chips were taken and powdered for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (see Igneous petrology and volcanology and Alteration).  

# Samples for shore-based research  

Samples for postcruise analyses were taken from the workin g halves for individual investigators based on requests approved b y the SAC. Four sampling parties were held for (1) Sites U1527 an d U1529, (2) Site U1528, (3) Site U1530, and (4) Site U1531. For eac h sampling party, all cores from the designated sites were laid ou t across the entire core deck and sampled. Scientists viewed the cores, flagged sampling locations, and submitted detailed lists of requeste d samples. The SAC reviewed the flagged samples and resolved an y conflicts as needed. Shipboard staff cut, registered, and packed th e samples. A total of 2377 samples was taken for shore-based analyse s in addition to the 1563 samples taken for shipboard analysis.  

Rock samples were sealed in plastic vials or bags and labeled , and fluid and microbial samples were preserved in suitable sampling vessels (see Geochemistry and Microbiology). Each sampl e cut from the working half was logged into the LIMS database usin g SampleMaster, including the sample type and either the shipboar d analysis (test) conducted on the sample or the name of the investigator receiving the sample for postcruise analysis. Records of all samples taken from the cores are accessible online in the LIMS database  at  Sample  report  under  Curation  and  samples (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/LORE).  

# Final sample storage  

Following shipboard initial scientific observations, measurements, and sampling, both core halves were shrink-wrapped in plastic to prevent rock pieces from moving out of sequence durin g transit. Working and archive halves were then put into labeled plasti c tubes, sealed, and transferred to cold-storage space aboard the drilling vessel. At the end of Expedition 376, cores were transferred fro m the ship to the Kochi Core Center (Japan) for permanent storage.  

# Sample identification  

Sample names are computer-generated constructs of multipl e pieces of information registered in the LIMS database during th e course of the various sampling and curation processes that follo w specific rules. Understanding the three concepts (text ID, label ID, and printed labels) in use may help users enter the correct information into SampleMaster to find samples of interest using the available filters in the LIMS Reports applications.  

# Text ID  

Samples taken on the JOIDES Resolution are uniquely identifie d for use by software applications using the text ID, which combine s two elements:  

• The sample type designation (e.g., SHLF for section half) and • A unique sequential number for any sample and sample type added to the sample type code (e.g., SHLF30495837).  

The text ID is not particularly helpful to most users. For a more process-oriented comprehensible sample naming convention, the label ID links a number of parameters, according to specific rules.  

# Label ID  

The label ID is used throughout JOIDES Resolution workflow s as a convenient, comprehensible sample identification and nomen  

clature. The label ID is made up of two parts: primary sample identifier and sample name. Label IDs are not necessarily unique.  

# Primary sample identifier  

The primary sample identifier is composed of the following parameters, per decades-long convention:  

• Expedition during which the core was taken (e.g., 376);   
• Site at which one or more holes were drilled (e.g., U1527);   
• Hole at the designated site (e.g., A);   
• Core number and type retrieved in one wireline run (e.g., 3R [R $\mathbf{\mu}=\mathbb{R}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{B}]$ );   
• Section cut from the core (e.g., 2);   
• Section half after splitting, working or archive (W or A, respectively); and   
• Sample top and bottom offset, relative to the parent sample (e.g., 35/37); also see the label ID offset rules below.  

The complete label for the primary sample thus has 2–5 dash-delimited terms followed by the space-delimited offset/offset elemen t (e.g., 376-U1527A-3R-2-W 35/37).  

Specific rules were set for printing the offset/offset at the end o f the primary sample identifier:  

• For samples taken from the hole, core, or section, offset/offset is not added to the label ID. This rule has implications for the common process of taking samples from the core catcher, which technically is a section (for microbiology and paleontology samples). • For samples taken from the section half, offset/offset is always added to the label ID. The rule is triggered when an update to the sample name, offset, or length occurs. • Offsets are always rounded to the nearest centimeter before insertion into the label ID (even though the database stores higher precisions and reports offsets to millimeter precision).  

# Sample name  

The sample name is a free-text parameter for subsample s taken from a primary sample or from subsamples thereof. It i s always added to the primary sample identifier following a hyphe n (-NAME) and populated from one of the following prioritize d user entries in SampleMaster:  

• Entering a sample type (-TYPE) is mandatory (same sample type code used as part of the text ID; see above). By default, -NAME $=$ -TYPE (examples include SHLF, CUBE, CYL, PWDR, etc.). • If the user selects a test code (-TEST), the test code replaces the sample type and -NAME $=$ -TEST. The test code indicates the purpose of taking the sample, which does not guarantee that the test was actually completed on the sample (examples include TSB, ICP, PMAG, MAD, etc.). • If the user selects a requester code (-REQ), it replaces -TYPE or -TEST, and -NAME $=$ -REQ. The requester code represents the initials of the requester of the sample who will conduct postcruise analysis (examples include CDR, SEH, etc.). • If the user types a value (-VALUE) in the -NAME field, perhaps to add critical sample information for postcruise handling, the value replaces -TYPE, -TEST, or -REQ, and -NAME $=$ -VALUE (examples include TAK-80deg, CARA- ${40}\mathrm{mT}$ , etc.).  

In summary, and given the examples above, the same subsampl e may have the following label IDs based on the priority rule -VALU E $>$ -REQ $>$ -TEST $>$ -TYPE:  

• 376-U1528D-3R-1-W 35/37-CYL, • 376-U1528D-3R-1-W 35/37-PMAG, • 376-U1528D-3R-1-W 35/37-CARA, and • 376-U1528D-3R-1-W 35/37-CARA-40mT.  

When subsamples are taken out of subsamples, the -NAME o f the first subsample becomes part of the parent sample ID and another -NAME is added to that parent sample label ID:  

• Primary_sample_ID-NAME and • Primary_sample_ID-NAME-NAME  

For example, a TSB taken from the working half at a $40{-}42\;\mathrm{cm}$ offset from the section top resulted in the label ID 376-U1528D-3R-1- W 40/42-TSB. After the thin section was prepared ( $\mathord{\sim}48\,\mathrm{h}$ later), th e technician entered it as a subsample of the billet (because additional thin sections could be prepared from the same billet) and entere d the value TS08 (because it was the eighth thin section made durin g the expedition). The resulting thin section label ID was 376- U1528D-3R-1-W 40/42-TSB-TS_8.  

# Printed labels  

The requirements for printed labels have no relationship to th e rules applied to create the label ID. A printed label may look like i t carries a label ID, and the label ID is encoded in the barcode field, but the rules for what is printed on the label are subject to the label format definition, which emphasizes requester and routing information.  

# Depth computations  

The bit depths in a hole during deployment of a reentry system or drilling and coring are based on the length of drill pipe added a t and deployed beneath the rig floor (to the nearest $0.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ ). Thes e depths are reported on the drilling depth below rig floor (DRF) scal e (in meters) (Figure F3). When applicable, these depths are converted to the drilling depth below seafloor (DSF) scale by subtracting the seafloor depth determined by tagging the seafloor (or som e other method) from the current bit depths (both on the DRF scale). The bit depths (on the DRF and DSF scales) at which a coring advance begins and ends define the cored interval.  

Once the recovered core is subjected to curatorial procedure s (see Core curatorial procedures and sampling) (Figure F1), th e core depth below seafloor, method A (CSF-A), depth scale is use d for assigning depths to samples and measurements. The top dept h of a core on the CSF-A scale is equal to the top of the cored interval on the DSF scale. However, the bottom depth of the core on th e CSF-A scale and the depths of samples and measurements in th e core are based on the curatorial procedures and rules applied on th e catwalk and in the shipboard laboratory and have no defined relation to the bottom depth of the cored interval on the DSF scale. Depths of samples and associated measurements on the CSF- A scale were calculated by adding the offset of the sample or measurement from the top of its section and the lengths of all higher sections in the core to the top depth of the cored interval. Thi s computation assumes that the recovered material represents a contiguous interval, starting at the top depth of the cored interval, eve n if core pieces are separated by nonrecovered stratigraphic intervals. If a core is shorter than the full barrel length and/or consists of mor e than one piece, the true depth of a sample or measurement in th e core is unknown and a sample depth uncertainty should be considered when analyzing data associated with the core material.  

If cores must be depth-shifted to create a modified depth scal e that better represents the stratigraphy at a site or simply to remov e artificial overlaps between cores related to natural, drilling, or curatorial processes, a core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) scal e

Depth scale s used during Expedition 376 are defined in the text.

is constructed. A simple, single depth offset is defined for each core, and the transform from the CSF-A scale to the CCSF scale for al l cores in a hole is given by the affine table. All site reports and figures, except those relating to logging, use the CSF-A depth scale (see th e LIMS database for offset values used during Expedition 376).  

Additional depth scales are defined for downhole logging operations because those measurements are based on the length of th e logging cable deployed beneath the rig floor with specific sources o f uncertainly and correction procedures.  

In summary, the depth scales used (Figure F3) (IODP Dept h Scales  Terminology  version  2;  http://www.iodp.org/top-resources/program-documents/policies-and-guidelines/142- iodp-depth-scales-terminology-april-2011/file) and the corresponding pre-IODP references are as follows:  

• Drilling and coring depth scales: • DRF $=$ meters below rig floor (mbrf). • $\mathrm{DSF=}$ meters below seafloor (mbsf). • CSF-A $=$ mbsf. • $C C S\mathrm{F=}$ meters composite depth (mcd).   
• Logging depth scales: • Wireline log depth below rig floor (WRF) $=$ mbrf. • Wireline log depth below seafloor $\mathrm{(WSF)=}$ mbsf. • Wireline log speed-corrected depth below seafloor (WSSF) $=$ mbsf. • Wireline log matched depth below seafloor $\mathrm{(WMSF)}=\mathrm{mbsf}.$  

# Core reference frame for sample orientation  

Each core piece that has a length exceeding that of the core line r diameter is associated with its own CRF (i.e., oriented; Figure F2). The primary reference is the axial orientation (i.e., the top and bottom of the piece) determined by piece orientation when extracte d from the core barrel. The core axis defines the $z$ -direction, wher e positive is downcore. The secondary reference, the cut line, is an arbitrarily marked axis-parallel line on the whole-round surface of  a piece that marks the plane through the cut line and the core axi s where the piece will be split. The cut line was selected to maximiz e the dip angle of planar features on the split surface, which facilitate s accurate structural measurements. The $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis of the CRF is define d orthogonally to the cut plane, positive $(000^{\circ})$ into the working hal f and negative $(180^{\circ})$ into the archive half. The $y$ -axis is orthogonal t o the $_{\mathcal{X}-\mathcal{Z}}$ plane and, using the right-hand cork-screw rule, is positiv e (090°) to the right and negative (270°) to the left when looking upcore at the working half (Figure F2).  

Cube samples taken from the working half were marked with a n arrow pointing in the $-z$ -direction (upcore) on the working half surface $y-z$ plane), which defines the cube’s orientation unequivocall y in the CRF. TSBs and thin sections made from billets were als o marked with an upcore arrow in the most common case where th e thin section was cut from the $y{-}z$ plane of the working half. If thi n sections were cut in the $x{-}y$ or $_{\mathcal{X}-\mathcal{Z}}$ plane, these directions wer e marked on the thin sections (Figure F2).  

# Section graphic summary (visual core descriptions)  

For each core section, the most pertinent instrument measurement parameters and core description observables were plotted o n a section graphic summary (traditionally referred to as a visual cor e description form [VCD]). An existing template was reviewed by th e science party, and JRSO personnel implemented modifications a s needed during the course of the expedition to arrive at the final template (Figure F4). JRSO personnel plotted all graphic summarie s using the final template and data retrieved from the LIMS databas e or directly from DESClogik, including symbols, patterns, and lin e plots with depth, using the commercial plotting program Strate r (Figure F5). A key to symbols used on the graphic summaries i s given in Figure F6.

The VCDs summarize the shipboard observations for the section, starting with a summary from each description team (igneou s petrology  and volcanology,  alteration,  and  structural  geology ) across the top. All other information is plotted by depth in the mai n report area, starting with an image of the archive half and followe d by the identification of pieces recovered; the lithologic units defined; the shipboard samples analyzed; the most significant observed igneous, alteration, and structural parameters; magneti c susceptibility (MS) measurements; and reflectance (Figure F4).  

Thin section reports were created to summarize the most significant information for each thin section, which is extracted with  a program from the extensive observation workbooks exported fro m DESClogik in a single-page PDF (Figure F7). JRSO personnel created the report definition in the report builder custom tool, update d the definition with input from scientists during the course of the expedition, and generated batches of PDF reports on request using th e report writer tool.  

# Software tools and databases  

# LIMS database  

The JRSO LIMS database is an infrastructure to store all operational, sample, and analytical data produced during a drilling expedition (Figure F5). The LIMS database consists of an Oracl e database and a custom-built asset management system, along wit h numerous web services to exchange data with information captur e and reporting applications.  

# Sample registry tool  

All samples collected during Expedition 376 were registered i n the LIMS database using SampleMaster. The program has workflow-specific interfaces to meet the needs of different users. Sampl e registration begins with the driller entering information about th e hole and the cores retrieved from the hole. IODP personnel ente r additional core information, sections, pieces, and any other subsamples taken from these cores, such as cubes or TSBs. One interface is designed for scientists to autonomously enter subsampl e information according to the sampling plan.  

# Imaging systems  

The following highly integrated and workflow-customized imaging systems were used during Expedition 376:  

• The SHIL captured section-half surface images; it also captured whole-round section surface $(360^{\circ})$ images using a special configuration that images four swaths at $90^{\circ}$ angles to cover ${\sim}90\%$ of the surface.   
• A manual compositing process for the whole-round section images produced a quasi- $360^{\circ}$ presentation of features on the core surface.   
• An automated compositing process for all section-half images of a core produced a virtual core table view.   
• Close-up images were taken to meet special imaging needs, typically requested by shipboard scientists, not covered with routine linescan images.   
• A custom-built imaging system captured whole-area high-resolution thin section images.   
• Commercial cameras mounted on all microscopes took photomicrographs.   
• The scanning electron microscope (SEM) captured high-resolution images.  

All images were uploaded to the LIMS database immediately after capture and were accessible via browser-based reports. Image s were provided in at least one generally usable format (JPG, TIFF, o r PDF) and in multiple formats if appropriate.  

# Core description  

Descriptive and interpretive information was entered and store d using DESClogik, and all information was stored in the LIMS database. The main DESClogik interface is a spreadsheet with extensiv e data entry and data validation support. The columns (observables), worksheets (sets of observables logged in context), and workbook s (sets of worksheets used in conjunction with each other) are entirel y configurable by JRSO personnel based on experience from past expeditions and specific requirements defined by Expedition 376 scientists.  

Teams were formed for each $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ shift to describe volcanology, rock alteration, and structural geology for all core sections and thi n sections prepared on board (see Igneous petrology and volcanology, Alteration, and Structural geology). This approach ensure d that interdisciplinary teams worked collaboratively on all recovere d material. Consistency in descriptions between teams was monitored during shift changes when time was available to jointly look a t recovered material and exchange information.  

At the beginning of the expedition, each group reviewed existin g workbook templates for fresh and altered volcanic rocks and specified expedition-specific modifications that were implemented in th e DESClogik application by JRSO personnel. Observable parameter s were of three types: controlled values, free text, and numbers. Fo r the controlled-value columns, subject matter experts defined specific value lists that were configured in DESClogik as drop-dow n lists to facilitate consistent data entry. These values are defined i n each description team’s section of this chapter. Free text fields ha d no constraints and were used for comments and summaries.  

# Instrumented measurement systems  

Physical property, paleomagnetic, and geochemistry analytica l systems in the shipboard laboratories were used to capture instrumental data, as described in the corresponding sections below, using dozens of commercial and custom-built software applications. In cases where no user interaction was required after data capture, data upload to the LIMS database was triggered automatically. I n cases where quality control or data processing was needed befor e upload, the user triggered the upload to the LIMS database whe n the data were ready.  

# Data retrieval  

All data used for analysis, interpretation, and report preparatio n were downloaded using the latest version of LIMS Reports (Figur e F5), where the user selects the type of desired information from ${\sim}50$ available reports, selects a hole (and optionally cores, sections, o r samples), and uses additional report-specific filters, if desired, t o view a report online or download information in a standar d comma-separated value (CSV) file.  

Alternatively, data could also be retrieved using application s built for more specific purposes with various filtering and configuration options:  

• LIMS2Excel, a highly configurable Java-based data extractor in which users can save a specific configuration for any combination of data parameters and export it into a Microsoft Excel workbook, and   
• SCORS Downloader, which is designed to download certain data sets iteratively for stratigraphic analysis programs and can be used for any data and purpose.  

Many data sets could also be viewed in LIVE, a browser-base d application that plots cores, sections, and samples along with a userselected data set, including images, against depth. The application i s particularly useful for monitoring core logging data acquisition, performing real-time quality control, and browsing images.  

# Igneous petrology and volcanology Lithology  

Igneous and volcaniclastic rocks were the common primar y lithologies encountered during Expedition 376. Most igneous an d volcaniclastic rock description procedures used were adapted fro m Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 330 and 344 (Expedition 330 Scientists, 2012; Harris et al., 2013) and IODP Expeditions 349, 350, 351, and 352 (Li et al., 2015; Tamura et al., 2015; Arculus et al., 2015; Reagan et al., 2015). Data for the macroscopi c and microscopic descriptions of recovered cores were entered int o the LIMS database using DESClogik.  

Our shipboard studies sought to systematically describe th e physical appearance, petrology, and alteration of the cored rocks. First, phenocryst abundance and appearance, lithologic components (for volcaniclastic sediments), and characteristic igneous textures and vesicle distribution were described at a macroscopic level and investigated in more detail by thin section and SEM imaging. Second, the recovered and described material was divided into coherent units. Igneous and volcaniclastic lithologic unit boundarie s were defined using complementary information including petrography,  volcanic and  sedimentary  structure/textures,  chemical composition, and physical properties such as MS.  

# Core description workflow  

The procedures used to document the composition, texture, an d structures of rocks recovered during Expedition 376 included visual core description [VCD only refers to the form, not the process (se e dictionary)], petrographic thin section analysis, digital color imaging, SEM imaging, color spectrophotometry, pXRF (see Geochemistry), XRD, and ICP-AES. (Note that data produced on the Agilen t 5110 inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectromete r [ICP-OES] were collected in AES mode and are referred to as “ICPAES” in the online LIMS/LIMS Reports [LORE] database. Thus, i n this volume, “ICP-AES” is used to refer to these data.) Before th e core was split into working and archive halves, nondestructive measurements of physical properties were implemented (see Physica l properties). Whole-round images of ${>}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ long pieces of cor e were generated by stitching together images taken at four distinc t angles $(0^{\circ},\,90^{\circ},\,180^{\circ}$ , and $270^{\circ}$ ). All cores were processed followin g the established shipboard procedure for hard rocks. Prior to splitting, fragmented pieces of hard rock were oriented (if possible) an d put into bins separated by plastic spacers. Hard rock pieces and/o r coherent sections were then split by means of a diamond-impregnated saw along lines chosen by a structural geologist and an igneous  petrologist/alteration  mineralogist  so  that  importan t compositional and structural features were preserved in both th e archive and working halves. If the retrieved core barrel containe d loose sediment such as gravel, it was homogenized and split equall y into working and archive halves, either manually when gravel onl y partially filled the core liner or by pulling a wire lengthwise throug h the center of the core. Once the core was split, the hard rock piece s in both the working and the archive halves were labeled individuall y with unique piece/subpiece numbers from the top of each section t o the bottom (e.g., 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, etc.). If the orientation of a piece o f rock could be determined, an arrow was added to the label to indicate the uphole direction. The working and archive halves were imaged in this order using the SHIL, which also recorded red, green, and blue spectral colors along the centerline of the core. After imaging, the archive halves were analyzed for color reflectance and M S at $2.0\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals using the SHMSL (see Physical properties). Th e working halves were sampled for destructive shipboard analyse s such as physical property measurements, paleomagnetic measurements, thin section production, XRD, pXRF, and geochemical analysis by ICP-AES. Most cores sampled for shipboard ICP-AES an d XRD analysis had complementary pXRF measurements performe d utilizing powders produced for these methods. Because preciou s metals were expected in samples recovered during this expedition, no jewelry was allowed near the core and gloves were used for handling at all times.  

Each section of core was first macroscopically examined and described for petrologic, alteration, and sedimentary characteristic s (aided by use of a $_{10\times}$ magnification field hand lens and a binocula r microscope) by a team with diverse expertise including igneous petrology, volcanology, sedimentology, alteration, and sulfide mineralogy. Lithologic descriptions and most structural observations (se e Structural geology) were made on the archive halves. For bot h macroscopic and microscopic observations, DESClogik was used t o record the primary igneous characteristics (e.g., groundmass an d phenocryst mineralogy, as well as vesicle abundance), sedimentar y features (e.g., lithologic components and textures), alteration (e.g., color, vesicle filling, secondary minerals, and vein/fracture fillings; see Alteration), and lithologic unit division.  

Macroscopic features observed in the cores are summarized an d presented in the VCDs. They display the following entries in term s of igneous, volcaniclastic, alteration, structural, and physical property features for each core section (from left to right in Figure F4; see Figure F6 for VCD legend):  

• CSF-A depth scale in meters (equivalent to mbsf),   
• Core length scale from 0 to $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ ,   
• Number of hard rock pieces,   
• Igneous unit/subunit,   
• Orientation of hard rock pieces,   
• Interval and type of shipboard samples,   
• Scanned digital image of the archive half,   
• Graphic representation of lithology,   
• Column with variable patterns depicting alteration intensity, • Sulfide abundance $(\mathrm{vol\%})$ ),   
• Major minerals (from XRD data), and   
• Fractures and veins.  

Volcaniclastic VCDs (Figure F4A) include the following:  

• Grading,   
• Sorting,   
• Average and maximum grain size of clasts, and • Abundance $(\mathrm{vol\%})$ of matrix.   
gneous VCDs (Figure F4B) include the following:   
• Phenocryst abundance $(\mathrm{vol\%})$ for plagioclase (PLAG; red line) and clinopyroxene (CPX; blue line),   
• Crystal size of modal groundmass $\sin{\mathrm{mm}}$ ),   
• Vesicle size (MAX and MODE $[\mathrm{mm}]$ ),   
• Plot showing SHMSL MSP measurements,   
• Diagram displaying color reflectance parameters luminescence $(\mathbb{L}^{*})$ , red-green $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\right)$ , and blue-yellow $\left(\ b^{*}\right)$ , and   
• Section unit summary of each lithologic unit identified in the corresponding section (see below for details).  

The section unit summary (presented on the right side of th e VCD; Figure F4) for each igneous lithologic unit contains the following:  

• Expedition, site, hole, core, section number, interval, and core type (archive [A] or working half [W]);   
• Igneous lithologic unit/subunit number(s);   
• Lithology;   
• Simplified standard Munsell color determined on the dry rock surface;   
• Texture based on texture of volcaniclastic material (volcaniclastics) or total percentage of phenocrysts (igneous);   
• Description and type of clasts (volcaniclastics) or phenocryst type and percentage and groundmass texture or mineralogy based on minerals identifiable by the unaided eye, hand lens, or microscope (igneous);   
• Abundance and general shape of vesicles (igneous only);   
• Upper and lower unit contact relations and boundaries based on physical changes observed in retrieved core material (e.g., presence of chilled margins, changes in vesicularity, and alteration), including information regarding their position in the section; the term “not recovered” was entered where no direct contact was recovered (Expedition 349 Scientists, 2014);   
• Alteration intensity;   
• Vein mineralogy;   
• Structure; and   
• Comment, if applicable.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed and contain extraneou s material as a result of the coring and core handling process (Jutzele r et al., 2014). Each core was therefore examined critically during description for potential “fall-in” material, and any disturbance was recorded in DESClogik.  

# Lithologic unit classifications  

Lithologic units and subunits are classified based on VCDs an d complementary information (geochemical analysis, physical properties, etc.). Igneous rock unit boundaries are generally chosen t o reflect different volcanic cooling and/or eruptive units. The definition of an igneous lithologic unit is usually based on the presence o f lava flow contacts that are typically marked by chilled or glassy margins on the upper and lower contact or by the presence of intercalated volcaniclastic or sedimentary horizons. If no such boundarie s were recovered (e.g., because of low recovery), we defined the igneous lithologic unit boundaries according to changes in the primar y mineral assemblage (based on abundances of visible phenocryst an d groundmass mineral phases), grain size, color, structure or texture, or physical properties (MS, NGR data, etc.). Boundaries betwee n volcaniclastic lithologic units were chosen to reflect changes i n composition and/or emplacement and transport processes an d were based on characteristics such as lithologic components, grai n size, and texture (e.g., bedding, grading, or sorting). A volcaniclasti c unit can therefore reflect an entire eruption, one particular phase o f an eruption marked by changes in the mode of transport (e.g., fal l vs. flow deposit), or different post-eruptive erosive and displacement phases. In practice, these changing boundary characteristic s were difficult to discern because of the degree of alteration of th e primary lithology.

Figure F9. Classification scheme for pyroclastic rocks, after Fisher an d Schmincke (1984). Adapted from Reagan et al. (2015). In the classificatio n scheme, the upper term is for unconsolidated material (e.g., ash), and th e lower term is for consolidated material (e.g., tuff).  

Igneous lithologic units are given consecutive Arabic numeral s downhole (e.g., Units 1, 2, 3, etc.) irrespective of whether they ar e lava flows, volcaniclastic deposits, or igneous intrusions. Igneou s lithologic subunits were used in cases where the mineralogy/composition remains similar but frequent changes in texture were observed (e.g., Subunits 1a, 1b, 1c, etc.).  

Because of the effects of overprinting hydrothermal activity, w e commonly encountered rocks altered to such a degree that prope r identification was no longer possible. When this occurred, the principal lithologic name “altered volcanic rock” or “altered volcaniclastic rock” was chosen, and any further specification can be foun d under Alteration.  

# Volcaniclastic classification  

Volcaniclastic sediments were the typical sediments encountered during Expedition 376. The sedimentary classification schem e descriptive scheme typically used by IODP (as applied during Expedition 351; Arculus et al., 2015).

Volcaniclastic and siliciclastic sediments are divided into thre e lithologic classes based on their components (types of particles) following Fisher and Schmincke (1984) (Figure F8):  

• Pyroclastic sediments containing $>\!75\%$ volcanic particles, • Tuffites containing $25\%{-}75\%$ volcanic particles, and • Epiclastic sediments containing $-25\%$ volcanic particles.  

Within each class, the principal lithology name is based on particl e size and consolidation. In addition, appropriate prefixes provid e further classifying information, and suffixes indicate minor components within a principal lithology type (see below).

The principal lithology name is first derived from the volcani c content that determines the lithologic class (see above). Within eac h of these classes, both a consolidated and an unconsolidated ter m exists for each grain size class, and they are mutually exclusive (e.g., mud or mudstone; ash or tuff). The classification scheme for volcaniclastic sediments (Table T2; Figure F9) is based on terms define d by Fisher and Schmincke (1984), Wentworth (1922), and Bates an d Jackson (1987), with some minor adaptations to ensure consistenc y between volcanic and nonvolcanic terms. Some additional clarifying definitions follow:  

• Block/Bomb: a volcanic fragment larger than $64\,\mathrm{mm}$ . Bombs are juvenile clasts that are ejected when still (partially) molten and therefore show fluidal textures.   
• Agglomerate: a welded aggregate mainly containing bombs.   
• Lapilli: a volcanic fragment between 2 and $64\,\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter (fine, medium, or coarse lapilli).   
• Ash: volcanic fragments smaller than $2\,\mathrm{mm}$ (fine, medium, or coarse ash).   
• Tuffaceous: indicates a tuffite.   
• Breccia: composed of mainly subangular to angular clasts larger than $64\;\mathrm{mm}$ .   
• Conglomerate: consolidated sediment composed mainly of subrounded to rounded clasts larger than $64\;\mathrm{mm}$ .   
• Ash-breccia, lapilli ash: pyroclastic sediments containing a mix of ash, lapilli, and bombs/blocks, as defined in Figure F9.   
• Tuff-breccia, lapilli-tuff: consolidated equivalents of ash-breccia and lapilli ash, respectively.  

Irrespective of the sediment or rock lithologic class, the averag e and maximum grain sizes reported in the VCDs follow Wentwort h (1922) with minor adaptations (Table T2). For example, a coarse as h would be described as having sand-sized particles.  

If observations allowed an interpretation regarding the mode o f transport and/or fragmentation and/or emplacement mechanism,  a note was made in the comments. Some examples are given below; definitions are from Bates and Jackson (1987) and Fisher an d Schmincke (1984):  

• Block and ash flow: formed by a pyroclastic flow of lava debris (due to dome collapse); contains mostly volcanic blocks and ash.   
• Ignimbrite: formed by a pyroclastic flow of pumice and ash (due to column collapse); contains ash and a wide range of lapilli- to block-sized clasts.   
• Hyaloclastite: formed by the intrusion of lava or magma into water, ice, or water-saturated sediment and its consequent granulation or shattering into small angular fragments.   
• Autoclastite: a rock with a brecciated structure that was formed in the place where it is found as a result of crushing, shattering, or other mechanical forces.  

# Prefixes  

Prefixes were chosen to provide additional classification information where possible, such as an estimated composition, furthe r specification of grain sizes, or textural information. Where appropriate, combinations of prefixes were adopted. Prefixes include  

• Compositional information: description of volcanic material as felsic, intermediate, or mafic with an additional distinction between monomict (clast compositions of a single type) and polymict (clast compositions of multiple types).   
• Textural information: matrix-supported (smaller particles visibly envelop each of the larger particles) versus clast-supported (clasts form the sediment framework).   
• Specification of grain sizes: fine, medium, or coarse, as well as silty and sandy (e.g., for “medium lapilli” or “sandy silt”).   
• Description of volcanic clasts: categorization of volcanic clasts as pumice or scoria.  

# Suffixes  

A suffix was used for a subordinate but important componen t (i.e., abundance $5\%-25\%$ ) that deserves to be highlighted. For example, if an ash layer contains some accretionary lapilli, it would b e named “ash with accretionary lapilli.” Suffixes are restricted to a single phrase to maintain a short and effective lithology name containing the most important information only.

# Other parameters  

Several additional parameters were recorded in macroscopi c core descriptions to further delineate volcaniclastic units. These parameters include color (using Munsell color charts; Munsell Colo r Company, Inc., $2009\mathrm{a}$ , 2009b), average and maximum particle sizes, description of boundaries and contacts between units, sorting (Figure F10), grading, layer/bedding thickness, and sedimentary structures such as wavy bedding or cross-lamination. Where available, we also described the matrix in terms of lithology and sorting an d the three most dominant clasts $>\!2\ m m$ in terms of lithology an d roundness (Figure F10). That is, we distinguish between lithi c clasts, vitric/volcanic clasts, and crystals. For consolidated sediments, we also distinguish types of lithification between welded o r cemented, where applicable.  

When a boundary between two adjacent lithologies was observed, it was classified using the terms presented in Table T3. Where the geometry of a contact could be directly observed, w e classified the lower boundary as planar, curviplanar, or irregular. The lower boundary was further classified as sharp, scoured, wavy, or gradational. The dip of the boundary was described as inclined, subhorizontal, horizontal, subvertical, or vertical (see Structura l geology for detailed methodology).  

# Microscopic description of volcaniclastic rocks  

To complement macroscopic descriptions, we analyzed smea r slides of sufficiently fine grained, unconsolidated material and thi n sections of consolidated sediments and large-enough individual clasts from unconsolidated material. Thin sections were initially described using a template for handwritten description, and the dat a were subsequently entered into the Smear_slide tab and the Sediment_ts tab, respectively, in the Microscopic template in DESClogik. Data include the abundance of different grain sizes in th e sample, as well as the lithologic components (i.e., the respectiv e abundance of volcanic [juvenile] clasts, lithic/epiclastic clasts, an d different crystals). For each clast type, we recorded the respectiv e grain size and roundness. Additionally, vesicularity and likely composition of volcanic particles were recorded, if possible. Sedimentary textures such as sorting, bedding thickness, or lamination, a s well as the composition and grain size of the matrix (if present), were analyzed in thin sections. Many clasts in recovered volcaniclastic rocks were large and unaltered enough that their igneous features were recognizable. In those cases, microscopic features a s outlined in the next section regarding (sub)volcanic classification s were also recorded, including vesicularity, groundmass textures, and phenocryst assemblages. If necessary, two domains were use d in the Sediment_ts tab of DESClogik to record information fo r clasts and matrix separately for the same sample. However, the microscopic distinction of individual clasts versus matrix was ofte n challenging to impossible because of the similarity in compositio n and/or alteration. In that case, the sample was described in one domain. Alteration minerals were exclusively described in the Alteration tab of DESClogik, but all (or traces of) primary igneous o r sedimentary features, such as pseudomorphs of phenocrysts, wer e recorded in the Sediment_ts tab.

Figure F11 includes the template used to record microscopic description. For each thin section, a summary of observations regarding sedimentary/volcanic, alteration, and structural features use d for the DESClogik output was written (Figure F7).  

# (Sub)volcanic classifications  

Volcanic and hypabyssal (subvolcanic) rocks were described a s follows:  

• Grain size classification and distribution, texture, and rock color;   
• Description of primary mineral phases and groundmass;   
• Definition of principal lithology including prefixes and optional suffixes; and   
• Lava flow types and contacts.  

# Grain size classification and distribution, texture, and color Groundmass  

The term “groundmass” describes the crystalline and/or glass y matrix between phenocrysts (see definition below) in an extrusiv e or hypabyssal rock. For VCDs, the grain size of the groundmass i s estimated using the terms “coarse grained,” “medium grained,” an d “fine grained” (Neuendorf et al., 2005); the grain size of the groundmass is quantified using thin section microscopy:  

• Coarse grained (crystal diameters $=5{-}30\ \mathrm{mm})$ ), • Medium grained (crystal diameters $=1{-}5\;\mathrm{mm}$ ), and • Fine grained (crystal diameters $=0.2–1\;\mathrm{mm}$ ).  

For reports and description summaries, we have simplifie d these values to fine-grained or coarse-grained groundmass. The distribution of the groundmass crystals was classified into bimodal, equigranular, inequigranular, granular, poikilitic, or seriate. The texture of groundmass was described using the terms defined in Tabl e T4.  

# Volcanic glass  

We noted whether or not glass was present, documenting th e proportion of glass, fresh glass, spherulites, and altered glass, an d elaborated on glass preservation in optional comments as needed.  

# Vesicles  

Macroscopic observations of vesicles included visual estimate s of vesicle abundance, maximum and average vesicle size, roundness, sphericity, and vesicle filling supplemented by optional comment s as appropriate.  

Vesicle abundance was classified using the criteria of Reagan e t al. (2015): • Nonvesicular $=0\%$ vesicles. • Sparsely vesicular $=-5\%$ vesicles.  

• Moderately vesicular $=5\%{-}20\%$ vesicles.   
• Highly vesicular $=>\!20\%$ vesicles.  

The sphericity and roundness of vesicles was described according to the terms presented in Figure F12. Vesicle fillings were recorded as being present or absent, with more detailed observatio n of the type of filling made in Alteration.  

Igneous textures  

The principal distinguishable textures of subvolcanic and volcanic rock were described (Table T5).  

# Color  

Rock color was determined on a dry, cut surface of the archiv e half using Munsell color charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2009a; 2009b).  

# Primary mineral phases  

The following primary mineral phases were described:  

• Shapes, which include euhedral, subhedral, anhedral, and interstitial; • Aspect ratios to describe the euhedral to subhedral habit of a crystal, adapted from ODP Leg 209 (Shipboard Scientific Party,   
2004): equant, subequant, tabular, elongate, and acicular; and • Habits for plagioclase and clinopyroxene adapted from ODP Legs 148 and 206 (Alt et al., 1993; Shipboard Scientific Party,   
2004).  

# Phenocrysts  

Porphyritic volcanic rocks were named according to majo r phenocryst phase(s) when the total abundance of phenocrysts wa s ${>}1\%$ (see Lithology prefix). The term “phenocryst” is used to describe any crystal significantly larger (typically five times larger ) than the average size of groundmass and $>\!1\ \mathrm{mm}$ in diameter, irrespective of the potential ante- or xenocrystic origin. The ter m “microphenocryst” is used for crystals larger than the modal groundmass grain size but ${<}1\ \mathrm{mm}$ . “Glomerocryst” is used to describe clusters of phenocrysts of the normal phenocryst assemblage. Macroscopically, as many as three different types of the mos t abundant phenocrysts (e.g., garnet, biotite, Fe-Ti oxide, amphibole, muscovite, olivine, plagioclase, pyroxene, quartz, spinel, and K-feldspar) were described in more detail. Observations include percentage, maximum size, modal size, and shape (anhedral, subhedral, o r euhedral) of phenocryst, elaborated by optional comments as required. In addition, the total phenocryst abundance was recorded.  

# Accessory mineral phases  

Any macroscopically identifiable mineral phase with a ver y scarce total abundance (usually ${<}1\%$ ) was recorded as an accessor y mineral (e.g., biotite, anhydrite, apatite, amphibole, Fe-Ti oxide, garnet, muscovite, olivine, plagioclase, pyroxene, quartz, rutile, spinel, sulfide, and zircon). As many as two phases were recorded, supplemented by optional comments.  

# Rock types/lithology  

A lithologic name is composed of a principal lithology name an d an optional prefix and suffix. Volcanic rocks and their principal lithology names are classified according to the International Unio n of Geological Sciences (IUGS) classification scheme of Le Maitre e t al. (2002) based on the nature of the phenocrysts and their relativ e proportions (Figure F13). However, because detailed petrograph y

and/or chemical analyses are usually not available when the core i s initially logged, we modified the initial rock classification if necessary when chemical data or detailed petrography became available.  

Principal lithology Nine principal lithology categories (in order of increasing $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ content) were defined in DESClogik (Tables T5, T6):  

1. Picrite: basaltic rock visibly enriched in olivine crystals, often as phenocrysts (Gill, 2010).   
2. Basalt: rock containing plagioclase and pyroxene (Reagan et al., 2015).   
3. Ankaramite: basaltic rock rich in olivine and clinopyroxene phenocrysts (Gill, 2010).   
4. Dolerite: medium-grained igneous rock consisting essentially of pyroxene and plagioclase. Generally, a hypabyssal, intrusive equivalent of basalt.   
5. Andesite: rock containing pyroxene and/or feldspar and/or amphibole, typically devoid of olivine and quartz (Reagan et al., 2015).   
6. Dacite: typically plagioclase-phyric rock, sometimes containing pyroxene $\pm$ quartz $\pm$ hornblende (Reagan et al., 2015). Note that at Brothers volcano, dacites are unusually dark gray to black in color.   
7. Rhyolite: plagioclase-phyric rock, sometimes containing quartz $\pm$ hornblende (Reagan et al., 2015).   
8. Altered volcanic rock: general term for (formerly) primary volcanic rock that has been altered so that the primary rock type (apart from its texture indicating a volcanic origin) cannot be determined with certainty.   
9. Peperite: breccia-like volcanic rock enclosed by marine sedimentary rock. Interpreted by some to be a mixture of lava with sediment and by others as shallow intrusions of magma into wet sediment (Bates and Jackson, 1987).

# Lithology prefix  

A prefix was chosen to indicate one of the following: (1) conten t and type of common volcanic phenocrysts present, (2) additiona l lithologic qualifier of composition and texture, or (3) the presenc e of accessory minerals. Prefixes include  

• Aphyric (for nonporphyritic rocks) or -phyric (as a suffix for porphyritic minerals) was used with the principal phenocrysts olivine, plagioclase, pyroxene, amphibole, quartz, and biotite and their combinations. In the case of multiple phenocryst occurrences (e.g., plagioclase-pyroxene), the first mineral name is the most abundant in the sample.   
• Other lithologic prefixes used are brecciated (if the rock is coherent enough not to be called pyroclastic), andesitic, basaltic, dacitic, doleritic, or rhyolitic.  

# Lithology suffix  

A suffix was chosen to indicate the mode of emplacement if direct volcanic or subvolcanic features could be determined, including pillow lava, lava flow (general term for massive lava independen t from type of lava flow), dike (intrusive with a dominantly vertica l orientation), and sill (intrusive with a dominantly horizontal orientation). The following distinguishing criteria were used:  

• Pillow lavas: • Curvilinear chilled to glassy margins, • Concentric banding of vesicles,  

• Internally radiating vesicle chains, and • Internally radiating joint patterns.   
Lava flows: • Flow banding, • Vertical to subvertical vesicle pipes, and   
• Brecciated flow tops.   
Dikes and sills:   
• Unconformable contact with an adjacent lithology, • Evidence for chilled margins, and • Evidence for chilled contacts.  

Any subvertical hypabyssal igneous rocks were classified a s dikes. Other subhorizontal hypabyssal igneous rocks were classifie d as sills.  

# Contact types  

Because of limited recovery in most cores, contacts betwee n two lithologies (which are typically the boundaries of descriptive intervals) were commonly absent. When a boundary between two adjacent lithologies was observed, it was classified using the term s presented in Table T3. Where the geometry of a contact could b e directly observed, we classified the lower boundary as planar, curviplanar, or irregular. The lower boundary was further classified a s sharp, scoured, wavy, or gradational. The dip of the boundary wa s described as inclined, subhorizontal, horizontal, subvertical, an d vertical (see Structural geology for detailed methodology).  

# Microscopic description of (sub)volcanic rocks  

To complement macroscopic descriptions, we analyzed representative thin sections of volcanic, hypabyssal, and plutonic rocks. Thin sections were initially described using a template for handwritten description, and the data were subsequently entered in th e microscopic template in DESClogik in the (Sub)volcanic and Plutonic tabs, respectively, where appropriate. The description followed the macroscopic description of these rock types closely bu t was supplemented by specific microscopic observations such a s crystal habit (equant, subequant, tabular, or elongate), crystal zoning (continuous, discontinuous, patchy, or oscillatory zoning) an d zoning extent (none, scarce, abundant, or very abundant), and possible crystal exsolution (bleb or lamellae). For accessory crystals, only type and abundance were recorded, and for groundmass crystals, abundance, size, type, and shape were described. If vesicle s were present, they were described by volume $(\mathrm{vol\%})$ ; the proportio n empty and/or filled $(\%)$ ; minimum, maximum, and mode size; roundness; and sphericity, again closely following the procedure fo r macroscopic descriptions. Figure F14 shows the template used t o record microscopic descriptions. For each thin section, a summar y of observations regarding igneous, alteration, and structural features was written and used for the DESClogik output (Figure F7).

# Alteration  

Procedures developed specifically to aid in visual description o f hydrothermal mineralization and alteration encountered during Expedition 376 are detailed in the following sections.  

# Visual description of hydrothermally altered material  

Significant detail was incorporated into DESClogik, which enabled a comprehensive report of the predominant style of hydrothermal mineralization and alteration of specific intervals of th e recovered core material.  

# Degree of alteration  

An initial estimate of the degree of alteration was reported fo r every defined alteration interval. Degree of alteration is reporte d based on the modal percentage of secondary alteration mineral s and assigned an alteration ranking from 0 (unaltered) to 5 (completely altered) (Table T7). This alteration ranking was used to plo t alteration intensity on the visual core logs. The proportions of alteration minerals are estimated primarily based on visual observation s (including observation under binocular stereoscope). In most cases, a comparison between macroscopic and microscopic estimates o f alteration mineral proportions indicate that macroscopic estimate s are consistently overestimated. As a result, thin section description s and the relative intensities of XRD peaks, when available, were use d to validate or adjust visual estimates for degree of alteration.  

# Alteration color  

The color of alteration was determined visually using Munsel l Color Charts (Munsell Color Company, Inc., 2009b).

# Alteration texture  

The alteration texture was determined visually using descriptiv e terms established in the hydrothermal literature (Table T8).  

# Alteration mineralogy  

The modal abundances of the main alteration products were determined macroscopically. The initial mineral identification and de  

gree of alteration estimates were later refined by incorporating th e results from thin section descriptions (using both transmitted an d reflected light modes), XRD, and pXRF analyses.  

# Secondary sulfide minerals  

The texture of sulfide minerals that were precipitated by secondary processes (i.e., through hydrothermal fluid–rock interaction)  were  described  separately  from  the  alteration  texture s ascribed to the host rock (see Table T9).  

# Alteration of clasts and matrix  

Evidence of brecciation was reported according to the shape o f both coherent and noncoherent clasts, clast size, whether the clas t is matrix supported, and the degree of clast angularity using the criteria summarized in Table T10 and Figure F15. The dominant alteration mineralogy of both clasts and matrix was reported.  

# Vesicle, vug, and vein filling  

Vesicles in the volcanic rocks and vugs developed during alteration of the sample were reported as visual estimates of the percen t of the overall sample volume. They were further characterize d based on fill mineralogy and average percent fill.

The term “vein” was applied to any later crosscutting featur e that precipitated from hydrothermal fluids. Veins were describe d based on visual estimation of spatial density (defined as percent o f sample interval composed of vein-fill material), vein geometry (using criteria outlined in Table T11), description of the vein margi n (e.g., sharp, diffusive, or irregular), maximum vein width, and vei n fill texture (Table T12). If distinct vein sets defined based on compositional or morphological characteristics were present, crosscutting relationships were used to define vein generations, and eac h generation was described separately (see Structural geology).  

# Other observations  

Other evidence of water–rock interaction, such as evidence of anhydrite dissolution, was also reported.  

# Common alteration assemblages  

Specific alteration mineral assemblages are described based o n their modal composition and the presence or absence of key indicator minerals. These assemblages are often used as a proxy for th e physicochemical conditions of a hydrothermal fluid (e.g., pH, temperature) during alteration and subsequent mineralization for a variety of hydrothermal ore systems. For example, in magmaticdominated hydrothermal ore deposits, advanced argillic, argillic, and propylitic alteration styles are commonly composed of distinc t mineral assemblages (Tables T13, T14). When describing the broa d style of mineralization encountered in the recovered core, referenc e was made to these characteristic alteration assemblages. However, i t should be noted that the mineral assemblages described above ar e synonymous with mineralization formed through the interaction o f hydrothermal fluids with meteoric water. In contrast, seawater i s the dominant fluid in submarine hydrothermal systems. Thus, th e alteration assemblage may differ from that described for subaerial deposits, especially where related to the low-temperature limits o f hydrothermal activity and/or in zones of obvious mixing with seawater. For example, low-temperature mineral assemblages are likel y to be dominated by zeolites, Na-Ca smectite, celadonite, and opal (Reyes, 2003; de Ronde et al., 2005).

# Analytical techniques  

# Binocular microscope  

Rock samples from archive halves were studied under a Zeis s SteREO Discovery V8 binocular microscope equipped with a camera system to identify alteration minerals. Magnification range d from $1.0\times$ to ${}^{8\times}$ and was suitable for observing small hydrothermal minerals on sample surfaces, such as zeolite infilling lava vesicles.  

# Polished thin sections  

Polished thin sections were prepared as $30~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ thick slices o f working halves. The standard size of a TSB cut from the core was  2 $\mathrm{cm}\,\times\,3~\mathrm{cm}\,\times\,0.8~\mathrm{cm}$ . Polished thin sections were observed unde r  

both transmitted and reflected light using an Axio or Axioplan polarizing microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a SPOT Flex (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.) digital camera.  

# X-ray diffraction analysis  

Samples for XRD analysis were crushed using an agate morta r and pestle. Diffraction data were generated on the shipboard Bruke r D4 Endeavor X-ray diffractometer, which is equipped with a ${\mathrm{Cu}}$ source and uses a generator voltage of $35\;\mathrm{kV}$ and current of $40\;\mathrm{mA}$ . Depending on the rate of core recovery and scientific objectives, th e XRD operated under two different protocols. For routine analyse s to aid core description and deliver essentially qualitative analyses, the operating conditions were set to step scans from $4^{\circ}$ to $75^{\circ}2\theta$ fo r 3750 steps at a rate of 1 s/step (the typical setting used on boar d during previous expeditions). For high-precision XRD analyses capable of quantitative analysis via Rietveld-based full pattern fittin g techniques using small amounts of sample, acquisition occurred a t step scans from $4^{\circ}$ to $120^{\circ}2\theta$ for 5800 steps at a rate of $2\;{\bf s}/$ step. Diffraction results were evaluated against powder diffraction files an d the International Centre for Diffraction Data database for mineral s using the Search/Match component of Bruker’s EVA Diffractio n Evaluation software (full pattern).  

Selected residues of shipboard samples were subject to shorebased XRD analysis postcruise. These diffraction data were generated on Panalytical X’pert3 Powder and Rigaku D/Max IIIa diffractometers (each equipped with a Cu source) at the School of Eart h Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University (China). The forme r was operated using a generator voltage of 45kV and current of 4 0 mA, and the latter used a voltage of $37.5\;\mathrm{kV}$ and current of $25~\mathrm{mA}$ . The XRD shore-based measurements for all samples were carrie d out using two protocols. For high-precision XRD analyses capabl e of quantitative analysis via Rietveld-based full pattern fitting techniques using small amounts of sample, acquisition occurred at ste p scans from $3^{\circ}$ to $120^{\circ}2\theta$ for 5850 steps at a rate of $2\,{\sf s}/$ step. The specimens were prepared with a side-packing method to reduce the orientation of the grains. For clay minerals, the XRD data wer e generated using Rigaku D/max-IIIa operated at a step scan from $3^{\circ}$ to $35^{\circ}2\theta$ for 1600 steps at a rate of $2\;{\sf s}/$ step. Specimen powders $^{<2}$ $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ dispersed in distilled water were dropped on a glass slide, airdried, and subsequently saturated in vapor of ethylene glycolated b y heating in sealed containers at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ . Both air-dried and ethylene-glycolated oriented slides were then analyzed to differentiat e clay minerals and verify their compositions.  

# Fluid inclusions  

Fluid inclusions (FIs) are microscopic vacuoles in crystals tha t contain fluids (gas, aqueous, and hydrocarbon solutions) that hav e been trapped at specific temperatures and pressures. Solids in FI s may form from the trapped fluids or may be trapped particles. A t the most basic level, the homogenization and freezing point depression temperatures of an individual FI or a fluid inclusion assemblag e can be measured using a heating/freezing stage mounted on  a petrographic microscope. The temperature at which the fluids in a n inclusion homogenize to a single phase gives information about th e temperature at which an FI was formed. In addition, the freezin g point depression temperature (i.e., the point when ice in the FI disappears below $0^{\circ}{\cal C}_{,}$ is related to the salinity of the aqueous solution s (Roedder, 1984).  

A significant amount of literature addresses the pressure correction of homogenization temperatures for the true trapping temperatures of FIs, especially in ore deposits and hydrocarbon system s (e.g., Roedder, 1971). However, under hydrostatic conditions a t Brothers volcano, homogenization temperatures are essentially th e same as trapping temperatures in active hydrothermal systems an d are often $\pm20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ or less of measured fluid temperatures in geothermal wells (Reyes et al., 1993, 2003).  

It is necessary to distinguish between primary and secondar y FIs and assess whether secondary FIs can be used to determine original pressure, temperature, and chemical conditions. In active hydrothermal systems, fracturing and changes in hydrological flo w periodically occur within a short period of time of usually ${<}10{,}000\,\mathrm{_y}$ (Henley and Ellis, 1983), and therefore both primary and secondar y FIs should be analyzed because they record hydrological, fluid composition, pressure, fluid phase, and thermal changes with time, a s well as any perturbations in the crust, especially localized ones suc h as hydrothermal fracturing. Hydrological changes recorded in bot h primary and secondary FIs, for example, vary from the renewed incursion of colder meteoric water or seawater or the influx of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids.  

In most active, arc-type hydrothermal systems such as Brother s volcano, determining the salinity of aqueous solutions in FIs is ofte n not straightforward, if not impossible, because of the presence o f dissolved gas. Dissolved gas, dominated by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in hydrotherma l systems (e.g., Giggenbach, 1995), tends to form clathrates. Some o f these clathrates may appear to homogenize at $<\!0^{\circ}C$ , leading to overestimations of fluid salinity (Hedenquist and Henley, 1985). Experimental data and best-fit equations (Bozzo et al., 1973) are used t o calculate the salinity of fluids in the presence of $C O_{2}$ clathrates, an d Darling (1991) extends the equation of Chen (1972) to cover th e range of clathrate melting from $-10^{\circ}$ to $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Equation E1).  

# Estimating salinity and pressures  

In all aspects of FI studies in active hydrothermal systems, a detailed petrological study of the FIs, their associated secondary mineral assemblage, and fracturing events is necessary to interpret F I measurements appropriately.  

Some of the first observations to note in FIs before any measurements are taken using the heating/freezing stage are (1) occurrenc e of leakage or “necking,” which indicates homogenization temperatures will be unreliable; (2) sizes, morphologies, and types of occurrence (i.e., solitary or aligned along microfractures); (3) sequence o f entrapment in a crystal (i.e., from center to rim or crosscutting microfractures); and (4) fluid phases with a general note on the size o f the vapor bubble, if present, and the occurrence of solids.  

In the presence of $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ clathrates $\mathrm{(NaCl-H_{2}O-C O_{2})}$ , salinity (S ) is calculated (Darling, 1991) as follows:  

$$
S=+0.00098241(10-t)(t^{2}+45.385t+1588.75),
$$  

where $t$ is the final clathrate melting point $(^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ .  

Assuming that the trapped fluids lie within the $\mathrm{NaCl-H_{2}O}$ binary system but clathrates are absent, the salinity of the FIs can b e estimated using the equations detailed below.  

Based on the freezing point depression temperatures measure d in a heating/freezing stage (Sterner et al., 1988; Bodnar, 1993), salinity (NaCl in wt%) can be estimated as follows:  

$$
S=0.0+1.78x-0.0442x^{2}+0.000557x^{3},
$$  

where $_{\mathscr{x}}$ is the freezing point depression temperature $(^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . Salinit y can also be estimated as a function of halite dissolution (Sterner e t al., 1988):  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{S=26.242+0.4928y+1.42y^{2}-0.223y^{3}+0.04129y^{4}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{+\,6.295\times10^{-3}y^{6}+1.1112\times10^{-4}y^{7},}}\end{array}
$$  

where $y$ is $t/100$ .  

Under critical conditions, the temperature can be estimate d from the salinity (Equation E4), whereas the critical pressure (Equation E5) can be estimated from the critical temperature (Knight an d Bodnar, 1989):  

$$
t_{\mathrm{critical}}=374.1+8.800z+0.177z^{2}-0.02113z^{3}+7.334\times10^{-4}z^{4},
$$  

where $z=\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{NaCl}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{P(\mathrm{bar})_{\mathrm{critical}}=2094-20.56t+0.06896t^{2}-8.903}\\ &{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\times10^{-5}t^{3}+4.214\times10^{-8}t^{4}.}\end{array}
$$  

# Fluid inclusion apparatus  

The  Fluid  Incorporated  United  States  Geological  Surve y (USGS) gas flow heating/freezing stage consists of a heating/freezing stage with an electric gas heating element, a Doric Trendicator,  a foot pedal to pause the temperature reading on the trendicator, an d a liquid $\Nu_{2}$ dewar. The heating/freezing stage is set on a petrographic microscope with an $x{-}y$ stage. This setup was brought o n board the JOIDES Resolution as a third-party instrument from GN S Science (New Zealand).  

Before analyzing samples, the heating/freezing stage was firs t calibrated using two standards: (1) $75\,\mathrm{mole}\%$ $\mathrm{H_{2}O}+25\:\mathrm{mole_{'0}^{0}\:C O_{2}},$ which has a calibration temperature of $-56.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and a safe temperature range of $-198^{\circ}$ to $+30^{\circ}C,$ and (2) pure water with calibratio n temperatures of $0.0^{\circ}C$ (triple point of $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{\cdot}$ ) and $374.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (the critica l point of $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{\cdot}$ . Refer to the Fluid Incorporated manual Temperatur e calibration standards by Syn Flinc for the calibration procedure s (Fluid Incorporated, 1992).  

Crystals smaller than $10\;\mathrm{mm}$ were mounted on cover slip shard s with a high-temperature silicone gasket (e.g., Loctite SI 5920 that i s stable to $316\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ based on the manufacturer’s specifications but ca n be stable to $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ according to experiments using the heatin g stage). The silicone gasket was cured for at least $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ before heating.  

# Experiments set up specifically for Expedition 376  

Because of concerns regarding (1) the efficacy and durability o f the temperature logging tools, the Kuster Flow Through Sample r (Kuster FTS) for sampling fluids, and the cables that hold the logging tools and (2) the lack of an efficient way to detect fluid acidit y during well drilling and any fluid phase changes with depth, two experimental methods were specifically designed and prepared for th e expedition: synthesizing FIs in preprepared quartz, calcite, and anhydrite crystals and fashioning thermometers using temperaturesensitive materials.  

# Synthetic fluid inclusions in introduced crystals  

Quartz and calcite crystals with synthetically induced fracture s have been used as temperature probes and fluid samplers in ver y high temperature active subaerial hydrothermal systems in Japa n (Ikeuchi et al., 1998). For example, in the WD-1 well in Kakkonda, Japan, the induced crystal cracks in quartz and calcite healed a t temperatures consistent with the equilibrated borehole temperatures of $200^{\circ}{-}271^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Sawaki et al., 1997).  

Figure F16. Experimental setup used during Expedition 376 showing one o f the two recesses in the drill bit where the bronze sample holder with Au foil– wrapped crystals was inserted. The crystals consisted of quartz, calcite, an d anhydrite. The bronze holder (designed and made by IODP staff S. Midgle y and E. Claasen) is cooled with liquid $\mathsf{N}_{2}$ before it is hammered in. Because th e coefficient of expansion of bronze is higher than the surrounding steel, i t was thought that the sample packet would withstand high temperature s and would not fall off.  

![](images/7900a28fddb7cf7a4788bb39f603c1f1fd48ced857d966bc6554c868f91726a5.jpg)  

In experiments conducted before Expedition 376, artificial fractures in natural calcite, anhydrite, and Brazilian quartz were create d and any earlier FIs were decrepitated by immediately pouring liqui d nitrogen on crystals that had been heated in the furnace at $450^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ fo r $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ . The procedure was repeated as many as five times on doubl y polished $\le\!1\,\mathrm{mm}$ thick quartz so that fractures formed. However, because of the prominent fractures in calcite and anhydrite, too man y repetitions of thermal shocking tend to shatter the crystals into fine r material. Thus, anhydrite and calcite were not double-polished. Instead, individual crystals with minimum or no FIs were selected. Fo r the shipboard work, at least 80 crystals each of quartz, calcite, an d anhydrite were prepared and photographed at the GNS Science laboratory. Unlike the Japanese experiments on synthesizing FIs, no extraneous fluids (cf. Sawaki et al., 1997) were added to the crystal s used during the expedition because of the high salinity of seawater.  

Quartz and anhydrite are the main crystals from Brothers volcano that trapped fluids for FI homogenization and salinity measurements. Apart from being used as “vessels” that trap fluids for F I homogenization and freezing point depression temperature measurements, calcite crystals were used as an acid fluid indicato r based on any dissolution pits in the crystals. For shipboard measurements, the crystals were wrapped in gold or copper foil secure d with copper or nichrome wire.  

The crystals were inserted into one of two recesses in the dril l bit (Figure F16). The crystals attached to the drill bit were expose d to a range of temperatures and fluid compositions during drillin g and were downhole for as long as 1.6 days (cf. the drill bit can b e deployed for as long as $40\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of actual drilling time).  

# Glass capillary thermometers  

Temperature-indicating strips were used to monitor maximu m downhole temperatures during drilling. Laboratory experiment s using temperature sensitive Tempilaq lacquers and temperature-indicating strips have shown that these products become ineffectiv e when wetted by any type of fluid. The strips also react to contac t pressure, giving erroneous results. Given this vulnerability to wate r and pressure, glass capillary thermometers were devised that cove r a range of temperatures from $70^{\circ}$ to $630^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Figure F17. Setup for deployment of capillary tube thermometers use d during Expedition 376 showing the steel wool plugs, stainless tubes, and 1 5 μm thick aluminum foil to be wrapped around the glass capillary tubes containing temperature-sensitive materials.  

![](images/763ff9143fd1c60d58d13ace026f39c6889f2af31665009ddf2986f6fabddd2b.jpg)  

The melting point temperatures of selected solids were $80^{\circ}$ , $115^{\circ}$ , $232^{\circ}$ , $328^{\circ}$ , $420^{\circ}$ , $450^{\circ}$ , 501°, $564^{\circ}$ , and $630^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Also included were tw o Tempilaq lacquers that change color at $204^{\circ}$ and $399\mathrm{{^\circC_{1}}}$ , respectively. These thermometers always record maximum temperatures.  

The Tempilaq lacquers were mixed with silica powder before  a few milligrams were inserted into the soda-lime glass capillar y tubes. The capillary tubes were then filled with silica powder, heatsealed, and checked for any air pockets. Solids with specific meltin g points were ground into a powder, if possible, before a few milligrams were similarly inserted into the tubes. The tubes were agai n filled with silica powder and checked for air-tightness after sealing.  

To increase the probability of getting any information from th e melting of solids, the capillary tubes were cut in half to decrease th e surface area exposed to high pressures in the borehole. Each tub e was wrapped in $15~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ thick aluminum foil with fine holes to increase the probability of preserving any information from the melting of solids, even if the glass capillary tubes shattered. Three to fiv e of these thermometers of various temperatures were inserted into  a $4.5\ \mathrm{cm\long}\times16\ \mathrm{mm}$ outer diameter (OD) stainless steel tube wit h ends packed by steel wool. These steel tubes, with temperature-indicating strips included, were then inserted into external recesses i n the thermowell section of the Kuster FTS tool, the housing on top o f the core barrel, and the chamber in the Schlumberger logging too l strings (Figure F17).  

# Thin section preparation for fluid inclusion analysis  

For thin section preparation, the rock sample was crushed usin g a mortar and pestle, dried in the oven if wet, and then attached to  a glass slide with a thin layer of fast-setting cyanoacrylate (superglue). Upon drying, the section was ground using $100\ \upmu\mathrm{m\Al_{2}O_{3}}$ on  a whetstone and then further ground using wetted 240 to 400 gri t sandpaper. When the thickness was acceptable, the section was covered with clear nail polish. Otherwise, the sample was further polished for reflected light analysis via progressive polishing using 9 $\mathsf{\mu m\ A l_{2}O_{3}}$ powder followed by $6~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ and then $1~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ diamond suspensions.  

# Structural geology  

Brothers volcano is an arc caldera volcano with several activ e hydrothermal systems. These rocks are expected to retain a recor d of volcanic eruption, caldera floor collapse, intraarc extension, an d superposed or coincident alteration events. The methods describe d here are organized from structures formed at high to low temperatures. Many features such as volcanic, alteration, and sedimentar y  

Figure F18. Method for logging structures, Expedition 376. Top and botto m offsets from top of section of a structure are logged where the structur e intersects the center line of a section half surface. A. Distributed structure s are logged for the interval over which they occur. B. Discrete structures ar e logged over the interval the structure intersects the center line of sectio n half surface. If structural features do not cross center line of core, then thei r center point is logged as its interval. If structural feature is a vein or fractur e network, then the interval over which the network occurs is logged.

contacts and structural features like alteration veins were measure d in coordination with other core description groups.  

Conventions for structural studies established during previou s “hard rock” drilling projects (e.g., Ocean Drilling Program [ODP ] Legs 118, 131, 140, 147, 153, 176, 179, 206, and 209; Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 304/305, 309/312, 335, an d 345; and IODP Expedition 360 [Shipboard Scientific Party, 1989, 1991, 1992a, 1992b, 1992c, 1993a, 1993b, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2004; Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 309/312 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012; Gillis et al., 2014; MacLeod e t al., 2017]) were generally followed during Expedition 376. Definitions of structural measurements and descriptive parameters wer e further refined during Expeditions 335, 345, 352, and 360 to configure DESClogik for hard rock descriptions. DESClogik was used t o enter and upload the information into the LIMS database (see Introduction).  

# Structural measurements  

Orientation measurements were made only on core pieces tha t had an established upcore direction, which is determined for piece s longer than ${\sim}5~\mathrm{cm}$ (piece lengths $\geq\!5\;\mathrm{cm}$ ensure that a piece canno t rotate around a horizontal axis resulting in an uncertain upcore orientation). Structural features categorized as magmatic/volcanic, crystal-plastic, or brittle, together with alteration, igneous, and sedimentary contacts, were logged by intervals in centimeters from th e top of each section. Depth intervals of structures were recorded a s the distance from the top of the section $\left(0\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ to the top and bottom of the feature where the feature intersects the center of the section half surface (Figure F18). If the structure does not intersect th e core center line, the depth to the center portion of the structure wa s recorded. Structures were measured on the archive half relative t o the standard IODP CRF. The CRF is defined by the plane normal t o the axis of the borehole and is referred to as the horizontal plane. On this plane, a $360^{\circ}$ net is used with pseudosouth ( $\ensuremath{^{180^{\circ}}}$ ; $-x$ -direction) pointing into the archive half and pseudonorth $\left(000^{\circ}\right.$ ; $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction) pointing from the split surface out of the archive half (Figur e  

Figure F19. CRF and method for measuring the orientation of planar features, Expedition 376. A. Apparent dip and apparent dip azimuth measure d on the cut face. B. Second apparent dip and apparent dip azimuth measure d on side of core. C. If the structure intersects the end of a piece, the secon d apparent dip is zero and the strike is directly measured. Two apparent di p measurements are combined to calculate true dip and dip azimuth.

F1). The cut surface of the section half, therefore, is a vertical plan e striking $090^{\circ}{-}270^{\circ}$ .  

Orientation of structural features is usually determined by making two apparent dip measurements. One apparent dip angle of planar features was measured on the split face of the core with a n azimuth of either $090^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ (Figure F19A). To obtain a true di p value, a second apparent dip was measured in a section perpendicular to the split face with a dip azimuth of either $000^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$ (Figur e F19B). The two apparent dips and dip azimuths were used to calculate the true dip $(0^{\circ}{-}90^{\circ})$ and dip azimuth $(0^{\circ}{-}360^{\circ})$ (i.e., the bearin g of maximum dip in the CRF). If the feature intersected the upper o r lower surface of the core piece, measurements of the strike could b e made directly in the CRF and recorded as the trend of a line wit h zero dip angle (Figure F19C). When combined with an apparent di p measurement made on the cut surface of the core, calculation of th e true dip and dip azimuth in the CRF could be made. If a feature wa s exposed on the surface of the core (i.e., a fracture or vein definin g the top or bottom of a piece), the true dip and dip azimuth wer e measured directly on the feature with no need for another measurement or calculation. True dip and dip azimuth in the CRF were calculated using a macro in Microsoft Excel written by Dr. Michae l Cheadle for ODP Leg 209 or the Stereonet 10 program developed b y Allmendinger et al. (2011) and Cardozo and Allmendinger (2013 ) and imported into the various structure worksheets in the Macroscopic workbook in DESClogik. All structural measurements mad e on the core were reported in DESClogik and are separated based o n whether the orientation was calculated from two apparent dips o r measured directly. Where linear structural elements were observe d (e.g., slickenlines on a fault or elongate vesicles), the trend an d plunge or the rake of the lineations were measured directly, relativ e to the CRF. The sense of shear on fault surfaces was determined b y structures such as groove marks or steps in slickensides. Senses o f shear for CPFs were determined using the asymmetry of rotate d crystals, porphyroclast-tail systems, or foliation deflection morphologies (e.g., Ramsay and Huber, 1987).  

# Statistical analysis of true-dip vein and fracture data  

Statistical analysis of true dip of discrete planar features wit h small lengths compared with the width of the borehole (e.g., vein s and fractures) requires an understanding of two geometrical effects:  

Figure F20. Predicted distribution of a random set of planar features sampled with a vertical borehole, Expedition 376. Curve I (Equation E6) show s the effect of spherical geometry on true dip data. Curve II (Equation E8 ) shows bias effect introduced by sampling with a vertical borehole. Curve II I (Equation E9) combines the two effects and shows predicted distribution o f a random set of planes in a vertical borehole centered around $45^{\circ}$ dip.  

![](images/a33bc2e86ffe485a3fb968c860a8e8c77cce5d7d4374620b39c22bad29b1dc93.jpg)  
• The length-scale or spherical effect, which leads to over-representation of steeply dipping planar structures; and • The so-called borehole effect, which leads to preferential sampling of shallow-dipping planar structures compared with more steeply dipping structures.  

# Length-scale or spherical effect  

A purely random distribution of planes represented by poles i n any given area on a unit hemisphere will, on average, contain th e same number of poles, irrespective of the position on the uni t sphere (Martel, 1999). In any given dip interval, the number of pole s is a function of the number of poles intercepting the correspondin g arc on the unit sphere. By integration, it can be shown that the number of planes $(N)$ with a given dip (α) is obtained by  

$$
N=C\sin(\alpha),
$$  

where $C$ is a constant. The resultant distribution for a theoretical random data set is shown in Figure F20. The dip data are biase d such that there is an over-representation of steeper dips as a resul t of the spherical geometry effect on the true dip data.  

# Borehole effect  

A further consideration is the effect of sampling bias introduce d by the vertical nature of a borehole (see Terzaghi, 1965; Newmark e t al., 1985). If we consider an equally spaced set of horizontal planes, then the number $(N)$ encountered in a unit borehole length $(l)$ i s given by  

$$
N=l/\mathbf{s},
$$  

where s is the spacing of the planes. For vertical planes, either 1 or  0 planes are encountered in the borehole. Thus, for the general case o f dipping planes,  

$$
N=l\cos(\alpha)/\mathbf{s}.
$$  

Thus, this effect tends to bias the data in favor of shallow dips (Figure F20).  

Combining the two aforementioned effects (i.e., Equations E6 and E8) results in the following relationship:  

$$
N=\mathrm{K}\sin(\upalpha)\cos(\upalpha),
$$  

where K is a constant (i.e., scaling factor) and the distribution derived from Equation E9 results in a frequency maximum at $45^{\circ}$ inclination (i.e., dip) (Figure F20). Consequently, we present a rando m distribution curve derived from Equation E9 on all appropriate frequency distribution plots for fracture and vein dips to help asses s whether dip distributions are random or nonrandom.  

If the length scale of structures such as magmatic contacts, layering, or CPFs considerably exceeds the width of the borehole, the n the length scale or spherical effect does not apply. However, thes e features are still subject to the borehole effect, so steeply dippin g features will be undersampled relative to gently dipping features. For a more in-depth discussion, the reader is referred to Marte l (1999).  

# Macroscopic core description and terminology Workflow organization  

Whole-round pieces were oriented for splitting prior to curatio n by a member of the structural geology and the igneous petrolog y and volcanology teams. Cores were marked and split to maximiz e the dip of planar structures so that the dominant structure dips toward $090^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ in the CRF (Figure F19). This convention was adopted primarily for ease of structural feature measurement. Wher e no obvious structures were present, cores were marked to maximiz e contiguity and/or to ensure that representative material is presen t in both the working and archive halves of the core. During Expedition 376, the structural geologist was assisted by a member of th e igneous petrology and volcanology team who worked on the opposite shift. Each shift was responsible for making all possible observations  and  measurements  throughout  the  expedition.  Al l descriptions and structural measurements during Expedition 37 6 were made on the archive halves.  

Each core section was described and logged with detailed structural information. This information was then entered into th e DESClogik framework. The DESClogik worksheets listed belo w contain data on the interval, type of structure, intensity, orientation, and comments:  

• (Sub)volcanic worksheet: contact characterization in conjunction with the igneous petrology and volcanology team, including contact type, geometry, and orientation.   
• Volcaniclastic_sedimentary worksheet: contact characterization in conjunction with the igneous petrology and volcanology team, including contact type, geometry, and orientation.   
• Alteration worksheet: contact characterization in conjunction with the alteration team, including contact type, geometry, and orientation.   
• Vein worksheet: alteration vein characterization in conjunction with the alteration team, including vein fill, geometry, width, generation, and orientation.   
• Vein and fracture density worksheet: number of veins or fractures per $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ .   
• Structure worksheet: fault rock type and intensity, apparent fault offset, sense of shear, fracture morphology, CPF intensity, magmatic/volcanic fabric intensity, and orientation.  

The most representative and/or prominent structural features i n the Expedition 376 cores are plotted on the VCD macroscopi c graphic reports: the presence of faults, fractures, or veins. Structural descriptions include the main vein fill mineral(s) for that interval along with a description of major structural features lik e volcanic fabric, fault, slickenline, or igneous, volcaniclastic, or sedimentary contact.  

Short explanations for terms and abbreviations used in the respective structural categories, given below, are based on definition s in Ramsay and Huber (1987), Twiss and Moores (1992), Passchie r and Trouw (2005), and Davis et al. (2011).  

# Volcanic/magmatic structures  

Volcanic, intrusive, and structural contacts were measured an d described in accordance with the igneous petrology and volcanology worksheets ([Sub]volcanic and Plutonic) (see Igneous petrology and volcanology):  

• Bottom contact or boundary: curviplanar, planar, and irregular.   
• Bottom contact or boundary definition: wavy, sharp, scoured, and gradational.   
• Bottom contact or boundary attitude: subvertical, inclined, subhorizonal, vertical, and horizontal.   
• Orientation: dip and dip azimuth in the CRF.  

Volcaniclastic and sedimentary structures were measured an d described in accordance with the igneous petrology and volcanology worksheet (Volcaniclastic_sedimentary):  

• Bottom contact or boundary: curviplanar, planar, and irregular.   
• Bottom contact or boundary definition: wavy, sharp, scoured, and gradational.   
• Bottom contact or boundary attitude: subvertical, inclined, subhorizontal, vertical, and horizontal.   
• Sedimentary structure and volcaniclastic structure.   
• Orientation: dip and dip azimuth in the CRF.  

Volcanic fabrics were defined by the presence and intensity o f any shape-preferred orientation of volcanic phases or features (e.g., phenocrysts or vesicles). A magmatic and/or volcanic fabric intensity of 0 was attributed to intervals characterized by isotropic texture and/or where no igneous textures are preserved because o f crystal-plastic or alteration overprint. Descriptions of magmati c and/or volcanic fabrics were captured in the Structure worksheet i n the Macroscopic workbook and include the following:  

• Magmatic/volcanic fabric intensity and associated intensity rank (Figure F21): • $0=$ isotropic. • $1=$ weak. • $2=$ moderate. • 3 = strong.   
• Orientation of the magmatic fabric: dip and dip azimuth, as well as trend and plunge or rake of lineation, where measurable in the CRF.  

The final characterization of magmatic/volcanic fabrics wer e performed after petrographic inspection, when possible.  

# Crystal-plastic fabrics  

CPFs include planar or linear fabrics defined by crystals exhibiting plastic strain. Descriptions for CPFs were captured in the Structure worksheet of the Macroscopic workbook and include th e following:

• CPF intensity and associated intensity rank (Figure F21):  

• $0=$ no fabric. • $1=$ weakly foliated. • $2=$ strongly foliated. • $3=$ porphyroclastic-protomylonite. • $4=$ mylonite. • $5=$ ultramylonite. • Orientation of the CPF (dip and dip azimuth, where measurable in the CRF; in practice, almost exclusively foliation planes).  

The final characterization of CPFs was performed after petrographic inspection, when possible.  

# Alteration veins  

Alteration vein descriptions were captured in the Vein worksheet in the Macroscopic workbook. The descriptions include characterization of the vein margin, structure of the vein fill, and vei n generation and other structures, together with orientation. The nature of the alteration vein fill material was identified in consultatio n with the alteration team. Descriptions of veins include the following:  

• Vein morphology: planar, en echelon, anastomosing, stringer, reticulated, or dendritic (Table T11).   
• Vein texture: laminated, massive, vuggy, comb, coarse, or fibrous (Table T12).   
• Sense of shear: normal (n), reversed (r), dextral (d), sinistral (s), a combination of these (nd, ns, rd, or rs), or unknown.   
• Mean vein perpendicular thickness (in centimeters).   
• Vein offset (in millimeters), if present and where measurable.   
• Orientation of the vein given by dip and dip azimuth and trend and plunge of associated lineation in the CRF, where measureable.  

• Vein density (Figure F21). In practice, discrete and network veins were considered. The highest density coincides with the presence of network veins. • $0=$ no open veins/ $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ . • $1=-1$ vein $/10\,\mathrm{cm}$ . • $2=1{-}5$ veins $\operatorname{\mathrm{70}}\,_{\mathrm{Cm}}$ . • $3=5{-}10$ veins $/10\,\mathrm{cm}$ . • $4=10{-}20$ veins/10 cm. • $5=>\!20$ veins/ $\operatorname{\prime}10\,\mathsf{c m}$ .  

Density of veins was recorded in the Vein_fracture_densit y worksheet of the Macroscopic workbook.  

# Brittle deformation  

Brittle fabrics described during Expedition 376 include breccias , faults (defined as fractures with shear displacement), and fractures. Drilling-induced fractures, defined by subhorizontal fractures wit h rounded edges and fresh breaks, were not measured or recorded. However, drilling disturbance was recorded by the igneous petrology and volcanology team. Brittle deformation descriptions wer e captured in the Structure worksheet of the Macroscopic workboo k and include the following:  

• Fault rock type: fault gouge, fault breccia, cataclasite, hydrothermal breccia, or pseudotachylite.   
• Fault rock cohesion: • $1=$ incohesive. • $2=$ semicohesive. • $3=$ cohesive.   
• Apparent fault offset (in centimeters), where measurable.   
• Sense of shear: normal (n), reversed (r), dextral (d), sinistral (s), a combination of these (nd, ns, rd, or rs), or unknown.   
• Deformation intensity for brittle fabrics, based on the percentage of matrix present in each fault rock (Figure F21); thin section descriptions, where available, aided this categorization. In practice, minor fracturing was assigned if veins or fractures were present, indicating minimal brittle deformation: • $0=$ undeformed. • $1=$ minor fracturing, no significant grain size reduction. • $2=$ moderate fracturing, no significant grain size reduction. • $3=$ dense anastomosing fracturing, incipient grain size reduction. • $4=$ well-developed grain size reduction, clast rotation, $20\%-$ $70\%$ matrix. • $5=$ cataclasite, ${>}70\%$ matrix.   
• Clast/matrix ratio in fault rock (in percent).   
• Average size of clast in fault rock (in millimeters).   
• Clast morphology: angular or rounded.   
• Fracture morphology: planar, curved, or irregular (Figure F22).   
• Fracture perpendicular thickness (in centimeters), where measureable.   
• Orientation given by dip and dip azimuth of fracture and trend and plunge of associated lineation (e.g., slickensides/slickenlines/slickenfibers).   
• Fracture density (Figure F21): • $0=\mathtt{n o}$ open fracture $^\mathrm{10\,cm}$ . • $1=-1$ fracture $^{/10}\,\mathrm{cm}$ . • $2=1{-}5$ fractures $^\mathrm{10\,cm}$ . • $3=>5$ fractures/ $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ .  

Density of fractures was recorded in the Vein_fracture_densit y worksheet of the Macroscopic workbook.  

# Microstructure description and terminology Workflow organization  

To better characterize different types of deformation, microstructural features of interesting and/or prominent mesoscopi c structures were studied. Thin sections were examined to  

• Characterize the microstructure of the rocks and • Confirm macroscopic descriptions of structures.  

Shipboard thin sections were systematically oriented relative t o the CRF if in an oriented piece, as marked on each thin section (Figure F2). Marking two directions is necessary to achieve unambiguous orientation of the thin sections cut parallel to the cut surface o f the core. If oriented, each thin section was marked with a half arro w pointing in the upcore direction and the half arrow side of the symbol in the $+y.$ -direction (toward $090^{\circ}$ in the working half). Becaus e all thin sections were cut parallel to the cut face of the core, this was the only marking required. Macroscopic observations were refine d by the microscopic description. Digital photomicrographs wer e taken to document microstructures that best illustrate different deformation styles, crosscutting relationships, and intensity recorde d in the LIMS database. Microstructural notes were entered into th e TS_structures worksheet in the Thin section workbook.  

# Microstructure terminology  

Expedition 376 followed the terminology used during ODP Leg s 153, 176, and 209; Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition s 304/305 (Expedition 304/305 Scientists, 2006), 345 (Gillis et al., 2014); and IODP Expedition 360 (MacLeod et al., 2017), whic h broadly follows the terminology of Passchier and Trouw (2005). I n the TS_structures worksheet of the Thin section workbook, we described the following microscopic features for each thin section:

• Comments: any details of microstructures.  

# Geochemistry  

# Headspace gas analysis Headspace analysis of hydrocarbon gases  

One sample per core was collected, if possible, for headspace hydrocarbon gas analysis as part of the standard shipboard safet y monitoring procedure, as described in Kvenvolden and McDonal d (1986) and Pimmel and Claypool (2001), to ensure that drilled materials did not contain amounts of hydrocarbons above prescribe d safety levels.  

A $\mathrm{{\sim}5~c m^{3}}$ sample of small, crushed rock pieces was taken fro m the core immediately after it was brought on deck and sectioned. The sample was placed in a $20~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ glass vial and sealed with  a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/silicon septum and a crimped aluminum cap. During Expedition 376, headspace samples were, i n most cases, taken at the bottom of Section 1 of each core. Each vial containing the headspace sample was placed in an oven at $80^{\circ}C$ fo r $30\,\mathrm{\min}$ . A $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ aliquot of any released hydrocarbon gases wa s withdrawn from the headspace vial with a standard gas syringe an d manually injected into an Agilent/Hewlett Packard 6890 Series I I gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detecto r

set at $250^{\circ}C$ . The column ( $2\;\mathrm{mm}$ inner diameter [ID]; $6.3\;\mathrm{mm}$ OD ) was packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep (Restek). The GC oven program was set to remain at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ with a subsequent ris e to $150^{\circ}C$ at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ . Each analysis required $15\;\mathrm{min}$ .  

The results were processed using the Hewlett Packard 336 5 ChemStation data software package. The chromatographic response was calibrated using nine different gas standards an d checked daily. Concentrations of hydrocarbon gases are reported i n millimoles per kilogram of pore water as well as parts per million b y volume (ppmv). Pore water hydrocarbon abundance was calculate d using the weight, density, and porosity of the rock sample. Reporte d data are normalized to total pore water volume.  

# Headspace analysis of $\mathsf{H}_{2},\mathsf{C}\mathsf{o},\Sigma\mathsf{C}\mathsf{o}_{2},$ and acid-volatile sulfide  

Two separate headspace samples, each composed of $1.5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ o f small crushed rock pieces, were taken from the core immediately after it was brought on deck and sectioned. Each sample was the n placed in a $20\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass vial containing either $3\,\mathrm{mL}$ of distilled wate r plus a small amount of $\mathrm{HgCl_{2}}$ to prevent microbial activity or $3\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $1~\mathrm{mol/L}$ HCl solution to extract $\Sigma{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and acid-volatile sulfid e (AVS) from the pore fluid of the rock material. AVS is defined a s those materials which release $\Sigma\mathsf{H}_{2}S$ if treated with HCl (Rickard an d Morse, 2005). Such materials can include dissolved and volatile reduced S(−II) species (e.g., $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ , $\mathrm{HS^{-}}$ , $\mathrm{FeHS^{+}}$ , FeS clusters, and iro n sulfide nanoparticles) and solid phase minerals such as mackinawit e (FeS). Pyrite $(\mathrm{FeS}_{2})$ is not usually considered to contribute to AV S because HCl-leach methods allegedly do not dissolve pyrite.  

The vial was sealed with a PTFE-coated butyl rubber septu m and a crimped aluminum cap. The vial for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO analysis (wit h $\mathrm{HgCl_{2}})$ ) was then placed in the oven at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ . A $0.5~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ aliquot of the headspace was withdrawn from the vial with a standard gas syringe and manually injected into a GL Science GC400 0 GC equipped with a helium ionization detector (HID) set at $160^{\circ}C$ for quantification of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and CO. The column $2~\mathrm{mm}$ ID; $6.3\ \mathrm{mm}$ OD) was packed with molesieve $5\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ (Agilent/Hewlett Packard). Th e GC oven program was set at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ isothermal. For the second sample (with HCl), a $0.1~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ aliquot of gas was withdrawn from th e headspace with a standard gas syringe and manually injected into  a GL Science GC4000 GC equipped with a HID set at $240^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for quantification of $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ . The column $\mathrm{2~mm}$ ID; $6.3\;\mathrm{mm}$ OD) was packe d with Porapack Q (Agilent/Hewlett Packard). The GC oven progra m was set at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ isothermal. In addition, a $1~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ aliquot of solutio n was extracted from the acidified headspace vial with a disposabl e syringe. This aliquot was measured by an electrochemical $\Sigma\mathsf{H}_{2}S$ probe (H2S-40N, Unisense, Denmark). The $\Sigma\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ concentratio n was calibrated with seawater containing 0.05, 0.5, and $5\ \mathrm{mmol/L}$ $\mathrm{Na}_{2}S$ and acidified using $1~\mathrm{mol/L}$ HCl at a temperature matchin g that of measured conditions.  

The chromatographic response was calibrated using two different concentrations of gas standards and checked daily. The concentrations of the analyzed $\mathrm{H}_{2},\mathrm{CO},\mathrm{CH}_{4},\Sigma\mathrm{CO}_{2},$ and AVS were reporte d in micromoles or millimoles per kilogram of pore water calculate d using the weight, density, and porosity of the rock sample and normalized to total pore water volume, as for hydrocarbons.  

# Borehole fluid geochemistry  

# Sampling  

After the final drilling depth was achieved, borehole fluids wer e collected at selected depths from within the drill string using th e mechanical clock-activated Kuster FTS tool attached to the cor e line. Timing of the clock was set such that the FTS remained at th e target depth for $15~\mathrm{min}$ after the closing time to accommodate potential uncertainty in the clock function at elevated temperatures. The design and deployment of the Kuster FTS are detailed i n Downhole logging operations.  

# Shipboard processing  

Volatile-rich aqueous borehole fluids were extracted from th e $600\,\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool and processed aboard the ship immediatel y upon recovery of the tool. The transfer head assembly was outfitte d with a $25\ \mathrm{MPa}$ (250 bar) pressure gauge and a gas-tight extractio n line (Figure F23) for shipboard analysis of volatile species $\mathrm{[H_{2}}$ an d $\Sigma\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ $\mathrm{\left[\SigmaH_{2}S\mathrm{~=~}H_{2}S\mathrm{~+~}H S^{-}\mathrm{~+~}S^{2-}\right]})$ , dissolved inorganic constituent s (salinity, pH, alkalinity, Al, Ba, Br, Ca, Cl, Co, Cr, $\mathrm{{Cu},}$ Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Si, $\Sigma{\cal S O}_{4}$ $[\Sigma\mathrm{SO}_{4}=\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{\mathrm{~2-}}+\mathrm{HSO}_{4^{-}}+\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{SO}_{4}],$ , Sr, Ti, V, and $Z\mathbf{n}^{\mathrm{~\!~}}$ ), and particles (Al, Ba, Co, Cr, $\mathrm{{Cu},}$ Fe, Mn, Ni, Ti, V, $Z\mathfrak{n}$ , total S, total C, and total N). Headspace gases were sampled from the top valv e via the extraction line with the $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool in a horizontal position. The sample was homogenized by rotating the tool twice, and the fluids were expelled out the top valve by applyin g gentle backpressure to the open bottom valve using a portable glov e bag filled with $\Nu_{2}$ . Sample allocation was determined based on th e borehole fluid volume recovered and analytical priorities based o n the expedition objectives. The borehole fluids collected from th e $600\;\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool were divided into aliquots for the followin g shipboard analyses:  

• $3\,\mathrm{mL}$ for salinity measurement with a refractometer, $\mathsf{p H},$ , and alkalinity;   
• $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for ion chromatographic (IC) analysis of major anions and cations;   
• $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for analysis of major, minor, and trace elements by ICPAES;   
• $9\,\mathrm{mL}$ for $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ analysis by gas chromatography; and   
• $30\;\mathrm{mL}$ for $\Sigma\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ analysis by gravimetry.  

During sample processing, aliquots were extracted in priorit y order for immediate analysis of $\mathsf{p H}$ $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C};$ ; 1 bar), $\mathrm{H}_{2},$ and dissolve d $\Sigma\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ . Aliquots for shipboard analysis of dissolved inorganic specie s were then collected in acid-washed, high-density polyethylen e (HDPE) bottles. An aliquot of the unacidified dissolved inorgani c sample was diluted 100-fold $(\mathrm{v/v})$ and analyzed for dissolved Si vi a ICP-AES. Aliquots for shipboard dissolved transition metal analyses were filtered immediately through $0.22\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ polyethersulfone filters  using  acid-washed  syringes;  aliquots  for  total  and  tota l dissolvable metals were left unfiltered. Aliquots for total metal s were prepared after complete digestion of an aliquot of unfiltere d fluid fraction with concentrated trace-metal grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ on a ho t plate for $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ . The sample was then diluted with $10\%$ concentrate d Optima $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . All other transition metal aliquots, including th e dissolved and total dissolvable aliquots, were acidified to $1\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ wit h concentrated Optima $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . A separate fluid aliquot was collecte d for $\Sigma{S O_{4}}$ and sparged with ultra–high purity Ar ${\bf\left\langle{\sim}30\ m i n\right\rangle}$ to remove volatile S species such as $\Sigma\mathsf{H}_{2}S$ and $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that may otherwis e oxidize and result in artificial elevation of measured $\Sigma{\cal S O}_{4}$ abundances.  

Hydrothermal fluid samples often contain transition metal–ric h precipitates that can form during the time period between samplin g and extraction from the sampler. In addition, at high-acidity, hightemperature conditions in the borehole, the steel drill pipe and th e Kuster FTS itself can contribute particle-forming metals and othe r possible species to the fluids. After the complete removal of th e borehole fluid sample from the $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool, the dreg s fraction, which is composed of precipitates that formed in the sampler either before or after valve closure, was collected on $0.22~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ Millipore Durapore filters by rinsing the interior of the Kuster FT S with reagent-grade acetone and nanopure water, followed by vacuum filtration. A fraction of each solid dregs aliquot was digested i n concentrated trace metal–grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ in PTFE beakers at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ until near-dryness. Digested dregs were then dissolved in $10\,\mathrm{\:wt\%}$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and analyzed via ICP-AES following the same methods as fo r aqueous determination (see below).  

# Shipboard analyses  

Borehole fluids were analyzed following protocols similar t o those used for interstitial water (IW), as described in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation, in addition to methods modified after thos e described in McDermott et al. (2018). Precision and accuracy wer e tested using International Association for the Physical Sciences o f the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater with the following composition: $2.35\;\mathrm{mmol/L}$ alkalinity, $10.53\ \mathrm{mmol/L\subseta,\,54.11\mmol/L\Mg},$ $10.46~\mathrm{\mmol/L}$ K, $90.62~\,\upmu\mathrm{mol/L}$ Sr, $28.93~\mathrm{\mmol/L}$ $\mathrm{SO}_{4},$ 559. 8 mmol/L Cl, $478.7\;\mathrm{mmol/L}\;\mathrm{Na}$ , and $426.0\ \upmu\mathrm{mol/L}$ B. Borehole flui d components reported here that have low abundances in seawate r (e.g., Fe, Mn, Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Si) are based on calibrations using certified stock solutions (Gieskes et al., 1991).  

Dissolved aliquots for trace metal analysis (filtered immediatel y as samples were drawn) were diluted and analyzed directly via ICPAES. Total dissolvable trace metal aliquots (unfiltered as sample s were drawn) were filtered ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{h}$ after sample collection and acidification to $1\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ with Optima-grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3},$ and the aqueous fractio n was diluted and analyzed via ICP-AES. The digested total metal s sample was then dissolved in $10\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and analyzed via ICPAES.  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and ${\mathsf{p H}}$ were measured immediately afte r borehole fluid extraction following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinity was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handheld refractometer (Fisher Model S66366). The valve system was used to transfer two drops of borehole fluid to the salinit y refractometer, and the corresponding salinity was recorded. Flui d $\mathsf{p H}$ was measured with a combination glass electrode standardize d with $\mathsf{p H}\parallel4,\,4;$ , and 7 buffers $\left(\pm0.02\right)$ at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C};$ National Institute o f Standards and Technology [NIST] traceable) for low-pH sample s and with pH 4, 7, and 10 buffers for near-neutral $\mathsf{p H}$ samples. Alkalinity was determined by Gran titration  with  an autotitrato r (Metrohm 794 Basic Titrino) using $0.1\;\mathrm{mol/L}$ HCl at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Certifie d Reference Material 104 was used to calibrate the acid. IAPSO standard seawater was used for calibration and was analyzed at the beginning  and  end  of  the  sample  set  for  each  site.  Repeate d measurements of IAPSO standard seawater alkalinity yielded a precision of $<\!0.8\%$ .  

# Ion chromatography  

Anion (Cl, $\Sigma S O_{4},$ and Br) and cation $(\mathrm{Na},\,\mathrm{Mg},\,\mathrm{K},$ and Ca) elemental abundances were analyzed using a Metrohm 850 ion chromatograph equipped with a Metrohm 858 Professional Sampl e Processor as an autosampler. The sample solutions used were diluted 1:100 or 1:200, depending on anticipated species abundances, with nanopure water using specifically designated pipettes. A seawater standard calibration curve was generated using IAPSO dilutions of $67\times$ , $80\times$ , $100\times$ , $150\times$ , $200\times$ , and $350\times$ the pure seawate r composition. Reproducibility (expressed as the percent of one relative standard deviation [RSD]) for $100\times$ IAPSO analyses interspersed with the unknowns were: $0.7\%$ Br, $0.5\%$ Cl, $0.7\%\,\Sigma\mathrm{SO}_{4},2.6\%$ Ca, $1.3\%$ Mg, $0.6\%$ K, and $0.5\%$ Na $\left(N=22\right)$ ).  

# Inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry  

Major and minor elements were analyzed on borehole fluids b y ICP-AES with an Agilent 5110 ICP-OES spectrometer. The general method for shipboard ICP-AES analysis of samples is described i n ODP Technical Note 29 (Murray et al., 2000) and the shipboard use r guide for ICP-AES, with modifications as indicated in the Expedition 369 methods chapter (Huber et al., 2019).  

Samples and standards were diluted 1:50 using $2\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ fo r metal and trace element (Al, Ba, Co, Cr, $\mathrm{{Cu},}$ Fe, Mn, Ni, Sr, Ti, V, an d $Z\mathfrak{n})$ and major constituent (Na, Mg, Si, S, K, and Ca) analyses. Eac h batch of samples run on the ICP-AES includes blanks and standar d solutions of known concentrations. Each sample or standard aspirated was counted three times from the same dilute solution in  a given sample run. Following each instrument run, the measured ra w intensity values were transferred to a data file and corrected for instrument drift and blank. If necessary, a drift correction was applie d to each element by linear interpolation between the drift-monitoring solutions and by using internal standards (Be, In, Sc, and Sb).  

Standardization of major cations was achieved by successive dilution of IAPSO to $20\times$ $\times,\,40\times,\,100;$ , and $1000\times$ . Replicate analyses o f $40\times$ IAPSO were run as unknowns throughout each batch of analyses to yield estimates for precision and accuracy. Reproducibility fo r $40\times$ IAPSO interspersed with the unknowns was between $1\%$ an d $3\%$ $\left(N=12\right)$ . Because of the high concentration of matrix salts in th e borehole fluid samples at 1:50 dilution, matrix matching the calibration standards for minor elements was necessary to achieve accurate results by ICP-AES. A matrix solution that approximate d seawater Na and Cl concentrations was prepared by adding trac e metal clean $\mathtt{N a C l}$ to a stock standard solution prepared from ultrapure primary standards (Science Plasma-CAL) in $2\%\ \mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ solution. The stock solution was then serially diluted in the same $2~\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution and was spiked with the same internal standar d suite as the samples just prior to analysis. For calibrated trace elements, the reproducibility of duplicate measurements was betwee n $1\%$ and $3\%$ .  

# Dissolved gases $(\mathsf{H}_{2}$ and $\Sigma\mathsf{H}_{2}S_{\mathrm{.}}$ )  

Dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ was analyzed via gas chromatography in accordance with methods described in McDermott et al. (2018) an d IODP user manuals for shipboard instrumentation. Dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ was analyzed by gas chromatography with thermal conductivity detection (TCD) and Ar carrier gas (Agilent 6890) after headspace extraction using a gas-tight glass syringe (McDermott et al., 2018). Samples and standards were injected into a $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ calibrated loop. Gas components were then separated by a $30\,\mathrm{m}\times0.53\,\mathrm{mm}\times40\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ HP-PLOT Q capillary column followed in series by a $30\mathrm{~m~}\times\,0.53$ $\mathrm{mm}\times50\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ HP-PLOT molesieve capillary column, after which $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ was detected via TCD. Valve and Ar blanks were monitored, as wer e $\Nu_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2},$ to ensure that injections entrained minimal ambient air. Samples were bracketed with injections of calibrated $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gases dail y (100, 1000, and 10000 ppmv of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ into a sample loop of precisel y known volume). Dissolved $\Sigma\mathsf{H}_{2}S$ was precipitated as $\mathrm{Ag}_{2}S$ in $5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{AgNO_{3}}$ and recovered on a $0.22~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ pore size filter via vacuum filtration in accordance with methods described in McDermott et al. (2018). Concentrations were then gravimetrically determined.  

# Contamination assessment  

Between samples and before each deployment on the core line, the sample chamber of the $600\,\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool was cleaned wit h analytical-grade acetone, scrubbed with a stainless steel brush, swabbed with a laboratory tissue, and rinsed with nanopure water. O-rings were checked for mechanical damage and embrittlement, replaced as needed, and lubricated. The sampler is made up of 17- 4 PH stainless steel $\mathrm{(15-17.5\%}$ chromium, $3{-}5\%$ nickel, and $3{-}5\%$ copper) and Monel, a nickel-copper alloy (as much as $67\%$ Ni) that contains minor amounts of iron, manganese, carbon, and silicon. Silicone- and $\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ -based greases were used to lubricate O-rings. Al l of these constituents may contribute to contamination of the sampled borehole fluids. They are likely to be chemically reactive unde r the acidic borehole conditions encountered (measured pH down t o 1.8; see Principal results in the Site U1528 chapter [de Ronde et al., 2019]). Therefore, a series of contamination assessments was performed by setting up the sampler in the deployment configuratio n and filling it with the following solutions, closing the valves, an d waiting $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ before proceeding with processing and analysi s of aqueous samples for major ions and metals (Table T15):  

• $18.2\,\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm}$ Barnstead nanopure water and • Seawater from the JOIDES Resolution drilling fluid reservoir, untreated.  

The sampler was cleaned fully, and the O-rings were lubricate d between each contamination test. Contamination tests were run before the first samples were taken.  

Pre- and posttest deionized water and drilling seawater were analyzed via ion chromatography for major anion and cation element s and via ICP-AES for minor and trace elements. Shipboard result s indicate that the $600~\mathrm{mL}$ Kuster FTS tool does not contaminate fo r anions or cations that are present in major concentrations in th e fluid. However, metals including Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and especiall y Ni were contributed during these room temperature tests. Thus, th e sampler most likely reacts to an even greater degree under th e acidic, high-temperature borehole conditions encountered (measured pH down to 1.8; see Principal results in the Site U1528 chapter [de Ronde et al., 2019]).  

# Interstitial water geochemistry  

Whole-round core samples of unconsolidated materials, generally $10{-}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ long, were partitioned immediately after the core wa s brought on deck, capped, and taken to the laboratory for pore flui d processing. After extrusion from the core liner, contamination fro m seawater and sediment smearing was removed by scraping the cor e surface with a spatula. The TDCS core samples had ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{cm}$ of material from the OD, and the top and bottom faces were removed. I W samples from RCB coring were not scraped because they were collected from cores composed of relatively loose sand and coarse r grained $(\sim\!0.1{-}0.5\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{~cm~}}$ diameter) volcanic pebbles. The core wa s placed into a titanium squeezer (modified after Manheim an d Sayles, 1974) and compressed using a laboratory hydraulic press. The squeezed pore fluids were filtered through a prewashed Whatman No. 1 filter placed in the squeezers above a titanium mes h screen. Approximately $2{-}12~\mathrm{mL}$ of pore fluid was collected in precleaned plastic syringes attached to the squeezing assembly an d subsequently filtered through a $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ Gelman polysulfone disposable filter. In some sections, fluid recovery was as low as $2~\mathrm{mL}$ after squeezing the sediment for as long as ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{h}$ .

After the fluids were extracted, the squeezer parts were cleane d with shipboard water and rinsed with deionized water. Parts wer e dried thoroughly prior to reuse.  

Sample allocation was determined based on the pore fluid volume recovered and on analytical priorities based on the expeditio n objectives. The IW extracted from the compressed sediment sample was divided into aliquots (in priority order) for the followin g analyses:  

• $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for IC analysis of major anions and cations;   
• $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ for ICP-AES analysis of major, minor, and trace elements; and   
• $3\,\mathrm{mL}$ for $\mathsf{p H}$ and alkalinity.  

Shipboard analytical protocols were identical to the method s described for borehole fluid analyses.  

# Hard rock geochemistry  

# Sample preparation  

Unconsolidated samples were taken from the interiors of core s with $10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ cubes and then oven-dried for ${\sim}24\mathrm{~h~}$ to remove water. In some cases, residues of samples processed for IW, includin g squeeze cakes and rock chips, were also prepared for shipboar d analysis. Hard rock samples were prepared from $5{-}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ of rock. Solid rock samples were cut from the cores using a diamond-blad e rock saw. Outer surfaces of rock samples were ground using a diamond-impregnated grinding wheel to remove saw marks and an y drilling-induced alteration on the exterior.  

Each cleaned solid rock sample was placed in a beaker containing isopropanol and agitated in an ultrasonic bath for $15~\mathrm{min}$ . Th e isopropanol was decanted, and the samples were then agitated twic e in an ultrasonic bath in nanopure deionized water $(18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm})$ fo r $10\ \mathrm{min}$ . The cleaned pieces were then dried for $10{-}12\,\mathrm{~h~}$ at $110^{\circ}C$ . After drying, the rock samples were crushed to $<\!1\;\mathrm{cm}$ between tw o Delrin plastic disks in a hydraulic press.  

Considering the high concentration of anhydrite $\left({\mathrm{CaSO}}_{4}\right)$ encountered in many altered volcaniclastic rocks and lavas recovere d during Expedition 376, additional tests were performed to evaluat e the effect of rock powder preparation (e.g., water cleaning) on anhydrite and the potential dissolution of other water-soluble minerals. A test was performed on a relatively anhydrite rich sample (376- U1530A-9R-1, $8{\-}10\;\mathrm{cm})$ ) in which the first and second water rinse s of the ICP-AES wedge were analyzed via ICP-AES for dissolved Ca, S, and other species to determine the extent of water-soluble element loss during powder preparation. For comparison, a groun d powder from the same sample was leached in nanopure water (25 0 mg powder; $15\;\mathrm{mL}$ water) for $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to determine the total amount o f anhydrite present in the sample (as water-soluble Ca and S). Result s for total anhydrite dissolution yielded $1.39\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ $C_{\mathrm{a_{anhydrite}}}$ and 1.1 0 $\mathrm{wt}\%\ S_{\mathrm{anhydrite}}$ in the initial sample. In the rinse solutions, Ca and  S were released in a $\mathrm{{Ca/S}}$ molar ratio of 1.01, indicating that some anhydrite was solubilized. The amount of dissolved $\mathrm{Ca}$ and S release d in combined water rinses of the wedge accounted for only ${\sim}3.3\%$ o f the total anhydrite present in the rock, suggesting minor anhydrit e loss during rock powder preparation. Other species (e.g., K and Al ) were below detection for ICP-AES in the water rinses.  

Crushed chips of rock were ground to a fine powder using  a SPEX 8515 Shatterbox powdering system with a tungsten carbid e mill. A check on contamination from grinding in tungsten carbid e mills was performed during ODP Leg 206 (Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 2003) and found to be negligible for major elements and mos t of the trace elements measured on board (Sc, V, Cr, Ni, Sr, Y, Zr, an d  

Ba). However, a systematic analysis of the shipboard powders fro m Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 304/305 indicate d possible Co contamination during powdering (Godard et al., 2009).  

For most samples, the prepared powder was divided into tw o parts: one portion was processed for XRD and pXRF analysis, an d the other portion was processed for ICP-AES and volatile measurements.  

# Volatile measurements  

Volatile concentrations of rocks were measured on powdere d splits of ICP-AES samples.  

# Carbonates  

The carbonate-associated carbon content of the samples (als o referred to as total inorganic carbon [TIC]) was determined by acidifying ${\sim}40$ to $100~\mathrm{mg}$ of powder with $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of $2~\mathrm{mol/L}$ HCl at $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and measuring the amount of $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ generated using a UIC 5011 $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ coulometer. The gas volume was determined by trapping the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with ethanolamine and titrating coulometrically with hydroxyethyl carbamic acid. The end point of the titration was determined by  a photodetector; the change in light transmittance is proportional t o the inorganic carbon content of the sample.  

All $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ was assumed to derive from dissolution of $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ . N o corrections were made for other carbonate minerals. Results are reported as TIC in micrograms per gram $(\upmu\mathrm{g}/\up g)$ . The detection limi t of this technique was generally between 30 and $50~\upmu\mathrm{g/g}$ . Severa l standards with low TIC concentrations and ignited unaltered dacitic samples were analyzed to improve both the internal precision o f the measurement and assessment of the detection limit.  

# Total carbon, total nitrogen, and total sulfur  

Total carbon (TC), total sulfur, and total nitrogen (TN) content s were determined from an aliquot of the ICP-AES sample powder b y combustion at $>\!900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in a Thermo Electron FlashEA 1112 E A equipped with a Thermo Electron packed column carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur (CHNS)/nitrogen-carbon-sulfur (NCS) analyzer and a TCD for TC, total S, and TN. Between 10 and $40~\mathrm{mg}$ o f powder was weighed into a tin cup and subsequently combusted i n an oxygen gas stream at $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The reaction gases were passe d through a reduction chamber to reduce nitrogen oxides to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ an d the mixture of $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ $S O_{2},$ and $\Nu_{2}$ was separated by GC and detecte d by the TCD. Calibration was based on the NIST 2704 (Buffalo Rive r sediment) reference material standard, which contains $3.35\,\mathrm{\DeltaWt\%}$ TC, $0.18\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ TN, and $0.40\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ TS. A set of in-house synthetic samples was also used for calibrating total sulfur measurements of Senriched samples (see Calibration, blanks, and standards).  

Aliquots of powder (typically ${\sim}20~\mathrm{mg}$ for igneous rocks) wer e weighed on a Cahn C-29 microbalance, with weighing errors conservatively estimated to be $\pm0.2~\mathrm{mg}$ . Powders were packed into ti n containers (Universal Tin Container “light”; Thermo Electron $\mathrm{P/N}$ 240-06400) and mixed with a spatula full of vanadium pentoxid e $\left(\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}\right)$ estimated at $10\pm3\,\mathrm{mg}$ . The samples were placed in a revolving autosampler with 31 spaces and dropped into a $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ resistanc e furnace, where they were combusted in a reactor. The tin capsul e creates a violent flash combustion (Sn has a melting point of onl y $230^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , and the $\mathrm{V_{2}O_{5}}$ generates an oxygen-enriched atmosphere. The oxidized and liberated volatiles were then entrained by a constant helium gas flow through a commercial glass column (Costec h P/N 061110) packed with an oxidation catalyst of tungsten trioxid e $\mathrm{(WO_{3})}$ and a copper reducer. The gases were then separated by  a packed GC column (Costech P/N 0581080) and a water trap.

During the measuring time of ${1000}\,s$ , the millivoltage at the therma l conductivity detector was continuously recorded, with peaks for $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ $C O_{2},$ and $S O_{2}$ at approximately 60, 98, and $770\;{\bf s}_{\mathrm{.}}$ , respectively.  

# Loss on ignition  

After powdering, an aliquot between 2.00 and $5.00\,\pm\,0.05\mathrm{~g~}$ o f the sample powder was weighed on a Mettler Toledo balance an d ignited for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $1025^{\circ}C$ for igneous rocks to determine weight LO I with an estimated precision of $0.02\:\mathrm{g}\left(0.4\%\right)$ .  

In comparing the GC volatile analyses with the LOI results, it i s important to note that $\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ will change to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ (as well as $S^{0}$ and $S^{2-}$ t o oxidized $S^{6+}$ ) during ignition of the sample in ambient atmosphere. This can result in a weight gain of as much as $11.1\%$ of the proportion of ferrous Fe in the sample (e.g., a sample with $10\%\ \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ coul d increase in weight by ${\tt>}1\;{\mathrm{wt}}\%$ ). Also, ignition at or above $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ca n result in the loss of K and Na because these elements have vapo r points below $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ $759^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for K and $883^{\circ}C$ for Na) (Lide, 2000). These two issues can lead to discrepancies between LOI analyse s and volatile concentrations determined by GC analysis.  

# Total organic carbon  

Total organic carbon was calculated by subtracting the weigh t percent of inorganic carbon from TC obtained with the CHNS analyzer. Repeated measurements of pure $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ and BHVO-2 (severa l times at the beginning and end of each run) were used to estimat e accuracy, which was $-5\%$ of the TIC. The BHVO-2 standard wa s chosen for calibration of TIC because of its low TIC concentrations, which are close to those expected during Expedition 376.  

# Calibration, blanks, and standards  

Analytical runs typically began with a blank consisting of a ti n capsule with ${\sim}10~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{V}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}$ and five variably sized aliquots of th e SRM 2704 standard, which contains $3.35\,\mathrm{\,wt\%}$ C and 0.172–0.1 8 $\mathrm{wt}\%\mathrm{\;N}$ . This standard was chosen for calibration of every run for  C and N.  

To assess the effect of a Ba-rich matrix on S recovery and obtai n a good calibration curve for high-sulfur samples, various sulfu r compounds were added to ashed powders to create in-house EA standards that matched the matrix and S content of Brothers volcano samples. These standards were gravimetrically calibrated using a Cahn C-31 microbalance. Pure $\mathrm{MgSO_{4}}$ and $\mathrm{AgS_{2}}$ compound s were mixed with ashed rock powder (Sample 376-U1527A-5R-1, $13{-}15~\mathrm{cm})$ ) to get a $2.5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ concentration of TS. Pure $\mathrm{{BaSO}_{4}}$ an d native sulfur were also added to ashed rock powders in proportio n to create 8, 4, and $2\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ and 10, 5, and $2.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ S standards, respectively. These in-house standards were run for EA measurement s prior to every run as a quality control of the measurement and fo r data analysis. The calibration curve for the CHNS analyzer from inhouse standards is shown in Figure F24. In contrast to in-hous e standards with $\mathrm{MgSO_{4},A g S_{2},}$ and native sulfur, $\mathrm{{BaSO}_{4}}$ standards reported lower reproducibility for those with higher $\mathrm{BaSO_{4}}$ concentrations (i.e., $>\!2.5\,\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ ).  

# ICP-AES  

The standard shipboard procedure for digestion of rocks an d subsequent ICP-AES analysis is described in Murray et al. (2000 ) and the shipboard user guide for ICP-AES, with modifications as indicated in the Expedition 369 methods chapter (Huber et al., 2019). The following protocol is a synopsis of this procedure with mino r changes and additions.  

Digestion procedure  

Each sample and standard was weighed on a Cahn C-31 microbalance to $100.0\pm0.5\;\mathrm{mg};$ ; weighing errors are estimated to be $\pm0.2$ mg under relatively smooth sea-surface conditions. Aliquots of ignited whole-rock powders were mixed with $400.0\pm0.5\:\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ flux (preweighed on shore). Aqueous LiBr solution ( $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of 0.17 2 mmol/L) was added to the flux and rock powder mixture as a nonwetting agent prior to sample fusion to prevent the fused bead fro m sticking to the crucible during cooling. Samples were fused individually in Pt-Au (95:5) crucibles for ${\sim}12$ min at a maximum temperature of $1050^{\circ}C$ in an internally rotating induction furnace (Bea d Sampler NT-2100).  

The beads were then transferred into $50~\mathrm{mL}$ HDPE bottles an d dissolved in a $50~\mathrm{mL}$ solution containing $10~\mathrm{wt\%}$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ (prepare d from Optima-grade concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3})$ ). The solution bottle wa s placed in a Burrell wrist-action shaker for 1 to $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $7^{\circ}C$ to aid dissolution, and then $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ was pipetted into a polyethylene centrifuge tube and diluted with $4.4~\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\;\mathrm{wt\%\HNO_{3}}$ and $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ o f internal standard solution containing Be, In $(100\,\upmu\mathrm{g}/\upmathrm{g})$ , and Sb (20 0 $\upmu\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{g})$ . The final solution-to-sample dilution factor was $4000\times$ ; thi s solution was analyzed for both major and trace elements.  

A different digestion procedure was used for trace element analysis of chalcophile elements (e.g., As, Se, Sb, Cd, and Pb), which ar e prone to significant contamination (e.g., Pb) or are potentially volatile during fusion (e.g., Cd and Se). About $100~\mathrm{mg}$ of rock powde r was digested in an acid-clean low thermal expansion borosilicat e glass beaker on a hot plate $(120^{\circ}{-}150^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ with concentrated trace metal–grade $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . Because this procedure dissolves sulfide minerals but only partly dissolves clay minerals and other silicates, trac e metals and metalloids analyzed with this procedure are referred t o as acid-soluble elements.  

To determine the abundance of $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ -soluble S relative to total  S in rocks from Holes U1528A, U1528C, and U1528D, a portion o f the powdered rock prepared for ICP-AES analysis was leached wit h nanopure water, and $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ -soluble components were analyzed vi a ICP-AES. First, a $250\;\mathrm{mg}$ portion of the sample was weighed into a n acid-cleaned $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ polyethylene centrifuge tube, and $15~\mathrm{mL}$ of nanopure water $(18.2\,\mathrm{M}\Omega)$ was added. The samples were agitated an d placed in a shaker for $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ at $7^{\circ}C$ . Samples were then centrifuged, and the supernatant liquid was filtered. Aliquots were acidified to  1 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ with $\mathrm{HNO}_{3},$ , and the concentrations of Ca, S, and Sr were determined via ICP-AES. Abundances of $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ -soluble Ca, S, and Sr wer e then determined for the bulk rock and taken to represent specie s derived from anhydrite. The difference between each species (e.g., total S from elemental analysis and anhydrite-derived S) was calculated and taken to represent the $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}.$ -insoluble fraction of that element in the rock.

# Analysis  

Major and trace element concentrations of standards and samples were determined using an Agilent 5110 ICP-OES instrument i n AES mode. The analyzed elements and the wavelengths used fo r sample analysis are provided in Table T16. Certified internationa l rock reference materials, calibration and drift solutions, and chemical procedure blanks were included with the unknown samples fo r each sample run (Table T17). Detection limits were calculated a s three times the standard deviation of the mean for blank solutio n measurements (Table T18).  

The ICP-AES plasma was ignited at least $20\,\mathrm{\min}$ before eac h sample run to allow the instrument to warm up and stabilize. Th e ICP-AES data presented in the rock geochemistry sections for eac h Expedition 376 site were acquired using Agilent’s ICP Expert software. The intensity curve for each element is defined by 20 measurements within the designated wavelength window. The Exper t software integrates the area delineated by the baseline and the intensity curve. Each sample was analyzed three times from the sam e dilute solution in a given sample run. For several elements, measurements were made at two or more wavelengths in axial/radia l mode (Table T16). For each run, the wavelength yielding the bes t calibration line was identified and used to determine concentrations.  

Estimates of accuracy and precision of major and trace elemen t analyses were based on replicate analyses of international standard s (Table T18). During Expedition 376, run-to-run RSD by ICP-AE S was typically $\pm1\%$ for major elements and $\pm5\%$ to $10\%$ for trace elements. A drift-correction sample (basalt BHVO-2) and procedural blank solutions were analyzed in every fifth sample position and a t the beginning and end of each run. Procedural blank solutions wer e run near the beginning and end of each run. As many as $60\,\mathrm{\,un\cdot}$ - known samples were analyzed during a single run. A $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ wash solution was run for 90 s between each sample analysis. Chec k standards were used to test analytical accuracy and the reproducibility of the final data, and blank measurements were used to determine detection limits.  

# Data reduction  

All analyses were corrected first for drift. A drift correction wa s applied to each element based on linear interpolation between driftmonitoring solutions run every fourth analysis. After drift correction and subtraction of the procedural blank, a calibration line fo r each element was calculated using the results for the certified roc k standards. Concentrations used for the calibrations were compile d values from the literature; they were recalculated on a volatile-fre e basis for those samples having LOI values $>\!2\%$ . Total Fe oxide concentrations were reported as $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}t}$ . The compiled values wer e from Govindaraju (1994) and the GeoRem website (http://georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de) (Jochum et al., 2005) (Table T17). Element concentrations in the samples were then calculated from th e relevant calibration lines (Table T16).  

A set of eight certified rock standards, analyzed at least twic e per run, were chosen for their wide range in composition to calibrate the analyses (Table T17): basalts BIR-1, BHVO-2, and BCR2; gabbro MRG-1; andesites JA-1 and AGV-1; and rhyolites JR- 1 and RGM-1 for igneous rocks and SRM 2704 and SO-1 for sediments. Results are presented in Table T18. Acid-soluble trace elements (As, Se, Sb, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed using a set o f synthetic standards prepared from mono-elemental standar d solutions.

# Portable X-ray fluorescence measurements  

A pXRF instrument (Olympus Delta) was available for rapid, i n situ chemical analysis of solid rock samples (such as surfaces of archive-half sections and TSB) and aliquots of fresh rock powder s prepared for XRD and/or ICP-AES analysis. The pXRF has bee n demonstrated on previous expeditions to be a valuable tool for initial assessments of the composition of igneous rock and hydrothermal  alteration  products,  for  determining  unit  boundaries  i n conjunction with petrographic observations, and for refining sample selection for postcruise research (IODP Expeditions 352 [Rya n et al., 2017]; 366 [Johnston et al., 2018]; and 367/368 [Jian et al., 2018]).  

Analytical protocol  

Instrument setup includes two modes (“geochem” and “soils” ) that have different scanning parameters for preferentially analyzin g some elements over others as they apply different correction protocols depending on sample type and geometry. We applied the geochem mode, which uses two sequential beams of different energy t o determine a wide range of elements. The Olympus Delta pXRF instrument cannot determine elements lighter than $\mathrm{Mg}$ (atomi c weight $=\sim\!24$ ) and does not perform well with the relatively ligh t elements Mg, Al (atomic weight $=\sim\!27$ ), and Si (atomic weight $=$ ${\sim}28\$ ).  

For quantitative analysis, it is important to mount the sampl e with its surface parallel to and in direct contact with the measurement window of the instrument analyzer so that atmospheric absorption effects and losses related to variations in the geometr y between sample and analyzer are minimized. Two different holder s were used depending on the type of sample. Long archive-half section pieces $({>}5\;\mathrm{cm})$ were analyzed directly in the core liner using  a specially made holder with leaded shielding that holds the pXRF instrument vertically downward and resting in direct contact with th e flat core section surface. To ensure contact with the sample surface, the rock surface was raised by inserting a sheet of cling-wrappe d modeling clay between the rock and liner. For smaller rock piece s $(<\!5\;\mathrm{cm})$ , the pXRF instrument was supported in a stand, pointin g vertically upward, with a special shielded chamber attached to th e front of the instrument. This allowed samples to be placed directl y against the instrument’s measurement window. Calibration an d rock powders were measured in the same stand after mounting o n plastic powder mount assemblies provided with the instrument.  A short length of thin, transparent film for X-ray fluorescence applications (Ultralene or an equivalent product) was stretched across on e end of the mount base, covered with $_{1-2\,\mathrm{g}}$ of rock powder, and hel d in place with a plastic ring cap, producing a smooth, transparen t surface that was placed against the measurement window of the instrument. Plastic foam spacers (similar to those used to fill gaps lef t by sampling working halves) were cut to size to hold the sample i n place in the holder during measurements.  

Each measurement took $120\,{\ s}$ (60 s for each beam), and typicall y three measurements were made on each sample point and average d for an individual analysis following the protocol of Ryan et al. (2017). The pXRF instrument is internally calibrated on a daily basis, which ensures comparable raw data output in element parts pe r million (ppm) for all elements measured. However, although internal calibration ensures instrument stability, the accuracy of the dat a is far less stringent than is common in geosciences. Therefore, t o ensure sufficient accuracy and comparability with published data, the raw output should be recalibrated whenever possible (e.g., Johnston et al., 2018).  

Secondary calibrations were made on powders of standard materials for Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, K, P, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, and Pb using powder mounts of seven international standar d reference materials (BIR-1, JB-2, BHVO-2, BCR-2, JA-2, JA-1, an d AGV-1). The accepted values for these standards were compiled fo r shipboard analyses by JRSO staff (Table T19). All data were processed in Microsoft Excel.  

The parameters of the calibration curves for 19 elements ar e given in Table T20. The quality of the calibration curves varies. Th e correlation coefficients $(R^{2}>0.99)$ are best for Ti, Fe, Ca, K, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Zr, and $\mathrm{Pb}$ . A second group with elements Mn, Mg, P, and Y have correlation coefficients of $R^{2}\,>\,0.97$ . The correlatio n curves are poor for Si, Nb, and Cr. The latter was below the detection limits in almost all samples and is not further considered. Despite low correlation coefficients, the Si $\left[R^{2}\,=\,0.89\right)$ and Nb ( $\left[R^{2}\right.=\left.\right]$ 0.67) calibration curves are stable, producing repeatable and withinlimits reasonable abundance data. Therefore, the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Nb}$ dat a were collected. No linear correlation curve could be obtained for Al, presumably due to the influence of matrix effects, so the $\mathrm{{Al}_{2}O_{3}}$ dat a were disregarded. The addition of rhyolite standards JR-1 an d RGM-1 to the calibration line improved the calibration parameters. However, the accuracy of the data deteriorated, in particular fo r $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$ . Therefore, the poorer yet stable calibration curves were accepted.

As recommended by Johnston et al. (2018), the calibration lin e was established in the first weeks of the expedition and then continuously monitored. A basalt and a dacite powder of reference materials (BHVO-2 and JA-1; the latter chosen for its resemblance t o typical Brothers volcanic rocks) were analyzed during each run t o monitor data quality and instrument performance. In addition,  a fresh dacite powder (Sample 376-U1527A-6R-1, $25{-}27\ \mathrm{cm}$ ) was rerun to monitor instrument stability (Tables T21, T22, T23). Reproducibility (expressed as a percent of 1 RSD) over the course of th e expedition was $1\%{-2\%}$ RSD for most of the calibrated major elements, with the exception of $\mathrm{MgO}$ $\lvert7\%-12\%$ RSD) and $\mathrm{P_{2}O_{5}}\,(3\%{-}8\%$ RSD). For calibrated trace elements, reproducibility was betwee n $1\%$ and $3\%$ , except for $\mathrm{Pb}$ ( $12\%$ RSD at 4 ppm).

S, Co, Hg, V, As, Se, Bi, Th, U, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, W, and LRE E (sum of light rare earth elements, as per manufacturer) were not recalibrated either because no reference concentration and/or standards were available or because calibration curves were very poor. Because several of these elements (e.g., S, Hg, As, Se, and U) were o f particular interest for Expedition 376, the raw data were observe d by first-order means of monitoring. Sulfur is measurable, as show n by a test on sulfur-bearing standard JGB-1 (gabbro; $\mathrm{S}=1950\:\mathrm{ppm})$ ); a good overall correlation with sulfur data obtained by ICP-AES o n aliquot powders $(y=0.76\times+0.61$ ; $R^{2}=0.94_{\mathrm{.}}$ ) suggests that pXRF i s capable of monitoring and/or measuring sulfur abundances in sulfur-rich rock powders with some degree of accuracy. The other uncalibrated elements (e.g., Hg, As, Se, B, and U) produced signals o n some of the Expedition 376 core material (e.g., upper Hole U1530A ) that were clearly above background. These cases were noted and referred to ICP-AES work for further assessment.

# Rock-surface analysis  

Previous studies showed that calibrations made on rock powders are usable for measurements on solid core material (e.g., Rya n et al., 2017). However, the rocks recovered during Expedition 37 6 were not amenable to rock-surface analyses. Fresh Expedition 37 6 volcanic rocks were vesicular, and thus some air came into contac t with the analyzer window during analysis, resulting in generall y lower abundance levels. This effect is most noticeable in the mos t abundant major elements (e.g., $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ). In contrast, abundances of elements with lower abundances in the Brothers volcano rocks coul d be approximated reasonably well. It was possible to obtain indirec t information on the $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$ concentration of the lavas by using the observed linear correlations of $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$ with CaO, $\mathrm{Fe_{2}O_{3}}$ Y, and so o n from previously published Kermadec arc and Brothers volcan o magmas (see  GeoROC  database  at  http://georoc.mpchmainz.gwdg.de/georoc) (Figure F25). For example, CaO of $4.21\pm$ $0.03~\mathrm{\Deltawt\%}$ was determined for a powder of rock Sample 376- U1527A-6R-1, $25{-}27~\mathrm{cm}$ . Based on published data, this suggests  a bulk rock $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ of ${\sim}66~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . The pXRF measurement of the least vesicular hard rock gave a lower $C\mathsf{a O}$ of ${\sim}3.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ , which is still sufficiently close (in conjunction with other elements) to confirm th e dacitic composition of the host rock.  

Similar problems were encountered when analyzing the roc k surfaces of hydrothermally altered rocks (predominant Expeditio n 376 rock lithology), which are often finely porous. The resultan t major element abundances were too low, with no means to reestablish them indirectly. In addition, rock-surface analyses also produced ghost signals for elements (e.g., for sulfur) that were belo w detection limit when measured in an aliquot rock powder. Therefore, during Expedition 376, pXRF rock-surface measurement s were used mainly for fast assessment purposes but were generall y discontinued in favor of pXRF measurements of rock powders.  

# Rock powder analysis  

pXRF data on rock powders were obtained for all five Expedition 376 Sites (U1527–U1531) from splits of powders obtained fo r XRD and/or ICP-AES analyses. Many samples measured by pXR F were also selected for onboard ICP-AES analyses, allowing for direct comparison of the data for Si, Ti, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, K, P, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, and Zr. As noted previously, the data obtained compar e generally well (e.g., Johnston et al., 2018) and are best for Fe, K, Sr, Y, Cu, and Zn. The others compare less favorably for one or more possible following causes:

• Matrix effects: pXRF data are obtained from undiluted rock material, whereas ICP-AES samples are diluted by a factor of 4000. Consequently, pXRF analyses are much more likely to be subjected to matrix effects. • pXRF instrument background: The pXRF calibration lines for some elements (e.g., Mg, Ca, and Cr) do not intercept at or near  

the origin, suggesting background signals influence the analyses.   
This leads to deviations at low abundance levels.  

Despite these shortcomings, the calibrated pXRF abundance s were still a useful, rapid first-order assessment of rock composition s during the expedition and a helpful aid for postcruise research.

Shipboard paleomagnetic experiments were carried out durin g Expedition 376 on fresh and altered cores recovered from Site s U1527, U1528, U1530, and U1531. Nonmagnetic core barrels wer e used throughout Expedition 376 to reduce the severity of drillinginduced overprint (Tamura et al., 2015; Lund et al., 2003). Natura l remanent magnetization (NRM) was measured on archive halve s and discrete cube samples from working halves. NRM was als o measured before and after alternating field (AF) stepwise demagnetization for all archive halves to remove any overprinting magnetization and to isolate the primary magnetization. Discrete sample s were extracted from working halves and subjected to anisotropy o f magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements and more detailed A F stepwise demagnetization or thermal demagnetization (TD) to further constrain primary magnetic minerals. Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) experiments were also carried out after th e demagnetization experiments. The magnetic directions are relativ e to the sample core coordinate system (Figures F26, F27) becaus e the azimuthal orientations of the core are not determined. Th e Brothers volcano drill sites are located at a latitude of ${\sim}34^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ . At thi s latitude, the geomagnetic axial dipole is characterized by an inclination of approximately $-55^{\circ}$ , which makes it possible to identif y magnetostratigraphic chrons (Cande and Kent, 1995) using inclination data alone. Moreover, the location of these drill sites in th e southern hemisphere results in positive inclinations to indicate reversed polarities.  

# Archive-half sections  

Because of low recovery from the volcanic rock cores, the largest oriented archive-half pieces were measured to obtain maximu m magnetic information. Measurements of NRM and stepwise AF demagnetization on archive halves were performed using a heliumfree superconducting cryogenic rock magnetometer (SRM; 2 G model 760R-4K) with an integrated, in-line AF demagnetizer wit h peak fields as high as $80\;\mathrm{mT}.$ The magnetometer is controlled by  a customized version of Labview software IMS-SRM v. 9.2 (see th e Expedition 371 SRM User Guide). For each of the SQUID sensors, the response curve has a width of approximately $8\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ , which mean s

that data collected within ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{cm}$ of gaps or section boundaries ar e significantly affected by edge effects and do not provide meaningful results (Reagan et al., 2015). For this reason, the irregular shape o f some of the rock pieces measured with the SRM affected the measured magnetization, and the raw data uploaded to the LIMS database  must  be  used  with  caution.  However,  archive-hal f measurements were very important for optimizing discrete sampling of paleomagnetic cubes and analysis of the working halves. The sample tray of the SRM was demagnetized every day using a n AF of $30~\mathrm{mT}$ to minimize noise effects, with tray magnetic background values then subtracted from the core measurements. Cor e sections were measured at a spacing of $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ and were subject t o stepwise AF demagnetization up to a peak field of $70\;\mathrm{mT}$ to remov e magnetic overprints resulting from the acquisition of viscous remanent magnetization derived from drilling, coring, and sampl e preparation (Richter et al., 2007). AF demagnetization experimen t results for archive halves were plotted using PuffinPlot v. 1.0.3 (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012).  

# Physical properties  

Shipboard measurements of physical properties were undertaken to provide a quantitative characterization of recovered cor e material. These data are used to link the geological observation s made on the core to the results of downhole measurements and regional geophysical surveys.  

# Discrete samples  

# Laboratory core flow  

Discrete samples from working halves were cut into $8~\,\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ cubes. These same samples were then shared with the physica l property group for additional analyses (see Physical properties). We used the Agico Kappa Bridge (model KLY 4) to measure th e AMS of discrete samples. Mean MS, degree of anisotropy, degree o f magnetic lineation, and foliation were measured and plotted usin g Agico’s Anisoft $_{\textrm{v}}5.0$ software. After these measurements, NRM o f discrete samples was measured using the Agico JR-6A spinne r magnetometer (sensitivity $={\sim}20\times10^{-6}\ \mathrm{A/m})$ . Stepwise AF demagnetization of some discrete samples was achieved using a DTech D2000 AF demagnetizer at $10~\mathrm{mT}$ intervals up to $100~\mathrm{{mT}}$ In som e cases, demagnetization increments and maximum AF intensitie s were adjusted in real time to analyze the coercivity of each sample i n detail; the AF experiments were completed when a primary magnetization direction could be clearly identified or after a significant decrease of the NRM intensity. Some discrete samples were thermall y demagnetized using ASC Scientific’s model TD-48SC thermal demagnetizer to temperatures $>\!600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The internal field inside th e demagnetizer tube is less than $50\,\mathrm{~mT},$ and samples were widel y spaced inside the sample boat to reduce interaction with each other. The samples were then held at a specified temperature (see below ) for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ , cooled, and then measured with the Agico JR-6A spinner magnetometer. The general temperature increments wer e ${\sim}50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for temperatures ${>}200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and smaller intervals of $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ around $575\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ (i.e., the Curie temperature of pure magnetite), although in some specific cases temperature increments and range s were adjusted in real time to optimize measurements of the specifi c blocking temperature of each sample by looking at preliminary demagnetization plots. Similar to AF experiments, in some cases th e thermal experiments were completed when a primary magnetization direction was clearly identified or after a significant decrease i n NRM intensity. To facilitate sample sharing, some thermal experiments were conducted on physical property samples already subjected  to  MAD  measurements,  in  which  samples  are  wate r saturated and then dried at $105\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ for $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ in a magnetically nois y environment, acquiring a laboratory-induced magnetic overprint. For these samples, we measured NRM at room temperature befor e the MAD experiments and then with TD at $110^{\circ}C$ after the MA D experiment before continuing with additional TD steps. Result s from demagnetization experiments for the discrete samples wer e plotted using Remasoft 3.1 software provided by Agico, and primary magnetization directions were calculated by principal component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980) in vector component diagram s (Zijderveld, 1967) using PuffinPlot v. 1.0.3 (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012). Following the demagnetization experiments, IRM experiments were carried out to measure sample coercivity. Impulse field s were imparted at variable steps in the range of $0{-}1.2\ \mathrm{T}$ along th e sample positive $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axis using the ASC Scientific impulse magnetize r (model IM-10) and subsequently measuring the corresponding IR M with the JR-6A spinner magnetometer at each step.  

Cores were measured in the following sequence (work flow):  

1. Core temperatures were measured using the forward-looking infrared (FLIR) thermal imaging camera as soon as they were brought in from the core-receiving deck.   
2. Cores were left to equilibrate to ambient room temperature $\scriptstyle(\sim30-60\;\mathrm{min})$ ).   
3. Whole-round $360^{\circ}$ image scanning was conducted.   
4. Representative pieces of the whole-round core were used for $P$ - wave measurements in the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ - and $y$ -directions using the $P$ -wave Gantry system.   
5. Whole-round cores were run on the WRMSL, which includes a GRA bulk densitometer, a magnetic susceptibility pass-through loop (MSL) system, and a PWL. The default sampling interval was set to $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ . For hard rock cores that did not fill the core liner, the PWL was turned off.   
6. Whole-round cores were also run on the NGRL when the length of an individual section was $>\!50\;\mathrm{cm}$ .   
7. Cores were split, after which both the archive and working halves of the core were imaged.   
8. The archive half of the core was run on the SHMSL for MSP and RSC.   
9. Representative samples $\scriptstyle\geq6\;\mathrm{cm}$ long were taken from the working half and saturated in seawater prior to thermal conductivity measurements.   
10. $P$ -wave velocity measurements were made along the working half in its core liner using the $P$ -wave gantry system. Porous hard rock samples may require saturation for a clear signal; seawatersaturated thermal conductivity samples were used in this case.   
11. Discrete samples for shipboard measurements were collected from each section of the working half. Oriented cube samples (8 $\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ ) were shared between paleomagnetic, MAD, and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity anisotropy measurements.   
12. Additional MAD measurements were also made on nonoriented rough pieces and sediment samples.   
13. Sediment samples were collected in the splitting room to preserve the original moisture content of saturated samples.   
14. Paleomagnetic measurements of discrete cubes were made first using either AF demagnetization or TD. For TD samples, only a room temperature measurement of NRM was made at this point.   
15. Cubes and rough pieces were saturated in seawater under vacuum conditions for ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{h}$ at ambient temperature to remove air from any pore spaces.   
16. The wet mass of samples was obtained for MAD measurements.   
17. $P$ -wave velocity was measured on wet cube samples in the $x_{\mathrm{~}},y_{\mathrm{~}}$ -, and $z$ -directions.   
18. Samples were dried in a $105^{\circ}C$ oven for $22{-}24\,\mathrm{h}$ and then cooled to room temperature in a desiccator for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ , after which their dry mass was obtained for MAD measurements.   
19. Sample volume was obtained using Helium pycnometry. Bulk density, dry density, grain density, and porosity were then calculated from wet mass, dry mass, and dry volume measurements using IODP Method C (Blum, 1997).   
20. Discrete cubes used for TD were then returned to the Paleomag  

netism group.  

During Expedition 376, all raw data were uploaded to the LIM S database. A comprehensive discussion of all methodologies and calculations used aboard the JOIDES Resolution in the physical property laboratory is found in Blum (1997).  

# Core temperature measurement  

Core temperature was initially measured as soon as the core s were brought to the core-receiving deck using the FLIR E8 therma l imaging camera. The FLIR analyzes the $7.5{-}13~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ spectral rang e using an infrared lens to obtain temperature readings. FLIR data ca n be either read off the instrument directly or downloaded by connecting to a computer installed with the FLIR Tools software an d exported as a PDF file. FLIR measurement locations were selecte d based on noticeable lithologic variations. The same locations wer e remeasured prior to WRMSL analyses to confirm that cores ha d equilibrated to room temperature. Arrival temperatures of core s were monitored because of the likelihood of drilling hot formations; however, all cores were found to have equilibrated with surface se a temperatures during core barrel retrieval. From Site U1530 onward, arrival temperatures were no longer obtained.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

The WRMSL was used to measure GRA bulk density, MS (o n the MSL), and $P$ -wave velocity (on the PWL) of cores nondestructively. The default sampling interval was set at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . For hard roc k cores that did not fill the core liner, the PWL was turned off. Calibration was verified after each core measurement by running  a freshwater-filled calibration core through the WRMSL. Calibrations were accepted if they were within $2\%$ of the standard values fo r each measurement type.  

# GRA bulk density  

The bulk density of sediments and rocks can be estimated fro m GRA. These data indicate changes in lithology and porosity and ar e particularly useful for core-to-core correlation. The GRA densitometer on the WRMSL operates by passing gamma rays from a $^{137}\!C s$ source through a whole-round core and into a $75\;\mathrm{mm}^{3}$ NaI detecto r located directly below the core. The input gamma ray peak has  a principal energy of $0.662\;\mathrm{MeV}$ and is attenuated by Compton scattering as it passes through the core. The attenuation is a function o f the electron density, which is related to the bulk density by  

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{b}}=\rho_{\mathrm{e}}\mathbf{w}/2\Sigma\mathrm{N},
$$  

where  

$\mathsf{\rho}_{\mathsf{P b}}=$ bulk density,   
$\uprho_{\mathrm{e}}=$ electron density,   
$\mathbf{w}=$ molecular weight, and   
$\Nu=$ atomic number of elements in the material  

For the majority of elements and for anhydrous rock-formin g minerals, attenuation is ${\sim}1$ , whereas for hydrogen it is 1.9841. For  a known sample thickness (i.e., the core diameter), the gamma ra y count is therefore proportional to the bulk density. The quality o f GRA data is significantly affected by voids or incomplete filling o f the core liner. In such cases, the density estimate will be too low. Fo r cores in this category, the highest density values are therefore th e most reliable. However, it is possible to correct the data from core s with variable thickness using a thickness log obtained from cor e photographs according to  

$$
\rho_{1}=\rho\times d/d_{1},
$$  

where  

$\uprho=$ output density,   
$d=$ assumed thickness (core diameter), $\mathsf{\rho}_{\mathsf{P1}}=$ actual density, and   
$d_{1}=$ actual thickness.  

Acquisition time for each measurement is $3\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ . Calibration of th e GRA densitometer was performed using a core liner filled wit h freshwater and aluminum density standards. Recalibration was performed if the measured density of the freshwater standard was no t $1.00\pm0.02~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Bulk density was also acquired for discrete samples during MAD measurements (see below).  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

MS is a volume-specific measure of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magnetic field:  

$$
\kappa=M/H\left(\mathrm{SI}\right),
$$  

where $\kappa$ is MS and $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field with strength $H$ (using a very low field strengt h of ${\le}0.5~\mathrm{mT}$ ).  

The MS of rocks varies in response to the magnetic properties o f their constituents, making it a useful indicator of mineralogical variations. MS measurements are also an important method fo r making core-to-core and downhole measurement correlations. Materials such as clay generally have an MS several orders of magnitude lower than iron oxides, such as magnetite, that are commo n components of igneous rocks. Water and plastics (such as the cor e liner) have a low MS of slightly negative value.  

The WRMSL measures volume MS using a Bartington Instruments MS2 meter coupled to a MS2C sensor coil ( $88\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter ) and operates at an AF of $250\,\upmu\mathrm{T}$ and a frequency of $0.565\;\mathrm{kHz}$ (Bartington Instruments, Ltd., 2019). MS is reported in instrumen t units. To convert results into dimensionless SI units, it is necessar y to multiply the data by a correction factor that is a function of th e probe type, core diameter, and loop size. The size of small roc k pieces in incomplete cores varies, so application of a single correction factor is not justified and therefore no correction is applied t o the WRMSL data. This conversion factor does not change the orde r of magnitude of the measured susceptibility values, so the result s are comparable with the susceptibility measured by the paleomagnetic group with the same physical units (SI).  

Results are the average of three measurements made at each interval. The along-core response curve of the MSC2 coil has a full widt h at half maximum of ${\sim}4~\mathrm{cm}$ (Blum, 1997). Measurements on cor e pieces $<\!8\;\mathrm{cm}$ long will thus significantly underestimate MS by $>\!10\%$ . MS data recorded on the WRMSL must therefore be interpreted wit h reference to breaks and variable diameters of fragmented cores; thi s information can be obtained from the $360^{\circ}$ photo imaging record. Note that higher spatial resolution MSP data are also collected on section halves by the SHMSL (see below), and bulk MS data are collecte d for discrete cubes during AMS analyses (see Paleomagnetism).  

# $\pmb{P}$ -wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity is the distance traveled by a compressional $P$ - wave through a medium per unit of time, expressed in meters pe r second $(\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s})$ . $P$ -wave velocity is dependent on the composition, porosity, bulk density, fabric, and temperature of the material, whic h in turn are functions of consolidation and lithification, state o f stress, and fracturing. Along with bulk density data, $P.$ -wave velocit y data can be used to calculate acoustic impedances and reflection coefficients that are needed to estimate the depth of specific seismi c horizons.  

The PWL system on the WRMSL transmits a $500~\mathrm{kHz}~P$ -wav e pulse across the core liner at a repetition rate of $1\,\mathrm{kHz}$ . Pulser an d receiver are mounted on a caliper-type device and are aligned to ensure that wave propagation is perpendicular to the section’s lon g axis. A linear variable differential transducer measures the $P.$ -wav e travel distance between the pulse source and the receiver. Goo d coupling between transducers and the core liner is facilitated by water dripping onto the contact from a peristaltic water pump system. Signal processing software picks the first arrival of the wave at th e receiver, and the processing routine also corrects for the thicknes s of the liner.  

A series of acrylic cylinders of varying thicknesses are used t o calibrate the PWL system. The regression of traveltime versus trave l distance yields the $P$ -wave velocity of the standard material, whic h should be $2750\pm20\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . The thickness of the calibration samples, corrected for liner thickness, is divided by the traveltime to calculate $P$ -wave velocity in meters per second. The calibration is confirmed by measuring a core liner filled with pure water, and th e calibration passes if the measured velocity is within $\pm\;20\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ of th e expected value for water at room temperature (i.e., $1485\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ).  

# Natural gamma radiation measurements  

NGR is emitted from rocks as a result of the radioactive decay o f $^{238}\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ isotopes. Measurement of NGR from the recovered whole-round cores provides an indication of these elemen t concentrations and can provide insight into many important lithologic characteristics and geologic processes. For example, in har d rocks, NGR measurements can yield information about the alteration and heat production of rocks (Dunlea et al., 2013) that is useful  when  correlating  core  measurements  with  downhol e measurements of NGR (e.g., Révillon et al., 2002). The NGRL installed on the JOIDES Resolution was designed and built at IOD P (Texas A&M University, USA) (Vasiliev et al., 2011). The main NG R detector unit consists of 8 sodium iodide (NaI) scintillator detector s $({\sim}1270~\mathrm{~cm^{3}}$ each), 7 plastic scintillation detectors, 22 photomultipliers, and passive lead shielding. The eight NaI detectors ar e spaced every $20~\mathrm{cm}$ in the detector; the detectors themselves ar e semicylindrical annuli around the lower half of the core (each crystal is ${\sim}13~\mathrm{cm}$ wide along the core). The detectors are shielded b y lead to reduce external gamma radiation measurement, and th e seven plastic scintillation detectors also detect and actively suppres s the effect of high-energy gamma and muon components of cosmi c radiation.  

A single measurement run with the NGRL provides a total of 16 measurements at $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals over a $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ section of core. T o achieve a $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ interval using the NGRL’s eight sensors spaced every $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ , the NGRL records two sets of measurements offset by 1 0 cm. Total counts are routinely summed over the range of 100–300 0 keV and depend on the concentration of radionuclides in the sampl e and the counting time, with longer counting times providing bette r counting statistics. The default measurement time was set to $5\,\mathrm{{min}}$ .  

However, occasional additional measurements with counting time s of $18\,\mathrm{h}$ were conducted to qualitatively identify relative abundance s of different radioactive isotopes from relative peak heights in collected spectra.  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

The SHMSL includes a platform moving above the section hal f that records the sample height using a laser sensor. The laser profil e establishes the location of the bottom of the core section and th e distribution of rock to measure by locating gaps and cracks betwee n pieces based on a laser distance exceeding a set value. After identifying the section length, the SHMSL then measures reflectanc e spectrophotometry and colorimetry and MSP at regular interval s along the section. Measurements were made at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals alon g the core.  

# Reflectance spectrophotometry and colorimetry  

An Ocean Optics, Inc., system for UV through visible to nearinfrared light $(171{-}1100~\mathrm{~nm}$ wavelength at $2\,\textrm{n m}$ increments ) mounted on the SHMSL was used to measure spectral reflectance. Each full-band measurement takes ${\sim}5\;s$ to acquire. Spectral data ar e routinely reduced to the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{b}^{\ast}$ (CIELAB) color space for outpu t and presentation, in which $L^{\ast}$ is luminescence, $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ is the red–gree n value, and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is the blue–yellow value. The color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra: pure white (reference) and pur e black (dark).  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

MSP is measured on the SHMSL using a Bartington MS2E contact probe with a flat $15~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter sensor operating at a frequency  of $0.580~\mathrm{\kHz}$ .  The  sensor  takes  and  averages  thre e measurements made at 1 s intervals to an accuracy of $5\%$ . The are a of response of the MS2E sensor is $3.8\ \mathrm{mm}\times10.5\ \mathrm{mm}_{:}$ , with a dept h response of $50\%$ at $1~\mathrm{mm}$ and $10\%$ at $3.5\ \mathrm{mm}$ (Bartington Instruments, Ltd., 2011). The MSP measured on the SHMSL on sectio n halves therefore has a higher spatial resolution than MS measure d by WRMSL on whole-round cores. The probe is zeroed in air befor e each measurement point, and a background magnetic field is measured and removed from the data. Measurements are output in instrument units but reported in SI (see Magnetic susceptibility).  

# Thermal conductivity  

Thermal conductivity $(k)$ is the coefficient of proportionality relating conductive heat flow to a thermal gradient. It reflects the rat e at which heat is conducted through a material and is dependent o n saturating fluid types, porosity, bulk density, water content, temperature, composition and texture of the mineral phases, and so on. At steady state, thermal conductivity is the coefficient of heat transfer $(q)$ across a steady-state temperature difference $(\Delta T)$ over a distance $(\Delta x)$ :  

$$
q=k(\Delta T/\Delta x).
$$  

Thermal conductivity was measured on pieces from the workin g half (samples ${\geq}6~\mathrm{{cm}]}$ ) under ambient conditions using the TeK a TK04 system described in Blum (1997). Because almost all of th e cores recovered were hard rock, half-space determinations of thermal conductivity were made using standard half-space (HLQ) needle probe pucks (numbers H11040 and H11038) and mini HL Q needle probe pucks (numbers H51037 and H51018). These pucks, which are recommended for planar surfaces, consist of a Plexigla s block $(k=0.184\;\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{K}])$ with a half-space needle probe embedded in its base. Heat is assumed to be transferred through the sample, and the TK04 documentation indicates that heat flow throug h the Plexiglas block itself is only significant for samples with therma l conductivities $<\!1\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ . On one occasion (Hole U1528C) whe n unconsolidated soft material was recovered, a full-space (VLQ ) standard needle probe (number V11064) was used, and the needl e was inserted into the whole-round core perpendicular to the lon g axis. All measurements were made at room temperature and pressure, and they were not corrected for in situ conditions. This syste m measures thermal conductivity by transient heating of the sampl e with a known heating power and geometry. Changes in temperatur e with time during heating are recorded and used to calculate therma l conductivity. Heating power can be adjusted for each sample depending on the type of HLQ puck being used; heating power can b e varied from 1 to $1.6~\mathrm{W/m}$ for a standard puck and from 0.5 to 1. 2 $\mathrm{W/m}$ for a mini puck. For most samples, a heating power of 1. 2 $\mathrm{W/m}$ for a standard puck and $0.8~\mathrm{W/m}$ for a mini puck was used. For the VLQ needle probe, a heating power of $1.2\;\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{m}$ was used. The temperature of the superconductive needle probe has a quasilinear relationship with the natural logarithm of the time after th e initiation of heating (Blum, 1997). The TeKa TK04 device uses  a special approximation method to calculate conductivity and to assess the fit of the heating curve. This method fits discrete window s to the theoretical function of temperature (T) with time $(t)$ for  a constantly heated line source (Kristiansen, 1982):  

$$
T(t)=\mathrm{A_{1}}+\mathrm{A_{2}}\ln(t)+\mathrm{A_{3}}[\ln(t)/t]+(\mathrm{A_{4}}/t),
$$  

where $\mathrm{A}_{1-4}$ are constants that are calculated by linear regression. $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ $\mathrm{A}_{3},$ and $\mathrm{A}_{4}$ are related to the sample geometry and the materia l properties surrounding the needle probe, and $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ is related to th e heating power and thermal conductivity. Having determined thes e constants (and how well they fit the data), the apparent conductivit y $(k_{\mathrm{a}})$ for the fitted curve is time dependent:  

$$
k_{\mathrm{a}}(t)\,=\,\frac{Q}{4\pi}\left(A_{2}+A_{3}\bigg[1-\frac{\ln(t)}{t}\bigg]-\frac{A_{4}}{t}\right),
$$  

where $Q$ is the input heat flux. The maximum value of $k_{\mathrm{a}}$ and th e time $\left({t_{\operatorname*{max}}}\right)$ at which it occurs on the fitted curve are used to asses s the validity of that time window for calculating the thermal conductivity. The best solutions are those where $t_{\mathrm{max}}$ is greatest, and thes e solutions are selected for use. Data are considered good if $k_{\mathrm{a}}$ has  a maximum value, $t_{\mathrm{max}}$ is large, and the standard deviation of th e least-squares fit is low. For each heating cycle, several output value s can be used to assess the quality of the data, including the natura l logarithm of extreme time, which should be large; the number o f solutions $(N)$ , which should also be large; and the contact value, which assesses contact resistance between the probe and the sampl e and should be small and uniform for repeated measurements.  

The measurement apparatus was evaluated frequently by measuring the thermal conductivity of a certified MACOR cerami c standard $(k\,=\,1.626\,\;\mathrm{W/[m{\cdot}K])}$ . For measurement of the cerami c standard, the half-space standard puck or mini puck was coated i n silicone thermal contact gel and then placed on the standard; if th e measured thermal conductivity was within $2\%$ of the known value, then the puck was used for sample measurements. After the standard and prior to sample measurement, the silicone gel was thoroughly removed from the puck to avoid potential geochemica l contamination of core material.  

Figure F28. Apparatus for hard rock thermal conductivity measurements, Expedition 376. Left: small volume insulated seawater bath used to minimiz e thermal disturbances from air and water currents. Half-space standard puc k placed on seawater-saturated hard rock sample in plastic core liner, secure d by elastic bands and stabilized by metal stand. Seawater covers the interfac e between sample and sensor needle. Right: Additional insulating foam use d to cover apparatus and further minimize thermal disturbances. Lid is the n placed on cooler prior to analysis.  

![](images/2227dfd3d92e501b3e68cce2531e81b1480acad14f9221e0fe9afe7302c17b0d.jpg)  

Prior to analysis, hard rock pieces were left to equilibrate t o room temperature in a seawater vacuum saturator for ${\sim}2{-}12\,\mathrm{h}$ depending on the porosity of the samples, and then the sample piec e and sensor needle were kept equilibrated at room temperature i n seawater $(k=\sim0.6\ \mathrm{W/[m\cdotK]})$ in an isolated bath (Coleman-bran d cooler) for at least 5 min prior to measurement (Figure F28). Seawater was used to improve the needle/sample contact; silicone thermal contact gel was not used when measuring core samples to avoid potential contamination of the core. Isolation of the sample piece an d sensor needle in the cooler eliminated the effect of small but rapi d temperature changes introduced by air currents in the laboratory. To further reduce the effects of air currents, a foam board was use d to cover the sample inside the cooler. The instrument internall y measures temperature drift and does not begin a heating run until sufficient thermal equilibrium is attained. Each reported measurement represents the averaged results of as many as four successiv e heating cycles.  

# Discrete measurements  

# P-wave velocity  

Discrete measurements of $P$ -wave velocity were made using th e $P_{\|}$ -wave gantry system. The PWC records arrivals, and the peak o f the first arrival is identified automatically by the IMS 10 Velocit y software. Typically, the first arrival was then picked following manual adjustment. Both the automatic and manual first arrival pic k and original waveform are saved. System calibration runs with standards were conducted periodically to ensure that system and transducer delay time settings were current.  

# Whole-round measurements  

The $P.$ -wave gantry system software was modified during Expedition 376 to support $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements of oriente d pieces of the whole-round core in the $x\cdot$ - and $y$ -directions. These additional measurements were made to rapidly acquire $P$ -wave velocity data for hard rock lithologies (which cannot be run on th e WRMSL PWL system). These data enabled timely interpretation o f seismic images relative to depths of ongoing drilling. Measurement s were made using the PWC system. To ensure stability of the wholeround piece while lowering the transducer, the sample was placed i n a piece of half liner to prevent it from rolling. A hole was cut in th e base of this liner to accommodate contact between the botto m transducer and the sample. When saving the measurement to th e LIMS database, the sample offset from the top of the core was inpu t manually.  

# Discrete cube measurements  

$P$ -wave velocity measurements in the $x-,\;y-$ -, and $z$ -direction s were performed on the same $8\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ discrete cube samples that wer e used for MAD and paleomagnetic determinations. The cubes wer e oriented following standard IODP conventions and placed on th e PWC gantry.  

Anisotropy of $P.$ -wave velocity  

$P$ -wave anisotropy was calculated for whole-round core and discrete cube samples based on the method used during IODP Expedition 352 (Reagan et al., 2015). Anisotropy between the averag e horizontal and vertical velocities $(\mathrm{Anis}_{(\mathrm{xy})\mathrm{z}})$ for discrete cubes) an d horizontal anisotropy $(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{n}\mathbf{i}s_{\mathrm{xy}})$ calculated for both whole-round cor e pieces and discrete cubes) were calculated according to  

$$
\mathrm{Anis}_{(\mathrm{xy)z}}\,(\%)=100\times[\mathrm{mean}(V_{x},\,V_{y})-V_{z}]/\mathrm{mean}(V_{x},\,V_{y},\,V_{z}),
$$  

and  

$$
{\mathrm{Anis}}_{\mathrm{xy}}\,(\%)=100\times(V_{\mathrm{x}}-V_{\mathrm{y}})/{\mathrm{mean}}(V_{\mathrm{x}},\,V_{\mathrm{y}}),
$$  

where  

$x,y$ , and $z=$ standard core coordinate axes; $V_{\mathrm{{x}}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{y}}=$ transverse core velocities; and $V_{\mathrm{z}}=$ longitudinal core velocity.  

Section half measurements  

$P$ -wave velocity was also measured at regular intervals on section halves resting in their plastic core liners using the PWC an d calculated by applying a correction in the IMS 10 Velocity softwar e to account for the thickness of the core liner. For hard rock cores, for which WRMSL measurements generally do not use the PW L system, these measurements offer the potential to obtain $P$ -wave velocity data along the section to supplement the analyses of wholeround core pieces and discrete cubes. In addition, if downhole measurement of $P$ -wave velocity by the Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) is no t possible because of temperature limitations (see Downhole loggin g operations), these section-half measurements may provide th e most continuous record of $P$ -wave velocity variation with depth . Successful analyses require good contact between the transducer s and the rock and core liner surfaces, which is enhanced by wettin g the transducers with deionized water. For vesicular samples, successful analysis may require saturated samples. In such cases, measurements were made on seawater-saturated samples used fo r thermal conductivity measurements.  

# Moisture and density measurements  

For hard rock samples, MAD measurements were made o n rough pieces, sediments, and discrete $8\,\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sample cubes that wer e also used for paleomagnetic and $P$ -wave velocity measurements. Mass and volume measurements were made to determine bulk density, dry density, grain density, and porosity. The shipboard MA D facility consists of a dual-balance system and a hexapycnometer.  

# Dual-balance system  

A dual-balance system was used to measure both wet and dr y masses. Two analytical balances (Mettler-Toledo XS204) compensate for ship motion; one acts as a reference, and the other measure s the sample relative to the reference. A standard mass of simila r value to that of the sample mass was placed on the reference balanc e to increase accuracy. An accuracy of $0.005\ \mathrm{g}$ was readily attainabl e by using a reference mass within $10\%$ of the sample mass. Sample s were saturated in seawater under vacuum conditions for ${\sim}2\ \mathrm{h}$ an d then weighed to obtain their wet mass. Samples were placed in a n oven at $105\pm5^{\circ}\,\mathrm{C}$ for $22{-}24\,\mathrm{h}$ and then allowed to cool in a desiccator for $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ prior to dry mass measurement.  

# Hexapycnometer system  

The hexapycnometer is an IODP custom-built system that use s six MicroMetrics cell units, electronics, and control programs. Th e system measures dry sample volume using pressurized He-fille d chambers with a precision of $0.02~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Shipboard technicians performed a calibration using stainless steel spheres of known volum e at the start of the expedition and whenever the helium gas tank wa s changed. For each measurement, five cells containing samples an d one cell containing two calibration spheres (3 and $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ) with a total volume of $10~\:\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ were run. Calibration spheres were cycle d through the cells to identify any systematic error and/or instrumen t drift. Spheres were assumed to be known to within $1\%$ of their total volume. If the volumes of the calibration spheres deviated by ${>}1\%$ from their known volumes, then that pycnometer cell was recalibrated.  

Moisture and density calculations  

MAD calculations were performed according to Method C i n the IODP Physical Properties Handbook (Blum, 1997). For densit y calculations, both mass and volume are first corrected for the sal t content of the pore fluid:  

$$
M_{\mathrm{salt}}=\left[S(M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})\right]/(1-S),
$$  

where  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{M_{\mathrm{salt}}=\mathrm{mass\of\salt},}\\ &{S=\mathrm{pore\water\salinity\(seawater\with\salinity\35\psu\or\0.035}}\\ &{\;\;\;\;\;\;\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}),}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{w}}=\mathrm{wet\mass\of\the\sample,and}}\\ &{M_{\mathrm{d}}=\mathrm{dry\mass\of\the\sample.}}\end{array}
$$  

Grain density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{g}})$ is determined from the dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{d}})$ and dr y volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$ measurements:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{g}}=(M_{\mathrm{d}}-M_{\mathrm{salt}})/[V_{\mathrm{d}}-(M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\mathsf{\uprho}_{\mathrm{salt}})],}\end{array}
$$  

where $\mathsf{\rho_{p_{s a l t}}}$ is the density of salt $(2.20\:\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ .  

The salt-corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ is calculated as  

$$
M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})/(1-S).
$$  

Then the volume of pore water $\mathrm{\nabla}V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ is  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\rho_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{w}}-M_{\mathrm{d}})/[(1-S)\rho_{\mathrm{pw}}],
$$  

where we assume the density of the pore fluid $(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})\,=\,1.024~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (seawater with salinity of $35\,\mathrm{psu}$ ).  

To calculate sample bulk density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ of the wet sample, bulk volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ of the wet sample is first computed:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{b}}=V_{\mathrm{d}}+V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

Then  

$$

# Downhole logging operations  

Downhole logging data are rapidly and continuously collected i n situ at sampling intervals ranging from $2.5\;\mathrm{mm}$ to $15\,\mathrm{cm}$ . These dat a are used to determine the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the formation penetrated by a borehole. They can aid the interpretation of the rock stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, an d geochemical composition, as well as the formation fluid conditions. Downhole logs also provide information about the status and size o f a borehole, which can include information about formation stress o r deformation induced by drilling. In the event of incomplete core recovery, the continuous nature of this data set may provide the onl y means of characterizing the geological formation structure an d lithostratigraphy and fluid conditions penetrated by the drill hole. Downhole logs are intermediate in scale between laboratory measurements of core samples and volcano-scale geophysical survey s and are therefore particularly useful in calibrating and groundtruthing the interpretation of these geophysical survey data. In short, logs are an essential link in understanding physical propertie s across a range of scales. Due to incomplete core recovery, loggin g data proved particularly valuable during Expedition 376 and will b e important in postcruise studies.  

During Expedition 376, we drilled into a hydrothermal environment that required monitoring of in situ temperatures using the Elevated Temperature Borehole Sensor tool (ETBS) before runnin g other wireline logs because most wireline logging tools are limite d to operational temperatures of either $\boldsymbol{\le}175^{\circ}$ or $\le\!260^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . We also use d a new tool, the Petrospec thermocouple memory tool (TCMT), fo r monitoring rebounded borehole temperatures, and we collecte d borehole fluids with a Kuster FTS. All tool acronyms are listed i n Tables T24 and T25.  

We adhered to standard wireline logging techniques during Expedition 376. After the temperature was deemed sufficiently low fo r logging by the ETBS, the logging tools were combined and stacke d together, lowered downhole, and pulled up at a constant speed. Recording by the various tools (see below) occurred on both downhol e and uphole passes to increase data recovery. For wireline tools wit h real-time reading, the downhole pass meant that the temperatur e ratings of the tools could be monitored closely so that operational limits were not exceeded. In Hole U1528D, the temperature measured by the ETBS, combined with the low pH and presence of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S_{\mathrm{i}}$ , required deployment of a modified flasked tool string capable of operating in temperatures as high as $260^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# Memory tools  

# Elevated Temperature Borehole Sensor tool  

The ETBS tool is a slim-hole probe run on the coring line (Tabl e T24) that was modified and upgraded from the Ultra High Temperature Multisensor Memory Tool (UHT-MSM) used during OD P Legs 169 and 193 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1998, 2000) (Figur e F29). The tool was originally developed for the University of Miam i (USA) by Geophysical Research Corporation (GRC, 1994a, 1994b, 1996). The ETBS contains internal and ultrahigh external temperature measuring devices, a pressure gauge, a multisensor memor y unit, and a dewar flask that acts as an insulator to maintain a stabl e temperature and cooldown rate for the tool (Figure F29). The hea t shield is aircraft-grade aluminum bound at both ends by brass hea t sinks. The dewar flask can maintain an internal temperature suitable for tool operation for $4{-}5\,\mathrm{~h~}$ at an external temperature o f $400^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Operations are possible for as long as $^{10\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ if the average temperature does not exceed $232^{\circ}C$ .

The ETBS tool was connected to the core line via a new attachment designed on board to be compatible with the Kuster FTS tool. This attachment allows deployment through the throat of the RC B system bit. This procedure minimizes the time that the drill strin g spends without circulation of seawater in the hole, when risk o f borehole collapse is highest. The ETBS was fitted with Chemra z seals and Kalrez O-rings.  

The ETBS has a longer response time than the logging equipment head-mud temperature tool (LEH-MT) on the Schlumberge r High-Temperature Triple Combo (HTTC), triple combo, and Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool strings (see Wirelin e tools). The ETBS also reaches higher speeds of acquisition (60–7 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{min}$ in Hole U1528D and $20{-}40~\mathrm{m/min}$ in Hole U1530A) compared with the LEH-MT $\left(8{-}10\ \mathrm{m/min}\right)$ ), indicating that the ETB S underestimates temperatures in zones of rapidly increasing temperature with depth and the converse.  

# Petrospec thermocouple memory tool  

The spool-in Petrospec TCMT was developed by Petrospec fo r Expedition 376 (Figure F30). It is designed to measure high hydrothermal fluid temperatures that exceed the ETBS rating, particularly after rebound of downhole temperatures from drilling-induce d disturbance. Because it is deployed on the coring line within th e drill string, it is engineered to operate in highly corrosive fluids. Th e Petrospec TCMT is composed of a $9\,\textrm{m}$ long thermocouple cabl e rated to $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , two discrete temperature-sensing junctions at th e terminal end of the cable, and a memory tool carrier assembly rate d to $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ that is capable of measuring temperature at regular interval s (e.g., 1 s, $_{10\,s}$ , or $1\;\mathrm{min}$ ). The memory tool carrier is kept within th e drill string in circulating cold seawater, whereas the thermocoupl e cable hangs below the bottom of the drill string with the sensors i n the open hole, weighted by a sinker bar.

# Kuster Flow Through Sampler  

Borehole fluid sampling was accomplished using a Kuster FTS. The Kuster FTS is rated to 10,000 psi (690 bar) and $232.2^{\circ}C_{\mathrm{{3}}}$ , although it has been successfully run as high as $260^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (M. Watkins, pers. comm., 2018). The Kuster FTS tool with a $1000~\mathrm{{mL}}$ sampl e chamber was initially fitted with a Kalrez 7075 O-ring, but the entire assembly was lost in the hole. Hence, all sampling during Expedition 376 was conducted using a backup $600\,\mathrm{\mL}$ Monel steel Kuster FTS tool (Probe product reference 11700-100) deployed o n the core line (Figure F31) with standard O-rings provided by M B Century. The tool was run directly after temperature logging wit h the ETBS to identify depths where hydrothermal fluids were mos t likely flowing into the borehole. Procedures for downhole surve y operation were followed in accordance with manufacturer guidelines (MB Century, unpubl. data. Available from Info- $\cdot\mathbf{NZ}@$ mbcentury.com.).  

![](images/ee464610b833e9dbde589bd0a82a58e22d979d60e30324cb3d97201014ea15ae.jpg)  
Figure F31. Kuster FTS.  

The tool consists of a $600~\mathrm{mL}$ capacity fluid sample chamber , which can be connected to an additional $400\,\mathrm{mL}$ capacity tube wit h a spring-loaded valve on each end of the sample chamber. The lowe r end has a removable bull nose with ports to allow the fluid to enter. At the top is a rope socket for attaching the wireline. A latchin g mechanism connects the valves together and holds them ope n during deployment. A programmable mechanical clock is attache d above the chamber, with either 1 or $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$ clocks for trigger times ${<}50$ min and ${>}50\ \mathrm{min}$ , respectively. This clock is preset at the surface t o define the closing time, at which point a ball-operated trippin g mechanism releases the valves, trapping the fluid in the sampler an d maintaining the pressure of the sampling depth until the tool is recovered and the fluids are retrieved through a transfer head assembly (see Borehole fluid geochemistry). Operationally, $10\;\mathrm{min}$ wer e allowed to elapse following the estimated valve closure time befor e the Kuster FTS was recovered at an ascent rate of $70~\mathrm{m/min}$ . Although the fluid sampling locations cannot be definitively confirmed because of the clock-triggered closing mechanism, the 1 0 min buffer maximizes the likelihood that the sample was trapped a t the deepest depth reached on each run.

Between samples, the Kuster FTS was cleaned with ACS reagen t grade acetone, rinsed with deionized water, and serviced followin g manufacturer guidelines (MB Century, unpubl. data). Likewise, i t was ensured that the transfer head assembly was free of contaminants by washing with acetone and distilled water and testing tha t the valves would easily open or shut. After recovery of the sampler, the valves, the O-rings, and any stuck particles on the O-rings wer e checked for mechanical wear and embrittlement and replaced a s necessary prior to the next run. Because of the downhole exposur e to high-temperature $(>\!246^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and low-pH (1.8) fluids, the tool run s in Hole U1528D required more extensive servicing because the too l returned with a green-black coating and degraded O-rings. Cleaning the tool required using the onboard heat transfer system for th e main chamber and an ultrasonic bath followed by a wire wheel fo r the smaller parts, with a full servicing of every part of the tool.  

# Temperature-indicating strips  

Temperature-indicating strips were positioned in a housing o n top of the core barrel, in the Thermowell part of the Kuster FTS, an d in the data logger carrier of the Petrospec TCMT. These self-adhesive labels consist of a series of temperature-sensitive purified organic  chemicals  sealed  between  heat-resistant  substrate  wit h transparent windows. Each element changes color distinctly (whit e to black) as its rated temperature is exceeded (Figure F32). Strip s manufactured by OMEGA record temperature from $40^{\circ}$ to $260^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and strips from Tempil record temperatures from $37^{\circ}$ to $290^{\circ}C$ (Table T26). This simple method provides an estimate of the highes t temperature encountered by the strip during that deployment. Not e that the steel housing is too thick to fully equilibrate quickly enoug h with mud temperature. The strips need to be isolated from fluids t o ensure reliable measurements (Figure F32B).  

# Wireline tools  

Downhole measurements with real-time surface read-out (wireline) data were acquired using a variety of logging tools (manufactured  by  Schlumberger  and  the  Lamont-Doherty  Eart h Observatory) that were combined into tool strings (Tables T24, T25) and run downhole on a wireline cable after coring operation s were completed in Holes U1528D and U1530A. During Expeditio n 376, three tool strings were used (Figure F33):  

• A HTTC tool string in Hole U1528D recorded bulk density and photoelectric effect (PEF; Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde [HLDS]), spectral (Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde [HNGS]) and total count (Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge [EDTC]) natural gamma ray, and fluid temperature (LEH-MT).   
• A standard triple combo tool string in Hole U1530A recorded bulk density and PEF (HLDS), porosity (Accelerator Porosity Sonde [APS]), spectral (HNGS) and total count (EDTC) natural gamma ray, resistivity (High-Resolution Laterolog Array [HRLA] tool), and fluid temperature (LEH-MT).   
• A FMS-sonic tool string in Hole U1530A recorded sonic velocities (DSI), resistivity image (FMS), and spectral (HNGS) and total count (EDTC) natural gamma ray.  

Each of these tool strings also included a telemetry cartridge i n the EDTC that transmitted the data in real time from the tools t o the Schlumberger data acquisition system (MAXIS unit) on the shi p through the wireline cable. The tools in the high-temperature too l string were vacuum-flasked to increase their temperature rating. The wireline cable, which powers the tools and transmits the data t o the surface in real time, is rated to $232^{\circ}C,$ thereby limiting operations with the HTTC tool string. In addition, the 7-Conductor wireline sheathed in armor-wire Galvanized Improved Plow Steel i s rated to fluids with $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S}<\!0.05$ psi $(345\;\mathrm{Pa})$ partial pressure and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ${<}32$ psi $(0.2\,\mathrm{\MPa})$ partial pressure. Exceeding these condition s would cause embrittlement of the wireline. Thus, the wireline cabl e was inspected after each logging run, and any affected sections wer e cut out as deemed necessary.  

![](images/3299f0d5a5ce2ed0256682548f0b11d028fa777d530a1ecf77f05140f10ce4c3.jpg)  
Figure F33. Wireline tool strings used in Holes U1528D and U1530A. See text and Table T24 for tool acronyms.  

At Site U1528, the bit was changed to a logging bit before too l string deployment, whereas at Site U1530, a mechanical bit releas e was used to drop the RCB bit in the hole ahead of logging. The dril l string was then pulled inside the casing, and the tool strings wer e deployed through the drill string on a 7-Conductor wireline cable i n sequential runs. Owing to the absence of a reentry system at Sit e U1530 (i.e., there was no casing), the drill pipe was raised to ${\sim}70$ mbsf, and the logging tools were deployed through the drill string. Logging data were recorded in the open-hole section below thi s depth. At both sites, each tool string was pulled up at a constan t speed, typically ${\sim}9\mathrm{\m/min_{\mathrm{:}}}$ , to provide a continuous set of measurements in each logging run. To minimize the effect of the ship’s heav e on the position of the tool string in the borehole, a wireline heav e compensator (WHC) was employed as required (see below). Durin g each logging run, real-time incoming data were recorded and monitored on the MCM MAXIS logging computer.  

The Schlumberger logging equipment head (or cablehead) measures tension at the very top of the wireline tool string. These measurements detect and can diagnose difficulties in running the tool string up or down the borehole when exiting or entering the drill string or casing. The EDTC includes an accelerometer whose dat a are used to evaluate the efficiency of the WHC (see below). Th e EDTC also includes a scintillation gamma ray detector to aid correlation between log runs and detects when the tool passes the seafloor. A clearer indication of the seafloor is provided by the HNGS.  

Because the tool strings combine tools of different generation s and various designs, they include several adapters and joints between individual tools to allow communication, provide isolation, avoid interferences (mechanical or acoustic), terminate wirings, o r position the tool properly in the borehole. Knuckle joints in particular were used to allow some of the tools, such as the HRLA resistivity tool, to remain centralized in the borehole while the overlyin g HLDS was pressed against the borehole wall. All of these addition s contribute to the total length of the tool strings (Figure F33).  

At the end of the Hole U1528D logging session, which encountered high-temperature, low- $\cdot{\mathsf{p H}},$ , and $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ -bearing fluids, the tool s were washed on the rig floor. The resultant black-green coating o n the tools had to be subsequently cleaned with sandpaper and a wir e wheel.  

# Logged formation properties and tool measurement principles  

The properties of the formations logged and the methods b y which they were measured are described below. The main logs recorded during Expedition 376 are listed in Table T25. Further information regarding individual tools and their applications is widel y available (e.g., Ellis and Singer, 2007; Goldberg, 1997; Lovell et al., 1998; Rider and Kennedy, 2011; Schlumberger, 1989; Serra, 1984, 1986, 1989). In addition, a complete list of acronyms for Schlumberger tools and logs  is available  at http://www.glossary.oil - field.slb.com.  

# Natural gamma radiation  

Total and spectral gamma ray measurements were acquired using the HNGS. This tool utilizes two bismuth germanate scintillation  detectors  and  five-window  spectroscopy  to  determin e concentrations of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $\ensuremath{^{232}}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ in the formation. Sensitivity t o any additives in the drilling fluid (notably sepiolite-based drillin g mud clay) is eliminated because the HNGS filters out gamma ra y energies $<\!500\;\mathrm{keV},$ thus improving measurement accuracy. The inclusion of HNGS in all tool strings allows the use of gamma ray dat a for depth correlation between consecutive tool string runs and individual tool string passes (up and down).  

# Density  

The HLDS measures formation density utilizing a cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source and far and near gamma ray detectors mounte d on a shielded skid. This skid is pressed against the borehole wall using a hydraulically activated eccentering arm. The gamma particle s emitted from the source are attenuated through the process o f Compton scattering, which involves a partial energy loss resultin g from elastic collision with electrons in the formation. The quantit y of gamma radiation that reaches the detectors is directly related t o the density of electrons in the formation, which in turn is related t o the bulk density. Good tool/borehole contact is essential for effective HLDS measurements, whereas poor contact results in an underestimation of formation density values.  

# Photoelectric effect  

The HLDS also measures photoelectric absorption as the PEF. After repeated Compton scattering, as a result of collision with formation electrons, gamma radiation reaches an energy that is lo w enough $(<\!150\,\mathrm{keV})$ to be photoelectrically absorbed. The PEF is dependent on the atomic number of the elements in the formation an d therefore varies according to the mineralogical composition of th e lithologies encountered. As such, the PEF can be used to identif y the presence of some minerals. Bartetzko et al. (2003), for example, interpret values ${>}6$ barns $\mathbf{\epsilon}^{\prime}\mathbf{e}^{-}$ as a general indicator for sulfide or oxide mineralization.  

# Porosity  

A porosity measurement can be derived from the HLDS densit y measurement using average grain density, for example from MA D measurements on core samples (see Physical properties) and flui d density.  

Formation porosity was measured with the APS in Hol e U1530A. The sonde includes a minitron neutron generator tha t produces fast neutrons and five detectors positioned at differen t spacings from the minitron. The tool’s detectors count neutron s that arrive after being scattered and slowed by collisions wit h atomic nuclei in the formation. The highest energy loss occurs whe n neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei, which have essentially th e same mass as the neutron. Therefore, the tool provides a measure o f hydrogen content, which is most commonly found in water in th e pore fluid and can be directly related to porosity. However, hydrogen may be present in sedimentary, igneous, and alteration minerals, including clay minerals, which can result in an overestimation o f actual porosity.  

Upon reaching thermal energies $(0.025\ \mathrm{eV})$ , the neutrons ar e captured by the nuclei of Cl, Si, B, and other elements, resulting i n gamma ray emission. This neutron capture cross section (Σf) is als o measured by the tool and can be used to identify these element s (Broglia and Ellis, 1990; Brewer et al., 1996).  

# Electrical resistivity  

Six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation (including one borehole fluid measurement and five formatio n measurements) were acquired with the HRLA. The array provide s direct resistivity measurements by emitting a focused current int o the formation and measuring the intensity necessary to maintain  a constant drop in voltage across a fixed interval. The HRLA has on e central (source) electrode and six electrodes above and below it tha t alternate as transmitting and receiving current electrodes. Simultaneous resistivity measurements at six penetration depths are possible because of the rapid alternation in roles of these electrodes. Typically, sulfide and oxide minerals and ionic solutions like por e fluid are electrical conductors, whereas silicates found in crustal rocks are electrical insulators. As a result, electrical conduction i n most rocks will occur primarily by ion transport through pore fluid s and conductive minerals such as phyllosilicates (Bartetzko et al., 2003). Thus, the resistivity measurement is largely dependent o n porosity from fractures and matrix.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The DSI measures the transit time of acoustic pulses betwee n sonic transmitters and an array of eight receivers. The resultin g waveforms are used to calculate the sonic velocity of the formation. High-frequency $(5{-}15~\mathrm{kHz})$ pulses emitted by an omnidirectional monopole transmitter are used to extract the compressional velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ of the formation. It is possible to extract the shear wave velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{{S}}}\right)$ from these data in the event that it is faster than th e acoustic velocity in the borehole fluid. The monopole transmitte r can also be fired in sequence at a lower frequency $(0.5{-}1.0\ \mathrm{kHz})$ t o generate Stoneley waves, which are sensitive to fractures and variations in formation permeability. The DSI has two cross-dipol e transmitters that facilitate the acquisition of shear wave velocit y data in slow formations where the formation $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ is less than that o f the borehole fluid. In fast formations, $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ measurements from th e monopole waveforms are possible and have sharper arrivals an d more accurate $V_{\mathrm{{S}}}$ estimates than the equivalent cross-dipole data. However, the cross-dipole-derived shear velocities can be useful i n identifying any sonic anisotropy associated with the local stress regime.  

# Microresistivity images  

High-resolution electrical resistivity images of the borehol e walls were provided by the FMS. The tool has four orthogonal arm s with pads, and each pad has 16 button electrodes that are presse d against the borehole wall during recording. The electrodes are arranged in two diagonally offset rows with eight electrodes in eac h row. A focused current is emitted from these electrodes into the formation, with a return electrode near the top of the tool. Formatio n resistivity is derived from the intensity of the current passin g through the button electrodes. Processing these data in combination with azimuthal data from the General Purpose Inclinometr y Tool (GPIT; see below) transforms the measurements into geographically oriented, high-resolution (millimeter to centimete r scale) images that can reveal the geologic features exposed in th e borehole wall. Features such as vesicles, veins, fractures, and volcaniclastic textures may be resolved, and fabric analysis can be undertaken, in addition to quantitative analyses of the nature an d orientation of structural and stratigraphic features.  

The FMS microresistivity images do not provide full coverage o f the borehole wall with a single pass $\,\,{\sim}37\%$ coverage in an 8.5 inc h hole). To increase this coverage, it is standard practice to undertak e two passes of the borehole in the hope that the tool will be oriente d differently on the second pass.  

# Accelerometry and magnetic field measurement  

The GPIT undertakes three-component acceleration and magnetic field measurements. The primary purpose of this tool is to determine the acceleration and geographic orientation of the too l string in which it is deployed. The resulting data can be used to facilitate corrections for irregular tool motion and to provide geographically oriented image data from the FMS tool. GPIT data ar e also used to provide real-time evaluation of the WHC (see Wirelin e heave compensator).  

# Log data quality  

The condition of a borehole is the principal factor contributin g to log data quality. The ideal conditions for logging include a consistent borehole diameter of the size of the bit with no washouts (enlarged  borehole)  or  bridges  (narrowed  borehole).  Oversize d borehole diameters can have a significant impact on measurements, especially those that require tool eccentering (e.g., HLDS) or too l centralization (e.g., FMS). The measurement principles of the eccentered tools and the centralized FMS mean that direct contac t with the formation is essential for acquisition of high-quality dat a sets. Borehole wall contact is lost beyond a 20 inch $(50.80\,\mathrm{cm})$ ) borehole diameter for the HLDS and a 15 inch $(38.10~\mathrm{cm})$ ) borehole diameter for the FMS. Certain measurements (notably, spectra l gamma ray [HNGS], resistivity [HRLA], and acoustic velocity [DSI] ) taken during Expedition 376 are still representative of the formatio n in larger borehole diameters. Consequently, these measurement s are less affected by borehole conditions, although data are optimized in boreholes where the tools can be centralized (as large a s $\mathord{\sim}20$ inch diameter). High temperatures can also limit data qualit y because of the faster logging speeds required for tool preservation.  

If the borehole diameter changes over short intervals as a consequence of washouts or ledges, logging results may be irregular. Bridged sections will also cause irregular log results. The quality o f the borehole can be improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling fluid, flushing the borehole to remove debris prior to logging, performing a full wiper trip, and starting logging as soon as possible after drilling and hole conditioning.  

The length of wireline cable payed out is used to determine th e depth of the logging measurements. The quality of this loggin g depth determination is dependent on a number of factors, includin g the ship’s heave, cable stretch, cable slip, and tidal changes. To minimize the effect of the ship’s heave on logging depth, a hydrauli c WHC is used to adjust the wireline length for rig motion during logging operations (see Wireline heave compensator). An importan t reference datum in wireline logging is the seafloor/mudline, whic h is determined from the gamma ray logs acquired in each loggin g run. Discrepancies between the drilling core depth and the wirelin e logging depth occur because of incomplete core recovery, core expansion, incomplete heave compensation, and drill pipe stretch. Reconciling the differences between the two data sets is possibl e through comparison of the common data sets acquired in situ an d on the core (e.g., NGR and MS).  

# Wireline heave compensator  

The WHC, first used during Integrated Ocean Drilling Progra m Expedition $320\mathrm{T}$ in 2009, is designed to compensate for the ship’ s vertical motion to help maintain the steady movement of the logging tools in the borehole (Iturrino et al., 2013). Vertical acceleration measurements made by the motion reference unit, locate d under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity, are used to calculate the vertical motion of the ship. The WHC then adjusts th e length of the wireline by varying the distance between two sets o f pulleys through which the cable passes. Simultaneous real-tim e measurements of surface and downhole acceleration are made b y the EDTC and GPIT tools (see Accelerometry and magnetic fiel d measurement), respectively. These data are then analyzed an d compared in real time using a software package developed by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The actual motion of the tool string is displayed, enabling evaluation of the compensator’s efficiency.  

The WHC was used during logging operations at Sites U152 8 and U1530 with favorable sea conditions (<1 m peak-to-pea k heave).  

# Logging data flow and depth scales  

Downhole data for each logging run were monitored in real tim e and recorded by the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. Initially, th e logging data were referenced to the rig floor. After completion o f logging operations, the data were shifted to a seafloor reference using the step in gamma ray data (acquired in all logging runs) at th e sediment/water interface.  

Downhole logging data were also transferred onshore to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory for standardized data processing. Processing primarily involves depth matching to provide consistency in the depth scale between the different logging runs. Simila r to the depth shift to the seafloor datum, this depth matching wa s undertaken primarily by utilizing the gamma ray data. In addition, corrections were made to certain tools and logs (e.g., speed an d voltage corrections to microresistivity images), documentation fo r the logs (including an assessment of log data quality) was prepared, and the data were converted to ASCII for the conventional logs an d  

GIF for the images. The data were transferred back to the shi p within a few days of logging and were made available (in ASCII an d DLIS formats) through the shipboard IODP logging database.  

# Microbiology  

Microbial community development patterns associated with th e two different types of hydrothermal activity at Brothers volcan o have been explored using limited samples collected from the seafloor (Stott et al., 2008; Takai et al., 2009). Microbial communit y compositions collected from chimneys at the Type I NW Calder a site are characterized by an abundance of slightly thermophilic an d hyperthermophilic chemolithoautotrophs (Takai et al., 2009), as observed in typical high-temperature hydrothermal vent environments of mid-ocean ridges and back-arc basin systems (Nakamur a and Takai, 2014). When the temperature is below $150^{\circ}C,$ , aerobic t o facultatively  anaerobic,  acidophilic  sulfur–  and  iron-oxidizin g chemolithotrophs and accompanying heterotrophs may be present.  

The collective overarching objectives for microbiological stud y focus on the biomass, activity, and community structure of subsurface microbial and viral communities using an array of microbiological applications. Relatively few shipboard analyses were performe d because most measurements require postcruise studies in shorebased laboratories. Consequently, the majority of our effort wa s dedicated to collecting and preserving an adequate number of samples for subsequent shore-based molecular biological studies.  

Shore-based analyses will use a number of techniques to achiev e the overall science objectives. DNA analyses of small-subunit (SSU ) ribosomal gene amplicon sequencing will be conducted to addres s community structure. Metagenomics analysis will be conducted t o reconstruct the metabolic potential and identify entire genome s from microbial populations in the samples. RNA determination using metatranscriptomics will help to establish potential communit y activity (i.e., the genes that are highly expressed in a given microbia l environment).  Genetic  potential  determined  through  metagenomics and single-cell genomics will provide detailed information about the possible metabolic characteristics of microbes, lin k those potentials to cellular identity, and provide clues related to th e best environment to cultivate cells from recovered samples. Metabolic activity measurements of microbial communities using stable isotope– or radioactive isotope–labeled tracers will identify wha t kinds of major energy and carbon metabolisms are potentially present and their rates in the subseafloor habitats. Enrichment of specific  groups  of  microorganisms  will  identify  the  uniqu e physiological properties of the organisms. A considerable amoun t of time during the expedition was dedicated to collecting sample s for quality assurance and quality control to constrain the microbiological quality of the samples.  

The microbiologists plan to correlate these molecular microbiological and cultivation results with variations in IW geochemistry t o interpret the metabolic potential of the microbial communities. Our goal for these comparisons will be to test specific hypothese s regarding the consequences of magma degassing for metal transport to the seafloor and its effect on the functioning of microbia l communities. The metal-rich and acidic nature of the Brothers volcano hydrothermal system may also unleash discoveries related t o the origin of microbial life on Earth.  

# Sampling  

Microbiological sampling depends on careful sample handlin g techniques and the use of tracers to assess potential contamination.  

Microorganisms collected from beneath the seafloor are expecte d to be sensitive to chemical and physical changes they encounte r when brought to the surface. Changes in oxygen concentration an d temperature are two important factors to be considered whe n bringing cells from likely hot, anoxic conditions to the surface. Therefore, the following procedures were followed to minimiz e harm to subsurface microbes without compromising other expedition objectives.  

For microbiological studies, whole-round core samples are required to have enough material to work with while avoiding contamination introduced by sample handling before and during th e core splitting process. Whole rounds were sampled in the splittin g room after the core was brought in from the catwalk. Technician s wore gloves and face masks and shook the core into a split core line r sprayed with ethanol to minimize the chances of contamination. The microbiologist then selected a whole-round section for sampling with the Co-Chief Scientist on shift or the Staff Scientist. A n ideal sample was one that consisted largely of sediments (epiclastic or volcaniclastic deposits) and/or that had some indication of hydrothermal fracturing (such as visible veins) but that had not spli t apart during the dislocation and did not have a unique lithology tha t would be critical to the core description team. Both the microbiologists and the geologists taking part in sample selection wore glove s sprayed with ethanol and a face mask to limit possible contamination of the sample from human contact. The microbiologists wor e closed-sleeve laboratory coats. The whole-round rock sample chosen for dedicated microbiology investigation was then transferre d into a sterile Whirl-Pak bag and transported to the microbiolog y laboratory for processing.  

Once in the microbiology laboratory, the whole-round sampl e was rinsed four times in sterile water (changing the Whirl-Pak ba g once after the second rinse) to reduce contamination from drillin g fluid. The sample was then transferred to an ethanol-sterilize d metal rock box placed under aseptic conditions using a tabl e KOACH (a super-clean zone creator) (KOKEN T-500, Tokyo, Japan) with a HEPA air filter, which greatly reduced the number of ai r particles (Figure F34). The outside of each core was sprayed wit h $70\%$ ethanol at least twice and then sprayed one final time with ethanol and left to air dry $\mathrm{{\sim}}5\;\mathrm{{min})}$ ). At all stages of the process, sample s were handled as little as possible and with gloved hands only. Masks, gloves, and a laboratory coat were worn by those handlin g the samples during whole-round cleaning and all subsequent steps. Prior work has shown that the interior of rock cores is generall y free from contamination (Lever et al., 2006). Therefore, efforts wer e  

taken to sample only the interior of the cores. Sections that displayed soft material or showed some sign of alteration or fluid flo w conduits were specifically chosen because these are the most likel y locations for microbial life.  

On average, microbiology samples were ${\sim}10{-}12\ \mathrm{cm}$ long. Sample material was divided into subsamples for a variety of tests (Figure F35). All inclusive, these tests include shore-based cell and viral particle counts, molecular biology (DNA and RNA), viral and prokaryotic activity measurements, initiation of fungal and prokaryoti c enrichment cultures, shipboard initiation of nutrient addition bioassays, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification. Subsamples were collected for cell and viral particle counts, DNA and RN A analyses, nutrient enrichment incubations and ATP quantification, and activity measurements, depending on material available.  

After cleaning the exterior of whole-round core samples, th e rock was split with a sterile chisel and core interiors were subsampled for the above-mentioned tests. Ethanol-sterilized stainles s steel spatula and tweezers were used to separate the core exterio r from the interior of large pieces. Samples for RNA analysis wer e taken first and immediately frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (in RNAlater solutio n [Invitrogen Ref. AM7021]). Whenever pieces of the whole-roun d core remained after collection of material for analysis, they were returned to the curator to be placed back into the working and archiv e halves, along with the outer portions of the core that had to be removed for sampling. Following completion of sample processing, all tools and the rock box were cleaned with deionized water. The y were then brought back into the sampling enclosure and spraye d with $75\%$ ethanol, wiped with Kimwipes, sprayed with $75\%$ ethanol again, and allowed to air dry. The bench top was also sprayed wit h $75\%$ ethanol, wiped with Kimwipes, sprayed once more, and allowed to air dry.

# Contamination testing of drilling fluid  

As part of the drilling process, a huge amount of surface seawater is injected into the borehole as drilling fluid. This is the majo r potential source of microorganism contamination of the cores. As  a check for infiltration of drilling fluid into the core samples, the microbial composition of drilling fluid will be assessed onshore vi a DNA sequencing approaches. We collected samples of the drillin g fluid for microbial community SSU ribosomal RNA gene diversit y analysis at the start of drilling during Expedition 376 and then periodically thereafter. These samples were collected directly from th e injection pipe on the rig floor into sterile bottles with screw cap s and handled using sterile equipment. Organisms found to be present in both the drilling fluid and rock samples will be considered  a sign of contamination. Although it is possible that some taxa foun d in surface seawater may also survive in the deep subsurface biosphere, these organisms will be conservatively interpreted to b e contaminants, not subsurface residents. Thus, any samples wher e all of the organisms detected during postcruise analyses are also detected in the drilling fluid will be excluded from further analysis. Consistent with a recent study of deep subsurface sediments (Inagaki et al., 2015), we consider that a conservative approach is mos t appropriate. $\mathrm{Our\,1\,L}$ samples of drilling fluid were filtered onto 4 5 $\operatorname*{mm}0.20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ pore-size Millipore Express Plus polycarbonate filter s and frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-based DNA extraction and analysis. Samples of drilling mud (i.e., sepiolite) were also collected on the ri g floor prior to injection into the drill pipe into two sterile $50~\mathrm{mL}$ polypropylene centrifuge tubes and frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for shore-base d DNA extraction.  

Perfluoromethyl decaline (PFMD) was added to the drillin g fluid as a tracer at a rate of ${\sim}0.55\,\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ ( $1\%$ of the mud pump rate; equivalent to between 0.4 and $0.6\;\mathrm{mL/min}$ ). Because the concentration of PFMD in the samples was very low, the rate was increased b y ten times at Site U1531. Samples were taken only for the cores tha t were tested for contamination. For contamination tests of wholeround samples, a fragment of the exterior of each core sample prio r to cleaning was transferred to a $20~\mathrm{mL}$ headspace glass vial wit h metal caps and Teflon seals for detection of PFMD. This sampl e provided a baseline for the level of contamination present prior t o cleaning. This process ensured that the rock samples measured fo r PFMD were completely exposed to the PFMD, whereas, when sampling from the whole round, one inevitably includes portions of th e rock interior just behind the outside wall that were not exposed. Sampling of the exterior of the whole round was also conducted following cleaning of the core sample exterior and then again for a n interior sample.  

# Cell counts  

A subsample of $\{\sim}5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ was placed into a $15\,\mathrm{mL}$ plastic tube, an d then $5\,\mathrm{mL}$ (or enough to cover the sample) of paraformaldehyde $(4\%$ solution in $100\,\mathrm{\mM}$ phosphate-buffered saline) was added. Preserved samples were stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for onshore analysis using  a density gradient separation of cells from rocks prior to cell counting.  

# Activity measurements  

Samples $(50\;\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ for activity measurements were collected an d stored in $100\;\mathrm{mL}$ glass bottles with $1~\mathrm{mL}$ of $5\%$ (weight/volume) sodium sulfide $\mathrm{(Na_{2}S)}$ solution and a butyl rubber stopper under $\Nu_{2}$ atmosphere at $4^{\circ}C$ for onshore analysis.  

# Virus assessment and quantification  

Samples $(10~\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ ) were collected and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for onshore virus counting. Additionally, $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ long whole rounds wer e anaerobically stored at $4^{\circ}C$ for viral production analysis. Finally, samples $(10\,\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ were collected and stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for onshore viral diversity studies based on polymerase chain reaction amplification.  

# Cultivation experiments (nutrient addition experiments)  

Little is known about limiting factors for growth in subseafloo r volcanic basement because of the difficulty of sampling this environment and the typically low biomass. We used a nutrient additio n bioassay approach to assess whether added inorganic nutrient s and/or organic carbon can stimulate growth of in situ microbia l communities. Microcosm experiments in $20~\mathrm{mL}$ serum vials wer e used for this purpose, with anaerobic seawater (seawater collecte d from the ship during sampling was filtered and autoclaved) as th e basal media for all enrichments. Depending on availability, $\{\sim}5~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ samples were pulverized using a sterile chisel and hammer i n Whirl-Pak bags to contain the fragments in sterile conditions. Fou r conditions were tested: (1) no addition of nutrients (control), (2) addition of $750\;\upmu\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{Cl},$ (3) addition of $750\ \upmu\mathrm{M}\,\mathrm{NH}_{4}\mathrm{Cl}$ and $50\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$ $\mathrm{K_{2}H P O_{4}}$ and (4) addition of $200~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ each of acetate, formate, an d lactate. To initiate enrichments, $1{-}3~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of crushed rock chips, depending on sample availability, were transferred to $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ serum vials and submerged in anaerobic sterile seawater to a level equivalen t to $18~\mathrm{mL}$ total volume (crushed rock plus media). After the appropriate additions were made to the vials, they were sealed with butyl stoppers and gassed with nitrogen. Enrichments were stored at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for the remainder of the expedition and will be analyzed 6 month s or more postcruise to allow for sufficient growth.  

# Adenosine triphosphate quantification  

For quantification of ATP in rock samples, we collected $0.1\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of pulverized rock in a $1.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tube. Samples were store d at $4^{\circ}C$ for as long as 4 days before performing the ATP assay becaus e samples were run in batches to preserve and optimize the assay reagent, which requires a standard curve. Previous experiment s showed no difference in quantification for samples read immediately after sampling or after storage (MacLeod et al., 2017). W e added $200~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of autoclaved Milli-Q water to the $0.1~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ powdere d rock, vortexed it for $60\,\mathrm{~s~}$ , and then spun the tube at 2000 rotations/min for 1 min in a benchtop microcentrifuge. The commercial ATP Determination Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA [USA]) was use d for quantification in a Turner TD20/20 Luminometer (available i n the microbiology laboratory). Acid-cleaned $10\%$ HCl) glass vial s were used for measurement. As per the manufacturer’s suggestions, $0.1\;\mathrm{mL}$ of ATP assay mix was added to the glass vials and allowed t o sit for $3\;\mathrm{min}$ prior to adding the sample to hydrolyze any ATP present in the vial. After 3 min, $0.1~\mathrm{mL}$ of the supernatant from the 1. 5 mL centrifuge tube was added to the assay vial, and then the vial wa s swirled briefly and immediately (luminescence fades quickly) place d in the luminometer. Raw luminescence was converted to picogram s per milliliter $(\mathrm{{pg/mL})}$ ATP by running 0, 1, and $10\,\mathrm{pg/mL}$ standards, diluted from the ATP standard included in the kit, with each batc h of samples.  

# Molecular biology  

For DNA analyses, we collected $15{-}50~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ samples and froz e them at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . These samples will be analyzed during postcruise research.  

# RNA  

Samples (rock chips) were placed in sterile $50~\mathrm{mL}$ Falcon tubes , covered in RNAlater, and immediately stored at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . RNAlate r protects the viability of microbial cells while keeping them in stasis, allowing for efficient DNA and RNA extractions from samples collected in the field. These samples will be analyzed during postcruise research.
