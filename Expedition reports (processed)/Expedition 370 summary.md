# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 370 explored the limits of the biosphere in the deep subseafloor where temperature exceeds the known temperature maximum of microbial life $({\sim}120^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ at the sediment/basement interface ${\sim}1.2\,\mathrm{km}$ below the seafloor. Site C0023 is located in the protothrust zone in the Nankai Trough off Cape Muroto at a water depth of $4776\;\mathrm{m},$ in the vicinity of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Sites 808 and 1174. In 2000, ODP Leg 190 revealed the presence of microbial cells at Site 1174 to a depth of ${\sim}600$ meters below seafloor (mbsf), which corresponds to an estimated temperature of ${\sim}70^{\circ}C_{:}$ and reliably identified a single zone of elevated cell concentrations just above the décollement at around 800 mbsf, where temperature presumably reached $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ; no cell count data was reported for other sediment layers in the $70^{\circ}{-}120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ range because the detection limit of manual cell counting for low-biomass samples was not low enough. With the establishment of Site C0023, we aimed to detect and investigate the presence or absence of life and biological processes at the biotic–abiotic transition utilizing unprecedented analytical sensitivity and precision. Expedition 370 was the first expedition dedicated to subseafloor microbiology that achieved time-critical processing and analyses of deep biosphere samples, conducting simultaneous shipboard and shore-based investigations.  

Our primary objective during Expedition 370 was to study the relationship between the deep subseafloor biosphere and temperature. We comprehensively studied the controls on biomass, activity, and diversity of microbial communities in a subseafloor environment where temperatures increase from ${\sim}2^{\circ}C$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and thus likely encompasses the biotic–abiotic transition zone. This included investigating whether the supply of fluids containing thermogenic and/or geogenic nutrient and energy substrates may support subseafloor microbial communities in the Nankai accretionary complex. To address these primary scientific objectives and questions, we penetrated $1180~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered 112 cores of sediment and across the sediment/basalt interface. More than 13,000 samples were collected, and selected samples were transferred to the Kochi Core Center by helicopter for simultaneous microbiological sampling and analysis in laboratories with a superclean environment. In addition to microbiological measurements, we determined the geochemical, geophysical, and hydrogeological characteristics of the sediment and the underlying basement and installed a 13-thermistor sensor borehole temperature observatory into the borehole at Site C0023.  

# Introduction  

Over the course of nearly 50 years of scientific ocean drilling, microbial cells have been found everywhere, even in sediments o f Cretaceous age (Roussel et al., 2008), in extremely nutrient poo r sediment below the ocean gyres (D’Hondt et al., 2009, 2015; Røy e t al., 2012), in the deepest sampled coal-bearing sediments (\~250 0 meters below seafloor [mbsf]) (Inagaki et al., 2015; Glombitza et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017), and in basement rocks (Orcutt et al., 2011; Lever et al., 2013). Metabolic rates of deep subseafloor microbes ar e extraordinarily low (D’Hondt et al., 2002, 2004), with most deepl y buried microbial cells physiologically active (Morono et al., 2011; Imachi et al., 2011; Inagaki et al., 2015) or quiescent as dorman t phase or spore (Lomstein et al., 2012; Langerhuus et al., 2012). Presumably, the subseafloor contains as many microbial cells as all th e water in the global oceans; however, the exact size of the subseafloor biosphere is still a matter of debate (Parkes et al., 1994, 2000; Whitman et al., 1998; Lipp et al., 2008; Kallmeyer et al., 2012; Hinrichs and Inagaki, 2012). To date, the bottom of the deep subseafloor biosphere has not been located, the biosphere–geospher e interactions at this important boundary have not been explored, and it remains to be resolved what poses the ultimate limits to life i n the subseafloor. By addressing these scientific challenges, the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) aims to shed light o n one of the largest continuous ecosystems on Earth (IODP Scienc e Plan,  Challenge  6;  http://www.iodp.org/about-iodp/iodp-science-plan-2013-2023).  

Several Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions addressed environmental conditions that potentially limit life in th e subseafloor: temperature, ${\mathsf{p H}}_{}$ , salinity, availability of potential metabolic energy and nutrients, fluid flow, and pore space. For example, Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 329 studied the influence of energy limitation on subseafloor microbial communitie s in the South Pacific Gyre, where very low concentrations of sedimentary organic matter and its refractory nature strongly limit microbial  life  and  result  in  aerobic  subseafloor  sedimentar y ecosystems with low cell densities of $10^{3}–10^{4}$ cells $/c\mathrm{m}^{3}$ throughou t the sediment column (D’Hondt, Inagaki, Alvarez Zarikian, and th e Expedition 329 Scientists, 2011; D’Hondt et al., 2015). Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 317 (Canterbury Basin) an d 337 (Shimokita Coalbed Biosphere) studied microbial communitie s in extremely deep sediment (2000 and 2500 mbsf, respectively ) (Ciobanu et al., 2014; Inagaki et al., 2015). Although both expeditions presented strong evidence for the presence of microbial lif e throughout the cored sedimentary sequences, Expedition 337 documented an abrupt decrease in microbial cell concentration deepe r than $\mathord{\sim}1500\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ to levels that are drastically lower than predicte d by extrapolation of the global regression line (Inagaki et al., 2015; cf. Parkes et al., 2000, 2014). In spite of the great depths, in situ temperatures did not exceed $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

Temperature is commonly used as the variable that defines th e bottom boundary of the deep biosphere in estimates of its siz e (Whitman et al., 1998; Parkes et al., 2000; Lipp et al., 2008; Heberling et al., 2010; Kallmeyer et al., 2012; Parkes et al., 2014). The currently known upper temperature limit of life for microorganism s inhabiting comparatively energy rich hydrothermal vent environments is at around $120^{\circ}C$ (Blöchl et al., 1997; Kashefi and Lovley, 2003; Takai et al., 2008). However, studies of petroleum biodegradation in deeply buried basins suggest that sterilization takes place between $80^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Head et al., 2003; Wilhelms et al., 2001), an d this finding might be more relevant to the energy-limited deep subseafloor biosphere. The lower temperature limit in subsurface settings relative to hydrothermal settings is possibly linked to th e enhanced requirement of metabolic energy at elevated temperatures for the repair of degraded biomolecules (cf. Head et al., 2003; Hoehler and Jørgensen, 2013; Lever et al., 2015); the potential supply of metabolic energy is low in sedimentary settings that tend t o be lean in electron acceptors and/or donors compared to hydrothermal vents, at which reduced fluids are mixed with oxygenated seawater. Experimental studies with surface sediment demonstrated  a nonlinear effect of temperature on biogeochemistry and prokaryotes, with rapid changes occurring over small temperature intervals, and revealed that substrate addition and increase of metabolic energy result in stimulation of microbial activities at elevated temperatures (Roussel et al., 2015). The influence of temperature o n microbial communities was one of the central questions during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 331 at the Iheya Nort h hydrothermal field in the Okinawa Trough, but this task was severely complicated by extremely high geothermal gradients. Consequently, microbial life seemed to cease within a few tens of meter s below the seafloor, and the strongly condensed temperature zone s prevented in-depth examination of critical depth intervals (Takai, Mottl, Nielsen, and the Expedition 331 Scientists, 2011; Yanagaw a et al., 2014, 2016).  

With the goal of studying the influence of temperature on th e amount, activity, and taxonomic composition of deep subseafloo r sedimentary communities, IODP Expedition 370 revisited an already well-characterized geological setting with relatively high hea t flow: the Muroto Transect in the Nankai Trough off Japan. Expedition 370 established Site C0023 in the vicinity of Ocean Drillin g Program (ODP) Sites 1173, 1174, and 808 (Moore et al., 1991; Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001) about $125\;\mathrm{km}$ offshore Kochi Prefecture, $180~\mathrm{km}$ from Cape Muroto, Japan (Figure F1). In this area, the high heat flow results in temperatures of ${\sim}110^{\circ}{-}130^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at th e sediment/basement interface (Moore et al., 1991; Moore and Saffer, 2001). This particular geological setting enables in-depth examination of the putative temperature-dependent biotic–abiotic transition  zone  with  high-temperature  resolution:  the  increase  o f temperature with depth is still gradual enough for the establishmen t of distinct depth horizons with suitable conditions for psychrophili c (optimal growth temperature range $<\!20^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ ), mesophilic $(20^{\circ}{-}43^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ thermophilic $(43^{\circ}{-}80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , and hyperthermophilic $(>\!80^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ microorganisms.  

The data sets resulting from ODP Legs 131, 190, and 196 an d lessons learned from previous drilling operations guided the scientific and operational approach of Expedition 370. During Leg 190 i n 2000, depth profiles of microbial cell concentrations were obtaine d for Site 1174 by manual microscopic cell counting on the R/V JOIDES Resolution. Because this method had a detection limit of ${\sim}10^{5}$ $\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , cell concentrations appeared to reach nondetectable levels at sediment depths around $600~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , where estimated in sit u temperatures exceed ${\sim}70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Figure F2) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001a). During Expedition 370, we aimed to closely examine th e presence of low-biomass microbial communities in the deep an d hot sedimentary environment.  

Since Leg 190, major advances in cell separation and enumeration technologies for sediment core samples have lowered the minimum quantification limit (MQL) by a factor of ${\sim}10{,}000$ (e.g., Kallmeyer, 2011; Morono et al., 2009, 2013, 2014; Morono and Inagaki, 2010). Likewise, the new capacities offered in the “omics” er a for elucidation of taxonomic composition (e.g., Inagaki et al., 2006; Sogin et al., 2006), metabolic activity, and function at single-cell t o

First drop of cell counts below detectio n limit occurs around $550~\mathsf{m b s f},$ which corresponds to ${\sim}65^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Interestingly, counts exceeded detection limit again in deeper sediment just above th e décollement at around $800{\mathrm{~mbsf}},$ where temperatures presumably reache d $90^{\circ}\mathsf{C}_{\mathrm{\ell}}$ ; no cell detection was reported for samples from greater depths.

community levels (e.g., Biddle et al., 2008; Lloyd et al., 2013; Orsi e t al., 2013), as well as new molecular-isotopic techniques that lin k biomass to substrate pools (e.g., Biddle et al., 2006; Morono et al., 2011; Wegener et al., 2012) and central metabolic intermediates t o distinct geomicrobiological processes (e.g., Heuer et al., 2006, 2009; Zhuang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015), allow entirely new approaches to study microbial life close to the limit of the deep biosphere. Recent advances in analytical capabilities provide a tool ki t for rigorously examining the unique geosphere–biosphere interactions in geothermally heated sediment that involve the release o f microbially utilizable substrates by thermal decomposition of refractory kerogens that otherwise appear resistant to microbial consumption. Thermodynamic modeling can then reveal the actual amounts of energy available and necessary to maintain microbial metabolism (e.g., Hoehler, 2004; Wang et al., 2010; Bethke et al., 2011). The advancement of scientific technologies over the past 1 5 years has already been shown in part by Expedition 337, which revealed the presence of indigenous microbial cells with concentrations ranging from $^{<10}$ to ${\sim}10^{4}\,\mathrm{cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ down to ${\sim}2500$ mbsf in th e northwestern Pacific off the Shimokita Peninsula, Japan (Inagaki e t al., 2015).  

Driven by the recent technological progress in the deep biosphere exploration, Expedition 370 aimed to  

• Understand the factors that control biomass, activity, and diversity of microbial communities in a subseafloor environment where temperatures increase from ${\sim}2^{\circ}C$ at the sediment/water interface to ${\sim}110^{\circ}{-}130^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at the sediment/basement interface and thus likely encompasses the biotic–abiotic transition zone and • Determine geochemical, geophysical, and hydrogeological characteristics in sediments and the underlying basaltic basement  

and determine if the supply of fluids containing thermogenic and/or geogenic nutrient and energy substrates may support subseafloor microbial communities in the Nankai accretionary complex.  

Previous drilling operations have shown that it is challenging t o penetrate the geological formation along the Muroto Transect. Therefore, Expedition 370 employed a conservative drilling approach that allowed for the installation of multiple casings in orde r to create stable hole conditions for reaching the basement and establishing a long-term temperature observatory.  

The operational plan was guided by three major objectives:  

1. Recovery of high-quality cores from critical temperature intervals of the sedimentary sequence accompanied by monitoring of drilling-induced contamination and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) during laboratory procedures. High sample quality and careful contamination controls are prerequisites for investigating the presence (or absence) of life at the lower boundary of the subseafloor biosphere.   
2. Recovery of basement core samples to investigate heat and fluid flow in the subducting oceanic crust and thus the potential introduction of basement-derived microbes, nutrients, and electron donors/acceptors into the overlying sediment column.   
3. Precise and accurate measurement of in situ temperatures. Temperature information is essential not only for delineating the impact of temperature on subseafloor life but also for characterizing the heat and fluid flow regime within the Nankai Trough subduction zone. Therefore, in situ temperatures were determined by downhole measurements during drilling as well as by completion of the borehole as an observatory and deployment of thermistor arrays, which will record temperatures in critical temperature intervals for an extended time.  

The precise determination of the temperature limit of the dee p subseafloor biosphere requires the highest possible sensitivity fo r the detection of microbial life. In order to fully exploit the technological potential available to date, the scientific work program o n board the D/V Chikyu was complemented by simultaneous work a t the Kochi Core Center (KCC), which is located within reach of a helicopter shuttle for transportation of freshly cored samples. The investigation of microbial communities and processes close to th e limits of the subseafloor biosphere benefited in particular from super-clean facilities, aseptic core sampling techniques, and the stateof-the-art analytical infrastructure at KCC. Scientists on board th e Chikyu and at KCC processed samples, shared data, and reporte d results together as one “IODP Expedition 370 Scientists” team, according to IODP policies.  

# Background  

Geological setting  

Located east of Japan between the Shikoku Basin and the Southwest Japan arc, the Nankai Trough marks the subduction boundar y between the young, hot Philippine Sea plate and the Eurasian plat e (Figure F1). Subduction of the Shikoku Basin occurs at a curren t rate of ${\sim}2{-}4\,\mathrm{cm/y}$ (Seno et al., 1993). With a maximum water dept h of $4900\;\mathrm{m}$ , the Nankai Trough is relatively shallow, mainly because  a thick sediment pile consisting of turbidite layers on top of hemipelagic basin sediment accumulated on the young $\left({\sim}16\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ basalti c basement (Taira, Hill, Firth, et al., 1991; Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al.,  

2001; Mikada, Becker, Moore, Klaus, et al., 2002). Because of th e high flux of terrigenous sediment from the arc to the trench, th e Nankai Trough has formed a thick, clastic-dominated accretionar y prism over the last ${\sim}5$ My (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001a). A s the accreted materials are lithified by physical and geochemical processes, the prism accumulates strain energy that is eventually released by seismic activity with a frequency of about one grea t earthquake every $\mathord{\sim}180$ years during historic times (Ando, 1975).  

The Nankai Trough has been investigated intensively throughout the history of scientific ocean drilling. Deep Sea Drilling Projec t Legs 31 and 87 drilled off Cape Ashizuri to better understand initial mountain building processes (Figure F1) (Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 1975a, 1975b; Coulbourn, 1986). Legs 131, 190, and 196 continued these studies with a stronger emphasis on the role of dewatering and fluid flow in the consolidation and deformation o f sediment off Cape Muroto where the fault and décollement zone a t ${<}1000$ mbsf are within reach of riserless drilling technology. Six site s were established along the Muroto Transect (Figure F1), coverin g undeformed to highly deformed zones of the accretionary pris m (Taira, Hill, Firth, et al., 1991; Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001; Mikada, Becker, Moore, Klaus, et al., 2002). During the past decade, the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE ) has investigated this subduction zone with a multidisciplinary an d multiphase drilling, sampling, and monitoring program to bette r understand the plate boundary fault system that has historicall y produced gigantic earthquakes and tsunamis. About $200~\mathrm{km}$ nort h of the Muroto Transect, NanTroSEIZE established 13 drilling site s along the Kumano Transect off the Kii Peninsula where the plat e boundary fault system is within reach of the Chikyu’s riser drillin g technology. In the course of numerous seismic and bathymetric surveys, the structure of the Nankai Trough off Shikoku was image d extensively (e.g., Aoki et al., 1982; Ashi and Taira, 1992; Costa Pisan i et al., 2005; Karig, 1986; Kodaira et al., 2000; Le Pichon et al., 1987; Moore et al., 1990, 1991; Okino and Kato, 1995; Park et al., 1999, 2000; Stoffa et al., 1992; Taira and Ashi, 1993). A large volume o f 3-D seismic reflection data was acquired in 1999 (R/V Ewing Cruis e 9907/8) in an effort to image the décollement from the trench int o the seismogenic zone (e.g., Bangs et al., 1999, 2004; Bangs and Gulick, 2005; Gulick et al., 2004).  

For elucidating the temperature limit of the deep subseafloo r biosphere, the Muroto Transect is more suitable than the Kuman o Transect, as the deeply buried sediment is exposed to higher temperatures. Expedition 370 established Site C0023 in the vicinity o f Sites 808 and 1174 (Figures F3, F4) in the protothrust zone of th e accretionary prism (Figure F5), where ${\sim}16$ Ma basaltic basement i s covered with the following series of sediment types (Figure F6): volcaniclastic facies, lower Shikoku Basin facies (hemipelagic mudstone), upper Shikoku Basin facies (hemipelagic mudstone wit h abundant volcanic ash layers), basin-to-trench transition, and oute r and axial trench wedge facies, on top of which, finally, slope apro n facies have been deposited (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001b, 2001c). Site 1174 subsided at a moderate rate of ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m/My}$ durin g the Miocene and the Pliocene, before rates changed dramatically i n the Quaternary. The rate of subsidence rose 12-fold to ${\sim}600~\mathrm{m/My}$ and resulted in a high heating rate of up to 130 K/My (Horsfield e t al., 2006). Deformation bands have developed deeper than 21 8 mbsf, and at 808–840 mbsf a distinct $32\;\mathrm{m}$ thick décollement zon e separates the protothrust domain with fractured and steepene d bedding ( $.<\!807.6$ mbsf) from a relatively little deformed underthrus t section $\mathrm{(>\!840.2\mbsf)}$ ) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001c).

# Heat and fluid flow  

There is compelling evidence for hydrothermal circulation i n the subducting oceanic crust, which leads to elevated heat flux a t the deformation front (Figure F1). Specifically, thermal and geochemical models suggest that advective heat and fluid flow in th e subducting oceanic crust are crucial for extracting and redistributing heat (Harris et al., 2013; Spinelli and Wang, 2008), whereas th e accreted sediment expels fluids mainly by upward diffusive flo w through a large portion of the accretionary prism (Taira, Hill, Firth, et al., 1991; Taira et al., 1992). Pore water profiles did not clearly indicate active fluid flow along the décollement or along the frontal thrust, and fractures within the décollement zone were found to b e not mineralized (Taira, Hill, Firth, et al., 1991; Maltman et al., 1992; Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001); however, at ${>}400{-}500$ mbsf, por e water freshening is detectable in $C1^{-}$ concentrations that are lowe r than seawater values (cf. Kastner et al., 1993). The observed freshening is partly explained by in situ diagenesis (i.e., compaction an d thermally driven smectite dehydration) but also suggests some episodic lateral fluid flow along one or more sediment horizon s (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001; Saffer and Bekins, 1998; Underwood et al., 1993).  

Sites 1174 and C0023 are located in a zone of high heat flow tha t encompasses the trench and the lowermost part of the prism (Figure F1). The surface heat flux consistently exceeds $100\ \mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ i n this region and amounts to ${\sim}180~\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ at Site 1174 but steepl y declines landward of the deformation front to values of ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ and scatters largely around $82\,\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ seaward in the Shikoku Basi n (Yamano et al., 1984; Kinoshita and Yamano, 1986; Shipboard Scientific Party, 1991, 2001b, 2001c; Spinelli and Underwood, 2005; Harris et al., 2013; Yamano et al., 1992). Based on available heat flo w data, the heat flow was expected to be $156~\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ at Site C0023, and in situ temperatures were estimated to reach ${\sim}110^{\circ}{-}130^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ a t the sediment/basement interface (Hinrichs et al., 2016).  

# Physical properties  

Measurements of physical properties in sediment and basemen t rock, particularly their variations with depth, are a major target i n studies of rock mechanics and fault zone seismogenesis. With increasing temperature and pressure, physicochemical alteration is facilitated,  causing  lithification  and  diagenesis  of  the  sedimen t (Moore and Saffer, 2001). These processes modify the compositio n of the fault gouge and result in authigenic growth of clay mineral s (e.g., Chester et al., 1993; Wintsch et al., 1995), which are known t o have profound effects on fault strength and potential instabilit y (e.g., Byerlee and Summers, 1975; Ikari et al., 2009). In particular, the smectite-to-illite reaction, which is typically observed at $60^{\circ}-$ $150^{\circ}C$ (i.e., temperatures typical of the updip seismicity limi t [Vrolijk, 1990]), releases fluids and silica into the pore space. Released silica acts as a cementing agent (Towe, 1962; Spinelli et al., 2007) and thus strengthens the frictional properties of the material s (e.g., Mair and Marone, 1999) while lowering their effective porosit y (Spinelli et al., 2007). At the same time, the release of mineral-derived water from desorption and clay mineral transformation reactions into an environment in which precipitation has decrease d porosity may cause high pore pressure and subsequent hydrofracturing of the rock (Behrmann, 1991). Elevated pressures and temperatures typical of upper seismogenic zones are also known t o enhance porosity loss in sediment (Hüpers and Kopf, 2009) and ar e associated with decreases in permeability. The result is a dense, cemented rock that differs substantially from homogeneous sedimen t and may thus impose additional limits to the deep subseafloor biosphere.  

# Microbiology and geochemistry  

Whereas previous investigations focused on the dynamics of deformation and fluid flow processes in the accretionary prism, th e abundance of microbial cells in sediment was determined by shipboard cell counting (Figure F2), and the geochemistry of sedimen t and its interstitial water were characterized as well (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001). At Site 1174, cell concentrations were in a rang e typical for continental margin sediment but decreased to levels below the MQL deeper than $\mathord{\sim}600$ mbsf, where the estimated in sit u temperature exceeds ${\sim}70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Interestingly, cell counts exceeded th e MQL again in deeper sediment just above the décollement aroun d 800 mbsf where temperatures reached $90^{\circ}{C}_{i}$ no cell detection wa s reported at greater depth.  

At Site 1174, organic carbon contents ranged from $0.03\%$ t o $0.84\%$ and overall decreased with depth (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001). In particular, the transition from upper to lower Shikoku Basin facies corresponded to a drop in total organic carbon (TOC ) content. Carbon/nitrogen ratios $^{<10}$ indicated predominantly marine organic matter sources. Pore water sulfate was consumed rapidly in surface sediment and a shallow sulfate–methane transitio n zone (SMTZ) was found at $3{-}6\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , but sulfate concentrations increased again throughout the ${\sim}490\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick lower Shikoku Basi n sediment and linear concentration gradients were consistent wit h diffusive flux of sulfate from the oceanic basement into the overlying sediment (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001b, 2001c; Horsfield e t al., 2006). Methane concentrations were highest at 300–660 mbs f $({\sim}60^{\circ}{-}100^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and remained relatively high in the presence of sulfat e deeper than 660 mbsf (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001c). Ethan e concentrations increased with depth and pointed to thermogeni c sources deeper than 900 mbsf (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2001b, 2001c; Horsfield et al., 2006). These observations agree well wit h findings at adjacent Site 808, where the stable carbon and hydroge n isotopic composition of methane points to microbial $C O_{2}$ reductio n as the major methane source in sediment between 20 and 1000 mbs f and to an increasing contribution of thermogenic methane a t greater depth (Berner and Faber, 1993). Results of Rock-Eval pyrolysis revealed significant thermal transformation of organic matte r deeper than 500 mbsf, suggesting in situ production of hydrocarbo n gases, hydrogen, and oxygenated low–molecular weight compounds (Horsfield et al., 2006). Yet, the interplay of thermogeni c and biogenic processes and their relevance for the supply of metabolic energy and substrates remain to be explored.  

# Scientific objectives and hypotheses  

Expedition 370 was primarily motivated by Challenge 6 in th e IODP Science Plan (http://www.iodp.org/about-iodp/iodp-science-plan-2013-2023) “What are the limits of life in the subseafloor?” and by Challenge 5 “What are the origin, composition, an d global significance of subseafloor communities?”  

The overarching scientific objectives of Expedition 370 were a s follows.  

1. Study subseafloor sedimentary microbial communities situated in temperature ranges that cover the putative temperature limit of microbial life in anoxic sedimentary systems.  

We aimed to test the hypothesis that temperature increase wit h depth is accompanied by substantial changes in the composition, function, and activity of microbial communities and that their population density decreases gradually rather than abruptly as suggested by previous examination of Site 1174. Using state-of-the-ar t microbiological and geochemical techniques, samples obtaine d during Expedition 370 can provide a far more comprehensive vie w of the relationship between microbial communities and temperature than was possible during Leg 190.  

2. Characterize the chemical and physical environment in sediment and basement rock at the limit of the deep subseafloor biosphere.  

We aimed to test the hypothesis that the cored sections harbo r biotic–abiotic transition zones and that unique geochemical an d microbial signatures can be identified within the sediment, rock, and fluid matrixes that differentiate the biotic and abiotic realm s and/or their transitions. Samples obtained during Expedition 37 0 will be investigated in detail with respect to (bio)chemical, isotopic, mineralogical, and physical properties and changes thereof.  

3. Examine the relationship between thermogenic release of potential substrates and microbial life.  

Expedition 370 aimed to obtain samples to test existing hypotheses (Horsfield et al., 2006; Parkes et al., 2007) that predict stimulation of microbial activity by thermal decomposition of organi c matter. To that end, we will conduct studies of genes, their expression,  cultivation-dependent  and  -independent  assays,  biogeochemical  activity  measurements,  and  advanced  organi c geochemical analyses that specifically target potential substrates fo r microbial life, as well as document structural modifications of macromolecular organic matter induced by their release.  

In addition, Expedition 370 retrieved samples to specifically address the following questions:  

• Do subseafloor sedimentary microbial communities populate sediments that lie within the temperature range close to the putative limit of microbial life?  

• Is the temperature increase with depth accompanied by substantial changes in the composition, function, and activity of microbial communities?   
• Does the population density of microbial communities decrease gradually or abruptly with increasing temperature? And do features like porosity or fluid movement and the introduction of electron acceptors influence the location of the limit to life such that it “flickers out” over a certain depth range rather than “blinks out abruptly” at a specific depth? For example, is microbial activity stimulated by fluid flow regimes?   
• Are microbial spores abundant in sediment, and do they germinate when temperatures increase with sediment burial?   
• Which microorganisms and processes occur in the deep and hot SMTZ?   
• What is the virus distribution in sediments? Are there any hostfree viruses in the lifeless (i.e., no prokaryotic cells) zone? And what is the functional role of viruses with regard to the genetic evolution of subseafloor microbial ecosystems?  

Characterizing the chemical and physical environment in sediment and basement rock at the limit of the deep subseafloor biosphere will allow us to address questions such as  

• Which mechanisms guide the selection of microorganisms at elevated temperatures?   
• Are there other adaptations evident in cells present at the bottom of the deep biosphere besides tolerance to high temperatures?   
• Do pairs of electron acceptors and donors accumulate that would normally be consumed by biologically mediated redox reactions?   
• Is there a measurable impact of smectite–illite reaction on subseafloor microbial communities?   
• Does the presumed availability of electron acceptor–rich fluids in the basement stimulate microbial activity in the overlying sediment? If there are active (or survived) microbial communities in the high-temperature basaltic habitat, is there evidence for the inoculation of overlying sediment with basement-derived microbes?   
• What is the extent and distribution of hydrothermal veining and crustal alteration related to circulation of basement fluids? How much of this alteration may be related to microbial activity? How large are heat and fluid flow in the subducting oceanic crust?  

Elucidating the temperature limit of the deep subseafloor biosphere and biogeochemical processes occurring at the biotic–abiotic transition zone(s) require the highest possible sensitivity for th e reliable detection of indigenous microbial life. Therefore, QA an d QC were key objectives throughout drilling operations and all subsequent sample handling procedures in the laboratory. Moreover, precise and accurate information on in situ temperatures is essentia l not only for delineating the impact of temperature on subseafloo r life but also for characterizing the heat and fluid flow regime withi n the Nankai Trough subduction zone. Therefore, measurements o f formation temperatures in situ and of thermal conductivity of th e cored material were crucial objectives of Expedition 370. An initial set of in situ temperature data was obtained by downhole measurements during drilling. In addition, we aimed to prepare the borehol e for its future use as a long-term observatory by installing casing,  a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) landing platform, and a COR K head, as well as temperature sensors.  

# Site C0023 summary  

Site C0023 $32^{\circ}22.00^{\prime}\mathrm{N}$ , $134^{\circ}57.98^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; $4776\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth) wa s established on 17 September 2016 in the vicinity of Sites 1174 an d 808 (Figure F4). After stabilizing Hole C0023A with a 20 inch drillin casing to 181 mbsf, 83 cores were taken from 189 to 871 mbsf.  A spot-coring approach employing a short advance modified hydraulic piston coring system (short HPCS) equipped with an advance d piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) for in situ temperatur e measurements was successfully used for the first time to 410.5 mbsf. Deeper, continuous rotary core barrel (RCB) coring followed. Du e to deteriorating borehole conditions, a second casing $13\%$ inch ) was considered necessary on 11 October and installed to 858 mbsf. RCB coring resumed on 25 October and continued until basemen t was reached on 3 November. Coring terminated with the recover y of Core 370-C0023A-112R from a total drilling depth of 1180 mbsf. Recovery was $75.9\%$ on average and yielded altogether $577.85\mathrm{~m~}$ o f core (Tables T1, T2). During the expedition, more than 13,000 samples were taken from these cores and preserved for shipboard an d shore-based analyses as well as for the postexpedition research o f more than 90 individual scientists who requested samples from Sit e C0023.  

To ensure the best sample quality, we employed a multistep procedure to remove the potentially contaminated part of the cores. All samples for time-, oxygen-, and contamination-sensitive microbiological and biogeochemical investigations were taken in the form o f whole-round cores (WRCs) from the most undisturbed parts o f freshly retrieved core sections, which were identified by careful visual inspection using X-ray computed tomography (CT) imag e scans. Core intervals with obvious fractures and/or drilling disturbances were strictly avoided, as such structures might provide pathways for the introduction of contamination into the interior of th e core. The outer layer of the WRCs was removed immediately afte r retrieval to avoid potential intrusion of contaminants from drillin g fluid. Whole-round sampling was completed as soon as possible, usually within a few hours after a core had arrived on deck. Sample s for oxygen-sensitive analyses were processed under anaerobic conditions. For microbiological samples, a super-clean and anaerobi c working environment was established by installing a tabletop air filtration unit and ionizer (i.e., static eliminator) inside an anaerobi c chamber, preventing potential sample contamination by laborator y air. In order to avoid alteration of samples and loss of informatio n during storage, in-depth investigations were started as soon as possible after core recovery. To this end, the carefully cleaned and anaerobically packed samples were transported to shore by helicopte r shuttle, where they were processed without delay by the shorebased team of expedition scientists at KCC. A total of 92 boxes wit h high-priority samples were transferred to shore by helicopter on a n almost daily basis. At KCC, precleaned core samples were carefull y treated in a timely manner for further removal of potentially contaminated surface at either a dust-free super-clean room that meet s International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Class 1 clea n room standards, an all air exhaust clean bench, or a tabletop air filtration system–equipped anaerobic chamber with monitoring fo r airborne particles and microbial cells.

On-site operations were completed on 9 November 2016 wit h the installation of a borehole observatory for long-term in situ temperature measurements to 863 mbsf. The observatory was equippe d with an ROV landing platform and a CORK head and was instrumented with thermistor arrays to 863 mbsf. Thermistors monito r temperature mainly inside the cased borehole at 13 depth horizon s (Table T3), and data are recorded continuously by data logger s mounted in the CORK head. Recovery of the data by ROV i s planned for March 2018, using the Japan Agency for Marine-Eart h Science and Technology research vessel Kairei and the ROV Kaiko.  

The shore-based research program of Expedition 370 at KC C ended on 23 November 2016. By this time, all samples had bee n cleaned a second time and prepared for further analyses under super-clean conditions. A first set of analyses was completed on selected samples, including cell counts and taxonomic composition o f microbial communities. In addition, incubation experiments unde r high-pressure and high-temperature conditions were started to investigate potential microbial activity.  

From an operational point of view, Expedition 370 was successful overall. We carried out nearly all planned operations, establishe d a robust temperature model based on downhole measurements an d thermal conductivity data, and conducted all sampling and scientific analyses with an unprecedented high level of QA/QC, precision, and accuracy. With respect to expedition logistics, the smoot h

operations for the transfer of cored samples from ship to shore, th e close collaboration of shipboard and shore-based expedition scientists, and the successful preparation of Expedition 370 with a shor t lead time of less than 6 months are worth mentioning. Shipboar d results for Site C0023 indicate a heat flow of $140\ \mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ and temperature of about $120^{\circ}{C}$ at the sediment/basement interface, corroborating  the  suitability  of  the  environmental  setting  fo r addressing research questions as planned.  

Preliminary cell count data suggest that cell concentrations ar e notably lower than those previously reported at Site 1174 but at th e same time point to the presence of intact microbial cells in lo w abundance to at least 850 mbsf. Therefore, the obtained sample s and data provide an excellent basis for extensive microbiological, biogeochemical, geological, and geophysical analyses in postexpedition research projects that will potentially provide new insight s into the effects of temperature on biological, geochemical, and geophysical processes in the deep subseafloor at Site C0023. Achievin g our expedition objectives will significantly expand our knowledge o f the factors that limit subseafloor microbial ecosystems at the biotic–abiotic transition zone and ultimately shed more light on th e extent and evolutionary nature of the deep subseafloor biospher e on Earth and, more generally, on the habitability of planets.  

Although most expedition goals were met, some remain unfulfilled for now but could still be reached during a future return t o Hole C0023A. Although the basaltic basement was reached wit h Cores 111R and 112R, recovery was insufficient to address all related research questions, mainly due to the time constraint. Becaus e of the challenging geological formation, unstable borehole conditions were a major concern throughout the expedition. This fact le d us to the decision to set the thermistor array only $5\;\mathrm{m}$ deep into th e naked hole below the second casing at 858 mbsf. Finally, althoug h thermistor sensor strings with flatpackers were successfully installed during borehole completion, an additional array of miniatur e temperature loggers was not properly set in the borehole. The underlying reasons for the unsuccessful installation remain to be clarified as of the writing of this report.  

we provide principal results according to discipline, followed by  a synthesis of currently available information pertaining to our scientific objectives.  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Our study site was selected based on previous observations a t Sites 1174 and 808, and Site C0023 was established in the closes t possible proximity. We found close similarities as well as distinc t differences between the new site and the former. In the following,  

At Site C0023, we recognize four main lithostratigraphic unit s (Figure F7) that were described before in the lithostratigraphi c framework for the Muroto Transect (Taira, Hill, Firth, et al., 1991; Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001). Near-surface sediment constitute s facies associated with a trench-style deposition. Lithologies includ e hemipelagic and pelagic mud and mudstone and turbidite-deposited mud, mudstone, silt, and sand. Within this group, we differentiate Subunit IIA (189–318.5 mbsf) that has a higher proportion o f sand (axial trench wedge) and Subunit IIB (353–428 mbsf) that ha s a higher proportion of mud (outer trench wedge facies). We als o recognize a third subunit that is transitional between the trench - and volcaniclastic basin–style deposition (Subunit IIC; 428–49 4 mbsf). This transitional unit evidences some deposition of sand an d silt from episodic turbidity currents and some deposition of tuff s and volcaniclastic sediment, also typically from currents. However, mixtures of mud and volcaniclastic sand at Site C0023 only occu r because of bioturbation mixing the tops of tuff beds into overlyin g mud. A solely basin-style deposition is found in Unit III (uppe r Shikoku Basin facies; 494–637.25 mbsf), and siliciclastic turbidite s can no longer be identified. Tuffs and tuffaceous sedimentary rock s constitute ${<}8\%$ of the unit’s net thickness but have unique petrophysical and geochemical characteristics that are described later. Unit IV (lower Shikoku Basin facies; 637.25–1112 mbsf) comprise s volcaniclastics-bearing mudstones that are heavily bioturbated. This latter aspect creates heterogeneity by concentrating ash, shell y bioclasts, and silt, leading to a distinct fabric that creates a templat e that acts as a focus for strata-bound hydrothermal mineralization. Unit V (acidic volcaniclastic facies; 1112–1125.9 mbsf) is the deepest unit and comprises mudstones and felsic ash, which is less indurated than overlying tuff beds in Subunit IIC and Unit III. A unit o f hyaloclastites forms the lithologic basement for Site C0023.  

# Structural geology  

Bedding planes dip gently, but abrupt changes to steeper dip s are observed in the lower Shikoku Basin. Eventually, dip return s back to gentle stratigraphic dips in lithostratigraphic Unit V. Several kinds of deformation structures are distributed at particular depths. Most of the core-scale reverse faults are located above and withi n the décollement zone (\~758–796 mbsf; see Décollement, below), whereas dense populations of normal faults were identified beneat h the décollement zone (i.e., underthrust sediment). Mineral vein s composed of calcite, barite, and anhydrite occur beneath the décollement zone, and most of these are located within or closely associated with faults. Core-scale healed faults that mostly represent  a normal fault sense are typically present in the upper Shikoku Basin.  

Variations in bedding dip and healed fault distribution at Sit e C0023 are broadly similar to those at Site 1174. On the other hand, the thicknesses of fault zones within the décollement zone and th e nature and distribution of deformation structures in the underthrust sediments at Site C0023 are totally different from Sites 80 8 and 1174: at Site C0023, the décollement zone is characterized by  a thinner fault zone sandwiched between intact mud rock layers, an d a dense population of faults and mineral veins is present in th e underthrust interval.  

![](images/6196ef1b65d680206d0c52fe6d5d8da359aac906a23fa2a1042a42e6869ce72d.jpg)  
Décollement  

The onset of the first major fault at 758.15 mbsf was interprete d to mark the top of the décollement zone. Bedding is slightly steepened in the zone $(\mathrm{\sim}30^{\circ})$ . Below this décollement zone, the fault zon e is underlain by generally intact sediment with gentle dips. Althoug h some fault zones were identified in Cores 65R through 71R, most o f the recovered cores represent intact surfaces. Therefore, the décollement zone at Site C0023 appears to be composed of alternatin g intact intervals (approximately several meters in thickness) an d thinner fault zones. No thrust fault zone was identified deeper tha n 796.395 mbsf, and thus this potentially marks the base of the décollement zone.  

# Authigenic and hydrothermal mineralization  

We recognize five main styles of diagenetic and hydrotherma l mineralization at Site C0023. At shallow depths from $\mathord{\sim}200$ to ${\sim}700$ mbsf, the main authigenic mineralization involves carbonate precipitation and pyritization. This is typically strata bound and ca n impart significant physical and chemical characteristics to bed s (e.g., cementing and causing the early lithification of shallow mudstones or precipitating porosity reducing cements). Clay mineralization occurs from ${\sim}700$ to $\mathord{\sim}1000$ mbsf and primarily takes th e form of smectite and chlorite mineral phases. Such mineralizatio n is typically strata bound and can involve the precipitation of ne w mineral phases but typically involves the alteration of host lithology. A notable locus for clay mineralization is the décollement zone an d  

Unit V. Manganese and sulfate mineralization is focused betwee n ${\sim}700$ and 1100 mbsf. Sulfate mineralization (anhydrite and barite) i s heavily associated with veins but is also strata bound and, when sufficiently pervasive, overprints the existing depositional fabric and i s also associated with carbonate mineralization. Manganese mineralization is typically strata bound and largely replacive or pore fillin g and is typically centered on burrows and takes the form of rhodochrosite. Ferrous iron mineralization is found in both Unit V an d the lithologic basement. Temperature estimation is hard to constrain at this point, but both the presence of anhydrite and veins o f barite and the occurrence of largely stratiform rhodochrosite ma y indicate temperatures in the $120^{\circ}{-}200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ range. Although alteratio n processes are observed within the décollement zone, overall, the y are not of greater magnitude than alteration processes observed a t other zones and depths.  

# Physical properties  

Shipboard physical property measurements, including moistur e and density, thermal conductivity, electrical resistivity, $P$ -wave velocity, natural gamma radiation, and magnetic susceptibility, wer e performed on core samples from 204 to 1176 mbsf under roo m temperature and pressure conditions.  

Porosities through the wedge facies (Unit II) to the uppe r Shikoku Basin facies (Unit III) are characterized by high variabilit y and generally decrease with increasing depth (Figure F7). The lowe r porosity values represent sand and silty sand at the interval fro m 200 to 300 mbsf in Subunit IIA, whereas the higher values correlat e with tuff and tuffaceous sediment in Unit III. A high-velocity interval between 620 and 640 mbsf at the base of Unit III corresponds t o tuffaceous sediments, although bulk densities of the sediments ar e lower than surroundings. Within the lower Shikoku Basin facie s (Unit IV), porosities continue to decrease with depth to the top o f the décollement zone at $\mathord{\sim}760$ mbsf. However, deeper than 76 0 mbsf, they begin to increase gradually by $5\%-7\%$ with depth to ${\sim}830$ mbsf. This porosity increase is accompanied by a decrease in $P$ - wave velocity and apparent formation factor (i.e., electrical resistivity). Deeper than ${\sim}830$ mbsf, porosities resume a general compaction trend to the base of Unit IV and then rapidly increase withi n Unit V, where tuffaceous mud becomes the dominant lithology. Basaltic rocks in the basement exhibit a range of porosity betwee n $5.5\%$ and $25\%$ . Similar porosity depth profiles were reported at Site s 808 and 1174 (Taira, Hill, Firth, et al., 1991; Moore, Taira, Klaus, e t al., 2001). However, it is a marked contrast at Site C0023 that porosities  start  increasing  gradually  within  the  décollement  zone, whereas sharp increase curves in porosity were observed at the bas e of the décollement zones at Sites 808 and 1174.  

In situ temperature measurements between 189 and 408 mbs f and laboratory thermal conductivity measurements indicate a hea t flow of $140\;\mathrm{mW}/\mathrm{m}^{2}$ . Assuming that the heat flow is purely conductive and steady state, temperatures of $86^{\circ}$ and $120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ are projecte d for the top of the décollement and the bottom of the hole, respectively (Figure F7).  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

An extensive suite of interstitial water chemical analyses wa s performed at Site C0023 to identify potential microbial activity, quantify rates of various metabolic processes, assess the presence o f active fluid flow, and complement our understanding of sedimen t diagenesis in the protothrust zone of the Nankai Trough subductio n zone off Muroto. High-precision data is required to constrain th e geochemical environment, which is fundamental to our understanding of the microbial habitability of the subseafloor.  

To fulfill the expedition’s principal objectives, we generate d high-quality and high-resolution profiles of microbial metabolite s and other elements involved in geochemical processes throug h high-precision measurement and careful contamination control. The resulting pore water chemistry data set is of unprecedente d quality for samples collected with rotary coring technology. The following chemical species were measured on board: chloride, salinity, sulfate, bromide, total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbo n (DIC), ammonium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, lithium, boron, barium, aluminum, strontium, manganese, iron, silica, sulfide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide.  

Sulfate in the upper $600\;\mathrm{m}$ of the cored formation is assumed t o be below detection in situ (measured values are used to determin e the extent of contamination of the samples) (Figure F8) and the n generally increases with depth. The lower SMTZ at Site C0023 occurs relatively deep (between 630 and $750~\mathrm{mbsf}$ ). Complementin g the sedimentological identification of the décollement, a sulfate offset of $2.5\,\mathrm{\mM}$ occurs at 770 mbsf. Starting at 970 mbsf, sulfat e sharply decreases by $3~\mathrm{mM}$ to a low-concentration interval withi n the lowermost ${100}\;\mathrm{m}$ of the formation. The deep sulfate maximu m could be relict and/or originate from fluid advection; future wor k will be required to distinguish between these potential sources.  

TA and DIC are similar for the upper $600\;\mathrm{m}$ of the cored formation. In contrast to what we would expect if TA was dominated b y carbonate alkalinity, TA and DIC diverge at 600 mbsf. TA sharpl y increases from approximately 4 to $20\,\mathrm{\mM_{\mathrm{)}}}$ , peaking at $670\ \mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{}}$ , whereas DIC remains low and decreases to a minimum of $0.8\:\mathrm{mM}$ a t 700 mbsf. An offset in DIC (a $3~\mathrm{mM}$ increase) occurs at 850 mbsf. Following the TA peak at $670\,\mathrm{\mbsf},$ alkalinity decreases to th e décollement before resuming a similar pattern to DIC and smoothl y decreasing to the basement. Based on the lack of similarity betwee n DIC and alkalinity profiles in the 600–800 mbsf interval and the detailed analysis of titration curves, we infer that the bulk of the hig h alkalinity is not derived from the carbonate system but related t o the presence of abundant low molecular weight fatty acids.  

There  are  peaks  in  dissolved  Mn  and  Fe  concentration s throughout Units II and III, coinciding with the occurrence of volcanic ash layers. This might indicate the use of Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides  as  electron  acceptors  for  microbial  organic  matte r degradation. As these intervals are considered sulfate- and sulfidefree, dissolution of Fe and Mn oxides due to anaerobic sulfide oxidation seems unlikely. Dissolved sulfide is low $(<\!2\!\upmu\mathrm{M})$ in Unit IV, especially around the décollement and at ${\sim}930$ mbsf. There is n o indication for dissolved sulfide in the center of the SMTZ. However, its absence in pore water could potentially be due to a balance between dissolved Fe and sulfide production, which would result i n the reaction of these components to solid phase iron sulfides. Hig h manganese concentrations in Unit IV indicate an input by hydrothermal fluids or relict microbial manganese reduction.

# Organic geochemistry  

Overall concentrations of calcium carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ , TOC, nitrogen, and sulfur at Site C0023 are low in all lithostratigraphi c units. The $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ profile exhibits a large degree of scatter (rangin g from 0.07 to $22\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) from 430 mbsf to the basement (1176.6 mbsf), apart from a carbonate-poor interval between 830 and 945 mbs f (middle of Unit IV), in which $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents are tightly clustere d around $0.61\pm0.41\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ (mean $\pm$ standard deviation [SD]). The heterogeneity in the $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ data reflects variations in calcite cementation and the presence of calcite veins in the basalt. Low amounts o f calcite cementation observed in the carbonate-poor interval ar e likely responsible for the low $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ contents there. TOC monotonically decreases from the top of the cored interval (Subunit IIA, 190 mbsf, $0.5~\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) to the décollement (\~760 mbsf, ${\sim}0.2\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Between the décollement and the lower part of Unit IV (1050 mbsf), TOC is roughly constant at $0.25~\pm~0.04~\mathrm{{\wt}\%}$ before decreasin g sharply to minimum values below $0.02\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ within Unit V. Total nitrogen and sulfur contents are very low throughout Hole C0023 A with average values of $0.05\pm0.01$ and $0.15\pm0.11\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively. Low TOC/N ratios of $5.8\pm2.1$ on average are consistent with a predominantly marine source of the organic material.  

Dissolved hydrocarbon gases were analyzed from whole-roun d sections situated adjacent or in close proximity to samples taken fo r interstitial water analysis. Methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , $_n$ -butane $\left(n\!-\!C_{4}\right)$ , and $i$ -butane $\left(i\!-\!C_{4}\right)$ were detected within all lithostratigraphic units with varying abundances. Methane concentrations show a large scatter in Subunits IIA–IIC, ranging between 0. 5 and $11.8\;\mathrm{mM}$ and reaching the highest average values of $7\pm2\mathrm{\mM}$ within Unit III (Figure F9). This apparent peak in methane withi n Subunit IIC and Unit III coincides with elevated concentrations o f propane and $_i$ -butane relative to the other ${\mathsf{C}}_{1}{-}{\mathsf{C}}_{4}$ hydrocarbons. I n this interval, molar concentrations of $C_{3}$ and $i{\mathrm{-}}C_{4}$ are higher tha n those of $C_{2}$ and $n\mathrm{-}C_{4},$ respectively. High molar ratios of methan e over ethane $\left({\mathsf{C}_{1}}/{\mathsf{C}_{2}}>10^{3}\right)$ within Subunits IIA–IIC and Unit III ar e consistent with a dominance of microbially generated methane occurring in these depths. Concentrations of methane decline belo w Unit III to minimum values of ${\sim}0.3\,\mathrm{\mM}$ within the décollement. This decrease in methane is accompanied by a steady decrease o f $C_{1}/C_{2}$ to values around $10^{2}$ within the décollement. The decline i n methane between 660 and 758 mbsf is negatively correlated wit h concentrations of sulfate, suggesting the presence of an activ e SMTZ within the upper part of Unit IV above the décollement. Th e $C_{2+}$ hydrocarbon gases also exhibit low concentrations shortl y above and within the décollement. Elevated concentrations of $C_{2+}$ hydrocarbon gases in the lower part of Unit IV, together with lo w $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios, indicate a zone of thermogenic production of these hydrocarbon gases and/or its fluid/gas flow. Below this zone, concentrations of all hydrocarbon gases, except for methane, decrease.  

# Microbiology  

Minimizing the contamination of potentially extremely low biomass core samples was of highest priority for the microbiological research objectives of Expedition 370. Therefore, rigorous QA/Q C efforts and super-clean technologies were implemented, includin g helicopter transport of freshly taken core samples to the onshore super-clean room facility at KCC. During the expedition, cell count s and DNA-based microbial community fingerprinting were conducted and incubations for probing microbial activity at high-pressure and high-temperature conditions were initiated.  

Airborne particle data showed that QC of sample processin g and the analytical environment was successful thanks to the use o f super-clean technologies. In order to create clean sample handlin g environments, a tabletop air filtration unit (KOACH T 500-F, Koke n

Ltd., Japan) was installed in anaerobic chambers located both on th e Chikyu and at KCC and a clean bench on the Chikyu. At KCC, all o f the analytical work for microbiology was done in a super-clea n room. Ionizers were also installed inside the anaerobic chamber o n the Chikyu and all sample handling environments at KCC to avoi d particle contamination by neutralizing static electricity. The number of airborne particles $(0.3{-}1.0\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in particle size) in the air of th e shipboard working environment was routinely monitored and confirmed to be not detected (ND; ${<}353$ particles $^{\prime}\mathbf{m}^{3}$ ) to $2.2\times10^{4}$ particles/ $\mathrm{\Delta}^{\prime}\mathrm{m}^{3}$ in the clean bench and ND to $1.8\times10^{5}$ particles $'\mathbf{m}^{3}$ in th e anaerobic glove box, whereas the laboratory air on the Chikyu contained $1.12\,\times\,10^{7}\,\pm\,9.46\,\times\,10^{6}$ particles $'\mathbf{m}^{3}$ (mean $\pm\ S\mathrm{D}$ ). At KCC, the vicinity of the work area of the super-clean room was consistently below the detection limit of the particle counter (ND; $<\!117$ particles $/\mathbf{m}^{3},$ ). In the anaerobic chamber with a KOACH air filtration system, counts for particles with a diameter of $0.3–2.5~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ ranged from no particles detected $_{<353}$ particles $^{\prime}\mathbf{m}^{3}$ ) prior to sample processing to a maximum of $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ particles $^{\prime}\mathbf{m}^{3}$ within $5\,\mathrm{{min}}$ after sample processing.  

During Expedition 370, numerous WRC sections and individua l samples were collected for microbiological and molecular biologica l analyses. WRCs for expedition analyses and various postexpeditio n analyses (e.g., cultivation, activity measurements, and environmental genomics) were initially processed in a clean anaerobic chambe r on the Chikyu to remove the exteriors of core samples, which cam e into contact with drilling fluid. After transferring microbiologica l WRCs to KCC, the sample exterior was further scraped prior t o subsampling. This two-step cleaning procedure was important t o avoid possible secondary contamination that might occur durin g

sample processing and improve the level of QC for subsequent microbiological analyses.  

To assess the potential of drilling fluid intrusion into the cor e samples during RCB coring and sample processing, perfluorocarbon (PFC) tracer was added to the drilling fluid stream (Figure F10) . The presence of the PFC tracer was tracked within cores and cor e liner fluid. PFC tracer monitoring during the expedition indicate d that the majority of core interiors contained little to undetectabl e drilling fluid contamination (i.e., for 51 of 117 RCB cores, the interior PFC concentrations were less than the detection limit). Sample s of drilling fluid and drilling fluid components (i.e., seawater, gel, etc.) were stored for cell and virus enumeration as well as postexpedition identification of contaminants by molecular biological analysis. The potential of drilling fluid contamination will be carefully assessed by multiple QAs of contamination tracing.  

Preliminary results of cell detection and enumeration showe d that microbial cell concentrations were distinctly lower than thos e observed at Site 1174 but at the same time suggested that intact microbial cells are present in low abundance to at least 850 mbsf, a t which the estimated temperature is approximately $90^{\circ}C$ (Figur e F11). The complete cell count profile to the sediment/basement interface will be published after ongoing cell enumeration and its validation of data quality. In addition, Expedition 370 provided, for th e first time, morphological views of deep subseafloor microbial cell s in a low-biomass sediment sample using transmission electron microscopy at KCC (Figure F12). Taxonomic compositions of microbial communities were also analyzed by sequencing PCR-amplifie d 16S rRNA genes using a MiSeq platform at KCC. The preliminar y data showed that, even with such an intensive effort to avoid con

tamination, it appears not to be free of signals from potential experimental contaminants; this means that more careful efforts o n additional molecular analyses (e.g., at single cell to community levels in comparison to data from multiple control samples) will b e necessary for low-biomass samples at Site C0023.  

To more fully address some of the primary scientific objectives, incubation experiments of fresh sediment samples for potential microbial activity using stable isotope tracers and high-pressure/temperature incubation systems were initiated at KCC. In addition, various types of microbiological and biogeochemical samples wer e prepared for postexpedition studies, which include samples that wil l be used for molecular (DNA/RNA and lipid) analyses, activity analyses using radioactive tracers, stable isotope probing combined wit h secondary-ion mass spectrometry analysis, quantitative functiona l gene surveys, bioreactor cultivation experiments, probing protei n synthesis activity, population of spore-forming microorganism determinations, exoenzyme activity measurements, and virus coun t and its metagenomic analysis.  

# Accomplishments and future prospectus  

During Expedition 370, our major operational objectives (cf. Hinrichs et al., 2016) were successfully accomplished through shipboard (Chikyu) and onshore (KCC) activities. A large multidisciplinary team was organized for Expedition 370, including biologists, chemists, and geologists, to meet the scientific goals using the lates t knowledge and state-of-the-art analytical technologies. As a result, a total of 112 cores were successfully retrieved by the Chikyu fro m Hole C0023A to the sediment/basement interface at 1180 mbsf a s originally planned, which is the highest number of cores retrieve d by the Chikyu from a single borehole so far and covers almost al l temperature ranges of life up to ${\sim}120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . All cored samples wer e processed through X-ray CT image scanning immediately after recovery, and rigorous QA/QC efforts for microbiological and geochemical samples were conducted, using both shipboard and shorebased super-clean facilities for the first time. The high-quality samples obtained during Expedition 370 will be used for various postexpedition  research  projects,  providing  an  unprecedente d opportunity to fully address important and challenging scientifi c questions regarding the limits of subseafloor life and the biosphere. Intensive geochemical measurements using high-quality WRC sections as well as geological, sedimentological, and physical propert y measurements were conducted on board throughout the core d samples at Site C0023. This multidisciplinary data set is crucial because it provides information on environmental conditions tha t may constrain habitability of subseafloor life and the deep subseafloor biosphere.  

After coring operations, we successfully installed thermisto r sensor strings into the cased borehole to 863 mbsf. A total of 1 3 thermistor sensors deployed on a 4 inch tube will monitor temperature above, within, and below the décollement zone, providing  a long-term record of borehole temperature equivalent to in situ formation. We think that our plan and achievements for the temperature observatory at this particular location are still preliminary an d incomplete; a new implementation of long-term observatory systems, including more sensors and in situ experimental devices fo r not only geophysics but also geochemistry and microbiology, woul d provide another major opportunity for addressing multiple scientific themes and challenges listed in the IODP Science Plan (e.g., biosphere frontiers, Earth connections, and geohazards).  

Conclusively, Expedition 370 has, overall, been successful an d provided an excellent opportunity to tackle important scientifi c questions regarding the limits of life in the deep subseafloor biosphere. The expedition, including shipboard and shore-based activities, was completed on 23 November 2016, but our scientifi c mission to the temperature limit of the deep subseafloor biospher e has just started and will continue over the years at shore-based laboratories with high-quality samples and data retrieved from Sit e C0023.
