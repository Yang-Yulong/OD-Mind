# 1. Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 378 was designed to recover the firs t comprehensive set of Paleogene sedimentary sections from a transect of sites strategically positioned in the South Pacific Ocean to reconstruct key changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation. These sites would have provided an unparalleled opportunity to add crucial new data an d geographic coverage to existing reconstructions of Paleogene climate. Following the ${\sim}15$ mont h postponement of Expedition 378 and subsequent port changes that resulted in a reduction of th e number of primary sites, testing and evaluation of the research vessel JOIDES Resolution derric k in the weeks preceding the expedition determined that it would not support deployment of dril l strings in excess of $2~\mathrm{km}$ . Consequently, only one of the originally approved seven primary site s was drilled.  

Expedition 378 recovered the first continuously cored, multiple-hole Paleogene sedimentary section from the southern Campbell Plateau at Site U1553. This high–southern latitude site builds o n the legacy of Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 277 (a single, partially spot cored hole), providing  a unique opportunity to refine and expand existing reconstructions of Cenozoic climate history.  

As the world’s largest ocean, the Pacific Ocean is intricately linked to major changes in the globa l climate system. Previous drilling in the low-latitude Pacific Ocean during Ocean Drilling Progra m Legs 138 and 199 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 320 and 321 provided ne w insights into climate and carbon system dynamics, productivity changes across the zone of divergence, time-dependent calcium carbonate dissolution, bio- and magnetostratigraphy, the locatio n of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and evolutionary patterns for times of climatic change an d upheaval. Expedition 378 in the South Pacific Ocean uniquely complements this work with a highlatitude perspective, especially because appropriate high-latitude records are unobtainable in th e Northern Hemisphere of the Pacific Ocean.  

Expedition 378 provides material from the South Pacific Ocean in an area critical for high-latitud e climate reconstructions spanning the early Paleocene to late Oligocene. Site U1553 and the entir e corpus of shore-based investigations will significantly contribute to the challenges of the “Climat e and Ocean Change: Reading the Past, Informing the Future” theme of the 2013–2023 IODP Science Plan (How does Earth’s climate system respond to elevated levels of atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ? Ho w resilient is the ocean to chemical perturbations?). Furthermore, Expedition 378 provides materia l from the South Pacific Ocean in an area critical for high-latitude climate reconstructions spannin g the Paleocene to late Oligocene.  

# 2. Introduction  

The South Pacific Paleogene Climate science program originated from International Ocea n Discovery  Program  (IODP)  Proposal  567-Full4  (http://iodp.tamu.edu/scienceops/expeditions/south_pacific_paleogene_climate.html) with the broad goal to investigate the record o f Cenozoic climate and oceanography through a drilling transect in the high-latitude souther n Pacific Ocean. The principal drilling targets include sediments deposited during the very war m late Paleocene and early Eocene, including the Paleocene/Eocene boundary and Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT). These records can help scientists investigate how the Eocene Earth maintained high global temperatures and high heat transport to the polar regions despite receivin g near-modern levels of solar energy input. Investigation of the recovered sediments will provid e critical constraints on the subpolar Pacific Ocean climate, oceanographic structure, and biogeochemical cycling through much of the Cenozoic. New drilling on the southern Campbell Platea u will enable reconstruction of intermediate water compositions in addition to augmenting th e Pacific latitudinal gradient.  

# 3. Background  

# 3.1. Reconstruction of environmental conditions and physical processes in the Paleogene oceans  

Seafloor sediments record the broad outlines of the major features of ocean circulation such a s water mass distributions; regions of steep gradients in temperature, salinity, and biologic productivity; and the distribution of deepwater masses. Surface water provinces are identified by thei r salinity and temperature in the modern ocean. Distinct assemblages of planktonic organisms ar e associated with these provinces; thus, microfossil assemblages of these organisms can be used t o define the geographic extent of water masses in premodern sediments (Fontorbe et al., 2017). Divergence of near-surface water usually supports higher organic productivity, which leaves  a diagnostic geochemical and micropaleontological fingerprint in the underlying sediments. Stee p gradients in the surface ocean are preserved in the records of planktonic microfossil assemblage s and mark regions of vigorous near-surface transport as wind-driven open-ocean and boundar y currents. Winds that drive these currents may be reconstructed through the geochemical composition of the dust from upwind continental areas after accounting for any volcanic ash contributions (e.g., Rea, 1994; Dunlea et al., 2015).  

Present poleward heat transport is divided approximately equally between the atmosphere and th e oceans. Wind-driven currents achieve about half of the ocean heat transport, whereas the balanc e of oceanic heat transport is driven by the overturning circulation. Obviously, all aspects of hea t transport must be defined as well as possible in our effort to better understand ocean circulatio n and the role it plays in times of extremely warm climates. By focusing our efforts on a specific tim e interval in both the previously drilled equatorial and presently proposed subpolar–polar transects, we can advance reconstructions of meridional Eocene heat transfer along with the circulator y response of the ocean and atmosphere.  

# 3.2. Sea-surface temperatures  

One of the primary needs for both atmospheric and oceanic circulation models is robust seasurface temperature (SST) control. SST data form a major boundary condition for constrainin g these models, and SST is the most easily observable signal of circulation patterns. Temperatur e gradients can be measured in a relative sense even if the absolute calibrations are off with respec t to the subantarctic or equatorial region.  

The early Paleogene (66 to ${\sim}34\mathrm{\Ma}$ ) was the most recent geologic interval during which atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels were likely above $\mathord{\sim}1000$ ppm (e.g., Pearson et al., 2009; Pagani et al., 2011; Hönisch et al., 2012; Anagnostou et al., 2016, 2020). Proxy records and models indicate that elevated atmospheric greenhouse gas inventories would have produced higher SSTs (e.g., Inglis et al., 2020).  

Multiproxy reconstructions of SSTs confirm these results (Hollis et al., 2019) and imply that tropical SSTs ranged from ${\sim}34^{\circ}$ to $38\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ at ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Pearson et al., 2007; Huber, 2008), SSTs in the highlatitude South Pacific $(\mathrm{\sim}55^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ ranged from $20^{\circ}$ to $35\mathrm{^\circC}$ (Bijl et al., 2009; Hollis et al., 2012; Pross e t al., 2012; Cramwinckel et al., 2018), and Antarctic/high-latitude SST estimates from Seymou r Island off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula were ${\sim}15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Ivany et al., 2011).  

These SST estimates produce early Paleogene equator-to-pole thermal gradients significantl y lower than those of the modern oceans (e.g., Hollis et al., 2009; Lunt et al., 2012). Fully couple d model simulations using strong radiative greenhouse gas forcing yield seasonal thermal gradient s that are generally consistent with available proxy data (Huber and Caballero, 2011; Hollis et al., 2012; Lunt et al., 2012; Inglis et al., 2020), whereas simulated meridional temperature gradients ar e overemphasized and high-latitude precipitation is typically underestimated (Carmichael et al., 2016).  

# 3.3. Ocean circulation  

Oceanic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is a crucial component of the climate syste m and impacts heat transport, nutrient transport, and global carbon cycling. The operating mode o f the MOC was significantly different during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene (e.g., Thoma s et al., 2014; Hutchinson et al., 2018). In the modern oceans, Antarctica is surrounded by th e world’s strongest ocean current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which flows aroun d Antarctica and reaches from the surface to abyssal depths. The current is sufficiently strong t o cause erosion and sediment transport near its axis at $50^{\circ}{-}55^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (e.g., Goodell et al., 1971; Watkin s and Kennett, 1977; Hollister and Nowell, 1991; Barker and Thomas, 2004). The Drake Passage (o r Drake Isthmus) separated the abyssal South Atlantic from the abyssal South Pacific during muc h of the Paleogene (there was likely a shallow connection via the Trans-Antarctic Seaway prior to th e opening of the Drake Passage), and it is likely that the South Pacific thermohaline structure wa s different from that in the South Atlantic. In the early Paleogene, the Southern Ocean was divide d into Pacific and Atlantic-Indian sectors because Australia and South America were joined to Antarctica. Both Southern Ocean sectors developed a unique subpolar gyre, and the Pacific secto r gyre is known as the proto-Ross Gyre (Huber et al., 2004; Stickley et al., 2004).  

An increasing catalog of water mass proxy data combined with state-of-the-art numerical simulations provides a reconstruction of MOC characterized by convection in the South Pacific as wel l as the North Pacific during the latest Cretaceous through early Paleogene. This reconstruction i s supported by fully coupled Global Circulation Model simulations that indicate the “age” of dee p water in the Pacific Ocean increased from high to low latitudes in both the South and Nort h Pacific (Hague et al., 2012). Neodymium (Nd) isotope records also suggest that the MOC in th e Pacific Ocean was dissimilar and separated from the MOC in the Atlantic Ocean (Thomas et al., 2014).  

The evolution of modern Antarctic circulation began with the formation of deepwater passage s south of Australia (Tasman Gateway) and through the Scotia Arc (Drake Passage). Data fro m Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 189 (Stickley et al., 2004; Bijl et al., 2013) suggest the earlies t throughflow of a westbound ACC began at ${\sim}49{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ through a southern opening of the Tasmanian Gateway in conjunction with the simultaneous onset of regional surface water and continental cooling $(2^{\circ}{-}4^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . The timing of subsequent deepening of the Tasman Gateway and Drak e Passage still is not well constrained; estimates range from the middle Eocene to early Miocene fo r the development of circum-Antarctic deepwater passages and the formation of the full AC C (Lawver and Gahagan, 1998, 2003; Barker, 2001; Pfuhl and McCave, 2005; Scher and Martin, 2006). Interestingly, abyssal hiatuses along the thermohaline flow path at the base of the Campbel l Plateau developed at the time of the Eocene/Oligocene boundary; however, shallow-water hiatuses indicate a ${\sim}3$ My younger formation age. Furthermore, grain size, stable isotope, and foraminifer data along the ACC flow path suggest that the ACC developed after the EOT, in the lat e Oligocene or at the Oligocene/Miocene boundary (Pfuhl and McCave, 2005; Lyle et al., 2007). Uncertainty in the timing of ACC formation compounds the ongoing debate about the potentia l role of ACC formation on global/regional climate. Site U1553 will contribute to our understandin g of the timing of ACC formation as well as the potential impact of ACC formation on climate.  

# 3.4. Water formation and hydrologic cycling  

Deep and bottom water likely formed south of the polar front during the Paleogene (e.g., van d e Flierdt et al., 2004; Thomas et al., 2014), and the character of this deeper water can be assessed b y measuring geochemical signals preserved in benthic foraminifers, fossil fish teeth and bones, an d Fe-Mn oxide minerals at the proposed drill sites. Data from Site U1553 will enable us to asses s existing models for the evolving mode of intermediate water formation through the Paleogene.  

Proxy estimates of atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2},$ SSTs, and terrigenous organic matter inputs will contribut e significantly to the state of understanding of Paleogene prevailing winds and hydrologic cycling. For example, published model simulations and existing proxy data suggest that overall hydrologi c cycling was more intense during the early Paleogene, resulting in higher precipitation in temperat e and high latitudes (e.g., Pagani et al., 2006). Higher precipitation/humidity would have caused  a greater vegetative cover in temperate and high-latitude continental regions than during drier periods, which in turn would have diminished dust transport from source regions to the ocean basins. Conversely, an enhanced hydrological cycle implies a drying of the arid-to-semiarid regions (Hel d and Soden, 2006) that may have enhanced the size of the subtropical dust source regions.  

Only a few dust accumulation and provenance records exist for the Late Cretaceous and earl y Paleogene (e.g., Janecek and Rea, 1983; Hovan and Rea, 1992; Zhou and Kyte, 1992; Dunlea et al., 2015). In general, the compilation of long-term data indicates higher dust accumulation in th e North Pacific (Deep Sea Drilling Project [DSDP] Site 576; piston Core LL44-GPC3) than th e southern Indian Ocean (ODP Sites 756 and 757) during the Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene. Late Paleocene high-resolution data from Indian Ocean DSDP Site 215 indicate a transien t increase in dust fluxes at ${\sim}59\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , but fluxes before and after the pulse seem to be consistent wit h the few other Southern Hemisphere locations (Hovan and Rea, 1992). Northern Hemisphere dus t fluxes increased throughout the Neogene; however, the Indian Ocean sites record a slight decreas e in flux throughout the Cenozoic. Site U1553 provides an opportunity to contribute to the recor d of dust deposition and provenance in the southwestern Pacific, and statistical analysis of bulk sediment elemental data will enable us to determine the accumulation rate of and distinguish betwee n eolian dust and disseminated ash (e.g., Dunlea et al., 2015).  

# 3.5. Chronostratigraphy  

High-quality, multiple-hole Cenozoic sedimentary successions from the Atlantic (ODP Legs 171B, 207, and 208 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 342) and Pacific (ODP Legs 19 8 and 199 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 320 and 321) yielded high-resolutio n geochemical records that also led to the development of astronomically calibrated age model s (e.g., Röhl et al., 2007; Westerhold et al., 2011, 2018; Littler et al., 2014; Lauretano et al., 2016; Barnet et al., 2019; Westerhold et al., 2020; De Vleeschouwer et al., 2020; Tierney et al., 2020). Expedition 378 will contribute a unique section that includes crucial time intervals for the Sout h Pacific area that will be integrated into the global chronostratigraphy.  

# 3.6. Previous drilling  

The best-known Paleogene paleoceanographic site in the South Pacific Ocean is DSDP Site 277, which was drilled during Leg 29. This site is located south of New Zealand and recovered uppe r Oligocene to upper Paleocene carbonates from a single hole. The Eocene portion of this hole wa s spot cored with low recovery (Kennett et al., 1975). The current water depth at this location i s ${\sim}1215\mathrm{~m~}$ . The Site 277 sediment sequence consists of ${\sim}10\mathrm{~m~}$ of Pliocene–Pleistocene carbonat e ooze that is disconformably separated from an expanded middle Paleocene to upper Oligocen e sequence with sedimentation rates of $19{-}22\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My}$ .  

The sediments spanning the upper Eocene to upper Oligocene are stiff carbonate oozes, and th e ooze–chalk transition is nominally placed at 246 meters below seafloor (mbsf). Middle Paleocen e to upper Eocene sediments are variably indurated but typically consist of chalks with low to moderate amounts of lithification (Kennett et al., 1975). Materials from this site provided most of th e samples for two classic oxygen isotope curves that first defined the unusually warm early Eocen e period (Shackleton and Kennett, 1975; Savin, 1977).  

Improvements in advanced piston corer (APC) and half-length APC (HLAPC) technologies hav e significantly improved the ability to develop triple-core stratigraphic splices. This capacity wil l allow for unprecedented insight into the details and timing of the major events preserved in th e sedimentary record of the Campbell Plateau as reported by Hollis et al. (2015) for DSDP Site 277.  

# 3.7. Seismic studies and site survey data  

No modern seismic surveys exist in the immediate vicinity of Site U1553, and the original locatio n definition for Site 277 was based solely on drilling vessel Glomar Challenger shipboard subbotto m depth profiling $\left(3.5\,\mathrm{kHz}\right)$ (Kennett et al., 1975).  

# 4. Scientific objectives  

As laid out in Proposal 567-Full4, Expedition 378 sought to elucidate the temperate to subpola r climate and oceanography of the very warm Eocene, as well as the middle and late Cenozoic, in th e far southern Pacific Ocean. Proposed drill sites were positioned along Anomaly 25 $.56\,\mathrm{\textrm{Ma}})$ between $56^{\circ}$ and $70^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ paleolatitudes (using the Ocean Drilling Stratigraphic Network web pag e backtrack scheme). The overall aim was to obtain a continuous well-preserved sediment sectio n that would address the following primary scientific objectives (of equal priority):  

1. To reconstruct the early Eocene surface water temperature gradient around Antarctica to monitor ocean heat transport and to extrapolate subsurface water structure (proposed Sites SP-1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, and DSDP 277 and, to a lesser extent, proposed Sites SP-4B, SP-5B, and SP-15A),   
2. To establish the early Eocene vertical temperature gradient (proposed Sites DSDP 277, SP-1B, and SP-2B),   
3. To evaluate early Eocene biological productivity and determine nutrient exchange and mixing of surface and subsurface waters (proposed Sites SP-1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, and DSDP 277 and, to a lesser extent, proposed Sites SP-4B, SP-5B, and SP-15A),   
4. To track the development and variability of South Pacific thermohaline circulation during the Paleogene (proposed Sites SP-1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, SP-15A, SP-4B, and SP-5B),   
5. To document the response of the proto-Ross Gyre (South Pacific subantarctic gyre) to the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) (proposed Sites DSDP 277, SP-1B, SP-2B, and SP-3B and, to a lesser extent, proposed Sites SP-4B, SP-5B, and SP-15A),   
6. To reconstruct changes in South Pacific temperature, circulation, and productivity associated with the greenhouse–icehouse transition (Eocene/Oligocene boundary) (proposed Sites SP1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, SP-13A, SP-14A, and DSDP 277 and, to a lesser extent, proposed Sites SP4B, SP-5B, and SP-15A),   
7. To establish the development of the ACC (proposed Sites SP-14A, SP-13A, DSDP 277, SP-1B, SP-2B, and SP-3B), and   
8. To reconstruct the evolution of the Paleogene wind field (proposed Site SP-15A and all other sites).  

The obtained sediment sections would also address the following additional objectives:  

1. To develop a common chronostratigraphic framework for Paleogene Southern Ocean magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and cyclostratigraphy (all proposed sites),   
2. To resolve geographic distribution of important Paleogene and early Neogene hiatuses in concert with ODP Leg 181 results and DSDP drilling (primarily proposed Sites DSDP 277, SP-1B, SP-2B, SP-3B, SP-13A, and SP-14A),   
3. To better determine Paleogene Pacific plate motion (all proposed sites), and   
4. To determine, if possible, Paleogene and Neogene development of ice rafting from Antarctica (primarily proposed Site SP-1B).  

# 4.1. Revised scientific objectives for Site U1553  

Altered drilling operations for Expedition 378 that eliminated the abyssal sites listed in the Scientific Prospectus prompted a significant revision of the scientific objectives. Much of the transi t from Lautoka, Fiji, to Site U1553 was devoted to revisiting laboratory group and individual scienc e plans to ensure that each member of the science party had the ability to contribute to the postcruise science. All of the science plans were crafted to exploit the new continuously cored, multiple-hole sediment section from Site U1553 to achieve the following revised objectives:  

1. To reconstruct the surface and deepwater temperatures and carbon inventory, as well as vertical temperature gradients, through the Paleogene, with particular emphasis on the major events that punctuate this long-term record (e.g., the EOT, Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum [MECO], Eocene Thermal Maximum [ETM] events, Early Eocene Climatic Optimum [EECO], PETM, and Cretaceous/Paleogene $[\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{Pg}]$ boundary);   
2. To develop an integrated chronostratigraphic framework for the Paleogene Southern Ocean including magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and cyclostratigraphy;   
3. To refine our understanding of the Paleogene evolution of seawater chemistry, the role of atmospheric concentrations of $C O_{2},$ and ice sheet dynamics;   
4. To evaluate Paleogene biological productivity and determine nutrient exchange and mixing of surface and subsurface waters;   
5. To track the development and variability of South Pacific Intermediate Water composition and its role in overturning circulation throughout the Paleogene, with emphasis on refining the timing and development of the ACC;   
6. To determine, if possible, Paleogene and Neogene development of ice rafting from Antarctica;   
7. To better determine Paleogene Pacific plate motion; and   
8. To reconstruct the evolution of the Paleogene wind field.  

# 5. Site U1553  

# 5.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1553 is located at $1221\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth and provided the opportunity to continuously core multiple holes of a critical sequence of Paleogene sediments on the southern Campbell Plateau (Figur e F1). The objectives of Site U1553 were the overall expedition objectives reported above: to recover  a multiple-cored, continuous Paleogene sequence to reconstruct SSTs and deepwater temperatures, a s well as vertical temperature gradients, with particular emphasis on the major events that punctuat e the Paleogene record (e.g., EOT, MECO, EECO, ETM events, PETM, and $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary); t o develop a common chronostratigraphic framework for Paleogene Southern Ocean magnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and cyclostratigraphy; to refine our understanding of the evolution of seawater chemistry; to evaluate Paleogene biological productivity and determine nutrient exchange an d mixing of surface and subsurface waters; and to track the development and variability of Sout h Pacific Intermediate Water composition and its role in overturning circulation during the Paleogen e and Late Cretaceous, with emphasis on refining the timing and development of the ACC.

# 5.2. Operations  

After a $2249\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Lautoka, Fiji, the vessel stabilized over Site U1553 at $1210~\mathrm{h}$ (al l times are local; $\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ on 15 January 2020. Five holes were cored at Site U1553 (Figure F1; Table T1). The operations plan was to triple core the upper portion of the sedimentary sequenc e using the APC/extended core barrel (XCB) drill string and then rotary core two deep holes to  a maximum depth of $670~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{2}}$ , followed by logging of the final hole. Hole U1553A recovered 2 7 cores taken over a $216.4~\mathrm{m}$ interval with $98.9\%$ recovery. Temperature measurements were take n using the advanced piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool on Cores 378-U1553A-4H, 7H, an d $10\mathrm{H}$ , and all full-length APC cores were oriented using the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool. Th e total time spent on Hole U1553A was $34.00\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.4 days). After repairs to the top drive brake wer e concluded, operations resumed at $0915~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 January. Hole U1553B recovered 29 cores take n over a $243.0\;\mathrm{m}$ interval with $95.4\%$ recovery. The total time spent on Hole U1553B was $42.50\,\mathrm{h}$ (1. 8 days), with $^{10\mathrm{~h~}}$ spent repairing the top drive. With weather systems moving in, the thir d APC/XCB hole was deferred in favor of an attempt to reach the deeper objectives with the rotar y core barrel (RCB) system. Hole U1553C was spudded at $0010~\mathrm{h}$ on 19 January and drilled ahea d without core recovery to 234.0 mbsf. A total of 43 cores were taken over a $333.5\mathrm{~m~}$ interval wit h $47.4\%$ recovery. Anomalously low $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios in Cores 43R and 44R forced termination of corin g at 567.5 mbsf. The total time spent on Hole U1553C was $82.75~\mathrm{h}$ (3.4 days). Hole U1553D wa s drilled ahead to 178.3 mbsf. The center bit was pulled, and the Sediment Temperature 2 (SET2 ) tool was lowered to obtain a fourth temperature measurement with the goal of refining the thermal gradient at Site U1553. After recovering the SET2 temperature probe, the center bit wa s deployed again and the hole was drilled to 399.4 mbsf. During coring operations, clearance wa s provided by the Environmental Protection and Safety Panel to advance Hole U1553D deeper tha n Hole U1553C on a core-by-core basis pending headspace gas analysis. Hole U1553D was terminated at 584.3 mbsf, and the vessel was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ west for Hole U1553E. Hole U1553E was spudded at $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 January. A total of 27 cores were taken in Hole U1553E over a $237.6\;\mathrm{m}$ interva l with $88.3\%$ recovery. The total depth for Hole U1553E was 237.6 mbsf, and the total time spent o n Hole U1553E was $33.25~\mathrm{h}$ (1.4 days). The total time spent at Site U1553 was 11.02 days, whic h includes $10\,\mathrm{{h}}$ lost to repair of the top drive. The vessel then began the 531 nmi transit to Timaru, New Zealand, to pick up fuel filters before continuing to Papeete, Tahiti (French Polynesia). Th e detour to Timaru added ${\sim}13\,\mathrm{h}$ to the originally planned transit to Papeete.  

# 5.3. Principal results  

Coring at Site U1553 reached a maximum depth of 584.3 mbsf and recovered a $581.16\mathrm{~m~}$ lon g sedimentary succession of deep-sea pelagic sediment of Pleistocene and Oligocene to early Paleocene age from the Campbell Plateau. The recovered sections comprise five lithostratigraphic unit s (Figure F2). About $4\,\textrm{m}$ of Pleistocene foraminifer-rich nannofossil ooze (Unit I) overlies a n expanded sequence ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ thick) of late Oligocene–early Oligocene nannofossil ooze with foraminifers (Unit II). The nannofossil ooze in Unit II gradually transitions into nannofossil chalk i n Unit III over $50~\mathrm{m}$ from ${\sim}175$ to 225 mbsf. Lithification of carbonates continues downcore an d results in limestone, categorized as Unit IV. Finally, the bottom ${\sim}100~\mathrm{m}$ of the sediment colum n contains siliciclastic Unit V, characterized by alternating mudstone, sandy mudstone, and very fin e to medium-grained sandstone (Figure F3).

# 5.3.1. Biostratigraphy  

A thin veneer of Pleistocene sediments overlies a sedimentary succession that spans the early lat e Oligocene to early Paleocene. The upper portion of this succession (Units I–III) is an expande d ${\sim}250~\mathrm{m}$ thick Oligocene to late Eocene (including the EOT) interval characterized by high abundance and good preservation of all microfossil groups reported here, namely calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, dinocysts, and radiolarians (Figure F4). Diatoms and sponge spicules are als o abundant and well preserved throughout this interval. The Eocene and Paleocene intervals i n Units IV and V are less expanded and have more variable microfossil abundance and preservation, but biostratigraphic and lithologic evidence indicates the presence of the Paleocene/Eocen e boundary. Low calcareous and siliceous microfossil abundance and poor preservation in the basa l mudstone to dolomitic mudstone, occasionally sandy unit (V) hampers exact age determination o f the basal part of the section (Figure F4).

All planktonic microfossil groups lack the low-latitude species that form the basis of standar d zonation schemes. For this reason, correlation and age assignments are based primarily on Southern Ocean and Southwest Pacific zonations. The shipboard integrated biozonation for the fiv e holes exhibits overall good agreement between observed bioevents in different microfossil groups.

# 5.3.2. Paleomagnetism  

Much of the recovered section was characterized by a very low abundance of magnetic carriers. The high abundance of carbonate in Units I–IV could have diluted the abundance of magnetite, hence contributing to weak overall remanence magnetization. Consequently, only the uppermos t $125\textrm{m}$ of Hole U1553A was suitable for magnetostratigraphic reconstruction. This preliminar y magnetostratigraphy for the upper part of Hole U1553A is composed of five pairs of normal an d reversed polarity patterns $({\bf n}1/{\bf r}1$ to $\mathbf{n}5/\mathbf{r}5$ downsection).  

# 5.3.3. Geochemistry  

The geochemical composition of the sediment and water samples from Site U1553 reflects th e lithostratigraphic composition and downcore diagenetic processes (Figure F5). Downcore change s in the abundance of carbonate and aluminosilicates mirror the lithologic transition between Unit s IV and V. The presence of occasional glauconite, manganese nodules, pyrite, and chert sugges t possible subseafloor changes in the aluminosilicates and the siliceous and carbonaceous components of the sediment. Interstitial water profiles compiled from Site U1553 resolve the first-orde r diagenetic processes and their potential impact on the application of paleoceanographic proxies.

Figure F4. Microfossil abundance, Site U1553. Abundance: $\mathsf{D}=$ dominant, $\mathsf{A}=$ abundant, $\mathsf{C}=$ common, $\mathsf{F}=$ few, $\mathsf{R}=$ rare, $\mathsf{T r}=$ trace, $\mathsf{B}=$ barren.  

Headspace gas analyses for the uppermost $480\textrm{m}$ of Site U1553 indicate very low hydrocarbo n concentrations, suggesting the lack of biogenic and/or thermogenic gas production or thei r upward migration. A sudden increase in methane concentration occurs at the transition from Uni t IV to Unit V. The methane increase is accompanied by the detection of thermogenic hydrocarbon s $\left(C_{2},C_{3},\right.$ and $C_{4}^{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ ), suggesting in situ methane production, possibly by microbial activity, and upwar d migration of thermogenic gas. Gradually decreasing $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios with depth led to the terminatio n of drilling operations in Hole U1553C at 568 mbsf. Recalculation of ${C_{1}}/{C_{2}}$ ratios and an additiona l temperature measurement provided a better constraint for the deeper drilling in Hole U1553D.  

Interstitial waters sampled from whole-round squeezing of sediment intervals and with Rhizon s indicate an increase in total alkalinity from $2.5\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the seafloor to $3.6\;\mathrm{mM}$ at 200 mbsf. Ammonium increases from ${\sim}20~\mathrm{mM}$ at the seafloor to $650{-}700~\mathrm{mM}$ at $420~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , suggesting organi c matter degradation through a series of redox fronts utilizing manganese/iron oxides and sulfate a s electron acceptors. Carbonate dissolution/reprecipitation could explain the increase in calciu m and strontium with depth. Ba concentrations are ${<}3\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$ , possibly suggesting low amounts of sulfate reduction, which, however, increases at depth. K and $\mathrm{Mg}$ concentrations decrease downcore, reflecting alteration and uptake into clays formed within the seafloor (e.g., glauconite) or becaus e of uptake into recrystallizing carbonates or authigenic clays forming within the seafloor.  

Solid-phase analyses indicate that the sediments predominantly consist of carbonate (average $=$ $90\%$ ) for the uppermost $420\;\mathrm{m}$ of Site U1553 (Units I–IV), ranging from $78\%$ to $99\%$ (Figure F5). Carbonate weight percent drops to ${<}10\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ at the top of Unit $\mathrm{V}$ $({\sim}480~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), and this decreas e coincides with an increase in Al, Si, and trace elements associated with aluminosilicates. Overall, organic carbon content is low $(<\!0.4\%)$ . X-ray fluorescence core scanning was undertaken for al l cores on shore and provides an unprecedented high-resolution record of elemental intensities fo r the newly recovered Campbell Plateau Cenozoic sediments.

# 5.3.4. Physical properties  

Variations in physical properties data correspond to transitions between major lithostratigraphi c units (Figures F6, F7). A slight increase in bulk density and natural gamma radiation at 180 mbs f corresponds with the transition between Units II and III. A significant increase in $P_{-}$ -wave velocit y and bulk density at 423 mbsf marks the top of Unit IV. A large increase in natural gamma radiatio n counts, decrease in $P_{-}$ -wave velocity and bulk density, and change in color at 477 mbsf are reflectiv e of the higher silica and clay content of Unit V.  

# 5.3.5. Stratigraphic correlation  

Cores recovered using the APC and XCB coring systems in Holes U1553A, U1553B, and U1553E, although seemingly in good condition and with reasonable recovery rates, were difficult to correlate because of the combined effects of the carbonate-rich lithology, age of the sediments, postdepositional history, and occasional core top drilling disturbance. Preliminary core offsets to alig n Holes U1553A, U1553B, and U1553E were assigned, but no continuous splice was attempte d during the expedition. Correlation of the two deeper holes (U1553C and U1553D) drilled usin g the RCB coring system was not possible for much of the section at the usual meter and decimete r scale because of poor recovery and the recovery of nonoverlapping intervals. An exception was  a series of cores surrounding the possible PETM interval and in the early Paleocene. X-ray fluorescence core scanning on shore was crucial for defining a reliable composite section.

# 6. Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 378 recovered five sedimentary sequences from Site U1553 that collectively span a n expanded and continuous Oligocene through late Eocene section, a triple-cored EOT, much o f the Eocene, a double-cored PETM, and a unique and expanded Paleocene mudstone interval. The $\mathrm{K/Pg}$ boundary was a primary target of drilling at Site U1553, and it was not recovere d because of the need to terminate Hole U1553D above our maximum approved drilling depth.  

Comparison of the recovery from Sites U1553 and 277 indicates substantially more complet e records of the Oligocene, much of the Eocene, and much deeper into the Paleocene, even into th e earliest Paleogene (Figures F2, F8). Postcruise analyses employing state-of-the-art proxies wil l enable us to accomplish most of the revised science objectives presented here and will provid e new and refined insights from this first continuously cored, multiple-hole, high–southern latitud e Paleogene site.
