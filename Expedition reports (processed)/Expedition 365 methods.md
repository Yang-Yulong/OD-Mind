# Introduction  

This chapter documents the methods used for shipboard measurements and analyses during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 365. All are closely based on earlier Nanka i Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) expedition s (i.e., Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 315 [Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009], 316 [Expedition 316 Scientists, 2009], 31 9 [Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010], 322 [Expedition 322 Scientists, 2010], 332, [Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011], 333 [Expedition 33 3 Scientists, 2012], 338 [Strasser et al., 2014], and 348 [Tobin et al., 2015]).  

# Reference depths  

All cores, except the whole-round samples taken for timecritical analyses (i.e., interstitial water and microbiology), wer e described and samples were analyzed during the Expedition 36 5 shore-based sampling party. Depths are reported relative to bot h the drilling vessel rig floor (rotary table) and the seafloor. Thes e depths are determined by drill pipe and wireline lengths an d correlated to each other by the use of distinct reference points . Drilling engineers on the D/V Chikyu refer to pipe length whe n reporting depth and report it as meters below rotary table (BRT) . This can be converted to meters from mean sea level (MSL) o r meters below seafloor (mbsf) by subtracting the height of the rotar y table above sea level $(28.5\,\textrm{m})$ from all calculations. Core depth s below the rotary table can likewise be converted to core depth below seafloor (CSF-B) (see IODP depth scales terminology a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines); however, we use d mbsf in place of CSF-B in this volume.  

# GeniusPlug  

# Instrumented retrievable casing packer (temporary monitoring system)  

As part of operations in Hole C0010A during Expedition 332,  a mechanically set retrievable casing packer (Baker Hughes A-3 LokSet) was installed inside the $9\%$ inch casing string (Figure F1) (Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011). This packer was equipped with a small instrument package (the “GeniusPlug”) designed to monitor por e pressure and temperature and collect samples for chemistry and microbiology. The center of the packer was set at 373 mbsf. The bottom of the GeniusPlug was set at 395 mbsf, within the screene d casing interval that spans the shallow megasplay fault zone. The GeniusPlug was connected via $3\%$ inch tubing $(19.2\;\mathrm{m})$ to the bridg e plug. The instrument package includes a data logger, a platinu m temperature sensor within the data logger housing, a self-containe d temperature sensor, and two pressure gauges: one “upward looking ” and one “downward looking.” The pressure sensors monitor (1) below the packer in the screened interval that is open to the fault zon e and (2) above the packer to serve as a hydrostatic reference open t o the overlying water column. This unit is an evolution of the “SmartPlug” (Kopf et al., 2011) and includes an extension to accommodat e additional experiments (Figure F2). This is accomplished by replacing the end cap (bullnose) with a second unit of the same diameter, which adds $30\;\mathrm{cm}$ to the length of the plug. The extension hosts  a continuous fluid sampler (OsmoSampler) (Jannasch et al., 2004 ) and  a  microbiological  colonization  experiment  (Flow-throug h Osmo Colonization System [FLOCS]) (Orcutt et al., 2010). Th e SmartPlug and GeniusPlug instruments developed in 2009 ca n monitor formation pore pressure and temperature from the tim e

the bridge plug is set until the instruments are retrieved during following expeditions.  

# General description  

The core elements of the SmartPlug, an instrument built for Expedition 319, remain unchanged given their robust design and uncomplicated handling; the GeniusPlug extension follows the sam e design. Structurally, each unit includes a hollow-bore $3\%$ inch E U 8RD box-end threaded coupling at the upper end that mates wit h the lower end of the packer and an outer O-ring sealed structural shell designed to withstand the loads encountered during hole reentry operations (Figure F3). Inside the main unit is a frame holding  a high-precision pressure period counter with a $12.8~\mathrm{MHz}$ real-tim e clock (RTC-PPC system, resolving ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{ppb}$ of full-scale pressure, o r ${\sim}0.7\ \mathrm{Pa})$ ), a 24-bit/channel A/D converter and data logger (designe d and built by Bennest Enterprises, Ltd.; Minerva Technologies, Ltd.; and the Pacific Geoscience Centre, Geological Survey of Canada), two pressure sensors (Models 8B7000-2-CE and 8B7000-1, Paroscientific, Inc., USA), and an independent miniature temperature logger (MTL) (Antares, Germany). Three independent temperatur e readings are recorded: (1) with the MTL, (2) with a platinum thermometer mounted on the primary data logger end cap, and (3) wit h

the upward-looking pressure sensor. The inside of the structura l shell is open to the sea through the internal open bore of the casin g packer seal. One pressure sensor is connected to this volume to provide a hydrostatic reference, and the other sensor is connected t o the sealed, screened borehole interval via hydraulic tubing tha t passes through the bottom end of the structural shell (Figure F2).  

RS-422 communications with the main instrument for settin g recording parameters and downloading data are conducted via  a multisegment SEACON All Wet-mate QQ-C-465 (AWQ) connector on the logger pressure case. Communications with the MTL ar e conducted through a reader obtained from Antares. The instrument frame is shock-mounted within the structural shell, and th e pressure sensors are mounted with secondary shock pads within th e frame (Figure F3). Structural components are constructed wit h 4140 alloy steel, and pressure sensor housings and hydraulic tubin g are constructed from 316 stainless steel.  

The extension unit for the GeniusPlug configuration is made o f the same material and includes a bulkhead to hydraulically separat e the SmartPlug body from the OsmoSampler and FLOCS (Figur e F2). This way, only trapped borehole fluid as well as formation flui d entering through the casing screens will enter the lower portion o f the instrument where the intakes for the OsmoSampler and FLOC S are located. These two experiments are contained in a 7.15 inc h high and 6.3 inch diameter space.  

The OsmoSampler has two 2ML1 ALZET membranes attache d to the housing with two-part epoxy (Hysol ES1902). The ends of th e distilled water and saturated salt (noniodized table salt, NaCl) reservoirs are sealed with a single O-ring and held in place with a se t screw. This configuration will pump $73\;\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{y}$ at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The pump i s attached to $150\,\textrm{m}$ of small-bore polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE ) tubing that holds $170~\mathrm{mL}$ ( $1.19\ \mathrm{mm}$ inside diameter [ID] and 2. 0 mm outside diameter [OD]). The tubing was filled with $10\%$ HCl fo r 5 days before it was rinsed with $18.2\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water. This sampler can b e deployed at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and maintain a continuous record for $2.3\,\mathrm{y}$ (or longer if the borehole temperature is cooler than $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\prime}$ ).  

The FLOCS experiment is attached to two pumps, each identical to the ones described above for the OsmoSampler. Both pump s are attached via a T-connection to double the pump rate $(146\;\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{y}$ at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{.}$ ). These pumps are attached to $150\mathrm{~m~}$ of small-bore PTF E tubing that holds $170\,\mathrm{mL}$ and were prepared as above. At $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ thes e pumps will fill the sample coil in 14 months. The pumps will continue to work because of the excess salt in the pump but will onl y preserve the most recent 14 months of fluid within the sample coil. The FLOCS is filled with about $50\;\mathrm{mL}$ of sterile seawater that mus t pass through the coils before borehole fluids are collected withi n the coils. As this sterile seawater enters the distilled water portion o f the pump, it will decrease the pump rate, but only minimally, eve n for a multiyear deployment. The inlet was attached to a syring e filled with $18.2\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water until just before deployment.  

The FLOCS experiment consists of a single unit that has fou r chambers. All components were sterilized and materials packe d with sterile tools in a hood. The chamber closest to the inlet contained two plastic grids with autoclaved rock chips ( $1{-}2\ \mathrm{mm}$ thic k and $5\,\mathrm{mm}\times5\,\mathrm{mm}$ ) mounted with epoxy. These two grids were hel d in place with autoclaved glass wool and $5~\mathrm{mm}$ borosilicate glas s beads. Rock chips were attached to the plastic grids also using epoxy. One grid has basalt glass in the bottom portion (AT11-20- 4055-B6) and basalt above it (J2-246-R2). The other grid has basal t in the bottom portion (J2-244-R4) and olivine above it. Above th e grids are three chambers filled with barite, olivine, and accrete d Nankai sediment (Expedition 316 sample material from Sectio n  

316-C0004D-47R-2; \~357 mbsf), respectively. These materials wer e crushed from bulk rocks and autoclaved. PTFE mesh screens wer e placed inside the cassette caps to prevent rock fragments from escaping the cassette. At sea, the FLOCS was filled with $>\!50\mathrm{~mL}$ o f sterile seawater to remove air bubbles. During this process, some o f the sediment from the end capsule escaped with excess seawater. U p to the point of deployment the inlet was capped with a syringe fille d with sterile seawater.  

# Settings  

The GeniusPlug was shipped to the Chikyu before Expeditio n 332 began. The time intervals for data acquisition for the formatio n and hydrostatic pressure sensors (serial Numbers 106043 an d 106100) and the internal platinum thermometer (Number 94) wer e set to $30\;\mathrm{s}_{\!}$ ; at this rate, battery power (provided by six Tadiran TL5137 DD primary lithium cells) is the limiting factor for operational lifetime, which is roughly 7 y, including a derating factor of $75\%$ applied to full-power withdrawal. The instruments are equipped wit h $512\;\mathrm{MB}$ low-power flash memory cards, which provide storage capacity until the year 2024 at a 30 s sampling rate. The independen t MTL in the GeniusPlug was set to sample temperature at $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ intervals. The main logger clock was synchronized to UTC on 6 November 2010 during Expedition 332, and the MTL clocks were set o n the same date. The GeniusPlug extension units were set up durin g the first weeks of Expedition 332. The GeniusPlug was deployed a t Site C0010 only a few days after the OsmoSampler and FLOCS unit s were filled (Figure F4).  

# Recovery  

Expedition 365 planned to retrieve the GeniusPlug installed i n 2010. Figure F5 shows the rig floor configuration and the instrument before entering the wellhead. The GeniusPlug was pulled ou t of the water at $0413\,\mathrm{h}$ (Japan Standard Time [JST]) on 3 April 201 6 and was successfully moved from the moonpool to the rig floor b y $0438\,\mathrm{h}$ . At this point, end caps were placed over the two sample intakes of the OsmoSampler to help prevent fluid loss. Once the GeniusPlug was detached from the bridge plug, the OsmoSampler wa s

recovered and brought into the laboratory. On the laborator y bench, the coils and FLOCS were disconnected from the pumps. The FLOCS unit was immediately wrapped in aluminum foil an d brought into the anaerobic chamber for microbiological sampling. Next, the OsmoSampler coil and then the FLOCS experiment coi l (referred to as the chemistry and biology coils, respectively) wer e sampled. Coils were measured and cut into $^{1}\,\mathrm{m}$ sections (Figure F6), and fluid was drained by gravity into $2\,\mathrm{mL}$ centrifuge tubes. Sampl e tubes were previously washed in $10\%$ HCl at $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and the n washed 3 times with $18~\mathrm{M}\Omega$ water. Fluids trapped by gas bubble s were forced from the tubing using an air filled syringe. Sampling o f both coils was completed by $1130\;\mathrm{h}.$ . Select splits were analyzed fo r chlorinity, alkalinity, cations, anions, and major elements (Tabl e T1). Additionally, a few samples were preserved for dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and isotopic analyses o f carbon, oxygen, boron, and lithium. A total of 2 samples from eac h coil were quickly placed inside a $20~\mathrm{mL}$ glass ampule directly afte r cutting and immediately sealed with a septum and metal crimp ca p for hydrocarbon analyses.

March  2016,  using  a  self-recording  drill  pipe  acceleromete r equipped with a triaxial acceleration sensor. VIV is caused by th e strong Kuroshio Current $\mathrm{(>}3\mathrm{\kt)}$ that flows over Hole C0010A. Kitada et al. (2011, 2013) documented VIV during the long-term borehole monitoring system (LTBMS) deployment in Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program Hole C0002G during Expedition 332. VIV had  a dominant frequency of $3{-}15~\mathrm{Hz}$ and a maximum acceleration of  2 G. For Expedition 365, the LTBMS system was redesigned to withstand these conditions; the accelerometer deployment was intende d to verify that VIV did not exceed this range before deploying th e observatory.  

The accelerometer was secured to the $5\%$ inch drill pipe usin g an attachment tool. The accelerometer was positioned $387\;\mathrm{m}$ abov e the bottom of the drill string and remained above the seafloo r during the entire operation. Specifications of the accelerometer ar e described in Table T2, and its orientation is shown in Figure F7. Our procedure to measure VIV was as follows. First, the accelerometer was attached to the drill pipe, which was then lowered to th e seabed in a low-current area (LCA). It remained on the drill strin g while the Chikyu drifted to Hole C0010A and into the strong current area to retrieve the GeniusPlug. Finally, the Chikyu drifted bac k to the LCA, retrieved the drill string, and recovered the accelerometer.  

# Pressure data recovery and processing  

The GeniusPlug was connected via an RS-422 serial interface a t the AWQ connector to a laptop computer running OS Ubuntu 10. 4 with the programs mlterm, mlbin, and mldat installed, which ar e specifically designed to interface with the pressure data logging system and convert the data into usable formats. Mlterm software establishes communication between the instrument and the lapto p and is used to check instrument status, change settings, downloa d data, or display data in real time. After establishing communication, clock drift was analyzed. For this purpose, an accurate time i s needed. Downloaded raw data (.raw format) are converted vi a mlbin software into a .bin file. Mlbin software strips off the file system information and tries to fix any bugs. The .bin file contains th e data record in binary format. The final step is usually a conversio n from .bin to .dat (ASCII) via the tool mldat9. However, the GeniusPlug is a hybrid in terms of pressure sensors, and mldat9 was unabl e to convert these data. The GeniusPlug uses an upward-looking 2- channel pressure (P) sensor measuring $\mathbf{P}$ and temperature (T), whereas the downward-looking sensor measures only P. Thus,  a special processing routine from .bin to .dat is necessary. Two Python programs (dumpBin.py and calibrateLogfile.py) were used t o perform the final conversion. All of these programs can be downloaded from http://corkobservatory.sourceforge.net/index.html.

# LTBMS  

The LTBMS was developed to observe fault and crustal dynamics off the Kii Peninsula. The LTBMS measures multiple parameter s in a partially cased borehole, such as ground motion, crustal deformation, and hydrogeological processes. Ground motion is measured near the bottom of the borehole by a set of seismometer s housed in a combined tiltmeter, broadband seismometer, an d strainmeter package. The set of seismometers includes three-component accelerometers (two sets), a three-component broadban d seismometer, and three-component geophones. Crustal deformation is measured by a tiltmeter and a volumetric strainmeter. Thes e sensors are coupled to the formation by cement; this also eliminate s noise in these sensors caused by fluid flow. All of the sensors (wit h the exception of the strainmeter) are mounted on an instrumen t carrier (see Figure F6 in the Expedition 365 summary chapter [Kop f et al., 2017]). All sensors and cables (including backups) wer e loaded aboard the Chikyu during the port call in Shimizu Harbor o n 25 March 2016.  

The LTBMS also includes temperature and pore fluid pressur e sensors distributed within the central and lower part of the borehole. Pore fluid pressure is measured at three pressure ports withi n the borehole: one at the bottom of the borehole (Port P1) below th e cemented section, another below the strainmeter (Port P2) withi n the cemented section, and one (Port P3) at the depth of the megasplay fault in the screened section of the casing (see Figure F6 in th e Expedition 365 summary chapter [Kopf et al., 2017]). A swellabl e packer within the casing isolates the formation pressure in th e screened zone from the ocean. A pressure sensing unit (PSU ) mounted on the LTBMS head holds four pressure sensors. Thre e pressure transducers in the PSU connect to $\%$ inch stainless tubin g terminating at each of the three downhole pressure ports (P1–P3). The fourth sensor measures seafloor pressure and temperature.  A thermistor string and stand-alone heat flow (SAHF) digitizer connected to the tilt combo package measures borehole temperature a t five depths between the seismometer/crustal deformation senso r packages and the megasplay fault. Table T3 describes the dimensions of the downhole instruments and sensors.  

All downhole LTBMS components in the borehole are attache d to a backbone of $3\%$ inch tubing for structural support. The $3\%$ inc h tubing also serves as a conduit for cement for the hole completion. All  downhole  sensors  are  connected  by  three  communication/power cables ( $21.3\;\mathrm{mm}\;\mathrm{OD})$ to the LTBMS head. Each senso r package (strainmeter, seismometer, and tilt combo) is connected t o the seafloor LTBMS head by one cable and each terminates with a n ODI underwater mateable connector (UMC). These are mounte d on the LTBMS head and temporarily connected to a batter y pack/data logger unit mounted on the remotely operated vehicl e (ROV) platform. Figure F8 (see also Figure F6 in the Expedition 36 5 summary chapter [Kopf et al., 2017]) shows a schematic of th e LTBMS. Table T3 shows specifications of the LTBMS instrumen t and sensors. After the LTBMS is connected to the Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET ) seafloor cabled network, all data from the sensors are streamed t o shore in real time.

An H-beam–shaped instrument carrier (Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011) is designed to hold the sensors and protect them fro m the Kuroshio Current during deployment (Figure F9). This include s the borehole sensors, electrical cables, a thermistor string, and hydraulic lines. A $190~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter and $30~\mathrm{mm}$ thick flange at eac h end provides sufficient strength to resist bending and tension loading. Cables, the thermistor string, and hydraulic lines pass throug h six preformed slits in the flanges, and six M16 high-tension bolt s with self-locking nuts were used for each flange connection. A cement pipe $\mathrm{48.6~mm}$ OD and $34.4~\mathrm{mm~ID})$ was installed along th e instrument carrier to route the cement to the bottom of the hole. Before being loaded onto the Chikyu, a test of sensor positionin g and cable routing was performed on the instrument carrier to confirm the attachment procedures for the cables, thermistor string, and hydraulic line routing.  

The broadband seismometer (CMG3T) and tilt combo consis t of a geophone, an accelerometer and data logger, an SAHF digitizer, and a tiltmeter, which were installed on the instrument carrier usin g a band-type attachment tool. Fiberglass-reinforced plastic isolate d the sensor casings from the instrument carrier. All cables and hydraulic lines were connected to the $3\%$ inch tubing and the instrument carrier using steel bands and plastic zip ties. The thermisto r string was connected to the SAHF digitizer and attached to the instrument carrier. Specifications of the sensors and instrument carrier are summarized in Figure F9. The orientation of the sensors i s shown in Figure F10.  

# Electrical cable  

Three electrical cables $21.3\;\mathrm{mm}$ OD) developed specifically fo r the LTBMS were connected to borehole sensors (tilt combo, seismometer, and strainmeter). They were designed with near neutral buoyancy to avoid operational risk and for weight reduction. Senso r connectors (SEACON MINK connectors) were molded to the end s of each cable before being loaded onto the Chikyu (Figure F11). Th e upper ends of the cables were terminated and molded with OD I Teledyne UMCs on board the Chikyu at the time the LTBMS hea d was ready for deployment.  

# $^{3\%}$ inch tubing and centralizers  

A total of $640~\mathrm{m}$ of $3\%$ inch $12.7~\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{ft}$ tubing was connected t o the LTBMS head as the main support for the downhole LTBMS assembly. Two types of centralizers were used. Bowspring centralizer s were attached below the strainmeter and above the cement port t o allow uniform cement flow around the instruments. At othe r depths, four rigid centralizers with cable protectors were attache d to each joint of $3\%$ inch tubing to protect the cables and hydrauli c lines from damage (Figure F12). Cables and the thermistor strin g were also protected by rubber hose sheaths in areas with shar p edges or where a change in diameter of the string was encountered.  

# Cementing the sensors  

Cementing was used to couple the sensors installed at the bottom of the hole to the surrounding formation (and casing). A cement port was set on the $3\%$ inch tubing to the planned depth of th e bottom of the cement column at 602 mbsf (see Figure F6 in the Expedition 365 summary chapter [Kopf et al., 2017]).  

# Swellable packer  

The swellable packer (Halliburton, P/N 101938037) (Figure F13 ) is a nonmechanical borehole seal that upon contact with seawate r begins to swell up to $350\%$ of its original volume (depending o n pressure and temperature conditions). The swellable packer was installed on the $3\%$ inch tubing to be set at 374.6–376.7 mbsf in Hol e C0010A. The swellable packer’s initial OD is 7.89 inches and it s length is $1.5\textrm{m}$ . The ID of the $9\%$ inch casing is 8.68 inches. Antiextrusion end rings (with the same OD as the packer) were attache d to each end of the packer; these rings expand radially against th e casing ID so that the packer seal elements are not able to extrud e above or below them. A packer mandrel $3\%$ inch OD and $4.5\textrm{m}$ length) was connected to the $3\%$ inch tubing while the packer wa s covered with a diffusion barrier (8L), a low-permeability material

that retards water migration into the packer. Based on swelling simulations at $4^{\circ}C$ , the 7.89 inch OD packer with 8L diffusion barrie r should swell to 8.09 inches after 1 week and 8.17 inches after  2 weeks. At $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , the packer is expected to swell to 8.12 inches after  1 week, and 8.19 inches after 2 weeks. Previous swelling simulatio n tests at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technolog y (JAMSTEC) showed that the packer swelling rate is slightly slowe r at lower temperatures.  

The electrical cables and hydraulic flatpack $\mathrm{28~mm\times12~mm})$ ) were fed through the swellable packer on the working cart in th e moonpool while lowering the sensor assembly. The clearanc e around the cable through the packer was set at $2.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ $5\,\mathrm{mm}$ total). This clearance is needed to reduce any risk of cable damage due t o cable pull force and slack while the packer is lowered into the borehole. The packer was cut four times length-wise (each slit $90^{\circ}$ apart ) to feed through the three electrical cables and the flatpack. After cable installation, the antiextrusion end rings with the cable slit cove r were tightened and the cables were fixed to the $3\%$ inch tubin g above and below the packer (Figure F13).

# LTBMS head  

The LTBMS head (30 inch effective diameter and 24 ft, $2\%$ inches long) sits at the top of the observatory on the seafloor SG- 5 riserless wellhead. Figure F14 shows the LTBMS head with the PS U installed. The ODs of the inner and outer mandrels are $4\%$ inch an d $9\%$ inch, respectively. The central part of the LTBMS head has thre e

bays: Bay 1 for the PSU and valves, Bay 2 with three ODI Teledyn e UMCs for downhole sensors, and Bay 3 to attach extra lengths o f cable.  

The PSU was installed in Bay 1 and contains four high-precisio n quartz pressure sensors (Paroscientific, Inc.) (Figures F14, F15). Each sensor on the PSU is plumbed to a series of three-way valve s for the pressure sensors to access either the formation (via hydrauli c lines) or the ocean, in series with two-way valves that allow flui d sampling. A UMC port at the top of the pressure logger is used t o connect to the measurement and download data (Figure F14) (se e Observatory pressure sensing unit for more details).  

The top ends of the electrical cables for the downhole sensor s were terminated on board the Chikyu and then attached to UMC s (Figure F15). After termination, the electrical cables were securel y attached to the split chain links welded on the bay panels and th e outer mandrel using tie wraps and duct tape to prevent any damag e while drifting to the site and during hole reentry. The three UMC s were mounted on the attachment plate in Bay 2 via M16 bolts wit h self-locking nuts. The height of the mounting plate was set at a minimum of $790~\mathrm{mm}$ from the top of the ROV platform to account fo r the bending radius of the cables and to allow clearance for ROV operations. An ROV access platform (8 ft radius) was attached to th e LTBMS head before lowering the LTBMS head into the moonpool.

A strainmeter was designed by JAMSTEC for deep-sea borehol e installation (Figure F16). The principle of the strainmeter is simila r to the Sacks-Evertson type of volumetric strainmeter that measure s the volume of an oil-filled cylindrical strain-sensing volume in response to deformation of the surrounding formation (Sacks et al., 1971). This deformation is transmitted to the volume through th e cement filling the annulus between the formation and the strainmeter.  

This strainmeter was designed with a $165~\mathrm{mm}$ sensing volum e diameter, which is much larger than conventional land-base d strainmeters (typically ${\sim}75\;\mathrm{mm}\$ ). The strainmeter is ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m}$ long, including digitizer electronics and a transducer housing, chambers, joints, and the sensing volume ( ${\sim}2.8~\mathrm{m}$ length). It also incorporate s a line through its center so that cement can be pumped through th e instrument to reach the cement port on the bottom of the observatory (see Figure F6 in the Expedition 365 summary chapter [Kopf e t al., 2017]).  

The strainmeter is designed to withstand ambient pressures u p to $70\;\mathrm{MPa}$ that the instrument may experience as it passes throug h the water column to the borehole. The strainmeter is very sensitiv e to deformation; the full-scale range of the volume change measure d by the bellows is approximately $1\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , corresponding to a strain of  3 $\times\,10^{-5}$ in the sensing volume. While being lowered from the ship, the strainmeter experiences much larger strains than it can tolerat e within the full scale of measurement. Therefore, a valve bypassin g the bellows is installed to protect the sensor and is kept open whil e the instrument is deployed. After the instrument is cemented int o position, the bypass valve is closed (and measurements begin) by issuing a command via the ROV connection to the UMC on th e LTBMS head. The bypass valve also opens automatically when th e instrument measures strains outside its full measurement range. Opening the valve recenters the bellows to zero to reset accumulated strain; the valve is then subsequently closed to resume strai n measurements. The bellows position (indicating strain change) i s recorded by a digitizer in the strainmeter, and the strain data ar e transmitted uphole to the data recorder by an electrical cable.  A Paroscientific pressure gauge (8B7000-2) is also connected to th e strain sensing volume, and its pressure reading is used to check th e status of other components, including the bypass valve. A threecomponent accelerometer (JA-5H200, JAE) is also included in th e strainmeter.  

A controller inside the strainmeter regulates the digitizing displacement of bellows and pressure, valve position (open or closed), and acceleration. The cable transmits serial data and power (24–3 0 V DC) to the strainmeter. The power consumption of the strainmeter is approximately 3 W during normal operations and is increase d to ${\sim}6.0\;\mathrm{W}$ while the valve is changing position (Table T3).  

VIV is a common effect of the strong Kuroshio Current (Kitad a et al., 2011, 2013), and operating in the current causes wear an d damage to equipment and sensors. VIV exhibits a dominant frequency of $3{-}15~\mathrm{Hz}$ and a maximum acceleration of $2\;G$ . Vibratio n tests approximating these conditions were performed to confir m that the strainmeter design is capable of withstanding these vibrations during installation. These tests were applied to all sensors an d electronics. High-pressure tests (up to $60\,\mathrm{MPa}_{\cdot}$ ) successfully showe d that the valve, bellows, and sensor plumbing systems function correctly under pressure.

Figure F17. Diagram of CMG3T borehole broadband seismometer.  

# Broadband seismometer  

A CMG3T borehole broadband seismometer (Guralp Systems, Ltd) was installed in the instrument carrier to measure ground velocity in three orthogonal $\left(x-,y-$ , and $z\cdot$ -) directions in the frequenc y range between $\%_{60}$ and $50\;\mathrm{Hz}$ . Separate sensors measuring groun d motion for each axis are housed in a titanium pressure housing (Figure F17). The seismometer is mounted near the bottom of the instrument carrier and is cemented in the hole to ensure goo d coupling to the formation. Each sensor has a motorized levelin g mechanism so that the sensors are functional within $4.5^{\circ}$ of tilt.  

Each sensor has a proof mass supported on a pivot and suspended by a leaf spring during operation. The pivot is designed t o be weak to assure very high sensitivity to ground motion. To protec t this weak pivot from damage during transport, the proof mass mus t be motion-locked. Locking and unlocking the proof mass, levelin g each sensor, and digitizing the $x,\,y,$ and $z$ ground motion are performed via a DM24 digitizer, which is installed within the pressur e housing.  

The three-component ground velocity data along with the position of the proof mass and inclination of the sensor from a MicroElectro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) tiltmeter are encoded i n Guralp compressed format (GCF). The data are digitally uplinke d through the borehole on a RS-422 serial cable. The three-component ground velocity data are digitized at $100\;\mathrm{Hz}$ in 24-bit resolution, whereas the mass position and tilt from the MEMS sensor ar e digitized at 4 samples/s.  

![](images/f1305890514bd2d1bdf8c8aee85638463fab9fe8e000dec6c2a37cb9e6b109bc.jpg)  

Time synchronization of the data is governed by the DM24 digitizer. The DM24 receives a time reference through the RS-42 2 downlink on the serial cable in Streamsync format. The same downlink serial connection is also used to send commands to the DM2 4 to control the CMG3T seismometer (e.g., level the sensor; lock, unlock, and center the proof mass; and calibrate the sensor).  

Power for the CMG3T broadband seismometer is supplied b y the same cable used for the data link. Power consumption of th e seismometer ranges from 2 to 3 W and increases to 6 W when operating the onboard motor to level, unlock, and lock the sensors. Because the $600\,\mathrm{m}$ long borehole cable dissipates power over its lengt h due to resistance (approximately $15\ \Omega$ ), higher voltages $(\sim\!30\,\mathrm{~V~})$ need to be applied so that the seismometer can receive sufficien t power to run the motor. Table T3 includes the specifications of th e CMG3T borehole sensor for this observatory installation.  

The CMG3T borehole seismometer installed in Hole C0010A i s the same design as that installed in Hole C0002G during Expeditio n 332 (Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011). This design was modifie d from the original specifications in advance of Expedition 332 to reduce the impact of severe vibration and shock to the sensor durin g deployment and installation. A series of vibration tests for each sensor confirmed that the redesign was effective. After assembly, eac h sensor was checked for noise performance in a vault, subjected t o vibration, and rechecked for noise performance to make sure tha t vibration did not affect the performance of the seismometer.  

# Tilt combo (tiltmeter, geophone, accelerometer, and thermometer digitizer)  

# Specifications  

The tilt combo is an integrated sensor module that includes  a tiltmeter,  geophone,  accelerometer,  and thermometer  digitize r (SAHF). A schematic diagram of the tilt combo is shown in Figur e F18. One titanium housing unit contains the three-component geophone $4.5\ \mathrm{Hz}$ GS-11D, Geospace Technology), the three-component accelerometer (JA-5H200, JAE), electrical boards, a CP U board, an A/D conversion board, a power supply board, and interna l batteries. Signals from the three-component geophone and accelerometer are digitized by an A/D converter (ADS1282, Texas Instruments) on the A/D conversion board with a $125~\mathrm{Hz}$ sampling rate. The A/D board has a calibration circuit for the geophone that ca n transmit electrical pulses to the geophone.  

The tiltmeter (Lily, Applied Geomechanics) and thermomete r digitizers (SAHF, Kaiyo-denshi) have their own A/D converters an d titanium housings and are connected to the CPU board through a n electrical cable using dry-mate connectors. The tiltmeter, SAH F digitizer, and accelerometer can individually be set to active o r sleeping modes by switching electrical relays on the power suppl y board.  

All data are merged on the CPU board and telemetered via a n RS-422 interface to the recorder on the ROV platform in WIN format. A stand-alone acquisition mode is also available, in which all data are stored on an secure digital (SD) memory card mounted o n the CPU board. The CPU clock time can be synchronized to a GP S 1 pulse/s signal (Table T3).  

The tilt combo sensors were fixed to the instrument carrier before installation. Additional sets of sensors were prepared as backups.  These  sensors  included  two  sets  of  the  geophone  an d accelerometer modules, two sets of Lily tiltmeters (serial Number s N8035 and N8069), and two sets of SAHF digitizers.  

# Thermistor string  

The thermistor string is designed for monitoring temperature i n the borehole for long periods of time. It has five thermistors place d at intervals along an electrical cable for array monitoring as show n in Figure F19. The electrical wires are covered by a hydrolyticall y stable polyether-based material, and the thermistors and connectors are molded using the same material as the cable. The thermistor string is connected to the SAHF thermistor digitizer, and th e $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{D}$ converted data are merged to a WIN file on the CPU board i n the geophone and accelerometer modules. Thermistor cables wer e calibrated in a precise isothermal bath for temperatures rangin g from $5^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . We calibrated the data using the following empirical formula:  

$$
T=1/\{A+B\times\ln(R/2-R0)+C\times[\ln(R/2-R0)]^{2}\}-273.15,
$$  

where  

$T\!=$ temperature (degrees C) in the isothermal bath measured by a high-precision quartz thermometer, $R=$ data logger reading ( $\textsuperscript{2\times}$ resistance in ohms),  

Figure F18. Tilt combo module configuration and schematic. The tilt combo has four different sensors: tiltmeter, geophone, accelerometer, and thermomete r digitizer (SAHF). Geophone, accelerometer, and electrical boards are installed in one titanium housing unit. The Lily tiltmeter and SAHF are in separate titaniu m housings. All three housings are connected by an electrical cable and were fixed to an instrument carrier prior to borehole installation. $\mathsf{P C B=}$ printed circui t board.

$R0=$ resistance of lead cable (in this case up to $170\,\mathrm{m}$ two-way, depending on the position of the sensors), and $A,B,$ , and $C=$ coefficients determined for each thermistor.  

Temperature differences between the measured and calculate d values $(\Delta T)$ are primarily attributed to actual temperature fluctuation in the isothermal bath. The absolute accuracy is thus estimate d as ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{mK}$ .  

# Observatory pressure sensing unit  

A PSU developed for the LTBMS was deployed during Expedition 365 for multilevel monitoring of pore pressure. The PSU i s equipped with four Paroscientific Digiquartz pressure transducer s (Model 8B7000-2-I; serial Numbers 106012, 106103, 106104, an d 106096), a RTC-PPC system (resolving ${\sim}10$ ppb of full-scale pressure, or ${\sim}0.7\ \mathrm{Pa})$ , a 24-bit/channel $\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{D}$ converter and data logge r (Bennest Enterprises Ltd., Minerva Technologies, Ltd., and the Pacific Geoscience Centre, Geological Survey of Canada), and associated  “Paroscientific  Intelligent  Module”  A/D  converters.  Th e Paroscientific gauges, which are also used in the GeniusPlug (se e GeniusPlug), have proven to be accurate and reliable, with accurac y within $\pm0.01\%$ of the full-scale range and pressure resolution to $^{\pm1}$ ppb of full scale (Becker and Davis, 2005). Three transducers connect to $\%$ inch stainless tubing that terminates at three measurement points in the subseafloor, and one transducer measure s hydrostatic pressure at the seafloor. The three $\%$ inch hydraulic line s are housed in a urethane-coated flatpack umbilical that connect s the monitored intervals to the LTBMS head (Figure F8; see also Figure F6 in the Expedition 365 summary chapter [Kopf et al., 2017]). A swellable packer set at 374.6–376.7 mbsf inside the casing isolate s the screened intervals to enable monitoring of in situ formatio n pressures once the response to drilling and open hole operation s has dissipated.  

![](images/6646ecf9a285273fbf1b382b822d8b496ca38d5c7165534cb1f2a08f5e6e5766.jpg)  
Figure F20. Miniscreens at lowermost pressure termination (P1).  

The lowermost monitoring interval is located below the megasplay fault in the overridden slope sediments (Unit II) at the botto m of the open borehole, below the strainmeter (Figure F8; see also Figure F6 in the Expedition 365 summary chapter [Kopf et al., 2017]). The pressure monitoring port is protected from clogging by three  1 inch diameter miniscreens, which are plumbed to a single manifol d that connects to a $\%$ inch stainless steel hydraulic tube (Figure F20). At the base of the strainmeter, this is connected to $\mathrm{~a~}\%$ inch hydraulic line that passes through the strainmeter and instrument carrie r above. The miniscreen configuration maximizes azimuthal coverage of the borehole while minimizing the possibility of screen obstruction.  The  second  hydraulic  line  terminates  within  th e instrument carrier in the cemented interval (see Observator y string). The third line monitors the screened interval within th e megasplay fault zone centered at 405 mbsf and below the swellabl e packer that serves to isolate the monitoring interval from the seafloor. The fourth sensor in the PSU is open to the ocean and is use d as a reference at the seafloor. The fourth sensor was grounded to th e frame of the PSU to prevent crevice corrosion of the Paroscientifi c sensor housing (this is made of 316 stainless steel, which is highl y prone to crevice corrosion). A $\%$ inch stainless steel bolt wa s screwed into a pretapped hole at the end of the sensor (these hole s are normally intended to attach small zinc anodes to the sensor) an d used to secure a ¹⁄16 inch hydraulic line to the sensor. The ¹⁄16 inc h line was then grounded to the base of the steel PSU frame (Figur e F21). This measure is not necessary for the three formation sensors, as they are connected to hydraulic lines attached to drill pipe on th e observatory string, the latter of which serves as a very large anode t o prevent corrosion.  

![](images/65500f270cea7529a4de8427942f034f61f4bdb7efcd5fa95abb532e10ebfdc2.jpg)  

When finally assembled, the PSU filled Bay 1 of the wellhea d (Figure F14). The data logger within the PSU at the wellhead can b e accessed via an ODI Teledyne UMC with the same specifications a s the set of three UMCs mounted in Bay 2 for the other instrument s (i.e., seismometer, strainmeter, and tilt combo). The ODI connecto r has a pin layout that is compatible to its three counterparts an d hence allows the ROV pilot to use the same interface for communication and data download.

A few days prior to deployment, the hydraulic lines on th e LTBMS head were flushed and the PSU was mounted on the wellhead for pressure tests to ensure that all of the plumbing and valve s on the wellhead were configured correctly and pressure tight. Thi s was done with a hand pump, first checking that water was flowin g through the correct pathways for each valve setting and then eac h hydraulic line was individually pressurized. During the test for eac h of the three pressure sensing intervals, each hydraulic line connecting the formation and the Paroscientific sensor was kept pressurized (typically at ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{MPa}$ of pump pressure) for at least $1\mathrm{-}2\,\mathrm{h}$ an d then pressure was released at the conclusion of each test. There wa s some initial difficulty evaluating the data from the pressure tests, a s the tests cause pressure spikes each time the pressure is increased o r decreased. This caused problems with the conversion program s mlbin and mldat9, which are commonly used to convert the ra w data files to ASCII data with time, temperature, and pressure values. This is an issue because mldat9 despikes the pressure data automatically, and this despiking procedure causes all subsequent record s (after any pressure spikes) to be incorrect. Python codes to conver t the  data  without  despiking  can  be  found  at  https://sourceforge.net/projects/corkobservatory.  

Initial pressure tests revealed that the valve for pressure Senso r 2 was faulty, and it was replaced with another valve from a spar e wellhead that was already on board the Chikyu. After the valve wa s replaced, it appeared to be operating correctly. Most of the othe r valves were found to be loose and did not operate correctly in th e initial tests. These were all tightened and the pressure tests were repeated; all valves and hydraulic lines held pressure. Still, all connections were checked and tightened prior to deployment. Prior to th e pressure tests, multiple tests were also performed in the laborator y to ensure that the PSU was logging data correctly at both high $^{>9}$ V) and low (7.5–9 V) voltages. The PSU in Hole C0010A is set to lo g at $60\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ when powered below $9\,\mathrm{V}$ (e.g., when it is running on batter y power), and the sampling rate will automatically increase to $1~\mathrm{Hz}$ when voltage exceeds 9 V. Upon connection to DONET the sampling rate increases to $1\ \mathrm{Hz}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , as the cabled network provides powe r at ${\sim}24\,\mathrm{V}.$ .  

# Seafloor recording and submarine cabled network  

The LTBMS has three separate cables for the downhole sensors : one each for the strainmeter, broadband seismometer, and til t combo (tiltmeter, geophones, accelerometer, and thermistor array). Pore fluid pressure is measured by sensors in the PSU mounted o n the LTBMS head that are connected to the formation at depth vi a hydraulic lines; data are recorded on a data logger in the PSU. Thes e can be regarded as four separate instrument packages sharing th e same borehole. The electrical connection specifications are designed to be the same in order to give flexibility in operations t o connect to them. When the system was initially deployed, three o f the sensor packages (strainmeter, broadband seismometer, and til t combo) were connected to a data recorder on the ROV platform t o facilitate connection by an ROV through a single UMC on the dat a recorder as well as to record observations prior to connecting th e observatory to the DONET network (Figure F8). Similarly, pressur e data are recorded on a data logger at a 1 min sampling rate prior t o DONET connection via a UMC on the PSU.  

# Data recorder (for strainmeter, broadband seismometer, and tilt combo sensors)  

The data recorder on the ROV platform consists of a repeater , two recording units, and batteries housed in a titanium sphere an d connects via UMCs to the borehole strainmeter, broadband seismometer, and tilt combo sensors. The repeater exchanges data between the data recorder and the borehole sensors and also control s the power supply to each sensor. The repeater also switches dat a flow between the ROV connection, each borehole sensor, and th e recording units. The data recorder has memory and batteries t o support up to 6 months of continuous operation of these sensors. The data recorder has another UMC for control and online data recovery by a cable connection from the ROV. Time synchronizatio n of the entire observatory is made through a GPS-referenced tim e signal sent from the ROV through the cable connection. The RO V can also connect to the pressure data logger via a UMC on the PS U for pressure data recovery.  

# ROV connection  

During installation, the condition of the downhole sensors wa s inspected via an ROV connection with the UMCs. An interface circuit attached to the ROV Magnum on the Chikyu was used t o change power settings and RS-422 data connections. By receivin g $24~\mathrm{V}$ power from the ROV, the interface circuit can control powe r

fed to the borehole instrument and measure supplied current an d voltage to the borehole sensor. The interface circuit also convert s the data format from the borehole sensors (RS-422) to a format supported by the ROV (RS-232C). The ROV Magnum on board th e Chikyu supports up to 115,200 bps speed in two-way communication to the surface. We used 57,600 bps as a standard speed to communicate with the borehole sensors.  

# Long-term observatory operation plans  

During Expedition 365, we confirmed that the borehole sensor s were operating correctly, and we then began recording data via th e ROV connection. The data recorder sphere was recovered during  a subsequent JAMSTEC ROV cruise and was replaced on 19 Jun e 2016 with an interface box to connect the sensors to the DONE T network (Figure F22). The pressure sensors were also connected t o DONET via the UMC mounted on the PSU. The DONET junctio n point is ${<}10\,\mathrm{km}$ from the observatory in Hole C0010A. Connecte d to DONET, all the borehole sensors receive power from the cabl e and the data are received in real time on land. Time synchronizatio n of the borehole data is also governed by precise time reference s from DONET.  

# X-ray computed tomography  

X-ray computed tomography (XCT) imaging helps to identif y key structural and sedimentological features in the recovered cor e and to find the best potential locations for discrete whole-roun d (WR) sampling (see XCT2D in Supplementary material). The latter include WR sections for interstitial water (IW) and microbiological (MBIO) analyses, as well as individual WR sample requests. Because core splitting, description, and most other analyses (excepting whole-round multisensor core logger [MSCL-W] and headspace gas) were deferred until a shore-based sampling party in July– August 2016, no other samples were taken during the expedition. Scientist “watchdogs” reviewed each XCT image for each core section to identify structures and sedimentological features and to select IW and MBIO samples of optimal quality while also preservin g materials for other expedition-related sampling and science objectives.  

XCT scanning methods followed those in the measuremen t manual prepared for the Center for Deep Earth Exploration (CDEX ) by technicians from Marine Works Japan (3-D X-ray CT Scanning, Version 3.00, 24 March 2015; based on GE Healthcare, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c; Mees et al., 2003; Nakano et al., 2000) and are th e same as those followed during previous expeditions (e.g., Moore e t al., 2014). The XCT scanner on the Chikyu is a Discovery C T 750HD (GE Yokogawa Medical Systems, Ltd.). This instrumen t scans a $1.4~\mathrm{m}$ core section in 10 min: 5 min to scan and then $5\;\mathrm{min}$ to create, or “reformat,” a coronal image. Images are core-axis-normal planes of X-ray attenuation values with dimensions of $512\times512$ pixels. Each axial scan of a $140\;\mathrm{cm}$ core section consists of approximately 2200 slice images, and each slice is $0.625\;\mathrm{mm}$ thick. Data ar e stored as Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) formatted files.  

# Background  

The theory behind XCT is well established in medical researc h and the Earth and planetary sciences (Carlson, 2006) and is onl y briefly outlined here. X-ray intensity varies as a function of $\mathrm{X}$ -ra y path length and a linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) of the targe t material:  

$$
I=I_{0}\times\mathbf{e}^{-\boldsymbol{\upeta}L},
$$  

where  

$I=$ transmitted X-ray intensity, $I_{0}={}$ initial X-ray intensity, $\Pi=\operatorname{LAC}$ of the target material, and $L=X$ -ray path length through the material.  

LAC is a function of the chemical composition and density o f the target material. The basic measure of attenuation, or radiodensity, is the computed tomography (CT) number given in Hounsfiel d units (HU):  

$$
\mathrm{{CT}\ n u m b e r=\left[\left(\eta_{\mathrm{t}}-\eta_{\mathrm{w}}\right)/\eta_{\mathrm{w}}\right]\times1000,}
$$  

where  

# $\eta_{\mathrm{t}}=\mathrm{LAC}$ for the target material, and $\Pi_{\mathrm{w}}=\mathrm{LAC}$ for water.  

The distribution of raw attenuation values in a given slice is the n used for image processing. Successive 2-D slices yield a representation of attenuation values in 3-D pixels (voxels).  

During Expedition 365, an acrylic three-layer core liner sectio n mock-up (calibration “standard”) was run to calibrate the XCT onc e every $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ during coring operations. This quality control (QC) standard was used to recalibrate the CT numbers of air, water, and aluminum if the “Fast Cal” CT numbers for air (CT number $=-1000{}^{\circ}$ ), water (CT number ${\o}=0$ ), and aluminum $\mathrm{2477<CT}$ number $<2487$ ) fall out of normal range. For each standard analysis, the CT numbe r was determined for a $24.85~\mathrm{mm^{2}}$ area at fixed coordinates near th e center of the cylinder.  

# XCT scan data usage  

XCT scans were used during Expedition 365 to  

• Examine features of interest, including deformation structures and bioturbation, in 3-D;   
• Distinguish natural fractures and faults from drilling-induced structures;   
• Provide an assessment of core integrity;   
• Determine locations for WR samples; and   
• Identify important structural and sedimentological features to be preserved and therefore avoided by WR sampling.  

XCT scanning was performed immediately after core section s were cut on the catwalk, logged in the J-CORES curation databas e in the core cutting area, and transported to the core processin g deck. All WR sections were screened by XCT watchdog scientists t o avoid destructive testing of important structural and sedimentological features when selecting WR samples to be used for IW or froze n as MBIO samples. An important criterion when selecting either I W or MBIO WR samples is to select samples with minimal fracturin g or drilling disturbance in order to minimize effects of contamination by drilling fluid.  

# Lithology  

Lithologic boundaries and lithologic units for Holes C0010C– C0010E were selected using criteria from visual core descriptio n and smear slides. These descriptions were compared with loggingwhile-drilling (LWD) data from Expedition 319 (Expedition 31 9 Scientists, 2010), including gamma ray, resistivity, and sonic data, a s well as coring results from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sit e C0004.  

Core description methods during Expedition 365 drew upo n protocols developed for NanTroSEIZE (e.g., Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009). Descriptions of core sections in Holes C0010C–C0010 E were based on  

• Macroscopic observations following standard IODP visual core description (VCD) protocols, • Microscopic observations (smear slides), and • Bulk mineralogical data from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and bulk elemental data from X-ray fluorescence (XRF).  

# Macroscopic observations of core  

We followed conventional Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, and IODP procedures for recordin g sedimentology information on VCD forms on a section-by-sectio n basis (Mazzullo and Graham, 1988) (see VCDSCAN in Supplementary material). VCDs were transferred to section-scale templates using J-CORES software and then converted to core-scal e depictions using Strater (Golden Software). Texture (defined by th e relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay) follows the classificatio n of Shepard (1954). The classification scheme for siliciclastic lithologies follows Mazzullo et al. (1988). The classification scheme o f Fisher and Schmincke (1984) was used to describe pyroclastic deposits.  

The Graphic lithology column on each VCD plots all beds ${\geq}2$ cm thick to scale. Interlayers ${<}2$ cm thick are identified as laminae i n the Sedimentary structures column. It is often difficult to discriminate between the dominant lithologies of silty claystone and claye y siltstone without quantitative grain-size analysis; therefore, we usually grouped that range of textures into the category “silty claystone ” on illustrations. Figure F23 shows the graphic patterns for all lithologies encountered during Expedition 365. Also shown are symbol s for sedimentary structures and severity of coring disturbance.  

# Smear slides  

Smear slides are useful for identifying and reporting basic sediment attributes (texture and composition) in core samples, but th e results are qualitative (Marsaglia et al., 2013). Smear slides were observed in plane-polarized light using an Axioskop 40A polarizin g microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a Nikon DS-Fi1 digital camera. We estimated the abundance of biogenic, volcaniclastic, and siliciclastic constituents using a visual comparison chart (Rothwell, 1989). Estimates of sand, silt, and clay percentages were entered int o the J-CORES samples database along with abundance categories fo r the observed grain types. The relative abundance of major components (quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals) was verified by XRD (se e X-ray diffraction), and the absolute weight percent of carbonat e was verified by coulometric analysis (see Organic geochemistry).  

# X-ray diffraction  

The principal goal of XRD analysis was to estimate the relativ e weight percentages of total clay minerals, quartz, feldspar, and calcite in specimens of bulk sediment. Material for XRD analysis wa s obtained from a $10\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample that was also used for XRF and carbonate analyses. All samples were vacuum-dried, crushed with  a

ball mill, and mounted as randomly oriented bulk powders. Routin e analyses of bulk powders were completed using a newly acquire d PANalytical CubiX3 diffractometer. This system was used by IOD P for the first time during Expedition 365. Instrument settings were a s follows:  

Generator voltage $=45\,\mathrm{kV}$ .   
Tube current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
Tube anode $\r=\mathrm{Cu}$ .   
Wavelength $=1.540598\mathrm{~\AA~}($ Kα1) and 1.544426 Å (Kα2).   
Start angle $=2^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
End angle $=60^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
Step spacing $=0.005^{\circ}26\$ .   
Scan step time $=1.27$ s.   
Scan speed $=0.50134^{\circ}26/\mathrm{s}$ .   
Divergent slit $=$ fixed $1/4$ .   
Monochromator used $=$ yes.   
Irradiated length $=10\;\mathrm{mm}$ .   
Scanning range $=2^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ}2\theta$ .   
Scan type $=$ continuous.  

To maintain as much consistency as possible with previous NanTroSEIZE results, we processed the digital data using MacDiff 4.2. 5 (http://www.ccp14.ac.uk/ccp/ccp14/ftp-mirror/krumm/Software/macintosh/macdiff/MacDiff.html).  Functions  include d “find baseline,” “smooth counts,” and correction of peak position using the quartz peak at $3.343\,\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ . The upper and lower limits for eac h diagnostic peak were adjusted manually following the guideline s shown in Table T4.  

Calculations of relative mineral abundance utilized regressio n curves that were generated from analyses of standard mineral mixtures with all values normalized to $100\%$ . Bulk powder mixtures fo r the Nankai Trough are the same as those reported by Underwood e t al. (2003): quartz (Saint Peter sandstone), feldspar (Ca-rich albite), calcite (Cyprus chalk), smectite (Ca-montmorillonite), illite (Cla y Mineral Society IMt-2, 2M1 polytype), and chlorite (Clay Minera l Society CCa-2). The standards were run three times, and correlations between mean peak area and weight percent were defined fo r each mineral. The following polynomial equations provide the statistical fits, where $X=$ peak area and $r=$ correlation coefficient:  

$r=0.923;$  

$$
\mathrm{{\bf~\lambda}a r t z}=-1.1695+0.00037795(X)-1.2198{\bf E}{-}10(X^{2}),\,r=0.991;
$$  

Feldspar $=0.96439+0.00052385(X)+4.2326\mathrm{E}-9(X^{2}),$ $r=0.990$ ; and  

$$
:=-1.9208+0.00082643(X)+2.3405\mathrm{E}{-9(X^{2})},\,r=0.997.
$$  

Average errors (calculated weight percent minus true weigh t percent) for the standard mineral mixtures are as follows:  

Total clay minerals $=3.3\%$ .   
Quartz $=1.9\%$ .   
Feldspar $=1.1\%$ .   
Calcite $=1.7\%$ .  

Values of relative abundance for natural specimens, however, should be interpreted with some caution. One of the fundamenta l problems with any bulk powder XRD method is the difference i n peak response between poorly crystalline minerals at low diffraction angles (e.g., clay minerals) and highly crystalline minerals a t higher diffraction angles (e.g., quartz and feldspar). Clay mineral content is best characterized by measuring the peak area, wherea s peak intensity may be more accurate for quartz, feldspar, and calcite. Analyzing oriented aggregates of clay-size fractions enhance s basal reflections of the clay minerals, but that approach is time consuming. For clay mineral assemblages in bulk powders, the two options are to measure one peak for each mineral and add th e estimates together (thereby propagating the error) or to measure  a single composite peak at $19.4^{\circ}{-}20.4^{\circ}26$ (Table T4). Chlorite doe s not contribute counts to that composite peak, so natural specimen s with high contents of chlorite will yield larger errors. The sam e source of error also applies to the standard mineral mixtures. Othe r sources of error include contamination of mineral standards by impurities such as quartz and zeolites (e.g., the illite standard contain s $\sim\!20\%$ quartz) and differences in crystallinity between standards an d natural clay minerals.

In the final assessment, calculated mineral abundances reporte d here should be regarded as relative percentages within a four-component system of clay minerals $^+$ quartz $^+$ feldspar $^+$ calcite. Th e accuracy of these values in representing absolute percentage s within the total volume of solids depends on the abundance o f amorphous solids (e.g., biogenic opal and volcanic glass) and the total of all other minerals that occur in minor or trace quantities. Fo r most natural samples from Site C0010, the difference between calculated relative abundance and absolute weight percentage is probably $5\%{-}10\%$ .  

# X-ray fluorescence  

XRF analyses were obtained in two modes: analysis of wholerock powders and scanning of the WR core surface on some selected intervals. Whole-rock quantitative XRF spectrometry analysis was undertaken for major elements on core working halves. Material for XRF was obtained from a $10\;\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample that was als o used for XRD and carbonate analyses. All samples were vacuumdried and crushed with a ball mill. Major elements were measure d using the fused glass bead method and are presented as weight percent oxide proportions $\mathrm{(Na_{2}O,}$ $\mathrm{MgO_{\mathrm{{.}}}}$ , $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ , $\mathrm{SiO}_{2:}$ $\mathrm{P_{2}O_{5}}$ , $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ , CaO, $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ , MnO, and $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3})$ ). An aliquot of $0.9\:\mathrm{g}$ of ignited sample powder was fused with $4.5~\mathrm{g}$ of SmeltA12 flux for $7~\mathrm{min}$ at $1150^{\circ}C$ t o create glass beads. Loss on ignition was measured using weigh t changes on heating at $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $^{3\mathrm{~h~}}$ . Analyses were performed o n the wavelength dispersive XRF spectrometer Supermini (Rigaku ) equipped with a 200 W Pd anode $\mathrm{X}$ -ray tube at $50~\mathrm{kV}$ and $4~\mathrm{mA}$ . Analytical details and measuring conditions for each componen t are given in Table T5. Rock standards of the National Institute o f Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Geological Survey o f Japan) were used as the reference materials for quantitative analysis. Table T6 lists the results for selected standard samples. A calibration curve was created with matrix corrections provided by the operating software, using the average content of each component.

# Structural geology  

During Expedition 365, cores were recovered from Hole s C0010C–C0010E. With the exception of Core 365-C0010C-2R-2, which was split on board the ship during the expedition, all core s were stored in the core refrigerator on the Chikyu for examinatio n during the shore-based sampling party. Only XCT images an d MSCL-W analyses were conducted during the expedition. IW an d MBIO WR samples were collected after XCT watchdogs ensure d that no key structures were present in these intervals. The method s used to document the structural geology data of Expedition 36 5 cores are largely based on those used by previous NanTroSEIZE expeditions (e.g., Expedition 315 Scientists; 2009; Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010).  

# Description and data collection  

Structures preserved in the cores were documented on spli t cores and on XCT images of WR cores (see $\mathbf{X}$ -ray computed tomography). Observations on split cores were manually logged ont o the structural geology observation sheet (Figure F24; also se e STRUCTUR in Supplementary material) at the core descriptio n table and then transferred to both a calculation sheet and the JCORES database (see Data processing). Core observations an d measurements followed procedures from previous ODP and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program NanTroSEIZE expeditions (e.g., ODP Legs 131, 170, and 190 and Expeditions 315, 316, 319, 322, 333, 338, and 348).  

We measured the orientations of all structures observed in core s using a modified plastic protractor (Figure F25) and then noted th e measurements on the structural geology observation sheet alon g with descriptions and sketches of structures. The orientations o f planar or linear features in cores were defined with respect to th e core reference frame, where the core axis is oriented vertically an d the double line marked on the working half of the core liner is prescribed to be “north,” $0^{\circ}$ or $360^{\circ}$ (Figure F26). The orientations o f planes in the core reference frame were determined by measurin g the apparent dip angle of any planar feature in two independent sections parallel to the core axis. The 2-D orientation was then calculated using the two linear measurements (see Data processing). I n practice, one section is typically the split surface of the core, o n which the trace of the plane has a bearing $\left(\alpha_{1}\right)$ and a plunge angl e $(\upbeta_{1})$ in the core reference frame. $\upalpha_{1}$ is either $90^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ . The othe r section is, in most cases, a cut or fractured surface at a right or hig h angle to the split core surface, on which the bearing $\left(\alpha_{2}\right)$ and plung e angle $({\mathfrak{f}}_{2})$ of the trace of the plane are measured. In the case wher e the second measurement surface is at an angle to the core split surface, bearing $\upalpha_{2}$ is either $0^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$ (Figure F27). Both $\upbeta_{1}$ and $\upbeta_{2}$ ar e between $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ . Similar measurements were made for plana r features visible in XCT images.  

Linear features (e.g., slickenlines) were commonly observed o n planar structures (typically fault or shear surfaces). Their orientations were determined in the core reference frame by measuring either their bearing and plunge or their rakes (or pitches) $\left(\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ on th e planes (Figure F28). When using rakes, in order to avoid confusio n between two lines having the same rake but raking toward two opposite azimuths (e.g., a $\mathrm{N}45^{\circ}\mathrm{E}{-}60^{\circ}\mathrm{S}\mathrm{E}$ fault bearing two striations, one raking $30^{\circ}\mathrm{NE}$ and the other raking $30^{\circ}\mathrm{SW}$ ) we used the following convention, which applies for all cases except for subvertical planes. If the linear feature rakes from an azimuth between $\mathrm{N}1^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$

and $179^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ or between $\mathrm{N}181^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ and $\mathrm{N}359^{\circ}\mathrm{E}$ , then $90^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ , respectively, will follow the value of the rake. In the example shown in Figure F28, $270^{\circ}$ would be added after the $\Phi_{\mathrm{a}}$ value. In the case o f subvertical planes, $+1^{\circ}$ would follow the rake value to indicate rake s from the top of the core or $-1^{\circ}$ to indicate rakes from the bottom o f the core. The calculation sheet accounts for this information fo r data processing.  

All of the above-mentioned data as well as any necessary descriptive notes were recorded on the structural geology observatio n sheet.  

# Data processing  

# Orientation data calculation and true north correction  

A spreadsheet developed during NanTroSEIZE Expeditions 315, 316, 319, 322, 333, 338, and 348 was used to calculate orientatio n data in the core reference frame (Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 316 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 322 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 333 Scientists, 2012; Strasser et al., 2014; Tobin et al., 2015). Based on the measure d bearings ( $\lvert\alpha_{1}$ and $\upalpha_{2}$ ) and plunge angles $\operatorname{\mathrm{\mathrm{\boldmath~\beta~}}}\!\beta_{1}$ and $\upbeta_{2}$ , this spreadshee t determines the strikes and dip angles of the planar features in th e core reference frame. Because of drilling-induced core fragmentation (e.g., biscuiting) and ensuing core recovery and core preparation operations, the orientation of the core with respect to th e present-day magnetic north is not known. A correction routine i s therefore required to rotate orientations measured in the core reference frame to the magnetic reference frame. Paleomagnetic dat a were collected by the cryogenic magnetometer at the Kochi Cor e Center following the shore-based sampling party (see Paleomagnetism) and used to reorient structures and bedding observed in th e cores in cases where there was a paleomagnetic datum point withi n the same coherent interval. When paleomagnetic data are available, the spreadsheet further converts the core reference data to geographic coordinates.  

# J-CORES structural database  

The J-CORES database has a VCD program to store visual (macroscopic and/or microscopic) descriptions of core structures and  a record of planar structures in the core coordinate system. The orientations of such features are saved as comments or notes but d o not appear on the plots from the Composite Log Viewer. During th e Expedition 365 shore-based sampling party, only the locations o f structural features were entered in the J-CORES database, and orientation data management and analyses were performed separatel y with a spreadsheet as described above. Later, structural element s were converted to core-scale depictions using Strater software.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Core samples for biostratigraphy were sent to a shore-based scientist for analysis and reporting after the end of the sampling party.  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Calcareous nannofossils were used to date core catcher an d small discrete core samples.  

# Zonation and biohorizons  

The biostratigraphic zonation of calcareous nannofossils wa s based on the schemes of Martini (1971) and Okada and Bukr y (1980). The application of zonal markers and additional datum s here is mostly based on the compilation by Raffi et al. (2006), consistent with previous NanTroSEIZE expeditions (e.g., Expeditions 315, 316, 319, 322, and 333) for biostratigraphic consistency and subsequent correlation (Expedition 315 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 31 6 Scientists, 2009; Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010; Expedition 32 2 Scientists, 2010; Expeditions 333 Scientists, 2012).  

Each nannofossil datum was assigned an astronomically calibrated age compiled by Raffi et al. (2006) and followed original descriptions by these authors. The astrochronological framework fo r the Neogene follows the International Commission on Stratigraph y (ICS) 2004 timescale (Lourens et al., 2004). The timescale and biostratigraphic zones of calcareous nannofossils are summarized i n Figure F29 and Table T7.  

# Taxonomic remarks  

Taxonomy followed the compilation of Perch-Nielsen (1985 ) and Young (1998). Previous work suggested grouping species in th e reticulofenestrids, including genera Gephyrocapsa and Reticulofenestra, by size. This is because their species show a great variatio n in size and other morphological features (e.g., relative size of th e central opening and orientation of the bar in the case of Gephyrocapsa).

Accordingly, Gephyrocapsa is divided into three major group s by maximum coccolith length following biometric subdivision b y Rio (1982), Raffi et al. (1993), and Raffi (2002): small Gephyrocapsa $(<\!4\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ , medium Gephyrocapsa ( $\geq\!4$ to $<5.5~\upmu\mathrm{m}\rangle$ ), and large Gephyrocapsa spp. $(\geq\!5.5\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ ). Some important morphologic features (e.g., bar orientation) were also considered during the analysis. In addition, Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus should have a coccolit h length greater than $7\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Methods  

Samples were prepared for calcareous nannofossil analysis usin g standard smear slide methods and optical adhesive as a mountin g medium (Bown and Young, 1998). Smear slides were examined wit h an optical microscope at $1500\times$ magnification.  

The total abundance (per field of view [FOV]) of coccoliths fo r each sample was determined using the following scale:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ very abundant $>\!50$ specimens per FOV).   
$C=$ common (10–50 specimens per FOV).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1–10 specimens per 1–2 FOV).   
$+=$ present (1 specimen per 2 or more FOV).  

In order to investigate occurrences of other rare species in eac h sample, additional observations were made along three to four othe r transects of a smear slide. Nannofossil preservation was recorde d following the criteria originally provided by Steinmetz (1979):  

$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or overgrowth; only slight alteration of diagnostic characteristics; all taxa are easily identified).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (evident etching and/or overgrowth; no diagnostic changes).   
$\Gamma={\sf p o o r}$ (severe dissolution, fragmentation, and/or overgrowth; diagnostic characteristics largely destroyed; identification of most specimens difficult at the species and/or generic level).  

All information regarding the nannofossil assemblages an d preservation data are summarized in Table T12 in the Site C001 0 chapter (Saffer et al., 2017).  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic investigations were not performed on board the Chikyu during Expedition 365. The cores wer e sampled during the shore-based sampling party, and samples wer e later examined by an on-shore specialist after the shore-based sampling party was completed. These analyses were primarily designe d to  determine  characteristic  remanence  directions  for  use  i n magnetostratigraphic and structural studies.

# Discrete samples and sampling coordinates  

A total of 48 discrete samples were collected from Hole s C0010C–C0010E at a frequency of one sample per section $_{\sim140}$ cm). Magnetic measurements on the samples were then conducte d using a magnetometer (2G Enterprises, model 760) at JAMSTE C (Yokosuka, Japan). Natural remanent magnetization demagnetize d directions and intensities of all samples at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, and $80~\mathrm{mT}$ peak fields were measured.  

The relationship between the orientation of archive section an d that of a discrete sample is shown in Figure F30.  

# Magnetic reversal stratigraphy  

Whenever possible, magnetic polarity interpretations are provided with the naming convention following that of correlativ e anomaly numbers prefaced by the letter C (Tauxe et al., 1984). Normal polarity subchrons are referenced by adding suffixes (e.g., n1, n2, etc.) that increase with age. For the younger part of the timescal e (Pliocene–Pleistocene) traditional names are often used to refer t o the various chrons and subchrons (e.g., Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, etc.). The ages of the polarity intervals used during Expedition 36 5 are a composite of four previous magnetic polarity timescale s (magnetostratigraphic timescale for the Neogene by Lourens et al. [2004]).  

# Inorganic geochemistry  

Fluid splits of the OsmoSampler chemistry and biochemistr y coils were divided among the following shipboard analyses: chlorinity, alkalinity, major cations, anions, and minor and trace element s (Table T1; Figure F31). Additionally, a total of six IW samples fro m Holes C0010C and C0010E and were analyzed for chlorinity, alkalinity, major cations, anions, and minor and trace elements (Tabl e  

T8). WR cores were immediately taken from the catwalk to th e XCT laboratory to be scanned for important lithologic boundarie s and structures. The watchdog scientist viewed the composite sca n to determine size and sampling depth of each IW sample. Th e length of IW WR samples increased with depth, ranging from 21 t o $36\,\mathrm{cm}$ , because a greater volume of core was needed to produce sufficient IW for analysis as a result of decreasing porosity and increasing induration with depth. Each IW WR sample was taken to th e

quality assurance (QA)/QC laboratory and immediately remove d from the core liner into a nitrogen-flushed glove bag. The exterio r of the WR sample was then thoroughly cleaned of drilling contamination with a spatula, and the clean parts were placed into a Manheim-type titanium squeezer (Manheim, 1966) on top of two filte r papers rinsed with Millipore 18.2 Ω·cm Type 1 ultrapure (Milli-Q ) water placed on 2–4 320 mesh stainless steel screens. A Ti squeeze r with a $5.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ ID was used during Expedition 365. In a first step, th e stress was manually increased to squeeze the first drops of IW ou t before the sample was transferred to an automated hydraulic syste m where sediments were squeezed at ambient temperatures and load s of up to $6{,}804\,\mathrm{kg}$ to ensure that the interlayer water of clay mineral s was not released during the squeezing process. This IW was collected through the filters into a $60~\mathrm{mL}$ acid-washed plastic syring e that was attached to the bottom of the squeezer assembly. Afte r squeezing, the water was filtered through a $0.45~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ disposabl e PTFE filter into sample vials.  

Alkalinity and $\mathsf{p H}$ were determined by Gran titration with a p H electrode and a Metrohm autotitrator. Refractive index was measured with a RX-5000i refractometer (Atago) and converted to salinity based on repeated analyses of the International Association o f Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater. Thes e repeated measurements suggested a precision of $0.1\%$ .  

Chlorinity concentrations were determined by titration with silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ . This measurement includes concentrations o f dissolved chloride, bromide, and iodide. The dissolved chloride values reported here are the titration measurements minus concentrations of bromide determined by inductively coupled plasma–atomi c emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Iodide concentrations are assumed to be negligible. The average precision of this measurement, and all those listed below, was determined as 1σ standard deviatio n of the mean of multiple measurements of a standard. In this cas e precision was calculated from multiple measurements of IAPS O standard seawater and was determined to be $0.2\%$ of the value.  

Sulfate, bromide, nitrate, and nitrite concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatograph (Dionex ICS-2100) using samples tha t were diluted 1:100 with Milli-Q water. Several different dilutions o f IAPSO standard seawater were analyzed as a QC measure at the beginning, at an intermediate point during, and at the end of each run. These standards were used to compensate for instrument drift an d to calculate analytical precision. Precision for sulfate and bromid e was $1.1\%$ and $1.5\%$ , respectively. Limits of detection for sulfate, nitrate, and nitrite are 3, 8, and $18\;\upmu\mathrm{M},$ , respectively.  

Major cations (Mg, Ca, Na, and K) were analyzed by ICP-AE S (Horiba Jobin Yvon Ultima2). First, samples were acidified with $6\,\mathrm{M}$ HCl to a concentration of $0.4\%$ $(\mathrm{v/v})$ . A $5\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ aliquot was then dilute d with ultrapure water by a factor of 200 for the measurements. Standardization was achieved by successive dilution of IAPSO standar d seawater to $100\%$ , $75\%$ , $50\%$ , and $25\%$ relative to the 1:200 primar y dilution ratio. Analytical precision for each element was based o n repeated analyses of the $50\%$ dilution standard ( $\mathrm{Ca}\,=\,0.7\%$ , $\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}\,=$ $1.0\%$ , $\mathrm{Na}=0.7\%$ , and $\mathrm{{K}}=0.9\%$ ).  

To analyze the minor elements (B, Ba, Fe, Li, Mn, Si, and Sr),  a second aliquot of the previously acidified sample was further diluted by a factor of 20 ( $\mathrm{0.5\,mL}$ sample added to $9.5\;\mathrm{mL}$ of a $1\%$ nitri c acid solution containing yttrium as an internal standard at $10\,\mathrm{ppm}$ ). A standard dilution series was made from ultrapure primary standards (SPC Science PlasmaCAL) to concentrations of $100\%$ , $50\%$ , $25\%$ , $10\%$ , $5\%$ , and $1\%$ , all diluted with $1\%$ nitric acid. Because of th e high concentration of matrix salts in the IW samples at 1:20 dilution, matrix matching of the calibration standards was necessary t o achieve accurate results by ICP-AES. A matrix solution that approximated IAPSO standard seawater major ion concentrations was prepared by dissolving the following salts in $^\mathrm{~1~L~}$ of Milli-Q wate r acidified with $4~\mathrm{mL}$ of optima-grade 6 M HCl: $27\,\textrm{g N a C l},$ , $3.8\mathrm{~g~}$ $\mathrm{MgCl},$ , $1.0\ \mathrm{g}\ \mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ , and $0.75\ \mathrm{g}\ \mathrm{KCl}.$ . Sulfate was not added to th e matrix-matching solution because sulfate concentrations in thes e samples were relatively low compared to seawater. A $1.25~\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of each standard in the dilution series was then added to 8.7 5 mL of the matrix solution. These matrix standards were again diluted by a factor of 20 with the same $1\%$ nitric acid and $10\ \mathrm{ppm\Y}$ solution used with the samples. The final matrix-matched $100\%$ standard solution contained the following concentrations of elements: $\mathrm{B}=2891\,\upmu\mathrm{M},$ , $\mathrm{Li}=450.2\;\upmu\mathrm{M},$ $\mathrm{Si}=1113~\upmu\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{}}$ , $M_{\mathrm{n}}=56.88~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ , $\mathrm{Fe}\,=\,55.96~\upmu\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , $\mathrm{Sr}\,=\,356.7~\upmu\mathrm{M},$ , and $\mathrm{Ba}\,=\,227.6~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . This dilutio n series was used to create a calibration curve for each element. Th e average errors for minor element analyses were as follows: $B=1.4\%$ , $\mathrm{Ba}=\!1.0\%$ , $\mathrm{Fe}=2.2\%$ , $\mathrm{Mn}=1.2\%_{\mathrm{~\\}}$ , $\mathrm{Li}=2.5\%$ , $\mathrm{Si}=1.1\%_{1}$ , and $\mathrm{Sr}=1.2\%$ .  

Trace elements (V, Cu, Mo, Rb, Cs, Pb, $Z\mathfrak{n}$ , and U) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS ) (Agilent 7500ce ICP-MS) equipped with an octopole reaction system to reduce polyatomic and double-charge interferences. Sampl e aliquots were diluted to $10\%$ of their initial concentration with a $1\%$ nitric acid solution and an indium internal standard solution (50 0 $\upmu\mathrm{L}$ sample with $4.0\,\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\%$ nitric acid solution and $500\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a 50 0 ppb indium standard). A primary standard solution was made tha t matched the maximum range of predicted concentrations based o n published results of deep-sea pore fluid compositions in a variety o f settings. The composition of this standard was as follows: Cs, Cu, Mo, Pb, U, and $\mathrm{V}=40$ ppb; and $\mathrm{Rb}=500~\mathrm{ppb}$ . This primary standard was diluted in $1\%$ nitric acid solution to relative concentration s of $50\%$ , $25\%$ , $10\%$ , $5\%$ , and $1\%$ . A $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ aliquot of each serial dilution was further diluted with $3500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a $1\%\ \mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ solution, 50 0 $\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of $560\ \mathrm{mM}\ \mathrm{NaCl},$ , and $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of the $500~\mathrm{ppb}$ indium internal standard. The $25\%$ standard was diluted accordingly and analyze d every eight samples throughout every analysis series to determin e precision (errors were as follows: $\mathrm{Cs}=4.0\%$ , $\mathrm{Cu}=6.6\%$ , $M_{0}=0.4\%$ , $\mathrm{Pb}\,=\,10.5\%$ , $\mathrm{~U~}=5.2\%$ , $\mathrm{\DeltaV=1.6\%}$ , $\mathrm{Rb}\,=\,1.3\%$ ). A matrix blank wa s prepared with a NaCl concentration similar to IAPSO standard seawater values and analyzed to calibrate for interferences by the majo r ions $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ and $\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$ . A procedural blank consisting of $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ Milli- Q water, $4.0~\mathrm{mL}$ of $1\%$ nitric acid solution, and $500~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of the $500\;\mathrm{ppb}$ indium standard was analyzed every eight samples. Limits of detection were calculated from 10 analyses of the procedural blank $\operatorname{Cd}=$ $2.8\,\mathrm{nM}$ , $\mathsf{C o}=4.3\,\mathrm{nM}_{\sun}$ , ${\mathrm{Cu}}=2.1{\mathrm{\,nM}}$ , $\mathrm{Mo}=1.2\,\mathrm{nM}$ , $\mathrm{Pb}=0.14\:\mathrm{nM}$ , $\mathrm{U}=$ $0.01\;\mathrm{nM}_{\mathrm{{}}}$ , and $\mathrm{V}=3.7\;\mathrm{nM}$ ).

# Gas analysis  

After cutting the OsmoSampler coils for sampling, four $^{1\mathrm{~m~}}$ lengths were placed into $20\,\mathrm{~mL~}$ glass ampules and immediatel y sealed with a septum and metal crimp cap for hydrocarbon analyse s (Table T1). During coring operations, one hydrocarbon gas sampl e was collected from each core for standard shipboard headspac e measurements. Samples were collected from core sections that appeared to be relatively undisturbed by drilling. A $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sedimen t sample was collected in the core cutting area from the bottom of th e selected core section using a cut-off plastic syringe and was extruded into a $20~\mathrm{mL}$ glass vial that was immediately sealed with  a septum and metal crimp cap.  

All vials for hydrocarbon analyses were incubated at room temperature for at least $15\,\mathrm{h}$ and then at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$ before analysis. The coil samples were incubated at $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for an additional $30\;\mathrm{min}$ to ensure that all gas escaped the coil liner. The evolved ${\mathsf{C}}_{1}{-}{\mathsf{C}}_{4}$ gase s were analyzed using an Agilent 8890B gas chromatograph (GC ) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Chromatographi c response on the GC was calibrated against a one-point calibratio n curve, which was verified with additional authentic standards wit h variable quantities of low molecular weight hydrocarbons. A $400\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ volume of headspace gas was extracted from the vial using a standard gas syringe and injected into the GC. The methane concentration was derived from the headspace measurement using th e following equation, which assumes that quantities of undetecte d methane dissolved in the aqueous phase are minimal (e.g., Duan e t al., 1992):  

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}=(\upchi_{\mathrm{M}}\times P\times V_{\mathrm{H}})/(\up R\times T\times\Phi\times V_{\mathrm{S}}),
$$  

# where  

$V_{\mathrm{{H}}}=$ volume of the sample vial headspace (less the volume of the coil when appropriate, $3\,\mathrm{mL}$ ),   
${\cal V}_{\mathrm{S}}=$ volume of the whole sediment sample or coil volume,   
$\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{M}}=$ molar fraction of methane in the headspace gas (obtained from GC analysis),   
$P=$ pressure in the vial headspace (assumed to be the measured atmospheric pressure when the vials were sealed),   
${\mathbb R}=$ universal gas constant,   
$T\!=$ temperature of the vial headspace in Kelvin, and   
$\boldsymbol\Phi=$ sediment porosity (when appropriate, determined either from moisture and density [MAD] measurements on nearby samples or from porosity estimates derived from gamma ray attenuation [GRA] data representative of the sampled interval).  

# Core analysis  

Total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and total sulfur (TS ) were measured using samples from cores. Samples $\left({\sim}60~\mathrm{mg}\right)$ wer e freeze-dried under a vacuum and ground to powder. TC, TN, an d TS were determined using a Thermo Finnigan Flash elemental analysis (EA) 1112 carbon-hydrogen-nitrogen-sulfur analyzer. Calibration was based on the synthetic standard sulfanilamide, whic h contains 41.81 wt% C, $16.27\;\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , and $18.62\;\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{S}$ . A total of $15-$ $25~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment powder was weighed and placed in a tin container for carbon and nitrogen analyses. The same amount of powdered sediment was weighed for sulfur analysis and mixed with a n oxidizer (vanadium pentoxide $\left[{\mathrm{V}}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{5}\right],$ ) in a tin container. Sedimen t samples were combusted in an oxygen stream at $900^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for carbo n and nitrogen and $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for sulfur. The sample and container melt, and the tin promotes a violent reaction (flash combustion) in th e enriched oxygen stream. The combustion produced $\mathrm{CO}_{2},$ $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ , an d $\mathrm{NO}_{2},$ which were carried by a constant flow of carrier gas. Then, $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ was reduced to $\mathrm{N}_{2},$ and the mixture of $\Nu_{2},$ , $C\mathrm{O}_{2},$ and $S\mathrm{O}_{2}$ wa s separated using a GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The accuracy of the analysis was confirmed using soil NCS reference material (Thermo Scientific, Milan, Italy), sulfanilamid e standard (Thermo Scientific), and JMS-1 reference material.  

Total organic carbon is usually estimated by the difference between the TC value and inorganic carbon (IC) value. IC was determined with the same set of samples used for elemental analysis. Approximately $15{-}25\,\mathrm{~mg}$ of sediment powder was weighed an d acidified with $2\ \mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{HCl}$ to convert the carbonate to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . The released $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was titrated, and the change in light transmittance wa s measured with a photodetection cell. The weight percentage of calcium carbonate was calculated from the IC content, assuming tha t all evolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was derived from dissolution of calcium carbonate:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=I C\left(w t\%\right)\times100/12}.
$$  

No correction was made for the presence of other carbonat e minerals. Standard deviation for the samples was less than $\pm0.05$ $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . NIST-SRM 88b and JSD-2 were used as standard referenc e materials to check accuracy.

# FLOCS sampling  

The construction of the FLOCS and the substrates have bee n described previously (Figure F2B; Kopf et al., 2011). Briefly, th e FLOCS unit includes four chambers containing the following (in order from inlet to outlet): polished rock chips, crushed barite, crushed olivine, and clayey mudstone collected from Site C000 4 during Expedition 316 (Figure F32A). Basalt and olivine rock chip s were attached to two plastic slides using epoxy and were held i n place using glass beads and glass wool. Crushed minerals were hel d in place with PTFE mesh. Once removed from the GeniusPlug an d OsmoSampler, the FLOCS was wrapped in autoclaved aluminu m foil and brought into the shipboard anaerobic chamber, which had  a mixed atmosphere of nitrogen $(97.5\%)$ and hydrogen $(2.5\%)$ . Th e FLOCS was intact and in good condition (Figure F32B); however, most of the fluid had escaped from the chambers.  

Polished rock chips were sorted by rock type and preserved fo r scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These chips were transferre d to $2~\mathrm{mL}$ tubes containing $4\%$ paraformaldehyde in $1\times$ phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, diluted with seawater) and allowed to soak fo r $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $4^{\circ}C$ before being stored in a PBS:ethanol solution $(50{:}50\;[\mathrm{v/v}])$ at $4^{\circ}C.$ . The glass beads and glass wool surrounding the rock chi p slides were frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for postexpedition DNA analyses.  

Crushed minerals and clay sediment were sampled using autoclaved tweezers as follows: $35\%$ for DNA analyses, $25\%$ for culturin g analyses, $25\%$ for single-cell genomics (SCG), and $15\%$ for microscopy. Samples for DNA analyses were collected in $15~\mathrm{mL}$ conical tubes and frozen immediately at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Barite minerals were save d for SEM and preserved as described above. Olivine and sedimen t samples were preserved for microscopic cell counts. Approximatel y $0.5\,\mathrm{g}$ of each material was placed in a $2~\mathrm{mL}$ tube containing $1~\mathrm{mL}$ o f $4\%$ paraformaldehyde in $1\times$ PBS and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ without washing.

Material for culture experiments was divided between two 2 0 mL serum vials, each containing $10\,\mathrm{mL}$ of artificial seawater (ASW ) medium (Table T9) and incubated at room temperature. Four additional cultures were made from fluids scavenged from the FLOC S chamber $\mathrm{[2~mL}$ FLOCS fluids in $10~\mathrm{mL}$ ASW medium, two replicates) and iron precipitates scraped from the inside of the GeniusPlug’s casing $^{(0.5\,\mathrm{~mL}}$ scrapings in $10~\mathrm{~mL~}$ ASW medium, tw o replicates).  

Crushed minerals aliquoted for SCG analyses were transferre d to $15~\mathrm{mL}$ tubes containing $3.5~\mathrm{mL}$ of filtered $1\times$ PBS. Tubes wer e inverted several times over a period of $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ , vortexed for $_{30\,\mathrm{s}}$ at hig h speed, and centrifuged for $_{30\,\mathsf{s}}$ at 2000 rotations/min. The supernatant was then divided into three cryovials as $1~\mathrm{mL}$ replicates. Eac h cryovial received $100~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of glyTE stock solution (Table T10; Singl e Cell Genomic Center, 2014). Finally, the cryovials were inverted an d incubated at room temperature for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ and stored at $-80^{\circ}C,$ . An y cells that may have been caught on the PTFE mesh were also preserved for SCG. All microbiology samples were preserved for onshore analyses at their shipboard storage temperatures.  

A total of two fluid samples from the chemistry and biology coil s of the OsmoSampler were aliquoted for cell counts. These flui d samples were diluted with an equal volume of $4\%$ paraformaldehyd e in $1\!\times\!\mathrm{PBS}$ and then stored and shipped at $4^{\circ}C$ .  

# Microscopy  

FLOCS cultures were analyzed for microbial life after an incubation time of 6 days. In the anaerobic chamber, a volume of $250~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ was sampled from each culture. This volume was filtered onto a 0. 2 $\upmu\mathrm{M}$ GTTP Isopore membrane filter (Millipore). Filters were the n

stained for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ with a $1\times\mathrm{{SYBR}}$ Green I solution (Life Technologies) diluted with a $1\times$ Tris-EDTA (TE) solution. Filters wer e washed with ultrapure water for $10\;\mathrm{min}$ . The filters were dried an d mounted on a slide with Type F immersion oil. Slides were observe d using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescent microscope equipped with th e fluorescent filter set of $485/20\;\;\mathrm{nm}$ for excitation (center wavelength/bandwidth) and $515\;\mathrm{nm}$ for emission.  

# Whole-round sampling  

WR cores were first scanned by the XCT scanner and reviewe d for structural quality and to identify intact core material while als o avoiding regions of interest for later analyses related to other key expedition objectives. Areas demonstrating minimal drilling disturbance and void spaces were selected for microbiology samples. W R sections were cut in the core processing laboratory and immediatel y transported to the shipboard anaerobic chamber. Within the chamber, cores were removed from the core liner and the outer portion o f each WR was shaved off to minimize the risk of contamination o f the core interior by drilling fluid. The remaining central portion o f each WR sample was then divided for cultivation assays, microbial cell counts, SCG, and DNA extractions.  

A total of $1~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of each WR was added to $9~\mathrm{mL}$ of $4\%$ paraformaldehyde in $1\times\,\mathrm{PBS}$ for cell enumeration. Samples were vortexed on high for $_{30\,\mathsf{s}}$ and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ . A total of $1\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of each W R sample was also diluted in $4~\mathrm{mL}$ filtered $1\times$ PBS for SCG. Thes e samples were handled as described above. Two replicate culture experiments were made from each WR by inoculating $10\,\mathrm{mL}$ of anaerobic ASW medium (Table T9) with $1\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ of sediment, and culture s were incubated at room temperature. The remaining sediment wa s saved for DNA analyses and frozen at $-80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

# Contamination tests for whole-round sampling  

Contamination tests for core samples were carried out by chemical tracer quantification. Perfluorocarbon tracer (PFT; perfluoromethylcyclohexane, $\mathrm{C_{7}F_{14}}$ ) was supplied directly to drilling mu d that was used to sweep Holes C0010C and C0010E. PFT measurements followed the protocol outlined in Smith et al. (2000) wit h slight modifications. Two $2.5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ plugs of sediment were collecte d from core sections directly adjacent to MBIO WR samples to evaluate drilling fluid intrusion into the cores. One sample was take n from the outer edges and the second was taken from the center o f the remaining core. The sediment plugs were placed into $20\;\mathrm{mL}$ vials and sealed with silicone septa and metal crimp caps. Headspac e vials were incubated for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ prior to measurement. Samples were analyzed by a GC with an electron capture detector (Network GC System 7890B, Agilent Technologies) connected to a n autosampler (Network Headspace Sampler G1888, Agilent Technologies). The following equation was used to determine th e amount of drill-water intrusion in each sample (Smith et al., 2000):  

$$
(P_{\mathrm{s}}-P_{\mathrm{b}})/(C_{\mathrm{DW}}\times a\times W\times F_{\mathrm{l}}),
$$  

where  

$P_{\mathrm{{s}}}=$ integrated peak area of PFT in sample (in arbitrary units), $P_{\mathrm{b}}=\$ integrated peak area of PFT in blank (in arbitrary units), $^a=$ slope derived from the calibration curve (in arbitrary units per gram),   
$\begin{array}{r}{C_{\mathrm{Dw}}=}\end{array}$ concentration of PFT in drilling fluid (in grams per liter), $W=$ weight of sample (in grams), and   
$F_{\mathrm{I}}=$ fraction of the total headspace gas injected.  

$F_{\mathrm{{I}}}$ was calculated as  

$$
F_{\mathrm{I}}=V_{\mathrm{inj}}/[V_{\mathrm{vial}}-(W/\uprho)],
$$  

where  

$V_{\mathrm{inj}}=$ volume of sample injected (in liters), $V_{\mathrm{vial}}=$ volume of vial (in liters), $\uprho=$ sample density (in grams per liter), and $W=$ weight of sample (in grams).  

# Physical properties  

Physical property measurements provide key parameters fo r characterization of consolidation state and deformation of rock formations and are an important tool for integrating information fro m core, cuttings materials, and LWD. In addition, physical propertie s are indicators for composition and environmental conditions an d are essential for stratigraphic correlation (Blum, 1997), evaluation o f flow properties, and more generally for formation evaluation.  

Cores were first scanned by XCT and then thermally equilibrated at room temperature for approximately $^{3\,\mathrm{h}}$ before any physical  property  measurements  were  conducted.  Nondestructiv e measurements on WR sections included GRA density, magneti c susceptibility, natural gamma radiation (NGR), and ultrasonic $P_{-}$ - wave velocity using the MSCL-W (GeoTek Ltd., London, Unite d Kingdom). Noncontact electrical resistivity (NCR) is normally par t of the MSCL-W measurement suite but was not included durin g Expedition 365 because of a malfunction of the NCR system. Following MSCL-W measurements, cores were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ , capped, and sealed. All other physical properties measurements were deferred until the shore-based sampling party held from 26 July to  5 August 2016, when the cores were split. The measurements included MAD, electrical conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocity. Halfround MSCL measurements were performed on the archive halve s of split cores to obtain photo imagery and color spectroscopy dat a (see MSCL-l: photo image logger (archive half) and MSCL-C : color spectroscopy (archive half)).  

# MSCL-W (whole-round cores)  

# Gamma ray attenuation density  

A well-collimated gamma ray beam (primary photon energy o f $662\;\mathrm{keV})$ is produced from a small $(370\,\mathrm{{MBq})}$ ) $^{137}\!C s$ source. The intensity of the beam is measured across the core with a scintillatio n detector that is composed of a scintillation crystal and an integrate d photomultiplier tube. The first-order mechanism for GRA is inelastic scattering by electrons, resulting in a partial energy loss (Compton  effect).  Because  it  is  directly related  to  electron  density, sediment bulk density $(\rho_{\mathrm{b}})$ can be determined from the amount o f attenuation by  

$$
\rho_{\mathrm{b}}=1/(\upmu d)\times\ln(I_{0}/I),
$$  

where  

$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, $d=$ sample thickness or outer liner diameter, $I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity, and $I=$ measured intensity through the sample.  

Accordingly, the GRA method can provide information abou t bulk rock density by measuring the attenuation of a gamma ra y beam that passes through a core. Here, an empirical approach i s used to relate bulk density and GRA. The system is calibrated with  a special calibration “core section,” comprising a set of aligned aluminum cylinders of various diameters surrounded by distilled water i n a sealed core liner. Density (ρ) depends on the diameter of the aluminum cylinder and spans from $\rho\,=\,1\mathrm{{\g}/{c m}^{3}}$ (only water) to 2.7 1 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ (only aluminum). For calibration measurements, gamma ra y counts were taken for each aluminum cylinder once per second fo r $60~\mathrm{s}_{\mathrm{z}}$ ; these values were then averaged. The resulting $\ln(I)$ was plotted against the product of the known parameters $\uprho$ and $^d$ of the calibration core section and fitted with a regression curve:  

$$
\ln(I)=A(\rho\times d)^{2}+B(\rho\times d)+C,
$$  

where $^d$ is the internal diameter of the liner and $A,B.$ , and $C$ are coefficients determined from the polynomial equation fit. Densit y measurements were conducted perpendicular to the core axis ever y $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The gamma source collimator is $5~\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter, so eac h data point reflects the properties of the surrounding $5\;\mathrm{mm}$ interval, corresponding to a maximum volume of investigation of about 15. 6 $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# P-wave velocity  

Ultrasonic $P_{-}$ -wave velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ was measured for WR cores b y measuring sonde length $(d)$ (outer liner diameter) and traveltim e $\left(t_{0}\right)$ :  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{0}.
$$  

A linear variable differential transformer, used to measure th e liner thickness, is integrated with a $230\;\mathrm{kHz}\,P$ -wave transmitter/receiver system. The system is mounted horizontally on the MSCL- W system and measures $^d$ and $t_{0}$ perpendicular to the core axis at $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals. The measured traveltime $\left(t_{0}\right)$ between the transducers i s delayed by the pulse traveltime through the liner, the threshold pea k detection procedure, and the pulse travel between transducers an d the electronic circuitry. Traveltime is corrected for these parameters by calibrating the system using a core liner filled with pure water, which has a known $P$ -wave velocity $\left(1480\,\mathrm{\m/s}\right)$ at $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\prime}$ ). Th e corrected $P$ -wave velocity through the core $\left(V_{\mathrm{core}}\right)\,(\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s})$ is  

$$
V_{\mathrm{core}}=(d-{\cal W})/[t_{0}-t_{\mathrm{w}}-(d-{\cal W})/V_{\mathrm{w}}],
$$  

where  

$W=$ total wall thickness of the core liner, $t_{\mathrm{w}}=$ measured traveltime through the water-filled calibration liner, and $V_{\mathrm{w}}=\operatorname{known}P$ -wave velocity of pure water at room temperature.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility is the degree to which a material can b e magnetized by an external magnetic field. Magnetic susceptibilit y was measured with a Bartington Instrument MS2C system with a n $8\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter loop sensor on the MSCL-W. A nonsaturating, lowintensity alternating magnetic field $(8.0\,\times\,10^{-4}\,\mathrm{\mA/m}$ root mea n square at $0.565\;\mathrm{kHz}$ ) is produced by an oscillator circuit in the sensor. Any material near the sensor that has a magnetic susceptibilit y causes a change in the oscillator frequency. This pulse frequency i s then converted into a magnetic susceptibility value. With a reference piece of known magnetic susceptibility, the long-term consistency of the calibration is checked regularly. The spatial resolutio n of the loop sensor is ${\sim}4~\mathrm{cm}$ with an accuracy of $5\%$ . Magnetic susceptibility data were obtained at $4\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals with an acquisitio n time of $_{1\,s}$ .  

# Natural gamma radiation  

NGR emissions were measured on all core sections to determin e variations in the radioactive counts. The NGR system records radioactive decays of long-period isotopes $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}_{\cdot}$ , and $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ in  a lead-shielded detector unit. The unit is composed of a scintillator, which is coupled to a photomultiplier tube and connected to a bia s base that supplies high-voltage power and a signal preamplifier. Two horizontal and two vertical detection units were mounted in  a lead cube-shaped housing around the core. NGR was measured every $16\;\mathrm{cm}$ for $_{30\,\mathrm{s}}$ on core sections.  

# Moisture and density measurements  

Index properties, including bulk density, dry density, grain density, water content, and porosity, were derived from wet and dr y mass and dry volume, measured on discrete samples from core section working halves. One or two samples were taken from ever y working half core section, each with an approximate volume of 1 0 $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The sampling interval was dependent on lithology and interna l sedimentological  structures.  Additionally,  MAD  samples  wer e taken as a part of routine “cluster” samples adjacent to WR sample s that also included samples for carbonate, XRD, and XRF analyses.  

Bulk density, dry density, grain density, porosity, and void rati o were calculated by Method C as described in Blum (1997). Wet an d dry masses were measured using a paired electronic balance system, which compensates for the ship’s heave. The sample mass was counterbalanced with a precisely known mass that was within $5\:\mathrm{g}$ of th e sample mass. The balance system has a precision of $\pm0.01\,\mathrm{g}$ , and th e balance system was calibrated daily during the sampling party. Immediately after sampling, wet sediment mass $(M_{\mathrm{t}})$ was measured. Care was taken to avoid sampling drilling mud, and any water o r drilling mud on the surfaces of the sample was carefully removed. Sediment dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{d}})$ was determined after drying $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ in a convection oven at $105\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ . The dried samples were cooled in a desiccator for $1\ \mathrm{h}$ before their dry mass was measured. Dry volume wa s measured using the Quantachrome helium displacement pycnometer with a nominal precision of $\pm0.04~\mathrm{cm^{3}},$ , and all pycnometer values were averaged over five measurements. During each run,  a reference sphere was measured to check for systematic errors.  

Water content, porosity, and void ratio were defined by the water mass or volume difference before and after the drying process. Standard seawater density $(1.024\;\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ was assumed for pore water density.  

# Water content  

Water content $(W_{\mathrm{c}})$ was determined according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D2216. Water content measurements  for  marine  samples  require  corrections  for  salt. Additionally, the percent water weight was calculated. The equations for water content are as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{W_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\%\mathrm{\wet\,wt}\right)=\left(M_{\mathrm{t}}-M_{\mathrm{d}}\right)\times\left(1+\mathrm{r}\right)/M_{\mathrm{t}},}\end{array}
$$  

where  

$\textstyle M_{\mathrm{t}}=$ total mass of the saturated sample, $\ensuremath{M_{\mathrm{d}}}=$ mass of the dried sample, and $\mathbf{r}=$ salinity (per mil).  

# Bulk density  

Bulk density (ρ) of the soil is the ratio of total mass to total volume:  

$$
\rho=M_{\mathrm{t}}/V_{\mathrm{t}},
$$  

where $V_{\mathrm{t}}=$ total sample volume.  

Total mass was measured using the balance, and total volum e $\left(V_{\mathrm{t}}\right)$ was determined from the pycnometer measurements grain volume $\mathbf{\nabla}(V_{\mathrm{d}})$ and the calculated pore fluid volume $(V_{\mathrm{pore}})$ :  

$$
V_{\mathrm{t}}=V_{\mathrm{pore}}+V_{\mathrm{d}}.
$$  

# Porosity  

Porosity $(\Phi)$ is the ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume of the soil:  

$$
\Phi=(W_{\mathrm{c}}\uprho)/[(1+W_{\mathrm{c}})\uprho_{\mathrm{w}}],
$$  

where  

$\uprho_{\mathrm{w}}=$ density of the pore fluid, and   
${W_{\mathrm{c}}}=$ water content expressed as a decimal ratio of percent dry weight.  

# Grain density  

Grain density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{grain}})$ was determined from dry mass and dry volume measurements made with the gas pycnometer and the balance. Mass and volume were corrected for salt:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{grain}}=(M_{\mathrm{d}}-s)/[V_{\mathrm{d}}-(s/\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})],}\end{array}
$$  

where  

$s=$ salt content (in grams), $\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}}=$ density of salt $(2.257\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ , and $V_{\mathrm{d}}=$ volume of the dried sample.  

# Void ratio  

Void ratio $(e)$ is the ratio of the volume of voids to the volume o f solids:  

$$
e=V_{\mathrm{pore}}/V_{\mathrm{d}},
$$  

where $V_{\mathrm{pore}}=$ volume of fluid.  

# Electrical conductivity and $P.$ -wave velocity  

Electrical conductivity and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements wer e performed on approximately $15\;\mathrm{mm}\times15\;\mathrm{mm}\times15\;\mathrm{mm}$ cubic samples cut from the working half. All cubes/cuboid faces were cut orthogonal to the $x_{\mathrm{~}},y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axes of the core reference. This threecomponent measurement plan enables first-order estimation o f anisotropy in both electrical conductivity and $P$ -wave velocity. Th e axis orientation is the same as defined for structural geology an d paleomagnetism, with the $z$ -axis pointing down along the core axis, $y$ perpendicular to the $z$ -axis within the core face, and $_{\mathscr{x}}$ perpendicular to the $z$ -axis pointing into the working half. The measurement s followed the approach of Carlson and Christensen (1977).  

# Electrical conductivity  

Samples were measured between two stainless steel electrode s covered with filter paper soaked in $35~\mathrm{g/L}$ NaCl solution. Electrica l impedance was measured with a $40{-}10~\mathrm{MHz}$ frequency sweep between opposite cube faces with an Agilent 4494A precision impedance analyzer using a 16451B measuring unit. Along every axi s three measurements were taken. The impedance corresponding t o $25\;\mathrm{kHz}$ was entered into the J-CORES database. The impedance o f each configuration was calculated by subtracting the impedance o f the coupling from the measured impedance. The coupling impedance was measured by stacking the two water-saturated filter s against each other before the impedance measurement. Sample resistivity along a given axis $(R_{\mathrm{x}},R_{\mathrm{y}},$ and $R_{\mathrm{z}}$ ) was calculated from th e measured impedance, phase angle and the sample dimensions by  

$$
R_{\mathrm{x}}=(L_{\mathrm{y}}L_{\mathrm{z}})/L_{\mathrm{x}}[Z_{\mathrm{x}}\mathrm{cos}(\Theta_{\mathrm{x}})-Z_{\mathrm{filter}}\mathrm{cos}(\Theta_{\mathrm{filter}})],
$$  

where  

$L_{\mathrm{x}},L_{\mathrm{y}},$ and $L_{\mathrm{z}}=$ length of cubic discrete sample in the $x_{\mathrm{~}},y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ and $z$ -direction, respectively,   
$Z_{\mathrm{x}}=$ electrical impedance,   
$\uptheta_{\mathrm{x}}=$ phase angle,   
$Z_{\mathrm{filter}}=$ measured impedance of the filter, and   
$\theta_{\mathrm{filter}}=$ measured phase angle of the filter.  

Electrical conductivity $(\sigma_{\mathrm{x}},\,\sigma_{\mathrm{y}},$ or ${\upsigma}_{\mathrm{z}},$ ) is also commonly reporte d and is simply the inverse of the resistivity:  

$$
\upsigma_{\mathrm{i}}=1/R_{\mathrm{i}}.
$$  

The horizontal plane anisotropy $\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{Rhor}}\right)$ and vertical plane anisotropy $(\upalpha_{\mathrm{Rvert}})$ of electrical resistivity calculations compare the horizontal $\scriptstyle{\left[x\right]}$ and $y$ ) and vertical $(z)$ components of electrical resistivit y expressed as a percentage of the mean:  

$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{Rvert}}\,(\%)=200[(R_{\mathrm{x}}+R_{\mathrm{y}})/2-R_{\mathrm{z}}]/[(R_{\mathrm{x}}+R_{\mathrm{y}})/2+R_{\mathrm{z}}],
$$  

where $R_{\mathrm{x}},R_{\mathrm{y}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{z}}$ are the electrical resistivity in the $x_{\mathrm{~}},\,y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ - direction, respectively.  

# P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity was measured with the $P$ -wave logger for discrete samples (GeoTek). The logger consists of two transducers, which act as transmitter and receiver. The transducer had a resonant frequency of $230\,\mathrm{kHz}$ . The sample height was measured with  a laser distance sensor. The transmitting transducer was connected t o a pulse generator, and the receiving transducer was connected to a n oscilloscope. The oscilloscope signal was displayed digitally and th e first $P$ -wave arrival can be picked manually. The sample was place d between the transducers and the receiving $P$ -wave was recorded. $P_{-}$ - wave velocity in a given direction (i.e., $V_{\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{x}}})$ was calculated using th e following equation:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{px}}=L_{\mathrm{x}}/(t_{\mathrm{x}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}),
$$  

where  

$L_{\mathrm{x}}=$ sample length, $t_{\mathrm{x}}=$ total traveltime, and $t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ system-calibrated delay time.  

The traveltime delay was determined by placing the transmitte r and transducer in direct contact and measuring traveltime. Th e transducer/receiver unit and the laser distance sensor calibratio n were checked daily using measuring standards.  

The horizontal plane anisotropy $\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{VPhor}}\right)$ and vertical plan e anisotropy $\scriptstyle\left(\alpha_{\mathrm{VPvert}}\right)$ of $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity calculations compare the horizontal $\scriptstyle{\left[x\right]}$ and $y$ ) and vertical $(z)$ components of $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity expressed as a percentage of the mean:  

$$
\alpha_{\mathrm{VPvert}}\,(\%)=200[(V_{\mathrm{px}}+V_{\mathrm{py}})/2-V_{\mathrm{pz}}]/[(V_{\mathrm{px}}+V_{\mathrm{py}})/2+V_{\mathrm{pz}}],
$$  

where $V_{\mathrm{p_{x}}},\,V_{\mathrm{p_{y}}},$ and $V_{\mathrm{p_{z}}}$ are the $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity in the $x_{\mathrm{~}},\,y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ , and $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ - direction, respectively.  

# Thermal conductivity  

Thermal conductivity was measured on the working half using  a half-space line source (Vacquier, 1985), which approximates an infinite line source. A Teka TK04 mini HLQ probe was used for thermal conductivity measurements. The half-space probe was place d directly on the split core with the line source oriented parallel to th e core axis. The measurement took place after the core had equilibrated to room temperature. Thus before every measurement, th e sediment temperature was monitored to ensure that thermal drif t was $<\!0.4\,\mathrm{mK/min}$ . After temperature equilibration, a calibrated hea t impulse was applied, and the rise in temperature was recorded fo r $60\;\mathrm{s}$ . The source power was adjusted to the thermal conductivity o f the sample to optimize the measurement results. Thermal conductivity was based on the observed rise in temperature for a give n quantity of heat. The probe was checked daily by measuring standards.  

# MSCL-l: photo image logger (archive half)  

The GeoTek photo image logger (MSCL-I) scans the surface o f the archive half and creates a digital image. The line-scan camer a (Nikon Lens: AF Nikkor $50\ \mathrm{mm\1:1.8D}_{\mathrm{~}}$ ) is equipped with thre e charge-coupled devices, each with 2048 arrays. The reflected ligh t from the core surface is split into three channels (red, blue, an d green) by a beam splitter inside the line-scan camera. The signal s are combined and the digital image is processed. A correction i s made for any mechanical differences among the charge-coupled device responses. Calibrations are conducted before scanning eac h core to compensate for pixel-to-pixel response variation, uneve n lightning, and lens effects. Optical distortion is avoided by precis e movement of the camera, and the spatial resolution is 100 pixels/cm.  

# MSCL-C: color spectroscopy (archive half)  

The GeoTek color spectroscopy logger (MSCL-C) system i s equipped with a color spectrophotometer (Konica Minolta, CM2600d). The spectrophotometer moves along the split core surfac e and takes a measurement every $4\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The reflected light is collecte d in the color spectrophotometer’s integration sphere and divide d into wavelengths at a $10\ \mathrm{nm}$ pitch $(360{-}740\ \mathrm{nm})$ . The color spectrum is then normalized by the source light of the reflectance an d calibrated with the measurement of a pure white standard. Th e measured color spectrum is normally converted to lightness $(\mathbf{L}^{*})$ and chromaticity variables $\mathbf{a}^{\ast}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ (see Blum [1997] for details). These parameters can provide information on relative changes i n bulk material composition that are useful for stratigraphic correlation and to identify lithologic characteristics and cyclicity of lithologic changes.
