# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 37 1 drilled six sites in the Tasman Sea of the southwest Pacific betwee n 27 July and 26 September 2017. The primary goal was to understan d Tonga-Kermadec subduction initiation through recovery of Paleogene sediment records. Secondary goals involved understanding regional oceanography and climate since the Paleogene. Six sites wer e drilled, recovering $2506~\mathrm{m}$ of cored sediment and volcanic rock i n 36.4 days of on-site drilling during a total expedition length of 5 8 days. Wireline logs were collected at two sites. Shipboard observations made using cores and logs represent a substantial gain in fundamental knowledge about northern Zealandia, because only Dee p Sea Drilling Project Sites 206, 207, and 208 had penetrated beneat h upper Eocene strata within the region.  

The cored intervals at five  sites (U1506–U1510) sample d nannofossil and foraminiferal ooze or chalk that contained volcani c or volcaniclastic intervals with variable clay content. Paleocene an d Cretaceous sections range from more clay rich to predominantl y claystone. At the final site (U1511), a sequence of abyssal clay an d diatomite was recovered with only minor amounts of carbonate. The ages of strata at the base of each site were middle Eocene t o Late Cretaceous, and our new results provide the first firm basis fo r defining formal lithostratigraphic units that can be mapped across  a substantial part of northern Zealandia and related to onshore regions of New Caledonia and New Zealand.  

The material and data recovered during Expedition 371 enabl e primary scientific goals to be accomplished. All six sites provide d new stratigraphic and paleogeographic information that can be pu t into context through regional seismic-stratigraphic interpretatio n and hence provide strong constraints on geodynamic models o f subduction zone initiation. Our new observations can be directl y related to the timing of plate deformation, the magnitude and timing of vertical motions, and the timing and type of volcanism. Secondary paleoclimate objectives were not all completed as planned, but significant new records of southwest Pacific climate were obtained.  

# Introduction  

The Tasman Frontier represents an extensive and under-explored area of the ocean between Australia, New Zealand, and Ne w Caledonia (Figure F1). The primary goal of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 371 was to understand Tonga-Kermadec  subduction  initiation  through  recovery  of  Paleogen e sediment records at six new sites across the Tasman Frontier (Figures F1, F2, F3, F4).  

Subduction systems are primary drivers of plate motions, mantle dynamics, and global geochemical cycles, but little is know n about how subduction starts. What are the initial conditions? Ho w do forces and kinematics evolve? What are the short-term consequences and surface signatures: uplift, subsidence, deepwater sedimentary basins, convergence, extension, and volcanism? The earl y Eocene onset of subduction in the western Pacific was accompanie d by a profound global reorganization of tectonic plates, with know n plate motions before and after the change (Billen and Gurnis, 2005; Sharp and Clague, 2006; Steinberger et al., 2004; Whittaker et al., 2007). The Izu-Bonin-Mariana (e.g., IODP Expeditions 350, 351, and 352) and Tonga-Kermadec systems contain complementary information about subduction initiation (Figure F1), but the southwest Pacific has had little relevant drilling.  

Eocene tectonic change occurred at a turning point in Cenozoi c climate. Long-term global warming through the Paleocene–Eocen e transition culminated in the Early Eocene Climate Optimu m (EECO; ${\sim}53{-}49\$ Ma), which was followed by  overall coolin g through the remainder of the Cenozoic (Figure F5) (Zachos et al., 2008). A secondary scientific goal of Expedition 371 was to addres s the question of why Earth’s climate might move between multimillion-year greenhouse and icehouse climate states. Under very hig h $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ conditions or high climate sensitivity, global climate model s (Huber and Caballero, 2011; Lunt et al., 2012) can reasonably simulate early Eocene warming in many regions (Douglas et al., $2014;$ Tripati et al., 2003) but not the extreme warmth previously reporte d in the southwest Pacific and Southern Ocean (Bijl et al., 2009; Holli s et al., 2009, 2012; Pross et al., 2012).  

The Eocene–Oligocene transition and Neogene paleoceanography have been subjects of numerous scientific drilling expeditions, including Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Legs 21, 29, an d 90 in the Tasman Sea (Figure F2), which were highly influential i n the development of ideas that connected regional oceanograph y with thermal isolation and glaciation of Antarctica and hence global climate change (Burns and Andrews, 1973; Kennett, 1977; Kennet t et al., 1975; Kennett and von der Borch, 1986). Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 181 and 189 further investigated the Eocene–Oligocene opening of the southern Tasman Sea gateway (Carter et al., 2004; Exon et al., 2004b). However, the significance of unconformities in the Tasman Sea has not, so far, included consideration of regional vertical tectonics or local faulting (Sutherland et al., 2010, 2017). Records from the Tasman Sea may also offer insights into understanding Neogene paleoceanography across the Pacific and phenomena such as the late Miocene–early Pliocene biogenic bloo m (Farrell et al., 1995; Grant and Dickens, 2002).  

# Scientific background  

# Subduction initiation and global plate tectonics  

Subduction initiation and changes in plate motion are linked because the largest driving and resisting tectonic forces occur withi n subduction zones (Becker and O’Connell, 2001; Buffett, 2006; Lithgow-Bertelloni and Richards, 1998; Stadler et al., 2010). There ar e two end-member classes of subduction initiation models: induce d or spontaneous (Stern, 2004) (Figure F6). In the spontaneou s model, oceanic lithosphere ages, cools, increases in density an d gravitational instability, and sinks into the mantle under its ow n weight (Stern and Bloomer, 1992; Turcotte et al., 1977). In the induced model, externally applied compressive stress and convergence  is  necessary  to  overcome  lithospheric  strength  befor e convective instability can grow and subduction initiation occur s (McKenzie, 1977; Toth and Gurnis, 1998).  

Half of all presently active subduction zones on Earth initiate d during the Cenozoic (Gurnis et al., 2004), so it is possible to assemble observations to address the question of how and why these margins evolved into self-sustaining subduction zones. Recent drillin g results from Expedition 351 shed new light on this question, an d new models suggest juxtaposition of a transcurrent fault and relic t arc could have led to Izu-Bonin-Mariana subduction initiation jus t before $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Leng and Gurnis, 2015). Subduction initiation at  a passive continental margin has received considerable attentio n through the concept of a Wilson cycle (a class of the spontaneou s model), but there are no known Cenozoic examples of passive margins evolving into subduction zones (Stern, 2004). Spontaneous an d induced models predict different states of stress and vertical motions during their early stages, and the aim to distinguish these underpinned our drilling strategy.  

The largest change in global plate motions since $83\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (the onl y period with precisely known plate kinematics) is manifest as th e Emperor-Hawaii seamount chain bend (Figure F1). Geochronolog y shows that the Emperor-Hawaii bend started at ${\sim}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and ma y have occurred over ${\sim}8$ My (Sharp and Clague, 2006). The onset o f Pacific plate motion change corresponds to the timing of Pacific/Farallon plate boundary rearrangement (Caress et al., 1988 ) and termination of spreading in the Tasman Sea (Gaina et al., 1998), followed by a change in direction and rapid increase in rate of Australia-Antarctic spreading with consequent northward acceleratio n of Australia (Müller et al., 2000; Seton et al., 2012; Whittaker et al., 2007) and initiation of Australia-Pacific spreading south of Ne w Zealand (Keller, 2003; Sutherland, 1995; Wood et al., 1996). Eocen e emplacement of ophiolites and deformed flysch may record the onset of convergence in New Caledonia (Aitchison et al., 1995). Reconfiguration of plate boundaries in Antarctica (Cande et al., 2000), the Indian Ocean (Cande et al., 2010), and Asia (Aitchison et al., 2007) confirms the global extent of tectonic change.  

The westward swerve in Pacific plate motion occurred at abou t the same time as subduction zones initiated throughout the wester n Pacific (Gurnis et al., 2004; Hall et al., 2003; Steinberger et al., 2004). It is the only global-scale subduction initiation event for which plat e motions are known before and after, and there is a clear linkage between subduction initiation and plate motion change. Reconstructing what happened in the western Pacific is of fundamenta l significance for understanding subduction initiation and hence th e physics of plate tectonics and mantle flow.  

# Eocene greenhouse climate  

Paleogene sediment records have provided new insights int o Earth’s climate history and underpin predictions of future greenhouse climate (Lunt et al., 2014). Available data indicate that $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ exceeded 1000 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in the early Eocene (Beerling and Royer, 2011), when global temperatures wer e ${\sim}10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warmer than present day and the poles were largely free o f ice (Zachos et al., 2008; Pagani et al., 2011; Pearson et al., 2009). Climate model simulations, using either very high greenhouse gas radiative forcing or very high climate sensitivity, yield mean annua l temperatures consistent with most data for the early Eocene (Hube r and Caballero, 2011; Lunt et al., 2012). However, at several sites i n the southwest Pacific, both on and off shore (e.g., from Leg 189), multiple proxies yield sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) $5^{\circ}$ to $10^{\circ}C$ warmer than predicted by model simulations (Hollis et al., 2012; Pross et al., 2012). Such SST estimates imply very low meridiona l temperature gradients in the early Eocene, which has long posed  a climate puzzle (Barron, 1987).  

Ocean circulation might account for low SST gradients in th e southwest Pacific during the early Eocene. One possibility is tha t modeled SST predictions are too low because the region was influenced by a warm southward-flowing current system (Hollis et al., 2012) unaccounted for in climate models. Ocean currents predicte d by model simulations also could be substantially wrong if paleobathymetry is not depicted accurately (e.g., if parts of the Tasma n Frontier were much shallower than today during the early Eocene). There are indications that large vertical movements in the Tasma n Frontier occurred during the early Eocene (Baur et al., 2014; Sutherland et al., 2010).  

The early Paleogene stratigraphic record of New Zealand ha s been examined in detail. The warming trend of the late Paleocen e through early Eocene, the hyperthermal events of the early Eocene, the EECO, and subsequent cooling can be found in sedimentar y successions of eastern New Zealand (Dallanave et al., 2015; Hancock et al., 2003; Hollis, 2006; Hollis et al., 2005; Nicolo et al., 2010, 2007; Slotnick et al., 2012).  

Why did Earth’s climate generally cool since about 49 Ma? Mos t hypotheses have invoked changes in the amount of volcanism o r weathering, which would affect carbon addition to or carbon removal from the ocean and atmosphere (Brinkhuis et al., 2006; Ken t and Muttoni, 2008). It has been suggested that Eocene tectoni c change drove long-term Cenozoic climate change (Lee et al., 2013; Reagan et al., 2013). Prior to the early Eocene, most volcanic arc s were continental, where rising magma can react with carbonaterich crust and generate voluminous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ . Initiation of widesprea d island-arc subduction systems around the Pacific during the earl y Eocene created a network of submarine plate boundaries that ma y have first increased and later decreased $C O_{2}$ fluxes to the atmosphere.  

# Post-Eocene climate evolution  

Initial reports for Legs 21 and 29 (Burns and Andrews, 1973 ; Kennett et al., 1975) laid foundations for understanding the interplay between tectonic and oceanographic events in the region, including opening of the Tasman Sea and separation of Australia an d New Zealand from Antarctica (Andrews et al., 1975; Andrews an d Ovenshine, 1975; Edwards, 1973, 1975; Kennett et al., 1975; Kennet t and Shackleton, 1976). Stable isotope records from Leg 29 (DSD P Sites 277 and 279) reveal a general cooling trend over the Cenozoic, with evidence for a pronounced cooling step across the Eocene– Oligocene transition. A series of landmark publications from thes e legs proposed that ocean circulation was a primary driver of regional and global climate through the early Cenozoic, and the rol e of circumpolar gateways in the evolution of Antarctic ice sheets an d global climate was first hypothesized (Kennett, 1977; Kennett an d Shackleton, 1976; Nelson and Cooke, 2001).  

Leg 189 focused on the ocean gateway hypothesis and generate d a wealth of data and debate (Exon et al., 2004a; Kennett and Exon, 2004). Some continue to argue that opening of the Tasmanian gateway and subsequent development of the Antarctic Circumpola r Current (ACC) played a crucial role in southwest Pacific oceanography and climate (Kennett and Exon, 2004), whereas others link lat e Paleogene cooling and ice sheet growth to a tectonically driven decline in atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ (DeConto and Pollard, 2003; Huber et al., 2004).  

Expedition 371 collected high-quality cores and data from th e key Tasman Frontier region, where ACC-driven abyssal bottom currents and the shallow wind-driven East Australian Current (EAC ) operate (Figure F7). Eastern flow of the EAC from Australia towar d New Zealand leads to an east–west zone of surface water divergence. Drilling within the broader Indo-Pacific area has documented a phenomenon coined the late Miocene–early Pliocen e “biogenic bloom” (Farrell et al., 1995; Dickens and Owen, 1999). Between about 9 and $4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , the accumulation of biogenic component s (e.g., carbonate, biosilica, and barite) increases significantly at man y sites beneath regions of modern surface water divergence (e.g., along the Equator of the eastern Pacific [van Andel et al., 1975; Farrell et al., 1995], the far North Pacific [Rea et al., 1995], and th e Oman margin [Brummer and Van Eijden, 1992]). At DSDP Site 590, which lies beneath the Tasman Front (southern boundary of th e easterly flowing EAC), carbonate accumulation rates doubled between the late Miocene and early Pliocene, consistent with the biogenic  bloom  phenomenon  (Grant  and  Dickens,  2002).  Th e coincidence of elevated export production at numerous location s suggests far-field oceanographic teleconnections during the Neogene, such as via an acceleration of Indo-Pacific upwelling and nutrient delivery to the photic zone.  

# Geological setting  

The seafloor beneath the Tasman Frontier in the southwest Pacific is complex with a series of bathymetric highs and lows (Figure s F1, F2). The bathymetric highs, and the islands of New Zealand an d New Caledonia, and perhaps the New Caledonia Trough, represen t the northern part of a continent referred to as Zealandia (Mortime r et al., 2017). Unlike other continents, most of Zealandia lies underwater because the continental crust is relatively thin. East of northern Zealandia lies a lengthy subduction system, the Kermadec an d Tonga Trenches.  

The Tonga-Kermadec system has been studied much less tha n the Izu-Bonin-Mariana system but is complementary and has th e following advantages for investigation by drilling: (1) the TongaKermadec system formed adjacent to thin continental crust tha t early back-arc spreading isolated from later complication by faultin g or volcanism; (2) persistent submarine conditions and moderat e water depths led to preservation of fossil-rich bathyal sediment records in many places; (3) seismic reflection data demonstrate th e existence of Eocene tectonic signals of change, including compression, uplift-subsidence, and volcanism; and (4) Australia-Pacifi c plate-motion boundary conditions are precisely known (Cande an d Stock, $2004;$ Sutherland, 1995).  

The tectonic history of the Tasman Frontier can be simplifie d into 4 phases with approximate ages:  

• ${>}350{-}100\,\mathrm{Ma}$ : subduction along the eastern Gondwana margin.   
• 100–80 Ma: continental rifting in the Tasman Sea region.   
• 80–50 Ma: oceanic rifting, passive margins, and opening of the Tasman Sea.   
• $50{-}0\;\mathrm{Ma}$ : Tonga-Kermadec subduction.  

Continental “basement” beneath bathymetric rises in the regio n is inferred to be similar to rocks found in New Zealand, New Caledonia, and eastern Australia; this inference is supported by limite d dredge samples and drilling (DSDP Site 207), seismic velocities, an d gravity and magnetic anomalies (Collot et al., 2012; Klingelhoefer e t al., 2007; Mortimer, 2004a, 2004b; Mortimer et al., 2008; Sutherland, 1999; Tulloch et al., 1991; Wood and Woodward, 2002). Th e Lord Howe Rise and Challenger Plateau (Figure F3, F4) are probably composed of quartzose metasedimentary rocks and granitoid s of Paleozoic age that represent the eastern edge of Gondwana (Mortimer et al., 2017). High-amplitude magnetic anomalies and a singl e dredge sample from the West Norfolk Ridge suggest that the southern New Caledonia Trough is underlain by a fossil arc of late Paleozoic and Mesozoic age that formed along the active margin o f Gondwana (Mortimer et al., 1998; Sutherland, 1999). The geolog y of New Caledonia and northern New Zealand suggests that th e Norfolk Ridge system is underlain by Mesozoic fore-arc accretionary rocks that formed at the convergent margin of Gondwana (Adams et al., 2009; Aitchison et al., 1998; Cluzel et al., 2010; Cluzel an d Meffre, 2002; Mortimer, 2004b). Based on comparison with easter n New Zealand (Davy et al., 2008), a “fossil” Gondwana trench la y along the northeast side of the Norfolk Ridge system and the sla b dipped southwest beneath the Lord Howe Rise.  

The tectonic regime along the Tasman sector of the Gondwan a margin changed during the Cretaceous from subduction and convergence to widespread rifting and extension. Igneous activity wa s widespread and of variable type and chemistry during the Cretaceous. Calc-alkaline and adakitic (high $\mathrm{Sr/Y}$ ) activity with a subduction-related signature is characteristic of the early phase $\left\langle130-\right.$ $110\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) in New Zealand and New Caledonia, whereas an intraplat e rift setting characterizes later activity after ${\sim}105{-}100\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and is als o recorded on the Lord Howe Rise (Bryan et al., 1997; Cluzel et al., 2010; Higgins et al., 2011; Mortimer et al., 1999; Tulloch et al., 2009). Late Cretaceous rift basins contain coastal sandstone facie s overlain by transgressive marine sandstones and mudstones in Ne w Zealand, eastern Australia, and New Caledonia and are likely present in the Tasman Frontier region (Collot et al., 2009; Herzer et al., 1999; King and Thrasher, 1996; Uruski and Wood, 1991; Uruski, 2008). The end of widespread rifting in New Zealand, New Caledonia, and Australia and the subsequent transition to passive margi n conditions were contemporaneous with the onset of seafloo r spreading in the Tasman Sea at ${\sim}80\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , but local fault activity i s known to have continued to ${\sim}60$ Ma in Taranaki and norther n South Island, New Zealand (King and Thrasher, 1996; Laird, 1993).  

Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic seafloor spreading in the Tasman Basin is inferred from magnetic anomalies (Hayes and Ringis, 1973; Weissel and Hayes, 1977). The earliest seafloor spreading ma y predate Chron C33r $(84{-}80\ \mathrm{Ma})$ east of Tasmania (Royer and Rollet, 1997), but marginal seafloor along much of the western edge o f the Lord Howe Rise probably formed during Chron C33r (Gaina e t al., 1998; Sutherland, 1999). Seafloor spreading ceased in the central Tasman Sea during Chron C24 $^{53-52\ M{\bf a})}$ or very shortly afterward (Gaina et al., 1998).  

Deformation, exhumation, and emplacement of ultramafic , mafic, and sedimentary allochthons occurred in New Caledoni a during the middle and late Eocene (Aitchison et al., 1995; Cluzel e t al., 2001). The peak of high-pressure metamorphism in norther n New Caledonia was at $44\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and exhumation was largely complet e by $34\,\mathrm{\OmegaMa}$ (Baldwin et al., 2007). Seismic-stratigraphic evidenc e shows that the New Caledonia Trough either formed or was substantially modified during this event, though Cretaceous sedimentary basins beneath the trough escaped Cenozoic convergen t deformation in most places (Collot et al., 2008; Sutherland et al., 2010). Regional deformation and emplacement of allochthons i n northern New Zealand occurred later than in New Caledonia or th e Norfolk Ridge system, with the onset of tectonic activity during th e late Oligocene and early Miocene $({\sim}30{-}20\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Bache et al., 2012; Herzer, 1995; Herzer et al., 1997; Rait et al., 1991; Stagpoole an d Nicol, 2008).  

Australia-Pacific plate motion is precisely known for the perio d since Chron C20 (43 Ma) because the plate boundary south of Ne w Zealand was extensional and a plate circuit through Antarctica ca n be followed to provide additional constraints (Cande and Stock, 2004; Keller, 2003; Sutherland, 1995). Eocene convergence rates varied from ${<}1\ \mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{y}$ in New Zealand to $10\;\mathrm{cm/y}$ near New Caledoni a (Figure F8). Late Eocene to Holocene subduction zone roll-back ha s produced back-arc basins (Loyalty, Norfolk, South Fiji, North Fiji, Havre, and Lau) and ridges interpreted as fossil and active arcs eas t of the Norfolk Ridge system (Loyalty, Three Kings, Lau-Colville, Tonga-Kermadec, and Vanuatu) (Crawford et al., 2003; Herzer et al., 2009; Herzer and Mascle, 1996; Mortimer et al., 2007; Schellart e t al., 2006). The complexity of basin opening makes local determination of past plate boundary configurations and rates difficult. Thi s back-arc region has mostly isolated the submerged continental par t of the Tasman Frontier region from Cenozoic subduction-relate d deformation and volcanism.  

A variety of tectonic models have been proposed to explain ho w various Eocene–Miocene arcs and back arcs subsequently forme d between the Tonga-Kermadec Trench and Norfolk Ridge (Cluzel e t al., 2006; Crawford et al., 2003; Herzer et al., 2009; Mortimer et al., 2007; Schellart et al., 2006). General agreement exists that the modern Tonga-Kermadec system evolved from a boundary lying nea r the Norfolk Ridge and New Caledonia in the middle Eocene. However, ideas about the exact geometry of that boundary or the natur e of Cretaceous to middle Eocene plate boundaries northeast of Norfolk Ridge (Whattam et al., 2008) vary because the region has eithe r been subducted or deformed and intruded and it is sparsely sampled.  

The oldest Cenozoic volcanic rocks from the southwest Pacifi c with clear subduction affinities were dredged from the Tonga-Kermadec fore arc and have ages in the range of $52{-}48\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Meffre e t al., 2012). In New Caledonia, dikes with subduction affinities cu t ophiolitic rocks and are interpreted to be approximately synchronous with felsic dikes that are dated at ${\sim}53\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Cluzel et al., 2006). This represents the earliest evidence for subduction and predate s the peak of high-pressure metamorphism at $44\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Baldwin et al., 2007) and nappe emplacement in New Caledonia (Aitchison et al., 1995; Maurizot, 2012). Magnetic anomaly interpretation shows tha t the Tasman Basin ceased spreading at ${\sim}52{-}50\,\mathrm{\Ma}$ (Gaina et al., 1998). Therefore, there is strong evidence for Pacific-wide synchronicity: the age of the Emperor-Hawaii bend, the inception of IzuBonin-Mariana subduction, and a change from seafloor spreadin g to Tonga-Kermadec subduction initiation in the Tasman Frontier.  

# Scientific objectives  

1. How and why does subduction initiation occur?  

a. Did plate convergence and a period of high horizontal stress with convergent failure precede and induce subduction initiation, or did subduction initiation happen spontaneously with early extensional stresses? b. What vertical stresses occurred during subduction initiation, and when and where was this manifest as uplift or subsidence? 2. Was the Eocene southwest Pacific anomalously warm, and why? a. What were surface water temperatures during the early Cenozoic across the region? b. Were unusually high temperatures linked to regional physiographic changes and hence climate change or/and global changes in carbon cycling and hence the long-term cooling trend that begins at ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{Ma}?$ 3. How does post-Eocene oceanography and climate compare to  

elsewhere in the Pacific?  

a. When did the modern ocean circulation system develop as evidenced in the Tasman Frontier? b. Are pole-Equator climate teleconnections manifested in the Tasman Sea during the late Cenozoic?  

# Drilling strategy  

Our drill sites were chosen foremost to test geodynamic mode l predictions. Periods of time in the past that had high horizonta l stress may be recorded as faulted or folded strata. Anomalous vertical stress in the past caused by traction or buoyancy would hav e been balanced by surface uplift or subsidence and might be recorded as changes in paleodepths. Thermal or chemical anomalie s in the crust or mantle in the past may be recorded by characteristi c volcanic products. We aimed to sample records with these signals.  

The timing and style of faulting and folding can be determine d from stratigraphic relationships tied to seismic reflection data. I n general, three units constrain the timing of a tectonic event: faulte d strata are older than the event, unfaulted strata are younger than th e event, and syntectonic growth strata record progressive faultin g during the event. Growth strata are typically identified from thickness changes within a sedimentary unit that drapes faulted units, and seismic reflectors within the syntectonic unit may exhibit fanning geometries close to faults.  

The only practical way of measuring elevation of the crus t through time is against a sea level reference frame. Flat unconformities with regional consistency on seismic reflection (and in som e cases bathymetric) data are interpreted as surfaces produced by se a level–modulated erosional processes. Samples dredged from $>\!1500$ m water depth from the Reinga Basin during the TAN1312 expedition confirm the occurrence of Paleogene bioclastic limestone wit h shallow-marine fossils and hence affirm the hypothesis that larg e $(>\!1\;\mathrm{km})$ vertical motions were associated with subduction initiatio n (Browne et al., 2016). We aimed to recover shallow-water $^{\prime}{<}400\ \mathrm{m})$ fossils, either in place or reworked by sediment gravity flows, at ou r target locations to provide direct evidence of past vertical position s at precisely dated times. Tectonic and oceanographic research objectives are aligned. Fossils and geochemistry (e.g., proxy records fo r water temperature or chemistry) can provide independent evidenc e for vertical positions. Beyond direct and local constraints, model s that include ocean circulation are sensitive to paleobathymetry.  

Our strategy was to obtain information on transects parallel an d perpendicular to where subduction initiated to constrain the different physical processes involved in subduction zone initiation (Figure F9). The proximal ridge includes New Caledonia, Norfol k Ridge, Reinga Basin, and northwest New Zealand (Figures F2, F3, F4). The proximal region is deformed and presumably was involve d in the initial phase of surface convergence (Sutherland et al., 2017). Knowledge from New Caledonia, IODP Sites U1507 and U1508, and New Zealand produce a proximal boundary–parallel transec t that progressively samples initial rates of predicted convergenc e (Bache et al., 2012).  

IODP Sites U1506 and U1507 (proposed Sites LHRN-3A an d NCTN-8A, respectively), combined with knowledge from Ne w Caledonia and regional seismic reflection interpretation, shoul d provide a boundary-perpendicular transect in the northern regio n (Figure F3), where Eocene convergence rates are thought to hav e been highest (Figure F8). IODP Sites U1508, U1509, U1510, an d U1511 (proposed Sites REIS-2A, NCTS-2A, LHRS-3A, and TASS2A, respectively), combined with knowledge from New Zealand an d Australia, provide a southern transect (Figure F4) that has clea r signs of an extended period of plate failure (Sutherland et al., 2017).  

We aimed to test the hypothesis that the proximal basin, th e New Caledonia Trough, subsided $>\!2\,\mathrm{km}$ during the Paleogene, eve n though it was only subjected to minor convergent deformatio n (Sutherland et al., 2010). Sites U1507 and U1509 were chosen t o constrain the magnitude and timing of subsidence in relation t o other events. In addition, the New Caledonia Trough contains a record of detrital products derived from ridges on either side and s o records the timing of deformation and emergence of those ridge s (Etienne et al., in press; Bache et al., 2014).  

The distal ridge, Lord Howe Rise, shows signs of minor Eocen e convergent deformation, volcanism, and significant erosion surfaces (Sutherland et al., 2010). Sites U1506 and U1510 were chose n to determine the timing and magnitude of vertical motions an d hence constrain the history of dynamic topography (upper mantl e flow), lithospheric buoyancy, and/or tractions related to shea r zones. Different geodynamic model classes make very different predictions of vertical motion.  

The distal basin, the Tasman Abyssal Plain, shows signs of loca l convergent deformation (Sutherland et al., 2017). The force transmitted through the tectonic plate must have been large enough t o stop seafloor spreading and cause failure of the lithosphere. Sit e U1511 was chosen to determine the timing of this change in stres s state and how it relates to other tectonic events. The timing an d magnitude of force transmitted through a plate is a powerful discriminator: an induced subduction model predicts a larger and earlier compressive force than a spontaneous subduction mode l (Gurnis et al., 2004).  

The Australia-Pacific convergence rate during the time of interest was much faster near New Caledonia than near New Zealan d (Figure F8). Geodynamic models predict that stresses within an initiating subduction system evolve in response to the total convergence experienced (Gurnis et al., 2004), so models predict alongstrike changes in timing that can be tested using biostratigraphy. The absolute timing of observables can also be compared to know n plate motions. This ability to track total convergence precisel y through space and time is unique to the Tonga-Kermadec syste m because most subduction systems have imprecisely known kinematic histories, as the rock record has been subducted.  

# Site summaries  

# Site U1506 (northern Lord Howe Rise)  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1506 (proposed Site LHRN-3A) is located on the norther n Lord Howe Rise, ${\sim}290~\mathrm{km}$ south of DSDP Sites 208 and 588 an d where geophysical surveys image a regional unconformity (Sutherland et al., 2016). At Sites 208 and 588, the unconformity corresponds to a break between foraminiferal and nannofossil chalk o f early Oligocene age and siliceous microfossil–bearing chalk, radiolarite, and diatomite of middle Eocene age. The primary scientifi c objective at Site U1506 was to test the hypothesis that the norther n Lord Howe Rise transiently uplifted to near sea level during th e Paleogene and has since subsided by $\mathord{\sim}1500\mathrm{~m~}$ . The drilling target, identified from seismic reflection data, is a buried flat-topped feature with ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of relief above the regional unconformity surface. The feature has a positive polarity seismic reflection at its top bu t also internal reflections. We hypothesized that it could be a cora l reef or wave-cut surface formed during the Eocene. Rotary drillin g was chosen because consideration of the seismic reflection amplitude and seismic refraction velocity $(3.2{-}3.8\ \mathrm{km/s})$ ) suggested th e material might be too hard for advanced piston corer (APC) or extended core barrel (XCB) coring.  

# Operations  

Hole U1506A: $28^{\circ}39.7180^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $161^{\circ}44.4240^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ ; water depth $=1495$ m  

All depth references in meters in this section refer to the drillin g depth below seafloor (DSF) depth scale.  

Site U1506 was the first site occupied during Expedition 371. After an $1167~\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Townsville, Australia, the ship arrived at Site U1506 at $1912~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 August 2017 $\mathrm{^UTC}+10\ \mathrm{h})$ ). A t  

$1948~\mathrm{h},$ , the drill floor was cleared for operations, beginning Hol e U1506A.  

The rotary core barrel (RCB) bottom-hole assembly (BHA) wa s assembled and deployed, and Hole U1506A was spudded at $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 August. Coring proceeded to Core 29R where the expecte d hard formation was encountered at ${\sim}265\ \mathrm{m}$ . We recovered cores i n half intervals $(4.5{-}5.0\;\mathrm{m}$ length) below this depth to minimize ris k of core loss due to jams in the bit or inner barrel.  

Coring stopped after Core 36R, which arrived on the rig floor a t $1345\mathrm{~h~}$ on 5 August. Total recovery for the $306.1\ \mathrm{m}$ cored in Hol e U1506A was $192.38\;\mathrm{m}$ $(63\%)$ . This included an average core recovery of $61\%$ from Cores 1R through 28R and $79\%$ from Cores 29 R through 36R, which were recovered in half intervals $(4.5{-}5.0\ \mathrm{m})$ Hole U1506A operations ended at $1935~\mathrm{h}$ and the total time spen t on Hole U1506A (and Site U1506) was $47.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 2.0 days. At 200 0 h we departed for Site U1507.  

# Principal results  

All depth references in meters in this section refer to the cor e depth below seafloor, method A (CSF-A) depth scale.  

Site U1506 consists of ${\sim}265\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of Pleistocene–middle Eocen e nannofossil ooze and chalk (lithostratigraphic Unit I) overlying ${\sim}40$ m of volcanic rocks (lithostratigraphic Unit II; Figures F10, F11) . Sediments of Unit I are further divided into three subunits.  

Subunit Ia $(0{-}258.2\,\mathrm{~m~})$ consists of relatively homogeneou s Pleistocene to upper Miocene white nannofossil ooze and chal k with foraminifers, with carbonate content ranging from $88\%$ to $95\%$ . Faint decimeter-scale white and grayish white color banding an d rare blebs of pyrite (generally framboidal under the scanning electron microscope [SEM]) occur in this subunit. The ooze–chal k transition occurs across an interval including Cores 371-U1506A24R through 26R $\left(\sim\!260\textrm{m}\right)$ ). Fine structures and texture, includin g bioturbation with slightly darker Zoophycos, Planolites, Skolithos, and Chondrites burrows, are better preserved and visible in th e chalk than in the ooze.  

Subunit Ib $(258.2–264.3\;\mathrm{m})$ is a $\sim\!6\;\mathrm{m}$ thick interval of pale yellow to white upper Oligocene nannofossil chalk with foraminifers. The Subunit Ia/Ib boundary is marked by a color change from whit e gray to pale yellow and a slight increase in magnetic susceptibilit y (MS). It also represents a ${\sim}10$ My hiatus separating the late Oligocene from the late Miocene. Additionally, Subunit Ib is moderatel y bioturbated with common Zoophycos and Planolites trace fossils.  

Subunit Ic $\left(264.3\mathrm{-}264.6\mathrm{~m}\right)$ is a $34~\mathrm{cm}$ thick interval of middl e Eocene glauconitic nannofossil chalk with foraminifers. The Subunit $\mathrm{Ib/Ic}$ boundary, defined by the appearance of glauconite and  a coincident color change to light greenish gray, represents a $\mathord{\sim}20$ M y hiatus between the middle Eocene and late Oligocene. Subunit Ic i s intensely bioturbated, with burrows filled with pale yellow Oligocene nannofossil chalk from the overlying Subunit Ib.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II $(264.6{-}305.3\ \mathrm{m})$ ) represents the uppermost ${\sim}41\mathrm{~m~}$ of a volcanic rock sequence. It consists of microcrystalline to fine-grained basalt with facies alternating in ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{~m~}$ couplets of (1) dark reddish brown microcrystalline, highly vesicular, and amygdaloidal basalt with common veins and (2) dark gra y fine-grained massive aphyric basalt with rare carbonate veins. Thi n sections and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements show the basal t is dominated by Ca-plagioclase and clinopyroxene alongside various alteration minerals such as Fe-Ti oxides and chlorite. The carbonate veins and vesicle fills display a variety of composition an d texture, including large $_{>1\,\,\mathrm{cm}}$ grain size) fibrous calcite crystal s and fine-grained bioclastic packstone.  

Nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy assign  a Pleistocene to late Oligocene age to lithostratigraphic Subunits I a and Ib. Higher resolution sampling allowed identification of a condensed interval between Samples 371-U1506A-28R-3, $75~\mathrm{cm}$ , an d 28R- $4,75\:\mathrm{cm}\:(257.25\mathrm{-}258.75\:\mathrm{m})$ , that represents ${\sim}10$ My. Subunit I c is of middle Eocene age. A sample of a burrow fill within Subunit I c (29R-2, $70\,\mathrm{cm}$ ; $264.36\;\mathrm{m})$ ) is late Oligocene in age, indicating erosio n or nondeposition of middle Eocene to upper Oligocene sediment.  

Microfossil assemblages consist of well-preserved calcareou s nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, and ostracods, indicating a depositional depth well above the lysocline. The middl e Eocene benthic foraminifers are characteristic of an upper bathya l environment, about $500{-}1000\;\mathrm{m}$ shallower than the late Oligocen e and younger intervals. The ostracod assemblages indicate a deepwater setting throughout Subunits Ia and Ib (representing late Oligocene and younger age) but an upper bathyal setting for Subunit I c (middle Eocene).  

Rare, heavily recrystallized reworked radiolarians were found i n some core catcher samples from this site. No other siliceous microfossils were found in samples examined from this site.  

A palynological reconnaissance study carried out on five samples from Hole U1506A, including one sample from the middle Eocene glauconite-rich layer in Section 371-U1506A-29R-2, yielde d no palynomorphs.  

Paleomagnetic measurements from ooze samples, representin g most of lithostratigraphic Subunit Ia, yielded unstable paleomagnetic directions, largely due to reworking of sediments (bioturbation) and drilling disturbance associated with the RCB corin g system. Integration with discrete sample-derived directions doe s not allow reliable correlation with the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS). However, stable paleomagnetic directions with several polarity reversals were obtained in the chalk interval (belo w ${\sim}245\;\mathrm{m})$ ), and clarity was improved by alternating field (AF) demagnetization at $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ Principal component analysis of paleomagneti c directions after stepwise AF demagnetization of discrete sample s reveals a stable remanent magnetization component above 10–2 0 mT, confirming observations from superconducting rock magnetometer measurements.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II yields a stable paleomagnetic signa l after removing the overprint with AF demagnetization at $20~\mathrm{mT}$ .  A normal polarity was obtained from most volcanic rock samples. Some intervals not affected by AF demagnetization showed a reversed polarity after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization. Further analyses (e.g., thermal demagnetization) are required to investigate the paleomagnetic signal of the volcanic materials.  

Gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk density, MS, color, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) exhibit small amplitude variations i n lithostratigraphic Unit I and significantly greater amplitude variations in Unit II.  

In Unit I, GRA varies between 1.6 and $1.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and porosit y decreases from ${\sim}63\%$ to $52\%$ from the seafloor to the base of Unit I, typical of calcareous ooze and chalk. $P$ -wave velocity increase s gradually with depth from $\mathord{\sim}1600$ to ${\sim}2000~\mathrm{{m/s}}$ . Intermittentl y higher $P$ -wave velocity values of ${\sim}2200~\mathrm{m/s}$ occur in Cores 371- U1506A-26R and 27R, reflecting the diagenetic transition of ooze t o chalk. MS is low throughout the sedimentary section, with a few local MS spikes up to 100 instrument units (IU). NGR is also generall y low (1–4 counts/s) but increases to ${\sim}25$ counts/s in glauconitic Subunit Ic.  

Thermal conductivity shows a gradual and increasing trend wit h depth from 1.1 to $1.4\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ over the uppermost ${\sim}250\;\mathrm{m}$ , consistent with expected values for calcareous ooze and chalk. Vane shea r strength increases from ${\sim}18\,\mathrm{kPa}$ near the seafloor to ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{kPa}$ at 19 0 m. Compressive strength from penetrometer measurements show s very low strength in the top ${\sim}72\mathrm{~m~}$ of Unit I then increases and becomes variable $[{\sim}60$ to ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{kPa})$ ) to $186\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The most significant change in physical properties spans th e lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary. This sediment/rock contact a t $265\,\mathrm{~m~}$ corresponds to major increases in bulk density (up to 2. 8 $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3})$ and $P_{-}$ -wave velocity $(4400{-}6500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ . This impedance contrast can be correlated with the major reflection seen in the multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles used in the site surveys (2.29 s twoway traveltime [TWT]). MS (0–1500 IU), NGR ( $_{\sim3-9}$ counts/s), bulk density, and color reflectance show much higher amplitud e variations in Unit II than in Unit I. Porosity drops to $9\%{-20\%}$ withi n Unit II.  

A total of 15 interstitial water (IW) samples were collected fro m Cores 371-U1506A-4R through 28R $(26{-}261\ \mathrm{m};$ lithostratigraphi c Unit I). Sulfate concentration decreases from ${\sim}29\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the “mudline” to ${\sim}20~\mathrm{mM}$ at depth. The ammonium profile somewhat mirrors that of sulfate, increasing from 0 to $150~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . This suggest s sulfate reduction of particulate organic carbon in the sediments. The product of this reaction, $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{S},$ once reacting with Fe, also explains the abundant iron sulfide mineral horizons observed in th e cores. From the top to the bottom of the sedimentary section, C a increases from 10.6 to $18.3\;\mathrm{mM}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}$ decreases from 52.9 to 36. 2 mM. This could reflect reactions between pore water and basemen t rock. Si and Mn increase from 160 to $200~\mathrm{mM}$ and from 0.4 to  3 mM, respectively, at the transition from ooze to chalk.  

Headspace gas samples were collected from each core. Hydrocarbon gas concentrations in all samples were below detection limits.  

Carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ content is high $(>\!88\,\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) throughout Uni t I, showing an increasing trend with depth in the uppermost $70\textrm{m}$ with highest values $(\sim\!95\;\mathrm{wt\%})$ between 85 and $143~\mathrm{m}$ and betwee n 200 and $228\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Total organic carbon (TOC) percentages are low, with values ranging between 0.2 and $0.4\:\mathrm{wt\%}$ in the top ${\sim}210\;\mathrm{m}$ an d between 0.6 and $1.0\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ from 219 to $247~\mathrm{m}$ . Trace amounts of nitrogen are present in the uppermost two samples (0.65 and 14.3 2 m). No samples were taken for bulk sediment geochemistry fro m Subunit Ic or Unit II.  

# Site U1507 (northern New Caledonia Trough) Background and objectives  

Site U1507 (proposed Site NCTN-8A) is located in the Ne w Caledonia Trough, ${\sim}460~\mathrm{km}$ south of New Caledonia, ${\sim}620\ \mathrm{km}$ north of DSDP Site 206, and ${\sim}530~\mathrm{km}$ east of Sites 208 and 588. Trending northwest–southeast and north–south, the New Caledonia Trough delineates a ${\sim}1700~\mathrm{km}$ long bathymetric low on northern Zealandia (Figure F2). The northern and central parts of th e feature have not been drilled previously. On the basis of evidenc e from Site 206 and the Taranaki Basin, it has been inferred that th e New Caledonia Trough formed during Cretaceous rifting and subsequent subsidence. However, recent analysis of high-quality seismic reflection data has led to an alternate hypothesis: the presen t physiography was created mainly during Eocene subduction zon e initiation. Site U1507 was chosen to determine the timing of deformation and uplift of Norfolk Ridge, to constrain the age of troug h formation and sedimentary fill, and to obtain a record of regional volcanism (Sutherland et al., 2016). The intent was to core Sit e U1507 using the APC/XCB system to sample a downlapping sequence (at ${\sim}500{-}700$ meters below seafloor [mbsf]) that was inferred to represent an influx of sediment from the Norfolk Ridg e and hence date emergence of the ridge.

All depth references in meters in this section refer to the DS F depth scale, unless noted otherwise.  

Hole U1507A was cored with the APC and XCB systems. Th e first was used to retrieve Cores 1H through 26H with an average recovery of $106\%$ . Temperature measurements were taken at the bottom of Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, 16H, and 19H. Deployment o f orientation and temperature tools was discontinued after Core 20H, and APC coring was discontinued after Core 26H. Coring continued with the XCB system, retrieving Cores 27X through 46X wit h an average recovery of $55\%$ . Total recovery for Hole U1507A wa s $352.7\mathrm{~m~}$ $(83\%)$ , and the total time spent on Hole U1507A was 3. 6 days.  

Hole U1507B was first drilled without coring from 0 to $376~\mathrm{m}$ and then cored (Cores 2R through 53R) with a recovery of $371.5~\mathrm{m}$ $(76\%)$ . The total time spent on Hole U1507B was 8.1 days.  

After dropping the coring bit at the bottom of the hole and replacing the hole with heavy mud, three logging passes were mad e with a modified triple combo tool string between 75.2 and $864~\mathrm{m}$ wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF): a downhole log, a $125\mathrm{~m~}$ uplog for calibration, and a main log up the entire hole. The modified triple combo logging tool string included MS, electrical resistivity, sonic, bulk density, and NGR tools.

The sedimentary sequence at Site U1507 consists of ${\sim}685\mathrm{~m~}$ o f biogenic ooze and chalk interbedded with calcareous and volcaniclastic turbidites (lithostratigraphic Unit I), overlying ${\sim}170\,\mathrm{~m~}$ o f more homogeneous clayey nannofossil chalk (lithostratigraphi c Unit II; Figures F10, F11). Sediments of Unit I are further divide d into three subunits, based on changes in lithology and sedimentological features, as identified by macroscopic and microscopi c (smear slide, thin section, and SEM) core description.  

Subunit Ia $(0{-}401.2\,\textrm{m})$ mostly consists of white nannofossi l ooze and chalk. This dominant lithology is accompanied by ligh t greenish gray nannofossil-rich clay with volcanic ash, white gra y normally graded foraminiferal ooze or limestone beds, and a restricted ${\sim}2\,\textrm{m}$ thick interval of very dark greenish gray volcani c breccia and tuffaceous sandstone. Soft-sediment deformation i s widespread but particularly common in the lowermost part of th e subunit.  

Subunit Ib $(401.2–542.9\ \mathrm{m})$ ) is primarily composed of greenis h gray clayey nannofossil chalk with volcanic ash showing significan t soft-sediment deformation, interbedded with dark gray clayey tuffaceous sandstone and greenish gray clayey foraminiferal limeston e with volcanic clasts. This subunit differs from Subunit Ia by an overall increase in clay and volcanic content.  

Subunit Ic $(542.9\mathrm{-}685.5\;\mathrm{~m)}$ consists of dark greenish gra y coarse- to fine-grained tuffaceous conglomerate, sandstone, an d tuff, alternating with light greenish gray clayey nannofossil chal k with volcanic ash. The boundary with Subunit Ib is defined by th e first occurrence of a thick-bedded tuffaceous conglomerate. Volcaniclastic lithologies display a range of sedimentary facies that poin t to deposition from various gravity flow processes from debris flow s to turbidity currents. Thin sections and XRD measurements on th e volcaniclastics reveal that clast lithologies consist of variable percentages of basaltic minerals, such as pyroxene, plagioclase, and olivine phenocrysts, as well as volcanic glass shards, vesicular pumice, and large benthic foraminifers.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II $(685.5{-}855.7\;\mathrm{m})$ consists of homogeneous, light greenish gray bioturbated clayey nannofossil chalk wit h common Zoophycos, Nereites, and Spirophyton burrows and rar e foraminiferal limestone beds. The lithology is consistent with hemipelagic-dominated sedimentation. Very rare foraminiferal limestone beds, with few volcanic grains, are still encountered in thi s subunit. At $826–836\mathrm{~m}_{:}$ , the lithology changes to a greenish gra y nannofossil claystone, possibly reflecting increased carbonate dissolution.  

Nannofossils and foraminifers are present throughout Hole s U1507A and U1507B, providing a robust stratigraphy (Figure F11): Pliocene–Pleistocene $(6.2{-}177.8\;\mathrm{m})$ ), Miocene $(187.0\mathrm{-}432.6\;\mathrm{m})$ ), lat e Oligocene $(449.9\mathrm{-}520.0\ \mathrm{m})$ , early Oligocene $523.1{-}639.1\ \mathrm{m})$ , an d late to middle Eocene $(642.3{-}855.7\ \mathrm{m})$ ). The Oligocene/Miocen e boundary can be approximated using the top of Sphenolithus delphix $\left(\sim\!442.5\mathrm{~m}\right)$ ). The Eocene/Oligocene boundary can be approximated  using  the  top  of  planktonic  foraminifer  Globigerin a euapertura, the benthic foraminifer Nuttallides truempyi, the bas e acme of calcareous nannofossil Clausicoccus subdistichus, and th e top of rosette discoasters.  

The occurrence of Orbulinoides beckmanni in samples fro m 835.5 to $836.1\;\mathrm{m}$ constrains these depths to planktonic foraminiferal Zone E12 $(40.03{-}40.43\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , which effectively marks the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO). For calcareous nannofossils, th e base of Dictyococcites bisectus at ${\sim}836.1\mathrm{~m~}$ and the top of Sphenolithus obtusus at ${\sim}825.6\:\mathrm{m}$ indicate the post-MECO interval was recovered in this interval. However, Core 371-U1507B-51R (835.7– $836.1\ \mathrm{m})$ only recovered $38\ \mathrm{cm}\ (4\%)$ , so most of the MECO wa s washed away or lost during coring.  

Radiolarians have a patchy record. Well-preserved Neogen e radiolarians are found in samples from 6.2 to $54.1~\mathrm{m}$ . The interval from 63.4 to $380.6\mathrm{~m~}$ is barren of radiolarians. The interval fro m 380.6 to $523.2\;\mathrm{m}$ contains varying amounts of radiolarians, rangin g from trace to common, with some samples barren of radiolarians. Low-latitude index species are absent or rare.  

Benthic foraminifers indicate paleodepths that gradually rang e from abyssal in the most recent part of the sequence to lowe r bathyal in the Oligocene and Eocene. In some intervals (e.g., ${\sim}205.6$ m), their assemblages contain a mixture of deepwater and relativel y shallow-water taxa with different preservation states. A palynological reconnaissance study, carried out on 10 core catcher samples throughout the sedimentary sequence, showed that deposits a t Site U1507 are effectively barren of palynomorphs. Ostracods wer e rare to common between 6.2 and $279.7\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1507A and absent in Hole U1507B, except for one sample.  

Paleomagnetic measurements on section halves from Hole s U1507A and U1507B show variable quality for different lithostratigraphic units. In Hole U1507A, the natural remanent magnetizatio n (NRM) intensity is in the range of $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ and increases from 23 4 m downhole by about one order of magnitude. NRM inclination i s mostly positive, likely the effect of a present-day geomagnetic overprint. After AF demagnetization cleaning at $20\,\mathrm{\mT}$ , the interval from 0 to $54.1\mathrm{~m~}$ is characterized by dominantly normal polarit y with some intervals of reversed polarity. Between 53.7 and $215.6~\mathrm{m}$ , some swings between positive and negative inclination are observed, without a clear bimodal clustering, and from $216~\mathrm{m}$ downhole inclinations are less stable. This may reflect some combinatio n of drilling-related deformation, depositional processes, and wea k magnetization. The average inclination for Hole U1507A is aroun d $-20^{\circ}$ , and no reliable shipboard magnetostratigraphy can be obtained for this hole.  

High-quality paleomagnetic data were obtained on sediment s from Hole U1507B, with a well-defined series of normal and reversed polarity intervals in lithostratigraphic Unit I. Inclination values for Unit I after $20\:\mathrm{mT}$ AF demagnetization have two clear peak s clustered around $-40^{\circ}$ and $45^{\circ}$ . The overall high-quality paleomagnetic data from Hole U1507B can be attributed to the hig h NRM intensity and good recovery of lithified sediment cores. Integration with biostratigraphic results shows that the interval between 433.3 and $682.9\:\mathrm{m}$ contains most polarity chrons from Chro n C6Br in the early Miocene through Chron C16n in the late Eocene.  

Sediments from lithostratigraphic Unit II generally show scattered inclination values without recognizable bimodal distribution. Two inclination changes at 759.3 and $834.0\ \mathrm{m}$ are tentatively correlated with the bases of Chrons $C17\mathbf{n}$ and $C18\boldsymbol{\mathrm{n}}$ , respectively.  

Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) was measured o n 123 discrete samples from Site U1507, which were collected in th e most undisturbed intervals and often on top of turbidite layers. Th e soft and magnetically weak sediments from Hole U1507A did no t yield well-defined orientations of the AMS tensor. Cube sample s from lithified sediment, however, show a clear oblate magnetic fabric, where the minimum axis of the AMS ellipsoid is statistically oriented perpendicular to the bedding.  

Cores recovered from Holes U1507A and U1507B were analyzed with the full suite of physical property measurements. Downhole temperature measurements were made in Hole U1507A, an d wireline logging was completed using a modified triple combo too l string in Hole U1507B.  

Bulk density increases with depth from the seafloor $(1.5\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ ) to the bottom of the hole $(2.4~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ with local decreases to ${\sim}1.6$ $\mathsf{g}/\mathsf{c m}^{3}$ observed between ${\sim}420$ and ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ . Moisture and density– derived porosity values correspondingly decrease from $\sim\!70\%$ i n nannofossil ooze at the top of Hole U1507A to $\sim\!25\%$ at the base o f Hole U1507B in nannofossil chalk. Grain density is ${\sim}2.71~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ t o ${\sim}300\mathrm{~m~}$ and then varies between 2.7 and $2.8~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to ${\sim}700\ \mathrm{m},$ , except for the interval ${\sim}420{-}500\ \mathrm{m}$ , where grain density conspicuously drops to $2.6{-}2.7~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . In lithostratigraphic Unit II, grai n density decreases again to ${\sim}2.5{-}2.7\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

$P$ -wave velocity measured on cores gradually increases downhole in Subunit Ia, with a more rapid increase around $290\;\mathrm{m}$ corresponding to the diagenesis of ooze to chalk. From ${\sim}400$ to $520\;\mathrm{m},P\mathrm{.}$ - wave velocities increase from 2000 to $2500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , and stay at simila r values to the base of the hole. $P$ -wave velocity from wireline loggin g increases from 2300 to $2700\;\mathrm{m/s}$ within Unit II, with a negative excursion to ${\sim}2400\ \mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ associated with the MECO at ${\sim}835\mathrm{~m~}$ .  

Thermal conductivity increases gradually with depth from 1.1 t o $1.8\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}})$ in Subunit Ia and shows a decreasing trend in Subunit s Ib and Ic. In Hole U1507A, six temperature measurements wer e made with the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3), yielding a temperature gradient of $46.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

MS is low $\mathrm{\left(<50\;IU\right)}$ in Subunits Ia and Ib and high (up to 100 0 IU) within Subunit Ic. Below $680\;\mathrm{m}$ , values decrease to ${\sim}40$ IU an d are constant in the lowermost part of the hole. NGR measured o n cores and by wireline logging show matching downhole variations.  

NGR is low, except for positive excursions of ${\sim}20{-}40\$ counts/s between 400 and $520\;\mathrm{m}$ and between 520 and $680\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Changes in color reflectance occur at the base of Subunit Ia , where all parameters decrease, reflecting the darker and greene r clay-rich sediments. A slight increase in lightness $(\mathbb{L}^{*})$ is observed a t the top of Unit II.  

Headspace gas samples were routinely collected from each cor e from Holes U1507A and U1507B. Hydrocarbon gas concentration s in all samples were below detection limits.  

A total of 56 IW samples were collected from Cores 371- U1507A-1H  through  45X  (51  samples)  and  371-U1507B-6 R through 14R (5 samples). The results show a distinctive differenc e between above and below $250\,\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , corresponding to the change fro m APC to XCB or rotary coring. The IW constituent profiles ar e smooth in the upper $250\,\mathrm{m}$ and become scattered below $250\,\mathrm{m}$ . Despite this issue, Mg, K, and $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ generally decrease, whereas Ca increases downhole. Dissolved Sr increases smoothly in the upper 16 0 m and then remains approximately constant with depth. The negative correlation between dissolved $\mathrm{Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}$ concentrations suggests reactions between volcanic material and pore water in th e sediment column. The downhole decrease in $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ suggests sulfat e reduction of particulate organic carbon, which also explains the ris e in dissolved $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ with depth.  

Samples for solid sediment analysis were taken at a samplin g resolution of at least one sample per core from Holes U1507A an d U1507B. Carbonate contents are very high $(>\!90\,\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) throughou t Subunit Ia. Decreasing carbonate contents $(30{-}70\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ toward th e middle of Subunit Ib and Ic correlate well with changes in othe r properties, such as decreasing reflectance $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ , increasing MS, an d increasing NGR. Interbedded darker colored layers are represente d by lower total carbon and carbonate contents $(\sim\!20\,\mathrm{wt\%})$ ). Carbonat e contents within Unit II are high, varying between 50 and $80~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . TOC contents are low (averaging $0.4\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) throughout the sedimen t column and do not differ significantly between units.  

Linear sedimentation rates (LSRs) and mass accumulation rate s were calculated for Site U1507 using paleomagnetic and calcareou s nannofossil datums (Figure F11). The record recovered at Sit e U1507 is remarkably continuous despite numerous turbidite deposits and seismic reflectors, and it includes the entirety of the Oligocene. LSRs in the mid to late Eocene vary between ${\sim}30$ and 6 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{M}\mathbf{y}$ but decrease near the Eocene–Oligocene transition to $\mathord{\sim}15-$ $20\,\mathrm{m/My}$ . An extended duration of low LSRs $({\sim}12\,\mathrm{m/My})$ characterizes the Oligocene to middle Miocene, except for two short time intervals of enhanced LSRs $\scriptstyle(30-29\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and $25{-}23\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). After $9.5\;\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{}}$ , LSRs stepwise increase to $40~\mathrm{m/My}$ at $7.4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and remain at thes e high values until $4.0\,M{\bf a}$ . This pulse in sedimentation, which is characterized by constant high carbonate contents, may correspond t o the late Miocene to early Pliocene biogenic bloom as documented a t other sites. The uppermost 4 My at Site U1507 are represented by  a relatively condensed section with LSRs ${<}4\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My}$ .  

Mass accumulation rates follow the trend observed in LSRs an d vary between 2 and $12\mathrm{~g}/\mathrm{cm^{2}}/\mathrm{ky}$ .  

# Site U1508 (Reinga Basin)  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1508 (proposed Site REIS-2A) is located ${\sim}130\,\mathrm{km}$ west o f Cape Reinga, the northern tip of Northland, New Zealand. The location is on the northeast margin of Reinga Basin (Bache et al., 2012), which contains folded Eocene strata that have been dredge d but never drilled (Browne et al., 2016). The site was chosen to sample a record of deformation, uplift, subsidence, and early arc volcanism in a southern region proximal to Tonga-Kermadec subductio n initiation (Sutherland et al., 2016). The overall objective was to sample Miocene–Eocene strata, which includes an onlap surface tha t marks the onset of deformation. A high-amplitude seismic reflecto r near the base of the borehole has regional significance for stratigraphic correlation and was hypothesized to represent a majo r change in sedimentation during the Eocene.

We completed the $546~\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1507 to U150 8 and arrived at $2300\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 20 August 2017 $\mathrm{(UTC~+~10~h)}$ ). A n APC/XCB BHA was made up and APC coring in Hole U1508 A started at $0900~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August. Temperature measurements wer e taken on Cores 7H, 9H, 10H, 12H, 14H, and 17H. Core 23H had t o be drilled over for $40\;\mathrm{min}$ to release it from the formation, and Hol e U1508A was ended at $1140~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August. Total recovery for th e $210.3\;\mathrm{m}$ cored was $201.1\;\mathrm{m}\;(96\%)$ . The time spent on Hole U1508 A was $36.0\,\mathrm{h}$ or 1.5 days.  

The ship was offset by ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ to the southwest. An RCB BH A was made up and drilling without coring in Hole U1508B started a t $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August, reaching the target $\left\lfloor86.6\;\mathrm{m}\right\rangle$ at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 2 August. Coring in Hole U1508B began with Core 2R. While retrieving Core 38R $(503.4~\mathrm{m})$ at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August, we stopped operations due to a medical emergency and began recovering the dril l string. Cores 2R through 38R penetrated from 186.6 to $503.4\;\mathrm{m}$ an d recovered $133.32\mathrm{~m~}$ $(42\%)$ . The time spent on Hole U1508B wa s $49.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 2.1 days.  

The $302\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Auckland began at $1354\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August. During the trip, the clock was advanced twice, to $\mathrm{UTC}\,+\,12\,\mathrm{~h~}$ (Auckland time). On the way back from the medical evacuation, th e clock was set back $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ , to $\mathrm{UTC}+11\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and remained that way for th e rest of the Expedition 371 drilling operations. The trip back to Sit e U1508 was completed at $0600~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August. An RCB BHA wa s deployed and Hole U1508C was initiated ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ northwest of Hol e U1508B at $1150\,\mathrm{h}$ . The top $450\:\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1508C was drilled without coring, except for two spot-cored intervals at $278.0{-}292.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Cores 2R through 4R) and $316.0{-}330.7\,\mathrm{m}$ (Cores 6R and 7R) to better recover key intervals. At $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 28 August, we resumed RC B coring until penetration rates slowed to ${\sim}2~\mathrm{m/h}$ . Although short o f the desired target depth, we decided to stop coring and conduc t wireline logging at $0300\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 31 August. Collectively, Cores 2 R through 38R and the two drilled intervals penetrated from 278.0 t o $704.5~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $185.04\mathrm{~m~}$ of sediment ( $65\%$ of cored intervals).  

The bit was dropped at the bottom of the hole at $0325\ \mathrm{h}$ on 3 1 August, the hole was displaced with 194 barrels of $11.0\;\mathrm{lb}/\mathrm{gal}$ mud, and the open end of the drill string was set at $86.7~\mathrm{m}$ . At $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ , w e deployed the same modified triple combo logging tool string configuration as used in Hole U1507B with the exception that no sourc e was installed in the density tool. Logging went well until ${\sim}1230\ \mathrm{h}$ when the tool string became stuck at ${\sim}270\;\mathrm{m}$ WSF. The logging lin e was cut at the rig floor and terminated with connectors that woul d allow assembly of drill pipe over the logging line to wash down an d over the logging tools with the open-ended BHA. After the loggin g tools were free at $2105\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , the tool string arrived back on the rig floo r at $0315~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 September. After the drill string was recovered, th e ship began the transit to Site U1509 at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 September.  

# Principal results  

All depth references in meters in this section refer to the CSF- A depth scale.  

The sedimentary sequence at Site U1508 consists of ${\sim}700\mathrm{~m~}$ o f heterogeneous strata divided into three lithostratigraphic units (I, II, and III).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0.0{-}90.1\;\mathrm{m})$ consists of ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{m}$ of foraminiferal ooze with varying amounts of nannofossils and coarsegrained bioclasts. An increase in the occurrence of millimeter-size d bioclasts comprised mainly of bryozoans starts at ${\sim}49\mathrm{~m~}$ and extends to the bottom of this unit. The Unit I/II boundary at $90.1\;\mathrm{m}$ i s defined by an abrupt change from foraminiferal ooze with bioclast s to clayey nannofossil ooze with biosilica.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II (90.1–379.3 m) consists of ${\sim}290~\mathrm{m}$ o f calcareous ooze and chalk with varying amounts of clay and is divided into two subunits. Subunit IIa $(90.1{-}200.6\;\mathrm{m})$ ) comprises ligh t greenish clayey nannofossil ooze with varying contents of foraminifers and sponge spicules. Subunit IIb $(200.6{-}379.3\ \mathrm{m})$ is nannofossil-rich foraminiferal ooze and chalk with lithic and volcani c grains increasing to ${\sim}336\mathrm{~m~}$ and then decreasing downhole, resulting in a pure foraminiferal chalk in the lowermost $30\;\mathrm{m}$ of the subunit.  

The lithostratigraphic Unit II/III boundary at $379.3\;\mathrm{m}$ is identified by an abrupt downhole decrease in grain size to nannofossil chalk with varying amounts of foraminifers. Unit III (379.3–701. 9 m) is composed of moderately bioturbated nannofossil chalk, whic h is further divided into two subunits. Subunit IIIa $(379.3\substack{-491.6\mathrm{~m}})$ consists of moderately to heavily bioturbated clayey nannofossil chalk and contains at least 50 sporadic centimeter-scale chert y limestone intervals. Subunit IIIb $(493.8{-}701.9\ \mathrm{m})$ is characterize d by a downhole decrease in clay content and color brightening, wit h cherty limestone last observed at ${\sim}503\mathrm{~m~}$ . Subunit IIIb comprise s nannofossil chalk, and from ${\sim}685\mathrm{~m~}$ downhole it is sufficiently lithified to be classified as a nannofossil limestone.  

Calcareous nannofossils are abundant in most of the studie d samples. Planktonic foraminifers dominate over benthic foraminifers, which are present in most samples. Radiolarians are few to rar e in most samples, barren in some samples from Holes U1508A an d U1508B, and few to abundant in the lower half of Hole U1508A. Ostracods are abundant to common in Unit I and Subunit IIb and rar e to barren in Subunits IIa, IIIa, and IIIb. Preservation of all fossil groups decreases downhole, ranging from excellent to good in th e upper part of Hole U1508A and from moderate to poor in Hol e U1508C.  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminiferal datums , occasionally supplemented by radiolarian biostratigraphy, allow ag e assignments to all studied samples (Figure F11). Lithostratigraphi c Unit I is Pleistocene–Pliocene in age. The interval between 96 an d $210\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , nearly coincident with lithostratigraphic Subunit IIa, is Miocene in age. Samples between 187 and $373\;\mathrm{m}$ are Miocene to Oligocene in age. Nannofossil biostratigraphy points to an early Miocen e to late Oligocene hiatus (Zones NN4–NN1) of ${\sim}6$ My in both Hole s U1508B $(312{-}321\;\mathrm{m})$ ) and U1508C $316{-}321\;\mathrm{m})$ ). The interval fro m 379 to $497\;\mathrm{m}$ in Hole U1508B is late to middle Eocene age. In Hol e U1508C, the interval from 450 to $480\;\mathrm{m}$ is late Eocene age and th e interval from 484 to $686\,\mathrm{~m~}$ is middle Eocene age. Nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, and radiolarians indicate an early Eocen e age near the bottom of the sequence $(686{-}702\ \mathrm{m})$ ). Age-diagnosti c dinocyst species corroborate the age constraints determined b y nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers.  

Benthic microfossils (ostracods and foraminifers) indicate  a lower bathyal paleoenvironment throughout most of the sedimentary sequence and slightly shallower paleodepths (deep middl e bathyal) during the Oligocene and late Eocene. Palynological assemblages contain moderately to well-preserved palynomorphs, predominantly inner neritic to pelagic dinocysts. Terrestrial palynomorph content is much higher in the Pliocene to late Oligocen e than in the early Oligocene to Eocene, indicating a significan t change in offshore transport. Reworked microfossils, in particula r of early Paleogene age, commonly occur downhole from the midMiocene in all fossil groups.  

Pass-through paleomagnetic measurements from Unit I (0–9 0 m) are affected by core disturbance and have extremely weak magnetization $({\sim}10^{-5}{-}10^{-3}\,\mathrm{~A/m})$ , resulting in random NRM inclinations. NRM inclinations in Subunit IIa $(\sim\!90\!-\!210\,\mathrm{m})$ show a series o f polarity swings but no clear polarity pattern. In contrast, high-quality paleomagnetic data were obtained from Subunit IIb from ${\sim}250$ to $380\;\mathrm{m}$ with well-defined geomagnetic reversals. From lithostratigraphic Subunit IIb to Unit III, the NRM intensity drops to ${\sim}10^{-4}-$ $10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A/m_{\mathrm{:}}}$ , resulting in poor paleomagnetic behavior for many cores. Reliable paleomagnetic data were obtained from some intervals i n Hole U1508C, including 278–324 and ${\sim}650{-}700\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Integratio n with biostratigraphy allows a series of paleomagnetic reversals i n Holes U1508B and U1508C (Subunit IIb and Unit III) to be correlated with the GPTS back to ${\sim}48\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

Samples from Hole U1508A have a poorly defined orientation o f the AMS tensor, whereas most samples from Holes U1508B an d U1508C exhibit a well-defined oblate AMS fabric with the minimum axis of the AMS ellipsoids statistically oriented perpendicula r to the bedding plane.  

Variations in physical properties define three distinctive boundaries at ${\sim}90$ , $\mathord{\sim}200$ , and ${\sim}500~\mathrm{m}$ and are correlated with two stron g reflections on MCS data and three lithostratigraphic boundaries. The upper interval, corresponding to lithostratigraphic Unit I, i s characterized by low density of ${\sim}1.5~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , high porosity of ${\sim}65\%-$ $75\%_{:}$ , and increasing velocity from $\mathord{\sim}1500$ to ${\sim}1700~\mathrm{m/s}$ . All thes e values show a baseline shift at the Unit I/II boundary $\left(\sim\!90\mathrm{~m}\right)$ t o higher bulk density values $({\sim}1.65\,\mathrm{~g/cm^{3}})$ , lower porosity value s $(\sim\!60\%\!-\!65\%)$ , and lower velocity values $\left({\sim}1600\,\mathrm{~m/s}\right)$ that remai n constant throughout Subunit IIa down to ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{m}$ . Within the uppermost part of Subunit IIb $({\sim}200{-}250\ \mathrm{m})$ , bulk density decrease s from ${\sim}1.75$ to ${\sim}1.55~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , porosity increases from ${\sim}60\%$ to $\sim\!70\%$ , and shear strength decreases from $\mathord{\sim}100$ to ${\sim}30\ \mathrm{kPa}$ , whereas $P$ - wave velocity increases from $\mathord{\sim}1600$ to $1900\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . Below the Subuni t IIIa/IIIb boundary at $500~\mathrm{m}$ , bulk density gradually increases fro m 2.0 to $2.3\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , porosity gradually decreases to ${\sim}25\%$ , and $P.$ -wav e velocity increases from ${\sim}2200$ to $2600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . At the very base of Subunit IIIb where the transition from chalk to limestone occurs $(680-$ $700\;\mathrm{m})$ ), velocity and bulk density sharply increase to ${\sim}3600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ an d $2.45\:\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively.  

NGR and color reflectance data reveal complementary trends t o the density, porosity, and velocity measurements, including th e three distinctive boundaries at ${\sim}90$ , $\mathord{\sim}200$ , and ${\sim}500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . NGR increases and the color changes at ${\sim}90\mathrm{~m~}$ . NGR decreases and the n increases around ${\sim}200\mathrm{~m~}$ . MS from wireline logging and core measurements are low throughout the entire section, except for the interval from $\mathord{\sim}240$ to ${\sim}380\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Subunit IIb), which contains lithi c constituents. This interval also has higher amplitude (up to $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s) NGR variations.  

Five in situ temperature measurements in Hole U1508A revealed a gradient of ${\sim}55^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ .  

Headspace gas samples were routinely collected from each cor e in Hole U1508A and from deeper cores in Hole U1508C. Methan e was above the detection limit from ${\sim}460\mathrm{~m~}$ downhole and progressively increased below ${\sim}500~\mathrm{m}$ . Methane concentration was $\mathord{\sim}6000$ ppmv and ethane concentration was 36 ppmv at the base of Hol e U1508C.  

A total of 75 IW samples were collected from Site U1508 b y three different methods: whole-round squeezing, Rhizon sampling, and half-round squeezing. The latter were ${\sim}15~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals take n from core working halves 1–2 days after recovery and crushed i n plastic bags. These half-round samples yield reasonable results fo r some dissolved species, notably sulfate. Rhizon results generally li e close to those from squeezed samples at nearby depths. The manganese concentration profile does not show a peak within the uppermost meter or so, which suggests the true mudline is missing. Adjacent samples from the upper ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of the section show larg e variance because the sediment is unconsolidated foraminiferal sand, which makes collection of uncontaminated pore water difficult. Nonetheless, most constituents do not vary much in concentration  over  the  uppermost $275~\mathrm{~m~}$ .  Below $275\ \mathrm{~m~}$ ,  sulfat e concentrations decrease downhole linearly and ammonium, barium, and strontium concentrations increase linearly or exponentially. The concomitant loss of sulfate and rise in methane fro m ${\sim}500\mathrm{~m~}$ downhole suggests a deep zone of anaerobic oxidation o f methane (AOM), which also may explain the abundant macroscopi c pyrite at this depth interval.  

Bulk sediment carbonate content varies considerably wit h depth, having $100~\mathrm{m}$ –scale fluctuations between highs of ${\sim}95~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and lows of ${\sim}40~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , which relate to the lithostratigraphic units. TOC contents are $0.76\,\pm\,0.36~\mathrm{wt}\%$ , without any consistent downhole trend.  

All cores from Holes U1508A–U1508C were correlated to th e downhole logging data (at the wireline log matched depth belo w seafloor [WMSF] depth scale) using one tie per core. An offset tabl e allows users to approximate depths of core data at the CSF-A dept h scale to the WMSF depth scale of the downhole logging data.  

LSRs were calculated for Site U1508 using calcareous nannofossil datums and polarity chron boundaries from 0 to $48\mathrm{~Ma}$ (Figure F11). LSRs in the Pliocene–Pleistocene vary between ${\sim}10$ an d $80~\mathrm{m/My}$ and average ${\sim}20~\mathrm{m/My}$ during the early to late Miocene. The succession is condensed for most of the Oligocene despite  a short interval from 23 to $26\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . LSRs for the late to middle Eocen e are steady at ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m/My}.$  

# Site U1509 (southern New Caledonia Trough) Background and objectives  

Site U1509 (proposed Site NCTS-2A) is located ${\sim}640~\mathrm{km}$ wes t of the northern tip of New Zealand, ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{km}$ south of Site 206, an d ${\sim}200~\mathrm{km}$ north of DSDP Site 592. The location is on the wester n margin of the New Caledonia Trough at the base of the Lord How e Rise slope, near the mouth of a canyon that drains around th e northeast end of a small submerged spur (Sutherland et al., 2016). This spur, inferred to have been created by deformation, is underlain by the northeast-dipping limb of a west-verging fold that exposes strata that can be traced beneath the axis of the Ne w Caledonia Trough. Site U1509 was chosen to determine the timin g of Cenozoic folding in the southern New Caledonia Trough and t o obtain stratigraphic constraints on the timing of vertical tectoni c movements and volcanism.

We arrived at Site U1509 at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 September 2017 (UT C $+\ 11\ \mathrm{h})$ ), completing the $273\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1508. RCB coring in Hole U1509A was initiated at $2145~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 September. Th e decision to use the RCB system was made after considering targe t depth, time constraints, and success at previous sites. Coring continued until $2345\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 6 September and reached $690.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Cor e 74R). Total recovery in Hole U1509A was $462.86\mathrm{\;m\;}(67\%)$ .  

Planned wireline logging in Hole U1509A was canceled due t o ship heave exceeding $3.0\;\mathrm{m}$ . Hole U1509A was ended at $1434\;\mathrm{h},$ after a total of $127.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 5.3 days. At $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 September, the shi p began a ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to the north to avoid severe weather forecast for 9–10 September; this weather also impacted operations a t the remaining drilling sites.

The sedimentary sequence at Site U1509 consists of ${\sim}415\mathrm{~m~}$ o f calcareous ooze, chalk, and limestone (Unit I) overlying ${\sim}275\mathrm{~m~}$ o f claystone (Unit II).  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I is divided into three subunits. Subuni t Ia $(0{-}99.6~\mathrm{m})$ consists of calcareous ooze and chalk with rare tuffaceous beds. RCB coring led to soupy and mousse-like drilling disturbance in the soft sediments of the upper ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ of this subunit, followed by biscuiting, horizontal cracking, fracturing, and pulverization in the more indurated lower sediment of the unit. The ooze– chalk transition was observed, remarkably, at ${\sim}55\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Subunit I b $(99.6{-}139.28\,\textrm{m})$ comprises calcareous chalk showing significan t soft-sediment deformation (i.e., slumps). Subunit Ic (139.28–414.5 7 m) consists of calcareous chalk and limestone with biosilica an d several silicified (chert) intervals. Subunit Ic is characterized distinctively by tilted bedding (apparent dip of ${\sim}20^{\circ}$ ). From Subunit I c downhole, preferential fracturing of cores was seen along primar y deformation structures such as shear zones, microfaults, and tilte d bedding. The chalk–limestone transition occurs within Subunit I c at around $385\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II is divided into two subunits. Subuni t IIa $(414.57{-}614.2\ m)$ ) consists of claystone with nannofossils an d silt. Subunit IIb $(614.2{-}689.68\ \mathrm{m})$ ) consists of massive brown claystone with minor bioturbation and agglutinated benthic foraminifers. Similar to Subunit Ic, tilted bedding is observed throughou t Unit II.  

Nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer preservation and abundance generally decrease downhole, with these groups absent belo w 617.6 and $536.0\ \mathrm{m}$ , respectively. Radiolarians are rare to abundan t and well preserved in the upper $393~\mathrm{m}$ but are rare and poorly preserved farther downhole. Benthic foraminifer abundance is low, an d preservation decreases downhole in the upper $249~\mathrm{m}$ and remain s poor below. Only agglutinated taxa are found in sediments belo w $617.6\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Ostracods are common to rare with moderate to poo r preservation in the upper $178\,\textrm{m}$ and are rare to barren below.  A palynological reconnaissance study focused on Unit II and recovered rich and well-preserved assemblages.  

Nannofossil and foraminifer datums yielded Miocene (22.41– $82.47\;\mathrm{m})$ , Oligocene $?90.13–248.63\mathrm{~m})$ ), Eocene $(259.98{-}407.07\ \mathrm{m})$ , and Paleocene $\langle418.53\substack{-609.27\,\mathrm{~m}}\rangle$ ages for the sequence in Hol e U1509A (Figure F11). The interval from 617.6 to $689.6~\mathrm{m}$ is barre n of age-diagnostic nannofossils and planktonic foraminifer taxa bu t contains Late Cretaceous dinocysts and agglutinated benthic foraminifers.  Benthic  foraminifers  indicate  deposition  in  a  lowe r bathyal–abyssal environment during the Pleistocene to Eocene an d at middle bathyal depths during the Paleocene and Cretaceous.  

NRM intensity of most sediment cores from Hole U1509A i s weak, mostly around $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{\A/m}$ . This results in generally nois y paleomagnetic data from the pass-through magnetometer. However, step-wise AF demagnetization of some discrete samples give s reliable paleomagnetic data. Integrating these data with biostratigraphy, the observed magnetic polarities at 110 to ${\sim}260\,\mathrm{m}$ are tentatively correlated to Chrons C9 through C13 of GPTS2012. Th e claystone interval of Subunit IIb produces higher quality passthrough data compared to intervals above. Cores from Subunit II b have a normal magnetic polarity.  

Physical property measurements in Hole U1509A exhibit gradual changes in bulk density and $P$ -wave velocity with depth, excep t across a layer of limestone between $\sim\!390$ and $415~\mathrm{m}$ . Through th e ooze and chalk, above the limestone, $P$ -wave velocity and bulk density increase with depth from 1500 to $1900~\mathrm{m/s}$ and from 1.55 t o $1.90~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , respectively. The transition from ooze to chalk is shallow $\left(\sim\!55\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and correlates with a $P$ -wave velocity increase of ${\sim}100$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ . The limestone of Subunit Ic represents a discrete interval where $P$ -wave velocity and density increase by ${\sim}40\%$ and porosit y decreases sharply. $P.$ -wave velocity, bulk density, and MS are approximately constant in the Unit II claystone below the limestone.  A gradual decrease in porosity with depth is also observed. NGR values show high variance in Unit II (from 8 to 30 counts/s), reflectin g changes in clay composition and abundance.  

A total of 23 IW samples were collected from Hole U1509A . Profiles of some species show trends similar to those at Site U1508. For example, sulfate concentrations decrease and ammonium concentrations increase downhole, suggesting sulfate reduction of particulate organic matter and release of nitrogen to pore waters. Furthermore, at ${\sim}370\;\mathrm{m},$ , sulfate concentrations drop below $1.0\:\mathrm{mM}$ and methane concentrations start to rise. This suggests further sulfate consumption by AOM at a deep sulfate–methane transitio n (SMT). Reduction of sulfate leads to production of hydrogen sulfide, which reacts with iron to form pyrite (Snyder et al., 2007), which is present in many cores from this hole. Below the SMT, headspace methane concentrations increase to 15,000 ppmv an d dissolved Ba concentrations increase to $0.4\mathrm{~mM}$ . Such values ar e common to slope environments of many continental margins.  

Bulk  sediment  chemistry  corresponds  to  lithostratigraphi c units. Unit I is characterized by carbonate contents that decreas e downhole from ${\sim}94\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to ${\sim}65~\mathrm{wt\%}$ between 360 and 38 0 m. Carbonate content varies little in the uppermost $200\ \mathrm{m}$ , but b y more than $10\%$ in the lower part. Carbonate content drops drastically across the Unit I–II transition $\left(415\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , to average values of 1 8 and $0.5\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ in Subunits IIa and IIb, respectively. TOC contents ar e ${\sim}0.3\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ in Unit I and Subunit IIa and ${\sim}1.0~\mathrm{wt\%}$ in Upper Cretaceous Subunit IIb.  

# Site U1510 (southern Lord Howe Rise)  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1510 (proposed Site LHRS-3A) is located on the souther n Lord Howe Rise, ${\sim}850\,\mathrm{km}$ west of northern New Zealand and ${\sim}495$ km south of Site 206. Site U1510 is ${\sim}80~\mathrm{km}$ west of Site 592 an d ${\sim}105\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest of Site 207. Seismic reflection data can be use d to tie stratigraphy at the three sites but with some uncertaint y caused by unconformities and deformation (Sutherland et al., 2016). Site U1510 was chosen to determine the timing of Cenozoic foldin g on the southern Lord Howe Rise and to constrain the timing of regional tectonic movements and volcanism. The primary drilling objectives at Site U1510 were to (1) constrain the depths and ages fo r the top and base of the syntectonic seismic unit; (2) determine th e nature of the lowest seismic unit and pretectonic state of the southern Lord Howe Rise; and (C) collect evidence for volcanism or vertical  movements,  especially  including  sediments  representin g nearby shallow water of any age. A secondary objective was to collect a continuous late Neogene record for paleoceanographic studies.

After the $380\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit in heavy winds and seas from a waitin g on weather location, the ship arrived at Site U1510 at $0918\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 2 September 2017 $\mathrm{(UTC+11\,h)}$ ).  

An APC/XCB BHA was deployed and coring in Hole U1510 A started at $1915~\mathrm{h}$ on 12 September. Cores 1H through 17H penetrated from 0 to $150.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $147.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(98\%)$ . We stoppe d deploying the orientation tool after Core 15H. Temperature measurements were taken on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, and 17H. W e continued with XCB coring until $1930~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September. Core s 18X through 52X penetrated from 150.5 to $483.4~\mathrm{m}$ and recovere d $108.1\,\mathrm{m}\left(32\%\right)$ . Recovery over portions of this depth interval was seriously compromised because of frequent chert layers. Coring i n Hole U1510A concluded on 14 September with a total penetratio n of $483.4~\mathrm{m}$ and total recovery of $260.0\;\mathrm{m}$ $(53\%)$ . The time spent o n Hole U1510A was $60\,\mathrm{{h}}$ or 2.5 days.  

The ship was offset $20\textrm{m}$ to the east and APC coring in Hol e U1510B began at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September and ended at $0215~\mathrm{h}$ o n 15 September. Cores 1H through 7H penetrated from 0 to $66.3~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $64.7\:\mathrm{m}\:(98\%)$ . An APCT-3 temperature measuremen t was taken on Core 7H. Operations in Hole U1510B and at Sit e U1510 ended at $0815~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September. The time spent on Hol e U1510B was $10.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 0.4 days. At $0842\,\mathrm{h}$ the ship began the transi t to Site U1511.

Lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0{-}138.0\,\mathrm{m})$ is composed of calcareou s ooze and is divided into two subunits. Subunit Ia $(0{-}60.0\ \mathrm{m})$ consists of subtle color banding between light gray and white calcareous ooze. Subunit Ib $(60.0{-}138.0\,\textrm{m})$ is a white homogeneou s calcareous ooze. The Unit I/II boundary is defined by the first occurrence of chert at $138\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Lithostratigraphic Unit II $(138.0{-}418.1\,\mathrm{m})$ ) consists of ${\sim}340\;\mathrm{m}$ o f calcareous ooze and chalk interbedded with cherty limestone an d chert. Unit II is divided into three subunits. Subunit IIa is a ${\sim}9.5\mathrm{~m~}$ thick white homogeneous nannofossil ooze with bioclasts. The upper ${\sim}30~\mathrm{cm}$ of Subunit IIa consists of centimeter-sized extraclast s composed of chert, cherty limestone, and lithic clasts. Although thi s interval could be affected by drilling disturbance (i.e., “fall-in” at th e top of the core), it also contains the first occurrence of chert; simila r material had not been found in the cores above. Subunit IIb $\left(147.5-\right.$ $349.4\;\mathrm{m})$ ) is ${\mathrm{a~201.9~m}}$ thick interval of light gray, moderately bioturbated clayey calcareous chalk with scattered shallow-water bioclast s interbedded with cherty limestone. Subunit IIc $(349.4–478.1\,\mathrm{m})$ is  a $128.7\textrm{m}$ thick homogeneous white nannofossil chalk interbedde d with chert and sparse volcaniclastic beds in the lower portion of th e subunit.  

Core recovery in Unit I was near $100\%$ , with coring disturbanc e limited to up-arching and soupy sediments. Recovery dropped t o $\sim\!20\%$ in Subunits IIa and IIb due to the presence of chert and chert y limestone and the use of the XCB coring system, with drilling disturbance including severe fracturing of chert and cherty limeston e intervals and moderate to severe biscuiting of the calcareous chal k intervals.  

Nannofossils are generally abundant with moderate preservation. Planktonic foraminifer abundance and preservation decreas e downhole (from 215 and $187\,\textrm{m}$ , respectively) with a few barre n samples. Radiolarians are rare throughout, except for a short middl e Miocene interval (109.6 to $119.7\ \mathrm{m})$ ) where radiolarians are common. Radiolarian preservation is good in the upper $135\;\mathrm{m}$ and poo r farther downhole. Benthic foraminifers were recovered at generall y low abundance from all cores, with very good preservation for th e Neogene and generally poor preservation for the Paleogene. Ostracods are very abundant in most samples with good preservatio n from 0 to $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ and with poor preservation below. Due to weathe r constraints on processing, no samples from Site U1510 were analyzed for palynology. Paleodepth was lower bathyal from the Pleistocene through the Eocene. During the late and middle Eocene,  a significant component of the benthic fauna appears to be derive d from shallower (shelf, upper bathyal, and middle bathyal) sources.  

Based on nannofossil and foraminifer biostratigraphy, the following ages were determined for the sequence in Hole U1510A: Pleistocene $^{7}5.0{-}33.5\ \mathrm{m})$ , Pliocene $(43.1{-}70.3\mathrm{~m})$ , Miocene (72.3– $135.4~\mathrm{m})$ ), and late, middle, and early Eocene (138.8–147.7, 150.5– 438.9, and $448.9–478.2\;\mathrm{m}$ , respectively).  

Low NRM intensity of most cores, low core recovery, and significant core disturbance from XCB coring make it difficult to establish shipboard magnetostratigraphy at Site U1510.  

Physical property measurements show a gradual increase i n bulk density and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity with depth in the nannofossil an d foraminiferal ooze of Unit I. In Subunits IIa and IIb, from 140 t o ${\sim}350\ \mathrm{~m~},$ physical property measurements are less reliable an d sparse due to drilling disturbance and low recovery, respectively. Bulk density $({\sim}1.75\mathrm{~g/cm^{3}})$ and $P$ -wave velocity $({\sim}1750~\mathrm{m/s})$ increase downhole to $300\mathrm{~m~}$ and then decrease again to the base o f Subunit IIb, where fewer chert layers are observed. MS and NG R both increase downhole in these two subunits then decrease towar d the base of Subunit IIb. $P$ -wave velocity peaks and spikes in NGR i n Subunit IIc correlate with sandstone and claystone. Near the base o f the hole $\left(\sim\!470\mathrm{~m}\right)$ where sediments become more lithified, densit y and velocity increase and porosity decreases.  

Headspace samples from Site U1510 yielded hydrocarbon ga s concentrations below detection limits.  

A total of $118\,\mathrm{\:IW}$ samples were taken from Site U1510 b y squeezing whole-round sediment and by Rhizon sampling (Dicken s et al., 2007). Ca concentrations increase and $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K concentrations decrease downhole, similar to Sites U1506 and U1507. Thes e profiles may result from the reaction of pore water with volcani c material in the sediment. Sulfate and ammonium concentratio n profiles mirror each other, suggesting sulfate reduction of organi c matter. Dissolved Sr, Si, Li, and B concentrations increase downhole, likely reflecting dissolution of biogenic carbonate and silica. Dissolved Mn and Fe concentrations decrease within the uppermost meter, suggesting the true mudline is missing. Dissolved F e concentrations in Rhizon samples decrease rapidly over the upper  8 to $10\;\mathrm{m}$ , consistent with the odor of $\mathrm{H}_{2}S$ at ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

Carbonate content is ${>}90\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ in Unit I and in Subunits IIa an d IIc, corresponding to calcareous ooze and chalk lithologies. In Subunit IIb, carbonate content decreases downhole toward the middl e of the subunit, along with decreasing $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}$ and increasing NGR. Interbedded cherty and tuffaceous layers are distinguished by carbonat e contents of ${<}50$ and ${<}20\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively. TOC content is mostl y below detection limit but is represented by somewhat higher value s $(0.35\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ below $400\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

Coring of Hole U1510B was monitored in near real tim e through out-of-sequence measurement of whole-round sections. Using primarily NGR data, cores from Holes U1510A and U1510 B were depth shifted to construct a composite depth scale. A splice d record was generated using the composite scale, which provides  a continuous record of the top ${\sim}44\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment at Site U1510.  

# Site U1511 (Tasman Abyssal Plain)  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1511 (proposed Site TASS-2A) is located on the Tasma n Abyssal Plain, ${\sim}945\,\mathrm{km}$ east of Australia and ${\sim}990\,\mathrm{km}$ northwest o f New Zealand. Site U1511 lies west of the Lord Howe Rise on oceanic crust of Late Cretaceous age that is thought to have forme d during Chron C33 $(74{-}84\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ). Regional seismic reflection data reveal a thick $\left(>\!800\mathrm{~m}\right)$ sequence of sediments deformed by revers e faults and folds (Sutherland et al., 2016). Site U1511 was chosen t o find the age of this deformation and to provide the second comprehensive record of sedimentation on the Tasman Abyssal Plain. Th e primary drilling objectives at Site U1511 were to sample (1) the to p of the middle seismic unit to constrain the age of folding and (2) th e rest of the sedimentary sequence to develop an understanding o f this significant abyssal location. The only previous scientific borehole into Tasman Abyssal Plain sediments was drilled in 1973 a t DSDP Site 283, $870~\mathrm{km}$ to the southwest and on conjugate crust o f Late Cretaceous age east of southeast Australia.

The ship completed the transit from Site U1510 and arrived a t Site U1511 at $1248\,\mathrm{h}$ on 16 September 2017 $\mathrm{(UTC+11\,h)}$ . RCB coring in Hole U1511A began at $0425\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 September. After retrieving Core 3R, the drill string had to be pulled clear of the seafloo r due to excessive heave and wind. Cores 1R through 3R penetrate d from 0 to $26.6\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $7.9\:\mathrm{m}\:(30\%)$ . A total of $19.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 0. 8 days were spent on Hole U1511A.  

After waiting for $17\,\mathrm{{h}}$ because of weather, Hole U1511B was initiated at $0145~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September by washing down (i.e., drillin g without coring and without a center bit installed) to $19.8\;\mathrm{m}$ . Corin g resumed at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September, and Cores 2R through 7R penetrated from 19.8 to $77.2\,\mathrm{m}$ . A center bit was deployed and the interval from 77.2 to $192.2\textrm{m}$ was drilled without coring to ensure w e could reach the target depth in the remaining time of the expedition. Coring resumed at $1500~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September, and Cores 9 R through 41R penetrated from 192.2 to $508.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . At $1600~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 0 September, coring was suspended due to excessive heave and th e drill string was raised above the bottom of the hole. As the swell began to subside at $1030~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 September, the drill string was lowered back to the bottom of the hole. After pumping a 25 barrel mu d sweep, coring resumed at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 September and ended wit h the recovery of the last core (47R) at $0450~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 September. Th e total cored interval in Hole U1511B was $431.4~\mathrm{m}$ and recovery wa s $279.3\mathrm{~m~}(65\%)$ . Two intervals were drilled without coring for a total of $134.8\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The rig floor was secured for transit to Hobart at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 2 September, ending Hole U1511B and Site U1511. A total of $110.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 4.6 days were spent on Hole U1511B. The total time at Sit e U1511 was $130.0\,\mathrm{h}$ or 5.4 days. This included $40.5\,\mathrm{{h}}$ lost because o f weather.

Three lithostratigraphic units were described and are differentiated by the presence or absence of microfossils. Unit I $(0{-}77.2\;\mathrm{m})$ i s ${\sim}80\,\mathrm{m}$ of gray to brown clay, with calcareous nannofossils restricte d to the lowermost $40\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ of the unit. Unit II $(201.9{-}403.4\,\mathrm{m})$ is separated from Unit I by a ${\sim}120~\mathrm{m}$ drilled interval and consists of ${\sim}200$ m of greenish gray to yellowish brown diatomite with minor abundances of clay and other siliceous microfossils (radiolarians, spong e spicules, ebridians, and silicoflagellates). Unit III $(403.4{-}560.7\;\mathrm{m})$ i s $\mathord{\sim}150\;\mathrm{m}$ of claystone. A ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ reddish brown interval near the to p of Unit III contains minor abundances of radiolarians. A ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{~m~}$ grayish green interval near the bottom of the unit contains mino r abundances of calcareous nannofossils.  

A variety of secondary minerals are present throughout Sit e U1511, attesting to diagenesis and alteration. Manganese nodule s and black specks of sulfides occur in Unit I, whereas sporadic centimeter-scale nodules and specks of pink rhodochrosite occur in Uni t II. Several centimeter-scale intervals of greenish gray clayston e within Units II and III contain sand-sized grains of native coppe r surrounded by dark green halos. The lower part of Unit II also contains cristobalite and an interval of red and pink fluorapatite. Furthermore, a color gradient across Unit III from red and reddis h brown at the top of the unit to greenish gray toward the base, wit h alternations of the two colors in the intervening interval, seems t o be related to trace amounts of redox-sensitive metal oxides. Thes e minerals suggest a complex history of diagenesis and alteration, th e latter likely mediated by past fluid flow.  

Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers are generally absent throughout Site U1511. When present, their abundance s and preservation states are varied. Radiolarians are present fro m 192 to $547~\mathrm{m}$ and are abundant from 209 to $394\;\mathrm{m}$ , with good preservation. Below, radiolarians are less abundant and poorly preserved.  

Benthic foraminifers are sparse in the Pliocene to lower Eocen e interval, where a low-diversity agglutinated assemblage was recognized. The transition to a higher diversity Paleocene to lowermos t Eocene assemblage was observed at the contact between lithostratigraphic Units II and III. The Paleocene interval contains both agglutinated and calcareous taxa. Samples are barren of ostracods an d palynomorphs. Given the overall microfossil assemblages, the location of Site U1511 has probably been abyssal and beneath or nea r the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) since the Paleocene.  

Rare nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers found throug h the Pliocene, Miocene, lower Oligocene, and Paleocene interval s were used to constrain age where possible (Figure F11). Based o n planktonic foraminifers, Pliocene $(7.5{-}7.6\ensuremath{\,\mathrm{m}})$ ), lower Pliocene to upper Miocene $(7.5{-}47.6\,\textrm{m})$ ), and possible Miocene $(65.6{-}65.7\,\mathrm{~m})$ strata were recognized. Based on calcareous nannofossils, the lowe r Oligocene $(192.2{-}204.0\,\mathrm{m})$ was identified; however, sediments fro m this level may have come from the drilled interval and may not be i n situ.  

Based on radiolarian biostratigraphy, upper Eocene (209–23 5 m), lower to middle Eocene $(235{-}389\;\mathrm{m})$ , and Paleocene (432–53 9 m) strata were recognized. The lower to middle Paleocene (538.8– $539.4\;\mathrm{m})$ ) was also identified based on nannofossil biostratigraphy.  

High-quality paleomagnetic data were obtained across interval s of Units II and III. From Cores 371-U1511B-14R through 30 R $(\sim\!240\!-\!400~\mathrm{~m~})$ , all polarity reversals from the base of Chro n $C17\mathrm{n}.3\mathrm{n}$ to Chron C21n are identified, indicating that Unit II i n Hole U1511B spans from $\mathord{\sim}38$ to $47.5\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Bartonian–Lutetian). Four magnetic polarity reversals within Core 38R can be successfully correlated with Chrons $C24\mathrm{n}.1\mathrm{n}$ to $C24.2\mathrm{n}$ $\left({\sim}53\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ .  

The remanence intensity of sediments from Units II and III exhibits possible cycles. These variations appear related to lithologi c color changes, where brown intervals generally have a higher magnetization compared to the lower magnetization in the gray sediment intervals. Such changes may be related to magnetic minera l diagenesis. Many samples in Unit III show magnetically hard NR M behavior that is resistant to AF demagnetization. Such a hard remanence component is carried by hematite, which probably contributes to the reddish sediment color in Unit III.  

Cube samples from Units II and III show reliable AMS data an d distinct patterns for Units II and III. Samples from Unit II indicate  a random orientation of the AMS tensor, which probably reflects  a random deposition of minerals without sediment compaction. I n contrast, sediments from Unit III exhibit a well-defined oblate AM S fabric, as typical for compacted sedimentary rocks.  

Porosity decreases downhole from $80\%$ to $65\%$ in Unit I along  a trend typical for pelagic clay. This trend continues in Unit III (fro m $60\%$ to $45\%$ ). However, in Unit II porosity is offset to extremely hig h values $(70\%{-}83\%)$ . This general profile is mirrored in bulk densit y and is attributed to the diatomite with clay in Unit II. $P$ -wave velocity increases linearly downhole, with the exception of two peaks i n the lower part of Unit II $(1750~\mathrm{m/s})$ and the middle part of Unit II I $(1850\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ ). MS values vary between 5 and 50 IU in Unit I and nea r the top of Unit III and are much lower in Unit II and in the lowe r part of Unit III. NGR shows a similar trend and both MS and NG R appear to correspond to clay content. All color reflectance parameters $(\boldsymbol{\mathrm{L}^{*}},\boldsymbol{\mathrm{a}^{*}}$ , and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) increase downhole from 200 to $300\;\mathrm{m}$ and the n decrease from 300 to $400\;\mathrm{{m},}$ , corresponding to the diatomite in Uni t II. A step increase in bulk density $(1.50\mathrm{-}1.75\;\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ , MS, NGR, an d $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{*}$ , associated with a decrease in porosity (from $70\%$ to $52\%$ ), is attributed to a red claystone interval in the top of Unit III $[\sim\!410\$ m).  

Headspace samples from Site U1511 yielded no light hydrocarbon gas concentrations above detection limits.  

Low contents of carbonate $^{\prime}{<}15\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ) and TOC $(<\!0.4\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) prevail throughout the sedimentary column at Site U1511. Carbonat e contents only rise ${>}1\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ in samples from two intervals: at the bottom of Unit I $(71{-}77\;\mathrm{m})$ and within the lower half of Unit III (490– $539\,\mathrm{m}$ ).  

A total of $50~\mathrm{IW}$ samples were collected at Site U1511 by tw o methods: squeezing and Rhizon sampling. At the precision require d to understand basic processes at Site U1511, squeeze and Rhizo n samples give similar profiles for most dissolved species. These profiles show some general trends, as well as some unusual features. This reflects a combination of lithology and multiple processes.  

As also observed at other Expedition 371 sites, modest oxidation of particulate organic carbon leads to production of alkalinit y and $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ and removal of $^\mathrm{SO}_{4}{}^{2-}$ . Limited dissolution of biogenic silica occurs, which increases dissolved $\mathrm{H}_{4}\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ (particularly in Uni t II). Dissolved Ca increases and dissolved $\mathrm{Mg}$ and K decrease downhole, suggesting reactions with silicate minerals. However, th e change in Ca relative to $\mathrm{Mg}$ with respect to depth is much greater a t Site U1511 than at other Expedition 371 sites, which probably results from reactions with underlying basalt rather than sediment o r continental crust. Many species display an inflection in concentrations at ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ and a major drop in concentrations at ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ . Th e first change probably results from the major increase in porosity associated with diatomite; the latter change probably represents th e conversion of biosilica to cristobalite and the release of water. Dissolved Mn increases slightly in the upper $80\textrm{m}$ but sharply belo w $200\ \mathrm{m},$ reaching an extreme of $357~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at $421\;\mathrm{m}$ . Such high value s suggest dissolution of Mn oxides in the lower layer of the sedimen t column. Ammonium concentrations are below the detection limi t across the uppermost $20\ \mathrm{m}$ , which may indicate a deep horizon o f ammonia oxidation.  

Physical property, paleomagnetic, and biostratigraphic dat a were compiled to locate middle Eocene climate events in Hol e U1511B. Interpretation of magnetic inclination and radiolarian assemblages indicates the MECO was recovered in sediment of Cor e 371-U1511B-16R. The putative C19r hyperthermal event (Edgar e t al., 2007) may be present in sediment of Core 18R, based on natural magnetic remanence data.  

# Summary of scientific results Regional stratigraphy  

Expedition 371 retrieved the sedimentary section at six site s (Table T1) in a vast remote region (Figure F2). Only two continent s on Earth remain largely unexplored: Antarctica and Zealandia. Th e observations made at these six sites represent a substantial gain i n fundamental knowledge about northern Zealandia, which is simila r in size to India (Mortimer et al., 2017). The only previous borehole s in the region that penetrated strata older than late Eocene were a t DSDP Sites 206, 207, and 208 (Shipboard Scientific Party et al., 1973a, 1973b, 1973c), and these sites were drilled in 1971, before regional seismic reflection data were available and their context wa s understood.  

At five sites, we sampled nannofossil and foraminiferal ooze an d chalk that contained volcanic or volcaniclastic intervals with variable clay content (Figure F10). The Paleocene and Cretaceous sections are generally clay rich or predominantly claystone. At the final site (U1511), a sequence of abyssal clay and diatomite was recovere d with only minor carbonate. The ages at the base of the deepest hol e at each site varied from Eocene to Cretaceous, and sedimentatio n rates were moderate to high $(5{-}20\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{My})$ ) for the lower bathyal an d abyssal environments within which most sediments accumulate d (Figures F11, F12).  

Our new results provide the first substantial basis for definitio n of formal lithostratigraphic units that can be mapped across a substantial part of northern Zealandia and related to onshore regions o f New Caledonia and New Zealand.  

# Paleogeography and vertical tectonic motions  

Flat unconformities have been mapped across large parts of th e Lord Howe Rise using seismic reflection data and have been tentatively interpreted as surfaces produced by sea level–modulated erosion (Sutherland et al., 2010). Similar surfaces also have bee n identified in the Reinga Basin (Bache et al., 2012). Our discovery o f shallow-water $\left(<\!400\mathrm{~m}\right)$ fossils at several sites near these horizon s provides the first compelling evidence of substantial vertical motions during the Cenozoic. The detailed age models we have constructed and paleoenvironmental interpretations we have made wil l allow us to construct new paleogeographic maps of northern Zealandia, with broad implications for studies of tectonics, climate, an d biogeography.  

Ocean circulation and sedimentation models are sensitive t o paleobathymetry, and geodynamic models make predictions of vertical motions that control paleogeography. Therefore, our primar y and secondary science objectives are closely aligned. Our new observations of sediment distribution combined with fossils provid e independent evidence for past vertical positions and paleogeography. Our new data confirm the hypothesis that Eocene vertical motions were dramatic and regional in nature. Importantly, th e paleogeography of the early Eocene and older cannot be easily inferred from looking at the present physiography.  

# Timing and style of deformation  

The southern four sites (U1508–U1511) are located adjacent t o reverse faults and folds. For all four sites, high-quality age model s were constructed that can be tied to seismic reflection images an d hence provide strong constraints on the time period when faultin g and folding occurred. Additional postexpedition work is required t o model ties between depth and TWT on seismic reflection sections, but preliminary estimates suggest that faulting and folding occurre d during the late Eocene to early Oligocene. At Sites U1508 an d U1510, there is some evidence that faulting and folding starte d somewhat earlier (during the middle Eocene) than at the other sites.  

# New Caledonia Trough subsidence  

Existing subduction initiation models do not predict the Ne w Caledonia Trough feature, which we have now confirmed from ou r observations at Sites U1507 and U1509 was either created or greatl y modified during the Eocene. Future work will focus on the development of a new class of subduction initiation geodynamic model tha t can fit our observations.  

# Volcanic history  

The Pacific Ring of Fire was created during the Eocene whe n subduction initiated throughout the western Pacific. In the Izu-Bonin-Mariana system, the onset of volcanic activity associated wit h the new subduction system started at ${\sim}52$ Ma (Arculus et al., 2015b). Our proximal sites (U1507 and U1508) are located in appropriate locations to record the onset of volcanic activity in the uppe r Eocene and Oligocene (i.e., well after $52\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ ). Additional postexpedition analyses are required to determine the precise age an d type of volcanic activity.  

# Paleoceanography and diagenesis  

Thirty years ago and following the three previous scientific drilling expeditions to the Tasman Sea (DSDP Legs 22, 29, and 90), Kennett  and  von  der  Borch  (1986)  summarized  the  Cenozoi c paleoceanography of the region. The work remains staple readin g but also highlights three well-known biases within the paleoceanographic community: (1) the proportion of text that discusses th e Paleogene as compared to the Neogene is approximately $26\%$ , whereas the Paleogene represents ${\sim}65\%$ of the combined geological time; (2) the findings come from extrapolations across a vast an d poorly mapped area, but the sites were selected to minimize stratigraphic complexity; and (3) the detailed records come without full disclosure of diagenetic reactions that can modify the signal. Expedition 371 presents an opportunity to address each of these issue s and for fresh interpretations and balanced perspectives on a classi c region for Cenozoic climate study. We find that sediment accumulation and diagenesis across the Tasman Sea are highly variable i n space and time. Some of this heterogeneity relates to tectonic history, as described above.  

# Quaternary sediment cycles and bryozoan fossils  

Two sites hold Quaternary records amenable for paleoceanographic study. The upper section of Site U1510 on the souther n Lord Howe Rise was recovered by APC coring in two holes that ca n be spliced together to form a $44.5~\mathrm{m}$ continuous section spannin g most of the late Pleistocene. The section contains calcareous ooz e with obvious cycles in physical properties, such as color and grai n size. Site U1508, northwest of northern New Zealand has a nearl y $100\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Pleistocene section. Though rotary cored, layers wit h macroscopic fragments of bryozoans and other shallow-water organisms present an intriguing and unusual find. The site is at  a “temperate carbonate” margin (Nelson and Hancock, 1984) tha t provides an opportunity to study coupling between sedimentolog y and large-amplitude variations in sea level.  

# Late Miocene to early Pliocene biogenic bloom  

Four sites recovered carbonate-rich sediment in which to asses s the so-called late Miocene–early Pliocene biogenic bloom. Thi s phenomenon, which is recognized from sediment sections at multiple ocean drilling sites, can be described as follows: at zones of surface water divergence in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, th e accumulation rates of biogenic components to the seafloor was significantly elevated between about 8 and 3 Ma. Similar to previousl y drilled DSDP sites from the Tasman Sea, carbonate accumulatio n rates rose dramatically at northern Sites U1506 and U1507 from  8 to 3 Ma. However, a condensed interval marks the stratigraphic records at southern Sites U1509 and U1510. This may indicate underlying changes in deepwater flow during the late Miocene and earl y Pliocene.  

# Eocene to Oligocene interval and presence of biogenic silica  

Previous drilling in the Tasman Sea recovered little sedimen t that was deposited between the middle Eocene and middle Oligocene. This led to the widely accepted idea of a regional unconformity caused by intensification of deepwater currents. We apparentl y recovered complete Oligocene sections at Sites U1507 and U1509 i n the New Caledonia Trough, with all calcareous biozones and mos t polarity chrons identified at the first site. However, a hiatus of variable duration was found at shallow sites on Lord Howe Rise between the upper Eocene and upper Oligocene at Site U1508 an d between the upper Eocene and middle Miocene at Site U1510. Notably, the middle Eocene through lower Oligocene interval, wher e found, including Site U1511 on the Tasman Abyssal Plain, contain s biosilica or chert. Postexpedition effort will be placed on understanding whether these observations support unusual oceanography or a different paleogeography to that in existing compute r simulations.  

# Regional Paleogene climate records  

Several Paleogene sediment sections exposed in New Zealan d and New Caledonia have become the focus of paleoclimate research. This has primarily arisen because, once placed onto accurate age models, lithologic variations at key sites, such as Mea d Stream in South Island, correspond to established changes in global climate. Several Expedition 371 sites contain lithostratigraphic records where changes in sediment composition appear to correlat e with those now uplifted on land. This is particularly true for Sit e U1508 in the Reinga Basin.  

# Eocene warm worlds and hyperthermals  

Earth surface temperatures peaked during several time interval s of the early and middle Eocene. These events especially include th e MECO $({\sim}40.5\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , the EECO (53–49 Ma), and a series of geologica l brief “hyperthermals,” such as the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; $56\,\mathrm{Ma}^{\mathrm{}}$ ). These events generally were not recovered a t most sites during Expedition 371. At Sites U1507 and U1508, poorl y recovered horizons seem to mark the MECO. Sites U1508 an d U1510 terminated near the top of the lower Eocene for reasons o f operational time. At Site U1509, almost the entire early Eocene appears to have slumped on a surface approximately coincident wit h the PETM. It is possible that lithologic changes associated wit h warm events, such as clay-rich horizons and surrounding chert, make them difficult to recover in deep holes. Despite the above difficulties, an apparently complete MECO interval was recovere d from the Tasman Abyssal Plain at Site U1511.  

# Paleocene and Maastrichtian claystones  

Paleogene calcareous green claystone was found at Sites U150 9 and U1511. At the former site, coring also recovered dark brow n Maastrichtian claystone. Considering exposed sections on land an d past drill sites in the region, Paleogene clays accumulated over  a widespread area of Zealandia. At Site U1511 and some locations, these clays contain modest organic carbon.  

# Thermogenic gas  

Routine headspace gas sampling revealed significant concentrations of light hydrocarbon gases in deep sediments at two locations. Methane concentrations began increasing below ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ within th e middle Eocene nannofossil chalk at Site U1508 and below ${\sim}400~\mathrm{m}$ within the Eocene calcareous claystone at Site U1509. At both locations, ethane and propane were also detected, although the $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratio did not drop below 100. The suites of hydrocarbons measure d were not classified as “anomalous” but do suggest burial of strat a containing organic carbon and thermogenic hydrocarbon production in the Reinga Basin and the southern New Caledonia Trough.  

# Deep anaerobic oxidation of methane  

Upward-migrating gas at Sites U1508 and U1509 (above) impacts pore water chemistry significantly. At both sites, dissolve d sulfate concentrations steadily decrease, almost linearly, from nea r seawater values at some shallow depth to zero at the depth wher e methane concentrations begin to rise. These deep SMTs, ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ a t Site U1508 and ${\sim}400\;\mathrm{m}$ at Site U1509, probably represent location s of AOM. Abundant pyrite is found in sediment near the SMTs, an d dissolved Ba concentrations rise steeply beneath the SMTs. Interestingly, at Site U1508, sulfate concentrations begin decreasing a t ${\sim}290\,\mathrm{~m~}$ rather than at the seafloor, possibly because of majo r changes in the porosity of sediment. In any case, these two Expedition 371 sites, along with a few other sites recently drilled elsewhere, significantly expand the subbottom depth range over which AO M can occur.  

# Sediment compaction and ooze–chalk transition  

Calcareous ooze, dominantly comprising microscopic calcit e shells, blankets a large area of the modern seafloor above the CCD. With time and burial, this ooze can become compacted and altere d to chalk and ultimately limestone. Reduction in porosity (Figur e F13) and lithification over the transition zone from ooze to chal k has long fascinated the marine geoscience community, as it affect s the velocity of seismic waves, the recovery of core, and the nature o f calcareous components. Analysis of previous DSDP drilling emphasized the complex nature of the ooze–chalk transition in the Tasman Sea. Cores and data from Expedition 371 provide ne w empirical data to quantify relationships between sediment composition, burial history, compaction, and diagenesis and may help clarify our understanding of the underlying processes. The ooze–chal k transition was found at approximately 235, 290, 200, 55, and $150\;\mathrm{m}$ at Sites U1506, U1507, U1508, U1509, and U1510, respectively. Th e very shallow transition in middle Miocene sediment at Site U150 9 probably reflects missing overburden that was lost by slumping. The other depths appear related to differences in age, compaction, and sediment composition.  

# Iron oxide and copper mineralization  

Vivid red-orange (2.5YR 5/6) claystone and native copper surrounded by dark green halos were found in multiple intervals o f lower Eocene sediment at Site U1511. The striking color of the claystones comes from hematite, as determined from rock magneti c properties. Although the thickest and most striking horizon approximately coincides with the EECO (see above), both observations and theoretical arguments suggest the unusual mineralogy i s not primary but the product of alteration. Presumably, saline fluid s lacking dissolved oxygen and sulfur but carrying dissolved iron an d copper precipitated minerals as they passed through the sediment, perhaps along fractures. Notably, seismic profiles show that Eocen e and older strata at the site are folded and faulted. Native copper ha s been described at previous scientific drill sites, and a commonalit y seems to be proximal folding and faulting.  

# Rotary drilling and pore water collection  

Coring with the APC system in multiple holes and the construction of spliced records has become a common approach for drillin g expeditions with paleoceanography or biogeochemistry objectives. To achieve the Expedition 371 goals, which required deep drillin g (and ultimately within a significantly shortened time window), th e sedimentary records at most sites were recovered mostly in on e hole, often using the RCB system. Although not ideal, good first-order sedimentary records and pore water profiles could be generate d at most sites. Notably, at sites where intervals were cored using bot h the XCB and RCB methods, the latter generally gave better qualit y cores in a shorter time period. To obtain reasonably good and detailed pore water profiles with minimal impact to the sedimentar y record, Rhizon samples were taken at some sites and squeeze samples were taken from the bases of core Sections 1, 6, or both. Suc h sampling generally avoids splice intervals (i.e., the core gaps create d by IW sampling fall into “off-splice” intervals).  

# Operations  

# Port call  

Expedition 371 started at $0812\,\mathrm{h}$ (all times are $\mathrm{UTC}+10\,\mathrm{h})$ ) o n 27 July 2017 with the first line ashore at Wharf 10 in Townsville, Australia. The Co-Chief Scientists and IODP staff moved onto th e ship and began port call activities, including meetings with the offgoing staff and discharging and receiving cargo.  

The rest of the Expedition 371 scientists boarded the ship in th e morning of 28 July and, after checking into their cabins, receive d various introductory presentations as well as laboratory safet y tours. The Siem Offshore crew change was completed. Fresh foo d and other catering supplies were loaded on board. Three public shi p tours were held. Toward the end of the day, we began loading 45 0 metric tons of marine gas oil, which was transported alongside b y trucks and then pumped on board.  

Fueling was finished at $0100\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 July. We made progress o n the subsea camera hydraulic system upgrade but were not able t o complete it during this short port call. The Expedition 371 scientist s received several presentations, including an introduction to th e project science from the Co-Chief Scientists, an overview of the education and outreach (E&O) plans from the two E&O Officer s aboard, and an introduction to the expedition work plan from th e Expedition Project Manager (EPM). The Captain and other senio r Siem Offshore personnel met with the scientists and provided shi p safety information. The EPM then led the scientists on laborator y tours for an overview of scientific equipment, procedures, and wor k responsibilities. The passage plan for the expedition transits wa s completed and arrangements were made with the agent and immigration for a departure at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 July.  

The ship left Townsville with the last line released at $0712\,\mathrm{h}$ o n $30\,\mathrm{July}.$ . The first fire and life boat safety drill was held for all aboard. The Co-Chief Scientists and EPM met with each laboratory team t o discuss requirements, tasks, and issues, and the teams began to prepare for their work.  

# Site U1506  

Hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1. All times are local ship time $\mathrm{(UTC+10}$ h). All depth references in meters in this section refer to the DS F depth scale, unless noted otherwise.  

Site U1506 was the first site occupied during Expedition 371. After an $1167~\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Townsville, Australia, the ship arrived at Site U1506 at $1912\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 August 2017. The thrusters wer e lowered and the dynamic positioning system was engaged. At 194 8 h, the drill floor was cleared for operations, beginning Hol e U1506A. At $2033\,\mathrm{h}$ , a seafloor positioning beacon was deployed.  

The RCB BHA was assembled and deployed. All drill string tubulars were strapped and drifted during the pipe trip. The top driv e was picked up and a wiper “pig” was pumped through the dril l string to clean debris from the inside of the drill string prior to coring. The core barrel was deployed and Hole U1506A was spudded a t $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 4 August.  

The seafloor depth was determined to be $1505.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ drillin g depth below rig floor (DRF) based on tagging it with the drill string, establishing a water depth of $1495\;\mathrm{m}$ . RCB coring proceeded at $9.5-$ $9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals through Core 28R $\left(263.1\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ . Core 29R encountere d the expected hard formation at ${\sim}265\mathrm{~m~}$ . We recovered cores in hal f intervals $(4.5{-}5.0\,\mathrm{m}$ length) below this depth to minimize the risk o f core loss due to jams in the bit or inner barrel. We obtained an average core recovery of $76\%$ in this depth interval.  

We decided to stop coring after Core 36R, which arrived on th e rig floor at $1345\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 5 August. Total recovery for the $306.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ drilled in Hole U1506A was $192.38\mathrm{~m~}(63\%)$ . A single 15 barrel mu d sweep of high-viscosity gel mud was pumped during drilling in thi s hole. The drill string was retrieved, disassembled, and inspected; the acoustic beacon was recovered; and the rig floor was secured fo r transit, ending Hole U1506A operations at $1935~\mathrm{h}$ . The time spen t on Hole U1506A (and Site U1506) was $47.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 2.0 days.  

At $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ we departed for Site U1507.  

# Site U1507  

Hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1. All times are local ship time $\mathrm{(UTC+10}$ h). All depth references in meters in this section refer to the DS F depth scale, unless noted otherwise.  

The $286\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1506 concluded with the arriva l at Site U1507 at $2200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 August 2017. After lowering the thrusters and switching to dynamic positioning mode, the rig floor wa s cleared for operations, beginning Hole U1507A at $2225\ \mathrm{h}$ . The ri g crew assembled an APC/XCB BHA by $0130~\mathrm{h}$ on 7 August, picke d up drill pipe and the top drive, and deployed the bit just above th e seafloor. A wiper pig was pumped through the drill string to clea n out potential debris. The nonmagnetic APC core barrels wer e dressed with core liners in preparation to spudding Hole U1507A a t $1040\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The mudline core recovered $6.2\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , establishing a water depth o f $3568\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . APC coring continued to Core 26H. Given the force required to retrieve the last few APC cores and the overdrilling required on Core 26H, we switched to XCB coring at $1815\ \mathrm{h}$ on  8 August. Given the depth objectives for Site U1507 $\left(>\!700\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , we decided against using the more time consuming half-APC coring system. Recovery of Cores 1H through 26H ranged from $99\%$ to $106\%$ and averaged $104\%$ (total of $243.7\;\mathrm{m}$ cored and $252.7\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered). Temperature measurements were taken with Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, 16H, and 19H. The deployment of orientation and temperature tools was discontinued after Core 20H.  

Coring continued in Hole U1507A with the XCB system. Toward the end of 9 August (at ${\sim}425\;\mathrm{m})$ ) it took ${\sim}100{-}150\,\mathrm{min}$ to cut  a core. Moreover, the quality of the cores was poor, with prominen t biscuiting and abundant fracturing. At $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ , we decided to terminate Hole U1507A, pull the drill string, and start an RCB hole at th e depth where XCB coring became particularly difficult $\left(\sim\!375\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ . Recovery for the XCB cores varied from $6\%$ to $97\%$ and averaged $55\%$ (total of $181.7\;\mathrm{m}$ cored and $100.1\;\mathrm{m}$ recovered). The drill string wa s retrieved from Hole U1507A and cleared the rig floor at $0940~\mathrm{h}$ o n 10 August, ending Hole U1507A. The time spent on Hole U1507 A was $83.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 3.5 days.  

The ship was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ to the east of Hole U1507A. An RC B BHA was made up with a center bit installed in the core barrel tha t would allow us to drill without coring for the first $375\textrm{m}$ . We included a mechanical bit release (MBR) that would allow us to dro p the bit at the bottom of the hole and then wireline log without retrieving the entire drill string. Drill pipe was deployed, and by 180 0 h on 10 August the bit was just above the seafloor. After picking u p the top drive, we pulled the core barrel with center bit and pumpe d a wiper pig through the drill string to clean out debris observe d during drill string assembly. The core barrel with center bit wa s then dropped back in place and drilling in Hole U1507B began a t $2045\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 10 August. Drilling without coring in Hole U1507 B reached $376\;\mathrm{m}$ by $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 August. The center bit was remove d from the core barrel, and coring began at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ and concluded a t $1000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 August. Cores 2R through 53R penetrated from 376. 0 to $864.4~\mathrm{m}$ with a total recovery of $371.5\mathrm{~m~}(76\%)$ . Recovery for th e RCB cores varied between $1\%$ and $109\%$ . Importantly, the quality o f the RCB cores was superior to those collected by XCB drilling ove r the $50\,\mathrm{m}$ overlap interval. Mud sweeps were pumped for hole cleaning on every third core starting with Core 8R. At the end of coring, Hole U1507B was cleaned with a 25 barrel high-viscosity mu d sweep in preparation for logging.  

Wireline logging began with a wireline trip for the rotary shifting tool (RST) to activate the MBR and drop the coring bit at th e bottom of the hole. The bit was released at $1130~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 August. The RST was recovered, and a second wireline trip was conducte d with the reverse RST to reposition the MBR sleeve into the circulating position. The tool was recovered and the sinker bars removed. From 1230 to $1315\,\mathrm{h},$ the hole was displaced with 245 barrels of 11. 0 ppg mud. The top drive was set back, the end of drill pipe was raise d to the logging depth of $75.2~\mathrm{m}$ , and the rig floor was prepared fo r logging.  

Assembly of the modified triple combo logging tool string bega n at $1700~\mathrm{h}$ . The tool string included MS, electrical resistivity, sonic, bulk density, and NGR tools. The neutron porosity tool often run i n the triple combo and the microresistivity imaging (Formatio n MicroScanner) tool, often run in a separate string together with th e sonic tool, were omitted from the logging plan for this hole. Th e tools were assembled and tested at $1815~\mathrm{h}$ and the tool string wa s lowered into Hole U1507B.  

The wireline active heave compensator was switched on onc e the tools reached open hole. A downhole log was performed fro m just above the seafloor to the bottom of the hole at ${\sim}864\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. The hole was then logged up for a $124~\mathrm{m}$ calibration pass, run bac k to the bottom, and logged up to just below the end of the pipe wher e the caliper was closed prior to entering the BHA. The tools wer e pulled from the hole and were back at the surface at $0200~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 8 August. By $0345\,\mathrm{h},$ all logging equipment was rigged down and th e rig crew began retrieving the drill string.  

Hole conditions were excellent for logging, with a hole diamete r close to the bit diameter ( ${\sim}10$ inches) all the way from the bottom o f the hole $846.4~\mathrm{m}$ WSF) to ${\sim}490\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. Hole conditions were stil l good up to $234\mathrm{~m~WSF}$ , where a bridge with a hole diameter of onl y ${\sim}6$ inches was encountered. Additional bridges were indicated i n the caliper log further uphole and just below the base of the dril l string. The tool string passed these obstructions successfully an d acquired high-quality measurements throughout the open hole. However, several hours of remediation work (washing) would hav e been required before the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) tool coul d have been run as planned, with limited chance of success, significant daylight time restrictions, and a poor weather forecast. Give n the quality of the standard logs, particularly the sonic log, the primary logging scientific objective of tying cores to seismic reflectio n images had been substantially achieved, so we canceled the VSI run.  

While the drill string was recovered, the seafloor positionin g beacon was released and recovered. With bad weather expecte d during the transit to the next site, the drill collars were disassemble d and secured in the drill collar rack. At $1130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 August, the en d of the drill string cleared the rig floor. The rig floor was secured fo r transit at $1150~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{~}}$ , ending Hole U1507B and Site U1507. A total o f $194\,\mathrm{h}$ or 8.1 days were spent on Hole U1507B.  

While raising the thrusters, a hydraulic malfunction occurre d and was repaired, and the transit to Site U1508 began at $1330\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 18 August.  

# Site U1508  

Hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1. All times are local ship time $\mathrm{(UTC+10}$ h for Holes U1508A and U1508B and $\mathrm{UTC}\ +\ 11\ \mathrm{~h~}$ for Hol e U1508C). All depth references in meters in this section refer to th e DSF depth scale, unless noted otherwise.  

We completed the $546\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ transit from Site U1507 to Sit e U1508 at an average speed of $9.5\,\mathrm{kt}$ and arrived at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on $20\,{\mathrm{Au}}.$ - gust 2017. Thrusters and hydrophones were lowered for dynami c positioning and the rig floor was cleared for operations at $2342\,\mathrm{h}$ . A t $_{0130\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 21 August, we deployed an acoustic beacon for hole positioning. An APC/XCB BHA was made up and the drill string wa s assembled and deployed to just above the seafloor. The top driv e was installed, and the nonmagnetic core barrels dressed with cor e liners and the orientation tool were deployed. APC coring in Hol e U1508A started at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August.  

After shooting Core 10H at $1520\ \mathrm{h},$ the core line parted jus t above the sinker bar. The wireline was cut and a new rope socke t was installed. An RCB core barrel was dressed with a fishing shoe, and by $1800~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 August the sinker bars and core barrel wit h Core 10H had been recovered in two wireline trips.  

Use of the core orientation tool was postponed until we cut Cor e 13H because of sandy hole conditions and was discontinued afte r Core 17H because of unstable hole conditions. Temperature measurements were taken on Cores 7H, 9H, 10H, 12H, 14H, and 17H.  

Core 23H had to be drilled over for $40\;\mathrm{min}$ to release it from th e formation. At $0600~\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August, we started to retrieve the drill string and the bit cleared the rig floor at $1140\,\mathrm{~h~}$ , ending Hol e U1508A. Total recovery for the $210.3\;\mathrm{m}$ cored in Hole U1508A wa s $201.13\mathrm{~m~}(96\%)$ . The time spent on Hole U1508A was $36.0\,\mathrm{{h}}$ or 1. 5 days.  

The ship was offset by ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ to the southwest. An RCB BH A was made up and deployed, and the drill pipe was assembled until the bit was just above the seafloor. The top drive was picked up an d drilling without coring in Hole U1508B started at $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ on $22\,{\mathrm{Au}}{\mathrm{.}}$ - gust, with a center bit installed in the core barrel. At $\sim\!75\;\mathrm{m}$ , the drill string became stuck while making a connection. After pumping  a mud sweep, we were able to free the drill string. A total of 85 barrel s of mud were pumped for the next ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of drilling. Drilling ahea d without coring reached the target $(186.6\;\mathrm{m})$ at $2245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August, the center bit was retrieved, and an RCB core barrel was dropped t o begin coring with Core 2R. After achieving low recovery on Core s 23R through 25R and reaching a zone of particular science interes t at ${\sim}417\;\mathrm{m},$ , we decided to cut half cores for Cores 26R through 33R. When recovery began to improve, we switched back to full-lengt h cores with Core 34R.  

RCB coring continued to Core 38R $(503.4\;\mathrm{m})$ , when at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 24 August a medical emergency was declared and drill string recovery began. Cores 2R through 38R penetrated from 186.6 to $503.4\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $133.32\;\mathrm{m}$ $(42\%)$ . Mud sweeps were pumped for hol e cleaning on every third core starting with Core 5R. Core recover y varied from $3\%$ to $104\%$ throughout Hole U1508B.  

The acoustic beacon was released and recovered, the drill strin g was retrieved and set back in the derrick, and the rig floor was secured, ending Hole U1508B at $1320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August. The time spen t on Hole U1508B was $49.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 2.1 days.  

After securing the rig floor for transit, the hydrophones an d thrusters were raised and the $302\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Auckland began a t $1354\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 August. The clocks were advanced $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ for the first tim e at $1400\,\mathrm{h},$ and a second time at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 August. We arrived a t the dock in Auckland at $2106~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 August $\mathrm{(UTC~+~12~h)}$ ). Th e medical evacuee, accompanied by two doctors and the port agent, and a crew member disembarked. The ship left Auckland at $0218\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 August to return to Site U1508. The clock was set back $1~\mathrm{{h}}$ during the transit $(\mathrm{UTC}+11\ \mathrm{h})$ ) and remained that way for the remainder of the Expedition 371 drilling operations. We complete d the $302\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit at an average speed of $10.9~\mathrm{kt}$ and arrived a t $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August. Dynamic positioning was established and th e drill floor was cleared for operations at $0712\,\mathrm{h}$ . The RCB BHA wa s assembled and deployed to the seafloor and Hole U1508C was initiated ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ northwest of Hole U1508B at $1150\;\mathrm{h},$ , with a center bi t installed in the core barrel.  

The plan was to drill to ${\sim}480\;\mathrm{m}$ , ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}$ above total depth of Hol e U1508B, and resume coring. We also decided to spot core two scientifically interesting intervals that had particularly low recovery i n Hole U1508B. After drilling without coring to $278\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , we pulled th e center bit and collected core from 278 to $292.6\:\mathrm{m}$ (Cores 2R throug h 4R) at half-core intervals. The center bit was deployed again to dril l ahead from 292.6 to $316.0\ \mathrm{m}$ before cutting a half core and a ful l core (6R and 7R) from 316.0 to $330.7\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . The center bit was deployed again and drilling without coring advanced from 330.7 t o $450.0\ \mathrm{m}.$ . At $0730~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 August, we retrieved the center bit an d resumed RCB coring until penetration rates slowed to ${\sim}2~\mathrm{m/h}$ . Although short of the desired target depth, at $0300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 August w e decided to stop coring and conduct wireline logging. Collectively, Cores 2R through 38R, and the two interspersed drilled intervals, penetrated from 278.0 to $704.5~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $185.04\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment $65\%$ of cored intervals).  

At the end of coring, the hole was cleaned with a 30 barrel highviscosity mud sweep. Next, the RST was deployed to trigger th e MBR and drop the bit at the bottom of the hole $(0325\,\mathrm{h})$ ). The reverse RST was deployed to shift the MBR sleeve back into the circulation position $(0430\,\mathrm{~h~})$ . Next, the hole was displaced with 19 4 barrels of 11.0 ppg mud and the end of the drill string was set at 86. 7 m. An additional 10 barrels of mud were pumped to ensure the entire hole was displaced with heavy mud.  

At $0745\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 August, assembly of the modified triple comb o logging tool string began. This was the same configuration as use d in Hole U1507B with the exception that no source was installed i n the density tool. The logging tools were deployed at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ and dat a were collected while lowering the tool string to the bottom of th e hole. After logging up $128\,\mathrm{m}$ for a calibration run, the tools were ru n back to the bottom of the hole and the main logging pass began. A t ${\sim}1230\ \mathrm{h},$ the tool string became stuck at ${\sim}270\mathrm{~m~}$ WSF. The loggin g line was cut at the rig floor and terminated with connectors tha t would allow assembly of drill pipe over the logging line to was h down and over the logging tools with the open-ended BHA. Th e logging tools were free at $2105\,\mathrm{h}$ . The tool was pulled to $155\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WSF}$ using the T-bar procedure, when sufficient logging line had been retrieved to make a connection with the aft coring line, which wa s used to pull the logging tools to the surface. The logging tools wer e recovered and cleaned by $0315\mathrm{~h~}$ on 1 September. The drill strin g was recovered and the end of pipe cleared the rig floor at $0650~\mathrm{h}$ . The positioning beacon was recovered, the rig floor was secured fo r transit, the thrusters and hydrophones were raised, and the transi t to Site U1509 began at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 September.  

# Site U1509  

Hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1. All times are local ship time $\mathrm{(UTC+11}$ h). All depth references in meters in this section refer to the DS F depth scale.  

We arrived at Site U1509 at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 September 2017, completing the $273\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1508. After lowering thrusters and hydrophones and establishing dynamic positioning, the ri g floor was cleared for operations at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ . While the RCB BHA wa s being assembled, a seafloor positioning beacon was deployed. Th e drill string was deployed to just above the seafloor and the top driv e was engaged. A wiper pig was pumped through the drill pipe in a n attempt to remove excessive rust observed during drill string assembly.  

Coring in Hole U1509A began at $1825\ \mathrm{h}$ on 2 September an d continued until $2345\;\mathrm{h}$ on 6 September to a total depth of $690.7\mathrm{~m~}$ (Core 74R). The hole was cleaned with 10–15 barrel mud sweeps, which were pumped on every third core for Cores 9R through 49R. Starting with Core 50R the frequency and volume of mud sweep s were increased to every other core and 20–25 barrels, respectively. Total recovery in Hole U1509A was $462.86\mathrm{~m~}(67\%)$ .  

In preparation for logging, Hole U1509A was cleaned with a 3 0 barrel high-viscosity mud sweep. The RST was deployed to trigge r the MBR and drop the bit at the bottom of the hole $[0015\;\mathrm{{h}}$ on  7 September). The reverse RST was deployed to shift the MBR sleev e back into the circulation position $(0145\;\mathrm{h})$ ). Next, the hole was displaced with 214 barrels of 10.5 ppg mud, the top drive was set back, and the drill string was pulled back to the logging depth of $^{81\textrm{m}}$ $(0530\,\mathrm{h})$ . The modified triple combo logging tool string was rigge d up when at $0645\ \mathrm{h}$ the operational decision was made to stop logging operations based on ship heave exceeding $_{3.0\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ . The drill string was retrieved and the rig was secured for transit by $1434~\mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1509A and Site U1509. A total of $127.5\,\mathrm{h}$ or 5.3 day s were spent on Hole U1509A. After recovering the seafloor positioning beacon and retrieving positioning thrusters and hydrophones a t $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 September, the ship began the ${\sim}200\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to th e north to avoid severe weather that was forecast for 9–10 Septembe r at the remaining proposed drilling sites.  

# Site U1510  

Hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1. All times are local ship time $\mathrm{(UTC+11}$ h). All depth references in meters in this section refer to the DS F depth scale.  

After the $380\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit in heavy winds and seas from a waitin g on weather location, the ship arrived at Site U1510 at $0918\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 2 September 2017. The thrusters were lowered, dynamic positionin g was established, and the drill floor was cleared for operations a t $0936\,\mathrm{h}$ . No seafloor positioning beacon was deployed at this site.  

An APC/XCB BHA was assembled and deployed. After the firs t 7 stands of drill pipe were added, the iron roughneck clamping valv e refused to unclamp from the drill pipe. While the repair was takin g place, drill pipe assembly continued using the rig tongs instead o f the iron roughneck for the next 23 stands. When the iron roughneck repair was complete, the remaining 8 stands of drill pipe wer e run. The top drive was picked up, the nonmagnetic core barrel s were dressed with core liners, and the orientation tool was installed. Coring in Hole U1510A started at $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 September.  

APC coring continued through Core 17H, which stroked ou t only ${\sim}3\textrm{m}$ because the cutting shoe impacted a chert layer. At 064 5 $_\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September, we decided to switch to XCB coring. W e stopped deploying the orientation tool after Core 15H. Temperatur e measurements were taken on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, and 17H. The APC cored interval penetrated from 0 to $150.5\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $147.9\;\mathrm{m}\;(98\%)$ .  

XCB coring continued until $1930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September. Cores 18 X through 52X penetrated from 150.5 to $483.4\:\mathrm{m}$ and recovered 108. 1 m $(32\%)$ . Recovery was compromised seriously because of frequen t chert layers.  

Coring in Hole U1510A concluded with a total penetration o f $483.4~\mathrm{m}$ and total recovery of $260.0\;\mathrm{m}\;(53\%)$ . The drill pipe was retrieved from Hole U1510A, clearing the rig floor at $2135~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 4 September and ending Hole U1510A. The time spent on Hol e U1510A was $60\,\mathrm{{h}}$ or 2.5 days.  

The ship was offset $20\textrm{m}$ to the east and APC coring in Hol e U1510B began at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 September with Core 1H and ende d at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September with Core 7H. Nonmagnetic core barrel s were used for Cores 1H through 7H and a single APCT-3 temperature measurement was taken on Core 7H. Cores 1H through 7 H penetrated from 0 to $66.3~\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $64.7\mathrm{~m~}(98\%)$ . The dril l string was recovered and the rig floor was secured for transit a t $0815\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1510B and operations at Site U1510. The tim e spent on Hole U1510B was $10.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 0.4 days.  

The thrusters were raised and at $0842~\mathrm{h}$ on 15 September th e ship began the transit to Site U1511.  

# Site U1511  

Hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1. All times are local ship time $\mathrm{(UTC+11}$ h). All depth references in meters in this section refer to the DS F depth scale.  

The ship completed the $216\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1510 at a n average speed of $7.7~\mathrm{kt}$ and arrived at Site U1511 at $1248~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 6 September 2017. The thrusters were lowered and dynamic positioning was established. No acoustic beacon was deployed at Sit e U1511.  

Logging was eliminated from the operations plan following th e stuck logging tool incident earlier in the cruise. After losing $\mathord{\sim}2000$ m of logging wireline, we could no longer reach the combination o f water depth and hole depth to log Site U1511.  

Operations in Hole U1511A began at $1334~\mathrm{h}$ on 16 Septembe r with the assembly of an RCB BHA. Drill pipe assembly was completed at $0245\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 17 September and a wiper pig was pumpe d through the pipe to clean out potential debris. RCB coring in Hol e U1511A began at $0425\,\mathrm{h}$ . After retrieving Core 3R at $0810\,\mathrm{h}$ , we ha d to pull the drill string clear of the seafloor due to excessive heav e and wind. Cores 1R through 3R penetrated from 0 to $26.6~\mathrm{m}$ an d recovered $7.9\;\mathrm{m}$ $(30\%)$ . A total of $19.25\,\mathrm{h}$ or 0.8 days were spent o n Hole U1511A.  

After waiting from $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 September to $0145\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September $(17\,\mathrm{h})$ for the weather to improve, with the drill string suspended just above the seafloor, we began Hole U1511B by washin g down (i.e., drilling without coring and without a center bit installed ) to $19.8\,\mathrm{~m~},$ near the total depth of Hole U1511A $(26.6~\mathrm{m})$ . We resumed coring from 0215 to $1015~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September and Cores 2 R through 7R penetrated from 19.8 to $77.2\;\mathrm{m}$ . At $1015\,\mathrm{h},$ we deploye d a center bit and drilled without coring from 77.2 to $192.2\:\mathrm{m}$ to accelerate penetration and reach the target depth in the time remainin g for operations on Expedition 371. At $1500~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 September, w e resumed coring and Cores 9R through 41R penetrated from 192.2 t o $508.8~\mathrm{m}$ . At $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 September, coring was suspended due t o excessive heave and the drill string was raised ${\sim}37~\mathrm{m}$ above the bottom of the hole $\left(472\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ , while maintaining circulation and rotatio n in the hole. While waiting for the weather to improve, the ship wa s having difficulties maintaining position. At 0315–0630 h on 21 September, the drill string was raised to 163 mbsf as a precaution. A s the swell began to subside, the drill string was lowered back to th e bottom of the hole at $1030{-}1400\,\mathrm{h}$ . After pumping a 25 barrel mu d sweep and recovering the wash barrel, coring resumed at $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 21 September, following $23.5~\mathrm{h}$ of waiting, and ended with the recovery of the last core (47R) at $0450\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 September.  

During the course of drilling and coring in Hole U1511B, a tota l of 265 barrels of high-viscosity mud were pumped in 15–20 barrel mud sweeps for hole cleaning. The cored interval was $431.4~\mathrm{m}$ an d recovery was $279.3\mathrm{~m~}(65\%)$ . The two intervals drilled without coring amount to $134.8\;\mathrm{m}$ .  

The rig floor was secured for transit to Hobart at $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 2 September, ending Hole U1511B and Site U1511. A total of $110.75\,\mathrm{h}$ or 4.6 days were spent on Hole U1511B. The total time spent at Sit e U1511 was $130.0\,\mathrm{h}$ or 5.4 days. This included $40.5\,\mathrm{{h}}$ lost because o f weather.  

Expedition 371 ended with the first line ashore at $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 6 September.  

# Education, outreach, and media  

E&O immediately before, during, and immediately after a n IODP expedition present a wonderful but challenging aspiration. Clearly, media exposure helps the broad public to understand th e necessity of ocean drilling.  

The current IODP framework importantly includes an E& O component. However, the translation of these efforts to maximiz e science impact remains uncertain.  

Expedition 371 received special media attention, in part becaus e a paper entitled “Zealandia: Earth’s Hidden Continent” (Mortime r et al., 2017) was widely circulated in media and its basic content s were widely read across the globe before the expedition. Anticipating high media attention, we thought to have two education an d outreach personnel (a teacher and a videographer) with somewha t overlapping work-shifts and also to document the experience.  

# Video conferencing  

A total of 52 ship to shore video links were established with 4 1 different international education institutions: 22 in the USA, 22 i n Australia, 4 in New Zealand, and 5 in Europe and South America. Approximately 2600 students and teachers participated (Table T2) . In addition, 8 video links were made with media outlets tha t reached an audience exceeding 100,000 (Table T2).  

# Other conferencing events  

ABC filmed three ship to shore links with the goal of compilin g a documentary on the JOIDES Resolution education and outreac h program run by IODP:  

Pascack Hills High School, New Jersey, USA Monterey Peninsula, California, USA Pennsylvania State College, Pennsylvania, USA  

# Education projects completed at sea  

• A senior high school task was prepared with the topic of interpreting a sedimentary sequence from drill hole data and reconstructing a terrestrial Cretaceous landscape. Students determine what major tectonic events may have occurred for the present sequence to have subsided into a marine sedimentary basin. • A lower to middle primary school task was prepared with the topic of interviewing a geoscientist and looking at how they travel back through time to recreate a paleolandscape.  

# Videography  

The videographer operated the camera for all Zoom sessions and assisted in social media posting by delivering photos and videos and setting up scientists with accounts for posting blogs.  

Seven video clips were uploaded to YouTube and the JOIDES Resolution website (Table T3). These videos cover different topics from leaving port in Townsville, drone footage of the ship, and the drilling and core sampling process. The video titled “Exploring Zealandia” has reached more than 4900 acknowledged views so far since being uploaded. During the expedition, 15 interviews with scientists, technical staff, and the drill crew also were recorded.  

# Media impact  

Expedition 371 had significant media activity (international TV, radio, web, and newspapers) associated with both port calls. A full analysis of the Townsville port call was not attempted, but a brief search of Google News and an analysis done for GNS Science identified ${>}150$ media stories that reached an audience of at least two million people (Table T4). Stories ran in the major newspapers of many countries (e.g., New York Times, Le Figaro, Vangardia, Sydney Morning Herald, etc.). Both Co-Chief Scientists and several of the scientists wrote stories and/or communicated with journalists numerous times during the expedition (e.g., the story written by Sutherland in The Conversation obtained 20,000 views in the week it was written; and was republished by media organizations).  

It was a challenge for the Co-Chief Scientists and many of the scientists involved to manage the time involved in outreach activities and to monitor/quantify the very high levels of media interest during the expedition. Certainly, two people are needed to conduct appropriate E&O activities during IODP expeditions with heavy media attention. This is in part because, at a basic level, one person needs to film and one person needs to interview. How the overall effort should be balanced between a focus on small intimate groups or a focus on large generic populations is a great question. We also acknowledge interesting problems in terms of assessment, namely that a video might be downloaded and presented elsewhere (e.g., in a classroom environment) so as to be seen by many, but a more personal contact might impact an individual to become the next great oceanographer.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment and further work  

The primary drilling objectives of the expedition were mostly completed. All six sites provide new regional stratigraphic and paleogeographic information that can be put into regional context through seismic-stratigraphic interpretation and hence provide strong constraints on geodynamic models of subduction zone initiation. Our new observations can be related directly to the timing of plate failure, the magnitude and timing of vertical motions, and the timing and type of volcanism.  

Secondary  paleoclimate  objectives were not  completed as planned for three primary reasons: (1) the selected sites targeted tectonic objectives, (2) the stratigraphy in this vast region is (with hindsight) more complicated than predicted, and (3) complications due to weather and other unforeseen factors. Nonetheless, significant new records of southwest Pacific oceanography and climate in the past were obtained. Sediments that were cored were more indurated and diagenetically altered than expected. Core recovery was poorer than expected. Operational issues resulted in a lack of time, and hence it was not possible to build spliced intervals. Notably, strata deposited during Eocene hyperthermal events were systematically poorly recovered, even when recovery was good above and below. This was possibly due to higher clay and lower carbonate content (based on wireline logs at Sites U1507 and U1508). We recovered a MECO section at Site U1511, but the site is affected by diagenesis and fluid-mediated reactions. Site U1511 also appears barren of organic carbon suitable for biomarker analysis and has little biogenic carbonate preserved. Miocene sediment that was recovered provides a useful supplement to material collected during Leg 90. A Pliocene–Quaternary spliced section at Site U1510 has orbital cycles evident in physical properties and may provide a significant climate record at a key location.  

All sites were cored to near planned target depths, but operations did not go precisely as anticipated. The original plan included 3.0 days of port call, 12.5 days of transit, and 45.5 days of operations. We lost operational time due to weather, longer transits than planned, stuck logging tools, and a medical emergency, leaving a total of 36.4 days of on-site operations. The breaks in drilling resulted in lower overall efficiency due to time spent tripping drill pipe and re-establishing coring (e.g., through starting a new hole and drilling down with overlap). Wireline logging tools became stuck at Site U1508 and required $2\,\mathrm{km}$ of logging cable to be cut from the winch, which meant it was impossible to log subsequent Site U1511 due to the water depth. Our logging program was abandoned due to sea conditions at Sites U1509 and U1510. We intended to double APC/XCB core at four sites, but a combination of time pressure and hard sediments made this impossible at any site. Despite these operational challenges, the first-order results obtained are highly significant and Expedition 371 can be considered a success.  

Regional stratigraphy resulting from Expedition 371 creates a new framework for understanding the continent of Zealandia, the onshore geology of New Caledonia and New Zealand, and sediment cores collected at DSDP sites in the region. Our results likely will influence a wide range of future studies and provide a new basis for understanding fundamental processes of plate tectonics and paleoclimate.

Figure F5. Stable carbon and oxygen isotope compositions of Cenozoic benthic foraminifers (Zachos et al., 2008) compared to global climate/ocean event s and regional tectonism. Note that the long-term decrease in $\delta^{18}0,$ , interpreted as global cooling and greater continental ice volume, begins during the EECO a t ${\sim}53{-}49$ Ma and thus coincides with significant tectonic change around the Tasman Sea. Oi1 $=$ Oligocene isotope Event 1, MECO $=$ Middle Eocene Climati c Optimum, PETM $=$ Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum.
