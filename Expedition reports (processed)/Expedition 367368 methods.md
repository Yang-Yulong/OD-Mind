# Introduction  

This introduction provides an overview of operations, depth conventions, core handling, curatorial procedures, and analyses performed on the R/V JOIDES Resolution during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditions 367 and 368. These two expeditions were implemented as a single science program; the methods used were intended to be the same for both expeditions. Any differences are clearly noted in this chapter. The information applies only to shipboard work described in the Expedition reports section of the Expedition 367/368 Proceedings of the International Ocean Discovery Program volume. Methods used by investigators for shore-based analyses of Expedition 367 and 368 data will be described in separate individual publications.  

# Site locations  

GPS coordinates (WGS84 datum) from precruise site surveys were used to position the vessel at the Expedition 367 and 368 sites. A SyQwest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloor depth on the approach to each site to confirm the depth profiles from precruise surveys. Once the vessel was positioned at a site, the thrusters were lowered and a positioning beacon was dropped to the seafloor. Dynamic positioning control of the vessel uses navigational input from the GPS system and triangulation to the seafloor beacon (Figure F1) weighted by the estimated positional accuracy. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over a significant portion of the time during which the hole was occupied.

Drilling operations  

The advanced piston corer (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), extended core barrel (XCB), and rotary core barrel (RCB) system s were available during Expeditions 367 and 368. Because samplin g and logging the lowermost sediments and basement were our highest priority objectives, we used the HLAPC during Expedition 36 8 but not during Expedition 367.  

The APC and HLAPC systems cut soft-sediment cores wit h minimal coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems. After the APC/HLAPC core barrel is lowered through the drill pip e and lands above the bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until the tw o shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation and cuts the cor e (Figure F2A). The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke, ” by observing the pressure gauge on the rig floor because the exces s pressure accumulated prior to the stroke drops rapidly. Cores collected with the APC system are denoted by the letter $\ ^{\ast}\mathrm{H},^{\dprime}$ and thos e collected with the HLAPC system are denoted by the letter “F.”  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in one of two ways: (1) th e piston fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from th e pump pressure and recovery reading) because the formation is to o hard or (2) excessive force $\left(>60,\!000\;\mathrm{lb}\right)$ is required to pull the cor e barrel out of the formation. When a full stroke could not b e achieved, one or more additional attempts were typically made, an d with each attempt the bit was advanced by the length of the cor e barrel. Note that these attempts resulted in a nominal recovery o f ${\sim}100\%$ based on the assumption that the barrel penetrated the formation by the length of core recovered. If an APC core does no t achieve a full stroke, the next core can be taken after advancing to  a depth determined by the recovery of the previous core (advance b y recovery) or to a depth of a full APC core (typically $9.7\;\mathrm{m}$ ). When  a full or partial stroke was achieved but excessive force could not retrieve the barrel, the core barrel could be “drilled over,” meaning tha t after the inner core barrel was successfully shot into the formation, the drill bit was advanced to total depth to free the APC barrel.  

The standard APC system uses a $9.5\:\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, wherea s the HLAPC system uses a $4.7\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, the HLAPC system was deployed after the standard APC consistently had ${<}50\%$ recovery. During use of the HLAPC system, th e same criteria were applied in terms of refusal as for the APC system. Use of the HLAPC system allowed for significantly greater AP C sampling depths to be attained than would have otherwise bee n possible.

The XCB system is typically used when the APC/HLAPC system has insufficient recovery. Cores collected with the XCB syste m are denoted by the letter $^\mathrm{\circ}\mathrm{X}$ .” In our case, however, the XCB syste m was not able to recover the unconsolidated sands encountered a t depths where the APC/HLAPC system could not be used. The XC B system was used to advance the hole when HLAPC refusal occurre d before the target depth was reached or when drilling conditions required it. The XCB system has a small cutting shoe that extends below the large rotary APC/XCB bit (Figure F2B). The smaller bit ca n cut a semi-indurated core with less torque and fluid circulation tha n the main bit, potentially improving recovery. The XCB cutting sho e typically extends ${\sim}30.5~\mathrm{cm}$ ahead of the main bit in soft sediment s but is allowed to retract into the main bit when hard formations ar e encountered. Shorter XCB cutting shoes can also be used. The XC B system could not recover the poorly consolidated and loose san d lithologies penetrated during Expedition 367.  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) used for APC and XCB coring is typically composed of an $11\%$ inch $({\sim}29.05\,\mathrm{cm})$ drill bit, a bi t sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landing saver sub, a modified top sub,  a modified head sub, five $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered drill collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch transition drill pipe, and  a crossover sub to the drill pipe that extends to the surface.

Figure F2 (continued). B. XCB system. C. RCB system. OD $=$ outside diameter.  

The RCB system is a rotary system designed to recover firm t o hard sediments and igneous basement. The BHA, including the bi t and outer core barrel, is rotated with the drill string while bearing s allow the inner core barrel to remain stationary (Figure F2C).  

A typical RCB BHA includes a $9\%$ inch drill bit, a bit sub, a n outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, a variable number of $8\%$ inch control length drill collars, a tapered dril l collar, two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe, and a crossover sub to th e drill pipe that extends to the surface. Cores collected with the RC B system are denoted by the letter $^{\ast}\mathbf{R}$ .”  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all APC, HLAPC, an d RCB deployments. APC cores were oriented with the Icefield MI- 5 core orientation tool when coring conditions allowed. Formatio n temperature measurements were taken with the advanced pisto n corer temperature tool (APCT-3; see Downhole measurements). Information on recovered cores, drilled intervals, downhole tool deployments, and related information are provided in the Operations, Paleomagnetism, and Downhole measurements sections of eac h site chapter.  

# IODP depth conventions  

The primary depth scales used are based on the length of th e drill string deployed (e.g., drilling depth below rig floor [DRF] an d drilling depth below seafloor [DSF]), the length of core recovere d (e.g., core depth below seafloor [CSF] and core composite depth below seafloor [CCSF]), and the length of logging wireline deploye d (e.g., wireline log depth below rig floor [WRF] and wireline log dept h below seafloor [WSF]) (see IODP Depth Scales Terminology a t http://www.iodp.org/policies-and-guidelines/142-iodp-depthscales-terminology-april-2011/file). In cases where multiple logging passes are made, wireline log depths are mapped to one reference pass, creating the wireline log matched depth below seafloo r (WMSF) scale. All units are in meters. The relationship betwee n scales is defined either by protocol, such as the rules for computatio n of CSF depth from DSF depth, or by user-defined correlations, suc h as core-to-log correlation. The distinction in nomenclature shoul d keep the reader aware that a nominal depth value in different dept h scales usually does not refer to the exact same stratigraphic interval.  

Depths of cored intervals are measured from the drill floo r based on the length of drill pipe deployed beneath the rig floo r (DRF scale; Figure F1). The depth of the cored interval is reference d to the seafloor (DSF scale) by subtracting the seafloor depth of th e hole from the DRF depth of the interval. Standard depths of cores i n meters below seafloor (CSF-A scale) are determined based on th e assumption that (1) the top depth of a recovered core correspond s to the top depth of its cored interval (at the DSF scale) and (2) th e recovered material is a contiguous section even if core segments ar e separated by voids when recovered. Standard depths of samples an d associated measurements (CSF-A scale) are calculated by addin g the offset of the sample or measurement from the top of its sectio n and the lengths of all higher sections in the core to the top depth o f the core.  

If a core has ${<}100\%$ recovery, for curation purposes all core d material is assumed to originate from the top of the drilled interva l as a continuous section. In addition, voids in the core are closed b y pushing core segments together, if possible, during core handling. Therefore, the true depth interval within the cored interval is unknown. This result should be considered a sampling uncertainty i n age-depth analysis or in correlation of core data with downhole logging data.  

When core recovery is ${>}100\%$ (the length of the recovered cor e exceeds that of the cored interval), the CSF depth of a sample o r measurement taken from the bottom of a core will be deeper tha n that of a sample or measurement taken from the top of the subsequent core (i.e., the data associated with the two core intervals overlap at the CSF-A scale). This overlap can happen when a soft t o semisoft sediment core recovered from a few hundred meters belo w the seafloor expands upon recovery (typically by a few percent to a s much as $15\%$ ). Therefore, a stratigraphic interval may not have th e same nominal depth on the DSF and CSF scales in the same hole.  

During Expeditions 367 and 368, all core depths below seafloo r were initially calculated according to the CSF-A depth scale. Unles s otherwise noted, all depths presented are calculated on the CSF- A scale and reported simply in meters (m).  

# Curatorial procedures and sample depth calculations  

Numbering of sites, holes, cores, and samples follows standar d IODP procedure. A full curatorial identifier for a sample consists o f the following information: expedition, site, hole, core number, cor e type, section number, section half, piece number (hard rocks only), and interval in centimeters measured from the top of the core section. For example, a sample identification of “367-U1499A-5H-2W, $31{-}33~\mathrm{cm}^{\prime\prime}$ indicates a $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ sample removed from the interval between 31 and $33~\mathrm{cm}$ below the top of Section 2 (working half) o f Core 5 ( $\mathrm{^{\prime}H^{\prime\prime}}$ designates that this core was taken with the APC system) of Hole A at Site U1499 during Expedition 367 (Figure F1). The “U” preceding the hole number indicates the hole was drille d by the US platform, the JOIDES Resolution. The drilling system use d to obtain a core is designated in the sample identifiers as follows:  H $=$ APC, $\textrm{F}=$ HLAPC, ${\mathrm{R}}\,=\,{\mathrm{RCB}}$ , and $\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{XCB}$ . Integers are used t o denote the “core” type of drilled intervals (e.g., a drilled interval between Cores 2H and 4H would be denoted by Core 31).  

# Core handling and analysis  

# Sediment  

When the core barrel reached the rig floor, the core catche r from the bottom of the core barrel was removed and a sample wa s extracted for paleontological (PAL) analysis. Next, the sedimen t core was extracted from the core barrel in its plastic liner. The line r was carried from the rig floor to the core processing area on the catwalk outside the core laboratory, where it was split into ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections. Blue (uphole direction) and clear (downhole direction) line r caps were glued with acetone onto the cut liner sections.  

Once the core was cut into sections, whole-round samples wer e taken for interstitial water chemical analyses. When a whole-roun d sample was removed, a yellow cap was used to denote the missin g interval. Syringe samples were taken for headspace gas analyses according to the IODP hydrocarbon safety monitoring protocol.  

Core sections were placed in a core rack in the laboratory. Whe n the core sections reached equilibrium with laboratory temperatur e (typically after $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ ), they were run through the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) for $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity on the $P$ -wave logge r (PWL), magnetic susceptibility, and gamma ray attenuation (GRA ) bulk density (see Physical properties). The core sections were als o run through the Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL), an d thermal conductivity measurements were taken once per core whe n the material was suitable.  

The core sections were then split lengthwise from bottom to to p into working and archive halves. Investigators should note tha t older material can be transported upward on the split face of eac h section during splitting.  

The working half of each core was described by the sedimentologists and structural geologists. Discrete samples were then take n for moisture and density (MAD) and paleomagnetic (PMAG) analyses and for remaining shipboard analyses such as X-ray diffractio n (XRD) and carbonate (CARB). Samples were not collected when th e lithology was a high-priority interval for expedition or postexpedition research (e.g., ash layers, etc.), there was unsuitable cor e material, or the core was severely deformed. During the expeditions, no samples were taken for personal postexpedition researc h (except for ephemeral pore water samples and five reconnaissanc e samples for lipids necessary to determine the appropriate sampl e volume/number to prepare for sensible postexpedition sampling).  

The archive half of each core was scanned on the Section Hal f Imaging Logger (SHIL) and measured for point magnetic susceptibility (MSP), and reflectance spectroscopy and colorimetry (RSC ) were measured on the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL). Labeled foam pieces were used to denote missing whole-roun d (WR) intervals in the SHIL images. The archive-half sections wer e then described visually and by means of smear slides for sedimentology. Finally, the magnetization of archive-half sections and working-half  discrete  pieces  was  measured  with  the  cryogeni c magnetometer and spinner magnetometer.  

# Hard rock  

Pieces were extracted from the core liner on the catwalk or directly from the core barrel on the rig floor. The pieces were pushe d to the bottom of $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ liner sections, and the total rock length wa s measured. The length was entered into the database using th e SampleMaster application as “created length.” This number wa s used to calculate recovery. The liner sections were then transferre d to the core splitting room.  

Oriented pieces of core were marked on the bottom with a wa x pencil to preserve orientation. Adjacent but broken pieces tha t could be fit together along fractures were curated as single pieces. The petrologists and structural geologists confirmed piece matche s and marked the split line on the pieces, which defined how th e pieces were to be cut into two equal halves. The aim was to maximize the expression of dipping structures on the cut face of the cor e while maintaining representative features in both archive and working halves. A plastic spacer was secured with acetone to the spli t core liner between individual pieces or reconstructed contiguou s groups of subpieces. These spacers can represent substantial intervals of no recovery. The length of each section of core, includin g spacers, was entered into the database as “curated length,” whic h commonly differs by several centimeters from the length measure d on the catwalk. Finally, the depth of each piece in the database wa s recalculated based on the curated length.  

Core pieces were imaged around the full $360^{\circ}$ circumference an d then placed in a core rack in the laboratory. When the core section s reached equilibrium with laboratory temperature (typically after  2 h), the whole-round core sections were run through the WRMS L (GRA and magnetic susceptibility only) and NGRL (see Physica l properties).  

Each piece of core was split with a diamond-impregnated sa w into an archive half and a working half, with the positions of plasti c spacers between pieces maintained in both halves. Pieces wer e numbered sequentially from the top of each section, beginning wit h 1. Separate subpieces within a single piece were assigned the sam e number but lettered consecutively (e.g., 1A, 1B, etc.). Pieces wer e labeled only on the outer cylindrical surfaces of the core. If it wa s evident that an individual piece had not rotated around a horizonta l axis during drilling, an arrow pointing to the top of the section wa s added to the label. The piece’s oriented character was recorded i n the database using the SampleMaster application.  

The working half of each core was first described by the petrologists and structural geologists. Samples were then taken for thi n section preparation and shipboard paleomagnetic and physica l properties analyses. The archive half of each core was scanned o n the SHIL and measured for MSP and RSC on the SHMSL. Therma l conductivity measurements were made on selected archive-hal f samples (see Physical properties). After the archive halves wer e fully described, samples were taken for shipboard analyses (thi n sections, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy [ICP], XRD, MAD, etc). Finally, the magnetizations of archive-half sections, archive-half pieces, and discrete samples taken from the working hal f were measured with the cryogenic magnetometer and spinne r magnetometer.  

When all steps were completed, cores were wrapped, sealed i n plastic tubes, and transferred to cold storage space aboard the ship. At the end of the expedition, the cores were sent to the IODP Gul f Coast Repository (Texas A&M University, College Station, Texa s [USA]), where samples for postexpedition research were taken.  

# Drilling and handling core disturbance  

Cores may be significantly disturbed and contain extraneou s material as a result of the coring and core handling process (Jutzele r et al., 2014). In formations with loose sand layers, sand from intervals higher in the hole may be washed down by drilling circulation, accumulate at the bottom of the hole, and be sampled with the nex t core. The uppermost $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ of each core must therefore be examined critically during description for potential “fall-in.” Commo n coring-induced deformation includes the concave-downward appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Piston action can resul t in fluidization (“flow-in”) at the bottom of APC cores. Retrieva l from depth to the surface can result in elastic rebound. Gas that is i n solution at depth may become free and drive apart core segment s within the liner. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cut into segments. Holes are drilled into the liner, which forces some sediment as wel l as gas out of the liner. These disturbances are described in each sit e chapter and graphically indicated on the visual core description s (VCDs).

# Lithostratigraphy  

The lithologies of sediment and sedimentary rocks recovere d during Expeditions 367 and 368 were determined using visual (macroscopic) core description, smear slides, and thin sections. Integration  of  data  from  digital  core  images,  color  reflectanc e spectrophotometry, magnetic susceptibility, XRD, and geochemistry provided complementary information. The methods employe d during the expeditions were adapted from those used during IOD P Expedition 349 (Li et al., 2015), along with those from other IOD P expeditions (e.g., Expedition 339 Scientists, 2013). We used th e DESClogik application to record and upload descriptive data int o the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) databas e (see the DESClogik user guide at http://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation). Spreadsheet templates were set up in DESClogik an d customized for Expeditions 367 and 368 before the first core wa s brought on deck. The templates were used to record macroscopi c core descriptions and microscopic data from smear slides and thi n sections. The location of all smear slide and thin section sample s taken from the core were recorded in the SampleMaster application, and descriptive data uploaded to the LIMS database were use d to produce VCD standard graphic reports.  

# Core preparation  

Standard methods for splitting core were performed either b y pulling a wire lengthwise through the center of the core or by cutting the core with a rock saw. Each piece of core was split into archive and working halves, with the archive half used for visua l description. When splitting the cores with a wire, we sometime s gently scraped across the cut surface of the core section using  a stainless steel or glass scraper to prepare the surface for unobscure d description and digital imaging, especially in the upper, poorly consolidated intervals. Most cores were imaged after they had dried; however, some cores were imaged still damp from the water use d during  cutting if this enhanced the features. If these cores had partially dried before they were imaged, we applied a light spray of deionized water to dampen the surface.  

# Visual core description  

VCDs include a simplified graphical representation of each sit e on a core-by-core basis (Figure F3). The principal function of th e graphic VCD is to present the physical observations of the core in  a columnar format. Site, hole, core, and depth in meters CSF-A ar e given at the top of each VCD, with the depth and core section numbers plotted along the left margin. Next to the depth and sectio n columns, we plotted the lithostratigraphic unit and the biostratigraphic age (see Biostratigraphy). The lithostratigraphic units wer e assigned by grouping intervals based on their lithologic similaritie s (see Definition of lithostratigraphic units). Further definition o f the lithostratigraphic units and their boundaries is described i n each site chapter. Additional columns correspond to either core images, physical properties (e.g., natural gamma radiation [NGR]), entries made in DESClogik, or shipboard sample locations. Data take n from DESClogik entries include core summary, principal lithology, sedimentary structures, bioturbation intensity, and drilling disturbances. The VCDs also include descriptive and lithostratigraphi c information from the metamorphic and igneous rocks recovered a t each site. Each VCD column is described in more detail below.  

# Core summary  

The core summary provides a brief overview of major and minor lithologies present in the core, as well as notable features (e.g., sedimentary structures). The summary is presented at the top of th e VCDs and includes sediment color determined qualitatively usin g Munsell soil color charts. Because sediment color may evolv e during drying and subsequent oxidization, color was describe d shortly after the cores were split and imaged or measured by th e SHIL and SHMSL. Deionized water was applied to the cut surfac e of lithified sedimentary rocks before determining color.  

# Core images  

High-resolution color images were produced by scanning th e flat surface of the archive-half sections with the SHIL. The core s were scanned as soon as possible after splitting and scraping t o avoid color changes caused by sediment oxidation and drying. I n some cases involving lithified rock, we photographed the cores bot h wet and dry and selected the image that best represented the lithology.  

The SHIL uses three pairs of advanced illumination, high-current-focused, LED line lights to illuminate large cracks and blocks i n the core surface and sidewalls. Each LED pair has a color temperature of $6500~\mathrm{K}$ and emits 90,000 lx at $76.2~\mathrm{mm}$ . A line-scan camer a images 10 lines/mm to create a high-resolution TIFF file. The camera height is adjusted so that each pixel images a $0.1\;\mathrm{mm^{2}}$ section o f the core. However, actual core width per pixel varies because of differences in section-half surface height. High- and low-resolutio n JPEG files are subsequently created from the high-resolution TIF F file. Two different image types were uploaded to the LIMS database: one that includes a grayscale and ruler and one that is cropped t o exclude the grayscale and ruler.  

# Graphic lithology  

The graphic lithology column illustrates an interval-by-interva l record of the primary lithologies contained within each core. Th e column was constructed by pairing the principal lithology name assigned to each interval in DESClogik with a predetermined set o f lithology patterns (Figure F4). The column plots to scale all intervals that are at least $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick. Principal lithology names were no t assigned to intervals thinner than $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ unless they were of special significance (e.g., ash layers).  

# Reflectance  

Reflectance of visible light from the archive halves of sedimen t cores was measured using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer mounted on the automated SHMSL. Freshly split cores wer e covered with clear plastic wrap and placed on the SHMSL, and measurements were taken at 1, 2, or $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ spacing to provide a highresolution stratigraphic record of color variation for visible wavelengths. Each measurement was recorded in $2\,\textrm{n m}$ wide spectral bands from 400 to $900\ \mathrm{nm}$ . Reflectance parameters $\mathrm{\Delta}\mathrm{L}^{\ast},\mathrm{\Delta}\mathrm{a}^{\ast}$ , and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ were recorded (Balsam et al., 1997, 1998).  

The SHMSL takes measurements in empty intervals and ove r intervals where the core surface is well below the level of the cor e liner, but it cannot recognize relatively small cracks, disturbed area s of core, or plastic section dividers. Thus, SHMSL data may contai n spurious measurements that must be edited out of the data set b y the user. When significant fragmentation and/or brecciation fro m drilling disturbances was evident, the SHMSL spacing was adjuste d manually to avoid taking measurements in the wide spaces cause d by drilling fractures. Additional detailed information about measurement and interpretation of reflectance data can be found in Balsam et al. (1997, 1998) and Balsam and Damuth (2000).  

# Natural gamma radiation  

NGR occurs primarily by decay of $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ isotopes . This radiation is measured using the NGRL (see Physical properties). Data generated from this instrument were used to augmen t geologic interpretations.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

We measured magnetic susceptibility with a Bartington Instruments MS2E point sensor (high-resolution surface-scanning sensor) on the SHMSL. Because the SHMSL demands direct contac t between the point magnetic susceptibility sensor and the split core, measurements were made on the archive halves of split cores tha t were covered with clear plastic wrap. Measurements were taken a t 1.0, 2.0, or $2.5\;\mathrm{cm}$ spacing. Measurement resolution was 1.0 SI, an d each measurement integrated a volume of $10.5\ \mathrm{mm}\times\,3.8\ \mathrm{mm}\times\,4$ mm, where $10.5\,\mathrm{mm}$ is the length perpendicular to the core axis, 3. 8 mm is the width along the core axis, and $4\,\mathrm{mm}$ is the depth into th e core.  

# Sedimentary structures  

The location and type of stratification and sedimentary structures visible on the surface of the split cores are shown in the sedimentary structures column of the VCDs. Symbols in this colum n indicate the location, scale, and frequency of stratification and othe r sedimentary features, such as sole marks, cross-lamination, and fining-upward intervals (Figure F5).

Figure F3. Example graphic visual description form (VCD), Expeditions 367 and 368. cps $=$ counts per second.  

For Expeditions 367 and 368, the following terminology (base d on Stow, 2005) was used to describe the scale of stratification:  

Thin lamination $=<\!0.3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Medium lamination $=0.3–0.6\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thick lamination $=0.6–1\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Very thin bed $=1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thin b $\d{\beth}\,\!\!\mathrm{d}=3\!\!-\!\!10\,\dag\!\!\mathrm{m}$ thick.   
Medium bed $!=10–30\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Thick bed $=30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick.   
Very thick be $\mathrm{{d}}=>\!100\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ thick.  

# Bioturbation intensity  

Five levels of bioturbation are recognized using a scheme lik e that of Droser and Bottjer (1986). These levels are illustrated with  a numeric scale in the bioturbation intensity column. Any identifiabl e trace fossils (ichnofossils) are identified in the general interval comment field in DESClogik and in the core summary.  

$1=\mathrm{No}$ bioturbation.   
$2=$ Slight bioturbation $(<\!10\%{-}30\%)$ .   
$3=$ Moderate bioturbation $(30\%{-}60\%)$ ).   
$4=$ Heavy bioturbation $(60\%{-}90\%)$ .   
$5=$ Complete bioturbation $(\mathrm{>}90\%)$ .  

# Drilling disturbance  

Drilling-related sediment disturbance is recorded in the disturbance type and intensity columns. The disturbance intensity, wher e present, is ranked on a five-point scale: slight, slight to moderate, moderate, moderate to high, and high. The type of drilling disturbance is classified using the symbols shown in Figure F5. Each symbol corresponds to the following terms:

• Soupy: intervals are water-saturated and have lost all aspects of original bedding.   
• Fall-in: characteristically occurs at the top of individual cores when out-of-place material from the shallower cored interval has fallen downhole onto the cored surface.   
• Up-arching: bedding planes are slightly to moderately deformed but still subhorizontal and continuous across the core surface. The edges of the bedding planes typically show a concave downward shape caused by shear along the wall of the core liner.   
• Flow-in: occurs in unconsolidated, sandy, or gravelly sediment, leaving a soupy texture at the base of the core. It typically occurs during APC drilling, following a partial stroke of the piston core.   
• Biscuit: sediments of intermediate stiffness show vertical variations in the degree of disturbance. Softer intervals are washed and/or soupy, whereas firmer intervals are relatively undisturbed.   
• Fractured: common in consolidated and lithified sediments. The core pieces are broken in places and may have been partly displaced or moved, but the correct stratigraphic sequence is maintained.   
• Fragmented: complete fracturing of the core into large $(>\!2\,\mathsf{c m}$ thick) pieces, where the stratigraphic order of the pieces is retained but their orientation is lost.   
• Drilling breccia: core is crushed and broken into many small and angular pieces, with original orientation and stratigraphic position lost.

The shipboard samples column records the position of sample s used for microscopic descriptions (i.e., smear slides and thin sections), biochronological determinations, and shipboard analyses o f chemical and physical properties.  

# Classification of principal lithology  

# Types of sediment  

The sediment recovered during Expeditions 367 and 368 wa s described and classified by measuring the relative proportions o f biosiliceous, calcareous, and siliciclastic material (Figure F6). Thi s

classification scheme was adapted from Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Expedition 339 (Expedition 339 Scientists, 2013), Expedition 349 (Li et al., 2015) and Stow (2005). Biosiliceous sediment i s restricted to only include siliceous skeletal remains of microorganisms (e.g., radiolarians and diatoms), whereas calcareous sedimen t includes a wide range of grain types, such as the skeletal remains o f microfauna (e.g., foraminifers) and microflora (e.g., nannofossils), macrofossil shell fragments, and fine-grained detrital carbonate. Siliciclastic sediment includes mineral and rock fragments erode d from igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. In rare cases, sediment recovered during Expeditions 367 and 368 included grain s that were directly derived from a volcanic eruption, mainly in th e form of vitric material (e.g., ash and lapilli), so a separate classification scheme was applied to their description.  

Naming conventions for Expeditions 367 and 368 follow th e general guidelines of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sedimen t classification scheme (Mazzullo et al., 1988), except that during Expeditions 367 and 368 a separate “mixed sediment” category wa s not distinguished and detrital biogenic sediment with evidence o f being reworked and transported by sedimentary processes was described using the terminology for siliciclastic rocks with a prefi x that describes the main biogenic component. For example, the ter m “foraminifer sand” defines sediment composed of ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ foraminife r tests that are ${>}63~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ in size. A principal lithology name is assigne d to each interval, and when the sediment comprises a mixture of different sediment types, modifying prefixes and suffixes are added t o the principal name.  

We followed the naming scheme of Shepard (1954) for the classification of siliciclastic sediment and sedimentary rock that reflect s the relative proportion of sediments of different grain size (Figur e F7). Sediment grain size divisions for siliciclastic and redeposite d biogenic components are based on Wentworth (1922), with categories based on the relative proportions of gravel and sand-, silt-, an d clay-sized particles (Figure F8). Distinguishing between some o f these categories can be difficult at the macroscopic level, especiall y

considering the relative abundance of the fine-grained fraction (e.g., silty clay versus clayey silt); therefore, smear slides and thin section s were used in classifying fine-grained sediment abundances.  

The proportions of biogenic material, both siliceous and calcareous sediment, were first macroscopically determined by observin g changes in color. We used Munsell soil color charts to assign a colo r to different intervals within a core. Sediments that contained significant amounts of calcareous material typically had a lighter colo r value. Biogenic material was also determined by observing physica l property changes in NGR, magnetic susceptibility, and reflectanc e values. Low magnetic susceptibility and high color reflectance values were two defining patterns associated with significant amount s of calcareous material. We then used smear slides and thin section s to identify and estimate the relative abundance of the differen t microfossils, such as nannofossils, foraminifers, and radiolarians, within unique lithologic intervals. However, smear slide observations tend to overestimate the relative proportions of calcareous microorganisms with respect to the clay-sized fraction of siliciclasti c material, so we used the shipboard calcium carbonate data as  a quality control. Sediment with ${>}40\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ calcium carbonate was classified using a calcareous principal lithology.  

The lithologic names assigned to a given interval of sedimen t consist of a principal name and in some cases a modifying prefi x and/or suffix. The assigned names are based on abundance an d composition of grains determined from visual description of th e core and from smear slide/thin section observations. For sedimen t that contains ${>}90\%$ of one component (either the siliciclastic or biogenic component), only the principal name was used. For sedimen t that contains ${>}90\%$ biogenic components and is not clearly reworked, the name applied indicates the most common type of biogenic grain. For example, sediment composed of ${>}90\%$ calcareou s nannofossils was named nannofossil ooze, and sediment compose d of subequal amounts of foraminifers and nannofossils was name d calcareous ooze.  

For sediment with ${>}90\%$ siliciclastic grains, the principal name i s based on the textural characteristics of siliciclastic sediment particles (Figure F7). For sediment that contains a significant mixture o f siliciclastic and biogenic components (between $10\%$ and $90\%$ o f both siliciclastic and biogenic components), the principal name i s determined by the more abundant component. If the siliciclasti c component is more abundant, the principal name is based on th e textural characteristics of siliciclastic fraction. If the biogenic component is more abundant, the principal name is based on the predominant microfossil group.  

If a microfossil group composes $10\%{-}50\%$ of the sediment an d this group is not included as part of the principal name, modifier s are used instead. When a microfossil group (e.g., diatom, nannofossil, or foraminifer) comprises $20\%{-}50\%$ of the sediment, a majo r modifier consisting of the component name hyphenated with th e suffix “-rich” (e.g., nannofossil-rich clay) is used. When the calcareous or biosiliceous material comprises a mixture of different microfossil  grain  types,  the  major  modifier  “calcareous-rich”  o r “biosiliceous-rich” is used instead.  

If the principal component forms $80\%{-}90\%$ of the sediment, th e principal name is followed by a minor modifier (e.g., “with nannofossils”), with the minor modifier based on the most abundant component  that  forms $10\%{-}20\%$ of  the  sediment.  If  the  mino r component is biogenic,  the modifier describes the most limite d group of grains that exceeds the $10\%$ abundance threshold. If th e minor component is siliciclastic, the minor modifier is based on th e texture of the siliciclastic fraction.  

If the primary lithology for an interval of core has a major modifier,  that major modifier is indicated in the Graphic lithology column of the VCDs using a modified version of the lithologic patter n for the primary lithology (Figure F3). The modified lithologic patterns are shown in Figure F4. The minor modifiers of sedimen t lithologies are not included in the graphic lithology column. Although size-texture qualifiers were used to describe siliciclastic sediment  (using  prefixes  such  as  clayey  or  sandy),  size-textur e qualifiers were not typically used in the principal name for biogeni c sediment.  

# Lithification  

The degree of lithification was determined by observing th e amount of deformation the sediment can accommodate and th e level of sediment consolidation. Sediment was considered lithifie d when the sediment could not be deformed easily with a finger, toothpick, or metal scraper. Lithification was ranked using a qualitative scale with the terms slightly consolidated, moderately consolidated, well consolidated, and lithified.  

Depending on the principal lithology, different lithificatio n terms were used. For example, the name “ooze” was applied to unlithified biogenic sediment predominantly composed of calcareou s or siliceous microorganisms (e.g., nannofossil ooze). The ter m “ooze” indicates that the sediment can be deformed by a finger. Chalk is the lithified variant of calcareous ooze that is fine graine d and more compact although it can be scratched by a fingernail. Lithified sediment composed of siliceous microfossils (diatoms an d radiolarians) is called “radiolarite/diatomite.” Well-lithified calcareous sediment that contains evidence of shallow water depositio n (e.g., skeletal macrofossils such as coral) was called “limestone” wit h supporting prefixes such as “bioclast-rich,” “clast-supported,” an d “dolomitic.”  

For unlithified siliciclastic sediment, no lithification term wa s added, and the sediment was named for the dominant grain siz e (i.e., gravel, sand, silt, or clay). For more lithified siliciclastic material, the suffix “-stone” was appended to the dominant size classification (e.g., claystone), except for sediment of gravel size where th e terms “conglomerate” or “breccia” were used for well-rounded an d angular clasts, respectively. The principal names “conglomerate ” and “breccia” were modified using the terms “matrix-supported ” and “clast-supported,” depending on the matrix to clast ratio.  

When the mineralogical, chemical, or structural compositions of the sediments or sedimentary rocks have been altered or change d from their original form, the prefix “meta” is used in conjunctio n with principal lithology (e.g., metasandstone). These rocks are described under the Metamorphic tab in DESClogik. In many cases, however, no clear distinction of boundary between well-lithifie d sediments and metasedimentary rock exists. Furthermore, extensive alteration by veins, fractures, and other structural features requires special treatment, particularly when a sedimentary rock i s crosscut by a mesh network of veins. For this reason, the nam e “breccia” is applied in several different ways (see Igneous and metamorphic petrology).  

# Ash layers (volcaniclastic sediment)  

The classification of volcanic sediments followed here differ s from the standard ODP and IODP classification (Mazzullo et al., 1988) in that we adopted a descriptive (nongenetic) terminolog y like that employed during ODP Leg 197 and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 324 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002; Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010). Unless an unequivocally pyroclasti c origin for volcanogenic particles could be determined, we simpl y described these deposits as we did for siliciclastic sediment (i.e., sand, silt, etc.).  

Where evidence for a pyroclastic origin is compelling and th e sediment has ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ vitric and other primary volcanic material, w e adopted the classification scheme of Fisher and Schmincke (1984). In these instances, we used the grain size terms “volcanic block o r bomb” $\langle{>}64\,\mathrm{mm}\rangle$ ), “lapilli” $(2{-}64\,\mathrm{mm})$ , and “ash” ( $<\!2\,\mathrm{mm}\rangle$ ) for unconsolidated sediment and “volcanic breccia” $:564~\mathrm{mm}\rangle$ , “lapillistone ” $(2{-}64\,\mathrm{mm})$ , and “tuff” $,<2\;\mathrm{mm})$ for lithified material. When the volcanic particles compose between $25\%$ and $50\%$ of the sediment fraction, the modifier “tuffaceous” was used as the prefix for th e siliciclastic sediment (e.g., tuffaceous sandstone). The term “hyaloclastite” is used for vitroclastic (i.e., glassy) materials produced b y the interaction of water and hot magma or lava.  

# Smear slide and thin section observation  

Two or more smear slide samples of the main lithologies wer e typically collected from the archive half of each core. Additiona l samples were collected from areas of interest (e.g., laminations, as h layers, and nodules). A small amount of sediment was taken with  a wooden toothpick and put on a $2.5\,\mathrm{cm}\times7.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ glass slide. The sediment sample was homogenized with a drop of deionized water an d evenly spread across the slide to create a very thin (about $<50\ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ uniform layer of sediment grains for quantification. The disperse d sample was dried on a hot plate. A drop of Norland optical adhesiv e was added as a mounting medium to a coverslip, which was carefully placed on the dried sample to prevent air bubbles from bein g trapped in the adhesive. The smear slide was then cured in an ultraviolet light box.  

Thin sections were prepared by cutting $3{-}5~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ billets of lithified sediment from the working half of the core. In some cases, th e cut billet was impregnated with a clear epoxy to further consolidat e the grains. They were then mounted on $2.5\:\mathrm{cm}\times4.5\:\mathrm{cm}$ glass slide s and ground down to a thickness of ${\sim}30\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ .  

Smear slides and thin sections were examined with a transmitted-light petrographic microscope equipped with a standard eyepiece  micrometer.  The  texture  of  siliciclastic  grains  (relativ e abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains) and the proportion s and presence of biogenic and mineral components observed in thi n sections or smear slides were recorded in DESClogik. Biogenic an d mineral components were identified using IODP Technical Notes  1 and 2 (Marsaglia et al., 2013, 2015) for smear slides, and their percentage abundances were visually estimated using Rothwell (1989). The mineralogy of clay-sized grains could not be determined fro m smear slides. Note that smear slide analyses tend to underestimat e the amount of sand-sized and larger grains because these grains ar e difficult to incorporate onto the slide.  

Relative abundances of identified components such as minera l grains, microfossils, and biogenic fragments were assigned on  a semiquantitative basis using the following abbreviations:  

$\mathrm{Tr}=$ trace ( $1\%$ in field of view [FOV]).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $.1\%{-5\%}$ in FOV).   
$C=$ common $(>\!5\%{-}25\%$ in FOV).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!25\%{-}75\%$ in FOV).   
$\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant $"75\%$ in FOV).  

# X-ray diffraction analysis  

Samples for XRD analyses were selected from the working half, generally at the same depth as sampling for solid-phase geochemistry and smear slide analyses. Approximately one $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sample wa s taken of a representative lithology per core. Samples analyzed fo r bulk mineralogy were freeze-dried and homogenized by grinding i n the metal ball mill. Prepared samples were top-mounted onto  a sample holder and analyzed using a Bruker D-4 Endeavor diffractometer mounted with a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtere d CuKα radiation. Settings for the standard locked coupled scan were as follows:  

Voltage $=37\;\mathrm{kV}.$ .   
Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ .   
Goniometer $\mathrm{scan}=4^{\circ}–70^{\circ}$ .   
Step $\mathrm{size}=0.0166^{\circ}$ .   
Scan speed $=1\;{\bf s}/$ step.   
Divergence slit $=0.3\;\mathrm{mm}$ .  

Diffractograms of bulk samples were evaluated with the aid o f the Jade6 or EVA software package, which allowed for mineral identification and basic peak characterization (e.g., baseline removal and characteristic peak intensity). Files were created that containe d d-spacing values, diffraction angles, and peak intensities with an d without the background removed. These files were scanned by th e Jade6 or EVA software to find d-spacing values characteristic of  a limited range of minerals. Peak areas were further quantitatively estimated by the TOPAS software. Shipboard evaluation yielde d semiquantitative results of the presence and relative abundances o f the most common mineralogical components by applying correction factors (Cook et al., 1975) to the measured intensity of the characteristic reflections of minerals.  

# Definition of lithostratigraphic units  

Sediments and sedimentary rocks were described at two levels : (1) the descriptive interval (a single descriptive line in DESClogik ) and (2) the lithostratigraphic unit. Lithostratigraphic units are defined as assemblages of multiple descriptive intervals containin g similar principal lithologies that are typically tens to hundreds o f meters thick (e.g., Tamura et al., 2015). Lithostratigraphic unit s should be clearly distinguishable from each other by several characteristics, such as composition, bed thickness, grain-size class, an d internal homogeneity. Following IODP tradition, they are numbered sequentially as Unit I, Unit II, and so on from the top of th e core to the bottom. Subunits were defined within units that showe d distinct changes in minor lithology types or bed forms but maintained continuity in the principal lithology. For instance, a unit primarily composed of clay and interbedded silt would be divided int o two subunits if the interbedded lithology changed to sand and silt i n the lower half of the unit’s interval. Note that this distinction wa s interpreted differently during Expeditions 367 and 368, so a greate r number of subunits were defined during Expedition 367 tha n during Expedition 368.  

# Igneous and metamorphic petrology  

Expedition 367 and 368 core description procedures for igneou s and metamorphic rocks are based on those from IODP Expedition s 349 and 351 (Li et al., 2015; Arculus et al., 2015) and ODP Legs 20 9 and 210 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004a, 2004b).  

# Core description workflow  

Prior to splitting the core into working and archive halves, eac h core was subjected to nondestructive physical property measurements (see Physical properties) and imaged using the SHIL (se e  

Lithostratigraphy) on a wet outside surface at four different angle s (0°, $90^{\circ}$ , $180^{\circ}$ , and $270^{\circ}$ ) that were combined to form a $360^{\circ}$ wholeround image. The coherent hard rock sections and/or hard roc k pieces were then split by a diamond-impregnated saw along line s drawn by a petrologist and/or a structural geologist in order to preserve significant compositional and structural features in both th e archive and working halves. Afterward, fragmented pieces of har d rock that fit together were assigned a joint number and labeled wit h a letter in consecutive order downsection (e.g., 1A, 1B, 1C). Plasti c spacers separate pieces with different numbers. An arrow added t o the labels of single pieces that showed no evidence of rotation indicates the orientation by pointing to the top of the section. Scannin g of the cut, dry archive-half surfaces by the SHIL produced high-resolution color images. Then the archive halves were analyzed fo r color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility at $1{-}2.5\ \mathrm{cm}$ increments by deploying the SHMSL (see Lithostratigraphy). Shipboar d samples were taken from working halves for carrying out destructive physical properties and paleomagnetic measurements, as wel l as thin section, XRD, and inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis. Because of the presence o f hyaloclastic lava-sediment mixtures and sedimentary veins, working halves of igneous rock cores were also sampled for paleontological and sedimentary studies.  

Initial macroscopic examination of each core section focused o n petrologic and alteration features, followed by characterization o f structures (see Structural geology). Subsequently, the texture an d composition of any veins were recorded. Apart from thin sections, all descriptions were made on the archive half of each core. Th e DESClogik software was used to record the macroscopic and microscopic observations of primary (igneous) and secondary (alteration/metamorphic)  characteristics,  forming  the  basis  of  al l descriptions. The use of a hand lens and binocular microscop e aided the estimation of mineral modes and sizes.  

# Macroscopic visual core description  

VCDs present and summarize macroscopic features observed i n the cores. Expedition 349 VCDs were used as the basis for macroscopic descriptions for this study so they would remain as closel y comparable as possible. The slightly modified VCDs display the following entries (from left to right) in terms of igneous, alteration, and metamorphic features for each core section (Figure F9; see Figure F10 for VCD legend):  

• CSF-A depth scale (meters below seafloor);   
• Core length scale from 0 to $150\;\mathrm{cm}$ ;   
• Number and orientation of hard rock pieces;   
• Interval of shipboard samples;   
• Scanned digital image of the archive half;   
• Graphic representation of lithology;   
• Symbol ${}^{\ast}\mathbf{G}^{\prime\prime}$ (for igneous rocks, next to the graphic lithology), which indicates the presence of volcanic glass either in the glassy rind of chilled margins or in hyaloclastite, if encountered; thin horizontal lines in the graphic lithology constrain the section interval containing the volcanic glass and mark the location of chilled margins/contacts;   
• Igneous or metamorphic lithologic unit number;   
• Vein texture, type, and connectivity;   
• Line chart displaying vesicularity percentage;   
• Stacked line chart displaying percent phenocryst abundance for plagioclase (PLAG; red line), olivine (OL; green line), and clinopyroxene (CPX; blue line), if present;

# Igneous and metamorphic lithologic units and lithostratigraphic units  

A hard rock lithologic unit is defined by rock type or the similarity of phenocryst/mineral assemblages within each rock type.  

Boundaries are defined by major changes in rock type, in phenocryst/mineral assemblages, or in the presence of a significant thickness  of  intervening  sedimentary  rocks.  All  igneous  an d metamorphic lithologic units are given consecutive downhole Ara

bic numerals (e.g., igneous or metamorphic lithologic Units 1, 2, 3, etc.).  

To aid description of igneous and metamorphic units, it is ofte n convenient to divide them into subunits that are named igneous o r metamorphic lithologic Subunits 1a, 1b, 1c, and so on. For igneou s sequences, lithologic subunits are typically used in cases where  a given lithologic unit changed deposition type (e.g., massive flow s changed to pillow lavas or basaltic breccia and brecciated basal t changed to massive flows). For metamorphic rocks, lithologic subunits are used when different lithologies occur intercalated with th e main rock type that defines the lithologic unit, (e.g., appearance o f calc-silicate schists and marble within a unit of chlorite-epidot e schists). Closely intercalated intervals may be grouped as subunit s to avoid repetitive entry at the small-scale level. Because of the diversity of basement rock types encountered during Expeditions 36 7 and 368 (fresh basalt lavas, highly altered basalt lavas, and metamorphic schists), different criteria had to be developed by the shipboard scientists to define lithologic subunits at each site. Thes e criteria are described in detail in the relevant site chapters.  

Lithostratigraphic units (as used in Lithostratigraphy) are defined for (1) igneous rocks in which successions of consecutive cooling or depositional units with similar volcanic characteristics coul d be identified based on modal compositions and matrix fabric an d (2) metamorphic rocks in which successions of similar metamorphic conditions and fabric could be determined. For Expedition s 367 and 368, the lithostratigraphic units are equivalent to the igneous and metamorphic lithologic units described above. These successions are given consecutive downhole Roman numerals (e.g., lithostratigraphic Units III, IV, and V) that follow directly from th e overlying sedimentary units (lithostratigraphic Units I and II, in thi s example).  

# Magmatic rock classification  

Igneous rocks were classified on the basis of abundance, grai n size, and texture of their primary minerals based on the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) system (Le Maitre et al.,  

2005). This approach also applies to igneous clasts found in sedimentary lithostratigraphic units.  

# Grain size classification  

The classification of Neuendorf et al. (2005) was used for grai n size division:  

• Coarse-grained (crystal diameters $=5$ to ${\le}30\;\mathrm{mm}\mathrm{,}$ ), • Medium-grained (crystal diameters $=1$ to $<\!5\;\mathrm{mm}$ ), and • Fine-grained (crystal diameters $=0.2$ to ${<}1\;\mathrm{mm}$ ).  

# Grain size distribution  

Terms used to describe the grain size distribution are bimoda l (two dominant mineral sizes), equigranular (principal minerals ar e in the same size range), inequigranular (principal minerals have different grain sizes), and seriate (continuous range in grain size).  

# Texture  

Textures (microstructures) were described macroscopically fo r all igneous rock core sections and microscopically for a subset of intervals having thin sections.  

Textural descriptors applied to volcanic rocks are aphyric, holocrystalline, hypocrystalline (comprising both crystals [major component] and glass), hypohyaline (comprising both crystals [mino r component] and glass), holohyaline (vitric; only glass), poikiliti c (larger crystals enclose smaller grains), ophitic (pyroxene enclose s plagioclase  laths),  subophitic (pyroxene partially  encloses plagioclase laths), porphyritic, phaneritic, aphanitic, trachytic, flo w banding, perlite (rounded hydration fractures in glass), glomeroporphyritic (clusters of phenocrysts), “chilled” margin (a glassy o r micro to cryptocrystalline margin), and layered.  

# Mineral shape and habit  

Descriptions of mineral habits were based on Leg 209 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004a). The terms euhedral, subhedral, anhedral, and interstitial were used to describe the shapes of crystal s interpreted to preserve their igneous morphology. The aspect rati o of the grains was used to describe the euhedral to subhedral habit of a crystal. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the short to the long dimension of the crystal:  

• Equant: aspect ratio $=$ less than 1:2, • Subequant: aspect ratio $=1:2$ to 1:3, • Tabular: aspect ratio $=1{:}3$ to 1:5, and • Elongate: aspect ratio $=$ more than 1:5.  

The description of habits for plagioclase and clinopyroxene groundmass crystals was adapted from ODP Legs 148 and 206 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1993, 2003):  

• Cryptocrystalline aggregates of fibrous crystals (fibrous), • Comb-shaped or sheaf-like plumose crystals (fibrous), • Granular-acicular subhedral to anhedral crystals, and • Prismatic-stubby euhedral to subhedral crystals.  

# Primary lithology names of volcanic (extrusive and hypabyssal) rocks  

Units and subunits were classified on the basis of groundmass texture and primary modal composition. The combined color and texture of the groundmass and the major phenocryst(s) found in hand specimens were used to give a principal lithology name to a given igneous lithologic unit. Three rock categories were defined according to Expedition 351 (Arculus et al., 2015):  

• Basalt: a black to dark gray rock with a microcrystalline to cryptocrystalline groundmass that contains plagioclase and pyroxene and/or olivine,   
• Andesite: a dark to light gray rock with a microcrystalline groundmass that contains pyroxenes and/or feldspar and/or amphibole but is typically devoid of olivine and quartz, and   
• Rhyolite/dacite: a light gray to pale white rock with glassy to cryptocrystalline groundmass that is usually plagioclase to potassium feldspar phyric and sometimes contains quartz $\pm$ biotite.  

A prefix was applied as a modifier to the primary lithology names to indicate the abundance of phenocrysts:  

• Aphyric $(1\%$ phenocrysts), • Sparsely phyric $(1\%-5\%$ phenocrysts), • Moderately phyric $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ phenocrysts), and • Highly phyric ${}^{>}10\%$ phenocrysts).  

Moreover, the most abundant phenocryst phase was used as a mineralogical modifier for the primary lithology name of porphyritic rocks, whereas aphyric rocks were not assigned any mineralogical modifier. If present in a given sample, multiple phenocryst minerals were used as modifiers appearing in the order of increasing abundance. For example, in plagioclase-olivine phyric basalt, olivine is the more abundant phenocryst mineral.  

Other volcanic rock types distinguished are fragmented rocks made up of either (1) lithic clasts associated with basaltic lava flows (basaltic breccias are defined as matrix-supported breccias with basalt clasts, whereas brecciated basalts are clast supported) or (2) hyaloclastites defined as glass-rich volcanic rocks formed by lava–water/sediment interaction where the lava is shattered into small angular glassy fragments that may be suspended in any sediment present. Breccias not related to flows are described in the Sedimentary tab in DESClogik (see DESC_WKB in Supplementary material). Large $(>\!2\;\mathrm{cm})$ volcanic clasts in sediments and sedimentary rocks were classified in the Volcanic tab in DESClogik.  

# Groundmass  

For the textural description of the groundmass of volcanic rocks, we used terms and definitions modified from Expedition 349 (Li et al., 2015). The groundmass of extrusive lithologies was defined as the finer grained matrix enclosing phenocrysts.  

For grain size descriptions of the groundmass, we used the following terms:  

$\mathbf{G}=$ glassy.   
$\mathbf{cx}=$ cryptocrystalline $(<\!0.1\;\mathrm{mm})$ .   
$\upmu\mathrm{x}=$ microcrystalline $(0.1{-}0.2\;\mathrm{mm})$ ).   
fg $=$ fine grained $(>\!0.2–1\,\mathrm{mm})$ .  

The  following  nomenclature  was  applied  to  describe  the groundmass, predominantly at the microscopic level (MacKenzie et al., 1982; Neuendorf et al., 2005):  

• Aphanitic (crystalline but individual grains not discernable with a hand lens),   
• Equigranular (similar crystal sizes),   
• Glomeroporphyritic (containing clusters of phenocrysts),   
• Felty (tightly irregularly interwoven feldspar microlites),   
• Holohyaline ( $100\%$ glass),   
• Holocrystalline $100\%$ crystals),   
• Hypohyaline (glass is a major component, and crystals are a minor component),   
• Inequigranular (different crystal sizes),   
• Intergranular (plagioclase crystals surrounded by interstitial granular pyroxene, olivine, and/or oxide minerals),   
• Intersertal (plagioclase laths surrounded by interstitial glass or cryptocrystalline material),   
• Interstitial (glass, crypto-, or microcrystalline material between coarser grained crystals),   
• Ophitic (total inclusion of plagioclase in clinopyroxene),   
• Porphyritic (increasing presence of phenocrysts),   
• Seriate (continuous range in grain size),   
• Spherulitic (fan-like arrangement of divergent microlites),   
• Subophitic (partial inclusion of plagioclase in clinopyroxene), and   
• Vitrophyric (phenocrysts in a glassy groundmass).  

Flow textures are defined below.  

Glass groundmass was recorded in terms of the percentage of fresh material:  

• Fresh glass (amber in transmitted plane-polarized light and isotropic in transmitted cross-polarized light [XPL]), • Dark glass (darkness is caused by abundant crystallites; interstitial volcanic glass of basaltic composition is termed tachylite), • Glass with spherulites (spheroid aggregates of acicular crystals forming a nucleus), and • Altered glass (partially or completely altered to clay minerals).  

# Vesicularity  

Vesicularity is characterized by the abundance of vesicles:  

Nonvesicular $=-1\%$ vesicles.   
Sparsely vesicular $=1\%{-}5\%$ vesicles.   
Moderately vesicular $=>\!5\%{-}20\%$ vesicles.   
Highly vesicular $=>\!20\%$ vesicles.  

The description of the size, shape, and roundness of vesicles is based on the classification charts from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 330 and Expedition 349 (Expedition 330 Scien  

Figure F11. Comparison chart for describing vesicle sphericity and roundness in volcanic rocks, Expeditions 367 and 368. After Expedition 330 Scientists (2012) and Li et al. (2015), modified from Wentworth (1922).

tists, 2012; Li et al., 2015), modified from Wentworth (1922) (Figur e F11). An estimate of the percentage abundance of vesicles is included in the VCDs (Figure F9).  

# Lava flow types  

The suffix of the principal lithology name indicates the nature o f the volcanic body. We applied the classification scheme used for Expedition 349 (Li et al., 2015), which includes the following types:  

• Pillow lava flows: $0.1{-}1\;\mathrm{m}$ in thickness and defined by curved chilled margins, spherulitic textures, glassy margins and/or hyaloclastites, and microcrystalline to cryptocrystalline groundmass grain size, as well as decreasing crystal abundances and sizes (phenocrysts, groundmass) toward the glassy rims.   
• Lobate lava flows: $1\mathrm{-}2\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and formed by the same inflationary process as pillow lavas. In contrast to pillow lavas, they have massive, coarser grained, and sparsely vesicular flow interiors, often with pipe vesicle domains. Vesicle zoning occurs in the upper zones of the inflation unit as a series of vesicle bands, whereas the lower zones contain sparse, poorly defined vesicle banding and/or teardrop-shaped vesicles at the basal chilled zone.   
• Sheet lava flows and massive lava flows: defined as more texturally uniform, sparsely vesicular, and characterized by a gradual increase in grain size toward the center of the flow, with sheet lava flows being $<\!3\,\mathrm{m}$ thick and massive lava flows being $>\!3\;\mathrm{m}$ thick.  

For purposes of clarity, pillow lava flows and lobate lava flow s are considered to be the same subunit when they occurred together. When pillow lava and lobate lava flows occurred in succession o f each other, the igneous lithologic subunit was called a “pillow lav a flow.” However, if a lobate lava flow had no pillow lava flow components and occurred as a separate flow either within or between massive and sheet flows, the igneous lithologic subunit was considere d a “lobate lava flow” and given its own designation. Individual lobat e and pillow lava flows were still recorded in DESClogik, but th e lithologic subunit was not affected.  

# Contact types  

Margins and contacts of flows were described by observing th e features of the chilled sections that indicate a possible hiatus between two flows/pillows. A chilled contact, with or without glass, was recognized by observing the terminal end of the margin for sediment that was not entrenched into the rock but rather baked o r cooked onto the rock, indicating a baked or chilled contact with th e rock. A chilled margin was recognized through identification of  a sudden change in groundmass over a very short distance. Unlike  a chilled contact, sediment at the terminal end of the lobe or pillo w was not required to determine its nomenclature. Several section s were described as having a chilled contact (typically with glass) i n direct contact with sediments with an adjacent (or grading into ) chilled margin (typically without glass) where the groundmass wa s determined to be cryptocrystalline and graded into a microcrystalline texture further up- or downhole. Glassy margins, chille d margins, and contact boundaries were inserted individually for th e top and bottom of each section where they could be determined t o discriminate individual flows and allow for a greater level of precision in the descriptions.  

The following contact types were defined:  

• Baked contact: contact with sediments that were baked by proximity of lava.   
• Bottom (or top) chilled contact: chilled contact with sediments, with or without glass, in direct contact with sediments.   
• Bottom (or top) chilled margin: chilled contact without sediments, without glass, determined by cryptocrystalline groundmass, typically found quenched adjacent to the chilled contact.   
• Chilled contact: a contact that cannot be determined to be top or bottom of a flow that has sediment attached, such as a “roller.”   
• Chilled margin: a chilled contact without sediment or obvious glass that cannot be determined to be top or bottom of a flow.   
• Glassy margin: a margin between two pillows that has no sediment and the pillows have fused together. There is no clear indication of the boundary between the pillows as originally deposited.  

# Alteration  

# Alteration minerals  

Alteration minerals were recorded in DESClogik in the macroscopic template under separate tabs for alteration, veins, and halos. Primary minerals are rock-forming minerals present prior to alteration (e.g., igneous minerals), whereas secondary minerals are related  to  alteration  (e.g.,  metasomatism  and  hydrothermal circulation). Secondary minerals found replacing primary mineral s and composing vesicle fillings and veins were classified as dominant, second order, and third order.  

Identified alteration minerals or mineral mixtures include carbonate (calcite, dolomite, or siderite), chlorite, clay minerals (gree n clay), epidote (clinozoisite), secondary feldspar (albite), iddingsite, iron hydroxides, iron oxide, mica (sericite), neptunite, silica (jasper, quartz, opal, or hydrated quartz), spinel (magnetite), sulfides (chalcopyrite, covellite, pyrite, or sphalerite), zeolites, or unknown whe n the mineral could not be identified.  

# Alteration intensity  

Low-temperature and low-pressure (i.e., seafloor) mineralization, veins, and background alteration were defined as alteration. Alteration description includes primary mineralogy, groundmass, phenocryst alteration, and infilling of vesicles and halos. Texture s used to define groundmass alteration are patchy, corona, pseudomorphic, and recrystallized.  

Levels of background alteration were recorded as follows:  

Fresh $=<\!2\!\;\mathrm{vol}\%$ .   
Slight $=2–10\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ .   
Moderate $=>\!10\!-\!50\,\mathrm{vol\%}$ .   
$\mathrm{High}=>50{-}95\;\mathrm{vol}\%$ .   
Complete $=>\!95\,\mathrm{vol}\%$ .  

# Veins and halos  

We used the term “vein” to refer to any later crosscutting feature formed by sediment injection or precipitation from hydrothermal fluids and reserved the word “dike” to describe any later crosscutting feature that formed by introduction of magma. The term “halo” refers to alteration zones around veins or minerals identified by discoloration through change of the primary mineral assemblage. The density (i.e., the percentage of veins within a piece or an interval estimated visually), mineralogy, width, color, vein type (banded, composite, en echelon, haloed, intravenous, and uniform), connectivity (isolated, single, branched, and network), texture (cross-fiber, slipfiber, massive, polycrystalline, and vuggy), and contacts with host rocks (diffuse, irregular, and sharp) were described, modified from the criteria from Leg 209 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004a) (Figures F11, F12). The length, width, and orientation of representative veins in a section were measured.  

# Metamorphic petrology  

# Primary metamorphic lithology names  

The nomenclature for metamorphic rocks applied here follows the recommendations of the IUGS Subcommission on the Systematics of Metamorphic Rocks (Schmid et al., 2004). A simple but comprehensive terminology for common metamorphic rocks follows their division into three major groups on the basis of their structure (as seen in hand specimen), giving the rock its principal lithology name: schist, gneiss, or granofels. The terms essentially reflect the degree of fissility or schistosity (i.e., a preferred orientation of tabular to elongate mineral grains or grain aggregates produced by metamorphic processes) shown by the rock. If the schistosity in a metamorphic rock is well developed, the rock has a schistose texture and is termed “schist.” If it is poorly developed, the rock has a gneissose texture and is termed “gneiss,” and if schistosity is effectively absent, the rock has a granofelsic texture and is termed “granofels.” Identified characteristic rock-forming minerals were added as a prefix. One exception to this general terminology was introduced for the specific case of mylonitic metabreccias (i.e., rocks showing an overprinted inherited fabric consisting of clasts within a matrix). To emphasize that the clasts are clearly prekinematic with respect to the mylonitic foliation, they were termed “granofels clasts.”  

Other standard rock names used to describe metamorphic rocks as a function of mineralogy and texture are as follows:  

• Marble: dominated by carbonates $550\%$ calcite $\pm$ Ca-bearing silicate, such as epidote and wollastonite). If the carbonates consist of dolomite, the prefix “dolomite” was added. • Calc-silicate schist: schistose rock consisting of silicates and carbonates $1{<}50\%$ calcite $\pm\textrm{C a}$ -bearing silicate, such as epidote and wollastonite).  

# Metamorphic textures  

For metamorphic rocks, textural descriptions such as ductile (pervasive, weak, strong, or mylonitic) and brittle deformation (cataclasite or fractures) were used, as well as porphyroblasts, neo  

Figure F12. Textures used to describe veins, Expeditions 367 and 368. From Li et al. (2015), modified from Expedition 324 Scientists (2010).  

![](images/4477ef7091bd00af227a3dd2d4dbec8f6289e66ad8b7a753f4c6106836965040.jpg)  

blasts, and porphyroclasts. Reaction textures were categorized, including  prograde  and  retrograde  metamorphism,  coronas, symplectites, and intergrowths.  

For deformed rocks, characteristics include (1) fault breccia, defined as any rock composed of angular broken rock fragments held together by mineral cement or a fine-grained matrix; (2) cataclasite, defined as a rock whose mineral grains or aggregates are fractured, rotated, bent, and granulated without accompanying recrystallization; and (3) mylonites, defined as a rock from a shear zone where the dominant deformation mechanism is ductile as solid-state flow and whose mineral grain sizes are often reduced in size by dynamic recrystallization.  

# Microscopic (thin section) description  

The characterization of thin sections was used to complement and refine macroscopic core observations for igneous and metamorphic rocks (Figure F13). All thin section observations were entered into the LIMS database through a special DESClogik thin section template (see DESC_WKB in Supplementary material). Thin section descriptions include both primary (igneous) rockforming minerals (including phenocrysts, groundmass, etc.) and secondary (alteration/metamorphism) mineral phases (in veins, vesicles, groundmass, etc.). Their mineralogy, abundance (modal volume percentages), sizes, shapes, habits, textural relationships, inclusions, alteration color, intensity and style, veins (type and number), and vesicles (type and fillings) were determined, enabling verification of macroscopic observations. The percentages of the original, primary mineral phases, groundmass, and vesicles (Original $[\%]\ =$ Present $[\%]~+$ Replaced $[\%]$ ) anP when entering mineral abundances in DESClogik. Moreover, the presence of inclusions, overgrowths, zonations, and accessory minerals were documented.  

# Extrusive and hypabyssal thin section descriptions in the LIMS database  

Thin section descriptions include the following terms:  

• Sample domain: if there is more than one domain on the slide, each domain is described separately. For example, a slide that shows a large sedimentary vein $25\%$ of the slide) in a basaltic matrix $75\%$ of the slide) is described as two slides (samples): the first sample domain as “vein” and the second one as “host rock”. Other possible domains include clast, glass, halo, lithology, and xenolith.   
• Lithology prefix: lithology prefix for the described sample domain.   
• Principal lithology: refers only to the lithology of the described sample domain, which includes basalt, brecciated basalt, breccia, and hyaloclastite.

• Average groundmass grain size modal name: grain sizes follow Neuendorf et al. (2005) using the divisions glass, cryptocrystalline, microcrystalline, fine-, medium-, and coarse-grained (as defined in Primary lithology names of volcanic (extrusive and hypabyssal) rocks).

Additional features such as dissolution/resorption textures, siev e textures, and inclusions are noted in the comments section.  

Domains in DESClogik define different lithologies or textura l domains inside a single lithologic unit (see Igneous and metamorphic lithologic units and lithostratigraphic units) within a thi n section, including a diverse population of clasts, xenoliths, alteration, mingled magma, vesicular banding, and so on. Thus, thin sections encompassing a single lithologic unit might have multipl e domains defined as Domain 1, Domain 2, and so on.  

# Metamorphic thin section description  

Thin section descriptions include stable mineral parageneses, grain sizes, texture, minerals overprinting events (e.g., coronas, overgrowths, and pseudomorphs), secondary mineral assemblages, and estimation of the metamorphic facies. Such information is provided in the thin section summary in DESClogik.  

Thin section descriptions include the following terms:  

• Sample domain: if there is more than one domain on the slide, each domain is described separately. For example, a slide that shows a large granofels clast ( $25\%$ of the slide) in an epidotechlorite schist $75\%$ of the slide) is described as two slides (samples): the first sample domain as “clast” and the second one as “groundmass.” • Lithology prefix: lithology prefix for the described sample domain that includes epidote-chlorite, calc-silicate, and epidote. • Principal lithology: refers only to the lithology of the described sample domain, which includes schist and granofels. • Average grain size modal name: grain sizes follow Neuendorf et al. (2005) using the divisions cryptocrystalline, microcrystalline, fine grained, medium grained, and coarse grained.  

• Maximum grain size class: maximum grain size encountered in the thin section, which includes fine grained, medium grained, and coarse grained.   
• Grain size distribution: bimodal, equigranular, granular, inequigranular.   
• Texture: isotropic and foliated.  

# Chemical analysis  

During Expedition 368, a handheld portable X-ray fluorescenc e spectrometer (pXRF) (Olympus Delta) was used to conduct rapid i n situ chemical analysis of solid rock samples (surfaces of the archiv e core sections and thin section billets). Previous IODP expedition s (e.g., Reagan et al., 2015; Ryan et al., 2017) demonstrated the utilit y of the pXRF to provide quick chemical characterization of igneou s rocks encountered in the core. Such data are invaluable in initial assessments of broad chemical variations and the nature of the igneous rocks and, in conjunction with petrographic observations, i n determining unit boundaries. These compositional data also help t o target sample selection for postexpedition research.  

The Olympus Delta pXRF is a self-contained, energy-dispersiv e XRF survey instrument. The instrument setup includes several modes (e.g., Geochem and Soils) that apply different correctio n protocols depending on sample type and geometry. During Expedition 368, we only applied the Geochem mode, which uses two sequential beams of different energy to determine a wide range o f elements. The Olympus Delta pXRF cannot determine element s lighter than $\mathrm{Mg}$ (such as Na). For quantitative analyses, it is important to have the sample surface parallel to and in direct contact wit h the face of the instrument analyzer. To ensure a consistent geometry, two different holders were used, depending on the type of sample. Long core pieces $(>!\mathtt{5\,\,c m})$ were analyzed directly in the cor e liner using a specially made, shielded XRF holder that holds th e pXRF pointed vertically downward and resting in direct contac t with the flat core surface. For smaller rock pieces $\left(<5\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ and calibration standard powders, the pXRF was pointed vertically upwar d and supported in a stand, and a special shielded chamber was attached to the front of the instrument. This allowed samples to b e placed directly on the face of the analyzer. Analyses were made directly on the archive half of the core. Each measurement took $60{\mathrm{~s}}_{\!_{\!}}$ , and three measurements were implemented on each sample poin t and averaged for an individual analysis (following the protocol i n Reagan et al., 2015). A basaltic powder standard reference material (BHVO-2) was analyzed approximately every 12 samples to monito r data quality and instrument performance. Raw data were exporte d regularly and saved to the shipboard file directory for easy access. All data processing was done using Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  

To assess how well the correction protocols of the Geoche m analysis mode recovered accurate concentration data in igneou s rocks, calibration curves were produced on powder mounts of  a suite of international standard reference materials (JP-1, BIR-1, BEN, BCR-2, JB-2, AGV-1, and JA-2). These standards were chosen t o cover the range of compositions that were initially anticipated fo r Expedition 368 (basalts, andesites, and peridotites). The accepte d values for these standards were taken from the GEOREM databas e (http://georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de).  These  calibration  standards were analyzed at the start (11 May 2017) and end (7 Jun e 2017) of the analysis period (Table T1). Drift over this time period i s limited (Figure F14), so the data from both calibration runs wer e combined to calculate a single calibration curve for each element.  

Figure F14. Comparison plots of measured pXRF data on a suite of reference materials (JP-1, BIR-1, BE-N, BCR-2, JB-2, AGV-1, and JA-2) compared to accepte d values (preferred values from GEOREM database; http://georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de). Calibration reference materials were analyzed at the start (11 Ma y 2017; open circles) and end (7 June 2017; solid circles) of the analysis period. Drift over this time period is limited relative to the method precision, so a singl e calibration curve was calculated from these data for each element (solid black line). Calibration curves were then used to apply a secondary correction to th e raw data (see text for details). Dashed line $=1{:}1$ trend. (Continued on next page.)

These calibrations were used to correct the raw concentration dat a duce any significant bias within the precision of the pXRF data (e.g., output from the pXRF to improve the accuracy relative to the ac- Ryan et al., 2017).

ment detection limits, so these elements were not considere d further and are not reported in data tables. Although S is below detection limits in the calibration standards, it is semiquantifiable i n rocks containing sulfide minerals, so raw S concentration data ar e reported when detected in samples. The correlation curves in Figure F14 are of varying quality, but most give high correlation coefficient values $^{\left(R^{2}\ >\ 0.95\right)}$ . In a few cases, the high $R^{2}$ values ar e influenced by one standard with a significantly higher (Mg, Cr, Ni, Nb, and Mo) or lower (Al) concentration. Several elements, such a s Fe and Ca, show excellent correlations but with slopes that are significantly different to 1, and for these particular elements, makin g the secondary calibration correction is critical to get accurate data. Although $\mathrm{V}$ is above the instrument detection limits in most samples, a secondary calibration could not be applied because the calibration curve is extremely poor, and $\mathrm{V}$ results are presented as ra w data only for information.  

Results for the 42 replicate analyses of the data quality standar d reference material (BHVO-2) are given in Table T1. Two of the 4 2 analyses had anomalously low values ( $\mathrm{{SiO_{2}}}$ and $\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\mathrm{{O}}_{3}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ ), perhaps indicating that the powder mount was not properly centered over th e analysis window, and are thus excluded from the data analysis. Reproducibility over the course of analytical work during Expeditio n 368 was better than $\pm3\%$ (relative standard deviation) for many elements (Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, K, Ni, Cu, $Z\mathfrak{n},$ , Sr, Y, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ ) and bette r than $\pm10\%$ for the remaining elements (Mg, P, Cr, Rb, Nb, and Mo), except for V $(11\%)$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{Pb}}$ (which is close to the instrument detection limit in BHVO-2). In terms of accuracy, the corrected concentrations of Si, Fe, Mn, Ca, Zn, Sr, Zr, and Nb are within $3\%$ of th e accepted values for BHVO-2 and Ti, Mg, K, Cu, and Y are within $5\%$ of the accepted values.  

To complement and considerably extend the chemical analysi s made by the shipboard pXRF data set, a third-generation, energydispersive Avaatech XRF core scanner was used postexpedition. Onshore in situ XRF measurements were implemented for majo r (beyond the atomic number of $\mathrm{Mg})$ ) and selected trace elements o n Site U1500 and U1502 volcanic rock sections at the JRSO XRF Cor e Scanning Facility at the Gulf Coast Repository at Texas A&M University. A high standard resolution of $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ was applied (partiall y down to $0.1\ \mathrm{cm}$ ), whereas a lower resolution had to be chosen i n sections with cracks, rubble, and plastic spacers. Three runs wit h irradiated sample dimensions of $1.2\,\mathrm{cm}$ cross-core and $1\,\mathrm{cm}$ downcore were performed on each core section along its centerline unde r different X-ray excitation conditions (defined by appropriate kV, mA, and filter settings). Several repeated runs were carried ou t across the entire depth range of the volcanic rock section to monitor data reproducibility. Rock standard mounts were run parallel o n a regular basis for quality assurance. As part of the shipboard dat a set, the produced XRF core scanning data can be retrieved from th e LIMS database (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/LORE).  

# Structural geology  

This section outlines the tectonic terminology used in this volume to describe the general architecture of the northern Sout h China Sea margin and the methods and nomenclature applied t o document the structural features observed in the sediments an d basement rocks recovered during Expeditions 367 and 368. Suc h features encompass bedding dips, fractures and veins, faults an d folds, and fault rocks and shear zones.  

# Tectonic terminology  

Numerous classifications and terminologies have been proposed to describe the nature of hyperextended margins (see PeronPinvidic et al. [2013] and Tugend et al. [2015] for recent summarie s and  discussion).  Although  hyperextended  margins  are  ofte n equated with magma-poor rifted margins (e.g., Doré and Lundin, 2015), in this volume we simply refer to hyperextension as a proces s of profound extension (crustal stretching factor ${\sim}3$ or higher) of th e continental crust by normal faulting and low-angle detachments. This tectonic episode may or may not include several generations o f faulting. We note that hyperextension of the continental crust an d mantle lithosphere may involve different structural domains acros s the rifted margin. We refer in our study to the continent–ocea n transition as the hyperextended domain (also referred to as dista l domain) linking moderately thinned continental crust ${\sim}15\ \mathrm{km}$ thick) to oceanic crust. Oceanic crust in our study is $5\mathrm{-}6~\mathrm{km}$ thic k crust that accretes in a steady state along a focused spreading ridge. The source of new crust can range from mantle undergoing serpentinization to form a crustal layer to upwelling of asthenospheri c mantle that melts by decompression and produces new, “Penrosetype” igneous crust.  

# Methods  

After a core was split and described by sedimentologists or petrologists, we documented structural features observed on the archive half by  

• Identifying structural features and classifying their structural types,   
• Determining the top and bottom location of structural features in the core,   
• Measuring the orientation of a structural feature where applicable,   
• Determining the sense of displacement on a structural feature where applicable,   
• Determining the temporal relation between structures (especially for crosscutting structures and shear zones), and   
• Assessing the role of fluids in deformation processes.  

Our methods largely followed those used by structural geologist s from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 344 and Expedition 349 (Harris et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015). The types of structural measurements and key parameters (either observed or calculated ) were recorded on a spreadsheet (Figure F15). These data were the n input into the LIMS database using DESClogik. Where possible, orientation data were corrected for rotation related to drilling usin g paleomagnetic declination and inclination information (see Paleomagnetism) or by comparison to observed features in the Formation MicroScanner (FMS) log (see Azimuth correction based o n FMS log).  

# Graphic symbols and terminology  

A predefined set of commonly observed structural features wa s used in the structural description of cores. The terminology an d graphic symbols used are presented in Figures F16 and F17. W e identified the following major structural features:  

• Joints and fractures: brittle failure with no displacement and no secondary infill minerals. Breaks clearly resulting from drilling were logged separately as drilling-induced fractures in the Drilling disturbance spreadsheet in DESClogik.

• Veins: fractures filled with secondary minerals. Veins were described in both the Structure and Veins/halos tabs in DESClogik.   
• Fault rocks: brittlely deformed rocks such as fault breccia and fault gouge. For sake of simplicity in this volume, the term “fault breccia” is defined as a clast-supported fault rock with angular clasts, and the term “fault gouge” is defined as a matrix-supported fault rock with rounded clasts.   
• Hydrothermal breccia: fluid-assisted deformation leading to the fragmentation and brecciation of the rocks.   
• Shear zones: zones affected by ductile crystal-plastic deformation and surrounded by less deformed rocks.   
• Sedimentary bedding: layering of sediments and sedimentary rocks.   
• Folds: folded sedimentary or basement rock layers.   
• Igneous contacts: material contacts of extrusive or intrusive igneous rocks.   
• Magmatic fabrics: magmatic foliations defined by the preferred orientations of primary minerals with no evidence of crystalplastic deformation.  

# Structural observation and description  

Structural features were described from the top to the bottom o f each section of the core. For fractures, we examined and measure d the following parameters:  

• Location: where a fracture occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section.   
• Morphology and structure: morphological shape of a fracture (e.g., straight, curved, banded, irregular, composite, isolated, single or branched).   
• Displacement: lateral offset and/or opening of a fracture measured in centimeters; a closed fracture with no lateral offset is recorded as $_{0\;\mathrm{{cm}}}$ of displacement.   
• Orientation: dip angle, strike, and dip direction of a fracture measured in degrees; where applicable, reorientation of a fracture to geographic coordinates (i.e., relative to true north) was done to determine the real dip direction (see Orientation measurements and correction).   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of fractures per section.   
• Types: type of deformation of a fracture (e.g., normal, reverse, dextral, sinistral displacement, or a combination of the above). For veins, we examined and measured several parameters:   
• Location: where a vein occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section.   
• Morphology: main morphological characteristics of a vein such as shape, connectivity, texture, structure, and particular vein geometries (Figure F17).   
• Orientation: dip angle and dipping direction of a vein.   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of veins per section.   
• Mineral infill and alteration: these features are recorded as described by petrologists.  

For fault rocks, hydrothermal breccias, and shear zones, we examined and measured the following parameters:  

• Location: interval where a shear zone occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section. • Nature: type of fault rock, hydrothermal breccia, or shear zone, including fault gouge, fault breccia, cataclasite and mylonite. • Morphology: morphological shape of the deformed zone and of the clasts.  

• Orientation: dip angle and dip direction of the preferred orientation of the clasts, where applicable.   
• Deformation intensity: characterization of the deformation intensity including foliation development.   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of shear zones per section.   
• Mineral and alteration: matrix and clasts  described by petrologists.  

For sedimentary bedding, we described the following parameters:  

• Location: where a nonsubhorizontal bedding occurs in a core $(\mathrm{dip}>5^{\circ})$ ), measured in centimeters from the top of the section. • Type of contacts: type of sedimentary contact boundary. • Orientation: dip angle, strike, and dip direction of sedimentary bedding.  

For folds, we described the following parameters:  

• Location: where a fold contact occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section. • Type: type of fold. • Frequency: occurrence frequency of fold axis per section.  

For igneous contacts, we described the following parameters:  

• Location: where an igneous contact occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section. • Type of contacts: type of igneous contact boundary. • Orientation: dip angle and dip direction of an igneous contact. • Frequency: occurrence frequency of igneous contacts per section. • Mineral infill and alteration: as described by petrologists.  

For magmatic fabrics, we measured the following parameters:  

• Location: where a magmatic fabric feature occurs in a core, measured in centimeters from the top of the section.   
• Morphology: morphological shape of a magmatic fabric feature.   
• Orientation: dip angle, strike and dip direction of a magmatic fabric feature.   
• Frequency: occurrence frequency of magmatic fabrics per section. The occurrence frequency of a structure per section is normalized on a $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ section.  

# Orientation measurements and correction Orientation measurements  

We used a plastic goniometer for orientation measurements. For sealed structures, we wrapped a transparent plastic protracto r template around the core to determine the true dip (Figure F18). Orientations of planar and linear features in a core section were determined relative to the core reference frame (Figure F19). The vertical axis of the core reference frame is aligned with the upcor e direction of the core section, whereas the double line marked on th e core liner is defined as $180^{\circ}$ in the cross-sectional plane perpendicular to the core vertical axis.  

To determine the orientation of a planar structural elemen t (shaded plane in Figure F19), two apparent dips of the element wer e measured in the core reference frame. The first apparent dip measures the intersection angle between the planar structural elemen t and the split face of the core $\langle\upbeta_{1}$ in Figure F19); it is determined b y measuring the dip direction and angle of the planar structural element in the core reference frame. A planar structural element coul d have a trend of $90^{\circ}$ or $270^{\circ}$ and a plunge angle ranging from $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ . The second apparent dip measures the intersection angle betwee n

the central line of the planar structural element and the split face o f the core $\mathrm{[\beta_{2}}$ in Figure F19). In most cases, this was a plane eithe r parallel or perpendicular to the core axis. In the former case, the apparent dip would trend $0^{\circ}$ or $180^{\circ}$ with a plunge angle ranging fro m $0^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ ; in the latter case, the trend would range from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$ with a plunge angle of $0^{\circ}$ .  

A linear feature observed in the surface of a split core is ofte n associated with a planar structural element (e.g., a fault plane) in th e core; the orientation of the planar structural element is determine d by measuring either the rake (or pitch) of the associated plane or th e trend and plunge of the planar element in the core reference frame. All measured data were manually typed into the log sheet togethe r with the measured depths in the core section and descriptive information (Figure F15).  

# Plane orientation calculation  

For a planar structural element (e.g., a bedding or fault plane), two apparent dips on two different surfaces (e.g., one being the spli t core surface, which is east–west vertical, and the other being a horizontal or north–south vertical surface) were measured in the cor e reference frame. The two apparent dips are the azimuth (measure d clockwise from north, looking down) and plunge. An $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}},$ y, $z$ coordinate system was defined in such a way that the positive $x_{\mathrm{~}},y_{\mathrm{~\rightmoon~}}$ , and $z$ - directions coincide with north, east, and vertical downward, respectively. If the azimuths and plunges of the two apparent dips ar e given as $(\alpha_{1},\,\upbeta_{1})$ and $(\upalpha_{2},\,\upbeta_{2})$ , respectively, as in Figure F19, the uni t vectors representing these two lines, $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2},$ are given by the following expression:  

$$
\nu_{1}\,=\,\left({l\atop m_{1}}\right)\,=\,\left(\begin{array}{c}{{\cos\alpha_{1}\cos\beta_{1}}}\\ {{\sin\alpha_{1}\cos\beta_{1}}}\\ {{\sin\beta_{1}}}\end{array}\right)\ \mathrm{and}
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{2}\,=\,\left(\!\!{\begin{array}{c}{l_{2}}\\ {m_{2}}\\ {n_{2}}\end{array}}\!\!\right)\,=\,\left(\!\!{\begin{array}{c}{\cos\upalpha_{2}\cos\upbeta_{2}}\\ {\sin\upalpha_{2}\sin\upbeta_{2}}\\ {\sin\upbeta_{2}}\end{array}}\!\!\right)\,.}\end{array}
$$  

For any plane, the direction of the normal to the plane can b e found by taking the cross product of two (nonparallel) vectors tha t lie within the plane. Using the above equations for $\nu_{1}$ and $\nu_{2},$ therefore, the unit vector normal to plane $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ (Figure F20) is defined a s follows:  

$$
\nu_{\mathrm{n}}\,=\,\left(\!\!{\begin{array}{c}{{l_{\mathrm{n}}}}\\ {{m_{\mathrm{n}}}}\\ {{n_{\mathrm{n}}}}\end{array}}\!\!\right)\,=\,{\frac{\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}}{\left|\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}\right|}}\,,
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\nu_{1}\times\nu_{2}\,=\,\left(\begin{array}{l}{|m_{1}m_{2}|}\\ {\left|n_{1}n_{2}\right|}\\ {\left|n_{1}n_{2}\right|}\\ {\left|l_{1}l_{2}\right|}\\ {\left|l_{1}l_{2}\right|}\\ {\left|m_{1}m_{2}\right|}\end{array}\right)\hphantom{x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x}}\end{array}
$$  

The azimuth $\upalpha_{\mathrm{n}}$ and plunge $\upbeta_{\mathrm{n}}$ of the vector $\nu_{\mathrm{n}}$ are given by  

$$
\upalpha_{\mathrm{n}}\,=\,\tan^{-1}\!\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{n}}}{l_{\mathrm{n}}}\right)\,\,\mathrm{and}
$$

The dip direction $\alpha_{\mathrm{d}}$ and dip angle $\upbeta$ of this plane are $\alpha_{\mathrm{d}}=\alpha_{\mathrm{n}}$ an d $\upbeta=90^{\circ}+\upbeta_{\mathfrak{n}},$ respectively, when $\upbeta_{\mathfrak{n}}<0^{\circ}$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{d}}=\alpha_{\mathrm{n}}\pm180^{\circ}$ and $\upbeta=90^{\circ}$ $-\operatorname{\beta}_{\mathsf{n}},$ respectively, when $\upbeta_{\mathfrak{n}}\geq0^{\circ}$ . The strike of this plane, $\upalpha_{\mathrm{{s}}},$ accordin g to the right-hand rule is then given by $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}=\alpha_{\mathrm{d}}-90^{\circ}$ (Figure F20).  

# Azimuth correction based on paleomagnetic data  

Provided that a core is vertical, its magnetization is primary, th e core was magnetized in the Northern Hemisphere, and its beddin g is horizontal, its paleomagnetic declination $\upalpha_{\mathrm{p}}$ indicates the magnetic north direction when its inclination $\upbeta_{\mathrm{p}}\,\geq\,0^{\circ}$ (Figure F21); i n contrast, the angle $\upalpha_{\mathrm{{p}}}$ indicates the magnetic south direction whe n $\beta_{\mathrm{p}}<0^{\circ}$ . The dip direction and strike of a planar structural element i n the geographic reference frame, ${\upalpha_{\mathrm{d}}}^{*}$ and ${\upalpha_{\mathrm{s}}}^{\ast}$ , are therefore ${\alpha_{\mathrm{d}}}^{*}={\alpha_{\mathrm{p}}}-$ $\upalpha_{\mathrm{d}}$ and ${\upalpha_{\mathrm{s}}}^{\ast}=\upalpha_{\mathrm{p}}-\upalpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ when $\beta_{\mathrm{p}}\geq0^{\circ}$ or $\upalpha_{\mathrm{d}}{}^{\ast}=180^{\circ}+\upalpha_{\mathrm{p}}-\upalpha_{\mathrm{d}}$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}^{\ast}=180^{\circ}$ $+\ \alpha_{\mathrm{p}}-\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ when $\beta_{\mathrm{p}}<0^{\circ}$ .  

If a core section was complete and continuous, one paleomagnetism sample per section $\left(1.5\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ was deemed sufficient to determine the paleomagnetic orientation of the core section. If th e core was discontinuous, one paleomagnetism sample for each subsection of the core that was continuous and structurally importan t was required. Paleomagnetism samples were taken as cubic or cylindrical samples close to a planar structural element of interes t (usually within $5~\mathrm{cm}$ ) and from a coherent core interval that included the structural element of interest. In general, we avoide d core fragments that were so small that potential spinning durin g drilling might cause significant deviation from the core axis (e.g., fragments of brecciated segments). This procedure was carefull y followed, but for different reasons at each site we failed to reorien t our structural measurements with respect to the paleomagneti c data.

# Azimuth correction based on FMS log  

If an FMS log is available for the section of the drill hole tha t contains the core, there may be distinctive features that can be correlated from the FMS log to the core, such as bedding, fractures, folds, veins, stratification, and bioturbation. In this case, the cor e can be oriented with respect to geographic north. However, this orientation has to be done after the FMS log is obtained after all th e cores in the hole have been collected.  

# Thin section description  

Following ODP Leg 210 (the most recent expedition to sampl e basement rocks similar to those of the current expeditions), thi n sections of sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks recovered were examined to  

• Document each type of macroscopic deformation structure in a systematic and quantitative way,   
• Characterize the microstructure of the rocks,   
• Provide information on the kinematics of ductile and brittle deformation,   
• Assess the role of fluids in contributing to deformation, and   
• Document major structural zones and downhole variations.  

For the description of microstructures, we applied the terminology of Passchier and Trouw (2005). Shipboard thin sections wer e oriented, except when they were made from small pieces whose orientation with respect to the rest of the core was unknown. Orientation was in the core reference frame and was marked on each thi n section by an arrow pointing upward and a short tick pointing wes t from the base of the arrow. Marking two directions is necessary t o achieve complete orientation of thin sections, which are cut paralle l to the split surface of the core.  

# Biostratigraphy  

During  Expeditions 367  and  368, calcareous nannofossils , planktonic and benthic foraminifers, diatoms, and ostracods wer e studied in core catcher samples. Samples from core sections wer e examined when a more refined age determination was necessar y and when time permitted. Biostratigraphic events, mainly the firs t appearance datum (FAD or base) and last appearance datum (LA D or top) of the age-diagnostic species are tied to the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) of Gradstein et al. (2012) (Figure F22).  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Calcareous nannofossil zonation was based on the schemes o f Okada and Bukry (1980) and Martini (1971). Calibrated ages fo r bioevents are from Gradstein et al. (2012) and given in Table T2. The timescale  of  Gradstein et al.  (2012) assigns the Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary between the Gelasian and Piacenzia n stages $\left(2.59\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ , the Pliocene/Miocene boundary between the Zanclean and Messinian stages $(5.33\,\mathrm{\textbf{Ma}})$ , the late/middle Miocen e boundary between the Tortonian and Serravalian stages $(11.63\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , the middle/early Miocene boundary between the Langhian an d Burdigalian stages $(15.97\,\mathrm{\normalfont~Ma})$ , the Miocene/Oligocene boundar y between the Aquitanian and Chattian stages $(23.03\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , and th e Oligocene/Eocene boundary between the Rupelian and Priabonia n stages $\left(33.89\ \mathrm{Ma}\right)$ . For calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy, th e Pleistocene/Pliocene boundary now falls within Zone NN16 (Martini, 1971) between the LADs of Discoaster surculus $\left(2.49\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ an d Discoaster tamalis $\left\langle2.8\ \mathrm{Ma}\right\rangle$ . The Pliocene/Miocene boundary fall s within Zone NN12 between the LAD of Triquetrorhabdulus rugosus $(5.28\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and the FAD of Ceratolithus larrymayeri $(5.34\mathrm{~Ma})$ ; however, C. larrymayeri was not noted in our samples, so we used the FAD of Ceratolithus acutus $(5.35\mathrm{~Ma})$ ) as an alternative event. The late/middle Miocene boundary is placed within Zone NN7 between the LAD of common Discoaster kugleri $(11.58\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and th e FAD of common D. kugleri $(11.90\ \mathrm{Ma})$ . The middle/early Miocen e boundary falls within Zone NN4 between the LADs of Helicosphaera ampliaperta (14.91 Ma) and Sphenolithus belemnos (17.95 Ma). The Miocene/Oligocene boundary is placed withi n Zone NN1 between the FAD of Discoaster druggii $(22.82\ \mathrm{Ma})$ an d the LAD of Reticulofenestra bisecta $\left(>10\,\upmu\mathrm{m};23.13\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ ). The Oligocene/Eocene boundary is placed within Zone NP21 between th e LADs of Coccolithus formosus $\left(32.92\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and Discoaster saipanensis $\left(34.44\mathrm{~Ma}\right)$ . In this study, the subdivision of these geologic tim e boundaries was mostly based on recognition of these nannofossil bioevents.  

Several species of the genus Gephyrocapsa, which are commonly used as Pleistocene biostratigraphic markers, often show  a great range of variation in sizes and other morphological features, causing problems in identification (e.g., Samtleben, 1980; Su, 1996; Bollmann, 1997). Size-defined morphological groups of this genu s (Young, 1998; Maiorano and Marino, 2004; Lourens et al., 2004; Raffi et al., 2006) were used as event markers during shipboar d study, including Gephyrocapsa sp. 3, Gephyrocapsa spp. medium  I $(\ge\!4\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , large Gephyrocapsa spp. $(\geq\!5.5\,\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , Gephyrocapsa spp. medium II $({\geq}4\ \upmu\mathrm{m};$ bmG event), and small Gephyrocapsa spp. $(<\!3.5$ $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ .  

Several Reticulofenestra species with different coccolith an d central opening sizes have been used as Neogene and Quaternar y biostratigraphic markers; however, these parameters show considerable variations within and between “species,” making species differentiation difficult (e.g., Su, 1996; Young, 1998). In this study, w e followed the definition of Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus b y

Young (1998) as having a coccolith length $>\!7\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ (similar to the siz e of its holotype), especially for specimens from its uppermost rang e in the early Pliocene. We distinguished Reticulofenestra asanoi fro m the similarly sized Pseudoemiliania lacunosa by the absence of slit s on the shield (Su, 1996). In addition, we further distinguished thre e Reticulofenestra  morphotypes including Reticulofenestra ampla $(5{\sim}7~\upmu\mathrm{m},$ , with central opening), R. bisecta $^{\leftmoon}{\leftmoon}\right.^{\leftmoon}{\left.5{\sim}10\ \upmu\mathrm{m},\right.^{\left.}}$ with a soli d central plug), and $R$ . bisecta $(>\!10\ \upmu\mathrm{{m}_{\mathrm{{z}}}}$ , with a solid central plug) following Young et al. (2014).  

The LAD of Sphenolithus spp. $\left(3.54\,{\mathrm{Ma}}\right)$ ) in Pliocene Zone NN1 6 was based on the LADs of Sphenolithus abies and Sphenolithus neoabies according to Raffi et al. (2006). Species concepts for other tax a mainly follow those of Perch-Nielsen (1985) and Bown (1998).  

# Methods  

Calcareous nannofossil samples were prepared using standar d smear slide techniques. For samples from sandy sediments, suspended aliquots of the raw sample were analyzed. Samples were examined with a Zeiss microscope under XPL and plane-transmitte d or phase contrast light at $1000\times$ to $2000\times$ magnification. A Hitach i TM3000 tabletop scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used t o confirm the presence of small forms such as Emiliania huxleyi, a n important marker for the latest Pleistocene–Holocene. Preservatio n of nannofossils was defined as follows:  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (no evidence of dissolution and/or overgrowth).   
$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (slight dissolution and/or overgrowth; specimens are identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (some etching and/or overgrowth; most specimens are identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (severely etched or overgrowth; most specimens cannot be identified at the species and/or generic level).

The relative abundance of calcareous nannofossils within th e sediment was visually estimated at $1000\times$ magnification by referrin g to the particle abundance charts in Rothwell (1989) and reporte d using the following abundance categories:  

$\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant $7\mathrm{90\%}$ of sediment particles).  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of sediment particles).   
$C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $(>\!10\%-50\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $\mathrm{[\%-10\%}$ of sediment particles).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no nannofossils present in $100\,\mathrm{FOV})$ .  

The relative abundance of individual calcareous nannofossi l species or taxa groups was estimated at $1000\times$ magnification an d defined as follows:  

$\boldsymbol{\mathrm{D}}=$ dominant $750\%$ , or 100 specimens/FOV).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\underline{{{}}}10\%{-50\%}$ , or 10–100 specimens/FOV).   
$C=$ common $(1\%{-}10\%$ , or 1–10 specimens/FOV).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $(0.1\%{-}1\%$ , or 1 specimen/1–10 FOV).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $_{<0.1\%}$ , or $_{<1}$ specimen/10 FOV).  

# Foraminifers  

# Planktonic foraminifers  

The planktonic foraminiferal zonation schemes of Blow (1969, 1979) and Berggren et al. (1995) as modified by Wade et al. (2011 ) were used in this study. Calibrated ages for bioevents are fro m Gradstein et al. (2012) (Table T3). We also adopted the use of th e LAD $.0.12\,M{\bf a}$ ; Thompson et al., 1979) and FAD ( $1.16\;\mathrm{Ma}$ ; Li et al., 2005) of Globigerinoides ruber (pink) as biostratigraphic indicators. The FAD of G. ruber (pink) acme ( $.0.40\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ; Li et al., 2005) was als o adopted. The age for the LAD of Globorotalia mutlicamerata (2.1 8 Ma) was adjusted based on regional stratigraphic work (Li et al., 2005).  

Taxonomic concepts for Neogene and Paleogene taxa mainl y follow those of Kennett and Srinivasan (1983) and Bolli and Saunders (1985).  

Planktonic foraminifer species distribution and range charts ar e presented in each site chapter.  

# Benthic foraminifers  

Taxonomic assignments for benthic foraminifers follow Loeblich and Tappan (1988), Kaminski and Gradstein (2005), and Holbourn et al. (2013). Paleodepth estimates were based on selecte d benthic foraminiferal taxa noted and described by van Morkhove n et al. (1986) using the following categories:  

Neritic $=-200\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
Bathyal $=200{-}2000\,\mathrm{m}$ .   
Upper bathyal $=200{-}600\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
Middle bathyal $=600–1000\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
Lower bathyal $=1000{-}2000\,\mathrm{m}$ .   
Abyssal $=>\!2000\;\mathrm{m}$ .   
Upper abyssa $\v{v}_{\phi}=2000{-}3000\,\mathrm{m}$ .   
Lower abyssal $=>\!3000\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

Benthic foraminiferal assemblage composition and paleodept h estimates were based on counts of at least 100 specimens from th e ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions, where possible.  

# Preparation and examination techniques  

Sample preparation for foraminifer identification uses the sam e techniques for both planktonic and benthic foraminifers. Cor e catcher samples (and additional core samples as needed) wer e soaked in distilled water and washed over a $63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ mesh sieve. Consolidated or lithified samples were cut in pieces and crushed to pe a size, to which a hydrogen peroxide solution was added. This mixture was heated in the oven below $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for several hours and the n sieved as above. Some samples were rewashed by additional disaggregation with the hydrogen peroxide solution. All samples wer e dried in a low temperature oven at ${\sim}50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The dried samples wer e sieved over a $150\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve, retaining the ${<}150\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction in  a separate vial. To avoid contamination of foraminifers between samples, the sieves were thoroughly cleaned between samples, place d into a sonicator for at least $15\;\mathrm{min}$ , and then carefully checked. Species identifications for planktonic and benthic foraminifers wer e generally made on the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions. The $63{-}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ siz e fraction was observed for distinctive taxa.  

In addition, mudline (or hole top) samples were taken from selected sites and analyzed for planktonic and benthic foraminifer s and ostracods. Mudline samples were collected by emptying th e sediment/water material from the top core liner of a hole into  a bucket and then washing it with tap water over a $63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve. Sample staining using Rose Bengal $(1\,\mathrm{g/L})$ was performed to confirm th e presence of living foraminifers and ostracods in the mudline sample. For this, a portion of the sample was incubated for $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ wit h Rose Bengal stain before being washed through a $63\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ sieve. All samples were then dried at ${\sim}50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and subsequently examined under a binocular light microscope. Selected microfossil specimen s were also examined and imaged using the shipboard SEM.  

The total abundance of planktonic foraminifers was reporte d using the following categories:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $530\%$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total residue).   
$C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $10\%{-}30\%$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total residue).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(\%1\!-\!10\%$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total residue).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present $(-1\%$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total residue).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no planktonic foraminifer specimens in total residue).  

Individual planktonic foraminifers were recorded in qualitativ e terms based on an assessment of forms observed in a random sample of ${\sim}400$ specimens from the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction. Relativ e abundances were reported using the following categories:  

$\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $530\%$ of the assemblage).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!10\%{-}30\%)$ ).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%)$ .   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $(1\%-5\%)$ .   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present $(<\!1\%)$ .  

Preservation of planktonic foraminifer assemblages was recorded using the following categories:  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (no evidence of breakage or dissolution).   
$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ $580\%$ of specimens unbroken with only minor evidence of diagenetic alteration).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate $30\%{-}80\%$ of the specimens unbroken).   
$\Gamma={\mathsf{p o o r}}$ (strongly recrystallized or dominated by fragments and broken or corroded specimens).  

# Ostracods  

Ostracods were studied at selected sites when time was available. Sample preparation for ostracod examination and illustratio n followed the same techniques as for foraminifers. Ostracod taxonomic assignments follow Yang et al. (1990), Zhao et al. (2000), Zhao (2005), Hu and Tao (2008), and Alvarez Zarikian (2015).  

Abundance of ostracods was noted using the following definitions:  

$C=$ common $^{>20}$ specimens per sample).   
${\boldsymbol{\mathrm{X}}}=$ present ( $^{<20}$ specimens per sample).

Ostracod preservation was estimated using the following definitions:  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (valves translucent; no evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
$G=\mathtt{g o o d}$ (valves semitranslucent; little evidence of overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (common but minor calcite overgrowth, dissolution, or abrasion).   
$\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{poor}$ (substantial overgrowth, dissolution, or fragmentation of the valves).  

# Diatoms  

# Diatom zonal scheme and taxonomy  

The taxonomy for diatoms studied during Expeditions 367 an d 368 is taken largely from Burckle (1972), Akiba (1986), Akiba an d Yanagisawa (1986), Baldauf and Iwai (1995), Barron (1981, 1985, 2005), and Barron et al. (2004). The diatom datum sequence follow s Lazarus et al. (2014) with adjustments based on updates (J.A. Barron, pers. comm., 2017) and calibration to the GPTS of Gradstein e t al. (2012) (Table T4). The diatom zonal scheme used follows th e biostratigraphic study by Scherer et al. (2007). A taxonomic list o f relevant diatom species is given in Table T5.  

# Methods  

Strewn slides were prepared for samples examined from Expedition 368 by placing a small amount of raw sediment onto a slide an d allowing the water to evaporate by heating on a hot plate for ${\sim}5\;\mathrm{min}$ . About 1–2 drops of optical adhesive were applied to the dry slide, which was then covered with a $22\:\mathrm{mm}\times40\:\mathrm{mm}$ glass coverslip. Th e adhesive was solidified by placing the slide under ultraviolet ligh t for ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{min}$ . Strewn slides were scanned at a maximum magnification of $1250\times$ for stratigraphic markers and other common taxa.  

Abundance estimates of the diatom assemblage are qualitativ e estimates of the concentration of diatoms in individual sedimen t samples as defined by the following categories:  

$\mathrm{D}=$ dominant $590\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of sediment particles).   
$C=$ common $(>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $\!\!\:(1\%\!-\!10\%)$ of sediment particles).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare ${<}1\%$ of sediments particles).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none present).  

Abundance of individual diatom species was recorded using th e following categories:  

$\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( ${>}50$ valves per counted transect).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $^{>}20{-}50\$ valves per counted transect).   
$C=$ common $_{>10-20}$ valves per counted transect).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $_{>1-10}$ valves per counted transect).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $\lvert\le\rvert1$ valve per counted transect).  

Preservation of the diatom assemblage was recorded using th e following categories:  

$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (majority of specimens complete with minor dissolution and/or breakage and no significant enlargement of the areolae or dissolution of the frustules rim detected; the sample generally has a high diatoms per gram concentration).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (minor but common areolae enlargement and dissolution of the frustule rim with a considerable amount of breakage of specimens).   
$\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (strong dissolution or breakage, some specimens unidentifiable, strong dissolution of the frustule rim and areolae enlargement; the sample generally has lower diatoms per gram concentration).  

# Other microfossils  

The presence of other microfossils such as pteropods, fish teeth , sponge spicules, corals, radiolarians, and other bioclasts found i n the ${>}150\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fractions was noted.

# Paleomagnetism  

Shipboard paleomagnetic investigations were conducted o n both the archive and working halves of cores recovered during Expeditions 367 and 368. The primary objectives were to determin e directions of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) components, including magnetic polarity, and downhole variation of magneti c properties.  

Shipboard paleomagnetic investigations combined three complementary approaches: (1) measurement and in-line alternatin g field (AF) demagnetization of archive-half sections on the passthrough 2G Enterprises (model 760R-4K) superconducting roc k magnetometer (SRM), (2) measurement and thermal demagnetization of oriented discrete samples on the SRM, and (3) measuremen t and AF demagnetization of oriented discrete samples on the spinner magnetometer (AGICO model JR6). Additionally, the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) was measured on discret e samples with the AGICO KLY 4 Kappabridge.  

Discrete cube samples were collected from the central part o f working-half sections to reduce the effect of drilling disturbance. The discrete sampling strategy was modified depending upon lithology (sediments versus basement), type of drilling used (e.g., sof t sediments can be disturbed by RCB coring to the point of not bein g usable for magnetic inclination), and recovery rate. For basemen t rocks, at least one cube was collected per major lithologic unit (a s defined by petrologists) to characterize the magnetic response o f major units, different grain-size distributions, and deformation. These data were to be used by shipboard paleomagnetists to construct the magnetostratigraphy and by structural geologists to orient cores. Due to the low recovery in basement $(<\!20\%)$ , sample s were shared with the petrophysics team to measure porosity an d moisture during Expedition 367 and until Hole U1501D of Expedition 368. The sample sharing significantly slowed down data acquisition for both teams (old protocol in Table T6). Furthermore, heating samples to $105\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ in a magnetically unshielded oven impart s an undesirable artificial magnetization on samples. The only way t o remove this artificial magnetization is to thermally demagnetize th e sample to $250^{\circ}/350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , which results in the loss of all demagnetization steps between $95^{\circ}$ and $350^{\circ}C$ . Considering that a cube is no t necessary to perform a density and porosity measurement, a ne w protocol was suggested that includes the use of residuals (Table T6). Moreover, for shared samples (cubes of hard rock) we proposed t o use the magnetically shielded oven (ASC Scientific model TD48SC), which can accommodate up to 48 samples at a time. Bot h teams agreed to follow this protocol and to apply it for the rest o f Expedition 368.  

Previous paleomagnetic studies documented a coring-induced , isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) imparted on the cor e (e.g., Pinto and McWilliams, 1990; Fuller et al., 1998; de Wall an d Worm, 2001).  

Both section-half and discrete data, collected on the passthrough SRM and spinner magnetometer, respectively, were uploaded to the LIMS database. We then analyzed the stepwise demagnetization data of the discrete samples by principal componen t analysis (PCA) to define the characteristic remanent magnetizatio n (ChRM) (Kirschvink, 1980). Data visualization (Zijderveld demagnetization plots and equal area projections) and PCA were conducted using the PuffinPlot software (version 1.03, 23 April 2015 ) (Lurcock and Wilson, 2012).  

# Magnetic measurements on archive-half sections  

The remanent magnetization of archive-half sections was measured using a pass-through SRM equipped with direct-curren t superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and a n in-line, automated three-axis AF demagnetizer capable of reachin g a peak field of $80\;\mathrm{mT}$ .  

Measurement of archive halves was conducted using the SR M software (IMS-SRM version 9.2) assuming a sample area of $17.5\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for conversion to volume-normalized magnetization units $(\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m})$ . The interval between NRM measurement points was typically at 2. 5 to $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ spacing for sedimentary material (depending on the expected sedimentation rate) and $2.0\ \mathrm{cm}$ for igneous rocks at th e speed of $10\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathbf{s}$ . The response functions of the pick-up coils of th e SQUID sensors have a full width of $7.25{-}8.8~\,\mathrm{cm}$ at half height. Therefore, data collected within ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{\cm}$ of piece boundaries (o r voids) can be significantly affected by edge effects and have to b e treated with caution.  

We performed successive AF demagnetizations using the SR M in-line AF demagnetizer on all split-core archive sections. The inline AF demagnetizer applies a field to the $x_{\mathrm{~}},\,y_{\mathrm{~\rangle~}}$ , and $z$ -axes of th e SRM in this fixed order (Figure F23A, F23D). Previous reports suggest that higher AF demagnetization fields have produced significant anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) along the $z$ -axi s of the SRM (e.g., Harris et al., 2013b). Considering this limitation, we only used demagnetization steps up to $25~\mathrm{mT}$ to demagnetiz e the sections. Depending on time constraints imposed by the rate o f core recovery, for most of the sediment sections we performed 3– 6 steps from NRM up to 15 or $25~\mathrm{mT}$ For basement rocks during Expedition 367, we adopted a set of narrower AF steps of $2~\mathrm{mT}$ fro m NRM to $10\,\mathrm{\mT}$ and steps of $5~\mathrm{mT}$ from 10 to $25\,\mathrm{\mT}$ . For Hol e U1505C (starting from Section 3H-2) and for Holes U1504A , U1504B, and U1505C, only NRM was measured. This decision wa s

made after a comparison of magnetization intensities between discrete samples and sections led us to suspect that the SRM was no t properly calibrated (geometrically) for core sections. AF demagnetization results were plotted individually as vector plots (Zijderveld, 1967)and as downhole variations with depth. We inspected th e plots visually to evaluate whether the remanence after demagnetization at the highest AF step reflects the ChRM and geomagnetic polarity sequence.  

Low-field magnetic susceptibility (κ), measured on whole-roun d core sections using the WRMSL and archive-half core sections using the SHMSL (see Physical properties), was used to assess th e concentration of magnetic minerals and to determine the downhol e relative paleointensity $\mathbf{(NRM/K)}$ . These whole-round records o f magnetic susceptibility were compared to visual features in the spli t cores to flag possible artifacts.  

# Magnetic measurements on discrete samples  

Discrete samples were initially measured on both the SRM and  a spinner magnetometer. These samples were subjected to AF demagnetization treatments using both the 2G in-line AF demagnetizer (as described above) and the DTECH (model D-2000) A F demagnetizer. But the resultant demagnetization behavior of th e discrete samples becomes noisy at higher AF treatments, and thu s measurement on the SRM is not recommended for discrete samples. This recommendation is also confirmed by shipboard tests o f the reliability of discrete measurements on the 2G SRM. The routine AF demagnetization treatment was performed using th e DTECH (model D-2000) AF demagnetizer. In addition, to avoi d contamination by the ambient magnetic field during shipboar d measurements, two cylindrical mu-metal shields provided a suitable low-field environment for temporary sample storage.  

Oriented discrete samples were taken preferentially in finegrained intervals where drilling deformation was minimal. In sof t sediment, discrete samples were taken in plastic “Japanese” Natsuhara-Giken sampling cubes $\mathrm{[\Omega_{cm}}3$ sample volume; Figure F23B) . Cubes were pushed into the working half of the core with the “up ” arrow on the cube pointing upsection in the core. In lithified sediments and hard rocks, $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ cubes ( $8\;\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ sample volume) were cu t with the parallel saw.  

Incremental AF demagnetization of discrete samples was performed with the DTECH AF demagnetizer (model D-2000) at field s up to 45 or $50~\mathrm{mT}$ for lower coercivity samples and 120 or $200~\mathrm{mT}$ for high-coercivity samples. We also applied progressive thermal demagnetization using a thermal specimen demagnetizer (ASC Scientific model TD-48SC) up to $700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at steps of $25^{\circ}$ to $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ depending on the magnetic minerals present in the sample. Durin g Expedition 367, a combination of stepwise AF and thermal demagnetization was applied.  

AMS was measured on an AGICO KLY 4S Kappabridge instrument at a field of $300\ \mathrm{A/m}$ using the AMSSpin LabVIEW progra m designed by Gee et al. (2008) or the SUFAR (AGICO) program. Th e KLY 4S Kappabridge measures AMS by rotating the sample alon g three axes, stacking the data, and calculating the best-fit secondorder tensor. It also measures the volume-normalized calibrate d bulk susceptibility $(\upchi)$ .  

# Coordinates  

All magnetic data are reported relative to the IODP orientatio n conventions: $+x$ is into the face of the working half, $+y$ points toward the left side of the face of the working half, and $+z$ point s downsection. The relationship of the SRM coordinates $(X_{\cdot},\,Y_{\cdot}$ , an d $Z_{\cdot}$ -axes) to the data coordinates $(x-,\,y-,$ , and $z$ -directions) is as follows: for archive halves, $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction $=X\cdot$ -axis, $y$ -direction $=-Y-$ axis, and $z$ -direction $=Z$ -axis; for working halves, $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -direction $=-X$ -axis, $y_{\mathrm{~\,~}}$ -direction $=Y.$ -axis, and $z$ -direction $=Z$ -axis (Figure F23). The coordinate systems for the spinner magnetometer and NatsuharaGiken sampling cubes are also shown in Figure F23.  

# Core orientation  

Paleomagnetic study of marine sediment cores is greatly enhanced if the angle between magnetic north and the double lin e marked on the core liner can be determined. Core orientation o f APC cores was achieved with the orientation tool (Icefield MI- 5 core orientation tool) mounted on the core barrel. The Icefield MI- 5 core orientation tool consists of triaxial magnetometers and accelerometers. These sensors provide an azimuthal correction for th e core barrel that, combined with the local magnetic declinations, allows the measured NRM declinations to be transformed into tru e geographic coordinates. In the orientation deployment, the tool i s connected to the core barrel with the double lines on the core line r at a fixed and known angle relative to its sensors. Previous expeditions have reported that in general these orientation tools have a n accuracy of $20^{\circ}{-30^{\circ}}$ . Unlike earlier expeditions that reported reversed directions (i.e., $180^{\circ}$ instead of $0^{\circ}$ ) during a period of norma l polarity, the declinations (above ${\sim}160~\mathrm{m}$ from the APC cores) corrected based on the Icefield data are consistent with the inclinations.  

The ChRMs can also provide a reference frame to orient core s (see Structural geology). Provided that the reference magnetic pol e is known, the orientation of the paleomagnetic vector is then use d to restore the azimuth of the $+x$ core axis (e.g., Fuller, 1969).  

# Magnetostratigraphy reference scale and interpretations  

The magnetostratigraphy at each site was constructed by correlating observed polarity sequences with a reference GPTS in combination with biostratigraphic biohorizons. The GPTS used fo r Expeditions 367 and 368 (Table T7) is the GPTS2016 synthesis o f astronomical tuning of Cenozoic through latest Cretaceous polarit y zones updated in Ogg et al. (2016). The Cenozoic portion o f GPTS2016, together with microfossil and nannofossil biozones, i s plotted in Figure F24.  

For azimuthally unoriented samples from sedimentary rock s that formed at low latitudes, such as those at the Expedition 367 an d 368 drill sites, determining the polarity of sedimentary units can b e difficult. The polarity ambiguity arises when the samples are azimuthally unoriented and the inclination is very shallow near th e Equator (the angular distance between reversed and normal polarity inclinations is small). Because paleomagnetic inclinations fro m any samples will have some degree of dispersion about their mea n inclination, it is likely that when the mean inclination is shallo w (near zero), the sign of the inclination will not be indicative of th e polarity (e.g., McFadden and Reid, 1982; Cox and Gordon, 1984). The sign of the inclination of these samples should be used carefull y as a definitive estimate of magnetic polarity.  

We applied the following methods to establish magnetozones:  

• Observing near- $\cdot180^{\circ}$ shift in declinations and significant changes in inclinations from pass-through measurements on long coherent core sections after AF demagnetization. The observed magnetozones are then checked with the ChRM directions of the discrete samples from the corresponding intervals. • Comparison of inclination trends with predicted paleolatitudes of the drill sites according to the absolute plate motion of the South China plate on global plate circuit reconstructions (e.g., Scotese, 2014a, 2014b). However, the reconstructed position of the drill holes through the Cenozoic has negligible displacement in paleolatitude because that plate and the adjoining main Asian landmass underwent clockwise rotation.  

Whenever possible, we provide an interpretation of the magnetic polarity, with the naming convention following that of correlative chron and anomaly numbers prefaced by the letter C (e.g., Og g et al., 2016). Normal polarity subchrons are referred to by addin g suffixes (n1, n2, etc.) that increase with age. For the younger part o f the timescale (Pliocene–Pleistocene), we use the traditional name s to refer to the various chrons and subchrons (e.g., Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, etc.). In general, polarity reversals occurring at th e end of core sections have been treated with extreme caution.

Figure F24. Selected Cenozoic marine and terrestrial biostratigraphic zonations. Age is the time equivalent of the rock-record stage. Subepoch groupings o f these ages into “late” or “early” are informal common usage. Magnetic polarity zones are scaled to astronomical cycles (e.g., Hilgen et al., 2012; Vandenbergh e et al., 2012; Westerhold et al., 2015). Planktonic foraminifer zones and main markers are from GPTS2012 (Hilgen et al., 2012; Anthonissen and Ogg, 2012) wit h Paleogene modified from Wade et al. (2011), but late Pliocene details for Zones PL4–PL5 between Atlantic (Atl.) and Pacific (Pac.) basins are omitted. Placemen t of proposed base Chattian marker of last common occurrence (LCO) of Chiloguembelina cubensis is relative to Oligocene magnetic polarity chrons; hence, th e assigned age to the Rupelian/Chattian boundary is uncertain. Calcareous nannofossil (CN) zones and markers from Backman et al. (2012) and Agnini et al. (2014) are shown with commonly used NN and NP zonations of Martini (1971). Major sea level sequence boundaries and highstands are from Hardenbol et al. (1998). Additional zonations, biostratigraphic markers, geochemical trends, sea level curves, and details on calibrations are compiled in Hilgen et al. (2012) an d Vandenberghe et al. (2012) and in internal data sets within the TimeScale Creator visualization system (free at https://engineering.purdue.edu/Stratigraphy/tscreator/index/index.php). Modified from Ogg et al. (2016).

# Geochemistry  

The shipboard geochemistry program for Expeditions 367 an d 368 included the following measurements:  

• Headspace gas content;   
• Interstitial water composition;   
• Sedimentary geochemistry, including total inorganic carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, and major and minor element content; and   
• Igneous and metamorphic rock geochemistry (major and minor element content).  

Our analytical procedures follow those described by Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 345 and IODP Expeditions 349, and 352 (Gillis et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015; Reagan et al., 2015). Ou r analyses were conducted to satisfy routine shipboard safety and pollution prevention requirements; characterize interstitial water, sediment, and rock geochemistry for shipboard interpretation; an d provide a basis for sampling for subsequent shore-based research.  

# Headspace gas analysis  

For headspace gas analysis, $5\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were collected immediately after core retrieval on deck, placed in a $20~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass vial, sealed with a septum, and crimped with a metal cap. When consolidated or lithified samples were encountered, chips of material wer e placed in the vial and sealed and soft-sediment samples were collected with a sawn-off syringe or with a scoop. If an interstitial wate r sample was obtained, the headspace sample was taken from the to p of the section immediately next to the interstitial water sampl e whenever possible. Otherwise, the headspace sample was take n from the top of the third section. The vial was labeled with the core, section, and interval from which the sample was taken and the n placed in an oven at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\ \mathrm{min}$ . A $5~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ aliquot of gas wa s extracted through the septum with a gas-tight glass syringe an d then injected into a gas chromatograph (GC).  

An Agilent 6890 GC equipped with a flame ionization detecto r (FID) was used to measure the concentrations of methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethylene $\left(C_{2=}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propylene $\left(C_{3=}\right)$ . A $2.4~\mathrm{m}$ $\times\:2.0\:\mathrm{mm}$ stainless steel column packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSe p ${}^{\ast}\mathbf{R}^{\ast}$ was installed in the GC oven. The injector consists of a $^1\!/\!_{16}$ inc h Valco union with a $7\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ screen connected to a Valco-to-Luer loc k syringe adapter. This injector connects to a 10-port Valco valve tha t is switched pneumatically by a digital valve interface. The injecto r temperature was set at $120^{\circ}{C}$ throughout each run. Samples wer e introduced into the GC through a $0.25~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample loop connecte d to the Valco valve. The valve can be switched automatically to backflush the column. The oven temperature was programmed to star t at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $8.25\,\mathrm{min}$ and then increase to $150^{\circ}C$ at a rate of $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ and hold for $5~\mathrm{min}$ . Helium was used as the carrier gas. Initial helium flow in the column was $30\;\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{min}$ . Flow was then ramped u p to $60\,\mathrm{mL/min}$ after $8.25\;\mathrm{min}$ to accelerate elution of $C_{3}$ and ${C}_{3=}$ . Th e run time was $15\;\mathrm{min}$ . The GC was also equipped with an electroni c pressure control module to control the overall gas flow. The FI D was set at $250^{\circ}C$ . Data were collected and evaluated with an Agilen t Chemstation data handling program. Chromatographic respons e was calibrated against known standards provided by Scott Specialt y Gases.  

No accurate measurement of the sediment mass was carrie d out. As such, measured concentrations are semiquantitative (likel y carrying a $\pm25\%$ relative uncertainty, mainly reflecting variations i n the sediment mass around the target mass) and are only indicativ e for safety monitoring. However, gas ratios (e.g., $C_{1}/C_{2})$ are not affected by the uncertainty on the sediment mass.  

# Interstitial water chemistry  

# Interstitial water collection  

Routine interstitial water samples were obtained by squeezin g whole-round sections cut from cores. Standard whole-round samples were $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ long, but as water content decreased downhole, th e size of the whole-round samples was increased to $15~\mathrm{cm}$ to enabl e extraction of ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{~mL~}$ of water needed for shipboard and shorebased analyses. Interstitial water collection stopped when it was n o longer possible to obtain ${\sim}10~\mathrm{mL}$ for shipboard analyses by squeezing $15{-}20~\mathrm{cm}$ long whole-round sediments. Whole-round sample s were cut and capped as quickly as possible after the core arrived o n deck and immediately moved to the chemistry laboratory fo r squeezing. Whole-round samples were typically collected at a frequency of ${\sim}3$ samples per core in the first 5 cores, 2 samples pe r core for cores 5–10, and subsequently 1 sample per core. Samples o f basement were not collected for squeezing interstitial water.  

The exterior of the whole-round sample was carefully scrape d with a spatula to remove potential contamination from drilling flui d and sediment smearing in the borehole. In APC cores, ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{cm}$ o f material from outside of the whole round was removed, whereas i n XCB and RCB cores, where borehole contamination is higher, a s much as two-thirds of the sediment was removed from each whol e round. The cleaned sediment was placed into a $9\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter titanium squeezer that was then placed in a Carver hydraulic pres s (Manheim and Sayles, 1974) and squeezed at pressures no highe r than 30,000 lb $({\sim}20.3~\mathrm{\MPa)}$ ) to extract interstitial water. Th e squeezed interstitial water was collected in precleaned high-densit y polyethylene syringes attached to the squeezing assembly. Subsequently, the interstitial water was filtered through a $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ polyethersulfone membrane disc filter into various sample containers, except for aliquots taken for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, which were filtered through a $0.2~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ polyethersulfone membrane disc filter.  

Sample allocation was determined based on the pore fluid volume obtained and analytical priorities based on the objectives of th e expedition. Aliquots for major and minor elements by ICP-AE S were acidified by adding ${\sim}10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of trace metal–grade concentrate d $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and placed in $2~\mathrm{mL}$ cryovials. Aliquots for chloride and alkalinity titration, ammonium and phosphate spectrophotometry analyses, and ion chromatography analyses were put in $8\;\mathrm{mL}$ glass vials. Aliquots for isotopic analyses of oxygen and hydrogen were place d in zero-headspace $2~\mathrm{mL}$ septum screw-lid glass vials. Aliquots fo r Sr, B, and Li isotopes were acidified by adding ${\sim}10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of trac e metal–grade concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and placed in two $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ cryovials. Aliquots for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and DOC and thei r $\delta^{13}C$ were treated with $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a saturated $\mathrm{{HgCl}_{2}}$ solution an d placed in zero-headspace $2~\mathrm{mL}$ and $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ septum screw-lid glass vials, respectively. Aliquots for $\mathrm{TH}_{2}S$ were placed in $2~\mathrm{mL}$ septu m screw-lid glass vials with $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ of ${\sim}50~\mathrm{mM}$ zinc acetate solution. The samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ after collection.  

Alkalinity, ${\mathsf{p H}},$ , and salinity were analyzed immediately after interstitial water was obtained. Other shipboard analyses were carrie d out in batches. Dissolved sodium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bromide, and sulfate were analyzed by ion chromatography. Ammonium and phosphate were analyzed by UV-VIS spectrophotometry. Minor element concentrations were analyzed by ICP-AES.  

After  interstitial  water  extraction  was  complete,  sedimen t squeeze cakes were divided and sealed in plastic bags for shipboar d and shore-based analyses. Squeeze cake samples for shore-based organic analysis were stored at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . All other squeeze cake sample s were refrigerated at $4^{\circ}C$ .  

# Shipboard interstitial water analysis  

Interstitial water samples were analyzed on board following th e protocols in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program user manual for shipboard instrumentation, which was updated during Expedition 344 (Harris et al., 2013).  

# Salinity, alkalinity, and pH  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately afte r squeezing, following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinit y was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handhel d refractometer. The ${\mathsf{p H}}$ was measured with a combined glass electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with an autotitrator (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino). Three milliliters of interstitia l water sample was titrated against $0.1\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HCl}$ at $25\mathrm{{^\circC}}$ . Internationa l Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater was used for calibration and was analyzed at the beginning and end of a set of samples for each site and also every 5–1 0 samples. Both the analytical precision and accuracy of alkalinity titrations were better than $3\%$ based on repeated analysis of IAPS O standard seawater.  

# Chloride by titration  

High-precision chloride concentrations were acquired using  a Metrohm 785 DMP autotitrator and silver nitrate $\mathrm{(AgNO_{3})}$ solutio n calibrated against repeated titrations of IAPSO standard. A $0.5~\mathrm{mL}$ aliquot of sample was diluted with $30\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $0.32\:\mathrm{M}\:\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solutio n and titrated with $0.1\ \mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{AgNO_{3}}$ . Repeated analyses of an IAPS O standard yielded a precision better than $0.06\%$ ; however, the chloride concentrations yielded by titration includes not only dissolve d chloride but also all of the other halide elements and bisulfide. Th e JOIDES Resolution is equipped with a Metrohm 850 Professiona l ion chromatograph that can analyze anions and cations simultaneously. The chloride concentration was analyzed by both titratio n and ion chromatography for Holes U1499A, U1501C, U1501D, U1502A, U1504A, and U1505C. Chloride concentrations analyze d by ion chromatography were not greater than those by titration, indicating that ion chromatography can provide mostly reliable chloride data. As a result, chloride concentration was analyzed by bot h titration and ion chromatography only for the upper $50~\mathrm{m}$ sectio n for all  sites during Expeditions 367 and 368.  

# Sulfate, chloride, bromide, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium  

Sulfate, chloride, bromide, calcium, magnesium, and sodiu m concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography (Metroh m 850 Professional IC) using aliquots of $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ that were diluted 1:10 0 with deionized water $\left\langle18\ \mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm}\right\rangle$ . At the beginning and end o f each run, different dilutions (1:80 to 1:500) of IAPSO standard seawater were analyzed to create a six point calibration curve. The $r^{2}$ for the calibration curve was always $>\!0.99$ , and relative standard deviation varied from $0.8\%$ to $3.4\%$ . The 1:100 diluted IAPSO standar d seawater was also analyzed every ${\sim}10$ samples for quality contro l and to determine accuracy and precision. A new calibration curv e was run if measured concentrations deviated from the expected values $\mathrm{28.9\:mM}$ for $S O_{4}{}^{2-}$ and $0.865~\mathrm{mM}$ for $\mathrm{Br^{-}}$ ). Based on measurements of IAPSO standard seawater, analytical precision (2σ) wa s within $1\%$ for chloride, $5\%$ for bromide, $2\%$ for sulfate, $5\%$ for calcium, $3\%$ for magnesium, and $1\%$ for sodium.  

# Ammonium and phosphate  

Ammonium and phosphate concentrations were determine d using an Agilent Technologies Cary Series SPS3 spectrophotomete r with a sipper sample introduction system following the protocol i n Gieskes et al. (1991). For ammonium concentration analysis, a 0.2 mL sample aliquot was diluted with $2~\mathrm{mL}$ reagent water to which  1 mL phenol ethanol, $1\,\mathrm{mL}$ sodium nitroprusside, and $2~\mathrm{mL}$ oxidizin g solution of sodium hypochlorite were added in a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ cappe d plastic tube (Gieskes et al., 1991). The solution was kept at roo m temperature for ${\sim}6.5~\mathrm{h}$ to develop color. Ammonium concentrations were determined at an absorbance of $640~\mathrm{nm}$ . Precision an d accuracy of the ammonium analyses of a standard were within $4\%$ and $10\%$ , respectively.  

For phosphate analysis, a $0.6~\mathrm{mL}$ sample was diluted with $2~\mathrm{mL}$ deionized water $(18~\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm})$ and $4~\mathrm{mL}$ mixed reagent solution o f ammonium molybdate, sulfuric acid, ascorbic acid, and antimon y potassium tartrate in a $15~\mathrm{mL}$ plastic tube. Then $2~\mathrm{mL}$ of mixed reagent (ammonium molybdate, sulfuric acid, ascorbic acid, and potassium antimonyl tartrate) was added to the vial (Gieskes et al., 1991), which was capped and kept at room temperature for at leas t several minutes to develop color. The phosphate concentration wa s determined at an absorbance of $885~\mathrm{nm}$ ${\sim}30~\mathrm{min}$ after adding th e mixed reagent solution. At beginning of each run, different concentrations $(0{-}300\,\upmu\mathrm{M})$ of phosphorus standards were analyzed to create an 11-point calibration curve. Based on the measurements o f $100\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$ phosphorus standard during the expedition, precision (1σ ) and accuracy of the phosphate analyses were better than $2\%$ an d $0.3\%$ , respectively.  

# Minor elements  

Dissolved minor elements were determined by Teledyne Leeman Prodigy ICP-AES. The general method for shipboard ICP-AE S analysis of samples is described in Murray et al. (2000) and the use r manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

For minor element (B, $\mathrm{Ba^{2+}}$ , $\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ , ${\mathrm{Mn}}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ , Si, and $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ ) analyses, interstitial water samples were diluted $1{:}20\ \mathrm{(v/v)}$ using $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution with $10\,\mathrm{ppm\,Y}$ (the interstitial water matrix solution) as a n internal standard. Because the high concentration of salt in interstitial water samples at the 1:20 dilution demands matrix matching o f standards and samples, standards were prepared with an acidifie d synthetic seawater of $35\%0$ NaCl with $2\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to have an ioni c strength similar to seawater. A stock multielement synthetic standard solution was gravimetrically prepared from ultrapure primar y standards (SPC Science PlasmaCAL) diluted in the acidified synthetic seawater. An eight-point calibration curve was create d through diluting the stock multielement standard in the acidifie d synthetic seawater at various degrees. Drift correction was mad e using the factor from a drift monitor solution of $100\%$ stock standard solution, which was analyzed every 8–10 samples. The ICPAES autosampler and analysis chamber were rinsed with a $3\%$ (b y volume) $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution between samples. Multiple wavelength s were measured for each element, and the best were selected for reporting element concentrations. Wavelengths were selected base d on possible interferences, the linearity of calibration curves, and th e precision and accuracy of measurements of several standards. Th e selected wavelengths were $\mathrm{Ba}=493.409\ \mathrm{nm}$ , $\mathrm{B}=249.772\;\mathrm{nm}$ , $\mathrm{Li}=$ $670.784~\mathrm{nm}$ , $\mathrm{Fe}=259.940\ \mathrm{nm}$ , $\mathrm{Si}=288.158\;\mathrm{nm}$ , $\mathrm{Mn}=257.610\;\mathrm{nm}$ , and $\mathrm{Sr}=460.733\;\mathrm{nm}$ .  

# Sediment geochemistry  

# Sediment nitrogen and inorganic and organic carbon content  

Samples $\left({\sim}50\;\mathrm{mg}\right)$ for carbon, sulfur and nitrogen analyses wer e collected from squeeze cakes from interstitial water analyses an d taken from intervals of distinct lithologic importance for expeditio n aims. Samples were freeze-dried for ${\sim}24~\mathrm{h}$ , crushed using an agat e pestle and mortar, and then analyzed for total carbon (TC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total sulfur (TS) and total nitrogen (TN).  

TC, TS, and TN of the bulk sediment samples were determine d with a ThermoElectron Corporation Flash EA 1112 CHNS elemental analyzer equipped with a ThermoElectron packed colum n CHNS/NCS GC and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Approximately $12{-}13\;\mathrm{mg}$ of dry sediment was weighed into a tin cup, and $5{-}10\,\mathrm{mg}$ of vanadium pentoxide was added. Samples were the n combusted at $950^{\circ}C$ in a stream of oxygen. The reaction gases wer e passed through a reduction chamber to reduce nitrogen oxides t o $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and then the evolved $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ $C O_{2},$ and $S O_{2}$ were separated by th e GC column before detection by the TCD. All measurements wer e calibrated to a set of reference standards covering the range in expected TC, TS, and TN values (Soil Reference Material: Buffal o River Sediments PWDR7837591) that was run every 9 samples . Peak areas from the TCD were calculated to determine the TC, TS, and TN of the samples. Blank levels were determined by analyzin g empty tin cups and were subtracted from each measurement. Blan k contributions for C is on the order of $1\,\upmu\mathrm{g}$ . Given the typical sampl e mass used ( $12.5~\mathrm{mg}$ on average) and using a signal/blank threshol d of 10, this translates into a detection limit of ${\sim}0.04\,\mathrm{\:wt\%}$ . For $\mathrm{_N}$ , blanks were also estimated from the intercept of the calibratio n curve, which gave results similar to direct blank determination (i.e., empty tin cup blank). Blank contribution for $_\mathrm{N}$ is on the order of 1 2 μg, unsurprisingly high considering the use of a sampler open to th e atmosphere. This translates into a detection limit of ${\sim}0.06\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Accuracy of TC determination was estimated using repeated measurements of reference material and was found to be better than $5\%$ o f the TC value (i.e., $<\!0.05\mathrm{\wt}\%$ for the vast majority of samples analyzed). Precision of TC determination was estimated from limite d duplicate measurements and was systematically within estimate d accuracy. TS determination was less accurate than for nitrogen o r carbon, and based on the analysis of both blank cups and minimu m detection limits obtained from calibration curves, this equates to  a TS of $0.1\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ .  

Sulfur analyses were only carried out for Expedition 368. TI C was determined using a Coulometrics $5015\;\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Approximately $13\;\mathrm{mg}$ ( $10~\mathrm{mg}$ for lithologies dominated by carbonates ) of sediment was weighed into a glass vial and acidified with $2~\mathrm{M}$ HCl. The liberated $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was titrated, and the corresponding chang e in light transmittance in the coulometric cell was monitored using  a photodetection cell. The weight percent of calcium carbonate wa s calculated from the inorganic carbon content using the followin g equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\left(w t\%\right)\times100/12.}
$$  

Blank levels were determined by analyzing empty reactors, wer e found to vary between 3 and $7\ \upmu\mathrm{g}\,\mathsf C_{:}$ , and were subtracted from eac h measurement. Repeated measurements of pure $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ (severa l times at the beginning and every 10 samples) were used to estimat e accuracy, which was $-2\%$ of the TIC. TOC content was calculate d by subtraction of TIC from TC.  

# Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of solvent extractable sedimentary organic matter  

Samples for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) o f solvent extractable organic matter were only collected during Expedition 368. They were obtained from freeze-dried residues used fo r TC analysis or collected from locations of lithologic interest to expedition goals. Powdered samples were placed in $10~\mathrm{mL}$ extractio n vials and sonicated for $15~\mathrm{min}$ in 3:1 DCM/MeOH (dichloromethane/methanol) to obtain a solvent extract. The extract was decante d into a separate vial; more DCM was added to the sediment-residu e before sonication was repeated for another $15\;\mathrm{min}$ . The solvent wa s again decanted, and the process was repeated to produce three extraction stages. The combined extract was reduced to dryness.  

The extract was dissolved in DCM, and $4~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of it was introduced in small increments to the sample wells of a gold-coate d SERS-substrate. Introducing samples as small increments allowe d the solvent to evaporate under ambient conditions until the entir e volume had been loaded. When the solvent had evaporated, $4\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ o f dilute nitric acid (1 M concentration) was dispensed into the pit an d allowed to stand for ${\sim}2{-}3\,\mathrm{\min}$ . The aqueous phase remainin g within the pit was then removed to aid focusing of the microscop e on the base of the pit. Raman spectroscopic measurements wer e performed using a BWTek i-Raman Pro fitted with a $532\;\mathrm{nm}$ ligh t source and mounted on $20\times$ video-microscope. Spectra were collected by accumulating 20 spectra over $20\ s i$ ; spectral acquisitio n was in the range 200–2000 per centimeter. Laser spot size was approximately $1{\mathrm{-}}2\ \upmu\mathrm{m},$ and laser power was $50\%$ ( $^{<13}\mathrm{\mW}$ delivere d to the sample). Identification of key bands was made with referenc e spectra presented in Alabi et al., 2015.  

# Elemental analysis of bulk sediment/sedimentary rock by ICPAES  

Elemental composition of bulk sediment was determined usin g a Leeman ICP-AES. Our analytical approach followed the general procedure outlined by Murray et al. (2000) and the constraints indicated by Quintin et al. (2002). Analytical blanks were prepared using $400~\mathrm{mg}$ of lithium metaborate $\mathrm{(LiBO_{2})}$ flux to ensure matri x matching. Samples analyzed by ICP-AES were ignited before dissolution by heating $5\ \mathrm{g}$ of oven-dried $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $12\;\mathrm{h}$ ) ground sediment at $1025^{\circ}C$ for $^{5\,\mathrm{h}}$ to determine weight loss on ignition (LOI), release volatile phases $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O},$ $C O_{2}$ , and S), and fully oxidize all iron t o ferric iron.  

Aliquots of $100\,\mathrm{~mg~}$ of ignited sediment and standards wer e mixed with $400~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ flux. Subsequently, $10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of a wettin g agent, $0.172\;\mathrm{mM}$ lithium bromide (LiBr), was added to the samples, standards, and blanks. This mixture was fused at $1050^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ in a Bead Sampler NT-4100 prior to dissolution in $50~\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ . For complete dissolution, $1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of shaking with a Burrell wristaction shaker was required. Aliquots of $5~\mathrm{mL}$ of the resulting solutions were filtered $(0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}})$ and diluted with $35~\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\%$ $\mathrm{HNO}_{3},$ resulting in a $4000\times$ dilution of the original sediment.  

A range of standards was selected to cover the entire range o f expected sediment compositions, with their suitability monitore d during the expedition. These standards were: STSD1, STSD2, STSD4, SO-1, SO-2, SO-3, SO-4, NBS-1c, JR-2, and BCR-2. BHVO2 was also selected as both the drift and consistency standard.  A range of major and trace elements was analyzed. Major elements included Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, and $\mathrm{Ti},$ and trace elements included Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Sc, Sr, V, Zn, and Zr. Major elements wer e expressed as weight percent oxide, and trace elements were expressed as parts per million. LOI values were determined routinely.  

Samples were analyzed in duplicate. The procedures used to process the data are outlined in Data reduction, below.  

The elemental compositions of sediment/sedimentary roc k were only determined during Expedition 368 because the bea d maker for the ICP did not work during Expedition 367.  

# Igneous and metamorphic rock geochemistry Sample preparation  

Representative samples of igneous and metamorphic rocks wer e analyzed for major and trace element concentrations during Expeditions 367 and 368 using the Leeman ICP-AES.  

Samples ranging in size from ${\sim}2$ to ${\sim}8~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ were cut from th e core with a diamond saw blade. A thin section billet was taken fro m the same or adjacent interval for petrographic analysis and alteration determination (see Igneous and metamorphic petrology an d Alteration). All outer surfaces were ground on a diamond-impregnated disk to remove altered rinds and surface contamination derived from the drill or saw. Each sample was then placed in a beake r containing acetone and washed ultrasonically for $15~\mathrm{min}$ . The acetone was decanted, and the samples were sonicated in deionize d water $(18\;\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm})$ twice for $10\;\mathrm{min}$ . The cleaned pieces were drie d for $10{-}12\,\mathrm{h}$ at $110^{\circ}C$ .  

The cleaned, dried samples were crushed to $<\!1\;\;\mathrm{cm}$ chips between two disks of Delrin plastic in a hydraulic press. The roc k chips were then ground to a fine powder in tungsten carbide in  a SPEX 8515 Shatterbox. After grinding, a $5.0\,\pm\,0.5\mathrm{~g~}$ aliquot of th e sample powder was weighed on a Mettler Toledo balance and ignited at $1025^{\circ}C$ for $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ to determine LOI.  

Murray et al. (2000) describes in detail the shipboard procedur e for digestion of rocks and ICP-AES analysis of samples. The following protocol is an abbreviated form of this procedure with mino r modifications. After determination of LOI, $100.0\pm0.2~\mathrm{mg}$ splits o f the ignited whole-rock powders were weighed and mixed wit h $400.0\,\pm\,0.5~\mathrm{mg}$ of $\mathrm{LiBO}_{2}$ flux that had been preweighed on shore. Standard rock powders and full procedural blanks were include d with unknowns in each ICP-AES run (note that among the element s analyzed, contamination from the tungsten carbide mills is negligible; Shipboard Scientific Party, 2003). All samples and standard s were weighed on a microbalance with weighing errors estimated t o be $\pm0.05~\mathrm{mg}$ under relatively smooth sea-surface conditions.  

To prevent the cooled bead from sticking to the crucible, $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ of $0.172\;\mathrm{mM}$ aqueous LiBr solution was added to the mixture of flu x and rock powder as a nonwetting agent. Samples were then fuse d individually in Pt-Au (95:5) crucibles for ${\sim}12\ \mathrm{min}$ at a maximu m temperature of $1050^{\circ}C$ in an internally rotating induction furnac e (Bead Sampler NT-4100).  

After cooling, beads were transferred to high-density polypropylene bottles and dissolved in $50~\mathrm{mL}$ of $10\%$ (by volume) $\mathrm{HNO}_{3},$ aided by shaking with a Burrell wrist-action bottle shaker for $1~\mathrm{{h}}$ . Following digestion of the bead, the solution was passed through  a $0.45\,{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ filter into a clean $60\;\mathrm{mL}$ wide-mouth high-density polypropylene bottle. Next, $1.25~\mathrm{mL}$ of this solution was transferred to  a plastic vial and diluted with $10\%\,\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to a total volume of $10\;\mathrm{mL}$ . The final solution-to-sample dilution factor was ${\sim}4000\times$ .  

# Analyses of igneous and metamorphic rocks  

Major (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, and Ti) and trace (Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Sc, Sr, V, Zn, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ ) element concentrations of standard s and samples were determined with a Leeman ICP-AES instrument. The plasma was ignited at least $30\;\mathrm{min}$ before each run of sample s to allow the instrument to warm up and stabilize.  

The ICP-AES data presented in the Geochemistry section o f each site chapter were acquired using the Gaussian mode of th e Prodigy software. This mode fits a curve to points across a peak an d integrates the area under the curve for each element measured. Each sample was analyzed four times from the same dilute solutio n (i.e., in quadruplicate) within a given sample run. For elements measured at more than one wavelength, we either used the wavelengt h giving the best calibration line in a given run or, if the calibratio n lines for more than one wavelength were of similar quality, used th e data from all wavelengths and reported the average concentration.  

The ICP-AES run included the following:  

• Certified rock standards, analyzed twice during each run, chosen to cover a wide range of compositions in order to calibrate the analyses (peridotite: JP-1; basalt: BIR-1, BHVO-2, and BCR2; gabbro: MRG-1; andesite: AGV-1; and granodiorite: JG-1A); • Samples (unknowns) analyzed in quadruplicate; • A drift-correcting standard (BHVO-2) analyzed in every eighth sample position and at the beginning and end of each run; • A blank solution analyzed near the beginning; • Two or three “check” standards run as unknowns, each also analyzed in quadruplicate; check standards were chosen for their compositions similar to that of the analyzed material (ultramafic: DTS-1, basalt: JB-1a, JB-2, felsic rocks: JG-2, JG-3, etc.); and • A $10\%\,\mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ wash solution run for $60\,{\mathfrak{s}}$ between each analysis.  

# Data reduction  

Following each run of the instrument, the measured raw intensity values were transferred to a data file, corrected for instrumen t drift, and then corrected for the procedural blank. Drift correctio n was applied to each element by linear interpolation between th e drift-monitoring solutions run in every eighth sample position.  

After drift correction and blank subtraction, a calibration lin e for each element was calculated using the results for the certifie d rock standards. Element concentrations in the samples were the n calculated from the relevant calibration lines.  

Individual analyses of both standards and samples produced total volatile-free major element weight percentages that vary fro m $100\,\mathrm{\;wt}\%$ by as much as several percent. Possible causes includ e some combination of errors in weighing the sample (particularly i n rougher seas) and/or flux powders (although even when weighed o n land, weighing errors are possible), variability in the dilution s (which were done volumetrically), and the duration and relativel y low temperature of ignition. To facilitate comparison of Expeditio n 367 and 368 results with each other and with data from the literature, the measured major element values were normalized to 10 0 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ totals.  

Estimates of accuracy and precision of major and trace elemen t analyses were based on replicate analyses of check standards compared to values published in Govindaraju (1994) and the GeoRe M database (http://georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de) for international rock standards and to values published in Puchelt et al. (1996). Results are presented in Table T1. During Expeditions 367 and 368, run-to-run relative standard deviation by ICP-AES was generall y $\pm1\%$ for major elements except for MgO $(\pm5\%)$ and $\pm10\%$ for trac e elements. Accuracy was better than $2\%$ for major elements and better than $5\%$ for most trace elements, with the exception of low-concentration data for $_\mathrm{Cr}$ and $Z\mathbf{r}$ .  

# Physical properties  

High-resolution physical property measurements were mad e during Expeditions 367 and 368 mainly to aid lithostratigraphi c characterization and to tie core descriptions to borehole data an d seismic profiles. In particular, physical property data play a majo r role in hole-to-hole and site-to-site stratigraphic correlation, detection of discontinuities and inhomogeneities, collection of information about differences in the composition and texture of sediment, identification of major seismic reflectors, and construction of synthetic seismic profiles. A variety of techniques and methods wer e used to characterize Expedition 367 and 368 cores on whole-round, split section-half, and discrete samples. Core sections are generall y $1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ in length, so a typical coring length (stroke) of $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ yields si x sections plus a shorter seventh section. Procedures for measurin g sediment or hard rock cores differed slightly.  

# Sedimentary cores  

Recovered whole-round sections were first allowed to equilibrate to ambient room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and pressure for ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{h}$ . After thermally equilibrating, core sections were run through th e WRMSL for measurement of density by GRA, magnetic susceptibility, and compressional wave velocity on the PWL. Cores recovere d with the XCB or the RCB coring systems are slightly smaller in diameter than those cored with the APC system. As a result, section s cored with the XCB or RCB systems typically have gaps between th e liner and the core, so $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity was not measured with h e WRMSL. Sections were then measured with the NGRL. Therma l conductivity was measured on one whole-round section per sediment core (typically Section 3) by a needle probe inserted into th e section through a small hole drilled through the plastic core line r close to the middle of the section. When the sediment cores wer e too hard to insert the needle probe, a contact probe was used instead to measure the thermal conductivity later on the section hal f after core splitting. Cores were split longitudinally, with one hal f designated as archive and one as working half for sampling an d analysis. The archive half of the core was passed through th e SHMSL for measurement of point magnetic susceptibility and colo r reflectance. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements on split cores wer e made on the working halves at least for every section that had bee n sampled for MAD, or on other sections according to the lithology, employing the transducers oriented in $x-$ and $z$ -axis directions (se e directions defined in Figure F23). Discrete samples were collecte d from the working halves (every other section) to measure wet bul k density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain densit y with MAD procedures.  

# Hard rock cores  

Recovered hard rock sections were shaken onto sterile liners in th e core splitting room for examination by a petrologist and/or a structural geologist, who decided where the pieces should be split between working and archive halves. The pieces were then put bac k into liners and run through the WRMSL and NGRL. $P$ -wave velocity was not measured because the spaces between the liner and th e rock core pieces make these measurements meaningless. Afte r physical property measurements on whole-round cores, the cor e sections were split into working and archive halves and all roc k pieces were labeled. The archive half of the core was passed throug h the SHMSL for measurement of point magnetic susceptibility an d color reflectance. Thermal conductivity was measured once pe r core using a contact probe on a piece of section half in a bath of seawater for igneous rock pieces. Samples were taken from the workin g half of the core at a sampling interval of $\sim\!1\textrm{m}$ depending on lithologic variability. Samples from igneous basement were shared fo r both paleomagnetic and MAD measurements. $P$ -wave velocit y measurements were made on these discrete samples.  

A full discussion of all methodologies and calculations use d aboard the JOIDES Resolution in the Physical Properties Laborator y is available in Blum (1997). Details and procedures for each physical property measurement are described below.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

GRA-derived bulk density, $P$ -wave velocity, and magnetic susceptibility were measured nondestructively with the WRMSL (Figure  F25).  To  optimize  the  measurement  process,  samplin g intervals and measurement integration times were set to be uniform for all sensors. Sampling intervals were set at $2~\mathrm{{cm}}$ with a n integration time of $_{5\ s}$ for each measurement. These sampling intervals are common denominators of the distances between th e sensors installed on the WRMSL $(30{-}50~\mathrm{cm})$ , which allows sequential and simultaneous measurements. After every core, qualit y assurance/quality control (QA/QC) was monitored by passing  a single core liner filled with deionized water through the WRMSL; i f deviations from expected values were observed, recalibration s could be conducted if needed.  

# GRA bulk density  

Bulk density can be used to estimate the pore volume in sediment and evaluate the consolidation state of sediment. GRA densit y is an estimate of bulk density based on the attenuation of a gamm a ray beam. The beam is produced by a $^{137}\mathrm{Cs}$ gamma ray source at  a radiation level of $370\,\mathrm{MBq}$ within a lead shield with a $5\,\mathrm{mm}$ collimator that is directed through the whole-round core. The gamma ra y detector on the opposite side of the core from the source includes  a scintillation detector and an integral photomultiplier tube to recor d the gamma radiation that passes through the core. The attenuatio n of gamma rays occurs primarily by Compton scattering, in whic h gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation; the degre e of scattering is related to the material bulk density. Therefore, for  a known thickness of sample, the density (ρ) is related to the intensit y of the attenuated gamma rays and can be expressed as follows:  

Figure F25. WRMSL (measures GRA bulk density, magnetic susceptibility, and $P\cdot$ -wave velocity), Expeditions 367 and 368. Water standard is measure d at end of each core to control measurement quality.  

![](images/e31a18e2e6cc7c0fc2cdd10bd964cfd3ae37fd1d545a0168ca9828ff718a9325.jpg)  

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I_{0}/I)/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$I=$ the measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

The $\upmu$ and $I_{0}$ are treated as constants, such that $\uprho$ can be calculate d from $I.$ . Note that this equation differs from the equation (5) in Blu m (1997) in order to correct a typo.  

In general, WRMSL measurements are most accurate whe n taken on a completely filled core liner with minimal drilling disturbance; otherwise, measurements tend to underestimate true values. By default, the instrument reports measurements using the interna l diameter of the core liner $\left(66\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for most sediment cores obtained by th e APC system; however, for sediment and/or hard rock cored by th e XCB or RCB systems, core diameter is usually about $58\;\mathrm{mm}$ or less . Following Jarrard and Kerneklian (2007), the density measurement s of cores obtained by XCB or RCB may be corrected by multiplyin g the density values by $^{66\!}/_{58}=1.138$ to account for this bias. We chos e not to correct the raw values but to mention the offset in the description of the measurements. The spatial resolution of the GR A densitometer is less than $\pm1\ \mathrm{cm}$ . The gamma ray detector is calibrated with sealed calibration cores (one standard core liner fille d with distilled water and aluminum cylinders of various diameters). To establish the calibration curves, gamma ray counts were take n through each aluminum cylinder for $60{\mathrm{~s~}}$ . Each aluminum cylinde r has a density of $2.7\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , and $^d$ is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The relationship between $I$ and $\upmu d$ is  

$$
\ln(I)=\mathrm{A}(\upmu d)^{2}+\mathrm{B}(\upmu d)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where A, B, and C are coefficients determined from the calibration.  

Recalibration was performed as needed when the deionized water QA/QC standard density deviated significantly (more than a fe w percent) from $1\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magneti c field:  

$$
\mathrm{\boldmath~\cal~X~}\!=\!M/H,
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an externa l field of strength $H.$ . Magnetic susceptibility is primarily sensitive t o the concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g., magnetite an d maghemite). It is also sensitive to magnetic mineralogy and can b e related to the origin of the materials in the core and their subsequent diagenesis. Igneous materials typically have magnetic susceptibility a couple of orders of magnitude greater than their alteratio n products, such as clay.  

The measurements were made using a Bartington MS2C loo p sensor with a $9~\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter. An oscillator circuit in the sensor, which operates at a frequency of $0.565\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and an AF of ${\sim}140\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m},$ produces a low-intensity, nonsaturating alternating magnetic field. Sediment or hard rock core sections passing through the influenc e of this field cause a change in oscillator frequency. Frequency information returned in pulse form to the susceptibility meter is converted into magnetic susceptibility. The loop sensor has a spatial resolution of $23{-}27\;\mathrm{mm}$ , and it is accurate to within $2\%$ .  

# P-wave velocity  

$P$ -wave velocity data can be used to evaluate small-strain moduli, correlate downhole logging and core data, and evaluate porosit y and cementation. $P_{\|}$ -wave (compressional) velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is defined b y the time required for a compressional wave to travel a specific distance:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is th e traveltime through the core.  

The PWL measures the traveltime of $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasonic wave s horizontally across the core at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals while it remains in th e core liner. Waves are transmitted to the core by plastic transduce r contacts connected to linear actuators. Pressure is applied to the actuators to ensure coupling between the transducers and the cor e liner. $P$ -wave velocity transducers measure total traveltime of th e compressional wave between transducers. The wave travels horizontally across the whole core and core liner. The total observe d traveltime, $t_{\mathrm{core}},$ is composed of  

$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry,   
$t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure,   
$t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner, and   
$t_{\mathrm{core}}=$ traveltime through the sediment.  

The system is calibrated using a core liner filled with distille d water, which provides control for $t_{\mathrm{delay}},t_{\mathrm{pulse}},$ and $t_{\mathrm{liner}}$ . From these calibrations, $V_{\mathrm{P}}$ can be calculated for the whole-round specimens i n core liners as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{cl}}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{\mathrm{o}}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{cl}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner, $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness, and $t_{\mathrm{o}}=$ measured total traveltime.  

The above equation assumes that the core completely fills th e core liner. The PWL of the WRMSL was turned off for cores recovered with the XCB and RCB systems, which often do not fill the cor e liner.  

# Natural Gamma Radiation Logger measurements  

Gamma radiation is emitted from the decay of mineral-hoste d $^{238}\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ . The NGRL measures this natural emission o n whole-round cores using a system designed and built at the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program US Implementing Organizatio n (USIO) (Texas A&M University) (Vasiliev et al., 2011; Dunlea et al., 2013) (Figure F26). When $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotopes decay, they and their daughter products emit gamma radiation at specifi c energy levels unique to each isotope. NGR spectroscopy measures  a wide energy spectrum that can be used to estimate the abundanc e of each isotope based on the strength of the signal at characteristi c energies (Blum, 1997; Gilmore, 2008). Spectral data were collecte d and can be used for postcruise processing for U, Th, and K abundance. We estimated concentrations of K, U, and Th using NGR an d  

Figure F26. NGRL for whole-round cores (conducts 8 measurements at a time in 2 positions, resulting in 16 measurements per core), Expedition 367 and 368. During Expedition 367, scintillation Detector 7 was deficient, so only 14 measurements per core were performed.  

![](images/2e23752da678c01faefe95158463d6afe1787c06b4734766c86e5443fe5cc282.jpg)  

bulk density measurements (see Figure F26), based on a study and Matlab scripts from De Vleeschouwer et al. (2017). High total counts usually identify fine-grained deposits containing K-rich clay minerals and their absorbed U and Th isotopes. NGR data thus reveal stratigraphic details that aid in core-to-core correlations. The system was initially installed on the renovated JOIDES Resolution in 2009 and has been used during every Integrated Ocean Drilling Program USIO and IODP JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) expedition starting with Expedition 320. The main NGR detector unit consists of 8 sodium iodide (NaI) detectors arranged along the core measurement axis at $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals surrounding the lower half of the section (Figure F27). During Expedition 367, scintillation Detector 7 was deficient, which led to a small gap in the measurements. Before Expedition 368, the deficient scintillation detector was fixed by the IODP technicians, and all detectors performed well during Expedition 368. The detector array has passive (layers of lead) and active (plastic scintillometers) shielding to reduce the background environmental and cosmic radiation. The overlying  plastic  scintillometers  detect  incoming  high-energy gamma and muon cosmic radiation and cancel this signal from the total counted by the NaI detectors.  

A measurement run consisted of two sample positions, $10~\mathrm{{cm}}$ apart, for a total of 16 (14 during Expedition 367) measurements per $150\,\mathrm{cm}$ section. During Expedition 367, measurements at distances of 20 and $30\,\mathrm{cm}$ in each section have no measured values because of the scintillation detector failure. The quality of the energy spectrum measured in a core depends on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample but also on the counting time, with higher times yielding better spectra. Counting times were chosen as $5\;\mathrm{min}$ per position, or ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{min}$ per core, yielding statistically significant energy spectra (Vasiliev et al., 2011).  

# Thermal conductivity measurements  

After NGR measurements were completed, thermal conductivity was measured with the TK-04 (Teka Bolin) system using a needle-probe method in full-space configuration for whole-round sediment cores (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959) or a contact-probe method in half-space configuration on split cores for hard rock. The probes contain a heater wire and calibrated thermistor.  

Figure F27. NGRL detectors (from Vasiliev et al., 2011), Expeditions 367 and 368. The main NGR scintillation detector unit consists of 8 sodium iodide (NaI) scintillometers arranged along core measurement axis at $20\;\mathsf{c m}$ intervals surrounding the lower half of the core section.  

![](images/2b8fb6a0726030a01c717dc03230dc0878231eee8663478b0eae1f56e4689c9d.jpg)  

For soft sediment, the needle probe was inserted into a $2~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter hole drilled through the liner along one of the lines that later guided core splitting. To avoid interference from air flow in the laboratory, the core was placed into an enclosed box outfitted with foam.  

For hard rock cores, samples were selected from the working half and returned unaltered to the core liner upon completion of the measurements. The contact probe embedded in the surface of an epoxy block with a low thermal conductivity (Vacquier, 1985) was maintained in contact with the sample. For igneous rock pieces, both rock and probe were equilibrated together in a bath of seawater at room temperature in a cooler insulated with extruded polystyrene foam. The calibrated heat source of the probe was then turned on, and the increase in temperature was recorded over $^{80\,\mathrm{s}}$ . A heating power of 1.5 to $1.8\ \mathrm{W/m}$ was typically used in soft sediment and for indurated material. In cases when this heating power did not lead to reliable measurements, we used a higher value, up to $2.0\:\mathrm{W/m}$ . The solution to the heat conduction equation with a line source of heat was then fit to the temperature measurements to obtain the thermal conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductive than sediment or hard rock, the probe is assumed to be a perfect conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of the superconductive probe has a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of the time after the initiation of the heat:  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (s), and   
$C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three measuring cycles were automatically performed to calculate average conductivity. A self-test, which included a drift study, was conducted at the beginning of each measurement cycle. Once the probe temperature stabilized, the heater circuit was closed and the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity was calculated from the rate of temperature rise while the heater current was flowing. Temperatures measured during the first 80 s of the heating cycle were fitted to an approximate solution of a constantly heated line source (for details, see Kristiansen, 1982; Blum, 1997). Measurement errors were $5\%{-}10\%$ . Thermal conductivit y measurements were routinely taken in one section per core (usuall y the third section of each core). Some cores retrieved by the XC B system did not yield results for thermal conductivity because crack s in the hard sediment caused bad coupling of the probe to the sediment.  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

We measured color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility o n archive section halves using the SHMSL. The archive half of th e split core was placed on the core holder, above which an electroni c platform moves along a track, recording the height of the split-cor e surface with a laser sensor. The laser establishes the location of th e bottom of the section, and then the platform reverses the directio n of movement, moving from bottom to top making measurements o f point magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance. All foam insert s were removed from the section-half cores before measurement, s o the measured range of values represents that of the core materia l only. During Expeditions 367 and 368, point magnetic susceptibilit y and color reflectance data were collected at constant intervals fo r each core but varied between 0.5 and $2.0\;\mathrm{cm}$ for different cores, depending on the available time for processing and the type of roc k recovered. These measurements have a sufficient resolution fo r comparing with the results obtained from the magnetic susceptibility loop of the WRMSL.  

# Color reflectance spectrometry  

The color reflectance spectrometer uses an Ocean Optics 3 0 mm integrating sphere and both halogen and LED light sources, which cover wavelengths from ultraviolet through visible to near infrared. The measurements were taken from 380 to $900\ \mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths at $2\,\textrm{n m}$ intervals. The approximate 3 s data acquisitio n offset was applied for the entire scan of the archive section half. Th e data are reported using the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathrm{a}^{\ast}\mathrm{b}^{\ast}$ color system, in which $L^{\ast}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is redness (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ i s yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative) of the rock. Th e color reflectance spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure whit e (reference) and pure black (dark). Color calibration was conducte d automatically approximately once every $^{6\,\mathrm{h}}$ (twice per shift).  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

Point magnetic susceptibility was measured with a Bartingto n MS2 meter and an MS2K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diamete r round sensor with a field of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and an operatio n frequency of $930\,\mathrm{Hz}$ . The instrument averages three measurement s from the sensor for each offset, leading to an accuracy of ${\sim}5\%$ . Th e spatial resolution of the point magnetic susceptibility instrument i s ${\sim}3.8\;\mathrm{mm}$ , higher than that of the whole-round magnetic susceptibility $(23{-}27\ \mathrm{mm})$ , making it especially useful for sections containin g broken pieces ${<}4\ \mathrm{cm}$ in length. As with whole-round measurements, the output displayed by the point magnetic susceptibilit y sensor must be converted to dimensionless SI units by multiplyin g by $10^{-5}$ . The probe is zeroed in air before each measurement location to avoid influence from the metal track. The point magneti c susceptibility meter was calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on the ship and is quality checked every ${\sim}6\,\mathrm{h}$ at the sam e time as color reflectance sensor calibration.

# Section Half Measurement Gantry measurements  

For soft-sediment cores, $P.$ -wave velocity measurements wer e performed on the working half of split cores before any sample s were taken. $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurements used the $_{\mathscr{x}}$ -axis calipe r and $z$ -axis bayonet contact probe transducers on the Section Hal f Measurement Gantry (SHMG) (Figure F28) with one analysis completed every other section. Measurements were usually taken at ${\sim}75$ cm in the section; however, if this interval lacked good sediment/transducer coupling (e.g., caused by high amounts of sand o r cracks), different positions were chosen to generate viable data. Cores drilled with the XCB sometimes did not provide usable dat a because of bad sediment/liner contact and disturbed sediment. Fo r hard rock cores, $P_{-}$ -wave velocity was measured on the discrete samples chosen for both physical property and paleomagnetic measurements.  

# P-wave velocity  

The $P$ -wave velocity system uses Panametrics-NDT Microsca n delay line transducers, which transmit at $0.5~\mathrm{MHz}$ . The signal received through the section half or the discrete sample was recorde d by the computer attached to the system, with the peak ( $P$ -wave arrival) usually chosen by autopicking software. In case of a weak signal, the first arrival was manually picked. The distance betwee n transducers was measured with a built-in linear voltage displacement transformer. Calibration was performed with a series o f acrylic cylinders of differing thicknesses and a known $P$ -wave velocity of $2750\pm20\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ . The determined system time delay from calibration was subtracted from the picked arrival time to give  a traveltime of the $P$ -wave through the sample. The thickness of th e sample (calculated by the linear voltage displacement transformer, in meters) was divided by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P$ - wave velocity in meters per second.  

# Discrete sample MAD measurements  

Discrete samples were collected from the working halves to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, an d porosity. In soft sediment, samples of ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ volume were collected with a plastic syringe, the diameter of which fits that of th e glass vials. We sampled every other section of core (usually Section s 1, 3, and 5). In indurated sediment and hard rock, minicores o r pieces were extracted from the working halves for physical propert y measurements. Samples from igneous basement were shared fo r paleomagnetic measurements.  

# Sample preparation  

Soft-sediment samples were placed in numbered, preweighe d ${\sim}16~\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment weighing, drying, and dry volume measurements. Determination of an accurate wet mass of the minicore samples of indurated sediment an d hard rock first required that the pore space of the samples be completely saturated with seawater. To do this, we placed the samples i n individual plastic vials filled with seawater and used a vacuu m chamber. A vacuum pump removed the air from the chamber to  a pressure of ${\sim}40{-}50\ \mathrm{kPa}$ below the atmospheric pressure, forcin g seawater into the samples. The samples were kept under saturatio n for at least $24~\mathrm{h},$ with the vacuum maintained in the chamber b y turning the pump on for $30\;\mathrm{min}$ every $^{5\,\mathrm{h}}$ . After removal from th e saturator, the minicores were patted dry with a paper towel, and we t mass was immediately determined using the dual balance system. $P_{-}$ - wave velocities were then measured on the wet samples. Followin g the velocity measurements, the samples were dried in a convectio n oven for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $105^{\circ}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ . Dried samples were then coole d in a desiccator for at least $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ before the dry mass and the volum e were measured.  

# Dual balance mass measurement  

The weights of wet and dry sample masses were determined to  a precision of $0.005\ \mathrm{g}$ using two Mettler Toledo electronic balances, with one acting as a reference. A standard weight of similar value t o the sample was placed upon the reference balance to increase accuracy. A computer averaging system was used to compensate for th e ship’s motion. The default setting of the balances is 300 measurements (taking ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{min}$ ).  

# Pycnometer volume measurement  

Dry sample volume was determined using a hexapycnomete r system of a six-celled, custom-configured Micrometrics AccuPy c 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer (Figure F29). The precision of each cell is $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. Volume measurement was preceded by three purges of the sample chamber wit h helium warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run fo r each sample. A reference volume (a set of two calibration spheres ) was placed sequentially in one of the chambers to check for instrument drift and systematic error. The volumes occupied by the numbered  Wheaton  vials  were  calculated  before  the  cruise  b y multiplying each vial’s weight against the average density of the via l glass. The procedures for the determination of these physical properties comply with the American Society for Testing and Material s (ASTM) designation (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). Th e fundamental relation and assumptions for the calculations of al l physical property parameters are discussed by Blum (1997) an d summarized below.  

# Mass and volume calculation  

We measured wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $\mathbf{\,(}M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volum e $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ . The ratio of mass $\left(\mathrm{rm}\right)$ is a computational constant of 0.96 5 (i.e., $0.965\mathrm{~g~}$ of freshwater per $1\ \mathrm{g}$ of seawater). Salt precipitated i n

sediment pores during the drying process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and sal t $(M_{\mathrm{salt}})$ in the sample are given by  

$$

$$  

where $_s$ is the assumed saltwater salinity $(0.035\%)$ corresponding t o a pore water density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}}\right)$ of $1.024\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $(\boldsymbol\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}})$ o f $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of por e water $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of sal t $\left(V_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\mathrm{[}V_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},\ }\\ {V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\rho_{\mathrm{pw}},\ }\\ {M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},\ }\\ {M_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}-(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}}),\ }\\ {V_{\mathrm{solit}}=M_{\mathrm{solit}}/\rho_{\mathrm{solit}},}\end{array}
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

# Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\left(w\right)$ is expressed as th e ratio of mass of pore water to wet sediment (total) mass:  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}})$ , dry bulk density $\mathbf{\rho}(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grai n density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio $(V R)$ are calculated as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{met}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{pdry}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ &{\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathrm{{solid}}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\end{array}
$$  

MAD properties reported and plotted in the Physical propertie s sections of all site chapters were calculated with the MADMax shipboard program set with the “method $C^{\prime\prime}$ calculation process.  

# Downhole measurements  

Downhole logs are used to determine physical, chemical, an d structural properties of the formation penetrated by a borehole. Th e data are rapidly collected, continuous with depth, and measured i n situ; they can be interpreted in terms of the stratigraphy, lithology, mineralogy, magnetic characteristics, and geochemical compositio n of the penetrated formation. Where core recovery is incomplete o r disturbed, log data may provide the only way to characterize th e borehole section. Where core recovery is good, log and core dat a complement one another and may be interpreted jointly.  

Downhole logs measure formation properties on a scale that i s intermediate between those obtained from laboratory measurements on core samples and those from geophysical surveys. The y are useful in calibrating the interpretation of geophysical surve y data (e.g., through the use of synthetic seismograms) and provide  a necessary link for the integrated understanding of physical an d chemical properties on different scales.  

During Expeditions 367 and 368, downhole wireline log dat a was collected at Sites U1499–U1501, and U1503. In addition, a tota l of 14 downhole temperature measurements were acquired using th e APCT-3 in Holes U1499A (6), U1501C (4), and U1505C (4).  

# Wireline logging  

During wireline logging operations, logs were recorded wit h Schlumberger logging tools combined into several tool strings tha t were lowered into the hole after completion of coring operations. Three standard IODP tool string configurations were used durin g Expeditions 367 and 368 (Figure F30; Table T8). The first was  a variant of the triple combo tool string, which measures borehol e fluid temperature, NGR, porosity, density, electrical resistivity, an d magnetic susceptibility. The second was the FMS-sonic tool string, which measures NGR, sonic velocity, and FMS resistivity images o f the borehole wall. The third was the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI ) tool string, which measures a vertical seismic profile in order to integrate well and seismic data. Each tool string also contains an Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC) for communicatin g through the wireline to the Schlumberger data acquisition syste m (i.e., multitasking acquisition and imaging system [MAXIS]) on th e drillship. See the site chapters for detailed lists of which tools wer e run in which combinations in each hole.  

In preparation for logging, the boreholes were reamed in thei r lower sections, flushed of debris by circulating drilling fluid, an d filled with seawater-based logging gel (i.e., sepiolite mud mixed wit h seawater and weighted with barite; approximate density $=~10.5$ $1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{gal})$ to help stabilize the borehole walls in sections where instability would be expected based on drilling and coring results. Th e  

BHA was pulled up to a logging depth determined by the borehol e conditions. Although log data can be collected while lowering th e tool string to the bottom of the hole, the primary data set is collected while raising the tool strings upward at a constant speed, typically ${\sim}300~\mathrm{m/h}$ for the triple combo and $600~\mathrm{m/h}$ for the FMSsonic.  

Each tool string deployment is termed a logging “run.” Durin g each run, tool strings can be lowered and pulled up in the hole several times to check repeatability and increase coverage of the FM S borehole images. Each lowering or hauling-up of the tool strin g while collecting data constitutes a “pass.” Incoming data were recorded and monitored in real time on the Schlumberger Minimu m Configuration MAXIS logging computer. A wireline heave compensator (WHC) was typically used to minimize the effect of ship’ s heave on the tool position in the borehole (see below).  

# Logged sediment properties and tool measurement principles  

The logged properties and the principles used with the tool s that measure them are briefly described below. The main tools ar e listed in Tables T8 and T9. More detailed information on individual tools and their geological applications may be found in Serr a (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989, 1994), Rider (1996), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), and Ellis and Singer (2007).  A complete list of acronyms for the Schlumberger tools and measurement curves is available at http://www.apps.slb.com/cmd.

# Natural gamma radiation  

The Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS ) was used on both the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings t o measure NGR in the formation. The HNGS uses two bismuth germanate scintillation detectors and five-window spectroscopy to determine concentrations of potassium (in weight percent), thoriu m (in parts per million), and uranium (in parts per million) from th e characteristic gamma ray energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ , an d $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series, which dominate the natural radiatio n spectrum. The computation of the elemental abundances uses  a least-squares method of extracting U, Th, and K elemental concentrations from the spectral measurements. The HNGS filters ou t gamma ray energies below $500\;\mathrm{keV},$ eliminating sensitivity to bentonite or KCl in the drilling mud and improving measurement accuracy. The HNGS also provides a measure of the total spectral gamma ray (HSGR) and computed gamma ray (HCGR) that ar e measured in American Petroleum Institute gamma radiation unit s (gAPI). The HNGS response is influenced by the borehole diameter; therefore, the HNGS data are corrected for borehole diameter variations during acquisition.  

An additional NGR sensor was housed in the EDTC to communicate data to the surface. The sensor includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector that also measures the total NGR emission of th e formation. It is not a spectral tool (i.e., it does not provide U, Th , and K concentrations), but it provides total gamma radiation fo r each pass.  

The inclusion of the HNGS in every tool string allows use of th e gamma ray data for precise depth match processing between logging strings and passes and for core-log integration.

# Density and photoelectric factor  

Formation density was measured with the Hostile Environmen t Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS). The sonde contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source $(622\;\mathrm{keV})$ and far and near gamm a ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid that is pressed against th e borehole wall by a hydraulically activated decentralizing arm. Gamma radiation emitted by the source undergoes Compton scattering, in which gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. The number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detector s is proportional to the density of electrons in the formation, which i s in turn related to bulk density. Porosity may also be derived fro m this bulk density if the matrix (grain) density is known.  

The HLDS also measures the photoelectric effect factor (PEF),  a measure of the photoelectric absorption of low-energy gamma radiation. Photoelectric absorption occurs when the energy of th e gamma rays falls below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of being repeatedly scattered by electrons in the formation. PEF is determined by comparing the counts from the far detector in the high-energy region, where only Compton scattering occurs, to those in the low-energ y region, where count rates depend on both reactions. Because PE F depends on the atomic number of the elements in the formatio n (heavier elements have higher PEF), it also varies according to th e chemical composition of the minerals present and can be used fo r the identification of the overall mineral makeup of the formation. For example, the PEF of calcite is $5.08\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , illite is $3.03\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , quartz is $1.81\,\mathrm{barn}/\mathrm{e}^{-};$ , and hematite is $21\,\mathrm{barn}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ . Good contact between the tool and the borehole wall is essential for good HLD S logs; poor contact results in underestimation of density values. Bot h the density correction and caliper measurement of the hole are use d to check the contact quality. In the deeper parts of the hole, the PE F log should be used with caution, especially in washouts, becaus e barium in the logging mud swamps the signal despite correction fo r mud effect.

# Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) provides six resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation (including the borehole or mud resistivity and five measurements o f formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation). The tool sends a focused current into the formation and measures the intensity necessary to maintain a constant drop in voltag e across a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurements. The array has one central (source) electrode and six electrode s above and below it, which serve alternatively as focusing and returning current electrodes. By rapidly changing the role of thes e electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths is achieved. The tool is designed to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the same time and tool position and t o reduce the sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects when crossing shar p beds thinner than the electrode spacing. The design of the HRLA, which eliminates the need for a surface reference electrode, improves formation resistivity evaluation compared to traditional dua l induction and allows the full range of resistivity to be measure d from low (e.g., in high-porosity sediments) to high (e.g., in basalt). The HRLA needs to be run centralized in the borehole for optima l results, so knuckle joints were used to centralize the HRLA whil e allowing the density and porosity tools to maintain good contac t with the borehole wall (Figure F30).  

Calcite,  silica,  and  hydrocarbons  are  electrical  insulators, whereas ionic solutions like interstitial water are conductors. Electrical resistivity, therefore, can be used to evaluate porosity for  a given salinity and resistivity of the interstitial water. Clay surfac e conduction also contributes to the resistivity values, but at high porosities, this effect is relatively minor.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The Dipole Shear Sonic Imager (DSI) measures the transit time s between sonic transmitters and an array of eight receivers. It combines replicate measurements, thus providing a direct measuremen t of sound velocity through formations that is relatively free from th e effects of formation damage and an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989). Along with the monopole transmitters found on mos t sonic tools, it also has two crossed-dipole transmitters that allo w the measurement of shear wave velocity in addition to compressional wave velocity. Dipole measurements are necessary to measure shear velocities in slow formations with shear velocity less tha n the velocity of sound in the borehole fluid. Such slow formations ar e typically encountered in deep-ocean drilling.  

# Formation MicroScanner  

The FMS provides high-resolution electrical resistivity–base d images of borehole walls. The tool has four orthogonal arms an d pads, each containing 16 button electrodes that are pressed agains t the borehole wall during logging (Figure F30). The electrodes ar e arranged in two diagonally offset rows of 8 electrodes each. A focused current is emitted from the button electrodes into the formation, with a return electrode near the top of the tool. Resistivity o f the formation at the button electrodes is derived from the intensit y of current passing through the button electrodes.  

Processing transforms the resistivity measurements into oriented high-resolution images that reveal geologic structures of th e borehole wall. Features such as bedding, stratification, fracturing, slump folding, and bioturbation can be resolved (Luthi, 1990; Salimullah and Stow, 1992; Lovell et al., 1998). Because the images are oriented to magnetic north, further analysis can provide measuremen t of the dip and direction (azimuth) of planar features in the formation. In addition, when the corresponding planar features can b e identified in the recovered core samples, individual core pieces ca n be reoriented with respect to true north.  

Approximately $30\%$ of a borehole with a diameter of $25\;\mathrm{cm}$ $(9\%$ inches) is imaged during a single pass. Standard procedure is t o make two full upward passes with the FMS to maximize the chanc e of getting full borehole coverage with the pads. The maximum extension of the caliper arms is $40.6~\mathrm{{cm}}$ (16 inches). In holes with  a diameter greater than this maximum, the pad contact at the end o f the caliper arms is inconsistent, and the FMS images may appea r out of focus and too conductive. Irregular (rough) borehole wall s will also adversely affect the images if contact with the wall is poor.  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

The magnetic susceptibility sonde (MSS) is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observator y (LDEO). It measures the ease with which formations are magnetized when subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetizatio n is ultimately related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magnetic minerals (principally magnetite) in the formation. These measurements provide one of the bes t methods for investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy an d lithology because the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructive and because different lithologies often have strongly contrasting susceptibilities.  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{cm}$ resolution measurements, with ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ depth of horizontal investigation. The MSS wa s run as the lowermost tool in the triple combo tool string using  a specially developed data translation cartridge to enable the MSS t o be run in combination with the Schlumberger tools. The MSS als o has an optional single-coil sensor to provide high-resolution measurements $({\sim}10~\mathrm{cm})$ , but this sensor was not used during Expeditions 367 and 368 because it has a large bowspring that requires th e MSS to be run higher up in the tool string and because it is ver y sensitive to separation from the borehole wall.  

Magnetic susceptibility data from both the high-resolution an d deep-reading sensors are plotted as uncalibrated units. The MS S reading responses are affected by temperature and borehole siz e (higher temperatures lead to higher susceptibility measurements). Preliminary processing was performed offshore to remove the temperature drift by calculating a least-squares polynomial fit to th e data and subtracting the calculated trend from the data set. Whe n the magnetic susceptibility signal in sediment is very low, the detection limits of the tool may be reached. For quality control and environmental  correction,  the  MSS  also  measures  internal  tool temperature, $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axis acceleration, and low-resolution borehole conductivity.  

# Acceleration and inclinometry  

The General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT) was included i n the FMS-sonic tool string to calculate tool acceleration and orientation during logging. Tool orientation is defined by three parameters: tool deviation, tool azimuth, and relative bearing. The GPIT utilize s a three-axis inclinometer and a three-axis fluxgate magnetomete r to record the orientation of the FMS as the magnetometer record s the magnetic field components $(\mathrm{F}x,\,\mathrm{F}y_{:}$ , and $\mathrm{F}z$ ). Thus, the FMS images can be corrected for irregular tool motion, and the dip and direction (azimuth) of features in the FMS image can be determined.  

# Versatile Seismic Imager  

Borehole seismic tools are used in wells to detect the acousti c signal generated at the surface. The VSI is used to determine th e time–depth relation and to produce a zero-offset vertical seismi c profile and/or check shots in the borehole. The VSI (Figure F30 ) uses three-axis single sensor seismic hardware and software and advanced wireline telemetry for efficient data delivery from the borehole to the surface. Each sensor package delivers high-fidelity wav e fields through the use of a three-axis geophone accelerometer that i s acoustically isolated from the main body of the tool (Figure F30). The geophone accelerometer detects particle motion and provides  a linear and flat response from 3 to $200\;\mathrm{Hz}$ . The VSI maximal operational temperature is $177^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , or $350^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$  

During Expeditions 367 and 368, the VSI was anchored agains t the borehole wall or the casing at ${\sim}50\,\mathrm{m}$ intervals, and 5–10 recordings were typically taken at each station. The recorded waveform s were stacked, and a one-way traveltime was determined from th e first breaks for each station. The seismic source was a Sercel G-gu n parallel cluster composed of two $250~\mathrm{inch^{3}}$ air guns separated by  1 m. It was positioned by one of the ship cranes off the port side of th e ship at a total horizontal offset of ${\sim}30\mathrm{~m~}$ from the top of the wellhead and was maintained at a fixed water depth (typically between  2 and $7\,\textrm{m}$ ; see Figure F50 in the Site U1500 chapter [Stock et al. , 2018]).  

# Log data quality  

The main influence on log data quality is the condition of th e borehole wall. Where the borehole diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts of softer material or ledges of harder material, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehol e wall (i.e., FMS, density, and porosity) may be degraded. Deep investigation measurements such as gamma radiation, resistivity, an d sonic velocity, which do not require contact with the borehole wall, are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions. “Bridged” sections, where borehole diameter is much below the bit size, als o cause irregular log results. The quality of the borehole is improve d by minimizing the circulation of drilling fluid while drilling, flushing the borehole to remove debris, and logging as soon as possibl e after drilling and conditioning are completed. During Expedition s 367 and 368, the necessity of flushing loose material from sandy formations up and out of the borehole required heavy circulation.  

The quality of the wireline depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determine d from the length of the cable payed out from the winch on the ship. The seafloor is identified on the NGR log by the abrupt reduction i n gamma ray count at the water/sediment interface (mudline). Discrepancies between the drilling depth and the wireline log dept h may occur. In the case of drilling depth, discrepancies are due t o core expansion, incomplete core recovery, or incomplete heav e compensation. In the case of log depth, discrepancies between successive runs occur because of incomplete heave compensation, incomplete correction for cable stretch, and cable slip. Tidal change s in sea level affect both drilling and logging depths, although thes e were $<\!1\;\mathrm{m}$ in the South China Sea.  

# Wireline heave compensator  

During wireline logging operations, the up-and-down motion o f the ship (heave) causes a similar motion of the downhole loggin g tools. If the amplitude of this motion is large, depth discrepancie s can be introduced into the logging data. The risk of damagin g downhole instruments is also increased. A WHC system was thu s designed to compensate for the vertical motion of the ship an d maintain a steady motion of the logging tools to ensure high-qualit y logging data acquisition (Liu et al., 2013; Iturrino et al., 2013). Th e WHC uses a vertical accelerometer (motion reference unit [MRU] ) positioned under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertical motion of the ship with respect to the seafloor. I t then adjusts the length of the wireline by varying the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes in order t o minimize downhole tool motion. Real-time measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleration are made simultaneousl y by the MRU and the EDTC, respectively. An LDEO-developed software package allows these data to be analyzed and compared in real time, displaying the actual motion of the logging tool string and enabling monitoring of the efficiency of the compensator.  

# Logging data flow and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real tim e and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. Initial logging data were referenced to the rig floor (wireline depth belo w rig floor [WRF]). After logging was completed, the data were shifte d to a seafloor reference (WSF) that is based on the step in gamm a radiation at the sediment/water interface.  

Data were transferred onshore to LDEO, where standardize d data processing takes place. The main part of the processing i s depth matching to remove depth offsets between logs from different logging runs, which results in a new depth scale: wireline lo g matched depth below seafloor (WMSF). Also, corrections are mad e to certain tools and logs (e.g., FMS imagery is corrected for tool acceleration, including “stick and slip”), documentation for the log s (with an assessment of log quality) is prepared, and the data are converted to ASCII for the conventional logs and GIF for the FMS images. The Schlumberger Geo-Quest GeoFrame software package i s used for most of the processing of the collected wireline loggin g data. The data were transferred back to the ship within a few day s after logging, and this processed data set was made available to th e science party (in ASCII and DLIS formats) through the shipboar d IODP logging database and shipboard servers.  

# In situ temperature measurements and heat flow calculation  

During Expeditions 367 and 368, in situ temperature measurements were made with the APCT-3 (Figure F31) at each site whe n the APC was deployed. The APCT-3 fits directly into the corin g shoe of the APC and consists of a battery pack, data logger, and platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over a temperatur e range from $0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Before entering the borehole, the tool is firs t stopped at the mudline for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ to thermally equilibrate with bottom water. However, the lowest temperature recorded during th e run is occasionally used instead of the average temperature at th e mudline as an estimate of the bottom water temperature becaus e (1)  it is more repeatable and (2) the bottom water is expected t o have the lowest temperature in the profile. When the APC i s plunged into the formation, there is an instantaneous temperatur e rise from frictional heating. This heat gradually dissipates into th e surrounding sediment as the temperature at the APCT-3 equilibrates toward the temperature of the sediment. After the APC penetrates the sediment, it is held in place for $5\;\mathrm{min}$ while the APCT- 3 records the temperature of the cutting shoe every second.  

![](images/903203a651fe3752529d1613ba1a27d727d9031734caf78da3c83a254f0a6581.jpg)

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment is estimated b y applying a mathematical heat-conduction model to the temperatur e decay record (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The synthetic therma l decay curve for the APCT-3 is a function of the geometry and thermal properties of the probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Hora i and Von Herzen, 1985). Equilibrium temperature is estimated b y applying a fitting procedure (Pribnow et al., 2000). However, wher e the APC does not achieve a full stroke or where ship heave pulls th e APC up from full penetration, the temperature equilibration curv e is disturbed and temperature determination is less accurate. Th e nominal accuracy of the APCT-3 temperature measurements i s $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

APCT-3 temperature data is combined with thermal conductivity measurements obtained from whole-round core sections to retrieve heat flow values. Heat flow and geothermal gradient ar e calculated according to the Bullard (1939) method to be consisten t with the synthesis of ODP heat flow data by Pribnow et al. (2000). This method assumes a linear relation between temperature $T$ an d thermal resistance of the sediments:  

$$
T(z)=T_{0}+Q\times\Omega(z),
$$  

# where  

$T\!=$ temperature,   
$z=$ depth,   
$T_{0}=$ surface temperature $(z=0)$ ),   
$Q=$ is heat flow, and   
$\Omega(z)=$ thermal resistance, expressed as  

$$
\Omega(z)=\int_{0}^{z}\{d z/[\lambda(z)]\}\approx\sum_{\mathrm{i}\;=1}^{I}[(z_{\mathrm{i}}-z_{\mathrm{i}-1})/\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}],
$$  

with $z_{\mathrm{i}}$ and $z_{\mathrm{i}-1}$ as bottom and top depths, respectively, of a horizontal layer with thermal conductivity $\lambda_{\mathrm{i}}$ . $I$ is the number of layers between the surface and depth $z$ .  

Plotting $\Omega(z)$ as a function of $T(\mathbf{z})$ , the Bullard plot allows estimation of the surface temperature $(T_{0})$ from the intercept with $z=0$ and of the heat flow (Q) from the slope. The conditions for the linearity of the plot are affected by conductive conditions, steady state, and absence of internal heat source.  

To obtain the thermal conductivity at the depth of the temperature measurements, we estimated a continuous profile of $\lambda(z).$ , assuming that there is a linear variation of thermal conductivity wit h depth (Pribnow et al., 2000):  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\lambda_{\lfloor\lceil N}(z)=\lambda_{0}+\Gamma\times z.}\end{array}
$$  

The linear trend was confirmed at each site. The thermal resistance $\Omega_{\mathsf{L I N,j}}$ for the depth $z_{\mathrm{{T},j}}$ of the jth temperature value $T_{\mathrm{j}}$ was calculated using the results of the linear regression, $\uplambda_{0}$ and $\Gamma$ (slope) with  

$$
\Omega_{\mathsf{L}|\mathsf{N},\mathrm{j}}=[\ln(\uplambda_{0}+\Gamma\times z_{\mathsf{T},\mathrm{j}})-\ln(\uplambda_{0})]/\Gamma,
$$  

which allows the calculation of the heat flow.  

# Correlation to seismic data  

The  Chinese  National  Offshore  Oil  and  Gas  Compan y (CNOOC) holds an extensive database of 2-D and 3-D reflectio n seismic data covering the northern South China Sea margin. Interpretations of these data by CNOOC allow a suite of regional seismi c unconformities to be identified. These are named by CNOOC wit h the capital letter T followed by a number (e.g., T30, T50, etc.). Th e ages of these seismic stratigraphic unconformities are constraine d by industry wells located significantly landward of our study area.  

During this expedition, we tried to extend the regional seismi c unconformities mapped by CNOOC within the northern SCS continental slope (e.g., Dai et al., 2015) into our more southerly locate d study area of the slope and deep SCS basin. We applied the principl e of seismic stratigraphy established by Vail et al. (1977) in the mapping of these horizons. That is, each unconformity and its correlative conformity are determined by recognizing systematic reflectio n terminations (including onlap, downlap, truncation, etc.). We expect there to be ten horizons tied to the CNOOC scheme in ou r area (Table T10), although at some of our sites one or more of thes e could not be identified due to lack of age control and/or disruptio n by faulting. Following the seismic stratigraphic principle, these ca n all be considered time markers, but only where they have a true conformal relationship to strata above and below will they represent  a specific age. In all other settings, they represent a hiatus of a shorte r or longer time interval.  

We follow the convention established by CNOOC to name th e base of the Cenozoic sedimentary succession Reflector Tg. Thi s horizon is also often referred to as the “acoustic basement.” By thi s we mean a strong reflector that to a large but variable degree mask s the underlying reflectors and does not allow any regional seismi c stratigraphic mapping below it. Importantly, Tg is not a seismi c stratigraphically defined horizon, nor does it represent any particular age or lithology. In our study area, it can represent the top of anything  from  volcanic  basement  of  Neogene  age  to  Mesozoi c sediments or continental crystalline crust.
