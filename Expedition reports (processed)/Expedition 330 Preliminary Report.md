# Abstract  

The Louisville Seamount Trail is a $4300\,\mathrm{km}$ long volcanic chain that has been built in the past $80\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ as the Pacific plate moved over a persistent mantle melting anomaly or hotspot. Because of its linear morphology and its long-lived age-progressive volcanism, Louisville is the South Pacific counterpart of the much better studied HawaiianEmperor Seamount Trail. Together, Louisville and Hawaii are textbook examples of two primary hotspots that have been keystones in deciphering the motion of the Pacific plate relative to a set of “fixed” deep-mantle plumes. However, drilling during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 197 in the Emperor Seamounts documented a large $\mathrm{\sim}15^{\circ}$ southward motion of the Hawaiian hotspot prior to $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . Is it possible that the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots moved in concert and thus constitute a moving reference frame for modeling plate motion in the Pacific? Alternatively, could they have moved independently, as predicted by mantle flow models that reproduce the observed latitudinal motion for Hawaii but that predict a largely longitudinal shift for the Louisville hotspot? These two end-member geodynamic models were tested during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 330 to the Louisville Seamount Trail.  

In addition, existing data from dredged lavas suggest that the mantle plume source of the Louisville hotspot has been remarkably homogeneous for as long as 80 m.y. These lavas are predominantly alkali basalts and likely represent a mostly alkalic shieldbuilding stage, which is in sharp contrast to the massive tholeiitic shield-building stage of Hawaiian volcanoes. Geochemical and isotopic data for the recovered lavas during Expedition 330 will provide insights into the magmatic evolution and melting processes of individual Louisville volcanoes, their progression from shield-building to postshield and (maybe) posterosional stages, the temperature and depth of partial melting of their mantle plume source, and the enigmatic long-lived and apparent geochemical homogeneity of the Louisville mantle source. Collectively, this will enable us to characterize the Louisville Seamount Trail as a product of one of the few global primary hotspots, to better constrain its plume-lithosphere interactions, and to further test the hypothesis that the Ontong Java Plateau formed from the plume head of the Louisville mantle plume around $120\;\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

During Expedition 330 we replicated the drilling strategy of Leg 197, the first expedition to provide compelling evidence for the motion of the Hawaiian mantle plume between 80 and $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . For that reason we targeted Louisville seamounts that have ages similar to Detroit, Suiko, Nintoku, and Koko Seamounts in the Emperor Seamount Trail. In total, five seamounts were drilled in the Louisville Seamount Trail: Canopus, Rigil, Burton, Achernar, and Hadar Guyots (old to young). By analyzing a large number of time-independent in situ lava flows (and other volcanic eruptive products) from these seamounts using modern paleomagnetic, $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ geochronological, and geochemical techniques, we will be able to directly compare the paleolatitude estimates and geochemical signatures between the two longest-lived hotspot systems in the Pacific Ocean.  

We drilled into the summits of the five Louisville guyots and reached volcanic basement at four of these drilling targets. In two cases we targeted larger seamount structures and drilled near the flanks of these ancient volcanoes, and in the other three cases we selected smaller edifices that we drilled closer to their centers. Drilling and logging plans for each of these sites were similar, with coring reaching 522.0 meters below seafloor (mbsf) for Site U1374 and 232.9, 65.7, 11.5, 182.8, and 53.3 mbsf for Sites U1372, U1373, U1375, U1376, and U1377, respectively. Some Expedition 330 drill sites were capped with only a thin layer of pelagic ooze between 6.6 and $13.5\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, and, if present, these were cored by using a low-rotation gravity-push technique with the rotary core barrel to maximize recovery. However, at Sites U1373 and U1376 no pelagic ooze was present, and the holes needed to be started directly into cobble-rich hardgrounds. In all cases, the bulk of the seamount sediment cover comprised sequences of volcanic sandstones and various kinds of basalt breccia or basalt conglomerate, which often were interspersed with basaltic lava flows, the spatter/tephra products of submarine eruptions, or other volcanic products, including auto-brecciated flows or peperites. Also several intervals of carbonate were cored, with the special occurrence of a $\mathord{\sim}15\;\mathrm{m}$ thick algal limestone reef at Site U1376 on Burton Guyot. In addition, some condensed pelagic limestone units were recovered on three of the other seamounts, but these did not exceed $30\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ in thickness. Despite their limited presence in the drilled sediment, these limestones provide valuable insights for the paleoclimate record at high ${\sim}50^{\circ}$ southern latitudes since Mesozoic times.  

Several Louisville sites progressed from subaerial conditions in the top of volcanic basement into submarine eruptive environments, or drilling of the igneous basement immediately started in submarine volcanic sequences, as was the case for Sites U1376 and U1377 on Burton and Hadar Guyots. At three sites we cored ${>}100\;\mathrm{m}$ into the igneous basement: $187.3\;\mathrm{m}$ at Site U1372, $505.3\;\mathrm{m}$ at Site U1374, and $140.9\textrm{m}$ at Site U1376. At the other sites we did not core into basement (Site U1375) or we cored only $38.2\:\mathrm{m}$ (Site U1377) because of unstable hole conditions. Even so, drilling during Expedition 330 resulted in a large number of in situ lava flows, pillow basalts, or other types of volcanic products such as auto-brecciated lava flows, intrusive sheets or dikes, and peperites. In particular, the three holes on Canopus and Rigil Guyots (the two oldest seamounts drilled in the Louisville Seamount Trail), resulted in adequate numbers of in situ lava flows to average out paleosecular variation, with probable eruption ages estimated at $\mathord{\sim}78$ and $73\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively. Remarkably, at all drill sites large quantities of hyaloclastites, volcanic sandstones, and basaltic breccias were also recovered, which in many cases show consistent paleomagnetic inclinations compared to the lava flows bracketing these units. For Site U1374 on Rigil Guyot we also observed a magnetic polarity reversal in the cored sequence. Overall, this is very promising for determining a reliable paleolatitude record for the Louisville Seamounts following detailed postcruise examinations.  

The deeper penetrations of several hundred meters required bit changes and reentries using free-fall funnels. Basement penetration rates were $1.8{-}2.5\ \mathrm{m/h}$ depending on drill depth. In total, $1114\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and igneous basement at five seamounts was drilled, and $806\;\mathrm{m}$ was recovered (average recovery $=72.4\%$ ). At Site U1374 on Rigil Guyot, a total of $522\,\mathrm{m}$ was drilled, with a record-breaking $87.8\%$ recovery. Most outstandingly, nearly all Expedition 330 core material is characterized by low degrees of alteration, providing us with a large quantity of samples of mostly well-preserved basalt, containing, for example, pristine olivine crystals with melt inclusions, fresh volcanic glass, unaltered plagioclase, carbonate, zeolite and celadonite alteration minerals, various micro- and macrofossils, and, in one case, mantle xenoliths and xenocrysts. The large quantity and excellent quality of the recovered sample material allow us to address all the scientific objectives of this expedition and beyond.  

# Introduction and background  

Understanding the nature of mantle plumes is a critical goal of modern Earth sciences. The extent to which hotspots conform to the Wilson-Morgan fixed plume hypothesis (Wilson, 1963; Morgan, 1971) fundamentally constrains the assumptions used in models of mantle convection. To date, studies of the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Trail have dominated our thinking about hotspot volcanism, and, as a consequence, models for the construction and evolution of intraplate volcanoes, plate motion, and hotspot motion are strongly biased toward the Hawaiian hotspot. Without comparable data from any other important hotspot trail, many key questions remain unanswered. The Louisville hotspot trail (Fig. F1) is one of only three primary hotspots in the Pacific (together with Hawaii and Easter; Courtillot et al., 2003) and has great potential for providing these answers. New results from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) drilling of the Louisville Seamount Trail during Expedition 330, together with existing data and future drilling of other hotspot trails in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, will provide the best available opportunity to assess the importance of the motion between hotspots (or groups of hotspots) and true polar wander. These data, in turn, will provide some of the most valuable information on Earth’s convection regime and a crucial calibration of current mantle flow models and global plate circuit reconstructions.  

Hotspots and the (deep) mantle plumes that are presumed to be their underlying cause (e.g., Morgan, 1971) are essential features in contemporary geodynamic models of the Earth’s mantle. One of the attributes that frequently has been assigned to mantle plumes is their fixity in the mantle, which contrasts starkly with the overlying plates that move at rates of up to $100\,\mathrm{mm}/$ /y. However, plume theory does not demand fixity (e.g., Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998; Koppers et al., 2001), and paleomagnetic evidence collected during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 197 from four Emperor seamounts (Detroit, Suiko, Nintoku, and Koko) indicates that the Hawaiian hotspot has moved at a speed similar to that of plate motion for tens of millions of years (Kono, 1980; Petronotis et al., 1994; Tarduno et al., 2003, 2009; Duncan et al., 2006). Three-dimensional mantle convection computations confirm this notion by generating mantle plumes with long, narrow thermal conduits that are anchored (deep) in the mantle. Nevertheless, these computations show plume migration rates of $10\;\mathrm{mm/y}$ and higher, primarily depending on the assumed viscosity contrast between the lower and upper mantle and the configuration of the subducting plates (Lowman et al., 2004).  

These observations raise critical questions. Is the rapid motion documented for the Hawaiian hotspot an isolated event or does it happen to other hotspots as well? If so, do these hotspots move in a sufficiently coherent fashion that subsets can be used as a moving reference frame for reconstructing past plate motions? To address these questions we need to distinguish between the following geodynamic end-member models:  

1. The three primary hotspots in the Pacific (Hawaii, Louisville, and Easter) move coherently over geological time and thus show minimal interhotspot motion (Wessel and Kroenke, 1997; Courtillot et al., 2003).  

2. These primary hotspots show very different motions, resulting in increased interhotspot motions, as predicted by mantle flow model calculations (Steinberger,  

2002; Steinberger et al., 2004; Koppers et al., 2004; Steinberger and Antretter,   
2006; Steinberger and Calderwood, 2006).  

The first model predicts that the motion of the Louisville hotspot should be equivalent to the $15^{\circ}$ of southern motion documented for the Hawaiian hotspot between 80 and $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ . The second model predicts an essentially eastward motion for the Louisville hotspot over the last $120\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ ., with a maximum shift in paleolatitude not exceeding $6^{\circ}$ between 80 and $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and the present day, depending on various assumptions used in the mantle flow models (Fig. F2). Both models can be tested by drilling the Louisville Seamount Trail during Expedition 330 and accurately determining the paleolatitudes (from detailed paleomagnetic measurements on individual lava flows) and $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ age dates for four seamounts between 80 and $50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . For this purpose Expedition 330 provided a direct comparative test that mimics Leg 197 drilling in the Emperor Seamounts as closely as possible (Tarduno et al., 2003; Duncan and Keller, 2004; Duncan et al., 2006, 2007) by targeting guyots equivalent in age to Detroit $(76-81\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , Suiko $(61\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , Nintoku ( $56\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ), and Koko $\mathrm{49\Ma})$ ) (Fig. F1).  

Although determining the paleolatitudes in context of a high-resolution $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ age framework was the main objective of Expedition 330, this project also afforded the opportunity to constrain the eruptive cycle and geochemical evolution of typical Louisville volcanoes. The Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots have been labeled as primary hotspots in the Pacific on the basis of the presence of obvious linear age progressions, long-lived and continuous volcanism, large buoyancy fluxes, and high (in the case of Hawaii) $\mathrm{^3He}/\mathrm{^4He}$ ratios (Courtillot et al., 2003; Koppers et al., 2003). Such hotspots are theorized to represent the locales at which plumes are rising from deep in the mantle, perhaps from near the core/mantle boundary (Clouard and Bonneville, 2001; Davaille et al., 2002; Courtillot et al., 2003). Unlike earlier studies that postulated that many (or even all) hotspots represent plumes originating from the core/mantle boundary, Courtillot et al. (2003) have argued that most hotspots arise from relatively shallow levels and that only a small number of primary plumes ascend from the core/mantle boundary. Nonetheless, among the primary hotspots of the Pacific Ocean, some marked differences in geochemistry and volcanic evolution are apparent. For example, the almost exclusive recovery of alkali basalts in the Louisville Seamount Trail (Hawkins et al., 1987; Vanderkluysen et al., submitted) raises the question of whether Louisville volcanoes have an alkalic shield-building phase instead of the tholeiitic shield-building phase that is a trademark of Hawaiian volcanoes. One possibility is that the shield stage of a Louisville volcano reflects systematically lesser amounts of partial melting than in the Hawaiian case, caused by deeper melting under an always uniformly thicker lithosphere. In addition, isotopic and trace element data from Louisville suggest a long-lived and remarkably homogeneous mantle source (Cheng et al., 1987; Hawkins et al., 1987; Vanderkluysen et al., submitted). If these volcanoes have entirely alkalic shield-building phases that are isotopically homogeneous over $80\,\mathrm{m.y.}$ ., this has major implications for how we think volcanism works for the Louisville Seamount Trail and intraplate volcanism in general.  

# Mantle geodynamics and hotspot motion  

Recently it has been proposed that, because of large-scale mantle flow, plume conduits may become strongly tilted at times (e.g., Steinberger and O’Connell, 1998), which possibly may explain the fast southward hotspot motion observed for the Hawaiian hotspot $({\sim}40\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y})$ between 80 and $50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Tarduno et al., 2003). Such strong tilts may happen if the conduit is affected by a lower mantle return flow between cold downwellings associated with subduction and large-scale upwellings in the neighborhood of “superplumes.” Alternatively, the capturing, bending, and releasing of the Hawaiian mantle plume by an ancient ridge system may also explain these observations (Tarduno et al., 2009). For the Hawaiian hotspot, all of these ingredients are present—a zone of past subduction to the north, a large-scale upwelling related to the Superswell to the south (Tarduno et al., 2003), and the waning of the Kula-Pacific ridge system to the north of the hotspot—allowing a possibly captured Hawaiian plume to quickly return to its original straight position in a dominantly southward flow (Tarduno et al., 2009). However, because the Louisville hotspot lies south of the Superswell, the closest subduction system has always been located to its west, and no spreading center was located north and in close proximity for most of its geological history, this pattern is not compatible with a similar rapid southward motion for the Louisville hotspot.  

Modeling by Steinberger et al. (2004) shows the expected results of this configuration, whereby the Hawaiian hotspot indeed moves $15^{\circ}$ south since $80\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , whereas the Louisville hotspot is predicted to have moved in an easterly direction between 130 and 60 Ma, and only ${\sim}2.5^{\circ}$ south since $60\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Fig. F2A). In these models a large-scale mantle flow field is first calculated from mantle density heterogeneities (as derived from seismic S-wave speed anomalies) by applying a radial mantle rheology structure (with a lower mantle assumed to be more viscous) and by using tectonic plate motions as boundary conditions (Steinberger and O’Connell, 2000; Steinberger and Calderwood, 2006). Within the modeled mantle flow field, then, a vertical plume conduit is inserted that gets advected over time, resulting in the sometimes strong tilting of mantle plumes and the drifting of hotspots (Steinberger and O’Connell, 2000; Steinberger and Antretter, 2006). Advection dominates the motion of a plume at depths where it rises relatively slowly in comparison to the overall mantle flow field, typically in the lower mantle. As a result, the hotspot motions seem in many cases (including Louisville) to be similar to the predicted horizontal flow in the mid-mantle, at which depth the transition occurs from motions dominated by advection to a more vertical motion dominated by the buoyant rising of the mantle plumes (Steinberger, 2000). These characteristics remain the same regardless of whether mantle plumes originate at the core/mantle or $670\,\mathrm{km}$ boundary layers. In spite of the large uncertainties in the data and the assumptions on which they are built, these mantle flow models provide an excellent basis for placing the geological data derived from the Louisville and other seamount trails into a more complex geodynamic context.  

Mantle flow models using the modeling approach of Steinberger et al. (2004) thus show a largely eastward motion for the Louisville hotspot, which is very different from the ${\sim}15^{\circ}$ southward motion for Hawaii during the same time interval. This longitudinal motion for the Louisville hotspot is followed by only a minor latitudinal shift over the last $60\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ . (Fig. F2B, Model 5 in Fig. F2C). These models, however, show large variations in their predictions depending on the assumptions made, such as plume initiation age, root depth, viscosity structure, plume buoyancy, plume rising speed, plate motion history, and mantle viscosity. Antretter et al. (2004) and Steinberger and Antretter (2006) have considered the possible effects of these assumptions in more detail for the Louisville hotspot and predict paleolatitude shifts between almost none and ${\sim}8^{\circ}$ to the south, as integrated over the last $80\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . However, the majority of their model runs (see Fig. F2C for six representative examples) show latitudinal motions for Louisville that are significantly less than those observed for Hawaii. Also, for models that show a faster Louisville hotspot motion, the increased motion always is more eastward, in a direction away from the subduction zone and toward the spreading ridge.  

The shifts in paleolatitude of the Pacific hotspots also can be estimated by transferring plate motions from Indo-Atlantic hotspots to the Pacific plate using global plate circuits, assuming the fixity of the Indo-Atlantic hotspots. For example, Doubrovine and Tarduno (2008a, 2008b) showed that the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene apparent polar wander path (APWP) transferred from the paleomagnetic data of the Atlantic-bordering continents to the Pacific plate is consistent with the paleolatitude shift as observed in the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Trail. Shifts in paleolatitude of the Louisville hotspot can be predicted by the same approach (Fig. F3), although uncertainty still remains in the global plate circuit, which may go through East and West Antarctica (EANT-WANT; Cande et al., 1995) or, alternatively, through the Lord Howe Rise (LHR; Steinberger et al., 2004). Also critical is the current location of the Louisville hotspot, which still is a matter of debate because of its faint expression at the younger end of this seamount trail (Lonsdale, 1988; Raymond et al., 2000; Wessel and Kroenke, 1997; Koppers et al., submitted). All plate reconstructions (using different combinations of plate circuits and present-day hotspot locations) yield predictions that become significantly different from the position of the Louisville chain prior to $45\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Fig. F3). As with the mantle flow models, a large longitudinal shift is apparent at $78\ \mathrm{Ma}$ when comparing the oldest seamounts in the trail to the reconstructed position for Chron C33, which all plot markedly west of the Louisville Seamount Trail. It is interesting to note that the predicted potential southward shift in these plate tectonic reconstructions seems less pronounced for the oldest seamounts $\left(3.8^{\circ}\right.$ and $4.0^{\circ}$ , depending on the plate circuit used), is largest ( $8.9^{\circ}$ and $9.8^{\circ}$ ) for ${\sim}53\ \mathrm{Ma}$ seamounts (which actually indicates a possible $4^{\circ}{-5^{\circ}}$ northward motion of the plume between 80 and $50\;\mathrm{Ma}_{\mathrm{,}}$ ), and is nonexistent for seamounts younger than ${\sim}45\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The above geodynamic and plate tectonic models thus provide us with different predictions for the latitudinal history of the Louisville hotspot. These models were groundtruthed during IODP Expedition 330 and should allow us to distinguish between the following:  

1. That the Louisville hotspot shows a pronounced southward motion (up to $15^{\circ},$ ) that is comparable to the southward motion of the Hawaiian hotspot, providing evidence for a common motion of the mantle underlying the Pacific plate with respect to Earth’s spin axis;   
2. That the Louisville hotspot shows an insignificant cumulative latitudinal shift $(<\!2^{\circ}\!-\!6^{\circ})$ , supporting the Steinberger et al. (2004) and Steinberger and Antretter (2006) mantle flow models that predict minimal latitudinal motion and a pronounced easterly longitudinal motion; or   
3. That the Louisville hotspot shows a variable (but significant) latitudinal motion between 80 and $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ in combination with a large longitudinal shift, reconciling the observations made with global plate circuit models.  

By comparing paleolatitudes from the paleomagnetic measurements on cored basalt flows and high-precision $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ ages for the Hawaiian and Louisville Seamount Trails, the drilling results from Expedition 330 will offer strong constraints for one of these possibilities. Finding a large latitudinal shift between 80 and $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ clearly would indicate that current assumptions in the mantle flow models are wrong. Finding no appreciable shift, on the other hand, would indicate significant interhotspot motion between the Hawaiian and Louisville hotspots and a stronger local control on the mantle flow regime.  

Paleolatitude measurements of the Louisville Seamount Trail can also be used for comparisons of interocean motion between hotspots in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. In previous studies, large discrepancies of up to $20^{\circ}$ in motion have been reported between hotspot groups in the Pacific and Atlantic/Indian Oceans (Cande et al., 1995; DiVenere and Kent, 1999; Raymond et al., 2000). These observations have led to models of large-scale motion of the mantle underneath each ocean or to explanations involving true polar wander, which is defined as a coherent shift of the entire mantle relative to the spin axis (Goldreich and Toomre, 1969; Gordon, 1987; Besse and Courtillot, 1991, 2002; Torsvik et al., 2002). Drilling of the Louisville Seamount Trail helped to expand the necessary global paleolatitude and $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ age databases that are needed to evaluate the above scenarios. In fact, Expedition 330 is collecting paleolatitude data for a time interval similar to that sampled in the Emperor Seamount Trail during Leg 197 (Kono, 1980; Tarduno et al., 2003), and in the future additional data may be collected from ocean drilling expeditions to the ChagosLaccadive and Ninetyeast Ridges in the Indian Ocean and Walvis Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean. These expeditions may provide us with a state-of-the-art paleolatitude database covering five major hotspot trails in three oceans, all between 80 and $50\;\mathrm{Ma}$ in age. At that point it will be clear whether the observed paleolatitude shifts in hotspots are best explained by a coherent motion of all hotspots relative to the spin axis, by a coherent motion of hotspot groups within each ocean domain (but with a relative motion between these groups), or by incoherent motion of all individual hotspots.  

# Age relations along the Louisville Seamount Trail  

Using high-resolution $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ age data, Koppers et al. (2004) found that the age progression for the Louisville Seamount Trail is overall nonlinear (blue squares in Fig. F4A). Site survey $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ age data from the SO167 and AMAT02RR expeditions underline the nonlinear character of the Louisville age progression (Fig. F4A), yet they also show a very systematic age-progressive trend from $\mathord{\sim}20$ to $80\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (O’Connor et al., submitted; Koppers et al., submitted). Deviations from earlier reported ages (Watts et al., 1988) become noticeable around $35\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and are most significant toward the old end of the trail, where some guyots are now dated ${\sim}15~\mathrm{m.y}$ . older than previously reported (Koppers et al., 2004). For now, and pending new age results from Expedition  

330, the age progression for the Louisville Seamount Trail seems best approximated by the purple line in Fig. F4A, which simply envelops the oldest ages and follows the model of Koppers et al. (2004). Interestingly, new age information from the SO167 dredges now reveals a more complex age distribution in the older portion of the Louisville Seamount Trail, with some seamounts showing ages considerably younger than the age-progressive volcanism, which is the first evidence of late-stage or rejuvenated volcanic activity for this trail (O’Connor et al., submitted). Understanding the evolution of a typical Louisville seamount through state-of-the-art $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ age dating (Fig. F4B) therefore will be crucial in evaluating models predicting relative motions between hotspots. For example, Wessel and Kroenke (2009) examined the temporal variations in the geographical separation between the Louisville and Hawaiian hotspots, as measured by any change in their great-circle distance over time. By considering both the geometry and the $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ ages of the seamounts constituting these two primary seamount trails, they concluded that the Louisville hotspot may have moved several degrees to the south relative to Hawaii before ${\sim}55\ \mathrm{Ma}$ because congruent seamounts in both trails formed at a larger great-circle distance from each other during that time. However, they also showed that the Louisville and Hawaiian hotspots kept a very constant separation after that episode of interhotspot motion. Between $55\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and the present day, both hotspot systems seemingly have been moving in tandem, without any significant interhotspot motion for a prolonged period of time.  

# Geochemical evolution of the Louisville hotspot  

The construction and geochemical history of an intraplate seamount often is envisioned to resemble that of a typical Hawaiian hotspot volcano (Clague and Dalrymple, 1988). There is, however, little empirical evidence for a similar evolutionary sequence in the Louisville Seamount Trail. Essentially all igneous rocks dredged from the Louisville Seamount Trail are alkalic basalts, basanites, or tephrites containing normative nepheline (Fig. F5A) (Hawkins et al., 1987; Vanderkluysen et al., submitted). In addition, isotopic and trace element data from this seamount trail suggest a long-lived and remarkably homogeneous mantle source equivalent to the proposed “common” components FOZO (Focal Zone) or C (Fig. F5B) (Cheng et al., 1987; Hawkins et al., 1987; Vanderkluysen et al., submitted). The minor variations in major and trace elements appear to be controlled mostly by variable extents of melting and fractional crystallization but with little influence from mantle source heterogeneities (Vanderkluysen et al., submitted; Beier et al., submitted).  

This raises important questions that will be addressed by geochemical studies of the samples cored during Expedition 330. For example, do Louisville volcanoes evolve through geochemically distinct shield, postshield, and rejuvenated stages, similar to Hawaiian volcanoes? And, if so, is the dominant shield stage characterized by eruption of tholeiites or, quite the opposite, alkalic lavas? Tholeiites generally represent greater amounts of partial melting than do more alkalic lavas. One possibility is that the typical shield stage of a Louisville volcano reflects a systematically lesser amount of partial melting than in the Hawaiian case. It is also possible that dredging may have sampled only later stage lavas that in many locations cover the shield-stage flows. Interestingly, the least alkalic lavas obtained by dredging are from Osbourn Guyot near the Kermadec Trench, where extensive faulting may have exposed older shield-building lavas (Hawkins et al., 1987). The basement penetration achieved during Expedition 330 allowed direct sampling of the waning part of the shield-building stage, providing key constraints on the geochemical and magmatic evolution of the Louisville volcanoes in this primary hotspot system.  

Hawaiian shield-stage lava flows also possess a wide range of isotopic and incompatible element compositions, which is even greater when data for postshield and posterosional lavas are included. In contrast, isotope and incompatible element ratios (e.g., $\mathrm{Zr/Y}$ and Nb/Y) for the Louisville Seamount Trail are surprisingly homogeneous (Fig. F5B). Another important difference between the Louisville and HawaiianEmperor Seamount Trails may be the age of the underlying seafloor at the time of volcano formation. It has been assumed that all Louisville volcanoes generally erupted onto seafloor that was ${\sim}40{-}50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Lonsdale, 1988; Watts et al., 1988; Lyons et al., 2000). This assumption includes the older (northwestern) portion of the Louisville Seamount Trail that formed close to the Osbourn Trough paleospreading center, which ceased its activity between 115 and $121\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Downey et al., 2007). In contrast, only ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{m.y}$ . age differences between the seafloor and seamount formation are observed for the oldest Hawaiian seamounts; however, these age differences are larger than ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{m.y.}$ . for the younger Hawaiian volcanoes (Keller et al., 2000; Caplan-Auerbach et al., 2000). Lithospheric thickness therefore seems to have been less variable for the Louisville hotspot than for Hawaii, in particular, because oceanic lithosphere tends to thicken more slowly after ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m.y}$ . (e.g., Stein and Stein, 1993). Lithospheric thickness is a key control on partial melting because it determines the minimum depth of the top of the melting column and limits the extent of decompressional melting that occurs in the upwelling mantle (e.g., McKenzie and Bickle, 1988). Other things being equal, greater amounts of partial melting occur under thin lithosphere, and, in a mantle containing isotopically and chemically distinct lithologies, different mantle components are likely to begin to melt at different depths (Sun and Hanson, 1976; Ellam, 1992; Phipps Morgan and Morgan, 1999; Hoernle et al., 2000; Niu et al., 2002; Ito and Mahoney, 2005; Devey et al., 2003). For the Emperor Seamounts much of the observed isotopic and chemical variation may be related to changing proximity to a spreading center and related changes in lithospheric thickness (Keller et al., 2004; Regelous et al., 2003). In contrast, for most of the Louisville Seamount Trail, the limited isotopic variation is likely to reflect a remarkably homogeneous plume source or relatively uniform melting conditions over $80\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ . This model, however, contradicts a recent study using seismic refraction that provided the first two-dimensional tomographic image of the internal structure of the oceanic lithosphere beneath seamounts (Fig. F6). This tomographic image for one of the oldest Louisville seamounts clearly delineates a downward-flexed Mohorovicic seismic discontinuity (MOHO; by as much as $2.5\;\mathrm{km}$ ) that can only be explained by an elastic plate model in which this particular seamount was emplaced upon ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{Ma}$ oceanic lithosphere (ContrerasReyes et al., 2010). This latter outcome agrees with the ocean crust age model for the Louisville Seamount Trail region presented in the global compilation of magnetic isochrons that went into the Müller et al. (2008) map. In this map the ocean crust is only ${\sim}10\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ . older than the $78\,\mathrm{Ma}$ Osbourn Guyot, the oldest seamount in the Louisville Seamount Trail, but this age difference systematically increases and becomes ${\sim}70\,\mathrm{m.y}$ . for the $50\;\mathrm{Ma}$ Louisville seamounts.  

# Louisville as a primary hotspot  

Courtillot et al. (2003) have argued that most hotspots arise from relatively shallow levels and that no more than three primary plumes ascend from the core/mantle boundary in the Pacific Basin: Hawaii, Easter, and Louisville. These authors suggest several criteria by which primary plumes may be assessed, the chief geochemical criterion being high $\mathrm{^3He}/\mathrm{^4He}$ ratios in hotspot lavas. Although agreement is not universal (e.g., Meibom et al., 2003), high $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ ratios are considered by the great majority of scientists to be a sign of a deep-mantle origin (e.g., Allègre et al., 1983; O’Nions, 1987; Farley and Neroda, 1998). Hawaiian basalts, for example, have $\mathrm{^3He}/\mathrm{^4He}$ values as high as $35\ \mathrm{R_{A}}$ (where $\mathrm{R_{A}}$ is the atmospheric $\mathrm{^3He}/\mathrm{^4He}$ ratio), and even higher values have been reported for samples from Iceland. In comparison, midocean-ridge basalts (MORB) typically have values of only $7{-}10\ \mathrm{R_{A}}$ (e.g., Graham, 2002). No He isotope data have been published for the Louisville Seamount Trail. Another geochemical indicator of a deep-mantle origin is high $^{186}\mathrm{OS}/^{188}\mathrm{OS}_{i}$ , which is interpreted by some workers to signify Os derived from the outer core. Only a few studies of Os isotopes in oceanic hotspot lavas have yet been performed, but anomalously high $^{186}\mathrm{OS}/^{188}\mathrm{Os}$ and $^{187}\mathrm{Os}/^{188}\mathrm{Os}$ ratios have been discovered in at least some of the primary hotspots, such as Hawaii (e.g., Brandon et al., 1999). Although the interpretation of the elevated Os isotope ratios is disputable (e.g., Smith, 2003), combined studies of Os and He isotopes have the highest potential to reveal any deep-mantle signature in oceanic lavas. Drilling during Expedition 330 has recovered a high number of basalt flows with relatively unaltered olivine crystals and oxide minerals that will be used to successfully test these geochemical criteria and to prove or disprove that the Louisville hotspot is a primary hotspot. If these tests indicate that Louisville does not have a deep (lower)-mantle origin, this outcome will place limits on the mantle flow models by forcing a shallower root for its mantle plume. Although geodynamic modeling likely cannot resolve the depth of origin between primary and secondary hotspots, geochemical results possibly can on the basis of characteristically high $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ and $^{186}\mathrm{OS}/^{188}\mathrm{Os}$ deep-mantle plume ratios.  

# Relation between the Louisville hotspot and the Ontong Java Plateau  

The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) has been proposed to be a large igneous province that is the product of the Louisville hotspot’s initial plume-head phase (e.g., Richards and Griffiths, 1989; Mahoney and Spencer, 1991; Tarduno et al., 1991). However, existing isotopic data for Louisville dredge samples (Cheng et al., 1987; Vanderkluysen et al., submitted) offer no strong support for such a connection (Mahoney et al., 1993; Tejada et al., 1996). Ontong Java and Louisville samples have similar age-corrected Nd and Sr isotope values, but the Louisville lavas have significantly higher Pb isotope ratios than Ontong Java basalts (Fig. F5B), and the difference is more than can be accounted for by ingrowth of radiogenic Pb in the mantle source between 120 and 80 Ma (Vanderkluysen et al., submitted). Expedition 330 drill sites will provide a much more rigorous test of any geochemical connection between the OJP and the Louisville Seamount Trail to more definitively prove or refute this possible genetic relation.  

# Mantle temperatures of the Louisville hotspot  

Comparable to other primary hotspots (e.g., Hawaii and Samoa), potential temperatures of the Louisville mantle plume sources are expected to be $100^{\circ}{-}300^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ higher than the $1350^{\circ}\pm50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ temperature of an upper-mantle MORB source (Putirka, 2008; Courtier et al., 2007). Fresh olivine-phyric basalts were encountered at all Expedition 330 drill sites. Because we drilled into the alkalic (shield) lavas of the Louisville Seamounts, these rocks are excellent candidates for determining the Mg-Fe compositions of olivine phenocrysts and melt-inclusions therein. In turn, these compositions will yield information about the source temperatures by relating the $\mathrm{Mg/Fe}$ ratio of the olivines directly to that of the liquid from which they crystallized (e.g., Putirka et al., 2007). The challenge here is to make these determinations on the most Mg-rich olivines that also come closest to the parental magma compositions, a task that may be more complicated for the Louisville Seamounts because all samples studied so far are relatively evolved and typically alkalic. However, if Louisville volcanism is typified by alkali basalt shield building, and not by Hawaiian-style tholeiites, it may be the case that no true picritic lavas will be encountered, as was the case during Leg 197, where olivine-rich basalts were found after drilling ${>}250\ \mathrm{m}$ into the Emperor Seamounts (Duncan et al., 2006).  

# Melt inclusions and volatiles in volcanic glasses  

Melt inclusions also provide key insights into the “true” (lack of) compositional heterogeneity in the mantle source from which the Louisville magmas have been generated. Because melt inclusions are small (tens to a few hundreds of micrometers in diameter) volumes of melt trapped in phenocrysts, they can remain isolated from differentiation and alteration that affect the external melt, thereby preserving more primitive liquid compositions compared to those determined from groundmass glass or bulk-rock analyses (Sobolev, 1996; Kent, 2008). If trapped in an early crystallizing phase, such as olivine, they may even reveal primary magma compositions and can provide insights into the mantle sources of these magmas (Saal et al., 1998; Hauri, 2002). These inclusions often span a range of compositions wider than those exhibited by the groundmass glass or bulk rock, when they are being trapped at different stages in the evolution of the magma (Frezzotti, 2001; Danyushevsky et al., 2002). Melt inclusion studies will therefore complement bulk-rock analyses of the Louisville basaltic rocks because potential heterogeneities are more likely to be recorded by melt inclusions. In addition, if these melt inclusions are trapped before or during volatile degassing, suitable crystalline host phases (without cleavage or any other imperfections) may act as pressure vessels, which can isolate the trapped melt from pressure changes affecting the bulk magma. Melt inclusion volatiles therefore may preserve the initial magma volatile concentration and speciation and the degassing path undertaken by the magma (Wallace, 2005).  

# Hydrothermal and seawater alteration  

Seamounts are believed to rival mid-ocean-ridge flanks in terms of the total mass of seawater that has been fluxed through their basement. They therefore are likely to play a critical role in regulating crust-ocean chemical exchange fluxes. In this regard, ocean-ridge-flank systems have been studied by several authors (Alt and Teagle, 1999, 2003; Bach et al., 2003), but the alteration and veining history of seamounts has not yet been studied in any detail. During Expedition 330, five submerged seamounts having crustal ages between 50 and $80\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and only thin sediment covers were drilled, providing a unique opportunity for investigating the exchange fluxes between these seamounts and the ocean. Whole-rock geochemical studies as well as Sr, O, H, and C isotopic analyses of carbonate veins and alteration minerals will provide the basis for reconstructing the seawater-rock interaction through the lifetime of hydrologic activity on these seamounts. Because of the thin sediment cover on the Louisville Seamounts it is likely that seawater access to these volcanic basements has been long term, and thus they are excellent targets for assessing the magnitude of carbonate vein formation in aging oceanic crust and its role as a global $C O_{2}$ sink.  

# Geomicrobiology and fossil microbial traces  

Since the 1990s, microbiologists on ODP and IODP expeditions have documented the presence of microbial life in deeply buried sediments and the basaltic basement (Fisk et al., 1998; Parkes et al., 1994). Active microbial life has been detected as far below the seafloor as $1626\;\mathrm{m}$ (Roussel et al., 2008), and the introduction of molecular biology into marine ecology has led to great advances in our understanding of microbial life below the seafloor (Cowen et al., 2003; Inagaki et al., 2006; Mason et al., 2010). To this day, however, the microbiology performed on ODP and IODP expeditions has concentrated on sediments, with the notable exception of expeditions to the Juan de Fuca Ridge (Cowen et al., 2003) and the Atlantis Massif (Mason et al., 2010), both of which sampled younger than $3.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ oceanic crust. Stable isotope evidence (Rouxel et al., 2008) and microbial fossils (Fisk et al., 1998) indicate that there is a subsurface biosphere in older basement rocks as well. The microbial fossil traces found there are believed to be due to the boring activity of microorganisms that mostly colonized the volcanic glass to which the bacterial cells and filaments are connected (Thorseth et al., 1995; Fisk et al., 1998; Furnes et al., 2001). A different type of boring activity is recorded in carbonates precipitated in the veins, vesicles, and void space of volcanic rocks (Peckmann et al., 2008; Eickmann et al., 2009; Ivarsson et al., 2008). These carbonate cements have enclosed filaments that very closely resemble budding and branching microbial structures. Expedition 330 provides an excellent opportunity to study both living and extant microbial residents within the old, $50{-}80\,\mathrm{Ma}$ subseafloor volcanic rocks that make up the Louisville Seamounts. Differences in microbial population between the overlying (pelagic) sediments and volcaniclastic layers and the basaltic basement are of keen interest, as is variation between lava flows with depth into the seamount structures and between seamounts of different age.  

# Scientific objectives  

# Primary objectives  

1. Determine the paleolatitude change (if any) over time for the Louisville hotspot.  

High-quality paleolatitude data are required to establish the Louisville hotspot’s potential motion between 80 and $50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ relative to the Earth’s spin axis and to compare this to the $15^{\circ}$ shift in paleolatitude that has been observed for the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Trail during the same time period. Together with the measurement of highresolution $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ age dates for the cored lava flows, these paleolatitude data will help us to distinguish between the possibilities that these primary Pacific hotspots moved coherently before $50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ or, alternatively, that they show significant interhotspot motion, with the Louisville hotspot showing less or no discernible latitudinal motion and a considerable longitudinal shift toward the east. Comparison of these results with predictions from geodynamic mantle flow and plate circuit models will allow us to critically test, calibrate, and improve these models. These comparisons are of fundamental importance to understanding the nature of hotspots, the convection of the Earth's mantle, and true polar wander.  

2. Determine the volcanic history of individual seamounts and the age progression along the Louisville Seamount Trail through $^{40}\!A r\!/^{39}\!A r$ age dating.  

Because volcanic activity for a single hotspot volcano can span up to 10 m.y. when including the possibility of posterosional volcanism, establishing an accurate framework of $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ ages is essential to successfully determine the paleolatitude change over time and map out the magmatic evolution within single seamounts and along the Louisville Seamount Trail. Shield-building and postshield lavas typically form over short periods of $1{-}2\;\mathrm{m.y.}$ . for Hawaiian-type volcanoes and can be readily distinguished from any overlaying posterosional sequences (if present) because of the high precision in state-of-the-art $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ age determinations. Incremental heating $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ age dating for that reason will allow us to establish age histories within each drill core that can be used to establish the cessation of volcanism at the end of the shield-building phase and to determine the starting time (and minimal duration) of the postshield capping and posterosional stages.  

3. Determine the magmatic evolution of the Louisville Seamounts and their mantle source through major and trace element and isotope geochemistry.  

Existing data from dredged lavas suggest that the mantle source of the Louisville hotspot has been remarkably homogeneous for as long as 80 m.y. In addition, all dredged basalts are predominantly alkalic and likely represent a mostly alkalic shieldbuilding stage, which contrasts sharply with the predominant tholeiitic shield-building stage of volcanoes and seamounts in the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Trail. Therefore, geochemical and isotopic data for basaltic lavas from the five seamounts cored during Expedition 330 will provide key insights into the magmatic evolution and melting processes that produced and constructed the Louisville volcanoes while they progressed from shield to postshield (and maybe posterosional) volcanic stages. In turn, these data will help us to characterize the Louisville Seamount Trail as a product of one of only three primary hotspots in the Pacific and to test the apparently long-lived homogeneous geochemical character of its mantle source. Detailed analyses of melt inclusions, volcanic glass samples, primitive basalts, and high-Mg olivine pheno- and xenocrysts will provide further constraints on the asserted homogeneity of the Louisville mantle plume source and the compositional evolution of this source between 80 and $50\;\mathrm{Ma}$ . Together, these geochemical and isotopic studies will allow us to map out the fundamental differences between primary Hawaiian and Louisville hotspot volcanism.  

# Secondary objectives  

1. Determine whether the Ontong Java Plateau formed from the plume head of the Louisville mantle plume around 120 Ma.  

One hypothesis states that the Ontong Java Plateau formed from massive volcanism around $120\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , when the preceding plume head of the Louisville mantle upwelling reached the base of the Pacific lithosphere and started extensive partial melting (e.g., Richards and Griffiths, 1989; Mahoney and Spencer, 1991). If the Louisville Seamount Trail corresponds to the plume tail stage of the Louisville mantle plume itself and the Ontong Java Plateau to the plume head, then new paleolatitude estimates, $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ ages, and geochemical data will help us to decide whether the oldest Louisville seamounts were formed close to the $18^{\circ}{-}28^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ paleolatitude determined from ODP Leg 192 basalts for the Ontong Java Plateau (Riisager et al., 2003) and whether they are genetically linked or not. The outcome of this hypothesis test will have significant implications for the origin of the Ontong Java Plateau and large igneous provinces in general.  

2. Determine the potential temperature and degree and depth of partial melting at which Louisville seamount lavas were generated.  

Characterizing Louisville as one of the primary hotspots in the Pacific requires estimation of the minimum potential temperature of its mantle plume source, the degree of partial melting in this source, and the depth of the melting zone beneath the oceanic lithosphere in order to distinguish this model from alternate models, such as intraplate volcanism originating in the upper mantle from more “fertile” (i.e., more refractory) materials (e.g., Foulger and Anderson, 2005). Evidence for temperatures higher than the mean $1350^{\circ}\pm50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ temperature of an upper-mantle MORB source (Courtier et al., 2007; Putirka, 2008) will be important to prove the deep thermal origin of the Louisville mantle plume. Evidence for changes in the degrees and depths of partial melting, on the other hand, will be important to document the changing plume-lithosphere interactions along the Louisville Seamount Trail.  

3. Provide paleoceanographic and paleoclimate data at $40^{\circ}{-}50^{\circ}\varsigma$ paleolatitudes in the southern ocean from cored Louisville pelagic sediments.  

Thin packages of pelagic sediments cap the flat-topped Louisville Seamounts. These sediments possibly contain abundant calcareous fossils (e.g., foraminifers and nannofossils) because they were deposited in shallow waters and above the carbonate compensation depth (CCD). This will provide good stratigraphic age control in the sediments, which also may be recovered intercalated between lava flows deep into the volcanic basement. Such a fossil record can be compared with the $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ radiometric age dates measured on basement samples. In addition, nummulitic limestones have been dredged from guyots in the Louisville Seamount Trail, indicating the possible presence of Eocene shallow-water reefs in the high- to mid-latitude Pacific (Lonsdale, 1988). The timing of reef formation, and eventually the drowning of such carbonate banks, is of considerable interest because it provides evidence from the southeast Pacific for the expansion of tropical climates during past warm periods (Adams, 1967, 1983; Premoli Silva et al., 1995; Huber et al., 1995; Wilson et al., 1998; Jenkyns and Wilson, 1999). These sediments may provide a unique data set, adding to the very sparse paleoclimate record in the South Pacific at such high southern-latitude sites (Corfield and Cartlidge, 1992; Corfield and Norris, 1996; Barrera and Savin, 1999; Norris et al., 2001).  

# Site survey data  

Three cruises surveyed and sampled the Louisville Seamount Trail before and in preparation for Expedition 330. In 1984 Lonsdale (1988) made a transit along the entire trail while collecting the first multibeam swath bathymetry and $3.5\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and magnetic profiles. In that cruise 25 guyots and 12 other large volcanoes were mapped, and at least one single-channel seismic reflection profile was collected across their summits. Following that initial cruise, a limited set of dredge samples (blue circles in Fig. F1B) were used for total fusion $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ age dating (squares and triangles in Fig. F4A) and geochemistry (triangles in Fig. F5).  

In November 2002, Cruise 167 of the F/S Sonne (SO167; Stoffers, 2003) surveyed the Louisville Seamount Trail between the Tonga Trench and the $169^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ bend. Subaerial lavas and volcaniclastics were dredged from 11 guyots at 39 different stations (gray circles in Fig. F1B). Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) results indicate that the dredged basalts are all alkali basalts, whereas preliminary $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ age data indicate a sometimes complex age history for the oldest seamounts in the trail (circles in Fig. F4A) (O’Connor et al., submitted) and geochemistry variations that show little variation along the Louisville Seamount Trail, except for a single large guyot that overlies the Wishbone fracture zone in the Pacific plate (Beier et al., submitted).  

During the 2006 AMAT02RR site survey cruise the SIMRAD EM-120 echo-sounding system was used to map 72 seamounts and guyots, many with full coverage and all with at least $80\%$ multibeam coverage. Multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection data were collected along the oldest third of the seamount trail (Fig. F1B) using two 45–105 $\mathrm{in}^{3}$ generator-injector (GI) air guns and an $800\;\mathrm{m}\;48\$ -channel streamer. This resulted in 79 seismic lines with 69 crossing points on 22 seamounts. From these MCS data we selected four primary and seven alternate drill sites on seven seamounts that (1) fall within the age constraints of the comparative Leg 197 experiment we proposed to carry out, (2) have a sufficient sediment cover of at least $10\,\mathrm{m}$ , based on $3.5\;\mathrm{kHz}$ subbottom profiling and sidescan reflection data, and (3) show consistent reflectors below these sediments representing basaltic basement. In addition, 29 sites were dredged on 21 seamounts and guyots (green circles in Fig. F1B). From these dredge hauls 42 groundmass and mineral separates from 17 seamounts were age dated using the $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ incremental heating technique (see diamonds and plateau diagrams in Fig. F4) (Lindle et al., 2009; Koppers et al., submitted). Major and trace element analyses already have been carried out on 61 samples, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope analyses have been carried out for 49 samples (circles in Fig. F5A) (Vanderkluysen et al., submitted).  

We also conducted magnetic surveys of two seamounts and the small guyot at $168.6^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ that was targeted for drilling (Site U1377 on Hadar Guyot). The magnetic anomaly pattern for $168.6^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ unfortunately has very low amplitude (Fig. F7) and yields an unreasonable paleopole position, but the complexity of the anomaly pattern suggests that dual polarities might be present. If sampled, these changing polarities could provide a more robust paleolatitude estimate. In contrast, the $35.8^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ seamount (located $1.1^{\circ}$ north of prospectus Site LOUI-3B) has a well-defined (root mean square crossover error $3\;\mathrm{nT}$ ) and simple magnetic anomaly pattern with the normal polarity, presumably reflecting formation during Chron 26n at $57.5–57.9\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Cande and Kent, 1995). Seminorm inversions (Parker et al., 1987) yield paleopole positions that are relatively stable over a range of misfits (Fig. F8) and that are largely compatible with the Pacific apparent polar wander path (Sager and Pringle, 1987). Finally, these inversions give a paleolatitude of ${\sim}49^{\circ}\pm7^{\circ}\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{}}$ , similar to the present-day $50.9^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ latitude of the Louisville hotspot. Despite the ambiguity in the interpretation of seamount magnetic anomalies (Parker, 1991) and its relatively large $_{1\upsigma}$ uncertainty, this result may suggest that no (or little) discernible paleolatitude shift has occurred since this Louisville seamount formed around $58\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and over a time interval in which the contemporary Suiko Seamount in the Emperor Seamounts showed at least a $6^{\circ}$ paleolatitude shift.  

# Seismic interpretation  

Interpretation of the multichannel seismic data collected during the AMAT02RR site survey is complicated because the Louisville Seamounts have never been drilled before, neither by Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP)/ODP nor using piston coring. In fact, samples and data collected during Expedition 330 will be essential in groundtruthing the seismic interpretation and improving the final seismic images of this group of intraplate seamounts. Despite some ambiguity in the interpretation of the MCS data, the available data provided us with the first-order information to successfully reach the objectives and goals of Expedition 330.  

Seismic imaging and $3.5\,\mathrm{kHz}$ data show that the overall thicknesses of the pelagic sediment cap is $<\!20\;\mathrm{m}$ for all primary sites, underlain by a ${<}55\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of volcaniclastics and followed by what largely appears to be “opaque” volcanic basement with no significant reflectors. The intermediary volcaniclastic sequences, however, do show strong reflectors dispersing outward from the centers of the targeted seamounts and are interpreted to be intercalated themselves with lava flows or carbonates. Many of the larger guyots (not targeted for drilling) in the Louisville Seamount Trail show a substantial thickness (up to several hundred meters) in these sequences that similarly dip and thicken toward their margins. Dredge samples from depths corresponding to outcrops of this unit recovered various volcaniclastic sediments, including rounded cobbles from supposedly shallow beach deposits (SO167 cruise report). On the basis of Leg 197 observations of the Emperor Seamounts, the bases of these dipping volcaniclastic sequences were taken as the contacts with lava flow–dominated basaltic basement (Kerr et al., 2006). The thickening of the volcaniclastic sequence also has been imaged by a seismic refraction experiment carried out during the German SO195 cruise (Grevemeyer and Flüh, 2008). During this experiment a single $370\,\mathrm{km}$ long refraction line was carried out orthogonal to the overall northwest trend of the Louisville Seamount Trail and crossing the summit of the $27.6^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ guyot, which is located one seamount down and about $1.1^{\circ}$ south of Site U1372. On the basis of the outcome of this refraction experiment (with 35 ocean-bottom seismometer [OBS] stations, spaced every ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{km}$ ), Contreras-Reyes et al. (2010) were able to image the internal structure of this seamount, the oceanic crust underneath it, and the flexed shape of the MOHO. Even though their data do not provide sufficient resolution for the uppermost $500\,\mathrm{m}$ of this seamount, the data give us a good idea of the velocity structure of the $27.6^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ guyot, with (1) a sequence of “basaltic extrusives” (i.e., lava flows and $4.0{-}6.0\,\mathrm{km/s}$ seismic velocities) extending to shallower regions and reaching ${<}0.5\;\mathrm{km}$ basement depth in the seamount center and (2) a sequence of “volcaniclastic infill” (i.e., $2.0{-}3.0\;\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ seismic velocities) starting with a very thin layer on top of the seamount and substantially thickening outward, particularly on the seamount flanks and in its flexural moat. This outcome provides confidence in our interpretation of the AMAT02RR seismic reflection profiles and our placement of drill sites away from and between the shelf edges of the guyots and the center of these volcanic structures.  

# Coring and drilling strategy  

The drilling strategy used during Expedition 330 was the same as the Leg 197 drilling strategy, which provided compelling evidence for the motion of the Hawaiian mantle plume between 80 and $50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Tarduno, Duncan, Scholl, et al., 2002). For that reason we targeted four Louisville seamounts that have ages similar to the Detroit, Suiko, Nintoku, and Koko Seamounts in the Emperor Seamount Trail. Our principal drilling goal was to drill $350\;\mathrm{m}$ (or deeper) into the igneous basement of these Louisville seamounts in order to core and recover as many individual lava flows or cooling units as possible (see below). By analyzing these flows using modern paleomagnetic, $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ geochronological, and geochemical techniques, we will be able to directly compare paleolatitude estimates and geochemical signatures between seamounts in the two longest-lived hotspot systems in the Pacific.  

# Paleosecular variation  

Secular variation is defined by small deviations from the geomagnetic axial dipole (GAD) model caused by variations of the nondipole components in the Earth’s magnetic field, occurring on timescales ranging from $10^{2}$ to $10^{3}$ y (Butler, 1992; Tauxe, 2010). Because a paleomagnetic direction preserved in an in situ lava flow by its thermal remanent magnetization (TRM) is a geologically instantaneous recording of the fluctuating geomagnetic field, robust paleolatitude estimates based on the GAD model require us to average out these paleosecular variations by sampling a sufficiently large number of lava flows. This can be achieved by sampling multiple lava flows spanning a longer geological time interval, on the order of $10^{4}–10^{5}$ y (Butler, 1992; Tauxe, 2010).  

Planned penetration depths into the seamount volcanic basements were therefore primarily dictated by the need for accurate paleolatitude data. The expected errors on paleolatitude estimates at a $\mathord{\sim}50^{\circ}$ southern latitude, appropriate for the Louisville hotspot, can be illustrated via Monte Carlo simulations of field directions as drawn from two widely used paleosecular variation (PSV) models—Model G of McElhinny and McFadden (1997) and TK03 of Tauxe and Kent (2004)—that are based on a global database of directions from lava flows of $0{-}5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ in age, assuming that the magnitude and timescale of paleosecular variations did not change with time. These simulations suggest that ${>}42$ independent flow units must be recovered to achieve a nominal $_{2\upsigma}$ error of $4^{\circ}$ in the paleolatitude estimates (Fig. F9A), and only 25–30 units must be recovered if we aim more conservatively for $5^{\circ}$ errors. These results also can be compared to a compilation of DSDP/ODP drilling statistics from other expeditions to seamount trails and large igneous provinces (Fig. F9B) that on average recovered ${>}20$ flow groups for ${\sim}200{-}300\;\mathrm{m}$ of coring into volcanic basement. Measured uncertainties (Fig. F9C) in these DSDP/ODP drill cores are generally compatible with the Monte  

Carlo simulations, but these data scatter significantly between $3^{\circ}$ and $7^{\circ}$ uncertainties for paleolatitude estimates based on 5 or more flow units. Because the mantle flow models and global plate circuit reconstructions predict small paleolatitude shifts for the Louisville hotspot, we required a basement penetration of at least $350\mathrm{~m~}$ to achieve a paleolatitude uncertainty better than $5^{\circ}$ .  

# Hydrothermal and seawater alteration  

Most of the dredged samples from the Louisville Seamount Trail were highly to completely altered by hydrothermal and seawater alteration. Even though drilling during Expedition 330 provided us with much fresher basaltic material, alteration remains problematic and thus requires special analytical attention in order to maximize the amount and quality of data on rock ages and their original (erupted) compositions. Holocrystalline groundmass samples that have been carefully hand-picked and acidleached to remove alteration have been shown to provide ages concordant with $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ ages of co-magmatic minerals and can be interpreted as eruption ages (Koppers et al., 2000, 2004). Recent data on basalts from the AMAT02RR site survey emphasize the suitability of this technique for the Louisville Seamount Trail (Fig. F4B) (Koppers et al., submitted).  

Many studies also established that altered rocks can be effectively used for determining a hotspot’s geochemical characteristics, particularly data for elements (lanthanides, Nb, Ta, Zr, Ti, Fe, and Al) and isotopic systems (Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf) that are resistant to seawater alteration. In addition, useful data can be obtained for the more sensitive Sr and Pb isotopic systems by applying mineral separation or acid-leaching to remove secondary minerals (Cheng et al., 1987; Mahoney et al., 1998; Koppers et al., 2003; Regelous et al., 2003). Additionally, magmatic compositions can be inferred from the microanalysis of major and trace elements, as well as isotopic ratios, in unaltered portions of various phenocrystic phases and melt inclusions. In any case, several ODP/IODP workshops have recommended a drilling depth of at least $100\;\mathrm{m}$ to retrieve relatively fresh samples suitable for age dating and geochemical studies.  

# Site selection and coring plan  

Our principal science objectives were to acquire accurate paleolatitudes, geochemistry and isotope compositions, and $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ age dates for at least four Louisville seamounts having formation ages similar to seamounts in the Emperor Seamount Trail drilled during Leg 197. In addition, we selected drill sites where seismic lines cross midway between centers of the targeted flat-topped seamounts (i.e., guyots) and their margins, a compromise designed to avoid eruptive centers (which may harbor fewer lava units) and marginal sites with potentially thicker volcaniclastic units and higher potential for tectonic disruption. The Louisville seamounts targeted for drilling are relatively small edifices and typically have thinner sedimentary covers and fewer subsidiary peaks and pinnacles that may represent late-stage (posterosional) lavas.  

Four primary sites (Fig. F1; Table T1) were selected on four flat-topped seamounts at the older end of the Louisville Seamount Trail. On the basis of new $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ ages from the AMAT02RR site survey, we estimate the ages of these dormant volcanic structures to be $75{-}77\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (prospectus Site LOUI-1C on Canopus Guyot at $26.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ ), $58.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (prospectus Site LOUI-2B on Achernar Guyot at $33.7^{\circ}\mathrm{S},$ ), $54.0\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (prospectus Site LOUI-3B at $36.9^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ ), and $50.1\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (prospectus Site LOUI-4B on Hadar Guyot at $168.6^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ ). In addition, eight alternate sites (prospectus Sites LOUI-1B, LOUI-6A, LOUI-6B, LOUI-7A, LOUI-7B, LOUI-8A, LOUI-8B, and LOUI-9A) were selected (Table T2). Except for the $36.9^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ guyot, which has a second set of crossing lines close to primary prospectus Site LOUI-8A, most alternate sites were located on three different but closely neighboring seamounts (also surveyed during AMAT02RR) in order to stay as near as possible to our original age-selection criterion and our overall drilling strategy. The eighth alternate site (Site LOUI-6B on Rigil Guyot at $28.6^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ) was added during Expedition 330.  

# Logging and downhole measurement strategy  

Downhole logging aided in achieving the objectives of Expedition 330 by assisting in lithologic identification and the recognition of structural characteristics of, in particular, cored volcanic basement sequences and by providing detailed monitoring of changes in magnetic properties and paleomagnetic directions within and between lava flows. Wireline logs provided a continuous record to aid in the detection of lava flow boundaries, interlayered (baked) sediments, and alteration zones in the basement section and enabled evaluation of the tilting of lava flows. Determination of the number of lava flow units has implications for how well geomagnetic secular variation has been sampled and hence the extent to which paleomagnetic paleolatitudes can be constrained most precisely. These logging measurements complement shipboard core measurements by recording the characteristics of lithologic units in intervals of poor core recovery and by allowing comparison of logging data to discrete sample analyses.  

Combinations of four wireline logging tool strings were deployed during Expedition 330: (1) the triple combination (triple combo) tool string, (2) the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic tool string, (3) the Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (UBI), and (4) the third-party Göttingen Borehole Magnetometer (GBM). These tools and their applications are further described in the section below; additional information is available at iodp.ldeo.columbia.edu/TOOLS_LABS/index.html.  

# Triple combo, FMS-sonic, and UBI tool strings  

The triple combo tool string consists of several probes that record geophysical measurements of the penetrated formations and measures total and spectral natural gamma ray, density, porosity, and resistivity of the formation. These measurements enable assessment of changes in lithology and variations in alteration. The FMS-sonic tool string acquires oriented high-resolution electrical resistivity images of the borehole wall and measures compressional and shear wave forms. The high-resolution images allow small-scale fractures and lithologic variations to be detected, enable the tilt of lava flows to be evaluated, and may allow core pieces to be reoriented. The sonic and density logs from this tool string can be used together to create synthetic seismograms, allowing correlation between the regional seismic data and lithologic units recovered from the boreholes. Two full uplog FMS runs were done for each hole, resulting in eight individual pad tracks, producing an electrical image that can cover ${>}65\%$ of the $360^{\circ}$ borehole wall. In the case of Site U1374 the UBI was deployed as well, providing high-resolution acoustic amplitude images with $100\%$ coverage of the borehole wall.  

FMS images, in conjunction with the UBI, can provide a comprehensive overview of structure, virtual hardness, and variation in lithofacies. Images collected with the FMS-sonic tool string are extremely helpful in picking out formation features such as vesicles, breccias, and coherent units (Bartetzko et al., 2003). To most accurately reorient the core pieces using FMS and UBI images, these tool strings are run with a General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT). However, in formations characterized by a strong remanent magnetization these inclinometry data values can be affected. By running the GBM (see below) and comparing its data with those collected with the GPIT, a more accurate image orientation can be done, which in turn allows for a more accurate reorientation of core pieces using FMS and UBI images (Gaillot et al., 2004).  

# Göttingen Borehole Magnetometer (third-party tool)  

High-quality paleolatitude data are required to document the motion of the Louisville hotspot and to compare it with the $15^{\circ}$ shift observed for the Hawaiian hotspot over the same time interval. These data, in concert with detailed radiometric ages, will provide the basis for calibrating and testing various geodynamic models. The most robust paleolatitude information will be derived from detailed demagnetization studies of the cored—but azimuthally unoriented—basaltic basement samples. However, the GBM (Fig. F10) provides valuable complementary data that significantly enhance these paleomagnetic directional studies that are critical expedition objectives.  

The GBM allows fully oriented component magnetic anomalies to be determined by measuring three orthogonal components of the magnetic field (Steveling et al., 2003). The GBM includes three optical gyroscopes, which record the overall tool’s rotation since the start of the measurement, allowing the cumulative rotation of the tool to be undone by retroactively unwinding the recorded rotations of the GBM using a Matlab software program (S. Ehmann, Technische Universität in Braunschweig, Germany). Together, this allows for independent determination of the intensity, inclination, and declination of the magnetization in the borehole lava flow formations. For optimum data quality the GBM requires centralization during logging and the addition of a nonmagnetic sinker bar just above the GBM.  

The GBM was developed in Göttingen, Germany, by Drs. M. Leven and E. Steveling at the Institut für Geophysik of the Georg-August-Universität (e.g., Steveling et al., 2003) to measure all three magnetic components in the walls of a borehole during downhole logging runs. This tool is currently housed at the Technische Universität in Braunschweig, Germany, and is maintained and deployed under the supervision of Professor A. Hoerdt. The GBM was successfully deployed for the first time in ODP Hole 1203A (Leg 197) in the Emperor Seamounts, although the results were used primarily to test filtering algorithms for the fluxgate sensors on the GPIT (Gaillot et al., 2004). The GBM was subsequently deployed during IODP Expedition 304/305, but short-period oscillations in the gyro data prevented recovery of component anomaly data. More recently, the GBM was successfully deployed in the $2.5~\mathrm{km}$ deep Outokumpu hole in eastern Finland of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) (Virgil et al., 2010).  

The ability of the GBM to make in situ three-component determinations of the magnetic anomalous field in the borehole and estimate both the inclination and declination of penetrated lava flows allows for the following important improvements. First, magnetization declination data from logging using the GBM may aid in recognizing temporally distinct flow units in the core, usually judged by inclination differences alone. This is an important first-order application because the number of distinct flow units is critical in establishing the uncertainty in paleolatitude estimates as measured from discrete core samples (by averaging out secular variation). Second, high-quality determination of the vertical and horizontal magnetic anomalies will allow in situ magnetization inclinations to be determined, which will provide complementary in situ data that may help in determining the paleolatitude history of the Louisville hotspot. And, finally, even though the fluxgate magnetometers incorporated in the GPIT are sufficient for orienting the FMS system, these sensors have relatively poor sensitivity $(50\;\mathrm{nT})$ and, more importantly, show substantial $({\sim}1000~\mathrm{nT})$ offsets that limit interpretation of the data (e.g., Ito et al., 1995). The fluxgate magnetometers in the GBM have a better resolution $(12\;\mathrm{nT})$ and are well calibrated. For example, when the ambient field was measured with the GBM above the HSDP-2 drill hole on Hawaii (Steveling et al., 2003), the inclination of $36.5^{\circ}$ compares well with the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) inclination $(36.6^{\circ})$ , and the measured total field was compatible with that determined by aeromagnetic surveys.  

# Principal results  

# Site U1372  

Canopus Guyot is one of the oldest seamounts in the Louisville Seamount Trail at ${\sim}75{-}77\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Table T1). Its volcanic edifice is located at $26.5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}.$ , $174.7^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ and, with a second guyot at $26.6^{\circ}\mathrm{S}_{.}$ , forms two coalesced volcanic centers that together are $55\,\mathrm{km}$ long and $15~\mathrm{km}$ wide. Site U1372 was placed on the summit plain of the northern volcanic center, close to its southern shelf edge at $1957.6\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Fig. F11). A $\sim\!14\mathrm{~m~}$ package of soft pelagic sediment was cored using a gravity-push approach with little or no rotation using a rotary core barrel (RCB), followed by standard coring into $\sim\!32\textrm{m}$ of basaltic breccia and coarser conglomerate materials and $\mathord{\sim}187~\mathrm{m}$ into the igneous basement. Unfortunately, the targeted depth of $350\;\mathrm{m}$ into basement could not be reached because the drill string became irretrievably stuck in the rubbly volcaniclastic breccias with cobble-sized fragments of basaltic lava lobes. This required the hole to be abandoned at 232.9 meters below seafloor (mbsf) with no attempted downhole logging.  

The recovered sequence of volcanic and sedimentary rocks (Fig. F12) covers the latter part of the constructional phase of the seamount at Site U1372, a brief subaerial phase, and its final subsidence below sea level, as evidenced by the overlying sedimentary rocks. From the bottom up, the sequence starts with a hyaloclastite-rich sequence, indicative of submarine explosive volcanism of alkali basalt composition. Over time this changed to a shallow-marine and subaerial eruption environment, as evidenced by oxidized red-brown peperitic flow tops and the more massive lava flows on top of the volcanic basement. An erosional unconformity was found on top of the volcanic basement, overlain by a bluish-gray basalt conglomerate likely deposited in a nearby rocky shore environment of a volcanic island emerging in the Cretaceous. This early sediment cover predominantly consists of basalt breccia and contains a single horizon of foraminiferal limestone of late Campanian to early Maastrichtian age. These breccias likely formed in neritic to hemipelagic shallow-water conditions and are themselves unconformably overlain by early Pliocene to Holocene foraminiferal ooze, which is evidence for a return to sedimentation in a deep pelagic environment.  

# Lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy  

Two stratigraphic units predominantly composed of sedimentary deposits were recognized at the top of Hole U1372A (Fig. F12A). Stratigraphic Unit I extends to 13.50 mbsf and represents the youngest record of pelagic sedimentation on top of the seamount. Its lower boundary is defined by the first occurrence downhole of consolidated basalt breccia in Unit II. Unit I is composed of unconsolidated sandy foraminiferal ooze with local occurrences of reworked glass and pumice fragments. Analysis of grain morphology and paleontological observations indicate influence of strong oceanic currents during deposition of the unit. Occurrences of pumice and fresh glass fragments suggest that the sandy foraminiferal ooze includes a minor tephra component, most likely derived from the nearby Tonga-Kermadec volcanic arc. Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminiferal assemblages from Unit I are typically late Pleistocene to Holocene, mid-Pleistocene, and late Miocene–early Pleistocene in age.  

Unit II extends from 13.50 to 45.58 mbsf and represents an older sedimentary deposit, which we interpret to have formed under relatively shallow, neritic to hemipelagic water conditions. Its lower boundary is defined by the first downhole occurrence of lava flows in the volcanic basement. Unit II is composed of a basalt breccia (Fig. F13A) and conglomerate, with a minor interval of foraminiferal limestone that includes a small number of Mn encrustments and inoceramid shell fragments. Petrographic description shows that the composition of the basalt clasts is similar to that of volcanic deposits in the underlying volcanic basement. Five stratigraphic subunits were defined based on clast angularity and composition of the inter-cobble and boulder matrix. From top to bottom, Unit II is composed of a multicolor basalt breccia (Subunit IIA); a foraminiferal limestone with basalt clasts, manganese encrustments, and abundant inoceramid shell fragments (Subunit IIB); a multicolor basalt breccia (Subunit IIC); a multicolor basalt conglomerate (Subunit IID); and finally a coarse bluish-gray basalt conglomerate deposited on top of volcanic basement (Subunit IIE). Bioclasts of shallow-water origin (calcareous algae and annelids; Fig. F14A) and basalt clasts occur throughout Unit II. However, clast roundness and the amount of shallow-water bioclasts increase with depth, whereas the amount of planktonic fossils (foraminifers and calcispheres) decreases. Repeated occurrences of inoceramid shell fragments and foraminifers in the consolidated micrites and limestone of Unit II provide preliminary age estimates ranging from early Paleogene to Cretaceous (Fig. F14B). Because the breccias and conglomerates are dominantly of igneous origin and are mostly composed of aphyric and olivine-phyric basaltic cobbles and boulders, Unit II is surmised to represent a nearby rocky shore environment of a Cretaceous volcanic island. Interestingly, the entire sedimentary sequence of the late Paleogene and early Neogene is missing in Hole U1372A, and Unit II therefore seemingly is unconformably overlain by Unit I.  

# Igneous petrology  

Below the sedimentary succession of Units I and II, a $187~\mathrm{m}$ section of volcanic rocks was penetrated from 45.6 mbsf to the bottom of Hole U1372A at 232.6 mbsf (Fig. F12B). The igneous basement section of the hole can be divided broadly into an upper ( $83\mathrm{~m~}$ thick) part consisting of lava flows and a lower ( $104~\mathrm{m}$ thick) part mostly composed of volcaniclastic rocks. These lava flows of Units III–X range from aphyric to highly olivine-phyric. Flows in the topmost $27.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of the succession (to 63.7 mbsf) have peperitic tops, implying interaction between lava and carbonate mud, whereas those in the following $28.7\textrm{m}$ (to $92.4~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) have scoriaceous tops. Together with the occurrence of oxidized flow tops, these lava flows likely erupted subaerially or in very shallow marine conditions.  

The first downhole appearance of hyaloclastic material in Unit VI, which contains altered glass between two lava flows at $92.4~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , marks a change to submarine conditions. Volcaniclastic rocks dominate the succession from 128.9 to 228.4 mbsf in Units XI–XVI. The volcaniclastic deposits can be divided into seven individual eruptive packages on the basis of the phenocryst content of the basaltic clasts. Three of these packages (Units XII, XIV, and XV) were separated from their underlying packages by short intervals (0.13, 0.16, and $3.3\textrm{m}$ , respectively) of vitric-lithic volcanic sandstone. In all cases the sandstone was inferred to form the basal part of the overlying package, either through similarity of phenocryst abundance (Units XIV and XV) or through a graded contact (Unit XII). Within the volcaniclastic units no unequivocal pillow lavas or lava lobes were recovered, but several intervals of basalt included fragments with curved surfaces, glassy selvages, and a hint of radial vesicle trains. In a few cases small pods may have been recovered that have delicate lobate lava contacts, indicating that they may have been emplaced in situ within the volcaniclastic deposits and were not displaced much afterward (Fig. F13B). Drilling terminated in Unit XVII, a thick ( $4.3\textrm{m}$ penetrated), massive, and essentially unaltered olivine-augite-plagioclase-phyric basalt lava flow.  

The igneous rocks in Hole U1372A typically have phenocryst assemblages of either olivine, olivine $^+$ plagioclase $^+$ augite, or plagioclase $^+$ augite (Fig. F15). Olivine phenocrysts have been found throughout all basement units and also in the basaltic clasts of the breccias and conglomerates of Unit II. Pyroxene phenocrysts and microphenocrysts are always titaniferous (Fig. F15D). Olivine is present in the groundmass in several of the upper series of lava flows but not in those from the lower part of the succession, implying an increase in alkalinity with time. The presence of titanaugite shows that these rocks are not tholeiitic.  

# Alteration petrology  

The entire igneous section in Hole U1372A has undergone various degrees of secondary alteration by low-temperature water-rock interaction and weathering, ranging from slight to complete alteration. Two main intervals showing different dominant colors of alteration (Fig. F16) can be directly related to the oxidation state of the alteration processes. Down to 90 mbsf the volcanic basement has a dominantly reddish alteration color, pointing toward an oxidizing environment under likely subaerial or shallow submarine conditions. From 90 to 232 mbsf the alteration becomes more greenish, pointing toward more reducing conditions related to a deeper submarine environment.  

Typically, basaltic lava flow units are more fresh and only moderately altered. In many cases fresh olivine phenocrysts (Fig.F15A–F15C) were encountered, as well as zones with fresh volcanic glass, in particular in the hyaloclastites of Units VI and XII (Fig. F15B, F15C). Primary magmatic plagioclase and augite are generally well preserved, both as phenocrysts and in the groundmass. Plagioclase shows only minor alteration to sericite or illite in some rocks but is characteristically fresh. Augite is almost always unaltered (Fig. F15D). Usually, olivine is completely altered to iddingsite and Fe oxyhydroxide in the uppermost $90\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hole, except for a few intervals where fresh to moderately altered olivine was recovered. Olivine is absent in Units VII–XV from 90 to ${\sim}200~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , where mostly aphyric basalts were recovered. From $\mathord{\sim}200$ to 232 mbsf the original olivine phenocrysts largely have been replaced by green clay, serpentine, Fe oxyhydroxide, and carbonates (calcite/magnesite). Throughout Hole U1372A three main groups of alteration phases were distinguished: carbonates (Mg calcite and siderite), clay minerals (saponite, nontronite, glauconite, montmorillonite, and celadonite), and other secondary phases (e.g., zeolite, iddingsite, glauconite, Fe oxyhydroxide, and pyrite). Although these rocks have a relatively high porosity and often open void space, vesicles (if filled) and veins are filled with carbonates, clay minerals, and zeolites.  

# Structural geology  

Structural features at Site U1372A are veins, vein networks, joints, fractures, aligned vesicles, and geopetal structures. Fractures and veins are relatively common in the upper lava flow Units III–X but are rare to absent in volcaniclastic units lower in the succession that must have deformed relatively uniformly via compaction. Veins that are present within the volcaniclastic units are concentrated along unit boundaries. Several of the lava flows (particularly in the subaerial portion above $92\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ ) display moderate to strong magmatic flow alignment in an approximately horizontal direction, including the elongation and alignment of titanomagnetite. Geopetal structures (Fig. F13B) in the upper part of the sequence are all horizontal, indicating that the drilled succession has been tilted neither by partial flank collapse nor by the incipient subduction of Canopus Guyot into the Tonga-Kermadec Trench.  

# Geochemistry  

Major and trace element analysis of the igneous rocks by inductively coupled plasma– atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) indicates that alteration has not obscured magmatic signatures significantly, with the exception of $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ in some samples and CaO in two samples. The data indicate that most samples are alkalic basalt, although several are transitional basalt. Their compositions overlap those measured for dredge samples from other sites along the Louisville Seamount Trail but cover a smaller range of variation. Nevertheless, a sizeable range of compositions is present, with $\mathrm{Mg}$ numbers ranging from 34.9 to 73.5 and Ni abundances ranging from 46 to $472\;\mathrm{ppm}$ , yet the Zr/Ti ratio shows a lack of significant downhole variation (Fig. F17). Two samples appear to contain excess olivine phenocrysts. Much of the chemical variation in the other samples appears to be explainable as a product of variable amounts of crystal fractionation involving olivine and lesser amounts of clinopyroxene and plagioclase. If so, the data imply a rather large total range in the amount of crystal fractionation. In general, the Site U1372 basalts are similar to oceanic island lavas elsewhere and dredge samples from the Louisville Seamount Trail (Fig. F18). No distinction between shield and postshield stages of volcanism can be made on the basis of the ICP-AES results for Site U1372.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property data sets correlate well with the primary distinctions between the sedimentary sequence (Units I–II), units dominated by lava flows (Units III–X and XVII), and volcaniclastic intervals dominated by hyaloclastites (Units XI–XVI). The transition from oxidative alteration in the uppermost $90\;\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1372A to more green alteration indicative of more reducing submarine conditions is reflected in a gradual change from positive $a^{\star}$ color reflectance values to negative values downhole (Fig. F16A). Volcaniclastic Units XII and XV, in particular, show markedly lower density, $P$ -wave velocity, and magnetic susceptibility and higher porosity than the surrounding units. Unit XV is also distinctive, with larger $a^{\star}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{b}}^{\star}$ color reflectance values and an uphole-increasing trend in natural gamma ray counts that contrasts with very low values in Unit XVI, below.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of archive halves from Cores 330- U1372A-4R through 38R was measured using the cryogenic magnetometer at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals (Fig. F19). The intensity measured spans a very broad range, from $3\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{A/m}$ to $39\;\mathrm{A/m}$ (median $=1.7\;\mathrm{A/m}$ ), with the lowest values associated with volcaniclastic units. Most of the lava flows and a few volcaniclastic sequences also have relatively high magnetic coercivities, as reflected in the high median destructive field (MDF) values, indicating that a strong peak alternating field is required to demagnetize these rock types. This in turn suggests that the majority of the lithologies have retained their original remanent magnetization. Pronounced susceptibility variations mainly reflect variations in magnetic mineral content between various lava flows, volcanic breccias, and more fine grained volcaniclastic sediment. The experiments carried out show that using a nonmagnetic core barrel and avoiding magnafluxing the drill pipe and collars during Expedition 330 had a positive influence on data quality because there is evidence for a minimal amount of drilling-induced magnetic overprinting on the core samples.  

The remanent magnetization directions were calculated and filtered using an automated procedure consisting of typically 6–8 demagnetization steps for 3393 measurements carried out at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals on the archive halves. This automatic technique selected the best-fit direction based on the scatter of the data, the percentage of the remanence used in the calculation, and whether the resulting direction is likely to represent the primary magnetization. This fitting procedure allowed us to identify 1387 intervals with the most reliable magnetization directions (Fig. F20). The results show a downhole pattern of negative (normal polarity) inclinations in multiple lava flows. These inclinations are usually consistent with stepwise alternating-field (AF) and thermal demagnetization results from 100 discrete samples (Fig. F21).  

Documentation of the paleolatitude of Site U1372 at Canopus Guyot requires a sufficient number of flow units to provide a robust estimate of the time-averaged geomagnetic field at the site. In addition, these units must also be in situ, or the effects of later tilting or reorientation must be quantifiable from independent information. The presence of predominantly volcaniclastic material in Units XI–XVI and the limited core recovery in this interval make the recognition of in situ lava flow units challenging. In total, 81 lithologic units were defined for the basement sequence in Hole U1372A on the basis of petrographic description. Approximately 20 of these units are in situ cooling units. Even though directions from the conglomerates, breccias, and hyaloclastite units are more scattered in their inclinations, reflecting the fact that some of the basalt pieces recovered from these intervals are random breccia or conglomerate clasts, several of these intervals may in fact represent in situ lava flows and pods. This would further increase the number of flow units that can be used for determining the paleolatitude of Canopus Guyot around 75–77 Ma. Shore-based studies may provide additional constraints for whether these intercalated units are indeed in situ, time-independent cooling units.  

# Microbiology  

Fifteen whole-round samples were collected for microbiological analysis from more altered rocks and rocks with higher porosities, including unconsolidated sediments (2), volcanoclastic breccias (3), and basaltic lava flows (10). These samples cover nearly all lithologic units recovered from Hole U1372A. All samples were preserved for shore-based DNA analysis, cell counting analysis, and $\updelta^{34}\mathrm{S}$ and $\delta^{13}\cal C$ isotope analysis. Four samples were used to inoculate culturing experiments with up to 10 different types of cultivation media, and one sample was collected for shipboard analysis to test for possible contamination via fluorescent microsphere analysis.  

# Site U1373  

Rigil Guyot is one of the older seamounts in the Louisville Seamount Trail with an age of ${\sim}73\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , only a few million years younger than the Canopus and Osbourn Guyots to the northwest (Fig. F1). This seamount is located at $28.6^{\circ}\mathrm{S}.$ , $173.3^{\circ}\mathrm{W}$ and is part of a small cluster of two guyots and one small seamount to the south (Fig. F22). Rigil Guyot itself consists of a single volcanic center that is $40\,\mathrm{km}$ long and $36\,\mathrm{km}$ wide and has two small, possibly posterosional pedestals on the western portion of its summit. During Expedition 330 two sites were drilled on the summit platform of Rigil Guyot: Site U1373 was placed close to the northern shelf edge at $1447.0\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth, and Site U1374 was placed on the western rift zone at $1559.0\,\mathrm{m}$ below sea level (mbsl) (Fig. F22). At Site U1373, no soft sediment was present and a hardground entry was made using the RCB, followed by coring into a ${\sim}34\mathrm{~m~}$ cover of consolidated sediments and late-stage volcanic lava flows and, beneath that, $\sim\!32\textrm{m}$ into igneous basement. Because reentry using a free-fall funnel failed, Hole U1373A had to be abandoned at only 65.7 mbsf. No downhole logging was carried out.  

The short sequence of volcanic and sedimentary rocks recovered at Site U1373 (Fig. F23) is part of the subaerial phase in the life cycle of Rigil Guyot, characterized by latestage volcanism and erosion in a shallow-marine or beach environment. In contrast to Sites U1372 and U1374, the absence of volcaniclastic deposits containing submarine hyaloclastite reinforces the observation that all Site U1373 lava flow units formed during a later subaerial period following the constructional “island” phase of Rigil Guyot. From the bottom up, the sequence begins with a massive inflated lava flow of basaltic composition at least $22\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, followed by a series of thinner lava flows, all of which have blocky peperitic or brecciated flow tops. Only a very thin cover of sediment overlays the igneous basement because sedimentation was interrupted by the eruption of three auto-brecciated basalt lava flows. The conglomerates, breccias, and lava flows that make up the sediment cover are likely formed by “catastrophic” emplacement of two debris flow deposits during a late-stage volcanic period. In contrast to Site U1372 on Canopus Guyot and Site U1374 on the western flank of Rigil Guyot, no evidence for subsidence or any other eustatic change was found at Site U1373. No significant sequence of soft pelagic sediment was encountered, but only a small sample of sand- to granule-sized cuttings with remnants of modern nannofossil and foraminiferal fauna was recovered. This suggests that all pelagic sediment deposited since the Cretaceous has been removed from the seamount summit plain by strong subbottom ocean currents.  

# Lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy  

Units I and III at the top of Hole U1373A consist of sediments, whereas the intermediary Unit II is predominantly composed of auto-brecciated basalt lava flows with two minor sedimentary interbeds (Fig. F23A). Unit I extends to 9.60 mbsf and is divided into three subunits. Subunit IA is composed of a $15\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick multicolor polymict bioclast basalt conglomerate. Cement textures and composition of the bioclasts (planktonic foraminifers, calcispheres, sponge spicules, echinoderms, annelids, algae, bryozoans, and bivalves) indicate that deposition happened in a shallow-marine environment. Subunit IB is composed of a $2.51\;\mathrm{m}$ thick matrix-supported brown basalt breccia with a few shallow-marine bioclasts (Fig. F24A). The conglomerate has a heterogeneous clast composition and includes a calcareous-clayey matrix. It was interpreted as a mudflow deposit emplaced in a marine shallow-water environment. Subunit IC is a $0.39\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick multicolor bioclast basalt conglomerate similar to Subunit IA.  

Unit II is a predominantly late-stage volcanic interval that is $6.10~\mathrm{m}$ thick and includes two ${<}50\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick sedimentary deposits between three lava flows. The sedimentary deposits consist of fossil-free, heterolithic, multicolor basalt breccias, which were interpreted as proximal debris flows.  

Unit III is another sedimentary interval that has been divided into four subunits. Subunit IIIA is a $1.37\textrm{m}$ thick multicolor bioclast-rich basalt conglomerate similar in terms of composition and environment of deposition to Subunits IA and IC. Subunit IIIB is composed of a $6.73~\mathrm{m}$ thick, well-sorted, multicolor bioclast-rich basalt conglomerate with distinctive cross-bedding and bedding structures and a heterogeneous assemblage of basalt clasts. Cement textures, fossil assemblages, and sedimentary structures indicate that Subunit IIIB was likely deposited in a beach environment. Subunit IIIC is composed of a $5.37\textrm{m}$ thick multicolor bioclast basalt conglomerate and a bluish-gray basalt conglomerate. This subunit is believed to have been deposited in a shallow-marine environment. Subunit IIID includes a $4.73\;\mathrm{m}$ thick, matrixsupported, dark multicolor basalt breccia devoid of bioclasts, which we interpreted as a matrix-supported debris flow deposit. Similar sediments were found as interbeds in the underlying volcanic basement sequence.  

Thin section investigations of microfossils were conducted on consolidated samples from Units I–III, but no age-diagnostic species could be identified (Fig. F25). Nonetheless, macrofossils of Flamingostrea sp. were found in Subunit IIIB, leading to a preliminary age for Subunit IIIB of latest Cretaceous to Miocene.  

# Igneous petrology  

Hole U1373A penetrated a total of $38.4\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous rocks comprising a $6.1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sequence of volcanic breccia (including three auto-brecciated volcanic flows), which makes up Unit II within the sedimentary cover, and $32.3~\mathrm{m}$ of igneous basement from the base of the sedimentary succession at 33.9 mbsf to the bottom of the hole at 66.2 mbsf (Fig. F23B). Sedimentary Units I and III are breccias and conglomerates composed largely of pebble- to boulder-sized basaltic clasts in a sandy matrix. Some basaltic clasts in Unit I have lobate margins with delicate protrusions and therefore cannot have been transported far from their source of origin. They may indicate syndepositional interaction of lava and sediment (i.e., peperite), implying a later phase of volcanism simultaneous with the formation of Unit I (Fig. F24B). Coarseclastic sedimentation was interrupted by the emplacement of aphyric to olivinephyric lava flows of Unit II. These are almost entirely brecciated, but in places the fragments appear to fit together in a jigsaw-fit texture. This is a common feature of “blocky peperites” and is widely thought to reflect in situ quench fragmentation. The top of the volcanic basement in Unit IV consists of subaerial lava flows of highly olivine-titanaugite-phyric basalt with very well preserved olivine phenocrysts. Unit V consists of aphyric basalt that was also erupted mostly in a subaerial environment, but the base of the lowest flow shows peperitic mingling with sediment, as do the flows of Unit VI and the top of Unit VII. Drilling stopped within a $>\!22\mathrm{~m~}$ thick inflated sheet flow in Unit VII composed of fine-grained aphyric basalt (Fig. F26A).  

The volcanological features of the igneous sequence drilled at Site U1373 suggest lava flowing into an area where water or water-saturated sediment is present but not fully submarine. The emplacement of lava flows in an intertidal or fluvial environment provides a plausible scenario that is entirely consistent with sedimentologic observations. The presence of titanaugite and olivine-titanaugite phenocryst assemblages is characteristic of alkalic basalts (Fig. F26B–26D).  

# Alteration petrology  

The igneous basement section recovered from Hole U1373A has undergone secondary alteration by low-temperature water-rock interactions or weathering. The alteration of the volcanic rocks, including basalts and hyaloclastite deposits, ranges from slightly to highly altered (between $10\%$ and $95\%$ ). The $>\!22\;\mathrm{m}$ thick massive basaltic lava flow (Unit VII) is relatively well preserved ( $10\%$ of alteration). Two main intervals, showing different dominant colors of alteration, can be identified and directly related to the oxidation state during the alteration processes (Fig. F27). From the top of Hole U1373A to ${\sim}45$ mbsf the sequence has a dominantly reddish alteration color, pointing toward oxidizing environment under likely subaerial conditions. From ${\sim}45$ to 66.2 mbsf the nearly fresh basalts are faintly greenish, pointing to more reducing conditions related to the submarine environment of emplacement.  

Primary magmatic plagioclase and augite are generally well preserved, both as phenocrysts and in the groundmass. Plagioclase shows minor alteration to sericite/illite in some rocks, but is generally well preserved as well. Augite is almost always unaltered. Olivine is typically completely altered to iddingsite, hematite, and Fe oxyhydroxide in the uppermost $35\;\mathrm{m}$ of hole. From ${\sim}35$ to 66.2 mbsf the original olivine phenocrysts are largely replaced by green clay, Fe oxyhydroxide, or carbonates (calcite/magnesite). Fresh olivine minerals were found in a Type 7 clast in Unit I, and moderately fresh olivine phenocrysts occur in Units IV and V. No fresh volcanic glass was encountered in Hole U1373A. Throughout Hole U1373A three main groups of alteration phases can be distinguished: carbonates $\mathrm{Mg}$ calcite and aragonite), clay minerals (saponite, nontronite, glauconite, montmorillonite, and celadonite), and other secondary phases (e.g., zeolites, iddingsite, Fe oxyhydroxide, goethite, and pyrite/chalcopyrite). Numerous vesicles and veins were observed, many of which are filled with carbonates and clay minerals and other secondary minerals.  

# Structural geology  

Structural features observed at Site U1373 are generally similar to those at Sites U1372 and U1374 in terms of number and types of fractures, veins, magmatic foliations, and geopetals. Geopetal structures are horizontal, indicating that this part of the seamount has not tilted since its formation. Fractures and veins are common in the basaltic lava flows. Fractures are especially abundant in the lowermost Unit VII, a $1>\!22\,\mathrm{m}$ thick massive lava flow with up to 11 fractures/ $\mathbf{\dot{m}}$ , more than twice the density observed in other fractured rocks at Sites U1372, U1373, and U1374. Unit VII also has moderate to strong macro- and microscopic magmatic foliation with directions ranging from subhorizontal to subvertical, indicating that this thick flow likely underwent several episodes of lava injection and flow inflation (Fig. F26A).  

# Geochemistry  

Igneous samples from Site U1373 that were analyzed chemically are closely similar in both major and trace element composition to basalts from Site U1372. With the exception of one highly altered lava flow in Unit II, Site U1373 samples are only moderately altered, with weight loss on ignition (LOI) values of $<\!2.40\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Total alkalis $\mathrm{(Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ concentrations indicate that all Site U1373 samples are alkalic basalts, except one sample classified as transitional basalt. This sample is a highly olivine-augite-phyric basalt clast from Unit I with high MgO and $\mathrm{Ni}$ and likely hosting excess olivine phenocrysts (Fig. F28A, F28B). Its liquid composition thus may have been slightly more alkalic than the composition of the bulk rock. In addition, two other high- $\cdot\mathrm{MgO}$ , highly olivine-augite-phyric basalts were analyzed, both from Unit IV, and they too appear to contain excess olivine. Evidence that all three high-MgO samples contain excess augite is seen in the variation of Sc with $\mathrm{MgO}$ and in their CaO contents and $\mathrm{CaO/Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ ratios, which are higher than those of their high-MgO counterparts at Site U1372. Overall, Site U1373 data largely overlap with the data arrays of Site U1372 in diagrams of MgO vs. $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}.$ , $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ , and $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ and in diagrams plotting incompatible elements $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ vs. Sr and Y (Fig. F29). Likewise, the $\mathrm{Zr/Ti}$ ratio is within the same restricted range as that found at Site U1372 (Fig. F28C). Despite the general compositional similarity of Site U1373 and U1372 basalts, the two high-MgO samples from Unit IV at Site U1373 have relatively high Sr and Ba contents for their $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ values (Fig. F29). This characteristic does not appear to be caused by alteration, and thus these samples may represent a slightly different magma type than that represented by Site U1372 basalts and the majority of Site U1373 basalts.  

# Physical properties  

The different physical property data sets from Site U1373 samples are mutually consistent and tend to correlate primarily with distinctions between conglomerate units, brecciated lava flows, peperitic basalts, and massive basalts. The brecciated lava flows of Unit II and the peperitic basalts found in Units V, VI, and VII exhibit similar, more consistent physical property values and trends, whereas conglomeritic Units I and III exhibit varying properties depending on the proportions of matrix and clasts. The massive basalt flows of Units IV and VII have consistently high densities, $P$ -wave velocities, porosities, and natural gamma radiation (NGR) but show moderate internal variation in magnetic susceptibility and color reflectance. The variation in color reflectance agrees well with observed alteration colors across all units.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The NRM of archive halves from Hole U1373A cores was measured using the cryogenic magnetometer at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals (Fig. F30). The intensities range from $0.08\,\mathrm{A/m}$ to $20.46\;\mathrm{A/m}$ (median $=2.99\ \mathrm{A/m})$ ), with the highest values exclusively associated with stratigraphic Unit VII at the base of the hole. Compared to Site U1372 on Canopus Guyot, the basaltic rocks of Site U1373 have more variable MDF values, indicating that in some cases only a small peak alternating field (e.g., $11.6\,\mathrm{mT}$ for lithologic Unit 15 in stratigraphic Unit VII) was required to demagnetize these rock types. Other lava flows, however, retained their original remanent magnetization much better, in particular in Units IV–VI (lithologic Units 6–13) that have MDF values of $34.9~\mathrm{mT}$ and higher. The more stable nature of these remanent magnetizations is evident in the demagnetization data of both archive-half pieces and discrete samples (Figs. F31, F32). Low-coercivity components were determined not to be related to drilling-induced magnetic overprinting, which would result in a subvertical component of magnetization that was not observed, suggesting that using a nonmagnetic core barrel during Expedition 330 had a positive influence on data quality. Pronounced susceptibility variations seem to reflect variations in magnetic mineral content between lava flows, volcanic breccias, and also within individual peperitic lava flow tops, as shown for Unit VI and the uppermost part of Unit VII, in particular (Fig. F30D).  

The remanent magnetization directions were calculated and filtered using an automated procedure consisting of typically 6–8 demagnetization steps for 1436 measurements carried out at $2~\mathrm{cm}$ intervals on the archive-half cores. This automatic technique selected the best-fit direction based on the scatter of the data, the percentage of the remanence used in the calculation, and whether the resulting direction was likely to represent the primary magnetization. This fitting procedure allowed us to identify 576 intervals with the most reliable magnetization directions (Fig. F30). These best-fit directions are consistent with stepwise AF and thermal demagnetization results from 34 discrete samples (Fig. F32). The range of inclinations recorded in Hole U1373A is broader and generally shallower than that found in Hole U1372A, with a downhole pattern of mostly negative (normal polarity) inclinations. The dispersed inclination distribution for Hole U1373A may result from including a large number of positive inclinations (reversed polarity) recorded in the uppermost units, comprising sediments and volcanic breccias, but also by including measurements from Unit VII, which is characterized by lower magnetic stability.  

Good agreement between archive-half and discrete sample data suggests it might be possible to obtain reliable inclinations for 10 in situ cooling units. Augmentation of this data set with results from Site U1374 on the western rift zone of Rigil Guyot is needed to increase the number of in situ cooling units to cancel out secular variations and to achieve a higher precision for the inclination estimates for this ${\sim}73\ \mathrm{Ma}$ seamount in the Louisville Seamount Trail.  

# Microbiology  

Five whole-round samples ( $5{-}10\;\mathrm{cm}$ long) were collected from Site U1373 for microbiological analysis, including samples from sedimentary conglomerates (one), volcaniclastic breccias (one), and aphyric basaltic lava flows (three). All samples were preserved for shore-based cell counting, and four were preserved for shore-based DNA analyses and $\updelta^{34}\mathrm{S}$ and $\delta^{13}C$ analyses. One sample was used to inoculate culturing experiments with six different types of cultivation media, one sample was collected for shipboard analysis of contamination via fluorescent microsphere analysis, and one sample was used to set up a stable isotope addition bioassay. Fluorescent microsphere counts were practically zero, indicating that the microspheres were not able to penetrate the core and, therefore, that the chance for microbial contamination is low.  

# Site U1374  

Site U1374 was the third site drilled during Expedition 330 (Table T3) and the second of two sites drilled on Rigil Guyot (Sites U1373 and U1374). This site targeted one of the older seamounts with an age of ${\sim}73\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , only a few million years younger than Site U1372 on Canopus Guyot, to the northwest. This drill site was placed on the western rift zone of this guyot, ${\sim}10.3~\mathrm{km}$ west of Site U1373 and west of two small, possibly posterosional pedestals on the western portion of its summit (Fig. F22). Site U1374 was drilled at 1559.0 mbsl. About ${\sim}6.6\;\mathrm{m}$ of sandy foraminiferal ooze was present, and drilling at Site U1374 was started using a gravity-push approach with little or no rotation using the RCB. Following careful coring of the soft sediment cover, coring continued into an older ${\sim}10.1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sediment cover consisting of consolidated volcanic sandstone, a thin layer of limestone, and a grayish basalt conglomerate. Following drilling into this sediment cover, ${\sim}505\mathrm{~m~}$ of igneous basement was cored. Coring was particularly successful, with a record-breaking $88\%$ average recovery in the igneous basement. Operations were completed with a downhole logging series consisting of a triple combo run, two runs with the FMS-sonic tool string, one run with the UBI, and two runs with the third-party GBM.  

As with Site U1373, the upper sedimentary and volcanic sequence at Site U1374 (Fig. F33) is part of a subaerial phase in the life cycle of Rigil Guyot. Both are characterized by late-stage volcanism, strong erosion, and sedimentation in a shallowmarine or beach environment. Because of the deep penetration at Site U1374, a deeper submarine series of sediments and volcanic rocks was also recovered on this western rift zone location. From the bottom up, the sequence thus starts with submarine volcanism, producing a predominant series of volcanic breccias with an increasing number of in situ lava lobes and more massive flows upward in the sequence. This series is occasionally interrupted by the deposition of fine-grained volcanic sandstones, particularly at the top of the volcanic breccia units, and in the bottom $186\;\mathrm{m}$ by a series of intrusive sheets or dikes of mainly aphyric basalt. The entire lower sequence has a normal magnetic polarity, which above ${\sim}45$ mbsf alternates with a package of reversely magnetized lava flows and volcaniclastics. This alternation may indicate a break in volcanic activity and a simultaneous progression to a shallow-marine environment and, in its later stages, a subaerial eruptive environment. This progression is seen in the various breccia types recovered at this site, which range from green hyaloclastite breccia with frothy basaltic clasts (marine) through blocky breccia (shallower marine) to scoriaceous (near sea level or subaerial). A dramatic increase in the thickness of the sedimentary intervals above $\mathord{\sim}150$ mbsf likely indicates the point at which parts of Rigil Guyot started to emerge above sea level and erosion proceeded more rapidly. Both petrography and geochemistry show that the magma that erupted at Site U1374 was alkalic throughout the entire drilled interval.  

# Lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy  

Sediment at Site U1374 occurs in the uppermost sedimentary cover of Rigil Guyot, in three intervals within a predominantly volcanic basement, and in the basalt breccias (volcanic or sedimentary in origin) as finer-grained, interclast infill deposits, thinbedded sedimentary layers, or peperitic intervals. Fourteen stratigraphic units and subunits were defined in the uppermost $116.45\mathrm{~m~}$ of the succession, and five sediment interbeds were identified in the lower igneous basement sequence on the basis of macro- and microscopic observations (Fig. F33).  

The uppermost part of the seamount ( $\mathrm{0}{-}6.64\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ includes a very young sedimentary cover (Unit I) composed of sandy foraminiferal ooze that was deposited in a pelagic environment on the flat-topped seamount. Identification of calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers shows that this unit formed recently in the Pleistocene–Holocene. An older sedimentary cover showing subhorizontal bedding (Unit II; 6.64–16.70 mbsf) includes five subunits from top to bottom. Subunit IIA is a multicolor volcanic sandstone with ferromanganese-phosphate encrustations at ${\sim}6.64$ mbsf (Fig. F34A). Subunit IIB (6.64–13.59 mbsf) is a layered monomict volcanic sandstone without fossils. Subunit IIC (13.59–15.05 mbsf) consists of late Maastrichtian bioturbated volcanic sandstone with abundant gastropods and shell fragments and rare possible ammonite fragments. Subunit IID (15.05–15.31 mbsf) is characterized by a highly condensed upper Campanian bioclast foraminiferal limestone with ferromanganese-phosphate encrustations and burrows filled with upper Maastrichtian volcanic sandstone (probably from Subunit IIC). And, finally, Subunit IIE (15.31–16.70 mbsf) comprises an upper Campanian (or older) basalt conglomerate with shallow-marine bioclasts (e.g., shell fragments, calcareous algae, and bryozoans) (Fig. F34B).  

The underlying volcanic sequence, starting at 16.70 mbsf, is composed of minor basalt lava flows and abundant basalt breccias. The inter-clast spaces in the basalt breccia are partly filled with finer grained basalt and volcanic sandstone with a local shallow-marine bioclast component. Three thick-bedded sedimentary intervals were identified between 37.60 and 116.45 mbsf. Unit VII (37.60–41.84 mbsf) is the first interval and is composed of a polymict basalt sandstone with abundant vitric fragments and only a few shallow-marine bioclasts, a layered volcanic sandstone with rare fossils, and a monomict basalt breccia with larger shallow-marine bioclasts. Unit IX (63.67–84.70 mbsf) is the second sedimentary interval and is devoid of fossils. It includes two polymict basalt breccias and an intermediary single interval of volcanic sandstone. The third sedimentary interval occurs at Unit XI (109.87–116.45 mbsf) and is composed of an upper volcanic sandstone with few bioclasts and a lower grayish basalt conglomerate with abundant shallow-marine fossils. Volcanic deposits below 116.45 mbsf include only minor occurrences of thin-bedded layers of grainsupported, poorly sorted basalt sandstone breccias interpreted as sediment intervals. The last occurrences of shallow-water fossils in Hole U1374A were found in two intervals of sedimentary basalt breccia between 256.75–257.49 and 290.32–291.27 mbsf. These intervals correlate to downhole changes in the nature of the volcanic deposits to decidedly submarine. Contrary to the subhorizontal bedding in the sedimentary cover, bedding orientations in the volcanic basement are characterized by moderately dipping ${\sim}20^{\circ}{-}25^{\circ}$ values (Fig. F34C).  

Eight lithofacies were defined in the sedimentary cover and thicker sedimentary intervals of the volcanic basement, which permits overall characterization of the environment of deposition at Site U1374. The volcanic basement below 116.45 mbsf is interpreted to have been deposited in a submarine environment on the slope of a former oceanic island. Within this basement the lowermost occurrence of fossilbearing sediment at 291.27 mbsf possibly corresponds to the first-time shoaling of the island making up today’s Rigil Guyot. Higher within the sequence the volcanic interval between 116.45 and 16.70 mbsf is interpreted to have been deposited in a shallow-marine to subaerial environment on the slope of this former island. A major erosional surface likely occurs at 16.70 mbsf at the base of Unit II, as suggested by changes in the dip of sediment bedding between the volcanic basement and sediment cover, and is interpreted to be the result of summit erosion and the original flattening of the drilled guyot. The erosional surface is capped by a shallow-marine basalt conglomerate between 16.70 and 15.31 mbsf and a condensed interval with ferromanganese encrustations from 15.31 to 15.05 mbsf. The age of a limestone in this condensed interval of Subunit IID was assigned to the late Campanian and is interpreted to record the initial drowning of Rigil Guyot during the Maastrichtian (Fig. F35). The volcaniclastic sediment deposited on top of this limestone likely represents a record of posterosional volcanism in the latest Cretaceous, as suggested by the occurrence of ammonoid specimen fragments. A second (undated) condensed interval occurs at ${\sim}6.64$ mbsf and is capped by much younger Pleistocene pelagic sediment. This latter unconformity represents at least $50\;\mathrm{m}$ .y. of missing sediment.  

# Igneous petrology  

Hole U1374A on Rigil Guyot penetrated $474.89\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous rocks comprising a succession of volcaniclastic breccias capped by lava flows and intruded, in its lower part, by a suite of intrusive sheets or dikes. The igneous sequence (Fig. F33) was divided into 148 lithologic units, which were grouped into 15 stratigraphic units (Units III–VI, VIII, X, and XII–XIX). The basement succession also includes three 4.24, 21.03, and $6.59\;\mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary intervals (stratigraphic Units VII, IX, and XI). Magmatism recorded at Site U1374 started in a clearly submarine environment and, in the time interval considered here, progressed to a shallow-marine and then subaerial environment. This progression is clearly seen in the various breccia types recovered at this site (Fig. F34D–F34G). Abundant blocky breccia probably accumulated as talus deposits through the transportation downslope of volcaniclastic debris that was shed from the fronts of submarine lava flows. In other intervals scoriaceous breccias are probably the product of hydrovolcanic eruptions resulting from the interaction of magma with water (in a shallow submarine environment) or wet sediment, whereas toward the top of Hole U1374A the number of lava flows increases and peperites are found at both the bottom and top margins of the upper lava flow units. Distinct eruptive packages are often separated by intervals of background sedimentation, five of which were identified at Site U1374. A dramatic increase in the thickness of these intervals at Unit XI indicates the point at which parts of the seamount near Site U1374 emerged above sea level and erosion proceeded more rapidly, forming more extensive deposits of basalt conglomerates, basalt breccias, and volcanic sandstones. The phenocryst assemblage in the breccias and lava flows changed from plagioclase-dominated in the lower part of the succession (Units XIV–XIX) to olivine-dominated in the upper part (Units III– XIV), suggesting that the magmas became generally more basic with time (Fig. F36). The magma erupted at Site U1374 was alkalic throughout the drilled interval. The lower $186\;\mathrm{m}$ of the succession drilled in Hole U1374A is also intruded by intrusive sheets of aphyric basalt, which we interpret as dikes (Fig. F34H). Similar rocks were not encountered at higher levels, so these could have extended to levels higher than the present guyot surface, where they were eroded away, or have been truncated at a yet-unrecognized erosion surface higher in the succession.  

# Alteration petrology  

The entire section of Hole U1374A has undergone secondary alteration by low-temperature water-rock interactions or weathering. The alteration of the volcanic rocks ranges from slight to high $(5\%{-}95\%)$ , whereas several basaltic lava flows and intrusive sheets are relatively well preserved ( $10\%$ or less). Two main but overlapping alteration intervals were identified on the basis of different dominant alteration colors, which mainly are related to oxidation state during the alteration processes. From the top of Hole U1374A to $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf the sequence has dominantly reddish or brown alteration colors, indicative of oxidizing conditions in subaerial to transitional shallow-marine environments (Fig. F37). Deeper than 370 mbsf the basalt ranges from slightly to highly altered and is predominantly greenish in color, indicative of more reducing conditions related to the more submarine eruptive environment (Fig. F37). Occurrences of gray and relatively unaltered basalt were encountered throughout Hole U1374A.  

Plagioclase and augite are generally well preserved, both as phenocrysts and in the groundmass throughout the entire igneous portion of the core. Plagioclase shows minor alteration to sericite/illite in some rocks but is generally well preserved. Augite is almost always unaltered. Olivine is typically completely altered to iddingsite, hematite, carbonates, and Fe oxyhydroxide, but some sections in the core contain slightly to moderately altered olivine. Some olivine in altered rocks below $\mathord{\sim}370$ mbsf is replaced by green clay, Fe oxyhydroxide, or carbonates (calcite/magnesite). Throughout Hole U1374A three main groups of alteration phases can be distinguished: carbonates (Mg calcite), clay minerals (saponite, nontronite, and celadonite), and zeolites and other secondary phases (iddingsite, Fe oxyhydroxides, goethite, pyrite/chalcopyrite, and thaumasite). The types of zeolite vary from phillipsite in the upper portion of the hole to analcite and gmelinite at depth, apparently indicating a thermal alteration gradient. Furthermore, numerous vesicles, veins, and voids are mainly filled with carbonates and clay minerals below 300 mbsf and with zeolites below 380 mbsf.  

# Structural geology  

Structural features at Site U1374 are dominated by veins $(N=1229)$ ), vein networks $N=515$ , with 3225 individual veinlets), and fractures $N=356)$ ). Veins are found mostly within lava flows, although veins also occur in larger fragments within volcanic breccia units. The maximum vein width is $25~\mathrm{mm}$ , but most are considerably smaller, with average widths of $0.8~\mathrm{mm}$ . Fractures are also most common in lava units, especially the lowermost $14~\mathrm{m}$ of the hole, with ${>}14$ fractures/ $\mathbf{\dot{m}}$ recorded. Structural measurements were also undertaken for intervals with sedimentary bedding $N=46)$ ), 35 geopetals, 18 igneous contacts, 35 vesicle bands, and 80 cases of magmatic flow textures. The orientation of the sedimentary bedding changes significantly downhole from subhorizontal in Units I–II to dips of up to $20^{\circ}{-}25^{\circ}$ below 16.70 mbsf. All geopetal structures are horizontal (Fig. F35B), indicating that this part of Rigil Guyot has not been tilted since deposition of the geopetal infilling material. Excellent examples of baked contacts and chilled margins were recorded from $\sim\!335$ to 500 mbsf from a series of steeply dipping sheet intrusions or subvertical dikes. These dikes also contain steeply inclined vesicle bands or flow textures, which also indicate mostly near-vertical magma flow.  

# Geochemistry  

Major and trace element data for igneous samples from Site U1374 overlap considerably with data for Sites U1372 and U1373. However, Site U1374 samples tend to have slightly lower $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ at similar total alkali $\mathrm{(Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ contents and thus are slightly more alkalic as a group. A diagram of total alkalis vs. $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ shows that most Site U1374 samples are classified as alkalic basalts, but nearly one-third are basanite and tephrite. No transitional compositions were found, in contrast to Sites U1372 and U1373. Most of the Site U1374 samples are relatively evolved, with $\mathrm{MgO}$ concentrations between 2.78 and $8.54~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (Fig. F38). Major element and Sc variations indicate that olivine and clinopyroxene were the main mineralogical controls on magmatic differentiation. Incompatible element concentrations display somewhat greater overall variability relative to $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ than seen for Sites U1372 and U1373, consistent with greater variability in the amount of partial melting or in source composition at Site U1374 (Fig. F39). Despite the compositional overlap and close proximity of Sites U1373 and U1374 (which are located just $10.4\;\mathrm{km}$ apart on Rigil Guyot), the rocks from the two sites cannot be correlated and probably represent distinct eruptive events. Likewise, the intrusive sheets occurring in the deeper submarine interval at Site U1374 cannot be correlated with any specific lava flow or eruption package higher up in the drilled sequence.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property characterizations for samples recovered from Site U1374 show clear contrasts between unconsolidated sediments, massive basalts, and volcanic breccias. The intrusive sheets or dikes recovered in the bottommost $186\,\mathrm{m}$ have a characteristic physical property signature, distinct from the majority of the basalt flows, lobes, and clasts, and are marked by high NGR, magnetic susceptibility, density, and $P$ -wave velocity and low porosity. More subtle contrasts between olivine- and plagioclase-dominated units are observed in NGR and magnetic susceptibility. The downhole appearance of hyaloclastites at 327 mbsf is marked by a subtle decrease in $L^{\star}$ (lightness) and a more marked decrease in $P$ -wave velocity and an increase in porosity. The changes in both $P$ -wave velocity and porosity are more pronounced below $470\;\mathrm{mb}{\mathrm{sf}}_{1}$ , where a shift in color reflectance (Fig. F37) toward more green and yellow spectra is also observed, correlating with the occurrence of a high proportion of fragments of “frothy” basalt glass.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The NRM of the archive halves from the Hole U1374A cores was measured using the cryogenic magnetometer at $2\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals (Figs. F40, F41). The NRM intensities range from $10^{-3}$ to ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{A/m}$ (geometric mean $=0.82\,\mathrm{A/m})$ ), with the highest values associated with lava flows, intrusive sheets or dikes, and basalt clasts in the volcanic breccia/conglomerate units. Similar to Site U1372 on Canopus Guyot, but different from the basaltic rocks of Site U1373, the paleomagnetic measurements from the archive halves of Site U1374 in Rigil Guyot show typically high MDF values, indicating that the magnetizations were largely stable and a large peak alternating field was required to demagnetize these rocks. The stable nature of these remanent magnetizations is evident in the demagnetization data of both archive-half pieces and discrete samples, showing little evidence for drilling-induced remanent magnetization, likely because of using a nonmagnetic core barrel and avoiding magnafluxing the drill pipe during drilling. Several lithologic units (e.g., dikes or lava flows) and stratigraphic units are broadly associated with changes in NRM intensities or magnetic susceptibility, also evident from the GBM logs.  

The remanent magnetization directions were calculated and filtered using an automated procedure consisting of typically 6–8 demagnetization steps for 13,704 measurements carried out at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals on the archive-half cores. This automatic technique selected the best-fit direction based on the scatter of the data, the percentage of the remanence used in the calculation, and whether the resulting direction trends toward the origin of the Zijderveld demagnetization diagrams. This fitting procedure allowed us to identify 5497 intervals with reliable magnetization directions. These best-fit directions are consistent with stepwise AF and thermal demagnetization results from 236 discrete samples (Fig. F42). Both archive-half core and discrete sample data reveal normal polarity from ${\sim}45$ to 522 mbsf, which is remarkably consistent for long intervals containing a wide range of lithologies, including basaltic lava flows, dikes, and volcanic breccias. Both data sets also reveal a small interval of reversed polarity magnetization in the uppermost ${\sim}45\mathrm{~m~}$ of the hole. Interestingly, the range of inclinations recorded in Hole U1374A is narrower and generally slightly steeper than that found in Hole U1373A on Rigil Guyot, though statistically indistinguishable. Both sites also show a group of positive inclinations in their uppermost units, suggesting that sediments and volcanic breccias formed during the latest-stage volcanism and deposition on Rigil Guyot recorded a reversed polarity, in contrast to the normal polarity recorded during the earlier constructional phase of this seamount edifice.  

Nineteen in situ cooling units were recognized at Site U1374, providing a consistent estimate of its inclination during the formation of Rigil Guyot. Importantly, similar consistency is observed in many of the volcaniclastic units, especially in the lower half of the cored igneous basement, which provided inclination values similar to intercalated lava flows or lobes. In addition, many of the intrusive sheets intruding these volcaniclastic units also have comparable negative inclinations. The good agreement between both archive-half and discrete sample data and among the lava flows, volcanic breccias, and intrusive sheets at Site U1374 suggests that a reliable inclination estimate for Site U1374 is obtainable, particularly when combining these results with the 10 in situ and (likely) contemporary lava flows recovered at Site U1373. Further augmentation of this data set with inclination data from Site U1372 on Canopus Guyot may be considered necessary to increase the number of cooling units sampled in order to better average out secular variations.  

# Microbiology  

Twenty-nine whole-round samples (5–13 cm long) were collected for microbiological analysis at Site U1374. The lithologies of the collected samples include unconsolidated sediments (1), sedimentary conglomerate (2), volcaniclastic breccia (24), and aphyric basaltic lava flows (2). All samples were preserved for shore-based cell counting, DNA analyses, and $\updelta^{34}\mathrm{S}$ and $\delta^{13}C$ analyses. Eleven samples were used to inoculate culturing experiments with up to seven different types of cultivation media. Growth was detected in samples as deep as $400\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , with media targeting sulfur oxidizing bacteria and general heterotrophs. Five samples were used to set up stable isotope addition bioassays to determine rates of carbon and nitrogen utilization by subsurface microbes at Rigil Guyot. Two cores were seeded with fluorescent microspheres. Samples from these cores were collected for shipboard analysis of contamination via fluorescent microsphere counts, which revealed that microspheres are released into the drill fluid. However, all counts were reduced to zero after the three sterile seawater rinses that all microbiology whole-round samples were subjected to. This indicates that the microspheres were not able to penetrate into the whole-round samples, and therefore the chance for microbial contamination is low in these seamount samples.  

# Downhole logging and Göttingen Borehole Magnetometer  

Four tool strings were deployed in Hole U1374A on Rigil Guyot. Three of these tool strings took measurements of natural gamma ray radioactivity, density, neutron porosity, elastic wave velocity, and acoustic and resistivity images of the borehole. The fourth specialized tool string, the third-party GBM, measured three-component magnetic field, allowing in situ determination of the inclination and declination of the eruptive units in the drilled seamount formation. Measurement depths were adjusted to match across different logging runs, obtaining a wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF) scale. The logged depth interval for Hole U1374A was $128.1–520\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF.  

The downhole log measurements (resistivity, density, velocity, and neutron porosity) were used to identify nine log units in Hole U1374A: two in the section covered by the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) and seven in the volcanic sequences in the open hole interval (Fig. F43). Log Unit I (0–20 m WMSF) shows a spike in gamma ray coinciding with the sediment cover in the drilled sequence. Log Unit II (20–128.1 m WMSF) has generally low gamma ray values while still logging inside the drill pipe. Log Unit III $128.1–240\mathrm{~m~WMSF}$ ) exhibits fluctuating values for density, resistivity, porosity, and velocity and is the first unit below the end of the drill pipe. Log Unit IV (240–278 m  

WMSF) shows more consistent values for density, velocity, porosity, and resistivity. Log Unit V $(278{-}358\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF})$ is characterized at its top by a dramatic decrease in resistivity and velocity and an increase in porosity. The uppermost $\sim\!12\;\mathrm{m}$ of this unit also is characterized by one of the strongest magnetic anomaly patterns recorded with the GBM in both horizontal and vertical field components. Log Unit VI $358–380\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF) exhibits a marked decrease in density, resistivity, and velocity. Log Unit VII (380–469 m WMSF) has relatively consistent density values, higher stable resistivity values, lower porosity values, and higher velocity values. At the bottom of this unit the highest GBM magnetic anomaly was observed over a short interval of ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{m}$ , with an uncorrected vertical magnetic field anomaly of ${\sim}14,000\;\mathrm{nT}.$ Toward the bottom of the hole, log Unit VIII $(469{-}490\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{WMSF})$ is characterized by a significant decrease in resistivity, density, and velocity and an increase in porosity, and the lowest log Unit IX $(490\mathrm{~-}507\mathrm{~m~WMSF})$ ) shows a marked increase in density, velocity, and resistivity and a decrease in porosity. The magnetic intensities observed with the GBM are the lowest for these bottom two log units.  

The GBM was run twice in Hole U1374A, collecting high-quality three-component magnetic data in conjunction with the tool’s rotation history using three optical gyros mounted in the top of the instrument. Negative influences from strong magnetic remanent sources higher up in the tool string were successfully minimized by inserting a truly nonmagnetic aluminum sinker bar immediately above the GBM. At the onset of each deployment the initial orientation of the tool string relative to the Earth’s rotation axis was determined by aligning the GBM with the R/V JOIDES Resolution and then determining the ship’s heading using a newly installed GPS system. Together with the recorded rotation history of the GBM, the measured vector components then can be reoriented (postexpedition) and translated into geographic coordinates, allowing for in situ determination of inclinations and declinations in the seamount formation through modeling of the remanence directions. The uncorrected data appear to correlate very well with changes downhole in lithology, as observed in the recovered core and in the standard downhole logging data (Fig. F44). Examples of these are stratigraphic Unit XV, which can be clearly separated from the surrounding intervals in the magnetic data, and Unit XIX, where the magnetic readings of the vertical component drop considerably at ${\sim}460~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , coinciding with a change from an interval of hyaloclastites with a high abundance of scoriaceous “frothy” glass fragments to an interval of large jigsaw-fit clasts of aphyric basalt. Both uplog and downlog data are consistent with each other and between two independent runs. Further detailed investigations of the GBM data collected will focus on the separation and identification of the magnetic signals of the different in situ flow units and the determination of both inclination and declination of their NRM, with the intention of accurately determining the paleolatitude of the Louisville hotspot and its past virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) positions.  

To conclude, lithologic and structural features were successfully imaged with both the FMS-sonic and UBI tool strings. By combining the FMS and UBI data sets a complete picture of the borehole wall in terms of fractures, clast distribution, amount of alteration, and contrasts in both resistivity and “hardness” can be obtained. The FMS and UBI images are of high quality throughout the borehole, where they accurately reproduced breccia patterns and the outlines of the more solid and massive lava flow units. The images also highlight more clast-rich breccia areas compared to more matrixdominated zones. Moreover, they show lithologic boundaries when such contacts are not recovered in the core. Because the FMS images can be oriented with respect to north (using GPIT data collected with the same tool string) and because important structural information on key boundaries, fractures, and other features of interest can be deciphered, postcruise research will allow individual recovered rock pieces (used for paleomagnetic analyses on discrete samples) to also be oriented back to geographic coordinates. This is a key exercise in deciphering the past motion of the Louisville hotspot between 80 and $50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Site U1375  

Site U1375 on Achernar Guyot (Fig. F45) is estimated to have an age of ${\sim}59{-}63\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , and compared to Rigil and Canopus Guyots to the northwest this guyot is relatively small, only $29~\mathrm{km}$ long and $27~\mathrm{km}$ wide. Achernar Guyot is part of a trail of seven small guyots and seamounts that starts with Burton Guyot at the northern end. Knowledge about this extinct volcano will fill an important gap in the age versus distance relationship of the Louisville Seamount Trail and therefore will provide key information to reconstruct past plate motion and the motion of the Louisville hotspot. Site U1375 ( ${\sim}1259\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth) was targeted in the middle of this small edifice away from its shelf edges and away from any thick packages of dipping volcaniclastics on its flanks, the latter of which were exclusively targeted at Sites U1372, U1373, and U1374. After Hole U1375A was spudded in ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{m}$ of soft sediment, drilling became problematic because of instabilities in the uppermost seamount sediment cover, most likely caused by the presence of cobble fields or unconsolidated beach deposits. After Hole U1375A had to be abandoned, Hole U1375B was spudded ${\sim}350\;\mathrm{m}$ to the northwest; however, severe hole instabilities were also encountered there. To avoid further delays, Hole U1375B was abandoned, and a new site was established on Burton  

Guyot, ${\sim}91\ \mathrm{nmi}$ to the northwest along the Louisville Seamount Trail. Some rocks were recovered from Holes U1375A and U1375B before they were abandoned: ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ of carbonate-cemented volcanic breccia was recovered in Hole U1375A, and a $57\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick dolerite (or diabase) was recovered in Hole U1375B. No downhole logging could be carried out, and no microbiology samples were taken.  

Foraminiferal ooze and volcanic breccias were cored in Hole U1375A, similar to the sediment covers at all other sites in the Louisville Seamount Trail, representing the pelagic cap and an older sediment cover at Achernar Guyot. The moderately olivine(augite-)phyric microgabbro (dolerite) recovered from Hole U1375B is likely a big cobble that is part of the sediment cover as well, even though no upper and lower contacts were recovered.  

# Lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy  

Sediment at Site U1375 was mostly restricted to Hole U1375A and represents a pelagic cap and an older sediment cover of Achernar Guyot. Two stratigraphic units were defined on the basis of compositional and textural characteristics of the sediment at macro- and microscopic scales. The uppermost part of Hole U1375A (Unit I) was retrieved with only poor $(\sim\!2\%)$ recovery and a few cuttings retrieved in the core catcher (CC) of Core 330-U1375A-1R. Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers observed in the unconsolidated sandy foraminiferal ooze of Unit I display an age range of latest Miocene–Holocene. This young sediment resembles foraminiferal oozes recovered in the uppermost parts of Sites U1372 on Canopus Guyot and U1374 on Rigil Guyot and is interpreted to represent a pelagic cap on top of the drowned seamount. An older sedimentary cover (Unit II) in Hole U1375A occurs between 8.50 and 10.11 mbsf (Fig. F46). From top to bottom this stratigraphic unit includes a ferromanganese-phosphate encrustation at ${\sim}8.50$ mbsf; a lower to middle Paleocene grain-supported, poorly sorted multicolor basalt conglomerate between ${\sim}8.50$ and $9.34~\mathrm{mbsf}_{.}$ ; and an altered monolithic, matrix-supported, poorly sorted multicolor basalt breccia between 9.34 and the bottom of the hole at 10.11 mbsf. The composition and texture of the sediment suggest that Unit II in Hole U1375A includes a hemipelagic interval (Subunit IIA) probably deposited after the drowning of Achernar Guyot and on top of an older debris flow deposit (Subunit IIB; Fig. F46B). Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers observed in Section 330- U1375A-2R-1 (Fig. F47) give a preliminary age of Paleocene for the Subunit IIA breccia, indicating a ${>}55\mathrm{~m~}$ .y. interval represented by the unconformity between Units I and II.  

# Igneous petrology  

Hole U1375A was drilled to 11.5 mbsf and recovered $1.61\;\mathrm{m}$ of sedimentary rocks containing five types of volcanic clasts. The clast types found in Subunits IIA and IIB include aphyric basalt, moderately olivine-augite-phyric basalt, moderately augiteolivine-plagioclase-phyric basalt, and highly olivine-augite-phyric basalt. Hole U1375B was drilled to 8.5 mbsf and recovered $57\;\mathrm{cm}$ of igneous rock. Unit I, the only unit to be defined for Hole U1375B, is composed of moderately olivine(-augite)-phyric microgabbro (dolerite) with olivine and augite phenocrysts ${>}10\ \mathrm{mm}$ (Fig. F48).  

# Alteration petrology  

The entire succession recovered from Holes U1375A and U1375B has undergone secondary alteration by low-temperature water-rock interactions or weathering. The overall alteration of the volcanic clasts in sedimentary units from Hole U1375A ranges from slight to high $(10\%{-}60\%)$ ), whereas the moderately olivine-(augite-)phyric microgabbro (dolerite) from Hole U1375B varies from moderate to high alteration $(55\%)$ . Plagioclase and augite are generally well preserved, both as phenocrysts and in the groundmass throughout the entire igneous portion of the core. Olivine is typically completely altered to iddingsite, hematite, Fe oxyhydroxides, and carbonates. Alteration phases are mostly carbonates (Mg calcite), brown clay minerals, and other secondary phases (iddingsite, Fe oxyhydroxides, and goethite). Additionally, the microgabbro from Hole U1375B is characterized by millimeter-thick veins of goethite.  

# Structural geology  

Structural features in Hole U1375A are veins and vein networks within sedimentary clasts and geopetals in the surrounding sediments. The reliable geopetals are horizontal, indicating that this part of Achernar Guyot has not been tilted since deposition of the geopetal infilling material. Veins and vein networks are common within the clasts and are as wide as $8\;\mathrm{mm}$ , although they are typically much thinner. In Hole U1375B several veins are present within the microgabbro (dolerite). Most of these veins are steeply dipping, with thinner conjugate veins at shallow dips.  

# Geochemistry  

One sample of the Unit I microgabbro from Hole U1375B was analyzed chemically. It is moderately altered and highly evolved and represents one of the most alkalic rocks recovered during Expedition 330. Data for the sample lie in the field of basanite and tephrite in a diagram of total alkalis $\mathrm{(Na_{2}O+K_{2}O)}$ vs. $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ . The microgabbro appears to be the product of crystal fractionation dominated by olivine and, to a lesser extent, augite. It has slightly lower Zr and Y for its $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ content than igneous rocks from Sites U1372–U1374 and U1376, suggesting that it may represent a different magma type.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property characterization was conducted for material recovered from Holes U1375A and U1375B. The data sets are mutually consistent and fall within the ranges expected based on the identified lithologies. In Hole U1375A, magnetic susceptibility, bulk density, and NGR all moderately decrease downhole, likely because of a reduction in basaltic clasts, though they may also be affected by the fragmented nature of the recovered material. The ${\sim}60\;\mathrm{cm}$ of microgabbro recovered in Hole U1375B generally has higher magnetic susceptibility and bulk density values and similar NGR values compared to those observed in Hole U1375A. Material from both holes shows overall color reflectance characteristics that are more yellow than blue. In terms of redness versus greenness, the sedimentary rocks of Hole U1375A are consistently more red than green, whereas the single igneous unit from Hole U1375B has a more neutral color.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Although there are no hints that the single ${\sim}57~\mathrm{cm}$ long microgabbro unit within Hole U1375B may be an in situ unit, it was nevertheless measured for remanent magnetization. The obtained average inclination for this single rock is $36.3^{\circ}\pm1.6^{\circ}$ (determined from archive-half core data using Fisher statistics). A single discrete sample taken from the same unit was interpreted as having a broadly consistent (reversed polarity) direction.  

# Site U1376  

Site U1376 on Burton Guyot was the fifth site drilled during Expedition 330 (Table T3). This site and seamount have an estimated age of ${\sim}63{-}65\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , slightly older than Site U1375 on Achernar Guyot. Similar to Site U1375, new age data from Burton Guyot will fill an important gap in the age versus distance relationship of the Louisville Seamount Trail, providing key information to reconstruct past plate motion and the motion of the Louisville hotspot. This seamount is one of the smallest volcanoes in the Louisville Seamount Trail, with Burton Guyot having a base diameter of ${<}30\,\mathrm{km}$ . Site U1376 was targeted in the middle of this small edifice (Fig. F49), away from its shelf edges and away from any packages of dipping volcaniclastics on its flanks; the latter sequences were specifically targeted at Sites U1372, U1373, and U1374. The summit of  

Burton Guyot is characterized by two small pedestals on its eastern end. Site U1376 was placed between these pedestals at ${\sim}1503\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth. Burton Guyot shows no evidence of tilting. Hole U1376A was spudded into a sequence of consolidated sediment representing an almost complete section of the sedimentary cover of Burton Guyot, which is ${\sim}42~\mathrm{m}$ thick and formed toward the end of the Cretaceous. This ancient cover formed very late in the life cycle of this volcanic island, after it was planed off and with indications of posterosional or rejuvenated volcanic activity. The sediment cover begins from the top with a sequence of volcanic sandstones and breccias, with multiple Fe-Mn and chalk encrustations that overlie a remarkable $\sim\!15\mathrm{~m~}$ thick white algal boundstone. At its base, this sediment cover ends with a basalt conglomerate unconformably overlying igneous basement, into which drilling continued for $140.9\:\mathrm{m}$ and which is composed of a series of submarine volcanic products of predominantly alkalic basalt composition. The average recovery in the igneous basement was remarkably high at $76\%$ . Operations completed with a series of downhole logging, including a triple combo run, one run with the third-party GBM tool, and two runs with the FMS-sonic tool string.  

The record of a posterosional or rejuvenation phase of magmatism at Site U1376 is provided by the volcanic sands and breccias of sedimentary Unit I (Fig. F50). Clasts in these sediments imply at least two magma types. First, some of the sand layers contain fragments of hornblende and biotite, implying the eruption of magma more evolved than those represented by the more basic basement succession. Second, Subunit IC contains olivine-pyroxene aggregates that may be mantle xenoliths. This is supported by the occurrence of partly resorbed orthopyroxene xenocrysts in basalt clasts in Subunit IC with clear reaction coronas, suggesting that the rejuvenated stage magmas were strongly alkaline. Third, these sediments overlie an algal boundstone reef that must have formed after the volcanic island was planed off and started to slowly subside.  

Drilling Hole U1376A into the center of Burton Guyot provided direct access to a deeper portion of the seamount, explaining why no subaerial eruptive products were encountered and why, instead, a sequence of submarine pillow basalts, hyaloclastites, and auto-brecciated lava flows was cored (Fig. F50). The presence of olivine and augite phenocrysts in these basalts and the complete absence of plagioclase phenocrysts suggest that the seamount magmas were alkaline and more basic than those represented by most of the volcanic rocks drilled at Sites U1372, U1373, and U1374. Geochemical analyses show that the basalts at Site U1376 indeed are more alkaline, although they still classify as transitional basalts rather than tholeiites because they contain titanaugite or olivine in the groundmass throughout the entire drilled interval.  

# Lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy  

Sediment at Site U1376 was restricted to the sedimentary cover only. Two stratigraphic units were defined on the basis of compositional and textural characteristics of the sediment at macro- and microscopic scales (Figs. F50A, F51A–F51D). Unit I represents a younger sedimentary cover that extends from the seafloor to 23.45 mbsf. This cover is mostly composed of monolithic, juvenile volcaniclastic deposits that extend from 4.50 to 21.48 mbsf (Fig. F52A). These deposits are interpreted as a possible record of a rejuvenated volcanic stage of Burton Guyot in a hemipelagic or pelagic environment. Other deposits of Unit I include layered volcanic breccias and sandstones, which are interpreted as turbidites and possible hyperconcentrated flow deposits. Four thin $(<\!3\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick) ferromanganese crusts occur in the uppermost part of the drilled sequence, which also yielded a minor amount of nannofossil- and foraminifer-bearing chalk (Fig. F51A). Nannofossils found in the upper part of Subunit IA indicate a preliminary age of middle to late Miocene.  

Unit II represents an older sedimentary cover of Burton Guyot that extends between 23.45 and 41.93 mbsf. Subunit IIA comprises a $15.15\mathrm{~m~}$ thick interval of limestone (classified as boundstone-rudstone; Fig. F51C) composed of abundant red algae and minor amounts of other shallow-marine fossils. This interval is interpreted to represent an algal reef that developed in very shallow marine conditions during subsidence of the drilled seamount. Subunit IIB between 38.60 and 41.93 mbsf is composed of a basalt conglomerate with few shallow-marine bioclasts (Fig. F51D). The conglomerate was emplaced on top of an erosional surface that marks the boundary between the sedimentary cover and underlying volcanic basement of Burton Guyot. No age-diagnostic microfossils were identified in Subunit IB through Unit IV, but molluscan fossils may indicate a very late Cretaceous age for Subunit IIB (Fig. F52B).  

# Igneous petrology  

The $140.9\;\mathrm{m}$ basement section cored at Site U1376 on Burton Guyot comprises a succession of basaltic breccia, pillow lava, and massive lava flows. Two stratigraphic units were defined on the basis of the occurrence of different phenocryst content, whereby Unit IV contains mostly olivine phenocrysts and is overlain by Unit III, which contains olivine and augite phenocrysts (Figs. F50B, F51E–F51G). From the bottom up the succession starts with $13.1\;\mathrm{m}$ of mostly olivine-phyric basalt breccia, but an interval of highly vesicular aphyric basalt (166.5–167.2 mbsf) on top of this breccia heralds the arrival of a second magma type producing aphyric basalts. The next $31.7\;\mathrm{m}$ comprises heterolithic breccias with olivine-phyric and aphyric basalt clasts and thin flows of aphyric basalt. This interval records a period when two types of magma were erupted in the area at the same time. The upper part of this interval (lithologic Unit 26) contains a number of highly vesicular fragments of aphyric and olivine-phyric basalt, which also are oxidized and may provide evidence for a period of shallow-water or subaerial volcanism. Two thin flows of aphyric basalt separated by a $24\,\mathrm{cm}$ thick interval of olivine-phyric basalt breccia (lithologic Units 22–24) mark the highest occurrence of aphyric basalt in the recovered eruptive succession (127.57 mbsf).  

The uppermost $17.35\mathrm{~m~}$ interval of Unit IV is composed of olivine-phyric hyaloclastite breccia containing a high proportion of fresh glass (Figs. F51F, F53C). Unit IV ends at an erosion surface that marks the beginning of Unit III and a change from magma crystallizing olivine alone to a slightly more evolved one that crystallized olivine and augite. Unit III includes a $33.11\;\mathrm{m}$ thick massive lava flow (lithologic Unit 15; Fig. F53A–F53B). The presence of pillow lava high in the Unit III succession suggests that most, if not all, of the basement section was erupted in a marine environment.  

Intrusive sheets (dikes) cutting Unit IV represent the last magmatic event recorded in the basement section of Burton Guyot (Fig. F51G). They were not seen in Unit III but may have extended through it. However, there are no aphyric basalt units in Unit III, immediately above the upper limit of the dikes, and therefore these dikes cannot be linked directly to any of the recovered volcanic units. It is possible therefore that the dikes penetrated Unit III and fed lava flows that have since been removed by erosion. Alternatively, they may have fed aphyric lava flows similar to those in Unit IV and have been truncated at an erosion surface between Units III and IV. The presence of what looks like a fragment of a dike at the postulated erosion surface between Units IV and III supports this hypothesis.  

Unit I, on top of the drilled sequence, comprises four subunits of volcanic sand and breccia, representing the products of a phase of volcanism that postdates the erosion and submergence of Burton Guyot. Clasts from Unit I, therefore, are the only certain materials from a posterosional or rejuvenation phase of magmatism that were recovered during Expedition 330. The clasts are mostly composed of fragments of basalt, but some layers are dominated by angular fragments of glass (Fig. F53C) with subordinate grains of plagioclase, augite, altered olivine, hornblende, and rare biotite. Basaltic clasts from Subunit IC contain anhedral crystals of orthopyroxene surrounded by coronas composed of tiny clinopyroxene crystals (Fig. F53D). These are most likely xenocrysts derived from disrupted mantle xenoliths.  

# Alteration petrology  

Overall, the cored succession from Hole U1376A has undergone some degree of secondary alteration by low-temperature water-rock interactions or weathering, but large intervals are only slightly altered. The alteration of the volcanic rocks, consisting of basaltic flows, basaltic breccias, and hyaloclastite deposits, ranges from slight to high $(2\%-95\%)$ . Several basaltic lava flows are relatively well preserved ( $10\%$ or less).  

Core descriptions and thin section observations show that rocks in Hole U1376A are defined by a single overall alteration type typical for submarine environments. From the top of Hole U1376A to the bottom, the sequence displays a greenish color indicative of reducing conditions related to the submarine emplacement environment (Fig. F54). Only minor and sporadic intervals in the uppermost $60\,\mathrm{m}$ of the core show some reddish/brown alteration. Augite is well preserved as phenocrysts and in the groundmass throughout the entire igneous portion of the core. Some olivine is completely altered to iddingsite, hematite, and Fe oxyhydroxide near the top of the core, but large portions of the core contain fresh to slightly altered olivine. Some olivine in the greenish altered rocks is replaced by green clay and carbonates (calcite/magnesite). Overall, three main groups of alteration phases could be distinguished, largely dominated by carbonates $\mathrm{Mg}$ calcite, aragonite, and siderite) and clay minerals (saponite and nontronite). Other secondary phases (iddingsite, Fe oxyhydroxides, hematite, and goethite) are present, and zeolites constitute only a minor amount of the alteration assemblage. Additionally, numerous vesicles and veins were observed that are mainly filled with carbonates and clay minerals.  

# Structural geology  

Structural features at Site U1376 are dominated by veins $N=1190$ , with 1489 individual features) and vein networks $N=280$ , with 1995 individual veinlets). This site has the highest vein density of all Louisville seamounts drilled, with a maximum density of 39 veins/m. Veins are also commonly wider than previously observed, with numerous veins between 5 and $10\;\mathrm{mm}$ wide, up to a maximum of $30\,\mathrm{mm}$ , indicating higher fluid flow than at previous sites. In further contrast to previous Louisville sites, veins and vein networks are abundant in breccias and hyaloclastites in addition to rheologically hard lava units, with the highest vein density actually occurring in hyaloclastite units at $\mathord{\sim}62$ and 170 mbsf. The veins are dominantly shallowly dipping and often have subvertical fibrous mineral infills, both of which may indicate subvertical tension within this part of the seamount. The few fractures that are unfilled $N\!=$ 55), are present mostly in the rheologically hard lava flows and intrusive sheets. Geopetal structures $(N=26)$ are overall horizontal, indicating that this part of the seamount has not been tilted since deposition of the geopetal infilling material. Structural measurements were also undertaken for intervals with sedimentary bedding $(N=153)$ ) and seven igneous contacts.  

# Geochemistry  

Major and trace element compositions of 13 igneous samples from Site U1376 on Burton Guyot show general similarities to those from Site U1372 on Canopus Guyot and, to a lesser extent, those from Sites U1373 and U1374 on Rigil Guyot (Figs. F55, F56). However, as a group, the Site U1376 rocks cored are less alkalic. Alteration is generally moderate, and on a diagram of total alkalis $(\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ vs. $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ most of the Site U1376 samples are classified as alkalic basalts, whereas four are transitional basalts. Olivine appears to have been the principal control on magmatic evolution. Seven highly olivine-phyric samples have high MgO (between 11.85 and $16.79\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) and high Ni contents, likely because they contain excess olivine crystals. However, these high-MgO basalts are distinct from other high-MgO rocks recovered during Expedition 330 in having somewhat lower $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ concentrations. In addition, downhole chemical variations indicate that three different magma types are represented among the lava samples from Site U1376, which generally are consistent with the stratigraphic units defined petrographically (Fig. F55). One of the two aphyric dikes encountered in Unit IV is chemically similar to samples of low-MgO olivine-phyric lavas from Unit IV, but the other dike has a significantly higher Ba/Y ratio than other Site U1376 basalts.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property characterizations show clear contrasts between lithified volcanic sandstone and conglomerate, carbonates, lava flows, and the pervasive volcanic hyaloclastites and breccias. In particular, the boundstone of Subunit IIA is characterized by very low magnetic susceptibility and NGR. These carbonate samples have higher $P\cdot$ - wave velocities and lower porosities than would be predicted based on their densities, reflecting their different chemical compositions when compared to basaltic lithologies. The $33\;\mathrm{m}$ thick massive lava flow in Unit III is characterized by a downhole increase in magnetic susceptibility, $P$ -wave velocity, and density within the unit.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The NRM intensity of archive-half core samples from Hole U1376A ranges from $10^{-4}$ to ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{A/m}$ (geometric mean $=0.4\;\mathrm{A/m}$ ). The lowest values are associated with the sediments in Subunit IIA and the hyaloclastite in Unit IV, and the highest values are from the lava flows, intrusive sheets, and basalt clasts in the volcanic breccia of Units III and IV (Fig. F57). The most abrupt variation in NRM intensity and magnetic susceptibility occurs at the Unit I/Subunit IIA boundary, where heterolithic volcanic breccias and volcanic sandstones at the base of Unit I are characterized by NRM intensities and susceptibilities that are roughly three orders of magnitude higher than for the white algal boundstone of Subunit IIA. Both NRM intensity and magnetic susceptibility increase systematically with depth through the algal limestone reef and into the heterolithic conglomerate of Subunit IIB. Significant NRM and susceptibility variations also occur within the volcanic basement (Units III and IV), with lava flows and dikes typically having NRM intensities in the range of $1{-}10\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . This same range of variations is also apparent within the $33\textrm{m}$ thick massive lava flow in Unit III (lithologic Unit 15; 72.21–105.32 mbsf). However, magnetization values for the volcanic breccias are quite variable, with the hyaloclastite breccia of lithologic Unit 21 (\~114–127 mbsf) having NRM values ranging from ${>}1$ to low values of ${\sim}10^{-3}\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}_{}$ , similar to that of the weakly magnetized limestone recovered at this site.  

Remanent magnetization directions were calculated and filtered using an automated procedure consisting of typically 6–8 demagnetization steps for 3947 measurements carried out at $2\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ intervals on archive-half cores (Fig. F57). This automatic technique selected the best-fit direction on the basis of the scatter of the data, the percentage of the remanence used in the calculation, and whether the resulting direction trends toward the origin of the Zijderveld demagnetization diagrams (Fig. F58). This fitting procedure allowed us to identify 1580 intervals with reliable magnetization directions. These best-fit directions are consistent with stepwise AF and thermal demagnetization results from 99 discrete samples (Fig. F59). Both data sets reveal very consistent reversed polarity magnetization throughout the hole, with ${<}1\%$ from these reliable data having negative inclinations.  

Eleven in situ cooling units were recognized at Site U1376. Importantly, as with Sites U1373 and U1374 on Rigil Guyot, very similar inclinations were measured from volcaniclastic and sedimentary units at Site U1376 for Burton Guyot, as well as for two intrusive dikes intruding Unit IV. Therefore, the good agreement between both archive-half and discrete sample data and among lava flows, volcaniclastic materials, and dikes suggests it is possible to obtain a reliable paleolatitude for Site U1376. Detailed postcruise measurements are required to better understand the processes causing a consistent magnetization across different lithologies and across the entire recovered seamount sequence.  

# Downhole logging  

Three tool strings were deployed in Hole U1376A at Burton Guyot. Two tool strings took measurements of natural gamma ray radioactivity, density, neutron porosity, and elastic wave velocity and collected borehole resistivity images. The third tool string, containing the third-party GBM, measured the three-component magnetic field of the drilled seamount formation. Measurement depths were adjusted to match across different logging runs, obtaining a WMSF depth scale. The logged depth interval for Hole U1376A was 80.4–182.3 m WMSF. Resistivity, density, compressional velocity, and neutron porosity derived from downhole logging measurements were used to identify 13 log units in Hole U1376A (Fig. F60): 3 in the section covered by the BHA and 10 in the volcanic sequences in the open hole interval. These log units correlate to changes from massive basalt flows (stratigraphic Unit III) to units dominated by volcanic breccias and interlayered aphyric and olivine-phyric flow units (stratigraphic Unit IV).  

The GBM was run once in Hole U1376A, collecting high-quality three-component magnetic data in conjunction with tool rotation history using three optical gyros mounted in the top of this instrument. Negative influences from strong magnetic sources higher up in the tool string were successfully minimized by inserting a truly nonmagnetic aluminum sinker bar immediately above the GBM. At the onset of each deployment the initial orientation of the tool string relative to the Earth’s rotation axis was determined by aligning the GBM with the JOIDES Resolution and then determining the ship’s heading using a newly installed GPS system. The alignment process was repeated at the end of the GBM run. Using the recorded rotation history of the GBM, the data can be reoriented (postexpedition) and translated into geographic coordinates, allowing for in situ determination of inclinations and declinations in the seamount formation. The uncorrected data appear to correlate very well with downhole changes in lithology, as observed in the recovered core and in the standard downhole logging data (Fig. F61). However, GBM data also show that the massive lava flow in stratigraphic Unit III is not as homogeneous as it appears in the paleomagnetic data obtained from the recovered cores in Hole U1376A. Additionally, in the unrecovered section of the hole, between $\mathord{\sim}130$ and 140 mbsf, the GBM shows strong variations. During postexpedition work the measured horizontal magnetic component will be split into north and east components, which should provide further insight into these observed variations. Further detailed investigations of the GBM data collected will focus on the separation and identification of the magnetic signals of the different in situ flow units and the determination of both the inclination and declination of their NRM, with the intention of accurately determining the paleolatitude of the Louisville hotspot and its past VGP positions.  

Finally, many lithologic and structural features were imaged with the FMS-sonic tool string, in particular highlighting fractures, clast size, and the shape and distribution of massive basalt versus brecciated material. Of particular importance is FMS coverage of the unrecovered section between $\mathord{\sim}130$ and 140 mbsf because this coverage will provide valuable information for reconstructing the lithology for this hole interval. Because FMS images can be oriented with respect to north and because important structural information on key boundaries, fractures, and other features of interest can be deciphered, postcruise research will allow individual recovered rock pieces (used for paleomagnetic analyses) to be oriented back to geographic coordinates. This is a key exercise in deciphering the past motion of the Louisville hotspot between 80 and $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ .  

# Microbiology  

Eleven whole-round samples ( $5{-}13\ \mathrm{cm}$ long) were collected for microbiological analysis. The sample lithologies collected were volcanic sandstone (2), boundstone (2), volcaniclastic breccia (3), and basaltic lava flows (4). All samples were preserved for shore-based cell counting, DNA analyses, and $\updelta^{34}\mathrm{S}$ and $\delta^{13}C$ analyses. Five samples were used to inoculate culturing experiments with up to 10 different types of cultivation media. Media targeting sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and general heterotrophic bacteria were the most successful, and growth was detected in samples from as deep as 174 mbsf. Two samples were used to set up stable isotope addition bioassays to determine rates of carbon and nitrogen utilization by subsurface microbes at Burton Guyot. One core was seeded with fluorescent microspheres, from which samples were collected for shipboard analysis of contamination via fluorescent microsphere counts. No microspheres were detected on the outside or inside of the whole-round sample, indicating a low likelihood of microbial contamination.  

# Site U1377  

Site U1377 at Hadar Guyot was the sixth and last site drilled during Expedition 330, and with a measured $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ age of $50.1\;\mathrm{Ma}$ it is the youngest Louisville seamount drilled and is similar in age to Koko Seamount in the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Trail (Fig. F1). Hadar Guyot shows no evidence of tilting and was formed just to the west of the Wishbone scarp that marks the oceanic crust in that region of the Pacific plate. Hadar Guyot is the smallest seamount cored during Expedition 330, consisting of a single volcanic center with a base diameter of ${\sim}25\;\mathrm{km}$ , and like all Louisville seamounts drilled it has a flat summit plane. Site U1377 was placed near the middle of this small edifice (Fig. F62), away from its shelf edges and away from any packages of dipping volcaniclastics on its flanks. This approach was similar to that used for Sites U1375 and U1376 but contrary to that used for Sites U1372, U1373, and U1374, which targeted the volcaniclastic rocks from the flank sequences in particular. Our two attempts of drilling at Site U1377 became difficult because of instabilities in the uppermost part of the seamount formation. Like drilling at Site U1375 on Achernar Guyot, this instability was caused by the predominance of more or less unconsolidated volcanic breccias in the sediment cover. As a result these breccias were only sparsely recovered in the core. Drilling reached only 53.3 mbsf in Hole U1377A ( $16\%$ recovery) and 37 mbsf in Hole U1377B ( $39\%$ recovery). No logging could be carried out in these shallow holes.  

Despite low recovery, Holes U1377A and U1377B provided enough core material to allow the (at least partial) reconstruction of the sediment cover on top of Hadar Guyot that overlies an igneous basement of trachybasalts, the latter lithology being more evolved than the alkali basalts drilled at the other sites in the Louisville Seamount Trail (Fig. F63). Both holes start out with nannofossil foraminiferal ooze, followed by an older sediment cover including pelagic limestones and volcanic breccias. This middle–upper Eocene foraminiferal limestone contains abundant planktonic foraminifers, ferromanganese encrustations, and rare shallow-marine bioclasts and was likely deposited in a shallow-marine to hemipelagic–pelagic environment. The trachybasalt units in the igneous basement exhibit intervals of pronounced flow banding, suggesting that these were formed as massive lava flows or smaller lobate flows. Lower in the sequence of Hole U1377B, however, much smaller individual cooling units with well-preserved curved glassy margins were encountered. These margins are diagnostic of small lobate flows or pillows and emplacement in a submarine environment.  

# Lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy  

Two units were recognized based on macro- and microscopic observations of the sediment (Fig. F63A). Unit I represents the uppermost sediment of Hadar Guyot and was recovered in Holes U1377A and U1377B. The sediment is composed of nannofossil foraminiferal ooze, which strongly resembles the soft sediment recovered in the uppermost part of Sites U1372 on Canopus Guyot, U1374 on Rigil Guyot, and U1375 on Achernar Guyot. This ooze is considered to reflect recent pelagic sedimentation on top of the drilled seamount. Unit II corresponds to a few cuttings recovered in Section 330-U1377A-3R-CC and 10 small-sized ${<}20\;\mathrm{cm}$ thick) pieces recovered by drilling in situ sediment (Holes U1377A and U1377B) and out-of-sequence material caused by partial collapse of Hole U1377B during drilling of Core 330-U1377A-3G. This unit also includes a foraminiferal limestone with abundant planktonic foraminifers, some ferromanganese encrustations, and rare shallow-marine bioclasts (e.g., echinoderm fragments; Figs. F64A, F65) that has been dated as middle–late Eocene. This limestone then seems to overlay an uppermost Paleocene to lower Eocene heterolithic multicolor basalt conglomerate, also with a few ferromanganese encrustations. The matrix of the conglomerate is composed of foraminiferal limestone with abundant planktonic foraminifers and sparse shallow-marine fossils (e.g., echinoderm fragments, larger foraminifers, shell fragments, and a gastropod). Faunal assemblages and sedimentary textures indicate that Unit II at Site U1377 represents one (or several) condensed section(s) likely to have been deposited in a shallow-marine to hemipelagic–pelagic environment on top of Hadar Guyot. On the basis of preliminary age estimates an unconformity representing ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}.$ .y. exists between Units I and II.  

# Igneous petrology  

Hole U1377A penetrated $38.2\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous rocks after entering igneous basement at 15.1 mbsf, and Hole U1377B penetrated $27.9\;\mathrm{m}$ of igneous rocks after entering igneous basement at 9.1 mbsf (Fig. F63B). The igneous sequences were divided into 6 lithologic units in Hole U1377A and 18 lithologic units in Hole U1377B. The similarity of the rocks throughout both sequences led to the definition of one stratigraphic unit in each hole (Unit III in both cases). The lithology in the two holes is broadly similar, consisting largely of aphyric trachybasalt, at times with olivine-rich bands and, in Hole U1377B, with intervals containing plagioclase-augite glomerocrysts. Throughout Hole U1377A and the upper part of Hole U1377B the trachybasalt exhibits intervals of pronounced flow banding, suggesting that these parts of the successions formed as massive lava flows or smaller lobate flows (Fig. F64B, F64C). There is no evidence in these flows that allows us to determine whether they erupted in a submarine or subaerial environment. The lower part of the succession in Hole U1377B, however, consists of much smaller (7 cm to $2.08~\mathrm{m}$ ) individual cooling units with wellpreserved curved glassy margins, diagnostic of small lobate flows or pillows and emplacement in a submarine environment. A curious feature of these margins is that in several instances the volcanic glass between adjacent pillows is seen to connect with the more massive interior of the unit below. It appears that lava in the still-molten interior of a pillow has broken out as a protrusion that filled the space between overlying pillows (Fig. F64D, F64E). Alternatively, magma may have been injected into a stack of pillows, but the similarity in appearance between the injected and pillow trachybasalts suggests that, in either case, both were part of the same eruptive event. The presence of glassy pillow margins that are distinct from the glass in the protrusions shows that the pillows must already have had glassy crusts when lava from below protruded into the space between them. In one case, fragments of the pillows are incorporated into the protrusion. Based on shipboard petrographic and geochemical investigation, it seems likely that the magma represented by the rocks recovered at this site was generally alkalic and intermediate in composition. If postcruise petrographic and analytical studies confirm this, then the rocks recovered at Site U1377 will have the most evolved composition of all rocks drilled during Expedition 330.  

# Alteration petrology  

The rocks recovered from Holes U1377A and U1377B have undergone secondary alteration by low-temperature water-rock interactions and maybe weathering (Fig. F66). The overall alteration of the volcanic rocks from Hole U1377A ranges from slight to high $(10\%{-}75\%)$ , whereas the rocks from Hole U1377B vary from moderately to completely altered $(30\%{-}100\%)$ . Brown to reddish-brown alteration indicates the prevalence of oxidizing conditions in both holes. Olivine is typically completely altered to white clay minerals in Hole U1377A and to iddingsite and Fe oxyhydroxides in Hole U1377B. Plagioclase is well preserved as phenocrysts and in the groundmass in several lithologic units in Hole U1377B. A few bands of relatively fresh volcanic glass are also present in margins of pillows or lava lobes toward the bottom of Hole U1377B. Alteration phases for both holes are primarily carbonates (Mg calcite, siderite, and ankerite), white clay minerals, and Fe oxyhydroxides (goethite). Fe oxyhydroxides are also particularly abundant in veins in the rocks from both holes.  

# Structural geology  

Structural features at Site U1377 are dominated by veins, vein networks, and vesicle bands. The highest vein density in Hole U1377A is at 15.1–16.6 mbsf (lithologic Unit  

1), with 34 veins/m, whereas most of the recovered intervals have 5–25 veins/m. In Hole U1377B the maximum vein density is 26 veins/m, which occurs at 20–21 mbsf (lithologic Unit 2), whereas other recovered intervals typically have lower values between 10 and 24 veins/ $\mathbf{\dot{m}}$ . The veins in both holes have moderate to steep dips, and a single horizontal geopetal structure at 0.85 mbsf in Hole U1377B is evidence that this part of Hadar Guyot has not been tilted since deposition of the geopetal infilling material. Vesicle bands and chilled contacts in Hole U1377B are moderate to steep, with dips ranging from $45^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$ . Similarly, vesicle bands (but not chilled contacts) with either moderate or subhorizontal dips were recovered in Hole U1377A.  

# Geochemistry  

Major and trace element concentrations were measured for one altered $(3.0\,\upmu\mathrm{{t}\%}$ LOI) igneous sample from Unit III of Hole U1377A. This sample is the most siliceous rock analyzed during Expedition 330, with $55.00\;\mathrm{wt}\%\;\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ . It also has the highest $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ , lowest $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}^{\top}$ (total iron as $\mathrm{Fe}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}$ ), and second-lowest $\mathrm{MgO}$ and CaO concentrations. In a diagram of total alkalis $\mathrm{(Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ vs. $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ , data for the sample fall in the field of basaltic trachyandesite, very near the dividing line between alkalic and tholeiitic compositions. However, alteration may have modified the rock’s $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ and perhaps $\mathrm{Na}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ concentrations, whereas incompatible elements less susceptible to alteration are near the high end of values measured for other Expedition 330 rocks. This suggests that the sample represents a highly differentiated transitional to alkalic magma that possibly evolved from a composition rather similar to those of the majority of the Expedition 330 basalts. However, other characteristics of the sample complicate any simple explanation of its origin. In particular, concentrations of the compatible trace elements Cr, Ni, and Co are anomalously high (686, 421, and $122\,\mathrm{ppm}$ , respectively). This unusual combination of characteristics suggests that the sample may represent an evolved magma that was contaminated by a small amount of olivine-rich material from a mush zone or ultramafic wall rock during ascent.  

# Physical properties  

Physical property characterization was conducted for material recovered from Holes U1377A and U1377B. The data sets are mutually consistent and fall within the ranges expected based on the identified lithologies. Several distinct intervals of high magnetic susceptibility in excess of $2.5\times10^{-2}\,\mathrm{SI}$ were observed within the aphyric trachybasalt. In addition, the level of NGR is higher in both Holes U1377A and U1377B than that observed at earlier sites. This likely results from a combination of the increased alteration and more evolved magma composition at this site. The increased alteration is also seen in the strongly red and yellow color reflectance spectrum seen in Hole U1377B. Densities and $P$ -wave velocities are consistently lower at this site than those observed in lavas from earlier sites, possibly reflecting the more evolved composition.  

# Paleomagnetism  

The NRM intensity of archive-half core samples from Site U1377 is typically ${<}1\ \mathrm{A/m},$ notably lower than that of other guyots sampled during Expedition 330. This lower value presumably reflects the higher degree of alteration observed. Holes U1377A and U1377B had only shallow penetration and, particularly for Hole U1377A, poor core recovery. Nonetheless, samples from both holes appear to have positive inclinations, indicating Southern Hemisphere reversed polarity. Shipboard sampling at these holes was limited because of the short time remaining for shipboard analysis during the expedition (Fig. F67).  

# Microbiology  

Two whole-round samples (8–11 cm long) were collected for microbiological analysis: a moderately olivine-phyric trachybasalt from Hole U1377A and an aphyric trachybasalt from Hole U1377B. Both samples were preserved for shore-based cell counting, DNA analyses, and $\updelta^{34}\mathrm{S}$ and $\delta^{13}C$ analyses. The sample from Hole U1377A was used to inoculate culturing experiments with nine different types of cultivation media targeting sulfur- and iron-cycling microbes and general heterotrophic bacteria. Both samples were used to set up stable isotope addition bioassays to determine rates of carbon and nitrogen utilization by subsurface microbes at Hadar Guyot.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 330 to the Louisville Seamount Trail was a record-breaking hard rock expedition with an exceptionally high recovery of rocks of surprising “freshness” considering their age and long-term submarine residence. In total, $1114\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment and igneous basement at five seamounts was cored, of which $806\;\mathrm{m}$ was recovered (average $=72.4\%$ ) (Table T3). At Site U1374 on Rigil Guyot, $522\;\mathrm{m}$ was drilled, with a record-breaking $87.7\%$ recovery. At all sites, most of the core material was characterized by low degrees of alteration, providing us with a large quantity of samples of mostly well-preserved basalt containing, for example, pristine olivine crystals, fresh volcanic glass, unaltered plagioclase, and in one case mantle xenoliths and xenocrysts.  

Extensive description and shipboard measurement of the recovered cores and downhole logging (at two sites) revealed some surprises about how the Louisville volcanoes were constructed. Even though these flat-topped guyots once were volcanic islands, like the Hawaiian and Easter Islands, the drilling results provided only sparse signs of subaerial volcanism. Rather, after drilling through the thin sediment covers that now overlie these volcanoes, primarily shallow to deeper submarine volcanic sequences were recovered. The Louisville volcanoes thus seem to have been smaller islands or remained above sea level for only a relatively short time before wave erosion planed off the upper part of the volcanoes to make them into flattopped seamounts, or “guyots,” at the end of their life cycles. In the case of Site U1376 on Burton Guyot, evidence was found of an extensive algal reef and posterosional volcanism following the initial subsidence of this formerly volcanic island.  

The good core quality provides a wide range of valuable seamount material for shorebased studies, including  

• Melt inclusions in fresh olivine crystals,   
• Volcanic glass found on the water-quenched contacts of lava flows but also as part of hydrovolcanic hyaloclastite sediments,   
• High-Mg olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase phenocrysts,   
• Carbonate, zeolite, and celadonite alteration minerals,   
• Various micro- and macrofossils, and   
• Many different kinds of unaltered alkaline basalts.  

The large quantity and excellent quality of the recovered sample material allow us to address all the scientific objectives of this expedition and beyond, including  

1. Constraining the paleolatitude history of the Louisville hotspot between 80 and $50\,\mathrm{Ma}$ ,   
2. Reconstructing the age systematics along the Louisville Seamount Trail,   
3. Characterizing the geochemical evolution of the Louisville mantle source,   
4. Testing the genetic relation between the Louisville hotspot and the 120 Ma Ontong Java Plateau,   
5. Determining the degree, potential temperature, and depth of partial melting for Louisville magmas,   
6. Adding crucial paleoceanography and paleoclimate data at $40^{\circ}{-}50^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ paleolatitudes in the Southern Ocean, and  

7. Exploring the unique geomicrobiology and fossil microbial traces within the seamount igneous basement.  

# Paleolatitude record of the Louisville hotspot  

The main objective of Expedition 330 was to core deep in the igneous basement of several Louisville seamounts to establish a record of the past motion of the Louisville hotspot between 80 and $50\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , which would show whether the Louisville hotspot has undergone a large $\mathrm{\sim}15^{\circ}$ shift in paleolatitude, as has been documented for the Hawaiian hotspot (Tarduno et al., 2003). If the Louisville and Hawaiian hotspots did not move in concert over time, this would indicate that both primary Pacific hotspots show considerable interhotspot motion, as predicted by mantle flow models (Steinberger et al., 2004; Koppers et al., 2004). Comparison of the Louisville and Hawaiian hotspots thus is of fundamental importance if we are to determine whether these two primary hotspots have moved coherently or not and understand the nature of hotspots and convection in the Earth’s mantle.  

Accurate determination of the paleolatitude record for the five drilled Louisville seamounts and comparison of these records to the current ${\sim}51^{\circ}\mathbf{S}$ location of the Louisville hotspot requires the recovery of a sufficient number of time-independent lava flows at each drill site. Preferably, these lava flows also should have erupted over a geological period of maybe tens of thousand to a couple of millions of years in order to effectively average out paleosecular variation of the Earth’s magnetic field. Drilling during Expedition 330 resulted in a large number of in situ lava flows, pillow basalts, or other types of volcanic products, such as auto-brecciated lava flows, intrusive sheets or dikes, and peperites. In particular, the deeper holes on Canopus and Rigil Guyots, the two oldest seamounts drilled in the Louisville Seamount Trail, resulted in adequate numbers of in situ lava flows with (for now) eruption ages estimated to be $\mathord{\sim}78$ and $73\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , respectively. Remarkably, all drill sites also recovered large quantities of hyaloclastites, volcanic sandstones, and basaltic breccias, which in many cases show paleomagnetic-consistent inclinations when compared to lava flows bracketing these units, as shown by 9267 good-quality remanent magnetization measurements taken at 2 cm spacing from archive-half cores and by experiments on an additional 409 discrete shipboard samples that passed our quality-control filters. However, most importantly, almost without exception the half-core data are in good agreement with the discrete measurements using either AF or thermal demagnetization. For Site U1374 on Rigil Guyot we also observed a magnetic polarity reversal in the cored sequence that provided antipodal inclinations for both the normal and reversed polarity intervals cored. Overall, this is very promising for determining a reliable paleolatitude record for the Louisville Seamounts, but in order to achieve that goal detailed postexpedition paleomagnetic experiments need to be carried out on multiple $(>\!4$ per flow) discrete samples taken from all in situ lava flow units and from any other suitable lithology that may also reliably retain directional information. This will provide us with a more accurate and precise estimate of these paleolatitudes, in particular after a range of rock magnetic experiments have been carried out to study the character of the remanent magnetization held within both the basaltic lava flows and the large quantity of volcaniclastic sediments.  

Importantly, the analysis of the paleolatitude record for the Louisville hotspot will be supplemented by downhole logging data collected with the GBM. This third-party tool (Steveling et al., 2003) was run twice in Hole U1374A at Rigil Guyot and once in Hole U1376A at Burton Guyot, collecting continuous three-component magnetic data, together with the tool’s rotation history, using three built-in optical gyros. The data quality was significantly improved by inserting a truly nonmagnetic aluminum sinker bar directly above the GBM to isolate the tool from other magnetic parts higher up in the tool string. This provided us with a high-precision record of the magnetic field inside the borehole that, with the continuously recorded rotation history of the GBM, can be accurately reoriented and translated into geographic coordinates, allowing for in situ determination of inclinations and declinations of the seamount formations. This set of measurements will provide an independent record of the paleolatitude history of the Louisville hotspot and unique estimates of the past VGP positions of the Pacific plate on which the Louisville Seamounts formed.  

# Age systematics along the Louisville Seamount Trail  

Radiometric dating of Louisville Seamount rocks using $^{40}\mathrm{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{Ar}$ geochronological techniques is a crucial objective of Expedition 330. It will provide the necessary time framework for determining the volcanic history of individual seamounts and the age progression along the Louisville Seamount Trail. In turn, this age information will aid in determining an accurate paleolatitude history for the Louisville hotspot, and it will be crucial in evaluating the possible relative motion between different hotspot systems. However, high-precision age measurements are required to be able to resolve, for example, the total time of volcanic activity captured between the lowest and highest in situ lava flows at each drilled seamount site. During Expedition 330 a large number of relatively unaltered basalts were recovered with $\mathrm{K}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ concentrations between 0.3 and $1.4~\mathrm{wt\%}$ and low LOI, mostly ${<}3\%$ . The $^{40}\mathrm{Ar/^{39}A r}$ geochronology of these basalts will therefore likely yield ages with precisions ranging between 0.2 and $0.4\;\mathrm{Ma}$ $(2\upsigma)$ that will allow us to date and resolve the duration of, and the potential time gaps between, multiple eruptive units for each single drill site.  

Paleontological evidence from calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers and the occurrence of macrofossils in the sediments overlaying the igneous basement provided strong indications that the lavas cored were as old as predicted by previous studies (Koppers et al., 2004) and in some cases apparently even older. This means that in all cases we will be able to age date the main constructional phase of the drilled seamount volcanoes, which in turn will provide us with the age-progressive timing required for detailed analyses of the paleolatitude record, refinement of the age progression along the Louisville Seamount Trail, and geodynamic modeling of the past motion of the Louisville mantle plume relative to the Hawaiian hotspot.  

# Geochemical evolution of the Louisville Seamounts  

Expedition 330 also aimed to provide an improved understanding of the magmatic evolution and melting processes that have produced the Louisville Seamount Trail volcanoes. Existing dredge data suggest that the mantle source of the Louisville hotspot has been remarkably homogeneous for as long as 80 m.y. (Cheng et al., 1987; Hawkins et al., 1987) and that the Louisville volcanoes might be typified by an entirely alkalic shield-building stage, in contrast to the characteristic tholeiitic shield stage of the Hawaiian-Emperor volcanoes (Hawkins et al., 1987). Shipboard chemical analyses show that, indeed, the drilled rocks of the Louisville Seamounts have all alkalic or transitional compositions, and tholeiitic basalt was encountered at none of the drill sites. Trace element shipboard data show that the drilled lavas also fall within the compositional fields defined by previous studies on dredge samples, thus reinforcing the remarkably homogeneous character of this primary hotspot. However, a full range of shore-based analyses are needed to further characterize this unique hotspot system and to define the “true” (lack of) compositional heterogeneity in the mantle source from which the Louisville magmas have been generated.  

Fresh olivine phenocrysts were recovered at almost every Expedition 330 drill site, which will allow measurement of $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e,}$ , an important noble gas isotope ratio that has never before been measured for the Louisville Seamount Trail but which may indicate whether this hotspot has an upper or lower mantle origin. The fresh olivines will also allow us to carry out analyses on melt inclusions trapped in these phenocrysts to reveal primary magma compositions and to provide insights into the mantle sources of these Louisville magmas. Because these inclusions are often found to span a range of compositions wider than those exhibited by groundmass glass or bulk rock (Frezzotti, 2001; Danyushevsky et al., 2002), these melt inclusion studies will complement the bulk-rock analyses of Louisville basaltic rocks. In addition, melt inclusions may preserve initial magma volatiles and the degassing path undertaken by the magma (Wallace, 2005). Finally, Louisville alkalic basalts are excellent candidates for determining Mg-Fe compositions of olivine phenocrysts and melt inclusions therein, which in turn may yield information about the source temperatures by relating the Mg/Fe ratio of the olivines directly to that of the liquid from which they crystallized (Putirka et al., 2007).  

# Relation between Louisville hotspot and the Ontong Java Plateau  

The Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) is proposed to have been formed by the initial plumehead phase of the Louisville hotspot (e.g., Mahoney and Spencer, 1991; Tarduno et al., 1991). Expedition 330 drill sites will provide a much more rigorous test of the potential genetic relation between Louisville and the formation of the OJP by looking for conjunctions in the Louisville and OJP paleolatitude histories and geochemical signatures. Even though this is a secondary objective that can be addressed only after the three primary objectives described above have been resolved, this test nevertheless will provide key insights in the mantle plume debate, especially for the plumehead–plume-tail model.  

# Paleoceanography and paleoclimate at high southern paleolatitudes  

During Expedition 330 several intervals of carbonate were cored from the Louisville Seamounts, in particular at Site U1376 on Burton Guyot, where a $\sim\!15\mathrm{~m~}$ thick algal limestone reef was cored ( $66\%$ recovery). On three of the other four seamounts drilled during Expedition 330 only some condensed pelagic limestone intervals were recovered, but these did not exceed $30\;\mathrm{cm}$ in thickness. Nonetheless, together these limestones provide valuable insights in the paleoclimate record at high ${\sim}50^{\circ}$ southern latitudes since Mesozoic times, in particular because the well-preserved Site U1376 limestone was likely formed toward the very the end of the Cretaceous or in the early Paleogene. It therefore might provide fundamental constraints on the ancient seasurface temperatures and climate transitions in the greenhouse interval that are characteristic of this time period. Paleolatitudes, timing of formation, and eventually the drowning of such carbonate banks may provide evidence for a temperate climate during these past warm periods at high latitudes in the southern Pacific Ocean, where  

paleoclimate data are mostly lacking (Premoli Silva et al., 1995; Wilson et al., 1998;   
Jenkyns and Wilson, 1999).  

# Geomicrobiology and fossil microbial traces  

During Expedition $330,\,{>}60$ microbiology samples were collected from four seamounts ranging in age between 80 and $50\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and having a maximum depth of 516 mbsf. This collection of igneous basement samples for microbiology is the largest of any hard rock expedition, most of which have focused particularly on young midocean-ridge settings. Expedition 330 thus provides an excellent opportunity to study both living and extant microbial residents within the old subseafloor volcanic rocks that make up the Louisville Seamounts. Differences in microbial population between overlying (pelagic) sediments and volcaniclastic layers and the basaltic basement are of keen interest, as is variation between different kinds of lava flows, with depth into the seamount structures, and between seamounts of different age. Because of the high number of fresh volcanic glass occurrences in most Expedition 330 drill sites, the search and study of microbial fossil traces will provide new facts on the activity of and boring patterns generated by glass-metabolizing microorganisms (Thorseth et al., 1995; Fisk et al., 1998; Furnes et al., 2001) in the largely unstudied seamount subsurface environment.  

# Operations  

# Port call  

Expedition 330 began when the ship arrived at Wynard Wharf in Auckland, New Zealand, at $0636\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 December 2010. Both Overseas Drilling Limited (ODL) and IODP crews were changed subsequent to the conclusion of immigration and custom formalities.  

Several outstanding maintenance items were addressed during this port call as a result of incidents that occurred during the previous expedition. The defective field coils in Propulsion Motors 14A, 14B, and 18A were replaced with rebuilt units, and repairs were made to the I/O modules of the dynamic positioning (DP) system acoustic processors. A pacing item during the port call was the replacement of the damaged aft piston rod on the passive heave compensator with a spare unit. This labor-intensive activity continued the entire port call. Another important issue required offloading the entire inventory (22 units) of 20 ft and 30 ft knobbies to dockside. Critical dimensions were then measured and compared with the clearance requirements of the 430 ton and 250 ton elevators used on the drill floor. Once an upper level of acceptable outer diameter was established, the tubular measurements were analyzed. It was determined that four knobbies had to be transported to a local machine shop (Titan Marine), where the outer diameter would be reduced to conform to specifications. These tubulars will be retrieved at the conclusion of Expedition 330.  

The last port call item of note was loading $1450\,\mathrm{MT}$ of marine gas oil which was completed at $0035\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December. The scheduled departure to the first expedition site was delayed $1.5\;\mathrm{h}$ when the scheduled tug had to divert to assist an arriving cruise ship. The last line was released at $0806\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 December.  

# On-site operations  

Site U1372  

The $824\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Auckland to the first site of Expedition 330 was accomplished at an average speed of $10.3~\mathrm{kt}$ and without incident. The vessel was positioning at Site U1372 (prospectus Site LOUI-1C on Canopus Guyot) by $1700~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 December. The corrected precision depth recorder (PDR) water depth referenced to the dual elevator stool on the rig floor was 1960.3 meters below rig floor (mbrf).  

The drill string was deployed in routine fashion to 1885 mbrf, at which point operations were suspended in order to perform a pressure test on the newly built nonmagnetic aluminum sinker bar for the third-party GBM. The GBM sinker bar was deployed in the drill string via the logging cable at $0300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 December and was recovered by $0550\,\mathrm{h}$ . The unit did not leak.  

After the driller tagged the seafloor at 1968.5 mbrf with the bit (1957.6 mbsl), the top drive and knobbies were picked up, and Hole U1372A was spudded with the RCB at $0850\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 December. Initially, the driller could not apply very much weight on bit because the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was not buried. As a consequence, the rate of penetration (ROP) was very slow for the first few cores. Eventually, the ROP began to pick up as the hole was deepened and more bit weight was applied. Basaltic basement (i.e., the first lava flow) was penetrated at 45.6 mbsf. The hole was deepened to 145.0 mbsf (99.4 meters subbasement [msb]) by the early morning of 26 December. At this juncture the bit had accumulated 64.4 rotating hours and it was time for a fresh bit. The average ROP for the hole was $2.3\;\mathrm{m/h}$ and $2.2\;\mathrm{m/h}$ into basement. The average recovery was $68.9\%$ for the entire hole and $64.8\%$ while coring into basement.  

Prior to the deployment of the free-fall funnel (FFF), the vibration-isolated television (VIT) frame was launched to observe the hole and the nature of the seafloor. The hole could not be seen because a cloud of heavy mud was suspended over the site. Following the recovery of the VIT frame, an FFF was made up and deployed at $1010\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 December. The VIT frame was then launched again to monitor the position of the FFF, which was still mostly obscured by a cloud of heavy mud. However, it was obvious that the FFF was upright because the three flotation balls were clearly visible. While being observed via the VIT camera, the bit was withdrawn from the hole at $1140\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 December. The VIT frame was recovered concurrent with the retrieval of the drill string. The bit cleared the rotary table at $1700\,\mathrm{h}$ and was found to be in very good condition and only undergauge by $^{1\!}/\!\!16$ inch. Once a new Type C-4 bit and a rebuilt mechanical bit release (MBR) were made up, the BHA was deployed with an extra stand of drill collars. The FFF was reentered at $0100\;\mathrm{h}$ on 27 December, and rotary coring was resumed by $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ at 145.0 mbsf.  

Coring advanced to 175.4 mbsf, at which depth $\sim\!3\,\mathrm{{h}}$ was expended working the tight hole by pulling back from 174 to 163 mbsf with a maximum overpull of 40,000 lb and circulating frequent mud flushes. Once the drill string was free, rotary coring advanced from 175.4 to 228.9 mbsf. At this depth, the drill string again had to be worked free for $5.5\;\mathrm{h}$ . Coring then resumed and advanced slowly and smoothly from 228.9 to 232.9 mbsf. At this juncture the hole was flushed with a 20 bbl mud sweep in preparation for a wiper trip. When the drill string was pulled back from 232.9 to 204.5 mbsf it became irretrievably stuck. Unlike the previous stuck pipe episodes when both circulation and rotation were maintained, the top drive stalled out at $800\;\mathrm{A}_{}$ , making extrication even more problematic even though circulation was still possible. From $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 December until $0800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 December all attempts to free the drill string and salvage the hole failed. The only remaining course of action was to sever the first $5\%$ inch joint of drill pipe directly above the tapered drill collar in the BHA at 83 mbsf. This was successfully accomplished at $1950\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 December. Left in the hole were one $9\%$ inch core bit, one MBR, two modified head subs, 11 controlled length drill collars, one modified top sub, one tapered drill collar, and the lower end of one joint of $5\%$ inch drill pipe. This operation left only ${\sim}40\mathrm{~m~}$ of (possibly) open hole above the severed BHA for downhole logging. After considering the probable condition of the hole following the use of explosives and the potential risk to the logging tools, downhole logging was not attempted for Hole U1372A.  

In summary, coring in Hole U1372A penetrated $232.9\;\mathrm{m}$ , with an average recovery of $60.0\%$ (Fig. F68). Total penetration into basement was $187.7\;\mathrm{m}$ , with an average recovery of $55.8\%$ and an average ROP of $2.2\,\mathrm{m/h}$ . There was one bit change during the $227\;\mathrm{h}$ (9.5 days) on site.  

After the pipe was recovered and the beacon retrieved, the vessel departed for approved alternate Site LOUI-6A at $0300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 December.  

# Site U1373  

The vessel arrived at Site U1373 on Rigil Guyot (prospectus Site LOUI-6A) at $1730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 December after a $146\;\mathrm{nmi}$ voyage from Site U1372 that was accomplished at an average speed of 10.1 kt. A new BHA with a Type ${\mathrm{C}}{-}4\ \mathrm{RCB}$ bit and MBR was made up and deployed. The corrected PDR depth for this site was 1455 mbrf. The VIT frame was deployed with the drill string, and by $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 January 2011 a seafloor strewn with large boulders and outcrops of hard rock was displayed on the monitor. From 0230 to $0445\,\mathrm{h}$ a VIT survey was made around the periphery of the site until a clear area was found that appeared to be able to support an FFF deployment. After the driller tagged the seafloor at 1458.0 mbrf (1447.0 mbsl), the top drive was picked up and Hole U1373A was spudded at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 January (Fig. F69).  

The hole was routinely advanced to 64.0 mbsf, at which point the bit had accumulated 69.7 rotating hours and required replacement. Basaltic basement was encountered at 33.9 mbsf. At this juncture the penetration into basement was $30.1\;\mathrm{m}$ , with an average penetration rate of $0.9\,\mathrm{m/h}$ . The strategy of pulling half-cores helped to increase the average basement recovery to $91\%$ . The average recovery for the entire hole at this point was $72\%$ . In order to keep it clean of cuttings, the hole was flushed with 20 bbl mud sweeps prior to recovering each core. An additional 40 bbl mud sweep was circulated before initiating the bit trip.  

An FFF was made up and deployed at $1845\mathrm{~h~}$ on 4 January. The VIT frame was launched and the FFF was monitored as the bit was withdrawn from the hole. The bit cleared the lip of the funnel at $2005\;\mathrm{h}$ and was on deck by $1210\;\mathrm{h}$ on 5 January. The used bit was found to be in excellent condition, exhibiting slight cone wear, no missing inserts, and tight bearings, and was $\%$ inch undergauge in spite of having accumulated 70 rotating hours. A new bit was made up to the BHA and deployed along with an additional stand of drill collars.  

From 0630 to $0845\,\mathrm{h}$ the driller attempted a reentry into the FFF, but the bit appeared to bind about 1 ft into the throat of the funnel and could not be advanced any farther. The mud pump flow was increased on the chance that any obstruction would be hydraulically dislodged, but the end result was that the FFF tipped over on its side. It was surmised that the $2.7\,\mathrm{m}$ FFF casing was not lodged firmly in the hole when the old bit was withdrawn and that the only element that was holding the FFF vertical was the pile of cuttings.  

Although the open hole was not visible on the camera, the driller attempted a blind stab into the hole by lowering the bit into the sediment cover around the periphery of the FFF. This course of action was terminated after $2.25\;\mathrm{h}$ , and the decision was made to offset to a recently approved alternate site (prospectus Site LOUI-6B) located on the other side of the seamount’s summit. After the drill string was picked up to 1111 mbrf, the vessel was offset in DP mode to Site U1374 in the afternoon hours of 5 January.  

# Site U1374  

After Hole U1373A on the eastern side of the summit plain of Rigil Guyot had to be abandoned, the vessel was offset in DP mode to a recently approved alternate site (prospectus Site LOUI-6B) located on the western side of the summit plain. The 5.6 nmi offset was accomplished in $3.25\;\mathrm{h}$ , and by $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 January the ship was positioning at the new location. The VIT frame was deployed and used to monitor the bit tagging the seafloor at 1570.0 mbrf ( $1559.0\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ ), $2.6~\mathrm{m}$ shallower than the corrected PDR depth.  

Hole U1374A was spudded with the Type C-4 RCB bit at $2035\mathrm{~h~}$ on 5 January (Fig. F70). After penetrating a thin sedimentary cover, the bit penetrated igneous basement at 16.7 mbsf. Rotary coring slowly advanced to $130.4\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ , with an average recovery of $84\%$ , by $0345\mathrm{~h~}$ on 10 January. At this time, the bit had acquired 81.3 rotating hours, and preparations were made to recover the drill string and replace the bit with a fresh unit. Penetration into basement was $113.7\mathrm{~m~}$ , with an average recovery of $85\%$ . The average ROP while coring basement was $1.6\;\mathrm{m/h}$ .  

An FFF was made up and deployed at $0550~\mathrm{h}$ on 10 January. The VIT frame was launched, and the bit extraction from the hole was monitored with the VIT system to ensure that the FFF was not dislodged during the process. The used bit was at the rotary table at $1145~\mathrm{h}$ and was replaced with a new Type ${\mathrm{C}}{-}4~\mathrm{RCB}$ bit. The latch sleeve was also inspected, and the MBR was replaced with a rebuilt unit. The used bit was found to be in excellent condition and $\%$ inch undergauge, with all inserts intact and very minor wear across all rows. The bearings were also still moderately tight.  

The FFF was reentered at $1635\,\mathrm{h}$ . The BHA was run in the hole without incident while the driller maintained slow rotation and a low pump rate. There was no fill at the bottom of the hole. Coring resumed at $1900\;\mathrm{h}$ on 10 January. During the course of the week, the scientific party decided to core with the present bit until destruction and forego a second bit trip at this site. Rotary coring continued until $0545\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 January, when erratic pump pressure indicated that there was a problem at the bottom of the drill string. Instead of continuing to core with a bit that had far outlasted its expected life with 133.4 rotating hours, it was decided to end coring at a final depth of 522.0 mbsf. Penetration into basement was $505.3\mathrm{~m~}$ , with an average recovery of $88.0\%$ and an average ROP of $2.5~\mathrm{m/h}$ . The average recovery for the entire hole was $87.8\%$ , with an average penetration rate of $2.4~\mathrm{m/h}$ .  

After a routine wiper trip, which suggested that the hole was in good condition, an attempt was made to release the bit with the rotary shifting tool (RST). There was no positive indication that the window sleeve in the MBR was shifted, and it was initially thought that there was an obstruction in the throat of the bit that prevented the RST from engaging the window latch. To possibly remedy this, a bit deplugger was pumped down, but there was no indication by a change in pump pressure that it had landed. The deplugger had to be jarred free and was recovered on the coring line. There were multiple abrasions on the deplugger, indicating that it was mechanically prevented from landing in the throat of the bit. Since downhole logging in this particular deep hole was considered important, it was decided to trip the drill pipe, remove the bit and MBR, and make up a shorter logging BHA with a $9\%$ inch diameter logging/clean-out bit that would allow more of the open hole to be logged.  

As the drill pipe was recovered, sepiolite-laden mud was discharged under pressure on the rig floor with each connection. In order to remedy this, the circulating head was made up and the pipe was flushed out. It is speculated that during this process the bit may have been released and fallen to the seafloor because no further mud was discharged as the remaining pipe was recovered. The exact time and position of the bit release can only be speculated.  

The end of pipe cleared the rotary table at $2015\;\mathrm{h}$ on 18 January. A shorter logging BHA was made up with the cleanout bit and deployed at $0145\,\mathrm{h}$ . The bit entered the FFF at $0430\,\mathrm{h}$ and was positioned at a logging depth of 101.2 mbsf. The standard triple combo suite was made up and run in at $1045\,\mathrm{h}$ . The tool was not able to advance into the open hole because of a bridge just $\sim\!7\textrm{m}$ below the end of the drill pipe. The tool was recovered, and the bit was lowered to 143.6 mbsf to clear the bridge. The bit was then pulled back and placed at 110.8 mbsf. When the triple combo tool string was unable to advance below 138.0 mbsf, the tool was again recovered and reconfigured to a shorter assembly using only the density and gamma ray sensors in the hope that this tool string would more easily negotiate hole entry. After this attempt was unsuccessful, the drill pipe was recovered with the bit, clearing the rotary table at $1115\;\mathrm{h}$ .  

A four-stand RCB coring assembly was made up with a new MBR and a used Type C-4 bit (recovered from Hole U1373A). The drill string entered the FFF at $1540~\mathrm{h}$ on 20 January. From 1730 to $2315\,\mathrm{h}$ the hole was washed and reamed to bottom $(522\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ , flushed with mud, and then displaced with 165 bbl of heavy $(10.5\;\mathrm{ppg})$ mud. The bit was dropped at the bottom of the hole, and the end of pipe was placed at a logging depth of 128.1 mbsf, $\mathord{\sim}18\;\mathrm{m}$ deeper than the previous logging attempt and below a potentially unstable zone in the formation. An extra stand of drill collars was added to the BHA to keep the tapered drill collar as close to the seafloor as possible, as that is the usual “choke point” where a BHA gets stuck.  

The triple combo logging tool string was made up (in its standard extended version) and deployed again at $0540\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 January and succeeded in logging the hole up from 520 mbsf. The tool suite was recovered and laid out. The second instrument deployed was the GBM, which made one full pass down from the rig floor to $520\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ and back up. Communication with the GBM was lost while it was being retrieved in the pipe; however, because a sighting of the tool was carried out at the start of deployment, the rotation history of the GBM was still obtainable. The third logging run was performed with the FMS-sonic tool string, which also successfully came within $2\,\mathrm{m}$ of the bottom of the hole. The fourth log was conducted with the UBI. The fifth log was a redeployment of the GBM tool. All runs were successful.  

While the GBM was being deployed for the second time, the driller noticed that the suspended string weight was decreasing slightly, indicating that the formation was starting to squeeze the BHA. In order to compensate for this, the driller picked up the string an additional $3\,\mathrm{m}$ . When the logging tool was being retrieved the vessel had to be offset $75\;\mathrm{m}$ in order to lower the pipe connection the additional $3\textrm{m}$ so that the slips could be set. From $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 January to $0930\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January the driller attempted to free the drill string. Although circulation was maintained, there was no rotation and the drill pipe could not be raised or lowered. Realizing that further efforts would be fruitless, the crew made the necessary preparations to sever the drill string directly above the tapered drill collar. The top of the tapered drill collar was $\sim\!13\;\mathrm{m}$ below the seafloor. The drill pipe was severed at $1500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January.  

Once the drill pipe was recovered and the beacon was retrieved, the vessel was secured for sea. The vessel departed for prospectus Site LOUI-2B at $1945\,\mathrm{h}$ on 23 January, with an estimated time of arrival of $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 January.  

# Site U1375  

The 322 nmi voyage to Site U1375 (prospectus Site LOUI-2B) on Achernar Guyot was accomplished at an average speed of $10.2\,\mathrm{kt}$ . During the transit the vessel pitched and rolled moderately in rough sea conditions, with a wave breaking across the deck at times. As the transit progressed, improving weather and course adjustments made the transit more comfortable. The vessel was on station above Hole U1375A at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 January.  

In accordance with the established routine of the expedition, the VIT frame was deployed prior to spudding the hole. The bit tagged seafloor at 1269.0 mbrf (1258 mbsf), which was $0.9\:\mathrm{m}$ shallower than the corrected PDR depth. Hole U1375A was spudded with the RCB assembly outfitted with a Type C-4 bit at $1345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 January. Almost immediately, the driller experienced erratic high torque, indicating that we were attempting to core through loose rocks and boulders. Frequent overpulls of up to 90,000 lb were required to keep the drill string rotating freely. At $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ , coring of Hole U1375A was terminated at 11.5 mbsf because of unstable hole conditions. The average recovery for just two cores was $13\%$ .  

The vessel was offset $300\;\mathrm{m}$ at $315^{\circ}$ , and a second attempt at coring this site was initiated when Hole U1375B was spudded at $2345\mathrm{~h~}$ . The water depth was again 1269.0 mbrf. After penetrating $8.5\textrm{m}$ with increasing difficulty and constantly fighting unstable hole conditions, operations in this hole were terminated as well. The lone core retrieved had an average recovery of $7\%$ . It was concluded that the formation on the top of this seamount consisted of a sedimentary breccia loosely held together in a “soft” carbonate matrix that quickly disintegrated during drilling, leaving mainly loose pebbles behind. The vessel departed for the approved alternate Site LOUI-7A, located 91 nmi north-northwest from Site U1375 at $1945\mathrm{~h~}$ on 26 January. The total time spent on Site U1375 was $34.3\;\mathrm{h}$ or 1.4 days.  

# Site U1376  

The $91\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to alternate prospectus Site LOUI-7A on Burton Guyot was accomplished at an average speed of $10.1\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The vessel was on station at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 January. A three-stand RCB coring assembly was made up with a new C-4 coring bit and MBR and deployed. The VIT frame was launched before the hole was spudded to observe the character of the seafloor and the tagging of the bit on the bottom. A rocky seabed devoid of any appreciable sediment was observed on the VIT camera. From 0300 to $0515\;\mathrm{h}$ on 27 January a VIT survey was undertaken to look for an area containing sediment that could support an FFF installation (should one be later required). After $2.3\;\mathrm{h}$ , a spot with a very small sediment pond was located.  

The driller tagged the seafloor at 1514.3 mbrf ( $1503.3\ \mathrm{mbsl})$ and spudded Hole U1376A at $0705\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 January. This was $5.5\;\mathrm{m}$ deeper than the corrected PDR measurement. Operations continued without incident until $1530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January, when coring was suspended at 86.8 mbsf to change the bit, which had accumulated 72.4 rotating hours. Because of the absence of sediment cover needed to support an FFF installation, a hole marker composed of a weight, tether, and single glass float was placed on the seafloor from the VIT frame via an acoustic release. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 January and was on deck at $2215\,\mathrm{h}$ . A new Type ${\mathrm{C}}{-}4~\mathrm{RCB}$ bit was made up to the BHA, along with a refurbished MBR, and deployed.  

After the drill string was tripped to $1131\;\mathrm{mbrf}_{1}$ , the VIT frame was deployed and both were run in to 1512 mbrf. The open hole was successfully reentered at $0435\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 January. Coring resumed in Hole U1376A at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ and continued without incident until the allocated coring time for this site expired at $1630\;\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February, leaving the hole at a final depth of 182.8 mbsf. The total average recovery for the hole was $74.5\%$ , with an excellent average recovery in basement of $75.6\%$ . The average ROP in basement was $1.8\,\mathrm{m/h}$ . In accordance with expedition routine, nonmagnetic core barrels were used to obtain all cores. One microsphere packet was deployed in the core catcher of Core 330-U1376A-19R at 144.4 mbsf. Prior to the recovery of all cores except 2R, 3R, and 10R, 20 bbl mud sweeps were circulated.  

Following a wiper trip, which included displacing the borehole with 42 bbl of heavy $(10.5\;\mathrm{ppg})$ mud, the bit was released at the bottom of the hole. The end of pipe was positioned at the logging depth of 80.4 mbsf by $2115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 February.  

The first log was conducted with the triple combo tool string, which logged the hole up from 181 mbsf in two passes. After the triple combo tool string was recovered at  

$0350~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February, the second logging run was conducted with the third-party GBM tool. The last tool string deployed was the FMS-sonic, which was run between 1335 and $1655\,\mathrm{h}$ and made two passes in the open hole.  

Once logging was concluded, the drill string was recovered, with the end of the pipe clearing the seafloor at $1850\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 February. Once the drill collars were set back in the derrick, the beacon recovered, and the drilling equipment secured, the vessel departed at $2200\;\mathrm{h}$ for the 391 nmi voyage to the final Site U1377 (prospectus Site LOUI-4B) on Hadar Guyot, the youngest seamount targeted during Expedition 330. The total time on Hole U1376A was $191\;\mathrm{h}$ or 8.0 days (Fig. F71).  

# Site U1377  

The $392\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Site U1377 (prospectus Site LOUI-4B on Hadar Guyot) was made without incident at an average speed of $11.2\;\mathrm{kt}$ . By $0930\;\mathrm{h}$ on 5 February the vessel was positioning on the coordinates of Hole U1377A. After a three-stand RCB drilling assembly was made up with a new Type C-4 bit and refurbished MBR and was deployed to 988 mbrf, the VIT frame was launched.  

Tagging of the seafloor at 1262.0 mbrf (2050.8 mbsl) was observed at $1435\,\mathrm{h}$ . The seabed appeared to be mostly covered by a fine layer of sediment and a few scattered rocks, which did not generate any anxiety regarding the spudding of the hole. After the VIT frame was recovered and the top drive was picked up, Hole U1377A was spudded at $1510\,\mathrm{h}$ . Rotary coring advanced with increasingly difficult hole conditions and overall poor recovery. Finally, after coring to a depth of $53.3\;\mathrm{mbsf}_{1}$ , the hole became too unstable and had to be abandoned. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1815\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 February and was picked up to 1103 mbrf. Average recovery for Hole U1377A was $16.4\%$ . The time expended at Hole U1377A was $12.5~\mathrm{h}$ .  

It was decided to slightly offset the vessel $500\,\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1377A and attempt to spud another hole at this site. The vessel was positioned after a $30\,\mathrm{{min}}$ offset with the bit $159\;\mathrm{m}$ above the seafloor. The VIT frame was deployed and showed a seafloor covered with soft sediment. The driller tagged seafloor at 1262.0 mbsl.  

Hole U1377B was spudded with the RCB at $2325\,\mathrm{h}$ on 6 February, and rotary coring advanced to 18.1 mbsf. At this time, during the retrieval of the core barrel for Core 330-U1377B-2R, unstable parts of the formation fell into the hole and were subsequently recovered in the core barrel of Core 330-U1377B-3G. Because the recovered material cannot be assigned to a specific depth, this core was curated as a “ghost core”  

indicated by the suffix $^{\prime}\mathrm{G}^{\prime\prime}$ (instead of ${}^{\prime\prime}\mathrm{R}^{\prime\prime}$ ). Below 18.1 mbsf the formation was stable enough to allow further drilling advancement to a final depth of $37.0\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ , when the allocated time on site expired. As the last core barrel was being retrieved, the coring line was coated with a rust inhibitor in accordance with routine. After the drill string was recovered, the beacon was retrieved, and the vessel was secured for transit, the vessel departed Site U1377 for Auckland at $0730\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 February. The time on Hole U1377B was $57.5\;\mathrm{h}_{.}$ , and the total time on site was $70.0\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.9 days). Because of concerns of moderate headwinds and rough seas on the transit to Auckland, the vessel departed approximately $18\,\mathrm{h}$ earlier than originally planned.

Figure F6. Results from a seismic refraction experiment across the Louisville Seamount Trail. A. Velocity model obtained from tomographic inversion of traveltimes from crustal and mantle phases along a single $370\;\mathrm{km}$ long seismic refraction line conducted orthogonally to the overall northwest trend of the Louisville Seamount Trail and crossing the summit of the $27.6^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ guyot $(\mathrm{-}1.1^{\circ}$ south of prospectus Site LOUI-1C) during the German SO195 cruise (Grevemeyer and Flüh, 2008). B. Geologic interpretation revealing some internal seamount structures based on seismic velocity values: $1.5–4.0\ \mathrm{km/s}$ for volcaniclastic and mass wasting deposits, $7.2–7.6~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ for intracrustal magma intrusion, $8.0\ \mathrm{km/s}$ for upper mantle, $5.0{-}6.4~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ for extrusive volcano, and $6.4{-}7.0~\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ for intrusive core. Assumed upper and lower crustal velocity ranges are $4.0{-}6.4\ \mathrm{km/s}$ and $6.4{-}7.2\ \mathrm{km/s},$ , respectively. Infill material is likely the volcaniclastic sequence directly underlying the pelagic cap that is thickening toward the edge of the guyot shelves, as seen on the AMAT02RR multichannel seismic reflection data.

Figure F14. Thin section photomicrographs of microfossils, Site U1372. A. Annelids showing infilling of volcanic sediment and micrite and later calcite cement forming a horizontal geopetal (Sample 330-U1372A-8R-1, 20–23 cm; Thin Section 20) (with crossed polars). B. Planktonic foraminifers (Sample 330-U1372A-5R-4, $49{-}52\ \mathrm{cm}_{.}$ ; Thin Section 53) (plane-polarized light). Most Site U1372 planktonic foraminifers observed in thin section are globular morphotypes with four or more chambers. Specimens shown here might be a group of hedbergellids. Because these specimens have not been sectioned axially, identification of these foraminifers awaits further onshore study.

Grayish basalt conglomerate with bioclasts in Subunit IIE deposited in an intertidal to subtidal environment and believed to represent the first sedimentary record after or during the flattening of the top of Rigil Guyot at Site U1374 (interval 330-U1374A-3R-2, $25{-}65~\mathrm{cm}$ ). C. Multicolor volcanic sandstone in Subunit VIIB interpreted to have been emplaced on a shallow-marine slope as a hyperconcentrated flow (interval 330-U1374A-8R-1, $10{-}50~\mathrm{cm})$ ). D, E. Examples of magma-sediment (peperitic) interaction observed in Hole U1374A: (D) interval 330-U1374A-17R-3, $20–40~\mathrm{cm}$ , and (E) interval 330-U1374A-23R-2, 107–127 cm. F.

Figure F51. Scanned core images of a selection of representative lithologies, Hole U1376A. A. (1) Heterolithic layered multicolor basalt breccia and (2) heterolithic bioturbated volcanic sandstone from Subunit IA (interval 330-U1376A-1R-1, 15–55 cm). Arrows show ferromanganese encrustations with chalk. Subunit IA likely consists of several hyperconcentrated flow deposits (layered breccias) and turbidites (bioturbated sandstones) emplaced in a pelagic or hemipelagic environment. B. Monolithic bioturbated brown coarse tuff (top and bottom) and heterolithic multicolor volcanic sandstone (center) from Subunit ID (interval 330-U1376A-3R-4, $1{-}41\;\mathrm{cm}$ ). Compaction features were observed: (1) loadcasts and (2) small synsedimentary fault. Subunit ID likely consists of turbidites and coarse tuff deposited in a hemipelagic or pelagic environment. C. Algal boundstone with a branching growth form of alga from Subunit IIA interpreted as an algal reef (interval 330- U1376A-3R-5, $10{-}29\ \mathrm{cm})$ ). D. Basalt conglomerate with shallow-marine bioclasts from Subunit IIB showing erosional contacts in (1) basalt conglomerate and (2) underlying volcanic basement from Unit III (interval 330-U1376A-5R-3, $106{-}125\ \mathrm{cm})$ ). E. Volcanic breccia composed of angular basalt clasts cemented with calcite from Subunit IC (interval 330-U1376A-1R-4, 37–49 cm; see also Fig. F53D). F. Hyaloclastite breccia from lithologic Unit 21 in stratigraphic Unit IV (interval 330- U1376A-16R-4, $45{-}57\ \mathrm{cm})$ ). The yellowish-gray color in the clasts indicates the presence of fresh glass. G. Scanned core image (left) and interpretation (right) of aphyric dike margin from lithologic Unit 20 (interval 330-U1376A-15R-2A. 22–95 cm). Rows of dark blue dots $=$ vesicle trains.

Figure F53. Thin section photomicrographs of basalt, Site U1376. Highly olivine-augite-phyric basalt from lithologic Unit 15 (A) under plane-polarized light and (B) with crossed polars (Sample 330- U1376A-8R-6, 136–140 cm; Thin Section 255). C. Hyaloclastite breccia from lithologic Unit 21 showing fresh basaltic glass shards with curved edges (Sample 330-U1376A-17R-1, $140–143\ \mathrm{cm}_{.}$ ; Thin Section 262) (plane-polarized light). Homogeneity of the glass suggests fragments quenched very rapidly, and shape of shards suggests they are bubble-walled fragments. Voids between glass shards are unfilled. Darkening of glass around shard edges is due to numerous minute tubes formed by microorganisms. D. Orthopyroxene xenocryst surrounded by reaction corona composed of tiny crystals of clinopyroxene (Sample 330-U1376A-1R-4, $39{-}42~\mathrm{cm}$ ; Thin Section 234) (plane-polarized light).
