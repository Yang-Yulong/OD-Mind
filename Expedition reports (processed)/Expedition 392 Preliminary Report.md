# Abstract  

During International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 392, three sites were drilled on th e Agulhas Plateau and one site was drilled in the Transkei Basin in the Southwest Indian Ocean. This region was positioned at paleolatitudes of ${\sim}53^{\circ}{-}61^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ during the Late Cretaceous (van Hinsbergen et al., 2015) $(100{-}66\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and within the new and evolving gateway between the Sout h Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and southern Indian Ocean basins. Recovery of basement rocks an d sedimentary sequences from the Agulhas Plateau sites and a thick sedimentary sequence in th e Transkei Basin provides a wealth of new data to (1) determine the nature and origin of the Agulha s Plateau; (2) significantly advance the understanding of how Cretaceous temperatures, ocean circulation, and sedimentation patterns evolved as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels rose and fell and the breakup o f Gondwana progressed; (3) document long-term paleoceanographic variability through the Lat e Cretaceous and Paleogene; and (4) investigate geochemical interactions between igneous rocks, sediments, and pore waters through the life cycle of a large igneous province (LIP). Importantly, postcruise analysis of Expedition 392 drill cores will allow testing of competing hypotheses concerning Agulhas Plateau LIP formation and the role of deep ocean circulation changes throug h southern gateways in controlling Late Cretaceous–early Paleogene climate evolution.  

# 1. Introduction  

The warmest sustained greenhouse episode of the past $\mathord{\sim}150$ My occurred during the midCretaceous between ${\sim}95$ and $^{80\,\mathrm{Ma}}$ (e.g., Clarke and Jenkyns, 1999; Friedrich et al., 2012; Huber e t al., 2018, 2002). Proxy data and climate models suggest $C O_{2}$ levels during this supergreenhous e interval may have been as high as 3500 parts per million by volume (ppmv) before declining to les s than 560 ppmv following the Eocene–Oligocene transition (EOT) at ${\sim}34$ Ma (Berner et al., 1983; Bice et al., 2006; DeConto and Pollard, 2003; Royer et al., 2004). High-latitude temperatures wer e exceptionally warm during the prolonged period of elevated $C O_{2}$ levels in the mid-Cretaceous, resulting in low meridional temperature gradients (Bice et al., 2006, 2003; Forster et al., 2007; Huber et al., 1995). However, Cretaceous warmth was also interrupted by periods of rapid globa l climate change during oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), which were associated with widesprea d reduction in basin ventilation and major changes in ocean temperature and circulation (Arthur e t al., 1985, 1987; Jenkyns, 2003, 2010; Schlanger and Jenkyns, 1976; Sinninghe Damsté et al., 2010). The timing, magnitude, and oceanographic and ecological consequences of the Cretaceous greenhouse warming are poorly documented in the southern high latitudes. Furthermore, greenhous e climate conditions with $C O_{2}$ levels approaching those of the Cretaceous–Paleogene interval ar e envisioned for the near future (e.g., Hay, 2011), highlighting the value of using Cretaceous– Paleogene records to better understand the operation of the Earth system in greenhouse periods.  

Expedition 392 drill sites on the Agulhas Plateau and Transkei Basin were located at high latitude s during the Late Cretaceous $(65^{\circ}{-}58^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ (Hay et al., 1999; Sewall et al., 2007; Tetley et al., 2019) an d positioned in the gateway between the newly opening South Atlantic, Southern Ocean, and southern Indian Ocean basins. Climate models indicate significant Cenozoic cooling arising from th e opening of Southern Ocean gateways, pointing toward a progressive strengthening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) as the major cause for cooler deep ocean temperatures (Sijp et al., 2014; Toggweiler and Russell, 2008). Analogous arguments point to a critical role for deep circulation in controlling Late Cretaceous climate evolution (e.g., Frank et al., 1999; MacLeod and Huber, 1996; Robinson and Vance, 2012; Voigt et al., 2013). Therefore, because of its position at the narrow junction between the Indian and Atlantic oceans and expanding Southern Ocean, basemen t and sedimentary records recovered during Expedition 392 from the Agulhas Plateau will allo w direct testing of these models through precise determination of the timing of large igneous province (LIP) volcanism and emplacement of the plateau and its subsequent paleoceanographic history, including documentation of ocean temperature, circulation, and sedimentation pattern s during the Cretaceous and Paleogene.  

# 2. Background  

# 2.1. Geological setting  

# 2.1.1. Tectonic history of the African–Southern Ocean gateway  

During the Early Cretaceous, the African–Southern Ocean gateway was closed and the Sout h American, African, and Antarctic continents were connected (Figure F1). Breakup of this regio n of Gondwana commenced at ${\sim}146\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and was associated with the formation of two oceanic plateaus (Figure F1): the Mozambique Ridge $({\sim}136{-}120\;\mathrm{Ma})$ and the Agulhas Plateau $(105{-}95\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Gohl and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001; Gohl et al., 2011; König and Jokat, 2010; Parsiegla et al., 2008; Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 1999). These seafloor elevations constituted barriers for circulation of deep and intermediate water masses as indicated by neodymium (Nd) isotopic evidence fo r different water masses bathing the Falkland Plateau and the western flank of the Kerguelen Platea u between ${\sim}95$ and $78\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Murphy and Thomas, 2012, 2013). A deepwater connection between th e South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean opened with the separation of the Falkland Plateau fro m Africa between ${\sim}120$ and $100\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (König and Jokat, 2010).

This is the first possibility for formation of AP. C. 100 Ma. Reconstructions of AP, Northeast Georgia Rise (NEGR), and Maud Rise (MR) (with recent boundaries) show overlap betwee n AP and NEGR, which is due to different dimensions of these structures at 100 Ma. D. 94 Ma. Formation of entire LIP (AP, NEGR, and MR) is complete. Bouvet triple junction is located at southwest tip of AP (Marks and Tikku, 2001), and subsequen t spreading causes separation of the three fragments of the AP-NEGR-MR LIP.

are heavily debated. Seismic studies and plate tectonic reconstructions suggest that the Agulha s Plateau is a LIP that formed no earlier than $105\,\mathrm{Ma}$ (Parsiegla et al., 2008) in combination with th e Northeast Georgia Rise and Maud Rise (Gohl and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001; König and Jokat, 2010; Parsiegla et al., 2008; Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 1999). In contrast, Gohl et al. (2011) suggested the existence of a southeast African super-LIP between ${\sim}140$ and $95\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , which formed a s a result of an intense period of magmatism (Charvis et al., 1995; Fischer, 2017; Gohl an d Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001; Jacques et al., 2019) and consisted of the Northeast Georgia Rise, Agulhas Plateau, Maud Rise, Astrid Ridge, Mozambique Ridge, and Transkei Rise. This southeast African super-LIP is conjectured to be the same size and age as the Kerguelen-Heard LIP. It is unclea r whether this LIP includes continental fragments, and the formation age of this super-LIP, as wel l as its later separation into Mozambique Ridge, Astrid Ridge, Northeast Georgia Rise, Agulha s Plateau, and Maud Rise, remain unresolved.  

# 2.1.2. African–Southern Ocean gateway circulation  

In the Cretaceous greenhouse world, the role of oceanic poleward heat transport as a main drive r of long-term climate change is uncertain. Low latitudinal thermal gradients and different pattern s of runoff and evaporation could have shifted areas of deepwater formation, and constricted connections between basins could have led to largely internal circulation of deepwater masses in relatively small Cretaceous oceanic basins $(120{-}80\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Friedrich et al., 2008; MacLeod et al., 2011, 2008). Numerical simulations of Cretaceous (Albian and Cenomanian/Turonian boundary) circulation do not predict overturning circulation in the African–Southern Ocean gateway, althoug h weak  circulation  connecting  the  Pacific,  Atlantic,  and  Indian  Ocean  basins  is  indicate d (Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 2017). Cooling due to atmospheric $C O_{2}$ reduction through the Lat e Cretaceous, perhaps due to enhanced carbon burial (Robinson et al., 2010; Robinson and Vance, 2012) and/or evolving tectonic barriers via the formation of oceanic plateaus (Frank and Arthur, 1999), could have resulted in circulation patterns similar to modern ones, with consequent feedbacks through changing ocean heat transport. Better depth-resolved, empirical constraints on circulation coupled with modeling experiments from critical regions like the southwest India n Ocean are needed to test and refine these hypotheses.  

In the Agulhas Plateau region today, surface and deep currents transport warm and salty water s through the African–Southern Ocean gateway from the Indian Ocean into the southern Atlanti c Ocean via the Agulhas Current and Agulhas rings, whereas cold water flows eastward into th e Indian Ocean (Figure F2) (de Ruijter et al., 1999, 2006; Lutjeharms, 1996, 2006; Lutjeharms an d  

![](images/409255e9feeefa0f9ac2060825aee04a7a09a8088e53942473c346f7236f5f9f.jpg)

Ansorge, 2001; Mantyla and Reid, 1995; Read and Pollard, 1999; Tomczak and Godfrey, 1994; Toole and Warren, 1993; van Aken et al., 2004; You et al., 2003). Water mass exchange in thi s region is controlled by seafloor topography, requiring a deep and wide gateway. Lutjeharms (1996, 2006) observed that the Agulhas Current hugs the shelf break of the Agulhas Passage and the pat h of Agulhas rings is influenced by the Agulhas Ridge topography. Both the Agulhas Current an d Agulhas rings maintain the energy transfer between the Indian and Atlantic Oceans (Biastoch e t al., 2008, 2009). Seafloor features such as the Mozambique Ridge and Agulhas Plateau constitut e barriers for the flow of these oceanic currents and lead to modifications in flow paths.  

During the Cretaceous, the presence of large magmatic obstructions is hypothesized to hav e caused constriction of the African–Southern Ocean gateway and hence hindered water mas s exchange between the Atlantic and Indian basins. There are two possible ways that LIP formatio n complicated the opening of the African–Southern Ocean gateway: (1) a southeast African superLIP (140–95 Ma) (Gohl et al., 2011) or (2) the formation of two LIPs between 140 and $120\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Mozambique Ridge and Astrid Ridge) (König and Jokat, 2010) and 105 and $95\mathrm{~Ma}$ (Northeas t Georgia Rise, Agulhas Plateau, and Maud Rise) (Parsiegla et al., 2008; Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 1999). The second hypothesis allows deepwater circulation between the Tethys/Indian Ocean an d Southern Ocean/South Atlantic from ${\sim}120\ \mathrm{Ma}$ onward. Convergence of Falkland and Kerguele n intermediate water masses may have then initiated following tectonic subsidence of the intervening barriers in the Southern Ocean basin. Therefore, instead of the gateway slowly opening an d allowing increasingly deeper water mass exchange, geophysical studies (Fischer et al., 2016; Goh l et al., 2011; König and Jokat, 2010; Schlüter and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2008a) indicate prolonge d restricted circulation in the opening gateway (e.g., Transkei Basin). In this model, only surface current flow occurred between the Tethys/Indian Ocean and the evolving Southern Ocean/Sout h Atlantic, whereas deep and intermediate water masses were blocked by this barrier. With the ful l clearance of the South American plate and the separation of the Agulhas Plateau–Northeast Georgia Rise–Maud Rise LIP into three parts (Figure F1), changes in the seafloor topography may hav e allowed open-ocean circulation across the African–Southern Ocean gateway by ${\sim}94\$ Ma. To tes t this proposed history, drilling of Cretaceous basement and sediments from the Agulhas Platea u during Expedition 392 was intended to provide constraints on the timing and nature of African– Southern Ocean gateway evolution from the onset of Agulhas Plateau–Northeast Georgia Rise– Maud Rise LIP formation (younger than $105\;\mathrm{Ma})$ to a fully open gateway $(\sim\!94\mathrm{\Ma})$ (König an d Jokat, 2010; Parsiegla et al., 2008). Recovery of sediments on the Agulhas Plateau and in the Transkei Basin were further intended to provide long records of changing paleodepth, paleoceanography, and paleoclimate spanning the mid-Cretaceous through the Paleogene, documenting th e formation of the plateau in presumed subaerial or shallow-water environments and its subsidenc e to bathyal depths.  

# 2.2. Seismostratigraphic model  

Prior to drilling, the seismostratigraphic model developed for the proposed Expedition 392 dril l sites (Figure F3) was tentative because only the uppermost part of the sedimentary sequence of th e Agulhas Plateau had previously been sampled by scientific drilling at only one location (International Ocean Discovery Program [IODP] Expedition 361 Site U1475 on the southwest Agulha s Plateau) (Hall et al., 2017), and therefore the interpretations for ages of reflectors should be applie d with caution. The seismostratigraphic models for the Agulhas Plateau and Transkei Basi n sequences were based on analysis of reflection characteristics (e.g., amplitude, frequency conten t of units, and continuity of reflections) and were tied to the ages of conventional gravity/pisto n cores (Tucholke and Carpenter, 1977) where possible and to Site U1475 for the post-Miocen e sequences (Gruetzner et al., 2019).  

For the Agulhas Plateau, Tucholke and Carpenter (1977) and Tucholke et al. (1984) identified fou r distinct seismic horizons above acoustic basement and constructed a first seismostratigraphi c model (see Table T2 in Uenzelmann-Neben et al. [2020]). An unconformity above acoustic basement was cored where it crops out high on the western flank of the plateau and was found to b e minimally Maastrichtian in age $({\sim}72{-}66\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ). The underlying reflections terminate against th e Upper Cretaceous reflector, thus documenting erosion (Uenzelmann-Neben, 1998, 2002).  

A 9 My hiatus across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary in the Agulhas Plateau sedimentar y sequence (Tucholke et al., 1984) is interpreted as Reflector LE, which shows strong amplitudes an d is mostly conformable to bounding beds (Figure F4). Intensified bottom currents (e.g., due to th e formation and strengthening of the ACC [Tucholke et al., 1984]) led to the formation of a secon d regional hiatus between ${\sim}33$ and $29\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Reflector LO) (Figure F4) that is of medium to stron g amplitude and represents an unconformity observed on the Agulhas Plateau (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2002). Reflector MM (Middle Miocene) is also likely a result of deepwater erosion and redeposition (Tucholke et al., 1984). This reflection shows weaker amplitudes and frequent wedge-outs a t the seafloor (Figure F4). A regional hiatus of Late Miocene–Early Pliocene age $({\sim}10{-}6\ \mathrm{Ma})$ i s attributed to erosion and redeposition of sediments by Circumpolar Deep Water in the AC C (Tucholke et al., 1984) and represented by a strong reflection (Reflector LP), which is often foun d very close to and thus indistinguishable from the seafloor. Reflector LP is dated to $5.7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ (Gruetzner et al., 2019) and interpreted to represent the onset of a period of increased Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. A relatively thin veneer of Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments $(\mathord{\sim}0\mathord{-}50$ m) rests on top of the Lower Pliocene reflection across most areas of the Agulhas Plateau, formin g thicker drift packages only in localized areas. Several reflections in the Pliocene–Pleistocen e sequence have been associated with climate-induced changes in circulation (Gruetzner et al., 2019).

In the Transkei Basin, the top of the oceanic crust is imaged as a high-amplitude, partly rugge d reflection (Schlüter and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2007). An undisturbed sedimentary sequence overlying basement identified as Subunit 1A is separated from the overlying heavily faulted Subunit 1 B by Horizon K-T (Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary) of medium reflection amplitude (see Table T 3 in Uenzelmann-Neben et al. [2020]) (Figure F5). Sedimentary Unit 1 is topped by Horizon E (lat e Eocene). In Subunit 1A, a reflection band with higher amplitudes was interpreted to represen t black shales (Schlüter and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2008a). The overlying Unit 2 marks a short transition zone and appears as a small but very high–amplitude reflection band with a thickness of ${\sim}25$ m. The interface between Units 2 and 3 is characterized by Reflector O and represents th e Eocene/Oligocene boundary (Figure F5). Unit 3 indicates an increasing energy level and als o thickens up to $70\textrm{m}$ . The Unit 3/4 boundary is represented by Reflector M, which was hypothesized to be Middle Miocene in age. In contrast to Unit 3, overlying Unit 4 thickens up to $130~\mathrm{m}$ , whereas the amplitudes weaken. Units 4 and 5 are separated by the Lower Pliocene Reflector $\textbf{P}$ (Figure F5). The youngest Unit 5 shows high-amplitude reflections (Schlüter and UenzelmannNeben, 2007).  

# 3. Scientific objectives  

Expedition 392 drilling was aimed at addressing the following scientific questions and objective s (Figure F3).  

# 3.1. Objective 1: did Indian Ocean LIPs related to the breakup of Gondwana tap a similar source and show a similar temporal and geochemical evolution to coeval and older Pacific LIPs?  

It is hypothesized that the Agulhas Plateau, Northeast Georgia Rise, and Maud Rise initiall y formed a superplateau similar to the combined Ontong Java–Manihiki–Hikurangi Plateau (Dav y et al., 2008; Hoernle et al., 2010; Timm et al., 2011) before being broken up by seafloor spreadin g in the mid-Cretaceous. Basement rocks recovered on the Agulhas Plateau will test whether th e Agulhas Plateau–Northeast Georgia Rise–Maud Rise super-LIP formed at the Bouvet triple junction (Gohl et al., 2007; Parsiegla et al., 2008) (much like the Shatsky Rise in the northwester n Pacific [Sager et al., 1999]) or through interactions between the Bouvet and Marion hotspots wit h the Southwest Indian Ridge (Georgen et al., 2001). Continuous, $15{-}20\ \mathrm{km}$ long reflection s observed in Agulhas Plateau basement structures are similar to lava flow sequences drilled a t Shatsky Rise (Tamu Massif) that rapidly accumulated at inferred melt production rates of $0.63-$ $0.84\,\mathrm{km}^{3}/\mathrm{y}$ over a time interval of 3–4 My (Geldmacher et al., 2014; Gohl and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001; Expedition 324 Scientists, 2010; Sager et al., 2013; Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 1999). Thes e rates imply the involvement of a mantle plume.  

A fundamental question concerning Cretaceous LIPs is whether they tapped a common reservoi r in the lower mantle, and if so, what is the composition of this reservoir and its homogeneity/heterogeneity (e.g., Jackson and Carlson, 2011; Jackson et al., 2010). Most lavas from Ontong Jav a Plateau show a homogeneous isotopic composition characterized by the Kwaimbaita/Kroenk e component, similar to the composition of proposed common mantle components with intermediate isotopic compositions compared to oceanic intraplate volcanic rocks (e.g., Prevalent Mantl e [PREMA], Focal Zone [FOZO], and Common Component [C]) (Hanan et al., 2004; Stracke et al., 2005; Zindler and Hart, 1986). However, the stratigraphically youngest plateau lavas in some area s display a compositionally distinct (Enriched Mantle 1 [EM1]) type; e.g., (Zindler and Hart, 1986 ) Singgalo composition. On the other hand, recent studies of lavas from the Manihiki Platea u (Timm et al., 2011), Shatsky Rise (Heydolph et al., 2014), and Mozambique Ridge (Jacques et al., 2019) show considerably more compositional variation, suggesting that even single LIP events ta p heterogeneous sources similar to ocean island basalts.  

Another important question about LIPs concerns their longevity: do they represent single shortterm events occurring over a few million years, or are these volcanic provinces active over longe r time periods (e.g., Bryan and Ernst, 2008)? Although the main Tamu Massif of Shatsky Ris e formed between $\mathord{\sim}144$ and $143\;\mathrm{Ma}$ , magnetic data suggest the three massifs formed over a longe r time interval from M20 to M4 (146–127 Ma). The uppermost lava group at the Tamu Massi f (Shatsky Rise) yielded an age $\mathrm{{[33\,Ma]}}$ ) ${\sim}10$ My younger than the main sequence of lavas (144–14 3 Ma) (Geldmacher et al., 2014), providing evidence for volcanic rejuvenation. These lavas are geochemically identical to the main plateau stage lavas and therefore appear to have tapped the sam e source. At Ontong Java Plateau, the stratigraphically youngest Singgalo lavas have a distinct trac e element and isotopic composition from the main Kwaimbaita/Kroenke lavas (Tejada et al., 2004, 1996, 2002). The uppermost lavas at Manihiki Plateau drilled at Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP ) Site 317 have a distinct Singgalo-type chemical composition compared to the main low-Ti platea u lavas with Kwaimbaita/Kroenke-type compositions (Hoernle et al., 2010; Timm et al., 2011). Alkalic rejuvenated lavas with distinct (high $\upmu$ [HIMU]-type) incompatible element and isotopic compositions occur on Ontong Java, Hikurangi, and Manihiki Plateaus (e.g., Hoernle et al., 2010; Timm et al., 2011). Seismic data from the Manihiki Plateau revealed several formation stages: th e initial phase forming the nucleus (older than $125\;\mathrm{Ma})$ ), the extension $(125{-}116\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , and the secondary phase $(100{-}65\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (Pietsch and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2015). Seismic and geochemica l data from Mozambique Ridge indicate a rapid, partly contemporaneous formation of the four segments and later postsedimentary magmatism (Fischer, 2017; Jacques et al., 2019). These observations pose the question of whether rejuvenated volcanism is a common feature on oceani c plateaus, and if so, what is its origin?  

Key questions include the following:  

• What are the age, origin, and temporal and geochemical evolution of the uppermost Agulhas Plateau volcanic sequences?   
• Do the uppermost Agulhas Plateau lavas show evidence for subaerial volcanism?   
• Does the Agulhas Plateau show geochemical affinities and melt production rates similar to other LIPs (e.g., Shatsky, Ontong Java, Manihiki, Hikurangi, and Kerguelen Plateaus), requiring elevated mantle temperatures and/or lower mantle source (high $\mathrm{^3He/^{4}H e}$ and solar Ne isotope ratios) and thus the presence of a mantle plume from the lower mantle?   
• Is there evidence for late-stage volcanism on the Agulhas Plateau as has been observed at Shatsky Rise and the Ontong Java, Manihiki, and Hikurangi Plateaus? How much younger is it compared to the main plateau stage, and does it show compositional differences in major (alkalic versus tholeiitic) and trace element and isotopic (e.g., more enriched) composition?   
• How does Agulhas volcanism correlate with the separation of Africa and Antarctica and the formation of other plateaus in the African–Southern Ocean gateway (e.g., Mozambique Ridge)?  

# 3.2. Objective 2: did sedimentation on the Agulhas Plateau start immediately after crustal emplacement at $\mathbf{\sim}100$ Ma under subaerial conditions?  

Following the separation of the Falkland Plateau from southern Africa during the breakup o f Africa, South America, and Antarctica (Figure F1), the onset of free water mass exchange betwee n the Tethys/Indian Ocean and evolving South Atlantic/Southern Ocean emerged. However, th e emplacement of LIPs appears to have obstructed the opening of this gateway. König and Joka t (2010) suggested that the Mozambique Ridge formed between 140 and $122\;\mathrm{Ma}$ and parts of th e Astrid Ridge (Antarctica) were possibly still attached to the Mozambique Ridge (Fischer, 2017; Gohl et al., 2011). It is unclear whether this LIP was submarine or emplaced subaerially, but i t likely formed an obstacle for the flow of intermediate and deepwater masses (Fischer an d Uenzelmann-Neben, 2018). Another barrier for oceanic circulation was created with the formation of the Agulhas Plateau–Northeast Georgia Rise–Maud Rise LIP between 105 and $95\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , afte r which the Northeast Georgia Rise and Maud Rise detached from the Agulhas Plateau by seafloo r spreading (Figure F1) (Gohl and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001; Gohl et al., 2011; Parsiegla et al., 2008), leading to a widening and deepening of the gateway. Based on crustal thickness and estimated subsidence, Parsiegla et al. (2008) speculated that the central part of the Agulhas Platea u (present water depths are ${<}3000\ \mathrm{m})$ ) formed subaerially. The Transkei Basin formed between th e Mozambique Ridge and Agulhas Plateau–Northeast Georgia Rise–Maud Rise LIPs and the African continent. Plate tectonic reconstructions (König and Jokat, 2010; Parsiegla et al., 2008) sugges t that this basin may have been a restricted subbasin until ${\sim}80$ Ma (Schlüter and UenzelmannNeben, $2008\mathbf{a}$ ; Uenzelmann-Neben, 2010).  

Key questions regarding initial sedimentation on the Agulhas Plateau include the following:  

• Under what environmental conditions were sediments deposited shortly after formation of the Agulhas Plateau—subaerial, shallow or deep water, or warm or cool conditions? • How did emplacement of the plateau influence the climate, oceanic environments, and Earth’s biota? • What can we deduce about water mass changes during early stages of the plateau’s evolution? Did emplacement of the Agulhas Plateau LIP interrupt an already incipient circulation?  

# 3.3. Objective 3: did bottom currents associated with deep- and intermediate water masses as well as climatic events leave an imprint in the sedimentary record in the form of seismic reflections and unconformities?  

Tucholke and Carpenter (1977) and Tucholke et al. (1984) identified five distinct horizons in thei r interpretation of Agulhas Plateau seismic reflection data sets, of which they dated the oldest horizon from piston cores and dredge samples as Maastrichtian (see Table T2 in Uenzelmann-Nebe n et al. [2020]). These horizons were subsequently related to regional hiatuses resulting from loca l sea level highstands, initiation and spreading of the ACC, and activity of Antarctic Bottom Wate r (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001, 2002). For the Transkei Basin, Schlüter and Uenzelmann-Nebe n (2007) presented a seismostratigraphic model tied to the model of Niemi et al. (2000) (see Table T 3 in Uenzelmann-Neben et al. [2020]) that showed the importance of dating the horizons wit h respect to possible erosion and the evolution of ocean circulation, which may represent significan t climatic episodes (e.g., OAE 3). The Cretaceous sedimentary record of the Transkei Basin represents an archive of the circulation initially restricted by the emplacement and elevation of bot h the Mozambique Ridge and Agulhas Plateau. Dating of these sedimentary units and unconformities in the Transkei Basin and mapping their regional extent will help us to identify traces of deep - and intermediate water masses, their onset, the intensification and/or weakening of th e circulation, and changes to the circulation pathways. This information will provide insight int o both long-term and short-lived changes in bottom water circulation through the Late Cretaceous– early Paleogene interval in relation to the tectonic isolation and opening of this gateway.  

# 3.4. Objective 4: what was the paleotemperature history at southern high latitudes across the rise and decline of the Cretaceous supergreenhouse and through the early Paleogene?  

Planktonic foraminifer oxygen isotope records from Falkland Plateau DSDP Site 511 indicat e Cretaceous sea-surface temperatures that at times exceeded $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (Huber et al., 2002), yet climat e simulations require unrealistically high atmospheric $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels of $6500{-}7500\ \mathrm{ppm}$ to matc h these extremely warm subantarctic temperatures (Bice et al., 2003). Although it is unlikely that th e mid-Cretaceous experienced such high $p{\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ levels, paleoceanographic and preservational explanations for the low $\delta^{18}\mathrm{O}$ values (e.g., diagenesis and low salinity) have been ruled out. In addition, the timing and tempo of cooling from peak Turonian temperatures is debated (e.g., Andò et al., 2013; Friedrich et al., 2012), and this uncertainty compromises parallel efforts to relate changes i n the tectonic configuration of gateways and geochemically inferred patterns of circulation to climate evolution. Cretaceous foraminifers and inoceramid bivalves from the sequences recovered a t Expedition 392 sites should allow construction of oxygen isotope, $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ , and, depending o n organic biomarker preservation, $\mathrm{TEX}_{86}$ paleotemperature estimates spanning the mid-Cretaceou s supergreenhouse through the early Paleogene, providing a robust temperature history and reducing uncertainties about the climate history at high southern latitudes.  

Recent advances in paleoclimate modeling offer potential avenues for reconciling model–dat a disparities for Cretaceous temperature and ${\mathrm{CO}}_{2}$ estimates through consideration of cloud and biological feedbacks (Kump and Pollard, 2008; Poulsen and Zhou, 2013), emission of non- $C O_{2}$ greenhouse gases (Beerling and Royer, 2011), and regional increases in ocean heat transport (Poulse n and Zhou, 2013). Moreover, water isotope–enabled Earth system models are increasingly common, making direct comparisons between proxy data and simulations feasible (e.g., Zhou et al., 2008). Determining whether extreme warm conditions were localized or widespread through th e Southern Ocean will provide an important test of possible warming mechanisms.  

Specific questions to address include the following:  

• What was the thermal history of the Cretaceous, and was this linked to changes in atmospheric $C O_{2}$ , tectonic evolution, or some other forcing? • Were surface water temperatures over the Agulhas Plateau cool enough at any time during the Cretaceous and early Paleogene to allow for growth of Antarctic ice sheets? • Can Earth system models simulate the conditions recorded at Agulhas Plateau during the Cretaceous? What assumptions about $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels are required to reproduce these conditions?  

# 3.5. Objective 5: how did the progressive opening of the African– Southern Ocean gateway influence Cretaceous to Paleogene circulation?  

Significant changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation related to evolving bathymetry in oceanic gateways are one possible driver of global-scale climate change through the Cretaceous an d Cenozoic. Many studies have proposed enhanced formation and export of Southern Componen t  

Waters starting in the Campanian (e.g., Jung et al., 2013; Murphy and Thomas, 2012; Robinson e t al., 2010; Robinson and Vance, 2012; Voigt et al., 2013), promoted by the opening of the Sout h Atlantic and establishment of connections to all major oceanic basins. However, incomplet e records that lack robust age control from southern high-latitude areas currently hinder deepwate r circulation reconstructions for the Cretaceous and early Paleogene. The source regions for different deepwater masses in evolving southern gateways are also controversial (see African– Southern Ocean gateway circulation), and resolving fundamental questions on circulation history requires analyses of samples from various depths in or near gateways across which circulatio n may have reversed.  

Specific questions to address include the following:  

• What is the role and impact of the Agulhas Plateau on the evolving communication of deepand intermediate water masses in and between ocean basins? Was there a co-development of Pacific-sourced deepwater circulation in the South Atlantic in the early Paleogene?   
• When and how did the opening of Southern Ocean gateways influence Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene climate? Did early opening of the African–Southern Ocean gateway and Drake Passage cause invigorated deepwater circulation and a strengthening of surface frontal systems in the eastern South Atlantic?   
• Can the onset and evolution of the Agulhas Current be reconstructed in detail? The removal of surficial to Oligocene sedimentary layers suggests that the presently observed circulation has been stable since at least the Neogene (Uenzelmann-Neben and Huhn, 2009). When can we identify the earliest traces of this important water mass exchange between the Indian and the South Atlantic oceans?  

# 3.6. Objective 6: what forcing factors caused Cretaceous OAEs, and what effects did these events have on high-latitude climate, oceanography, and biota?  

Despite the nearly four decades since OAEs were discovered, no study has satisfactorily established the primary forcing factors that caused their formation. If increased organic productivit y was the dominant cause for OAEs, why are biotic and geochemical indicators of nutrient upwelling generally not found in sediments deposited across those time intervals (Jenkyns, 2010)? On th e other hand, if OAEs were caused by sluggish overturning circulation during times of high atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Poulsen and Zhou, 2013) and oxygen-poor water masses in isolated basins (Poulse n et al., 2003), then why is there an offset in the timing of carbon isotope excursions that accompan y each of the OAEs relative to peak phases of LIP eruptions and other major volcanic episodes (Jenkyns, 2010), and why are some peak carbon isotope excursions diachronous (Tsikos et al., 2004) ? Recovery of complete OAE intervals with well-preserved organic matter and microfossils at th e Expedition 392 drill sites will help resolve these controversies. Importantly, new OAE record s from the Agulhas Plateau and Transkei Basin will shed light on relative variations in surface productivity and indicate whether there were cooling feedbacks associated with increased organi c carbon burial during the OAEs and also whether there were significant changes in bottom circulation prior to, during, and after the OAE intervals. The presence of organic-rich shale with up t o ${\sim}6\%$ total organic carbon (TOC) from upper Cenomanian–lower Turonian sequences at multipl e sites in the Bight Basin (Totterdell et al., 2008) and Mentelle Basin (Chen et al., 2022; Huber et al., 2019; Petrizzo et al., 2021) on the southern/southwestern Australian margin provides evidenc e that euxinic waters may have been present elsewhere in the southern high latitudes during OAE 2. As noted above, interpretation of the seismic profiles indicates that sediments as old as late Albia n may be accessible at relatively shallow burial depths on the Agulhas Plateau, which should allo w for preservation of primary geochemical signals across the OAE 1d, OAE 2, and OAE 3 intervals, and a sedimentary section extending down through OAE 3 may be recovered at the Transkei Basi n site.  

# Key questions to address include the following:  

• Was there an increase in $\mathrm{C_{org}}$ burial during the $\delta^{13}C$ excursion intervals that define Cretaceous OAEs? If so, was the interval of increased $\mathrm{C_{org}}$ burial pulsed or continuous?  

• How did surface productivity, paleotemperatures, the vertical thermal and $\delta^{13}C$ gradients, and bottom circulation change in the eastern South Atlantic across the OAE intervals? • Did changes in Agulhas Plateau microfossil assemblages correspond to observed OAE geochemical and sedimentological shifts, and if so, can the cause for those changes be determined?  

# 4. Site summaries  

# 4.1. Site U1579  

# 4.1.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1579 (proposed Site AP-10A) is located on the shallowest part of the central Agulhas Platea u $(39^{\circ}57.0725^{\prime}\mathrm{S}/26^{\circ}14.1793^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ at $2492\:\mathrm{m}$ water depth. The Agulhas Plateau rises up to $2200\;\mathrm{m}$ abov e the surrounding seafloor, with the shallowest central area rising to ${\sim}1800\;\mathrm{m}$ on average. The central and southern parts of the plateau have a smoother topography, whereas the northern platea u is characterized by a rough topography. The sedimentary column is thicker on the central an d southern Agulhas Plateau, whereas the northern plateau shows a very thin or no sedimentar y cover. Basement highs characterize the plateau and have been interpreted to represent magmati c edifices. The plateau has been subject to erosion resulting in wedge-out of sequences and the formation of unconformities, which are interpreted to have resulted from oceanic currents flowin g across and past the plateau since the Paleogene. The seismic data show that Site U1579 is positioned between two basement highs in a small sediment-filled depression. The seismostratigraphic  model  developed  prior  to  drilling  (see  Background)  provides  a  framework  fo r interpreting the drill core results. The deepest horizon interpreted is characterized by a rugge d topography and has been interpreted as top of basement (Figure F6). Below this horizon, reflections have been observed dipping away from the basement highs. The sedimentary column show s a chaotic layer (ZS) with a strong top reflection immediately above basement. Two further stron g seismic horizons can be observed separating layers of potentially Campanian, Maastrichtian, an d Paleocene age, which will be confirmed in postcruise analysis. These reflections and the Campanian and Maastrichtian sequences follow the basement topography. The younger sequences sho w continuous reflections of weaker amplitude. The youngest part of the sedimentary column i s affected by strong erosion at the seafloor (Figure F6).

Figure F6. Seismic Line AWI-20050201 showing the location of Site U1579. Preliminary interpretation of seismic unit s according to the chronostratigraphic model is shown. The marked green reflection corresponds in structure to Reflector  M of the pre-Expedition 392 seismostratigraphic model (Figure F4), the magenta reflection to Reflector LE, and the blu e reflection to Reflector LO. TWT $=$ two-way traveltime, $Z\!S\!=$ zeolitic silicified sediments.  

Site U1579 was chosen to recover both Cretaceous and Paleogene sedimentary records and basement. Integration of seismic profiles with the drilling results allows for direct dating of th e observed seismic unconformities M, LE, and LO (purple, blue, and green in Figure F6) and interpretation of their causes. Recovery of the sediment/basement interface will provide informatio n on the age of the oldest sediments above the basement, as well as the water depth and environmen t at the time of deposition. At this site, records spanning the transition from the Cretaceous supergreenhouse and through the Paleogene were drilled. Based on precruise seismostratigraphic interpretations, critical interval of ocean/climate transitions such as Oi1, PETM, Cretaceous/Paleogen e boundary, OAE 2 and OAE 3 were expected to be documented in the sedimentary record. Th e nature and age of the basement would also be unraveled by drilling at this site.  

# 4.1.2. Operations  

Expedition 392 started on 5 February 2022, and following quarantine, the science party boarde d on 7 February under the COVID Mitigation Protocols Established for Safe JR Operations (COPE). The majority of incoming freight was loaded by the previous crew, and on 8 February the offgoin g core and surface freight was loaded into two reefers. Fuel bunkering was completed via barge, an d a load of fresh and frozen produce was brought aboard. The final installation, testing, and commissioning of the new $50\,\mathrm{kVA}$ uninterruptable power supply (UPS) for the JOIDES Resolution Scienc e Operator (JRSO) network was done on 8 and 9 February, requiring temporary blackouts of shipboard IT services. COVID-19 rapid antigen testing was conducted for all shipboard personnel o n 8 February, and PCR testing was conducted on 9 February.  

The vessel departed Cape Town, South Africa, from Repair Quay 3 on 10 February at $1024\;\mathrm{h}$ (al l times are local ship time $\mathrm{[UTC+2\,h]},$ ). The pilot disembarked at $1045\,\mathrm{h}$ , beginning the sea voyag e to Site U1579. Within minutes of the vessel reaching full throttle, the newly commissioned $50\,\mathrm{kVA}$ UPS began rejecting the ship’s power and running off the batteries, and the vessel was therefor e throttled back to half speed at $1116\,\mathrm{h}$ . It was decided to take the UPS offline, after which the vesse l was returned to full throttle at $1448~\mathrm{h}$ , and the sea voyage continued at full speed. The $557\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit was completed in $52.1\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at an average speed of $10.8~\mathrm{kt}$ . We arrived at Site U1579 at $1430\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 February.  

Site U1579 hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1. The first core of Expedition 392 was taken in Hole U1579A at $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 February in $2498.32\:\mathrm{m}$ of water. We used the advanced piston corer (APC) system to take Cores $\mathrm{1H-8H}$ , and the las t material was recovered at $74.78\mathrm{~m~}$ core depth below seafloor, Method A (CSF-A). The advance d piston corer temperature (APCT-3) tool was run on Cores 4H and 7H. After firing Core 9H fro m $74.6\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , the core barrel became stuck. The core barrel was retrieved; however, all that wa s recovered was a sheared overshot and the sinker bars, and the decision was made to abandon th e hole. A total of 9 cores were taken in Hole U1579A over an $84.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=87\%$ ). Tota l time on Hole U1579A was $33.12\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.38 days).

Hole U1579B was spudded at $0910\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 February. We used the APC system to take Cores 1H– 6H (0–57.0 m CSF-A) and switched to half-length APC (HLAPC) coring for Cores 7F–24F (57.0– $141.6\ \mathrm{m}\ \mathrm{CSF-A}$ ). The extended core barrel (XCB) system was used to take the final cores (25X– 27X). A total of 27 cores were taken in Hole U1579B over a $167.08\mathrm{~m~}$ interval (recovery $=99\%$ ). The rate of penetration (ROP) for XCB cores (3) averaged $11\,\mathrm{m/h}$ . Total time on Hole U1579B wa s $40.56\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.69 days).  

Hole U1579C was spudded at $^{1720\,\mathrm{h}}$ on 15 February. The hole was drilled down with a center bi t to $56.5~\mathrm{m}$ . We used the HLAPC system to take Cores 2F–21F ( $56.5–130.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), with fiv e small $(0.5{-}1.5\;\mathrm{m})$ advances without recovery for stratigraphic correlation. We then drilled dow n an additional $31.5\;\mathrm{m}$ and used the XCB system to take Cores 23X–25X, although Core 23X did no t recover any material. Heave made it difficult to keep the bit on bottom, and the decision was mad e to terminate coring at the final depth of $186.9\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. A total of 18 cores were taken in Hol e U1579C over a $93.4~\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=80\%$ ). The ROP for XCB cores (3) averaged $9.6~\mathrm{m/h}$ . Total time on Hole U1579C was $42.24\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.76 days).  

Hole U1579D was spudded at $2124\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on 17 February and drilled down to $130\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. We use d the rotary core barrel (RCB) system to take Cores 2R–65R (130.0–727.2 m CSF-A). On 24 February, the bit was released in the bottom of the hole at $0310\,\mathrm{h}$ and the hole was displaced with heav y mud in preparation for logging. The $48\textrm{m}$ long quadruple combination (quad combo) tool strin g consisted of the Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS), Dipole Shear Sonic Image r (DSI), Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS), High-Resolution Laterolo g Array (HRLA), and Magnetic Susceptibility Sonde (MSS). The downlog was paused to conduct  a high-resolution uplog from 450 to $250\textrm{m}$ wireline log matched depth below seafloor (WMSF). After resuming the downlog, the tool tagged bottom at 727.7 m WMSF, and an uplog was done. Pipe was tripped back to the rig floor, and Hole U1579D ended at $0735\,\mathrm{h}$ . A total of 64 cores wer e taken in Hole U1579D over a $597.2\;\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=73.8\%$ ). The ROP for RCB coring averaged just under $20\,\mathrm{m/h}$ in the sediment to $2.0\,\mathrm{m/h}$ in basalt (average $=8.2\,\mathrm{m/h}$ ). Total time on Hol e U1579D was $188.4\,\mathrm{h}$ (7.85 days).  

# 4.1.3. Principal results  

# 4.1.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

A ${\sim}634\mathrm{~m~}$ thick sequence of calcareous sediments of Pleistocene–Santonian age overlying zeoliti c siliciclastic sediments and basalt was recovered at Site U1579 (Figure F7). The main sedimentar y succession down to ${\sim}697\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A is divided into Lithostratigraphic Units I–III, and Unit II i s further divided into Subunits IIa–IIc. Below Unit III, a ${\sim}24\;\mathrm{m}$ interval of basalt designated as Uni t IV overlies another ${\sim}5\;\mathrm{m}$ of zeolitic siliciclastic sediments (Unit V) and $\sim\!2\;\mathrm{m}$ of basalt (Unit VI).  

Unit I (Hole $\mathrm{U1579A}=0.-1.31\mathrm{~m~CSF}–\hat{$ ; Hole $\mathrm{U1579B}=0{-}6.19\;\mathrm{m}\;{\mathrm{CSF-A}})$ consists of light gra y nannofossil-rich foraminiferal ooze with average carbonate concentrations of ${\sim}90\ \mathrm{wt\%\CaCO_{3}}$ . Unit I is differentiated from the underlying white nannofossil ooze of Unit II on the basis of  a greater abundance of foraminifers and a darker light gray color. The light gray color reflects  a greater abundance of sand-sized glauconite grains, disseminated pyrite, and clay. Unit II consist s of ${\sim}630~\mathrm{m}$ of Miocene–Campanian carbonate ooze and chalk. The primary sedimentary components of Unit II are calcareous nannofossils and recrystallized calcite with varying abundance o f foraminifers and clay. Unit II is divided into Subunits IIa–IIc on the basis of lithification (ooz e versus chalk), color, and the occurrence of thin silicified horizons. Unit III (Hole U1579D $=$

634.72–697.00 m CSF-A) consists of ${\sim}60\;\mathrm{m}$ of greenish gray well-lithified zeolitic siliciclastic sediments (sandstones, siltstones, and claystones) with glauconite. Most individual clasts are likely o f volcaniclastic origin and have undergone significant alteration to clay minerals and zeolites wit h carbonate cementation. Rare carbonate bioclasts and foraminifers suggest marine deposition. Th e variety of processes influencing the composition of Unit III (volcanism, siliciclastic sedimentation, and alteration) suggests a complex history of sedimentation and postdepositional diagenesis.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit V (Hole $\mathrm{U1579D=720.90{-}725.47\;m\;C S F{-}A})$ consists of a ${\sim}5\;\mathrm{m}$ interval o f greenish gray sediments that were recovered between basalt Units IV and VI (see below). Unit V i s of a similar lithologic character to Unit III but is physically separated from Unit III by basalt Uni t IV. Like Unit III, Unit V consists of well-lithified greenish gray zeolitic siltstone and sandston e sediments with glauconite. The lower contact of the sediments of Unit $_\mathrm{V}$ with the underlyin g basalt of Unit VI at ${\sim}725\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A provides important clues to the emplacement of the basalt. Across the ${\sim}50~\mathrm{cm}$ immediately above the contact, sediment color gradually lightens downcor e from greenish gray to light greenish gray, and individual grains and sedimentary structure s become less distinct. This change in sedimentary character is interpreted as evidence for contac t metamorphism in the sediment due to heating following intrusion of Unit VI.  

# 4.1.3.2. Igneous petrology  

Igneous rocks were encountered at $697.0\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hole U1579D below sedimentary Lithostratigraphic Unit III (Figure F7). A $23.8~\mathrm{m}$ massive interval (Unit IV) was cored between 697. 0 and $720.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, below which a $4.57\,\mathrm{~m~}$ sedimentary sequence (Unit V) was encountere d $(720.8\mathrm{-}725.3\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ ). This sequence is underlain by another massive igneous unit (Unit VI; $725.3–727.2\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A})$ , of which $1.8\;\mathrm{m}$ was cored before drilling in Hole U1579D was terminate d at a final depth of $727.2\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . Lithostratigraphic Unit IV (Igneous Unit 1; 697.00–720.77  m CSF-A) is composed of plagioclase-clinopyroxene phyric basalt. The unit grades downsectio n toward less vesicular and more coarse-grained textures, and the central portion of the unit is wel l crystallized and medium grained. From the central part of the unit downsection, the groundmas s grain size decreases to fine grained and eventually aphanitic at its lower contact. No abrupt o r significant lithologic changes (e.g., different mineralogy or multiple cooling units) could be recognized in the $23.8\;\mathrm{m}$ igneous succession of Lithostratigraphic Unit IV (Igneous Unit 1). Lithostratigraphic Unit VI (Igneous Unit 2; 725.47–727.285 m CSF-A) is composed of nearly aphyric basalt, is moderately vesicular (all vesicles are filled with alteration minerals), and shows a fine-graine d groundmass.  

Basalt Lithostratigraphic Units IV and VI in Hole U1579D are interpreted to be sills based on systematic lithologic variations toward their upper and lower margins and the characteristics of th e sediments at the contact zones. Both units show relatively wide $(>\!20{\mathrm{~cm}})$ chilled (and altered ) zones without significant brecciation. Unit IV, which was completely cored, also shows a spatia l increase in groundmass grain size toward its center. Accordingly, both units show more characteristics of sills than lava flows. More importantly, the sediments at the contact zones above both th e upper and lower igneous bodies show alteration reactions such as brick red colored streaks characteristic of thermal “baking” as well as bleaching and recrystallization.  

# 4.1.3.3. Micropaleontology  

The sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1579 contains calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, siliceous microfossils, and palynomorphs in varying abundance and preservation. Calcareou s nannofossils are generally abundant and moderately to well preserved above $635\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A (Lithostratigraphic Units I and II) and provide the primary means of biostratigraphic age control for th e calcareous sediments recovered at Site U1579. Planktonic foraminifers are also generally abundan t and moderately to well preserved above $635\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and also provide supporting age control fo r the calcareous sediments. Benthic foraminifers, however, are present in significantly fewer numbers. Radiolarians, together with sparse silicoflagellates and diatoms, are present only across th e EOT interval. Palynomorphs, including dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), pollen, and spores, ar e found in discrete organic-rich layers below $635\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and provide important age control in th e lower part of the sedimentary succession (Unit III), which is nearly devoid of carbonate and siliceous microfossils.  

# 4.1.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic measurements were performed on all archive section halves from Site U1579, i n addition to 131 discrete samples. The primary purpose of these measurements was to determin e magnetic polarity stratigraphy. However, additional rock magnetic experiments (anisotropy o f magnetic susceptibility [AMS] and isothermal remanent magnetization [IRM] acquisition) wer e performed to further inform the reliability of magnetic signals, magnetic fabric, and environmental/postdepositional processes.  

In Lithostratigraphic Unit I and Subunit IIa (foraminiferal and nannofossil oozes; 0 to ${\sim}145\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), a reliable magnetostratigraphy was not determined because of the low magnetizatio n intensities of the samples. In Subunits IIb and IIc (nannofossil and calcareous chalks; ${\sim}145{-}635\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) and Unit III (zeolitic siltstones and sandstones; ${\sim}635{-}697\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}\$ ), the determination o f a complete magnetostratigraphy is also not possible, again because of the low magnetization of th e samples. Using biostratigraphic constraints, however, in some regions of Subunit IIb and Unit III i t is possible to determine distinct polarities and correlate these to chrons within the geomagneti c polarity timescale (GPTS) from the Geologic Time Scale 2020 (GTS2020) (Gradstein et al., 2020; Ogg, 2020). These include chrons C24n.3n, $C27\mathbf{n}$ , C27r, $C28\boldsymbol{\mathrm{n}}$ , C28r, $C29\boldsymbol{\mathrm{n}}$ , $C29\mathrm{r}$ , C33r, and C34n. All of the zeolitic siltstone to sandstone with glauconite and the basalt units have normal polarit y that are assigned to Chron C34n.  

# 4.1.3.5. Stratigraphic correlation  

The physical property records of Holes U1579A–U1579D were compared and correlated, wher e possible, to establish a common depth scale. Tie points were identified using natural gamma radiation (NGR), magnetic susceptibility (MS) from Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL), color reflectance data, high-resolution digital core images, and red-green-blue (RGB) color spac e data extracted from the digital core images. A composite record was spliced for the upper $147~\mathrm{m}$ core composite depth below seafloor (CCSF) of the recovered stratigraphic succession. Smal l recovery gaps in the composite record exist at 66.00–66.57 and $93.54{-}93.68\;\mathrm{m}$ CCSF. From 147 t o 163.87 m CCSF, a complete composite record could not be established due to a lack of overlappin g cores from parallel holes. From 163.87 to 182.07 m CCSF, a composite record was made stitchin g cores together from Holes U1579B and U1579D. Below 182.07 m CCSF, cores from Hole U1579 D do not have parallel drilled sections.  

Recognition of matching patterns in NGR records from cores and natural gamma ray from wireline logging in Hole U1579D permitted translation of core depth scales from the CSF-A scale t o the WMSF scale. The correlation between NGR signals in the retrieved sediment core and natura l gamma ray in the downhole logging data sets is excellent, allowing the segments of recovered cor e intervals to be tightly correlated to the continuous borehole logging data.  

# 4.1.3.6. Chronostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, dinocysts, and magnetostratigraphy provide age control for the Santonian–Lower Miocene sediments recovered at Site U1579. Very few age constraints were identified in shipboard work for the lowermost part of the sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1579 (below ${\sim}600\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). However, an early Santonian ag e $(86.8{-}85.2\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is indicated based on the dinocyst assemblage, which is consistent with the interpretation of the persistent normal polarity in this interval to represent Magnetochron $C34\mathrm{n}$ (th e Cretaceous Normal Superchron). Calcareous nannofossil, planktonic foraminiferal, and benthi c foraminiferal  biostratigraphy  and  magnetostratigraphy  further  constrain  the  age  of  th e sedimentary sequence between $\mathord{\sim}608$ and $505\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to the Late Cretaceous Campanian an d Maastrichtian stages $(83.7{-}66.0\;\mathrm{Ma})$ . The Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary was recovered in Cor e 392-U1579D-33R, with the base of the Paleocene identified at a thin greenish gray clay. This placement was confirmed by benthic foraminiferal biostratigraphy, in addition to the top of Cretaceou s calcareous nannoflora, which demarcates the end of the Cretaceous. The identification of the to p of Magnetochron C30n at ${\sim}438\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A supports this interpretation.  

Calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy provides the primary means of age control for Paleocene– Lower Miocene sediments recovered in the upper part of Site U1579, with support from planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. The basal Eocene ( ${\sim}56.0\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) wa s identified in Core 392-U1579D-16R. Between the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary and basa l Eocene, 14 nannofossil biohorizons and six paleomagnetic reversals provide good age control fo r the Paleocene sediments. The Eocene/Oligocene boundary $\left(33.9\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ is identified between ${\sim}175$ and ${\sim}168\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Between the basal Eocene and Eocene/Oligocene boundary, 18 nannofossi l biohorizons and 2 paleomagnetic reversals provide good age control for the Eocene section of Sit e U1579.  

Near the top of the recovered sedimentary section at Site U1579, a disconformity separates a thi n veneer $_{\sim1-6\mathrm{~m~}}$ thick) of Pleistocene sediments from the underlying sediments, which are date d to approximately the Oligocene/Miocene boundary $(23.04\;\mathrm{Ma})$ based on calcareous nannofossi l biostratigraphy. Thirteen calcareous nannofossil and three foraminifer datums provide good ag e control for the Oligocene sediments recovered at Site U1579 ( $_{\sim168}$ to $_{1-6\textrm{m}}$ CSF-A).  

# 4.1.3.7. Geochemistry  

The geochemistry program at Site U1579 was designed to characterize the composition of bul k sediment and interstitial water (IW) and report on the presence and abundance of volatile hydrocarbons for routine safety monitoring. In total, 73 headspace samples were analyzed for routin e safety monitoring. Methane concentrations are overall very low throughout Site U1579, generall y ranging 0–12 ppmv, with the highest methane concentration of 21 ppmv observed at $386.92\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Higher hydrocarbons are not detected, except at $420.94\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, where traces of isopentane (0.14 ppmv) are present.  

IW samples were analyzed for Holes U1579A–U1579D to 497.08 m CSF-A, below which IW wa s not extractable. IW alkalinity, $\mathsf{p H}$ , and major anion and cation concentrations all show distinctiv e downhole trends. From the seafloor to 496.98 m CSF-A, alkalinity values increase from 2.9 to 15. 4 $\mathbf{m}\mathbf{M}$ and $\mathsf{p H}$ values decrease from $\mathord{\sim}7.7$ to ${\sim}7.0$ . Sulfate decreases from ${\sim}29\,\mathrm{\mM}$ immediatel y below the seafloor to ${\sim}22\ \mathrm{mM}$ at ${\sim}280~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and then remains relatively constant downhol e to ${\sim}497\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Chloride and sodium both increase downhole above their seawater values (55 7 and $481\;\mathrm{mM}_{\mathrm{3}}$ , respectively) to roughly 610 and $510~\mathrm{mM}$ , respectively, at ${\sim}497~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Calciu m increases downhole from $10.77\;\mathrm{mM}$ immediately below the seafloor to $27.54~\mathrm{mM}$ at ${\sim}497\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA, and magnesium decreases downhole from 51.68 to $46.14\,\mathrm{mM}$ at $253\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A before increasin g to ${\sim}49\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the base of the record.  

Sediment samples were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen concentration in Holes U1579A– U1579D to $695.68\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. In the upper ${\sim}450\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of the sedimentary sequences, carbonat e concentration is high $(\sim\!60\!-\!95\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ), which is consistent with the deposition of largely pelagic nannofossil ooze and chalks. Significant variability in carbonate content is observed between $\mathord{\sim}150$ and $300\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , and generally lower carbonate concentrations are found below ${\sim}450\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Below ${\sim}630\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ (Lithostratigraphic Unit III), carbonate content decreases to an average o f ${\sim}24\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ; the carbonate in this lower interval may include other carbonate minerals such as siderite and dolomite. The average TOC content of Site U1579 sediment samples is $0.324\pm0.19\;\mathrm{wt}\%_{}$ with minimum and maximum concentrations of 0 and $0.99~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively. The low organi c carbon content reflects the calcareous ooze and chalk character of Units I and II.  

# 4.1.3.8. Physical properties  

Physical properties of sediments and igneous rocks recovered at Site U1579 were measured o n whole-round core sections, split half core sections, and discrete samples from each hole at the sit e to a total depth of $727.3\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ . In the upper $182~\mathrm{m}$ of the site, the holes overlap stratigraphically, and physical property data were used to construct a near-complete composite splice (se e  

# Stratigraphic correlation).  

NGR and MS vary between the lithostratigraphic units (Figure F7). Lithostratigraphic Unit I i s characterized by relatively high NGR and low MS values, and Subunit IIa (Hole $\mathrm{U}1579\mathrm{B}=6.13-$ $147.10\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) has lower average values for both parameters. Greater variability is observed i n Subunits IIb and IIc $(149.40{-}634.72\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF-A}})$ ). In the basalts of Unit IV (697.00–720.77 m CSF-A ) and Unit VI (725.47–727.29 m CSF-A), NGR values are lower and MS shows the highest values.  

Moisture and density (MAD) analyses were performed on 139 discrete samples. Bulk densit y increases downhole following a general trend of porosity reduction. Density values are higher i n  

Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIc but low in Unit III. Contact $P$ -wave velocities were measured wit h the $P$ -wave caliper (PWC) system from working-half sections (1–2 per core; total $=163^{"}$ ) and fro m three discrete cubic samples (nine measurements). In Lithostratigraphic Unit I and Subunit IIa $\left(0-\right.$ $147.10\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), $P$ -wave velocities vary in a narrow range of $1560{-}1600~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Higher $P$ -wav e velocities of ${\sim}2000{-}2150\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ characterize the nannofossil chalk of Subunit IIb to ${\sim}500\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. In the chert-rich nannofossil chalk of Subunit IIc, velocity significantly increases to 2500–350 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ between 556 and $635\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Average $P$ -wave velocities in the underlying altered zeoliti c siltstones and sandstones (Units III and V) and basalts (Units IV and VI) are $2500{-}3000\ \mathrm{m/s}$ an d $4500{-}5600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , respectively.  

Thermal conductivity measured on soft-sediment whole-round sections show a general increas e downhole. Values are higher in the basalts of Lithostratigraphic Unit IV $({\sim}700{-}720\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A), and lower values in this range reflect more vesicular textures and interbedded sediments.  

# 4.1.3.9. Downhole measurements  

Hole U1579D was logged using the quad combo tool string, which consisted of the MSS, HNGS, HRLA, DSI, and HLDS. A high-resolution run between 450 and $250\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WMSF}$ covering the condensed Eocene–Oligocene interval was followed by a normal resolution pass over the full depth o f Hole U1579D. Natural gamma ray values show variation with lithology, and the highest values ar e in the zeolitic silicified silt- and sandstones. Lithostratigraphic Unit IV basalts (below $697\,\mathrm{~m~}$ WMSF) show the lowest values. Increased resistivity corresponds to zones of chalk beds with claystone and chert in Subunit IIc (see Lithostratigraphy). The highest resistivity values (100–30 0 $\Omega\mathbf{m})$ ) were recorded in Unit IV basalts. The downhole wireline density generally follows the $P.$ - wave velocity trend. There is a distinct offset between the $P$ -wave velocities measured on the core s and downhole. In Subunit IIb (200–556 m WMSF) the $P$ -wave velocity is $2000{-}2500\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , which i s about $300\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ higher than measured in the laboratory.  

# 4.2. Site U1580  

# 4.2.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1580 (proposed Site AP-09B) is located on the southern central Agulhas Platea u $(40^{\circ}47.1535^{\prime}\mathrm{S}/26^{\circ}36.4137^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ at $2560~\mathrm{m}$ water depth. The site lies about $100~\mathrm{km}$ southeast of Sit e U1579. Bathymetric data show Site U1580 to be located on the flank of a bathymetric high that i s underlain by a number of basement highs, as revealed by seismic data. A rugged topography characterizes the top of the interpreted basement. Below this horizon, reflections have been observe d dipping away from the basement highs in all directions. The basement highs have thus been interpreted as extrusion centers (Figure F8). The seismic data show a chaotic layer topped by Reflecto r M with a strong reflection amplitude. Another strong seismic horizon, Reflector LE, can b e observed. Both Reflectors M and LE follow the basement topography. The sequence above Reflector LE shows parallel to subparallel continuous reflections of middle to strong amplitude. Th e youngest part of this sequence is affected by erosion at the seafloor (Figure F8).  

Site U1580 was chosen to recover both Cretaceous and Paleogene sedimentary records and basement samples. This site was especially dedicated to recover an extended record of basement material to unravel the nature of the basement and provide information on its formation age. Potentia l late-stage magmatism and its effect on sedimentary sequences and the environment are additiona l objectives. Integration of seismic profiles with the drilling results will allow direct dating of th e observed seismic unconformities M and LE and interpreting their causes, and recovery of the sediment/basement interface will provide information on the age of the oldest sediments above th e basement as well as the water depth and environment at the time of deposition. At this site,  a sediment sequence from the mid-Cretaceous to mid-Paleogene was expected to be drilled, spanning the long-term climate transition from the Cretaceous greenhouse to the mid-Paleogene icehouse. Critical intervals of ocean/climate transitions such as Oi1 glaciation, the Paleocene/Eocen e Thermal Maximum (PETM), the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, and OAE 2 and OAE 3 wer e expected to be documented in the sedimentary record. The nature and age of the basement woul d also be unraveled by drilling at this site.  

# 4.2.2. Operations  

The vessel arrived at Site U1580 at $1306\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 February 2022. The thrusters were lowered, an d the vessel switched from cruise mode to dynamic positioning (DP) mode at $1326\,\mathrm{h}$ . Hole U1580 A was spudded using the RCB system at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ , with Core 1R recovering $6.82\,\mathrm{m}$ . For the next severa l days, RCB coring continued through Core 42R, advancing from 9.7 to $407.4\mathrm{~m~}$ and recoverin g $250.38\mathrm{~m~}(63\%)$ . Site U1580 hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered ar e listed in Table T1.  

At ${\sim}1700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 March, the ROP on Core 392-U1580A-43R slowed to almost zero and no noticeable progress was being made. Following an additional short advance with no recovery in Cor e 44R, the bit deplugger (a core barrel with a pointed, metal tip) was dropped twice in an attempt t o clear any material blocking the bit. Core 45R then advanced $3.2\textrm{m}$ and recovered $3.25~\mathrm{m}$ . It wa s determined from recovered pieces that a chert layer of loosened rock was slowing the ROP an d preventing recovery.  

The sediment/basalt contact was difficult to determine based on coring parameters, likely due t o multiple chert/silicified horizons in the sediments immediately overlying the basalts that resulte d in very low overall ROP. Although core recovery was low, pieces of basalt were recovered in Core s 392-U1580A-43R and 45R, and a good basalt contact was cored at ${\sim}419{-}420\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A in Cor e 47R on 2 March. Coring in Hole U1580A continued until $1630~\mathrm{h}$ on 5 March to a final depth o f $533.9\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The basalt below ${\sim}495\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A cored at a ROP of $3{-}5\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , which is very fast fo r hard rock, and with good recovery. The overall ROP for RCB in Hole U1580A was $4.4~\mathrm{m/h}$ .  

At $1630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 March, the driller pumped a final sweep to clean the hole, flushing the mud completely out of the hole. The mechanical bit release tool was lowered, and the bit dropped at $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ . The drill string was tripped up to $80.7~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in preparation for downhole logging. At $2145~\mathrm{h}$ , the first logging string, the triple combination (triple combo), was assembled. The triple comb o consists of the HNGS, HLDS, and MSS. The triple combo continued downlogging to a tag dept h of $524.2\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{WMSF}$ . The logging run was completed, and the tool was out of the hole at $0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on  6 March. For the next downhole logging run, the Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic suite wa s assembled and deployed at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ . The FMS-sonic tool consists of the FMS, DSI, and HNGS. Tw o passes were conducted, with both reaching the bottom of the hole at ${\sim}521.5\;\mathrm{m}$ WMSF. The tool s were back at the surface at $1535~\mathrm{h}$ . For the final downhole logging run, the Ultrasonic Borehol e Imager (UBI) tool string consisted of the UBI, General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT), an d HNGS.

TWT $=$ two-way traveltime, $\sf{Z S}{=}$ zeolitic silicified sediments.  

The UBI tool string was run in the hole at $1610\,\mathrm{h}$ . One pass was completed to 504.5 m WMSF. Th e second pass was aborted after difficulties, and it was later determined that the transducer subassembly motor was sticking. The UBI logging run was completed with the tools at the surface a t $0020\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 March. The drill pipe cleared the rig floor at $0705\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1580A. A total o f 68 cores were taken in Hole U1580A over a $533.9\mathrm{~m~}$ interval (recovery $=65.7\%$ ). Total time o n Hole U1580A was $232.8\,\mathrm{h}$ (9.73 days).  

A new $_{\mathrm{C-4~RCB}}$ bit was prepared, and after lowering the drill pipe to near the seafloor, the vesse l was offset $20\,\mathrm{m}$ east. An RCB core barrel with center bit was installed, and Hole U1580B was spudded at $1710\,\mathrm{h}$ from a seafloor depth of $2571.5\:\mathrm{m}$ drilling depth below rig floor (DRF). The hole wa s drilled to $40.0\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , and we used the RCB system to take Cores 2R–5R (to $77.8\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). Th e drill pipe was tripped back to the ship and cleared the rig floor at $1430~\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1580B. The ROP for RCB coring averaged $7.2\;\mathrm{m/h}$ , and the $40\;\mathrm{m}$ drill down averaged $14.6\;\mathrm{m/h}$ . A total o f four cores were taken in Hole U1580B over a $37.8~\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=62.9\%$ ). Total time o n Hole U1580B was $31.44\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.31 days).  

# 4.2.3. Principal results  

# 4.2.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1580 consists of a $528.58\mathrm{~m~}$ sequence of calcareous and siliciclastic sediments and basalt. Basalt and sediments are interbedded in the lowermost ${\sim}120\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of the section. Fourteen lithostratigraphic units are defined (Figure F9), and Units II and III are further divided into five subunits (IIa, IIb, IIc, IIIa, and IIIb). Units I–III, V, VII, IX, XI, and XIII are largely composed o f calcareous chalks and siliciclastic sandstones, siltstones, and claystones, whereas Units IV, VI, VII, X, XII, and XIV are basalt.  

Unit I ( $0.00{-}3.42\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{(}$ CSF-A) consists of light gray to light brown foraminiferal ooze with nannofossils. The lower contact with Unit II at $3.42~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A is severely deformed by drilling disturbanc e and is marked by a downcore change to white nannofossil ooze below the contact. Unit II (3.42– $293.51\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A) is a ${\sim}290~\mathrm{m}$ sequence of Eocene–Santonian nannofossil ooze and chalk that i s divided into Subunits IIa–IIc. Subunit IIa $(3.42{-}16.73\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ ) is $13.31\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and is characterized by massively bedded pale yellow to light greenish gray nannofossil ooze. Subunit IIb (19.40– $207.11\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) consists of ${\sim}188\mathrm{~m~}$ of white to light greenish gray nannofossil chalk; it is mor e lithified chalk (versus ooze in the overlying subunit) and has higher carbonate content than Subunit IIa. Subunit IIc $(207.11{-}293.51\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ is $86.40~\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists of light greenish gra y calcareous chalk with cyclic bands of greenish gray or reddish brown clayey calcareous chalk, wit h occasional chert layers. The boundary between Subunits IIb and IIc is associated with an increas e in MS and NGR values between $\mathord{\sim}200$ and $220\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Carbonate content in Subunit IIc is generally high $({\sim}80{-}95~\mathrm{wt\%})$ ; however, it is more variable than in Subunits IIa and IIb, which likel y reflects lower carbonate content in the brown and green clay-rich intervals. The Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary occurs in Subunit IIc between ${\sim}207.0$ and $211.5\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}$ in an interval characterized by intense bioturbation and alternating bands of darker reddish brown claye y nannofossil chalk and lighter greenish gray nannofossil chalk with clay.  

The Unit II/III boundary at $293.51\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A is marked by a gradational change from reddish whit e calcareous chalk to green zeolitic clastic sediments, corresponding to a notable decrease in carbonate content and a sharp increase in MS, drop in thermal conductivity, and increase in porosity. Unit III is $113.96\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and is divided into Subunits IIIa and IIIb. Subunit IIIa (293.51–349.98  m CSF-A) is characterized by green zeolitic sandstones, siltstones, and claystones (Figure F9) an d has lower boundaries of calcareous microfossils and lower carbonate content relative to the overlying units. Subunit IIIb (349.98–407.46 m CSF-A) is composed of light green, dark green, an d light red calcareous sandstones, siltstones and claystones. The light green intervals of Subunit III b are calcareous chalk and contain common to abundant calcareous microfossils as well as carbonate mineral grains.  

The first downhole occurrence of igneous rocks in Hole U1580A is at 407.46 m CSF-A $\mathrm{^{407.46}\,m}$ CCSF), defined as the top of Lithostratigraphic Unit IV (Figure F9). The contact between Subuni t IIIb and the underlying basaltic Unit IV was not recovered. Below Unit IV at Site U1580, sediments are interbedded with basalts (see Igneous petrology), consisting of Units V, VII, IX, XI, an d XIII. Unit V (411.76–412.82 m CSF-A; 411.76–413.16 m CCSF) consists of bluish gray to ligh t reddish gray, thinly laminated silicified limestone and chert. Unit VII (426.25–426.27 m CSF-A; $423.78\mathrm{-}423.80~\mathrm{m}~\mathrm{CCSF})$ ) is a thin ${\sim}2~\mathrm{cm}$ interval of calcareous chalk that is bounded by basal t above and below, which preliminary downhole log analysis suggests may be representative of  a sedimentary interval up to ${\sim}1\mathrm{-}2\mathrm{~m~}$ thick. Unit IX (438.97–439.49 m CSF-A; 439.90–440.42  m CCSF) is a $52\,\mathrm{cm}$ interval of black chert that contains several white intersecting calcite veins. Uni t XI (466.63–471.60 m CSF-A; 467.09–471.60 m CCSF) consists of gray to black calcareous chalk, nannofossil-rich claystone, silicified limestone, and chert and includes an interval of abundan t inoceramid (bivalve) fragments. Unit XIII (478.53–490.54 m CSF-A; $478.53{-}490.54\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CCSF}$ ), th e lowermost sedimentary unit recovered at Site U1580, consists of mixed lithologies includin g greenish gray, light brownish gray, and gray calcareous chalk; black claystone; siltstone; and claye y calcareous chalk.

# 4.2.3.2. Igneous petrology  

A sequence of igneous units of varying thickness intercalated with sedimentary intervals wa s recovered in Lithostratigraphic Units IV–XIV in the lowermost ${\sim}120\;\mathrm{m}$ of Hole U1580A (407.46– $528.58\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A; 407.46–529.59 m CCSF) (Figure F9). Coring of the igneous intervals in thi s sequence yielded excellent recovery (average $=\sim\!84\%$ ). All igneous rocks recovered at Site U158 0 are classified as aphyric or slightly plagioclase and/or olivine phyric basalts, with 10 igneous unit s defined on the basis of differences in macro- and microscopic texture and identifiable contacts. Throughout the recovered basalts, olivine crystals, as phenocrysts or in the groundmass, are completely replaced by alteration phases (predominantly clay minerals), contributing to the overal l moderate-to-high degree of alteration of these units. In addition to near-continuous recovery o f igneous successions, isolated basalt fragments were also recovered in primarily sedimentary intervals. For instance, Unit XIII (478.53–490.54 m CSF-A; 478.53–490.54 m CCSF), which mainl y comprises calcareous chalk, claystone, and siltstone, also contains three unoriented pieces o f basalt; these basalt cobbles are distinct from the igneous units above and below Unit XIII an d likely represent a thin interval of basalt not coherently recovered at ${\sim}488\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A.  

The intercalation of igneous bodies and sediment packages in Hole U1580A implies that thes e igneous units represent either lateral intrusions (sills) or that they were emplaced as lava flows o n which sediments were deposited after each eruption. Based on several lines of evidence, we interpret this igneous succession as sills. Sharp igneous contacts and broad chilled margins (withou t volcanic glass), slow gradational changes in crystallinity (grain size) toward coarsely crystallin e interiors, and certain mineralogic textures (subophitic and doleritic) of the recovered units resemble sills rather than lava flows. Additional compelling evidence for sill intrusions into sedimentar y deposits is the thermal overprint or “baking” (contact metamorphism) of the adjacent sedimentary lithology, which is repeatedly observed in Hole U1580A. Similar reactions may also appea r beneath thick lava flows but would not be expected above a flow because any sediments deposite d on an existing lava body should be younger in age.  

The recovery of such an extensive $(>\!120\,\mathrm{m})$ sill complex near the center of the Agulhas Plateau an d at such high stratigraphic position (with respect to the bulk of the seismically defined platea u “basement”) was not expected. According to biostratigraphically constrained ages, the sills in Hol e U1580A were intruded into sediments of late Cenomanian to Turonian or possibly Coniacian age, implying the sills to be younger. Such late-stage or “rejuvenated magmatism” of oceanic plateaus i s often characterized by alkaline composition. However, preliminary geochemical data of the recovered basalts (Sites U1579 and U1580) indicate that the sills have a tholeiitic composition, which i s characteristic of the main plateau building phase of oceanic LIPs. Postcruise research on the sill s cored at Site U1580 will investigate links to the two sills that were also cored $98~\mathrm{km}$ away at th e base of Hole U1579D.  

# 4.2.3.3. Micropaleontology  

The sedimentary intervals of the $525.58\;\mathrm{m}$ succession cored at Site U1580 contain calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, siliceous microfossils, and palynomorphs in varying abundance and preservation state. Calcareous nannofossils are abundant and moderately to well preserved i n Paleogene and Pleistocene sediments $({\sim}0{-}205\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ , whereas abundance of calcareous nannofossils is more variable and preservation is generally poor to moderate in Cretaceous sediment s $(\mathrm{\sim}205\mathrm{-}491\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ , and some samples are barren. Despite variable preservation and abundance, nannofossils are present throughout the recovered sediment and provide excellent biostratigraphic control for the Paleogene and reasonably good control for the Cretaceous. Foraminifer s are abundant and generally well preserved in the upper part of Site U1580. Below ${\sim}115\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, foraminiferal abundance decreases and preservation deteriorates, although in some intervals o f poor preservation delicate morphological features such as pore structures are preserved. Radiolarian fragments, as well as pyritized diatoms and radiolarians, were encountered in only a few samples from Site U1580. Trace numbers of palynofacies consisting of black phytoclasts are present i n the Paleocene to lower Eocene sediments, whereas dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts), miospores, an d black phytoclasts are rare to abundant in the Cretaceous sediments, with some samples showin g thermal alteration in the color of the palynomorphs.  

# 4.2.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic measurements were undertaken on all archive section halves from Holes U1580 A and U1580B and on 68 discrete samples from Hole U1580A. Demagnetization experiments an d rock magnetic analyses were also performed to constrain magnetic polarity and the magnetic mineralogy of the sedimentary and igneous units defined at Site U1580 (Figure F9). Paleomagneti c results indicate that the units sampled at Site U1580 are reliable recorders of magnetic field direction. Magnetic polarity was determined for 61 of the 68 cores measured from Hole U1580A and al l four cores measured from Hole U1580B. Fifteen magnetic reversals were identified, and norma l and reversed polarity intervals were correlated to chrons within the GPTS from the GTS202 0 (Gradstein et al., 2020; Ogg, 2020). In combination with biostratigraphic results, these reversal s were successfully correlated to the GPTS and span from the top of Chron C25n to the top o f Chron C33n $^{\prime}{\sim}57{-}74\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ; Thanetian–Campanian).  

Rock magnetic results from Site U1580 indicate that the dominant magnetic mineralogy is a combination of both ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic minerals, likely magnetite and hematite. Both occur in sedimentary Lithostratigraphic Unit I through Subunit IIc $({\sim}0{-}300\mathrm{~m~}\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ , which transitions to dominantly ferrimagnetic minerals in Units III–XIV ${\sim}300{-}530\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). AMS measurements indicate that sedimentary units recovered at Site U1580 possess a typica l oblate sedimentary fabric and that the basalts lack strong magnetic fabrics.  

# 4.2.3.5. Stratigraphic correlation  

At Site U1580, two holes were RCB cored: Hole U1580A to $533.9\,\mathrm{~m~}$ DSF (deepest recovery $=$ $528.58\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) and Hole U1580B from 40.0 to $77.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DSF (deepest recovery $=74.14\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A). In the interval where the stratigraphy of the holes overlapped (Cores 392-U1580A-5R through 8 R [38.80–72.82 m CSF-A] and 392-U1580B-2R through 5R $[40.00{-}74.14\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}]$ ), recovery wa s $68\%$ in Hole U1580A and $63\%$ in Hole U1580B. Core breaks aligned between Holes U1580A an d U1580B, and Cores 392-U1580A-5R through 8R and 392-U1580B-2R through 5R showed signs o f drilling disturbance, hampering the construction of a splice. Compiled records of the cored intervals at Site U1580 demonstrate $66\%$ recovery of the drilled interval spanning sediments of lat e Cenomanian to early Eocene age, as well as igneous rocks. A CCSF depth scale is provided fo r Hole U1580A to enable visualization of results without overlap of recovered intervals betwee n cores.  

# 4.2.3.6. Chronostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils, planktonic and benthic foraminifers, dinocysts, and magnetostratigraphy provide age control for the uppermost Cenomanian–lower Eocene sediment cores recovere d at Site U1580. In the lowermost sequence of Site U1580, nannofossils constrain the age of sedimentary units interbedded with basalts (Lithostratigraphic Units XI and XIII; $466.63–490.54\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A; $467.09{-}490.54\mathrm{~m~CCSF}$ ) to the latest Cenomanian–earliest Turonian $(\sim\!94\mathrm{\Ma})$ . Unit II I sediments $({\sim}294{-}407\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ overlying the basalts are dated to the Coniacian–Santonian interval $({\sim}84{-}88\ \mathrm{Ma})$ using dinocyst and nannofossil biostratigraphy. Paleomagnetic results show continuous normal polarity throughout Unit III due to deposition during the $C34\mathrm{n}$ Superchron.  

Subunit IIc $(207.11{-}293.51\;\mathrm{m}\,{\mathrm{CSF-A}})$ is dated to the Campanian–early Maastrichtian on the basi s of nannofossil biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. Although several polarity reversals ar e preliminarily correlated to the GPTS in this interval, nannofossil biostratigraphy only provide s broad age constraints, and further higher resolution postcruise study is required. A hiatus i s inferred at ${\sim}224\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, truncating the lower Maastrichtian succession, with a duration of a t least 2 My based on calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. The Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary ${\sim}66\ \mathrm{Ma})$ is identified in Core 392-U1580A-22R between ${\sim}209.0$ an d $211.5\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

Between ${\sim}63$ and $210\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, the Paleocene section of Site U1580 appears to be continuous a t the resolution of 18 shipboard bio- and magnetostratigraphic (Chrons C24r through $C29\mathbf{r}$ ; $\mathord{\sim}56-$ $56\ \mathrm{Ma}^{\mathrm{)}}$ ) age tie points. The Paleocene/Eocene boundary is identified at ${\sim}63\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ in Hol e U1580A and ${\sim}62\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1580B based on nannofossil biostratigraphy, a distinct colo r change, and physical properties. Seven foraminiferal and nannofossil biostratigraphic datums provide age constraints within the lower Eocene succession ( ${\sim}3\mathrm{-}63\mathrm{\,m}$ CSF-A), constraining the age t o ${\sim}53.6{-}56\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Because of low magnetization intensity, no magnetic reversals were identified in th e lower Eocene section of Site U1580. The uppermost sediments recovered at Site U1580 (Unit I; 0– $3.42\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ), which rest on a hiatal surface above the Eocene sediments below, are dated to th e Pleistocene based on foraminiferal and nannofossil biostratigraphy.  

# 4.2.3.7. Geochemistry  

The geochemistry program at Site U1580 was designed to characterize the composition of bul k sediment and IW and diagnose the abundance of volatile hydrocarbons for routine safety monitoring. Methane above the detection limit was not found in any samples. Traces of propene (17.3 5 ppmv), iso-pentane (5.75 ppmv), iso-hexane (3.87 ppmv), and h-hexane (2.12 ppmv) were detecte d at ${\sim}87~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

IW samples were analyzed in Hole U1580A to $356.16\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , below which IW was not extractable. IW alkalinity, $\mathsf{p H}$ , and major anion and cation concentrations all show distinctive downhol e trends. Alkalinity values decrease from roughly $2.9\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the top of the sedimentary sequence t o $0.3\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $311.27\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. pH values are relatively constant at 7.4 to $-7.7$ throughout the uppe r $185~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and increase to 7.7–8.3 below $295\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Of the major anions, sulfate decrease s from ${\sim}28~\mathrm{mM}$ at $3.75~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to ${\sim}22~\mathrm{mM}$ at ${\sim}356\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and chloride increases downhol e from $573\;\mathrm{mM}$ to values exceeding $600\;\mathrm{mM}$ below ${\sim}300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The major cation sodium show s a slight decrease from its seawater value $(481\;\mathrm{mM})$ in the upper part of the hole to ${\sim}328\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A; below this depth, it decreases to $452\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $356.16\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Calcium increases from ${\sim}10.7~\mathrm{mM}$ at $3.75\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to $86.1~\mathrm{mM}$ at ${\sim}343\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Magnesium inversely mirrors the calcium profil e and decreases from $51.3\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $3.75~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $3.1~\mathrm{mM}$ at $343.81\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Potassium notabl y decreases downhole from $11.78\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $3.75\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $1.16\;\mathrm{mM}$ at 343.81 m CSF-A.  

In total, 83 sediment samples from Site U1580 were analyzed for bulk carbon and nitrogen conten t to $485.99\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Total carbon (TC) and $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ range $0{-}14.5~\mathrm{wt}\%$ and $0{-}97\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively, which is consistent with the observed pelagic nannofossil oozes and chalks, zeolitic sand/siltstones, limestone, and claystone lithologies. Average TOC is $0.64\%\,\pm\,0.27\%$ with minimum an d maximum concentrations of $0\%$ and $9.34\%$ , respectively. Five samples with TOC content exceeding $1\%$ are from below ${\sim}315\mathrm{~m~CFS{-}A}$ , and two samples composed of calcareous siltstone an d black claystone exceed $5\%$ and are from the lowest part of the hole deeper than $410\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

Samples from nine representative sills drilled at Site U1580 were selected for inductively couple d plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analyses. Based on classic discrimination diagrams for igneous rocks, all three samples classify as tholeiitic basalts, plotting together wit h tholeiitic lavas from the neighboring Mozambique Ridge and the only hitherto available basemen t (dredge) samples from the Agulhas Plateau.  

# 4.2.3.8. Physical properties  

Physical properties of sediments and igneous rocks recovered at Site U1580 were measured o n whole-round core sections, split half core sections, and discrete samples to a total depth of 528.5 8 m CSF-A in Hole U1580A. Complementary downhole logging data sets were also collected fro m Hole U1580A. Between ${\sim}40$ and $74\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, cores from Hole U1580A and Hole U1580B overla p stratigraphically. Measured variations in physical properties arise from lithification with increasing burial depth and from variations in lithologic composition. The upper part of this interva l shows small variations in MS, NGR, $P$ -wave velocity, and density (Lithostratigraphic Unit I an d Subunits IIa and IIb; 0 to ${\sim}208\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). The overall higher $P$ -wave velocities and densities an d color change toward darker and more reddish layers in the lower part of Subunit IIb are attribute d to diagenetic changes and an increase in clay content. Anomalous physical properties downhol e were recorded in the zeolitic sandstone, siltstones, and claystones of Subunit IIIa (293.51–349.9 8 m CSF-A), characterized by a decrease in bulk density, increase in porosity, low $P$ -wave velocitie s (as low as ${\sim}2000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s},$ ), and a sharp drop in thermal conductivity compared to the strata above an d below. Increased MS and NGR values also correlate with the zeolitic sediments of Unit II I $(\sim\!293.51\!-\!407.46\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF}–\mathrm{A})$ (Figure F9). Deconvolved Natural Gamma Radiation Logger (NGRL ) spectral data indicate that potassium is enriched to ${\sim}0.5{-}2.0~\mathrm{wt}\%$ in the zeolitic sandstones t o claystones of Unit III, likely reflecting an increase in authigenic minerals rich in potassium such a s glauconite and celadonite. Exceptional peaks in NGR (related to high uranium content) were als o observed in a few dark layers in Cenomanian–Turonian deposits (Unit XII; \~471.6–478.53 m CSFA; 471.60–478.53 m CCSF) sandwiched between basalt layers (Units XI and XIII).  

# 4.2.3.9. Downhole measurements  

Downhole measurements at Site U1580 consisted of wireline logging in Hole U1580A on 5 and  6 March 2022. No downhole temperature data were measured at this site. In addition to standar d sonic and MS data, high-resolution density, natural gamma ray, neutron porosity, electrical resistivity, and FMS and UBI imagery provide a continuous borehole record, documenting lithologie s of unrecovered stratigraphic intervals where coring gaps occurred in Hole U1580A. Downhol e gamma ray spectroscopy data indicate that sediments of Lithostratigraphic Units II and III occup y two distinct compositional domains of potassium/thorium ratios. Potassium-rich Unit III is characterized by anomalously high porosity $(>\!60\%)$ , which is confirmed by MAD analysis. The integrated interpretation of downhole data is instrumental to identify the true thickness of sediment s and nature of their contacts with basalts below $407~\mathrm{m}$ WMSF. The UBI and FMS images displa y various degrees of alteration/fracturing in basalts and sharp transitions to the interbedded sediments. The sedimentary rocks sandwiched in basalt units are characterized by elevated uraniu m content with peaks at about 2 ppm. The cross-dipole setup of acoustic logging enables a detaile d core-to-seismic integration that includes analysis of elastic anisotropy.  

# 4.3. Site U1581  

# 4.3.1. Background and objectives  

Site U1581 (proposed Site TB-01A) is located on the deep, flat part of the Transkei Basi n $(35^{\circ}40.8654^{\prime}\mathrm{S}/29^{\circ}39.0055^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ at $4591\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth. This area of the Transkei Basin has a smoot h bathymetry with water depths between $4000\mathrm{~m~}$ and $4600\mathrm{~m}$ , and no apparent dip can be recognized in the site’s vicinity. The site is located on the crossing point of Seismic Lines AWI-2005000 8 and AWI-20050014. The seismic data show that the Transkei Basin is characterized by th e mounded structure of the Agulhas Drift, an elongate sediment drift about $220\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and risin g about $200\mathrm{~m~}$ above the seafloor (Figure F10). This sequence shows a number of high-amplitud e internal reflections. Below the base Reflector $\textbf{P}$ (pink line, Figure F10) of the Agulhas Drift, th e reflection characteristics change to lower reflectivity. The Agulhas Drift is underlain by the  M Drift, a sediment drift formed during the Oligocene and Miocene (Schlüter and UenzelmannNeben, 2008b). The M Drift shows a strike almost perpendicular to the Agulhas Drift, which i s indicative of a strong change in the direction of the prevalent bottom current. Reflector M dominates the seismic image of the Oribi drift in the middle of the sequence. Reflector E forms the bas e of Seismic Unit 2, which is only up to $30\;\mathrm{m}$ thick. Reflectors K-T and B characterize the deepes t seismic unit above rugged oceanic basement (Figure F10).  

Site U1581 was chosen to recover an Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene sedimentary record, as wel l as a partial Neogene sequence. This site was especially dedicated to target Reflector B in the Cretaceous sequence. This reflector was interpreted to represent black shales, and recovery of material from the reflector and above/below was intended to provide information on the formation o f black shales in connection with ocean anoxia. Integration of seismic profiles with the drillin g results will allow direct dating of the observed seismic unconformities K-T, E, O, M, and $\textbf{P}$ an d interpreting their causes. Further objectives concern paleoenvironment and paleodepth of th e Transkei Basin. At this site, critical intervals of ocean/climate transitions such as Mi1 and Oi1 glaciations, the PETM, the Cretaceous Paleogene boundary, and OAE 2 and OAE 3 were expected t o be documented in the sedimentary record.  

# 4.3.2. Operations  

After completing the $338\;\mathrm{nmi}$ voyage to Site U1581 (proposed Site TB-01A), the vessel arrived o n site at $2345\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 March 2022. The thrusters were lowered, and the ship was switched to full D P mode at $2357\,\mathrm{h}$ . The APC/XCB bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was assembled, and we began tripping pipe to the seafloor. We attempted to shoot the first APC core from 4573.8 meters below se a level (mbsl); however, this resulted in no recovery (water core). Two additional attempts fro m 4578.8 and $4583.8~\mathrm{mbsl}$ also resulted in no recovery. Hole U1581A was successfully spudded a t $2115\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 March, recovering $6.88\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , and the seafloor was calculated at 4591.4 mbsl. APC coring continued to 207.2 m CSF-A (Core 24H). The APCT-3 tool was run on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, an d 13H, with good data collected for all four. Pressure in the pipe increased while drilling the rathol e of Core 24H. A mud sweep was pumped, and the core barrel was pulled back to the surface whil e the crew continued to circulate and condition the hole with an additional two mud sweeps. Sit e U1581 hole locations, water depths, and the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1.  

The core barrel recovered $8.11\,\mathrm{~m~}$ (Core 392-U1581A-25G; the designation for a core with a n uncertain depth). A fray in the core line was discovered and repaired. Cores 26H–29H advanced t o $233.8\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. We then switched to the HLAPC system. Cores 30F–38F advanced to $276.1\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. We then switched to the XCB system, and Cores 39X–41X advanced to $300.5\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ ; however, strong swells and resultant low recovery and poor core quality led to the termination o f coring in Hole U1581A at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 March. A total of 41 cores were taken in Hole U1581A ove r a $300.5\;\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=90.9\%$ ). Total time on Hole U1581A was $104.4\,\mathrm{h}$ (4.35 days).  

The drill string was pulled out of the hole, and pipe was tripped back to the vessel. The bit cleared the rig floor at $0825\ \mathrm{h}$ on 14 March. It was determined that a compassionate evacuation wa s needed for a crew member. An attempt was made to recover the acoustic positioning beacon; however, it was ultimately deemed lost.  

The vessel was switched from DP to cruise mode at $0945\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the thrusters were up and secure d at $1014\,\mathrm{h}$ , beginning the sea passage to Gqeberha (formerly known as Port Elizabeth). The vesse l arrived at the edge of the Gqeberha harbor at approximately $0700\;\mathrm{h}$ on 15 March. Clearance fo r the departing crew member was received at $1300\,\mathrm{h}_{1}$ , and they disembarked the vessel via launch a t $1402\,\mathrm{h}$ . We then began the transit back to Site U1581, arriving just before noon on 16 March. Th e BHA with a C-4 bit was made up and tripped to $4499.7\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF before a slip and cut of the drillin g line. Hole U1581B was spudded at $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 March. An RCB barrel with a center bit was use d to drill ahead to $289\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, with several mud sweeps during the drill down. The ROP durin g the drill down averaged $46.2\,\mathrm{m/h}$ . The center bit was recovered, and coring commenced with Cor e

Figure F10. Seismic Line AWI-20050008 showing Site U1581. Preliminary interpretation of seismic units according to th e chronostratigraphic model are shown. The marked purple reflection corresponds in structure to the top of basement (Figure F5), the brown reflection to what was originally interpreted as a black shale prior to drilling, the pale green reflection t o Reflector O, the red reflection to Reflector M, and the rose reflection to Reflector P.  

2R at $1445\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 March. Coring continued through 24 March with Core 74R at 997.1 m CSF-A, the final depth for Hole U1581B.  

In preparation for downhole logging, the hole was swept with sepiolite mud to flush cuttings an d the bit released at $1835\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 March. The hole was further displaced with mud, and the botto m of the drill string was placed at $77.8\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A for downhole logging.  

The first downhole logging run was with the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI). The tool began it s descent but encountered a solid ledge at $222.4\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The tool was worked up and down fo r almost an hour, but was unsuccessful at passing the ledge. The decision was made to bring the too l back to surface and lower the drill pipe to cover the ledge. The VSI cleared the rig floor, and th e drill pipe was run in to $408.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Because of the lack of daylight for another VSI run,  a modified triple combo tool string was made up with the DSI in place of the HRLA unit. The too l string consisted of the HNGS, HLDS, DSI, and MSS.  

Upon make-up, a problem was found with power to the lower portion of the tool string. This wa s replaced, and the tool string was deployed. At $2606.8\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF (still within the water column), ther e was growing evidence of an electrical fault with the tool. The tool was brought back to the surface, where it was repaired and redeployed. The triple combo tool reached $1300.0\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF but was agai n showing an electrical fault, and the decision was made to terminate logging. The tool string wa s pulled out of the hole, and the cause of the electrical fault was much later determined to be th e conductors in the collector and pinched conductors in the logging head. The triple combo tool s were disassembled, and the drill string was tripped back to the vessel, clearing the seafloor at 055 5 h and the rig floor at $1510\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 March, ending Hole U1581B. A total of 73 cores were taken i n Hole U1581B over a $708.1\;\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=76\%$ ). Total time on Hole U1581B was $243.12\,\mathrm{h}$ (10.13 days).  

# 4.3.3. Principal results  

# 4.3.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

A ${\sim}994\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick Pleistocene–Campanian sedimentary succession composed of calcareous an d siliciclastic sediments was recovered at Site U1581 (Figure F11). The upper part of the successio n is relatively carbonate rich, whereas the lower part is dominantly siliciclastic in composition. Th e sedimentary sequence is divided into Lithostratigraphic Units I and II, both of which are furthe r divided into two subunits (Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb) (Figure F11).  

Unit I $(0.0{-}390.05\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ is a $390\;\mathrm{m}$ sequence of Pleistocene–upper Paleocene biogenic ooz e with variable amounts of sand, silt, and clay. The unit is divided in two subunits (Ia and Ib) on th e basis of a higher concentration of siliciclastic material in Subunit Ib. Subunit Ia (Hole U1581A $=$ $0{-}198.24\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) consists principally of greenish gray, light yellowish brown, and light brow n clayey nannofossil ooze with biosilica, nannofossil ooze, and grayish green foraminifer ooze wit h sand, silt, and clay intervals. The basal contacts of thin sand intervals that overlie nannofossi l oozes are typically sharp or erosive when recovered. Carbonate content in Subunit Ia is highl y variable, ranging between ${\sim}20$ and $80\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ in biogenic intervals and ${<}1\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ in siliciclastic interval s (Figure F11). Subunit Ib (Hole $\mathrm{U1581A}=198.24–262.11\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CS}$ F-A; Hole $\mathrm{U1581B}=289.00{-}390.05$ m CSF-A) consists predominantly of siliciclastic sand, silt, and clay with occasional biogenic sediments (e.g., silty nannofossil ooze). Biogenic sediments are less common in Subunit Ib and occu r as irregular, thin layers within thick packages of sand and silt. Siliciclastic sediments consist o f medium- to fine-grained sand and silt layers that are massive or laminated and are occasionall y normally graded. Carbonate content is generally low $(<\!2\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ in Subunit Ib, except for in discret e decimeter-scale nannofossil-rich intervals, where it can be as high as ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{\wt\%}$ . The contac t between Units I and II at $390.05\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A is marked by a change in lithology from intercalate d siliciclastic and calcareous sediments to dominantly siliciclastic sediments, as well as a decrease i n average carbonate content (Figure F11).  

Unit II $(395.70{-}993.97\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ is a $582~\mathrm{m}$ thick middle Paleocene to Campanian sequence o f siliciclastic sediments consisting of sand, silt, and clay and sandstone, siltstone, and claystone. Thi s unit is divided into two subunits (IIa and IIb) based on the degree of lithification (clay versus claystone). Subunit IIa is ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists of dark to very dark greenish gray fine-grained san d and silt, clayey silt, and very dark greenish gray or black clay, clay with silt, and minor greenis h gray to black silicified siltstone with glauconite. Bedding ranges from massive to laminated, wit h normal grading in some intervals. Well-preserved inoceramids (bivalves) and other shell fragments are observed macroscopically throughout the subunit. The contact between Subunits II a and IIb is sharp, with Subunit IIb marked by a sharp decline in MS, an increase in dry density, an d a decrease in porosity. Subunit IIb is ${\sim}507\mathrm{~m}$ thick and consists of dark to very dark greenish gra y siltstone, fine- to medium-grained sandstone, and very dark greenish gray or black claystone (Figure F11). The sandy layers become less frequent downhole and are not present below ${\sim}791\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Mass movement is reflected by repeated fining upward sequences of sand to silt or sil t with soft-sediment deformation features such as convolute lamination or load casts. However, finer grain sizes in Unit II (clays and fine silts) suggest a more distal location with respect to th e sediment source in comparison to Unit l.  

# 4.3.3.2. Micropaleontology  

The $994.02~\mathrm{m}$ sedimentary succession recovered at Site U1581 consists of varying proportions o f siliciclastic sediment and biogenic ooze that contains calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, dinocysts, radiolarians, and diatoms in varying abundance and preservation state. In Lithostratigraphi c

Figure F11. Stratigraphic summary, Site U1581. Calcareous nannofossil zones: NP following Martini [1971]; CC following Sissingh [1977]; CN following Backman et al. [2012] for the Miocene–Pleistocene and Agnini et al. [2014] for the Paleocene–Oligocene. Black NGR data $=$ 15-point moving average, cps $=$ counts per second, blac k WRMSL MS data $=25$ -point moving average. Ca and Mg concentrations are on IW, and carbonate and TOC contents are on bulk sediments.  

Subunit Ia $\left(0{-}198.24\mathrm{~m~}\right.$ CSF-A; Pleistocene to Late Miocene), calcareous nannofossils and foraminifers are generally abundant and moderately to well preserved. Reworking of nannofossils i s particularly prevalent in more siliciclastic rich sediments. Diatoms and other siliceous microfossil s (including radiolarians and silicoflagellates) are common to abundant and well preserved in th e uppermost $\sim\!7\;\mathrm{m}$ of the sequence. Below this, moderately preserved diatoms are present in few t o rare numbers to ${\sim}110\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ , whereas radiolarians are common to ${\sim}93\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ and present i n few numbers to ${\sim}175\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Dinocysts are well preserved when present, but their abundanc e varies throughout Subunit Ia from present in the Pleistocene and Pliocene to sparse in th e Miocene.  

In Subunit Ib (198.24–390.05 m CSF-A; Late Miocene–middle Paleocene), calcareous nannofossils are common to abundant and moderately preserved in many samples; however, they are occasionally rare or absent entirely in some intervals, particularly in coarser grained lithologies. Foraminifers are abundant but poorly to moderately preserved at the top of this subunit. Belo w ${\sim}240\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, foraminifers are either absent or present in low numbers and poorly preserved. Siliceous microfossils are absent in this subunit. Poor preservation of dinocysts and miospore s continues into the top of Subunit IIb between $\mathord{\sim}198$ and $243~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Dinocysts and miospore s are rare to common in the Oligocene $({\sim}247{-}283\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ ), absent in the Eocene (\~294–371  m CSF-A), and common to abundant in the Paleocene $({\sim}378{-}396\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ ).  

In Unit II (395.70–994.02 m CSF-A; Paleocene–Campanian), calcareous nannofossil abundanc e and preservation varies significantly. Nannofossils are present in few to common numbers in onl y some Paleocene samples, and many samples are completely barren. Nannofossils are generall y present only in few numbers in the Cretaceous, but they are surprisingly well preserved, particularly between ${\sim}470$ and $770~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Below this depth, abundance decreases and preservatio n deteriorates, with the lowermost sediments devoid of nannofossils. Foraminifers are almos t entirely absent in the ${>}63~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction in Unit II; however, small foraminifers ${<}20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ ar e observed in smear slides throughout the unit. Pyritized diatom fragments are common throughout much of this unit. Although they are often fragmented, some samples contain nearly complet e pyritized diatom valves. Preservation of dinocysts and miospores is moderate to good in Unit II. Both are common to abundant throughout all samples investigated and contain rich and divers e assemblages, which will provide ample opportunity for postcruise study of the terrestrial an d marine paleoenvironmental evolution of the region.  

The siliciclastic component of Site U1581 sediments includes coarse-grained units with shar p bases and normal grading that are interpreted as turbidites. As a result, an uncertain proportion o f the microfossils found in the sediments of Site U1581 were likely transported from nearby shallower settings. Consequently, there is a significant component of reworked microfossils throughout the sedimentary succession at Site U1581, which complicates identification of the biohorizo n tops of species. However, the biohorizons identified demonstrate a clear age progression, suggesting that transported sediments were deposited quasi-contemporaneously.  

# 4.3.3.3. Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic measurements were undertaken on archive section halves from Holes U1581A an d U1581B and on 110 discrete samples from both holes. Paleomagnetic experiments included alternating field demagnetization, AMS, and IRM acquisition. These experiments were performed t o constrain magnetic polarity and the magnetic mineralogy of sedimentary units from Site U1581. Paleomagnetic results are of variable quality, and magnetic polarity could only be determine d from $\mathord{\sim}50\%$ of the cores recovered from Hole U1581A and ${\sim}65\%$ from Hole U1581B. From core s with clear magnetic polarity, nineteen reversals were identified and correlated to chrons withi n the GPTS from the GTS2020 (Gradstein et al., 2020; Ogg, 2020). These include Chrons C1 n through C2Ar (Pleistocene–Pliocene) in Hole U1581A and Chrons C19r through C33n (middl e Eocene–Campanian) in Hole U1581B. Rock magnetic results indicate that the magnetic mineralogy comprises both ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic minerals. There is no observable trend i n magnetic mineralogy with depth or between sedimentary units. AMS measurements indicate tha t the majority of samples from Site U1581 possess a typical oblate sedimentary fabric; however, samples from the basal ${\sim}75~\mathrm{m}$ of Lithostratigraphic Subunit IIb possess a prolate fabric with th e major AMS axis oriented vertically, possibly indicating a tectonic imprint.  

# 4.3.3.4. Chronostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils, planktonic foraminifers, diatoms, dinocysts, and magnetostratigraph y provide age control for the Campanian to Pleistocene sediment sequence recovered at Site U158 1 (Figure F11). For the Campanian–Paleocene interval, nannofossils and dinocysts provide biostratigraphic age constraints that guided correlation of paleomagnetic reversals to the GPTS (Lithostratigraphic Unit II and lower Subunit Ib; 993.97–367.45 m CSF-A). The lowermost strat a recovered at Site U1581 are dated to ${\sim}78.5~\mathrm{Ma}$ based on nannofossil biostratigraphy. Consisten t normal polarity from the base of the hole $(993.97\;\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A})$ ) to $675.68\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A further constrain s the age of the oldest sediment cored to younger than $79.9\ \mathrm{Ma}$ , within Chron C33n. Biostratigraphic datums also constrain two paleomagnetic reversals at ${\sim}676$ and ${\sim}658\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to th e Chron $C32\mathrm{r}.2\mathrm{r}/C33\mathrm{n}$ and $\mathrm{C}32\mathrm{n}.2\mathrm{n}/\mathrm{C}32\mathrm{r}.1\mathrm{r}$ reversals, respectively. The Campanian/Maastrichtia n boundary $(72.17\;\mathrm{Ma})$ is identified at ${\sim}532\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A based on nannofossil biostratigraphy. Upsection, several additional nannofossil and dinocyst biohorizons constrain three paleomagneti c reversals at ${\sim}558$ , 545, and $532\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to the Chron $\mathrm{C}32\mathrm{n}.\mathrm{1r}/\mathrm{C}32\mathrm{n}.2\mathrm{n}$ , $\mathrm{C32n.ln/C32n.lr_{\mathrm{{}}}}$ , an d $C31\mathrm{r}/C32\mathrm{n}.\mathrm{ln}$ reversals, respectively. Dinoflagellate biostratigraphy indicates an early Maastrichtian  age  for  the  strata  between ${\sim}532$ and $467~\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A.  The  stratigraphy  across  th e Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary interval at ${\sim}466\mathrm{\m\,CSF{-}A}$ is complex, with one or more possibl e hiatuses, significant reworking, and a complicated magnetic signal.  

The Paleocene sequence recovered at Site U1581 also has a complex stratigraphy, with varyin g sedimentation rates and at least two hiatuses based on age constraints from dinocysts, nannofossils, and paleomagnetic reversals. The sequence from ${\sim}466$ to $444~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A has predominantl y normal polarity and contains a number of dinocyst biohorizon bases, which are associated wit h the first phase following the mass extinction at the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. Nannofossil s from this interval comprise a dominantly reworked Maastrichtian assemblage, but nannofossi l markers for the base of the Paleocene are identified at ${\sim}444\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. The correlation of th e reversal at ${\sim}446\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A to the Chron $C28\mathrm{r/C29n}$ boundary is also consistent with the earlies t Danian age indicated by dinocyst assemblages. Dinocyst biostratigraphy constrains the age of th e interval at ${\sim}439{-}436\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $64.0{-}63.4\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . The top of the Paleocene interval is dated to olde r than $58.80\,\mathrm{\:Ma}$ at ${\sim}382\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A based on nannofossil biostratigraphy. There is a significan t change in the assemblage at this stratigraphic level, indicating another hiatus and that much of th e upper Paleocene and lower Eocene is missing at Site U1581.  

The base of the Eocene section recovered at Site U1581 is placed at ${\sim}367~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and dated t o ${\sim}50.65$ Ma based on nannofossil biostratigraphy. Nannofossil biostratigraphy indicates a late middle Eocene age at ${\sim}321\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A, and low sedimentation rates $({\sim}0.4~\mathrm{cm/ky})$ were calculated fo r the lowermost Eocene section. Nannofossil biostratigraphy further supports the presence of a hiatus or highly condensed interval at $\sim\!315\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A spanning the middle to upper Eocene. A lowe r Oligocene to Lower Miocene sedimentary succession between $\mathord{\sim}302$ and $215\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A is constrained by 14 calcareous nannofossil and dinocyst biostratigraphic datums. Because of a poo r paleomagnetic signal, no magnetic reversals were identified in this interval. Nannofossil biostratigraphy dates the interval at ${\sim}215\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $20.98\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (Early Miocene). Above this depth, ther e are two hiatuses or highly condensed intervals in the Miocene succession spanning ${\sim}21$ to $7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ .  

The age-depth model for the uppermost Miocene to Pleistocene sedimentary succession at Sit e U1581 is constrained by 20 diatom, dinocyst, and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphic datum s and 8 magnetic reversals. Nannofossil biostratigraphy dates the base of this interval to ${\sim}7\ \mathrm{Ma}$ a t $\mathord{\sim}186\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and the top of this interval to $0.29\ \mathrm{Ma}$ at $\sim\!1\textrm{m}$ CSF-A. Sedimentation rates ar e interpreted to be relatively constant through the Pliocene–Pleistocene interval, although the frequent occurrence of turbidites likely means that sedimentation rates vary at a finer scale.  

# 4.3.3.5. Geochemistry  

The geochemistry program at Site U1581 was designed to characterize the composition of bul k sediment and IW and report on the presence and abundance of volatile hydrocarbons for routin e safety monitoring. Methane values range 0.7–1458 ppmv. Hydrocarbons with longer chain length s up to n-hexane $\left(C_{6}\right)$ were detected from 490.52 to 990.12 m CSF-A (bottom of Hole U1581B). Th e consistent presence of higher hydrocarbons up to hexane in the lower part of Hole U1581B is consistent with a thermogenic origin of the hydrocarbons. Notably, ethane/methane $(C_{2}/C_{1})$ ratios ar e markedly elevated between 490.52 and $655.22\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, with a maximum at $610\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A.  

IW samples were analyzed in Holes U1581A and U1581B to $978.88\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, and IW was extractable in all but the lowermost sample from Core 392-U1581B-74R $(990.02\textrm{m}$ CSF-A). Alkalinit y values increase from roughly $3.4~\mathrm{mM}$ in the shallowest sample at $2.96~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $10.02\ \mathrm{mM}$ a t $74.81\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Alkalinity values then decrease to $1.43\mathrm{~mM}$ at $277.5\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A and remain relatively constant between 0.831 and $2.335~\mathrm{mM}$ below this depth. $\mathsf{p H}$ values range ${\sim}7.5{-}8.0$ to ${\sim}625$ m CSF-A, and ammonium values follow a trend quite similar to alkalinity in all Hole U1581A samples, with a maximum value of approximately $1161~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at ${\sim}100\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A before decreasing t o ${\sim}280~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at ${\sim}256\ \mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Ammonium then steadily increases to the bottom of the hole to $^{\sim1}$ mM.  

Of the major anions, sulfate decreases from ${\sim}28\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $2.96\:\mathrm{m}\:\mathrm{CSF-A}$ to ${\sim}14\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $\mathord{\sim}138\;\mathrm{m}$ CSFA. Sulfate then increases slightly to $18.06\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $358.31\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A before decreasing again to 3.7 5 mM at 722.91 m CSF-A. Chloride decreases downhole from $574\;\mathrm{mM}$ in the uppermost section t o as low as $455.48~\mathrm{mM}$ in the deepest part of the section. Sodium shows a marked increase in variability below ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, with concentrations ranging ${\sim}440{-}530\ \mathrm{mM}.$ Magnesium concentrations decrease downhole from 50.95 to $6.68\ \mathrm{mM}$ at the bottom of the hole. Calcium decrease s from $10.32\;\mathrm{mM}$ at $2.96\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $6.94~\mathrm{mM}$ at $93.81\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ before increasing to a maximu m concentration of $20.95\,\mathrm{mM}$ at $377.71\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Below ${\sim}400\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, Ca concentrations decreas e to $\sim\!6\:\mathrm{mM}$ at the base of the section. Potassium concentrations decrease from a maximum of 11.3 9 $\mathbf{m}\mathbf{M}$ at $19.37\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to $1.2\,\mathrm{mM}$ at $600.70\:\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Below this depth, potassium concentration s remain stable between $^{\sim1}$ and $2\,\mathrm{mM}$ .  

In total, 204 sediment samples were analyzed for bulk carbon and nitrogen analyses at Site U1581. TC and carbonate weight percentages range 0–10.01 and $0{-}83.36\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ , respectively, which is consistent with the deposition of pelagic biogenic oozes and lithologic observations. Greater variability and overall the highest carbonate content is observed in biogenic oozes between the seafloo r and $198\,\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A. Below $200\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, inorganic carbon and carbonate content typicall y decrease to below $10\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ and average 0.97 and $8.11~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively. The main carbonate mineral phase is likely calcite in the biogenic ooze above $200\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A; however, in the more siliciclastic sediments below $200\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , the carbonate content may include other carbonate minerals, including siderite and dolomite. Despite uncertainty in the carbonate mineral phases present, carbonate carbon persists in selected samples to the bottom of the analyzed sedimentary sectio n $({\sim}993\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ). The average TOC content is $0.46\pm0.31\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ with minimum and maximum concentrations of 0 and $1.69\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ , respectively. Average TOC is slightly elevated to $0.52\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ from 20 0 m CSF-A to the base of the recovered section at Site U1581.  

# 4.3.3.6. Physical properties  

Standard measurements of physical properties were made on cores from Holes U1581A an d U1581B using the WRMSL, Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL), and NGRL trac k instruments. Discrete measurements were also made for MAD analysis, thermal conductivity, an d $P$ -wave velocities on the PWC system.  

Core disturbance was common in Hole U1581A cores collected with the APC, HLAPC, and XC B systems, affecting the continuous track measurements of physical properties for cores. Discret e sampling for thermal conductivity and MAD analyses avoided core disturbance wherever readil y identifiable. Many of the clay-rich lithologies at Site U1581 expanded in volume upon recovery, likely altering some physical properties. In Hole U1581B, the trends in physical properties show  a continuation of observations recorded in Hole U1581A. Average NGR levels and deconvolved uranium, thorium, and potassium concentrations are higher at Site U1581 compared to the two previous sites on the Agulhas Plateau, reflecting lower carbonate content and higher clay content i n the Transkei Basin. $P_{-}$ -wave velocity, thermal conductivity, and bulk density values all increas e downhole through the biogenic oozes of Lithostratigraphic Subunit Ia in the upper $198.24\mathrm{~m~}$ . A t the Subunit $\mathrm{Ia/Ib}$ boundary $({\sim}198.24\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ , a sharp ${\sim}0.2{-}0.3~\mathrm{g/cm^{3}}$ increase in bulk densit y occurs where a hiatus is indicated by biostratigraphic analysis. Finer scale changes in physica l properties at Site U1581, such as in NGR and MS, are associated with decimeter-scale nannofossi l ooze/chalk beds, which are likely turbiditic in origin. A major increase in MS to ${\sim}400$ instrumen t units (IU) occurs in the clayey silts and silty clays of Subunit IIa (395.70–486.07 m CSF-A) an d corresponds with the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary interval. The grain density of claystones i n Subunit IIb $(486.07{-}994.02\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ ) is high $(\sim\!2.75\!-\!2.85\;\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ and likely relates to the presenc e of authigenic minerals such as pyrite and siderite. $P$ -wave velocity at Site U1581 increases downhole relatively linearly from ${\sim}1650~\mathrm{m/s}$ at the seafloor to ${\sim}2200\ \mathrm{m/s}$ at the base of Unit II (994.0 2 m CSF-A).  

# 4.3.3.7. Downhole measurements  

Downhole logging measurements at Site U1581 included formation temperature measurements i n Hole U1581A. Because of electrical connection problems during wireline logging in Hole U1581B, only natural gamma ray wireline logging data were collected between ${\sim}80$ and $220\,\mathrm{m}$ WMSF usin g the Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge device run at the top of the triple combo tool string (se e Operations).  

The logging data provide downhole natural gamma ray data across the poorly recovered interval a t the base of Pliocene–Pleistocene drift deposits. These data allow for detailed correlation betwee n Cores 392-U1581A-10H through 26H and downhole logging data. A cyclic pattern in the downhole natural gamma ray profile is characteristic for alternating sand and clay-rich turbiditi c deposits.  

Borehole formation temperatures were measured using the APCT-3 tool during recovery of Core s 392-U1581A-4H [35.4 m CSF-A]; 7H $\mathrm{54.4~m}$ CSF-A]; 10H [92.4 m CSF-A]; and 13H $120.9\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A]). Temperature measurements were of good quality, displaying characteristic thermal cooling curves. Equilibrium borehole temperatures were calculated using the TP-Fit software (Heesemann et al., 2006): $2.83{\pm}0.002^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{z}}$ , $4.13{\pm}0.002^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , $5.43{\pm}0.011^{\circ}C$ , and $6.10{\pm}0.033^{\circ}\mathrm{C},$ , respectively.  A geothermal gradient of ${\sim}37.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ and a heat flow of ${\sim}47.3\,\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}}$ were calculated usin g Bullard’s method. These preliminary results are generally consistent with nearby prior measurements for the Transkei Basin published in the global heat flow database by Fuchs et al. (2021) bu t require further postcruise analysis and uncertainty estimation.  

# 4.4. Site U1582  

# 4.4.1. Background and objectives  

The northern Agulhas Plateau is characterized by a rough topography and a number of basemen t highs separated by depressions with only a thin sedimentary cover. In between the interprete d basement highs, thicker sediment packages filling depressions or sediment drifts are observed. This distribution of sedimentary sequences attests to the strong erosional/nondepositional influence of the Agulhas Retroflection, as well as Circumpolar Deepwater flowing over the norther n Agulhas Plateau. Furthermore, the northern slope of the Agulhas Plateau lies under the influenc e of North Atlantic Deepwater and Antarctic Bottom Water, both of which shape sediment drifts. Site U1582 (proposed Site AP-07A) is located on the flank of one of those basement high s $(37^{\circ}1.5002^{\prime}\mathrm{S}/24^{\circ}59.7168^{\prime}\mathrm{E})$ at $3441\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth, where a small ledge is formed (Figure F12). The seismic data show basement below an ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{m}$ thick sedimentary sequence, which is characterized by Reflectors M and LE (see Background). The uppermost part of basement further show s only few internal reflections (Figure F12), which differs from the seismic character of the basement at Sites U1579 and U1580. This has been interpreted to represent more homogeneous basal t at Site U1582.  

Site U1582 was selected to recover both the thin Paleogene–Cretaceous sedimentary cover an d basement samples. This site was especially dedicated to recover an extended record of basemen t material to unravel the nature of the basement and provide information on its age and geochemistry. Additional objectives include identifying potential late-stage magmatism and its effect on sedimentary sequences. Integration of seismic profiles with the drilling results will allow direct datin g of the observed seismic unconformities M and LE and interpreting their causes, and recovery o f the sediment/basement interface will provide information on the age of the oldest sediment s above the basement as well as the water depth and environment at the time of deposition. At thi s site, a thin sediment sequence from the mid-Cretaceous to mid-Paleogene was expected to b e drilled, spanning the long-term climate transition from the Cretaceous greenhouse to potentiall y the early Paleogene. The recovery of basement rocks at this site on the northern Agulhas Platea u was expected to help address fundamental questions about the formation of this LIP.  

# 4.4.2. Operations  

The vessel arrived at Site U1582 at $1420\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 March 2022. The thrusters were lowered startin g at $1424\,\mathrm{{h}_{\cdot}}$ , the vessel was switched from cruise to DP mode at $1440\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the rig floor given the al l clear. A new C-7 bit with a mechanical bit release was made up, and a four-stand RCB BHA wa s run into the hole starting at $1645~\mathrm{h}$ . The drill pipe was lowered to $3378.3\;\mathrm{m}$ DRF, the sinker bar s were installed, and the RCB core barrel was deployed. Site U1582 hole locations, water depths, an d the number of cores recovered are listed in Table T1.  

The first attempt for core at $2340~\mathrm{h}$ was a water core. Starting on 28 March, four more attempt s were made to get the first core. On the sixth attempt, Hole U1582A was spudded at $0405\,\mathrm{h},$ , wit h Core 1R recovering $1.9\textrm{m}$ . The seafloor was established at $3429.4~\mathrm{mbsl}$ . Coring continued, an d basement was reached at $42.7~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Half cores were taken on Cores 6R and 7R. Core 7R wa s cored to $48.0~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, but more than $100\%$ was recovered ( $48.68\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A). Coring was terminated at $1915\,\mathrm{h}$ to trip out of the hole because severe weather was expected over the site within 2 4 h.  

The pipe was tripped out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $1945~\mathrm{h}$ . On 29 March at $0215\,\mathrm{h}$ , th e pipe trip was completed with the BHA at the rig floor. The bit cleared the rig floor at $0455\mathrm{~h}_{:}$ , ending Hole U1582A. The rig floor was secured at $0600\;\mathrm{h},$ and the vessel was switched to cruis e mode at $0604\,\mathrm{h}$ . The thrusters were raised and secured by $0618\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the sea passage for waitin g on weather began with the vessel transiting north at $10.6\,\mathrm{kt}$ . The vessel turned and took a westerl y heading at $1818\,\mathrm{h}$ . Beginning on 31 March, the vessel turned south and then east to return to Sit e U1582. A total of seven cores were taken in Hole U1582A over a $48\;\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=38.5\%)$ . Total time on Hole U1582A was $38.16\,\mathrm{h}$ (1.59 days).

The marked purple reflection corresponds in structure to the top of basement (Figure F4), the magenta reflection to Reflector M, the blue reflection to Reflector LE, and the green reflection to Reflector LO. TWT $=$ two-way traveltime.  

On 1 April, the vessel arrived back at Site U1582. The thrusters were lowered starting at $1228\ \mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and the ship was switched to DP mode at $1245\ \mathrm{h}$ , ending the waiting on weather window. Th e vessel was positioned $10\;\mathrm{m}$ west of Hole U1582A. A new $_{\mathrm{{C-7}~R C B}}$ bit was made up, and the BH A and pipe were tripped to the seafloor. A core barrel with a center bit was dropped, and Hol e U1582B was spudded at $2315\ \mathrm{h}$ on 1 April. Seafloor was set at $3440.7\mathrm{~m~}$ DRF (by offset). Hol e U1582B was drilled down to a hard contact at $36.3~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The center bit was retrieved, an d coring began at approximately $0530~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April. Core 2R was on deck at $1100~\mathrm{h}$ . The ROP wa s very slow, averaging just over $1~\mathrm{m/h}$ because the hard basalt formation and shallow depth of th e hole limited how much weight could be put on the bit. Coring continued to 3 April, and Core 5 R was recovered at a final depth of $55.6\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ (recovery to $53.73\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A).  

The weather over the site was expected to deteriorate over the next 2 days, thus forcing us off sit e and into an early transit to Cape Town, South Africa. Coring was terminated at $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 3 April, and the pipe was tripped back to the vessel. The bit cleared the rig floor at $1250~\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hol e U1582B and Site U1582. The vessel was switched to cruise mode at $1236~\mathrm{h}$ , the thrusters wer e raised and secured by $1249\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and we began our sea passage to Cape Town, South Africa, at 125 0 h with the vessel making a wide turn to the northwest. A total of four cores were taken in Hol e U1582B over a $19.3\;\mathrm{m}$ interval (recovery $=52.2\%$ ). Total time on Hole U1582B was $48\,\mathrm{h}$ (2.0 days). Expedition 392 officially ended with the first line ashore at $1154\,\mathrm{h}$ on 7 April.  

# 4.4.3. Principal results  

# 4.4.3.1. Lithostratigraphy  

Site U1582 consists of a $40.92\;\mathrm{m}$ sequence of sediments overlying a $16.9~\mathrm{m}$ interval of basalt wit h intercalated thin layers of sediment. The sequence recovered at Site U1582 is divided into lithostratigraphic Units I and II (Figure F13). Unit I is entirely comprised of sediments and furthe r divided into Subunits Ia and Ib, and Unit II consists of pillow basalts with interspersed sediments.  

Unit I (Hole $\mathrm{J1582A}\,=\,0{-}40.42~\mathrm{m}$ CFS-A; Hole $\mathrm{U1582B}\,=\,36.30\mathrm{-}36.83\mathrm{~m~CSF-A})$ is a ${\sim}40\,\mathrm{~m~}$ sequence of nannofossil ooze, clayey silt, and clayey nannofossil ooze with sand in the upper sections and limestone at the base (Figure F13). The unit is divided into Subunits Ia and Ib based o n a downhole increase in lithification. Both subunits contain variable amounts of sand, silt, clay, an d manganese nodules. Subunit Ia consists of light brown clayey silt, nannofossil ooze, clayey nannofossil ooze with sand, and manganese nodules. At $2.0{-}2.11\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ , there is a dark brown, ${\sim}11$ cm manganese nodule, and there are additional small nodules of manganese throughout the entir e subunit. From $7.32~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A to the base of the subunit, medium to coarse sand-sized and occasionally pebble-sized manganese nodules are present. The contact between Subunits Ia and Ib wa s not recovered and occurs in an interval of poor recovery between Cores 392-U1582A-4R and 5 R $({\sim}21.71{-}31.07\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A})$ ).  

Subunit Ib consists of limestone, with one cobble-sized manganese nodule at $45.5~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. Th e limestone ranges from light gray to pale yellow and contains clasts of altered basalt and carbonat e intraclasts, including pebble-sized angular calcite crystals. Manganese dendrites are also presen t in the light gray limestone. Carbonate content decreases from ${\sim}30\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $0.83\mathrm{~m~CSF-A}$ to $<\!5\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ at $2.48\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A and remains below $10\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ to $21.57\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. The contact between Units I and I I was not recovered.  

Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1582A}\,=\,40.42–48.68\mathrm{~m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}$ ; Hole $\mathrm{U1582B}=36.83\mathrm{-53.73~m~CSF-A};$ ) is ${\sim}17~\mathrm{m}$ thick and consists largely of pillow basalts with occasional layers/pockets of sediments betwee n pillow basalts. The sediment includes limestones and volcaniclastic material; the limestones rang e from pale yellow to light brown to light grayish green. In the pale yellow and light brown limestones, limonite is present at contacts with the basalt. Dendritic manganese and calcite veining ar e also present in the limestone intervals.  

# 4.4.3.2. Igneous petrology  

Igneous rocks were first reached at 40.92 m CSF-A in Hole U1582A and $36.83~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hol e U1582B, below sedimentary Lithostratigraphic Subunit Ib (Figure F13). In Hole U1582A, Unit II i s comprised of a $7.76~\mathrm{m}$ sequence of pillow lava basalts with thin, intercalated limestone pockets. Thirteen igneous units were identified and defined as individual inflationary pillow lava lobes i n  

Hole U1582A. The sedimentary material in Lithostratigraphic Unit II consists of thin $\left(<\!10\ \mathsf{c m}\right)$ limestones and is considered to be pockets of carbonate sediment that occupy interstices betwee n individual pillow lobes.  

The upper part of Lithostratigraphic Unit II in Hole U1582A (Igneous Units 1–3) is composed o f predominantly plagioclase phyric pillow basalts, which all show a yellowish brown alteration pattern. There is abundant fresh glass along the chilled contact of the pillows, as well as an outer laye r of palagonized (weathered) glass and possibly some sedimentary material. The basalt in the interior of the lobes is fine-grained, moderately to highly altered, and sparsely plagioclase phyric. Many intervals are also moderately vesicular with typical, radially arranged vesicle trains inward o f the chilled margin, with all of the vesicles filled with calcite. The common yellowish brown color o f the basalts in the upper part of Lithostratigraphic Unit II indicates considerable weathering an d oxidation. The lower part of Lithostratigraphic Unit II in Hole U1582A (Igneous Units 4–13) i s also composed of predominantly plagioclase phyric pillow basalts. However, most of these basal t units possess a natural gray color and show no signs of oxyhydroxide staining, indicating a lesse r degree of oxidative weathering than the uppermost basalts of the unit.  

Hole U1582B was spudded about $20\;\mathrm{m}$ away from Hole U1582A and delivered the same principl e lithologies, although igneous rocks were first encountered ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{m}$ shallower (36.83 m CSF-A) belo w sedimentary Lithostratigraphic Subunit Ib. A $16.86\mathrm{~m~}$ sequence of pillow lava basalts was penetrated before drilling ceased at $53.69\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1582B. The ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{m}$ shallower occurrence o f the igneous basement in comparison to Hole U1582A may attest to the considerable lateral variability of pillow lava flow fields, which likely created an irregular sediment/basalt contact at thi s site. In total, 27 igneous units were identified in Hole U1582B, including 26 pillow lava units an d one sequence of a hyaloclastite breccia. As in Hole U1582A, the pillow lava units were defined an d interpreted as individual inflationary lava lobes.

Figure F13. Stratigraphic summary, Site U1582. Black NGR data $=15$ -point moving average, $\mathsf{c p s=}$ counts per second, blac k WRMSL MS data $=25$ -point moving average. Carbonate content (open circles) measurements are on bulk sediments.  

The entire igneous succession cored in Holes U1582A and U1582B is interpreted as a stack o f pillow lava lobes based on observed structures such as curved chilled margins, the presence o f thick (fresh and altered) glass rinds along these margins, radially arranged vesicle trains, and concentric vesicle bands parallel to the curved margins. The basalts recovered in both holes are characterized by the presence of pockets or intervals of interpillow carbonate sediment ofte n recovered in direct contact with the pillow rims. The presence of calcareous nannofossils in a t least some of these carbonate pockets rules out a purely diagenetic origin of the carbonate. Instead, the evidence of mingling of plastic lava with unconsolidated sediments is tentatively interpreted as peperite, implying an interaction of lava and coexisting sediment during eruption.  

# 4.4.3.3. Micropaleontology  

The $53.73\;\mathrm{m}$ succession recovered at Site U1582 contains calcareous nannofossils and foraminifer s in varying abundance. The sediments are barren of siliceous microfossils, and samples from th e site were not processed for palynomorphs because of the nature of the sediment and time constraints near the end of the expedition. The sedimentary succession recovered at the site abov e basalt (Hole $\mathrm{U}1582\mathrm{A}=0{-}40.92\mathrm{~m}$ CSF-A; Hole $\mathrm{U1482B}=36.30–36.83\mathrm{~m~C3}$ SF-A) primarily consists of nannofossil ooze with abundant manganese nodules, together with clayey silt and san d (Lithostratigraphic Subunit Ia; $0{-}21.76\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A})$ overlying limestone (Subunit Ib; Hole U1582 A $=31.00{-}40.92\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A; Hole $\mathrm{U1528B}=36.30{-}36.83\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF{-}A}$ ) and indicates a highly condense d section dated to the Miocene to Campanian(?). Basalt was encountered at $40.92\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hol e U1582A and $36.83~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A in Hole U1582B (Unit II). The basalt shows clear pillow structure s with thin intervals of intercalated sediment that contain sparse nannofossils that indicate  a Santonian to Turonian age.  

Calcareous nannofossils are abundant and moderately to poorly preserved in the nannofossil ooz e of Subunit Ia $(0{-}21.76\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A})$ . The clayey silt and clayey sand beds in this subunit are barren o r nearly barren of nannofossils. Nannofossil preservation generally decreases from the top of th e hole through Subunit Ia. Nannofossils are very rare and poorly preserved in the limestone o f Subunit Ib. In contrast, nannofossils are present in rare to few numbers and moderately preserve d in the greenish gray limestone intercalated with basalt, whereas they are rarer and show poore r preservation in the yellowish brown limestones associated with the basalt. Foraminifers are present in the upper four cores of Hole U1582A (Subunit Ia; $0{-}21.73\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A), and preservatio n deteriorates downhole from good to poor.  

# 4.4.3.4. Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic measurements were undertaken on all archive section halves from Holes U1582 A and U1582B and on four discrete samples from Hole U1582A. Demagnetization experiments wer e performed on both sedimentary and igneous units recovered from Site U1582. Results indicat e that the sampled units at Site U1582 are reliable recorders of magnetic field directions. Magneti c polarity was constrained from all measured cores. Intervals of both positive and negative inclination were identified in Hole U1582A, indicative of reversed and normal geomagnetic polarity, respectively. All measured cores from Hole U1582B had negative inclination (normal polarity). Because of the condensed sediment interval collected in each hole, correlation to the GPTS (Gradstein et al., 2020; Ogg, 2020) was difficult; however, we suggest a correlation with Chron C34n o f the predominantly normal polarity zone observed from ${\sim}21\,\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A downhole (see Chronostratigraphy).  

# 4.4.3.5. Chronostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossils, foraminifers, and magnetostratigraphy provide age control for the Campanian(?) to Upper Miocene sediments recovered at Site U1582 in Lithostratigraphic Unit I. Th e sedimentary cover is very thin $\left(\sim\!40\,\mathrm{m}\right)$ at Site U1582 yet represents a long period of time (as muc h as $70~\mathrm{My},$ ), indicating very low sedimentation rates and/or significant erosion. The presence o f abundant manganese nodules is consistent with this observation. The low sedimentation rates an d other processes such as reworking of older sediment and burrowing, together with coring disturbance, make this a particularly challenging site for chronostratigraphy. Because of significant mixing, the youngest age diagnostic taxa within a given sample or set of samples was used fo r biostratigraphic age assessment, with outlier bioevents excluded that appear to result from drillin g disturbance or contamination.  

The nannofossil ooze, clayey silt, sand, and manganese nodules of Subunit Ia (Hole $\mathrm{U}1581\mathrm{A}=0-$ $21.76~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A) show predominantly reversed magnetic polarity with some intervals of norma l polarity usually associated with manganese nodules. Nannofossil assemblages in this subunit ofte n include a significant component of reworking and presence of multiple biostratigraphic marke r taxa indicating broad age ranges. Foraminifers in the mudline sample $\langle0\mathrm{\m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A}\rangle$ ) indicate a ver y young (Pleistocene–recent) age for the seafloor, and nannofossils indicate a Late Miocene ag e between $\mathord{\sim}10.9$ and $5.5\,\mathrm{Ma}$ for the $0.43–1.35\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A interval. The $1.85{-}1.98\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A interval i s assigned an Eocene to mid-Oligocene age $({\sim}35{-}27\ \mathrm{Ma})$ , and the $4.71\mathrm{-}6.76\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A interval i s assigned an early to early middle Eocene age $({\sim}54{-}47\ \mathrm{Ma})$ based on nannofossil biostratigraphy. Samples between 7.63 and $11.90\mathrm{~m~}$ CSF-A contain assemblages of mixed ages with a significan t component of older material reworked into younger sediment, together with likely contaminatio n from younger material due to fall-in. However, although the nannofossil assemblage contain s Cretaceous taxa similar to those in the deeper samples, the presence of Paleogene nannofossil s indicate an early Eocene or younger age for this interval.  

The 11.90–21.71 m CSF-A interval of Subunit 1a contains a solely Cretaceous nannofossil assemblage with background taxa similar to those in the sediment intercalated with the basalt of Unit II, indicating a Campanian to earliest Maastrichtian age despite the dominance of older (Coniacian ) species. The dominantly reversed polarity of this interval also precludes a Coniacian age. However, the possibility that the nannofossil assemblage is entirely reworked through this interval cannot be discounted. The lowermost sediments recovered above basalt at Site U1582 are limestone s in Subunit Ib (Hole $\mathrm{U1582A}\,=\,40.92–31.00~\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A; Hole $\mathrm{U1582B}\,=\,36.83\substack{-36.30\ m\,\,C S F\mathrm{-A}}$ ), which contain only very rare and poorly preserved Cretaceous nannofossils that provide no additional age control. The limestone shows normal magnetic polarity with no reversals between it an d the basalt below. This may suggest that the limestone was deposited during the long Cretaceou s Normal Superchron (C34n), indicating an age of Santonian or older; however, this age assessmen t is very tentative.  

Nannofossils and magnetostratigraphy provide age constraints for the basalt and sediments o f Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1582A}=48.68{-}40.92\mathrm{~m~C~}$ SF-A; Hole $\mathrm{U1582B}=53.73–36.83\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{CSF-A}\rangle$ . The limestones intercalated with basalt contain a sparse, moderately preserved Late Cretaceous nannofossil assemblage. Nannofossil marker taxa suggest an early Turonian to Santonian age $({\sim}93.7{-}84\$ Ma). The broad age interpretation of Turonian–Santonian is consistent with the persistent norma l magnetic polarity of the basalt, which can therefore be assigned to Superchron $C34\mathrm{n}$ . Given th e sparse nature of the assemblages, postcruise research may provide additional nannofossil age constraints for the sediments recovered within the basalts.  

# 4.4.3.6. Geochemistry  

The geochemistry program at Site U1582 was designed to characterize the composition of bul k sediment and IW and report on the presence and abundance of volatile hydrocarbons for routin e safety monitoring.  

A total of six headspace samples were taken and analyzed for routine safety monitoring. Hydrocarbons in headspace samples were detected in Hole U1582A. Methane was above the detection limi t in three samples, with concentrations of 0.68 and 0.51 ppmv in samples from Cores 2R and 3R, respectively. Hydrocarbons with longer chain lengths up to $\mathbf{n}$ -hexane $\left(C_{6}\right)$ were not detected in an y of the headspace samples.  

Samples for IW were collected from the upper $15\textrm{m}$ of Hole U1582A, where soft sediment wa s present. Alkalinity values range $2.414{-}2.892\mathrm{~mM.~p~}$ H values range 7.601–7.697. No further shipboard analyses were completed on IW samples from Site U1582 because of the small number o f samples collected.  

In total, five sediment samples were obtained for bulk carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur analyses at Sit e U1582. TC and carbonate weight percentages (where carbonate is reported as calcium carbonat e weight percentage) range 0.2–3.41 and $1.93{-}28.10~\mathrm{wt}\%$ at Site U1582, respectively. Carbonate i s elevated $(28.10\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ as $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3},$ ) in the uppermost sample $\mathrm{(0.82\m\,CSF{-}A)}$ ) from Lithostratigraphi c Subunit Ia, which is a clayey nannofossil ooze that encompasses the upper $21.71\;\mathrm{m}$ at this site, a s compared to Subunit Ib below $31\,\textrm{m}$ CSF-A, which averages $5.16~\mathrm{wt\%}$ $C a C O_{3}$ (Figure F13). I n Subunit Ib, inorganic carbon averages $0.62\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . TOC is zero for all samples except Sample 1R-1, $82{-}83~\mathrm{cm}$ , which has a concentration of $0.05~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Total nitrogen was measured but remaine d below $0.05~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=0.04\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ ), which is at or close to the detection limit, for the sample s analyzed from Hole U1582A.  

Total sulfur concentrations range from below detection limit to $0.41\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ .  

# 4.4.3.7. Physical properties  

Standard measurements of physical properties were made on cores from Holes U1582A an d U1582B using the WRMSL, SHMSL, and NGRL. Discrete measurements were also made fo r MAD analysis, thermal conductivity, and $P$ -wave velocities on the PWC system. Physical propert y data from Site U1582 show a progression with depth that delineates the poorly consolidated claye y nannofossil ooze of Lithostratigraphic Subunit Ia $(0{-}31.00\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{CSF-A})$ ) from the underlying lithifie d limestone of Subunit Ib (Hole $\mathrm{U1582A}\,=\,31.00–40.92\,\mathrm{~m}$ CSF-A) and from the deeper pillo w basalts with interspersed pockets of limestone in Unit II (Hole $\mathrm{U1582B}=36.83\mathrm{-53.73~m~CSF-A}$ ) (Figure F13). Subunit Ia contains unlithified sediment with high porosity $(65\mathrm{-}82\,\mathrm{vol\%})$ ), low MA D bulk density $(1.40\mathrm{-}1.62\;\mathrm{g/cm^{3}})$ , low PWC $P$ -wave velocities $({\sim}1600\,\mathrm{m/s})$ , and low thermal conductivity $(0.9{-}1.2\ \mathrm{W/[m.K]})$ . In comparison, the underlying more lithified limestones of Subunit I b have much lower porosity $(\sim\!25\%)$ , higher average PWC $P$ -wave velocity $({\sim}3000~\mathrm{m/s})$ , and highe r bulk density $({\sim}2.33\ \mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ . The dark colored pillow basalts $\langle\mathrm{L}^{*}=\mathrm{\sim}20{-}40\rangle$ ) of Unit II have highe r NGR values $[{\sim}20$ counts/s) and higher MS $({\sim}500{-}1000\;\mathrm{IU)}$ than the light-colored basalt (Figur e F13).  

# 5. Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 392 recovered sedimentary sequences and igneous rocks at three sites on the Agulha s Plateau (Sites U1579, U1580, and U1582) and a sedimentary sequence from one site in th e Transkei Basin (Site U1581) (Figures F3, F14, F15). The main sedimentary sections recovered a t the Agulhas Plateau sites span the lowermost Miocene through uppermost Cenomanian and comprise a wide range of lithologies from nannofossil oozes/chalks to zeolitic sandstones (Figure F16). Several key stratigraphic intervals that were well recovered at the Agulhas Plateau sites include th e Oligocene–Miocene transition and a nearly complete spliced Oligocene sequence at Site U1579, the EOT at Site U1579, the Paleocene/Eocene boundary at Site U1580 (double cored), the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary at Sites U1579 and U1580, and the upper Campanian at Sites U157 9 and U1580. The thick sedimentary sequence cored in the Transkei Basin at Site U1581 also contains several important stratigraphic intervals, including an expanded Campanian clayston e sequence and, potentially, the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary (requiring further stratigraphi c analysis postcruise) (Figures F14, F15).  

Igneous rocks cored at Sites U1579 and U1580 are classified as plagioclase-clinopyroxene phyri c basalts, aphyric or slightly plagioclase basalts, and olivine phyric basalts. At both sites, the basal t units are interbedded with sedimentary units. The intercalation of igneous bodies and sedimen t packages implies that these units represent either lateral intrusions (sills) or that they wer e emplaced as lava flows on which sediments were deposited after each eruption. Based on severa l lines of evidence, igneous successions at these sites are interpreted as sills. Preliminary geochemical analysis of the recovered basalts from both sites indicates that the sills have a tholeiitic composition, which is characteristic of the main plateau building phase of oceanic LIPs.  

A sequence of plagioclase phyric pillow basalts was recovered at Site U1582, providing information on the eruptive nature of the Agulhas Plateau magmatism. The broadly constrained earl y Turonian–Santonian biostratigraphic age $({\sim}84{-}94\mathrm{\Ma})$ ) of the interpillow carbonate sediment s may place these lavas several million years younger than the postulated formation age of the Agulhas Plateau based on seismic studies and plate tectonic reconstructions $(95{-}105\ \mathrm{Ma})$ (e.g., Goh l and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001; Gohl et al., 2011). Direct radiometric dating of plagioclase phenocrysts of the Site U1582 basalts should be possible and will determine whether the reconstructions need to be revised or, alternatively, whether this pillow lava field belongs to a lat e “rejuvenated” or “posterosional stage” of volcanism. However, preliminary shipboard portable Xray fluorescence spectrometry (pXRF) analyses indicate a tholeiitic composition for the Sit e U1582 pillow lavas, which may indicate that these basalts represent the main phase of Agulha s Plateau volcanism.  

Unfavorable weather conditions during the last week of the expedition prevented the recovery o f deep basement samples at Site U1582; instead of the intended $300\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A, we could only drill t o ${\sim}50\;\mathrm{m}$ CSF-A. However, as has been outlined above, the recovered basement cores will allow dating pillow lava flows and thus bear huge potential to add to the reconstruction of the emplacemen t of the Agulhas Plateau. Geochemical and age comparison with material retrieved at Maud Ris e during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 113 and the Northeast Georgia Rise during ODP Le g 114 will further contribute to a better understanding of the development of this LIP obstructin g the African–Southern Ocean gateway during the Late Cretaceous.

Drilling at Site U1581 revealed that an interpreted black shale reflector deep in the sedimentar y sequence did not form the top of an organic-rich layer. However, the combination of recovere d thin layers of siltstones, anisotropy observed for MS in the deepest cores recovered at Site U1581, peaks in $P$ -wave velocity and density, and the computation of synthetic seismograms and thu s core-log-seismic integration with dates from the sills recovered at Sites U1579 and U1580 wil l allow a study of the farfield effect that the emplacement of the Agulhas Plateau sills may hav e created.  

In addition to these highlighted examples, the cores, downhole logging data, and IW samples collected at Expedition 392 sites will allow most of the main expedition objectives to be addressed. These objectives broadly fall into three areas: (1) age and origin of the Agulhas Plateau, (2 ) paleoceanographic and climate history, and (3) rock-water interactions and chemical evolution o f the Agulhas Plateau. The objectives of Expedition 392 also directly address the critical question s posed by the 2050 Science Framework Strategic Objectives:  

• EARTH’S CLIMATE SYSTEM: unraveling ice sheet history, sea level changes, and oceanatmosphere interactions;   
• FEEDBACKS IN THE EARTH SYSTEM: constraining the processes that regulate or destabilize the Earth system;   
• THE OCEANIC LIFE CYCLE OF TECTONIC PLATES: investigating the genesis, aging, motion, and destruction of oceanic plates; and   
• GLOBAL CYCLES OF ENERGY AND MATTER: determining the role, mechanisms, and magnitude of Earth system cycles.

Key aspects and research questions that will be pursued in postcruise studies are briefly outline d below.  

# 5.1. Age and origin of the Agulhas Plateau  

• The successful recovery of igneous rocks at Sites U1579, U1580, and U1582 containing fresh plagioclase and other minerals typical of main-stage lavas suitable for $^{40}\mathrm{{Ar}/^{39}\mathrm{{Ar}}}$ dating studies should yield reliable ages for the igneous rocks recovered on Expedition 392, thereby answering fundamental questions regarding the emplacement age of the Agulhas Plateau.   
• The timing of sill intrusions at Site U1580 will be particularly informative, both for understanding the temporal window in which magmatism occurred on the Agulhas Plateau and, potentially, also for identifying regional, or even global, impacts of LIP volcanism on circulation and climate in the Late Cretaceous.   
• Radiogenic (e.g., Sr, Nd, Hf, Pb, and Os) and stable (e.g., O on fresh glass and mineral phases) isotope ratios from igneous rocks recovered at Sites U1579, U1580, and U1582 will allow characterization of the magma source composition and comparison with other regional or global LIPs.   
• Abundant occurrence of fresh clinopyroxene and some chromium-rich spinel in the igneous material from Sites U1579, U1580, and U1582 will allow for the reconstruction of the primitive melt (including volatile) compositions from melt inclusions (e.g., in olivine, spinel, or pyroxene) to evaluate melting processes and extents, temperatures and depths. These planned investigations will enable evaluation of whether a mantle plume drove Agulhas Plateau magmatism.   
• At Site U1582, combined petrological and trace element data on whole rocks and in particular on fresh glass (representing the melt composition) can be used to constrain the magma source temperature and degrees and depths of melting (e.g., Fitton et al., 2004; Herzberg et al., 2007; Husen et al., 2013; Putirka, 2008), crucial for distinguishing LIP formation models. Additionally, the analysis of $C O_{2}$ and other volatile gases in fresh glass from the basalt recovered at Site U1582 will provide information on the paleoenvironment during emplacement of the magmatic material.   
• Benthic foraminiferal assemblages and organic-walled microfossils at Sites U1579 and U1580 will provide insight into the paleobathymetric evolution of the Agulhas Plateau and, importantly, allow testing of whether areas of the central and southern Agulhas Plateau was subaerially exposed during its early stages of formation.   
• The recovery for the first time of Upper Cretaceous igneous and sedimentary sequences from the Agulhas Plateau provides an opportunity to revise and complement existing plate kinematic reconstructions of the early Southern Ocean and the relative motion of Africa. Paleolatitudinal constraints derived from paleomagnetic and geochronologic analyses will improve our understanding of the formation of evolving gateways and the role of the Agulhas Plateau as a volcanotectonic barrier in the context of Gondwana breakup. Although the Agulhas Plateau is thought to have formed at $65^{\circ}{-}58^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ during the mid-Cretaceous $(100{-}95\;\mathrm{Ma})$ , there is significant uncertainty in the timing and position (latitude) of emplacement because of the current lack of data.

# 5.2. Paleoceanographic and climate history  

• The recovery at Site U1579 of rhythmically bedded limestone and claystones with striking white and red alternations, coupled with a good magnetostratigraphic record and nannofossil biostratigraphy, will reveal the pacing of Campanian climate by orbital forcing and also contribute to timescale development for this understudied interval of the Cretaceous.   
• An expanded Campanian mudstone succession recovered at Site U1581 will permit reconstruction of ocean and climate conditions adjacent to the Agulhas Plateau during the Late Cretaceous using organic-walled microfossils and organic biomarkers, providing information on ocean connectivity between the Atlantic and Indian through the Southern Ocean, as well as terrestrial climate history.   
• The excellent preservation of nannofossils in the Campanian section at Site U1581 will provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine coccolithophore evolution over this time interval. Initial shipboard investigation revealed an intriguing combination of southern high-latitude and mid-latitude assemblages present at the site.   
• The good recovery of the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary interval at Sites U1579 and U1580 (and possibly U1581) will provide new materials for high-resolution investigations of the boundary event. Because the Agulhas Plateau was located in relative proximity to the Deccan Traps (western India) at the end of the Cretaceous, detailed study of the new sequences recovered during Expedition 392 should allow for examination of the timing and effects of Deccan volcanism in the context of the boundary impact event.   
• The expanded Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene sedimentary sequences recovered at Sites U1579–U1581 contain abundant calcareous microfossils, which will provide a good basis for calcareous nannofossil and foraminiferal paleoecological studies and improvement of biostratigraphic frameworks for the southern high latitudes.   
• The abundant occurrence and good preservation state of foraminifers in the Miocene– Maastrichtian sequences and inoceramid (bivalves) in the Campanian sequences will additionally provide potential for conventional oxygen and carbon isotope analysis, as well as clumped isotope analysis, for reconstruction of paleotemperature over both long and short timescales through the Cretaceous and Paleogene.   
• Two nearly complete Paleocene records were recovered at Sites U1579 and U1580 and will provide an excellent opportunity to study that time interval in the Southern Hemisphere where many records have unconformities or low carbonate content. These new materials recovered during Expedition 392 will be particularly ideal for examining plankton evolution following the Cretaceous/Paleogene mass extinction.   
• A Paleocene/Eocene boundary section was recovered at Site U1580 at relatively shallow subseafloor depths $\left(\sim\!60\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ in two parallel holes. In contrast to most deep-sea records, Site U1580 sediments remain carbonate rich across the boundary, without a clay layer that typically results from carbonate dissolution during the PETM. The minimal carbonate dissolution at Site U1580 places a new constraint on the degree of carbonate compensation depth (CCD) shoaling during the PETM, and also presents a unique opportunity to study the morphology, ecology, and geochemistry of planktonic and benthic foraminifers during the event. Foraminifer-based stable isotope investigations at Site U1580 may reveal an exceptionally complete record, particularly of the earliest phases of the event's onset, which is typically truncated by carbonate dissolution at other well-studied sites.   
• Results from preliminary rock magnetic experiments performed on discrete sediment samples collected from Expedition 392 highlight distinct variations in magnetic mineralogy at Sites U1579 and U1580, with some variations correlating with observed changes in IW geochemistry, and others with major environmental crises (e.g., Cretaceous/Paleogene and Eocene hyperthermal events). These results suggest that magnetic mineralogy can be used as an environmental proxy to highlight changes in diagenesis, redox conditions, and paleoclimate throughout the sampled sedimentary packages.   
• Paleogene sediments from Sites U1579 and U1580 are suitable for neodymium isotope analyses of fish teeth and debris, which will allow fingerprinting of deepwater masses and tracing their pathways as oceanic gateways opened in the Cretaceous and Paleogene.   
• A nearly complete Oligocene record extending through the Oligocene–Miocene transition was recovered at Site U1579. The location of Site U1579 is well situated to examine circulation changes that occurred in conjunction with establishment of large ice sheets on Antarctica at the EOT and also the gradual initiation of the ACC through the Oligocene and Miocene. Calcareous microfossil paleoecological analysis and geochemical proxy analysis, and potentially organic biomarker analysis, will enable examination of temperature and upper water column hydrographic changes through this time interval, both from the perspective of long-term trends and orbitally paced variability. These new records from the Agulhas Plateau are also particularly well situated to shed light on the timing and regional impact of the preNeogene development of the Agulhas Current.   
• Excellent physical properties data (natural gamma ray, density, seismic velocity, resistivity, porosity, MS, FMS, and UBI) collected both from the cores and downhole at Sites U1579 and U1580 will allow for successful core-log-seismic integration. In the absence of downhole logging data at Sites U1581 and U1582 (because of technical problems and bad weather), the physical properties data collected from the cores will be used for this purpose. Synthetic seismograms will allow the transfer of geological information to seismic data and thus the spatial extrapolation of this information. Ages and origins will be assigned to prominent reflections. Hiatuses and condensed sections can be characterized in three dimensions, and the seismostratigraphic models for the Agulhas Plateau and Transkei Basin will be revised. Pathways of paleocurrents will be reconstructed with the potential to form the starting point for numerical simulation of sediment transport (e.g., in combination with grain size information).   
• Core-log integration of exceptional natural gamma records obtained from the Paleocene and Eocene sections drilled at Sites U1579 and U1580 will also facilitate correlation to highresolution stratigraphic records from Shatsky Rise (North Pacific, ODP Leg 198) and Walvis Ridge (South Atlantic, ODP Leg 208). Detailed intra- and interbasin correlation will improve the stratigraphic framework for Expedition 392 cores and allow placement of the regional Agulhas Plateau paleoceanographic records into a global context.  

# 5.3. Rock-water interactions and chemical evolution  

• In addition to radiometric dating of igneous sill intrusions at Sites U1579 and U1580, postcruise investigations will focus on how volcanic intrusions have altered the organic-rich sediments these sills have penetrated through and the consequences of the magma-sediment interactions.  

• The sediments and IW from the Agulhas Plateau Sites U1579 and U1580 provide an excellent opportunity to investigate submarine (reverse) weathering of LIP basalts and authigenic mineral formation in sediments in contact with igneous sills to assess impacts on seawater chemistry and long-term carbon cycling.  

# 5.4. Additional research directions  

• At Site U1581 in the Transkei Basin, Pliocene–Pleistocene sediments of the Agulhas Drift were well recovered and characterized by interbedded pelagic oozes and distal turbidites. This sequence will allow for correlation to detailed seismic stratigraphy, as well as investigation of sediment provenance via comparison with onshore deposits and interpretation of sedimentary processes.   
• The Pliocene–Pleistocene sequence recovered at Site U1581 also contains a good record of siliceous microfossils. Postcruise analysis of diatom accumulation and assemblage composition will allow assessment of the strength and extent of Antarctic Bottom Water flow through the Agulhas Passage during the mid-Pleistocene transition.  

# 6. Outreach  

Expedition 392 had one Education and Outreach Officer, Maryalice Yakutchik, a multimedia journalist/science writer from the United States. The Outreach Officer collaborated closely with scientists, technicians, drillers and ship’s crew to engage and interact with a wide range of audience s around the world about science and day-to-day goings-on during the expedition. The aim was t o be creative and jargon-free in video broadcasts, social media posts, and blogs on the JOIDE S Resolution website, as well as in pitches and articles for external sites.  

# 6.1. Expedition activities  

# 6.1.1. Live ship-to-shore broadcasts  

During the expedition, the Education and Outreach Officer scheduled 40 ship-to-shore live Zoo m broadcasts and completed 37 (3 were canceled by organizers). All tours were conducted by th e Outreach Officer along with at least one scientist participating as tour co-leader; 15 different scientists took part in co-leading this educational effort during the expedition. Each tour was tailore d individually for students ranging from second grade to postgraduate university level, including on e special education class.  

A typical session began with an introduction to our location on the Agulhas Plateau or Transke i Basin and an explanation of expedition goals. Tours of the ship followed the core path as it come s on board. Scientists working in various laboratories spoke about their research methods, showe d images and instruments, and answered questions. A dedicated question and answer session concluded each tour/event.  

In addition to classroom events, the Expedition 392 Outreach Officer (with scientists) broadcas t live during the following:  

• A science and technology festival in the UK (panel discussion at Festival of Tomorrow), • A master’s level science-writing symposium at Johns Hopkins University,   
• IODP-related events at universities in Australia and the US,   
• An AstroGeo workshop in France with Jacques Laskar, and   
• A national conference for educators in Houston, Texas (US) (National Science Teaching Association).  

These broadcasts, arranged across seven countries and in five languages, reached thousands o f viewers across a wide range of demographics. Numerous broadcasts were recorded for future listening/viewing. Some audiences were small to medium (classrooms with 12–80 students), an d others numbered in the hundreds, some with media present. The Outreach Officer sent organizers educational material and links related to https://joidesresolution.org prior to the broadcast s and a follow-up and survey link after the broadcast.  

# 6.1.2. Storytelling  

The Education and Outreach Officer published 21 stories/blogs on the JOIDES Resolution ship’ s log page. Eleven nonfiction narrative stories written by the Outreach Officer covered science, operations on the drill floor, and activities in various laboratories and shipboard life and profile d scientists on Expedition 392. These stories, which included photos and videos, were intersperse d with weekly updates about the progress of the expedition as reported by Gabriele UenzelmannNeben, Co-Chief Scientist for Expedition 392.  

The Outreach Officer encouraged and worked with scientists to write blogs about thei r science/experiences on JOIDES Resolution; two pieces by early career scientists were published o n the JOIDES Resolution website. The Outreach Officer also assisted members of the science part y (notably six early-career scientists) in pitching, crafting, and editing stories for their hom e institutions’ publications, magazines, and/or websites (i.e., Smithsonian Institution, Australia n National University, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)-IODP Newsletter, and Kent Stat e University).  For example,  the  outreach  officer  wrote  the  following  for  Rice  University: https://news.rice.edu/news/2022/voyage-reveals-wonder-and-beauty-long-dead-ocean-dwellers.  

# 6.1.3. Social media  

In addition to blogs for the JOIDES Resolution Expedition 392 web page, the Outreach Office r created and published daily posts, including photos and videos, on a range of social media. Th e aim—to maintain a fresh presence with new content every single day throughout the expedition— was met:  

Facebook: ${>}70$ posts.   
Twitter: ${>}70$ posts.   
Instagram: 27 photo stories.  

The latest Facebook analytics (as of 2 April 2022) indicate that 37,781 people were reached between 6 March and 2 April, indicating a $51\%$ increase. Actions on page were up $400\%$ , Page View s were up $52\%$ , Page Likes were up $180\%$ , Post Reach was up $193\%$ , and Post Engagement was u p $53\%$ .  

The following were the top posts:  

• Facebook post on 29 March links to What’s in a Name blog: 15,113 people reached, including 347 engagements, which represents a $3.1\times$ higher than usual distribution score.   
• Facebook post on 19 March of photo and haiku: 8,512 people reached, including 443 engagements, which represents a $4\times$ higher than usual distribution score.   
• Facebook post on 1 March of a photo and story about the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary: 7,100 people reached, including 643 engagements.   
• Facebook post on 20 February of a photo and story called Cretaceous mania: 12,600 people reached, including 1,559 engagements.  

# 6.1.4. Special project: 3.9.2.haiku  

A haiku is an ancient poetic form, a compact bit of language that describes and reveals, with discipline and economy, timeless truths about natural phenomena. Starting with the outreach presentation shared during hotel quarantine, “3.9.2.haiku” was introduced as a collective project. Th e Outreach Officer first suggested that the science team think of haiku as the verbal equivalent of  a core and then assigned word prompts to individual scientists based on their areas of expertise, requesting they write and share an initial haiku following the presentation.  

During Weeks 3 and 4 of Expedition 392, the Outreach Officer organized two haiku writing workshops for the science team and technicians to further explore this poetic form. All were invited t o join in creating a centerpiece haiku project: a series of connected/related haiku that describes eac h of the 68 cores from Hole U1580A, in its entirety, from top to bottom. Each scientist was asked t o commit to describing two cores of their choosing. With nearly $100\%$ participation from the science party, as well as some technicians, the project (as of 3 April) represents more than 30 distinc t voices as well as a wide range of nationalities and scientific expertise.  

Postcruise and after the moratorium, the plan is to pair the series of haiku with high-resolutio n images of the corresponding cores and audio recordings of scientists reading their haiku.
