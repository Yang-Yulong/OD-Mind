# Abstract  

The Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) is a coordinated, multiexpedition International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) drilling project designed to investigate faul t mechanics  and  seismogenesis  along  subduction  megathrust s through direct sampling, in situ measurements, and long-ter m monitoring in conjunction with allied laboratory and numerica l modeling studies. The fundamental scientific objectives of the NanTroSEIZE drilling project include characterizing the nature of faul t slip and strain accumulation, fault and wall rock composition, faul t architecture, and state variables throughout the active plate boundary system. IODP Expedition 365 is part of NanTroSEIZE Stage 3, with the following primary objectives: (1) retrieval of a temporar y observatory at Site C0010 that has been monitoring temperatur e and pore pressure within the major splay thrust fault (termed th e “megasplay”) at 400 meters below seafloor since November 201 0 and (2) deployment of a complex long-term borehole monitorin g system (LTBMS) that will be connected to the Dense Oceanfloo r Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) seafloo r cabled observatory network postexpedition (anticipated June 2016). The LTBMS incorporates multilevel pore pressure sensing, a volumetric strainmeter, tiltmeter, geophone, broadband seismometer, accelerometer, and thermistor string. Together with an existing observatory at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0002 and  a possible future installation near the trench, the Site C0010 observatory will allow monitoring within and above regions of contrastin g behavior of the megasplay fault and the plate boundary as a whole. These include a site above the updip edge of the locked zone (Sit e C0002), a shallow site in the megasplay fault zone and its footwal l (Site C0010), and a site at the tip of the accretionary prism (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0006). Together, this suite o f observatories has the potential to capture deformation spanning  a wide range of timescales (e.g., seismic and microseismic activity, slow slip, and interseismic strain accumulation) across a transec t from near-trench to the seismogenic zone. Site C0010 is located 3. 5 km along strike to the southwest of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0004. The site was drilled and cased during Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 319, with casing screens spanning a ${\sim}20\mathrm{~m~}$ interval that includes the megasplay fault, and suspended with a temporary instrument package (a “SmartPlug”). During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 332 in lat e 2010, the instrument package was replaced with an upgraded senso r package (the “GeniusPlug”), which included pressure and temperature sensors and a set of geochemical and biological experiments.  

Expedition 365 achieved its primary scientific and operationa l objectives, including recovery of the GeniusPlug with a ${>}5$ y recor d of pressure and temperature conditions within the shallow megasplay fault zone, geochemical samples, and its in situ microbial colonization experiment; and installation of the LTBMS. The pressur e records from the GeniusPlug include high-quality records of formation and seafloor responses to multiple fault slip events, includin g the 11 March 2011 Tohoku M9 and 1 April 2016 Mie-ken Nanto-ok i M6 earthquakes. The geochemical sampling coils yielded in sit u pore fluids from the splay fault zone, and microbes were successfully cultivated from the colonization unit. The complex sensor array, in combination with the multilevel hole completion, is one o f the most ambitious and sophisticated observatory installations i n scientific ocean drilling (similar to that in Hole C0002G, deploye d in 2010). Overall, the installation went smoothly, efficiently, an d ahead of schedule. The extra time afforded by the efficient observatory deployment was used for coring in Holes C0010B–C0010E. Despite challenging hole conditions, the depth interval corresponding to the screened casing across the megasplay fault was successfully sampled in Hole C0010C, and the footwall of the megaspla y was sampled in Hole C0010E, with ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ recovery for both zones.  

In the hanging wall of the megasplay fault (Holes C0010C an d C0010D), we recovered indurated silty clay with occasional ash layers and sedimentary breccias. Some of the deposits show burrow s and zones of diagenetic alteration/colored patches. Mudstone s show different degrees of deformation spanning from occasional fractures to intervals of densely fractured scaly claystones of up t o ${>}10\,\mathsf{c m}$ thickness. Sparse faulting with low displacement (usually ${<}2$ cm) is seen in core and exhibits primarily normal and, rarely, reversed sense of slip. When present, ash was entrained along fractures and faults. On one occasion, a ${\sim}10\ \mathrm{cm}$ thick ash layer wa s found, which showed a fining-downward gradation into a mottle d zone with clasts of the underlying silty claystones.  

In Hole C0010E, the footwall to the megasplay fault was recovered. Sediments are horizontally to gently dipping and mainly comprise silt of olive-gray color. The deposits of the underthrus t sediment prism are less indurated than the hanging wall mudstone s and show lamination on a centimeter scale. The material is less intensely deformed than the mudstones, and apart from occasional fracturation (some of it being drilling disturbance), evidence o f structural features is absent.  

# Introduction  

Subduction zones account for $90\%$ of global seismic moment release and generate damaging earthquakes and tsunamis with potentially disastrous effects on heavily populated coastal areas (e.g., La y et al., 2005; Moreno et al., 2010; Simons et al., 2011). Understandin g the processes that govern the strength, nature, and distribution o f slip along these plate boundary fault systems is a crucial step towar d evaluating earthquake and tsunami hazards. More generally, characterizing fault slip behavior and mechanical state at all plat e boundary types through direct sampling, near-field geophysical observations, measurement of in situ conditions, and shore-based laboratory experiments is a fundamental and societally relevant goal o f modern earth science. To this end, several recent and ongoing drilling programs have targeted portions of active plate boundary fault s that have either slipped coseismically during large earthquakes o r have nucleated smaller events. These efforts include the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (Hickman et al., 2004), the Taiwan-Chelungpu Drilling Project (Ma, 2005), and Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program drilling in the Nankai Trough (Nankai Troug h Seismogenic  Zone  Experiment  [NanTroSEIZE];  Tobin  an d Kinoshita, 2006a, 2006b) and in the high-slip region of the Marc h 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project; Chester et al., 2012).  

# Background  

# Geological setting  

The Nankai Trough is formed by subduction of the Philippin e Sea plate to the northwest beneath the Eurasian plate at a rate o f ${\sim}40{-}60\,\mathrm{~mm/y}$ (Figure F1; Seno et al., 1993; Miyazaki and Heki, 2001). The convergence direction is slightly oblique to the trench, and sediments of the Shikoku Basin are actively accreting at the deformation front. The Nankai Trough is among the most extensivel y studied subduction zones in the world, and great earthquakes ar e well documented in historical and archaeological records (e.g., Ando, 1975). It has been one of the focus sites for studies of seismogenesis by both the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program and the U.S. MARGINS initiative, based on the wealth of geological and geophysical data available.  

The Nankai Trough region has a 1300 y historical record of recurring great earthquakes that are typically tsunamigenic, includin g the 1944 Tonankai M8.2 and 1946 Nankaido $_{18.3}$ earthquake s (Ando, 1975; Hori et al., 2004). The rupture area and zone of tsunami generation for the 1944 event (within which the site of International Ocean Discovery Program [IODP] Expedition 365 i s located) are now reasonably well understood (Ichinose et al., 2003; Baba et al., 2005, 2006). Land-based geodetic studies suggest tha t currently the plate boundary thrust is strongly locked (Miyazak i and Heki, 2001). Similarly, the relatively low level of microseismicit y near the updip limits of the 1940s earthquakes (Obana et al., 2001 ) implies significant interseismic strain accumulation on the megathrust. However, recent observations of very low frequency (VLF ) earthquakes within or just below the accretionary prism in the drilling area (Obara and Ito, 2005) demonstrate that interseismic strai n is not confined to slow elastic strain accumulation. Slow slip phenomena, referred to as episodic tremor and slip, including episodi c slow slip events and nonvolcanic tremor (Schwartz and Rokosky, 2007), are also widely known to occur in the downdip part of th e rupture zone (Ito et al., 2007). In the subducting Philippine Sea plat e mantle below the rupture zone, weak seismicity is observed (Oban a et al., 2005). Seaward of the subduction zone, deformation of the incoming ocean crust is suggested by microearthquakes as documented by ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) studies (Obana et al., 2005).  

The region offshore the Kii Peninsula on Honshu Island was selected for seismogenic zone drilling for several reasons. First, th e rupture area of the most recent great earthquake, the 1944 Tonanka i M8.2 event, is well constrained by recent seismic and tsunami waveform inversions (e.g., Tanioka and Satake, 2001; Kikuchi et al., 2003). Slip inversion studies suggest that only in this region did pas t coseismic rupture clearly extend shallow enough for drilling (Ichinose et al., 2003; Baba and Cummins, 2005), and an updip zone o f large slip has been identified and targeted (Figure F2). Notably, coseismic slip during events such as the 1944 Tonankai earthquak e may have occurred on the megasplay fault in addition to the plat e boundary décollement (Ichinose et al., 2003; Baba et al., 2006). Th e megasplay fault is therefore a primary drilling target equal in importance to the basal décollement. Second, OBS campaigns and onshore high-resolution geodetic studies (though of short duration ) indicate significant interseismic strain accumulation (e.g., Miyazak i and Heki, 2001; Obana et al., 2001). Third, the region offshore th e Kii Peninsula is generally typical of the Nankai margin in terms o f heat flow and sediment on the incoming plate. This is in contrast t o the area offshore Cape Muroto (the location of previous scientifi c ocean drilling) where both local stratigraphic variations associate d with basement topography and anomalously high heat flow hav e been documented (Moore, Taira, Klaus, et al., 2001; Moore et al., 2005; Moore and Saffer, 2001). Finally, the drilling targets are withi n the operational limits of riser drilling by the D/V Chikyu (i.e., maximum of $2500\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth and $7000\;\mathrm{m}$ subseafloor penetration). In the seaward portions of the Kumano Basin, the seismogenic zon e lies ${\sim}4700{-}6000\mathrm{\,m}$ beneath the seafloor (Nakanishi et al., 2002).  

# Seismic studies/site survey data  

A significant volume of site survey data has been collected in th e drilling area over many years, including multiple generations of 2- D seismic reflection (e.g., Park et al., 2002), wide-angle refraction (Nakanishi et al., 2002), passive seismicity, heat flow (Yamano et al., 2003), side-scan sonar, swath bathymetry, and submersible and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dive studies (Ashi et al., 2002). I n 2006, Japan and the United States conducted a joint 3-D seismic reflection survey over a ${\sim}11\ \mathrm{km}\times55\ \mathrm{km}$ area, acquired by PGS Geophysical, an industry service company (Moore et al., 2009). This 3- D data volume was the first deep-penetration, fully 3-D marine surve y ever acquired for basic research purposes and has been used t o (1) refine selection of drill sites and targets in the complex megasplay fault region, (2) define the 3-D regional structure and seismi c stratigraphy, (3) analyze physical properties of the subsurfac e through seismic attribute studies, and (4) assess drilling safet y (Moore et al., 2007, 2009). These high-resolution, 3-D data are being used in conjunction with physical property, petrophysical, an d geophysical data obtained from core analyses and both wireline an d logging-while-drilling (LWD) logging to allow extensive and highresolution integration of core, logs, and seismic data.  

# NanTroSEIZE drilling project  

The NanTroSEIZE project is a multiexpedition, multistag e IODP drilling project focused on understanding the mechanics o f seismogenesis and rupture propagation along subduction plat e boundary faults. The drilling program includes a coordinated effor t to sample and instrument the plate boundary system at several locations offshore the Kii Peninsula (Tobin and Kinoshita, 2006a, 2006b; Figures F1, F2). The main objectives are to understand  

• The mechanisms and processes controlling the updip aseismic– seismic transition of the megathrust fault system; • Processes of earthquake and tsunami generation; • Mechanics of strain accumulation and release; • The absolute mechanical strength of the plate boundary fault; and • The potential role of a major upper plate fault system (termed the “megasplay” fault) in seismogenesis and tsunamigenesis.  

The drilling program will evaluate a set of core hypothese s through riser and riserless drilling, long-term observatories, and associated geophysical, laboratory, and numerical modeling efforts. The following hypotheses are paraphrased from the original Integrated Ocean Drilling Program proposals and outlined in Tobin an d Kinoshita (2006a, 2006b):  

1. Systematic, progressive material and state changes control the onset of seismogenic behavior on subduction thrust faults.   
2. Subduction megathrusts are weak faults.   
3. Plate motion is accommodated primarily by coseismic frictional slip in a concentrated zone (i.e., the fault is locked during the interseismic period).   
4. Physical properties of the plate boundary system (including the fault system and its hanging wall and footwall) change with time during the earthquake cycle.   
5. A significant, laterally extensive upper plate fault system (the megasplay fault; Park et al., 2002) slips in discrete events that  

may include tsunamigenic slip during great earthquakes. It remains locked during the interseismic period and accumulates strain.  

Sediment-dominated subduction zones such as the East Aleutian, Cascadia, Sumatra, and Nankai margins are characterized b y repeated occurrences of great earthquakes of ${\sim}M8.0+$ (Ruff an d Kanamori, 1983). Although the causal mechanisms are not well understood (e.g., Byrne et al., 1988; Moore and Saffer, 2001; Saffer an d Marone, 2003) and great earthquakes are also known to occu r within sediment-starved subduction zones such as the Japa n Trench, the updip limit of the seismogenic zones at these margins i s thought to correlate with a topographic break, often associated wit h the outer rise (e.g., Byrne et al., 1988; Wang and Hu, 2006). Alon g the Nankai margin, high-resolution seismic reflection profile s across the outer rise clearly document a large out-of-sequenc e thrust fault system (the megasplay fault, after Park et al., 2002) tha t branches from the plate boundary décollement close to the updi p limit of inferred coseismic rupture in the 1944 Tonankai M8. 2 earthquake (Figures F1, F2). Several lines of evidence indicate tha t the megasplay system is active and that it may accommodate an appreciable component of plate boundary motion. However, the partitioning of strain between the lower plate interface (the décollemen t zone) and the megasplay system, as well as the nature and mechanisms of fault slip as a function of depth and time on the megaspla y are not understood. As stated in the fifth hypothesis above, one o f the first-order goals in characterizing the seismogenic zone alon g the Nankai Trough, which bears both on understanding subductio n zone megathrust behavior globally and on defining tsunami hazards, is to document the role of the megasplay fault in accommodating plate motion (both seismically and interseismically) and t o characterize its mechanical and hydrologic behavior.  

NanTroSEIZE Phase 1, conducted in 2007–2008, included thre e riserless drilling expeditions targeting the incoming sediments an d ocean crust to characterize their physical properties, composition, and state (pore pressure and temperature). Phase 2, conducted i n 2009–2011, included (1) the first riser drilling in the Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program at Site C0009 in the Kumano Basin, (2) observatory installations at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site s C0002 (long-term borehole observatory) and C0010 (temporary instrument package), and (3) additional riserless coring of subductio n inputs and mass wasting deposits on the continental slope (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010; Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expeditio n 332 Scientists, 2011; Underwood et al., 2010; Henry, Kanamatsu, Moe, and the Expedition 333 Scientists, 2012). Phase 3, begun i n 2010 and continuing with this expedition, includes riser drilling i n Holes C0002F, C0002N, and C0002P and installation of long-ter m observatories in Holes C0002G and C0010A (Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011). To date, the NanTroSEIZ E Project has included 10 expeditions, encompassing a diverse suite o f operations and lengths of individual expeditions, all conducted b y the Chikyu.  

NanTroSEIZE Stage 1 included three coordinated riserless drilling expeditions (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition s 314, 315, and 316). Eight sites were drilled across the continenta l slope and rise offshore the Kii Peninsula, many above the inferre d coseismic slip region of the 1944 Tonankai M8.2 earthquake. Th e first Stage 1 expedition (314; LWD Transect) used LWD to defin e physical properties, lithostratigraphy, and structures in advance o f coring operations (Kinoshita, Tobin, Ashi, Kimura, Lallemant, Screaton, Curewitz, Masago, Moe, and the Expedition 314/315/316 Scientists, 2009). This was followed by the first Center for Deep Eart h Exploration (CDEX) coring expedition (315; Mega-Splay Riser Pilot) aimed at sampling the materials and characterizing in situ conditions within the hanging wall of the megasplay fault to a depth o f 1000 meters below seafloor (mbsf) at Integrated Ocean Drillin g Program Site C0001 and in the Kumano Basin fill and underlyin g accretionary wedge to a depth of 1057 mbsf at Site C0002 (Ashi e t al., 2008). The third riserless expedition (316; Shallow Megaspla y and Frontal Thrusts) targeted the megasplay at a depth of 350–40 0 mbsf (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site C0004) as well as th e frontal thrust at the toe of the young accretionary prism (Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0006 and C0007) (Kimura et al., 2008).  

NanTroSEIZE Stage 2 operations began in 2009 with Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 319 (Riser/Riserless Observatory 1) followed by Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition s 322 (Subduction Inputs), 332 (Riserless Observatory), and 33 3 (Subduction Inputs 2 and Heat Flow). Expedition 319 include d (1) the first riser drilling in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, at Site C0009, which penetrated the Kumano Basin fill and into accreted strata of the Nankai wedge overlying the locked subductio n thrust, and (2) drilling across the shallow megasplay fault with LW D to a total depth (TD) of 555 mbsf at Site C0010 and installation o f casing with screens positioned to span the megasplay at 407 mbs f (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). This hole was suspended with  a temporary  observatory  attached  to  a  retrievable  bridge  plu g (termed the “SmartPlug”) to monitor temperature and pore pressure at the fault zone. Expedition 322 characterized the subductio n inputs at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0011 and C001 2 (Underwood et al., 2010). Two more Stage 2 expeditions followed  a year later. Expedition 332 recovered and replaced the temporary observatory at Site C0010 and deployed the first permanent long-ter m borehole monitoring system (LTBMS) in Hole C0002G. Expeditio n 333 then conducted additional coring operations to complete th e original objectives of Expedition 322 and to sample mass wastin g complexes on the continental slope.  

NanTroSEIZE Stage 3 operations comprise three expeditions : Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expeditions 326 (Plate Boundary Deep Riser 1), 338 (Plate Boundary Deep Riser 2), and 348 (Plat e Boundary Deep Riser 3). To date, Stage 3 has focused on riser drilling, with the ultimate objective of penetrating the megasplay fault a t $\mathord{\sim}5000$ mbsf. Expedition 326 drilled Hole C0002F to 827.5 mbsf t o set shallow casing (Kinoshita et al., 2010). Expedition 338 extende d the hole to 2005 mbsf with LWD and also conducted riserless corin g operations at Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Sites C0002, C0022, and C0021 (Moore et al., 2013). Expedition 348 deepene d Site C0002 in Holes C0002N and C0002P to a depth of 3056 mbs f (Tobin, Hirose, Saffer, Toczko, Maeda, Kubo, and the Expeditio n 348 Scientists, 2015) and included LWD as well as sampling cutting s and limited coring.  

Expedition 365 is part of NanTroSEIZE Stage 3, with the primary objectives of (1) retrieving the temporary observatory at Sit e C0010 and (2) deployment of a complex long-term observatory, which will eventually be connected to the Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (DONET) seafloor cabled observatory network (anticipated June 2016). Together wit h the existing observatory at Site C0002 and a possible future installation at Site C0006 (Figures F1, F2), the Site C0010 LTBMS will allo w monitoring within and above regions of contrasting behavior of th e megasplay fault zone and plate boundary as a whole. These includ e a site above the updip edge of the “locked” zone (Site C0002), a shallow site in the megasplay fault zone and footwall (this expedition; Site C0010), and a site at the tip of the accretionary prism (Sit e C0006), where possible monitoring has been motivated by observe d slip in the 11 March 2011 Tohoku earthquake that indicates coseismic rupture may propagate to the trench at some margins (e.g., Fujiwara  et  al.,  2011).  Together,  the  suite  of  NanTroSEIZ E observatories has the potential to capture seismic and microseismi c activity, slow slip, and interseismic strain accumulation across  a transect from near-trench to the seismogenic zone. Such temporall y continuous and spatially distributed observations are necessary t o understand how each part of the plate boundary functions throug h the seismic cycle of megathrust earthquakes.  

# Scientific objectives and operational strategy  

# Background  

Site C0010, located above the shallow megasplay fault and site d $3.5~\mathrm{km}$ southwest of previously drilled Site C0004 (Figures F1, F2, F3), was originally drilled with LWD and cased during Expeditio n 319. Operations included drilling with measurement while drillin g (MWD)/LWD across the megasplay fault to a TD of 555 mbsf, casing the borehole (with casing screens spanning the fault), conducting  an  observatory  “dummy  run”  to  test  strainmeter  an d seismometer deployment procedures, and installation of a simpl e pore pressure and temperature monitoring system (SmartPlug) attached to a retrievable bridge plug (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). The hole was revisited during Expedition 332, when the SmartPlu g was recovered and replaced with a similar temporary instrumen t package, which also included geochemical and microbiologica l sampling coils and an in situ microbiological colonization experiment; this temporary instrument package is termed the “GeniusPlug” (Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011; Figures F4, F5). Drilling during Expedition 319 identified three distinct lithologic packages at Site C0010, defined on the basis of LW D data, combined with coring and LWD at nearby Site C0004 (locate d 3.5 to the northeast along strike). From top to bottom, these lithologic packages are hemipelagic slope deposits composed primaril y of mud with minor distal turbidite interbeds (Unit I, $0{-}182.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ LWD depth below seafloor [LSF]), a thrust wedge composed o f overconsolidated and fractured clay- and mudstones (Unit II, $182.5{-}407\mathrm{~m~I~}$ SF), and overridden slope deposits (Unit III, $407~\mathrm{m}$ LSF to TD). At Site C0010, Unit I is divided into two subunits: Subunit IA $\left(0{-}161.5\,\mathrm{m}\,\mathrm{LSF}\right)$ ), characterized by gamma ray and resistivit y patterns similar to those observed in Unit I at Site C0004 (Expedition 314 Scientists, 2009), and Subunit IB $(161.5{-}182.8\mathrm{~m~L~}$ SF), interpreted as slope sediments composed of material reworked fro m the underlying thrust wedge.  

For Expedition 365, the observatory system at Site C0010 consisted of an array of sensors (Figure F6) designed to monitor crusta l deformation and hydrologic processes in the offshore portion of th e subduction system over a wide range of timescales. These monitoring targets include seismicity and microseismicity, slow slip event s and VLF earthquakes, hydrologic transients, ambient pore pressure, and temperature. To allow the high sampling rates and ensur e power delivery for the long-term and continuous monitoring necessary to capture this full range of events, the borehole observator y plans called for the observatory to be connected to the DONE T submarine cable network (http://www.jamstec.go.jp/donet/e) after the drilling expedition in June 2016. The LTBMS installed at Sit e C0002 is already connected to this network, and the formation pressure data can be viewed and downloaded at an open-access observatory data portal (http://offshore.geosc.psu.edu).  

# Scientific objectives  

The primary plan for Expedition 365 was to recover the GeniusPlug installed in Hole C0010A during Expedition 332 (shown in Figure F5), deepen the hole from 555 to 655 mbsf, underream the hol e below the $9\%$ inch casing to 10 inch diameter, and install th e LTBMS. Site C0010 constitutes the second LTBMS installatio n during NanTroSEIZE. The downhole configuration of the observatory includes (1) pressure ports, (2) a volumetric strainmeter, (3)  a broadband seismometer, (4) a tiltmeter, (5) three-component geophones, (6) three-component accelerometers, and (7) a thermometer array (Figure F6). The set of sensors is designed to collect, as  a whole, multiparameter observations in a wide period range fro m months to 0.01 s and over a wide dynamic range to sense tectoni c and hydrologic events that include responses to local microearthquakes, VLF earthquakes, and the largest potential earthquake slip s of the Tonankai plate boundary $6\,\mathrm{km}$ below the sensors. The observatory installation was planned to operate initially in a standalon e mode at the wellhead, using batteries and data recorders, with dat a recovery by subsequent ROV operations. Following the expedition, an ROV cruise was planned for June 2016 to download initial data, conduct hydrostatic sensor checks for the pressure transducers, an d connect the system to DONET so that measurements can be observed in real time from a shore-based monitoring station.  

Observatory operations went smoothly and faster than planned , enabling us to conduct coring operations. This degree of contingency was not anticipated at the time of expedition planning, and a s such, was not described in Kopf et al. (2015), and the expedition wa s not originally staffed for core sampling, measurements, or description. As a result, description and analysis of the cores was deferre d to a shore-based sampling party on board the Chikyu in the port o f Shimizu, Japan, in July–August 2016. The opportunity to collec t cores introduced new science objectives for the expedition, including sampling of material from the hanging wall and footwall of th e megasplay fault both for standard shipboard analyses and for subsequent shore-based study and characterization of the formation an d interstitial fluids spanning the depth range of the screened casing. The latter of these objectives, in particular, has the potential t o greatly enhance interpretations of the LTBMS and GeniusPlug data. Specific objectives for Site C0010 during Expedition 365 were to   
1. Recover the GeniusPlug installed in 2010 and conduct initial shipboard analyses of the recovered pore pressure and temperature data, fluids sampled by the sampling coils, and microbiological colonization experiment.   
2. Drill out the cement plug at the casing shoe, extend the borehole to a TD of 655 mbsf, and conduct reaming to prepare the hole for observatory installation.   
3. Deploy a long-term borehole monitoring system that includes pore pressure ports at three levels, a thermistor string, and a suite of geophysical instruments (strainmeter, tiltmeter, and seismometer) in a configuration like that in Hole C0002G (Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011).   
4. Drill, collect, and analyze core samples across the megasplay fault and spanning the interval of screened casing in Hole C0010A.  

# Operational strategy  

Planned work during Expedition 365 included two main operations, both at the cased borehole in Hole C0010A (Figure F7). Th e first operation was the recovery of the GeniusPlug autonomou s sampling unit. This was to begin following transit from Shimiz u harbor to Site C0010 and after ROV dives to conduct a seafloor survey, set transponders, and remove the Hole C0010A well corrosio n cap. Once complete, the vessel was to move away from the Kuroshi o Current to a low-current area (LCA) to make up the GeniusPlug recovery bottom-hole assembly (BHA). The BHA consisted of the L$10\;\mathrm{{on}}$ /off tool, designed to recover the retrievable bridge plug fro m which the GeniusPlug was suspended. Once recovered from Hol e C0010A, the vessel was to return to the LCA while the BHA wa s pulled out of the hole to the rig floor, the GeniusPlug would then b e moved to the laboratory for data download, and the OsmoSampler/Flow-through Osmo Colonization System (FLOCS) experiment would be moved to the microbiology laboratory for samplin g and analysis.  

The next operation was to extend previously drilled Hol e C0010A from 555 to 655 mbsf using a combination drill bit an d underreamer BHA. Once drilling was finished, the drilling/underreaming BHA was to be pulled out of the hole and replaced with  a scraper BHA to ensure the cased section of the well was clear of an y obstructions. The expedition science objectives would be completed with operations to deploy the LTBMS. This involved considerable moonpool preparation using newly developed guide roller s to run the completion.  

A major impediment to observatory deployment in the Nanka i region is the extremely strong Kuroshio Current. Current speeds u p to $6~\mathrm{kt}$ are possible, and the current flow past the drill string commonly results in vortex-induced vibration (VIV), which has cause d lost drill pipe, dropped casing, and destroyed electronic sensor s during past Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). CDEX has developed a series of mitigation techniques and equipment to minimize or suppress VIV. Thes e include the attachment of ropes to drill string sections exposed t o the current, preventing the formation of vortices as the curren t flows past the drill string. Other newly developed tools are th e moonpool guide rollers, which support the drill string in the moonpool and provide a safe platform for moonpool work, and guides fo r attaching the VIV-suppressing ropes, cables, and hydraulic flatpac k lines to the LTBMS observatory instruments.  

The operational plan called for the LTBMS to be made up fro m the bottom bullnose to the seafloor LTBMS head as the completio n was run into the moonpool. A series of system checks on the statu s of the strainmeter, tiltmeter, broadband seismometer, and pressur e sensor unit (PSU) were to be performed at set stages as the LTBM S and sensors were assembled. Once the LTBMS was completed an d run into the water, the Chikyu would then drift back into the Kuroshio Current to run the LTBMS into Hole C0010A. After checkin g that all systems were working, the LTBMS would be cemented i n place, and the vessel would release the LTBMS running tool and recover the drill string.  

Coring operations were planned to maximize limited availabl e time in order to target the key interval spanning the megasplay faul t and the screened casing zone and to penetrate and sample the footwall. For this reason, in Hole C0010B (abandoned due to bad hol e conditions after a single core with no recovery) and subsequently i n Hole C0010C we planned to drill without coring to 300 mbsf and t o then core across the fault (located at 407 mbsf in Hole C0010A a s identified by LWD data). In Hole C0010C, coring reached 395 mbs f before hole conditions deteriorated, requiring that we abandon th e hole. For Holes C0010D and C0010E, the coring strategy was modified in light of limited remaining operational time. For these holes, we planned to drill without coring to a depth closer to the anticipated fault and then begin coring from ${\sim}15$ to $20\,\mathrm{m}$ above the megasplay and into the footwall. This depth was 385 mbsf in Hol e C0010D and 360 mbsf in Hole C0010E, where the megasplay wa s shallower because the hole was located ${\sim}100\,\mathrm{~m~}$ updip of Hole s C0010A–C0010D (cf. Figure F3).  

# Operations  

# Port call and transit to Site C0010  

Expedition 365 began in the port of Shimizu, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, on 26 March 2016. The first few days were spent quayside, loading cargo and supplies. The science party boarded th e Chikyu on 27 March and participated in the shipboard prespu d meeting on 28 March. The Chikyu sailed from Shimizu at $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 29 March (Table T1), lowered the azimuth thrusters, and arrived o n location at Site C0010 at $0330\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 March.  

# Site C0010  

While the supply boat searched for the Kuroshio Current edg e (LCA), the ROV dove to survey the seabed, set transponders, an d remove the corrosion cap. The Chikyu moved to the LCA to begi n running the BHA in the hole (Table T2) from $2145~\mathrm{h}$ . The scienc e party placed an accelerometer on the drill string to evaluate th e Kuroshio Current VIV as preparation for GeniusPlug recovery an d LTBMS running operations.  

The Chikyu reached the LCA $12\,\mathrm{nmi}$ northwest of Site C0010 a t $0000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 March 2016 and began drifting back to the well center. At $1136\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 April, an $_{16.0}$ earthquake struck, with the reporte d hypocenter ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{nmi}$ to the northwest of Site C0010 and $15\,\mathrm{km}$ deep. The quake was felt aboard the ship. Running drill pipe resumed, an d on 1 April, the L-10 BHA was over the wellhead and was stabbed in. The BHA landed on the bridge plug and the drill string rotated t o release the mechanical seal. The bridge plug and the GeniusPlu g successfully cleared the wellhead at $2040~\mathrm{h}$ . The L-10 BHA wa s pulled out of the hole as the Chikyu moved toward the LCA to recover the BHA and GeniusPlug on deck. The L-10 tool, the bridg e plug, and the GeniusPlug were recovered on deck at $0500~\mathrm{h}$ on  3 April. The OsmoSampler portion of the GeniusPlug was opened, and the FLOCS and OsmoSampler experiments were moved to th e microbiology laboratory.  

The Chikyu began drifting to the LCA 8 nmi west of Site C001 0 and began rigging up the guide horn in preparation for drilling ou t the cement plug. From early on 4 April $(0100\mathrm{~h})$ the drilling an d underreaming BHA (Table T2) was assembled and run in the hole. Drilling out the cement started from $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 April. Once drilling out cement was completed, the underreamer was activated an d opened the hole until reaching TD (654 mbsf; $3206~\mathrm{m}$ below rotar y table [BRT]) at $1945~\mathrm{h}$ . A short wiper trip confirmed no excessiv e overpull or torque. The underreamer BHA was pulled out of th e hole, reaching the deck by 5 April. The $9\%$ inch casing scraper BH A was made up and run in the hole (Table T2). The BHA was stabbe d into the Hole C0010A wellhead and scraped to $2934\mathrm{~m~}$ BRT. Th e scraper BHA was pulled out of the hole and laid down by $0900\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 6 April. The guide horn was rigged down, and preparations for running the LTBMS completion began. However, the approach of  a cold front necessitated waiting on weather until $0245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 8 April. At that time, LTBMS preparations were restarted. The LTBM S completion string was run in the hole, and miniscreens for pressur e Port P1, cables, and sensors were attached to the completion string. On the morning of 9 April, the sensor cables were connected to th e strainmeter, seismometer, and thermistor. Testing revealed that th e strainmeter and seismometer were faulty, so the LTBMS was pulle d out of the hole to the rig floor so that the faulty sensors could b e replaced with standby instruments. The testing cable also turne d out to be faulty, so it was also replaced. The replacement sensor s and LTBMS assembly was completed by $1615\ \mathrm{h},$ and the LTBM S completion was run in the hole. The LTBMS assembly continued t o be run, pausing on 10 April to install the swellable packer in th e moonpool from $1815~\mathrm{h}$ . The LTBMS head and hydraulically activated running tool (HART) (Table T2) were picked up then mad e up to the rest of the LTBMS completion assembly and lowered int o the moonpool by $1700~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 April. There, the stainless steel hydraulic $\%$ inch lines leading from the PSU mounted on the LTBM S head were connected to the flatpack running down to the pressur e ports. The PSU valves were kept “open” to prevent damage durin g running. The sensor cables were measured and prepared for termination at Teledyne Oil and Gas ODI connectors by 12 April. A dat a logger and battery unit were mounted on the ROV platform to collect data until the planned connection to the DONET undersea cable network in June 2016.  

The LTBMS completion assembly was run into the water, and b y $1000~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 April the vessel was back at Site C0010. The LTBM S completion assembly reentered the Hole C0010A wellhead. Th e ROV moved the PSU 2-way valves from open to “closed” to protec t the lines from fouling during landing, circulation, and cementing. The LTBMS head was landed by $0515\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 April. Cementing wa s finished by $1045~\mathrm{h}$ . The HART was released from the LTBMS an d pulled out of the hole, and on 15 April the BHA was laid down o n the rig floor by $2300~\mathrm{h}$ . The moonpool completion guide, completion guide roller, and VIV-suppression rope drums were remove d from the working cart and blowout preventer cart so that rigging u p the guide horn could begin for contingency coring operations at Sit e C0010.  

A series of 10 sensor health checks (Table T1) were run on th e sensors at specific stages during the assembly and running of th e LTBMS. Except for the sensor failure noted above, all health check s were positive.  

Contingency coring operations were originally planned to tes t the Turbine Driven Coring System developed by CDEX in preparation for deep coring operations. However, after considering th e large amount of time remaining to the expedition, the Co-Chief Scientists, Expedition Project Manager, and Operations Superintendent (OSI) all agreed to move forward with rotary core barrel (RCB ) coring in order to maximize potential science returns. Coring wa s conducted in four holes, all of which were drilled down without coring to ${}^{\ge300}$ mbsf: Holes C0010B (300–309.5 mbsf), C0010C (300– 395 mbsf), C0010D $(385{-}394.5~\mathrm{\mbsf})$ , and C0010E (360–39 1 mbsf). Coring was most successful in Hole C0010C (Table T3) wit h $52.6~\mathrm{m}$ of core collected for a $95~\mathrm{m}$ advance $(55.4\%$ recovery). Cor e recovery rates tended to increase with depth in both Holes C0010 C and C0010E. There were problems with borehole stability, and thes e required abandoning each hole with the exception of Hole C0010E. Core recovery continued to be high at this site, but with the drawworks needing maintenance, the consensus was to halt coring operations once major coring targets, including the footwall at Sit e C0010, were recovered. With the recovery of the RCB BHA on deck, science operations for Expedition 365 were completed (Table T4) . The Chikyu returned to Shimizu harbor on 27 April and lowere d the gangplank at $1030\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Because of the core recovered, a shore-based sample party wa s held aboard the Chikyu while quayside in Shimizu, Japan, from 2 5 July to 5 August 2016.  

# Principal results GeniusPlug  

One of the primary objectives of Expedition 365 was to recove r the GeniusPlug temporary observatory from Hole C0010A (Figure s F8, F9; see also Figure F4) and conduct initial analyses of the pressure and temperature data, fluid geochemical samples collected i n both chemical and biological sampling coils, and FLOCS for microbiology. All of these data and samples were successfully recovere d from the instrument package, although a significant fraction of fluids in the chemical and biological sampling coils was lost upon depressurization and on the rig floor.  

The pressure and temperature records clearly document severa l key events during the $5.3\mathrm{~y~}$ deployment period (November 201 0 through April 2016). Initial analysis of the data illustrates two ke y results. First, on the basis of hydraulic isolation of the formatio n (downward looking) and hydrostatic reference (upward looking ) sensors, it is clear that the bridge plug successfully sealed, and thu s that the downward-looking sensor provides a meaningful record o f formation pressure. This is most evident at the start and end of th e deployment when the bridge plug was set and retrieved, respectively. In both cases, the hydrostatic pressure record exhibits larg e perturbations associated with drill string movement and attaching/detaching the running tool, whereas the downward-lookin g pressure record is stable (Figure F10). Additionally, initial review o f the pressure-time series documents clear responses to regional an d local earthquakes. These include the 11 March 2011 Tohoku M 9 event and the 1 April 2016 Mie-ken Nanto-oki M6 earthquake (Figures F11, F12). The latter event occurred below and slightly landward of Site C0010 and is manifested as the arrival of a wavetrai n followed by a distinct pressure increase of ${\sim}0.4\,\mathrm{kPa}$ , likely indicatin g compressional coseismic strain. For both events, the subsequen t tsunami wave is also clearly recorded in both the seafloor and formation sensors. These examples serve to highlight the ability of offshore borehole observatory systems to sense a wide range of crustal strain processes and in detailed characterization of events enable d by monitoring in the near-field.  

Analysis of the GeniusPlug fluid samples indicates that, fo r many elements (e.g., Cl, K, Ca, and Br), the fluids sampled by th e OsmoSampler coils are broadly consistent with formation pore fluids measured from cores at both Sites C0004 and C0010 (Figur e F13). However, some key differences were also observed betwee n the two sets of samples and between the GeniusPlug fluid sample s and previously collected interstitial pore waters. The biology coils, which drew fluid from the screened interval of the borehole the n through the FLOCS unit (Figure F13) and into the sampling coil, exhibit elevated B and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ and reduced Ba concentrations relative t o the chemical coils, which drew water directly from the borehole. The higher $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ (similar to interstitial waters at Site C0004) and reduced Ba are consistent with barite precipitation in the FLOCS unit, whereas the lower $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ in the chemistry coil may reflect microbia l uptake of sulfate in the chemical coil due to unanticipated colonization of the membrane itself. Gradually increasing salinity in th e chemical coil toward the inlet may reflect an artifact caused by leakage across the membrane in the chemistry unit’s pump.  

The OsmoSampler and FLOCS provided a an opportunity to sample native microbial communities living in the pervasively fractured thrust wedge, with the advantage that pristine in situ fluids and microbes could be collected without drilling-induced contamination. This marked the first deployment of a FLOCS unit in a sedimentary environment (Figure F14A). When the OsmoSampler and FLOCS unit were recovered, substrates were subsampled for DNA analyses, microscopy, and culture experiments. The culture experiments were initiated on board and inoculated with substrates of the FLOCS. The observed growth from these cultures—and not the controls—suggests that the FLOCS successfully collected viable microorganisms (Figure F14B–F14G), validating the use of OsmoSampler and FLOCS technology in sedimentary environments. Future shore-based DNA analyses will further characterize these microbial communities and their metabolic potentials.  

# LTBMS installation  

As described in Scientific objectives, from bottom to top the LTBMS included (see Figure F6) hydraulic ports to monitor pore fluid pressure in an open hole interval spanning from 602 mbsf to the TD of 655 mbsf; a volumetric strainmeter $(572{-}580.6~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ); a tilt combo package that includes a broadband seismometer, geophone, accelerometer, tiltmeter, and a thermistor string mounted on a sensor carrier $(565{-}572\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ; and an upper hydraulic port to monitor pore pressure in a screened interval spanning the megasplay fault (Figures F15, F16, F17). The thermistor string data logger was mounted on the sensor carrier; however, the string itself consisted of 5 thermistors spanning from 396 to 563 mbsf. In addition, a hydraulic port was included in the instrument carrier-strainmeter assembly, which was to be cemented in the hole (Figure F6). The three hydraulic lines were encased in urethane within a single umbilical flatpack and broken out for termination at each of the three downhole port locations. A swellable packer set above the screened casing interval provides hydraulic isolation between the upper pressure port and the overlying ocean. Taken together, the suite of instruments will enable measurement of crustal deformation over a wide bandwidth (from 0.01 s to several months or longer)  with  the  high  precision  needed  to  detect  earthquakes, microseismicity, low frequency earthquakes, and slow slip events.  

The locations of the sensors in the array were chosen on the basis of logging data from Expedition 319, in combination with coring results from Site C0004 located $3.5\;\mathrm{km}$ to the east-northeast along strike (Kimura et al., 2008; Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010) (Figure F6). The lowermost pressure port is located within overridden slope sediments in the footwall of the megasplay fault (Unit III). The strainmeter and instrument carrier are also installed within Unit III. The total thermistor string length is $175\,\mathrm{m},$ , with the two uppermost nodes located within the screened casing interval, two more below the screened interval, and the bottom node just above the instrument carrier.  

The completion string for the LTBMS was prepared by attaching the sensors, cables, pressure ports, and hydraulic lines to $3\%$ inch tubing. The top of the string was terminated at the LTBMS head where underwater mateable connectors (UMC) and hydraulic lines with valves and the pressure sensing unit were mounted (Figure F15). An ROV platform was attached to the wellhead prior to lowering the wellhead into water. A titanium sphere data recorder and communications unit with three UMC hoses connected to each downhole sensor was also installed on the ROV platform. At the time of initial assembly, the PSU began continuous recording to its stand-alone data logger with a 1 min sampling interval. The hydraulic valves on the LTBMS head were set to connect the pressure gauges in the PSU to the overlying ocean but isolated from the formation hydraulic lines to avoid potential damage to the sensors due to pressure fluctuations during landing and cementing operations. The other sensors were not recording at this time.  

Assembly was conducted in a LCA to avoid potential vibration and damage caused by lowering the string through the Kuroshio Current. VIV was also suppressed by attaching ropes to the drill string while deploying and drifting (Kopf, Araki, Toczko, and the Expedition 332 Scientists, 2011). Additionally, newly developed moonpool equipment, including guide rollers and completion guide rollers, were used to more efficiently and smoothly attach the hydraulic umbilical and cables (guide roller) and ropes (completion guide roller). Throughout the deployment sequence (i.e., string assembly, lowering, drifting, reentry, landing, and cementing), a series of communication tests were conducted with the borehole instruments to verify sensor and cable function.  

After landing the LTBMS, we initialized the data recorder to start data acquisition for the tilt combo package and strainmeter. The ROV maintained a connection to the data recorder at this time to monitor the status of the sensors during cementing. Temperature records during this period document cooling of the borehole due to circulation. Pressure recorded at the strainmeter port indicates a pressure increase of ${\sim}0.7\;\mathrm{MPa}$ during cementing, indicating that 78 m of seawater above the pressure sensor was displaced by the denser cement. After cementing was complete, the hydraulic valves at the LTBMS head were turned to connect the pressure gauges to the formation hydraulic lines, and initial pressure data spanning the descent through the water column and LTBMS head landing were recovered by the ROV. The PSU logger memory was then cleared, and valve configurations and positions of all instruments installed on the ROV platform were checked by visual inspection prior to leaving the site.  

# Coring  

Coring operations were conducted in four holes: C0010B– C0010D, located within $30\,\mathrm{~m~}$ and offset along strike from Hole C0010A, and Hole C0010E, offset $95\mathrm{~m~}$ to the south-southeast in the updip direction where the thrust wedge is thinner and the megasplay fault is shallower (Figures F1A, F3). Because coring operations were not anticipated and were not part of the primary expedition plan, the shipboard laboratory technical and science party was not staffed to split, describe, or sample cores. For this reason, whole (unsplit) cores were sampled for gas analyses and immediately scanned with X-ray computed tomography to identify candidate intervals for whole-round sampling. After taking whole-round samples for interstitial water and microbiology, the cores were run through the whole-round multisensor core logger and then refrigerated. All further shipboard analyses and sampling were deferred until a sampling party conducted on the Chikyu while in port in Shimizu, Japan, from 25 July to 5 August 2016.  

Coring in Holes C0010C and C0010D recovered fractured silty claystone from depths corresponding to the hanging wall of the megasplay $({<}400\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ). Core samples collected from Hole C0010E span the interval from 366 to 391 mbsf and primarily recovered clayey siltstones from the footwall of the fault (Figure F18). The hanging wall to the megasplay fault (Holes C0010C and C0010D) is dominated by indurated, gray to greenish gray silty claystone. The silty claystone is mottled by bioturbation where intact but more typically overprinted by deformation and coring disturbance, wit h many intervals of dense fractures and drill breccia. Subordinat e lithologies include thin beds of gray vitric ash. The ash is locally entrained along fractures and faults. This unit also contains interval s of sedimentary breccia with subrounded to subangular clasts of remobilized mudstone supported by a mudstone matrix. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data show high percentages of total clay mineral s relative to quartz and feldspar.  

The footwall to the megasplay fault contains olive-gray claye y siltstone that is weakly indurated and consistently coarser graine d than strata in the hanging wall. Bioturbation and faint laminae ar e widespread. Thin interbeds of dark gray silt are common, typicall y with sharp bases, normal size grading, and plane-parallel laminae. Thin interbeds of light to medium gray vitric ash are also common. Some intervals in the footwall display contorted soft-sediment deformation, with highly variable dips to laminae, clasts of remobilized mudstone, and pebble- to granule-sized lithic fragments an d pumice supported by a matrix of silty claystone. XRD data sho w consistent increases in the relative percentages of quartz and feldspar relative to the hanging wall.  

Bedding in Holes C0010C and C0010D, in the hanging wall o f the megasplay fault, is near horizontal or gently dipping from 300 t o ${\sim}350$ mbsf. Dips steepen and are up to $50^{\circ}{-}60^{\circ}$ in the ${\sim}50~\mathrm{m}$ abov e the fault, likely related to deformation caused by slip on the megasplay. Faults and shear zones in the hanging wall also dip moderately. High-angle faults, one of which is identified as a reverse fault, are only observed at ${\sim}375$ mbsf. Bedding in Hole C0010E in th e footwall of the fault is horizontal or gently dipping; unlike the hanging wall, low-angle $(<\!30^{\circ})$ anastomosing shear zones are common.  

Porosity within the hanging wall ranges from $40\%$ to $50\%$ an d averages ${\sim}42\%$ (Figure F19). Although scattered, there is a distinc t increase in porosity in the footwall cored in Hole C0010E, with values ranging from $45\%$ to $50\%$ and averaging $48\%$ . $P$ -wave velocity i n all orientations increases gradually with depth in the hanging wall i n Holes C0010C and C0010D from ${\sim}1900~\mathrm{m/s}$ to ${\sim}2000~\mathrm{m/s}$ in th e interval 300–395 mbsf. In the footwall (Hole C0010E), $P$ -wave velocity is nearly constant with depth at ${\sim}1880~\mathrm{m/s}$ . Average therma l conductivities are 1.37, 1.47, and $1.3\ \mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ for Holes C0010C, C0010D, and C0010E, respectively. In general, thermal conductivit y in the hanging wall is higher than in the footwall. The higher $P.$ -wav e velocity and thermal conductivity in the hanging wall relative to th e footwall is consistent with its lower porosity.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

Expedition 365 achieved its two primary scientific and operational objectives, including (1) recovery of the GeniusPlug temporary monitoring system with a ${>}5$ y record of pressure an d temperature conditions within the shallow megasplay fault zone, geochemical samples, and an in situ microbial colonization experiment (Figures F8, F9) and (2) installation of a permanent LTBM S with a suite of instruments to monitor seismicity, deformation, an d hydrogeological processes. The complex LTBMS sensor array, i n combination with the multilevel hole completion, is one of the mos t ambitious and sophisticated observatory installations in scientifi c ocean drilling (similar to that in Hole C0002G, deployed in 2010). Additional operational challenges to deployment of the observator y string are presented by the $2500\,\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth and the stron g Kuroshio Current (reaching speeds ${>}5$ kt during the expedition). Overall, the installation went smoothly, efficiently, and ahead o f schedule. The extra time afforded by the efficient observatory deployment was used for coring at Site C0010. Despite challengin g hole conditions, the depth interval corresponding to the screene d casing across the megasplay fault was successfully sampled in Hol e C0010C, and the footwall of the megasplay was sampled in Hol e C0010E, with ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ recovery for both zones. Taken together wit h promising initial results from the GeniusPlug, this represents a clea r success in meeting—and exceeding—Expedition 365 objectives.  

Notably, many of the previous problems related to running complex observatory arrays in the Kuroshio Current have been successfully mitigated. During deployment “dummy runs” in this are a during Expedition 319, VIV of the drill pipe in the water colum n caused extensive damage to sensors and led to the loss of instruments (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010). During the most recen t NanTroSEIZE LTBMS installation during Expedition 332 (Hol e C0002G), VIV was mitigated with the use of ropes attached to th e upper portion of the drill pipe, which reduced vibration by disrupting the flow of water around the pipe and prevented the formatio n of a low-pressure region behind (downstream) of the pipe. However, attachment of ropes, umbilical flatpack, and cables to the pipe still presents an operational challenge and requires considerable tim e because the lines need to be gathered and strapped to the pipe ever y $\sim\!2\textrm{m}$ . During Expedition 365, newly developed moonpool equipment, including a guide roller and completion guide roller, vastly increased efficiency and safety by providing guides to align th e umbilical and cables (guide roller) and ropes (completion guid e roller) for attachment to the pipe as it was lowered through th e moonpool. We attribute much of the operation’s success during th e expedition to these advances. The increased efficiency afforded extra days for science operations; as a result, we were able to collec t core samples that will provide crucial data to aid in interpretation o f the observatory data. The increased efficiency also minimized th e time spent suspending sensitive instrumentation in the water column, which in turn minimized the risk of damage due to heave an d vibration in the current.  

Initial analysis of the GeniusPlug pressure, temperature, chemical, and microbiological experiments has provided promising results. Coring of the thrust wedge immediately above the megaspla y fault has yielded key samples for postexpedition analyses and fo r comparison of pore fluid geochemistry with that sampled by th e GeniusPlug. The key outcomes of the expedition include  

• Complete recovery of continuous pressure and temperature records from the GeniusPlug, which include high-quality records of formation and seafloor responses to multiple fault slip events, including the 2011 Tohoku M9 earthquake (Figure F11), the 1 April 2016 Mie-Ken Nanto-oki M6 earthquake (Figure F12), and additional tentatively identified slip events associated with VLF earthquakes (one possibly triggered by the Tohoku earthquake and another in October 2015) (Tobin, Hirose, Saffer, Toczko, Maeda, Kubo, and the Expedition 348 Scientists, 2015);   
• Recovery of the FLOCS unit and geochemical sampling coils and successful cultivation of microbes from the FLOCS unit (Figure F14);   
• Successful deployment of the LTBMS string and completion of the hole (Figure F6); and   
• Coring in the deepest part of the thrust wedge above the megasplay fault (Holes C0010C and C0010D) and into the footwall of the fault (Hole C0010E), with $>\!50\%$ recovery of the formation; these samples provide valuable context for the formation physical properties and interstitial water geochemistry and will greatly enhance interpretation of the GeniusPlug and LTBMS data sets.  

The GeniusPlug record of the Mie-ken Nanto-oki earthquak e documents a positive offset in pressure following the event, indicating compressional strain, and is consistent with observations fro m the previously installed LTBMS in Hole C0002G. This is importan t because together these data can uniquely distinguish between th e two potential focal mechanisms identified by seismological data ( a steeply southeast-dipping nodal plane vs. a shallow northwest-dipping one) and provide key evidence supporting a thrusting event either within the accretionary wedge or at the plate interface. W e anticipate that future analysis of other earthquakes in the pressur e record will produce similar insights.  

The GeniusPlug chemistry coils provide fluid samples that are, to first order, consistent with interstitial pore fluids collected acros s the megathrust at nearby Site C0004 (Kimura et al., 2008). However, loss of substantial fluid during recovery (possibly related to gas exsolution and expansion in the coils) in combination with cracking o f the membranes for the chemical sampling coils preclude a detaile d analysis of the time series data. Additional targeted analysis of samples and review of the data postexpedition may provide further insights. Care should be taken in future deployments to develop  a mechanism to seal the sampling coils and to improve access to th e coils on the rig floor to prevent depressurization and/or minimiz e fluid loss during recovery and transport of the coils to the shipboar d laboratories.  

The second primary objective of Expedition 365 was to install  a permanent LTBMS (Figures F6, F15, F16, F17). This was completed successfully and ahead of schedule. All observatory components were tested at several stages before, during, and after reentr y and final deployment. These tests verify that all cables, data transmission, and instruments were not damaged during the deploymen t procedure and were functioning at the time of cementing and hol e completion. After Expedition 365, the LTBMS, including multileve l pressure sensors and the full suite of geodetic and seismological instruments, was connected successfully to DONET during a Japa n Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology cruise on 19 Jun e 2016. From that time onward, power has been supplied by the cabled network and the data sampling rate for pressure has increase d from $60\,{\mathrm{s}}$ to $_{1\,s}$ .  

In addition to accomplishing the planned expedition objective s noted above, efficient observatory operations afforded contingenc y time that was used to core the hanging wall and footwall of th e megasplay fault and recover materials representative of the formation where observatory instruments are placed (Figure F4). Th e hanging wall is characterized by fractured claystones, whereas th e footwall is characterized by relatively less deformed and slightl y coarser grained overridden slope apron deposits. These siltstone s are similar to those cored at Sites C0001 and C0004 (Figure F18, F19) with some key differences, notably: (1) the hanging wall at Sit e C0010 has slightly lower porosity and higher $P$ -wave velocity tha n the hanging wall at Site C0004, consistent with differences in LW D data sets between the two sites and suggesting that the thrust wedg e at Site C0010 is slightly more consolidated and/or clay rich than it s counterpart along strike and (2) higher calcite content (up to 1 5 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) indicative of deeper environment of deposition closer to th e carbonate compensation depth (CCD) and thinner mass transpor t deposits.  

Overall, the expedition was a clear success. All of the scientifi c and operational goals were achieved and completed well ahead o f schedule, allowing for ${\sim}5$ days of contingency operations that included coring at Site C0010. This is noteworthy because the site s had been logged with LWD during Expedition 319 at the time th e casing was emplaced (Expedition 319 Scientists, 2010) but had no t been cored. Collection of samples will provide key constraints o n rock properties and provide valuable context (i.e., pore fluid geochemistry and physical properties) for interpretation of observator y and GeniusPlug data. For the earthquake events analyzed in ou r preliminary review of the data set, the borehole measurements, together with data from the previously installed borehole observator y in Hole C0002G, provide important and unique constraints on bot h slow earthquakes and the details of rupture in the Mie-ken Nantooki earthquake. These examples underscore the essential value o f borehole observatories in understanding earthquake and tsunam i processes through monitoring in boreholes that place instrument s nearby, within, and directly above the earthquake-generating faults.
