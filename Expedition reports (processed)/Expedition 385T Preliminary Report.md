# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditio n 385T aimed to take advantage of a transit of the R/V JOIDES Resolution from Antofagasta, Chile, to San Diego, California (USA), to accomplish new sampling and data collection from legacy borehol e observatories in Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Holes 504B and 896A on the southern flank o f the Costa Rica Rift. In addition, the US Science Support Progra m organized the participation of 3 Outreach Officers to evaluate th e performance of the JOIDES Resolution Outreach Officer program a s well as 2 educators and 12 undergraduate students for a shipboar d “JR Academy.” Our scientific objectives were to collect (1) new Formation MicroScanner logs from Hole 504B for improving lithologi c interpretations of crustal architecture at this archetype deep oceanic crust hole and (2) fluid samples from both holes for evaluatin g the crustal deep biosphere in deep and warm oceanic crust. Thes e operations in Holes 504B and 896A have direct relevance to Challenges 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14 of the IODP 2013–2023 Science Plan. Accomplishing both of these scientific objectives required the removal of old wireline CORK observatories, including associated inflatable packers that were installed in the cased boreholes in 2001. The fluid sampling plan also included testing a new Multi-Temperature Fluid Sampler. Despite successfully removing the CORK wellhead platforms from both holes, we were unable to remove th e packers stuck in casing at both locations after $48\,\mathrm{h}$ of milling operations in Hole 504B and $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ of milling operations in Hole 896A, thu s precluding accomplishing any of the scientific objectives of the expedition. We provide an assessment of the final state of the hole s and recommendations for possible future operations.  

# Background  

Hydrothermal circulation in fast- to intermediate-spreading upper oceanic crust impacts the transport of heat from Earth’s interio r and global elemental cycling. Our understanding of these processe s stem in large part from coring and logging operations in a handfu l of archetype reference holes drilled over several decades, includin g Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP)/Ocean Drilling Program (ODP ) Hole 504B, ODP/Integrated Ocean Drilling Program/Internationa l Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Hole 1256D, and Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Holes U1301A, U1301B, U1362A, an d U1362B in the Pacific Ocean. Borehole observatories installed i n some of these holes and in other ocean crust locations have bee n critical for determining fluid flow properties, chemical cycling, an d microbiological impacts in the subseafloor biosphere. Revisitin g such reference holes to advance our knowledge of upper oceani c crust processes with application of more advanced tools is a costeffective leveraging of these important legacy sites. The objective o f Expedition $385\mathrm{T}$ was to revisit two legacy holes on the Costa Ric a Rift flank, Hole 504B and ODP Hole 896A (Figure F1; Table T1), t o further the understanding of the link among mid-ocean ridge to offaxis volcanic crust construction and hydrological, geochemical, an d microbiological processes. This expedition was based on two Ancillary Project Letters (APLs): 769-APL2 (Revealing the in situ crusta l architecture in DSDP/ODP Hole 504B) and 921-APL (Restorin g and sampling ODP Hole 896A for linked crustal, fluid, and biosphere studies).  

# Motivation for examining the in situ crustal architecture in Holes 504B and 896A  

Hole 504B, located on $5.9\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust south of the Costa Rica Rif t in the eastern equatorial Pacific (Figure F1), is one of the best-studied holes in the history of ocean drilling and has been a “referenc e site” for intermediate-spreading upper ocean crust (Becker, 1989; Wheat et al., 1996; Dilek, 1998; Fisher, 1998; Alt and Teagle, 1999; Furnes and Staudigel, 1999; Schouten and Denham, 2000; Chan e t al., 2002; Bach and Edwards, 2003; Johnson and Pruis, 2003; Peucker-Ehrenbrink et al., 2003; Alt and Bach, 2004; Bach et al., 2004). Results from Hole 504B revealed important information on hydrology and chemical flux in the upper ocean lithosphere, includin g heat flow, alteration petrology, and hydrothermal geochemistry an d their implications on the deep biosphere. These results also revealed information on the geophysical characteristics of the uppe r ocean crust, including magnetic and physical properties and seismi c expression.  

Although the core-based downhole lithostratigraphy plays a ke y role in understanding the evolution of both axial and off-axis hydrothermal alteration, it has been a great challenge to derive a reliabl e downhole stratigraphy model of any drilled upper crustal sectio n because of low core recovery rates (typically $<\!30\%$ ). The core recovery rates during a series of drilling expeditions in Hole 504B was n o exception, and currently available Hole 504B downhole lithostratigraphy may be highly erroneous because of (1) biased recovery o f rock, fractures, and alteration types (e.g., loss of highly altered breccia materials and fracture fillings); (2) uncertainty of the in situ location  of  recovered  core  pieces;  and/or  (3)  inconsistent  cor e description criteria on board between several cruises. Consequently, critical elements can be missing in understanding th e crustal accretion process, crustal hydrogeology, crustal alteratio n processes, and changes in physical properties in ocean crust represented by the Hole 504B crust.  

Integrating high-quality wireline logging and recovered cor e data has been proven to provide an important compliment to shipboard lithostratigraphic records, which is the case for archetyp e crustal reference Hole 1256D in superfast-spreading 15 Ma crust o n the Cocos plate (Tominaga et al., 2009). From the Hole 1256D logging data, quasi-2-D resistivity contrast images of the borehole wall, the so-called electrofacies acquired by Formation MicroScanne r (FMS) logging runs, were found particularly useful in decipherin g the detailed crustal architecture with unprecedented resolutio n (i.e., centimeter scale). A volcanostratigraphy model was built b y translating these FMS electrofacies into end-member lava flo w types observed in the modern day East Pacific Rise. The stratigraphy model provides the structure of downhole permeability an d sheds new light on crustal construction processes (Tominaga et al., 2009; Tominaga and Umino, 2010). Hole 1256D logging analyse s demonstrate that unrecovered intervals in drilled basement are permeable structures such as highly fractured sections and breccias. FMS logging in Hole 1256D revealed that nearly $50\%$ of the in sit u architecture is composed of these lithologies; most of them wer e not recovered and hence were never recognized in the shipboar d lithostratigraphy. This discrepancy between shipboard lithostratigraphy and FMS logging results makes it clear that a shipboar d lithostratigraphy in a drilled hole with very low core recovery rate s can lead to erroneous conclusions in critical elements for understanding of the evolution of the oceanic crust and the mechanism o f global chemical fluxes.  

Core-based lithostratigraphy indicates that the crustal architecture in Hole 504B includes a $274.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ pelagic sediment sectio n (cased), a $571.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ volcanic section, a $209\,\mathrm{~m~}$ extrusive–intrusiv e transition zone, and a $1056\;\mathrm{m}$ sheeted dike complex. A full suite o f wireline logging operations was conducted during the last visit t o this site in 1993 (Ayadi et al., 1996, 1998a, 1998b). Although FM S logging was used to characterize physical and electrical propertie s in Hole 504B (Pezard et al., 1996), the existing FMS data have onl y $15\%$ lateral coverage at best because only one FMS run was mad e and one of the four pads failed at the beginning of the logging operation (Figure F2). The overall quality of the existing FMS loggin g data only provides piecemeal intervals of lithofacies imagery an d therefore little detailed crustal architectural resolution. Likewise, the collection of new FMS logs from nearby Hole 896A allows assessment of the lateral extension of lithostratigraphic units in uppe r ocean crust in this archetype intermediate-spreading crust. Moreover, additional FMS logs also enable comparison of the in sit u crustal architecture to interpretations of fluid flow units in Hol e 896A from prior temperature and resistivity logging (Figure F3), which are inferred to connect with various lithostratigraphic unit s (Becker et al., 2004; Haggas et al., 2002).  

With the collection of more accurate downhole lithostratigraphy by multiple FMS logging runs in Hole 504B, we aimed to tes t fundamental hypotheses integral to priorities established in th e IODP Science Plan in Challenge 9 (How are seafloor spreading an d mantle melting linked to ocean crustal architecture?) and Challeng e 10 (What are the mechanism, magnitude, and history of chemica l exchanges between the oceanic crust and seawater?).  

# Motivation for fluid sampling to examine the crustal deep biosphere in Holes 504B and 896A  

The best-characterized subsurface crustal deep biosphere is located on the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank (Edwards et al., 2012; Orcut t and Edwards, 2014; Ramírez et al., 2019). Over a decade of researc h at this site has demonstrated a dynamic and active archaeal, bacterial, and viral biosphere residing in fluids and on rock surfaces i n this ridge flank crustal habitat (Cowen et al., 2003; Orcutt et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2011, 2016; Jungbluth et al., 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017; Lin et al., 2014; Robador et al., 2015, 2016; Baquiran et al., 2016; Nigro et al., 2017; Carr et al., 2019; Ramírez et al., 2019). Although fluid chemistry in this buried ridge flank system has varie d little over time and space (Wheat et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2014), repeated sampling has revealed dynamic changes in microbial community structures. The parameters that drive this diversity ar e unknown.  

Hole 896A on the Costa Rica Rift flank near Hole 504B (Figur e F1), originally drilled in 1993 at ODP Site 678 (Shipboard Scientifi c Party, 1993), represents a unique parallel ridge flank environmen t for comparison to the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank (Table T2). Bot h sites are located on buried basement highs with inferred fluid flo w on the order of hundreds of liters per hour (Becker et al., 2004), an d both sites are characterized by pillow and sheet-flow plagioclase-olivine phyric basalts with alteration products (i.e., saponite and celadonite vein filling) that indicate complex hydrothermal evolutio n of crustal systems (Alt et al., 1996; Hunter et al., 1999). These sediment-covered basalt ridge systems experience similar upper basement fluid conditions (Table T2). Hole 896A has an undefined flui d circulation pathway in the upper crust compared with the Juan d e Fuca Ridge flank, where fluid flow between basement outcrops o n the ridge flank is well constrained (Fisher et al., 2014; Neira et al., 2016). However, both Hole 896A and the boreholes on the Juan d e Fuca Ridge freely discharge formation fluid when the boreholes ar e open to the seafloor.  

Although the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank has been sampled extensively, only one sample has ever been collected for deep biospher e analysis from Hole 896A (Becker et al., 2004; Nigro et al., 2012). I n 2001, a wireline system with a camera documented substantial quantities of flocculent material in open basement deeper than 23 0 meters below seafloor (mbsf) (Figure F3). After this inspection,  a wireline CORK was deployed in the hole. Fifteen months later,  a submersible dive to the site collected biofilms on the borehol e structure that was exposed to discharging formation fluids and bottom currents. Analysis of this sample revealed the presence of biofilm-forming microbial species such as the Gammaproteobacteri a Thiomicrospira. This community was different from the communities observed in the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank environment (Tabl e T2). It is important to note, however, that the biofilm samples previously collected from Hole 896A were collected above the sediment/water  interface  and  represent  a  mixture  of  seawaterinfluenced fluids. Pristine borehole fluids or biofilms have yet to b e recovered from Hole 896A. Thus, a major motivation for fluid sampling in Hole 896A is to collect pristine crustal fluids from variou s depths in the borehole (representing different temperatures [Figur e F3] that span the ${\sim}64^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ temperature range of fluids of the comparison site on the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank) to examine fluid chemistry, microbial biomass density, and microbial community compositio n and function. Collection of these samples would generate data relevant to IODP Science Plan Challenge 5 (What are the origin, composition, and global significance of subseafloor communities?).  

Likewise, determining the temperature limits of the subsurfac e deep biosphere is a major aim of the scientific ocean drilling community (Challenge 6: what are the limits of life in the subseafloor?). Recently, IODP Expedition 370 sought to characterize the thermal limits of life in the organic-rich sediment deep biosphere (Heuer e t al., 2017), but this drilling program did not cross the currentl y known temperature limit of life at $122^{\circ}C$ (Kashefi and Lovley, 2003). Recent studies from Expedition 370 suggest a lower temperature o f life in the subsurface, where other factors, such as nutrient availability, may depress the temperature of life (Heuer et al., 2017). Thus, Hole 504B, which reaches an estimated bottom-hole temperature o f ${\sim}180^{\circ}{-}190^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at $\mathord{\sim}2000$ mbsf (Figure F4; Guerin et al., 1996), is a n ideal setting to test fundamental hypotheses about thermal limits o f life. Moreover, a repeat temperature log in Hole 504B is scientifically important in terms of verifying a no-downhole-flow conditio n and potentially shedding new light on the depth variation of hea t flow after ${\sim}10$ y of hole sealing and would generate data relevant t o IODP Science Plan Challenge 14 (How do fluids link subseafloo r tectonic, thermal, and biogeochemical processes?).  

Currently, the Kuster water sampling tool is the only water sampling device in the R/V JOIDES Resolution downhole tool portfoli o that can operate at high temperatures (i.e., it is a mechanical tool with no electronics), allowing one ${\sim}600~\mathrm{mL}$ fluid sample to be collected per run on the coring line. To improve the ability to collec t larger volume and more frequent fluid samples, a new tool—th e Multi-Temperature Fluid Sampler (MTFS)—was designed and buil t with funding from the US National Science Foundation (NSF ) (award OC-1830087 to C. Geoff Wheat and collaborators). A technical objective of this expedition was to test the performance of thi s tool in furtherance of the science objectives in Hole 504B.  

# Scientific objectives  

# Determining in situ crustal architecture  

Our primary crustal architecture hypothesis is that hydrothermal alteration and mineralization style are spreading-rate dependent (e.g., Hole 504B versus Hole 1256D). We aimed to test thi s through the following objectives:  

• Improve current Hole 504B shipboard lithostratigraphy through collection of multiple FMS logs to reveal hydrogeologically important sections from which core samples were not recovered but are expected to be highly fractured and brecciated sections,   
• Compare the improved FMS-based lithostratigraphy record from Hole 504B with Hole 1256D records to determine whether alteration styles and intensities correlate with differences in their volcanic architecture,   
• Examine whether a new FMS-based lithostratigraphy model changes estimates of global chemical flux from rock-water reactions (e.g., the estimation of $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ uptake by hydrothermal alteration in upper ocean crust), and   
• Determine whether fluid flow in upper oceanic crust correlates with crustal architecture by collecting additional FMS logs in Hole 896A for complementing previously assessed core-log integration based lithostratigraphy and comparing to earlier temperature and resistivity interpretations of flow units.  

# Documenting crustal fluid deep biosphere biogeography  

Our primary crustal deep biosphere hypothesis is that microbia l community structure and functional potential in upper basalti c basement is primarily influenced by fluid geochemical and therma l conditions (i.e., the same species are found everywhere, and the environment selects for them to be dominant). We aimed to examin e this hypothesis with the following objectives:  

• Collect pristine crustal fluid samples and temperature records from multiple depths (temperatures) in Hole 896A for microbiological and geochemical analysis and • Compare Hole 896A crustal fluid microbiology and geochemistry with conditions at the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank sites.  

A secondary crustal deep biosphere hypothesis we aimed to examine is that no microbial life exists above the currently know n temperature limit for life $(122^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . We aimed to examine this hypothesis through the collection of pristine crustal fluid samples an d temperature records in Hole 504B for microbiological and geochemical analyses with samples collected below, at, and above th e known thermal limit of life.  

# Principal results  

# Background and objectives  

Expedition 385T aimed to revisit two DSDP and ODP legac y sites—Holes 504B and 896A on the Costa Rica Rift flank—to advance lithostratigraphic, hydrogeological, and deep biosphere studies of upper oceanic crust. Hole 504B has served as a standar d reference site for upper oceanic crust for decades despite low cor e recovery during drilling operations and incomplete understandin g of downhole lithostratigraphy. Hole 896A serves as an analog site o f crustal alteration for examining biogeography in the crustal dee p biosphere, and fluid sampling in Hole 504B would allow for examination of the thermal limits of life in deep oceanic crust. We aime d to advance lithostratigraphic records of in situ crustal architectur e through FMS logging, with priority for these operations in Hol e 504B. The new logs from Hole 504B would reveal whether unrecovered intervals are highly fractured and/or brecciated and whethe r alteration style and intensity are correlated to volcanic architecture, which would allow for assessment of the hypothesis that hydrothermal alteration and mineralization style are spreading-rate dependent. We also aimed to advance crustal hydrogeological and dee p biosphere research through temperature logging and water sampling in both holes, with priority for these operations in Hole 896A. The new FMS-based lithostratigraphy coupled with new fluid assessment would also allow for improvements on the thermal limit s of microbial life and seawater-basalt reactions. These operations i n Holes 504B and 896A would have direct relevance to Challenges 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14 of the IODP 2013–2023 Science Plan. To achiev e these data and sample recoveries from these legacy sites, existin g wireline observatories installed in both holes would need to be removed. The preexpedition plan was to conduct these operations a s an abbreviated (10 operational days) expedition with no new coring.  

Our primary crustal architecture hypothesis is that hydrothermal alteration and mineralization style are spreading-rate dependent (e.g., Hole 504B versus Hole 1256D). We aimed to test thi s through the following objectives:  

• Improve current Hole 504B shipboard lithostratigraphy through collection of multiple FMS logs to reveal sections that were not recovered but are expected to be highly fractured and brecciated,   
• Compare the improved FMS-based lithostratigraphy record from Hole 504B with Hole 1256D records to determine whether alteration styles and intensities correlate with differences in the volcanic architecture of the oceanic crust,   
• Examine whether a new FMS-based lithostratigraphy model changes estimates of global chemical flux from rock-water reactions (e.g., the estimation of $C O_{2}$ uptake by hydrothermal alteration in upper ocean crust), and   
• Determine whether fluid flow in upper oceanic crust correlates with lithostratigraphy by collecting additional FMS logs in Hole 896A for complementing previously assessed core-log integration based lithostratigraphy and comparing to earlier temperature and resistivity interpretations of flow units.

# Operations  

All times reported in this section are in ship local time. Loca l time was set as follows:  

• UTC − 4 h from 18 August 2019 to $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August, • UTC − 5 h from $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 August to $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 9 September, • UTC − 6 h from $_{0100\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 9 September to $1400\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September, and • UTC $-7\,\mathrm{h}$ from $1300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 September to 16 September.  

After a delay in departure from Antofagasta, Chile, due to customs clearance, the ship completed the $1724\ \mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Hol e 896A in 5.75 days at an average speed of $12.5\;\mathrm{kt}$ , arriving at $1254~\mathrm{h}$ on 25 August 2019. During transit, the science party and JOIDE S Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) technical staff prepared th e new MTFS (Figure F5), the Elevated Temperature Borehole Sond e (ETBS), and two Kuster fluid sampling tools.  

To conduct temperature measurements and fluid sampling i n Holes 504B and 896A, we first had to remove the legacy CORKs installed during the ODP phase. The first bottom-hole assembl y (BHA) was made up and deployed with an overshot tool, followe d by deployment of the subsea camera system. With the drill pipe jus t above the seafloor at 3461 meters below rig floor (mbrf), the Hol e 896A reentry system and wireline CORK frame were quickly located and surveyed before we moved $0.75\ \mathrm{nmi}$ to Hole 504B in dynamic positioning (DP) mode with the subsea camera deployed.  

We arrived at the location of Hole 504B at $0245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 26 August. During the subsequent $4\,\mathrm{{h}}$ , we attempted to capture the short pip e sticking up from the wireline CORK frame with a 6.625 inch diameter overshot tool (Figure F6A). After three unsuccessful attempts t o engage, we decided to recover the drill string. The overshot tool wa s removed, and a three-pronged “fishing” spear, which was fabricate d by JRSO staff for this specific purpose as a backup tool, was attached to the BHA. At $1300\,\mathrm{h},$ , deployment of the drill string bega n while the ship moved back to Hole 896A in DP mode. The spea r successfully penetrated into the CORK frame at $2215\,\mathrm{~h~}$ (Figur e F6B). We pulled the spear with the Hole 896A CORK frame out o f the hole, and to find out how much of the CORK cabling with packers we pulled out of the hole along with the CORK frame, we attempted to lay it all out on the seafloor. A brief investigation of th e seafloor did not reveal either the packer or the lead-in package, although some of the cabling was visible. Because the next step was t o move over to Hole 504B and remove the wireline CORK there, thre e attempts were made to release the Hole 896A CORK frame from th e spear on the seafloor, but the CORK frame remained firmly attached to the fishing spear. At $0300~\mathrm{h}$ on 27 August, we started t o retrieve the drill string with the CORK frame attached (Figure F6C) , and it arrived on deck at $0955\,\mathrm{h}$ . Portions of the CORK frame had t o be cut away to remove the fishing spear. The rig crew removed th e old data logger canisters from the frame, which had all flooded.  

At $1100\,\mathrm{h}$ , we began to lower the drill string with the spear bac k to the seafloor to recover the Hole 504B wireline CORK while th e vessel moved to Hole 504B in DP mode. The CORK frame wa s quickly engaged at $1905\,\mathrm{h}$ . Given our lack of success in getting a visual on the seafloor of the elements below the Hole 896A COR K frame, we decided to pull this CORK frame directly to the rig floo r after offsetting to prevent anything falling back into the hole. Th e spear arrived on deck at $0400~\mathrm{h}$ on 28 August with one bent bar b and without the Hole 504B CORK frame, which must have fallen t o the seafloor after the subsea camera was retrieved.  

Operating under the assumption that the Hole 504B wirelin e CORK had been successfully removed from the hole, we decided t o proceed with the logging and hydrogeologic objectives of the expedition. A logging BHA was deployed to allow deployment of flui d sampling and temperature measurement tools with the coring lin e and the FMS tool with the wireline logging line. An initial seafloo r survey did not locate the lost CORK frame from Hole 504B. We reentered Hole 504B at $1815\,\mathrm{h}$ and soon tagged an obstacle at 19 mbsf, which was the expected depth of the top packer that was deploye d in 2001 (Figure F7). We were not able to push the packer downhol e with the logging BHA, so we pulled out of the hole, clearing the seafloor at $1905\,\mathrm{h}$ . We then moved over to Hole 896A in DP mode an d reentered Hole 896A at $2130~\mathrm{h}$ . As in the previous hole, we tagge d an obstacle at 57 mbsf that was presumed to be a stuck packer (Figure F8). Because we were able to push the packer only $\mathrm{{\sim}}9\;\mathrm{{m}}$ downhole in $0.5~\mathrm{h}$ with 10,000 lb of force, we decided that a milling jo b was needed and retrieved the drill string.  

A new BHA was made up with additional drill collars and a milling bit to remove the packers left in both holes. At $0800~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 9 August, we began lowering the drill pipe while moving the vessel t o Hole 504B in DP mode. After deploying the subsea camera and installing the top drive, we reentered Hole 504B for the second time a t $1550\,\mathrm{h}$ . The packer was again encountered at 19 mbsf. After recovering the subsea camera, we milled and worked the junk basket s with a maximum weight of 20,000 lb and pumped sweeps of highviscosity mud to remove the debris. At $0630~\mathrm{h}$ on 30 August, wit h the milling bit at 70 mbsf and a lack of advance for several hours, w e pulled out of the hole after lowering the subsea camera.  

We thought it was prudent to have a try in Hole 896A while th e milling BHA was in place. We moved over to Hole 896A in D P mode to see if the packer in that hole could be milled and pushe d down more easily. We located Hole 896A and reentered it for th e second time at $1252\,\mathrm{h}$ . The packer was tagged at 66 mbsf. After retrieving the subsea camera, we milled with as much as 20,000 lb o f weight on the packer, which slid from 72 to 88 mbsf. We continue d to mill until $1700~\mathrm{h}$ when we reached 95 mbsf with a diminishin g rate of advance. With $\mathord{\sim}15~\mathrm{h}$ of time on the mill, we decided it wa s time to retrieve and inspect the milling bit and junk baskets. We retrieved the drill string while moving the vessel to Hole 504B in D P mode. The milling bit arrived at the rig floor at $0005\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 Augus t with an estimated $95\%$ of the tungsten carbide missing from th e mill’s face (Figure F9). The junk baskets were emptied, and ${\sim}35$ lb o f packer debris was removed from the two boot-type junk baskets. The debris consisted of a mixture of the Swagelok connectors fro m the top of the packers, steel baffling slats, rubber, and coppe r threads from the cabling, presumably mostly from Hole 504B (Figure F9).  

We made up and deployed a new milling bit assembly and reentered Hole 504B for the third time at $1042\,\mathrm{h}$ . After installing the to p drive and retrieving the subsea camera, we tagged the packer at 7 0 mbsf and began milling, pumping 25 bbl mud sweeps and applyin g a maximum weight of 22,000 lb. At $2330\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , we had advanced to 11 0 mbsf and decided to retrieve the drill string because of the diminishing advance, and the bit arrived on deck at $0615\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 September. The junk baskets were disassembled, emptied, and cleaned, yielding ${\sim}34$ lb of metal debris mostly made up of steel baffling slat s that were part of the central packer.  

We made up and deployed the third milling bit assembly and reentered Hole 504B for the fourth time at $1537~\mathrm{h}$ . Milling resume d from 110 mbsf, and at $0200\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 September, the bit had advance d to 134 mbsf in the casing. With ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{h}$ on the bit, we retrieved the dril l string, and the bit cleared the rig floor at $0900~\mathrm{h}$ . The junk basket s were disassembled, emptied, and cleaned, again yielding ${\sim}35\$ lb o f packer debris mostly made up of steel slats.  

We made up and deployed the fourth milling bit assembly, thi s time with an additional stand of drill collars for additional weigh t instead of the junk baskets, and Hole 504B was reentered for th e fifth time at $2042~\mathrm{h}$ . Milling resumed from 133 mbsf. Rotation wa s stopped several times, and additional weight (as much as 40,000 lb ) was applied in an effort to move the packer down the casing. A t $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 September, we had advanced to 141 mbsf. With ${\sim}13~\mathrm{h}$ on the bit, we retrieved the drill string, and the milling bit cleare d the rig floor at $1910~\mathrm{h}$ . The bit face showed severe wear with thre e concentric patterns thought to be caused by the packer’s lower en d cap (1.5 inch central hole), remains of its casing (4.75–5.75 inch rin g groove), and metal debris outside the bit (honed edge).  

At this point, obtaining downhole temperature measurements, fluid samples, or FMS logs had become impossible in the remainin g time. The only goal left was to keep trying to open Hole 504B fo r potential future use. We made up and deployed the fifth milling bit, this time again with the junk baskets. At $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ , we began to lowe r the drill string to the seafloor, and we deployed the subsea camera a t $0200~\mathrm{h}$ on 4 September. As the camera was lowered, a shorted circuit in the camera system’s slip ring prevented it from being powered, and the camera was retrieved. The milling bit was deployed t o $3425~\mathrm{mbrf},$ and the top drive was installed in anticipation of a successful and timely camera system repair. At $1245~\mathrm{h},$ , we determine d that the camera could not be repaired in time to allow for reentr y into Hole 504B and continue milling operations. The rig cre w started performing rig maintenance and breaking down the 5.5 inc h drill pipe stands for storing on board and offloading in port for inspection. The rig floor was secured for the transit to San Diego, California, which began at $1318\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 September.  

In summary, we spent $48~\mathrm{{h}}$ actively milling the packer in Hol e 504B plus associated pipe trips for the five milling runs and succeeded in removing a significant amount of packer material, 104 l b of which was captured in the BHA junk baskets, and pushing th e packer from 19 to 141 mbsf (Figures F7, F9). Likewise, we spent $2\,\mathrm{{h}}$ on the same activities in Hole 896A and managed to move th e packer from 57 to 95 mbsf (Figure F8).  

# Principal scientific results  

To achieve the science objectives, the Expedition $385\mathrm{T}$ operational plan required removing previously installed wireline CORK s from Holes 504B and 896A, ensuring open hole conditions whil e collecting fluid samples and temperature logs, and conditioning th e hole for logging with the FMS logging tool. The challenge to remov e the wireline CORK packers and related cables from inside the casing in Holes 504B and 896A was a significant operational hurdl e that could not be overcome during the expedition and thus prevented the collection of any samples or data. Operations in Hole s 504B and 896A were concluded without accomplishing any of th e scientific objectives of Expedition 385T.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

The Expedition $385\mathrm{T}$ operational plan required removing previously installed wireline CORKs from Holes 504B and 896A to accomplish our scientific objectives. The challenge to remove th e wireline CORK packers and related cables from casing in Hole s 504B and 896A was a significant operational hurdle that could no t be overcome during the expedition (Table T3) and thus prevente d any sample or data collection activities. Operations in Holes 504 B and 896A were concluded without accomplishing any of the scientific objectives of the expedition. We estimate that part of the uppe r packer in Hole 504B remains stuck at $\mathord{\sim}141$ mbsf (Figure F7) despit e removing at least $104~\mathrm{lb}$ of packer during a total of $48\,\mathrm{h}$ of millin g operations, and it is unknown if the lower lead-in package wit h packer also remains stuck at the presumed deployment depth or fell deeper into the hole. Likewise, we estimate that most of the uppe r packer in Hole 896A remains stuck at 95 mbsf (Figure F8). If futur e attempts are made to try to reenter these holes, we recommen d budgeting several days for milling and including more junk basket s on each milling run.  

# Education and outreach Outreach team  

Expedition 385T had a team of three Outreach Officers o n board JOIDES Resolution, including one Outreach Manager for th e US Science Support Program (USSSP) from New York, one formal educator from Hawaii, and one science communicator from California. The Outreach team took advantage of berth availability; their primary objective was to analyze the status of the Onboar d Outreach Program under NSF’s revised Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).  

The Outreach team’s assessment is based on (1) dialogue wit h the Expedition 385T science party, (2) an examination of JRSO education and outreach evaluations from previous expeditions, an d (3) an analysis of the JOIDES Resolution social media accounts, including insights for the development of a social media strategy an d content plan for the Onboard Outreach position and USSSP-managed social media accounts as a whole. The Outreach team will make this assessment publicly accessible after review. Furthermore, the formal educator of the Outreach team will use the qualitativ e metrics from evaluations and surveys from JRSO and the USSSP office as part of her doctoral thesis project, which will continue postexpedition. The expected outcome from this project will includ e guidelines and expectations for the Outreach Officers.  

In addition to the program assessment, the Outreach team als o assisted the JR Academy students’ science communication coursework. The students were divided into three groups focusing on different  methods  of  science  communication: ship-to-shor e broadcasts, video editing, and 2-D illustration (see JR Academy) . The Outreach team also led a number of seminars on visual communication techniques to improve clarifying messaging and identifying  the  audience  for  conference  posters  and  presentations, including a 2-D poster design, publication-ready scientific illustrations, and resources for selecting a target audience and conveying  a science message appropriate for that audience.  

The Outreach team also conducted the typical duties for outreach officers during a JOIDES Resolution expedition, includin g communicating the goals of the expedition to students and the general public through broadcasts (led by the JR Academy students), social media posts, and blogs via http://joidesresolution.org. Th e Outreach team maintained four social media platforms during th e expedition, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and a web page on th e JOIDES Resolution website, each of which focused on the JR Academy experience, the importance of science communication, and th e diversity of career pathways into the geosciences. In total, thre e ship-to-shore broadcasts took place as part of the JR Academy science communication projects.  

Finally, the science communicator from the Outreach tea m completed a first draft of a book on the history of IODP specific t o Hole 504B. This product will be provided as an introductory companion piece published by USSSP about ocean drilling research an d challenges. Postexpedition, the book draft will be reviewed by th e science party and the Education and Outreach subcommittee of th e US Advisory Committee for Scientific Ocean Drilling (USAC).  

# JR Academy  

The goal of the JR Academy during Expedition 385T was to utilize available berths and the relatively short expedition time (\~ 1 month) as an opportunity to introduce undergraduate student s from diverse backgrounds to IODP-relevant science programs. Th e JR Academy had two instructors, professors from Whatcom Community College (Bellingham, Washington) and Ursinus Colleg e (Collegeville, Pennsylvania). Twelve undergraduate students wer e selected to participate from across the United States through a competitive application process. The students were eligible to receive a s many as 10 (potentially transferable) course credits through Whatcom Community College upon successful completion of two of th e following  courses:  GEOL  100  Introduction  to  Earth  Science, OCEA& 101 Introduction to Oceanography, and/or a learning contract in OCEA 289E Marine Geology with Concentration in Ocea n Processes or OCEA 289E Marine Geology with Concentration i n Geologic Processes.  

JR Academy classes met formally for $^{6\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ a day, 7 days a week, with an occasional required evening activity or late start. During th e expedition, students were exposed to many shipboard resources, including interactions with the shipboard science party, JRSO staff, vessel and drilling operations personnel, and the Outreach team.  A significant part of the JR Academy learning experience was for th e students to engage and develop a research question to investigate, learn strategies to navigate the literature, and apply methods an d equipment available on JOIDES Resolution. The student projects included investigations of petrological, sedimentological, ocean water, and magnetic and physical properties of samples or data. The JRS O technicians supported the work of the students in the laboratorie s by helping the students with the equipment and providing expertise. The students also received feedback from other shipboard scientists and staff members. Each of the 12 students completed thei r research project and presented it at a shipboard poster session a t the end of the expedition to which all shipboard personnel was invited. More than 30 people attended, including all of the shipboar d scientists, JRSO technical staff, the captain, and a number of shi p crew members.  

To learn science communication skills, the JR Academy student s worked closely with the Outreach team through team and individual projects. The final projects included the creation of a ${\sim}5\ \mathrm{min}$ video about JOIDES Resolution, three ship-to-shore broadcasts, an d several 2-D design products, including two posters and two illustrated children’s books. All students wrote a blog related to scienc e and their shipboard experience, and three students took the opportunity to work with the Outreach team to publish their blogs online.
