# Introduction  

This chapter documents the procedures and methods used in the shipboard laboratories during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 356. This introductory section provides a rationale for the site locations and an overview of IODP depth conventions, curatorial procedures, and general core handling/analyses during Expedition 356. Subsequent sections describe specific laboratory procedures and instruments in more detail. This information only applies to shipboard work described in this Proceedings volume; methods used in shore-based analyses of Expedition 356 samples and/or data will be described in various scientific contributions in the open peer-reviewed literature and the Expedition research results section of this volume.  

# Site locations  

The seven Expedition 356 sites (U1458–U1464) are situated along the northwest shelf (NWS) of Australia and comprise a $10^{\circ}$ latitudinal transect that targeted tropical reef and carbonate diachroneity related to Leeuwin Current intensity and Indonesian Throughflow/Indo-Pacific Warm Pool influence, the history of the Australian monsoon, and a detailed temporal record of northern Australian plate dynamic subsidence. Previous work by both academia and industry on the NWS provided site data, including well completion reports, seismic data, wireline logs, cuttings, sidewall cores, and limited engineering cores that were used to guide the initial operations plan for each site.  

GPS coordinates from precruise site surveys and adjacent industry wells were used to position the vessel at all Expedition 356 sites. A SyQuest Bathy 2010 CHIRP subbottom profiler was used to monitor seafloor depth on the approach to each site to confirm the depth profiles from precruise surveys. Once the vessel was positioned at the site coordinates, the thrusters were lowered and a positioning beacon was dropped to the seafloor. Dynamic positioning control of the vessel used navigational input from the GPS and triangulation to the seafloor beacon, weighted by the estimated positional accuracy. The final hole position was the mean position calculated from the GPS data collected over a significant portion of the time the hole was occupied.  

# Coring and drilling operations  

All four standard coring systems, the advanced piston corer (APC), half-length APC (HLAPC), extended core barrel (XCB), and rotary core barrel (RCB), were used during Expedition 356 (see the Operations sections in each site chapter). The APC system was used in the upper portion of a hole to obtain high-quality core. The APC cuts soft-sediment cores with minimal visual coring disturbance relative to other IODP coring systems. After the APC core barrel is lowered through the drill pipe and lands near the bit, the drill pipe is pressured up until the two shear pins that hold the inner barrel attached to the outer barrel fail. The inner barrel then advances into the formation and cuts the core. The driller can detect a successful cut, or “full stroke,” from the pressure gauge on the rig floor.  

APC refusal is conventionally defined in two ways: (1) the piston fails to achieve a complete stroke (as determined from the pump pressure reading) because the formation is too hard, or (2) excessive force $^{\prime}{>}60{,}000$ lb; ${\sim}267\,\mathrm{kN})$ ) is required to pull the core barrel out of the formation. When a full stroke could not be achieved, additional attempts were typically made, and after each attempt the bit was advanced by the core recovery $(\mathbf{m})$ . The number of additional attempts was generally dictated by the recovery length of the partial stroke core and the time available to advance the hole by piston coring.  

Note that this advance-by-recovery method results in a recovery o f ${\sim}100\%$ based on the assumption that the barrel penetrated the formation by the equivalent of the length of core recovered. When  a full or partial stroke was achieved but excessive force could not retrieve the barrel, the core barrel was sometimes “drilled over,” meaning after the inner core barrel was successfully shot into th e formation, the drill bit was advanced to total depth to free the AP C barrel.  

Nonmagnetic core barrels were used during all APC coring to  a pull force of ${\sim}40,\!000\,\mathrm{lb}$ . In general, only the second APC hole fro m any Expedition 356 site was oriented using the Icefield MI-5 orientation tool (see Paleomagnetism) because of the variable nature o f the upper sediments. Formation temperature measurements wer e taken in many of the second APC holes to obtain temperature gradients and heat flow estimates (see Downhole measurements).  

Once APC refusal was reached, or in many cases when the AP C system was unable to be used because the formation was too indurated at the surface (e.g., Site U1460), the HLAPC system was used. The standard APC system contains a $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel, and th e HLAPC system uses a $4.7\;\mathrm{m}$ long core barrel. In most instances, th e HLAPC system was deployed after the APC system reached refusa l to extend the total piston coring depth (e.g., Site U1461). Th e HLAPC system was also employed at a site when the upper sediments or sedimentary layers were too hard to allow a full AP C stroke and too soft for XCB recovery (e.g., Site U1459). During us e of the HLAPC system, the same criteria were applied in terms o f refusal as for the full-length APC system. Use of the HLAPC syste m allowed significantly greater piston coring sampling depths to be attained than would have otherwise been possible and recovery o f more indurated material in the upper sections than possible wit h the APC or XCB systems.  

The XCB was used to advance the hole when APC or HLAP C refusal occurred before the target depth was reached (Site U1461), when the formation became too stiff for HLAPC coring (Sit e U1463), or when hard substrate was encountered in the upper sections of a hole (Sites U1458, U1459, and U1462). The XCB is a rotary system with a small cutting shoe (bit) that extends below th e large APC/XCB bit. The smaller bit can cut a semi-indurated cor e with less torque and fluid circulation than the main bit, optimizin g recovery. The XCB cutting shoe extends ${\sim}30.5\ \mathrm{cm}$ ahead of th e main bit in soft sediment but retracts into the main bit when har d formations are encountered. This system resulted in the greates t loss of core quality (the majority of XCB cores collected during Expedition 356 were biscuited). Because the APC and XCB system s use the same bit, it is possible to switch back and forth between th e two coring systems. As a result, it was occasionally possible to resume HLAPC coring after an interval of XCB coring if the formation became softer beneath a layer of hard material. This wa s successfully used numerous times during Expedition 356 (e.g., Sit e U1459) when alternating hard and soft layers were encountered i n the upper ${\sim}200\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment.  

The bottom-hole assembly (BHA) is the lowermost part of th e drill string. A typical APC/XCB BHA consists of a drill bit (oute r diameter $=11\%$ inches), a bit sub, a seal bore drill collar, a landin g saver sub, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, a nonmagneti c drill collar (for APC/XCB), a number of 8 inch $({\sim}20.32\,\mathrm{cm})$ drill collars, a tapered drill collar, six joints (two stands) of $5\%$ inch $(\mathord{\sim}13.97$ cm) drill pipe, and one crossover sub. A lockable float valve wa s used when downhole logging was planned so that downhole log s could be collected through the bit (e.g., Site U1463).  

The RCB is generally deployed when XCB coring reaches refusa l (generally when the time to cut a core is ${>}90\ \mathrm{min}]$ ), but it was als o used during Expedition 356 as an alternative to the XCB and to duplicate XCB-cored intervals in order to recover cores with reduce d disturbance (biscuiting). The RCB is the most conventional rotar y drilling system. The RCB requires a dedicated RCB BHA and a dedicated RCB drilling bit. The BHA used for RCB coring included a $9\%$ inch RCB drill bit, a mechanical bit release (if logging was considered), a modified head sub, an outer core barrel, a modified top sub, a modified head sub, and 7–10 control length drill collars followe d by a tapered drill collar to the two stands of $5\%$ inch drill pipe. Mos t cored intervals were ${\sim}9.7\mathrm{~m~}$ long, which is the length of a standar d rotary core and approximately the length of a joint of drill pipe. I n some cases, the drill string was drilled or “washed” ahead withou t recovering sediment to advance the drill bit to a target depth to resume core recovery. Such intervals were typically drilled using  a center bit installed within the RCB bit. When coring at many sites, half-cores were sometimes collected with both the XCB (e.g., Sit e U1461) and RCB (e.g., Site U1459) to improve recovery and whe n rates of penetration decreased significantly.  

# Coring disturbance  

Core material has the potential to be disturbed and/or contai n extraneous material as a result of the drilling process, core handling, and analysis. In formations with loose granular layers (e.g., sand, shell hash, coral rubble, etc.), material from intervals higher in th e hole may be washed down by drilling circulation, accumulate at th e bottom of the hole, and then be sampled with the next core. This i s referred to as “fall-in.” In most Expedition 356 cores from the southern sites (U1458, U1459, and U1460), there was evidence of fall-in; when present it affected the upper ${\sim}10{-}50~\mathrm{cm}$ of the cores. Fall-i n was less common in the northern sites (U1461, U1462, U1463, an d U1464). Common coring deformation includes the concave appearance of originally horizontal bedding. Another disturbance type i s “flow-in,” where the piston coring action results in fluidization a t the bottom of the cores. Retrieval from depth to the surface may result in elastic rebound. Gas that is in solution at depth may becom e free and drive core segments within the liner apart. Both elastic rebound and gas pressure can result in a total length for each core tha t is longer than the interval that was cored and thus a calculated recovery ${>}100\%$ . If gas expansion or other coring disturbance result s in a void in any particular core section, the void can be closed b y moving material if very large, stabilized by a foam insert if moderately large, or left as is in the core liner. When gas content is high, pressure must be relieved for safety reasons before the cores are cu t into segments. This is accomplished by drilling holes into the liner, which forces some sediment as well as gas out of the liner. In mor e consolidated material, common core disturbances include biscuiting, where fractured material (“biscuits”) spins within the cor e barrel. In many cases, drilling slurry can be interjected between biscuits. Finally, fracturing, fragmentation, and brecciation as a resul t of the drilling process are also common drilling-induced disturbances.  

Occurrences of these disturbance types are noted and describe d in the Lithostratigraphy sections in each site chapter and are graphically represented on the visual core descriptions (VCDs).  

# Site, hole, core, and sample numbering  

Numbering of the sites, holes, cores, and samples followed standard IODP protocol. Drilling sites have been numbered consecutively from the first site drilled by the Glomar Challenger in 1968, and since Expedition 301 the prefix “U” has been used to designat e sites cored by the R/V JOIDES Resolution. At each site, multipl e holes are often drilled, and a letter suffix distinguishes the hole s drilled at a single site. For example, the first hole would be given th e suffix “A,” the second “B,” and so on.  

Following the hole designation, each recovered core was numbered sequentially. A cored interval is generally ${\sim}9.5\mathrm{~m}_{\mathrm{{]}}}$ , the lengt h of a standard core barrel, with the exception of the $4.7\;\mathrm{m}$ core barre l of the HLAPC system. The specific coring system used to recover  a core is designated by a letter representing the core type and is a suffix to the core number: $\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{APC}$ , $\textrm{F}=$ HLAPC, $\mathrm{\DeltaX=XCB}$ , and $\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{\alpha}$ RCB.  

Each recovered core was cut into ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{m}$ sections. The numbe r of sections is determined by the core recovery, and sections wer e numbered sequentially starting with $^{\ast}1^{\ast}$ at the top of the core. Eac h core is eventually split lengthwise into working and archive halve s (described in Core handling and analysis) designated by either th e letter $\mathbf{\mathcal{W}}^{\prime\prime}$ or “A” succeeding the core number. For depth calculatio n purposes (see Sample depth calculation), the top depth of the cor e is equated with the top depth of the cored interval (in drilling dept h below seafloor [DSF]) to achieve consistency in handling analytica l data derived from the cores. Sample intervals are described in centimeters within a core section (typically between 0 and $150~\mathrm{cm})$ ) beginning from the top of the core section.  

Thus, the full curatorial identifier of a sample consists of the following: expedition, site, hole, core number, core type, section number, section half, and interval in centimeters measured from the to p of the core section. For example, a sample identified as $^{\prime}356-$ U1461D-11R-3W, $50{-}55~\mathrm{cm}^{\prime\prime}$ represents a $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ interval from th e third section (working half) of Core 11R (cored with the RCB system) from Hole D of Site U1461 during Expedition 356 (Figure F1).  

# Sample depth calculation  

During Expedition 356, the cored interval was measured in meters as determined by core depth below seafloor, Method A (CSFA). The calculation of this depth scale is defined by protocol (se e IODP Depth Scales Terminology at http://www.iodp.org/policiesand-guidelines). In general, the depth below seafloor is determine d by subtracting the initial drill pipe measurement to the seafloo r from the total drill pipe measurement (DSF) (Figure F1). For eac h core, the core depth interval begins with the depth below seafloo r where coring began and extends to the depth that coring advanced. However, if a core has incomplete recovery $(<\!100\%)$ , all material i s assumed to originate from the top of the cored interval as a continuous section for curation purposes; thus, the true depth interval within the cored interval is unknown and represents a sampling uncertainty in age-depth analysis or correlation with downhole logging data. In addition, cores from the holes at each of two site s (U1461 and U1463) were correlated to produce a splice based on  a composite  depth scale (core composite depth below seafloo r [CCSF-A]). The calculation of this depth scale is discussed i n Stratigraphic correlation.

Additionally, wireline log depths were calculated from the wireline log depth below seafloor (WSF). When multiple logging passe s were made (see Downhole measurements), the wireline log depth s were matched to one reference pass, creating the wireline lo g matched depth below seafloor (WMSF). These distinctions in nomenclature between core (curated) and wireline log depth should b e noted because the same depth value from different scales does no t necessarily refer to the same stratigraphic interval.  

# Core handling and analysis  

Immediately upon arriving on deck, core catcher samples wer e taken for biostratigraphic analyses. The cores were then cut into 1. 5 m sections, after which whole-round samples were taken for shipboard interstitial water (IW) and noted by the use of a yellow en d cap on the core liner. Additional samples taken on the catwalk include syringe samples for routine hydrocarbon gas safety monitoring (see Geochemistry). Once the core sections were brough t inside, they were immediately run through the Special Task Multisensor Logger (STMSL) by the stratigraphic correlators to aid i n drilling guidance (see Stratigraphic correlation). After the core s equilibrated to laboratory temperature $(\sim\!4\,\mathrm{~h~})$ , they were ru n through the Whole-Round Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) for $P_{-}$ - wave velocity, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and bulk density measurements and also through the Natural Gamma Radiation Logge r (NGRL). Thermal conductivity measurements were also taken (se e Physical properties).  

The core sections were then split lengthwise into archive an d working halves. Oriented pieces of more indurated sediments wer e marked on the bottom with a red wax pencil. The working-half sections were used for taking discrete shipboard samples for paleomagnetic,  physical  properties,  geochemical,  and  thin  sectio n analyses (for details see the individual laboratory group methods i n this chapter), and, in some cases (i.e., Sites U1458, U1459, an d U1460), science party personal samples for postcruise research. Sampling for postcruise research was based on the sampling pla n agreed upon by the science party and the Sample Allocation Committee. Samples for personal postcruise research from all other site s (U1461, U1462, U1463, and U1464) were taken during a samplin g party at the Gulf Coast Repository (College Station, Texas, USA ) from 19 to 26 February 2016.  

The archive half-core sections were run through the Sectio n Half Imaging Logger (SHIL) and the Section Half Multisensor Logger (SHMSL) for color reflectance and point magnetic susceptibilit y (MSP) measurements. The archive halves were described by expedition scientists visually and by smear slide analyses. Finally, most o f the sections were measured with the cryogenic magnetometer (se e Paleomagnetism).  

All instrument data from Expedition 356 were uploaded into th e IODP Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), an d core descriptions were entered into the database using the DESClogik application. DESClogik is a program used to input visua l (macro- and/or microscopic) core descriptions.  

When all shipboard measurements were completed, data uploaded, and samples taken, the cores were wrapped in clear plasti c film, sealed in plastic “D-tubes,” and transferred to cold storage o n the ship. At the end of the expedition, the cores were transported t o the Gulf Coast Repository until the sampling party, after which the y were transported for storage at the IODP Kochi Core Center in Kochi, Japan.

# Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology  

The lithology of sediments recovered during Expedition 35 6 was determined primarily from the archive half of each core usin g visual (macroscopic) core descriptions, smear slides, and thin sections along with additional information from digital core imaging, color reflectance spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Xray fluorescence (XRF), and MS analyses. The procedures and criteria for the visual core descriptions were based on those used durin g Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 194 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002).  

We used the DESClogik application to record and upload descriptive data into the LIMS database (see the DESClogik user guid e at http://iodp.tamu.edu/labs/documentation). DESClogik contains spreadsheet templates with drop-down menus that were customized for the material likely to be recovered during Expeditio n 356 and were modified as needs arose. The completed spreadsheet s record both the visual core descriptions and estimates of the textur e and relative abundances of biogenic and nonbiogenic component s derived from microscopic examination of smear slides and petrographic slides (thin sections). The core depths at which smear slide s and thin sections were taken were recorded in the Sample Maste r application (where the depths are synced with the DESClogik slid e data and descriptions). Descriptive data in the LIMS database wer e used as output to produce VCD sheets, which are standardize d graphic reports (see Core descriptions).  

The standard method of splitting cores into working and archiv e halves (using either a thin wire or a circular saw) can alter the appearance of the split surface and obscure fine details of litholog y and sedimentary structure. When necessary, the cut surface of th e archive half was prepared for unobscured sedimentological examination and digital imaging by gently scraping a freshly cleane d stainless steel or glass plate across the core section and parallel t o bedding  planes  to  prevent  cross-stratigraphic  contamination. Cleaned sections were then described in conjunction with measurements made using the SHIL and SHMSL.  

# Sediment and rock description and classification  

Analyses of rocks and sediments start with recognition, identification, and physical description of individual sedimentary grains, and the resulting suite of grain types and textures is used to classif y the sediments and rocks. Description and classification of sediments and rocks for Expedition 356 followed the decision tree an d classification schema outlined in Figure F2, with detailed definitions and rationale outlined below.  

# Lithification  

Mixtures of sediments and rocks were recovered during Expedition 356, and the degree of lithification was the first feature note d for each lithology. Lithification categories were adapted from th e definitions from Gealy et al. (1971):  

Lithified $=$ rock cannot be scratched or broken without the help of a saw (based on “extreme” and “strong” in Gealy et al. [1971]).   
Partially lithified $=$ hard but friable sediments can be broken easily or scratched with a spatula or fingernail (based on “moderate” and “poor” in Gealy et al. [1971]).   
Unlithified $=$ soft sediments have little strength and are deformed under the pressure of a fingernail or the broad blade of a spatula.  

# Principal lithology  

Sediment and rock units were given principal lithologies base d on their composition and texture. Principal lithologies were divide d into two main categories: (1) ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ carbonate and (2) $>\!50\%$ siliciclastics. Mixtures between these principal categories and othe r components were described using major and minor modifiers.  

# Principal carbonate names  

Carbonates were named using the original Dunham (1962) textural classification in conjunction with the depositional textures o f Embry and Klovan (1971) for allochthonous limestone (rock) o r sediments. Autochthonous carbonates were grouped as boundstones, following the original Dunham (1962) classification. We defined seven principal names (Figure F3):  

Mudstone $=$ mud-supported fabric with ${<}10\%$ grains.   
Wackestone $=$ mud-supported fabric with ${>}10\%$ grains.   
Packstone $=$ grain-supported fabric with intergranular mud.   
Grainstone $=$ grain-supported fabric with no mud.   
Floatstone $=$ matrix-supported fabric (with at least $10\%$ of grains $>2\;\mathrm{mm})$ ).   
Rudstone $=$ grain-supported fabric (with at least $10\%$ of grains $>2\;\mathrm{mm})$ ).   
Boundstone $=$ components organically bound during deposition.  

The “grain” component in these definitions is ${>}20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ mean diameter (i.e., visible by eye or with a hand lens) (Dunham, 1962), th e “mud” component is ${<}20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ (Dunham, 1962), and carbonate mu d was termed micrite.  

To guide macroscopic descriptions, the presence or absence o f micrite was checked on a regular basis by examining the sample un  

Figure F2. Expedition 356 classification schema and decision tree used for entering macroscopic core descriptions into DESClogik and for naming lithologies. Descriptions were classified by primary features (blue shading; in DESClogik menu order) then secondary features (white). Within Principal lithology categorie s of ${>}50\%$ carbonate or ${>}50\%$ siliciclastic, each lithology name used the format major modifier (optional) $^+$ principal name (required) $^+$ minor modifie r (optional). Major and minor modifiers were linked to the principal name with the prefix “rich” and the suffix “with,” respectively (e.g., coral-rich grainstone wit h foraminifers). Carbonate (pink) and siliciclastic (orange) nodes give hierarchy and rules for determining principal name and major and minor modifiers. Principal name is based on texture (Figure F3) or dolomite percent. Major and minor modifiers reflect estimated percentages of major components or presence o f minor components of interest. Fossil components (red dashed lines) were listed in the Fossils category under Other features and were available for use a s major and/or minor modifiers. See text for the Lithification, Other features, and Drilling disturbance description options.

Floatstone and rudstone matrixes may range from mudstone t o grainstone. For example, a sediment with $10~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter rhodoliths with grains in contact with one another and having a skeleta l grainstone matrix is classed as a rudstone.  

Strictly speaking, the Dunham (1962) classification applies onl y to the sorting characteristics in lithified material; however, we als o applied the Dunham (1962) classifications to unlithified carbonat e sediments because the textures of the carbonate rocks and the sediments recovered during Expedition 356 are very similar. The distinction  between  rock  and  sediment  was  noted  under  th e Lithification descriptor.  

Any lithology that appeared to contain more than $\sim\!75\%$ dolomite was called “dolostone.” See Carbonate modifiers below fo r further definitions of dolomite classifications.  

# Carbonate modifiers  

The principal name (e.g., packstone) was often given a prefi x called a “major modifier” (e.g., skeletal) to describe the lithology o f the granular sediments and rocks in greater detail. In some instances the principal name was followed by a suffix or “minor modifier.” All minor modifiers are preceded by the term “with” (e.g., packstone with clay). Major modifiers were primarily used to describe dominant siliciclastic grain sizes (e.g., silty clay), macroscopi c biogenic components, constituent mineralogy, and rock composition. Minor modifiers were mainly used to add greater detail abou t features noted in the core summaries. For simplicity, minor modifiers were used sparingly.  

Carbonate major modifiers (prefix). If the dominant biogeni c component was $>\!25\%$ and could be identified and classified taxonomically, the major modifier specified the dominant fossil type followed by the term “rich” (e.g., coral-rich rudstone). The dominan t fossil type was also specified in the Fossil column in the DESClogi k workbooks.  

Most identifiable nonskeletal grains were either peloids o r ooids. Ooids from this region commonly comprise superficial coatings on a peloid core, which makes macroscopic differentiation between the two clast types difficult. Therefore, the term “nonskeletal grain rich” was used to indicate the occurrence of $>\!25\%$ nonbioclastic allochems. If nonskeletal grains were present but did not excee d $25\%$ , the term “with nonskeletal grains” was applied (i.e., principal name was assigned a minor modifier). In the case where ooids wer e clearly identifiable in either the visual core description or thin sections, the major modifier “ooid rich” or the minor modifier “wit h ooids” was used as appropriate.  

“Dolomitic” was used as a major modifier for sediments containing ${\sim}10\%{-}75\%$ dolomite or dolomitic texture (e.g., dolomiti c packstone). When a unit was dolomitized but it was not possible t o identify the principal carbonate lithology of Dunham (1962), the generic term “limestone” was used as the principal name (e.g., dolomitic limestone).  

Where the siliciclastic component was $\sim\!10\%{-}49\%,$ , various minor modifiers were used (described below). A major siliciclasti c modifier was never used, because if the siliciclastic component wa s ${>}49\%$ , then a siliciclastic “principal name” was assigned instead.  

If the components could not be identified because of their smal l grain size or if they were recrystallized, no major modifiers wer e used.  

The major modifiers described here could also be applied to dolostone.  

Carbonate minor modifiers (suffix). Minor carbonate modifiers were applied after the principal name where $\sim\!10\%{-50\%}$ o f grains were siliciclastics (“with clay,” “with silt,” or “with sand,” depending on grain size [e.g., skeletal wackestone with sand]) or othe r noncarbonatic components (e.g., with anhydrite). Fossil components could also be used as a minor modifier if $-25\%$ but particularly noteworthy.  

Principal siliciclastic lithologies  

Some intervals contained siliciclastic grains of quartz, feldspar , and other minerals eroded from igneous, metamorphic, and noncarbonate sedimentary rocks. When siliciclastic material constituted ${\sqrt{50\%}}$ of the composition, the sediment or rock was deeme d siliciclastic.  

We used three principal names for siliciclastic sediments an d rocks, based on the Udden-Wentworth grain size scale (Wentworth, 1922) (Figure F4):  

Claystone $=>\!50\%$ clay.   
Siltstone $=>\!50\%$ silt.   
Sandstone $=>\!50\%$ sand.  

Siliciclastic major modifiers (prefixes)  

Names for mixed siliciclastic grain sizes follow Shepard (1954 ) (e.g., silty claystone) (Figure F5). If siliciclastic material exceede d $>\!75\%$ , grain size modifiers were not used. Instead, the dominan t mineral was identified and added as a major modifier (e.g., quartzrich sandstone).

Siliciclastic minor modifiers (suffix)  

Minor siliciclastic modifiers were applied after the principa l name where carbonate was ${\sim}10\%{-}50\%$ of the material (e.g., sandstone with coral). Taxonomic minor modifiers were used where th e carbonate component could be identified; otherwise, the generi c terms “with skeletal carbonate,” “with nonskeletal carbonate,” o r “with carbonate” were used.  

Minor modifiers based on grain mineralogy were applied fo r components up to $25\%$ (e.g., sandstone with mica).  

# Other features  

Additional features were used to distinguish between lithologi c units or to describe specific features (see below and Figure F6 fo r examples) of the core.  

# Texture rank  

Principal carbonate lithology was assigned a rank and then plotted on the visual core description to aid visualization of sedimen t and rock texture changes. Carbonates were ranked using the number order given in Principal carbonate names. No texture rank wa s assigned to siliciclastic principal lithologies.  

# Color  

A general description of color in conjunction with other feature s was used as an indicator of changes within and between lithologi c units.  

# Bioturbation  

Five degrees of bioturbation were differentiated, based o n Droser and Bottjer (1986):  

$1=$ bioturbation absent $(0\%)$ .   
$2=$ slight bioturbation $\langle<\!10\%{-}30\%\rangle$ .   
$3=$ moderate bioturbation $(30\%{-}60\%)$ ).   
$4=$ common bioturbation $(60\%{-}90\%)$ ).   
$5=$ complete bioturbation $(>\!90\%)$ ).  

Fossils  

Micro- and macrofossils that either constituted a major component of the total sediment or rock or were noteworthy for other reasons (e.g., as facies indicators and/or index fossils) were recorded.  

Structures and diagenesis  

The location and nature of primary sedimentary structures (e.g. , planar laminations) and deformational structures (e.g., partly cemented fractures) were noted.  

Diagenetic features, especially marine noncarbonate authigeni c minerals such as pyrite, glauconite, phosphate, celesite, and anhydrite, were noted. Glauconite is a black to greenish, iron-rich shee t silicate, which can infill chambers in microfossil tests and pores o r occur as rounded sand-sized grains. Descriptors for dolomitizatio n are discussed in Carbonate modifiers above.  

Layer or bed thickness  

Seven terms for layer and bed thickness were used following th e terminology of McKee and Weir (1953) for sedimentary beds an d laminae:  

Very thickly bedded $=>\!100\,\mathsf{c m}$ Thick bedded $=>\!30{-}100\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
Medium bedded $=>\!10\!-\!30\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
Thin bedded $=>\!3\!-\!10\,\mathrm{cm}$ .   
Very thinly bedded $={>}1{-}3\ \mathrm{cm}$ .   
Thickly laminated $=1{-}0.3\;\mathrm{cm}$ .   
Thinly laminated $=<\!0.3\,\mathrm{cm}$ .  

Lithologic boundaries  

Lithologic boundaries were described by the nature of the contact surface (“bioturbated,” “erosive,” “gradational,” “hardground, ” “scoured,” “sharp,” or “wavy”) and by the angle of the contact (“horizontal,” “subhorizontal,” “subvertical,” “vertical,” and “irregular”).  

Facies  

Four categories of sediments and rocks were based on mineralogy and origin.  

Pelagic facies. Pelagic sediments and rocks consist of finegrained skeletons and skeletal debris produced primarily within th e upper part of the water column in open-marine environments b y calcareous  microfauna  (e.g.,  foraminifers  and  pteropods)  an d microflora (e.g., coccolithophores) and siliceous microfauna (e.g., radiolarians) and microflora (e.g., diatoms).  

Hemipelagic facies. Hemipelagic sediments contain the sam e major components as pelagic sediments with the addition of ${>}10\%$ neritic carbonate and/or siliciclastic material representing transitional facies between pelagic and neritic. Because of the continenta l margin setting and the strong influence of carbonate platform sedimentation at all Expedition 356 sites, virtually all nonneritic sediments were deemed to be hemipelagic.

Neritic facies. Neritic sediments consist of coarse- to finegrained particles originating in shallow-water areas (e.g., inner t o outer ramp) and consisting mostly of skeletal (i.e., bioclastic) carbonate components, nonskeletal grains, and micrite. The term micrite defines very fine calcareous particles $^{\prime}{<}20\ \ \upmu\mathrm{m})$ of variou s origins. Neritic carbonate grains (as described by Tucker an d Wright, 1990) observed during Expedition 356 had two origins:  

Skeletal components $=$ these include the remains of large and small benthic foraminifers, bivalves, bryozoans, coralline algae, corals, echinoderms, gastropods, minor green algae, and planktonic foraminifers; rhodoliths consisting of gravelsized, subspherical nodules of concentrically encrusted coralline algae were also present.   
Nonskeletal components $=$ minor intraclasts and lithoclasts were occasionally encountered; thin sections were used to identify the nature of these nonskeletal components because ooids and peloids were difficult to distinguish by eye in the core.  

Littoral facies. Littoral sediments are deposited close to th e marine shoreline. The term was mainly used during Expedition 35 6 to refer to sediments deposited in the inter- and supratidal zones. These sediments consist mainly of dolostones and dolomitic limestones with solution cavities or surfaces, algal laminites, and evaporitic minerals.  

# Drilling disturbance  

Six types of drilling/coring disturbance were described using th e following terms:  

Fall-in $=$ displaced material from higher in the hole that has fallen downhole onto the top surface of a core.   
Biscuit $=$ sediments of intermediate stiffness showing vertical variations in the degree of disturbance; softer intervals are washed and/or soupy, whereas firmer intervals are relatively undisturbed.   
Fractured $=$ firm sediments broken into pieces that remain in place and may be partly displaced from their original orientation.   
Fragmented $=$ firm sediments broken into pieces that are often displaced or rotated.   
Flow-in $=$ soft-sediment stretching and/or compressional shearing structures attributed to coring/drilling; this can include the presence of coring/drilling slurry; the particular type of deformation may also be noted.   
Soupy $=$ intervals are water saturated and have lost aspects of original bedding.   
Mixed $=$ sediments are entirely or partially homogenized along core (up or down).   
Void $=$ interval with no core material due the coring process (different from a diagenetic dissolution cavity).  

Four relatively subjective terms were used to describe the intensity of disturbance types:  

Slightly disturbed $=$ bedding contacts are only partially deformed or core pieces are broken but in place and kept their original orientation.   
Moderately disturbed $=$ bedding contacts have undergone strong bowing or core pieces are partly displaced from their original orientation.   
Severe $=$ bedding is completely deformed, or some core pieces may not be in correct stratigraphic position and may not represent the entire sequence, and/or original orientation is lost.   
Destroyed $=$ intervals have lost all signs of original bedding, orientation, and stratigraphic position; core pieces are often mixed with drilling slurry; core liner may even be damaged or destroyed.  

# Smear slides  

Smear slides provided information on the composition an d grain size of fine-fraction sediments by giving a semiquantitative estimate of proportions of fine-fraction components. Smear slid e samples were collected from the working half of most cores. At leas t two samples were taken per full core (one for half cores) and wer e co-located with the moisture and density (MAD) samples wher e possible (see Physical properties). For cores with complex lithologies, the dominant lithology was sampled. Additional smear slide s were taken to assist with the classification of grainstones (e.g., confirming the absence of mud) and from areas of interest (e.g., skeleta l carbonates and lithologic changes). Duplicates of cored interval s were sampled for smear slide analysis to assist with the definition o f lithologic boundaries or the correlation of lithologic units betwee n holes.  

Smear slides were prepared either by using a toothpick to collec t a small amount of unlithified sediment or by using a spatula t o scrape material from partially lithified and lithified sediment. Sediments consisting primarily of sand and larger grain sizes were no t sampled for smear slides. The sediment sample was placed on a 2. 5 $\mathrm{cm}\times7.5\:\mathrm{cm}$ glass slide, homogenized with a drop of deionized water, and spread evenly across the slide to create a very thin $\left(<50\;\upmu\mathrm{m}\right)$ , uniform layer of sediment. The slide was placed on a hot plate t o evaporate the water. Once dry, a glass coverslip was fixed to the slid e using a drop of Norland optical adhesive, taking care to avoid trapping air bubbles under the coverslip. Finally, the slide was placed i n a UV light box for ${\sim}15\;\mathrm{min}$ to cure the adhesive.  

Smear slides were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop transmittedlight microscope equipped with a standard eyepiece micromete r and a digital camera. The texture of siliciclastic and carbonate components (relative abundance of sand-, silt-, and clay-sized grains ) and the presence and proportions of biogenic and mineral components were recorded and entered into DESClogik. Grain size definitions follow Wentworth (1922) (Figure F4):  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{Clay}=<\!4\,\upmu\mathrm{m}.}\\ &{\mathrm{Silt}=4\!-\!63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}.}\\ &{\mathrm{Sand}=>\!63\,\upmu\mathrm{m}.}\end{array}
$$  

Micrite in carbonate samples was defined as ${<}20\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ followin g Dunham (1962), to ensure consistent definitions between macro - and microdescriptions.  

Smear slides were used to identify major minerals within a sample. Although smear slide analyses cannot definitively identify all mineral components, they can differentiate quartz, feldspar, mica, calcite (separated into micrite and sparite), dolomite, opaque sulfides and oxides, glauconite, peloids, and ooids. The mineralogy o f clay-sized grains could not be determined from smear slides.  

Smear slides were also used to identify whole and fragmente d microfossils,  including  dinoflagellate  cysts,  diatoms,  silicoflagellates,  radiolarians,  sponge  spicules,  ostracods,  calcareou s nannofossils, echinoid spines, benthic and planktonic foraminifers, algae, bryozoan and mollusk fragments, plant fragments (includin g pollen), and fish debris.  

The relative abundances of minerals and the total fossil conten t were estimated using the visual percentage charts of Rothwell (1989). Note that smear slide analyses tend to underestimate th e amount of sand-sized and larger grains because these grains are difficult to incorporate onto the slide.  

# Thin section petrography  

Thin sections were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan microscop e equipped with a digital camera. Observations were recorded on  a customized spreadsheet and uploaded into the LIMS system.  

# XRD analysis  

XRD analyses were used as a diagnostic tool to identify an d semiquantitatively analyze the relative content of mineral phases i n bulk samples. XRD samples were selected based on visual core observations (e.g., changes in color, lithology, and texture). A $2.5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample was taken. Samples for bulk mineralogy analyses wer e freeze-dried and ground by hand (soft sediment) or in an agate ball mill (rock) as necessary.  

The XRD samples were then top-mounted onto a sample holde r and analyzed using a Bruker ASX D-4 Endeavor X-ray diffractometer mounted with a Vantec-1 detector using nickel-filtered CuKα radiation.  

The standard locked coupled scan was  

Voltage $=40\,\mathrm{kV}$ ,   
Current $=40\;\mathrm{mA}$ ,   
Goniometer s $\mathrm{{can}=4^{\circ}{-}70^{\circ}26}$ , Step $\mathrm{size}=0.0087^{\circ}2\Theta_{\mathrm{z}}$ ,   
Scan speed $=0.2\;{\bf s}/$ step, and Divergence slit $=0.3\;\mathrm{mm}$ .  

The external corundum standard NIST 176 was measured periodically to monitor data quality.  

Diffractograms  of  bulk  samples  were  evaluated  using  th e DIFFRACplus EVA software package, which allowed for mineral identification and basic peak characterization (e.g., baseline removal and maximum peak intensity). Files were created containin g d-spacing values, diffraction angles, and peak intensities with background removed. These files were scanned by the EVA software t o find d-spacing values characteristic of a limited range of minerals.  

Once minerals were identified by their peak heights. $I/I_{\mathrm{corundum}}$ values from the International Centre for Diffraction Data PDF database were used as a semiquantitative measure of their relative percentages. If quartz was present, it was used as an internal standard, and the measured quartz major peak d-spacing was adjusted t o align with the known quartz major peak d-spacing. All other mineral phases were adjusted accordingly. Where dolomite was presen t in a sample, the $\mathrm{MgCO_{3}}$ content of dolomite was calculated base d on the d-value of the [104] peak (Lumsden, 1979).  

Digital files with the diffraction patterns are available from th e LIMS database (http://web.iodp.tamu.edu/LORE/).  

# XRF analysis  

XRF analyses were used to investigate the composition of sediments. XRF was measured with a handheld Thermo-Niton XL3 t $\mathrm{GOLDD+}$ instrument, placed directly at the face of the split core o r selected sample (in situ sampling). The instrument is equipped wit h an $\mathrm{Ag}$ anode and a large-area drift detector for energy-dispersive Xray analysis. The detector is nominally Peltier cooled to $-27^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , which is achieved within $1{-}2\ \mathrm{min}$ after powering up. X-ray range s and corresponding filters were preselected by the instrument software as “light” (e.g., Mg, Al, and Si), “low” (e.g., Ca, K, Ti, Mn, an d Fe), “main” (e.g., Rb, Sr, Y, and $Z\mathbf{r}$ ), and “high” (e.g., Ba and Th). Spectrum acquisition was limited to the main-, low-, and light-energy range $30\;\mathrm{s}$ integration time each) because elements measure d in the high mode were generally near the limit of detection or unreliable. The “Mining” profile uses generator settings of $50\;\mathrm{kV},$ a current of $40\;\mathrm{mA}$ , and a sampling time of $90~\mathrm{s}$ .  

Two factory-set modes for spectrum quantification were pilote d for Hole U1459B samples. Seven samples were run on the “Soil ” profile, which reports measurements in parts per million for the elements Si, K, Ca, Zr, Sr, and Sc. Four samples were measured on th e Mining profile, which includes a fundamental parameter calibratio n that accounts for the matrix effects for the elements analyzed in th e spectrum. The Mining profile reports the elements Si, Al, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zr, Sr, and Sc and was used for Expedition 356 XRF sample s because it reported a wider range of useful elements for diagnosin g sediment composition (based on pilot data).  

Note that for Hole U1459B, the Mining profile results in Tabl e T7 in the Site U1459 chapter (Gallagher et al., 2017) (the pilot data ) were converted to parts per million for comparison with the Soi l profile data.  

# Image logging  

Prior to macroscopic analysis, archive halves of sediment core s were  photographed  using  the  SHIL,  which  is  fitted  with   a CV‑L107CL 3CCD high-speed color line-scan camera. The linescan camera uses three 2048 pixel line sensors mounted on a pris m for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) channels, and it operate s with a $40~\mathrm{MHz}$ pixel clock that allows for a maximum line rate o f 19,047 lines/s. The SHIL is equipped with a mounted lighting system that moves with the camera and is specifically designed to ligh t the surface of section halves evenly and to prevent shadows bein g cast where surfaces are uneven. The SHIL photographs one cor e section at a time, automatically uploading TIF and JPEG files to th e LIMS database. Immediately after scanning, the JPEG file is manually cropped to remove the edges of the core liner, creating a publication-ready photograph. This cropped JPEG is also uploaded to th e LIMS database. Prior to scanning, some section halves were dewatered (i.e., standing water removed by syringe) and/or dried (i.e., dabbed with paper towel) to reduce light reflectance and interference.  

# Spectrophotometry  

Reflectance of visible light from the archive halves of sedimen t cores was measured using an Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrophotometer mounted on the automated SHMSL (see also Physical properties). For Sites U1458–U1463, freshly split soft, wet cores wer e covered with clear plastic wrap and placed on the SHMSL. For Sit e U1464, a measurement issue (not detected for the other sites) aros e because of a discrepancy in the use of the clear plastic wrap. To account for and eliminate this issue, all section halves (both wet an d dry) at Site U1464 were covered in clear plastic wrap prior to bein g measured by the SHMSL. Measurements were taken every $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ to provide a high-resolution stratigraphic record of color variation s for visible wavelengths. Each measurement was recorded in $2~\mathrm{nm}$ wide spectral bands from 380 to $900\ \mathrm{nm}$ . Raw data were automatically normalized by the logger software and reported as three reflectance parameters: lightness $(\mathbb{L}^{*})$ , the ratio of red to gree n reflectance $\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\right)$ , and the ratio of yellow to blue reflectance $\left(\ b^{*}\right)$ .  

The SHMSL takes measurements in empty intervals and ove r intervals where the core surface is well below the level of the cor e liner, but it cannot recognize relatively small cracks, disturbed area s of core, or plastic section dividers. Thus, SHMSL data may contai n spurious measurements that need to be edited from the data set. Any foam spacers in core section halves (indicating voids in recovery or samples removed [e.g., by the paleontology group]) were removed prior to scanning because scanning these spacers also yield s inaccurate measurements. Foam spacers were returned to sectio n halves prior to macroscopic examination. See Balsam et al. (1997, 1998) and Balsam and Damuth (2000) for additional details abou t the measurement and interpretation of spectral data. All data measured by the SHMSL (spectrophotometry and MS) were uploade d to the LIMS database at the time of scanning. MS measurement s were also made on the SHMSL and plotted on VCDs (see below). The MS methods are described in Physical properties.  

# Visual core descriptions  

Ultimately, data from the sediment and rock descriptions wer e compiled into one VCD sheet per core, and these were summarize d for each hole and site to visualize lithologic changes. The core an d hole visual core description summaries were combined with othe r downhole descriptions (e.g., lithification, fossils, structures, an d core recovery) and with data from smear slides, thin sections, XR D and XRF analyses, and the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ image scans. These combine d data were used to define lithologic units and subunits for each site. Visual core description site summary figures were then produce d showing the parameters used to define the main features of lithologic units and to give an overview of the key changes downhole. Information displayed in the VCDs are summarized in Table T1, although not all information is presented in every visual core description hole or site summary figure. VCD symbols are illustrated i n Figures F6 and F7.  

Smear slide description sheets were summarized by hole an d site. The smear slide description summaries show smear slide sample locations in relation to the major lithologic units, grain size estimates, and estimates of the percentages of constituents in the smea r slides. Smear slide summaries are provided in each site chapter, although the parameters selected for display vary among sites, depending on changes in their downhole profile.

# Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology  

Calcareous nannofossils and planktonic and benthic foraminifers were studied in core catcher samples at all sites. Samples fro m core sections were also examined when a more refined age determination was necessary or a significant change in lithostratigraphy occurred. Nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers were used fo r biostratigraphy, and benthic foraminifers were mainly used to acquire estimates of paleobathymetry.  

# Calcareous nannofossils  

Calcareous nannofossil assemblages were examined and described from standard smear slides made from core catcher (CC ) samples at $10{-}20\;\mathrm{m}$ intervals and from mudline samples at each sit e and in multiple holes. Additional toothpick samples were taken between core catcher samples from split-core sections when necessar y to refine the stratigraphic position of bioevents.  

Standard smear slides were made from bulk sediment. In case s of coarse sand or strongly lithified sediments, the sample was suspended in distilled water and sonicated before an aliquot of the suspension was left to settle and dry on a coverslip. Slides were fixe d with Norland optical adhesive and cured under UV light for immediate biostratigraphic examination using a Zeiss Axioscope. Samples were analyzed under (cross) polarized light using oil immersio n at a magnification of $1000\times$ . All photomicrographs were taken usin g a Spot RTS system with the IODP Image Capture and Spot commercial software. Additional observations with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were made to identify Emiliania huxleyi and verify the preservational state of calcareous nannofossils. Th e semiquantitative abundance of all species encountered was described (see below) and notes were taken on the (abiotic) finegrained matrix (e.g., micrite and dolomite grains).  

Nannofossil  taxonomy  followed  Perch-Nielsen  (1985)  an d Young (1998), as compiled in the online Nannotax 3 (http://ina.tmsoc.org/Nannotax3) and the shipboard Nannoware (Bugware, Inc. 2002) databases. The zonal scheme of Martini (1971) was used t o report on the Neogene (NN code) and Paleogene (NP code) calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy (Figure F8; Table T2). This zonation  represents  a  general  framework  for  the  biostratigraphi c classification of middle- to low-latitude nannofossil assemblages. I n addition, we consulted the Neogene zonal schemes of Okada an d Bukry (1980) (CN code) and Backman et al. (2012) (CNPL an d CNM codes) (Figure F8). The CNPL and CNM zonations are base d on numerous high-resolution quantitative nannofossil assemblag e data from low-latitude deep-sea sediments (Backman et al., 2012). Finally, the Paleogene biozonation of Agnini et al. (2014) was consulted for additional biostratigraphic constraints in Hole U1459C. All datum ages used herein are calibrated to the geological timescale of Gradstein et al. (2012) (GTS2012) (Table T2).  

We use base and top, respectively, to describe the stratigraphi c lowest and highest occurrences of nannofossil taxa (Figure F8). Th e base of E. huxleyi denotes the youngest biozone $(<\!0.29\mathrm{{\Ma}}$ ; NN21 ) sampled during Expedition 356. The top of Pseudoemiliania lacunosa $(0.44\,\mathrm{\OmegaMa})$ and the top of Discoaster brouweri $(1.93\,\mathrm{\:Ma})$ bracket the Middle Pleistocene–late early Pleistocene. The biostratigraphic range of Reticulofenestra asanoi $(1.14{-}0.91\ \mathrm{Ma})$ an d the top of Calcidiscus macintyrei $\left(1.6\,\mathrm{\Ma}\right)$ were consistently recorded within this time interval. The Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary $2.58\ \mathrm{Ma}$ ; Gradstein et al., 2012) falls within the top part o f Biozone NN16 and is approximated by the top of Discoaster surculus $\left(2.49\,{\cal M}{\bf a}\right)$ ). The tops of Sphenolithus spp. $\left(3.54\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ and Reticulofenestra pseudoumbilicus $\left(3.7\,\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ were useful datums to correlat e late early Pliocene strata between all the Expedition 356 sites. Th e late Miocene and early Pliocene marker species Amaurolithus an d Ceratolithus were absent or rarely encountered in Expedition 35 6 samples, limiting our nannofossil biostratigraphic constraints fo r the Miocene/Pliocene boundary $.5.3\mathrm{~Ma}$ , within Biozone NN12; Gradstein et al., 2012). However, the top of Discoaster quinqueramus $(5.59\ \mathrm{Ma})$ and the top of Reticulofenestra rotaria (at the Subchron $\mathrm{C3An.ln/C3An.lr}$ reversal  boundary;  compare  Youn g [1998]; $6.252\;\mathrm{Ma})$ (Figure F8) proved useful datums to identify lat e Miocene, Messinian-aged strata (upper part of Biozone NN11).  

The following coding was used in the DESClogik spreadshee t program and uploaded into the LIMS database.  

Total calcareous nannofossil abundance (all codes cf. [A22] ) within the sediment was recorded using the following criteria:  

$\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( ${\tt>}90\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!50\%{-90\%}$ of sediment particles).   
$C={\mathsf{c o m m o n}}$ $\langle>\!10\%{-}50\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $\!\!\:(1\%\!-\!10\%$ of sediment particles).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $1\%$ of sediment particles).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (none present).  

Abundance of individual calcareous nannofossil taxa was recorded using the following criteria:  

$\mathrm{V}=$ very abundant $>\!100$ specimens per field of view [FOV] at $1000\times$ magnification).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant (10–100 specimens per FOV at $1000\times$ magnification).   
$C=$ common (1–9 specimens per FOV at $1000\times$ magnification).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few (1 specimen per 2–10 FOV at $1000\times$ magnification).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare (1 specimen per 11–100 FOV at $1000\times$ magnification).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present (1 specimen per ${>}100$ FOV at $1000\times$ magnification).  

Preservation of calcareous nannofossils was recorded using th e following criteria:  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization, no alteration of primary morphological characteristics, and specimens identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ (little or no evidence of dissolution and/or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics unaltered or only slightly altered, and specimens were identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate (specimens exhibit some etching and/or recrystallization, primary morphological characteristics somewhat altered, and most specimens were identifiable to the species level).   
$\mathbb{P}=\mathbb{p}00\mathbb{r}$ (specimens were severely etched or overgrown, primary morphological characteristics largely destroyed, fragmentation has occurred, and specimens often could not be identified at the species and/or generic level).  

# Foraminifers  

Core catcher and mudline samples were prepared and analyze d for benthic and planktonic foraminifers. Core catcher samples of $^{5-}$ $10~\mathrm{{cm}^{3}}$ were soaked in a hydrogen peroxide solution $(30\%)$ whe n necessary, heated on a hot plate $(\mathrm{\sim}90^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ , and washed over 63 an d $150~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mesh sieves. Lithified samples were gently broken with  a

hammer. All samples were oven-dried at $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , and the dried samples were transferred to labeled glass vials. When a significan t amount of coarse material was present, an additional $2~\mathrm{mm}$ mes h sieve was used. This fraction was described separately. The $63\ \upmu\mathrm{m}$ fraction  was  retained  for  additional  observation  for  paleobathymetric indicators. Cross contamination between samples wa s avoided by ultrasonically cleaning sieves between samples. In addition, mudline samples from each hole were analyzed for planktoni c and benthic foraminifers. Mudline samples were collected by emptying the sediment/water from the top core liner of each hole into  a bucket and then washed with tap water over 63 and $150~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ mes h sieves. Rose bengal was added to identify the presence of recentl y living foraminifers. After several days soaking in rose bengal, th e samples were treated similarly to the core catcher samples. Th e ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction was split into suitable aliquots and then examined under a Zeiss Discovery V8 microscope. Foraminifers wer e identified using a Zeiss microscope equipped with a Spot RTS system with the IODP Image Capture and Spot commercial softwar e for taking photomicrographs. An SEM was used for acquiring characteristic images of specific species and to assess the state of preservation of the foraminifers.  

# Planktonic foraminifers  

Planktonic foraminifers were identified following the taxonom y of Kennett and Srinivasan (1983), Bolli and Saunders (1985), an d Saito et al. (1981). The planktonic foraminifer zonation schemes o f Blow (1969, 1979) and Berggren et al. (1995), as modified by Wad e et al. (2011), were used. Calibrated ages for bioevents are fro m Gradstein et al. (2012) and Wade et al. (2011) (Figure F8; Table T3). Eocene foraminifers (Hole U1459C) were identified following Pearson et al. (2006).  

Individual planktonic foraminifers were recorded in qualitativ e terms based on an assessment of forms observed in a random sample of ${\sim}100$ specimens from the ${>}150\,\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction. Both the relative  amounts  of  planktonic  versus  benthic  and  planktoni c foraminifer contribution to the total sample were recorded. The total abundance of planktonic foraminifer species within the assemblage was defined as follows:  

$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $(>\!30\%$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
$C=$ common $\langle>\!10\%{-30\%}$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $\langle5\%{-}10\%$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $.1\%{-5\%}$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
${\mathrm{VR}}=$ very rare ( $1\%$ planktonic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
$\mathbf{B}=\,$ barren (no planktonic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).  

Preservation of planktonic foraminifer assemblages was recorded as follows:  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (no evidence of breakage or dissolution).   
$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ $580\%$ of specimens unbroken with only minor evidence of diagenetic alteration).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate $(30\%{-}80\%$ of the specimens unbroken).   
$\Gamma={\mathsf{p o o r}}$ (strongly recrystallized or dominated by fragments and broken or corroded specimens).

Tappan (1988) was used in combination with Sen Gupta (1999), an d name validity was confirmed using the World Foraminifera Database (Hayward et al., 2015).  

Individual benthic and planktonic foraminifers were recorded t o determine assemblage composition and paleodepth estimates i n qualitative terms. This was done by counting foraminifers in a random sample of ${\sim}100$ specimens from the ${>}150~\upmu\mathrm{m}$ size fraction. Both the relative amount of benthic versus planktonic and benthi c foraminifer contribution to the total sample were recorded.  

Paleobathymetric estimates were based on dominant species i n benthic assemblages. Modern shelfal foraminiferal assemblages o n Australia’s continental margin are similar to Pliocene–Pleistocen e assemblages and can therefore be used as modern analogs for paleodepth and paleonutrient interpretations (Li et al., 1996a, 1996b; Gallagher et al., 1999; Smith et al., 2001; Smith and Gallagher, 2003). Similarly, modern benthic foraminiferal assemblage analog dat a from the region may be used for this purpose, including Sunda shel f from $5^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ to $10^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$ (Biswas, 1976), Banda Sea and Timor Troug h from $5^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $10^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (van Marle, 1988), Sahul shelf and Timor Sea fro m $8^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ to $14^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Loeblich and Tappan, 1994), Exmouth Gulf at $22^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Haig, 1997; Orpin et al., 1999), Ningaloo Reef at $24^{\circ}29^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ (Parker, 2009), and the western Australian continental shelf from $20^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ t o $34^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Li et al., 1999; Betjeman, 1969; Quilty, 1977). These distributions are supplemented with data from the Indonesian archipelag o (Szarek et al., 2006), Ontong Java Plateau (Hermelin, 1989), an d broader Indo-Pacific syntheses (Gallagher et al., 2009). A summar y of the depth distribution of key nonlarger foraminifers from thes e papers is compiled in Figure F9. These analog data may be enhanced with paleodepth estimates from larger foraminiferal distribution (Renema, 2006; James et al., 1999; Hohenegger, 1995, 2005; Langer and Hottinger, 2000). Paleobathymetric estimates were classified as inner shelf $^{7}0{-}50\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth), middle shelf $(50{-}100\,\mathrm{m})$ , outer shelf $\left(100{-}200\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ ), and upper bathyal (200 to ${>}400\;\mathrm{m}$ ).  

The percentage of planktonic foraminifers in total assemblag e $(\%)$ data can also be used to estimate paleodepths (van der Zwaa n et al., 1990) and has been used to obtain paleobathymetric estimate s prior to backstripping and generation of subsidence curves (va n Hinsbergen et al., 2005; Gallagher et al., 2013). The error on paleodepth estimates increases with increasing $\%\mathrm{{P}.}$ Van der Zwaan e t al. (1990) determined the $90\%$ confidence limit on a single $\%\mathrm{P}$ valu e of $50\%$ planktonic specimens $430\;\mathrm{m}$ paleodepth) was $100{-}150\ \mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , and the error on a $99\%$ value ( $1200\,\mathrm{~m~}$ paleodepth) was approximately $400\:\mathrm{m}$ .  

The relative abundance of foraminifer species in analyzed samples $(>\!150\;\upmu\mathrm{m})$ were estimated as follows:  

$\mathrm{D}=$ dominant ( $>\!30\%$ benthic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
$\mathrm{A}=$ abundant $\langle>\!10\%{-30\%}$ benthic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
$\mathrm{F}=$ few $(>\!5\%{-}10\%$ benthic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
${\mathbb R}=$ rare $.1\%{-5\%}$ benthic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).   
$\mathbf{P}=$ present ( $1\%$ benthic foraminifer specimens in total assemblage).  

Paleobathymetric zones were estimated via isolating the mos t dominant/abundant species in each sample and associating the m with established zones (Li et al., 1996a, 1996b; Smith et al., 2001; Smith and Gallagher, 2003) (Figure F9). These zones include the following:  

$\mathbf{P}=$ photic zone.   
$\mathrm{IS}=$ inner shelf.   
${\bf M}{\bf S}={\bf\Psi}$ middle shelf.   
$\mathrm{OS}=$ outer shelf.   
$\mathrm{UB}=$ upper bathyal.  

The degree of preservation of the benthic foraminifers $(>\!150$ $\upmu\mathrm{m})$ , describing the degree of test breakage and surficial damage, was estimated as follows:  

$\mathsf{V G}=$ very good (no evidence of breakage or dissolution).   
$\mathrm{G}=\mathrm{good}$ $580\%$ of specimens unbroken with only minor evidence of diagenetic alteration).   
$\mathbf{M}=$ moderate $30\%{-}80\%$ of the specimens unbroken).   
$\Gamma={\mathsf{p o o r}}$ (strongly recrystallized or dominated by fragments and broken or corroded specimens).  

# Additional microfossil groups  

In addition to the detailed analyses of nannofossils and foraminifers, the samples were scanned for the presence of other microfossil groups. These groups include pteropods, ostracods, bryozoans, mollusks, and sponge spicules. Notable and/or dominant occurrences of specific groups were also documented.

# Geochemistry  

The shipboard geochemistry program for Expedition 356 included measurements for  

• Headspace gas content;   
• IW composition, including pH, alkalinity, salinity, and major and minor elements; and  

• Bulk sediment geochemistry, including total inorganic carbon (TIC), total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN).  

These analyses were carried out to satisfy routine shipboar d safety, characterize IW and sediment geochemistry for shipboar d interpretation, and provide a basis for sampling for shore-based research. The geochemistry methods used during Expedition 356 ar e generally similar to those used during other recent IODP expeditions.  

# Interstitial water geochemistry  

# Sample collection  

Routine IW samples were obtained by squeezing whole-roun d sections cut from cores. Standard whole-round samples were $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ long, but as water content decreased downhole, the size of th e whole-round samples was increased to up to $15~\mathrm{cm}$ to enable extraction of the $\sim\!15~\mathrm{mL}$ of water needed for shipboard and shorebased analyses. Whole-round samples were cut and capped a s quickly as possible after the core arrived on deck and immediatel y moved to the chemistry laboratory for squeezing. Whole-roun d samples were collected at a frequency of 1 sample per core for Hol e A or the first hole at a site cored to a significant depth, which i n some cases (e.g., Site U1463) was Hole B. Whole-round sample s were also collected at a frequency of 1 sample every third core fo r subsequent holes, starting at the depth below that covered in previous holes. The exterior of the whole-round sample was carefull y cleaned with a spatula to remove potential contamination by drilling fluid. For XCB cores, the intruded drilling mud between biscuit s was also removed to eliminate contamination from drilling fluid. The cleaned sediment was placed into a $9\ \mathrm{cm}$ diameter titaniu m squeezer that was then placed in a Carver hydraulic press (Manheim and Sayles, 1974) and squeezed at pressures no higher tha n 25,000 lb $\left({\sim}17\ \mathrm{MPa}\right)$ to prevent the release of interlayer water fro m clay minerals. The squeezed IW was collected into a $60~\mathrm{mL}$ deionized water–washed $(18~\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm})$ high-density polyethylene syring e attached to the squeezing assembly and subsequently filtere d through a $0.45~{\upmu\mathrm{m}}$ polyethersulfone membrane filter into variou s sample containers.  

Sample allocation was determined based on the pore fluid volume obtained and analytical priorities of the expedition. Aliquot s for alkalinity, $\mathsf{p H},$ salinity, ammonia, and phosphate analyses wer e placed in $^\mathrm{8~mL}$ glass vials. Aliquots for major and minor elemen t concentration  analyses  by  inductively  coupled  plasma–atomi c emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) were acidified by adding ${\sim}10~\upmu\mathrm{L}$ of trace metal–grade concentrated $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and placed in $5\;\mathrm{mL}$ cryovials. Remaining IW was put in $40~\mathrm{mL}$ glass vials and kept for postcruise sample analyses. Samples were stored at $4^{\circ}C$ after collection.  

After IW extraction was complete, sediment squeeze cakes wer e divided and sealed in plastic bags for shipboard and shore-base d analyses and stored at $4^{\circ}C$ .  

# Interstitial water analyses  

IW samples were analyzed on board the ship following the protocols in Gieskes et al. (1991), Murray et al. (2000), and the IOD P user manuals for shipboard instrumentation.  

Salinity, alkalinity, and $\mathsf{p H}$ were measured immediately afte r squeezing, following the procedures in Gieskes et al. (1991). Salinit y was measured using a Fisher temperature-compensated handhel d refractometer, pH was measured with a combined glass electrode, and alkalinity was determined by Gran titration with an autotitrato r (Metrohm 794 basic Titrino) using $0.1\;\mathrm{M}\;\mathrm{HCl}$ at $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}.$ Internationa l Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans (IAPSO) standard seawater was used as a standard to check for instrument drif t every 20 samples. Alkalinity titrations had a precision better tha n $5\%$ based on repeated analysis of IAPSO standard seawater.  

Dissolved major and minor elements were determined by Leeman ICP-AES. For major cation $\left(\mathbf{Na}^{+}.\right)$ , $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , $C a^{2+}$ , and $\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ) analyses, dilutions of IAPSO standard seawater were used as calibration standards. Standards and acidified samples were diluted $1{:}100\;(\mathrm{v/v})$ wit h a $2\%\,\mathrm{HNO_{3}}$ (by volume) solution (matrix) with $10\,\mathrm{ppm}$ yttrium (Y )  

as an internal standard. Calibration for minor elements $(\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ , B, Si, $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ , and $\mathrm{Li^{+}}$ ) was done with dilutions of a multielemen t synthetic standard solution (composed of single-element standards). Acidified samples measured for minor elements on the ICPAES were diluted $1{:}20\,\left(\mathbf{v}/\mathbf{v}\right)$ with the same matrix used for the majo r element analysis. Drift correction was made for both major and minor elements using the factor from a drift monitor solution ( $100\%$ IAPSO for major elements and $100\%$ stock solution for minor elements) that was analyzed every eight samples. The ICP-AES autosampler and analysis chamber were rinsed with a $3\%$ (by volume ) $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution between samples. Major cations $(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{g}^{2+}$ , $C\mathbf{a}^{2+}$ , $\mathrm{K^{+}}$ , and $\mathrm{Na^{+}}$ ) were also determined by ion chromatography (IC) at 1:10 0 dilutions.  

For $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ and $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ , colorimetric methods were applied. Ammonium adsorption of indophenol blue at $640~\mathrm{nm}$ wavelength wa s measured with a spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies UVVis), with an aliquot of $100\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ IW used as minimum volume. Blan k and 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, and $3000~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ standard solutions were prepared in the same manner as th e sample solutions and analyzed within $^{5\,\mathrm{h}}$ . Phosphate (an aliquot o f $600\,\upmu\mathrm{L}$ IW) was analyzed using adsorption of molybdate blue at 88 5 nm wavelength with the spectrophotometer used for $\mathrm{NH_{4}}^{+}$ . Blan k and 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, and $300\ \upmu\mathrm{M}\ \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{\ 3-}$ standar d solutions were prepared in the same manner as that of the sampl e solutions. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) of repeated analyse s of both components are within $2\%{-5\%}$ .  

# Organic geochemistry  

# Headspace gas analysis  

A $5\;\mathrm{{cm}}^{3}$ sediment sample from each core was collected immediately after retrieval on deck and placed in a $20\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ glass vial, whic h was sealed with a septum and a crimped metal cap. When consolidated or lithified samples were encountered, chips of material wer e placed in the vial and sealed. If an IW sample was obtained, th e headspace sample was taken from the top of the section immediately next to it whenever possible. The sample was then placed in a n oven at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $30\,\mathrm{\min}$ . A $5~\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ volume of gas was extracte d through the septum with a gas-tight glass syringe and injected int o a gas chromatograph (GC).  

An Agilent/HP 6890 series II GC (GC3) equipped with a flam e ionization detector (FID) was used to measure the concentrations o f methane $\left(C_{1}\right)$ , ethane $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , ethylene $\left(C_{2}\right)$ , propane $\left(C_{3}\right)$ , and propylene $\left(C_{3}\right)$ . A $2.4\mathrm{~m~}\times\,2.0\mathrm{~mm}$ (inner diameter) Restek stainless steel column packed with 80/100 mesh HayeSep “R” was used. $\mathrm{~A~}\%_{6}$ inc h Valco union with a $7\;\upmu\mathrm{m}$ screen connected to a Valco-to-Luer loc k syringe adaptor was used as the injector, which connected to a 1 0 port Valco valve that was switched pneumatically by a digital valv e interface. The injector temperature was set at $120^{\circ}C$ . The GC3 ove n temperature was programmed to start at $80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , hold for $8.25\ \mathrm{min}$ , and then ramped at $40^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{min}$ to a final temperature of $150^{\circ}C$ , whic h was held for $5~\mathrm{min}$ . Helium was used as the carrier gas. The FI D temperature was set at $250^{\circ}C$ .  

# Bulk sediment geochemistry  

Sediment samples were collected from the IW squeeze cakes fo r inorganic and organic carbon analyses. In a few cases, residues fro m MAD samples (see Physical properties) were analyzed when th e sediment type did not allow for IW sampling. Samples were freezedried for ${\sim}24\,\mathrm{h}$ , crushed using an agate pestle and mortar, and the n analyzed for total carbon (TC), TIC, and TN.  

TC and TN of the sediment samples were determined with  a ThermoElectron Corporation FlashEA 1112 CHNS elemental analyzer (EA) equipped with a ThermoElectron packed colum n CHNS/NCS GC and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Approximately $10{-}15~\mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighed into a tin cup an d then combusted at $950^{\circ}C$ in a stream of oxygen. The reaction gase s were passed through a reduction chamber to reduce $\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and were then separated by th e Thermo CHNS/NCS multiseparation column before detection b y TCD. All measurements were calibrated to a standard (Soil Reference Material NC [PN 33840025]), which was run every 10 samples. Peak areas from the TCD were calculated to determine TC and T N of the samples.  

TIC was determined using a Coulometrics $5015\,\,\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ coulometer. Approximately $10{-}12\ \mathrm{mg}$ of sediment was weighed into  a glass vial and acidified with 2 M HCl. The liberated $C O_{2}$ was titrated, and the corresponding change in light transmittance in th e coulometric cell was monitored using a photodetection cell. Th e weight percent of calcium carbonate was calculated from the inorganic carbon content using the following equation:  

$$
\mathrm{CaCO_{3}\left(w t\%\right)=T I C\times8.33\;(w t\%).}
$$  

No correction was made for the presence of other carbonat e minerals. A standard of pure $(100\;\mathrm{wt}\%)$ ) $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$ was analyzed ever y 10 samples and used to confirm accuracy. TOC was calculated a s the difference between TIC (measured by coulometry) and T C (measured by EA):  

$$
\mathrm{TOC}=\mathrm{TC}-\mathrm{TIC}.
$$  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic data acquisition focused on natural remanen t magnetization (NRM) measurements and alternating field (AF) demagnetization of archive-half core sections and discrete cube samples. Discrete cube samples were taken from selected workin g halves and subjected to more comprehensive NRM measurement s than archive-half sections. Bulk susceptibility and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) were also measured, along with backfiel d IRM on discrete samples when time allowed. Rock magnetism dat a from discrete sample measurements were used to modify AF demagnetization steps of the archive-half sections if necessary and t o augment magnetostratigraphic interpretations.  

# Magnetic measurements  

Remanent magnetization was measured using a 2G superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) (2G Enterprises Mode l 760R) equipped with direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (DC-SQUIDs) and an in-line automated AF demagnetizer.  Sediment  cores  generally  carry  components  o f secondary remanence (overprints), including natural viscous remanence and a steep downward-pointing component attributed to th e drill string. To separate the overprints from the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM), stepwise demagnetization experiments were performed, as described below.  

# Archive-half sections  

Measurements of archive halves were conducted using the software SRM (version 1.0), set up for section measurements, with  a nominal sample-area parameter of $15.59\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ . The measurement interval and speed were $10~\mathrm{{cm}}$ and $10~\mathrm{cm/s}$ , respectively. The response functions of the pick-up coils of the DC-SQUID sensor s have a full width of $7{-}8\ \mathrm{cm}$ at half height (Parker and Gee, 2002). Therefore, data collected within ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{cm}$ of section ends (or voids) ar e significantly affected by edge effects. Consequently, all data point s within $4.5\,\mathrm{cm}$ of voids (as documented in the curatorial record) or  8 cm of section ends were either filtered out of the data before analysis or treated with caution. It should be noted that edge effects ma y also occur in a contiguous core piece if substantial heterogeneity (i n intensity or direction) is present in the piece. It is more difficult t o filter out such artifacts, but calculating the average ChRM directions for each core piece could provide a means of identifying thes e problems (Expedition 330 Scientists, 2012).  

For all archive-half core sections, we performed NRM measurements with stepwise AF demagnetization by using the in-line A F demagnetizer of the SRM. The in-line AF demagnetizer applies  a field to the $x-,y-$ -, and $z_{\mathrm{:}}$ -axes of the SRM in this fixed order. For mos t of the core sections, we performed demagnetization steps fro m NRM $\left(0\;\mathrm{mT}\right)$ to 20 or $30\;\mathrm{mT}$ The AF demagnetization results wer e plotted individually as orthogonal diagrams (Zijderveld, 1967) an d collectively as downhole variations with depth. When time allowed, the archive-half core section data were evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA) (Kirschvink, 1980). Otherwise, we inspecte d the plots visually to judge whether the remanence after demagnetization at the highest AF step reflects the ChRM and geomagneti c polarity sequence.  

# Technical difficulties with archive-half measurements  

The y-axis SQUID sensor on the SRM experienced frequent flu x jumps while measuring archive-half sections at Sites U1459 an d U1460, with a significant increase in frequency during measurements at the top of Hole U1461C. Flux jumps affected only the $y.$ - axis and sometimes occurred during each step of a section measurement (equivalent to at least one flux jump per $10\ \mathrm{min}$ ). Remanen t magnetizations calculated from data affected by flux jumps produced invariable values for inclination (near $0^{\circ}$ ), declination (nea r $270^{\circ})$ , and magnetic intensity (that increased linearly downcore i n each section half). Manual and magnetic cleaning of the tray an d track were carried out in an attempt to remedy the problem. Finetuning of the $y$ -axis SQUID meter seemed to stabilize the SRM, an d flux jumps became less frequent.  

Flux jumps on the $y$ -axis were described during Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 342 (Norris et al., 2014). The y refer to this occurrence as the “antennae” effect and attribute it t o stray magnetic flux being channeled into the magnetometer-sensin g region. Similar to Expedition 356 experience, Expedition 342 paleomagnetists also measured sections containing wet carbonate an d saw an increase in flux jumps during rough seas. They also foun d that an unshielded cable near the degausser contributed to the antennae effect, but no unshielded cables were identified during Expedition 356.  

After noticing the jumps in flux, the $y$ -axis SQUID meter wa s regularly checked and fine-tuned, especially during rough seas. Flu x jump occurrences were much less frequent at Sites U1462, U1463, and U1464 but still occurred occasionally. Section data that were affected during the highest demagnetization step, which are used fo r magnetostratigraphic interpretation, were corrected by restartin g the section measurement as another NRM step. The second NR M step is then used instead of the affected demagnetization step fo r data plotting and interpretation.  

# Discrete samples  

Oriented discrete samples representative of the lithology wer e collected from working-half sections. For soft sediments, discret e samples were taken in plastic “Japanese” Natsuhara-Giken samplin g cubes ( $7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ sample volume). Cubes were manually pushed into th e working half of the core and an “up” arrow pointing upsection in th e core drawn on the cube. For indurated intervals of the core, oriented cubes $({\sim}6{-}7\,\mathrm{cm}^{3})$ were cut with a table saw and trimmed to fi t in the plastic JR-6A semiautomatic holder.  

A suite of discrete samples were selected and subjected to stepwise AF demagnetization in order to (1) characterize typical intervals, (2) better resolve magnetostratigraphy, and (3) determin e whether a ChRM could be resolved, and if so, what level of demagnetization was required to resolve the ChRM. At the beginning o f Expedition 356, a few instances of slow core flow allowed us to us e the SRM for pass-through discrete sample measurements. Fo r these, we used the in-line AF demagnetizer, controlled by the SR M (version 1.0) software, to demagnetize the samples in $10~\mathrm{mT}$ step s up to $80\,\mathrm{mT}$ . Specimens were placed on a discrete sample tray in th e “top-away” orientation (arrow on top of the cube pointing awa y from the body of the SRM). Adjacent samples were separated by 2 0 cm to avoid convolution effect of the SRM sensor responses. Software bugs, core flow, and other difficulties lead us to use the spinne r magnetometer (AGICO Model JR-6A) for the rest of Expeditio n 356. We used the JR-6A spinner magnetometer and an AF demagnetizer, Model D-2000 (ASC Scientific), for remanence and demagnetization measurements. Measurements were performed in step s of $10{-}20~\mathrm{mT}$ up to peak field of $80{-}120~\mathrm{mT}$ (majority of samples ) and $160{-}180~\mathrm{mT}$ (high-coercivity samples).  

We analyzed the stepwise demagnetization data of the discret e samples by PCA to define the ChRM. Section-half and discrete dat a collected on the pass-through SRM were uploaded automatically t o the LIMS database. Discrete data collected from the SRM and JR6A spinner magnetometer were analyzed in Remasoft (version 3.0; AGICO, Inc.) and Puffin Plot (version 1.03; Lurcock and Wilson, 2012), depending on the output file of the instrument.  

Low-field MS of both whole rounds (see Physical properties ) and section halves (see Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology an d Physical properties) was routinely measured to estimate the concentration of ferromagnetic (sensu stricto) minerals. Volume-normalized, calibrated bulk susceptibility $(\upchi)$ measurements were mad e on an AGICO KLY 4 Kappabridge instrument operating at low alternating induction magnetic field values ( ${\sim}10~\mathrm{kHz}$ at a field valu e of $0.7~\mathrm{mT}$ ). Measurements were carried out with the SUFAR software (AGICO, Inc.).  

IRM inquisition measurements were used to obtain informatio n on the magnetic mineralogy content, as well as for quantification o f the components of magnetic coercivity. Selected discrete specimen s that underwent AF demagnetization over the $100~\mathrm{{mT}}$ step wer e subsequently subjected to progressive stepwise magnetic field s from 0 to $1200\,\mathrm{mT}$ using an Impulse magnetizer (ASC Model IM10 ) with the orientation arrows on the top of the cube pointing out o f the body of the instrument. These measurements provide information such as the saturation IRM (SIRM) and coercivity of remanence. Induced magnetization was measured with the JR-6 A spinner magnetometer. A backfield IRM was then imparted in th e same manner, except the orientation arrows on the top of the cube s pointed into the body of the instrument. In some special cases, suc h as for discrete samples from Sites U1459 and U1460, IRM acquisition curves were modeled using cumulative log analysis as discussed in Kruiver et al. (2001). Furthermore, some samples tha t were used for IRM analysis underwent stepwise demagnetization o f the SIRM using AFs up to $120\;\mathrm{mT}$ on the D-2000 AF demagnetizer, allowing estimation of the median destructive field of the samples.  

# Coordinates  

All magnetic data are reported relative to IODP orientation conventions: $+x$ is into the face of the working half, $+y$ points towar d the left side of the face of the working half, and $+z$ points downsection. The relationship between the SRM coordinates $(X,\,Y,$ an d Z) and the data coordinates $(x,y,$ and $z$ ) is $x=X,y=-Y,$ and $z=Z$ fo r archive halves and $x=-X,$ $y=Y,$ and $z=Z$ for working halves. Th e coordinate systems for the JR-6A spinner magnetometer and Natsuhara-Giken sampling cubes are indicated in Figure F10. In order t o view discrete sample data in geographic coordinates that agree wit h SRM data, they were assigned an azimuth of 0 and dip of 90 in th e JR-6A spinner software, Rema6W.  

# Core orientation  

During APC, HLAPC, and RCB coring, nonmagnetic (Monel ) core barrels and nonmagnetic drill collars were used, allowing muc h better quality of magnetic data from these intervals than those related to the XCB system. Only APC cores were oriented; APC cor e orientation was achieved with the Icefield MI-5 orientation tool, mounted on the core barrel for selected holes (e.g., Holes U1461 C and U1463C). The tool consists of three mutually perpendicula r fluxgate magnetic sensors and two perpendicular gravity sensors. The information from both sets of sensors allows the azimuth an d dip of the hole to be measured, as well as the azimuth of the AP C core orientation. The orientation information contributed to paleomagnetic polarity determinations and magnetostratigraphic interpretations.  

# Magnetostratigraphy  

Magnetostratigraphy for each site was constructed by correlating observed polarity sequences with the geomagnetic polarit y timescale (GPTS) and compared with biostratigraphic datums (se e Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology). Polarity sequences wer e established using archive-half and discrete sample data togethe r when possible, but some sites required dependence on one or th e other due to technical difficulties and/or the nature of the sediments and limits of shipboard analysis. We adopted the GPTS o f Gradstein et al. (2012), in which boundary ages for Chrons C1n– C13n and ${\mathrm{C}}24{\mathrm{n}}.{\mathrm{ln}}{\mathrm{-}}{\mathrm{C}}34{\mathrm{n}}$ are orbitally tuned, whereas those fo r Chrons C13r–C23r are fit with splines. The mean state of the geomagnetic field corresponds to a geocentric axial dipole (GAD). Th e field inclination $(I)$ can be evaluated by using the relationship tan $(I)$ $=2\mathrm{tan}(\lambda)$ , where $\uplambda$ is the latitude for a given position. All Expeditio n 356 sites are located in the Southern Hemisphere where the timeaveraged field currently has a negative inclination that is expecte d to be about $-35^{\circ}$ . Therefore, negative (positive) inclinations at th e magnetostratigraphic evaluations indicated normal (reversed) polarities.  

Whenever possible, we offer an interpretation of the magneti c polarity following the naming convention of correlative anomal y numbers prefaced by the letter C (Tauxe et al., 1984). For normal polarity subchrons, suffixes (n1, n2, etc.) that increase with age wer e affixed to the names. For the younger part of the timescale (Pliocene–Pleistocene), we use traditional names to refer to the variou s chrons and subchrons (e.g., Brunhes, Jaramillo, Olduvai, etc.). I n

general, polarity reversals occurring at core section ends have bee n treated with extreme caution.  

# Physical properties  

High-resolution physical properties measurements were mad e during Expedition 356 with several primary objectives. The firs t was to measure the lithology-dependent density and porosity of th e sections so that the tectonic subsidence of each of the sites could b e interpreted in conjunction with the age model and paleobathymetry. Secondly, the physical properties aided the lithostratigraphi c characterization and were a valuable tie between core observations, downhole measurements, and seismic profiles. In particular, physical properties data played a major role in hole-to-hole and site-tosite stratigraphic correlation, detection of discontinuities and heterogeneities, identification of differences in sediment compositio n and texture, and identification of major seismic reflectors. Finally, we also measured the thermal properties of the recovered materia l and used them in conjunction with the downhole temperature measurements to infer heat flow. A variety of techniques and method s were used to characterize Expedition 356 cores on whole-round, split-core, and discrete samples. Core sections are generally $1.5\,\mathrm{m}$ i n length, so a typical coring length (stroke) of $9.5\;\mathrm{m}$ yields six section s plus a shorter seventh section. Procedures for measuring soft sediment or lithified sediment cores differ slightly.  

# Sedimentary cores  

Recovered whole-round sections were first allowed to equilibrate to ambient room temperature $({\sim}20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ and pressure for ${\sim}4\,\mathrm{h}$ . After thermally equilibrating, core sections were run through th e WRMSL for measurement of density by gamma ray attenuatio n (GRA), MS, and, where contact between sediment and core line r was sufficiently good, compressional wave velocity on the $P$ -wav e logger (PWL). Cores recovered with the XCB or RCB systems ar e slightly smaller in diameter than those cored with the APC system. As a result, sections cored with the XCB or RCB typically have gap s between the liner and the core. In these cases, $P.$ -wave velocity measurements with the WRMSL were often outside the accepted velocity range $(1000{-}4500\,\mathrm{m/s})$ ) and therefore not retained. Sections wer e subsequently measured with the NGRL.  

In one hole at each site, thermal conductivity was measured o n approximately one whole-round per core and then repeat measurements were taken in subsequent holes, as needed. Measurement s were conducted with a needle probe inserted into the sectio n through a small hole drilled through the plastic core liner close t o the middle of the section. In lithified sediments, a contact prob e method in a half-space configuration on split cores was used fo r thermal conductivity measurements.  

After completion of measurements on whole-round sections, the cores were split longitudinally, with one half designated as archive and one as working for sampling and analysis (see Core handling and analysis). The archive half of the core was passe d through the SHMSL for measurement of MSP, colorimetry, an d color reflectance (see Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology).  

Compressional $P$ -wave velocity measurements on split core s were typically made on the working halves that had been sample d for MAD, employing the $P$ -wave caliper $\scriptstyle{\mathbf{\varphi}}x$ -axis direction). Shea r strength (Torvane) and normal strength (penetrometer) were measured on the same half cores.  

Discrete samples were collected from the working halves. Tw o samples were generally taken in each full-length core and one i n each half-length core in the first hole at each site. Depending o n lithologic variability, additional samples were taken in conjunctio n with smear slides or thin sections. These samples were then used t o measure wet bulk density, dry bulk density, water content, porosity, and grain density with MAD procedures. Where possible, sample s were taken at the same locations as smear slides (see Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology) so that a quantitative assessment o f grain size and lithology corresponds directly to MAD results.  

A full discussion of all methodologies and calculations use d aboard the JOIDES Resolution in the physical properties laborator y is available in Blum (1997). Details and procedures for each physica l properties measurement are described below.  

# Whole-Round Multisensor Logger measurements  

GRA-derived bulk density, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, and magnetic susceptibility were measured nondestructively with the WRMSL. T o optimize the measurement process, sampling intervals and measurement integration times were the same for all sensors. Samplin g intervals were set at $5~\mathrm{{cm}}$ with an integration time of $_{\mathrm{~3~s~}}$ for eac h measurement. These sampling intervals are common denominator s of the distances between the sensors installed on the WRMSL (30– $50~\mathrm{cm}$ ), which allows sequential and simultaneous measurements. After measuring a core, quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA ) was monitored by passing a single core liner filled with deionize d water through the WRMSL.  

We also fast-tracked the whole rounds through the STMSL wit h $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ spacing using the GRA and magnetic susceptibility before th e cores had thermally equilibrated. This allowed us to provide preliminary information on the cores to be used for stratigraphic correlation of the overlapping holes at a given site (see Stratigraphi c correlation).  

# Gamma ray attenuation bulk density  

Bulk density can be used to estimate the pore volume in sediment and evaluate the consolidation state of sediment. GRA densit y is an estimate of bulk density based on the attenuation of a gamm a ray beam. The beam is produced by a $^{137}\!C s$ gamma ray source at  a radiation level of 370 MBq within a lead shield with a $5\,\mathrm{mm}$ collimator, which is directed through the whole-round core. The gamm a ray detector on the opposite side of the core from the source includes a scintillator and an integral photomultiplier tube to recor d the gamma radiation that passes through the core. The attenuatio n of gamma rays occurs primarily by Compton scattering, in whic h gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation; the degre e of scattering is related to the material bulk density. Therefore, for  a known thickness of sample, the density (ρ) is proportional to the intensity of the attenuated gamma rays and can be expressed as  

$$
\uprho=\mathrm{ln}(I/I_{0})/(\upmu d),
$$  

where  

$I=$ the measured intensity of gamma rays passing through the sample,   
$I_{0}={}$ gamma ray source intensity,   
$\upmu=$ Compton attenuation coefficient, and   
$d=$ sample diameter.  

# $\upmu$ and $I_{0}$ are treated as constants, such that $\uprho$ can be calculated fro m $I.$ .  

In general, WRMSL measurements are most accurate whe n taken on a completely filled core liner with minimal drilling disturbance; otherwise, measurements tend to underestimate true values. By default, the instrument reports measurements using the internal diameter of the core liner $\left(66\;\mathrm{mm}\right)$ as the assumed sample diameter. This assumption is suitable for most sediment cores obtained by th e APC; however, for sediment and/or hard rock cored by the XCB o r RCB, core diameter is usually about $58\;\mathrm{mm}$ or less. The spatial resolution of the GRA densitometer is less than $\pm1\;\mathrm{cm}$ . The gamma ra y detector is calibrated with sealed calibration cores (one standar d core liner filled with distilled water and aluminum cylinders of various diameters). To establish the calibration curves, gamma ra y counts were taken through each aluminum cylinder for $60~\mathrm{s}$ . Eac h aluminum cylinder has a density of $2.7\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3};$ , and $^d$ is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, o r $6\,\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The relationship between $I$ and $\upmu d$ is  

$$
\ln(I)=\mathrm{A}(\upmu d)^{2}+\mathrm{B}(\upmu d)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where A, B, and C are coefficients determined from the calibration.  

Recalibration was performed as needed when the deionized water QC/QA standard deviated significantly (more than a few percent) from $1\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

# Magnetic susceptibility  

Magnetic susceptibility $(\upchi)$ is a dimensionless measure of the degree to which a material can be magnetized by an external magneti c field:  

$$
\mathrm{\boldmath~\cal~X~}\!=\!M/H,
$$  

where $M$ is the magnetization induced in the material by an external field of strength $H.$ . Magnetic susceptibility is primarily sensitive t o the concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g., magnetite, pyrite, and a few other iron oxides). It is also sensitive to magnetic mineralogy and can be related to the origin of the materials in the core an d their subsequent diagenesis.  

The measurements were made using a Bartington MS2C loo p sensor with a $9~\mathrm{{cm}}$ diameter. An oscillator circuit in the sensor, which operates at a frequency of $0.565\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and an AF of ${\sim}140\,\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}$ , produces a low-intensity nonsaturating alternating magnetic field. Sediment core sections going through the influence of this fiel d cause a change in oscillator frequency. Frequency information returned in pulse form to the susceptometer is converted into magnetic susceptibility. The loop sensor has a spatial resolution of $^{23-}$ $27\;\mathrm{mm}$ and is accurate to within $2\%$ .  

# $\pmb{P}$ -wave velocity  

$P$ -wave sonic velocity data can be used to assist in the correlation between the core and seismic sections, correlate betwee n downhole logging and core data, and evaluate porosity and cementation. $P_{\|}$ -wave (compressional) velocity $\left(V_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ is defined by the tim e required for a compressional wave to travel a specific distance:  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=d/t_{\mathrm{core}},
$$  

where $^d$ is the path length of the wave across the core and $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is th e traveltime through the core.  

The PWL measures the traveltime of $500\ \mathrm{kHz}$ ultrasonic wave s horizontally across the core at $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ intervals while it remains in th e core liner. Waves are transmitted to the core by transducer contact s connected to linear actuators. Pressure is applied to the actuators t o ensure coupling between the transducers and the core liner, and th e space between the core liner and transducers was kept wet to ensur e good coupling. $P$ -wave velocity transducers measure total traveltime of the compressional wave between transducers. The wav e travels horizontally across the whole core and core liner. The tota l observed traveltime $t_{\mathrm{core}}$ is composed of  

$t_{\mathrm{delay}}=$ time delay related to transducer faces and electronic circuitry,   
$t_{\mathrm{pulse}}=$ delay related to the peak detection procedure,   
$t_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ transit time through the core liner, and   
$t_{\mathrm{core}}=$ traveltime through the sediment.  

The system is calibrated using a core liner filled with distille d water, which provides control for $t_{\mathrm{delay}},\ t_{\mathrm{pulse}},$ and $t_{\mathrm{liner}}$ . From thes e calibrations, $V_{\mathrm{p}}$ can be calculated for the whole-round specimens i n core liners as  

$$
V_{\mathrm{p}}=(d_{\mathrm{cl}}-2d_{\mathrm{liner}})/(t_{\mathrm{o}}-t_{\mathrm{pulse}}-t_{\mathrm{delay}}-2t_{\mathrm{liner}}),
$$  

where  

$d_{\mathrm{cl}}=$ measured diameter of core and liner, $d_{\mathrm{liner}}=$ liner wall thickness, and $t_{\mathrm{o}}=$ measured total traveltime.  

The above equation assumes that the core completely fills th e core liner. Measurements outside the accepted range of 1000–450 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ were discarded.  

# Natural Gamma Radiation Logger measurements  

Gamma radiation is emitted from the decay of 238-uraniu m $^{(238}\mathrm{U})$ , 232-thorium $(^{232}\mathrm{Th})$ , and 40-potassium $(^{40}\mathrm{K})$ within the cor e sample. The NGRL measures this natural emission on whole-roun d cores using a system designed and built at Texas A&M Universit y (USA) (Vasiliev et al., 2011; Dunlea et al., 2013). When $^{238}\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th},$ and $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ radioisotopes decay, they and their daughter products emi t gamma radiation at specific energy levels unique to each isotope. Natural gamma radiation (NGR) spectroscopy measures a wide energy spectrum that can be used to estimate the abundance of eac h isotope based on the strength of the signal at characteristic energie s (Blum, 1997; Gilmore, 2008). Spectral data were collected and ca n be used for postcruise processing for U, Th, and K abundance bu t were not processed on board. Total counts were used on board, wit h high counts usually identifying fine-grained deposits containing Krich clay minerals and their absorbed U and Th isotopes. NGR dat a thus revealed stratigraphic details that aid in core-to-core correlations. The main NGRL detector unit consists of 8 sodium iodid e (NaI) detectors arranged along the core measurement axis at $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals surrounding the lower half of the section. The detector array has passive (layers of lead) and active (plastic scintillators ) shielding to reduce the background environmental and cosmic radiation. The overlying plastic scintillators detect incoming high-energy gamma and muon cosmic radiation and cancel this signal fro m the total counted by the NaI detectors.  

The quality of the energy spectrum measured in a core depend s on the concentration of radionuclides in the sample but also on th e counting time, with higher times yielding better spectra. Therefore, a measurement run consisted of counting on each core section fo r $300\,{\sf s}$ at Position 1. After $300\;{\sf s}_{\mathrm{.}}$ , the section was offset by $10\;\mathrm{cm}$ (Position 2) and measured again for $300{\mathrm{~s}},$ . This yielded a total of 1 6 measurements $\mathrm{[0~cm}$ apart) per $150\ \mathrm{cm}$ section. These setting s yielded statistically significant energy spectra. In some cores, th e spatial resolution of NGR measurements was decreased to $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ b y counting only at Position 1, thus speeding up core flow.  

# Thermal conductivity measurements  

After NGR measurements were completed, thermal conductivity was measured with the TK04 (Teka Bolin) system using a needl e probe method in full-space configuration for whole-round sediment cores (Von Herzen and Maxwell, 1959) or a contact prob e method in half-space configuration on split cores for lithified sediments. The probes contain a heater wire and calibrated thermistor.  

For soft sediment, the needle probe was inserted into a $2~\mathrm{mm}$ diameter hole drilled through the liner along one of the lines tha t later guided core splitting. To avoid interference from airflow in th e laboratory, the core was placed into an enclosed box outfitted wit h foam insulation. For lithified sediment cores, the section half wa s put in the enclosed box, and the contact probe was put on the cu t face of the sample. The contact probe was embedded in the surfac e of an epoxy block with a low thermal conductivity (Vacquier, 1985).  

The calibrated heat source of the probe was turned on and th e increase in temperature was recorded over $^{80\ s}$ for measurement s with the needle probe and $60~\mathrm{s}$ for measurements with the contac t probe. A heating power of $1~\mathrm{W/m}$ was typically used in soft sediment and $0.5{-}1.5\ \mathrm{W/m}$ for lithified sediments. The solution to th e heat conduction equation with a line source of heat was then fit t o the temperature measurements to obtain the thermal conductivity. Because the probe is much more conductive than sediment, th e probe is assumed to be a perfect conductor. Under this assumption, the temperature of the superconductive probe has a linear relationship with the natural logarithm of the time after the initiation of th e heat:  

$$
T(t)=(q/4\uppi k)\times\ln(t)+\mathrm{C},
$$  

where  

$T\!=$ temperature (K),   
$q=$ heat input per unit length per unit time $\left(\mathrm{J}/\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}\right)$ , $k=$ thermal conductivity $(\mathrm{W}/[\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K}])$ ,   
$t=$ time after the initiation of the heat (s), and   
$C=$ instrumental constant.  

Three automatic measuring cycles were used to calculate average conductivity. A self-test, which included a drift study, was conducted at the beginning of each measurement cycle. Once the prob e temperature stabilized, the heater circuit was closed and the temperature rise in the probe was recorded. Thermal conductivity wa s calculated from the rate of temperature rise while the heater curren t was flowing. Temperatures measured during the first 60 or $^{80\mathrm{~s~}}$ o f the heating cycle were fit to an approximate solution of a constantl y heated line source (for details, see Kristiansen [1982] and Blu m [1997]). Measurement errors were $5\%{-}10\%$ . Thermal conductivit y measurements  were  routinely  taken  in  one section  per  cor e throughout the first hole. Some cores yielded no results for therma l conductivity because cracks in the sediment caused bad coupling o f the needle probe to the sediment.  

# Section Half Multisensor Logger measurements  

We measured color reflectance and magnetic susceptibility o n archive halves using the SHMSL. The archive half of the split cor e was placed on the core track, above which an electronic platfor m moves along a track, recording the height of the split-core surfac e with a laser sensor. The laser establishes the location of the botto m of the section, and then the platform reverses the direction of movement, moving from bottom to top making MSP and color reflectance measurements. All foam inserts were removed from the hal f cores before measurement, so that the measured range of value s represents that of the core material only. During Expedition 356, MSP and color reflectance data were collected at constant interval s of $2.5~\mathrm{cm}$ . This resolution facilitates comparison with results obtained from the magnetic susceptibility loop of the WRMSL, whic h has a sampling interval of $5\,\mathrm{cm}$ .  

# Color reflectance spectrometry  

The color reflectance spectrometer uses an Ocean Optics 3 0 mm integrating sphere and both halogen and LED light sources, which covers wavelengths from UV through visible to near infrared. The measurements were taken from 380 to $900\;\mathrm{nm}$ wavelengths at  2 nm intervals. The approximate 3 s data acquisition offset was applied for the entire scan of the archive half. The data are reporte d using the $\mathrm{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ color system, in which $L^{\ast}$ is lightness, $\mathbf{a}^{*}$ is rednes s (positive) versus greenness (negative), and $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ is yellowness (positive) versus blueness (negative) of the rock. The color reflectanc e spectrometer calibrates on two spectra, pure white (reference) an d pure black (dark). Color calibration was conducted approximatel y once every $^{6\mathrm{~h~}}$ (twice per shift). See additional details in Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology.  

# Point magnetic susceptibility  

MSP was measured with a Bartington MS2 meter and an MS2 K contact probe with a flat $15\;\mathrm{mm}$ diameter round sensor with a fiel d of influence of $25~\mathrm{mm}$ and an operation frequency of $930\;\mathrm{Hz}$ . Th e archive halves of split cores were covered with clear plastic wrap t o ensure a flush contact between the MSP sensor and the split cor e without sediment contaminating the sensor. Different instrumen t settings were used, with the instrument averaging one, two, or thre e measurements from the sensor for each offset. Early during Expedition 356, we observed a drift in instrument readings during th e measurements of every section half. This drift was empirically estimated by repeated measurements of a split core liner filled with Styrofoam. We found that a third-order polynomial best describes th e observed drift and used this equation to correct the MSP measurements:  

# $d=\mathbf{a}x^{3}+\mathbf{b}x^{2}+\mathbf{c}x,$  

where $^d$ is the drift during the measurement of a section half and $_{\mathscr{x}}$ is the offset of the measurement within the section in centimeters. The constants a, b, and $\mathbf{c}$ are $-1.70\times10^{-6},$ , $1.49\times10^{-4},$ , and $1.99~\times$ $10^{-2}$ for three averaged measurements per offset and $-2.29\times10^{-6}$ , $1.88\times10^{-4}$ , and $2.44\times10^{-2}$ for two averaged measurements per offset. The drift-corrected SHMSL MSP results were made available t o the entire science party during Expedition 356. However, only th e raw data are available through the LIMS database.  

The spatial resolution of the MSP instrument is ${\sim}3.8\ \mathrm{mm}$ . A s with whole-round measurements, the output displayed by the MS P sensor must be converted to dimensionless SI units by multiplyin g by $10^{-5}$ . The probe is zeroed in air before each measurement location to avoid influence from the metal track. The MSP meter wa s calibrated by the manufacturer before installation on the ship and i s quality checked every ${\sim}6\mathrm{~h~}$ at the same time as color reflectanc e sensor calibration.  

# Section Half Measurement Gantry measurements  

For soft-sediment cores, $P$ -wave velocity and shear strengt h measurements were performed on the working half of split cores. $P$ - wave velocity measurements used the $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{x}}^{\prime}$ -axis caliper contact prob e transducer on the Section Half Measurement Gantry (SHMG), wit h at least one analysis per core. Cores drilled with the XCB syste m generally did not provide usable data because of bad sediment/line r contact and disturbed sediment. For lithified sediments, $P$ -wave velocity was measured on discrete samples and/or on samples take n within core liners and/or on MAD cubes, prior to MAD analyses.  

# P-wave velocity  

The $P$ -wave velocity system uses Panametrics-NDT Microsca n delay line transducers, which transmit at $0.5~\mathrm{MHz}$ . The signal received through the section half or discrete sample was recorded b y the computer attached to the system. During Expedition 356, if th e automatic picker failed to give sensible results, we manually picke d the point of maximum change in slope at the start of the first arrival. The distance between transducers was measured with a built-in linear voltage displacement transformer. Calibration was performe d with a series of acrylic cylinders of differing thicknesses and  a known $P.$ -wave velocity of $2750\,\pm\,20~\mathrm{m/s}$ . The determined syste m time delay from calibration was subtracted from the picked arrival time to give a traveltime of the $P$ -wave through the sample. Th e thickness of the sample (calculated by the linear voltage displacement transformer, in meters) was divided by the traveltime (in seconds) to calculate $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity in meters per second.  

# Shear strength  

Shear strength is the resistance of a material to failure in shear . Shear stress in unconsolidated materials is resisted only by the network of solid particles. Shear strength $\left(\uptau_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ can be expressed as  a function of the effective normal stress at failure $\left(\sigma^{\prime}\right)$ , the effectiv e cohesion $\left(c^{\prime}\right)$ , and friction angle $\left(\Phi^{\prime}\right)$ :  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{\bar{r}}_{\mathrm{f}}=c^{\prime}+\mathbf{\sigma}^{\prime}\tan{\Phi^{\prime}},}\end{array}
$$  

where $c^{\prime}$ and $\Phi^{\prime}$ are the shear strength parameters that define a linear relationship between $\tau_{\mathrm{f}}$ and $\Phi^{\prime}$ , according to the Mohr-Coulom b failure criterion.  

Shear strength parameters can be determined by means of multiple laboratory tests. The $c^{\prime}$ and $\Phi^{\prime}$ are relevant in situations wher e field drainage conditions correspond to test conditions. The shear strength of a soil under undrained conditions (interstitial water drainage does not occur during failure) is different from that under drained conditions (interstitial water drainage occurs).  

Undrained shear strength $\left(S_{\mathrm{u}}\right)$ can be expressed in terms of total stress in the case of fully saturated materials of low permeability (e.g., clays). The most common strength tests in shipboard laboratories are the vane shear and penetrometer tests, which provide measurement of undrained shear strength (Blum, 1997).  

During Expedition 356, $S_{\mathrm{u}}$ was measured in undisturbed finegrained sediment using the handheld Torvane shear device in working-half cores. Undrained shear strength was determined by inserting an eight-bladed vane into the split core and putting it under shear stress to cause a cylindrical surface to be sheared by the vane. This procedure provides a measurement of the peak shear strength, expressed in units of kilograms per square centimeter. Measurements were made with the vane rotation axis perpendicular to the split surface. Shear strength was measured once in each core when sediments were within the instrument range.  

A pocket penetrometer (Model 29-3729, Ele International) was used to measure the sediment’s response to normal stress (units of kilograms per square centimeter). Measurements were made close to the stratigraphic position of the $S_{\mathrm{u}}$ measurements described above.  

# Discrete sample measurements of moisture and density  

Discrete samples were collected from the working halves to determine wet and dry bulk density, grain density, water content, and porosity. In soft sediment, $\sim\!10\ \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ samples were collected with a plastic syringe, a diameter that fit within that of the glass vials. As a general rule, two samples were taken in each full-length core and one in each half-length core in the first hole at each site. Depending on lithologic variability, additional samples were taken in conjunction with smear slides or thin sections. In indurated sediment and hard rock, sawed $1.4\:\mathrm{cm}\times1.4\:\mathrm{cm}\times3\:\mathrm{cm}$ (to $1\;{\mathrm{cm}}\times1\;{\mathrm{cm}}\times1.5\;{\mathrm{cm}})$ ) cubes were extracted from the working halves for physical properties measurements, and many of these cubes were also used for orthogonal $P$ -wave velocity measurements. Sampling frequency was reduced to 1–2 samples every other core or less from overlapping portions of Holes B, C, and/or D. However, certain sections of overlapping cores were targeted for repeat measurements or even increased sampling in order to refine observational trends suggested by earlier cores or discrepancies between holes seen in WRMSL data. As we selected the locations for discrete sampling of physical properties, we attempted to co-locate them with those for slide smears and thin sections.  

# Sample preparation  

Soft-sediment samples were placed in numbered preweighed ${\sim}16~\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment weighing, drying, and dry volume measurements. A more complex procedure is traditionally followed for lithified sediments. To determine the wet mass of lithified sediment, we placed the samples in individual plastic vials filled with seawater and used a vacuum chamber to force saturation in the pore spaces. The vacuum pump removed the air from the chamber to a pressure of ${\sim}40{-}50\ \mathrm{kPa}$ below atmospheric pressure, in theory forcing seawater into the samples. These samples were kept under saturation for at least $24~\mathrm{h}$ , with the vacuum maintained in the chamber by turning the pump on for $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ every $^{1\,\mathrm{h}}$ . After removal from the saturator, the cubes were patted dry with a paper towel and wet mass immediately determined using the dual balance system. However, we also measured these wet samples before placing them in the $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ seawater bath under vacuum and found that the wet mass was not changed within observational uncertainty by this procedure. That is, pore water saturation was not affected by $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ in seawater under a vacuum. Thus, subsequent lithified samples were not placed in a seawater bath under a vacuum. The only lithified samples for which we followed the above procedures were several PAL samples that had been cored 4 days prior to our processing of the samples. These samples were also weighed before and after the $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ vacuum seawater bath and all weighed less after $24~\mathrm{{h}}$ in the seawater bath, supporting our earlier decision to dispense with soaking of lithified material.  

$P$ -wave velocities were then measured on some of the wet lithified samples. Following the velocity measurements, the samples were placed in numbered preweighed ${\sim}16~\mathrm{mL}$ Wheaton glass vials for wet and dry sediment weighing, drying, and dry volume measurements. Samples were dried in a convection oven for at least $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ at $105^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\pm5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Dried samples were then cooled in a desiccator for at least $60\;\mathrm{min}$ before dry mass and volume were measured.  

# Dual balance mass measurement  

The weights of wet and dry sample masses were determined to a precision of $0.005\mathrm{~g~}$ using two Mettler Toledo electronic balances, with one acting as a reference. A standard weight of similar value to the sample was placed on the reference balance to increase accuracy. A computer averaging system was used to compensate for the ship’s motion. The default setting of the balances is 300 measurements (taking ${\sim}1.5\;\mathrm{min}]$ ).  

# Pycnometer volume measurement  

Dry sample volume was determined using a hexapycnometer system of a six-celled custom-configured Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330TC helium-displacement pycnometer. The precision of each cell is $1\%$ of the full-scale volume. Volume measurement was preceded by three purges of the sample chamber with helium warmed to ${\sim}28^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Three measurement cycles were run for each sample. A reference volume (set of two calibration spheres) was placed sequentially in one of the chambers to check for instrument drift and systematic error. The volumes occupied by the numbered Wheaton vials were calculated before the cruise by multiplying each vial’s weight against the average density of the vial glass. Dry mass and volume were measured after samples were heated in an oven at $105^{\circ}C\pm5^{\circ}C$ for $24\,\mathrm{{h}}$ and allowed to cool in a desiccator. The procedures for the determination of these physical properties comply with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) designation (D) 2216 (ASTM International, 1990). The fundamental relation and assumptions for the calculations of all physical properties parameters are discussed by Blum (1997) and summarized below.  

# Mass and volume calculation  

We measured wet mass $\left(M_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry mass $(M_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , and dry volume $(V_{\mathrm{dry}})$ . The ratio of mass $(\mathrm{rm})$ is a computational constant of 0.965 (i.e., $0.965~\mathrm{g}$ of freshwater per $1\ \mathrm{g}$ of seawater). Salt precipitated in sediment pores during the drying process is included in the $M_{\mathrm{dry}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{dry}}$ values. The mass of the evaporated water $\left(M_{\mathrm{water}}\right)$ and salt $\left(M_{\mathrm{salt}}\right)$ in the sample are given by  

$$
M_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{water}}[{\bf s}/(1-{\bf s})],
$$  

where s is the assumed saltwater salinity (0.035) corresponding to  a pore water density $(\rho_{\mathrm{pw}})$ of $1.024~\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ and a salt density $(\boldsymbol{\rho}_{\mathrm{salt}})$ o f $2.22\,\mathrm{g}/\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ .  

The corrected mass of pore water $(M_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , volume of pore wate r $(V_{\mathrm{pw}})$ , mass of solids excluding salt $(M_{\mathrm{solid}})$ , volume of salt $(V_{\mathrm{salt}})$ , volume of solids excluding salt $\left(V_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , and wet volume $\left(V_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ are  

$$
M_{\mathrm{pw}}=(M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{dry}})/\mathrm{rm},
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{pw}}=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{pw}},
$$  

$$
M_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}-M_{\mathrm{pw}},
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{salt}}=M_{\mathrm{salt}}/\uprho_{\mathrm{salt}},
$$  

$$
V_{\mathrm{solid}}=V_{\mathrm{wet}}-V_{\mathrm{pw}}.
$$  

# Calculation of bulk properties  

For all sediment samples, water content $\mathbf{\Pi}(w)$ is expressed as th e ratio of mass of pore water to wet sediment (total) mass:  

$$
w=M_{\mathrm{pw}}/M_{\mathrm{wet}}.
$$  

Wet bulk density $\left(\uprho_{\mathrm{wet}}\right)$ , dry bulk density $(\uprho_{\mathrm{dry}})$ , sediment grai n density $\left(\rho_{\mathrm{solid}}\right)$ , porosity ${\bf\Pi}(\Phi)$ , and void ratio $(V R)$ are calculated as  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{wet}}=M_{\mathrm{wet}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}}\\ &{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{dry}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}}\\ &{}\\ &{\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{solid}}=M_{\mathrm{solid}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}},}\\ &{\Updownarrow}\\ &{\Uparrow=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{wet}}\ \mathrm{and}}\\ &{\Uparrow=V_{\mathrm{pw}}/V_{\mathrm{solid}}.}\end{array}
$$  

MAD properties reported and plotted in the physical propertie s sections of all site chapters were calculated with the MADMax shipboard program, set with “Method $C^{\dprime}$ calculation process.  

# Downhole measurements  

Downhole logs are used to determine physical, chemical, an d structural properties of the formation penetrated by a borehole. Th e data are rapidly collected, continuous with depth, and measured i n situ; they can be interpreted in terms of the stratigraphy, lithology, physical properties, mineralogy, magnetic characteristics, and geochemical composition of the penetrated formation. Where core recovery is incomplete or disturbed, log data may provide the onl y way to characterize the sedimentary succession. Where core recovery is good, log and core data complement one another and may b e interpreted jointly.  

Downhole logs measure formation properties on a scale that i s intermediate between that of laboratory measurements on cor e samples and that of geophysical surveys. The logs are useful in calibrating the interpretation of geophysical survey data and provide  a necessary link for the integrated understanding of physical an d chemical properties on different scales. Moreover, the physical properties of the recovered core can be changed from in situ characteristics either because of the drilling process or the change in pressure, and downhole measurements can thus help to characteriz e these changes.  

In addition, during the initial coring of some holes, we also measured the formation temperature as a function of depth, and this allowed us to estimate the heat flux, which is important for assessin g the viability of models governing the tectonic subsidence regionally.  

# Wireline logging  

During wireline logging operations, the logs are recorded wit h Schlumberger logging tools combined into tool strings, which ar e lowered into the open borehole after completion of coring operations. Three tool strings were used during Expedition 356: the tripl e combination (combo), which measures borehole width, total spectral gamma ray (HSGR), porosity, density, resistivity, and MS; th e Formation MicroScanner (FMS)-sonic, which provides FMS resistivity images of the borehole wall and sonic velocities; and the Versatile Seismic Imager (VSI) for the vertical seismic profile (VSP). Each tool string also contains a telemetry cartridge for communicating through the wireline to the Schlumberger data acquisitio n system (MAXIS unit) on the ship. In preparation for logging, th e boreholes were reamed in their lower sections, flushed of debris b y circulating drilling fluid, and were at least partially filled with seawater-based logging gel (sepiolite mud mixed with seawater an d weighted with barite; density ${\sim}1258\ \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^{3})$ to help stabilize th e borehole walls in sections where instability was expected from drilling and coring disturbance. The BHA was pulled up to ${\sim}80$ meter s below seafloor (mbsf), where it protected the unstable upper part o f the hole. The tool strings were then lowered downhole on a sevenconductor wireline cable before being pulled up at a constant spee d of $550\;\mathrm{m/h}$ for the triple combo and FMS-sonic to provide continuous log measurements of several properties simultaneously.  

Each tool string deployment is termed a logging “run.” Durin g each run, tool strings can be lowered and pulled up in the hole several times to check repeatability or to increase coverage of the FM S borehole images. Each lowering or hauling-up of the tool strin g while collecting data constitutes a “pass.” Incoming data were recorded and monitored in real time on the MCM MAXIS loggin g computer. A wireline heave compensator (WHC) was used to minimize the effect of ship’s heave on the tool position in the borehol e (see below).  

# Logged sediment properties and tool measurement principles  

The logged properties and the principles the tools use to measure them are briefly described below. More detailed informatio n on individual tools and their geological applications may be foun d in Serra (1984, 1986, 1989), Schlumberger (1989), Rider (1996), Goldberg (1997), Lovell et al. (1998), and Ellis and Singer (2007).  A complete online list of acronyms for the Schlumberger tools an d measurement curves is at http://iodp.tamu.edu/tools/logging/index.html.  

# Natural gamma radiation  

The Hostile Environment Natural Gamma Ray Sonde (HNGS ) was used on both the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings t o measure HSGR in the formation. The HNGS uses two bismuth germanate scintillation detectors and five-window spectroscopy to determine concentrations of potassium (in weight percent), thoriu m (in parts per million), and uranium (in parts per million) from th e characteristic gamma ray energies of isotopes in the $^{40}\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{:}}$ , $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ , an d $^{238}\mathrm{U}$ radioactive decay series, which dominate the natural radiatio n spectrum. The computation of the elemental abundances uses  a least-squares method of extracting U, $\mathrm{Th},$ and K elemental concentrations from the spectral measurements. The HNGS filters ou t gamma ray energies below $500\;\mathrm{keV},$ eliminating sensitivity to bentonite or KCl in the drilling mud and improving measurement accuracy. The HNGS also provides a measure of the HSGR an d uranium-free or computed gamma ray (HCGR) that are measure d in American Petroleum Institute units (gAPI). The HNGS respons e is influenced by the borehole diameter; therefore, the HNGS dat a are corrected for borehole diameter variations during acquisition.  

An additional gamma ray sensor was housed in the Enhance d Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC), which was used primarily t o communicate data to the surface. The sensor includes a sodium iodide scintillation detector that measures the total natural gamm a ray emissions of the formation. It is not a spectral tool (does no t provide U, Th, and K concentrations), but it provides total gamm a radiation for each pass.  

The inclusion of the HNGS in every tool string allows use of th e gamma ray data for precise depth-match processing between logging strings and passes and for core-log integration.  

# Density and photoelectric factor  

Formation density was measured with the Hostile Environmen t Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS). The HLDS contains a radioactive cesium $(^{137}\mathrm{Cs})$ gamma ray source $(622\;\mathrm{keV})$ and far and near gamm a ray detectors mounted on a shielded skid, which is pressed agains t the borehole wall by a hydraulically activated decentralizing arm. Gamma rays emitted by the source undergo Compton scattering, i n which gamma rays are scattered by electrons in the formation. Th e number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detectors is proportional to the density of electrons in the formation, which is in tur n related to bulk density. Porosity may also be derived from this bul k density if the matrix (grain) density is known.  

The HLDS also measures the photoelectric effect (PEF), a measure of the photoelectric absorption of low-energy gamma radiation. Photoelectric absorption of the gamma rays occurs when thei r energy falls below $150\;\mathrm{keV}$ as a result of being repeatedly scattere d by electrons in the formation. PEF is determined by comparing th e counts from the far detector in the high-energy region, where onl y Compton scattering occurs, with those in the low-energy region, where count rates depend on both reactions. Because PEF depend s on the atomic number of the elements in the formation (heavier elements have higher PEF), it also varies according to the chemica l composition of the minerals present and can be used for the identification of the overall mineral make-up of the formation. For example, the PEF of calcite is $5.08\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , illite is $3.03\;\mathrm{barn/e^{-}}$ , quartz i s $1.81\,\mathrm{barn}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ , and hematite is $21\,\mathrm{barn}/\mathrm{e}^{-}$ .  

Good contact between the tool and borehole wall is essential fo r good HLDS logs; poor contact results in underestimation of densit y values.  During  Expedition  356,  some  holes  were  often  wid e throughout the cored interval, and thus not ideally suited for thi s tool. For this reason and to limit the possibility of losing an environmentally hazardous package during deployment, the HLDS was no t run in some holes. Both the density correction and caliper measurement of the hole are used to check the contact quality. In the deepe r parts of the hole, the PEF log should be used with caution, especiall y in washouts, because barium in the logging mud swamps the signa l despite a correction for the influence of mud.  

# Porosity  

Formation porosity was measured with the Accelerator Porosit y Sonde (APS). It was not run in some holes because the often-wid e borehole and porous sediments were not ideally suited for the AP S porosity measurement. The APS includes a minitron neutron generator that produces fast $(14.4\;\mathrm{MeV})$ neutrons and five neutron detectors (four epithermal and one thermal) positioned at differen t distances from the minitron. The tool’s detectors count neutron s that arrive at the detectors after being scattered and slowed by collisions with atomic nuclei in the formation.  

The highest energy loss occurs when neutrons collide with hydrogen nuclei, which have practically the same mass as the neutro n (the neutrons bounce off of heavier elements without losing muc h energy). If the hydrogen (i.e., water) concentration is low, as in lowporosity formations, neutrons can travel farther before being captured and the count rates increase at the detector. The opposite effect occurs in high-porosity formations where the water content i s high. However, because hydrogen bound in minerals such as clay s or in hydrocarbons also contributes to the measurement, the ra w porosity value is often an overestimate. The detector also allows th e standoff distance between the wall and the tool to be estimated.  

Upon reaching thermal energies $(0.025\ \mathrm{eV})$ , the neutrons ar e captured by the nuclei of Cl, Si, B, and other elements, resulting in  a gamma ray emission. This neutron capture cross section $(\Sigma_{\mathrm{f}})$ is als o measured by the tool.  

# Electrical resistivity  

The High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA) tool provides si x resistivity measurements with different depths of investigation, including the borehole, or mud, resistivity and five measurements o f formation resistivity with increasing penetration into the formation. The tool sends a focused current into the formation and measure s the intensity necessary to maintain a constant drop in voltage acros s a fixed interval, providing direct resistivity measurements. The array has one central (source) electrode and six electrodes above an d below it, which serve alternatively as focusing and returning curren t electrodes. By rapidly changing the roles of these electrodes, a simultaneous resistivity measurement at six penetration depths i s achieved. The tool is designed to ensure that all signals are measured at exactly the same time and tool position to reduce the sensitivity to “shoulder bed” effects when crossing sharp beds thinne r than the electrode spacing. The design of the HRLA, which eliminates the need for a surface reference electrode, improves formatio n resistivity evaluation compared to traditional dual induction and allows the full range of resistivity to be measured, from low (e.g., i n high-porosity sediments) to high (e.g., in basalt). The HRLA need s to be run centralized in the borehole for optimal results, so knuckl e joints were used to centralize the HRLA while allowing the densit y and porosity tools to maintain good contact with the borehole wall. Calcite,  silica,  and  hydrocarbons  are  electrical  insulators , whereas ionic solutions like interstitial water are conductors. Electrical resistivity, therefore, can be used to evaluate porosity for  a given salinity and resistivity of the interstitial water. Clay surfac e conduction also contributes to the resistivity values, but at high porosities, this is a relatively minor effect.  

# Acoustic velocity  

The Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI) measures the transit times between sonic transmitters and an array of eight receivers. It combine s replicate measurements, thus providing a direct measurement o f sound velocity through formations that is relatively free from the effects of formation damage and an enlarged borehole (Schlumberger, 1989). Along with the monopole transmitters found on most soni c tools, it also has two crossed-dipole transmitters that allow th e measurement of shear wave velocity in addition to compressiona l wave velocity. Dipole measurements are necessary to measure shea r velocities in slow formations with shear velocity less than the velocity of sound in the borehole fluid. Such slow formations are typicall y encountered in deep-ocean drilling.  

# Magnetic susceptibility sonde  

The magnetic susceptibility sonde (MSS) is a nonstandard wireline tool designed by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO). It measures the ease with which formations are magnetized whe n subjected to a magnetic field. The ease of magnetization is ultimately related to the concentration and composition (size, shape, and mineralogy) of magnetic minerals (principally magnetite) in th e formation. These measurements provide one of the best method s for investigating stratigraphic changes in mineralogy and litholog y because the measurement is quick, repeatable, and nondestructiv e and because different lithologies often have strongly contrastin g susceptibilities.  

The MSS dual-coil sensor provides ${\sim}36~\mathrm{cm}$ vertical resolutio n measurements, with ${\sim}20~\mathrm{cm}$ depth of horizontal investigation. Th e MSS was run as the lowermost tool in the triple combo tool string, using a specially developed data translation cartridge to enable th e MSS to be run in combination with the Schlumberger tools. Th e MSS also has an optional single-coil sensor to provide high-resolution measurements $\left\langle{\sim}10\;\mathrm{cm}\right\rangle$ , but this was not used during Expedition 356 because it has a large bowspring that would require th e MSS to be run higher up in the tool string and because it is ver y sensitive to separation from the borehole wall.  

MS data are plotted as uncalibrated units. The MSS reading responses are affected by temperature and borehole size (higher temperatures lead to higher susceptibility measurements). The M S values were not fully corrected for temperature on shore during Expedition 356 such that values deeper than several hundred meter s were generally not interpretable. When the MS signal in sediment i s very low, the detection limits of the tool may be reached. For qualit y control and environmental correction, the MSS also measures internal tool temperature, $z$ -axis acceleration, and low-resolutio n borehole conductivity.  

# Formation MicroScanner  

The FMS provides high-resolution electrical resistivity–base d images of borehole walls. The tool has four orthogonal arms an d pads, each containing 16 button electrodes that are pressed agains t the borehole wall during logging. The electrodes are arranged i n two diagonally offset rows of 8 electrodes each. A focused current i s emitted from the button electrodes into the formation, with a return electrode near the top of the tool. Resistivity of the formatio n at the button electrodes is derived from the intensity of curren t passing through each electrode on the button.  

Processing transforms the resistivity measurements into oriented high-resolution images that reveal geologic structures of th e borehole wall. Features such as bedding, stratification, fracturing, slump folding, and bioturbation can be resolved (Lovell et al., 1998; Serra, 1989). Because the images are oriented to magnetic north, further analysis can provide measurement of the dip and directio n (azimuth) of planar features in the formation. In addition, when th e corresponding planar features can be identified in the recovere d core samples, individual core pieces can be reoriented with respec t to true north.  

Approximately $30\%$ of a borehole with a diameter of $25~\mathrm{cm}$ i s imaged during a single pass. Standard procedure is to make two full uphole passes with the FMS to maximize the borehole coverag e with the pads. The maximum extension of the caliper arms is 40. 6 cm. In holes with a diameter greater than this maximum, the pa d contact at the end of the caliper arms will be inconsistent, and th e FMS images may appear out of focus and too conductive. Irregula r (rough) borehole walls will also adversely affect the images if contact with the wall is poor.  

# Acceleration and inclinometry  

Three-component acceleration and magnetic field measurements were made with the General Purpose Inclinometry Tool (GPIT). The primary purpose of this tool, which incorporates  a three-component accelerometer and a three-component magnetometer, is to determine the acceleration and orientation of the FMSsonic and Ultrasonic Borehole Imager (not run during Expeditio n 356) tool strings during logging. This information allows the FM S and UBI images to be corrected for irregular tool motion and th e dip and direction (azimuth) of features in the images to be determined. The GPIT was also run on the triple combo tool string i n order to provide data to optimize the WHC before logging bega n and hence to acquire the best possible downhole data. Tools on bot h the triple combo and FMS-sonic tool strings can carry remanent o r induced magnetization; therefore, GPIT magnetic measurement s can be affected. However, on the FMS-sonic tool string, the GPI T has greater nonmagnetic insulation from the other tools, whic h greatly reduces extraneous effects on its magnetic measurements.  

# Vertical seismic profile  

In a VSP experiment, a borehole seismic tool (VSI) is anchore d against the borehole wall at regularly spaced intervals and record s the full waveform of elastic waves generated by a seismic source positioned just below the sea surface. These “check shot” measurements relate depth in the hole to traveltime in reflection seismi c profiles. The VSI used on the ship contains a three-axis geophone. In a VSP survey, the VSI was anchored against the borehole wall a t approximately $25\,\mathrm{m}$ station intervals (where possible), with 5–10 ai r gun shots typically taken at each station. The recorded waveform s were stacked and a one-way traveltime was determined from th e median of the first breaks for each station. The seismic source use d was a Sercel G-gun parallel cluster composed of two $250\;\mathrm{in}^{3}$ air gun s separated by $1\textrm{m}$ . It was positioned on the port side of the JOIDE S Resolution at a water depth of ${\sim}7~\mathrm{m}$ below sea level with a borehol e offset of ${\sim}45~\mathrm{m}$ .  

Precautions were taken to protect marine mammals, turtles, an d diving sea birds. If there were no mammals in or approaching th e safety radius of $1850\;\mathrm{m}$ stipulated for shallow-water depths betwee n 98 and $205\,\mathrm{~m~}$ during Expedition 356, air gun operations commenced using a ramp-up, or “soft start” procedure (gradually increasing the operational pressure and air gun firing interval) t o provide time for undetected animals to respond to the sounds an d vacate the area. Diving sea birds are subject to different exclusio n zones, which for Expedition 356, was restricted to the immediat e vicinity of the vessel. Once the air guns were at full power, the chec k shot survey proceeded. Marine mammal, turtle, and sea bird observations continued during the check shot survey, and if a protecte d species entered the designated safety radius, the survey was suspended.  

# Log data quality  

The main influence on log data quality is the condition of th e borehole wall. Where the borehole diameter varies over short intervals because of washouts of softer material or ledges of harder material, the logs from tools that require good contact with the borehol e wall (i.e., FMS, density, and porosity) may be degraded. Deep investigation measurements such as gamma radiation, resistivity, MS, and sonic velocity, which do not require contact with the borehol e wall, are generally less sensitive to borehole conditions. “Bridged ” sections, where borehole diameter is significantly below the bit size, will also cause irregular log results. The quality of the borehole i s improved by minimizing the circulation of drilling fluid while drilling, flushing the borehole to remove debris, and logging as soon a s possible after drilling and conditioning are completed.  

The quality of the wireline depth determination depends on several factors. The depth of the logging measurements is determine d from the length of the cable payed out from the winch on the ship. The seafloor is identified on the HSGR log by the abrupt upwar d reduction in gamma ray count at the water/sediment interfac e (mudline). Discrepancies between the drilling depth and the wireline log depth may occur. For the case of drilling depth, discrepancies are due to core expansion, incomplete core recovery, o r incomplete heave compensation. In the case of log depth, discrepancies between successive runs occur because of incomplete heav e compensation, incomplete correction for cable stretch, and cabl e slip. Tidal changes in sea level affect both drilling and loggin g depths, with tidal amplitude up to $4\;\mathrm{m}$ at the northernmost sites o f Expedition 356.  

# Wireline heave compensator  

During wireline logging operations, the up-and-down motion o f the ship (heave) causes a similar motion of the downhole loggin g tools. If the amplitude of this motion is large, depth discrepancie s can be introduced into the logging data. The risk of damagin g downhole instruments is also increased. A WHC system was thu s designed to compensate for the vertical motion of the ship an d maintain a steady motion of the logging tools to ensure high-qualit y logging data acquisition (Liu et al., 2013; Iturrino et al., 2013). Th e WHC uses a vertical accelerometer (motion reference unit [MRU] ) positioned under the rig floor near the ship’s center of gravity to calculate the vertical motion of the ship with respect to the seafloor. I t then adjusts the length of the wireline by varying the distance between two sets of pulleys through which the cable passes in order t o minimize downhole tool motion. Real-time measurements of uphole (surface) and downhole acceleration are made simultaneousl y by the MRU and the EDTC, respectively. An LDEO-developed software package allows these data to be analyzed and compared in rea l time, displaying the actual motion of the logging tool string and enabling monitoring of the efficiency of the compensator.  

# Logging data flow and log depth scales  

Data for each wireline logging run were monitored in real tim e and recorded using the Schlumberger MAXIS 500 system. Initia l logging data were referenced to the rig floor (wireline log depth below rig floor [WRF]). After logging was completed, the data wer e shifted to a seafloor reference (WSF), which was based on the ste p in gamma radiation at the sediment/water interface.  

Data were transferred onshore to LDEO where standardize d data processing took place. The main part of the processing is dept h matching to remove depth offsets between logs from different logging runs, which results in a new depth scale: WMSF. Also, corrections are made to certain tools and logs (e.g., FMS imagery i s corrected for tool acceleration, including “stick and slip”), documentation for the logs (with an assessment of log quality) is prepared, and the data are converted to ASCII for the conventional log s and GIF for the FMS images. The data were transferred back to th e ship within a few days of logging, and this processed data set wa s made available to the science party (in ASCII and digital log information standard [DLIS] formats) through the shipboard IODP logging database and shipboard servers. The Schlumberger Petrel software was used to visualize and unbundle the DLIS.  

# In situ temperature measurements  

During Expedition 356, in situ temperature measurements wer e made with the advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) a t several sites; we often chose the second APC hole for the measurements after the ease of APC coring was assessed in the first AP C hole. The APCT-3 fits directly into the coring shoe of the APC an d consists of a battery pack, data logger, and platinum resistance-temperature device calibrated over a temperature range from $0^{\circ}$ to $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Before entering the borehole, the tool is first stopped at the mudlin e for $5\ \mathrm{min}$ to thermally equilibrate with bottom water. When th e APC is plunged into the formation, it causes an instantaneous temperature rise from frictional heating. This heat gradually dissipate s into the surrounding sediment as the temperature at the APCT- 3 equilibrates toward the temperature of the sediment. After the AP C penetrated the sediment, it was held in place for about $10\,\mathrm{{min}}$ whil e the APCT-3 recorded the temperature of the cutting shoe every 1 s.  

The equilibrium temperature of the sediment was estimated b y applying a heat-conduction model to the temperature decay recor d (Horai and Von Herzen, 1985). The synthetic thermal decay curv e for the APCT-3 is a function of the geometry and thermal properties of the probe and the sediment (Bullard, 1954; Horai and Vo n Herzen, 1985). Equilibrium temperature was estimated by applyin g a fitting procedure (Pribnow et al., 2000). However, if the APC doe s not achieve a full stroke or if ship heave pulls the APC up from full penetration, the temperature equilibration curve is disturbed an d temperature determination is less accurate. The nominal accurac y of the APCT-3 temperature measurements is $\pm0.05^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .  

APCT-3 temperature data were combined with thermal conductivity measurements (see Physical properties) obtained fro m whole-round core sections to obtain heat flow values. Heat flow wa s calculated according to the Bullard method, to be consistent wit h the synthesis of ODP heat flow data by Pribnow et al. (2000).  

# Stratigraphic correlation  

Some Expedition 356 scientific objectives required recovery o f complete stratigraphic sections to the fullest extent possible. Continuous sedimentary sections cannot be recovered from a singl e borehole because gaps in recovery occur between successive cores, even when $100\%$ or more nominal recovery is attained (Ruddima n et al., 1987; Hagelberg et al., 1995). Construction of a complet e stratigraphic section, referred to as a splice, requires combining intervals from two or more holes cored at the same site. To maximiz e the probability that missing sedimentary sections from within  a given hole are recovered in one or more adjacent holes, we attemp t to offset between holes the depths below the seafloor from whic h cores are recovered. At least two complete holes, and in many case s three or more holes, are needed to recover a complete section in th e interval cored by the APC.  

Our methods for developing composite depths and splices followed the basic strategy that is now common practice on all highresolution paleoceanographic expeditions. We used initial measurements of MS and gamma ray density run on the STMSL to develo p preliminary composite depths for purposes of making real-tim e drilling decisions (Mix, Tiedemann, Blum, et al., 2003). STMSL dat a were collected immediately after recovery, at a time when the core s had not yet reached equilibrium temperature. Therefore, differences are expected between STMSL and WRMSL values. The dept h scale was refined as different data sets (e.g., NGR) and more detailed information became available during drilling.  

Our goals for stratigraphic correlation, in priority order, were to  

• Guide drilling to ensure recovery of a complete stratigraphic section,   
• Establish a composite depth scale,   
• Define a stratigraphically complete and representative sampling splice,  

• Evaluate and refine shipboard stratigraphic age models and their uncertainties by synthesizing all available age information in a common depth framework, and • Develop preliminary reconstructions of sedimentation rates.  

Drilling was guided using the MS and GRA data from th e STMSL system to monitor stratigraphic position and assess mudline targets during operations. During drilling, notes were kept o n core handling (e.g., if core had to be pushed within the liner) an d core quality (e.g., possible flow-in or crushed liner). Correlation s were developed using MS data and refined with NGR data, whic h were collected after thermal equilibrium. Because Expedition 35 6 sediments are hemipelagic, variation was anticipated and observe d between holes. Catwalk notes and VCDs were helpful in determining if the variation was real or the result of drilling disturbances. The correlation was used to generate the splice. As a result of thi s stratigraphic correlation process, several different depth models ar e created. Table T4 and Figure F11 summarize these various IOD P

Note the expansion in depth (affine growth) in the CCSF-A and -D depth scales. The CCSF-B scale corrects fo r this apparent expansion.

depth models. Detailed discussion of the definitions of these dept h scales, and the processes by which they are created, appear below.  

# Composite depth scale  

The initial CSF-A depth scale is based on the length that th e drill string is advanced core by core. This is equivalent to the OD P scale mbsf. The CSF-A scale is inaccurate because of ship heav e (which is not compensated for during APC coring), tidal variation s in sea level (see below), and other sources of error. Before a splic e can be constructed, the cores from the various holes must be stratigraphically correlated with each other. Such correlation transfer s CSF-A depths into a composite depth scale referred to as CCSF-A. The splice that results is known as core composite depth below seafloor, Method D (CCSF-D). Differences between these depth scale s occur because depths to features measured using the individua l CSF-A scales for adjacent holes may be slightly offset from thei r depths in the splice on the CCSF-D scale. These IODP depth scale s are approximately equivalent to the ODP depth scale meters composite depth (mcd) and are further described below.  

The CCSF-A scale is built by assuming that the uppermost sediment (commonly referred to as the “mudline”) in the first core of  a hole is the sediment/water interface. At each site, this selected cor e becomes the “anchor” in the composite depth scale and is usuall y the only one in which depths are the same on both the CSF-A an d CCSF-A scales. From this anchor, core logging data are correlate d among holes by working downsection. For each core in adjacen t holes, a (constant) depth offset, or affine value, chosen to best alig n observed lithologic variations to the equivalent cores in adjacen t holes, is added to the CSF-A depth in sequence downhole. The differential offset is the increase in these affine values between cores. For example, when Core A2 has an affine value of $2\;\mathrm{m}$ and Core A 4 has an affine value of $3\;\mathrm{m}$ , the differential offset between Cores A 2 and A3 is $^{1\,}\mathrm{m}$ .  

During Expedition 356, an initial composite depth scale was created using whole-round GRA and MS measured with a loop senso r from the STMSL. The STMSL measurements were initially taken a t coarse $\left(10\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ resolution immediately after recovery (before thermal equilibration) to provide initial data for the correlators. Correlations based primarily on whole-round GRA and MS data wer e augmented by NGR data from the core logger and digital color parameters $\left(\mathbb{L}^{\ast}\mathbf{a}^{\ast}\mathbf{b}^{\ast}\right)$ measured on the SHMSL and MS data obtaine d with the WRMSL following $4\,\mathrm{~h~}$ of acclimatization and therma l equilibration (see Physical properties). The final CCSF-A scale an d the splice for each site were based on color reflectance $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ and NG R data; however, the STMSL data are retained in the database as a useful check on the final data and because some damaged sections fi t through the STMSL but could not be run on the WRMSL. In som e cases, small depth offsets were found for features within core sections measured by the STMSL and WRMSL; a common cause o f this offset is gas expansion in the cores between the STMSL an d WRMSL measurements. In these cases, attempts were made to define composite depths using the last data measured prior to cor e splitting, but this was not always possible. Some depth mismatche s (typically on the scale of centimeters, but potentially tens of centimeters) may exist between composite depths defined by wholeround sensing and the depths at which particular features appear i n split cores.  

Specific methods for STMSL, WRMSL, and SHMSL measurements are described in Physical properties, and SHIL measurements are described in Lithostratigraphy and sedimentology.  

Most core logging data were collected at 2.5, 5, 10, or $20\;\mathrm{cm}$ intervals, depending on time availability and core flow.  

# Composite depth scale construction  

The core logging data were imported into the specialized shipboard software program Correlator. Correlator enables construction of a composite depth scale for each hole at a given site b y depth-shifting individual cores to maximize the correlation of reproducible features in the core logging data. For hole-to-hole correlations and for plotting results, data were masked to avoi d incorporating anomalous data influenced by edge effects at sectio n boundaries, at core tops, or in voids where no sediment was present; however, all original data were retained in the LIMS database.  

Because of inherent problems associated with the program Correlator, most notably the difficulty of adjusting mistakes and evaluating alternatives, Microsoft Excel was also used for correlation. Offsets were determined by graphic comparison between records, and the resulting offset table was modified to create an affine tabl e suitable for upload to LIMS. Specifically, correlations were evaluated in a graphical display of the offsets in a graph in which eac h core was plotted separately. Additional guidance for the correlatio n was provided by using the recovery plots and CSF-A depth scale o f each hole to constrain the number of possible correlations. The us e of an alternative correlation method (Microsoft Excel) proved to b e a useful in intervals with (1) little variability in the physical properties measured and (2) very repetitive variation in the physical properties. The quality of the correlations was noted based on th e amount of overlap between the connected cores, similarity of th e correlated profiles, variability between cores, and quality of th e cores.  

Depth intervals within cores are not squeezed or stretched; thus , it is not possible to align all the correlative features within each core. Differences between features in different holes may reflect smallscale differences in sedimentation and/or distortion caused by th e coring and archiving processes. For example, the tops of APC core s may be stretched and the bottoms compressed, although this depends on lithology and the extent of lithification. In addition, sediment of unknown age occasionally falls from higher levels in th e borehole onto the tops of cores as they are recovered, and as a resul t the tops of some cores are not reliable. Data from such intervals ar e masked as noted above. Tides, especially at the lower latitude sites, where tidal ranges can reach nearly $3\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , generate further complications in fidelity between CCSF-A depth and actual depth position. Fortunately, the sites most impacted by tides (Sites U1463 an d U1464) were cored during neap tide, so tidal corrections were onl y applied for the mudline shots and not to subsequent downhole piston cores.  

The depth offsets for each core that are necessary to conver t CSF-A depths to the CCSF-A scale are recorded in an affine tabl e for each site. The CCSF-A depth for any point within a core equal s the CSF-A depth plus the affine offset. Correlation at finer resolution is not possible because depth adjustments are applied linearl y to individual cores. At this stage, no adjustments are made in th e length of each core, such as numerically squeezing and stretchin g within cores. Finer scale adjustments of individual cores relative t o the splice (e.g., Hagelberg et al., 1995; Pälike et al., 2005) or relativ e to logging data (e.g., Harris et al., 1995) can be done following th e development of the composite section.  

Ideally, the base of the continuous CCSF-A scale is the botto m of the deepest core recovered from the deepest hole. In practice, however, the base often occurs where core recovery gaps alig n across all holes and below which constructing a splice is impossible. Deeper cores cannot be tied directly into the overlying continuou s CCSF-A scale. These cores are appended, and CCSF-A depths ar e calculated by adding a constant offset, which is usually the larges t affine value from each hole. An exception to this case occurs whe n some cores from two or more holes deeper than the base of th e splice can be correlated with each other, allowing the generation o f a “floating” CCSF-A scale and splice for some intervals deeper tha n the continuous CCSF-A scale.  

The length of the CCSF-A depth scale at a given site is typicall y ${\sim}10\%{-}20\%$ greater than the length of the cored interval in any on e hole as indicated by the CSF-A depth scale. Although the exact reasons for this apparent expansion of the sediment column are no t completely known, it is commonly attributed to rebound followin g release of overburden in the deeper sections, stretching during th e coring process, gas expansion during the core recovery process, an d other factors (Moran, 1997).  

# Splice  

The splice is a composite stratigraphic section representing th e complete record at a site. It is composed of core sections from adjacent holes such that coring gaps or sampling gaps, like those generated by taking IW samples, in one hole are filled with core from a n adjacent hole. The splice does not generally contain coring gaps, and an effort has been made to minimize inclusion of disturbed sections by examining core photographs. The splice guides core sampling for high-resolution studies. Tables and figures in each sit e chapter summarize the intervals from each hole used to construc t the splice. The portion of the CCSF-A depth scale that is applied t o the splice is referred to as the CCSF-D depth scale. Within the splic e sections, CCSF-D is identical to CCSF-A.  

Note, however, that because of stretching and squeezing withi n cores, some features may not correlate precisely between the splic e and samples taken off the splice, even though all samples hav e CCSF-A depths. Therefore, the final composite depth scale, CCSFD, is only formally defined within the primary splice.  

The choice of splice tie points is a somewhat subjective exercise. We constructed the splice by visually determining tie points in th e aligned core profiles in Microsoft Excel. Our method in the construction of a splice followed four rules. First, where possible, w e avoided using the first and last sections of cores, where disturbanc e due to drilling artifacts (even if not apparent in core logging data ) was most likely. Second, we attempted to incorporate those realizations of the stratigraphic section that in our judgment were mos t representative of the holes recovered. Third, we tried to minimiz e tie points (i.e., to use the longest possible sections within individua l cores) in order to simplify sampling. Fourth, we tried to minimiz e use of intervals sampled during the expedition to leave room fo r high-resolution postexpedition sampling in the splice.  

# Tidal effects on coring depth  

Tidal influence on APC shot depth was previously documente d by correlation of affine offset changes and tide height during OD P Leg 202 (Mix, Tiedemann, Blum, et al., 2003). Data on tidal height s at the drill sites were provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology at a $30\;\mathrm{min}$ resolution. Expedition 356 tidal amplitudes var y strongly from the southern sites to the northern sites. Predicte d tidal amplitudes were $<\!1.2\textrm{m}$ at Sites U1459 and U1460, $\sim\!2\textrm{m}$ a t Sites U1461 and U1462, and ${\sim}4\;\mathrm{m}$ at Sites U1463 and U1464 over  a tidal cycle. At Sites U1458–U1460, no tidal corrections were applied. For Sites U1461–U1464, the difference in tidal height was determined relative to the tidal height at the time the mudline core i n Hole A was taken. The Operations Superintendent took the difference into account when placing the mudline cores at the second an d third hole, but tidal height was not taken into account for the subsequent cores in the hole.  

# Age models and sedimentation rates  

Hole summaries were developed using the core data (e.g., MS , NGR, and color reflectance $\mathbf{b}^{\ast}$ ) as a framework for organizing biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic data. Stratigraphic datum s (see Biostratigraphy and micropaleontology and Paleomagnetism) were plotted on the hole summaries, and sedimentation rate s were calculated assuming linear sedimentation between points. Biostratigraphic sampling was not conducted at the same interval s in every hole at each site, and in some cases sampling was only conducted in the section of the hole that differed from the first hole. Site summaries were developed using the synthesis table of biostratigraphic  datums  (see Biostratigraphy  and micropaleontology)  from  multiple  holes;  therefore,  although  sit e summary sedimentation rates follow the same trend, they are usually a bit different from those of the individual holes.
