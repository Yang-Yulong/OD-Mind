# Abstract  

Slow slip events (SSEs) at the northern Hikurangi subductio n margin, New Zealand, are among the best-documented shallo w SSEs on Earth. International Ocean Discovery Program Expeditio n 375 was undertaken to investigate the processes and in situ conditions that underlie subduction zone SSEs at the northern Hikurang i Trough by (1) coring at four sites, including an active fault near th e deformation front, the upper plate above the high-slip SSE sourc e region, and the incoming sedimentary succession in the Hikurang i Trough and atop the Tūranganui Knoll Seamount, and (2) installin g borehole observatories in an active thrust near the deformatio n front and in the upper plate overlying the slow slip source region. Logging-while-drilling (LWD) data for this project were acquired a s part of Expedition 372 (26 November 2017–4 January 2018; see th e Expedition 372 Preliminary Report for further details on the LW D acquisition program).  

Northern Hikurangi subduction margin SSEs recur every 1– 2 years and thus provide an ideal opportunity to monitor deformatio n and  associated  changes  in  chemical  and  physical  propertie s throughout the slow slip cycle. Sampling of material from the sedimentary section and oceanic basement of the subducting plate reveals the rock properties, composition, lithology, and structura l character of material that is transported downdip into the SS E source region. A recent seafloor geodetic experiment raises the possibility that SSEs at northern Hikurangi may propagate all the wa y to the trench, indicating that the shallow thrust fault zone targete d during Expedition 375 may also lie in the SSE rupture area. Hence, sampling at this location provides insights into the composition, physical properties, and architecture of a shallow fault that may hos t slow slip.  

Expedition 375 (together with the Hikurangi subduction LW D component of Expedition 372) was designed to address three fundamental scientific objectives: (1) characterize the state and composition of the incoming plate and shallow plate boundary fault near th e trench, which comprise the protolith and initial conditions for faul t zone rock at greater depth and which may itself host shallow slo w slip; (2) characterize material properties, thermal regime, and stres s conditions in the upper plate above the core of the SSE source region; and (3) install observatories at an active thrust near the deformation front and in the upper plate above the SSE source t o measure temporal variations in deformation, temperature, and flui d flow. The observatories will monitor volumetric strain (via por e pressure as a proxy) and the evolution of physical, hydrological, an d chemical properties throughout the SSE cycle. Together, the coring, logging, and observatory data will test a suite of hypotheses abou t the fundamental mechanics and behavior of SSEs and their relationship to great earthquakes along the subduction interface.  

# Introduction  

Slow slip events (SSEs) involve transient aseismic slip on a faul t (lasting weeks to years) at a slip velocity intermediate between plat e tectonic rates and those required to generate seismic waves. Onl y since the advent of dense, plate boundary–scale geodetic network s in the last ${\sim}15$ years has the importance of these events as a significant mode of fault slip been recognized. The observation of SSE s and associated seismic phenomena (e.g., tremor and low-frequenc y earthquakes) along subduction megathrusts worldwide (see revie w in Schwartz and Rokosky, 2007) has ignited one of the most dynamic fields of current research in seismology (e.g., Rubinstein e t al., 2010; Peng and Gomberg, 2010; Wech and Creager, 2011). Despite this intense interest, the physical mechanisms that underli e SSEs and the relationship of SSEs to destructive seismic slip on subduction thrusts are poorly known.  

This deficiency in our understanding of SSEs is partly due to th e fact that most well-studied subduction zone SSEs (e.g., Cascadi a and southwest Japan) occur too deep for high-resolution imaging o r direct sampling of the source region. A notable exception is th e northern Hikurangi margin, New Zealand, where well-characterized SSEs occur every 1–2 years over a period of 2–3 weeks a t depths $<\!2{-}15\ \mathrm{km}$ below the seafloor (Wallace and Beavan, 2010; Wallace et al., 2016) (Figure F1). The proximity of SSEs to the seafloor makes it feasible to drill into and sample, collect downhol e logs from, and conduct monitoring in the near field of the SSEs. Th e regularity and well-characterized short repeat interval of the SSE s allow monitoring over multiple SSE cycles, with the potential t o document the spatial and temporal distribution of strain accumulation and release, as well as any associated hydrogeologic phenomena.  

The scientific objectives of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 375 (and allied IODP Expedition 372 ) were threefold:  

• Document the physical, hydrogeological, and chemical properties; lithology; geometry; microstructure; and thermal state of the subduction inputs and an active thrust fault near the trench located near (and possibly within) the shallowest reaches of SSE slip. The inputs include the sediment and upper igneous crust of the subducting Pacific plate, with an emphasis on intervals that host or will eventually host SSEs.   
• Define the stress regime, thermal structure, porosity, permeability, lithology, pore fluid pressure state, fluid chemistry, flow pathways, and structural geology of the upper plate overlying the SSE source region.   
• Install observatories in the upper plate and in an active thrust near the deformation front that span the SSE source region to monitor deformation and changes in temperature and hydrogeology related to SSEs.  

# Background  

# Geological setting  

In the region of the Expedition 375 drilling transect, the Pacifi c plate subducts westward beneath the North Island of New Zealan d along the Hikurangi Trough at $4.5{-}5.5\ \mathrm{cm/y}$ (Wallace et al., 2004 ) (Figure F1). The subducting plate is composed of the Hikurangi Plateau, a Cretaceous large igneous province. The plateau sequence i s overlain by a ${\sim}1\ \mathrm{km}$ thick Cenozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary sequence (Figure F2) that increases to $>\!5\,\mathrm{km}$ in thickness to the sout h (e.g., south of ${\sim}40^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ ). The northern part of the margin is currentl y largely nonaccretionary and locally exhibits frontal tectonic erosio n associated with subducting seamounts (Lewis et al., 1998; Collot e t al., 2001; Pedley et al., 2010). Where accretion does occur, the margin is characterized by a narrow, steeply tapered $\mathrm{^{>}10^{\circ}}$ taper angle ) wedge (Barker et al., 2009). A number of seamounts are present o n the Pacific plate approaching the deformation front (e.g., Tūranganui Knoll and Puke Seamounts). The subduction thrust is identified as a décollement between a relatively less deformed subductin g sequence below and a highly deformed imbricated thrust wedg e above.  

SSEs at the northern Hikurangi margin occur every 18–2 4 months and typically involve $1{-}3\;\mathrm{cm}$ of southeastward surface displacement at continuously operating GPS (cGPS) sites (Figure F1 ) along the coast. The portion of the subduction interface that undergoes slow slip is almost fully locked between the SSEs, and this sli p deficit is mostly or completely recovered by the SSEs (Wallace an d Beavan, 2010). The equivalent moment magnitudes of the larges t SSEs are typically Mw 6.5–7.0, with average slip of ${\sim}7\mathrm{-}20\,\mathrm{cm}$ on th e plate interface. These larger SSEs are punctuated by more frequen t smaller events (one or more per year) that are not as well characterized (see GPS time series inset in Figure F1). SSE slip in this area i s predominantly offshore, and the events appear to repeatedly rupture similar areas of the interface (Wallace and Beavan, 2010). A recent seafloor geodetic experiment has shown that slow slip occur s to within $\leq\!2\ \mathrm{km}$ of the seafloor along the Expedition 375 drillin g transect, and it is possible that slow slip continues all the way to th e trench (Wallace et al., 2016).  

Multichannel seismic data reveal that the source areas of som e SSEs (between ${<}5$ and ${>}10{-}16\,\mathrm{km}$ depth) correspond to the top of  a thick high-amplitude reflectivity zone (HRZ) at the plate interfac e (Figures F1, F2) (Bell et al., 2010). The high-amplitude reflectivit y has been hypothesized to result from undercompaction and hig h fluid pressures in sediments entrained between downgoing seamounts. Alternatively, the reflectors may represent lithologic packages (e.g., altered basaltic lavas or volcaniclastic sediments). If th e former interpretation is correct, then the inferred correlation between the HRZ and a subset of the SSEs would support the idea tha t fluid pressure is associated with the generation of slow slip by reducing effective stress; if the latter interpretation is correct, the correlation  would  suggest  a  compositional  control  on  fault  sli p behavior (e.g., Kodaira et al., 2004; Liu and Rice, 2007; Audet et al., 2009; Song et al., 2009; Saffer and Wallace, 2015).  

# Previous drilling in the region  

No previous scientific drilling has been undertaken at the Hikurangi subduction margin. A total of 44 industry exploration well s have been drilled onshore, ranging in depth from $_{<100}$ to $4352\;\mathrm{m},$ and 3 have been drilled offshore the east coast of the North Island. These wells target the East Coast Basin, which overlies much of th e inner Hikurangi forearc.  

Previous drilling during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 181 targeted the eastern portion of the Hikurangi Plateau (Sites 1123 an d 1124) $\mathord{\sim}900$ and ${\sim}600\ \mathrm{km}$ (respectively) east of the coast of th e North Island of New Zealand. Results of this drilling allow a preliminary correlation of seismic facies (Plaza-Faverola et al., 2012; Ghisetti et al., 2016; Barnes et al., 2018) that suggests the followin g Hikurangi Plateau stratigraphy: (1) a basal sequence of high-velocit y $(>4\ \mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s})$ basaltic rocks; (2) an overlying $3\ \mathrm{km}$ thick Hikurang i Basement Sequence (HKB) interpreted to comprise $120\ \mathrm{Ma}$ volcaniclastics and/or chert or limestone; (3) a late stage $(100{-}90\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) volcanic cone and seamount constructional sequence; (4) a 150–23 0 m thick sedimentary cover sequence comprising an upper sequenc e $(70{-}32\ \mathrm{Ma})$ of nannofossil chalks and mudstones and a possibl e lower sequence $(100{-}70\,\mathrm{Ma})$ of clastic sedimentary rocks; and (5)  a $1000{-}1200\;\mathrm{m}$ thick trench-fill cover sequence of late Cenozoic turbidites, mudstones, and debris flows. At the deformation front beneath Puke Ridge (Figure F2), the subduction décollement i s developed at $\mathord{\sim}5\,\mathrm{km}$ below sea level and ${\sim}2\,\mathrm{km}$ below the seabed i n the upper part of the HKB.  

# Scientific objectives (overall primary and secondary objectives)  

Coring, downhole logging, and long-term observatories installed at the Expedition 375 drill sites were planned to address  a suite of hypotheses regarding slow slip and the mechanics of subduction megathrusts:  

• SSEs propagate to the trench. They are not confined to a specific (narrow) pressure or temperature range.   
• Pore fluid pressure is elevated in the source region of SSEs. The elevated pore pressures are driven by a combination of compaction disequilibrium and mineral dehydration reactions that occur as sediments and altered igneous crust on the incoming plate are buried and heated during subduction.   
• SSEs occur in regions of conditional frictional stability. A single fault patch can exhibit different slip modes (e.g., steady creep, episodic slow slip, or seismic slip) depending on in situ conditions and state.   
• A continuum of duration and magnitude characteristics of SSEs and slow seismic behavior occurs along the shallowest reaches of the subduction megathrust.   
• SSEs drive fluid flow and chemical transport along faults and throughout the upper plate.  

Expeditions 372 and 375 undertook a coordinated program o f logging while drilling (LWD), coring, and observatory installatio n framed around three primary scientific objectives designed to tes t these hypotheses. These scientific objectives are outlined here an d addressed in further detail below:  

• Document the in situ conditions, material properties, and composition of the subduction inputs and the shallow plate boundary near the trench. These rocks comprise the protolith and reveal the initial conditions for fault rocks that are transported into the SSE source zone at greater depth. In the case of the shallow fault zone, these materials may host SSEs if the events propagate to the trench.   
• Characterize the stress regime, temperatures, rock physical properties, lithologies, fluid pressures, fluid geochemistry, flow pathways, and structure of the upper plate above the SSE source.   
• Monitor changes in hydrogeology, temperature, and deformation related to SSEs via two multi-instrument borehole observatories.  

1. Objective 1: characterize the compositional, thermal, hydrogeological, frictional, geochemical, structural, and diagenetic conditions of the subducting material and frontal thrust that may host SSEs.  

Achieving this objective requires characterization of the incoming stratigraphy and upper oceanic basement rocks, together with  a shallow active strand of the frontal thrust system. This characterization involves a combination of coring, downhole measurements, and logging at originally proposed Sites HSM-05A (now Site U1520; sedimentary succession on subducting plate), HSM-08A (now Sit e U1526; seamount on subducting plate), and HSM-15A (now Sit e U1518; thrust fault near the deformation front) (Figure F3), followed by a strategy of coordinated postexpedition laboratory analyses. Site U1518 provides material from an active thrust in the updi p region of the plate interface early in its evolution, at low temperature and low effective stress. If SSEs propagate onto splay faults nea r the deformation front, the fault zone sampled at Site U1518 may undergo slow slip; this possibility will be tested using data from the observatories installed during the expedition. Site U1520 targeted th e sediment package on top of the Hikurangi Plateau. Site U1526 targeted a representative section of the upper portion of the Tūranganui Knoll Seamount, which was thought to be composed o f volcaniclastic sediment or altered basaltic basement.  

LWD data acquired during Expedition 372 at Sites U1518 an d U1520 documented sediment properties and structure and characterized stress orientations through analysis of wellbore failures a t Site U1518 (Pecher et al., 2018). Coring during Expedition 37 5 aimed to collect key samples and data sets for sediment/rock physical properties, pore fluid composition, and downhole temperature, with a focus on hydrogeology and fault mechanical processes. These data define the initial conditions and composition for bot h the subducting crust and interstitial pore fluids, and samples of th e incoming materials will be used for laboratory experimental studie s of rock physical and chemical properties to understand the in sit u properties and their evolution with progressive subduction. Thes e data and postexpedition studies will also yield critical informatio n to refine depth conversion of existing 2-D and 3-D seismic data an d thus to quantitatively extend knowledge of in situ properties an d conditions (stress, fault zone properties, and pore pressure) fro m the boreholes to a broader region (e.g., Tobin and Saffer, 2009). Ultimately, samples and data acquired at Sites U1518, U1520, an d U1526 will constrain (1) the composition and frictional propertie s of subduction inputs and the shallow plate interface, (2) the hydrologic and thermal conditions of the incoming plate and shallo w fault, and (3) the structural character, stress conditions, and mechanical properties of the main active thrust and subduction inputs. Downhole temperature measurements were planned to defin e temperature profiles and, in combination with measurements o f thermal properties on core samples, provide information abou t  

shallow heat flow across the margin. These data will be used to constrain thermal models of the margin that define margin temperatur e structure and thus the thermal, diagenetic, and metamorphic environment of SSEs and to identify potential advective signatures associated with active fluid flow (e.g., Saffer et al., 2008; Peacock, 2009; Saffer and Wallace, 2015).  

2. Objective 2: characterize the properties and conditions in the upper plate overlying the SSE source region.  

LWD resistivity-at-the-bit (RAB) imaging data acquired durin g Expedition 372 at Site U1519 (see Pecher et al., 2018) provide ke y information about fracture and faulting patterns. The data also document borehole breakouts, providing information about the maximum and minimum horizontal stress orientations. In combinatio n with rock physical properties data acquired from cores during Expedition 375, these data can be used to estimate horizontal stres s magnitudes (e.g., Moos and Zoback, 1990; Zoback et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2013; Huffman and Saffer, 2016).  

Core samples from Site U1519 will also enable measurements o f rock elastic and physical properties needed to confidently interpre t observatory data (e.g., Wang and Davis, 1996; Sawyer et al., 2008; Hammerschmidt et al., 2013), to assess the role of upper plate properties in possible triggering of SSEs (e.g., Wallace et al., 2017), and t o define realistic rock properties distributions to inform models o f SSE slip (e.g., Williams and Wallace, 2015). Analysis of pore flui d chemistry allows identification of the source region of fluids in th e hanging wall above and surrounding the SSE region to asses s whether fluids from depth flow upward and escape through th e fractured and structurally disrupted hanging wall and to quantif y flow pathways, rates, and driving forces (e.g., Kopf et al., 2003; Hensen et al., 2004; Ranero et al., 2008).  

3. Objective 3: monitor deformation, hydrogeology, and chemistry via borehole observatories.  

Installation of borehole observatories was planned in an activ e thrust (Site U1518) and in the hanging wall above the source area o f large SSE slip (Site U1519) (Figures F2, F3). The observatory at Sit e U1518 includes multilevel pore fluid pressure sensing above, in, an d below the fault zone, as well as distributed temperature sensing using a string of 30 temperature sensing data loggers (Figures F4, F5) . Time series of fluid flow rates and fluid geochemistry in the faul t zone interval will be collected using OsmoSamplers and an OsmoFlowmeter (Jannasch et al., 2004; Solomon et al., 2009). The observatory at Site U1519 involves a simpler design (Figure F4) with tw o levels of formation pressure sensing and a distributed string of 1 5 temperature loggers. Both observatories incorporate pressure sensing at the wellhead to provide a seafloor reference for the downhol e pressure sensors to allow removal of oceanographic signals; th e wellhead sensors also provide data to resolve vertical deformatio n of the seafloor (e.g., Wallace et al., 2016).  

The main goals of the observatories are as follows:  

1. Monitor temporal variations in pore fluid pressure, temperature, fluid geochemistry, and flow rate in the shallow fault zone, hanging wall, and footwall of an active thrust fault near the deformation front (Site U1518), as well as pressure and temperature in the hanging wall further landward (Site U1519), through several SSE cycles. These data will quantify ambient pore pressure, provide information about potential links between hydraulic and geochemical transients and SSEs, and constrain the source region of fluids associated with SSEs (e.g., Solomon et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2011).   
2. Determine ambient temperatures to better constrain the thermal regime of slow slip.   
3. Determine formation hydraulic and elastic properties using tidal and other oceanographic loading (e.g., Kinoshita et al., 2018).   
4. Integrate pore pressure changes (as a direct proxy for volumetric strain) in a broader framework of deformation monitoring from an existing onshore cGPS network and seafloor sensors to constrain the spatial and temporal distribution of slip during SSEs (e.g., Araki et al., 2017).  

# Site summaries  

# Site U1518  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1518 is located on the lower continental slope near th e trench and ${\sim}73\,\mathrm{km}$ from shore in ${\sim}2630\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figures F2, F3; Table T1). This site is located on the forelimb of an anticlin e formed by an active thrust branching from the plate interface (Figure F2). The thrust is thought to accommodate a component o f plate motion in this portion of the Hikurangi margin, and it is possible that it hosts SSEs. Expedition 372 collected LWD data in Hole s U1518A and U1518B in December 2017 (Pecher et al., 2018). Coring at Site U1518 during Expedition 375 was planned to exten d through the active thrust near the deformation front, terminatin g $150{-}200\ \mathrm{m}$ into the footwall of the fault (Figure F2). Drilling wa s expected to encounter accreted Pleistocene trench-fill sediment s comprising sand and mud turbidites, ash, and mass transport deposits (MTDs) in both the hanging wall and footwall. The primar y objectives at this site were (1) coring to total depth with the highes t priority of sampling the lower ${\sim}100\;\mathrm{m}$ of the hanging wall, the faul t zone, and the footwall of the thrust (including additional possibl e deeper subsidiary faults suggested on the basis of seismic and LW D data) and (2) installing a subseafloor observatory to monito r changes throughout the slow slip cycle in and surrounding the faul t zone.  

The main scientific objectives of coring at Site U1518 were t o define the structures and deformation, physical properties, lithology and composition, and interstitial fluid geochemistry of the active thrust fault and surrounding sediments. Coring results wer e used in combination with LWD data to define the depth interval fo r observatory pore pressure monitoring and geochemical sampling i n the fault zone and to select optimal locations for pore pressur e monitoring in the hanging wall and footwall. The observatory wil l monitor formation pore pressure changes (as a proxy for volumetri c strain) (e.g., Wang, 2004; Davis et al., 2004, 2009; Araki et al., 2017 ) and the evolution of physical, hydrological, thermal, and chemica l properties and conditions throughout the slow slip cycle using  a string of temperature sensors and an OsmoSampler and OsmoFlowmeter installed in the fault zone (e.g., Jannasch et al., 2003; Solomon et al., 2009).  

Key foci for postexpedition studies on core samples include bu t are not limited to the following:  

• Structural analyses to characterize deformation mechanisms and style, as well as fracture and fault orientations (e.g., Byrne et al., 2009); • Laboratory measurements of fault and wall rock rheology and friction to test hypotheses linking fault constitutive properties to slip behavior (e.g., Saffer and Wallace, 2015; Leeman et al.,   
2016); • Geomechanical and thermal properties measurements to define poroelastic, strength, and heat transport properties of the formation to guide interpretation of observatory data (e.g., Wang,   
2004; Sawyer et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2009; Kinoshita et al.,   
2018); and • Strength, permeability, and elastic moduli measurements to provide context for the interpretation of borehole failures as indicators of in situ stress magnitude, parameterization of deformation and hydrologic models, and core-log-seismic integration.  

# Operations  

Transit to Site U1518  

The R/V JOIDES Resolution departed from Timaru (New Zealand) at $0728\,\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}+13\,\mathrm{h})$ ) on 11 March 2018 and arrived at Sit e U1518 (proposed Site HSM-15A) at $1900\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 March.  

# Holes U1518C and U1518D  

Hole U1518C $38^{\circ}51.5692^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}53.7616^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; 2631.7 meters below sea level [mbsl]) was spudded at $0905\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 March 2018 wit h an advanced piston corer/extended core barrel (APC/XCB) bottomhole assembly (BHA). A full core barrel was retrieved following  a partial stroke, and the hole was abandoned to attempt another mudline core. The bit was raised $3\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , and Hole U1518D $\langle38^{\circ}51.5699^{\prime}\mathrm{S};$ , $178^{\circ}53.7634^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 2628.2 mbsl; 2638.9 meters below rig floor [mbrf] ) was spudded at $1020\;\mathrm{h}$ . Another full core barrel was retrieved, an d this hole was also abandoned.  

# Hole U1518E  

The vessel was offset $5\;\mathrm{m}$ north, the bit was raised another $3\;\mathrm{m}_{}$ , and Hole U1518E was spudded at $1125\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 14 March 201 8 $38^{\circ}51.5669^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}53.7618^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; 2626.1 mbsl). Cores 1H–32X penetrated from 0 to 175.6 meters below seafloor (mbsf) and recovere d $160.96\mathrm{~m~}$ $92\%$ recovery). Advanced piston corer temperature tool (APCT-3) formation temperature measurements were taken wit h Cores 4H, 6H, 8H, $10\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and 14F. The decision was made to switc h to coring with the rotary core barrel (RCB) after discovering that th e cutting shoe used with Core 31X had been destroyed after it took 8 0 min to advance $3.6\;\mathrm{m}$ while cutting Core 32X.  

# Hole U1518F  

The vessel was offset $5\,\textrm{m}$ south. Hole U1518F $38^{\circ}51.5694^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $178^{\circ}53.7619^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; 2626.1 mbsl) was spudded at $0135~\mathrm{h}$ on 17 Marc h 2018 with an RCB BHA and was advanced without coring to 197. 7 mbsf. Cores 2R–32R penetrated from 197.7 to 494.9 mbsf and recovered $126.82\textrm{m}$ ( $43\%$ recovery). Coring was terminated so tha t observatory operations could start.  

# Hole U1518G  

In preparation for installing the observatory, we predrilled Hol e U1518G. The vessel was offset $35\;\mathrm{m}$ north of Hole U1518F (and ${\sim}5$ m south of Hole U1518B). A BHA with a $14\%$ inch drill bit was lowered to the seafloor, Hole U1518G $38^{\circ}51.5505^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}53.7617^{\prime}\mathrm{E};$ $2629.8\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was spudded at $1050\,\mathrm{h}$ on 20 March 2018, and the hol e was advanced without coring to 433 mbsf. Next, a reentry cone an d mud skirt were released from the moonpool and allowed to free-fall down the drill string to the seafloor.  

The first stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying an ACORK. Between $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 22 March and $1700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 3 March, we assembled a $422\,\mathrm{m}$ long ACORK casing string consistin g of $10\%$ inch casing, three joints with pressure screens, and an umbilical with three $\%$ inch diameter tubes secured on the outside o f the casing. The umbilical tubes were terminated at the three screen s centered at 393, 323, and 218 mbsf to monitor pressure below, in, and above the fault zone, respectively. Next, we assembled a drillin g assembly inside the ACORK casing composed of a $9\%$ inch drill bit, an underreamer with its arms set to $14\%$ inches, and a mud moto r to rotate the bit and underreamer in isolation from the casing. Finally, the umbilical tubes were connected to the valves and logger s on the ACORK wellhead, and the entire ACORK assembly was lowered to the seafloor on 24 March. During our attempt to reente r Hole U1518G, unexpected heave caused the drill bit to hit the reentry cone at $1215~\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , which resulted in the cone and its base bein g offset ${\sim}3{-}5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ from the hole, making reentry into the predrille d hole impossible.  

# Hole U1518H observatory  

Because the underreamer and drill bit were inside the ACOR K casing and the entire assembly was already at the seafloor, the decision was made to drill in the ACORK assembly at the new location. Hole U1518H ( $38^{\circ}51.5402^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}53.7642^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 2631.1 mbsl) was spudded at $1245~\mathrm{h}$ on 24 March 2018 and reached a total depth of 42 6 mbsf. Once the ACORK landed in the reentry cone, we deployed  a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) platform and a free-fall funnel o n top of the ACORK body. The ACORK casing was reentered an d cleaned of cuttings on 26 March before a bridge plug was installe d on 27 March at 421 mbsf inside the ACORK casing to seal its interior from the formation.  

The second stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying a CORK-II inside the ACORK, but operations were interrupted on 28 March while we waited for the R/V Tangaroa t o deliver replacement seals. During this period we relocated to Sit e U1520 to drill in a reentry system in advance of coring there late r during the expedition. We resumed operations in Hole U1518H o n 31 March by assembling the $412\,\textrm{m}$ long CORK-II casing strin g composed of $4\%$ inch drill pipe, two swellable packer joints, on e “quadrant seal” joint carrying the seat for the OsmoSampler package, drill collars, and a bullnose. The CORK-II wellhead was attached on 1 April, and the entire assembly was lowered to th e seafloor until it reentered the ACORK funnel and the CORK-I I wellhead reached ${\sim}17\,\mathrm{m}$ above the ACORK funnel.  

The third stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying the temperature sensors and OsmoSampler package insid e the CORK-II casing string. On 1 April, we assembled the $407\,\mathrm{m}$ lon g instrument string consisting of 3 segments of Spectra rope carryin g a total of 23 temperature sensing data loggers, the ${\sim}22~\mathrm{m}$ long OsmoSampler package with an additional 7 temperature sensing dat a loggers inside, 3 weak links, 4 sinker bars, and a top plug. The instrument string was deployed with the logging wireline. At $2105~\mathrm{h}$ on 1 April, the OsmoSampler package landed in the CORK-II seat a t 323 mbsf, followed by the top plug latching inside the CORK-I I wellhead. Once the instrument string was released, the CORK-I I landed inside the ACORK wellhead at $_{0020\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 2 April, completin g the observatory installation in Hole U1518H. The time spent at Sit e U1518 was 13.22 days.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

At Site U1518, we identified three lithostratigraphic units, tw o of which (Units I and III) were divided into two subunits (Figur e F6). All three units are Quaternary in age. Sediment compositio n and texture are consistent throughout Holes U1518E and U1518F, with a background of silty clay(stone) or mud(stone) alternatin g with thin beds of silt(stone) to silty sand(stone). The distinction s among lithostratigraphic units are based largely on the character o f coarser beds inferred to be turbidites and soft-sediment deformation features that are inferred to be MTDs.  

The uppermost $2.2~\mathrm{m}$ of Core 375-U1518E-1H consists of unconsolidated Holocene mud. Subunit IA begins below this mud an d extends to 197.7 mbsf. Sediment from Section 1H-CC has an ag e ${>}0.54\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , and porosity is lower than expected for the current dept h of burial (Figure F7). We therefore consider some of the origina l stratigraphic section to be missing due to submarine slides or othe r forms of mass wasting after frontal accretion. The normally grade d beds range in grain size from sandy silt to silty sand and very fin e sand. We surmise that relatively dilute turbidity currents were interspersed with background settling of suspended sediment on th e trench floor of the Hikurangi Trough. Felsic ash layers also occur i n the uppermost $44~\mathrm{m}$ , and they were probably deposited by air fall. Subunit IB extends from 197.7 to $304.5~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , is characterized b y sparse and thinner $\left(<\!10\;\mathrm{cm}\right)$ beds of normally graded siltstone, an d its upper boundary is gradational. The position of the subuni t boundary coincides with the bottom of the zone that was not cored.  

Unit II extends from 304.5 to 370.4 mbsf, and its upper boundary matches a significant change in biostratigraphy defined by  a thrust-related age inversion with older hanging wall $(>\!0.54\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ove r younger footwall $(<\!0.54\mathrm{\Ma})$ sediments. We designated this material as a separate lithostratigraphic unit on the basis of a sharp reduction in the number of silty turbidites and a subtle change i n color to lighter greenish gray mudstone. The mudstone in Unit I I alternates with thin but sparse layers of siltstone, sandy siltstone, and mud-rich nannofossil ooze.  

Unit III begins at 370.4 mbsf and extends to the base of Hol e U1518F (492.4 mbsf). This unit is composed of mudstone with thi n beds of normally graded siltstone and sandy siltstone and was deposited by turbidity currents and hemipelagic settling in a trenchfloor environment. The most distinctive characteristic of Unit III i s soft-sediment deformation, similar in many respects to what ha s been described in MTDs from comparable depositional environments elsewhere (e.g., the Nankai Trough). Subunits IIIA and III B are based on a change in the frequency of the MTD-type features a t 475.7 mbsf. The amount of soft-sediment deformation decrease s significantly in Subunit IIIB; intricate varieties of bioturbation become more widespread and diverse below the subunit boundary.  

Broad facies-level comparisons (i.e., packets of beds at a $10+\,\mathrm{m}$ scale) can be made between the lithostratigraphy defined from cor e descriptions and the provisional log-based stratigraphy defined i n Holes U1518A and U1518B (Pecher et al., 2018). Six logging unit s were defined for Site U1518 during Expedition 372. The loggin g unit designations were based on attributes that change in respons e to deformation structures and physical properties, in addition t o lithology and bed thickness. Closely spaced oscillations in resistivity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), porosity, and gamma ra y measurements from logging Units 2 and 3 are consistent with thinl y bedded and uniformly fine grained sediments in lithostratigraphi c Unit I. Lithostratigraphic Unit II (304.53–370.4 mbsf) likely represents comparable lithologies to those in the lower parts of loggin g Subunit 3C (229–320.7 mbsf) and logging Unit 4 (320.7–346 mbsf). The top boundary of lithostratigraphic Unit II is based largely o n the inversion of biostratigraphy rather than a change in lithology, which cannot be detected by logging. In contrast, the lithostratigraphic Unit III top and bottom boundaries do not match ver y closely to the boundaries for logging Units 5 and 6 or their subunits, likely because different sets of criteria were used to define subunits. Recognition of lithostratigraphic Unit III is based largely on an increase in syndepositional deformation in the form of contorted domains, which are interpreted to be MTD-type deposits. In contrast, the designations for logging units rely mainly on changes in physical properties, along with caliper records suggestive of washouts.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Planktonic foraminifer and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy indicates that the sedimentary sequence recovered at Sit e U1518 is Holocene to early Pleistocene. Because of high sedimentation rates $(\sim\!3\;\mathrm{m/ky})$ , shipboard paleontological sampling achieved  a temporal resolution of $1.5{-}3\ \mathrm{ky}$ from half-length APC (HLAPC ) and full-length APC cores.  

The base of the Holocene was identified between 2.02 and 2.3 3 mbsf. The underlying section to 297.0 mbsf is dated to the middl e Pleistocene, whereas the sediments from 306.95 to 492.38 mbsf ar e dated to the middle Pleistocene or younger, and represent an age reversal at the thrust fault, as described below (see Structural geology) (Figure F6).  

Midbathyal benthic foraminifer markers occur throughout th e sedimentary sequence, and very rare lower bathyal markers occur i n a few samples below 306.95 mbsf. The absence of lower bathyal markers in most samples is unexpected, given that the site wa s drilled at a water depth of $2626\ \mathrm{m},$ , suggesting that the bulk of th e sedimentary sequence has been reworked downslope from midbathyal water depths or shallower. Downslope reworking is supported by the presence of common inner to midshelf taxa in som e samples.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Routine paleomagnetic analysis included natural remanen t magnetization (NRM) measurement of archive-half sections prio r to and following stepwise alternating field (AF) demagnetization t o a peak field of $30~\mathrm{mT}$ . Interpretation of the paleomagnetic result s was compromised by the diagenesis of the primary magnetic mineral phases and extensive tectonic deformation. Some cores also experienced  core  disturbance  that  resulted  in  the  complet e destruction of any depositional remanence. All XCB cores were affected by significant drilling-induced overprints that could not b e removed during routine demagnetization of the archive-half sections. More extensive AF and thermal demagnetization experiments  were  conducted  on  discrete  specimens  to  aid  ou r interpretation.  

Inclination records show that the entire sequence recovered a t Site U1518 is most likely of normal polarity, despite an interval between 220 and 270 mbsf in which the polarity remains unresolved. Based on biostratigraphic observations, we place the paleomagneti c record in the Brunhes Normal Chron (C1n).  

Rock magnetic analyses included determination of the magneti c coercivity distribution based on AF demagnetization, isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition, and magnetic susceptibilit y measurement. Inferences about the blocking temperature $(T_{\mathrm{b}})$ distribution of individual samples were drawn from the thermal demagnetization behavior. We tentatively identified at least tw o magnetic mineral phases. The first is a low coercivity $\left(\leq50\,\mathrm{mT}\right)$ ) mineral that we suggest is Ti-magnetite. During AF demagnetizatio n experiments, the majority of our samples were affected by th e growth of a gyroremanent magnetization at treatment steps highe r than $50\;\mathrm{mT}$ that we attribute to the presence of secondary greigite.  

# Structural geology  

Cores from Hole U1518E are characterized by sediments wit h gently to moderately dipping beds, although significant drilling-induced deformation in the APC and XCB cores prevents detaile d structural observations. RCB cores from Hole U1518F preserve  a suite of deformation structures that span a main thrust fault spanning from 304.5 to 322.4 mbsf and a subsidiary fault that extend s from 351.2 to 361.7 mbsf.  

Gently to steeply dipping beds, locally overturned, were observed in the hanging wall. Bedding dip trends in the hanging wal l (Figure F7) generally agree well with LWD-derived bedding dips. These beds are crosscut by moderately to steeply dipping fracture s that increase in frequency with depth toward the fault zone. Norma l faults with centimeter-scale displacements are also preserved a t scattered locations throughout the sequence.  

The main fault zone includes an upper, primarily brittle faul t zone extending to 315.3 mbsf and a lower zone of dominantly ductile deformation below that extends to 322.4 mbsf. This interval i s characterized by intense brecciation, discrete fractures, and the occurrence of ductile deformation zones. Several of the apparentl y ductilely deformed zones are overprinted by brittle structures. Deformation intensity decreases gradually toward the base of the faul t zone (Figure F7). The ductile deformation is likely a composite o f tectonic, synsedimentary, and slope processes.  

The footwall of the main fault zone is characterized by relativel y undeformed hemipelagic sediments with modest and relatively constant dip angles and is cut by a few normal faults and fractures. Thi s package hosts another zone of more intense deformation and brecciation, indicating a second (subsidiary) fault spanning from 351. 2 to 361.7 mbsf. There is no clear change in lithology across the second fault. Below this zone, bedding dips are generally gentle an d also in good agreement with LWD-derived bedding dips, and deformation structures are few.  

Fractures and borehole breakouts can be observed at variou s depths in the Site U1518 LWD image logs acquired during Expedition 372 (Pecher et al., 2018). Significant fracture clusters were observed between 170 and $230\ \mathrm{mbsf},$ between 315 and 321 mbsf (at  a comparable depth, although slightly deeper than those observed i n the main fault zone in Hole U1518F; Figure F7), and between 43 6 and 444 mbsf. These clusters include a mix of conductive and resistive fractures, and overall they exhibit a preferred northwest–southeast strike. Borehole breakouts were observed at 536 and 550 mbs f and are oriented approximately north–south, indicating an east– west maximum horizontal principal stress $\left\lvert S_{\mathrm{Hmax}}\right\rangle$ direction.  

# Geochemistry  

We collected 82 whole-round (WR) samples for pore wate r chemical analyses at Site U1518. Samples were collected on the catwalk at a frequency of six WR samples per core from the seafloor t o 17.9 mbsf, three WR samples per core from 17.9 to 27 mbsf, and on e to two WR samples per core from 27 to 494.9 mbsf. Each core collected deeper than 30 mbsf was scanned with an infrared (IR) camera to identify cold anomalies indicative of potential methan e hydrate. The majority of WR samples for interstitial water analyse s were located away from the IR anomalies to define backgroun d chemical profiles not impacted by methane hydrate dissociatio n during core recovery. A small subset of samples co-located with th e IR cold anomalies were analyzed to quantify methane hydrate saturations based on the deviation of dissolved chloride concentration s from the background profile. Drilling fluid was also analyzed as par t of the shipboard geochemical program to identify potential contamination; below the sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ), sulfate is depleted in the pore water and any sulfate present in  a sample is interpreted to be the result of contamination. Based o n $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ concentrations below the SMTZ, we corrected all pore wate r species in each sample for drilling contamination.  

The pore fluid chemical profiles at Site U1518 reflect the combined effects of microbially mediated organic matter degradation, authigenic carbonate precipitation, volcanic ash alteration, and silicate mineral diagenesis. Sulfate concentrations decrease approximately linearly from $28.1~\mathrm{mM}$ at 1.5 mbsf to below detection limi t $(0.1\mathrm{~mM})$ at ${\sim}8$ mbsf. The SMTZ is marked by a concomitant increase in headspace methane concentrations from 51 to 5461 part s per million by volume (ppmv). The SMTZ is shallower at this sit e than at nearby IODP Site U1517 (drilled during Expedition 37 2 [Pecher et al., 2018]), which likely indicates a larger vertical methane flux. Ethane was detected in some headspace samples shallowe r than 200 mbsf, but was not detected deeper. The methane is microbial in origin, with $C_{1}/C_{2}$ ratios ${>}20{,}000$ .  

Alkalinity, ammonium, bromide, and phosphate concentratio n profiles also reflect organic matter diagenesis with peaks in lithostratigraphic Subunit IA, followed by a decrease in Subunit IB. Th e fault zone coincides with a repetition of the diagenetic sequence i n the footwall with a second peak in alkalinity, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations in lithostratigraphic Unit III. Based on the deviation of Cl concentrations from the background concentratio n profile, we identified the presence of methane hydrates in six W R samples.  

Chloride, potassium, and sodium concentrations increase wit h depth and reach concentration maxima at ${\sim}60$ mbsf in Subunit IA. Likewise, silica, lithium, and strontium concentrations steadily increase in Subunit IA and then decrease between the top of Subuni t IB and the top of the fault zone at $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf. Subunit IA sediment s contain several volcanic ash layers and disseminated ash and hav e elevated K-feldspar concentrations. The increase in pore water Cl, alkali metal, and strontium concentrations in this unit likely reflect s ongoing alteration of rhyolitic ash and K-feldspar to authigenic hydrous aluminosilicate minerals. Similar to the geochemical tracer s of organic matter diagenesis discussed above, a clear repetition o f the ash/silicate mineral diagenetic sequence occurs at the faul t zone.  

Solid phase analyses yielded $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ values ranging from 2.1 t o $23.1\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations are generall y low and range from 0.1 to $0.88\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . C/N ratios range from 0.85 t o 15.80 (average $=\,6.84\$ ). Localized peaks in the $C/\Nu$ ratio occur i n Unit II, suggesting some heterogeneity in organic matter sources i n this depth interval.  

# Physical properties  

An abrupt change in physical properties occurs between 0 an d 50 mbsf in Hole U1518E, including a shift to lower porosity values, concomitant higher bulk densities, and higher $P$ -wave velocities. Deeper than 50 mbsf, all physical properties remain nearly constan t with depth, with a few distinct exceptions (Figure F7). The dept h trends of bulk density, porosity, $P$ -wave velocity, undrained shea r strength, and natural gamma ray measured in the cores are generally less pronounced than the trends in LWD bulk density, neutro n porosity, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity, and gamma ray data.  

Porosity decreases from $65\%$ to $50\%$ in the top $50\,\mathrm{m}$ . Between 5 0 and 495 mbsf, porosity is nearly constant and ranges from $40\%$ t o $50\%$ (Figure F7). $P$ -wave velocity is ${\sim}1500\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ near the seafloor an d increases rapidly to $1600\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at 2 mbsf. Between 2 and 12 mbsf, $P_{-}$ - wave velocity is approximately constant at $1600~\mathrm{m/s}$ followed by  a gradual increase to $1950\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ at $150\;\mathrm{mbsf}$ . Deeper than 238 mbsf, $P_{-}$ - wave velocity values are scattered and range from $\mathord{\sim}1500$ to $\mathord{\sim}2000$ $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ . Undrained shear strength increases with depth (albeit with significant scatter) to an average of $120{-}200\,\mathrm{kPa}$ at 200–280 mbsf an d decreases to an average of $60{-}100~\mathrm{kPa}$ by 300 mbsf. Deeper tha n 450 mbsf, the strength values increase again (with significant scatter) to values as high as $400{-}500\;\mathrm{kPa}$ .  

Natural gamma radiation (NGR) values range from 6 to 6 3 counts/s, with an average of 42 counts/s. NGR values increase rapidly from ${<}25$ counts/s at the seafloor to 40 counts/s at 2 mbsf an d remain nearly constant with depth. Magnetic susceptibility value s are correlated with the lithostratigraphic units. The interval between 2 and 176 mbsf (in lithostratigraphic Subunit IA) is characterized by zones of low magnetic susceptibility values and littl e scatter with average values of $11\times10^{-5}$ to $14\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ (at 2–12, 40– 60, and $75{-}109\ \mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and intervening zones of high magnetic susceptibility values and high scatter with average values of $22\times10^{-5}$ t o $25\,\times\,10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ (at 13–40, 60–75, and $109{-}176~\mathrm{mbsf}\,)$ ). Between 197. 7 and 462 mbsf, from the top of Subunit IB to the bottom of Subuni t IIIA, magnetic susceptibility values exhibit some scatter, rangin g from $10\times10^{-5}$ to $20\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI},$ but less than the scatter observed i n Subunit IA. Susceptibility shifts to a lower average value of $13\times10^{-5}$  

SI at 466 mbsf and remains constant to 495 mbsf (in Subunit IIIB). Thermal conductivity is relatively constant with depth, with an average value of $1.38\pm0.10\:\mathrm{W/(m{\cdot}K)}$ .  

# Downhole measurements  

Five formation temperature measurements were made with th e APCT-3 shoe in Hole U1518E with Cores 4H, 6H, 8H, $10\mathrm{H}$ , and 14F. Although all five measurements are high quality, an offset occur s between the three measurements taken with one sensor and the tw o taken with another sensor. We estimate a thermal gradient o f $0.035^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}$ using three equilibrium temperatures from one of thes e tools. The vertical conductive heat flow computed as the product o f the thermal gradient and thermal conductivity is $48~\mathrm{mW/m^{2}}$ . Th e temperature over the depth window corresponding to the mai n fault zone is estimated to be $12^{\circ}{-}13^{\circ}C$ .  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

LWD data acquired during Expedition 372 in Holes U1518A an d U1518B were correlated with core-based observations and physical properties measurements from Holes U1518E and U1518F and wit h seismic reflection data across the holes drilled at Site U1518. Thes e different data sets detect variations in physical properties, lithology, and structure at a range of scales. LWD $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity and densit y measurements were combined with density measurements from th e cores to develop a synthetic seismic trace to correlate the LWD, core, and seismic data. The synthetic seismic trace using the LW D data correctly predicts moderate-amplitude reflections in the uppe r 80 mbsf, low-amplitude reflections to $\mathord{\sim}300$ mbsf, and a package o f high-amplitude reflections between 300 and 400 mbsf (Figure F7).  

However, a significant reduction in LWD density and velocit y around 322 mbsf (see Pecher et al., 2018) produced a high-amplitude reversed polarity reflection in our synthetics that is $\mathord{\sim}15\mathrm{{-}}20\;\mathrm{m}$ too deep relative to the observed high-amplitude reversed polarit y reflection in seismic Profile 05CM-04 at the Hole U1518F location. This high-amplitude reflection separates truncated dipping reflections above from continuous parallel reflections below. Physical properties values from cores show a reduction in density aroun d 300–315 mbsf, shallower than that observed in the LWD data (Figure F7). Together, the core and seismic data suggest that the faul t zone in the Hole U1518F cored section lies $15{-}26\;\mathrm{m}$ shallower tha n the same change in properties identified in the Hole U1518B LW D data. This suggestion is supported by a better matching syntheti c seismic trace when the LWD reduction in density and velocity i s shifted $15\,\mathrm{~m~}$ shallower (Figure F7). The difference in fault zon e depth between Holes U1518F and U1518B (located ${\sim}40\;\mathrm{m}$ apart) i s likely due to thrust fault geometry.  

# Site U1519  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1519 is located on the upper continental slope ${\sim}38~\mathrm{km}$ from shore in ${\sim}1000\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth at the landward edge of a midslope sedimentary basin (Figures F2, F3; Table T1). On the basis o f regional stratigraphic and seismic interpretations prior to drilling, we expected to intersect $260{-}270\,\mathrm{~m~}$ of horizontally layered lat e Quaternary basin fill comprising MTDs and layered sequences, including probable turbidites, underlain by a Plio–Pleistocene slop e sequence of MTDs and layered sequences also about $260{-}270\mathrm{~m~}$ thick dipping to the southeast. The base of this sequence is marke d by an apparent erosional unconformity identified in the seismic reflection data at $\mathord{\sim}540$ mbsf. Beneath the unconformity, we expecte d to penetrate Miocene sedimentary rocks (equivalent to the Tolag a  

Group exposed onshore) in seismically reflective landward-dippin g strata (Figure F2). LWD in Hole U1519A during Expedition 37 2 penetrated to 650 mbsf and documented a change in physical properties at the interpreted depth of the unconformity (Pecher et al., 2018). A bottom-simulating reflector (BSR) was identified at ${\sim}570$ mbsf.  

The primary objective at Site U1519 was the installation of a n observatory to monitor formation pressure changes as a proxy fo r volumetric strain and temperature changes throughout multipl e SSE cycles. The observatory includes two levels of pressure sensin g via hydraulic lines that terminate in screens at 124 and 264 mbsf. Temperature sensing is achieved by a string of 15 distributed temperature sensing data loggers. Drilling at Site U1519 during Expedition 375 also included RCB coring in discrete intervals (108–163.6, 250–288.4, and 520–640 mbsf; Hole U1519C) and APC coring fro m the seafloor to 85.8 mbsf (Holes U1519D and U1519E). The mai n coring objective at this site was to provide information about roc k physical properties, composition, and structural geology and deformation in the upper plate above the SSE source region. APCT- 3 measurements of temperature in Holes U1519D and U1519E defin e a temperature gradient and provide key constraints on the therma l regime of the slow slip source region. Pore fluid geochemistry dat a provide insights into diagenetic processes and potential sources an d flow pathways of fluid sampled in the hanging wall.  

One key focus for postexpedition studies on core samples will b e geomechanical measurements to define poroelastic and strengt h properties of the formation. These data will be essential for interpretation of observatory data, such as calibrating the use of por e pressure as a proxy for volumetric strain (e.g., Wang, $2004;$ Araki e t al., 2017). Similarly, strength, permeability, and elastic moduli measurements will provide important context for the interpretation o f borehole failures as indicators of in situ stress magnitude (e.g., Chang et al., 2010; Huffman and Saffer, 2016), parameterization o f hydrological models, and core-log-seismic integration. Therma l properties measurements will be used in combination with observatory temperature data to define heat flow and to interpret therma l transients in the context of heat conduction and possible advection.  

# Operations  

Transit to Site U1519  

We arrived at Site U1519 (proposed Site HSM-01A) at $1810~\mathrm{h}$ $(\mathrm{UTC}+12\,\mathrm{h})$ on 13 April 2018 after waiting on weather in the Ba y of Plenty.  

# Hole U1519B observatory  

In preparation for installing the observatory, we predrilled th e observatory hole. A BHA with a $14\%$ inch drill bit was lowered t o the seafloor. Hole U1519B $(38^{\circ}43.6426^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}36.8655^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 1000. 4 mbsl) was spudded at $0105~\mathrm{h}$ on 14 April 2018 and advanced without coring to 283 mbsf. Next, a reentry cone and mud skirt wer e released from the moonpool and allowed to free-fall down the dril l string to the seafloor.  

The first stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying an ACORK. Between 0115 and $1245~\mathrm{h}$ on April 15, we assembled a $279\;\mathrm{m}$ long ACORK casing string consisting of 22 joint s of $10\%$ inch casing, two casing joints with $2\,\mathrm{m}$ long screens for pressure monitoring, and an umbilical with three $\%$ inch diameter tube s (only two of which were used) secured on the outside of the casing. The umbilical tubes were terminated at the two screens centered a t 264 and 124 mbsf. Next, we assembled a drilling assembly inside th e ACORK casing composed of a $9\%$ inch drill bit, an underreame r with its arms set to $14\%$ inches, and a mud motor to rotate the bi t and underreamer in isolation from the casing. Finally, the umbilical tubes were connected to the valves and loggers on the ACORK wellhead, and the entire ACORK assembly was lowered to the seafloo r at $2130\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 April. Hole U1519B was reentered at $2310\,\mathrm{h},$ and th e ACORK wellhead landed in the reentry cone on the seafloor at 063 5 h on 16 April. Once the ACORK was released, we deployed a freefall funnel on top of the ACORK body. The ACORK casing was reentered with a $9\%$ inch drill bit and cleaned of cuttings on 16 April before a bridge plug was installed on 17 April inside the ACOR K casing at 277 mbsf to seal its interior from the formation below.  

The second stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying a CORK-II inside the ACORK. The $269\mathrm{~m~}$ long CORK-I I casing string consisted of 20 full joints and four pup joints of $4\%$ inch casing, four $6\%$ inch drill collars, and a bullnose. The CORK-I I wellhead was attached, the entire assembly was lowered to the seafloor, and it reentered the ACORK funnel at $_{0120\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on April 18. W e lowered the CORK-II wellhead until it reached a position ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{~m~}$ above the ACORK funnel.  

The third stage of the observatory installation consisted of deploying a string of temperature sensors inside the CORK-II casing. At $0230\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 April, we started assembling the $268~\mathrm{m}$ long instrument string consisting of a top plug, a single segment of Spectr a rope with 15 temperature sensing data loggers, one weak link, an d one sinker bar. The instrument string was deployed using the logging wireline, and the top plug latched inside the CORK-II wellhea d at $0530\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 April. Once the instrument string was released, th e CORK-II landed inside the ACORK wellhead and was released a t $0735\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 April, completing the observatory installation in Hol e U1519B.  

# Hole U1519C  

The primary coring objective at Site U1519 was to sample sediment in the intervals surrounding the ACORK pressure screens, which are centered at 124 and 264 mbsf, and in the sedimentary section from $\mathord{\sim}520$ to 640 mbsf. The vessel was offset $20\;\mathrm{m}$ from Hol e U1519B at a heading of $122^{\circ}$ , and Hole U1519C $(38^{\circ}43.6483^{\prime}\mathrm{S},$ $178^{\circ}36.8773^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $1000.3\,\mathrm{\mbsl}_{\mathrm{}}$ ) was spudded at $1640~\mathrm{h}$ on 18 April 2018. Drilling without coring continued to 108 mbsf until $0600\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 19 April. RCB Cores 2R–7R, 9R–12R, and 14R–26R advanced fro m 108.0 to 640.0 mbsf and recovered $119.17\;\mathrm{m}$ $55\%$ recovery). Intervals 163.6–250.0 and 288.4–518.4 mbsf were drilled without coring. The drill string was recovered at $0815~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 April, and the RC B BHA was put away.  

# Hole U1519D  

The final objective at Site U1519 was to core the shallow sedimentary section and collect in situ temperature measurements wit h the APCT-3. The vessel was offset $10~\mathrm{m}$ at a heading of $122^{\circ}$ , an d Hole U1519D ( $38^{\circ}43.6516^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}36.8831^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $1000.4\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was spudded at $1505\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 April 2018. APC Cores 1H–3H advanced fro m 0 to 23.2 mbsf and recovered $23.64\mathrm{~m~}$ $101\%$ recovery). Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all APC cores. Because coarse unconsolidated material made it difficult to collect in situ temperatur e measurements and resulted in a partial stroke and significant overpull with Core 3H, we started a new hole.  

# Hole U1519E  

The vessel was offset $^{20\,\mathrm{~m~}}$ at a heading of $122^{\circ}$ , and Hol e U1519E $38^{\circ}43.6572^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $178^{\circ}36.8949^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; $1000.3\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ ) was spudded a t $1845\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 April 2018. APC Cores 1H–8H and HLAPC Cores 9F–  

13F advanced from 0 to 85.8 mbsf and recovered $88.75\;\mathrm{m}$ ( $103\%$ recovery). Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all cores. Formation temperature measurements were taken with the APCT-3 fo r Cores 4H–8H, 9F, 11F, and 13F. The time spent at Site U1519 wa s 8.79 days.  

# Principal results  

We identified two lithostratigraphic units at Site U1519 (Figur e F8). Detailed characterization of lithofacies was hampered by larg e coring gaps, poor recovery, and pervasive coring disturbance. Overall, the sedimentary strata range in age from Holocene to early Pleistocene. Common lithologies include mud(stone), silt(stone), an d sand(stone).  

Coring started at the seafloor in Holes U1519D and U1519E an d at 108 mbsf in Hole U1519C, in lithostratigraphic Unit I, which extends to 282.66 mbsf. Cores from this depth range contain a background of dark greenish gray mud and mudstone (silty clay to claye y silt) with variable levels of consolidation. Seismic reflection record s and high-resolution bathymetry are indicative of shallow mas s transport remobilization at Site U1519. However, APC cores fro m Holes U1519D and U1519E reveal no definitive indicators of gravity-driven, soft-sediment deformation in the hemipelagic mud.  

The Unit I/II boundary at 282.66 mbsf displays a noticeabl e change in color from dark greenish gray above to light greenish gra y below, the grain size coarsens somewhat to silt-rich mudstone, an d there is a positive excursion in magnetic susceptibility. Below a 23 0 m gap in coring, mudstone is present with scattered thin interbed s of dark gray sandy siltstone to very fine sandstone. In Cores 375- U1519C-19R, 21R, and 22R, the mudstone displays clear evidenc e of soft-sediment deformation, including convolute laminae, mesoscale folds, dismembered bedding, and clasts of mudstone supported by a mudstone matrix. We interpret the deformed zones t o be intraformational MTDs. The remainder of Unit II consists o f consolidated greenish gray mudstone interbedded with poorly indurated sandy silt and sand, ranging up to coarse sand. Core 23 R contains a distinctive matrix-supported conglomerate with widel y dispersed clasts of mudstone and intact shells of what appear to b e shallow-water fauna.  

# Biostratigraphy  

Calcareous nannofossil and planktonic foraminifer species indicate that the sedimentary sequence recovered at Site U1519 is Holocene to Pleistocene (Figure F8). The base of the Holocene wa s identified between 4.5 and $14.10~\mathrm{mbsf}_{\mathrm{~}}$ ). The underlying section t o 536.41 mbsf, is dated late to middle Pleistocene $(0.009{-}0.62\,\mathrm{Ma})$ , indicating a sedimentation rate of ${\sim}0.84~\mathrm{m/ky}$ . Deeper than 536.41 t o the base of Hole U1519C, the age is poorly constrained but is likel y early Pleistocene or younger $(<\!1.73\,\mathrm{{Ma})}$ .  

Highly variable planktonic foraminifer abundances in the uppe r part of the section $(0{-}536.41\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ fluctuate between outer neriti c and oceanic values. This variability is attributed to downslope reworking, evident from the co-occurrence of inner shelf benthic tax a and shell fragments with midbathyal markers. In the lower part o f the section (546.86–635.65 mbsf), benthic markers indicate deposition in mid–lower bathyal or deeper water depths.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic analyses at Site U1519 were compromised by severe core disturbance that destroyed the depositional remanence i n the majority of cores. We thus only analyzed RCB cores from deepe r than 525 mbsf in Hole U1519C and APC cores from Holes U1519 D and U1519E. Cores 375-U1519C-14R through 26R were subjecte d to stepwise AF demagnetization to peak fields of 30 or $40\;\mathrm{mT}$ . Overprinting of the primary NRM, most likely by diagenetic alteration, and deformation in MTD intervals made it difficult to interpret th e magnetostratigraphy.  

Hole U1519D and U1519E cores were subjected to AF demagnetization to a peak field of $20\;\mathrm{mT},$ , which was sufficient to remove  a small viscous overprint. The NRM directions usually have negativ e inclinations that agree with the directions expected for a normal polarity field. However, the data have not been corrected for core disturbance, and many APC sections were affected by significan t drilling-induced bed drag. As a result, downhole variations in NR M directions do not necessarily reflect temporal variations in the magnetic field during sediment deposition.  

# Structural geology  

Intense drilling disturbance and lack of recovery limited recognition of structural features in cores. However, dip data from LW D measurements conducted during Expedition 372 provide useful context for observations of core structures (Figure F9) (Pecher et al., 2018). Much of the strata at Site U1519 are inclined, although be d dips rarely exceed $50^{\circ}$ in the cored intervals. Steeper beds are recorded in folded strata, which likely represent MTDs. We define d two structural domains based on structures in the core and LW D data. In Domain 1 $(0{-}567.58~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , bedding dips are dominantl y steep, and scattered, steep, dominantly conductive fractures ar e present in the LWD RAB images. Filled fractures are abundant i n the lower recovered interval of Domain 1. Domain 2 (567.58–635. 6 mbsf) coincides with the bottom of lithostratigraphic Unit II and i s defined by a decrease in the number of filled fractures, a slight shallowing of bedding dips in core, and a change in regional dip azimut h from north-northeast toward the north-northwest.  

# Geochemistry  

A total of 100 WR samples were collected and squeezed fo r shipboard and shore-based pore water geochemical analyses. W e collected 31 samples from Hole U1519C RCB cores, 15 sample s from Hole U1519D APC cores, and 54 samples from Hole U1519E. WR samples were collected on the catwalk at a frequency of 6 pe r core in the upper $\mathord{\sim}20$ mbsf and ${\sim}1{-}4$ per core deeper than 20 mbsf.  

The geochemical profiles at Site U1519 reflect the combined effects of organic matter diagenesis, authigenic carbonate precipitation, and silicate mineral/volcanic ash alteration in response t o rapid sedimentation. The pore water sulfate, alkalinity, ammonium, bromide, and phosphate profiles in lithostratigraphic Unit I sho w changes with depth characteristic of organic matter degradation. The shallow pore water sulfate profiles in Holes U1519D an d U1519E are S-shaped, indicating a recent period of rapid sedimentation that is also supported by the alkalinity profile between th e seafloor and the SMTZ. This recent sedimentation event has produced a deeper SMTZ than would be observed under steady-stat e conditions.  

A sharp increase in ammonium, alkalinity, phosphate, and bromide concentrations occurs across the Unit I/II boundary, indicating that a second concentration maxima occurs in Unit II. The exac t depth of this second concentration maxima is unknown because o f the coring gap between 285 and 520 mbsf. The concentrations o f these species, which are related to organic matter diagenesis, remain elevated in the interval from 520 to 635 mbsf but decreas e with depth.  

Dissolved calcium concentrations decrease sharply from 9. 5 mM at 1.4 mbsf to $3.8\;\mathrm{mM}$ at the SMTZ. Below the SMTZ, calciu m concentrations increase to $6.3\ \mathrm{mM}$ at 70 mbsf. The reversal in th e Ca profile below the SMTZ suggests enhanced silicate mineral/volcanic ash alteration in the zone of microbial methanogenesis, leading to a net addition of $\mathrm{Ca}$ to the pore water despite concurren t removal in authigenic carbonates. Likewise, strontium concentrations increase below the SMTZ to $130~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ $50\%$ higher than seawater value), boron concentrations increase to ${\sim}750~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ $79\%$ higher than seawater value), and potassium concentrations steadil y decrease, consistent with silicate and/or volcanic ash weathering i n the upper $100\mathrm{~m~}$ of Unit I. A second interval of enhanced silicat e mineral/volcanic ash diagenesis occurs between 520 and 630 mbs f in Unit II.  

Chloride concentrations are lower than average modern seawater value $^{\left(559\mathrm{~mM}\right)}$ in the upper portion of Unit I, increasin g from $549\;\mathrm{mM}$ at 1.4 mbsf $2\%$ lower than average seawater value) t o $559~\mathrm{mM}$ at 17 mbsf. Between 17 and 120 mbsf, Cl concentration s remain relatively constant at or near a seawater value. Chloride concentrations decrease from $550{-}534\;\mathrm{mM}$ across the Unit I/II boundary to $440{-}546\;\mathrm{mM}$ between 520 and 630 mbsf. Discrete anomalie s in the Cl profile at 520–630 mbsf are the result of methane hydrat e dissociation during core recovery, marking zones of elevated methane hydrate concentrations. However, background Cl concentrations are also lower at 520–630 mbsf.  

Between the seafloor and 144.3 mbsf, headspace methane concentrations range between 0.55 and 5172.48 ppmv. Deeper tha n 144.3 mbsf, methane concentrations decrease and remain betwee n 212.28 and 1802.82 ppmv, with an average of 1011.35 ppmv. Ethan e was detected in headspace samples deeper than 520.53 mbsf an d ranges between 0.25 and 1.92 ppmv. Methane-to-ethane ratios ar e consistently ${}_{>}500$ , indicating a dominantly microbial methan e source. Organic C values in Units I and II range from 0 to $1.2\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=0.39\,\mathrm{wt}\%$ ). Inorganic C and total nitrogen concentration s increase slightly with depth in both lithostratigraphic units an d range from 0.05 to $1.95~\mathrm{wt\%}$ (average $=1.1\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ ) and from 0.00 t o $0.09\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ (average $=0.05\ \mathrm{wt}\%$ ), respectively. $C/\Nu$ ratios range fro m 0.85 to 14.92.  

# Physical properties  

NGR, magnetic susceptibility, gamma ray attenuation (GRA ) bulk density, and $P$ -wave velocity were measured using the WholeRound Multisensor Logger (WRMSL) (Figure F9). Thermal conductivity was measured on WR core sections. Discrete $P$ -wave velocity, moisture and density (MAD), and undrained shear strengt h were measured on working-half sections. MAD porosity values decrease from $74\%$ near the seafloor to ${\sim}40\%$ at 85 mbsf. At 109–13 5 and 250–284 mbsf, porosity values are nearly constant at $41\%{-}45\%$ and $37\%{-}43\%$ , respectively. Between 520 and 635 mbsf, porosit y values show a slight increase with depth and range between $34\%$ and $48\%$ . $P$ -wave velocity values range from 1500 to $1600~\mathrm{m/s}$ between 0 and 10 mbsf, but the data are unreliable for the rest of th e borehole.  

Undrained shear strength values increase linearly from 0 t o ${\sim}180~\mathrm{kPa}$ with an average depth-dependent gradient of $2.5\ \mathrm{kPa/m}$ between 0 and 85 mbsf in Holes U1519D and U1519E. In Hol e U1519C, shear strength remains mostly constant with average values of ${\sim}62\,\mathrm{kPa}$ between 105 and 140 mbsf, $30{-}300\,\mathrm{kPa}$ between 25 0 and 290 mbsf, and $54{-}1104\ \mathrm{kPa}$ between 515 and 555 mbsf. NG R values range from ${\sim}0$ to 70 counts/s in Hole U1519C and are relatively uniform through the cored intervals, with an average of 4 0 counts/s. Magnetic susceptibility values are nearly constant between 0 and 150 mbsf and range from $10\times10^{-5}$ to $30\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ , except for a few ash layers where magnetic susceptibility values reac h as high as $300\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ . Between 250 and $283\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ , magnetic susceptibility values range from $15\times10^{-5}$ to $20\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ and increase t o $40\times10^{-5}$ to $50\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ at 283 mbsf, which corresponds to the lithostratigraphic Unit I/II boundary. Thermal conductivity values rang e from 0.8 to $1.6\:\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{{K})}}$ between the seafloor and 80 mbsf. Betwee n 109 and 135 mbsf, thermal conductivity values are uniform at ${\sim}1.3$ $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ . Deeper than 250 mbsf, thermal conductivity values increase to ${\sim}1.4\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ .  

# Downhole measurements  

Formation temperature measurements were taken with th e APCT-3 shoe with Cores 4H–8H, 9F, 11F, and 13F. The APCT- 3 measurements yield in situ temperature values from $6.44^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 3 1 mbsf to $7.91^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ at 86 mbsf and define a thermal gradient o f $24.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{km}$ . Using a mean thermal conductivity value of 1.3 1 $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ , the heat flow is estimated as ${\sim}33\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}}$ .  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

LWD data acquired during Expedition 372 in Hole U1519 A were correlated with core-based observations and physical properties measurements from Holes U1519C–U1519E and with seismi c reflection data across the site in the North Tuaheni Basin. LWD $P_{-}$ - wave velocity and density measurements (Pecher et al., 2018) wer e used to develop a synthetic seismic trace to correlate the LWD, core, and seismic data (Figure F9), which allowed us to assess the matc h between the seismic traces that would be predicted from the physical properties in the boreholes with seismic sections acquire d across Site U1519 prior to the expedition. Based on the new seismi c tie, the precise boundaries of the three major seismic units (define d by the Expedition 372 scientists) were revised and compared wit h LWD data and lithostratigraphic units from Expedition 375.  

The upper seismic unit is $281\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and comprises a horizontally layered basin-fill sequence, including at least two interprete d MTDs in the upper 141 mbsf and a thick underlying section of inferred highly reflective, presumably sandy sediments that were no t cored. Cores from recovered intervals in this seismic unit compris e mudstones with minor sand and volcanic ash and are dated $_{<0.54}$ Ma. Both observatory screens were deployed in silty mudstone intervals in this unit. The middle seismic unit is a seaward-dippin g $265\,\mathrm{~m~}$ thick slope sequence partially buried by the upper seismi c unit. This interval includes a mixture of layered sediments an d MTDs interpreted in the seismic data. Only the upper $_{3.5\,\textrm{m}}$ an d lower $27\;\mathrm{m}$ of this sequence were cored, and these intervals consis t of predominantly fine grained mudstone. The lower seismic unit is  a strongly reflective interval that dips landward, likely as a result o f uplift and tilting by thrust faulting. Cores recovered from this uni t to 635 mbsf consist of mudstone and MTDs containing coarser material, which have been dated at $0.54{-}1.73\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , younger than the expected Miocene/Pliocene age that was inferred prior to drilling.  

# Site U1520  

# Background and objectives  

The primary objective at Site U1520 was to sample the sedimentary sequence on the subducting Pacific plate to provide insight int o the lithologies and conditions expected deeper along the subduction interface and in the SSE source area. The site lies ${\sim}95~\mathrm{km}$ from shore and $16\,\mathrm{km}$ east of the deformation front in ${\sim}3520\;\mathrm{m}$ water depth (Figure F3; Table T1). Site U1520 was expected to encounter sediments and rocks of late Quaternary to Cretaceous ag e based on regional seismic stratigraphic interpretation of the Hikurangi Plateau and Hikurangi Trough stratigraphy (Figure F2 ) (Barnes et al., 2010; Davy et al., 2008). The upper ${\sim}610{-}640\,\mathrm{m}$ of th e section was expected to consist mainly of mud and sand turbidites, hemipelagic sediment, debris flow material, and minor ash of predominantly Pliocene–Quaternary age. The package from $\mathord{\sim}640$ t o $\mathord{\sim}840$ mbsf was expected to comprise Late Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Miocene sedimentary rocks of the Hikurangi Plateau cover sequence, including nannofossil chalk, mudstone, tephra, and sandstone,  with  possible  unconformities.  The  strongly  reflectiv e sequence deeper than 840 mbsf was interpreted to include basalts, volcaniclastic sediments, and breccia, with intervals of pelagic cher t and/or limestone (e.g., Davy et al., 2008).  

The coring objective at Site U1520 was to sample the entire sedimentary section on the Pacific plate, with a highest priority on recovering the materials deeper than ${\sim}600$ mbsf that represent th e protolith for material transported into the SSE source region. T o maximize the likelihood of successfully coring the deep portion o f the section, we drilled in casing to 642 mbsf in Hole U1520C an d undertook RCB coring below the casing to 1054.1 mbsf. Followin g coring in Hole U1520C, we conducted wireline logging in the ope n hole below the casing from 642 to 947 mbsf. We returned to Sit e U1520 later during the expedition to undertake APC/XCB coring i n Hole U1520D to sample the upper $642\,\mathrm{m}$ of the section.  

The scientific objectives at Site U1520 were to define the structures and deformation, physical properties, lithology and composition, and interstitial fluid geochemistry of the incoming material i n its “presubduction” state. Coring data will also be used for core-logseismic integration across the Hikurangi Trough. Priorities for postexpedition analysis include but are not limited to measurement o f the mechanical, elastic, frictional, and hydrological properties of th e incoming sediment and basement along with detailed compositional analyses.  

# Operations  

Transit to Site U1520  

We first occupied Site U1520 (proposed Site HSM-05A) whil e waiting for the Tangaroa to deliver replacement seals needed for th e observatory installation at Site U1518. We arrived at Site U1520 a t 0257 h (UTC $+\,12\,\mathrm{h}$ ) on 28 March 2018.  

# Hole U1520C  

First, we fabricated the base of the reentry cone, assembled th e hydraulic release tool (HRT) needed to deploy the reentry system, assembled a casing string consisting of 54 joints of $10\%$ inch casin g and a casing shoe, and secured the casing string in the moonpool a t $_{0130\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 29 March 2018. Next, we put together the drilling assembly needed to drill in the reentry system. The drilling assembly wa s composed of a $9\%$ inch drill bit, an underreamer with its arms set t o $14\%$ inches, and a mud motor to rotate the bit and underreamer i n isolation from the casing. The underreamer arms were tested, an d the drilling assembly was completed and landed inside the casing a t $0500~\mathrm{h}$ on 29 March. The drilling assembly and HRT were connected to the casing and mud skirt, the reentry cone was assemble d in the moonpool, and the reentry system was lowered to the seafloor. While the reentry system was being lowered to the seafloor, the Tangaroa arrived at $1615\,\mathrm{~h~}$ to deliver the replacement seal s needed for the CORK-II installation at Site U1518.  

The subsea camera was deployed to monitor the reentry con e and  base  while  drilling  it  into  the  seafloor.  Hole  U1520 C  

$38^{\circ}58.1532^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}7.9112^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 3522.1 mbsl) was spudded at $1940\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 29 March, and it took ${\sim}27\,\mathrm{h}$ for the bit to reach a total depth of 64 6 mbsf with the casing shoe at 642 mbsf. Once the drilling system wa s released from the reentry system, we recovered the subsea camer a and then the drill string at $1120~\mathrm{h}$ . With the reentry system completed, we departed for Site U1518 at $1310\,\mathrm{h}$ on 31 March to complete the observatory installation there.  

We returned to Site U1520 on 2 April following a $\mathord{\sim}10~\mathrm{h}$ deviation to the Gisborne Pilot Station for a personnel transfer an d reached Hole U1520C at $1848~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 April. We assembled an RC B coring assembly and reentered Hole U1520C at $0525~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 April. The next several hours were spent cleaning cuttings out of the inside of the $642~\mathrm{m}$ deep casing. RCB coring started at $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on  3 April. Cores 2R–44R penetrated from 646.0 to 1054.1 mbsf and recovered $235.81\mathrm{~m~}$ ( $58\%$ recovery). Nonmagnetic core barrels wer e used for all cores. Coring was terminated so that Hole U1520 C could be logged before the weather deteriorated.  

To prepare Hole U1520C for logging, we circulated the cutting s out of the hole with mud and recovered the RCB BHA. The subse a camera was deployed to check the reentry cone, which appeared t o have sediment inside, and the cone was flushed with seawater. Onc e the drill string was recovered, we made up a logging BHA and lowered it to the seafloor. Hole U1520C was reentered at $0250~\mathrm{h}$ on  9 April, and the drill pipe was set at 599 mbsf for logging, $42\;\mathrm{m}$ abov e the casing shoe. We deployed a modified triple combo tool strin g with the following tools from the bottom up: the Dipole Sonic Imager (DSI; sonic velocity), High-Resolution Laterolog Array (HRLA; resistivity), Hostile Environment Litho-Density Sonde (HLDS; caliper only, without the density source), and Enhanced Digital Telemetry Cartridge (EDTC; gamma ray and telemetry). We made tw o logging passes from 642 to 947 mbsf, where we encountered an obstruction $107~\mathrm{m}$ from the bottom of the hole. The tools were bac k on the rig floor at $1505~\mathrm{h}$ on 9 April, and the drill string was recovered at $0010\,\mathrm{h}$ on 10 April, ending operations in Hole U1520C. Th e next objective for the expedition was to install an observatory at Sit e U1519 and core at Site U1526.  

# Hole U1520D  

After a ${\sim}6\,\mathrm{h}$ transit from Site U1526, we arrived at the specifie d coordinates of Hole U1520D at $2305\,\mathrm{h}$ on 24 April 2018. Our objective for Hole U1520D was to core the uppermost sediment (shallower than 646 mbsf) that we drilled without coring in Hol e U1520C. After assembling an APC/XCB BHA, Hole U1520 D $38^{\circ}58.1475^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}7.8991^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 3520.3 mbsl) was spudded at $0850\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 25 April. Cores 1H–67X advanced from 0 to 642.3 mbsf and recovered $318.38\mathrm{~m~}$ $62\%$ recovery). In this interval, we drilled withou t coring from 189.3 to 220.0 mbsf and from 270.8 to 366.6 mbsf. Coring was suspended from $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 29 April until $1315\,\mathrm{h}$ on 30 April while we waited on weather. Nonmagnetic core barrels were use d with all APC cores. Formation temperature measurements wer e taken with the APCT-3 for Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, 13H, 16H, 19F, 23F, and 27F. The time spent at Site U1520 was 18.26 days.  

# Principal results  

# Lithostratigraphy  

Six lithostratigraphic units were defined at Site U1520 (Figur e F10). The sediments and sedimentary rocks range in age from Cretaceous to Holocene. Thin tephra layers are scattered throughou t most of the succession.  

Lithostratigraphic Unit I begins at the seafloor and extends t o 110.5 mbsf. This interval consists of greenish gray hemipelagic mu d punctuated by graded beds of dark gray silt and sand. We interpre t the coarser beds to be products of deposition by turbidity current s on the floor of the Hikurangi Trough.  

Unit II (110.5–222.0 mbsf) consists of hemipelagic mud with sil t interbeds. These turbidites are generally finer grained and thinne r than those recovered in Unit I. Based on interpretations of seismi c reflection data, Unit II is thought to represent the distal edges of th e Ruatoria debris avalanche. However, mesoscopic evidence is lackin g for the types of soft-sediment, gravity-driven deformation expecte d in a submarine slide or debris flow deposit (e.g., truncated and rotated laminae, irregular bedding dips, fragmentation of cohesiv e mud clasts, clasts-in-matrix fabrics, and flow banding).  

Unit III (222.0–509.82 mbsf) is similar to Unit I but withou t thick sand beds. The turbidites are characterized by graded beds o f fine sand to silt with planar- and cross-laminae. We interpret th e depositional environment to be in the Hikurangi Trough during  a period of time in which turbidity currents were less frequent, mor e dilute, and finer in grain size.  

Unit IV begins at 509.82 mbsf in Hole U1520D and extends t o 848.45 mbsf in Hole U1520C. Lithologies change markedly acros s the Unit III/IV boundary to a Miocene–Paleocene pelagic carbonate facies that includes light greenish gray marl, light brownish gra y calcareous mudstone, and pale brown chalk. Secondary lithologie s include matrix-supported gravity-flow deposits and volcanic tuff. The debris flow deposits display contorted to fragmented marl an d chalk, together with angular to subrounded clasts of volcaniclasti c sandstone and vesicular basalt.  

Unit V (848.45–1016.24 mbsf) is dominated by granule-size d volcaniclastic conglomerate. These Cretaceous deposits are characterized by subangular clasts of basalt that range in size from a fe w millimeters to $6\;\mathrm{{cm}}$ . The fabric ranges from clay matrix supporte d to clast supported, and the mechanisms of emplacement probabl y included grain and debris flow. Alteration of the basalt clasts t o palagonite and clay minerals is pervasive. Zeolites and calcite ar e common cements.  

Unit VI (1016.24–1045.75 mbsf) comprises a blend of roc k types whose stratigraphic organization and thicknesses are not resolvable. Much of the unit contains alternating volcaniclastic conglomerate and mudstone with a distinctive dark bluish gray t o greenish gray color. Additional lithologies include pyrite-rich siltstone,  organic-rich  black  mudstone,  white  limestone,  reddis h brown siltstone, and vesicular basalt with amygdules.  

# Biostratigraphy  

The sedimentary sequence and upper portion of the Hikurang i Plateau basement cored at Site U1520 represent a discontinuou s Holocene to late Cretaceous succession comprising several hiatusbounded packages. Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils indicate that Holes U1520D and U1520C recovered Holocene sediment $(<\!0.009\,\mathrm{Ma})$ from 0 to 5.93 mbsf, Pleistocene (0.009– $2.17\,\mathrm{Ma})$ from 15.40 to 537.21 mbsf, Pliocene from 543.45 to 577.3 5 mbsf, a Pliocene/Miocene boundary sequence from 598.06 t o 587.74 mbsf, Miocene from 635.65 to 746.89 mbsf, late Oligocen e from 756.62 to 766.20 mbsf, middle to early Eocene from 775.17 t o $825.53~\mathrm{mbsf}$ , and middle to early Paleocene from 827.04 to 848.0 1 mbsf.  

The underlying volcaniclastic sequence (849.96–1045.75 mbsf ) spanning lithostratigraphic Units V and VI is largely unfossiliferous, except for 950.22–953.45 and 1016.69–1017.82 mbsf, where Lat e Cretaceous foraminifers were recovered. Organic-rich sediment s from 1036.57 to 1037.21 mbsf also include poorly preserved radiolarian faunas and siliceous branching tube-like fossils of unknow n affinity. Minor reworking of planktonic foraminifers is eviden t throughout the cored sedimentary succession but is most notable a t ${\sim}512$ mbsf, where common, well-preserved middle to early Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene taxa are present in a Pleistocene fauna, an d at $\mathord{\sim}588$ mbsf, where late Miocene $(8.96{-}9.63\ \mathrm{Ma})$ ) taxa dominate  a Miocene/Pliocene boundary fauna.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations included NRM measurement o f archive-half sections prior to and following stepwise AF demagnetization to peak fields of 30 or $40~\mathrm{mT}$ In addition, 1–2 discrete samples per core were subjected to more detailed AF or thermal demagnetization. The data quality and processing strategy differe d somewhat for Holes U1520C and U1520D as a result of the differen t coring systems used, core disturbance, and recovery. With few exceptions, characteristic remanent magnetization directions calculated from data sets based on discrete samples were mostl y coherent. A magnetostratigraphy was produced with confidence fo r APC and RCB cores (375-U1520D-1H through 30H and Core 375- U1520C-2R through Section 23R-6A) and tentatively for XCB core s (375-U1520D-31X through 66X). The volcaniclastic deposits o f Units V and VI all yield steep negative inclinations, suggesting tha t the  entire  unit  may  have  been  remagnetized.  The  Brunhes/Matuyama Chron boundary was identified at 413 mbsf, whic h is roughly consistent with biostratigraphic ages. Additional polarit y horizons will be identified postexpedition.  

# Structural geology  

The rocks encountered at Site U1520 are generally undeformed . Bedding dips gently $(<\!30^{\circ})$ over the entire depth of the hole, with th e exception of folded strata in debris flow deposits. The RAB imag e log shows some intervals of steeper dips that are not recognized i n the cores. Discrete small displacement deformation features wer e observed throughout Hole U1520C (646–1036 mbsf) but are largel y absent shallower than 596.4 mbsf in Hole U1520D (Figure F11).  

Distinct structural domains are mostly correlated with lithostratigraphic units. Domain 1 $0{-}596.4~\mathrm{mbsf})$ is defined by subhorizontal to gently dipping beds with no discrete deformatio n features. Deeper than 596.4 mbsf, faults (normal when sense of sli p was determined) and dissolution features are present throughou t Domain 2 (596.4–848.45 mbsf), which consists of calcareous clayrich sediments (Figure F11). Veins are more common in the volcaniclastic units that comprise Domain 3 (848.45–1016.24). Finally, Domain 4 (1016.24–1045.75) near the bottom of the hole coincide s with lithostratigraphic Unit VI, where deformation is dominated b y minor faults.  

# Geochemistry  

A total of 89 WR samples were collected and squeezed for shipboard and shore-based pore water chemical analyses. Despite th e high bulk density and cemented nature of the sediments recovere d in Hole U1520C, pore water was recovered in all three lithostratigraphic units. The geochemical profiles at Site U1520 are comple x and likely reflect the combined effects of organic matter diagenesis, non-steady-state sedimentation, volcanic ash/silicate mineral diagenesis, carbonate mineral diagenesis, solute diffusion, and potential  lateral  fluid  flow  in  the  volcaniclastic  sediments  o f lithostratigraphic Unit V.  

Contemporary carbonate mineral recrystallization is manifeste d by elevated dissolved Sr concentrations in Unit IV shallower tha n  

769 mbsf. Deeper than 769 mbsf, Sr concentrations decrease monotonically to near constant values in Unit V. The decrease in Sr concentrations  at  the  base  of  Unit  IV  suggests  that  carbonat e recrystallization is minor and that present-day carbonate diagenesi s is restricted to the top of Unit IV. Sulfate concentrations increas e linearly through the lower part of Unit IV and remain elevated an d nearly constant in Unit V. A similar pattern occurs in the $\operatorname{Sr}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}$ profiles. Maintaining this gradient likely requires lateral flow of  a sulfate-enriched fluid in the volcaniclastic sediments, in a manne r similar to off-axis hydrothermal flow systems in igneous ocea n crust (i.e., Baker et al., 1989; Fisher and Wheat, 2010; Solomon an d Kastner, 2012; Vannucchi et al., 2013).  

Chloride concentrations increase linearly to a peak at 51.3 mbs f (Figure F11), decrease to 142 mbsf, and remain relatively constan t to the base of Unit III. Collectively, these profiles suggest a zone o f localized volcanic ash alteration/silicate mineral diagenesis and th e precipitation of hydrous aluminosilicate minerals. Below this zone, in the lower portion of Unit IV and in Unit V, Cl concentrations ar e depleted relative to seawater and marked by several excursions t o lower values over only $10\;\mathrm{m}$ to a few tens of meters, which may reflect local addition of freshened water.  

A total of 93 samples from Hole U1520C and 108 samples fro m Hole U1520D were taken for carbonate analyses. In lithostratigraphic Units I–III, calcium carbonate $\tt(C a C O_{3})$ varies from 2.06 t o $18.4\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . In lithostratigraphic Units IV–VI, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ varies from 0.3 5 to $96.9~\mathrm{wt\%}$ , reflecting variations in lithology. The $C a C O_{3}$ profil e mimics the total C and inorganic C profiles, with similar trends i n all lithostratigraphic units. In the deepest part of Unit IV, $C a C O_{3}$ values range from $90.0\;\mathrm{wt\%}$ at 799.0 mbsf to $91.4~\mathrm{wt\%}$ at $844~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . This high carbonate abundance reflects the presence of pelagic carbonate. In Unit V, peaks in $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ content generally reflect localized calcite cement. Organic C values are generally low $(<\!1.19\,\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ throughout the section.  

# Physical properties  

Porosity values decrease with depth from $72\%$ at the seafloor t o $28\%{-}38\%$ at ${\sim}800$ mbsf, with some lower values of ${\sim}40\%$ betwee n 40 and 106 mbsf that correspond to sand layers. Deeper than 80 0 mbsf, porosity increases to $56\%$ . Deeper than 855 mbsf, porosit y generally decreases with depth but with substantial scatter to th e bottom of the hole. The scatter is associated with varying degrees o f cementation (Figure F11).  

$P$ -wave velocities range from 1450 to $1800\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ between the seafloor and ${\sim}90\,\mathrm{mbsf.}$ Between 90 and 420 mbsf, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity measurement was mostly unsuccessful due to gaps between cores an d liners and expansion cracks. Between 420 and ${\sim}845$ mbsf, velocitie s generally increase with depth, ranging from 1500 to $2700\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , wit h little scatter. Deeper than 845 mbsf in volcaniclastic Units V and VI, $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity exhibits significant scatter, ranging from 1800 t o ${\sim}5000\ \mathrm{m/s}$ . Undrained shear strength increases with depth from $_{0-}$ $10\,\mathrm{kPa}$ at the seafloor to $100{-}150\,\mathrm{kPa}$ at 150 mbsf and remains constant to $400~\mathrm{mbsf},$ followed by a rapid increase with depth to ${\sim}600$ kPa at 500 mbsf.  

NGR values range from ${\sim}0$ to 75 counts/s. Mean values are between 30 and 50 counts/s in all units, except lithostratigraphic Uni t IV where the mean NGR value is $\mathord{\sim}20$ counts/s. Magnetic susceptibility values are nearly constant with depth in lithostratigraphi c Units I–III and range from $20\times10^{-5}$ to $40\times10^{-5}$ SI. In lithostratigraphic Unit IV, magnetic susceptibility values increase with dept h from $10\,\times\,10^{-5}$ at ${\sim}510$ mbsf to $100\times10^{-5}$ at $\mathord{\sim}700$ mbsf and the n decrease to ${\sim}4\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ at 800–849 mbsf. At the top of lithostratigraphic Unit $\mathrm{V}$ at $\mathord{\sim}849$ mbsf, magnetic susceptibility values shif t rapidly to ${\sim}100\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ and then gradually increase with depth t o $300\,\times\,10^{-5}$ SI at ${\sim}900$ mbsf, followed by a gradual decrease wit h depth to $10\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ at ${\sim}1020$ mbsf. At 1045 mbsf, magnetic susceptibility values rapidly increase to ${\sim}300\times10^{-5}\;\mathrm{SI}$ .  

Thermal conductivity values increase with depth from 1. 0 $\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m\cdotK})$ at the seafloor to $1.3\ \mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}.\mathrm{K})$ at $\mathord{\sim}20$ mbsf and remai n nearly constant to $\mathord{\sim}550$ mbsf. Some higher thermal conductivit y values of $1.6{-}1.9\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}{\cdot}\mathrm{K})$ occur between 23 and 87 mbsf and correspond to sand layers. Measurements were not made between 55 0 and 646 mbsf because the sediments were too indurated for a needle probe and too fragile and disturbed by coring for the half-spac e probe. Thermal conductivity values increase from ${\sim}1.2\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m{\cdot}K})$ a t 648 mbsf to $1.8~\mathrm{W/(m\cdotK)}$ at 700 mbsf and then remain relativel y constant to ${\sim}850$ mbsf. Deeper than $850\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ thermal conductivit y is nearly constant, with an average value of $1.2\;\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\mathrm{{\cdotK}})$ .  

# Downhole measurements  

Five APCT-3 equilibrium temperature measurements wer e combined with thermal conductivity measurements and yielded  a heat flow of $44\,\mathrm{\mW/m^{2}}$ and a temperature gradient of $38^{\circ}C/\mathrm{km}$ This heat flow value is consistent with heat flow measurement s made using a $3.5\;\mathrm{m}$ thermal probe during R/V Roger Revelle Cruis e RR1508 in the same location (Harris et al., 2016).  

Hole U1520C was logged using a modified triple combo that included borehole diameter from a mechanical caliper (HLDS), gamma ray (EDTC-B), resistivity (HRLA), and DSI. The nuclea r source was not mounted on the HLDS. Although some difference s exist, wireline logs are generally consistent with LWD data collecte d during Expedition 372 (Figure F10) (Pecher et al., 2018). The calipe r shows that the hole ranges in size from 8 inches (likely due to collapse or swelling of clays) to 17 inches. The hole is irregular wit h many washouts below $780~\mathrm{mbsf}$ . In the uncased portion of Hol e U1520C, gamma ray varies between $\mathord{\sim}20$ and $80\,\mathrm{gAPI}$ , $P$ -wave velocity varies between ${\sim}1.6$ and $2.9\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , and resistivity is relatively constant at ${\sim}2\,\Omega\mathrm{m}$ , with the exception of strong peaks between 870 an d 890 mbsf. In general, gamma ray and $P_{\|}$ -wave velocity are inversel y correlated between 640 and 848 mbsf and positively correlated below 848 mbsf.  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

The $P$ -wave velocity data from LWD and wireline logging wer e integrated to develop a velocity model to 944 mbsf. Because densit y data were not recorded during Expedition 375 wireline logging, th e density data from LWD were merged with whole-round track an d discrete sample data to construct a density model. A synthetic seismic reflection trace was developed to tie the LWD, core, and seismi c data (Figure F11). Considering the new seismic tie from this analysis, the precise boundaries of the nine seismic units defined by th e Expedition 372 scientists were revised, and we compared thes e units with LWD data from Expedition 372, wireline data, and lithostratigraphic units from Expedition 375.  

Seismic Unit 1 is $106~\mathrm{m}$ thick and comprises moderate- to lowamplitude, laterally continuous reflections. Cores show the sequence to comprise mud, silt and fine-grained sandy turbidites, an d hemipelagic sediments of Late Pleistocene to Holocene age. Seismi c Unit 2 is $119\;\mathrm{m}$ thick and is characterized by moderate- to low-amplitude, semicontinuous and chaotic reflections and has been interpreted from seismic and LWD data to represent the Ruatori a avalanche MTD. In Hole U1520D, cores were only recovered fro m the upper $80\,\mathrm{m}$ of the unit, and the base of the unit was not sampled.  

The lithofacies is composed mostly of thin-bedded horizontal silt y turbidites with occasional mud intraclasts and erosional bases. Th e sequence appears largely undisturbed. Seismic Units 3–5 consist o f variable amplitude, laterally continuous reflections that can b e traced widely along and across the Hikurangi Trough. Coring reveals that these units are composed of normally graded silty turbidites with thick volcanic ash layers near the top of the unit. Microfossil ages indicate that these are early to late Pleistocene i n age.  

Seismic Units 6–8 have a more irregular geometry than th e overlying units and have moderate- to low-amplitude reflections, which are locally offset by small normal faults. The disrupted natur e of the reflections in seismic Unit 6 could be interpreted to be one o r more debris flows originating from the flanks of Tūranganui Knoll. Coring reveals that these units are composed of marl and calcareou s mudstone with tuff and thin MTDs overlying chalk. Biostratigraph y indicates that these units are early Paleocene to early–middle Pleistocene in age. Seismic Unit 9 consists of high-amplitude reflection s that are semicontinuous to discontinuous and corresponds to lithostratigraphic Units V and VI, which are composed predominantly o f mixed, variably cemented volcaniclastic lithologies and thin intervals of calcareous and black mudstone. The seismic units exhibit a n overall progradational geometry toward the west, building outwar d into the basin away from the flank of Tūranganui Knoll. Microfossil ages indicate that seismic Unit 9 is late Early Cretaceous to Lat e Cretaceous in age.  

# Site U1526  

# Background and objectives  

The primary drilling objective at Site U1526 was to sample th e thin sediment cover $\left(\sim\!30\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ and ${\sim}100{-}150\;\mathrm{m}$ of underlying volcaniclastics or basement on the western flank of Tūranganui Knol l Seamount in $2908\mathrm{~m~}$ water depth (Figures F2, F3; Table T1). Th e scientific aim of coring was to characterize the seamount’s composition, physical properties, extent of alteration and hydration, an d structure and hydrogeology prior to transport into the SSE sourc e region. Seismic imaging shows that subducted seamounts presen t in the source region of shallow SSEs along the drilling transect (Bel l et al., 2010) are possible barriers to SSE propagation (Wallace et al., 2016; Figure F1) and that they may potentially be related to the location of historical tsunami earthquakes (Bell et al., 2014). Prioritie s for postexpedition core analysis include but are not limited to measurement of the mechanical, elastic, frictional, and hydrologica l properties of the incoming sediment and basement along with detailed analyses of composition and alteration.  

# Operations  

Transit to Site U1526  

The vessel arrived at Site U1526 (proposed Site HSM-08A) a t $1700\,\mathrm{h}$ $\mathrm{UTC}+12)$ ) on 22 April 2018.  

# Hole U1526A  

An RCB BHA was assembled, and the drill string was lowered t o the seafloor. Hole U1526A $(39^{\circ}1.3203^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}14.7594^{\prime}\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{:}}$ ; 2890. 1 mbsl) was spudded at $0150~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 April 2018. Cores 1R–14R advanced from 0 to 83.6 mbsf and recovered $29.26\mathrm{~m~}$ $35\%$ recovery). Nonmagnetic core barrels were used for all RCB cores. At the completion of coring, the drill bit was partially raised from the seafloor, and the ship returned to nearby Site U1520.  

Hole U1526B  

On 2 May 2018, we returned to Site U1526 following an $^{8\,\mathrm{h}}$ transit from Site U1520 in dynamic positioning mode. The ship was offset $^{20\mathrm{~m~}}$ west-northwest from Hole U1526A, and Hole U1526 B $39^{\circ}1.3146^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $179^{\circ}14.7481^{\prime}\mathrm{E}$ ; 2888.4 mbsl) was spudded at $2015\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 2 May. APC Cores 1H–4H and XCB Core 5X advanced from 0 t o 33.5 mbsf and recovered $31.56\;\mathrm{m}$ ( $94\%$ recovery). Nonmagnetic cor e barrels were used for all APC cores. The time spent at Site U152 6 was 2.88 days.  

The JOIDES Resolution started the transit to Auckland (Ne w Zealand) at $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on 3 May. Expedition 375 ended with the firs t line ashore at the Freyberg Wharf in Auckland at $0652\,\mathrm{h}$ on 5 Ma y 2018.  

# Principal results  

Lithostratigraphy  

We identified two lithostratigraphic units at Site U1526 (Figur e F12). Unit I is characterized by fine-grained mixed sediment (i.e., siliciclastic–calcareous) to biocalcareous sediment. Unit II comprises volcaniclastics. Unit I extends from 0 to 30.23 mbsf and i s composed of mud, calcareous mud, and nannofossil-rich ooze. Th e upper greenish gray mud contains foraminifer-rich silt and ash layers. Between 26.91 and 30.23 mbsf, the lithology changes fro m greenish gray mud to light green calcareous mud with nannofossil s and then to whitish brown nannofossil ooze. Unit I ranges in ag e from Holocene to Late Cretaceous.  

The Unit I/II boundary at 30.23 mbsf is characterized by a $20\,\mathrm{cm}$ interval rich in manganese concretions. Unit II is Cretaceous in age. Below the manganese-rich layer, we observed a volcaniclastic sandstone to conglomerate with variably altered basalt clasts in a sandsized matrix composed of shell and basalt fragments (Figure F12) . The top of the volcaniclastic conglomerate is characterized b y abundant intact shells. Because of the sharp contact between th e dramatically different lithofacies of Units I and II, the presence o f the manganese crust at the top of Unit II, and the Cretaceou s macrofossils found in the volcaniclastic conglomerate, we interpre t this boundary to be an unconformity. Below the shell-rich layer, basalt clasts generally range from centimeter to decimeter scale, wit h some basalt intervals extending for $1\mathrm{-}2\,\mathrm{m}$ .  

# Biostratigraphy  

The sedimentary succession cored at Site U1526 ranges in ag e from Holocene to Late Cretaceous (Figure F12). High foraminiferal abundances and good preservation were observed throughout th e upper sedimentary cover (lithostratigraphic Unit I). Below this interval, in lithostratigraphic Unit II, volcaniclastic coarse sandstone s and conglomerates are barren of microfossils, although macroinvertebrate remains provide broad biostratigraphic and paleowate r depth constraints.  

Planktonic foraminifers and calcareous nannofossils indicat e that Holes U1526A and U1526B recovered a succession of Holocen e $(<\!0.009\,\mathrm{Ma})$ and Pleistocene $(0.44{-}2.17\,\mathrm{Ma})$ sediments from 0.07 t o 19.95 mbsf, overlying late Miocene (5.33–5.44 Ma) sediments fro m 20.47 to 21.07 mbsf and Late Cretaceous $({\sim}66{-}74\,\mathrm{Ma})$ ) sediments a t 30.20 mbsf. Planktonic foraminifer abundances and benthic foraminifer assemblages throughout Unit I are indicative of open oceanic settings and mid- to lower bathyal water depths $\left(>\!600\,\textrm{m}\right)$ , respectively. Macroinvertebrate remains in Unit II are consisten t with Late Cretaceous shallow-water bioclastic material transporte d downslope.  

The  underlying  volcaniclastic  section  recovered  in  Hol e U1526A (29.1–81.39 mbsf) was generally barren of microfossil remains; however, a coarse sand–sized volcaniclastic sandstone t o conglomerate in the upper portion (29.1–38.8 mbsf) of Unit II contains abundant bivalve shells. Below this interval, large subrounde d to subangular pebbles and boulders of variably altered to fresh basalt are embedded in a coarse volcaniclastic sand matrix that contains remobilized shell material, echinoid spines, and corallin e algae.  

# Paleomagnetism  

Paleomagnetic investigations at Site U1526 focused on (1) producing a preliminary magnetostratigraphy for the sedimentar y cover sequence sampled in Hole U1526B, (2) resolving remanenc e intensity and demagnetization behavior of volcaniclastic materia l recovered deeper than 24 mbsf, (3) providing constraints on th e emplacement temperatures of the volcaniclastic material, and (4 ) exploring the possibility that in situ lava flows are present. Analyse s included the continuous NRM measurement of archive-half sections prior to and following AF demagnetization. An additional 1 4 discrete samples from individual basaltic clasts were subjected t o thermal demagnetization experiments.  

The pelagic sediments from Hole U1526B yield NRMs in th e range of ${\sim}0.005$ to $0.5\;\mathrm{A/m}$ that decay rapidly during the removal o f a steep drilling overprint. Following AF treatment to 10 or $20~\mathrm{mT_{i}}$ inclination records display a well-defined pattern with multipl e switches from negative (normal polarity) to positive (reversed polarity) inclinations with sharp transitions.  

The NRM of the volcaniclastic materials in lithostratigraphi c Unit II ranges from ${\sim}0.2$ to $13.0\,\mathrm{A/m}$ . The NRM directions have inclinations that usually differ among mafic clasts, suggesting that th e clastic material was emplaced at ambient (“cold”) temperatures. Remanent magnetization directions from discrete samples are coherent with the directions measured on the archive-half sections. Samples generally yield high-quality demagnetization behavior an d primarily demagnetize in the blocking temperature range of $250^{\circ}-$ $350^{\circ}\mathrm{C}_{:}$ , suggesting that titanomagnetite or titanomaghemite is th e main remanence carrier.  

Basalts recovered between 57.2 and $64.8~\mathrm{mbsf}$ yield consisten t steep and negative NRM inclinations similar to the inclination of  a ${\sim}1.5\,\mathrm{~m~}$ long and mostly intact piece of basalt recovered betwee n 24.6 and 26.03 mbsf, which raises the possibility that in situ lav a flows may be present, although heavily fractured, in the sequence.  

# Structural geology  

Bedding planes are difficult to resolve throughout the cored interval at Site U1526, although local distinctive sedimentary structures  are  noted.  Brecciated  clasts  are  scattered  throughout, exhibiting possible shear fabrics. Fractures and veins are the mos t common structural features (Figure F13) and can be observed i n both clasts and matrix. Both fracture-filled and diffuse veins ar e present in the volcaniclastic deposits. We defined two distinc t structural domains at this site. Domain 1 contains fine-grained sediments with no veins. Domain 2 contains volcaniclastic sediment s and basalt and is distinguished by varying degrees of cementatio n and veining.  

# Geochemistry  

The main objective of the inorganic geochemistry program a t Site U1526 was to identify diagenetic reactions and to evaluate th e possibility of vertical recharge of seawater through the Tūranganu i  

Knoll Seamount. A total of 11 routine pore water WR samples wer e collected from APC cores in Hole U1526B and squeezed for shipboard and shore-based pore water chemical analyses. The geochemical profiles at Site U1526 reflect the combined effects of earl y organic matter diagenesis and carbonate/silicate mineral diagenesis. There is a sharp gradient in the profiles of many solutes (Figur e F13) approaching the volcaniclastic sediments of Unit II to a modified fluid composition similar to that of the volcaniclastic unit (Uni t V) at Site U1520.  

Hydrocarbon gases were not detected at Site U1526. In lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0{-}30.23~\mathrm{mbsf})$ , which consists of fine-graine d mixed to biocalcareous sediment, $C a C O_{3}$ exhibits a large degree o f scatter (ranging from 1.26 to $69.99~\mathrm{wt\%}$ ). Calcium carbonate content increases with depth and reaches the highest value $(69.99\,\mathrm{wt}\%)$ in Unit I at 21 mbsf, which corresponds to nannofossil-rich ooze. I n lithostratigraphic Unit II (30.23–81.39 mbsf), which is composed o f coarse volcaniclastic sandstone and volcaniclastic conglomerate, $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ concentrations also exhibit a large degree of scatter, rangin g between 0.25 and $68.30\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ . The highest value $(68.30\;\mathrm{wt\%})$ in Uni t II is indicative of bivalve shell and calcite cement incorporation i n the shell-rich bed at the top of the volcaniclastic sequence. Organi c carbon values are low in Units I and II (ranging from 0.00 to 0.6 1 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ ); the highest values are shallower than 21 mbsf and correspon d to calcareous mud. Carbon/nitrogen ratios range from 20.89 (possibly due to a terrestrial influence of organic matter) to 190.91.  

# Physical properties  

Porosity values are $62\%{-}68\%$ between the seafloor and 21 mbs f in lithostratigraphic Unit I (Figure F13). Porosity decreases abruptl y to $18\%$ at $\mathord{\sim}30$ mbsf at the top of Unit II. From 39 mbsf to the botto m of Hole U1526A in lithostratigraphic Unit II, porosity values exhibi t large scatter $(2\%{-}44\%)$ and average $20\%$ with no significant downhole trend. In lithostratigraphic Unit I $(0{-}30\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ), $P$ -wave velocit y ranges from 1450 to $1570\ \mathrm{m/s}$ . Deeper than 30 mbsf in Unit II, $P_{-}$ - wave velocity ranges from 1700 to ${\sim}6000\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ , with significant scatter arising from the heterogeneous nature of the conglomerates an d basalt, due in part to variable degrees of cementation. Thermal conductivity values range between 1.2 and $1.6~\mathrm{W}/(\mathrm{m}\cdot\mathrm{K})$ and have  a mean value of 1.5 W/(m·K). Undrained shear strength increase s with depth, ranging from 0 to ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{kPa}$ between 0 and 30 mbsf. NGR values in lithostratigraphic Unit I mostly range between 2 0 and 40 counts/s, except for lower values of 2–8 counts/s between 2 7 and 30 mbsf, where nannofossil-rich ooze is present. NGR values i n lithostratigraphic Unit II increase from $\mathrm{\sim}29$ counts/s at the top o f the unit to ${\sim}36$ counts/s at ${\sim}50$ mbsf and then decrease gradually t o 27 counts/s at the bottom of the cored interval. Magnetic susceptibility values mostly range from $10\times10^{-5}$ to $200\times10^{-5}\ \mathrm{SI}$ in lithostratigraphic Unit I, shallower than $\mathord{\sim}30$ mbsf. Deeper than ${\sim}30$ mbsf, magnetic susceptibility values range from $\sim\!100\times10^{-5}$ to 300 0 $\times\,10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ with an average value of ${\sim}1400\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{SI}$ .  

# Core-log-seismic integration  

Core-based  observations  and  measurements  from  Hole s U1526A and U1526B were integrated with seismic reflection dat a from Tūranganui Knoll. In the absence of logging data, we used $P_{-}$ - wave velocity and density data from cores to construct a lithologi c model and produce a seismic-well tie (Figure F13). $P$ -wave velocit y data from the Hole U1526B pelagic sediments indicate that velocit y values in this interval are low, typically ranging from $\mathord{\sim}1500$ to 153 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ , which is consistent with a strong reflection at the base of lithostratigraphic Unit I that separates the pelagic sediments from cemented volcaniclastic sandstones below. To depth convert th e seismic data below Unit I, we used a mean $P$ -wave velocity value o f $3805\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ from core data.  

Two seismic units were identified at Site U1526. Seismic Unit  1 corresponds to lithostratigraphic Unit I and is represented by  a weakly reflective interval that is $30.2\;\mathrm{m}$ thick in Hole U1526B. However, the thickness varies significantly away from the site, reachin g more than $140~\mathrm{m}$ elsewhere on Tūranganui Knoll. Cores show tha t seismic Unit 1 $(0{-}30.2\;\mathrm{mbsf})$ comprises predominantly light greenish gray calcareous mudstone over brownish white nannofossil-ric h ooze with thin layers of volcanic ash and represents a highly condensed section that spans from the Holocene to Cretaceous. Seismic Unit 2 corresponds to lithostratigraphic Unit II and represent s the lower $44~\mathrm{m}$ drilled in Hole U1526A, but it extends below th e depth of drilling. The upper part of the unit is strongly reflective, comprising planar to irregular, discontinuous high-amplitude reflections. Cores show that seismic Unit 2 comprises large, subrounded to subangular pebbles and boulders of variably altered t o fresh basalt embedded in a heavily cemented coarse-grained volcaniclastic matrix.  

# Observatory installations  

Borehole observatories were installed at Sites U1518 and U1519. The observatory at Site U1518 (penetrating an active thrust fault ) includes three levels of pore pressure monitoring, distributed temperature monitoring, a geochemical fluid flowmeter, and time-series fluid sampling for geochemical analyses (Figure F4). Th e observatory at Site U1519 is similar in overall design (as describe d below) but includes only two pore pressure monitoring interval s and distributed temperature monitoring, with no fluid samplin g (Figure F4). Pore pressure monitoring is conducted via hydrauli c tubing that terminates in screens outside of casing, except in th e fault zone interval at Site U1518, where the casing is perforated fo r geochemical sampling. The fluid sampling is conducted using sampling coils driven by osmotic pumps (Jannasch et al., 2004). Distributed  temperature  monitoring  is  conducted  using  distribute d autonomous temperature sensing data loggers suspended in the interior of the casing.  

Both observatories consist of an outer $10\%$ inch casing strin g with an ACORK head and a $4\%$ inch inner casing string with  a CORK-II head emplaced inside the ACORK (Figure F4). For th e fault site, Hole U1518G was predrilled to 433 mbsf, and the intention was to lower $10\%$ inch casing into the hole escorted by a n underreamer and mud motor, with the ACORK head attached t o the top of the casing. During reentry, however, unanticipated heav e caused the bit to knock the reentry funnel away from Hole U1518G, requiring us to drill in the ACORK and casing at the new location o f the funnel and mud skirt (Hole U1518H; drilled to $426~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ). Fo r the Site U1519 observatory, Hole U1519B was predrilled to 28 3 mbsf, and the $10\%$ inch casing was lowered behind an underreame r and mud motor, with the ACORK head attached to the top of th e casing. At both sites, an HRT was used to release the ACORK assembly after it was drilled in.  

A flatpack umbilical containing three hydraulic lines ( $^{1\!}/\!\!_{4}$ inch diameter) was strapped to the outside of the $10\%$ inch casing as it wa s assembled and run through the moonpool. These lines terminate i n casing screens in the target monitoring intervals at depth (at th e base of the screens) and are connected to valves and the pressur e sensing unit at the ACORK head. Pressure monitoring at Site U151 8 takes place in the hanging wall (217.7 mbsf), fault zone (332. 1 mbsf), and footwall (393.2 mbsf) of the thrust fault. Pressure monitoring takes place in two intervals at Site U1519 (at 124 and 26 4 mbsf). After the ACORK was seated, the CORK-II was lowered int o the inner bore of the $10\%$ inch ACORK casing and latched into th e ACORK head after lowering and landing the temperature and geochemical sampling instrument string into the CORK-II. A titaniu m landing seat for the OsmoSampler and OsmoFlowmeter is locate d inside the CORK-II at Site U1518.  

To undertake temperature monitoring at Sites U1518 an d U1519, temperature sensing data loggers were attached to a rop e (7⁄16 inch Spectra line) with sinker bars at various depths to hold th e rope taut (Figure F4). A total of 30 temperature sensing data logger s were installed at Site U1518, with dense spacing spanning the faul t zone and coarser spacing in the hanging wall and footwall. The instrument string at Site U1519 consists of 15 temperature sensin g data loggers. Both instrument strings were lowered through the drill pipe into the inner bore of the $4\%$ inch casing and seated with  a landing plug at the CORK-II head. The OsmoSamplers and OsmoFlowmeter were lowered as part of the temperature string at Sit e U1518 (Figure F4) and were landed on the titanium seat inside th e CORK-II casing that was positioned in the fault zone interval. Screened, perforated casing $(7\;\mathrm{m}\;\mathrm{high})$ at the fault zone monitorin g interval allows flow of formation fluids into the OsmoSamplers an d OsmoFlowmeter.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

All of the primary objectives described above were successfull y achieved during Expedition 375:  

• Installing two subseafloor observatories to monitor deformation and characterize changes in thermal, hydrological, and chemical state during multiple SSE cycles; and • Coring at four sites to characterize the physical conditions and rock properties that underlie SSE occurrence.  

Because of excellent weather and smooth operations, we wer e able to complete an ambitious slate of planned drilling activities, including wireline logging the lower portion of Site U1520. Together, Expeditions 372 and 375 implemented a complex, linked data sharing and sampling plan that spanned two expeditions, several shorebased investigators, and a high volume of sample requests for mission-critical postexpedition studies of rock properties, composition, structures, and deformation. This plan was largely successful owin g to the careful coordination of sample requests and sampling strategies during the several months prior to the two expeditions.  

# Observatory installations  

Both of the complex, nested observatory installations were completed successfully. Each of the installations required a carefully coordinated sequence of  operations,  including several  reentries, running and releasing multiple nested casing strings in deep water, and rigging large instrument strings, lengthy rope, and several hundred meters of hydraulic umbilical (see Operations in Site U151 8 and Operations in Site U1519). At Site U1518, the observatory included monitoring of fluid pressure at three separate intervals an d fluid sampling in the interior of the casing via a complex hole completion design (Figure F4). At Site U1519, the observatory desig n was somewhat simpler but also included multiple nested casin g strings and installation of a $270~\mathrm{m}$ instrument string. We attribut e the overall success of both observatory installations to a combination of extensive pre-expedition preparation and to a carefull y planned operations strategy for casing installation and instrumen t handling at the rig floor and moonpool. The design phase of the observatories began in collaboration with Texas A&M Universit y (USA) engineering staff in April 2015 ( ${\sim}35$ months in advance o f Expedition 375). This preparation time was enabled by funding o f the observatory development well in advance of the expedition an d was essential to design and fabricate the observatory systems and t o develop the implementation strategy.  

Observatory operations generally went smoothly and, in som e cases, more quickly than anticipated (e.g., running casing whil e strapping umbilical took less time than allotted in initial time estimates). However, a few minor problems were encountered durin g deployment that may compromise the observatory integrity at eac h site. At Site U1518, unexpected heave during reentry in the predrilled hole (U1518G) caused the drill pipe to bump and displac e the reentry cone. As a result, we had no viable option other than t o drill in the ACORK system to its total depth of 423 mbsf at a ne w location (Hole U1518H) a few meters away from the previousl y drilled hole. Although it was fortunate that we were prepared t o drill with a mud motor and underreamer, the proximity of a larg e open hole very near to the observatory installation raises the possibility of fluid sample contamination and compromised hydrauli c isolation from the seafloor. Because the casing string was drilled i n rather than lowered into a predrilled hole, it is also possible that th e umbilical was damaged during installation and/or that the casin g screens were fouled by circulation of a large volume of cutting s during drilling of the large diameter hole. An additional potentia l issue at Site U1518 arose because the ROV platform (deployed b y free-fall) hung up on the top of the ACORK wellhead. For this reason, we elected not to install an ROV platform at Site U1519.  

At Site U1519, postinstallation inspection of the ACORK an d CORK-II wellheads by the subsea camera revealed that the reentr y funnel had filled with cuttings that partly bury the ACORK bays an d the lower portion of the pressure sensor package. Potential futur e replacement of the sensor package, which is designed to be modular, may therefore require remediation or could prove impossible i f the cuttings cannot be cleared. The inspection also revealed tha t one of the support fins on the CORK-II wellhead was slightly damaged, likely during release using the J-tool. In general, these issue s were unavoidable. However, based on these experiences, modification of installation operations may warrant consideration, for example, (1) to minimize the risk of large cuttings loads filling th e ACORK reentry funnel, (2) to more reliably release wellheads without requiring drill string rotation (e.g., by using a hydraulic releas e as was used for the ACORK), and (3) to redesign the ACORK wellhead profile to minimize risk of ROV platform or other free-fal l components becoming misaligned.  

# Coring and sampling  

At all of our coring sites (U1518–U1520 and U1526), the primary drilling and sampling objectives were met. At Site U1518, th e formation was highly overconsolidated at the seafloor, and as a result we were unable to drill with the APC/XCB systems as deeply a s planned and switched to RCB coring at a relatively shallow dept h $(<\!200\,\mathrm{\mbsf})$ to drill across the thrust fault. At Site U1520 (Hol e U1520C), we used a drill-in reentry system to case the upper portion of the sediment section; this system worked as planned and allowed us to reach our depth target in the volcaniclastic sequence. The original planned depth of the hole was 1200 mbsf, but the tota l depth was shallower because we had reached our main scientific objective. At Site U1526, we initially elected to undertake RCB corin g in Hole U1526A because the primary target was the volcaniclasti c and basaltic sequences of the seamount. However, sufficient tim e became available after completing operations at Site U1520 near th e end of the expedition that we were able to return to Site U1526 t o obtain a nearly complete section of the sedimentary sequence overlying the seamount in Hole U1526B with APC coring. At Sit e U1519, a highly targeted coring strategy was undertaken to maximize our efficiency with limited time. Here, we opted to spot cor e with the RCB system to collect material only from depths corresponding to the screened intervals of the observatory and in th e lower part of the section where wellbore failures (breakouts) wer e observed in LWD data. A second APC/HLAPC hole targeted shallow temperature measurements at Site U1519. This targeted approach yielded the key data needed to meet expedition scienc e objectives.  

The suite of cores obtained at Sites U1520 and U1526 reveal  a surprising diversity of lithologies entering the subduction zone, including clastic trench fill material, carbonate-rich pelagic sediments, and a thick volcaniclastic sequence. Postexpedition researc h focused on the composition, diagenetic state, and physical properties of these lithologies will reveal the role that they play in SSE occurrence. Of particular interest are the extensive volcaniclasti c deposits found in the lower portions of Sites U1520 and U1526; th e alteration and diagenetic products of these materials may strongl y influence the frictional properties and fluid content in the SS E source region. Tying the position of the lithologic sequences fro m Sites U1520 and U1526 into regional seismic data will provide important insight into the dominant lithologies in the SSE source region and their along-strike variations. Changes in pore wate r geochemistry observed throughout the section suggest evidence fo r recent fluid flow in lithologies recovered from the lower half of Sit e U1520. Fluid geochemistry also shows changes due to rapid sedimentation events in the upper, clastic portion of Site U1520.  

At Site U1518, coring across an active shallow thrust fault provided new insights into the fault architecture, small-scale structural features, physical properties, and pore fluid geochemistry of an active fault that may be involved in SSEs. Postexpedition investigations will illuminate the hydrological and mechanical behavior o f this active fault, particularly investigations related to fault structur e and microstructures; analysis of pore fluid geochemistry variation s across the fault; and laboratory studies of fault and wall rock friction, strength, and hydrological properties. These studies will als o strongly complement the insights gained from the observatory samples and data (see above).  

Drilling at Site U1519 aimed to characterize the upper plat e physical and mechanical properties and thermal state. The approach of targeted spot coring was successful in obtaining sample s needed to robustly interpret observatory pressure and temperatur e data and to extract quantitative information about in situ stres s state from wellbore breakouts deeper than $\mathord{\sim}590$ mbsf. Temperatur e measurements in the APC hole were also successful and provid e valuable constraints for models that will define the thermal structure of the subduction zone and the temperature regime of the SS E source region.  

Although the Expedition 375 priorities were focused on slo w slip at subduction zones, we also recovered material that will giv e new insights into a range of other processes. Tephra layers, sometimes as thick as $1.5\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , were encountered throughout Sites U1518– U1520. These layers provide a nearly complete and continuous record of volcanic events at the Hikurangi subduction zone since th e inception of subduction at the Hikurangi-Kermadec-Tonga Trench.  

Postexpedition research on the tephra will reveal changes in th e magnitude, frequency, and source of arc volcanism. Pre-expeditio n interpretation of seismic reflection images suggested that Sit e U1520 would intersect the distal portions of the $\sim\!3150\;\mathrm{km}^{3}$ Ruatoria debris avalanche deposit (Collot et al., 2001). However, evidenc e of mass transport processes in cores recovered from this unit i s equivocal; further investigation is needed to determine if Site U152 0 did indeed intersect the Ruatoria debris avalanche deposit. If so, th e cores may provide important insights into processes associated wit h the emplacement of this massive debris avalanche deposit. Dating o f basaltic material and detailed biostratigraphic and sedimentologica l investigation of sedimentary sequences recovered from Site U152 6 will yield improved constraints on Hikurangi Plateau development, including its vertical tectonic history.
