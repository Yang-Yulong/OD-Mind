# Abstract  

International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expeditio n 390C was implemented in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic and occupied sites proposed for the postponed Expedition s 390 and 393. The objectives for Expedition 390C were to core on e hole at each site with the advanced piston corer/extended core barrel (APC/XCB) system to basement for gas safety monitoring and t o install a reentry system with casing through the sediment to between $\sim\!5\textrm{m}$ above basement and $<\!5\textrm{m}$ into basement in a secon d hole. These operations will expedite basement drilling during th e rescheduled South Atlantic Transect Expeditions 390 and 393. Th e six primary sites for those expeditions form a transect perpendicular to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on the South American plate, overlying crust ranging in age from 7 to $61\,\mathrm{\,\ensuremath{Ma}}$ . Basement coring wil l increase our understanding of how crustal alteration progresse s over time across the flanks of a slow/intermediate spreading ridg e and how microorganisms survive in deep subsurface environments. Sediment will be used in paleoceanographic and microbiologica l studies. Expedition 390C started in Kristiansand, Norway, an d ended in Cape Town, South Africa, after 31 days of operations. W e cored a single APC/XCB sediment hole to the contact with har d rock material at four of the six sites and successfully installed reentry systems with casing at three. Two failed attempts at drilling i n casing and a reentry system into hard rock at Site U1558 indicat e that the Dril-Quip reentry cones and running tools are incompatible with use in hard rock because the release mechanism does no t work when the casing string weight cannot be fully removed fro m the running tool. Therefore, at Sites U1558 and U1559, casing wa s installed to ${\sim}10\,\mathrm{m}$ above basement. Site U1557 has a thick sedimen t cover $(564\;\mathrm{m})$ and will require multiple casing strings to reach basement; a single $16^{\circ}$ casing string was installed to 60 meters belo w seafloor at this site, and later expeditions will extend casing.  

# Introduction  

Expedition 390C was conceived in response to the globa l COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in the postponement of multipl e International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) expeditions i n 2020 and 2021. With science parties unable to travel to the vessel, we were nonetheless able to utilize vessel time by sending a smal l team of IODP staff to complete engineering work in advance o f IODP South Atlantic Transect (SAT) Expeditions 390 and 393. Th e objectives for Expedition 390C were to core one hole at each sit e with the advanced piston corer/extended core barrel (APC/XCB ) system to basement for gas safety monitoring and to install a reentry system with casing through the sediment to between $\sim\!5\,\textrm{m}$ above basement and $<\!5\textrm{m}$ into basement in a second hole. Havin g reentry systems in place at each site decreases the operational ris k of the SAT expeditions and better guarantees we recover the material needed to achieve the science objectives. The APC/XCB core s recovered during Expedition 390C will be considered part of Expeditions 390 and 393.  

result in significant interdisciplinary contributions to our understanding of Earth processes. Transects of drill holes that sampl e both the sediment cover and the uppermost oceanic crust in a particular ocean basin can provide essential knowledge of how interconnected  processes  have  evolved  over  Earth’s  history  an d responded to changes in external drivers such as atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentrations, oceanic gateways, or major ocean currents. Transects that sample tens of millions of years of ocean crust formed a t the same mid-ocean ridge (MOR) can provide important information about the duration of hydrothermal exchange. However, sampling both the sediment and the underlying basaltic basement in  a specific ocean region has rarely been undertaken in a systemati c manner, and the few transects accomplished cover relatively shor t intervals of Earth history (e.g., Juan de Fuca Ridge, $0{-}3.5\;\mathrm{Ma}$ [Shipboard Scientific Party, 1997; Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Expedition 327 Scientists, 2011], and Costa Rica Rift, 0–7 Ma [Anderson, Honnorez, Becker, et al., 1985]).  

Expeditions 390 and 393 will recover complete sedimentary sections and the upper ${\sim}250\mathrm{~m~}$ of underlying ocean crust at six site s along  a  slow/intermediate  spreading  rate  Mid-Atlantic  Ridg e (MAR) crustal flow line at ${\sim}31^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Figure F1). The expeditions wil l operate in a region last visited during Deep Sea Drilling Projec t (DSDP) Leg 3, which helped verify theories of seafloor spreadin g and plate tectonics. After 50 years of advances in drilling technologies and analytical capabilities, we expect that a new transect wil l  

On average, there is a discernible conductive heat flow defici t out to $65\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust (e.g., Stein and Stein, 1994), indicating that ther e is significant advection of heat from the cooling of the oceanic lithosphere out to this age. However, basement hydrological flow ca n occur in crust of all ages if sufficient hydrologic heads can be established because crustal age is only one of a suite of interlinked parameters  that  includes  spreading  rate,  basement  roughness, volcanic stratigraphy, and flow morphology as well as sedimen t type, thickness, and completeness of basement blanketing. Thes e parameters influence the duration, depth, and intensity of off-axi s hydrothermal fluid flow. Simple relationships may not exist between crustal age, fluid flow, thermal and chemical exchange, an d biological activity. Figure F2 summarizes potential relationships between these parameters.  

# Background  

# Geological setting  

Expeditions 390 and 393 will operate near the DSDP Leg 3 transect $(\mathrm{\sim}31^{\circ}\mathrm{S})$ , but a new transect was selected with sites that will (1 ) target basement formed along the same crustal flow line at simila r rates $({\sim}13{-}25\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ half rate) (Table T1) and (2) recover sections o f slow-spreading crust of comparable ages to the ocean crust reference sections in Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Holes 504B (7 Ma ) (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1993) and 1256D (15 Ma) (Wilson et al., 2003; Expedition 309/312 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012), which are located in intermediate- and superfastspreading crust, respectively. The site locations were chosen to optimize recovery of material required to achieve multidisciplinar y objectives. Thicker sediment layers are frequently targeted by scientific drilling to maximize the resolution of paleoceanographic records. However, this decision has biased our sampling of in sit u upper ocean crust to regions with thick sedimentary cover (fo r holes that penetrate ${>}100\ \mathrm{m}$ into basement), which drilling as par t of the SAT expeditions seeks to remediate (Figure F3). Rapid deposition of sediment seals crust off from the oceans, resulting i n anomalously hot basement temperatures and potentially causin g premature cessation of hydrothermal circulation. Consequently, most SAT target sites have sediment cover that is close to the globa l average thickness for their crustal age (Spinelli et al., 2004). However, because seafloor roughness is greater in slow-spreading ocea n basins than in fast-spreading basins (Spinelli et al., 2004), there ar e significant variations in sediment thickness and the continuity o f coverage along the transect. Basement crops out at all ages alon g the transect (Estep et al., 2019) (Figure F4), and these topographi c variations likely impact the crustal hydrogeology. Two sites lie ${\sim}6.7$ km apart on crust estimated to be 61 Ma; crust at Site U1556 underlies $278~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment, and Site U1557 (proposed Site SATL-56A ) basalts underlie $564\;\mathrm{m}$ of sediment.  

The sediment sections cored at the 61 Ma sites (U1556 an d U1557) are expected to capture key Paleogene hyperthermals, including the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), and th e underlying basement will record the cumulative hydrothermal alteration of the uppermost crust across the entire SAT. The 7 Ma sit e (U1559) provides the young end-member for investigating the evolution of hydrothermal and microbiological systems with crusta l age and allows comparison with similar-aged intermediate spreading rate crust from Hole 504B (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1993). The 31 Ma (proposed Site SATL-33B) and $49\;\mathrm{Ma}$ (U1558) sites fil l critical gaps in our ocean crust and deep biosphere sampling wit h respect to basement age and major changes in ocean chemistr y (Coggon et al., 2010). The 15 Ma site (proposed Site SATL-25A) wa s chosen for comparison to Hole 1256D (Wilson et al. 2003; Expedition 309/312 Scientists, 2006; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012).  

DSDP Leg 3 drilling results provide an indication of what to expect in the sedimentary columns of the SAT sites (Scientific Party, 1970). During Leg 3, 10 sites were drilled in the equatorial an d South Atlantic Ocean between Senegal and Brazil, including 7 site s along a transect across the MAR that penetrated to basement (Site s 14–20). The basal sediment ages were within a few million years o f the inferred magnetic anomaly ages, which is consistent with a hal f spreading rate of ${\sim}20\ \mathrm{mm/y}$ since $76\,\mathrm{Ma}$ . Recovery in the cored intervals was typically high $(>\!98\%)$ , but the sediments were only spo t cored, and there are significant gaps between cored intervals. Th e recovered cores make up an almost continuous Lower Cretaceou s to Pleistocene composite stratigraphic section. All sites yielded calcareous sediments with calcareous nannoplankton and planktoni c foraminifers.  

# Seismic studies/site survey data  

The SAT is located along a crustal flow line where fractur e zones are far apart, magnetic lineations are clear, and there is little disruption in seafloor bathymetry (Figure F1). The Crustal Reflectivity Experiment Southern Transect (CREST) cruise aboar d the research vessel (R/V) Marcus G. Langseth in January and February  2016  conducted  a  detailed  geophysical  survey (http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/IEDA/500255) of the area, including  a $1500\,\mathrm{km}$ multichannel seismic reflection profile from the ridge cres t to the Rio Grande Rise spanning $0{-}70\;\mathrm{Ma}$ crust, two shorter ridgecrossing profiles spanning $0{-}7\,\mathrm{Ma}$ crust, and five ridge-parallel profiles. Ocean bottom seismometer profiles were acquired coinciden t with the ridge-parallel profiles. Gravity, magnetics, multibeam bathymetry, and backscatter data were also acquired. Figure F4 show s seismic reflection profiles for Expedition 390C sites.  

The present-day MAR axis at $30^{\circ}{-}32^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ has a well-defined axia l valley with two inferred active hydrothermal vents (Schmid et al., 2019). The CREST seismic survey crossed a ridge segment that i s ${\sim}100\ \mathrm{km}$ long and bounded to the north and south by ridge offset s ${\sim}16$ to ${\sim}22~\mathrm{km}$ in width. The absence of domal structures, whic h would represent oceanic core complexes (OCCs) formed by detachment faulting, near the ridge axis and the well-defined marine magnetic anomalies on the ridge flanks (Cande and Kent, 1995) ar e consistent with the accretion of Penrose-type layered magmati c crust.  

Kardell et al. (2019) calculated ages and spreading rates fro m magnetic data acquired during the CREST cruise. Ages of the primary sites are estimated at 6.6, 15.2, 30.6, 49.2, and $61.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ wit h half spreading rates of 17.0, 25.5, 24.0, 19.5, and $13.5\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{}}$ , respectively (Table T1). If $20\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ is used to separate slow and intermediate spreading rates (Perfit and Chadwick, 1998), then the primar y sites were emplaced at both slow and intermediate spreading rates.  

Seismic imaging along the CREST transect shows, at all age s from 0 to $65\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , an abundance of unsedimented, exposed basemen t outcrops that may allow the ingress and egress of seawater and ridg e flank hydrothermal fluids. This suggests that the crust is never full y sealed by sediment at these ages (Estep et al., 2019) and that ther e may be long-lived and ongoing connection between the oceans an d uppermost basaltic crust with implications for biogeochemical exchanges and subsurface microbial activity. All primary and alternat e sites are positioned in localized sedimentary basins that are image d on seismic reflection profiles. Unsedimented basement ridges ar e within $1{-}2~\mathrm{km}$ of most primary sites (Figure F4). Sediment thicknesses were calculated using a constant sediment velocity of 180 0 $\mathbf{m}/\mathbf{s}$ .  

# Scientific objectives  

The primary objective for Expedition 390C is to lay the foundation for Expeditions 390 and 393 by coring a single hole to contac t with hard rock and installing reentry systems and casing at eac h site. By completing reentry system installations in advance, we better guarantee that the operational goals for Expeditions 390 and 39 3 (coring multiple APC/XCB sediment holes and drilling $250~\mathrm{m}$ int o basement at each site) can be achieved. For the APC/XCB hole a t each site, we intended to capture the sediment/basement interfac e using the XCB system with a polycrystalline diamond compac t (PDC) cutting shoe and advance up to $10\;\mathrm{m}$ into hard rock materia l to (a) identify the depth of the contact with hard rock and (b) recover this critical boundary for future sampling and study. The assumption was that this system may provide cleaner recovery of th e interface by causing only minimal disturbance and yielding high recovery compared to rotary core barrel (RCB) coring systems. Thi s interface is critical to documenting chemical exchange, alteration, and microbiological processes.  

Because the APC/XCB cores collected during Expedition 390 C will be treated as Expedition 390 and 393 samples, an additional objective of Expedition 390C was to measure ephemeral properties o f the APC/XCB cores. These include in situ formation temperatur e measurements made with the advanced piston corer temperatur e (APCT-3) tool, physical properties, line scan images, X-ray image s on the whole-round (WR) and split-core tracks, and paleomagneti c measurements on the archive halves. In addition, we collected on e sample per core for headspace gas analysis as well as one to two W R samples per core for chemical analysis of interstitial water (IW). Geochemical data will guide chemical and microbiological sampling during Expeditions 390 and 393. A final objective was to collect samples to be distributed to micropaleontologists staffed o n Expeditions 390 and 393 so a preliminary biostratigraphic ag e model can be developed.  

Expeditions 390 and 393 have three main scientific objectives.  

1. Objective 1 (primary): quantify the timing, duration, and extent of ridge flank hydrothermal fluid-rock exchange.  

# Scientific justification  

Hydrothermal circulation at MORs and across their vast ridg e flanks influences tectonic, magmatic, and microbial processes on  a global scale; is a fundamental component of global biogeochemica l cycles of key elements and isotopes (e.g., O, S, Mg, Fe, Li, B, Tl, an d $^{87}\mathrm{Sr})$ ; and facilitates geological $C O_{2}$ sequestration within the ocea n crust. The chemical and isotopic composition of seawater reflect s the dynamic balance between riverine inputs from the continents, burial of marine sediments, and hydrothermal exchanges with th e ocean crust (e.g., Palmer and Edmond, 1989). Ocean crust is youn g and chemically homogeneous compared to continental crust, an d its chemical exchanges with seawater are limited to a few relativel y well-known reactions. Consequently, hydrothermal contribution s to ocean chemistry are simpler to reconstruct than riverine input s (Coggon and Teagle, 2011; Davis et al., 2003; Vance et al., 2009). Knowledge of the rates and magnitudes of hydrothermal exchange s will help us to decipher the changing global conditions responsibl e for past variations in seawater chemistry such as mountain building, changes in seafloor spreading rate, large igneous province emplacement, changing climate, and evolution of biological systems. Building this knowledge requires ocean basin–wide transects acros s ridge flanks with different hydrogeologic histories.  

Conductive heat flow deficits indicate that, on average, hydrothermal exchange persists at low temperatures $\scriptstyle(<<100^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ to $65\;\mathrm{Ma}$ on the ridge flanks (Stein and Stein, 1994). Given the vast extent o f the ridge flanks, the hydrothermal fluid flux through them is man y orders of magnitude greater than that through high-temperatur e $(\leq\!400^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ axial systems (Mottl, 2003) and is likely important for elements for which fluid-rock exchange occurs at low temperature s (e.g., Mg, K, S, Li, B, C, and $\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O})$ ). Hydrothermally altered ocea n crust provides a time-integrated record of geochemical exchang e with seawater manifested through changes in its chemical and isotopic composition, mineral assemblages, and physical propertie s (e.g., porosity, permeability, and seismic properties). The intensit y of seawater-basalt exchange depends on the crustal age, architecture and thermal history, sediment cover, and spreading rate. Consequently, hydrothermal contributions to global geochemical cycle s depend on the global length of slow-, intermediate-, and fastspreading ridges and the age-area distribution of the ridge flanks, which varied significantly throughout the Phanerozoic (Müller e t al., 2008). However, the impact of these variations on geochemica l cycles is uncertain because the magnitude and spatial and tempora l distribution of crust-seawater hydrothermal exchanges are poorl y quantified. For example, the role of MOR spreading in controllin g past atmospheric $C O_{2}$ and hence climate remains controversial (Al t and Teagle, 1999; Berner et al., 1983; Gillis and Coogan, 2011; Staudigel et al., 1989) because of uncertainties regarding the rate, extent, and duration of hydrothermal $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ precipitation due to ou r sparse sampling of intermediate age ocean crust (Figure F5). Th e hydrothermal carbonates that sequester $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the ocean crust als o record the composition of the fluids from which they precipitat e (Coggon et al., 2004) and provide an exciting opportunity to develo p medium-resolution records of past ocean chemistry (e.g., $\mathrm{Mg/Ca}$ and $\mathrm{Sr}/\mathrm{Ca})$ (Coggon and Teagle, 2011; Coggon et al., 2010; Rausch e t al., 2013), which integrates past changes in major Earth system processes such as plate tectonics, mountain building, and climate. However, this approach is limited by sparse sampling of ocean crus t of a variety of ages.  

Drilling experiments on the Juan de Fuca Ridge flank were a ke y investigation of hydrothermal evolution across a ridge flank bu t were restricted to young $^{<3.6\ \mathrm{Ma})}$ , intermediate-spreading (2 9 $\mathrm{mm/y}$ half spreading rate) crust (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1997; Expedition 301 Scientists, 2005; Expedition 327 Scientists, 2011). There is a dearth of holes in $20{-}120\ \mathrm{Ma}$ intact in situ MOR crus t and no significant penetrations $\left(>\!100\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ of $46{-}120\ \mathrm{Ma}$ crust (Figure F5) (Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012). Consequently, the critica l thermal, hydrogeologic, chemical, and microbial transitions acros s the ridge flanks remain unknown (Figure F2). Our current samplin g of in situ upper ocean crust $\left(>\!100\mathrm{~m}\right)$ is biased toward areas wit h anomalously thick sediment for their crustal ages (Figure F3), an d the majority of holes in ocean crust older than $35\;\mathrm{Ma}$ penetrate intermediate- or fast-spreading crust. The recovery of uppermos t basement sections along the SAT across slow/intermediate-spreading MAR crust will address these sampling gaps with respect to age, spreading rate, and sediment thickness.  

Crustal accretion along the northern MAR is complex, an d there are significant regions where spreading is accommodated b y amagmatic extension by detachment faults that exhume sections o f deep lithosphere to form OCCs (Mallows and Searle, 2012). However, a recent survey of the modern southern MAR during Cruis e MSM25 of the R/V Maria S. Merian (2013) found no OCCs between $25^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ and $33^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ (Devey, 2014). This, combined with the relatively well defined marine magnetic anomalies on the souther n MAR flanks (Maus et al., 2009), is consistent with accretion of intac t magmatic crust. Because the ${\sim}31^{\circ}\mathrm{S}$ SAT follows a crustal flow lin e through a relatively long spreading segment $\langle{\sim}100~\mathrm{km})$ away fro m major transform faults, we expect a Penrose-type stratigraphy of lavas overlying dikes and gabbros to have been accreted along th e transect (Penrose Conference Participants, 1972).  

# Expected outcomes  

Hydrothermal alteration of basement cores will be investigate d using a combination of petrological and geochemical analyses, radiometric dating, and detailed quantitative core logging of roc k types, alteration features, and veins. The recovery of thinly sedimented slow/intermediate-spreading ocean crust along the proposed SAT will provide the following opportunities:  

• To determine the nature, rates, magnitudes, distribution, and duration of hydrothermal alteration across the ridge flank; • To investigate the effect of titanomagnetite/titanomaghemite alteration on the magnetic anomaly signal to elucidate its origin; • To compare hydrothermal alteration of the uppermost slow/intermediate-spreading crust with crust of similar ages produced at faster spreading ridges (e.g., Holes 504B and 1256D); • To evaluate the effect of changes in global spreading rates and the age-area distribution of the seafloor on hydrothermal contributions to global biogeochemical cycles; and • To investigate signatures of changing ocean chemistry in the hydrothermal record and develop medium-resolution records of past ocean chemistry using hydrothermal minerals (following Coggon et al., 2010).  

It will also allow us to test the following hypotheses:  

• Hydrothermal chemical exchange ceases within 20 My of crustal formation. • Basement topography and sedimentation history affect the rate and duration of hydrothermal alteration.  

2. Objective 2 (primary): investigate sediment- and basementhosted microbial community variation with substrate composition and age  

# Scientific justification  

Scientific ocean drilling has revealed that microorganisms, Archaea, Bacteria, and eukaryotic fungi and protists are present, intact, and metabolically active in uncontaminated deep subsurfac e sediment and basalt. Knowledge about subseafloor microbial communities has grown exponentially since the initial microbial investigations by DSDP in the 1980s, but ${<}4\%$ of ODP/Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program/IODP sites sampled have been sampled, documented, or archived for microbiological purposes (Kallmeyer et al., 2012; Orcutt et al., 2014). Determining microbial community composition and physiological capabilities along the SAT will provid e insights into the role of microbes in mineral alteration, hydrocarbo n formation, and global biogeochemical cycles.  

In sediments, the number of microbial cells present is estimate d to equal that in the entire oceanic water column (Kallmeyer et al., 2012). However, the amount of biomass stored in the deep subsurface remains contentious because microbial cell abundance in subseafloor sediment varies by approximately five orders of magnitud e with significant geographic variation in the structure of subseafloo r communities (Inagaki et al., 2006). The majority of studies have focused on relatively high biomass continental shelf systems (Inagak i and Orphan, 2014). Recent efforts, including Integrated Ocea n Drilling Program Expeditions 329 (South Pacific Gyre; Expeditio n 329 Scientists, 2011) and 336 (North Pond; Expedition 336 Scientists, 2012), investigated lower biomass sedimentary systems underlying oceanic gyres. Crucially, no data have been collected from th e South Atlantic Gyre. Such data would refine the global biomass census and improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle.  

The presence or absence of oxygen in marine sediments ha s profound implications for the quantity, diversity, and function o f microbial communities. Oxygen penetration depth varies betwee n oceanic regions and settings, ranging from only a few millimeters i n areas with high rates of microbial respiration, such as on continental shelves, to the entire sediment column in extremely low biomas s sediments, such as those beneath the South Pacific Gyre (D’Hond t et al., 2015). Extrapolation of an observed global relationship between oxygen penetration and sedimentation rate and thickness indicates SAG sediment may be oxic to basement (D’Hondt et al., 2015). During Leg 3, oxygen was not measured, but sulfate was detected near the basement. However, sediment organic carbon concentrations along the SAT are intermediate to those of North Pond, where oxygen penetrated tens of meters below seafloor and nitrat e was present to basement, and Nankai Trough, where oxygen wa s depleted by 3 meters below seafloor (mbsf) and sulfate was deplete d by 19 mbsf (Expedition 336 Scientists, 2012; Tobin et al., 2009; Orcutt et al., 2013; Reese et al., 2018). This indicates that oxygen is unlikely to extend to the basement at sites along the SAT, contrary t o model predictions (D’Hondt et al., 2015), and that the classical redox succession of oxygen respiration followed by nitrate reduction, potentially followed by metal reduction, may be present. However, we hypothesize that oxygen will be reintroduced at the bottom o f the sediment column as a result of oxygenated fluid flow in the uppermost volcanic basement, which is the case at North Pond (Expedition 336 Scientists, 2012). The recovery of the sediment packag e will allow us to address this conundrum regarding oxygen penetration, biomass, and carbon limitation of microbial activity.  

We will compare the phylogenetic diversity, functional structure, and metabolic activity of SAG communities with results fro m previously studied regions. By exploiting the variations in sedimen t carbon composition expected across the subsiding MOR flank, w e can examine the response of autotrophy versus heterotrophy to carbonate chemistry. Additionally, previous studies of the sedimentar y deep biosphere have explored community diversity based on siteto-site or downhole (age) comparisons, often implicitly assuming  a similar “starter community” that colonized the seafloor and whos e structure and function subsequently changed in response to evolving geochemical conditions or burial depth. However, recent wor k suggests energy limitation may preclude replication (Lever et al., 2015; Lomstein et al., 2012) and thus limit community changes. Th e proposed age-transect approach will allow us to test this assumption directly by investigating the impact of burial depth and chemical zonation on sediment of the same age and hence the sam e starter community.  

Given the dearth of basement holes in ocean crust of intermediate age, there are no microbiological samples across the critica l ridge–flank transitions in basement properties that may affect microbial communities (Figure F2). The majority of biological alteration of subseafloor basalts is thought to occur within $20~\mathrm{My}$ o f crustal formation (Bach and Edwards, 2003). However, microbiological investigations of oceanic basement have focused on youn g $\left(<10\;\mathrm{Ma}\right)$ crust (Jungbluth et al., 2013; Lever et al., 2013; Mason e t al., 2010; Orcutt et al., 2011) or older $^{\prime}{>}65\mathrm{~Ma})$ lava associated wit h hotspot volcanism along the Louisville Seamount Trail (Expeditio n 330 Scientists, 2012; Sylvan et al., 2015). Basement outcrops tha t penetrate the relatively impermeable sediment provide permeabl e conduits that facilitate subseafloor fluid circulation in older basement  (Wheat  and  Fisher,  2008).  Fluid  flow  across  the  sediment/basement interface can produce redox gradients that provid e recharge of depleted electron acceptors (e.g., oxygen and nitrate) t o basal sediments, as observed above 3.5 and 8 Ma ocean crust on th e Juan de Fuca Ridge flank (Engelen et al., 2008) and at North Pon d (Orcutt et al., 2013), respectively. However, the extent and duratio n of fluid flow through this interface across the ridge flanks remain s unknown (Figure F2). The recovery of the uppermost basaltic basement from 7 to 61 Ma along the SAT will allow us to determin e whether microbial populations are indeed present in basemen t older than $20\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and to investigate the nature, extent, and duratio n of communication between the sedimentary and crustal biospher e for the first time.  

# Expected outcomes  

We will sample subseafloor populations of Bacteria, Archaea, and microbial eukaryotes in both the sedimentary and upper crusta l ecosystems along the proposed transect, quantify their biomass b y cell enumeration, identify them using molecular biology methods, measure the stable isotopic composition (C, N, and S) of sedimen t and basement to relate processes to geochemistry, measure thei r metabolic activities using a variety of incubation assays, and resolv e their physiological adaptations with omics-based approaches wit h the following aims:  

• To evaluate cell abundance and community activity in the lowenergy subseafloor biosphere of the SAG and refine estimates of global subseafloor sedimentary microbial abundance; • To resolve model predictions about the depth of oxygen penetration into sediment from overlying seawater and into the bot  

tom of the sediment package from oxygenated fluid in basement;   
• To evaluate the role of subseafloor microbes in sediment biogeochemistry and basement alteration and hence global biogeochemical cycles; and   
• To investigate how aging of the ocean crust influences the composition of the crustal biosphere, particularly the effects of changing oxidation state and permeability on microbial abundance, diversity, and function.  

Our samples will also allow us to test the following hypotheses:  

• SAG microbial communities share membership and function with both oligotrophic sediments, like those found at North Pond, and open ocean systems with higher organic matter input, such as the Nankai Trough, given the intermediate organic carbon content of the SAT sites.   
• Microbial community structure and diversity depend on the starter community (and hence sediment age) rather than subsequent selection driven by burial or chemical zonation.   
• Crustal biomass decreases with increasing basement age, and communication between the sedimentary and crustal biosphere ceases within $20\,\mathrm{My}$ .   
• Microbial diversity increases within subseafloor basalts with basement age as previously demonstrated in basalts exposed on the seafloor (Lee et al., 2015; Santelli et al., 2009).  

3. Objective 3 (secondary): investigate the responses of Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns and the Earth’s climate system to rapid climate change including elevated atmospheric $C O_{2}$ during the Cenozoic  

# Scientific justification  

Climate change due to increased atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ poses significant and imminent threats to global society and the environment. Knowledge of past ocean circulation patterns and temperatures i s required to assess the efficacy of numerical models in simulating intervals of high $\mathrm{{pCO}_{2}}$ . High $\mathrm{pCO_{2}}$ intervals are often characterize d by relatively shallow lysocline and calcite compensation depth s (CCDs) resulting in poor preservation of $\mathrm{CaCO_{3}}$ microfossils use d to reconstruct paleoceanographic records. This problem can b e overcome by coring sediment deposited on basement slightly olde r than the targeted sediment age that accumulated prior to therma l subsidence of the seafloor below the CCD. More continuous composite stratigraphic sequences are obtained by drilling multiple site s along a crustal age transect, a strategy successfully employed durin g ODP Leg 199 (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2002) and Integrate d Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 320/321 (Pälike et al., 2012). The Walvis Ridge depth transect sampled during ODP Leg 20 8 demonstrated the dynamic nature of the Cenozoic CCD and lysocline in the southeastern Atlantic (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004 ) and the value of redrilling previous transects to collect more complete records of Earth’s history. Although spot cored, Leg 3 site s demonstrate moderate to excellent carbonate preservation alon g the SAT (Scientific Party, 1970) and the location’s suitability fo r high-resolution paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic reconstructions through key intervals of rapid climate change (Cramer et al., 2009; Zachos et al., 2001, 2008), including the PETM and othe r short-lived hyperthermals, early and middle Eocene climatic optima, the onset of Antarctic glaciation across the Eocene/Oligocen e boundary (Oi1 event), multiple Oligocene and Miocene glaciatio n events (Oi and Mi events), the Miocene climatic optimum an d  

Monterey Carbon Excursion, Pliocene warmth, and the onset o f Northern Hemisphere glaciation.  

Global ocean circulation transfers heat and nutrients around th e globe, both influencing and responding to changes in Earth’s climate system (Broecker, 1991; Stommel, 1961; Wunsch, 2002). Fortuitously, the western intensification of ocean currents means w e can substantially reconstruct deepwater mass properties and thu s thermohaline circulation history by characterizing western portions of major ocean basins using drilling transects. The wester n South Atlantic is the main northward flow path of Antarctic Botto m Water and southward flow path of North Atlantic Deep Water an d their precursor water masses. Consequently, the SAT cores will provide complementary data needed to constrain the evolution of thermohaline circulation patterns and climate change as the Drak e Passage and Southern Ocean opened, the northern North Atlanti c deepwater gateway opened, and the Tethys Ocean became restricted to thermohaline circulation. In particular, these cores wil l assist in establishing how high-latitude sea surface (and hence dee p ocean) temperatures and the CCD varied in response to $\mathrm{{pCO}_{2}}$ changes and ocean acidification (Barker and Thomas, 2004; Barrer a et al., 1997; Billups, 2002; Bohaty et al., 2009; Cramer et al., 2009; Frank and Arthur, 1999; Kennett and Stott, 1991; Scher and Martin, 2006; Thomas et al., 2003; Wright et al., 1991, 1992). The SAT wil l yield a complementary record to western North Atlantic sediment s (Expedition 342; Norris et al., 2014), and together these data wil l provide an exceptional record of the evolution of Atlantic overturning circulation through the Cenozoic.  

A novel, direct way to compare paleoceanographic reconstructions of past high $\mathrm{pCO_{2}}$ to modern conditions is to recover sediments along transects of water column data collected by the Worl d Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The SAT constitutes  a “paleo-WOCE” line following the western portion of WOCE Lin e A10 (Figure F1), providing access to paleoceanographic records o f southern- and northern-sourced deep and bottom waters. We wil l test models of bipolar deepwater evolution (e.g., Borelli et al., $2014;$ Cramer et al., 2009; Katz et al., 2011; Tripati et al., 2005) using stabl e and radiogenic isotope analyses of sediments recovered from thes e key western South Atlantic sites.  

The Walvis Ridge depth transect (Shipboard Scientific Party, 2004) revealed a dramatic $2\tan{\mathsf{C C D}}$ shoaling during the PETM du e to the acidification of the ocean from massive carbon addition followed by a gradual recovery (Zachos et al., 2005; Zeebe et al., 2008). Given chemical weathering feedbacks, the recovery of the CC D should have resulted in a transient overdeepening of the CC D (Dickens et al., 1997). Collectively, the SAT sites will provide additional data for reconstructing changes in the position of the lysocline and CCD in the western South Atlantic that are essential fo r constraining the timing of gateway events and the history of Northern Component Water and Southern Component Water, whic h were the precursors to North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarcti c Bottom Water, and the nature of Atlantic basin responses to climat e change relative to the Pacific.  

# Expected outcomes  

Microfossils provide a critical archive of ocean and climate history, including long-term changes (e.g., early Eocene warmth, Cenozoic cooling, and Pliocene warmth) and abrupt events (e.g., earl y Paleogene hyperthermals and multiple glaciation events). Complete sedimentary sections recovered along paleo-WOCE Line A1 0 will exploit thermal subsidence of the ocean crust along the transect to provide material for high-resolution proxy records including  benthic  and  planktonic  foraminiferal  geochemistry, micropaleontological assemblages, orbitally tuned age models, neodymium isotopes, and alkenone $\delta^{13}{\cal C}$ and boron isotope $\mathrm{pCO_{2}}$ reconstructions with the following aims:  

• To reconstruct the evolution of deepwater masses over the past 61 My to assess contributions of Northern Component Water and Southern Component Water in the early Paleogene western South Atlantic (Kennett and Stott, 1990) and to document the influence of the openings of the Drake and Tasman Passages on South Atlantic deepwater circulation;   
• To provide high-resolution constraints on CCD and carbonate chemistry changes of the deep western Atlantic, particularly during transient hyperthermals and other intervals of global warmth;   
• To reconstruct the Cenozoic history of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre by monitoring proxies of productivity and paleobiogeography of oceanic plankton, rates of speciation/extinction relative to those of the equatorial zone and higher latitudes, and changes in biodiversity and subtropical ecosystem dynamics; and   
• To evaluate the response of subtropical planktonic and benthic biota to changing environmental conditions such as global warming, ocean acidification, or fertility patterns during intervals of rapid climate change through the Cenozoic.  

Drilling at these sites will also allow us to test the following hypotheses:  

• Low-latitude sites were potential sources of deep water formation at times of global warmth and high atmospheric $\mathrm{{pCO}_{2}}$ .   
• The strength of the coupling between the climate and the carbon cycle varied through the Cenozoic.   
• The lysocline and CCD responded differently on the western side of the MAR compared to the Walvis Ridge record due to changing deep/bottom water sources, gateway configurations, and flow paths.   
• The subtropical gyre cut off the delivery of heat to Antarctica as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current developed through the late Eocene–Oligocene.  

# Site summaries  

# Beginning of expedition and transit  

Expedition 390C started in Kristiansand, Norway, at $0800\,\mathrm{~h~}$ $\mathrm{(UTC+2\,h)}$ on 5 October 2020 with the arrival and boarding of 1 8 JOIDES Resolution Science Operator (JRSO) personnel on th e JOIDES Resolution. Two additional JRSO staff were already o n board. Three JRSO staff crossed over and departed on the same day. There was no science party on Expedition 390C.  

All arriving personnel followed preboarding protocols to mitigate the risk of a COVID-19 infection on the ship, including a  2 week shelter-in-place period prior to travel, a pretravel COVID-1 9 test, and a 5 day quarantine in a hotel in Kristiansand. Personne l passed three additional COVID-19 tests during this quarantine. Shipboard personnel wore masks and followed social distancin g protocols during the COVID-19 mitigation period.  

The vessel had been tied up for over 1 month (Expedition 390P), during which time the Schlumberger wireline winch heat exchange r was replaced. During port call, final maintenance and deliverie s were completed, including the delivery of new asbestos-free brak e bands for the drawworks.  

The ship departed Kristiansand on 7 October, and the last lin e was released at $0918\,\mathrm{h}$ . The transit from Kristiansand to Site U155 6 was undertaken in two legs. First, the ship transited to Las Palmas, Canary Islands (Spain) for a refueling stop. The voyage took 182.8 5 h (7.6 days) and covered $2144~\mathrm{nmi}$ at an average speed of $11.7~\mathrm{kt}$ . The ship anchored in Las Palmas at $2306\,\mathrm{h}$ on 14 October and fueling began at first light on 15 October. The ship received $1113.6\ \mathrm{mt}$ of fuel oil. While at anchorage, a repaired propulsion motor was recoupled and put back online. Siem Offshore crew tested and maintained the release hooks of the two port lifeboats, lowering them t o the waterline and recovering them. The ship was underway again b y $1454~\mathrm{h}$ . COVID-19 risk mitigation policies were lifted upon departure because it had been more than 14 days since the last possibl e exposure. The transit from Las Palmas to Site U1556 in the Sout h Atlantic Ocean took $299.5\,\mathrm{h}$ (12.5 days) at an average speed of 12. 2 kt and covered $3608\;\mathrm{nmi}$ .  

# Site U1556  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1556 (proposed Site SATL-53B) is in the central South Atlantic Ocean, ${\sim}1250\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the MAR. The objective for Expedition 390C was to core one hole with the APC/XCB system t o basement for gas safety monitoring and to install a reentry syste m with casing through the sediment to ${\sim}5~\mathrm{m}$ into basement in a second hole to expedite basement drilling during SAT Expeditions 39 0 and 393.  

Site U1556 is located on Seismic Line CREST1A/B at commo n depth point (CDP) 3410 near the CREST05 crossing line. A reflector at $\mathord{\sim}6.9$ s two-way traveltime (TWT) was interpreted to be th e top of basement and estimated to be at 180 mbsf (Figure F4). Th e reflector marks a change in seismic character from high-frequenc y layered energy to low-frequency chaotic energy. This site is locate d only $6.7\,\mathrm{km}$ from Site U1557, and the basement at both sites is predicted to be ${\sim}61.2\ \mathrm{Ma}$ and formed at a half spreading rate of ${\sim}13.5$ $\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ . Oceanic crust at these sites is the oldest that will be drilled a s part of the SAT expeditions and will be compared to younge r crustal material. The contrasting sediment thicknesses at thes e closely spaced sites, with Site U1556 being less heavily sedimented, will allow exploration of the effect of sediment thickness on crusta l evolution. Overlying sediment from Site U1556 is expected to b e primarily carbonate ooze and will be used in paleoceanographic an d microbiological studies. Average sediment accumulation rate at thi s site was predicted to be only $2.9\;\mathrm{m/My},$ the lowest of all sites alon g the proposed SAT. As such, microbiological research at this site wil l provide insight into how subsurface microbial communities underneath the low-nutrient South Atlantic Gyre survive.  

# Operations  

The JOIDES Resolution arrived at Site U1556 at $0206~\mathrm{h}$ on 2 8 October 2020. We switched from cruise mode to dynamic positioning (DP) mode at $0230~\mathrm{h}$ and started operations for Hole U1556A. No acoustic beacon was deployed. Hole U1556A is located a t $30^{\circ}56.5244^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $26^{\circ}41.9472^{\prime}\mathrm{W}_{:}$ , and the water depth is 5006.4 meter s below sea level (mbsl). The APC/XCB bottom-hole assembly (BHA ) was made up and deployed. A nonmagnetic drill collar was use d above the outer core barrel to improve the quality of magnetic orientation data collected during APC coring. We lowered the drill bi t to 5006 mbsl and pumped a “pig” (pipe cleaning device) through th e drill string to remove rust. At ${\sim}2200\mathrm{~h~}$ on 28 October, the sinke r bars and core orientation tool were installed and the core barrel wa s lowered. We spudded Hole U1556A at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ . Mudline Core 390C  

U1556A-1H arrived on deck at $2335\mathrm{~h~}$ and recovered $9\,\mathrm{m}$ . Core s 1H–16H advanced to 151.4 mbsf and recovered $155.13\mathrm{~m~}(103\%)$ . All APC cores were oriented with the Icefield MI-5 core orientatio n tool following new procedures to identify any rotation relative t o the core barrel during deployment. Formation temperatures wer e measured on Cores 4H, 7H, 10H, and 13H with the APCT-3 tool. Cores 11H–13H were partial strokes due to the stiffness of the sediment but had good recovery; Cores 14H and 15H were full strokes. Core 16H experienced $60\,\mathrm{klb}$ overpull and had to be drilled over t o release it from the formation. Consequently, we changed to the XC B coring system using the PDC cutting shoe. Cores 17X–29X advanced from 151.4 to $273.6\mathrm{~m~}$ and recovered $79.53\mathrm{~m~}$ $(65\%)$ . Th e rate of penetration was ${<}10\;\mathrm{m/h}$ for Cores 17X–20X and increase d to an average of $15.2\;\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{h}$ for Cores 21X–29X.  

Core 390C-U1556A-30X encountered a hard layer that decreased the rate of penetration dramatically. Upon recovery, thi s layer was confirmed to be hard rock and was determined to be a t 278 mbsf. Cores 31X–33X attempted additional coring of the altered basalt and volcaniclastic material. In total, Cores 30X–33X advanced $5.8\;\mathrm{m}$ into basement and recovered $4.33\mathrm{~m~}(75\%)$ , reaching  a total depth of 283.8 mbsf. The sediment/basement interface in Cor e 30X had the lowest recovery $(23\%)$ , but we experienced higher recovery in subsequent cores $90\%$ for Cores 31X–33X) (Figure F6). Core quality was also high, with the XCB PDC cutting shoe returning nicely trimmed and relatively large pieces. We observed minimal wear on the cutting shoe.  

In summary, Hole U1556A reached a total depth of 283.8 mbs f and recovered $243.78\mathrm{~m~}(86\%)$ , taking 4.1 days of expedition tim e (Table T2; Figure F7). Following recovery of Core 33X, we raise d the pipe to ${\sim}20\;\mathrm{m}$ above seafloor. The seafloor was cleared at 041 0 $^{\mathrm{h,}}$ ending Hole U1556A. We then transited in DP mode to nearb y Site U1557 to conduct APC/XCB coring there. The intention was t o core to basement at Site U1557 and then return to Site U1556 t o install a reentry system with casing. However, the failure of the subsea camera system at Site U1557 made it impossible to complete th e planned reentry system installation at Site U1556. Thus, the end o f Hole U1556A was also the end of Site U1556 for Expedition 390C.  

# Principal results  

Basement was found to be deeper than expected at Site U155 6 based on the initial interpretation of seismic data (278 instead o f $180\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ). A lower reflector at ${\sim}6.95\,\mathrm{s}$ TWT is now identified as th e sediment/basement interface (Figure F4). This basement depth als o increases the average sediment accumulation rate to $4.5\,\mathrm{m/My}$ fro m the original estimate of $2.9\;\mathrm{m/My}$ (Table T1).  

Cores 390C-U1556A-1H through 29X were measured on th e WR and split-core track systems. We collected physical propertie s data, line scan optical images, X-ray images, and paleomagneti c measurements. Basement Cores 30X–33X were measured on th e WR track systems but were not split; they were preserved in nitrogen gas–flushed bags for description and analysis during Expeditions 390 and 393. Core catcher samples were collected fo r postexpedition biostratigraphic dating. In addition, we collecte d one sample per core for headspace gas analysis as well as one to tw o WR samples per core for chemical analysis of IW. Starting wit h Core 17X, we collected $10\,\mathrm{cm}$ instead of $5\thinspace\mathrm{cm}\thinspace\mathrm{WR}$ samples to ensur e enough water was available for standard analyses. No systemati c core description took place during Expedition 390C. Sediment lithology in Hole U1556A alternates between 1 and $10\;\mathrm{m}$ thick layer s of red-brown clay and carbonate ooze with sharp contacts betwee n these lithologies. Analysis of calcium carbonate content conducte d on samples from IW squeeze cakes also demonstrates this alternation. Calcium carbonate content ranges from a minimum of 0.0 8 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ in clay to $92.08\;\mathrm{wt}\%$ in carbonate ooze. Physical properties dat a reflect similar lithologic changes, with higher magnetic susceptibilities and counts of natural gamma radiation (NGR) in the clay layers. $P$ -wave velocity and gamma ray attenuation (GRA) bulk densit y increase downhole with a significant increase in both in basemen t cores. APCT-3 formation temperature measurements from Core s 4H, 7H, $10\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , and 13H ranged from $3.1\mathrm{^{\circ}C}$ to $6.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and had a goo d linear fit.  

Alkalinity generally decreases downhole, although a broad pea k in concentration at intermediate depths $({\sim}150~\mathrm{mbsf})$ and a secondary peak at ${\sim}220$ mbsf may reflect sulfate reduction. Total dissolve d sulfur  concentrations,  as  measured  using  inductively  couple d plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) of IW samples, decrease toward this depth and then level out, not decreasing belo w $22\;\mathrm{mM}$ even at the bottom of the hole. Sulfate concentrations measured by ion chromatography reveal the same trend but are noisie r than the ICP-AES data. Peaks in dissolved manganese and ammonium in the upper half of the hole also indicate active reductive processes and heterotrophic metabolisms. Dissolved iron was belo w the detection limit, likely because it reoxidized and precipitate d during the WR squeezing process. Dissolved silicon and boron ar e inversely correlated, with a sharp peak in silicon concentrations a t an intermediate depth (\~151 mbsf) coinciding with a sharp declin e in boron. Calcium and strontium concentrations reach a broad pea k at an intermediate depth and are lower in the upper and lower part s of the hole. Magnesium and potassium, conversely, are highest i n surface samples, decrease with depth, and then increase agai n slightly near basement. This increase may suggest fluid flow alon g or near the sediment/basement interface.  

All cores excluding the unsplit basement sections were measured on the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) for natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and then at alternating fiel d demagnetization levels of 5, 10, and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . Vertical drilling overprints were ubiquitous but were generally removed by the $5\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step. Many samples appear to show a characteristi c remanent magnetization (ChRM) after $20~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization, although some likely have a higher coercivity component that wil l need to be examined during postexpedition research. APC core s were magnetically oriented, and a correction was applied to th e SRM data for each core. Corrected declinations roughly cluste r around two antipodal locations, assuming a geocentric axial dipol e and some level of paleosecular variation.  

# Site U1557  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1557 (proposed Site SATL-56A) is in the central South Atlantic Ocean, ${\sim}1250\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the MAR. The objective for Expedition 390C is to core one hole with the APC/XCB system t o basement for gas safety monitoring and to install a reentry syste m with casing through the sediment to $\sim\!5\;\mathrm{m}$ above basement in a second hole to expedite basement drilling during SAT Expeditions 39 0 and 393.  

Site U1557 is located on Seismic Line CREST1A/B at CDP 447 0 near the CREST05 crossing line. A reflector at ${\sim}7.2~s$ TWT was interpreted to be the top of basement and estimated to be at 510 mbs f (Figure F4). This site is located only $6.7~\mathrm{km}$ from Site U1556, an d the basement at both sites is estimated to be ${\sim}61.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ , formed at  a half spreading rate of ${\sim}13.5\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}.$ Oceanic crust at these sites is th e oldest that will be drilled as part of the SAT expeditions, and it wil l be compared to younger crustal material. The contrasting sedimen t thicknesses at these closely spaced sites, with Site U1557 bein g more heavily sedimented, will allow exploration of the effect of sediment thickness on crustal evolution. Overlying sediment from Sit e U1557 is expected to be primarily carbonate ooze and will be use d in paleoceanographic and microbiological studies. The thick sediment layers at this site in particular will allow for paleoceanographi c records covering the entire Cenozoic to be developed, including reconstruction of Atlantic Ocean circulation patterns during period s of elevated $C O_{2}$ during the Cenozoic.  

# Operations  

We opted to core and install a reentry system at proposed alternate Site SATL-56A instead of proposed primary Site SATL-54 A because the thinner sediment layer (estimated to be $510~\mathrm{m}$ thick a t Site SATL-56A and $640~\mathrm{m}$ at Site SATL-54A) would allow installation of casing to basement. Stress calculations indicated that casin g could only be installed to $600\;\mathrm{m}$ without exceeding the safe utilization threshold of the drill pipe. The reentry system and casing installation was planned as two stages. First, the reentry cone and fiv e joints of 16 inch casing would be jetted in to ${\sim}60\,\mathrm{mbsf},$ and $10\%$ inc h casing string would then be drilled into basement.  

# Hole U1557A  

We arrived at Site U1557 on 1 November 2020 after moving th e ship in DP mode $6.7\,\mathrm{km}$ east from Site U1556 at an average speed o f $0.9\,\mathrm{kt}$ with the APC/XCB BHA and bit suspended ${\sim}20\,\mathrm{m}$ above seafloor. There was no acoustic beacon deployed. Hole U1557A is located at $30^{\circ}56.4549^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $26^{\circ}37.7912^{\prime}\mathrm{W}.$ . The bit was lowered to 5003. 9 mbsl for the first core based on the expected precision depth recorder seafloor depth of 5011.3 mbsl. The first mudline core cam e back empty. A second mudline core was attempted from a wate r depth of 5009.9 mbsl and also came back empty. The drill string wa s lowered to 5011.9 mbsl for a third attempt. Core 390C-U1557A-1 H overpenetrated and came back with a full core barrel. We thu s ended Hole U1557A and offset the ship $^{20\mathrm{~m~}}$ east to begin Hol e U1557B.  

# Hole U1557B  

Hole U1557B is located at $30^{\circ}56.4547^{\prime}\mathrm{S}$ , $26^{\circ}37.7775^{\prime}\mathrm{W}.$ The hol e was spudded at $1615\ \mathrm{h}$ on 1 November 2020 from a drill strin g depth of $5006.9\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ . Core 390C-U1557B-1H recovered $4.1\textrm{m}$ o f sediment and established the seafloor depth as 5012.3 mbsl. Core s 1H–11H advanced to 99.1 mbsf and recovered $90.95\mathrm{~m~}(92\%)$ . Al l APC cores were taken with a nonmagnetic core barrel and oriente d with the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool following new procedures to identify any rotation relative to the core barrel during deployment. Formation temperatures were measured on Cores 4H, 7H, and 10H using the APCT-3 tool. Cores 2H and 3H had lowe r recovery than expected for APC coring of surface sediment $.68\%$ and $43\%$ , respectively); this result may be explained by one or mor e hard layers near the surface that we were not able to recover. Cor e 11H had to be drilled over to release it from the formation. Consequently, the decision was made to switch to the XCB coring syste m with the PDC cutting shoe.  

XCB coring continued smoothly. Cores 390C-U1557B-12 X through 62X advanced from 99.1 to 562.4 mbsf and recovere d $317.35\mathrm{~m~}(68\%)$ . The sinker bars were removed after a hard laye r was encountered at 239 mbsf. The rate of penetration for Core s 12X–44X averaged $14.6~\mathrm{m/h}$ . Starting with Core 45X, the rate o f penetration decreased substantially in increasingly hard sediment, averaging $5.8~\mathrm{m/h}$ for Cores 45X–62X. We began conducting mu d sweeps with Core 61X and continued mud sweeps on every cor e thereafter. Hard rock was encountered at 564 mbsf in Core 63X. Three additional XCB cores were taken to achieve $10\,\mathrm{m}$ penetratio n into basement. Cores 64X and 65X had low recovery $(<\!50\%)$ , and Core 64X consisted of small rubbly pieces that appeared to ja m in the core liner and core catcher. Core 66X had $100\%$ recovery on  a $2.1~\mathrm{m}$ advance (drilled by time) and returned cohesive pieces of basalt/breccia (Figure F6). Overall, coring in Hole U1557B advance d to 574.0 mbsf and recovered $414.94\mathrm{~m~}(72\%)$ , taking 7.5 days of operational time (Table T2; Figure F7). As at Site U1556, the XC B PDC cutting shoe performed extremely well in Hole U1557B, returning cohesive pieces of hard rock and showing minimal wear. Coring in basement was deliberately kept to $2\,\mathrm{~h~}$ per core, afte r which the core was pulled and the cutting shoe was inspected fo r integrity. No cutters were observed to be lost or damaged.  

After Core 66X was recovered, we prepared for a jet-in test t o determine whether sediment at Site U1557 was appropriate for th e installation of a reentry cone and five joints of 16 inch casing $\left({\sim}60\right.$ m) prior to installation of $10\%$ inch casing to basement. We pulle d out of the hole to ${\sim}30\;\mathrm{m}$ above seafloor, and the bit cleared the seafloor at $0210\,\mathrm{h}$ , ending Hole U1557B.  

# Hole U1557C  

The ship repositioned $20\textrm{m}$ south for the jet-in test, and Hol e U1557C was spudded at $0345\,\mathrm{~h~}$ on 9 November 2020 with th e APC/XCB BHA. The jet-in test advanced to $3\,\mathrm{m}$ before contacting  a hard layer, and we were unable to jet in farther despite increasin g the flow rate. The ship was repositioned $20\;\mathrm{m}$ west for a second jetin test that was also unable to penetrate the seafloor. Because th e jet-in tests were unsuccessful, the top drive was set back and th e drill string was pulled back to the surface. The bit cleared the ri g floor at $1930\,\mathrm{h},$ ending Hole U1557C. This experience provides additional evidence for one or more surface hard layers at this site.  

# Hole U1557D  

A revised plan was made to drill in the reentry cone with fiv e joints of 16 inch casing $\left(\sim\!60\;\mathrm{m}\right)$ using a stinger with a mud motor, underreamer, and drill bit (Figure F8). In preparation for assembling the casing string, the mouse hole and upper guide hor n (UGH) were removed and the reentry cone was moved under th e rotary table on top of the moonpool doors. The casing was made up, lowered through the reentry cone, and latched into the hanger. Th e first three joints were locked and welded. We then tested the mu d motor and underreamer to determine the pump rate required t o open up the arms of the underreamer (50 strokes/min and 35 0 $1\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{inch^{2}})$ . The full casing stinger was assembled with a $14\%$ inch bi t and lowered through the reentry cone. The Dril-Quip running too l at the top of the stinger was latched into the reentry cone. Th e driller lifted the assembly, measuring the weight of the reentry system and checking the engagement of the running tool. The moonpool doors were opened, and the reentry cone, casing, and stinge r assembly were lowered through the splash zone at $1045\,\mathrm{h}$ on $10\,\mathrm{No}\cdot$ - vember 2020. The reentry system was lowered using a controlle d descent to 729.0 meters below rig floor (mbrf) while filling the dril l pipe with water every 10 stands, and the UGH was reinstalled before we continued lowering the drill string.  

When the reentry cone reached ${\sim}4020\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , the subsea camer a system was deployed and lowered quickly until it caught up with th e cone. The camera then began following the cone down. At $0615~\mathrm{h}$ on 11 November and at ${\sim}4900\,\mathrm{mbsl}$ , video feed and communicatio n from the subsea camera system was lost and the system was pulle d back to the surface to diagnose and repair the issue. The telemetr y pod was swapped out for a spare and the system redeployed. At th e same depth $({\sim}4900~\mathrm{mbsl})$ ), video and communication were agai n lost, and the system was pulled back to the surface. In the meantime, Hole U1557D was spudded at $1050\,\mathrm{h}$ on 11 November, an d the reentry cone and five joints of 16 inch casing were successfull y drilled into the sediment to 64.2 mbsf. The driller lost the weight o f the reentry system with casing at $5010.7~\mathrm{{mbsl},}$ , establishing tha t depth as the seafloor depth for Hole U1557D. The Dril-Quip running tool was disconnected from the reentry cone at $1400\;\mathrm{h},$ , without the ability to observe this operation on the subsea camera.  

We determined that the problem with the subsea camera syste m was pressure related. Consequently, we were not able to complet e the installation of $10\%$ inch casing to basement in Hole U1557D. Instead, we decided to transit to Site U1558 and continue coring an d reentry system installations at the other planned sites, where th e water depth is shallower and pressure was not expected to limit us e of the subsea camera.  

The drill string was pulled back to the surface. The UGH wa s removed to recover the Dril-Quip running tool and was then reinstalled after recovery of the running tool and the BHA. The rig floo r was secured at $0908\,\mathrm{h}$ on 12 November for the transit to Site U1558. Overall, Hole U1557D took 2.6 days of expedition time.  

# Principal results  

After basement at Site U1556 was found to be substantiall y deeper than predicted, the seismic data for Site U1557 were also reinterpreted (Figure F4). The revised estimate was 585 mbsf instea d of 510 mbsf. Basement was encountered at 564 mbsf, providing a ti e point for future seismic interpretations.  

Cores 390C-U1557A-1H and 390C-U1557B-1H through 62 X were measured on the WR and split-core track systems. We collected physical properties data, line scan optical images, X-ray images, and paleomagnetic measurements. Basement cores wer e measured on the WR track systems but were not split. Instead, the y were preserved in nitrogen gas–flushed bags for description an d analysis during Expeditions 390 and 393. Core catcher samples wer e collected for postexpedition biostratigraphic dating. In addition, w e collected one sample per core for headspace gas analysis as well a s one WR sample per core for chemical analysis of IW. Starting wit h Core 390C-U1557B-19X, we collected $10~\mathrm{cm}$ instead of $5\ \mathrm{cm\WR}$ samples to ensure enough water was available for standard analyses. No systematic core description took place during Expedition 390C. Sediment lithology alternates between 1 and $_{10\textrm{m}}$ thick layers o f clay and carbonate ooze with sharp contacts in between. Compare d to Hole U1556A, in Hole U1557B clay layers are generally thinne r and carbonate ooze layers are slightly thicker. After Core 32X (bottom depth $=\,296.1$ mbsf), the lithology transitioned toward predominantly carbonate ooze with an average calcium carbonat e content of $86\,\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Rare clay layers are $<\!1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick. Physical properties such as magnetic susceptibility and counts of NGR generall y correlate with lithology, and higher magnetic susceptibility value s and NGR counts are found in the clay layers than in the hard roc k sections. $P$ -wave velocity and GRA density increase downhole wit h a significant increase in both values in basement cores. APCT-3 formation temperature measurements from Cores in Hole U1557 B U1556A-4H, 7H, and 10H ranged from $2.4^{\circ}\!C$ to $4.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and had a relatively good linear fit.  

Alkalinity is high near the top of Hole U1557B, decreases to $\mathord{\sim}75$ mbsf, and then shows a generally increasing trend toward the bottom of the hole. Near basement, alkalinity spikes to $12.3\ \mathrm{mM}$ bu t declines again in the final IW sample collected before reaching har d rock material. Total dissolved sulfur concentrations, as measure d using ICP-AES of IW samples, decrease downhole from surface levels then level out. A sharp decrease in concentration (from ${\sim}24$ t o $19.5\;\mathrm{mM})$ ) is associated with the increase in alkalinity near the bottom of the hole. Sulfate concentrations measured using ion chromatography closely match the sulfur data measured using ICP-AES. Nonetheless, sulfate concentrations remain above $20~\mathrm{mM}$ even a t the bottom of the hole. Peaks in dissolved manganese and ammonium in the upper half of Hole U1557B also indicate active reductive  processes  and  heterotrophic  metabolisms.  A  secondar y dissolved manganese peak occurs at an intermediate depth. Dissolved iron was below the detection limit, likely because it reoxidized and precipitated during the WR squeezing process. Dissolve d silicon and boron are inversely correlated throughout most of th e hole, with a sharp peak in dissolved silicon concentrations in the upper half of the hole coinciding with a sharp decline in boron. Th e depth of this peak $({\sim}168~\mathrm{mbsf})$ is approximately the same as th e depth of the peak in silicon concentrations observed in Hol e U1556A $({\sim}151~\mathrm{mbsf})$ ). Near the bottom of the hole, both dissolve d silicon and boron concentrations increase sharply but decline agai n immediately before reaching basement. Calcium and strontiu m concentrations reach a broad peak at an intermediate depth and ar e lower in the upper and lower parts of the hole top. Magnesium an d potassium, conversely, are highest in surface samples, decrease wit h depth, and then increase again slightly near basement. This increas e may suggest fluid flow along or near the sediment/basement interface.  

All cores excluding the unsplit basement sections were measured on the SRM for NRM and then at alternating field demagnetization levels of 5, 10, and $20~\mathrm{mT}$ . Vertical drilling overprints wer e ubiquitous but were generally removed by the $5~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step. Many samples appeared to show a ChRM after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization,  although  some  likely  have  a  higher  coercivit y component that will need to be examined during postexpedition research. APC cores were magnetically oriented and a correction applied to the SRM data for each core.  

The first deployment of the subsea camera system was also th e inaugural deployment of the newly acquired conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) sensor, which was attached to the subse a camera frame. The deployment was successful and produced quality water column data that will aid in identification of water masses.  

# Site U1558  

# Background and objectives  

Site U1558 (proposed Site SATL-43A) is in the central South Atlantic Ocean, ${\sim}1067\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the MAR. The objective for Expedition 390C was to core one hole with the APC/XCB system t o basement for gas safety monitoring and to install a reentry syste m with casing through the sediment to $\sim\!5\;\mathrm{m}$ above basement in a second hole to expedite basement drilling during SAT Expeditions 39 0 and 393.  

Site U1558 is located on Seismic Line CREST1B/C at CDP 325 2 near the CREST04 crossing line. A reflector at ${\sim}5.9~\mathrm{s}$ TWT was interpreted to be the top of basement and estimated to be at 148 mbs f (Figure F4). Basement is predicted to be $49.2\,\mathrm{Ma}$ and was formed a t a half spreading rate of ${\sim}19.5\;\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{y}$ . Oceanic crust at this site is th e second oldest crust that will be drilled as part of the SAT expeditions, and it will be compared to older and younger crustal materia l recovered along the transect. Overlying sediment from Site U155 8 is expected to be primarily carbonate ooze, and it will be used i n paleoceanographic and microbiological studies.  

# Operations Hole U1558A  

The JOIDES Resolution arrived at Site U1558 on 12 Novembe r 2020 after a $92\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit from Site U1557 at an average speed o f $11.7\,\mathrm{kt}$ and switched to DP mode at $1724\,\mathrm{h}$ . No acoustic beacon wa s deployed. The drill string with the APC/XCB BHA and a nonmagnetic drill collar was lowered, and the bit was spaced out to 4326. 7 mbsl based on the precision depth recorder seafloor depth of 4331. 6 mbsl. The first mudline core attempted came back empty. The bi t was lowered $4\;\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{}}$ , and the core was reshot. Hole U1558A was spudded at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 13 November and recovered $3.46~\mathrm{m},$ , which established a water depth of $4336.8\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . APC Cores 390C-U1558A-1 H through 11H advanced to 94.9 mbsf and recovered $87.87\textrm{m}$ $(92\%)$ . Core 2H experienced low recovery, as at Sites U1556 and U1557, suggesting that there are also one or more hard layers in surfac e sediment at this site. Core 9H was a partial stroke, advancing only  6 m. Core 10H experienced a strong overpull $(70\,\mathrm{klb})$ and was drille d over to release it from the formation. However, because Core 10 H was a full stroke, the decision was made to attempt another AP C core. Core 11H was a full stroke, but it also experienced a stron g overpull and had to be drilled over. The decision was made t o switch to the XCB system with the PDC cutting shoe. Cores 1H– 11H were oriented with the Icefield MI-5 core orientation tool usin g a nonmagnetic core barrel following new procedures to identify an y rotation relative to the core barrel during deployment. Formatio n temperatures were measured using the APCT-3 tool on Cores 4H, 7H, and 10H.  

XCB Cores 390C-U1558A-12X through 19X advanced fro m 94.9 to 163.9 mbsf and recovered $50.82\mathrm{~m~}(74\%)$ . Core 12X had  a broken liner and was pumped out of the core barrel. A hard laye r was encountered at 158.9 mbsf in Core 18X and is tentatively interpreted as the top of basement. Core 18X advanced $2.6\textrm{m}$ into th e hard layer but recovered almost none of it, aside from ${\sim}10~\mathrm{cm}$ o f material in the core catcher. Core 19X advanced an additional $2.4\,\mathrm{m}$ and recovered $2.62~\mathrm{m}$ of basalt $(109\%)$ , making overall recovery o f hard rock material $52\%$ (Figure F6). After Core 19X, we began pulling the drill string back to the surface to prepare for casing and reentry system installation at this site. The bit cleared the rig floor a t $0710\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 November, ending Hole U1558A. The XCB PDC cutting shoe was examined and found to be in good condition, agai n performing exceptionally well in altered basalt material. Overall, coring in Hole U1558A recovered $138.69\;\mathrm{m}$ out of the $163.9\;\mathrm{m}$ advance $(85\%)$ and took 2.6 days of operational time (Table T2; Figur e F7).  

# Hole U1558B  

The ship was offset $20\ \mathrm{m}$ east, and preparations for casing an d reentry system installation began. The Dril-Quip running tool stan d was made up, and the UGH was removed. A casing string of $13\%$ inch casing was made up, followed by a crossover and the 16 inc h casing hanger needed to latch in to the reentry system. The firs t three joints were locked and welded. Sea conditions were unfavorable, and one of the joints was cross threaded during assembly an d had to be removed from the string. A replacement casing joint wa s added, which shortened the casing string slightly to $159.3\mathrm{~m~}$ . Th e plan was for the casing to extend slightly into basement and allo w for a second $10\%$ inch casing string to be added in the future. W e paused operations to wait on weather at $2300\,\mathrm{h}$ on 15 November. The reentry cone was lifted off the moonpool doors, and the are a was secured for rough seas. Operations resumed at ${\sim}0630\,\mathrm{h}$ on 1 6 November 2020. The casing string was lowered and landed in th e reentry cone in the moonpool. The bit, mud motor, and underreamer were made up with the underreamer arms set to open to  a diameter of $15\%$ inches. We conducted a test to determine th e pump rate required to open the arms of the underreamer (4 0 strokes/min and $400\ \mathrm{lb/inch^{2}})$ . The rest of the stinger BHA wa s made up with the Dril-Quip running tool on top. The running too l was latched into the reentry cone, and the driller lifted the complet e assembly to measure the weight of the system and check the engagement of the running tool. Finally, the moonpool doors wer e opened, and the reentry system was lowered through the splas h zone at $1220\,\mathrm{h}$ . Drill pipe was tripped to the seafloor, pausing to fil l pipe with water every ten stands to ensure equalized pressure.  

Hole U1558B was spudded at $_{0120\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 17 November, and th e process of drilling in the reentry cone and $13\%$ inch casing began. The subsea camera system was deployed after the drill-in proces s began so that the amount of time that the camera was at dept h would be limited and a pressure-related failure like the one that occurred at Site U1557 could be avoided. The camera system with th e CTD sensor strapped to the frame was deployed through the moonpool at $0700\,\mathrm{h}$ and was lowered rapidly toward the seafloor. At 083 0 h and a depth of ${\sim}3700\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ , the video feed failed first on the entr y camera and then on the survey camera. The camera system wa s brought back up to $300~\mathrm{{mbsl}}$ and kept there so that drilling in th e casing could continue without interruption. At $155.9\;\mathrm{mbsf},$ the rat e of penetration decreased substantially, indicating that we were no w drilling into hard rock material. Basement at Hole U1558B was encountered $3\,\textrm{m}$ shallower than expected based on Hole U1558 A $\langle158.9\,\mathrm{\mbsf}\rangle$ ). The shallower basement required a longer drillin g time than anticipated. We progressed at a rate of ${\sim}1~\mathrm{m/h}$ until 141 5 h and 161.1 mbsf, when an increase in the measured weight on bi t indicated that the reentry cone had landed on the seafloor.  

We then spent several hours trying to disconnect the drill strin g from the reentry system, applying torque to the drill string and attempting to rotate the Dril-Quip running tool 3.5 turns. At $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 17 November, we were still unable to disengage the running too l and decided to bring the camera back on deck to conduct emergency repairs. While the camera system was being repaired, we continued to attempt to disconnect from the reentry cone withou t being able to observe it. The ship was moved in a $50\;\mathrm{m}$ grid patter n and then a ${100}\;\mathrm{m}$ grid pattern in an attempt to find a position an d angle that might allow the tool to release from the reentry cone.  

The issue with the subsea camera system was determined to b e with the connector between the junction box and telemetry pod, a s was the case with the two previous failures. With no remainin g spare connectors and with clear evidence that the connectors cannot handle pressure, an alternative solution was found. New fibe r and power connections were independently terminated at the junction box and telemetry pod. This solution reduced functionality bu t provided light and a single video feed. The camera repairs wer e completed just before midnight on 17 November, and the repaire d camera system was deployed through the moonpool at ${\sim}0010\,\mathrm{h}$ o n 18 November. It was lowered rapidly to the seafloor without incident and allowed us to view the reentry cone and drill string, although  the  Dril-Quip  running  tool  itself  was  obscured  b y suspended sediment and cuttings. Even with the assistance of th e camera, we were unable to disconnect the running tool. It appeare d that torque applied to the drill string caused rotation of the entir e reentry system and mudskirt, not just the running tool. At $0230\,\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{}}$ , after a total of $12\,\mathrm{{h}}$ trying to disengage from the reentry system, w e made the decision to pull the entire drill string back to the surface, diagnose the issue, and attempt to drill in the casing again in Hol e U1558C. The subsea camera was recovered and secured at $0500\,\mathrm{h}$ . The next ${\sim}12\,\mathrm{h}$ were spent tripping pipe back to the surface.  

The reentry system was pulled up through the splash zone a t $1600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 November and set onto the moonpool doors. We observed that the Dril-Quip running tool was not easily able to mov e along the length of the slots to achieve the neutral position require d to disengage it. Nonetheless, we were able to rotate and disengag e the tool. The tool was lifted to the rig floor and examined. Once o n the rig floor, it was able to move freely, and there was nothing obviously wrong with it. The underreamer and bit were also examine d and found to be in good condition. The bit cleared the rig floor a t $2000\,\mathrm{h}$ on 18 November, ending Hole U1558B. Operations in Hol e U1558B took 3.5 days of operational time.  

# Hole U1558C  

The Dril-Quip running tool was exchanged for a spare, newl y inspected and overhauled one, and the process of redeploying th e reentry system began. We again tested the mud motor and underreamer to confirm the pump rate required for rotation and to ope n the underreamer arms. The stinger was then reassembled, removing a $^{1\textrm{m}}$ drill collar pup joint from the original assembly to decrease the distance between the bit and the casing and reduc e drilling time in basement. The ship was moved back toward Hol e U1558A instead of following the standard offset pattern; we expected that we would encounter hard rock at $\mathord{\sim}158.9$ mbsf instead o f the shallower 155.9 mbsf basement depth found in Hole U1558 B and thus spend less time drilling in hard rock. The stinger with th e mud motor, underreamer, and bit was lowered through the reentr y cone and casing, and the running tool at the top of the stinger engaged with the reentry cone. We then opened the moonpool doors, and the reentry cone was lowered through the splash zone at $0245\,\mathrm{h}$ on 19 November 2020. We tripped pipe down to the seafloor, fillin g the drill pipe with water every ten stands. When the bit was near th e seafloor, we paused operations to perform a routine slip and cut o f the drilling line. We then picked up the top drive and spudded Hol e U1558C at $1635\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

Drilling in the casing continued smoothly through the sedimen t column. We contacted hard rock at 158.9 mbsf. The subsea camer a was deployed just before contact with basement at $0100~\mathrm{h}$ so w e could observe the release of the Dril-Quip running tool from the reentry system. Drilling continued until a decrease in hook load indicated that the reentry cone had landed on the seafloor. We slowl y transferred the weight of the reentry system with casing to the seafloor while trying to maintain weight on bit. We reached a final hol e depth of 162.7 mbsf where we expected that the weight of the reentry system was entirely supported by the seafloor. The next $12~\mathrm{{h}}$ were spent attempting to disconnect the running tool from the reentry system. As with the Hole U1558B attempt, the ship wa s moved in a grid pattern to find a position and angle that might allo w the tool to release from the reentry cone. We also stopped circulation of drill fluids for several hours so that the formation might collapse around the casing and take the weight of the casing string. W e were ultimately unable to disconnect, despite the installation modifications we had made after the first failed attempt. At $1700\,\mathrm{h}$ on 2 0  

November, in consultation with the Expedition 390 and $393\ C_{0}.$ - Chief Scientists, we made the decision to abandon Hole U1558 C and pull the reentry system back to the surface. The subsea camer a was recovered at $1800\,\mathrm{h},$ , and the process of tripping drill pipe bac k to the surface began. The bit cleared the seafloor at $1850\,\mathrm{h}$ .  

The reentry system was raised to just below the ship at ${\sim}0600\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 November. We opened the moonpool doors but had zero visibility in the dark and were unable to determine the orientation o f the reentry cone base. We paused operations until daylight, whe n we could safely recover the reentry system. At $0800~\mathrm{h}$ we reopene d the moonpool doors, oriented the base, and recovered the reentr y system. We observed that three out of four load-bearing plates o n the mudskirt had fallen off during the attempted redeployment. A s with our first attempt at Hole U1558B, the Dril-Quip running too l was easily disconnected from the reentry system once at the surfac e despite our inability to disconnect it while on the seafloor. The running tool, underreamer, and bit were raised to the rig floor and inspected. The underreamer was found to be in excellent condition. The bit cleared the rotary table at $1056~\mathrm{h}$ on 21 November, endin g Hole U1558C. Operations at Hole U1558C took 2.6 days of operational time.  

# Hole U1558D  

After two failed attempts to install casing and a reentry syste m at Site U1558, we determined that our inability to disengage th e Dril-Quip running tool from the reentry system when on the seafloor was due to hard rock inhibiting the complete transfer o f weight off of the tool. The assembly from where the bit sits in har d rock to the running tool is too rigid. As such, the only option fo r installing a casing and reentry system at Site U1558 was to remove  a joint of casing so that the casing shoe landed in sediment above th e hard rock contact. We decided to make a final attempt to install thi s shorter casing string and reentry system. The 16 inch casing hange r was released at $1320\,\mathrm{h}$ on 21 November 2020 by screwing releasin g bolts into the snap ring that holds the hanger in place in the reentr y cone after some initial difficulty compressing the snap ring cause d by debris caught in the ring. The hanger was raised to the rig floo r and swapped out for a spare. We shortened the casing string by removing a single joint and had reassembled it with a length of 146. 1 m by $1745\,\mathrm{h}$ (Figure F9). The running tool was then latched into th e casing  hanger,  and  the  hanger  landed  in  the  reentr y cone. We picked up the mud motor, underreamer, and bit an d tested them to determine the pump rates required for rotation an d for the underreamer arms to open up. Finally, the casing stinger wa s lowered to 150 mbrf and the running tool engaged with the reentr y cone. New plates were welded onto the mudskirt to replace the one s that were lost.  

We opened the moonpool doors and started to lower the reentry cone through the splash zone at ${\sim}0245\mathrm{~h~}$ on 22 November. O n the first attempt, the reentry cone and base slipped out of the bottom snap ring groove, catching on the upper one. We recovered th e system, reset the casing hanger snap ring, and attempted a secon d deployment with the same result. After recovering the system an d resetting the snap ring again, we decided to proceed with the deployment. Changing out the reentry system at this stage would require breaking down and then remaking all of the casing, using u p the remainder of our operational time. The reentry cone was lowered through the splash zone at $0335\,\mathrm{h},$ and we began the process o f tripping drill pipe toward seafloor. Drill pipe was filled with wate r every ten stands. We closely monitored the weight of the drill strin g as an indicator of whether the reentry cone was still attached. However, ship heave generated noisy hook load data that made it difficult to track weight changes on the order of the reentry cone (8. 8 klb). At $0600\ \mathrm{h}_{:}$ the vessel was moved into position over our proposed location for Hole U1558D ( $30~\mathrm{m}$ east of Hole U1558A, nea r Hole U1558B). Prior to the move, the vessel was in an offset positio n $40\;\mathrm{m}$ west and $20\;\mathrm{m}$ south of Hole U1558A.  

The subsea camera system was deployed at $1200~\mathrm{h}$ on $22\ \mathrm{No-}$ vember and lowered toward the seafloor. When the camera caugh t up with the running tool at $3957.6\;\mathrm{mbsl}$ , we observed that the reentry cone had slipped and fallen off of the casing, which was still attached to the drill string via the running tool. We initiated a searc h for the reentry cone on the seafloor. If it could be located and ha d landed in proper orientation, we would be able to reenter and dril l in the casing as planned. We pulled the subsea camera system bac k to the surface so that we could remove the drill pipe insert and install a door that enlarges the opening of the camera frame. The camera was redeployed at $1545~\mathrm{h}$ and lowered over the running tool t o the bottom of the casing string, just above seafloor. Visibility wa s good despite the fact that the repaired camera system only has a single functional camera and light. We searched for the reentry con e by moving the ship in an expanding grid pattern, starting at the offset position $40\;\mathrm{{m}}$ west and $20\textrm{m}$ south of Hole U1558A. Our bes t estimate from the hook load data was that the reentry cone ha d fallen off early in the tripping process, before the ship was positioned over the intended location of Hole U1558D. Ultimately, however, we located the reentry cone and mudskirt at $2223\ \mathrm{h},$ sittin g upright on the seafloor in the vicinity of Holes U1558A–U1558 C and near its intended position. This location implies that the reentry cone fell off after the ship had moved. We picked up the to p drive and prepared to spud Hole U1558D.  

The cone was reentered at $0056~\mathrm{h}$ on 23 November, and Hol e U1558D was spudded at $0059\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . The drill-in process proceede d smoothly, and the bit achieved a maximum depth of 150.0 mbsf a t $0745\,\mathrm{~h~}$ . The length of the shortened casing string was $146.1\,\mathrm{~m~}$ . Basement was estimated to be at $\mathord{\sim}155.9$ mbsf in Hole U1558D. After landing the casing hanger in the reentry system, the Dril-Qui p running tool rotated easily and disengaged from the casing and reentry cone at $0750\,\mathrm{h}$ . We began pulling the subsea camera and dril l string back to the surface and recovered the camera at $0945\;\mathrm{h}.$ . Fo r the next ${\sim}8\,\mathrm{h},$ we pulled the remaining drill pipe to the surface. Th e running tool was recovered at $1800\,\mathrm{h}$ , and the rest of the BHA wa s pulled up to the rig floor and laid out. The UGH was reinstalled, an d the rig floor was secured for transit to Site U1559 at $2356\,\mathrm{h}$ , endin g Hole U1558D. The vessel switched out of DP mode at $0003~\mathrm{h}$ an d was underway at full speed by $0018\;\mathrm{h}.$ . Operations at Hole U1558 D took 2.5 days of operational time.  

# Principal results  

Basement at Site U1558 was determined to be only slightl y deeper than estimated from seismic data: at 158.9 mbsf in Hole s U1558A and U1558C and at 155.9 mbsf in Hole U1558B, relative t o the estimated 148 mbsf. Video footage acquired from the subse a camera during the survey for the reentry cone at Hole U1558D indicates that Holes U1558A and U1558C are $_{<10\mathrm{~m~}}$ apart, suggestin g that there is substantial basement topography within short latera l distances. Figure F10 compares the geographic coordinates of th e Site U1558 holes, taken from the ship at the surface, with where th e holes actually appear to be in footage from the subsea camera system. The deep water and long drill string results in the location o f the hole not being directly underneath the ship.  

Cores 390C-U1558A-1H through 18X were measured on th e WR and split-core track systems. Core 19X sections, which contai n hard rock material, were measured on the WR tracks but were no t split. They were instead preserved in nitrogen gas–flushed bags fo r description and analysis during Expeditions 390 and 393. The sediment/basement interface occurs in the Core 18X core catcher, which was accidentally split before we realized that the interfac e was present in that section. The core catcher section halves wer e subsequently vacuum sealed and stored in D tubes. Core catche r samples from Cores 1H–17X were collected for postexpedition biostratigraphic dating. In addition, we collected one sample per cor e for headspace gas analysis as well as one to two WR samples pe r core for chemical analysis of IW. Starting with Core 16X, we collected $10~\mathrm{cm}$ instead of $5\;\mathrm{cm}\;\mathrm{WR}$ samples to ensure enough wate r was available for standard analyses. No systematic core descriptio n took place during Expedition 390C. Sediment lithology consists primarily of carbonate ooze, aside from the first two cores. Core 1H i s predominantly clay and has a calcium carbonate content of 24. 1 $\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Core 2H contains alternating $0.5–1\;\mathrm{m}$ thick clay- and carbonate-rich layers and has a calcium carbonate content of $47.1~\mathrm{wt\%}$ a t 7.825 mbsf. Below that depth, calcium carbonate content average s $80.1~\mathrm{wt\%}$ . Physical properties such as magnetic susceptibility an d counts of NGR generally correlate with lithology, with higher magnetic susceptibility values and NGR counts in the clay layers and i n the hard rock sections. $P$ -wave velocity and GRA density increas e downhole, with a significant increase in GRA density values in basement of Core 19X. $P$ -wave velocity was not measured in that core.  

Data acquired from analysis of IW in Hole U1558A do not sho w downhole trends as clear as those observed at Sites U1556 an d U1557. Alkalinity shows a very narrow range in concentratio n $(2.28{-}2.56\ \mathrm{mM})$ , and concentrations are generally lower than thos e found at Sites U1556 and U1557. Total dissolved sulfur concentrations, as measured using ICP-AES of IW samples, are relatively constant throughout the sediment column. A maximum concentratio n of $29.3\ \mathrm{mM}$ occurs in the mudline sample, and downhole concentrations average $27.9\pm0.9\:\mathrm{mM}$ . Dissolved manganese (Mn) concentrations increase downhole, reaching a maximum value of $3.02~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at ${\sim}126$ mbsf and then decreasing toward basement. Mn concentrations are significantly lower than at Sites U1556 and U1557, wher e peak Mn concentrations are ${>}100~\upmu\mathrm{M}$ . The peak in dissolved Mn a t ${\sim}126$ mbsf is followed by a sharp peak in ammonium (reachin g $213.4\,\upmu\mathrm{M}$ at ${\sim}130\,\mathrm{mbsf})$ ) and then a sharp decline in sulfur to a minimum of $24.5\ \mathrm{mM}$ at $\mathord{\sim}137$ mbsf. These respective maximum an d minimum values are only present in one or two samples and wil l need to be confirmed through higher resolution sampling durin g Expeditions 390 and 393. Combined, however, the data suggest  a deep redox horizon and indicate that the upper sediment colum n may be oxygenated. This hypothesis can be verified with direc t measurements of dissolved oxygen during Expeditions 390 and 393. Dissolved iron was below the detection limit, likely because it reoxidized and precipitated during the WR squeezing process.  

Dissolved  calcium  and  strontium  concentrations  increas e downhole before decreasing again just above basement; the inflection point is ${\sim}140~\mathrm{m}$ . Their concentrations in IW are overall lowe r than at Sites U1556 and U1557. Conversely, dissolved magnesiu m and potassium concentrations decrease slightly with depth and d o not show a near-basement reversal in the trend. Dissolved silico n concentrations decrease from the surface to ${\sim}25$ mbsf and then remain relatively constant with depth. Boron concentrations decreas e initially but increase again at ${\sim}115$ mbsf. The two elements do no t have the close inverse correlation observed at Sites U1556 an d U1557.  

All cores excluding the unsplit basement sections were measured on the SRM for NRM and then at alternating field demagnetization levels of 5, 10, and $20~\mathrm{mT}.$ Vertical drilling overprints wer e ubiquitous but were generally removed by the $5~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step. Many samples appeared to show a ChRM after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization,  although  some  likely  have  a  higher  coercivit y component that will need to be examined during postexpedition research.  

The CTD sensor was deployed along with the subsea camer a system at Hole U1558B. It successfully logged water column data.  

# Site U1559  

Site U1559 (proposed site SATL-13A) is in the central South Atlantic Ocean, ${\sim}130\,\mathrm{km}$ west of the MAR. The objective for Expedition 390C was to core one hole with the APC/XCB system t o basement for gas safety monitoring and to install a reentry syste m with casing through the sediment to $\sim\!5\;\mathrm{m}$ above basement in a second hole to expedite basement drilling during SAT Expeditions 39 0 and 393.  

Site U1559 is located on Seismic Line CREST01 at CDP 1192 3 between the CREST06 and CREST1E/F crossing lines. A reflector a t ${\sim}4.15\ s$ s TWT is interpreted to be the top of basement and was estimated at 50 mbsf (Figure F4). Basement is predicted to be approximately $6.6~\mathrm{Ma}$ and formed at a half spreading rate of ${\sim}17.0\ \mathrm{mm/y}.$ This site was selected as the young crustal end-member of the SA T and will be compared to older crustal material cored at sites furthe r west. The site is similar in age to Hole 504B in the eastern equatoria l Pacific $\left(6.9\mathrm{~Ma}\right)$ , which formed at an intermediate rate $(36~\mathrm{mm/y}$ half spreading rate) and is covered by $275~\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. As such, material from Site U1559 will allow comparison of how alteratio n progresses at different spreading centers and with different thicknesses of overlying sediment and sedimentation histories. Overlying sediment from Site U1559 is expected to be primarily carbonat e ooze and will be used in paleoceanographic and microbiologica l studies.  

# Operations  

# Hole U1559A  

The JOIDES Resolution completed the $508\,\mathrm{\nmi}$ transit to Sit e U1559 from Site U1558 at an average speed of $12.3~\mathrm{kt}$ . We arrive d on site at $1715\,\mathrm{h}$ on 25 November 2020, lowered the thrusters, an d were in DP mode ready to begin operations by $1740\;\mathrm{h}.$ . An acousti c beacon was not deployed. The APC/XCB BHA with a nonmagneti c drill collar was made up and deployed, and we began tripping pip e toward the seafloor. Hole U1559A was spudded at $0140\,\mathrm{h}$ on $26\,\mathrm{No}-$ vember with the bit positioned at $3049.7\ \mathrm{mbsl}$ , and Core 390CU1559A-1H recovered $3.54\:\mathrm{m}$ of sediment. The mudline core established the water depth as 3055.7 mbsl. APC coring continue d through Core $4\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{i}}$ , advancing to 32 mbsf and recovering $32.9\mathrm{~m~}$ o f sediment $(103\%)$ . After Core 4H, we transitioned to the XCB corin g system because basement was estimated to be at 50 mbsf. No magnetic orientation or temperature measurements were conducte d with the APC cores because of time constraints and because we di d not want to damage tools if we encountered basement at a shallowe r depth than expected. XCB Cores 5X–8X advanced from 32 to 64. 7 mbsf. We encountered a hard layer at 64.0 mbsf that dramaticall y decreased the rate of penetration to ${<}1\ \mathrm{m/h}$ . Recovery of this laye r was poor: ${\sim}11\%$ of the $0.7\textrm{m}$ advance and ${\sim}8~\mathrm{cm}$ of small, rubbl y pieces of basalt. The XCB PDC cutting shoe lost several cutter s while coring Core 8X. It is unclear whether the lost cutters were du e to cumulative use during the entire expedition or difficulty in cutting this younger basalt material. Core 9X was drilled by time (14 0 min) rather than by advance because the penetration rate was extremely low and we wanted to avoid damaging the bit by exposing i t to elevated temperatures. Ultimately, Core 9X advanced $1.5~\mathrm{m}$ at  a rate of $0.64\;\mathrm{m/h}$ . Only $0.39\;\mathrm{m}$ of material was recovered $(26\%)$ , consisting of indurated sediment and altered glass (Figure F6). Excluding hard rock material, Cores 5X–8X advanced $32\;\mathrm{m}$ and recovere d $24.64\mathrm{~m~}(77\%)$ . In total, Hole U1559A penetrated to 66.2 mbsf wit h a recovery of $58.01\;\mathrm{m}\;(88\%)$ (Table T2; Figure F7). We began pullin g out of the hole after Core 9X to have time to install a reentry syste m with casing. The bit cleared the rig floor at $2200\ \mathrm{h},$ ending Hol e U1559A. Overall, coring in Hole U1559A took 1.2 days of operational time.  

# Hole U1559B  

To prepare for installation of the reentry system at Hol e U1559B, the UGH was removed and the reentry cone was positioned above the moonpool doors underneath the rig floor. The casing shoe was found to be damaged, and a new one was prepared. Four joints of $13\%$ inch casing were made up, followed by a crossover and the 16 inch casing hanger needed to latch into the reentr y cone. One joint of casing was found to have a bent coupling and wa s replaced. Once the casing string was made up, the Dril-Quip running tool was used to lower it through the reentry cone and latch i t into place. Next, the BHA with the bit, underreamer, and mud motor was made up and lowered through the casing, and the runnin g tool engaged with the reentry system. The moonpool doors wer e opened, and the reentry system was lowered through the splas h zone at $1645\,\mathrm{h}$ on 27 November 2020. The reentry system was lowered at a controlled rate of descent, pausing to fill the drill pipe wit h water every 10 stands to ensure equalized pressure. The subse a camera was deployed at $2345\,\mathrm{h}$ to observe the casing drill-in proces s and release. The CTD sensor was attached to the frame of the subsea camera system and logged water column data during the camer a deployment.  

With the bit spaced out to $3022.7~\mathrm{mbsl}$ , we picked up the to p drive and spudded Hole U1559B at $_{0130\,\mathrm{{h}}}$ on 28 November, establishing the seafloor depth as $3055.0\ \mathrm{m}$ . The bit reached its maximum depth of 58.9 mbsf by $0315\,\mathrm{h}$ with the casing shoe at $55.3\,\mathrm{mbsf}$ (Figure F11). Basement is expected to be at 64.0 mbsf. With the reentry system on the seafloor, the driller then applied torque to rotate the running tool 3.5 times, releasing it from the reentry syste m and casing. We pulled out of the hole, and the bit cleared the reentr y cone at $0358~\mathrm{h}$ . The subsea camera was pulled back to the surfac e and recovered at $0415~\mathrm{h}$ . The top drive was set back, and fluid wa s circulated through the drill string, displacing seawater with freshwater in the drill pipe. We tripped the rest of the drill pipe back t o surface, recovered and laid out the BHA, and detorqued the running tool. The UGH was reinstalled, and the moonpool was secured. The rig floor was secured for transit at $1815\;\mathrm{h},$ , ending Hol e U1559B as well as operations for Expedition 390C. Overall, Hol e U1559B took 1.8 days of operational time. The ship transitioned ou t of DP mode and got underway. The $1723\;\mathrm{nmi}$ transit to Cape Town, South Africa, was anticipated to take ${\sim}6.5$ days with an estimate d arrival on 5 December.  

# Principal results  

Basement at Site U1559 was determined to be only slightl y deeper than estimated from seismic data: at 64.0 mbsf relative to th e estimated 50 mbsf. Cores 390C-U1559A-1H through 7X were measured on the WR and split-core track systems. Sections from Core s 8X and 9X, which contain hard rock material, were measured on th e WR tracks but were not split. They were instead preserved in nitrogen gas–flushed bags for description and analysis during Expeditions 390 and 393. Core catcher samples from Cores 1H–7X wer e collected for postexpedition biostratigraphic dating. In addition, w e collected one sample per core for headspace gas analysis as well a s one to two WR samples per core for chemical analysis of IW. N o systematic core description took place during Expedition 390C. Sediment lithology consists of carbonate ooze. Sediment color i s slightly darker in the first core and then transitions to a lighter whit e throughout the rest of the hole. However, even in this upper, darke r core, calcium carbonate content is $92.2\ \mathrm{wt\%}$ . Physical propertie s generally correlate with lithology. Counts of NGR peak in the firs t section of the first core, decline rapidly through the first core, an d then continue to decrease slowly with depth throughout the hole.  

Data acquired from analysis of IW in Hole U1559A do not sho w downhole trends as clear as those observed at Sites U1556 an d U1557. Alkalinity is relatively low in the mudline sample $(2.32\,\mathrm{mM})$ , increases to a broad maximum at ${\sim}30~\mathrm{mbsf},$ , and then decrease s again toward basement. Similar to results from Hole U1558A, th e range in alkalinity concentrations $(2.24{-}2.90\ \mathrm{mM})$ is less than tha t found at Sites U1556 and U1557. Total dissolved sulfur concentrations, as measured using ICP-AES of IW samples, likewise do no t vary substantially downhole, ranging from $29.6\ \mathrm{mM}$ in the mudlin e sample to a minimum of $28.2\;\mathrm{mM}$ at 60.175 mbsf. Total sulfur concentrations are similar in value to sulfate concentrations measure d by ion chromatography. There is no indication of significant sulfat e reduction in the sediment column at this site. Dissolved Mn concentrations do show a subsurface maximum, however, suggestin g reduction of oxidized Mn mineral phases. Dissolved iron is belo w the detection limit, likely because it reoxidized and precipitate d during the WR squeezing process. There is no clear trend in ammonium concentrations, which were near the detection limit of th e spectrophotometer.  

Dissolved calcium (Ca) data do not show a clear trend in the to p portion of the hole, although concentrations reach maximum value s between $\mathord{\sim}20$ and 40 mbsf and then decrease again toward basement. Strontium (Sr) concentrations more clearly increase to thi s depth and then decrease toward basement. As with data from Hol e U1558A, Ca and Sr concentrations are lower than at Sites U155 6 and U1557. Dissolved magnesium concentrations are variable wit h depth, whereas potassium increases slightly with a sharp decreas e just above the hard rock contact at 64.0 mbsf. Dissolved silicon concentrations are low in the mudline sample, relatively constant wit h depth, and then increase above basement. Boron concentrations ar e low in the mudline sample, increase with depth, and then decreas e slightly above basement.  

All cores excluding the unsplit basement sections were measured on the SRM for NRM and then at alternating field demagnetization levels of 5, 10, and $20~\mathrm{mT}.$ Vertical drilling overprints wer e ubiquitous but were generally removed by the $5~\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization step. Many samples appeared to show a ChRM after $20\;\mathrm{mT}$ demagnetization,  although  some  likely  have  a  higher  coercivit y component that will need to be examined during postexpedition research. A spike in intensity at the top of Section 390C-U1559A-7X1 was likely caused by a small piece of hard material, possibly basalt, which is observable in the X-ray images.  

The CTD sensor was deployed along with the subsea camer a system at Hole U1559B. It successfully logged water column data.  

# Preliminary scientific assessment  

The primary goal of Expedition 390C was to complete casin g and reentry system installations in advance of Expeditions 390 an d 393. Secondary goals included coring across the sediment/basement interface with the XCB coring system and analyzing core d material for ephemeral properties. The operational plan evolve d over the course of the expedition, first growing in scope to includ e work at Sites U1556 and U1557 when the end port for the expedition was changed to Cape Town, South Africa, from Las Palmas, Canary Islands (Spain), and then decreasing in scope as reentry system installations did not proceed smoothly. With transits fro m Kristiansand, Norway, to Cape Town, Expedition 390C had 32 day s of operational time along the SAT (Figures F12, F13). Figure F14 shows work completed at SAT sites in addition to the remaining operational objectives to be accomplished during future SAT expeditions.  

# Operational considerations  

In an effort to facilitate the long-term goal of installing borehol e observatories at SAT sites, we attempted to install casing into basement at Site U1558. Both attempts (Holes U1558B and U1558C) resulted in our being unable to disengage the Dril-Quip running too l from the casing hanger and necessitated pulling the entire dril l string, including the reentry system and casing, back to the surface. We hypothesize that the rigidity of the BHA between the runnin g tool and the drill bit in hard rock prevents the complete transfer o f weight off of the running tool, which in turn inhibits our ability t o move the running tool into the neutral position so that it can be rotated and released. In both instances, the running tool was easil y disengaged at the surface. When the casing shoe was positioned i n sediment in Holes U1557D, U1558D, and U1559B, the tool was als o easily disengaged. This outcome suggests that, for future endeavor s involving installation of casing into basement, either a hydraulic release tool (HRT) reentry system should be used or the hole shoul d be fully drilled out beyond the intended depth of the casing sho e prior to casing installation.  

At all sites, the XCB system with a PDC cutting shoe was used t o advance $2{-}10\;\mathrm{m}$ into hard rock material with the goal of capturin g the sediment/basement interface. Although not designed for drilling in hard rock material, the cutting shoe performed extremel y well, particularly in the altered basalts and indurated sediment encountered at Sites U1556–U1558. We experienced relatively hig h recoveries ( $550\%$ of cored hard rock material at those sites) and recovered large, well-trimmed pieces with comparatively few “rollers ” (small pieces of rock that may have shifted in position and orientation during recovery). In Hole U1559A, our time was limited and w e were only able to advance $\sim\!2\textrm{m}$ into basement, experiencing poo r recovery. Recovered hard rock consisted of small, rubbly pieces o f basalt and indurated sediment. Four of six cutters from the PD C cutting shoe were lost while drilling Core 390C-U1559-8X. Cor e 9X, deployed with the alternate PDC cutting shoe, did not recove r any of the cutters lost during Core 8X and did not lose cutters, although two were chipped.  

It is unclear whether the damage to the PDC cutting shoes i n Cores 390C-U1559-8X and 9X can be attributed to cumulative wea r over the course of the expedition or difficulty in drilling younger basalt material. In either case, the PDC cutting shoe outperformed th e tungsten carbide insert (TCI) cutting shoes that have been used previously in similar environments. This result may be due to the different cutting shoe material (PDC rather than tungsten carbide) o r may be attributable to the design and geometry of the shoe. Th e TCI cutting shoes have one fewer cutter and fewer jets, reducin g fluid circulation and cooling capability. In addition, the TCI cutter s are all oriented inwards, whereas the PDC cutting shoe has thre e cutters oriented inward and three oriented outward, more completely separating the core from the formation. Because capturin g the sediment/basement interface is often a science priority, the positive results from this expedition merit further investigation.  

# Preliminary assessment of scientific objectives  

At Site U1556, the hard rock contact was significantly deepe r than estimated (at 278 mbsf instead of the estimated $180~\mathrm{{mbsf}}$ );  a shallow reflection at 6.9 s TWT that marked a change in seismi c character from high-frequency to low-frequency reflectivity wa s misinterpreted to be basement. A deeper reflector has been reinterpreted to be basement. Further coring and logging operations wil l provide insight into what generates the observed reflectors (Figur e F4). The thick sediment layer at Site U1556 and consequent reinterpretation of seismic data also led us to designate proposed Sit e SATL-56A a primary site instead of proposed Site SATL-54A, which had an estimated basement contact at 639 mbsf. At tha t depth, or any deeper, we would not be able to install casing all th e way to basement because of concerns about drill string weight tha t limit the maximum deployable casing string length to ${\sim}600\mathrm{~m~}$ i n that water depth $(\sim\!5000\;\mathrm{mbsl})$ . The hard rock contact was slightl y deeper than estimated at all other sites, likely because of slight differences in seismic velocities from what was expected.  

XCB coring advanced between 2 and $10\;\mathrm{m}$ into hard rock material at all Expedition 390C sites. At most sites, however, the har d rock was not true basalt basement but a mixture of indurated sediment, volcaniclastics, and basalt (Figure F6). Material recovere d from Site U1558 appears to be true basalt crust, although drillin g has advanced only $5\textrm{m}$ . For all sites, it remains undetermined ho w thick this layer of transition material is.  

Lithology of recovered sediment was as expected: primarily carbonate ooze, with occasional clay layers. Systematic core description will occur during Expeditions 390 and 393. Sediment from th e westernmost Sites, U1556 and U1557, records alternations betwee n carbonate-rich and carbonate-poor sediment that are possibly related to fluctuations in the depth of the CCD, a science objective fo r the expeditions. IW chemical data also indicate that Expedition 39 0 and 393 sites will provide the necessary material to address the science objectives. Increased concentrations of dissolved magnesiu m and potassium in WR samples from just above the sediment/basement interface at Sites U1556 and U1557 suggest fluid flow along o r near the interface. Clearly defined redox horizons at Sites U155 6 and U1557 (apparent in the manganese, ammonium, and sulfu r data) will guide microbiological sampling efforts during Expeditions 390 and 393, particular those targeting sulfur metabolisms. A t Sites U1558 and U1559, the pore water data show less pronounce d depth trends, but the relatively low concentrations of dissolve d manganese and ammonium as well as the high concentrations o f sulfur suggest deep penetration of oxygen into the sediment column.

Figure F2. A. Schematic architecture of a mid-ocean ridge flank (not to scale) that illustrates parameters that may influence the intensity and style of hydrothermal alteration and the hypothetical trajectory of the $120^{\circ}\mathsf{C}$ isotherm with crustal age. Arrows indicate heat (red) and fluid (blue) flow. B. Calculated globa l hydrothermal heat flow anomaly, which decreases to 0 by $65~\mathsf{M a}$ on average, and hypothetical variations in fluid flow and chemical exchange and crusta l properties that could be measured to investigate the intensity and style of ridge flank hydrothermal circulation (e.g., porosity, permeability, and two possibl e scenarios for alteration intensity). (After Coggon and Teagle, 2011; Expedition 335 Scientists, 2012; and an original figure by K. Nakamura, AIST.)

Bottom: stills of video footage recorded during the search for th e U1558D reentry cone showing the seafloor locations of holes. The lower image is flipped so that both images are oriented with north up. Rotation of th e mudskirt on the seafloor during attempted disconnects caused the target patterns visible around Holes U1558B and U1558C and provides a scale for th e images. The edge of the U1558D reentry cone is just visible behind the casing.
